				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a system for hot slab length measurement passed torch<br>
cutting machine. More particularly, the invention relates to a correlation search-<br>
based hot slab length measurement system in a continuous casting sub-process<br>
of steel manufacturing process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In a continuous casting process of steel manufacturing, molten steel is poured<br>
into a vertically aligned water-cooled mold of rectangular cross-section, from<br>
where it emerges as a continuous strand which is a solidified shell encapsulating<br>
the liquid material. The continuous strand is further cooled by water sprays and<br>
bent using rollers till its complete solidification including attainment of horizontal<br>
alignment. Due to thermal and bending stress including oxidation and oscillation<br>
in the process, several prominent and rich textures are often engraved, in the<br>
form of oscillation marks and scales, which are visible on the strand surface. The<br>
existing method of determining a slab length which has passed a reference point,<br>
essentially depends upon the turn count of the rollers. However, such a method<br>
of the slab computing length, always suffers from the drawback that the mass of<br>
the continuous strand slips on the roller bed leading to inaccurate turn count of<br>
the rollers.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention is to propose a slab length<br>
measurement system in a continuous casting sub-process of steel manufacturing<br>
process.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a slab length measurement system<br>
in a continuous casting sub-process of steel manufacturing process, which is<br>
enabled to automatically determine the cut length of the hot slab.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a slab length measurement<br>
system in a continuous casting sub-process of steel manufacturing process,<br>
which is capable to measure the length of the hot slab accurately.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a slab length measurement system in a continuous<br>
casting sub-process of steel manufacturing process, in which a high-resolution<br>
camera is provided to continuously monitor the slab movement to determine the<br>
length of hot slab thus passed a reference point. This is a machine vision system<br>
thus, the images when fed into an embedded hardware unit hosting an<br>
algorithm, the captured frames can be analyzed to determine the optical flow<br>
between two subsequent frames separated in a time space.<br><br>
BEIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention can now be described in detail with the help of the figures of the<br>
accompanying drawings in which,<br>
Fig. 1 - is a schematic view of a known continuous caster.<br>
Fig. 2 - is a schematic diagram of the slab length measurement system,<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 - is a side view of a slab surface.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention as depicted in the accompanying<br>
drawings will now be explained in details. However there can be several other<br>
embodiments all of which are deemed covered by this specification.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the slab length measurement system is positioned<br>
adjacent to one side of the roller table of the continuous caster. The system is<br>
positioned at about 8 meters distance from the roller bed of the continuous<br>
caster of Figure 1 and positioned at about 4 meters from the start of the<br>
secondary cooling zone as shown in figure 1.<br>
The slab caster is generally full of vibrations due to oscillation of the vertical<br>
mold. Accordingly, no camera can be kept close to the hot slab and a telephoto<br>
lens is used to obtain good optical resolution making it more sensitive to<br><br>
vibration. To overcome the vibration, the inventive system is equipped with<br>
vibration absorbers at two different levels.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the system is provided with a shock-absorption device<br>
comprising a base 23 mounted on the concrete platform at the shop floor, a<br>
rubber padding 22 is disposed between the base 23 and a vertical member to<br>
absorb the vibrations induced because of the heavy mechanical oscillations of the<br>
mold. A shock absorber 20 provided at the bottom portion (19) of the system to<br>
cancel out any faintest vibrations left so far. The main system is configured<br>
within a metal housing 8 mounted on the bottom portion (19).<br>
Light form the slab goes inside the housing 8 through a circular aperture 3 of<br>
diameter for example, 50 mm, which has a glass wall to prevent the dust<br>
entering the housing (8). An air-purging outlet 4 is provided to prevent dust<br>
accumulation onto the outer glass surface. The IR radiation can be harmful for<br>
the couple charged device (CD) cells. In order to protect the photo sensor from<br>
the infra red radiation, an IR filter 5 with suitable cut-off frequency is provided<br>
just after the aperture 3. The lights from the opening 3 is gathered and focused<br>
on the image plane of a camera 7, and a lens 6. The camera 7 and the lens 6 is<br>
mounted on a vertical slider 9.<br>
Since the slab is red hot, the fine surface details get masked due to excessive<br>
infra red radiation from the surface. Though the infra red part of the<br>
accumulated light from the couple charged device (CCD) does not contain visible<br>
information, it has sufficient energy to excite the CCD cells to add up charge.<br><br>
This phenomena produces blur image of the object emitting infra red radiation.<br>
To overcome this problem the infra-red component is swamped by putting metal<br>
halite bulbs which in effect, increases the reflected component of light in the<br>
visible range. The external infrared cut-off filter 5 mounted in front of the<br>
camera 7 and lens unit 6 prevents infra red light to reach the coupled charged<br>
device (CCD). A calibration unit consisting of 12 dots distributed over a steel<br>
sheet determines the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the camera 7.<br>
In order to determine the lateral distance between the image plane of the<br>
camera 7 and the slab surface, two laser pointers 1 and 2 are installed in the<br>
housing 8 such that they make equal angles with the principal axis of the camera<br>
7. The wavelengths of the laser pointers 1 and 2 are chosen such that they are<br>
easily distinguishable on the red-hot slab surface in the image captured by the<br>
camera 7. Projection of the laser pointers 1 and 2, in the captured image can<br>
lead to distance computation through simple mathematics. The assembly of the<br>
camera 7 and the laser pointers 1 and 2, are driven by 12V DC power unit 11<br>
which is installed inside the housing 8.<br>
The system exploits the extensive texture information present on the side<br>
surface of the cast hot slab due to scale formation and oscillation masks<br>
engraved while casting. The high resolution camera 7 equipped with high focal<br>
length lens 1 and 2, captures the finer details of the surface which is further<br>
analyzed to produce accurate movement of the slab.<br><br>
The images captured by the camera 7 is sent to an embedded hardware 14,<br>
hereinafter known as 'the host' through a physical USB 2.0 link 13 between the<br>
camera 7 and the host 14. The embedded hardware 14 hosts an image<br>
processing algorithms to compute the correlation search based optical flow<br>
between two successive image frames, as shown in Figure 3, obtained at a fixed<br>
time interval.<br>
The fixed time interval is chosen in accordance with the casting speed that is to<br>
say, the speed by which the hot slab moves on the roller bed as shown in Figure<br>
1. The casting speed normally varies from 0 meter / min to 1.2 meter / min.<br>
Once the optical flow between the two successive image frames is computed by<br>
the host unit 14, it is converted into the motion vectors pertaining to the actual<br>
motion of the slab. This data is sent to the operator through RS - 232<br>
communication unit 15 attached to the host 14.<br>
A clean air purging unit 18 is provided which delivers purified air in downward<br>
direction so that the stream of the clean air circulates inside the metal housing 8<br>
and surface out from the outlets 4 and 24.<br>
To protect the electronics of the units, for example, the camera (7), D.C. power<br>
unit (11), hardware unit (14), the metal housing (8) is equipped with water<br>
cooling arrangement in which, water flowing through a plurality of copper tubes<br>
inside the hollow walls of the housing 8, with an inlet 17 and an outlet 16.<br>
The images, adjacent to each other in time domain, captured by the camera 7<br>
are fed into the host 14.<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Five 100 x 100 pixels wide, overlapping blocks in the first 30% width of the<br>
image are selected according to the standard deviation of the pixel values inside<br>
the bounding rectangles.<br><br>
Where,<br>
Xi : Denotes the gray value of the vectorized ith pixel in the block<br>
-X : Denotes the average gray value of the block and<br>
n : Donates the number of pixels in the block<br>
Given the brightness constancy and temporal coherence assumption, one can<br>
safely assume the later image is space shifted 2-D version of the former image.<br>
Thus the motion vector between two images can be determined by the peak of<br>
the correlation surface obtained using normalized cross correlation as defined<br>
below.<br>
If image A has dimensions (Ma, Na) and image B has dimensions (Mb, Nb), the<br>
equation for the two-dimensional discrete cross-correlation is :-<br><br><br><br>
