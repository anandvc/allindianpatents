This Service can be offered independent of the access technology used by the client. The users can program their schedules and other users can fix the appointments based on the schedule. The Application Server in the IMS Network stores the scheduled information of a user and appointments scheduled by other users in Document management server (DMS). Apart from scheduling this methodology/service provides many other features. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method to provide scheduler service for IMS and VOIP subscriber during call and through portal service.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The patent publication US20050261011A1 describes a method wherein a user can view calendar application of another user through an instant messaging interface. The user can request for an appointment at a given time. However, the publication does not mention publishing the schedule on a portal and a user scheduling an appointment via the portal.<br>
The patent publication US20040252197describes a method to share a calendar application among multiple mobile devices. A mobile device can access calendar on another mobile device and request for an appointment. The publication does<br><br>
not talk about publishing the schedule on an internet website and a user fixing an appointment using the website.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a method where an IMS subscriber can publish his schedule on a portal and a user can view this schedule and request for an appointment.<br>
Accordingly, the invention encompasses a method to provide scheduler service for IMS and VOIP subscriber during call and through portal service wherein the subscriber publish his schedule and a user viewing the schedule request for an appointment and once the subscriber authorizes the request, the meeting is scheduled and optionally providing a dial out feature where an application server initiates a call with the user at a specific time.<br>
The subscriber publishes his schedule via Portal or during call or Notification so that interested users schedule appointments. The user-scheduled appointments are sent for authorization, and once approved the appointment gets scheduled. The user gets consolidated report of the scheduled appointments. The users can optionally add text / multimedia messages to specify the agenda for the appointment. While scheduling for other user's appointment users will be given a choice for selecting a dial out option where an application Server initiates a multimedia session / call to the user at a particular time, based on presence and<br><br>
availability of users. Optionally Application Server gives prior intimation to the user about the call and if the user is busy or not available based on presence information then scheduler link will be sent for re-scheduling. Scheduling is integrated as part of the user's personnel portal where an application server provides a web-based interface to schedule appointments of the users.<br>

Main Inventive Concept<br>
This service will be provided to IMS Subscribers using access independent IMS Network who doesn't require any special software or 3rd party server registrations. For example need not register with www.gooqle.com or www.vahoo.com for availing this service.<br>
With this Application Server Non IMS Subscribers like VOIP subscribers can avail this service using VOIP Network and VOIP Server (SIP Server). An IMS based Application Server provides this service. This service is provided for all the IMS<br><br>
users. User can publish his calendar via Portal or during call or Notification so that other interested users can schedule appointments. Scheduling can be done with or without authorization. Once scheduled, appointment will be sent for authorization, and once approved it will be scheduled. An IM (Sip MESSAGE) will be sent to user requesting for authorization.<br>
Once appointments are scheduled for a particular day/week/month, the user will get consolidated report of the appointments. Users can optionally add text /multimedia messages to specify the agenda for the appointment. While scheduling for other user's appointment users will be given a choice for selecting a dial out option. In Dial out case, Application Server will initiate a multimedia session (Audio, Video and Data/Text) / call to the user at a particular time, based on presence (checks with Presence Server) and availability of users. Before dialing out to the users, Application Server checks for device capabilities of users devices and based on that initiates a audio or a multimedia session / call / Chat Session / any type of IM Session.<br>
Optionally Application Server intimates the users about the call before few minutes through IM (MESSAGE). In case if the user(s) are busy or not available based on presence information then scheduler link will be sent for re-scheduling. For the scheduled appointments with dial out option, on the scheduled time Application Server can optionally verify the device capabilities of both the users and initiate a session with the device supported capabilities. Users while scheduling can optionally schedule for different contact information, so that this<br><br>
features provides advantage for scheduling on behalf of other users.<br>
Scheduling is integrated as part of the user's personnel portal. Application Server provides a web based interface to schedule appointments of the users. Soft Client running in IMS Phone can also provide an application program to schedule appointments and publish with Application Server.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
•	Till now one can view the other persons Calendar information. This<br>
Scheduling feature provides opportunity to view the calendar and book<br>
appointments  for the  available day/week/month  etc.,.     with  prior<br>
authorization and notifications.<br>
•	Using access independent IMS core network or VOIP network this<br>
service can be offered to any fixed or mobile users.<br>
•	Subscribers   can   PUBLISH  their  availability   ahead   of  time,   and<br>
Application Server uses this information to organize SCHEDULES for<br>
that user.<br>
•	Using the scheduler service users can easily schedule appointments.<br>
•	Application  Server saves the scheduled  data  along with  contact<br>
information and dials out at a scheduled time.<br>
•	Users while scheduling can optionally add text/multimedia description<br>
which explains about the reason for appointment.<br>
•	Application server dials out to the specified contacts based on their<br>
presence and availability.<br><br>
•	In case if a user(s) (eg: celebrity or visitors booked the appointment) are<br>
not available during the scheduled time, application server provides<br>
option for rescheduling by users.<br>
•	Scheduling will be done once the appointments are authorized and<br>
confirmed by the user (Celebrity). Only authorized schedules will be<br>
confirmed.<br>
•	Consolidated scheduled report (daily/weekly/monthly) will be sent to the<br>
user whose schedules are booked.<br>
•	Value added feature for Celebrities/ Professionals/ Enterprises etc.,<br>
