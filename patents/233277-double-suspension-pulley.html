				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a Double Suspension Pulley.<br>
A Pulley is a device which is used for lifting of heavy loads by means of wire ropes passing in the groove provided in the Pulley.<br>
The main handicap of the conventional Pulley is that in case the wire rope, holding the heavy load being lifted, accidently breakes at any place throughout its length, the heavy load falls to the ground with a thud. There is every possibility that because of the fall due to accidental breakage of the wire rope, the heavy load may get damaged and the workers working the Pulley may get injured.<br>
To avoid falling of the heavy load being lifted because of accidental breakage of the wire rope, holes are provided on the conventional Pulley through which clamps are inserted. These clamps hold the wire rope rigidly in case the wire rope breaks thereby preventing the fall of the heavy load on the ground.<br>
The handicap of the conventional Pulley having clamps inserted in the holes provided therein is that in case of breakage of the wire rope, the Pulley would rotate upside down and the whole load would concentrate at the remaining end of the wire rope at the clamps and this damages the Pulley thereby adversely effecting its proper and efficient functioning and also its working life.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a new type of Pulley designated as Double Suspension Pulley which obviates the drawbacks of the conventional Pulley as stated above.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a Double Suspension Pulley which is more efficient in operation, has longer working life and is safe to handle as compared to the conventioal Pulley.<br>
Accordingly  the present invention provides a  Double  Suspension Pulley which consists of a Pulley having two grooves placed  side by  side,  the  first groove is for load wire  rope,  the  second groove is for an idle wire rope, the middle portions of the  load wire rope and the idle wire rope are clamped by a U-shaped clamp, one  end  of the load wire rope is tied to the heavy load  to  be lifted while its  other end is  tied to a manually  operatable drum to lift the  heavy load  and  the  ends of the  idle  wire rope are rigidly held by holders.<br>
Although the ends of the idle wire rope are rigidly held by the holders, but in between, the idle wire rope is kept loose for proper functioning of the Double Suspension Pulley.<br>
In case, the load wire rope breakes when the Double Suspension Pulley is engaged in lifting heavy loads, the Pulley will not turn upside down as in the case of a conventional Pulley but will be stopped by the idle wire rope.<br>
In addition, a tilt level indicator is also mounted on the Double Suspension Pulley to indicate the precise tilt of the Pulley. The tilt can be corrected to put the Pulley in its proper position by opening the clamp holding the load wire rope and the idle wire<br><br>
rope and re-setting the load wire rope.<br>
In the Double Suspension Pulley, three bearings are provided instead of two bearings as provided in the conventional Pulley.<br>
The depth of the grooves in the Double Suspension Pulley is less as compared to the depth of the groove in the conventional Pulley as the Double Suspension Pulley works under static condition.<br>
The Double Suspension Pulley according to the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein<br>
Figure  1   shows the front view of the conventional Pulley.<br>
Figure  2   shows a sectional view of the conventional Pulley. Figure  3   shows the front view of the Double Suspension Pulley<br>
according to the present invention. Figures 4a and 4b  show the sectional views of the Double<br>
Suspension Pulley. Figure  5   shows  the  sectional  front  view  of  the  Double<br>
Suspension Pulley having mounted thereon the load<br>
wire rope and the idle wire rope. Figure  6  shows the Double Suspension Pulley while in operation.<br>
As  shown in Figures 1 and 2, the conventional Pulley has  groove (D)  in which the load wire rope (not shown) is mounted. One  end of the load wire rope is tied to the heavy load being lifted while the other  end of the load wire rope is  pulled manually to lift the heavy load.<br><br>
As shown in Figures 3, 4a, 4b and 5, the Double Suspension Pulley (1) has two grooves (2,3). Through groove (2) passes the load wire rope(4) while through groove(3) passes the idle wire rope(5). The U-shaped clamp(6) has a cover(7) which is adapted to be fixed thereon by means of a pair of nuts and bolts (8) to cover the load wire rope and the idle wire rope. A stud (9) is also mounted on the Double Suspension Pulley on which stud is installed a tilt indicator (10),<br>
Figure   6  shows the Double Suspension Pulley in operation.  The middle portions of the load wire rope(4)  and  the idle wire rope (5) passing through their respective grooves (2,3) in the  Double Suspension  Pulley are clamped by a clamp (11). The ends  of  the idle wire rope are securely held by holders (12). One end of the load wire rope is tied to the heavy load (L) to be lifted while its otherend is tied to a manually operatable drum (14). In case, load wire rope breaks  while lifting the heavy load (L), the Double Suspension Pulley will not turn upsidedown as it would be stopped doing so by the idle wire rope.<br>
The Double Suspension Pulley has the following distinct advantages over the conventional Pulley   :<br>
1.	The Double Suspension Pulley remains nearly stationary. It<br>
bears the same load as other conventional pulleys but the<br>
load on its bearings is of 'static  nature.<br>
2.	The 'turning compulsion' in this Pulley is much less than<br>
in the conventional pulley.<br><br>
3.   In case, the load wire rope breaks while lifting  the load, the Pulley will not turn upside down because of the presence of the idle wire rope.<br>
Since many apparently different embodiments of the present invention could be made without departing from the scope and spirit thereof, it is intended that the description of the invention herein be interpretted as being illustrative only and not limiting in any manner.<br><br><br><br>
I  CLAIM<br>
1.	A Double Suspension Pulley which consists of a Pulley having<br>
two grooves placed side by side, the first groove is for the<br>
load wire rope,  the second groove is for an idle wire rope,<br>
the middle portions of the load wire rope and the idle wire<br>
rope  are clamped by means of a U-shaped clamp, one  end  of<br>
the  load wire rope is tied to the heavy load to be  lifted<br>
while its other end is tied to a manually  operatable  drum<br>
to lift the  heavy load  and the  ends  of  idle  wire  rope<br>
are rigidly held by holders.<br>
2.	The Double Suspension Pulley as claimed in Claim 1  wherein<br>
while  ends  of  the idle wire rope are rigidly held by the<br>
holders, the idle wire rope in between is kept loose.<br>
3.	The Double Suspension Pulley as claimed in Claims 1	and 2<br>
wherein  a  tilt level indicator is mounted on the	Double<br>
Suspension Pulley to indicate the precise tilt of the	Pulley.<br>
4.	The  Double Suspension Pulley as claimed in Claims 1	to  3<br>
wherein three Bearings are provided in the Pulley.<br>
5.	The  Double  Suspension Pulley  substantially  as  herein<br>
described and illustrated in the drawings.<br><br></td>
