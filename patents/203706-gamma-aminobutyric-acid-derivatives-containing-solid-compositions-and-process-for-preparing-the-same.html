COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC   ACID   DERIVATIVES   CONTAINING,    SOLID COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME"<br>
WARNER-LAMBERT COMPANY, a Delaware Corporation, of   201 Tabor Road, Morris Plains, New Jersey 07950, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the. manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID DERIVATIVES CONTAINING, SOLID COMPOSITIONS AND<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a stabilised solid composition comprising a 4-ainino-3-substitutec-butanoic acid derivative and a process for the preparation cf the same.<br>
Also, this invention relates to a solid pharmaceutical preparation of the 4-aminc-3-surstituced-butanoic acid derivative comprising the stabilize soiid composition and a process for the preparation of the same.<br>
More particularly, the invention is concerned with a stabilized solid pharmaceutical preparation of the 4-ammo-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative, including gabapentin, pregabelm, baclofen, 3-aminc-ethyi-4-cyciohexyl-butar.oic acid, 3-aminomethyI-S-cycichexyi pentanoic tela,  2 - aminomethyl - 4 -phenyl-but = r.oic dCio or 3-aminomechy 1 - 5-phenyi-pentancic acid/ in tne dosage forms of tablets, powders, granules and capsules, c.5  well as a process for the preparation of Che same.<br>
BACKGROUND 0f THE INVENTION I - (Aminomethyl) cyclohexaneacenc acid, one of the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid, derivatives, having the<br><br>
rollowmg   structural    formula   is   disclosed   in   U.S.    Patent Nos.    1,024,175   and   4,087,544   and   has   been   called "gabapent^n",    a   generic   name,    due   to   its   structural   relation to   y-aminobutyric   acid   (GABA)-<br>
H.N-CH,	CH2-C00H<br>
Gabapentin easily passes across the brain carrier.  Owing to this, ths compound is used as a medicine for the treatment of certain cerebral diseases such as certain, forms cf epilepsy, faint and hypokinesia as well as cranial traumas, and also for improving the cerebral functions in senile pat:ents .<br>
Moreover, U.S. Patent No. 5,084,47° discloses that qabapentm is ubed for the treatment of neuroasgenerative disorders sue.- es Al zr.eimer ' 5 disease, Hur. - :r. ;:cr.' s c.-.orea or Parkinson's disease ana amyotrophic iacera_ sclerosis. 'J. S  Patent No. 5,025,035 discloses that gabapencin _s used for the treatment of depression.  U.S. Patent No. 5,tl0,38l discloses that trus compound is used for ine treatment of mania and bipolar disorder   Furthermore, this compound, having an analgesic activity, is expected zo  be used as analgesics.  Under these circumstances, there has been a<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
greatly increased utility of gabapentm as the cherapeutic agents Cor chose diseases or disorders or conditions as recited above, m addition to cerebral diseases such as epilepsy ana the like.<br>
As staced above, gabapentin is a very effeccive drug for cerebral diseases such as epilepsy and the like, and it has an extremely low toxicity.  However, in order to maintain Che effect as expected, it has been administered to adults usually at a single daily dose of 900 - 1800 ng or in some cases a daily dose of up to 2400 rag in three divided doses .  Thus, a single dose will be in the range of 300 - 60C mg or in some cases up to 800 mg.<br>
Farther, gabapentin has difficulties m that it is a drug having a scrongly bitter taste and also a very poor fluidity ar.d that an extremely high dosage should be required for administration in the dosage corrr. of powders. Since gaoaosncin is very difficult to formulate because or it instability, gabapentin capsules now available m the oversea markets are those manufactured by a simple dry blending of gaDapantin with necessary auxiliaries and 5ut)5equenr. encapsulating into hard capsules.<br>
However, a single dose is as high as 300 - 600 mc or in some cases up to 800 mg as stated above,   which<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
necessitates large-sited capsuies; for example, Capsule No. 0 snould be applied to capsules having a content of 400 mg par capsule.  Consequently, ingesting such capsules is difficult =ven for adults, much more for children.  Although gabapentm capsules have already been marketed, it is still mai spensao.e to attempt any improvement in compliance and easy administration of gabapentin, and a demand for a smaller-sized pharmaceutical preparation of gabapentin exists in the clinical field.<br>
Gabapentin itself is a powdery material having very poor compression-moldability and fluidity.  Compression molding or granulation has been usually employed for small-sizing or fluidizing of the drug having such powder properties and the molding properties should be improved wit the aid of pharmaceutical auxiliaries.  However, many of the auxiliaries to be applied for compression noldmg tend to react Jiir. raoapentir. witn lapse cf time t = form -5-cyciohaxylpyrroiiccne (the corresponding lactam, form) by accelerating the dehydration reaction between the amino group and tne zarboxyl group within the rr.clacule of gabapentir. .  This dehydration reaction would be :ar more accelerated as the gabapentin powder is oemg rr.ore tightly compressed.  Moreover, tne reaction oetween gabapentin and<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
such auxiliaries with lapse of time would be further accelerarec by the use of water or ^n  organic solvent in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
It has been standardized in commercially available gabapervtin capsules that an dllowable content of the lactam up to the beyond-use date should be no more than 1-0% in view of safety.  Accordingly, it is necessary in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation of gabapentm to prevent the formation of the lactam by retarding the Rehydration reaction oerween the amino group and the carboxyl group within the molecule of gabapentin. On   the other hand, there has been a demand for a small-sired dosage form for easier ingesting is discussed above.  Under such circumstances, there have been attempted over years various methods. However, none of these attempts has succeeded either because a large-sized dosage form resulted due zz   =    Urge amount of the auxiliaries used ur because an increased amount of the lactam formed or both of them.<br>
Such instability as encountered m manufacturing a gabapentir. preparation has been also observed in other 4-amino-3-suostituted-butanoic acid derivatives which are structurally analogous to gabapentm and have a structurally<br><br>
o<br>
bulky substituent at: the 3-position thereof similarly 10 gabapentin.<br>
For example, 4-amino- 3-p-chloropnenyl) butanoic acid, which is represented by the following structural formula and called "baclofen" in a generic nane,<br>
CI<br><br>
I H?N-H,C-CH-CK2-COOH<br>
and 5-methyl-3-aminoroethyl-hexanoic acid, which is represented by the following structural formula and called "pregabalm" in a generic name,<br>
CH,-CH(CH.) 3<br>
I " H,N-H,C-CH-CH,-COOH<br>
are also a drug which has very poor compress ion-nolcability and fluidity like gabapentm.  Compression molding or granulation used for small-sizing or fluidizir.g -he crug snouid oe improved with the aid cf pharmaceutical auxiliaries.  However, many of the auxiliaries to be applied to compression molding tend to react with gaoapentm with lapse of time to form 4-cyclohexylpyrrolidone (the<br><br>
corresponding lactam form) by accelerating the dehydration reaction between the amino group and the carooxyl group within the molecule of the compound.  This dehydration reaction would be far more accelerated as the compound 15 beir.g more tiqhtly compressed and would be further accelerazea by the use of water or an organic solvent in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation, as is the case of gabapentin.  It may be said that the mechanism of degradation by the autocondensation is peculiar to the 4-ammo-3-suDStltuted-butanoic acid derivatives having a structurally bulky substituent at the 3-position thereof.<br>
To the contrary, in Y-aminobutyric =cid derivatives having no or a less bulky substituent at the 3-position thereof, such as v-aminobutyric acid or 4-amino-3-hydroxy-butanoic acid, the dehydration reaction is not brought about even when maintained in a driec state such as at a temperature of 105°C over 2-3 hours, and the rormaticn of 1-cyclohexylpyrrol J done (the corresponcir.g lactam form) 15 not observed^  In other words, in the 4-ammo-2-subst ltuted-butanoic acid derivative wherein tne sucst::uent at the 3-posicion -hereof has a bulky structure, the dehydration reaction could easily be brought about between the amino group and the carboxyl group within the molecule.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
In view of the aforesaid background, for drugs which are 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivatives, including gabapentin, having a structurally bulky subatituent at the 3-position thereof, there have been desired 5      a new pharmaceutical preparation containing said drugs which may be small-sized or fluidiz.ed in a dosage form such as tablets or granules and may have a comparable storage stability to commercially available, pharmaceutical preparations including commercially available gabapentin 10      capsules, and a process for manufacturing the same.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION we have made earnest studies to solve the prior art problems as stated above and, as a result, have now<br>
15      found that the degradation of 4-amino-3-suDstituted-butanoic acid derivatives including gabapentin owing to the lactam formation ouring the formulation anc storage can be prevented by blocking the evaporation and movement of a very small amout of residual water in a solid composition containing<br>
20      the 4-amino-3-suos ti tuted-butanoi-c acid cerivative<br>
manufactured, irrespective of formulation methods employed, that it is effective to add a humectant as a stabilizer against degradation and that a solid composition containing<br><br>
-    9    -<br>
the   4-amir.o-3-substituted-butanoic   acid   derivative stabilized  by   said  humectant   and   a   solid  pharmaceutical preparation   using   said   composition   such   as   tablets,    granules or   tne   like   have   an   excellent   storage   stability,    en   the basis   cf   wnich   this   invention   has   been   completed.<br>

The present invention provides an extremely effective stabilizing means in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation containing a 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative having a bulky substituent at the 3-position thereof as explained above, and the means of the invention is extremely effective m preparing a pharmaceutical preparation of, for example, gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen, 3-arainoinethyl-4-cyclohexy 1-outanoic acid, 3-arainomethyl-S-cyclohexyl-pentanoic acid, 3-aminojnethyl-4-phenyl-butanoic acid, 3-aromomethyl-5-phenyl-pentanoic acid, etc.<br>
The humectant which may be employed in the invention in combination with a 4 -amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative is selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, sorbitol and glycerol and an aliphatic acid ester thereof, alone or :.-. any combination of two or r.or? thereof.<br>
Illustrative examples of the glycerol aliphatic acid esters may include glycerol lower aliphatic acid esters sucn as rr.onoacetylg1yceride, diacety 1 gl ycende, tr lacetylql yceride (triacetin), middle chair, aliphatic ac:c nonoglyceride such as monohexanoylglycende, monooctanoy1g1yceride, monodecanoyiglyceride, and middle<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
chain aliphacic acid polyglycerol ester such as monolauric acid polygiyceride or monomyristic acid poiygiyceride and the like.<br>
The solid pharmaceutical preparation of the present invention can be obtained in a 'JSual cosaqe form, typically, in the dosage form of powders, granules, surface-coated granules, capsules, tablets or surface-coated tablecs by conducting in turn the granulation step in which a humectant as   a stabilizer and, if necessary, an auxiliary agent for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation are added to bulk powders of a 4-araino-3-substituted-butsnoic acid derivative, such as gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen and the like and the resulting mixture is granulated by means of a granulator, the encapsulation step in which the resulting granular powders are encapsulated under compression by means of a capsule filler or the cabletinq step ;r. wr.ich the resulting granular powders arc compressed by means of a tablet machine and, if necessary, the coating step in which the granular powders, tablets or granules obtained in the preceding steps are surface-coated.<br>
The granulation of the 4-araino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative during the process for manufacturing pharmaceutical preparations as stated above<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
such as gaoapentin may be conducted by any granulation method well-known per se, for example, a fluidized granulation method, a high speed stirring granulation method, a melting granulation method and the like.  In order to effectively adhere a stabilizer to bulk: powders of the 4-ammo-3-suostituted-butanoic acid derivative, there may be preferably employed a fluidized granulation method an which bulk powders of the said compound are fluidized and then a stabilizer is sprayed onto the fluidized powders.  In this fluidized granulation step, a stabilizer is added in the form of its solution dissolved in water or an organic solvent such as alcohols or the like, whereby a small amount of the stabilizer may be sufficient for uniformly adhering to the surface of bulk powders or the 4-aiPino-3-subsituted butanoic acid derivative.<br>
In the granulation step using said fluidized granulation method, granulation may be carried out by adding to bulk powders of the 4-amino-3-substiuted-butanoic acid derivative -he stabilizer solution as described above and, if necessary, a binder such as corn starch, a cellulose derivative (e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose), polyvinyl alcohol, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (e.g., Kollidon-K30 or<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
Kollidon-K25) , a copolyvidone (e.g., Kollidon-VA64) and the like in the form of a solution or suspension thereof.<br>
The aforementioned stabilizer solution may be applied to bulk powders of "he 4-amino-3-substituced-butanoic acid derivative prior to the granulation using the binder or other auxiliaries for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation.  In this granulation step, there may be also incorporated, if necessary, a sweetening agent such as mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol or the like and other auxiliaries for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
The granular powders thus obtained may be used as a pharmaceutical preparation of the 4-amino-3-5ub5tituted-butanoic acid derivative as such, or they may be also encapsulated under compression for capsules containing the 4-amino-3-5ubstituted-butanoic acid derivative.  Also, they may be further compressed to tablets -<br>
More specifically, the granular powders of the 4-amino-3-suostituted-butanoic acid derivative obtained as described above can be compression-molded to tablets by means of a tablet machine.  It is essentia.) in this compress ion-molding step to use a lubricant as ordinarily done for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical preparation. However, it has been discovered that some conventional<br><br>
- 45 -<br>
lubricans employed in a compression-molding step for drugs ma influence on a stability with lapse of time of the pharmaceutical preparations of the 4-ammo-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative and further bring about a delayed dissolution of the drugs, so that these lubricants are not preferable in some cases.<br>
However, we have also found out that a certain neutral amino acid, uhich have hardly been used as a lubricant in compressing drugs, such as L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valme, D-leucme/ D-isoleucine, D-valine, DL-leucine, DL-isoleucme or DL-valine or a mixture thereof can exert a remarkable effect as a lubricant for compression-molding into tablets of the present derivative such as gabapentin and that in the tablets thus prepared, there has been no adverse influence on both the stability with lapse of time and dissolution property provided by the present stabilizer.<br>
Thus, in this compression-molding step, the resulting granules may be usually blended with I.-leucine, L-lsoleucme, L-valine, D-leucine, D-isoleucine, D-valme, DL-leucine, DL-isoleucine, DL-valine or a mixture thereof as a lubricant and, if necessary, an auxiliary for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation, for example, a binder or a<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
disintegrator such as a cellulose derivative (e.g.. hydroxypropylcellulose) , crystalline cellulose, corn starch, partially gelatinized starch, lactose or the like or other conventional auxiliaries by means of a suitable mixer such as a dry mixer, eg-, a v-blender or the like and then the resulting mixture is compression-molded to tablets by means of a suitable tablet machine.<br>
The granular powders, granules or tablets thus obtained may be surface-coated, if necessary.  The surface-coating step for tablets is not essential and may be an optional step.  For example, in case or gabapentin having a strongly bitter taste, it may be desirable to surface-coat gabapentin tablets for easier ingestion.  In the surface-coating step, there may be used as a film-forming material a polymeric base ingredient such as a cellulose derivative, e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), bydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose (HPMC), etc., a polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Kollidon-VA64, Eudragits, etc., and as a sweetening agent mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, aspartame and the like.<br>
To such a film-forming material, there may be further added, if necessary, a huroectant such as propylene glycol, glycerol, triacetin or the like and a neutral amino acid such as L-leucine, L-isoleucine, I,-valine, L-alanine,<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
D-leucine, D-isoieucine, D-valine, D-alanme, DL-leucine, DL-isoleucine, DL-valine, DL-alanine or glycine.  Among thos compounds, propylene glycol, glycerol and triacetin may exhibit not only an activity as a humectant but also an activity es a plasticizer for a coating film, while L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valnine, D-leucine, D-isoleucine, D-valine, DL-leucine, DL-isoleucine and DL-valine may exhibit an activity as a modifier for a coating film.  Moreover, when the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative is gabapentin, glycine, L-alanine, D-alaruns and DL-alanine may exhibit ar. activity as a buffering agent against bitter taste of gabapentin.  The surface-coating of the granular powders, granules or tablets may be applied to the surface of the granular powders, granules or tablets according to a well-known method using a   fluidized bed cr a rotary pan.<br>
In a solid composition containing the 1-araino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative according to this invention, the humectant may be used in a total amount of 0.01 - 256 by weight relative to the 4-anino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative, or in an amount of 0.01 - 25% by weight relative to the total amount of the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative and the auxiliary agent when added for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation.<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
The tocal amount Co be used may be varied depending upon th sort of the humectant to be used, the specific dosage form of the solid composition containing Che 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative, in other words, tablets, ponders, granules or capsules, and also the sort and amount of an auxiliary to be added.  The humectant should be used, in any case, in an effective amount to stabilize the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivativ by ensuring a water retention of the pharmaceutical preparation.  And, in many cases, a total amount of the humectant may be preferably in the range of 0.02 - 20% by weight relative to the 4-amino~3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative, or it may preferably be in the range of 0.02 -20% by weight relative to the total amount of the 4-ammo-3 substituted-butanoic acid derivative and an auxiliary agent when added for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation. However, whan sorbitol is used together with other humectancs, the amount to be used is not limited to the ran as mentioned above.<br>
In preparing surface-coated tablets of Che 4-amino-3-sufcstituted-bucanoic acid derivative, the amount of the humeccant to be used in the surface-coating step may be<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
usually in the range of 0.1 - 50% by weight relative to the total amount of the coating materials.<br>
Moreover, we have also found out that in preparing a solid pharmaceutical preparation of the 4-ammo-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative, use of a certain neutral amino acid including L-leucme, L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-alanine, D-leucine, D-isoleucine. D-valine, D-alanine, DL-leucine, DL~isoleucine, DL-valine, DL-alanine and glycine/ instead of the auxiliary agent commonly used Tor manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation, can bring about the desired pharmaceutical preparation without any prevention of the water retention effect of a humectant as a stabilizer of this invention.  In other words, the said neutral amino acid may exhibit an activity as auxiliaries fo stabilization.  The said neutral amino acid may be used alone or m combination of two or more thereof.  The said neutral amino acid may be blended in any optional step for the preparation of a pharmaceutical preparation of the 4-ammo-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative including the granulation step.  A total amount of the said neutral amino acid to be used, for example, in a gabapentm solid preparation is in the range of 0.05 - 40% by weight relative tc gabapentin.<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
The process for preparing 2 solid preparation of t 4-amino-3-substltuted-butanoic acid derivative according to the invention as explained above comprises, for example, the granulation step in which a   humectant, that 15, a stabilise:, a binder and an auxiliary agent for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation are added to bulk powders of the said compound and then the resulting mixture is granulated by means of a granulator, the step for tableing in which additives such as a lubricant are added to the resulting granular powders and then the granules are compressed by means of a tableting machine and, if necessary, the coating step in which the surface of tablets obtained is coated.  However, the granular powders as prepared by the granulation step may be applied as such in the dosage form of powders or granules as a pharmaceutical preparation of the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative without conducting the tableting step, or the granules as prepared by the granulation step may be further subjected to the surface-coating step as described above. Alternatively, the granules as prepared by the granulation step may be admixed with a lubricant or the like and the resulting mixture may be filled into gelatin hard capsules by means o: a capsule filler to prepare capsules.  In the<br><br>

It has been believed that an excess water remaining generally in solid preparations including a preparation of the 4-amino-3~substituted-butanoic acid derivative would be undesirable since it may cause discoloration, degradation, tableting troubles or the like. It is the most significant feature of this invention that, unexpectedly, a stability of a solid preparation of the 4-ammo-3-substituted-butancic acid derivative can be remarkably improved by the addition of a humectant which has a water retention activity and has been considered to trigge unfavorable disturbances in the said preparation as stated above.  Thus, the present invention has now provided a means for stabilizing pharmaceutical^ unstable 4-amino~3~ substituted-butanoic acid derivatives including gabapentin, and further elucidated the principle of this stabilization, which have been regarded as the problems to be solved in the art over many years.  A significant effect of this invention is that the wet granulation method using water, which has been widely utilized for a small-sized pharmaceutical preparation to be easily taken by patients, can be applied to gabapentin having an   extremely poor moldability without causing any degradation of gabapentin.
