				<td>ABSTRACT According to the invention the cyber space can be partitioned into six neuto, work Domains for health-net operation by personal computations. All these computations can be clustere to get operated unde the &#x27;Nero workstation Domains&#x27; and cure connected by operate website, which are named as &#x27;Health net sites&#x27;. These amains arei Govern nearo-workstate demain, 2) consultal nearo workstation domain, 3) investing neri workstation domain, 4) Care neoro workstation do 5) legulation neuro workstation domain, 6) Management neuro workstation domain. These damains are also applicable for other applications or systems of human society which are bored an personal computation. In this model, each individual must be provided with an unique. Sinary code for data identification. This code is a global coustant and it a processed by the identification page of an individual in their pesonal computer for threading their distributed date.</td>

Description of Computation principle derived for this system:<br>
In real world computations, the processors are clustered, as 'actor* centric and these 'actors' are the vectors for the transactions with other clusters. Each actor is a cluster of processors, which does memory processing and routing processing. Hence a chaotic activity is observed in the real world activities.<br>
In this regard, there are 3 type of processing, which altogether performs dynamic instruction processing. An impact of an event triggers chaotic transactions by these processors and a duster computation is resolves for the storage of Dynamic Instructions. The processors involved in this system Ire:<br>
1.	Processors for Events interactions:<br>
These processors are to process the interaction of Events and they intern processed by 'Actor Processors'.<br>
2.	Processors for Actors:<br>
These are multi-layered processors to process both the 'Events Processors' and 'Instruction Processors'. Hence these processors perform Middle Ware activity between 'Events Processors' and 'Instruction Processors'.<br>
3.	Processors for Instructions:<br>
These processors are to process, 'Dynamic Instructions' and they intern processed by 'Actor Processors'.<br>
Architecture of this System:<br>
Using these concepts, this model got evolved to network and to compute all distributed personal computations for health. The system described in this model is a distributed Web application for Cyberspace, on lnternet-3 infrastructure for executing Health Care Automation, by loosely coupled realÂ¬time data transactions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
As per this system, all personal computations for Health, are clustered to execute transactions in cyberspace. Hence, each personal computer should be assigned to execute either any one or more of the following three client/server tasks:<br>
1. The personal computers must maintain the 'Health Care Fl'e Cabin' of the users, in it<br>
The 'Visiting Pads' of 'Health Care file Cabin' in the personal computers, interacts with the 'Healthnet Sites', constituted by other personal computers to transact the health data of the user. Hence the health care file of the user is maintained and updated in their personal computers.<br>
These Visiting Pads are grouped into 6 clusters, and they are:<br>

As per this system, the Cyberspace can be partitioned into six Neuro-workstation Domains for Health-net operations by personal computations. All personal computations for the system, can be clustered to get operated under 6 'Neuro-workstation Domains' and these enterprise computations are connected by corporate web sites, which are named as 'Heaithnet Sites'. These neuro-workstation domains for personal computations are named as:<br>
Govern neuro-workstation Domain<br>
Consultation neuro-workstation Domain<br>
Investigation neuro-workstation Domain<br>
Care neuro-workstation Domain<br>
Regulation neuro-workstation Domain<br>
Management neuro-workstation Domain<br>
These 'Neuro-workstation Domains' are also applicable for other applications or systems of human society, which are based on personal computations.<br>
In this model, eacti individual must be provided with an unique binary code for their data identification. This code is a global constant and it is processed by the identification page of an individual in their personal computer for threading their distributed data. The binary code for the Identification of the user for this system, can be generated either by the genetic code of the user or by the combination of other identification parameters of the users such as; the Photo Identity, Infra-red Photo Identity, Finger Print, Signature, Blood Group, Hair Color, Irish Color, Number of Whorls in the Head and the Sex.<br>
Construction of the System:<br>
This system can be constructed as two layers in the personal computers:<br>
1. Construction of an Application Platform of the system<br>
The application platform of this system is to interface the user with this system through the 'BIOS Pages' and the 'Desktop Pages' of personal computers, to interact and to navigate in the Cyberspace. Hence this platform is providing 'Visiting Pads' and 'Resource Allocation Pads for the users. Also, the platform provides 'Guest Port' and 'Host Port' in the personal computers, to login for man-machine-machine-man interactions. The pads in the 'Application platform' of the system, provides sockets for the components to execute 'Object Oriented Tasks' for the system.<br><br>
Â» <br><br>
2.  Construction of Components of the system<br>
To handle the events of this system, in concern with man-machine interactions, man-machine-man interactions and machine-man-machine interactions of this system are clustered to exectrte 'Obiect Oriented Tasks' for the system and the components for these tasks, are constructed by interconnected pages. These components can be installable individually by the users as per their involvement for this system.<br><br><br>
The Pages for these components for 'Object Oriented Tasks' are grouped into three:<br>
1.	Man-Machine Interactive Pages:<br>
These Pages are assigned for Man-Machine Interactions with Personal Corrjputers and these pages are mainly instruction pages for the system.<br>
2.	M an-Machine-M an Interactive Pages:<br>
These Pages are assigned for Man-Machine-Man Interactions with Personal Computers and these pages are mainly concerned with transactions between users and events.<br>
3.	Machine-Man-Machine Interactive Pages:<br>
These Pages are assigned for Machine-Man-Machine interactions with Personal Computers in integration with other equipment. These pages are the actor pages between the Personal Computers and other equipment concern with this system.<br>
1 claim here by, that this method for Global Health Care Automation and the topology for Cluster computations, used for this method are new Innovations.<br>
Any commercialization of this method or topology or a part of this, needs written permission from me or from my Legal Representative.<br><br></td>
