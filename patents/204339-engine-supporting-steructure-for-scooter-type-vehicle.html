[See Section 10]	<br><br>
"ENGINE SUPPORTING STRUCTURE FOR SCOOTER-TYPE VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a scooter-type vehicle in which a carburetor and an engine connected to the carburetor are disposed under a seat, and a pair of right and left links for connecting a body frame to a pair of right and left engine side brackets provided on the engine are connected to each other by means of a cross-member, and particularly to an improvement in a structure for supporting the engine to the body frame.<br>
ffrtror]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
The scooter-type vehicle of this type has been known, for example, from Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 3-213482. U30Q3J<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The above-described prior art scooter-type vehicle is configured such that a carburetor is disposed in front of both links and a cross-member is disposed behind the links in such a manner as to extend upwardly.  Accordingly, the carburetor must be disposed in a limited space between the links and the engine, with a result that the degree of freedom in arrangement of the carburetor<br>
2<br><br>
becomes   small.<br>
frfl 0 0 a ■}<br>
In view of the foregoing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide an engine supporting structure for a scooter-type vehicle, which is capable of increasing the degree of freedom in arrangement of a carburetor.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided an engine supporting structure for a scooter-type vehicle in which a carburetor and an engine connected to the carburetor are disposed under a seat, and a pair of right and left links for connecting a body frame to a pair of right and left engine side brackets provided on the engine are connected to each other by means of a cross-member, characterized in that the cross-member is formed into an approximately U-shape opened downwardly; and the cross-member is disposed astride, on the front side from the links, an intake pipe for connecting the engine to the carburetor disposed behind the links.  <br>
With this configuration, since the carburetor is disposed behind both the links and the cross-member is<br>
3<br><br>
disposed astride, on th-e front side from both the links, the intake pipe for connecting the carburetor to the engine, it is possible to make the degree of freedom in arrangement of the carburetor higher than that in the prior art structure in which the carburetor is disposed in front of the links.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, in addition to the configuration of the invention described in claim 1, the engine is configured as a four-cycle engine disposed substantially in the horizontal direction, and the cross-member is disposed between the engine and a luggage box mounted to the body frame at a position under the seat.  With this configuration, it is possible to eliminate an inconvenience of causing the position of the seat being a relatively higher fqjr allowing the cross-member to be freely moved with no interference with the luggage box.<br>
 4 <br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a engine supporting structure for a scooter-type vehicle in which a carburetor and an engine (E) connected to said carburetor are disposed under a seat, and a pair of right and left links for connecting a body frame (F) to a pair of right and left engine side brackets provided on said engine (E) are connected to each other by means of a cross-member, characterized in that:<br>
said cross-member is formed into an approximately U-shape opened downwardly; and<br>
said cross-member is disposed astride, on the front side from<br>
said links, an intake pipe for connecting said engine (E) to said carburetor<br>
disposed behind said links	'.—	—__—____<br><br>

The function of this embodiment will be described below.  The body frame F of the scooter-type vehicle is formed by fastening the front frame 23, rear frame 24, and sub-frame 22 to each other.  At least one of the frames 23, 24 and 22 is formed by casting (the front frame 23 and rear frame 24 are formed by casting in this embodiment).  Accordingly, by commonly using either the front frame 23 or the rear.frame 24 to various kinds of motorcycles different in part of the body frames, it is possible to reduce the design and manufacturing costs of the body frame required for change in kind of the motorcycle.  Further, since it is possible to modularize the frames 23, 24 and 22 and perform the assembly of parts for each of the frames 23, 24 and 22, and hence to manufacture a scooter-type motorcycle by assembling the three modules having been sub-assembled to each other,<br><br>
and hence to improve the assembling efficiency in the process of manufacturing the scooter-type motorcycle.<br>
The front frame 23 including the head pipe 25, down frame 26, and floor supporting frames 272 and 271   is integrally formed by casting; the rear frame 24 formed by casting are fastened to the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27j,- and the sub-frame 22 formed by welding the metal pipes is fastened to the rear end of the rear frame 24.  Accordingly, the sub-frame 22 relatively low in design and manufacturing costs is allowed to easily keep up with the change in any kind of the motorcycle by changing the metal pipes to be welded. [0QB9]<br>
The rear frame 24 is fastened to the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 21 x   of the front frame 23 by overlapping and fastening the rear fastening plates 612 and 61, provided at the branched front ends of the rear frame 24 to the front fastening plates 562 and 56x provided at the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27,  Each of the front fastening plates 562 and 56, and the rear fastening plates 612 and 61, is, as shown in Fig. 24(a), formed into a shape tilted forwardly, downwardly.  Accordingly, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the fastening planes of the fastening plates<br><br>
562, 561  612 and 61x to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 24(b), the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 56, 61, and 61, are disposed at positions relatively close to the head pipe 25.  With this configuration, as shown in Fig. 24(b), even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear fastening plates 612 and 61x on the rear frame 24 side to the front fastening plates 562 and 56, on the front frame 23 side and thereby the position of the head pipe 25 is tilted from the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction.  Thus, it is possible to make relatively small displacement amounts §1 and 52   of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction, and hence to improve the positioning accuracy of the front wheel WF and the rear wheel WR to the vehicular body. [-OT6-0]<br>
Further, the extension line L of the axial line of at least one the pairs of bolts 64 for fastening the front fastening plates 562 and 56, to the rear fastening plates 612 and 61, (the extension lines L of the axial lines of the pair of bolts 64 in this embodiment) is set to pass through the space between the upper end of the steering handlebar 32 supported by the head pipe 25 and the axle 31 of the front wheel WF, so that the above<br><br>
fastening planes are disposed at positions closer to the head pipe 25. As a result, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23, it is possible to make small the displacement amounts 5 1 and 52 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction. frftftfH].<br>
On the contrary, if the fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 are not tilted forwardly, downwardly as shown in Fig. 25(a), but extend substantially in the horizontal direction, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the above fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 25 (b) , the fastening planes are disposed at positions relatively apart from the head pipe 25.  As a result, when there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23, the displacement amounts 
Since the rear fastening plates 612 and 61, are<br><br><br><br>
34<br><br>
overlapped from below to the front fastening plates 562 and 56, a space for disposing the rear frame 24 over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27x is not required to be ensured.  As a result, it is possible to allow the step floor 41b to extend up to a position over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27, and hence to make large the space of the step floor 41b.<br>
Since the fitting recesses 58 are provided in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27x and the fitting projections 63 to be fitted in the fitting recesses 58 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to improve the assembling accuracy in fastening and assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23. [■ftfrW]<br>
Further, since three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting recesses 58 are formed in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27j and three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting projections 63 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to further improve the accuracy in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23.<br>
35<br><br>
[0065]<br>
Since the down frame 26 of the front frame 23 is formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, downwardly, the front wheel WF is allowed to be closer to the down frame 26 without reducing the cross - sectional shape of the down frame 26.  Accordingly, it is possible to shorten the length of the wheel base while avoiding interference between the front wheel WF and the down frame 26, and sufficiently ensuring the space of the step floor 41b.<br>
Since the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 27x are each formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 27x are deflected in such a manner that the areas of the upper opening portions thereof are changed.  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort. [0067]<br>
Since the ribs 52 extending in the longitudinal direction are provided on the floor supporting frames 272 and 271( when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 27x are allowed to be deflected with their rigidities not reduced so much. [tffifiS^-<br><br><br><br><br>
36<br><br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27, are disposed on both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, the step floor 41b can be disposed in such a manner as to extend up to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, and hence to sufficiently ensure the space of the step floor 41b on the front side without enlarging the wheel base. [•frfrfrS]<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27j are connected to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26 via the pair of curved portions 502 and 50, expanded forwardly from the front surface of the lower end of the down frame 26, the connection portions between the down frame 26 and the floor supporting frames 272 and 21 ,   are expanded forwardly as the curved portions 502 and 50x, although the front ends of the pair of floor supporting frames 272 and 27x extending in line are disposed at the connection portions.  As a result, it is possible to sufficiently increase the strength of the connection portions.<br>
In addition, the front wheel WF can be disposed close to the curved portions 502 and 50x   side while ensuring a gap between the front wheel WF and the curved portions 502 and 50, by providing the recesses 51 on the<br><br>
opposed inner sides of the curved portions 502 and 50, so that it is possible to avoid an inconvenience that the wheel base is enlarged by the fact that the front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27: are connected to the down frame 26 via the curved portions 502 and 50,<br>
With respect to the vibration-proof link 66 for swingably supporting the engine E of the power unit P on the body frame F, the pair of right and left links 682 and 68x are provided for swingably connecting the pair of right and left engine side brackets 672 and 67, provided on the engine E to the body frame F, and the cross-member 69 is provided for connecting the right and left links 682 and 68, to each other.  The cross-member 69 is formed into the approximately U-shape opened downwardly, and is disposed at a position astride the intake pipe 83 for connecting the carburetor 35 disposed behind the links 682 and 68x to the engine E on the front side of the links 682 and 68,  Accordingly, as compared with a structure in which the carburetor 35 is disposed in front of the links 682 and 68lf the degree of freedom in arrangement of the carburetor 35 becomes larger.<br>
Further, since the engine E is a four-cycle engine disposed substantially in the horizontal direction and<br><br>
the cross-member 69 is disposed between the luggage box 39 mounted on the body frame F under the seat 42 and the engine E, it is possible to prevent the position of the seat 42 from becoming higher in the case of ensuring the free motion  of   the  cross-member  69  while  avoiding   the interference with the luggage box 39.<br>
Since the opening portion 87 allowing the cushion side bracket 86 provided at the upper end of the rear cushion unit 33 to pass therethrough is provided in the frame main portion 24a of the rear portion of the main frame 21 of the body frame F; the cushion mounting portion 88 raised upwardly from the frame main portion 24a while crossing the opening portion 87 is mounted on the frame main portion 24a; and the cushion side bracket 86 is mounted on the cushion mounting portion 88, it is possible to set the cushion side bracket 86 at a high position, and hence to make larger the stroke of the rear cushion unit 33 .  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort, [ft©**]<br>
Since the sub-frame 22 constituting the body frame F in co-operation of the main frame 21 is fastened to the main frame 21 at a position near the connection portion between the cushion mounting portion 88 and the frame<br><br>
main portion 24a, it is possible to reinforce the strength of the cushion mounting portion 88 raised from the frame main portion 24a by the sub-frame 22. [0-W5-]<br>
