				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a soil dispersant composition comprising alkoxylated polyalkyleneimines which are compatible with bleach. The alkoxylated polyalkyleneimincs are also useful as hydrophobic soil dispersants which are suitable for use in laundry detergent compositions which comprise a bleaching agent. The alkoxylated polyalkyleneimines are also suitable for use as soil dispersant in bleach containing laundry pre-soaks and bleaching agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Absent a suitable dispersent, hydrophobic (e.g., grime, oil, soot) and hydrophilic (e.g. clay) soil which is removed during the washing step of the. laundry process can re-deposit onto the cleaned fabric. Soil dispersents act by sequestering dirt once it is dissolved or dispersed in the laundry liquor and keeps the suspended soil in the laundry liquor where it can be carried away during the normal rinsing process.<br>
Typically, if bleaching agents are present, especially peroxygen bleaches which are formulated into both liquid and granular laundry detergent compositions, the formulator must consider the instability of a particular soil dispersent toward bleach. Many successful dispersents have polyalkyleneamine or polyalkyleneimine backbones which are susceptible to oxidation at the amine functionalities and potentially to breakdown or fragmentation by bleaching agents which may be present. From another view, the interaction of bleaching agents with these polyalkyleneimine-based dispersents depletes the amount of bleach present therefore affecting the bleaching performance.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for bleach compatible, highly effective hydrophobic soil dispersents. Surprisingly, it has been found that certain higher molecular weight polyalkyleneimines when highly alkoxylated, are compatible with bleach in laundry compositions and additionally provide hydrophobic soil dispersion. It has also been found that it can be beneficial that the alkoxylated dispersants comprise in the alkylene oxide substituant group mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The bleach compatible alkoxylated polyalkyleneimines of the present invention comprise backbones that are typically branched, however, linear backbones are also suitable. In general, the polyamine backbones described herein are modified in such a manner such that each nitrogen of the polyamine chain which has an attached hydrogen<br>
atom has that hydrogen atom replaced with alkyleneoxy unit, for example, an ethyleneoxy unit or propyleneoxy units or mixtures thereof. Polyamines which have undergone the replacement of essentially all hydrogen atoms with an alkyleneoxy unit are herein defined as "modified".<br>
The polyamine backbones of the present invention have the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
said backbones prior to subsequent modification, comprise primary, secondary and tertiary amine nitrogens connected by R "linking" units. The backbones are comprised of essentially three types of units, which may be randomly distributed along the chain. Primary amine units having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which terminate the main backbone and any branching chains, secondary amine units having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and which, after modification, have their hydrogen atom substituted by an alkyleneoxy unit, and tertiary amine units having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which are the branching points of the main and secondary backbone chains. B representing a continuation of the chain structure by branching. The tertiary units have no replaceable hydrogen atom and are therefore not modified by substitution with an alkyleneoxy unit. During the formation of the polyamine backbones cyclization may occur, therefore, an amount of cyclic polyamine can be present in the parent polyalkyleneimine backbone mixture. Each primary and secondary amine unit of the cyclic alkyleneimines undergoes modification by the addition of alkyleneoxy units in the same manner as linear and branched polyalkyleneimines. Cyclic polyalkyleneimines are less preferred.<br>
R is C2-C6 linear alkylene, C3-C6 branched alkylene, and mixtures thereof, preferably ethylene or propylene, which can bel.2-propylene or 1,3-propylene or<br><br>
mixtures thereof, or mixtures of propylene and ethylene. The preferred polyalkyleneimines of the present invention have backbones which comprise the same R unit, for example, all units are ethylene. Most preferred backbone comprises R groups which are all ethylene units.<br>
The polyalkyleneimines of the present invention arc modified by substitution of most, preferably each N-H unit hydrogen with an alkyleneoxy unit having the formula;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is C2-C4 linear alkylene, C3-C4 branched alkylene. and mixtures thereof. preferably ethylene and/ or propylene. which may be 1,2-propylene or 1,3-propylene or mixtures thereof, and it may be preferred that mixtures of ethylene and propylene are present. R- is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, and mixtures thereof, preferably hydrogen or methyl, more preferably hydrogen. It may be preferred for the purpose of the present invention, that the alkyleneoxy unit comprises a mixture of R1 groups, being ethylene or propylene, whereby the ratio of propylene to ethylene R1 groups is preferably from 1:100 to 1:4, more preferably from 1:50 to 1:5, more preferably from 1:15 to 1:7. Thus, it may be preferred that the 80% to, 95% gf the R ' groups is ethylene and 5% to 20% of the JR. ' groups is propylene. It has been found that in particular, dispcrsants of this type, which have one or more propylene R1 groups directly substituted to the N-H-unit, followed by ethylene R! groups are very bleach compatible. The value of the index x is from about 20, preferably from about 25; to about 50, preferably about 40, most preferably x is 30.<br>
The relative number of primary secondary and tertiary amine units in the backbone prior to modification is reflected in the values of theindices m and n. In general, the polyamines of the present invention will have a ratio of primary amine: secondary aminertertiary amine of from about 1:2:1 to about 1:1:1, that is the starting polyamines having the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is an alkylene unit defined herein below, generally have the values of n+1, m, and n in the ratio of from about 1 :2: 1 to about 1:1:1. The preferred molecular weight for the polyamine backbones is from about 2000, preferably from about 2500, more preferably from about 3000 to about 5000. preferably to about 4500, more preferably to about 4000 daltons. most preferably 3000 daltons. The indices m and n will vary depending upon the R moiety which comprises the backbone. For example when R is<br><br>
ethylenc a backbone unit averages about 43 gm and when R is hexylene a backbone unit averages about 99 gm. By way of illustration and not limitation, a polyalkyleneimine backbone having an average molecular weight of about 3000 wherein R is ethylene and the ratio of m to n of about 2:1 has the value of m equal to about 35 and the value of n equal to about 17. In this example secondary amine units comprise about 35 backbone units, tertiary amine units comprise about 17 units and primary amine units comprise about 18 units. Typically, for polyamines having a 1:2:1 ratio, the value for m ranges from about 10, preferably from about 24. more preferably from about 30; to about 70, preferably to about 60, more preferably to about 40; the value for n ranges from about 5. preferably from about 10, more preferably from about 15; to about 35. preferably to about 25  more preferably to about 20.<br>
The polyamines of the present invention can be prepared, for example, by polymerizing ethyleneimine in the presence of a catalyst such as carbon dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, etc. Specific methods for preparing these polyamine backbones are disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,182,306, Ulrich et al., issued December 5, 1939; U.S. Patent 3,033,746, Mayle et al.. issued May 8, 1962; U.S. Patent 2,208,095, Esselmann et al., issued July 16, 1940; U.S. Patent 2.806,839, Crowther, issued September 17, 1957; and U.S. Patent 2.553,696, Wilson, issued May 21, 1951; all herein incorporated by reference.<br>

Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic substrate, then coating said substrate with a hydrophobic coating. Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous<br>
substrate. In use. the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function,<br>
To illustrate this technique in more detail, a porous hydrophobic silica (trademark SIPERNAT D10, DeGussa) is admixed with a proteolytic enzyme solution containing 3%-5% of C13.15 ethoxylated alcohol (EO 7) nonionic surfactant. Typically, the enzyme/surfactant solution is 2.5 X the weight of silica. The resulting powder is dispersed with stirring in silicone oil (various silicone oil viscosities in the range of 500-12,500 can be used). The resulting silicone oil dispersion is emulsified or otherwise added to the final detergent matrix. By this means, ingredients such as the aforementioned enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, pnotoactivators. dyes, fluorescers, fabric conditioners and hydrolyzable surfactants can be "protected" for use in detergents, including liquid laundry detergent compositions.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol. ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerin, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 10.5. Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the an.

If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01%. preferably from about 0,1%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 10%, preferably to about 5%, more preferably to about 3% by weight, of the composition. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon. and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of the laundry cycle and , thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occuring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>

Further suitable soil release agents are described in U.S. 4.201.824 Voilland a al.: U.S. 4.240.918 Lagasse et al.; U.S. 4.525.524 Tung et a!.: U.S. 4.579.681 Ruppert cv a/.; U.S. 4.220.918; U.S. 4,787,989; EP 279.134 A. 1988 to Rhone-Pouienc Chemie; HP 457,205 A to BASF (1991); and DE 2,335,044 to Unilever N.V., 1974; all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 10.5. Laundry products are typically at pH 9-11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc.. and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Granular Compositions<br>
The bleach stable polyalkyleneimines of the present invention can be used in both low density (below 550 grams/liter) and high density granular compositions in which the density of the granule is at least 550 grams/liter. Granular compositions are typically designed to provide an in the wash pH of from about 7.5 to about 11.5, more preferably from about 9.5 to about 10.5. Low density compositions can be prepared by standard spray-drying processes. Various means and equipment are available to prepare high density compositions. Current commercial practice in the field employs spray-drying towers to manufacture compositions which have a density less than about 500 g/1. Accordingly, if spray-drying is used as part of the overall process, the resulting spray-dried panicles must be further densified using the means and equipment described hereinafter. In the alternative, the formulator can eliminate spray-drying by using mixing, densifying and granulating equipment that is commercially available. The following is a nonlimiting description of such equipment suitable for use herein.<br>
Various means and equipment are available to prepare high density (i.e., greater than about 550. preferably greater than about 650, grams/liter or "g/1"), high solubility, free-flowing, granular detergent compositions according to the present invention. Current commercial practice in the field employs spray-drying towers to manufacture granular laundry detergents which often have a density less than about 500 g/1. In this<br>
procedure, an aqueous slurry of various heat-stable ingredients in the final detergent composition are formed into homogeneous granules by passage through a spray-dry-ing tower, using conventional techniques, at temperatures of about 175°C to about 225°C. However, if spray drying is used as part of the overall process herein, additional process steps as described hereinafter must be used to obtain the level of density (i.e.. &gt; 650 c/1) required by modem compact, low dosage detergent products.<br>
For example, spray-dried granules from a tower can be densified further by loading a liquid such as water or a nonionic surfactant into the pores of the granules and/or subjecting them to one or more high speed mixer/densifiers. A suitable high speed mixer/densifier for this process is a device marketed under the tradename "Lodige CB 30" or "Lodige CB 30 Recycler" which comprises a static cylindrical mixing drum having a central rotating shaft with mixing/cutting blades mounted thereon. In use, the ingredients for the detergent composition are introduced into the drum and the shaft/blade assembly is rotated at speeds in the range of 100-2500 rpm to provide thorough mixing/densification. See Jacobs et al, U.S. Patent 5,149,455. issued September 22. 1992. The preferred residence time in the high speed mixer/densifier is from about 1 to 60 seconds. Other such apparatus includes the devices marketed under the tradename "Shugi Granulator" and under the tradename "Drais K-TTP 80).<br>
Another process step which can be used to densify further spray-dried granules involves grinding and agglomerating or deforming the spray-dried granules in a moderate speed mixer/densifier so as to obtain panicles having lower intraparticle porosity. Equipment such as that marketed under the tradename "Lo'dige KM" (Series 300 or 600) or "Lodige Ploughshare" mixer/densifiers are suitable for this process step. Such equipment is typically operated at 40-160 rpm. The residence time of the detergent ingredients in the moderate speed mixer/densifier is from about 0.1 to 12 minutes. Other useful equipment includes the device which is available under the tradename "Drais FC-T 160". This process step which employs a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. LSdige KM) can be used by itself or sequentially with the aforementioned high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lo'dige CB) to achieve the desired density. Other types of granules manufacturing apparatus useful herein include the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent 2.306.898. to G. L. Heller, December 29, 1942.<br>
While it may be more suitable to use the high speed mixer/densifier followed by the low speed mixer/densifier, the reverse sequential mixer/densifier configuration is also<br><br>
contemplated by the invention. One or a combination of various parameters including residence times in the mixer/densifiers, operating temperatures of the equipment, temperature and/or composition of the granules, the use of adjunct ingredients such as liquid binders.,and flow aids, can be used to optimize densification of the spray-dried granules in the process of the invention. By way of example, see the processes in Appel et al, U.S. Patent 5.133,924. issued July 28, 1992 (granules are brought into a deformable state prior to densification); Delwei et al. U.S. Patent 4,637.891, issued January 20, 1987 (granulating spray-dried granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate); Kruse et al, U.S. Patent 4,726,908, issued February 23, 1988 (granulating spray-dried granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicale); and, Bortolotti et al. U.S. Patent 5.160.657. issued November 3? 1992 (coating densified granules with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate).<br>
In those situations in which particularly heat sensitive or highly volatile detergent ingredients (i.e. perfume ingredients) are to be incorporated into the final detergent composition, processes which do not include spray drying towers are preferred. The formulator can eliminate the spray-drying step by feeding, in either a continuous or batch mode, starting detergent ingredients directly into mixing/densifying equipment that is commercially available. One particularly preferred embodiment involves charging a surfactant paste and an anhydrous builder material into a high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige CB) followed by a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) to form high density detergent agglomerates. See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,366,652, issued November 22, 1994 and Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,486,303, issued January 23, 1996. Optionally, the liquid/solids ratio of the starting detergent ingredients in such a process can be selected to obtain high density agglomerates that are more free flowing and crisp.<br>
Optionally, the process may include one or more recycle streams of undersized particles produced by the process which are fed back to the mixer/densifiers for further agglomeration or build-up. The oversized particles produced by this process can be sent to grinding apparatus and then fed back to the mixing/densifying equipment. These additional recycle process steps facilitate build-up agglomeration of the starting detergent ingredients resulting in a finished composition having a uniform distribution of the desired particle size (400-700 microns) and density (&gt; 550 g/1). See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,516.448. issued May 14. 1996 and Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,489,392, issued February 6, 1996. Other suitable processes which do not call for the use of spray-drying towers are described by Bollier et al. U.S. Patent 4,828,721, issued May 9, 1989; Beerse et al, U.S. Patent 5,108,646. issued April 28, 1992; and, Jolicoeur, U.S. Patent 5,178,798, issued Januarv 12. 1993.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the high density detergent composition of the invention can be produced using a fluidized bed mixer. In this process, the various ingredients of the finished composition are combined in an aqueous slurry (typically 80% solids content) and sprayed into a fluidized bed to provide the finished detergent granules. Prior to the fluidized bed. this process can optionally include the step of mixing the slurry using the aforementioned Lddige CB mixer/densifier or a "Flexomix 160" mixer/densifier. available from Shugi. Fluidized bed or moving beds of the type available under the tradename "Escher Wyss" can be used in such processes.<br>
Another suitable process which can be used herein involves feeding a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant, an alkaline inorganic material (e.g. sodium carbonate) and optionally other detergent ingredients into a high speed mixer/densifier (residence time 5-30 seconds) so as to form agglomerates containing a partially or totally neutralized anionic surfactant salt and the other starting detergent ingredients. Optionally, the contents in the high speed mixer/densifier can be sent to a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) for further agglomeration resulting in the finished high density detergent composition. See Appel et al, U.S. Patent 5,164,108. issued November 17, 1992.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, it may be preferred that the dispersants are premixed with anionic surfactants or a paste comprising anionic surfactants, such as sulfonate and sulfate surfactants, prior to addition of or to the other detergent ingredients.<br>
It may be preferred that the dispersant of the invention or a composition comprising the dispersant, preferably a laundry detergent composition, is comprised in a detergent tablet or in the form of a detergent tablet. The tablets can be manufactured by any process known in the art. It may be preferred that the compositions are firstly formed by any of the processes described herein, in particularly agglomeration, prior to formation of the tablet.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 PEI 3000 E^n<br>
A 90 g portion of polyethyleneimine (PEI) having a listed average molecular weight of 3000 equating to about 0.03 moles of polymer and about 2.1 moles of nitrogen functions) is added to a 2 gallon stirred autoclave equipped for stirring even small volumes of liquid. The autoclave is then sealed and purged of air (by applying vacuum to minus 28" Hg followed by pressurization with nitrogen to 250 psia, then venting to atmospheric pressure). The autoclave contents are heated to 130 °C while aoplying vacuum. After about one hour, the autoclave is charged with nitrogen to about 250 osia<br>
while cooling the autoclave to about 105 °C. Ethylene oxide is then added to the autoclave incrementally over time while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure. temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate. The ethyiene oxide pump is turned off and cooling is applied to limit any temperature increase resulting from any reaction exotherm. The temperature is maintained between 100 and 110 °C while the total pressure is allowed to gradually increase during the course of the reaction. After a toral of 92 grams of ethylene oxide has been charged to the autoclave (roughly equivalent 10 one mole ethylene oxide per PEI nitrogen function), the temperature is increased to 110° C and the autoclave is allowed to stir for an additional hour. At this point, vacuum is applied to remove any residual unreacted ethvlene oxide.<br>
Next, vacuum is continuously applied while the autoclave is cooled to about 50 * C while introducing 11.3 g of sodium methoxide as a 25% sodium methoxide in methanol solution (0.21 moles, to achieve a 10% catalyst loading based upon PEI nitrogen functions). The methoxide solution is sucked into the autoclave under vacuum and then the autoclave temperature controller setpoint is increased to 130 °C. A device is used to monitor the power consumed by the agitator. The agitator power is monitored along with the temperature and pressure. Agitator power and temperature values gradually increase as methanol is removed from the autoclave and the viscosity of the mixture increases and stabilizes in about 1 hour indicating that most of the methanol has been removed. The mixture is further heated and agitated under vacuum for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
Vacuum is removed and the autoclave is cooled to 105 °C while it is being charged with nitrogen to 250 psia and then vented to ambient pressure. The autoclave is charged to 200 psia with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide is again added to the autoclave incrementally as before while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 110 °C and limiting any temperature increases due to reaction exotherm. After the addition of a total of 2772 g of ethylene oxide (resulting in a total of 30 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of PEI nitrogen function) is achieved over several hours, the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional hour.<br>
The final reaction product is cooled slightly and collected in glass containers purged with nitrogen.<br>
In other preparations the neutralization and deodorization is accomplished in the reactor before discharging the product.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 PEl 3000 P,E<br>
A 90 g portion of polyethyleneimine (PEI) having a listed average molecular weight of 3000 equating to about 0.03 moles of polymer and about 2.1 moles of nitrogen functions) is added to a 2 gallon stirred autoclave equipped for stirring even small volumes of liquid. The autoclave is then sealed and purged of air (by applying vacuum to minus 28" Hg followed by pressurization with nitrogen to 250 psia, then venting to atmospheric pressure). The autoclave contents are heated to 130 °C while applying vacuum. After about one hour, the autoclave is charged with nitrogen to about 250 psia while cooling the autoclave to about 105 °C. Propylene oxide is then added to the autoclave incrementally over time while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and propylene oxide flow rate. The propylene oxide pump is turned off and cooling is applied to limit any temperature increase resulting from any reaction exotherm. The temperature is maintained between 100 and 110 °C while the total pressure is allowed to gradually increase during the course of the reaction. After a total of 122 grams of propylene oxide has been charged to the autoclave (roughly equivalent to one mole propylene oxide per PEI nitrogen function), the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the autoclave is allowed to stir for an additional hour. At this point, vacuum is applied to remove any residual unreacted propylene oxide.<br>
Next, vacuum is continuously applied while the autoclave is cooled to about 50 ' C while introducing 11.3 g of sodium methoxide as a 25% sodium methoxide in methanol solution (0.21 moles, to achieve a 10% catalyst loading based upon PEI nitrogen functions). The methoxide solution is sucked into the autoclave under vacuum and then the autoclave temperature controller setpoint is increased to 130 °C. A device is used to monitor the power consumed by the agitator. The agitator power is monitored along with the temperature and pressure. Agitator power and temperature values gradually increase as methanol is removed from the autoclave and the viscosity of the mixture increases and stabilizes in about 1 hour indicating that most of the methanol has been removed. The mixture is further heated and agitated under vacuum for an additional 30 minutes.<br>
Vacuum is removed and the autoclave is cooled to 105 °C while it is being charged with nitrogen to 250 psia and then vented to ambient pressure. The autoclave is<br><br>
charged to 200 psia with nitrogen. Propylene oxide is again added to the autoclave incrementally as before while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 110 °C and limiting any temperature increases due to reaction exotherm. After the addition of a total of 244 g of propylene oxide (resulting in a total of 3 moles of propylenc oxide per mole of PEI nitrogen function) is achieved over several hours, the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional hour. At this point, vacuum is applied to remove any residual unreacted propylene oxide.<br>
Ethylene oxide is then added to the autoclave incrementally while closely monitoring the autoclave pressure, temperature, and ethylene oxide flow rate while maintaining the temperature between 100 and 110 °C and limiting any temperature increases due to reaction exotherm. After the addition of a total of 2495 g of ethylene oxide (resulting in a total of 27 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of PEI nitrogen function) is achieved over several hours, the temperature is increased to 110 °C and the mixture stirred for an additional hour.<br>
The reaction mixture is then collected in nitrogen purged containers and eventually transferred into a 22 L three neck round bottomed flask equipped with heating and agitation. The strong alkali catalyst is neutralized by adding 20.2 g methanesulfonic acid (0.21 moles). The reaction mixture is then deodorized by passing about 100 cu. ft. of inert gas (argon or nitrogen) through a gas dispersion frit and through the reaction mixture while agitating and heating the mixture to 130 °C.<br>
The final reaction product is cooled slightly and collected in glass containers purged with nitrogen.<br>
In other preparations the neutralization and deodorization is accomplished in the reactor before discharging the product.<br>
