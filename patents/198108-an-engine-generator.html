The present invention relates to an engine-generator. In particular the present invention relates to an improvement of an engine-generator in which an engine and a generator coaxially connected to the engine are resiliently supported on a base frame and housed in a soundproofing case.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
A conventional engine-operated machine is already known from, for example, Japanese Utility Model Registration Application Laid-open No.5-66232 in which, in order to minimize operating noise in consideration of the operational and surrounding environments when performing work at night in an urban area, etc., an engine and a work machine are covered with a soundproofing case.<br>
However, in the above-mentioned conventional arrangement, since the engine as well as an air cleaner and a carburetor forming an intake system for the engine are housed in the same section within the soundproofing case, there is the possibility that air having an increased temperature due to heat released from the engine is supplied to the engine, thus decreasing the engine intake charge efficiency.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been achieved in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an engine-generator that can prevent air supplied to the engine from having a high temperature when the entire engine-generator is covered with a soundproofing case.<br>
In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, in accordance with a first<br>
aspect of the present invention, there is proposed an engine-generator in which an<br>
engine and a generator coaxially connected to the	<br><br>
engine are resiliently supported on a base frame and housed in a soundproofing case. The interior of the soundproofing case is divided into a chamber to be cooled and an engine-side air intake chamber by an engine-side partition formed from a case-fixed wall section fixed to the soundproofing case and an engine-fixed wall section fixed to the engine with a resilient seal provided therebetween. The chamber to be cooled houses the majority of the engine. The engine-side air intake chamber houses an air cleaner and a carburetor, and cooling air is introduced from outside the soundproofing case into the engine-side air intake chamber. The engine-fixed wall section is provided with an engine-side inlet for supplying cooling air to the chamber to be cooled from the engine-side air intake chamber. A first intake pipe is connected at one end to the carburetor and at the other end to one end of a second intake pipe with the engine-fixed wall section interposed therebetween. The other end of the second intake pipe is connected to the engine.<br>
In accordance with this arrangement, since the interior of the soundproofing case is divided by the engine-side partition into the chamber to be cooled housing the majority of the engine, which has a high temperature, and the engine-side air intake chamber housing the air cleaner and the carburetor, which form the intake system for the engine, and cooling air is supplied from the engine-side air intake chamber to the chamber to be cooled, the engine-side air intake chamber has a low temperature, and the air supplied to the engine via the carburetor can be maintained at a low temperature, thereby maintaining a high intake charge efficiency of the engine. Furthermore, the engine-side partition is formed by providing the resilient seal between the case-fixed wall section fixed to the soundproofing case and the engine-fixed wall section fixed to the engine, the first and second intake pipes providing a connection between the carburetor and the engine are supported by the engine-fixed wall section that vibrates together with the engine, and the engine-side inlet is also provided in the engine-fixed wall section. Therefore, even when the external shape of the engine is complicated, a large sealing effect can be obtained while simplifying the seal structure between the chamber to be cooled<br><br>
and the engine-side air intake chamber, thereby facilitating assembly of the engine and the engine-side partition.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned first aspect, in accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is proposed an engine-generator<br>
in which the work machine is a generator, and the interior of the soundproofing case is divided into the chamber to be cooled and a generator-side air intake chamber by a generator-side partition that is fixed to the soundproofing case with a resilient seal provided between the partition and the generator. Cooling air is introduced from outside the soundproofing case into the generator-side air intake chamber. The generator-side air intake chamber is provided with a generator-side inlet for supplying cooling air from the generator-side air intake chamber to the chamber to be cooled so that the generator-side inlet faces the generator-side air intake chamber. In accordance with this arrangement, since sections of the engine generator that have a high temperature are placed together in the chamber to be cooled, which is in the middle, when cooling air is supplied, from the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers on the left and right, to the chamber to be cooled via the engine-side and generator-side inlets, it is possible to maintain the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers at a low temperature while preventing heat and sound from leaking into the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers, and moreover, it is possible to impart the function of suppressing noise leakage to the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned second aspect, in accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, there is proposed an enginesgenerator<br>
in which the air cleaner and the carburetor are housed in the engine-side air intake chamber, an electrical component is housed in the generator-side air intake chamber, and ventilation pathways are formed between an exhaust vent, which is provided in the soundproofing case so as to open into the chamber to be cooled, and engine-side and generator-side outside air inlets, which are provided in the soundproofing case so as to open into the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers so that air that is taken in from outside the soundproofing case into the two air intake chambers via the two outside air<br><br>
inlets, passes through the chamber to be cooled fi-om the two air intake chambers, and is discharged outside the soundproofing case via the exhaust vent.<br>
In accordance with this arrangement, by housing those parts that should avoid high temperatures within the respective air intake chambers so as to correspond to the engine and the generator and maintaining each of the air intake chambers at a low temperature, the need for a special arrangement of parts and measures for heat shielding is eliminated. Moreover, in the chamber to be cooled, the ventilafion effect of natural convection can be utilized, thereby efficiently cooling the parts disposed in the chamber to be cooled.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an engine-generator comprising: an engine; a generator coaxially connected to the engine; a base frame; a soundproofing case housing the engine and the work machine being resiliently supported on the base frame; an air cleaner; a carburetor; characterized by a case-fixed wall section fixed to the soundproofing case; an engine-fixed wall section fixed to the engine; a resilient seal; an engine-side partition formed from the case-fixed wall section and the engine-fixed wall section with the resilient seal provided therebetween, the soundproofing case being divided by the engine-side partition into an engine-side air intake chamber and a chamber to be cooled housing the majority of the engine, the engine-side air intake chamber housing the air cleaner and the carburetor, and cooling air being introduced from outside the soundproofing case into the engine-side air intake chamber; an engine-side inlet provided in the engine-fixed wall section for supplying cooling air from the engine-side air intake chamber to the chamber to be cooled; a first intake pipe connected at one end to the carburetor; and a second intake pipe connected at one end to the other end of the first intake pipe with the engine-fixed wall section interposed therebetween, the other end of the second intake pipe being connected to the engine.<br><br>

A plurality of engine-side inlets 48 are provided on a side wall of the recoil starter housing 47.<br>
When the engine-side cooling fan 43 rotates together with the crankshaft 38 during operation of the engine 11, air that is taken into the recoil starter housing 47 via the engine-side inlets 48 is guided to the interior of the plate-shaped section 44a of the fan cover 44 via the opening 45. Centrifugal force of the engine-side cooling fan 43 acting on the air within the plate-shaped section 44a forces the cooling air to flow from the plate-shaped section 44a to the air duct section 44b, from the air duct section 44b to the cylinder barrel 40 and the head cover 41 of the engine 11. Mounted on and covering the head cover 41 of the engine 11 is a cover 53  connected to the air duct section 44b of the fan<br><br>

A first ventilation pathway 95 is formed, as shown by arrows in FIGS. 4 and 5, between the pair of engine-side outside air inlets 79, which are provided in the soundproofing case 18 so as to communicate with the engine-side air intake chamber 58, and the exhaust vent 68, which is provided in the soundproofing case 18 so as to communicate with the exhaust chamber 65 in the upper part of the chamber to be cooled 57. Thus, air that is taken into the engine-side air intake chamber 58 via the engine-side outside air inlets 79 from the outside of the soundproofing case 18 is taken into the fan cover 44 from the engine-side air intake chamber 58 via the engine-side inlets 48 by the engine-side cooling fan 43. The air then flows past the sides of the cylinder barrel 40 and the head cover 41 of the engine 11 within the chamber to be cooled 57 and<br><br>
through the exhaust chamber 65 via the inlet 66. The air is then discharged via the exhaust vent 68 to the outside of the soundproofing case 18.<br>
Moreover, fins 96 provided on the outer faces of the cylinder barrel 40 and the head cover 41 are arranged so as to guide cooling air toward the side of the exhaust muffler 17. The side of the exhaust muffler 17 faces the opening of the cover 53 covering the head cover 41 so that the cooling air from the fan cover 44b flows between the head cover 41 and the cover 53. The first ventilation pathway 95 is therefore arranged so that, part way along, cooling air is blown directly on the side of the exhaust muffler 17.<br>
A second ventilation pathway 97 is formed, as shown by the arrow in FIG. 3, between the pair of generator-side outside air inlets 80 which are provided in the soundproofing case 18 so as to communicate with the generator-side air intake chamber 59, and the exhaust vent 68 which is provided in the soundproofing case 18 so as to communicate with the exhaust chamber 65 in the upper part of the chamber to be cooled 57. Thus, air that is taken into the generator-side air intake chamber 59 via the generator-side outside air inlets 80 from the outside of the soundproofing case 18 is taken into the casing 51 of the generator 13 from the generator-side air intake chamber 59 via the generator-side inlets 56 by the generator-side cooling fan 54. The air then passes through the chamber to be cooled 57 via the air outlets 55 in the one end of the casing 51. The air then passes through the exhaust chamber 65 via the inlet 66 and is discharged via the exhaust vent 68 to the outside of the soundproofing case 18.<br>
The air outlets 55 provided in the casing 51 of the generator 13 are formed so as to blow air toward the inside face of the side cover 26 of the cover part 24. The second ventilation pathway 97 therefore extends upward along the inside face of the soundproofing case 18 at one end of the exhaust muffler 17 so as to communicate with the exhaust chamber 65.<br>
A heat insulating material 98 is attached to the engine-side and generator-side partitions 60, 61 on the side of the chamber to be cooled 57. A heat insulating material 99 is also attached to the upper face of the partition 64 facing the exhaust chamber 65.<br><br>
The operation of the present invention is explained below.<br>
The interior of the soundproofing case 18 housing the engine 11 and the generator 13 coaxially connected to the engine 11 is divided into three chambers. The three chambers are the chamber to be cooled 57, which houses most of the engine 11 and the generator 13, as well as the exhaust muffler 17, and the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers 58, 59, which are on opposite sides of the chamber to be cooled 57. Moreover, the first and second ventilation pathways 95, 97 are formed between the exhaust vent 68 provided in the upper part of the soundproofing case 18 so as to communicate with the chamber to be cooled 57 and the engine-side and generator-side outside air inlets 79, 80 provided in the soundproofing case 18 so as to communicate with the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers 58, 59. In the first ventilation pathway 95, air is taken into the engine-side air intake chamber 58 via the engine-side outside air inlets 79 from the outside of the soundproofing case 18, then passes through the chamber to be cooled 57, and is discharged outside the soundproofing case 18 via the exhaust vent 68. In the second ventilation pathway 97, air is taken into the generator-side air intake chamber 59 via the generator-side outside air inlets 80, then passes through the chamber to be cooled 57, and is discharged outside the soundproofing case 18 via the exhaust vent 68.<br>
That is, sections of the engine generator that have a high temperature are placed together in the chamber to be cooled 57, which is in the middle relative to the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers 58, 59. The first and second ventilation pathways 95, 97 are formed so that cooling air flowing into the chamber to be cooled 57 from the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers 58, 59, which function as low temperature chambers, flows past the engine 11 and the generator 13 disposed in the chamber to be cooled 57, as well as the exhaust muffler 17, which are arranged in the chamber to be cooled 57, and is smoothly discharged to the outside from the exhaust vent 68. Therefore, it becomes possible to cool the engine generator effectively while preventing heat from being retained within the soundproofing case 18. It is also possible to enhance the soundproofing performance by using<br><br>
the two air intake chambers as zones for preventing the leakage of operating noise.<br>
The engine 11 is elastically supported on the base frame 19 so that the engine-side inlets 48 of the engine 11 face the engine-side air intake chamber 58. The generator 13 is elastically supported on the base frame 19 so that the generator-side inlets 56 of the generator 13 face the engine-side air intake chamber 59. The engine-side partition 60 disposed between the chamber to be cooled 57 and the engine-side air intake chamber 58, as well as the generator-side partition 61 disposed between the chamber to be cooled 57 and the generator-side air intake chamber 59, are fixedly disposed on the base frame 19, which is a part of the soundproofing case 18. The outer peripheries of the engine-side and generator-side partitions 60, 61 are in intimate contact with the inside face of the cover part 24 forming a part of the soundproofing case 18 and covering the engine 11 and the generator 13. The exhaust vent 68 is provided in the cover part 24.<br>
Arranging the cover part 24, which is a part of the soundproofing case 18, so as to cover the engine 11 and the generator 13 can form, within the soundproofing case 18, the chamber to be cooled 57, and the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers 58, 59, which are defined by the engine-side and generator-side partitions 60, 61. Using the cooling air passage of the engine 11 as a passage connecting opposite sides of the engine-side partition 61 and using the cooling air passage of the generator 13 as a passage connecting opposite sides of the generator-side partition 61 allows cooling air to be combined in the chamber to be cooled 57 where the majority of the engine 11 and the generator 13 and the exhaust muffler 17 are housed, and discharged outside via the exhaust vent 68. The carrying out of maintenance can thus be made easy, and the cooling air passage can be formed as a simple structure within the soundproofing case 18.<br>
The soundproofing case 18 includes the first and second side plates 22, 23 that face the outer sides of the engine-side and generator-side partitions 60, 61 with a gap therebetween. The engine-side air intake chamber 58 is formed within the soundproofing case 18 between the engine-side partition 60 and the<br><br>
first side plate 21, and the generator-side air intake chamber 59 is formed within the soundproofing case 18 between the generator-side partition 61 and the second side plate 23. Therefore, it is possible to easily divide the interior of the soundproofing case 18 into the chamber to be cooled 57 having a high temperature and the air intake chambers 58, 59 having a low temperature on opposite sides of the chamber to be cooled 57, and to arrange parts suitably for each of the chambers 57, 58, 59, thus effectively cooling them.<br>
Moreover, since the engine-side and generator-side outside air inlets 79, 80 are provided in the base frame 19 that forms a part of the soundproofing case 18, the engine-side and generator-side outside air inlets 79, 80 introducing outside air into the engine-side and generator-side air intake chambers 58, 59 respectively, it is possible to introduce the outside air into the two air intake chambers 58, 59 with a simple structure while minimizing leakage of intake noise to the outside, thus maintaining the two air intake chambers 58, 59 at a low temperature.<br>
Furthermore, the fuel tank 12, the air cleaner 15, and the carburetor 16 are arranged within the engine-side air intake chamber 58, and the battery 14 and the electrical components 76 to 78 are arranged within the generator-side air intake chamber 59. Therefore, housing the components that should avoid high temperatures, such as the fuel tank 12, the air cleaner 15, the carburetor 16, the battery 14, and the electrical components 76 to 78 within the respective air intake chambers 58, 59 so as to correspond to the engine 11 and the generator 13 and maintaining each of the air intake chambers 58, 59 at a low temperature, eliminates the need for a special arrangement of parts and measures for heat shielding.<br>
Moreover, disposing the carburetor 16 in the engine-side air intake chamber 58 having a low temperature maintains the air supplied to the engine 11 via the carburetor 16 at a low temperature, thereby maintaining high intake charge efficiency of the engine 11.<br>
The elastic seals 86, 92 are provided between the engine-side partition 60 and the engine 11 and between the generator-side partition 61 and the generator 13, respectively, and the flow of air from the chamber to be cooled 57<br><br>
having a high temperature to the air intake chambers 58, 59 on opposite sides thereof having a low temperature can be reliably blocked. Accordingly, leakage of heat from the chamber to be cooled 57 to the air intake chambers 58, 59 on opposite sides thereof is suppressed, and the air intake chambers 58, 59 are imparted with the function of suppressing noise leakage from the soundproofing case 18.<br>
Furthermore, since the exhaust muffler 17 is arranged above the generator 13 in the chamber to be cooled 57 and the exhaust vent 68 is provided above the exhaust muffler 17 in the cover part 24 of the soundproofing case 18, the ventilation effect from the natural convection within the chamber to be cooled 57 is enhanced, thereby decreasing the temperature of the interior of the soundproofing case 18 relatively fast even after the engine generator is stopped. Moreover, the flow of air caused by the natural convection is forced to flow above the sections of the engine 11 and the generator 13 disposed within the chamber to be cooled 57, thus enhancing the cooling effect.<br>
The engine-side partition 60 is formed by providing the elastic seal 83 between the case-fixed wall section 81 that is attached to the soundproofing case 18 and the engine-fixed wall section 82 that is attached to the engine 11 by air-tightly sealing the gap between the engine-fixed wall section 82 and the engine 11 with the elastic seal 86. Moreover, the first and second intake pipes 87, 90 connecting the carburetor 16 and the engine 11 are supported on the engine-fixed wall section 82 that vibrates together with the engine 11. The engine-side inlets 48 are provided in the recoil starter housing 47 that vibrates together with the engine-fixed wall section 82. Thus, even when the external shape of the engine 11 is complicated, a large sealing effect can be obtained while simplifying the seal structure between the chamber to be cooled 57 and the engine-side air intake chamber 58, thereby facilitating assembly of the engine 11 and the engine-side partition 60.<br>
Arranged in the upper part of the chamber to be cooled 57 are sections of the first and second ventilation pathways 95, 97 between the soundproofing case 18 and the partition 64 positioned above the exhaust muffler 17. The pipe 67 for guiding exhaust gas from the exhaust muffler 17 is connected to the<br><br>
exhaust chamber 65. That is, the exhaust chamber 65 is formed by partitioning the upper space of the chamber to be cooled 57 with the partition 64. The exhaust chamber 65 combines the exhaust gas from the exhaust muffler 17 with the cooling air that has cooled the engine 11, the generator 13, and the exhaust muffler 17 by passing through the first and second ventilation pathways 95, 97, and guiding the combined exhaust gas and the cooling air to the exhaust vent 68.<br>
The presence of the partition 64 between the exhaust muffler 17 and the exhaust vent 68 effectively reduces the leakage of operating noise generated in the exhaust muffler 17 and lessens the influence of exhaust heat on the engine 11 and the generator 13. Moreover, since the exhaust gas from the exhaust muffler 17 and the cooling air that has cooled the engine 11, the generator 13, and the exhaust muffler 17 are combined in the exhaust chamber 65 and then discharged outside the soundproofing case 18, the exhaust noise is reduced.<br>
The first ventilation pathway 95 extending to the exhaust chamber 65 while cooling the engine 11 is arranged so that, part way along, engine cooling air is blown directly onto the side of the exhaust muffler 17. The second ventilation pathway 97 extending to the exhaust chamber 65 while cooling the generator 13 is arranged so that, part way along, it passes upward along the inside face of the soundproofing case 18 at said one end of the exhaust muffler 17.<br>
Thus, directly blowing the cooling air onto the side of the exhaust muffler<br>
17	can effectively cool the exhaust muffler 17. Furthermore, since the cooling air from the generator 13 flows along the inside face of the soundproofing case<br>
18	at the one end of the exhaust muffler 17, that is, on the inlet 66 side of the exhaust chamber 65, cooling air, including the cooling air that has cooled the exhaust muffler 17, can be guided smoothly to the exhaust chamber 65.<br>

For example, the present invention can be applied to an engine-operated machine in which a work machine other than a generator 13 is connected to an engine 11.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-mentioned embodiment, although the resilient seal 86 is disposed between the engine-fixed wall section 82 and the engine 11, it is possible, without using such a resilient seal, to arrange so that there is no flow of cooling air and exhaust gas between the engine 11 and the engine-fixed wall section 82.<br><br><br>
