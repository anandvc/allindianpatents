TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"ADSORBENT FOR SELECTIVE ADSORPTION OF<br>
UNSATURATED HYDROCARBONS AND METHOD OF<br>
PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
We, INDIAN PETROCHEMICALS CORPORATION LIMITED, a Government of India Company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of P.O. Petrochemicals, District Vadodara 391 345, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention:<br>
1<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel adsorbents useful in selective adsorption of<br>
unsaturated  hydrocarbons,  manufacture  of such adsorbents and  process for the<br>
separation ol unsaturated hydrocarbons using such adsorbents.  More specifically,<br>
this invention relates to an adsorbent having a high degree of selectivity and affinity<br>
for olefin molecules  and  also having high  adsorption capacity for  olefins,  and  a<br>
process for  producing  the   same.   More  specifically,   this  invention  relates  to   an<br>
ethylene   and/or  propylene   separation   process   employing   a   specially   prepared<br>
adsorbent to  effectively  separate  ethylene  and/or propylene  from  a  gas  mixture<br>
containing ethylene and/or propylene together with one or more components selected<br>
from the group consisting H2, N, Ar, He, CH4, C,H6, C3H8, C02, and CO in an efficient<br>
manner using the adsorbent of the present invention. The adsorbents of the present<br>
invention display high adsorptive capacity for unsaturated hydrocarbons such as<br>
ethylene and propylene.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propylene and butene are basic<br>
raw materials in synthetic chemistry. These are produced by naphtha/natural gas<br>
cracking  or  by  dehydrogenation   of  paraffins.   Invariably,   these   are   obtained   as<br>
mixtures   necessitating   separation   before   their   use.   Traditionally   separations   of<br>
ethylene  from   ethane   and  propylene   from   propane  have   been  achieved  by  low<br>
temperature and/or high pressure distillation. These separations are highly energy<br>
intensive and difficult to achieve. Separation of mixture of ethane-ethylene is carried<br>
out at -25°C and 320 psig in a distillation column containing over  160 trays and<br>
propane-propylene at -30°C and 30 psig pressure in a distillation column containing<br>
over 200 trays. Separations of ethane-ethylene and propane-propylene by distillation<br>
are the largest energy consuming separation processes in petrochemical industry.<br>
Furthermore,  demand for  ethylene  and propylene  is  ever increasing.  World  wide<br>
ethylene capacity of about 100 million metric tons (mmt) per year is projected to grow<br>
to 122.1 mmt/y by 2005.<br>
For the  past several years,  various researchers have  been working on the<br>
development of alternative technologies such as adsorption, chemical absorption and<br>
membrane separation processes. Of the various alternative technologies adsorption<br>
process appears to be the most promising. Adsorbent forms heart of any adsorption<br>
process. An adsorbent suitable for the separation of light olefin /paraffin gas mixture<br>
should have high adsorption capacity and  selectivity for either olefin  or paraffin.<br>
2<br><br>
Adsorbed component should be able to desorb easily by simple chemical engineering operation such as by increasing the temperature or by reducing the pressure. Conventional adsorbents such as activated alumina, activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites known in the prior art do not show good selectivity for olefins or paraffins. Hence, development of a suitable adsorbent has become a key factor in the development of adsorption process.<br>
The adsorbents such as ion exchanged zeolites, polymer supported silver<br>
chloride, copper-containing resins etc. known in the prior art exhibiting selectivity for<br>
ethylene or propylene suffer from one or more drawbacks such as slow adsorption<br>
kinetics, poor adsorption capacity and/or selectivity. Recently, Yang and Kikkinides<br>
(Ref, AIChE J. 41,509, 1995) and Cho and co- workers (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 36,<br>
27749, 1997) have reported more promising adsorbents. Among the adsorbents<br>
reported by them, Ag+ resin and CUCI/AI2O3 showed high olefin adsorption capacity<br>
and good selectivity. However, ethylene and propylene sorption kinetics on Ag" resin<br>
are slow. CUCI/AI2O3 is a CuCl dispersed on y-Al2O3 by monolayer dispersion<br>
technique and hence, is obtained in a powder form. For commercial use, this<br>
adsorbent needs to be shaped in to pellets, which leads to reduction in adsorption<br>
capacity and selectivity. Furthermore, adsorbent formulations prepared using Cu(I)<br>
compounds are unstable and easily get oxidized to Cu(II) leading to loss in adsorption<br>
capacity and selectivity of the adsorbent. Xie et al., (Advances in Catalysis, 1, 37,<br>
1990) have also reported a series of adsorbents containing Cu(I). These were also<br>
prepared in powder form. Hence, these adsorbents also suffer from the above<br>
mentioned drawbacks. More recently Cho et al (Korean Patent No. filed on 29. .2000,<br>
US patent application No.) invented olefin selective adsorbents exhibiting superior<br>
adsorption	capacity,	selectivity	and<br>
rates of adsorption. These were prepared by dispersing silver compound on conventional supports such as activated alumina and acid activated clay. These adsorbents possess high adsorption capacity and selectivity for olefins over paraffins compared to those reported in the prior art. However, due to ever changing business requirements and demands, it is desirable to have adsorbents exhibiting even higher adsorption capacity, selectivity and/or reversibility for efficient separation of hydrocarbon gases. The present invention now seeks to meet such demands by providing novel adsorbent formulations and methods exhibiting very high adsorption capacity, selectivity and reversibility for olefins over saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Objects of the present Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an adsorbent composition exhibiting high adsorption selectively and capacity for unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
3<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a method for the production of an adsorbent possessing high adsorption capacity for selectively adsorbing unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention is to provide improved, stable solid adsorbent(s) in powder, pellet or bead form for selective adsorption of unsaturated hydrocarbons, which adsorbent is a composite comprising (a) a silver compound or copper and (b) a suitable mesoporous substrate having a sufficiently high surface area, and highly suitable pore size distribution and which is obtainable by a process comprising dispersion/impregnation of silver compound in the said support and heat treatment of the resulting composite material.<br>
Yet another object of this invention to provide a process for the separation of ethylene, propylene and butylenes either individually or as mixture from a hydrocarbon stream containing ethylene, propylene or butylenes or mixture of together with one or more components selected from such gases as H2, N2, Ar, He, CH4, C2H6, C3H8, CO2 and CO using a mass of adsorbent.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to effect the above separation process at conditions of moderate temperatures (0-1 SOT) and pressures (0.1 to 100 atmospheres).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that a group of solid adsorbents in the form of powder, granules or pellets have improved adsorptive capacity, selectivity and reversibility for ethylene and/or propylene not known in the prior art and that they can be produced by a process as described below. These adsorbents comprise (a) a silver or copper compound and (b) a mesoporous substrate. These adsorbents are highly stable and are capable of reversibly adsorbing substantial quantity of ethylene and/or propylene at room temperature. The rates of adsorption of ethylene and/or propylene are also very fast in these adsorbents.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an adsorbent for selective adsorption of unsaturated hydrocarbons from its mixture with saturated hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, permanent gases or mixture thereof comprising of:<br>
Silver or copper compound	1 to 70 wt %<br>
Substrate	30 to 99%<br>
The  present invention  also  provides  a method  for  the  manufacture  of an<br>
4<br><br>
adsorbent for use in selective adsorption of unsaturated hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof from a mixed gas, which comprises impregnating or dispersing a silver (I) or copper (I) compound on a mesoporous substrate Or support to form a composite material and subjecting said composite material to heat treatment.<br>
In another important aspect, the present invention also relates to a process for separating ethylene and/or propylene from gas mixtures containing them by passing a stream of said gas mixture through a mass of said adsorbent at a temperature from 0°C to 170°C and a pressure from 0.1 to 100 atmospheres and releasing the adsorbed ethylene and/or propylene by lowering pressure and/or increasing temperature.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The adsorbents of this invention are obtained by dispersion of silver or copper compound on the surface of a mesoporous silica or alumina substrate as active compound. The dispersion of silver or copper compound is achieved either by impregnation or by solid state monolayer dispersion Many silverf]), copper(i), silver(u) or copper (II) compound or their mixtures can be Used as active compound. When silver (II) or copper (II) compound is used as active metal compound, silver(II) or copper(II) needs to be reduced to silver (I) or copper(I) respectively in a reducing atmosphere. Some of the representative examples of the silver compounds which can be suitably utilized in the practice of this invention are silver nitrate, silver halides such as silver chloride, silver bromide and silver iodide, silver perchlorate, silver tetrafluoroborate, silver carboxylates such as silver formate and silver acetate, and silver oxide. Preferred silver compounds are silver nitrate, silver acetate, silver sulfate, silver chloride and silver tetrafluoroborate. Some of the representative examples of the copper compounds, which can be suitably utilized in the present invention, include copper chloride, copper sulfate, and copper acetate.<br>
Solid supports (substrate) required for the preparation of the selective adsorbents plays an important role. The synthesis of first mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 (Mobil 1992 reference) was reported in 1992 with pore sizes in the range of 1.5 to over 10 nm using cationic surfactant templates. Tanev and Pinnavaia in 1995 proposed a neutral (S°I°) templating route for the synthesis of mesoporous molecular sieves based on hydrogen bonding and self-assembly between neutral primary amine surfactants (S°) and neutral inorganic precursors (1°). Neutral templating route results in mesoporous materials with better hydro thermal stability. Further, template can be completely extracted from the pores of the rnesoporous materials for reuse. This eliminates the need for calcination of the surfactant. In the present invention three types of mesoporous substrates are used. These are hexagonal mesoporous<br><br><br>
silica (HMS), SB A-15 and mesoporous alumina.<br>
In the present invention the mesoporous substrates are used either in powder form or formed bodies. Substrate bodies are formed by extrusion or granulation as described below.<br>
The substrate is obtained in pellets form by (a) mixing with a suitable inorganic binder thoroughly in a ball mill to obtain a homogeneous mixture of substrate-binder, (b) forming dow by the addition of required quantity of water and optionally suitable extrusion aid such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellvnose acetic acid, ligno sulfonate or sotta silicate in a kneeding machine, and (c) extrusin through an extruder having a suitable die. To obtain pellets in spherical shape the substrate-binder mixture obtained above after step (a) is converted to spherical pellets in a pan granulator by simultaneous addition of powder mixture and Spraying water. The amount of inorganic binder employed can vary from 5 to 50% preferably from 10 to 30% by weight of the adsorbent binders that can be employed include hydrated alumina, kaolinite, sodium silicate solution.<br>
the   pruueufcarr   i&amp;ilbweu1   for   the preparation! of the	adsorden t is<br>
described below :<br>
Silver or copper compound solution is first Prepared by dissolving calculated amount of active metal compound in a suitable solvent The total volume of active metal solution required is obtained by measuring the total pore volume of the substrate. The active metal compound prepared above is then mixed with a known quantity of activated substrate and equilibrated for a period or 0.1 to 24hrs preferably for 1 to 4 hrs. The excess solvent is then removed from the resultant mixture by heating and/or purging with air/inert gas or by applying vacuum. The adsorbent is then dried in an oven at 90-110°C with or without thert flow. The dried adsorbent is then calcined at a temperature in the range of 100 tc 600°C for a period of time from about 0.1 to about 100 hrs, preferably from about 1 to10 hours. The heating step can be conducted in a suitable atmosphere such as nitrogen and helium.<br>
Representative examples of the solvent that ct^ be suitably used include, for example, water, hydrochloric acid containing aqueous solution, nitric acid containing aqueous solution, ammonium hydroxide solution, primary or secondary alcohols having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, acetone, ethyl acetate) hydrocarbons having 4 to 7 carbon atoms, propionitrile, and acetonitrile.<br>
The adsorbent of the present invention can also be prepared by physically mixing silver or copper compound in solid form to substrate in powder form. The amount of silver in the form of the compound is preferabiy from 1 to 70% by weight of adsorbent composition. The resultant solid mixture is heated at a temperature in the range of 30 to 600°C preferably at 100 to 250°C for a period of time from about 0.1 to<br>
6<br><br>
about  100  hrs,  preferably from  about   1   to   10  hours.  The  heating  step  can be conducted in a suitable atmosphere such as nitrogen and helium.<br>
The adsorbent of the present invention can also be prepared in a pellet form as described herein: (a) Silver or copper compound and inorganic binder such as, hydrated alumina, bentonite, attapulgite, sepiolite, kaolinite are thoroughly mixed with a suitable substrate, (b) the mixture thus obtained is converted to dough by adding a suitable solvent and mixing in a kneading machine, (c) The dough thus obtained is extruded through an extruder having a die plate (d) The extruded pellets are dried at room temperature followed by drying at 90-120°C in an oven, (e) The dry adsorbent is then calcined at a temperature in the range of 100 to 600°C for a period of time from about 0.1 to about 100 hrs, preferably from about 1 to 10 hours. The heating step can be conducted in a suitable atmosphere such as nitrogen and helium.<br>
The adsorbents of this invention described above can be used to separate ethylene or propylene from mixed gases. The separation process comprises passing a stream of the mixed gas through an adsorber bed charged with the adsorbent(s) of the invention. Ethylene and/or propylene, which are selectively adsorbed, can be readily desorbed either by lowering the pressure or by increasing the temperature of the adsorber bed resulting in a regenerated adsorbent. The adsorbent so regenerated can be reused as an adsorbent for the separation of ethylene and/or propylene from the mixed gas. This separation process can also purify raw material gases wherein ethylene and/or propylene present as impurities.<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated by the following Examples. The adsorption capacity and selectivity data given in these Examples are obtained by measuring adsorption isotherms by volumetric set-up. Adsorption rates and adsorption reversibility given in the examples is obtained by measuring adsorption and desorption uptakes in CAHN 1100 microbalance system. In a typical adsorption-desorption isotherm measurement, a known quantity of the adsorbent was loaded in volumetric set-up or the CAHN 1100 microbalance system and activated under vacuum (to 10"4 mmHg) at a suitable temperature for several hours. The adsorbent was then cooled to room temperature under vacuum. Adsorption isotherm was measured by admitting pulses of pure hydrocarbon gas in to the adsorption set-up. After each adsorption isotherm measurement, desorption experiment was also carried out to check the reversibility of the adsorption isotherm. In any adsorption process both absolute adsorption capacity and the working capacity of an adsorbent are very important. The working capacity of an adsorbent is the difference between the adsorption capacity at a predetermined partial pressure of an adsorbate and the amount retained at lower partial vapor pressure. The adsorption uptake was measured by admitting pure hydrocarbon gas into the CAHN balance at 1 atmosphere<br>
7<br><br>
and recording the weight gain as a function of time.<br>
All of the given Examples are merely for the purpose of illustration and are not to be regarded as limiting the scope of the invention or the manner in which it can be practiced.<br>
EXAMPLE -1 A homogeneous solution was obtained by dissolving 5.2 Ig of dodeclamine in 42.08g of ethyl alcohol in 600ml beaker. To this solution 53.07g of double distilled water was added with vigorous stirring. To the resultant solution, 20.89g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added drop wise with continuous stirring at room temperature. Stirring was continued for another forty five minutes followed by aging for 24 hours at room temperature. The resultant solid product, hexagonal mesoporous silica, HMS- 1 was recovered by filtration, washing with water and water-alcohol mixture. HMS-1 was then air dried followed by oven drying for 8 hours. Dodecylalmine was almost completely recovered from HMS-1 pores by refluxing with ethyl alcohol. The resultant mesoporous silica was then dried and calcined at 600°C for 4 hours. The yield of HMS product was 97% by weight. It was characterized by XRD which exhibited characteristic peak at 2.3 (20). Surface area (1076 m2/g), average pore size (2.5nm) and pore volume (0.99 cc/g) were obtained from measured nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at -196°C and shown in Fig.l.<br>
