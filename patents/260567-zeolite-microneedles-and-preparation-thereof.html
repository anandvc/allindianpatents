				<td>The present application claims priority to provisional application No. 60/776,107 entitled<br>
"Molecular Sieve and Zeolite Microneedles and Preparation Thereof, that was filed on<br>
February 21, 2006, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Microneedles are considered a hybrid of hypodermic needles and transdermal patches<br>
that involve narrow and shallow injections to administer drugs. Microneedles are a new drug<br>
delivery system for transdermal delivery of drug, by virtue of their small dimensions, ability<br>
to penetrate into skin tissue in a non-invasive manner and their minimization of the risk for<br>
infection. Microneedles typically are around 100-200 microns in length, which is long<br>
enough to penetrate the stratum corneum skin barrier but not deep enough to reach the nerves<br>
in the dermis layer. Therefore, microneedles may provide a painless injection and may allow<br>
patients to operate the microneedles safely on their own.<br>
Microneedles are conventionally made of silicon, glass, metallic material or polymer.<br>
Early microneedles were made of silicon and were prepared by microlithography and etching<br>
technologies originally developed for the microelectronics industry. Glass microneedles are<br>
made using conventional drawn glass micropipette techniques. However, the fragile nature of<br>
silicon and glass often results in easy breakage of the microneedles.<br>
Metallic materials, including steel, stainless steel and nickel, may be electrodeposited<br>
onto polymeric mold to create microneedles with good mechanical strength. However, the<br>
possible toxicity of metals to the human body can limit its area of application and can pose a<br>
problem for the waste disposal. Polymeric microneedles are easy to manufacture, safe and<br>
inexpensive. A number of biodegradable polymers have been approved by the U.S Food and<br>
Drug Administrative (FDA). For example, Poly(lactic-acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic-acid) (PGA)<br>
and their copolymers have been used routinely for a narrow range of medical applications.<br>
However, the relative low Young's modulus of polymers means the polymer microneedles<br>
may not be strong enough to penetrate the skin.<br><br>
Consequently, it is desirable to develop microneedles with improved properties.<br>
Particularly, it is desirable to develop microneedles that exhibit improved mechanical<br>
properties and possess improved thermal and chemical stability compared to silicon and<br>
polymer microneedles. It is also desirable to develop microneedles that are biocompatible,<br>
especially when compared to metal microneedles. Furthermore, it is desirable to develop<br>
microneedles that can be produced conveniently and inexpensively.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
examples of which are also provided in the following description. Exemplary embodiments<br>
of the invention are described in detail, although it will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
relevant art that some features that are not particularly important to an understanding of the<br>
invention may not be shown for the sake of clarity.<br>
Furthermore, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise<br>
embodiments described below and that various changes and modifications thereof may be<br>
effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.<br>
For example, elements and/or features of different illustrative embodiments may be combined<br>
with each other and/or substituted for each other within the scope of this disclosure and<br>
appended claims.<br>
A method of fabricating microneedles includes providing a polymer microneedles<br>
template, depositing zeolite seeds on the polymer microneedles template, growing the zeolite<br>
seeds into microneedles, and removing the polymer microneedles template, as shown in FIG.<br>
1. Preferably, the microneedles are configured as an array, as depicted in FIGs. 10, 15 and 16.<br>
The polymer microneedles template may be prepared using a photolithographic<br>
process. Microneedles with different degrees of tapering may be achieved by controlling the<br>
conditions for front exposure photolithography, for example, by varying the exposure time<br>
and/or developing time in the photolithographic process. The microneedles may contain<br>
either open-end tips or closed-end tips. The conformation of the tips may be controlled by<br><br><br>
varying the seeding methods and/or the growth conditions of the zeolite. Removing the<br>
polymer microneedles template can provide an array of hollow microneedles with a zeolite<br>
shell. The polymer microneedles template may be removed using an air calcination method<br>
or an ozonation method.<br>
The polymer microneedles template be formed from a substrate layer and a photo-<br>
sensitive polymeric layer coated on the surface of the substrate layer. The photo-sensitive<br>
polymeric layer may include a material such as an SU-8 photoresist (SU-8 2075 made by<br>
MicroChem). The substrate layer may include silica, glass, quartz, metal, or any combination<br>
thereof. The polymer microneedles template may be prepared using a front exposure method<br>
by spin-coating the resist onto the surface of the substrate layer, for example, using a Solite<br>
5110-C/PD Wafer Spinner (available from Solite). The resulting template precursor may then<br>
be pre-baked on a level hot plate and soft baked to evaporate the solvent. Coating fidelity and<br>
resist-substrate adhesion of the template can be improved by carrying out the soft baking step<br>
at a lower initial bake temperature, and allowing the solvent to be evaporated out of the<br>
polymer layer at a controlled manner.<br>
The polymer microneedles template precursor may then be subjected to a<br>
photolithographic process. A mask may be aligned on the coated substrate and exposed to<br>
UV light, for example, using an AB-Manufacturing Contact Aligner (available from AB-<br>
Manufacturing). The photo-sensitive polymer is excited when exposed to UV light. For<br>
example, SU-8 has an optimal absorption of UV exposure from about 350nm to about 400nm.<br>
Exposure time may be used to control the shape of the polymer microneedles template and<br>
ultimately the shape of the microneedles. The exposure time may range from about 30<br>
seconds to about 360 seconds. In one example, the template may be exposed to UV light for<br>
about 120 seconds. In another example, the template may be exposed to UV light for about<br>
180 seconds. The longer the exposure time, the more the polymer may be excited. Following<br>
the exposure, a post-expose bake may be preformed to selectively cross-link the exposed area<br>
of the polymer layer. Thus, by varying the exposure time, photo-sensitive polymer layers<br>
with different extents of cross-linking may be prepared.<br>
The unexposed portion of the photo-sensitive polymer may be removed by immersing<br>
the template precursor into a developer, for example, using a MicroChem's SU-8 Developer<br><br><br>
with agitation (available from MicroChem). The exposed area will form highly cross-linked<br>
polymers and will remain on the template, while the unexposed areas will be stripped out.<br>
Moreover, as with the exposure time, the developing time may also be used to control the<br>
shape of the polymer microneedles template and ultimately the shape of the microneedles.<br>
The developing time may range from about 3 minutes to about 90 minutes. In one example,<br>
the precursor may be immersed into the developer for 30 minutes. In another example, the<br>
precursor may be immersed into the developer for 60 minutes. The contact area between the<br>
polymer layer and the developer decreases at a high aspect ratio, and. thus, polymer<br>
microneedles templates with different tapered angles may be obtained by controlling the<br>
developing time. The longer the developing time, the more photo-sensitive polymer may be<br>
washed away.<br>
Instead of the negative resist system described above, a positive resist system may be<br>
used to form the polymer microneedles template. For example, when a photo-sensitive<br>
polymer layer such as DNQ-Novolac is exposed to radiation, the polymer becomes soluble.<br>
Immersing the layer in a developer removes the exposed areas of the layer.<br>
The microneedles fabricated on the polymer microneedles template may contain<br>
tapered angles of 75°, 90°, 100° or any other variations. A fluorescent microscope, such as a<br>
BX41 from Olympus, may be used to characterize the microneedles. FIG. 2 shows tapered<br>
microneedles with a height of about 280 μm, a top diameter of about 120 μm, a bottom<br>
diameter of about 240 μm, and a taper angle of 75°. FIG. 3 shows bowl shaped microneedles<br>
with a height of about 160 μm, a top diameter of about 200 μm, a bottom diameter of about<br>
140 μm, and a taper angle of 100°. FIG. 4 shows cylindrical microneedles with a height of<br>
about 150 μm, a diameter of about 100 μm, and a taper angle of 90°. Consequently, by<br>
controlling the exposure and/or developing time, microneedles may be obtained in various<br>
shapes, including tapered, bowl and cylindrical shaped.<br>
Microneedles may be prepared by electrostatically assembling, spin-coating or aging<br>
nanometer-sized zeolite nanocrystal seeds on the surface of the polymer microneedles<br>
template, and growing the zeolite seeds. Different zeolites may be grown by different zeolite<br>
seeds. For example, silicate-1 seeds may be used to grow MFI-type zeolites. Other zeolite-<br>
types may be prepared from the corresponding zeolite seeds, for example, LTA zeolite from<br><br><br>
NaA seeds. It may be possible to prepare other zeolite-types from seeds of a different zeolite.<br>
For example, FAU zeolite may be grown from NaA seeds. Zeolite seeds may be prepared by<br>
nucleation of zeolite nanocrystals from a homogeneous synthesis solution, followed by<br>
separation and purification. The seeds may then be stored as a suspension in solvents. It may<br>
also be possible to prepare zeolite seeds by grinding corresponding zeolite powder or by<br>
dissolution using acidic or basic solutions.<br>
Zeolite nanocrystals may be made of crystalline molecular sieve materials or<br>
crystalline aluminosilicate materials. Zeolites belong to a broader material category known as<br>
"molecular sieves" and are often referred as such. Zeolites have uniform, molecular-sized<br>
pores, and can be separated based on their size, shape and polarity. For example, zeolites may<br>
have pore sizes ranging from about 0.3 nm to about 1 nm. The crystalline structure of zeolites<br>
may provide good mechanical properties and good thermal and chemical stability. Zeolites<br>
may be applied in chemical adsorption, separations and reactions, as well as in sensors and<br>
medical applications.<br>
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) may be<br>
carried out to determine the properties of zeolites, including their crystallinity, size and<br>
morphology. FIG. 5 shows an X-ray diffraction pattern of silicate-1 seeds obtained using an<br>
X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, X'pert Pro). The pattern indicated that crystalline silicate<br>
1 seeds were present. FIG. 6 shows a scanning electron micrograph of silicate-1 seeds<br>
obtained using a SEM (JEOL, JSM 6300). The micrograph indicated that the silicate-1 seeds<br>
were around 100 nm in size and well dispersed in solution.<br>
Zeolites may be seeded on the polymer microneedles template using an electrostatic<br>
method. The attraction force between oppositely charged surfaces is the driving force for the<br>
electrostatic method. A layer of positively charged polyelectrolyte may be introduced into the<br>
polymer microneedles template. In one example, the template is immersed in a<br>
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) PDADMAC (1mg/ml in 0.5M NaCl, Sigma)<br>
polyelectrolyte solution. Zeolite seeds that are negatively charged may then be introduced<br>
and coated onto the positively charged surface of the polymer microneedles template. In<br>
another example, a negatively charged polyelectrolyte may be added onto the positively<br>
charged polyelectrolyte prior to the introduction of the zeolite seeds. An example of a<br><br><br>
negatively charged polyelectrolyte is polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), such as 1 mg ml-1 PSS<br>
in 0.5 M NaCl (Aldrich). A sequential adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes may<br>
be repeated one or more times, and then finished with an adsorption of a positively charged<br>
polyelectrolyte, to ensure the template is coated uniformly with positively charged<br>
polyelectrolyte. Zeolite seeds that are negatively charged may then be introdoced and coated<br>
onto the positively charged surface. FIG. 7 shows a scanning electron micrograph of 100 nm<br>
zeolite seed-coated and tapered microneedles template formed using the electrostatic coating<br>
method, with the seeds uniformly coated on the template surface.<br>
Zeolites may also be seeded onto the polymer microneedles template using a spin-<br>
coating method. A surfactant may first be spin-coated onto the polymer microneedles<br>
template, for example, by spin-coating (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (Aldrich, 95%)<br>
in ethanol (Merck, 99.9 %) at more than 3000 rpm using a spin-coater (P-6000, Specialty<br>
Coating System, Inc.). Zeolite seed solution may then be similarly spin-coated onto the<br>
template. The surfactant and zeolite seed coating steps may be repeated one or more times.<br>
By controlling the speed of spin coating, the tip of the microneedle template can either be<br>
seeded or not seeded. For example, the speed of spin coating may vary from about 3000 rpm<br>
to about 6000 rpm. A completely seeded sample may grow a close-ended microneedle,<br>
whereas a microneedle having an unseeded tip may grow an open-ended microneedle. FIGs.<br>
10A and 10B show electron micrographs of an array of microneedles formed using the spin-<br>
coating method, with close-ended tips and open-ended tips, respectively.<br>
Zeolites may also be seeded onto the polymer microneedles template using an aging<br>
method. The polymer microneedles template may first be placed in a zeolite synthesis<br>
solution and allowed to age at low temperature. For example, the template may be placed into<br>
a zeolite synthesis solution containing 40 TEOS (Aldrich), 10 TPAOH (Aldrich) and 20000<br>
DDI water by molar ratios for deposition of pure silica, silicate-1 zeolites.<br>
After the zeolite seeds are deposited on the polymer microneedles template, the zeolite<br>
may be grown. The zeolite may be synthesized at high temperature, for example, in a Teflon<br>
bomb incubated at about 403 K for around 24 hours. A thin zeolite shell may subsequently<br>
grow on the seeded template and seed surface of the substrate. FIG. 8 shows a scanning<br>
electron micrograph of zeolite open-tip microneedles formed using the aging method, with a<br><br><br>
shell thickness of about 1 μm. Moreover, to increase the shell thickness, the zeolite<br>
microneedles may be transferred again into the zeolite synthesis solution containing 40 TEOS<br>
(Aldrich), 10 TPAOH (Aldrich) and 20000 DDI water by molar ratios to further grow for<br>
another 24 hours. FIG. 9 shows a scanning electron micrograph of zeolite open-tip<br>
microneedles formed using the aging method, with a shell thickness of about 6 μm.<br>
Hollow microneedles may be obtained by removing the polymer microneedles<br>
template from the zeolite shell using an air calcination method or an ozonation method. In the<br>
air calcination method, the polymer microneedles template and the organic growth directing<br>
agent (or organic template) in the zeolite pores may be burnt off at a high temperature. In one<br>
example, the microneedles are calcined in an air-purged furnace that may be programmed to<br>
increase the temperature to about 873 K and kept for around 24 hours, at a rate of change to<br>
the temperature of about 0.5 K/min. FIGs. lOA and lOB show the scanning electron<br>
micrographs of closed-tip and open-tip zeolite microneedles, respectively, that have been<br>
calcined for 24 and 48 hours, respectively. After air calcination at about 873 K for around 24<br>
hours, the polymer microneedles template have preferably been removed, and hollow zeolite<br>
microneedles remain.<br>
In the ozonation method, the polymer microneedles template reacts with ozone to form<br>
gaseous byproducts in gas phase treatment, or soluble byproducts in liquid phase treatment.<br>
For example, the zeolite-coated template may be wrapped by heating tape (Thermolyne<br>
Briskheat) that may be controlled by a temperature controller (RKC) and a thermocouple<br>
(Omega, K-type). Pure oxygen or oxygen-ozone gas stream may then be fed and controlled<br>
by an ozone generator (Trailigas, Ozonconcept OZC 1002). The ozone treatment method is<br>
applicable in a gaseous phase as well as in a liquid phase.<br>
Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) may be used to identify organic materials, and in<br>
some cases inorganic materials, using an infrared microscope (PerkinElmer, Spectrum GX).<br>
This technique measures the absorption of various infrared light wavelengths by the materials<br>
of interest. These infrared absorption bands can identify specific molecular components and<br>
structures. Referring to FIGs. 11A and 11B, the FTIR results show the zeolite-coated<br>
polymer microneedles template before and after ozonation, respectively. Three characteristic<br>
bands at wavenumbers of 2880 cm-1, 2940 cm-1 and 2980 cm-1 were observed before<br><br><br>
ozonation, which indicated the presence of propyl groups with C-H stretching vibrations.<br>
After ozonation, however, those three peaks disappeared, which indicate the propyl groups<br>
might have been removed during ozone treatment.<br>
Zeolite microneedles preferably are biocompatible. ISO 10993 describes a set of<br>
international standards that address the biological evaluation of medical devices. The basic<br>
biocompatibility tests include ISO 10993-1 and ISO 10993-5. The ISO 10993-1 test may be<br>
carried out to determine the characteristics and properties of zeolites, including their chemical,<br>
toxicological, physical, electrical, morphological, and mechanical properties. These can be<br>
determined by various characterization techniques such as SEM, XRD and FTIR, and are<br>
often available from the material safety data sheet (MSDS).<br>
The ISO 10993-5 test may be carried out to determine the cytotoxicity of zeolites. In<br>
the elution test method, extracts may be obtained by placing the zeolites in cell culture media,<br>
for example, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, under standard conditions. The<br>
cells will then be observed for visible signs of toxicity in response to the zeolites, such as a<br>
change in the size or appearance of cellular components, or a disruption in their configuration.<br>
FIG. 12 shows an MDCK cell culture without the addition of zeolites, which was used<br>
as a control for the cytotoxicity test. FIGs. 13A, 13B, 13C and 13D show that the cells did<br>
not exhibit any changes in size or appearance from day 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively, after the<br>
addition of Silicate-1 zeolites to the MDCK cell culture. As seen, the MDCK cells did not<br>
show visible signs of toxicity, because the numbers and configuration of the cell's monolayer<br>
appeared to be the same, thus indicating that Silicate-1 zeolites did not inhibit the growth or<br>
cause the death to the MDCK cells.<br>
An insertion test may be performed to determine the force required for zeolite<br>
microneedles to penetrate a skin's surface. FIG. 14 shows a force-displacement graph for the<br>
insertion of the zeolite microneedles into a pig's skin. The graph can be divided into three<br>
stages. In stage A, the horizontal line represented when the microneedles sample started to<br>
move towards the skin at a constant speed, which indicated that little force was required to<br>
overcome the resistance of air between the microneedles and the skin, for a small<br>
displacement. In stage B, the increasing slope represented when the microneedles began to<br><br><br>
make contact with the skin, and the skin deformed under pressure. As the microneedles<br>
insertion is resisted by the stratum corneum of the skin, a greater force is therefore required<br>
for the penetration. In stage C, a small decrease in the force exerted represented when the<br>
microneedles were inserted into the skin, and the discontinuity between stages B and C<br>
indicated the occurrence of insertion. Since the inner part of the skin is less resistive than the<br>
outer stratum corneum, less force is required for further penetration.<br>
The effects of the wall thickness and the packing geometries of the open-tip zeolite<br>
microneedles on the force of insertion may also be studied. FIGs. 16A and 16B show the<br>
optical micrographs of an array of microneedles of a close-packed pattern and a squared<br>
pattern, respectively. FIG. 17 shows a graph illustrating the insertion force for different<br>
thicknesses of zeolite wall and different packing geometries of microneedles. As seen, the<br>
insertion force between the square and close-packed patterns was similar at a given zeolite<br>
wall thickness. The insertion force to insert through a pig's skin increased with thicker zeolite<br>
wall, which indicated that a thicker wall was less sharp.<br>
A strength test may be performed to determine the force required to break the zeolite<br>
microneedles. For example, a strength test may be performed using a movable load cell of a<br>
Compressive/Tensile Tester (Instron, model 5567). FIG. 18 shows a force-displacement<br>
graph for the strength test. The graph can be divided into three stages. In stage A, the<br>
horizontal line represented when the microneedles sample started to move towards the tester<br>
platform at a constant speed, which indicated that little force was required to overcome the<br>
resistance of air between the microneedles and the skin for a small displacement. In stage B,<br>
an increasing slope represented when the microneedles began to make contact with the tester<br>
platform, because a greater force was required to move further downward. In stage C, the<br>
discontinuity represented when one of the microneedles broke. The further increase in slope<br>
indicated larger force was required for additional displacement, since the microneedles were<br>
pressed against the test platform.<br>
The effects of the wall thickness and the packing geometries of the open-tip zeolite<br>
microneedles on the breakage force may also be studied. FIG. 15 shows an optical<br>
micrograph of an array of zeolite microneedles after the insertion into skin. As shown, over<br>
90% of the needles remained intact after the insertion, which proves that zeolite microneedles<br><br><br>
can have the mechanical strength for drug delivery. FIG. 19 shows a graph illustrating the<br>
breakage force for different thicknesses of zeolite walls and different packing geometries of<br>
microneedles. As seen, the breakage force between the square and close-packed patterns was<br>
similar at a given zeolite wall thickness. The breakage force increases with thicker zeolite<br>
wall, which indicates that a thicker wall is stronger.<br>
A drug delivery test may be performed to determine the diffusion rate of drug through<br>
a membrane, for example, using a diffusion cell consisted of an upper chamber and a lower<br>
chamber separated by a membrane. FIG. 20 shows the change of the concentration of sodium<br>
chloride in the lower chamber of the diffusion cell. The "test" graph represents when<br>
membrane was pierced while "control" graph represents when the membrane was not pierced.<br>
The results show that the concentration of sodium chloride in saline solution in the lower<br>
chamber increases with time at a constant rate when the membrane was pierced, but the<br>
concentration remained unchanged when the membrane was not pierced.<br>
Zeolite microneedles may be applied in medical applications including drug delivery<br>
and body fluid extraction. Drug delivery may include vaccination, hormone regulation and<br>
insulin delivery. Moreover, the microneedles may be used in drug delivery applicators, such<br>
as pen applicators or wristwatch applicators. Body fluid extraction may cover blood glucose<br>
analysis and building sensors. Apart from the use of drug delivery, the microneedles can<br>
serve as body fluid extractor and/or biosensor. It is possible to use microneedles to draw<br>
blood samples for analysis with an onboard sensor. This data can then be processed to<br>
calculate the required medicinal dosage. The microneedles may be used in cosmetics, such as<br>
creating cosmetic facial masks or tattoos.<br>
Zeolite microneedles may be used in a reusable pen applicator 10, as depicted in FIG.<br>
21. The pen applicator 10 may include a protective case 12, a reservoir 14, a control system<br>
16 and a battery 18. The protective case 12 may serve to protect the microneedles 20 when<br>
the microneedles 20 are not in use, and may ensure vertical insertion of the microneedles 20 at<br>
a constant force to reduce the breakage during use. The reservoir 14 may be used for drug<br>
storage. The control system 16 may include a motor 22 and a control circuitry 24. The pen<br>
applicator 10 may be driven by the motor 22 controlled by the control circuitry 24 to ensure<br><br>
precise rate of injection and drug dosage. The microneedles 20 may be replaced after use, and<br>
thus the pen applicator 10 may be reusable.<br>
FIG. 22 shows a schematic illustrating the mechanism of the pen applicator 10<br>
responsible for the drug injection and loading. The mechanism may include a screw 26, a<br>
plug 28, a motor 30 and a gearbox 32. The plug 28 may be attached to the end of the screw<br>
26 to be driven by the motor 30. The gearbox 32 may be attached to the motor 30 to decrease<br>
the rotation speed and to increase the torque to the plug 28. The plug 28 may be moved<br>
forward to inject drugs and may be moved backward to load drugs.<br>
FIG. 23 shows a schematic illustrating the electronic circuit 34 of the pen applicator<br>
10 responsible for controlling the current flowing through the motor 30 that drives the drug<br>
injection and loading. The circuit 34 may control the motor 30, the directions of rotation, and<br>
one or more external indictor lights (LED) 36. The circuit 34 may include a switch 38 and a<br>
power source made of one of more batteries 40.<br>
The zeolite microneedles may also be used in a programmable wristwatch applicator<br>
50, as depicted in FIGs. 24 and 25. The wristwatch applicator 50 may include a liquid crystal<br>
display (LCD) 52, a micro-pumping system 54, a microprocessor 56, a drug storage chamber<br>
58, rotating tracks of microneedles 60 and a battery 62.<br>
The wristwatch applicator 50 may be programmed to inject the required dosage of<br>
drugs into a human body at a preset time. The drugs may be pumped from the drug storage<br>
chamber 58 through the microneedles into the human body using the micro-pumping system<br>
54. Examples of micro-pumping systems include lead zicrconate titanate or piezoelectric<br>
ceramic (PZT) and magnetic membrane micropumps. The microprocessor 56 may allow<br>
users to adjust the rate of drug injection, the dosage of drugs and the desired timing of<br>
injection, each of which may be displayed on the LCD screen 52. The users may find the<br>
wristwatch applicator 50 convenient to use because the rotating track 60 of microneedles may<br>
rotate after each injection; therefore, replacement of microneedles after each use may not be<br>
necessary, and the drug may be refilled in the drug storage chamber 58.<br><br>
The microneedles are further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to<br>
be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is<br>
to be clearly understood that resort may be had thereof which, after reading the description<br>
herein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of<br>
the specification and/or the scope of the appended claims.<br>

Seed characterization<br>
The seed solution was characterized using an X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The sample<br>
was carefully packed in an aluminum holder, and the holder was clamped on the X-Ray<br>
diffractometer (PANalytical, X'pert Pro). The sample was then exposed to X-Ray with<br>
wavelength of 1.54A generated from copper source. The sample clamp and the X-ray source<br><br>
were rotated at the angular speed of about 0.0087 (rad/s). The crystallinity of the prepared<br>

The seeds were also characterized using a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The<br>
zeolite seeds were first mounted on copper sample holder using conducting adhesives and<br>
silver paste before sputter-coating (Denton, DESK II) 20 nm of gold. SEM (JEOL, JSM 6300)<br>
images were then taken to provide information on the film morphology and crystal grain size.<br>

withstand high temperature treatment. The second step included putting the crucible into an<br>
air-purging furnace. The furnace was programmed to increase the temperature to around 873K<br>
and kept it for about 24 hours. The rate of change of the temperature was 0.5 K/min. The<br>
zeolite microneedles was characterized using a SEM as described in Example 4. FIGs. 10A<br>

Example 11: Removal of SU-8 polymer microneedles template - ozonation<br>
The SU-8 polymer microneedles template was removed by ozonation. The first step<br>
included placing zeolite-coated polymer microneedles template in a stainless steel housing in<br>
which rubber and graphite o-rings were used to provide a leak-free system for gas flow<br>
through the cabinet. The stainless steel consisted of inlet and outlet for retentate to flow<br>
through the tube. The second step included wrapping the step up with heating tape<br>
(Thermolyne Briskheat) that was controlled by temperature controller (RKC) and<br>
thermocouple (Omega, K-type). The third step included increasing the temperature of the<br>
vessel to around 473K with temperature increasing rate of about 0.5 K/min.<br>
The fourth step included feeding pure oxygen or oxygen-ozone gas stream to the unit<br>
at a constant flow rate of about 250 cm3/min when the temperature reached around 473K.<br>
The ozone concentration could be controlled by adjusting the power of the ozone generator<br>
(Trailigas, Ozonconcept OZC 1002). The fifth step included keeping the gas pressure inside<br>
the tube at about 1.2 bars during the ozone treatment. The sixth step included cooling the<br>
setup down at the rate of about 0.5 K/min to room temperature after ozone treatment. FIGs.<br>
11A and 11B, the FTIR results show the zeolite-coated polymer microneedles template before<br>
and after ozonation, respectively.<br>
Characterization<br><br>
The SU-8 polymer microneedles template was characterized using Fourier Transform<br>
Infrared (FTIR). The first step included mounting a zeolite-coated polymer microneedles<br>
template before ozonation on the sample stage of the infrared microscope (PerkinElmer,<br>
Spectrum GX). The second step included flowing dry air (without moisture and carbon<br>
dioxide) through during the measurement. The third step included focusing the sample by the<br>
microscope in visible light mode. The fourth step included changing the light source to IR<br>
mode and adjusting the area for analysis to be 100 μm x 100 μm square after focusing.<br>
The fifth step included scanning the signal of the IR from the sample. The sixth step<br>
included treating the zeolite-coated polymer microneedles template in ozone for 30 minutes to<br>
about 4 hours. The seventh step including mounting the sample on a cell and placing it under<br>
the infrared microscope for analysis. The eighth step included focusing the sample by the<br>
microscope in visible light mode. The ninth step included changing the light source to IR<br>
mode after focusing. The tenth step included scanning the signal of the IR from the sample.<br>
Example 12: Evaluation of zeolite microneedles on its biocompatibility<br>
The first step included preparing zeolite fluid extract by adding 1 g of Silicate-1<br>
crystal in 10 ml culture medium at about 310 K. The second step included deriving Madin-<br>
Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells from normal dog's kidney as the cultured-cell<br>
monolayer. The third step included applying the fluid extract obtained to a cultured-cell<br>
monolayer replacing the medium that had nourished the cells. The fourth step included<br>
incubating the cultures at about 310 K and periodically removing for microscopic<br>
examination at designated times for as long as 3 days. FIG. 12 shows the cell culture without<br>
the addition of zeolite, which was used as a control for the cytotoxicity test. FIGs. 13 A, 13B,<br>
13C and 13D show that the cells did not exhibit any changes in size or appearance from day 0,<br>
1, 2 and 3, respectively, after the addition of Silicate-1 zeolites to the MDCK cell culture.<br>
Example 13: Insertion test<br>
Insertion test was operated using a proprietary software (Merlin). The first step<br>
included attaching the microneedles sample to a movable load cell with maximum load of 100<br>
N of the Compressive/Tensile Tester (Instron, model 5567). The second step included placing<br><br><br>
a pig's skin on an agar plate beneath the microneedles. The third step included moving the<br>
microneedles towards the skin at a constant velocity of 1.1 mm/s by the program. The fourth<br>
step included identifying the insertion sample into the skin when the force exerted by the load<br>
suddenly dropped. The fifth step included using an optical microscope (Olympus BX41) to<br>
examine the sample after the test.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a force-displacement graph for the insertion of the zeolite<br>
microneedles into the pig's skin. FIG. 16 shows the optical micrographs of an array of<br>
microneedles with a close-packed pattern and a square pattern, respectively.<br>
Example 14: Strength test<br>
Insertion test was operated using a proprietary software (Merlin). The first step<br>
includes attaching the microneedles sample to a movable load cell with maximum load of 100<br>
N of the Compressive/Tensile Tester (Instron, model 5567). The second step included moving<br>
the microneedles towards the skin at a constant velocity of 1.1 mm/s by the program. The<br>
fourth step included identifying the needle breakage when the force exerted by the load<br>
suddenly increased significantly. The fifth step included using an optical microscope<br>
(Olympus BX41) to examine the sample after the test. The sixth step included calculating<br>
safety ratio to determine the likeliness of needle breakage throughout the insertion, which is<br>
defined as the amount of breakage force per unit of insertion force.<br>
FIG. 18 shows a force-displacement graph for the strength test. FIG. 15 shows the<br>
optical micrograph of an array of zeolite microneedles after insertion test. As shown, over 90<br>
% of the needles remained intact after the insertion, which proves that zeolite microneedles<br>
have the mechanical strength for drug delivery. Table 1 summarizes the safety ratio of zeolite<br>
microneedles sample with different thicknesses. A larger safety ratio indicates safer<br>
microneedles. The results prove that zeolite microneedles are stronger than the polymeric<br>
microneedles and approaches nickel microneedles in strength.<br>

Example 15: Evaluation of diffusivity of zeolite microneedles<br>
Drug delivery test was performed to investigate the diffusion rate of drug through a<br>
membrane. The diffusion cell consisted of an upper chamber and a lower chamber separated<br>
by a membrane.<br>
The first step included placing a physiological saline solution (1.2 wt % sodium<br>
chloride) in an upper chamber of a diffusion cell. The second step included using a layer of<br>
artificial skin, e.g. pig's skin, as the membrane of the diffusion cell. The third step included<br>
piercing the skin with the microneedles samples and placing them in the diffusion cell. The<br>
fourth step included placing DDI water in a lower chamber of the diffusion cell with<br>
continuous stirring. The fifth step included putting a conductivity meter probe in the lower<br>
chamber and measuring the conductivity in real time. The sixth step included recording the<br>
conductivity reading at a fixed time interval and using the calibration data to convert it to<br>
concentration units.<br>
FIG. 20 shows a graph illustrating the change of the concentration of sodium chloride<br>
in the lower chamber of the diffusion cell. The lower graph depicted the control, which<br>
represented the un-pierced pig's skin. The upper graph depicted the test results, which<br>
represented the pierced pig's skin. As shown, the concentration of sodium chloride remained<br>
unchanged with time with the un-pierced sample. On the other hand, the concentration of<br>
sodium chloride increased steadily with time with the pierced sample, which indicated that the<br>
physiological saline solution diffused across the membrane of the diffusion cell from the<br>
upper chamber and into the lower chamber. Consequently, the result indicates zeolite<br>
microneedles may be used in drug delivery.<br><br>
While the examples of the zeolite microneedles have been described, it should be<br>
understood that the zeolite microneedles are not so limited and modifications may be made.<br>
