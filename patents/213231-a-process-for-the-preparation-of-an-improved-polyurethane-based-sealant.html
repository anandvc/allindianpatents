				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of an improved polyurethane based sealant.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Sealants are flowable materials, which set after application and are highly elastic in nature. These are applied for joining surfaces like rubber to rubber, rubber to metal, metal to metal articles. The sealants are capable of undergoing deformation under any dynamic condition, and recovering quickly to its original shape once the dynamic condition is removed. Commonly used sealants are based on silicone resin, polysulfides, polyurethane, butyl rubber etc.<br>
Polyurethane-based sealants are a class of materials whose properties can be tailor made by varying the constituent components to suit a particular application. Basically, it comprises of polyol, isocyanate and amine. At times, fillers are used to further modify the properties of sealant as per specific need. Polyol provides the elasticity whereas amine provides the strength characteristics to the sealant. A judicious selection of polyol, amine and isocyanate along with necessary fillers is required in order that the sealant composition may have the specific properties. However, the sealant compositions, known in the art, suffer from several disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that such sealant compositions do not have very high adhesion strength. Another disadvantage is that these sealant compositions do not have enough cohesive strength to bear high loads, and have low tensile strength.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that such sealants have low elongation.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
According to present invention there is provided a process for preparation of an improved polyurethane based sealant comprises and characterised by the steps of:-<br>
a)	synthesis of Pre-polymer carried out at a temperature of 40 to 80° C by<br>
treating  hydroxyl-terminated  polybutadiene  (HTPB)  with  toluene  di-<br>
isocyanate as herein described.<br>
b)	synthesis of polyether polyol by reaction of trimethylol with propylene<br>
oxide  in  the  presence  of a catalyst  such  as  NaoH,   KoH,  CsoH  in<br>
preferred quantity of 0.1 to 0.2 parts by weight.<br>
c)	preparation of hardener by mixing amines and polyol and charging  the<br>
mixture with a filler as herein described.<br>
d)	preparation of sealant by mixing preferably 1 equivalent of pre-polymer<br>
and   0.8   to   1.2   equivalent  hardner,   followed   by   curing   as   herein<br>
described.<br>
The polyurethane-based sealant composition can be utilised for joining surfaces like rubber to metal, rubber to rubber, metal to metal having different shapes and configurations. The sealant composition has high adhesion strength along with sufficient flexibility and is capable of bearing high loads. The composition has excellent weather resistance including resistance to marine environment. It has minimal air entrapment and can be utilised for underwater applications. The composition comprises, basically, a prepolyrner and a hardener. The pre-polymer is toluene diisocyanate (TDI) capped polybutadiene diol and the hardener is a mixture of two aromatic diamines in a suitable polyol. The process for preparing the sealant composition<br>
comprises  the  steps of synthesis  of  prepolymer,  synthesis  of polyether  polyol, preparation of hardener and curing  of  sealant<br>
composition.<br>
( i )   Synthesis of the prepolymer:<br>
Hydroxyl—terminated  polybutadiene,  HTPB  (broad  molecular<br>
weight  500 to 5000 and preferred molecular weight 1000  to  3000) with  known  hydroxyl  value (40 to 50) is  treated  with  toluene<br>
diisocyanate,  TDI  (ratio of  HTPB:  TDI=i:2)  under  continuous<br>
stirring for about S-10 hours in a closed vessel.  The temperature<br>
o of the reaction could be from 25 to 150 C and preferably from  40-<br>
o 80 C.  The reaction is continued till the desired isocyanate value<br>
is obtained.  The product is stored in a sealed container to avoid exposure to air and moisture as it has tendency for gelling  under<br>
high humidity condition.<br>
(ii)  Synthesis of polyether polvol:<br>
Polyether  polyol is synthesised by reaction of  trimethylol propane  with propylene oxide in presence of a  suitable  catalyst<br>
like  NaOH, KOH, CsOH etc.  For every 1 equivalent of  trimethylol propane,  30 to 200 equivalent  of propylene oxide (preferably  80<br>
to  120) is utilised.  Preferably, 0.1 to 0.2 parts (weight wise) of  CsOH is used as a catalyst.  The reaction is terminated  after<br>
attaining the desired hydroxyl value (27 to 33).  The catalyst  is removed by treating with water and finally the product is dried to<br>
remove  the moisture.  The synthesised polyether polyol is  stored in a sealed tin container or dark glass bottle.<br>
(iii) Preparation of hardener :<br>
The hardener, basically, is a mixture of an amine and a polyol. The amines used for making polyurethane can be aliphatic or aromatic diamine. However, for better pot life and inherent strength of the sealant, aromatic diamines like 4,4' diamino 3,3' dichloro diphenyl methane and 4,4' diamino 3,3' dichloro triphenyl methane are preferred. Diamine is mixed with polyol under continuous stirring and heating. The percentage of diamine can be varied from 5 to 60% but the preferred percentage is 25 to 40%. The temperature of mixing is in the range of 60 to 90°C. The hardener solution is charged with known quantity of filler such as carbon black, CaCO3 etc. The preferred percentage of carbon black and CaCO3 is 10-15. Among the various filler carbon black is preferred as it adds to the strength characteristics of the resultant sealant. The entire mass comprising of amine, polyol and filler is thoroughly mixed with in a triple roll mill to get a homogeneous product. This mixture is called hardener. The hardener is finally checked for amine content.<br>
(iv) Curing of the sealant composition:<br>
Finally, the sealant composition is prepared by mixing 1 equivalent of prepolymer and 0.8 to 1.2 equivalent of hardener, prepared in above manners. The viscous mass, thus mixed, is thoroughly mixed for 10 to 15 minutes. Afterwards, the mixture is poured onto a mould and the mass is spread with the help of a knife. The mould with mass is left for 24 hrs. at ambient conditions for curing and then, in an oven for post curing at 60° C for 8 hrs. The mould is removed from oven and kept at room temperature for 72 hrs. for complete curing.<br>
The process of the present invention will now be illustrated with working examples which are intended to be typical examples to illustrate the working of the invention and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
WORING EXAMPLES:<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
For preparation of 100 gm of prepolymer, 88.7 gm of HTPB (hydroxyl value 41) is treated with 14 gm of TDI under continuous stirring in a closed vessel at 80°C. The reaction is continued till the desired isocyanate value (3-4%) is obtained. The product is stored in a sealed container to avoid exposure to air and moisture as it has<br>
chance of gelling under high humidity condition. For synthesis of polyol, 2.5 gm of trimethylol propane is reacted with 99 gm of propylene oxide in presence of (cesium hydroxide) CsOH (0.1 - 0.2%). After attaining the desired hydroxyl value (27 to 33) the reaction is terminated. The catalyst is removed by treating with water. Finally, the product is dried to remove the moisture. For preparation of 100 gm of the hardener, 14 gm of 4,4' diamino 3,3' dichloro diphenyl methane and 18 gm of 4,4' diamino 3,3' dichloro triphenyl methane are mixed with 46 gm of polyol in a resin kettle under stirring at 80°C. The solution thus obtained is further charged with 9 gm of carbon black and 11 gm of CaCO3. The entire mass is thoroughly mixed with in a triple roll mill to get a homogeneous product. This mixture is called hardener. The hardener is finally checked for amine content. For preparing lOOgm of cured sealant compound, 74.6 gm of prepolymer is mixed with 25.4 gm of hardener. The viscous mass is thoroughly mixed for 10 to 15 minutes. Afterwards the mixture is poured onto a mould and the mass is spread with the help of a knife. The mould with mass is left for 24 hrs. at ambient conditions for curing, and in an oven for post curing at 60° C for 8 hrs. The mould is removed from oven and kept at room temperature for 72 hrs. for complete curing.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
For preparation of 100 gm of prepolymer, 88.7 gm of HTPB (hydroxyl value 41) is treated with 14 gm of TDI under continuous stirring for about 8 hours in a closed vessel at 80°C. The reaction is continued till the desired isocyanate value (3-4%) is obtained. The product is stored in a sealed container to avoid exposure to air and moisture as it has chance of gelling under high humidity condition. For synthesis of polyol, 2.5 gm of trimethylol propane is reacted with 99 gm of propylene oxide in presence of CsOH (0.1 - 0.2%) After attaining the desired hydroxyl value (27 to 33) the reaction is terminated. The catalyst is removed by treating with water. Finally, the product is dried to remove the moisture. For preparation of 100 gm of the hardener, 32 gm of 44' diamino 33' dichloro diphenyl methane is mixed with 46 gm of polyol in a resin kettle under stirring at 80°C. The solution thus obtained is further charged with 9 gm of carbon black and 11 gm of CaCO3. The entire mass is thoroughly mixed with in a triple roll mill to get a homogeneous product. This mixture is called hardener. The hardener is finally checked for amine content. For preparing lOOgm of cured sealant, 75.6 gm of prepolymer is mixed with 24.4 gm of hardener. The viscous mass was thoroughly mixed for 10 to 15 minutes. Afterwards the mixture is poured onto a mould and the mass was spread with the help of a knife. The mould with mass is left for 24 hrs. at ambient conditions for curing, and in an oven for post curing at 60° C for 8 hrs. The mould is removed from oven and kept at room temperature for 72 hrs. for complete curing.<br>
