				<td>Apparatus and method for optical analysis of value documents<br>
[6001] This invention relates to an apparatus and method for optical analysis of<br>
value documents and to apparatuses for processing value documents with an inventive<br>
analysis apparatus.<br>
[0002] Value documents are understood here to mean objects that represent for ex-<br>
ample a monetary value or an authorization and are therefore not to be producible at<br>
will by unauthorized persons. They therefore have features that are not easy to pro-<br>
duce, in particular to copy, whose presence is an indication of authenticity, i.e. produc-<br>
tion by an authorized body. Important examples of such value documents are chip<br>
cards, coupons, vouchers, checks and in particular bank notes.<br>
[0003] An important class of features of such value documents are optically recog-<br>
nizable features, which include in particular features for which luminescent substances<br>
are used that emit luminescence radiation with a characteristic spectrum upon irradia-<br>
tion with optical radiation of a given wavelength. Optical radiation is understood here<br>
to mean electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet, visible or infrared range of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
[0004] For checking authenticity, a value document can be irradiated with suitable<br>
optical radiation. It is then checked by means of a suitable sensor device whether the<br>
optical radiation excites luminescence radiation at given places on or in the value<br>
document, for which purpose optical radiation emanating from the value document is<br>
analyzed spectrally. Such a check should proceed as fast as possible and with simple<br>
equipment; to give apparatuses in which an authenticity check is carried out on the<br>
basis of luminescence features as space-saving a design as possible, it is desirable that<br>
an apparatus for checking luminescence features is constructed very compactly but<br>
still possesses a sufficient spectral resolution and sensitivity to permit recognition of<br>
the presence of the characteristic luminescence spectrum.<br>
[0005] The present invention is therefore based on the object of providing an appa-<br>
ratus for optical analysis of value documents that permits a very compact, space-<br>
 <br>
saving structure, and of providing a corresponding method for analyzing value docu-<br>
ments.<br>
[0006] This object is achieved according to a first alternative by an apparatus for<br>
optical analysis of value documents with a recording area in which a value document<br>
is located during analysis, and a spectrographic device for analysis of optical radiation<br>
coming from the recording area. The spectrographic device comprises a spatially dis-<br>
persing optical device for at least partly decomposing optical radiation coming from<br>
the recording area into spectrally separate spectral components propagating in different<br>
directions according to the wavelength, a detection device locally resolving in at least<br>
one spatial direction for, in particular locally resolved, detection of the spectral com-<br>
ponents, and a collimating and focusing optic for collimating the optical radiation di-<br>
rected from the recording area onto the dispersing device and for focusing at least<br>
some of the spectral components formed by the dispersing device onto the detection<br>
device.<br>
[0007] This object is further achieved according to the first alternative by a method<br>
for optical analysis of a value document wherein optical radiation emanating from the<br>
value document is shaped into a parallel ray bundle by an optic, in particular a colli-<br>
mating and focusing optic, the ray bundle is decomposed at least partly into spectral<br>
components of different wavelengths which propagate in different directions in de-<br>
pendence on the wavelength, at least some of the spectral components are focused by<br>
the optic onto a detection device, and the spectral components focused onto the detec-<br>
tion device are detected.<br>
[0008] The inventive apparatus according to the first alternative uses for analyzing a<br>
value document in the recording area a spectral decomposition of the optical radiation<br>
emanating from the recording area, in particular a value document in the recording<br>
area, which will hereinafter also be designated as detection radiation. For this purpose,<br>
it has the spatially dispersing device which decomposes incident optical radiation at<br>
least partly into spectral components which propagate in spatially different directions<br>
depending on the wavelength of the particular spectral component. The dispersing de-<br>
vice only needs to be able to work in a wavelength range given in dependence on the<br>
 <br>
given value documents. The presence of optical radiation in a certain spatial direction<br>
and thus of the corresponding spectral component is detected by means of the locally<br>
resolving detection device, whose detection signals can be sent for at least partial re-<br>
cording of a spectrum of the radiation emanating from the recording area to an evalua-<br>
tion device and evaluated there. The recording area can be selected here in particular<br>
such that a given transport device for the value documents, for example driven belts,<br>
can transport value documents to be analyzed into the recording area.<br>
[9009] The detection device can have in particular a plurality of detection elements<br>
for detecting optical radiation impinging in each case thereon so as to form corre-<br>
sponding detection signals, which are preferably disposed in the form of a row. How-<br>
ever, it is also possible to use a two-dimensional array of detection elements.<br>
[0010] The apparatus is characterized in particular by the fact that only one optic,<br>
the collimating and focusing optic, is used for performing two functions, namely firstly<br>
for collimating the optical radiation emanating from the recording area, in particular a<br>
value document therein, and secondly for focusing the spectrally decomposed compo-<br>
nents onto the detection device.<br>
[0011] The proposal of this surprisingly simple structure is based on the observation<br>
that for the purpose of checking value documents a merely moderate spectral resolu-<br>
tion, which can be simply obtained with the proposed means, is sufficient in compari-<br>
son with scientific spectroscopy.<br>
[0012] The use of only one optic for collimation and focusing further permits an at<br>
least singly folded beam path after the optic, which permits good spectral resolution at<br>
the same as a low space requirement.<br>
[0013] Compared with another conceivable solution, namely the use of an imaging<br>
grating, there is the further advantage that the dispersing device and the collimating<br>
and focusing optic are comparatively simple components which are thus easy and eco-<br>
nomical to produce.<br>
 <br>
[0014] Furthermore, it is only necessary to adjust the collimating and focusing op-<br>
tic, while in constructions with separate optics for collimation and focusing two optics<br>
must be adjusted.<br>
[0015] A further advantage of the proposed arrangement is that a very high numeri-<br>
cal aperture of the beam path between the collimating and focusing optic can be ob-<br>
tained.<br>
[0016] The collimating and focusing optic can fundamentally be configured at will.<br>
For example, it can contain at least one imaging mirror as the collimating and focusing<br>
optical component. However, to permit a beam path as simple as possible and an eco-<br>
nomical structure to be obtained, the collimating and focusing optic preferably has at<br>
least one lens, which may be a refractive lens or a diffractive optical lens.<br>
[0017] To obtain good spectral resolution and permit a simple evaluation and cali-<br>
bration of the detection device, the collimating and focusing optic in the apparatus can<br>
be achromatic. This is understood to mean that said optic is corrected chromatically in<br>
the spectral range in which the spectrographic device works; the focal points for two<br>
different wavelengths in the given spectral range preferably lie one on the other. The<br>
use of an achromatic optic has the advantage that the radiation emanating from the<br>
recording area and directed onto the dispersing device is, in good approximation, not<br>
additionally split spectrally and in particular chromatic aberrations occur at the most to<br>
a small extent upon focusing of the spectral components onto the detection device. To<br>
come as close as possible, when using an entrance diaphragm or an equivalent device,<br>
to the theoretical limit of resolution given by the size of the diaphragm opening, for<br>
example the slit width in the case of a slit diaphragm, it is desirable that the circle of<br>
confusion of a pixel on the detection device resulting from color aberration in the spec-<br>
tral range to be detected or the working spectral range of the apparatus remains smaller<br>
than preferably 1/5, particularly preferably 1/10, of the size of the diaphragm opening.<br>
[0018] The detection device can fundamentally be disposed and aligned at will rela-<br>
tive to the beam path of the radiation from the recording area. However, it is preferred<br>
in the apparatus that the direction of the radiation from the recording area falling on<br>
the collimating and focusing optic is inclined relative to a surface spanned by the spec-<br>
 <br>
tral components in the area between the collimating and focusing optic and the detec-<br>
tion device. This embodiment permits a particularly space-saving arrangement of the<br>
detection device. In particular in the case that the spectral components span a plane<br>
as the surface, the detection device can comprise a row of detection elements extend-<br>
ing in the direction of the plane, said row extending above or below a plane given by<br>
the beam path of the radiation emanating from the recording area. It is likewise pre-<br>
ferred that the direction of the radiation from the recording area between the collimat-<br>
ing and focusing optic and the dispersing device is inclined relative to a surface<br>
spanned by the spectral components in the area between the collimating and focusing<br>
optic and the dispersing device.<br>
[0019] Further, in the apparatus, a geometric projection of the radiation coming<br>
from the recording area onto a surface spanned and limited by the spectral components<br>
falling on the detection device can be located in said surface, at least in a portion im-<br>
mediately before the collimating and focusing optic. This results in a particularly<br>
space-saving arrangement.<br>
[0020] Further, there can be disposed in the apparatus in the beam path from the re-<br>
cording area to the spectrographic device a diaphragm disposed in the caustic surface<br>
of the collimating and focusing optic and an imaging optic for imaging the recording<br>
area onto the diaphragm. The diaphragm can be embodied in particular by a diaphragm<br>
body with a diaphragm opening or else by a beam-deflecting element or deflecting<br>
element, for example a mirror or a beam splitter, with a surface constituting a dia-<br>
phragm and at least partly reflecting the detection radiation.<br>
[0021] Particularly preferably, the detection device can then be spaced from the<br>
diaphragm in a direction extending orthogonally to the direction in which the spectral<br>
components are split. This results in a particularly compact structure of the apparatus.<br>
[0022] The diaphragm is preferably located laterally beside the detection device<br>
here, regarded in the direction of the spatial splitting of the spectral components. Lat-<br>
erally can also mean above or below here, depending on the alignment of the apparatus<br>
to the ground. If a detection device with a row of detection elements is used, a perpen-<br>
dicular from the diaphragm onto the row preferably intersects the row itself.<br>
 <br>
[0023] The dispersing device used can fundamentally be any optical component or a<br>
combination of optical components that splits incident radiation at least partly into<br>
spectral components propagating in different directions according to the particular<br>
wavelength. For example, a prism can be used. However, the dispersing optical device<br>
of the apparatus preferably has an optical grating. The spectral components used can<br>
preferably be the spectral components of the first diffraction order, although it is also<br>
possible to use higher diffraction orders. This embodiment has the advantage that grat-<br>
ings are readily and economically available for any ranges of the optical spectrum, in<br>
particular for the infrared range. The grating may be any kind of grating, produced for<br>
example mechanically, lithographically or holographically.<br>
[0024] The grating is preferably a reflection grating which directs the spectral com-<br>
ponents immediately back into the collimating and focusing optic, thereby permitting a<br>
particularly compact structure to be obtained.<br>
[0025] Further, it is preferred that the grating is so aligned and so selected relative<br>
to the detection device that the radiation of the zeroth diffraction order does not fall on<br>
the detection device. This has the advantage that the zeroth diffraction order can op-<br>
tionally be used for other analyses. The grating used can be in particular an echelon<br>
grating. The echelon grating used is particularly preferably a blazed grating. This has<br>
the advantage that corresponding configuration and arrangement of the grating per-<br>
mits the radiation of the diffraction order given for forming the spectral components to<br>
have a particularly high intensity. The grating can be aligned with its dispersively act-<br>
ing line structure orthogonally to the optical axis of the collimating and focusing optic.<br>
In this case the radiation emanating from the recording area must then fall on the grat-<br>
ing at an inclination against the optical axis. However, line structures of the grating are<br>
preferably inclined from the optical axis of the collimating and focusing optic. This<br>
permits a simple mutual adjustment of all components disposed between the recording<br>
area and the collimating and focusing optic.<br>
[0026] Further, the dispersing optical device can be itself reflective or integrated<br>
with a reflective element, thereby reducing the number of optical components. How-<br>
ever, it is also possible that the dispersing device used is an optical device dispersing<br>
 <br>
in transmission, in which case a deflecting element, for example a mirror, is provided<br>
for reflecting the beam components generated by the device into the collimating and<br>
focusing optic.<br>
[0027] In a particularly preferred development, the detection device has at least two<br>
edge detection elements which are so disposed that at least part of the detection beam<br>
path extends therebetween. The detection beam path from the recording area to the<br>
dispersing device extends thus at least partly through the detection device, which re-<br>
sults in an advantageously space-saving structure.<br>
[0628] This space-saving structure does not only result in the apparatus according to<br>
the first alternative or upon use of the collimating and focusing optic, however.<br>
[0029] The object is instead achieved according to a second alternative more gener-<br>
ally also by an apparatus for optical analysis of value documents with a recording area<br>
in which a value document is located during analysis, and a spectrographic device,<br>
comprising a spatially dispersing optical device for at least partly decomposing optical<br>
radiation coming from the recording area along a detection beam path into spectrally<br>
separate spectral components propagating in different directions according to the<br>
wavelength,<br>
[0030] and a detection device locally resolving in at least one spatial direction for<br>
detecting the spectral components which has at least two edge detection elements<br>
which are so disposed that at least part of the detection beam path extends therebe-<br>
tween.<br>
[0031] The detection device can in both alternatives have not only the two stated<br>
edge detection elements but also further detection elements which are disposed in a<br>
row in each case following the detection elements. The edge detection elements need<br>
not differ, except for their position, from any other detection elements present, al-<br>
though this is possible. The result is then a detection device with two detector rows of<br>
detection elements disposed along a row. The detector rows constitute a gap through<br>
which at least part of the detection beam path runs. The two edge detection elements<br>
are disposed on each side of the gap.<br>
 <br>
[0032] A particularly compact structure results in both alternatives when the appara-<br>
tus is so configured that in the area of the two edge detection elements the detection<br>
beam path extends parallel to a surface determined by a beam path of the spectral<br>
components. In particular, the detection beam path after the two edge detection ele-<br>
ments and the beam paths of the spectral components can extend at least partly in a<br>
plane, resulting in a particularly flat structure.<br>
[0033] The dispersing device can fundamentally be configured in an apparatus ac-<br>
cording to the second alternative as described in the first alternative, whereby the<br>
changed beam paths must be taken into account. In particular, the dispersing device<br>
can act reflectively. If no collimating and focusing optic is used, it is particularly pref-<br>
erable in an apparatus according to the second alternative that the spatially dispersing<br>
optical device has an imaging dispersing element which focuses optical radiation that<br>
has passed from the recording area between the edge detection elements, split into<br>
spectral components for at least one given spectral range, onto the detection device,<br>
preferably the detection elements thereof including the edge detection elements. This<br>
embodiment offers in particular the advantage that only few parts need to be used.<br>
[0054] For the dispersing device of the apparatus according to the second alterna-<br>
tive, the statements on that of the first alternative apply accordingly. In particular, the<br>
dispersing optical device can preferably have an optical grating which is preferably an<br>
echelon grating, whose steps are so selected that the radiation of the zeroth diffraction<br>
order does not fall on the detection device. The use of a grating permits a particularly<br>
variable adjustment of the splitting of the spectral components. Furthermore, the grat-<br>
ing can be simply executed as a reflection grating, resulting in a structure with few<br>
elements.<br>
[0035] If the grating is a line grating, the line structures of the grating preferably ex-<br>
tend orthogonally to the detection beam path immediately before the optical grating.<br>
This permits the spectral components to be directed onto the detection elements of the<br>
detection device again.<br>
[0036] In the area between the two edge detection elements, no spectral component<br>
is detected. It is therefore preferred in an apparatus according to one of the two alterna-<br>
 <br>
<br>
tives that a beam path from the spatially dispersing device to the detection device ex-<br>
tends such that a spectral component of a given wavelength is directed between the<br>
two edge detection elements. In particular, the detection device, or the detection ele-<br>
ments thereof, and the dispersing device can for this purpose be disposed relative to<br>
each other in a suitable manner. The wavelength can be given depending on the pur-<br>
pose of use of the apparatus. If the apparatus is to be used for example for measuring<br>
luminescence radiation or Raman radiation, the given wavelength is preferably the<br>
wavelength of the excitation radiation with which the luminescence radiation or Ra-<br>
man radiation is excited.<br>
[0037] In particular for checking bank notes it is often desirable to be able to detect<br>
radiation in a spectrally resolved manner in different ranges of the optical spectrum, in<br>
particular in the visible and infrared parts of the optical spectrum. In an apparatus ac-<br>
cording to one of the two alternatives it is therefore preferred that the two edge detec-<br>
tion elements have in each case different spectral detection ranges. If the detection de-<br>
vice has two detector rows at whose opposite ends the two edge detection elements are<br>
disposed, the detection elements of both rows preferably have in each case the same<br>
spectral detection ranges, so that the detection ranges of the detection elements differ<br>
on the opposite sides of the gap. In particular, one detector row can have detection<br>
elements for detecting radiation at least in the visible range of optical radiation, for<br>
example based on silicon, and the other can have detection elements for detecting ra-<br>
diation in the infrared range of optical radiation, preferably with wavelengths greater<br>
than 900 nm, based on indium-gallium-arsenide semiconductors. This offers the ad-<br>
vantage of a spectrally particularly broadband detection while requiring little space. In<br>
particular, the disadvantage can be overcome that detection elements based on silicon<br>
possess too little sensitivity for practical detection purposes in the spectral range with<br>
wavelengths greater than 1100 nm.<br>
[0038] To permit a good signal-to-noise ratio to be obtained at recording times as<br>
short as possible, it is further preferred in an apparatus according to one of the two al-<br>
ternatives that at least some detection elements of the detection device have a sensitive<br>
surface of at least 0.1 mm2. This can in particular yield considerable advantages in<br>
 <br>
<br>
comparison with the use of CCD elements with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio and<br>
the recording time.<br>
[0039] Particularly preferably, the detection device has, in particular in addition to<br>
the two edge detection elements, detection elements for simultaneously generating de-<br>
tection signals which represent a property, in particular the intensity, of the radiation<br>
falling thereon. This embodiment offers the advantage that the detection signals gener-<br>
ated from the spectral components by the detection elements can be recorded simulta-<br>
neously, which allows a high recording speed or repetition rate of the measurement, in<br>
particular in comparison with CCD arrays. In particular, the detection elements can be<br>
readable independently of each other or generate detection signals independently of<br>
each other.<br>
[0040] In this case it is particularly preferable that the apparatus according to one of<br>
the two alternatives has an evaluation device connected to the detection elements via<br>
signal connections which records detection signals formed by means of the detection<br>
elements, in parallel. Such an apparatus can preferably be used to record at least one<br>
spectrum, preferably a temporal sequence of spectra, after emission of only one pulse,<br>
which is advantageous in particular for analyzing luminescence phenomena.<br>
[0041] It proves to be very advantageous here if the evaluation device records<br>
detection signals from the detection elements of the detection device in dependence on<br>
a signal which represents the output of a pulse of illumination radiation onto the re-<br>
cording area. This permits an analysis of luminescence, for example of a bank note, to<br>
be effected very simply and at the same time exactly, since the time interval between<br>
pulse output and recording can be specified.<br>
[0042] To permit a reduction of the signal-to-noise ratios of the detection by extra-<br>
neous radiation to be limited or even avoided, there is disposed in the apparatuses ac-<br>
cording to the two alternatives, preferably in the detection beam path between the re-<br>
cording area and the spatially dispersing optical device, a filter which suppresses ra-<br>
diation in a given spectral range. The given spectral range can again be selected in de-<br>
pendence on the use of the apparatus. If the apparatus is used for example for measur-<br>
ing luminescence radiation or Raman radiation, the given spectral range can be for<br>
 <br>
<br>
example the spectral range of the excitation radiation with which the luminescence<br>
radiation or Raman radiation is excited. It is also possible,, however, to use filters that<br>
pass radiation only in a spectral range given by the spectral components to be detected<br>
but at least strongly attenuate radiation outside the range.<br>
[0043] Further, it is preferred in an apparatus according to one of the two alterna-<br>
tives that there is provided in the beam path between the recording area and a space<br>
formed by the two edge detection elements, or the collimating and focusing optic, a<br>
beam splitter by means of which part of the optical radiation from the recording area<br>
can be coupled out of a beam path to the collimating and focusing optic. This has the<br>
advantage that the radiation emanating from the recording area can not only be spec-<br>
trally analyzed, but also used at least partly for other analyses, for example for imaging<br>
purposes or for spectrum analysis of other spectral ranges not analyzable by means of<br>
the spectrographic device. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the above-<br>
mentioned filter is constituted by the beam splitter, which is accordingly configured<br>
for this purpose.<br>
[0044] Depending on the type of illumination, the apparatus does not necessarily<br>
have to possess an entrance slit or, more generally, an entrance diaphragm or another<br>
device performing the same function. However, the apparatus according to one of the<br>
two alternatives preferably has at least one component performing the function of an<br>
entrance diaphragm.<br>
[0045] Thus the apparatus can for example have an entrance diaphragm located in<br>
the plane of the detection elements at least approximatively, i.e. in the field depth<br>
range of the imaging elements disposed after the entrance slit along the beam path.<br>
Said entrance diaphragm can be provided as a separate component, but it is preferably<br>
constituted by the detection elements and/or one or more carriers for the detection<br>
elements. This results in a particularly simple structure. Upon use of a beam splitter or<br>
a beam-deflecting element in the detection beam path from the recording area to the<br>
dispersing device, the beam splitter or beam-deflecting element, for example a mirror,<br>
can likewise perform the function of the entrance slit. A particularly loss-free transfer<br>
of the detection radiation with simultaneous shielding from extraneous radiation can<br>
 <br>
be obtained in an apparatus according to one of the two alternatives preferably by a<br>
light guide for guiding the detection radiation being disposed in the detection beam<br>
path, the end thereof being disposed between the two edge detection elements. The end<br>
can preferably likewise perform the function of an entrance diaphragm. A light guide<br>
is understood here in particular also to mean any element for guiding and optionally<br>
also deflecting optical radiation which is recordable in a spectrally resolved manner by<br>
means of the dispersing device and the detection device. Depending on the execution<br>
of these devices, the light guide can thus be designed in particular also for guiding in-<br>
visible optical radiation in the infrared range.<br>
[0046] Although an illumination of the recording area with ambient light is funda-<br>
mentally conceivable, an apparatus according to one of the two alternatives preferably<br>
has a radiation source for emitting optical illumination radiation in at least one given<br>
wavelength range into the recording area. The illumination radiation can be used here<br>
as reflected light or transmitted light.<br>
[0047] An apparatus according to one of the two alternatives preferably has at<br>
least one semiconductor radiation source for illuminating the recording area. The use<br>
of semiconductor radiation sources has a number of advantages. Semiconductor radia-<br>
tion sources thus as a rule have a considerably longer life than other radiation sources.<br>
Moreover, they require less input power for emitting optical radiation of a given power<br>
and generate less waste heat, which considerably reduces the requirements for cooling<br>
the device. Furthermore, semiconductor radiation sources are available for different<br>
wavelength ranges, so that excitation radiation can be generated simply in given wave-<br>
length ranges. Semiconductor radiation sources to be used are for example light-<br>
emitting diodes or superluminescent diodes, but preferably semiconductor lasers.<br>
Semiconductor radiation sources are understood here to mean not only components<br>
based on inorganic semiconductors but also ones based on organic substances, in par-<br>
ticular OLEDs.<br>
[0048] Upon use of an illumination of the recording area in reflected light, the illu-<br>
mination radiation can fundamentally be radiated onto the value document at an incli-<br>
nation therefrom. However, it is preferred that there is disposed in the beam path from<br>
 <br>
the recording area to the spectrographic device a beam flitter via which optical radia-<br>
tion from the semiconductor radiation source passes, in particular is directed, into or<br>
onto the recording area. This has the advantage that the illumination radiation can be<br>
directed onto the value document orthogonally, so that less scattered radiation occurs<br>
that could hinder detection. It is particularly preferable to use a dichroic beam splitter<br>
for separating radiation in the area of the illumination radiation passing into the re-<br>
cording area from the detection radiation emanating from the value document and ar-<br>
ranged for spectral decomposition, in a given wavelength range, which can be selected<br>
for example in dependence on at least one optical feature of the value document. This<br>
increases the signal-to-noise ratio during detection.<br>
[0049] A further subject of the invention is an apparatus for processing value docu-<br>
ments with an inventive apparatus according to one of the two alternatives for analyz-<br>
ing value documents and a transport path for value documents to be processed which<br>
leads into and/or through the recording area. The transport path can have in particular<br>
a transport device for transporting the value documents, for example driven belts. In<br>
particular, processing apparatuses that can be used are apparatuses for counting and/or<br>
sorting bank notes, automatic tellers for accepting and dispensing value documents, in<br>
particular bank notes, and apparatuses for checking the authenticity of value docu-<br>
ments.<br>

[0051] Fig. 1 shows as an example of an apparatus for processing value docu-<br>
ments a bank-note sorting apparatus 1 with an analysis apparatus according to a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0052] The bank-note sorting apparatus 1 has in a housing 2 an input pocket 3 for<br>
bank notes BN into which bank notes BN to be processed can be supplied as bundles<br>
either manually or automatically, optionally after a previous debanding, and then form<br>
a stack there. The bank notes BN inserted into the input pocket 3 are removed singly<br>
from the stack by a singler 4 and transported by means of a transport device 5, which<br>
defines a transport path, through a sensor device 6 which serves to analyze the bank<br>
notes. The sensor device 6 has in this exemplary embodiment a plurality of sensor<br>
modules accommodated in a common housing. The sensor modules serve to check the<br>
 <br>
authenticity, state and nominal value of the checked bank notes BN. After traversing<br>
the sensor device 6 the checked bank notes BN are output in sorted fashion in depend-<br>
ence on the analysis results or test results of the sensor device 6 and on given sorting<br>
criteria via gates 7, which are in each case switchable back and forth between two dif-<br>
ferent positions via gate-switching signals, and associated spiral slot stackers 8 into<br>
output pockets 9, from which they can be either manually removed or automatically<br>
carried off. The control of the bank-note sorting apparatus 1, in particular the conver-<br>
sion of analysis signals from the sensor device 6 into gate-switching signals for the<br>
gates 7, is effected by means of a control device 10.<br>
[0053] As mentioned above, the sensor device 6 has in this exemplary embodiment<br>
different sensor modules, of which only the sensor module 11, an apparatus for analyz-<br>
ing value documents, in the example bank notes BN, according to a preferred em-<br>
bodiment of the invention, designated hereinafter as the analysis apparatus, is shown in<br>
the figures and described more exactly hereinafter. The sensor modules for recogniz-<br>
ing the state, i.e. the fitness for circulation, and the nominal value or denomination of<br>
the bank notes BN are usual sensor modules known to the person skilled in the art and<br>
therefore need not be described more precisely.<br>
[0054] The analysis apparatus 11 is designed in this exemplary embodiment for de-<br>
tecting and analyzing luminescence radiation which is excited upon illumination of<br>
given bank notes with optical radiation of a given wavelength, in the example in the<br>
infrared range of the spectrum.<br>
[0055] The analysis apparatus 11 has a sensor housing 12 with a disk 13 transparent<br>
to the optical radiation used for analysis, which seals a window to a recording area 14<br>
in which a bank note BN is at least partly located during an analysis. The sensor hous-<br>
ing 12 with the disk 13 is so configured and in particular sealed that unauthorized ac-<br>
cess to the components contained therein is not possible without damaging the sensor<br>
housing 12 and/or the disk 13.<br>
[0056] The recording area 14 delimited among other things by the arrangement and<br>
properties of the optical components of the analysis apparatus 11 is limited on the side<br>
opposite the sensor housing 12 by a fundamentally optional plate 33, so that a bank<br>
 <br>
note BN can be transported, by means of the transport device 5 not shown in Fig. 2,<br>
past the disk 13 in a direction T extending orthogonally to the drawing plane in Fig. 2.<br>
[0057] The analysis apparatus 11 has an illumination device 15 for emitting illumi-<br>
nation radiation into the recording area 14 and in particular onto a value document, in<br>
the example a bank note BN, located at least partly in the recording area 14, and a<br>
spectrographic device 16 for analysis and in particular spectrally resolved detection of<br>
optical radiation emanating from the recording area 14 or a value document therein. In<br>
the example, the detection radiation comprises luminescence radiation in a wavelength<br>
range given by the type of value document, for example infrared luminescence radia-<br>
tion. This optical radiation emanating from the recording area 14 in the direction of the<br>
disk 13 will be hereinafter also designated as detection radiation. A detection optic 17<br>
serves to couple optical radiation passing from the recording area 14 through the disk<br>
13 into the sensor housing 12, i.e. the detection radiation, into the spectrographic de-<br>
vice 16.<br>
[0058] The illumination device 15 has a semiconductor radiation source 18 in the<br>
form of a semiconductor laser which, in the example, emits optical radiation in the<br>
visible range, and an illumination optic. In other exemplary embodiments the semi-<br>
conductor laser can also be designed to emit radiation in the infrared range. The illu-<br>
mination optic possesses, in an illumination beam path, a first collimator optic 19 for<br>
forming an illumination beam or parallel illumination ray bundle 20 from the optical<br>
radiation emitted by the semiconductor radiation source 18, a dichroic beam splitter 21<br>
which is reflective to the radiation of the illumination beam or illumination ray bundle<br>
20 and deflects the illumination beam or illumination ray bundle 20 by 90°, in the ex-<br>
ample, onto the disk 13, and a first condenser optic 22 for focusing the illumination<br>
radiation through the disk 13 likewise constituting part of the illumination optic into<br>
the recording area 14, in particular a value document BN in the recording area 14.<br>
[0059] The detection optic 17 comprises, along a detection beam path extending<br>
from the recording area 14 or the value document BN therein to the spectrographic<br>
device 16 and thereinto, besides the disk 13 the first condenser optic 22 which gathers<br>
radiation emanating from a point on the value document BN in the recording area 14<br>
 <br>
into a parallel ray bundle, the beam splitter 21 which is transparent to the radiation to<br>
be supplied to the spectrographic device 16 but filters illumination radiation passing<br>
into the detection beam path as scattered radiation out of the detection beam path by<br>
reflection, and a second condenser optic 23 for focusing the parallel detection radiation<br>
onto an entrance opening of the spectrographic device 16. Between the second con-<br>
denser optic 23 and the spectrographic device 16 there are optionally disposed a filter<br>
24 for filtering undesirable spectral components out of the detection beam path, in par-<br>
ticular in the wavelength range of the illumination radiation, and a deflecting element<br>
25, in the example a mirror, for deflecting the detection radiation by a given angle, in<br>
the example 90°. In other exemplary embodiments, the filter 24 can be disposed in the<br>
parallel beam path before the second condenser optic 23. This has the advantage that<br>
interference filters can be simply used, for example.<br>
[0060] The spectrographic device 16 has an entrance diaphragm 26 with a dia-<br>
phragm opening 27 which is slit-shaped in the exemplary embodiment, whose longitu-<br>
dinal extension extends at least approximatively orthogonally to the plane defined by<br>
the detection beam path.<br>
[0061] Detection radiation entering through the diaphragm opening 27 is bundled<br>
by a collimating and focusing optic 28, which is achromatic in the example, of the<br>
spectrographic device 16. The collimating and focusing optic 28 is shown in the fig-<br>
ures only symbolically as a lens, but is actually frequently executed as a combination<br>
of lenses. That said optic is achromatic is understood to mean that it is corrected with<br>
respect to chromatic aberrations in the wavelength range in which the spectrographic<br>
device 16 works. A corresponding correction in other wavelength ranges is unneces-<br>
sary. The entrance diaphragm 26 and the collimating and focusing optic 28 are so dis-<br>
posed that the diaphragm opening 27 is located at least in good approximation in the<br>
caustic surface of the collimating and focusing optic 28 on the entrance-diaphragm<br>
side.<br>
[0062] The spectrographic device 16 further has a spatially dispersing device 29, in<br>
the example an optical grating, which decomposes incident detection radiation, i.e.<br>
 <br>
optical radiation coming from the recording area, at least partly into spectrally separate<br>
spectral components propagating in different directions according to the wavelength.<br>
[0063] A detection device 30 of the spectrographic device 16 is used for detection<br>
of the spectral components that is locally resolving in at least one spatial direction.<br>
Detection signals formed upon detection are supplied to an evaluation device 31 of the<br>
spectrographic device 16, which records the detection signals and performs a compari-<br>
son of the recorded spectrum with given spectra on the basis of the detection signals.<br>
The evaluation device 31 is connected to the control device 10 to transmit the result of<br>
the comparison thereto via corresponding signals.<br>
[0064] The spatially dispersing device 29 is, in the present example, a reflection<br>
grating with a line structure whose lines extend parallel to a plane through the longitu-<br>
dinal direction of the diaphragm opening 27 and an optical axis of the collimating and<br>
focusing optic 28. The line spacing is so selected that the detection radiation can be<br>
spectrally decomposed in a given spectral range, in the example in the infrared. The<br>
dispersing device 29 is for this purpose so aligned that the separate spectral compo-<br>
nents, in the example the first diffraction order, are focused by the collimating and fo-<br>
cusing optic 28 onto the detection device 30. To obtain as good a signal-to-noise ratio<br>
as possible, the line spacing and the position of the dispersing device 29 are so se-<br>
lected that spectrally undecomposed components of the detection radiation, in the ex-<br>
ample the zeroth diffraction order, do not fall into the collimating and focusing optic<br>
28 but onto a radiation trap not shown in the figures, for example a plate absorbent to<br>
the detection radiation.<br>
[0065] The detection device 30 has a row-type arrangement of detection elements<br>
32 for the spectral components, for example a row of CCD elements, which is aligned<br>
at least approximatively parallel to the direction of spatial splitting of the spectral<br>
components, i.e. here the surface S spanned by the spectral components, in this case<br>
more precisely a plane. The plane S is illustrated in Fig. 3 by a dashed line.<br>
[0066] To obtain as compact a structure as possible, the dispersing device 29 is<br>
firstly inclined in two directions from the detection device 30 and the direction of inci-<br>
dent detection radiation between the collimating and focusing optic and the reflective<br>
 <br>
component causing a folding of the beam path, here the dispersing device 29. Since the<br>
direction of the detection radiation between the collimating and focusing optic 28 and<br>
the reflective component, i.e. the dispersing device 29, extends parallel to the optical<br>
axis O of the collimating and focusing optic 28 in the exemplary embodiment, the pla-<br>
ne reflection grating 29 and thus also the line structure thereof is firstly inclined from<br>
the optical axis O of the collimating and focusing optic 28 in the plane of the detection<br>
beam path. Therefore the surface S, in the example a plane, generated by the spectral<br>
components is inclined by the angle β from the direction of the detection radiation or<br>
the optical axis O of the collimating and focusing optic at least in the area between the<br>
dispersing device 29 and the collimating and focusing optic 28. In particular, a normal<br>
onto the plane reflection grating 29 in the plane of the detection beam path is inclined<br>
by an angle |3 from the optical axis O of the collimating and focusing optic 28 (cf. Fig.<br>
3). Secondly, the dispersing device 16, more precisely the perpendicular of incidence<br>
for specular reflection, i.e. here the normal onto the plane of the line structure of the<br>
reflection grating 29, is inclined by an angle a from the direction of the detection ra-<br>
diation or the optical axis O between the collimating and focusing optic 28 and the<br>
dispersing device 29.<br>
[0067] Secondly, the row of detection elements 32 of the detection device 30 is dis-<br>
posed at least approximatively in a plane with the diaphragm opening 27 and in a di-<br>
rection orthogonal to the plane S defined by the directions of propagation of the spec-<br>
tral components, spaced from the diaphragm opening 27, in Fig. 3 above the dia-<br>
phragm opening 27. In Figures 2 and 3 the entrance diaphragm 26 and the receiving<br>
surfaces of the detection elements 32 are shown for clarity's sake spaced apart parallel<br>
to the focal plane of the collimating and focusing optic 28, but they are actually lo-<br>
cated substantially in a common plane in this example. The diaphragm opening 27 is<br>
located approximately in the middle of the row, regarded in the direction parallel to the<br>
row of detection elements 32.<br>
[0068] It thus also results, as to be taken from Fig. 2, that in the portion between the<br>
entrance diaphragm 26 and the collimating and focusing optic 28, i.e. in particular also<br>
immediately before the collimating and focusing optic 28, a geometric projection of<br>
the detection radiation coming from the recording area 14 onto a surface A spanned<br>
 <br>
and limited by the spectral components falling on the detection device 30, said surface<br>
being trapezoidal in this case, is located in said surface. This results in a particularly<br>
space-saving arrangement.<br>
[0069] In this exemplary embodiment, the detection device 30, the entrance dia-<br>
phragm 26, the collimating and focusing optic 28 and the dispersing device 29 are so<br>
configured and disposed that they are located in a circular cylindrical spatial area<br>
whose cylinder axis is given by the optical axis of the collimating and focusing optic<br>
28, and whose cylinder diameter by the diameter of the collimating and focusing optic<br>
28, or that of the lens or largest lens therein. The length of the circular cylindrical spa-<br>
tial area is preferably smaller than 50 mm, in the example 40 mm. There thus results a<br>
particularly small space requirement for the spectrographic device, while at the same<br>
time a large numerical aperture in comparison with the extension can be obtained.<br>
[0070] For optical analysis of a value document, here a bank note BN in the re-<br>
cording area 14, the value document is illuminated with illumination radiation, in the<br>
example optical radiation suitable for exciting luminescence radiation from the semi-<br>
conductor radiation source 18, and the optical radiation emanating from the value<br>
document, here luminescence radiation, is shaped by the detection optic 17 and the<br>
collimating and focusing optic 28 into a parallel detection ray bundle. The latter is de-<br>
composed at least partly into spectral components of different wavelengths which<br>
propagate in different directions in dependence on the wavelength. In Fig. 2 the zeroth<br>
diffraction order which is reflected without spectral splitting is shown by a continuous<br>
line, and spectral components given by the first diffraction order by dotted and dashed<br>
lines for two different wavelengths. The spectral components are focused by the colli-<br>
mating and focusing optic 28 onto the detection device 30, more precisely the row of<br>
detection elements 32, and detected thereby in spatially resolved fashion. Each detec-<br>
tion element 32 is associated with a direction of propagation and thus to a spectral<br>
component in dependence on the wavelength. The evaluation device 31 therefore<br>
forms in each case from the positions of the detection elements 32 and the particular<br>
intensities recorded thereby a spectrum which can then be compared with comparison<br>
spectrums.<br>
 <br>
[0071] A second preferred embodiment in Figures 4 and 5 differs from the first ex-<br>
emplary embodiment firstly in the type of dispersing device and secondly in the ar-<br>
rangement of the illumination device. The same reference signs are therefore used for<br>
the same components and the comments on the first exemplary embodiment apply ac-<br>
cordingly here too.<br>
[0072] Instead of the plane reflection grating 29 there is now used a blazed grating<br>
29' whose steps are so inclined that the first diffraction order arises in the direction of<br>
specular reflection. This permits a higher intensity of the spectral components to be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0073] In the first exemplary embodiment the illumination device can fundamen-<br>
tally be rotated around the optical axis of the first condenser optic 22 without the func-<br>
tion changing. To permit as compact a design as possible to be obtained, the semicon-<br>
ductor radiation source 18 and the collimator optic 19 are therefore disposed beside the<br>
collimating and focusing optic 28 in this exemplary embodiment.<br>
[0074] Further exemplary embodiments differ from the first and second exemplary<br>
embodiments in that instead of the deflecting element 25 a deflecting element 25' is<br>
used which replaces the entrance diaphragm 26. A corresponding modification of the<br>
first exemplary embodiment is shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Therein the same reference<br>
signs as in the first exemplary embodiment are used for the same elements and the<br>
comments thereon in the first exemplary embodiment apply here too. The deflecting<br>
element 25' is now a mirror of the size of the diaphragm opening 27 in the first exem-<br>
plary embodiment and disposed in the focal plane of the collimating and focusing op-<br>
tic 28.<br>
[0075] Further preferred embodiments differ from the above-described embodi-<br>
ments in that the detection device 30 and the entrance diaphragm 26 are integrated. For<br>
this purpose the diaphragm opening is configured in a circuit board which also bears<br>
the detection elements 32.<br>
 <br>
[0076] In other exemplary embodiments the illumination device 15 possesses as a<br>
radiation source, instead of the laser diode 18, a light-emitting diode, a superlumines-<br>
cent diode or an OLED.<br>
[0077] Further, the illumination device 15 can, in other exemplary embodiments,<br>
have at least two semiconductor radiation sources which emit optical radiation at dif-<br>
ferent centroid wavelengths, i.e. the average across the emission wavelengths weighted<br>
with the emission intensity, and are switchable on and off independently of each other.<br>
This permits analyses at different wavelengths to be performed successively.<br>
[0078] In other preferred exemplary embodiments, the entrance diaphragm 26 can<br>
be completely omitted. The illumination device 15 is then so configured that it illumi-<br>
nates only a narrow, elongate area in the recording area, for which purpose the first<br>
condenser optic 19 can contain a cylindrical lens.<br>
[0079] Further exemplary embodiments differ from the above-described exemplary<br>
embodiments in that further lenses are disposed in the detection beam path for reduc-<br>
ing aberrations through the elements of the detection optic and the collimating and fo-<br>
cusing optic 28 or improving the illumination.<br>
[0080] Further exemplary embodiments differ from the above-described exemplary<br>
embodiments in that the deflecting element 25 or 25' is a beam splitter, so that compo-<br>
nents of the detection radiation passing therethrough can be coupled out for example<br>
for producing an image of the value document.<br>
[0081] In further exemplary embodiments, an illumination in transmission can also<br>
be used.<br>
[0082] Further, it is not absolutely necessary to use a reflective dispersing optical<br>
device, such as the reflection grating 29. It is thus possible in a further exemplary em-<br>
bodiment, which differs from the exemplary embodiment in Figs. 6 and 7 only in this<br>
regard, to dispose in the detection beam path after the collimating and focusing optic<br>
28 a transmission grating 29" which decomposes the detection radiation at least partly<br>
into spectral components. The spectral components can then be reflected into the col-<br>
 <br>
limating and focusing optic 28 by means of at least one reflective component 34, for<br>
example a mirror, which is inclined against the plane spanned by the spectral compo-<br>
nents.<br>
[0083] The folding of the beam path after the collimating and focusing optic makes<br>
it possible to obtain a considerably more compact design than in an also possible appa-<br>
ratus wherein a focusing optic and the detection device are disposed behind the trans-<br>
mission grating instead of the mirror.<br>
[0084] In other exemplary embodiments, the sensor housing 12 and/or the plate 33<br>
can also be configured differently or completely omitted.<br>
[0085] Further, in other exemplary embodiments the evaluation device 31 can be in-<br>
tegrated into the control device 10.<br>
[0086] Other preferred embodiments differ from the above-described exemplary<br>
embodiments in that the detection device has, instead of a row of CCD elements, a<br>
row-type arrangement of photodetection elements, for example CMOS elements, or<br>
photodetection elements for detecting optical radiation in other wavelength ranges.<br>
[0087] An exemplary embodiment for such an analysis apparatus, which can be<br>
used like all other described analysis apparatuses for example in the apparatus for<br>
processing value documents in Fig. 1, is shown in Figures 10 to 12.<br>
[0088] The analysis apparatus 11" differs from the analysis apparatus 11 in Fig. 1,<br>
besides the type of detection elements, in that the detection beam path now passes be-<br>
tween two edge detection elements of a detection device to reach the dispersing de-<br>
vice. In particular, the analysis apparatuses differ only in that the detection device 30 is<br>
replaced by a detection device 34, the deflecting element 25 by a light guide 35 and<br>
the evaluation device 31 by a modified evaluation device 31'. Furthermore, the dis-<br>
persing device 29 is aligned differently relative to the detection device 30. Since the<br>
analysis apparatus otherwise does not differ from that of the first exemplary embodi-<br>
ment, the same reference signs are used for the same components and the statements<br>
 <br>
thereon in the description of the first exemplary embodiment apply accordingly here<br>
too.<br>
[0089] The detection device 34 shown more precisely in Fig. 12 now has a carrier<br>
36, in the example a ceramic substrate, on which first detection elements 37 are dis-<br>
posed in a first row-type arrangement 39, and second detection elements 38 in a sec-<br>
ond row-type arrangement 39'. In this exemplary embodiment the detection elements<br>
37 and 38 are disposed along only one straight line. In Fig. 12 below the detection<br>
elements 37 or 38 there are located contacting elements 40 connected electrically to<br>
the detection elements via an amplifier stage configured on the carrier, and connected<br>
to signal connections to form evaluation circuits or evaluation devices.<br>
[0090] The detection elements 37 and 38 are located on opposite sides of a recess or<br>
opening 41, which is configured rectangularly in this exemplary embodiment, in the<br>
carrier 36. Between the two edge detection elements 42 and 43 there is thus a gap.<br>
[0091] The detection elements 37 differ from the detection elements 38 by their<br>
spectral detection range.<br>
[0092] The detection elements 37 are detection elements for detecting optical radia-<br>
tion in the visible spectrum and in the near infrared, i.e. up to a wavelength of 1100<br>
run. They have in this exemplary embodiment a useful spectral detection range be-<br>
tween 400 nm and 1100 nm. It is possible to use for example silicon-based detection<br>
elements here.<br>
[0093] The detection elements 38 are detection elements for detecting optical radia-<br>
tion in the infrared. The useful spectral detection range thereof is between 900 nm and<br>
1700 nm in the exemplary embodiment. It is possible to use for example InGaAs-<br>
based detection elements here, which are sensitive in the spectral range above 900 nm.<br>
[0094] The detection elements 37 and 38 are so disposed relative to the dispersing<br>
device 29 that spectral components from the dispersing device with wavelengths above<br>
900 nm are directed onto the detection elements 38 and those with wavelengths below<br>
900 nm onto the detection elements 37.<br>
 <br>
[0095] In comparison with CCD arrays, only a considerably smaller number of de-<br>
tection elements 37 or 38, for example between ten and thirty, are used, but they pos-<br>
sess a larger detection area and a reduced proportion of non-photosensitive areas. The<br>
detection area is determined here by only optical radiation impinging thereon being<br>
recorded.<br>
[0096] The detection areas preferably have a surface area of at least 0.1 mm2; in the<br>
example they have a height of 2 mm and a width of 1 mm, whereby non-<br>
photosensitive areas between adjacent detection elements have an extension of about<br>
50 µm.<br>
[0097] In this exemplary embodiment the detection elements 37 and 38 are readable<br>
singly independently of each other and in particular in parallel.<br>
[0098] In this exemplary embodiment, the abovementioned amplifier stage com-<br>
prises for this purpose an analog-digital converter for each of the detection elements,<br>
which converts analog signals from the particular detection element into a digital de-<br>
tection signal which represents the intensity of the radiation that has fallen on the de-<br>
tection area.<br>
[0099] In the detection beam path there is disposed the light guide 35 made of a<br>
suitable transparent material, which guides entering detection radiation at least in the<br>
spectral range detectable by the analysis apparatus and deflects it in the direction of the<br>
dispersing device 29.<br>
[0100] One end 44 of the light guide 35 through which the detection radiation exits<br>
therefrom is disposed in the opening 41 and thus in the caustic surface of the collimat-<br>
ing and focusing optic 28. The detection beam path therefore extends between the two<br>
edge detection elements 42 and 43. The exit surface or the end 44 of the light guide 35<br>
constitutes an entrance diaphragm or an entrance slit for the spectrographic device.<br>
[0101] The light guide 35 is aligned relative to the optical axis O of the collimating<br>
and focusing optic 28 such that the radiation emitted through the end 44, averaged<br>
across the ray-bundle cross section, extends at least approximatively parallel to the<br>
 <br>
optical axis O and orthogonally to the surface of the carrier 36 and in.particular to the<br>
row-type arrangements of the detection elements.<br>
[0102] As recognizable in Fig. 11, the dispersing device 29, in particular the grating<br>
lines thereof, are aligned orthogonally to the optical axis O in the plane shown in Fig.<br>
11. In the plane shown in Fig. 10 orthogonal to the plane in Fig. 11, in contrast, the<br>
line structure given by the grating lines is inclined against the optical axis O.<br>
[0103] The spectral components generated by the dispersing device 29 are therefore<br>
focused by the collimating and focusing optic 28 onto the detection device 34, more<br>
precisely the detection elements 37 and 38, which then detect the corresponding spec-<br>
tral components.<br>
[0104] By the selected arrangement of light guide 35, collimating and focusing op-<br>
tic 28, dispersing device 29 and detection device 34 it is achieved that the detection<br>
beam path extends parallel or partly in the surface determined by the spectral compo-<br>
nents which are generated by means of the dispersing device 29.<br>
[0105] The angle a is selected here so that a spectral component according to a<br>
given wavelength, in this example given by the application for luminescence meas-<br>
urements, the excitation wavelength for the luminescence, is focused into the gap be-<br>
tween the two edge detection elements 42 and 43 and thus not detected.<br>
[0106] As an option, the evaluation device 31' is modified relative to the evaluation<br>
device 31 firstly in that the detection signals from the detection elements or the detec-<br>
tion device are recordable substantially in parallel. Substantially in parallel is under-<br>
stood here to mean that the detection signals can differ in their time slots at least inso-<br>
far as is necessary for the transfer to the evaluation device 311 for example by means of<br>
multiplexing via a bus.<br>
[0107] Further, the evaluation device 31' is configured to record the detection sig-<br>
nals from the detection device 34 upon a pulse output signal for the semiconductor<br>
radiation source 18 after a period of time given in dependence on the expected lumi-<br>
nescence.<br>
 <br>
[0108] The thereby permitted parallel readout of the detection elements 37 and 38<br>
permits short integration times and in particular a high repetition frequency of the<br>
measurements. This measure likewise contributes to an increase in the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio.<br>
[0109] In particular, this analysis apparatus can be used for carrying out a so-called<br>
single-shot measurement by which a single measurement of the spectral properties of<br>
the luminescence radiation is carried out upon only one illumination or excitation<br>
pulse, said measurement having a precision sufficient for evaluation.<br>
[0110] Further, the evaluation device 31' can optionally be so configured that the<br>
analysis apparatus can be used for recording multiply in time sequence the detection<br>
signals from the detection elements and thus a plurality of spectra after output of an<br>
excitation pulse by the semiconductor radiation source, and thus for carrying out an<br>
evaluation of the time development of the spectrum.<br>
[0111] Yet another embodiment in Fig. 13 differs from the last-described exemplary<br>
embodiment in Figures 10 to 12 only in that the collimating and focusing optic 28 and<br>
the dispersing device 29 in the form of a plane reflection grating are replaced by an<br>
imaging dispersing element 45 which performs the function thereof. All other parts<br>
and components are unchanged so that the same reference signs are used therefor and<br>
the statements on the last exemplary embodiment apply here too.<br>
[0112] The imaging dispersing element now used is a holographic grating 45 which<br>
images the entrance diaphragm 44, in the example the end 44 of the light guide 35,<br>
onto the detection elements 37 or 38 in a spectrally resolved manner.<br>
[0113] The imaging grating 45 has in the example preferably more than about 300,<br>
particularly preferably more than about 500, lines per mm, i.e. diffraction elements, to<br>
permit a sufficient dispersion of the luminescence radiation onto the detector element<br>
21 despite the compact structure. The distance between imaging grating 45 and the<br>
detection device 34 is preferably less than about 70 mm, particularly preferably less<br>
than about 50 mm.<br>
 <br>
[0114] In other exemplary embodiments, it can also be provided that individual de-<br>
tection elements 45 have different dimensions, in particular in the dispersion direction<br>
of the spectral components, as shown in Fig. 14 by way of example. Since normally<br>
not all wavelengths of the spectrum or only wavelength ranges of equal width are<br>
evaluated, but rather selectively only individual wavelengths or wavelength ranges<br>
also of different width, the detection elements can be designed to be adapted in their<br>
width, parallel to the plane defined by the spectral components, to the particular wave-<br>
lengths or wavelength ranges to be evaluated.<br>
[0115] In yet other exemplary embodiments, in particular in ones where a collimat-<br>
ing and focusing optic is used, there can be disposed before the detection device or a<br>
row of detection elements a cylindrical lens which focuses detection radiation onto the<br>
detection elements and whose cylinder axis is aligned for this purpose parallel to the<br>
row.<br>
[0116] By means of such a cylindrical lens the portion of the recording area used for<br>
detection can be enlarged in a direction corresponding to a direction orthogonal to the<br>
cylinder axis of the cylindrical lens, thereby increasing the intensity available for de-<br>
tection.<br>
