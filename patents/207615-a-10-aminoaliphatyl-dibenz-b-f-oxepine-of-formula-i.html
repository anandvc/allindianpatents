Some of the compounds of formula I proposed for use in accordance with the invention are already known. For example there are proposed in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 1 793 521 as adrenolytic and central nervous system-dampening active ingredients of medicaments, such as sedative and narcosis-potentiating active ingredients of medicaments, compounds of formula I wherein alk is methylene or ethylidene and R is amino, methylamino, ethylamino, propylamine, isopropylamino, butylamino, isobutylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, dipropylamino, pyrrolidine, piperidino, morpholino, N'-methyl-piperazino, N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazino, N'-(2-acetoxyethyl)piperazino, N'-(2-pivaloyl-oxyethyl)piperazino or N'-methylhomopiperazino and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and/or halogen.<br>
The invention is based on the surprising discovery that compounds of formula I, at doses of approximately 0.1 mg/kg s.c. and below administered to newborn rats in an experimental procedure according to Ausari et aL, J. Neuroscience 13, 4042-4053 (1993), exhibit a pronounced protective action on facial motor neurons against apoptotic necrocytosis and, after the administration of 0.275 mg/kg s.c. and below to fully grown rats in an experimental procedure according to Golowitz and Paterson, Soc. Neurosc. Abstr. 20, 246, 113.2 (1994), exhibit a pronounced protective action on hippocampus pyramidal cells for a period of 4 days against necrocytosis caused by the administration of kainic acid.<br>

themselves, to processes for the preparation thereof and to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising them.<br>
The process for the preparation of novel compounds of formula I comprises a) condensing a compound of formula II<br><br>
with a compound of formula III<br>
Y-R	(III)<br>
wherein one of the radicals X and Y is reactive esterified hydroxy and the other is free or temporarily protected amino, and R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined hereinbefore, and removing again the amino-protecting group that may have been temporarily introduced, or<br><br><br>
wherein alk' is a lower alkylene group substituted by oxo or by free or esterified hydroxy, reducing the group alk' with replacement of the oxygen function to form the corresponding group alk<br>
and, if desired, in each case converting a compound obtainable in accordance with the process into a different compound of formula I, separating a mixture of isomers obtainable in accordance with the process into its components and isolating the desired isomer, and/or converting a salt obtainable in accordance with the process into the free compound or converting a free compound obtainable in accordance with the process into a salt.<br>
Reactive esterified hydroxy in starting materials of formulae 11 and III in accordance with process variant a) is, for example, hydroxy esterified with a hydrohalic acid or an organic sulfonic acid, such as halogen, for example chlorine, bromine or iodine, or unsubstituted or lower-alkyi-, halo- and/or nitro-substituted benzenesulfonyloxy, such as benzenesulfonyl-oxy, p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy or p-toluenesulfonyloxy, or lower alkanesulfonyloxy, such as methanesulfonyloxy.<br>
The reaction of compounds of formulae II and III is carried out in customary manner, for example in the presence of a basic condensing agent, such as a tertiary or sterically hindered binary organic nitrogen base, such as a tri-lower alkylamine or sterically hindered di-lower alkylamine, such as triethylamine or diisopropylamine, or a heteroaromatic base, such as pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine, advantageously in an organic solvent, such as toluene, and, if necessary, with cooling or heating, for example in a temperature range of from approximately 0° to approximately 80'C.<br>
Suitable amino-protecting groups for the intermediate protection of primary amino groups are customary amino-protecting groups, especially amino-protecting groups that can be removed by solvolysis. Such groups are, for example, acyl groups derived from a carboxylic<br><br>
acid or from a semi-ester of carbonic acid, such as unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkanoyl, for example lower alkanoyl, such as formyl, acetyl or pivaloyl, polyhalo-lower alkanoyl, such as trifluoroacetyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxy-carbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl, or unsubstituted or substituted phenyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as benzyloxycarbonyl, and also silyl groups, such as tri-lower alkylsilyl, for example trimethylsilyl.<br>
The removal of those amino-protecting groups is carried out in customary manner, for example by treatment with a solvolysis agent, such as water in the presence of an acid, for example an aqueous mineral acid, such as a hydrohalic acid, or an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide solution or potassium hydroxide solution or, especially for the removal of tri-lower alkoxycarbonyl, a sulfonic acid, such as methanesulfonic acid in a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane, or, especially for the removal of formyl, a suitable silyl compound, such as a tri-lower alkylsilyl halide, such as trimethylsilyl bromide, or a disilazane, such as hexamethyldisilazane.<br>
The starting materials of formulae II and III are known or can be prepared analogously to the method of preparation of known compounds of formulae II and III.<br>
For example, compounds of formula II wherein alk is methylene and X is reactively esterified hydroxy are obtained, for example, as follows: compounds of formulae V and VI<br><br>
wherein Xi is halogen and X2 is hydrogen or hydroxy, are condensed with one another in customary manner, the condensation being carried out preferably in a temperature range of from approximately 100°C to approximately 180'C and, when using as starting materials compounds of formula V wherein X2 is hydroxy and Xi is, for example, chlorine, preferably in the presence of copper/copper(l) iodide and, when using as starting materials compounds of formula V wherein X2 is hydrogen and Xi is, for example, fluorine, preferably<br><br>
in the presence of potassium carbonate in dimethylacetamide, the group --C(=P)-Xi in a resulting compound of formula VII<br><br>
is reduced to hydroxymethyl in customary manner, for example by treatment with a di-light metal hydride, such as lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran, the hydroxymethyl group is converted into halomethyl in customary manner, for example by heating with a hydrohalic acid, especially hydrobromic acid, the halogen atom is replaced by cyano in customary manner, for example by treatment with an alkali metal cyanide, such as sodium cyanide in ethanol, and the resulting compound of formula VIII<br><br>
is reacted in customary manner, for example in the presence of an alkali metal alkanolate, such as sodium methanolate, with an oxalic acid di-lower alkyl ester, for example diethyl oxalate, worked up under acidic conditions, and the carboxy group in the resulting compound of formula IX<br><br>
is reduced to hydroxymethyl in customary manner, for example by treatment with a haloformic acid ester, such as isobutyl chloroformate, in the presence of a nitrogen base, such as N-methylmorpholine, preferably in an ethereal solvent, such as dimethoxymethane.<br><br>
and then with a di-light metal hydride, such as sodium borohydride in water, and the resulting compound of formula X<br><br>
is treated with an agent that introduces the group X, such as a hydrohalic acid or a sulfonyl halide, such as methanesulfonyl chloride.<br>
Higher homologues of compounds of formula II wherein alk is ethylene, propylene etc. or ethylidene, propylidene etc. may be obtained by, for example, at the stage of the acid IX, either carrying out a chain lengthening in customary manner or converting the carboxy group into the desired 1-oxoalkyl group in customary manner.<br>
Compounds of formula II wherein X is free or protected amino can be obtained, for example, from the reactive esters obtained as described above, by customary saturated solution of ammonia in methanol and, if desired, subsequent introduction of the amino-protecting group in customary manner.<br>
In starting materials of formula IV according to process variant b). esterified hydroxy is, for example, hydroxy esterified with a carboxylic acid or with a semiester of carbonic acid, such as unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkanoyloxy, for example lower alkanoyloxy. such as formyloxy, acetyloxy or pivaloyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyloxy, such as methoxycarbonyloxy, ethoxycarbonyloxy, isopropyloxycarbonyloxy or tert-butyloxycarbonyloxy, or unsubstituted or substituted phenyl-lower alkoxycarbonyloxy, such as benzyloxycarbonyloxy.<br>
The reduction of compounds of formula IV is carried out in customary manner, for example by treatment with a di-light metal hydride, such as lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran.<br><br>
starting materials of formula IV wherein alk' is co-oxo-lower aikyi bonded to the group R in the co-position can be obtained, for example, from the corresponding acids of formula IX or the homologues thereof by reaction with an amine of formula III, wherein Y is free or temporarily protected amino, in customary manner, for example by treatment with an acid halogenating agent, such as oxalyl chloride in the presence of dimethylformamide. It is then possible from those starting materials, by means of partial reduction and, if desired, esterification, to obtain the corresponding compounds of formula IV wherein alk' is lower alkylene substituted by free or esterified hydroxy. Starting materials of formula IV wherein alk' is (co-l)-oxo-lower alky! bonded to the group R in the co-position can be obtained, for<br>
example, from the corresponding methyl ketones by halogenation, for example by means of N-bromo- or N-chloro-succinimide, and subsequent reaction with an amine of formula II wherein Y is free or temporarily protected amino.<br>
Compounds obtainable in accordance with the process may be converted in customary manner into different compounds of formula I.<br>
For example, in compounds of formula I wherein R is unsubstituted amino, the amino group may be substituted in customary manner by one or two identical or different monovalent aliphatic or araliphatic radicals or by a divalent aliphatic radical. In an analogous manner, it is also possible in compounds of formula I wherein R is amino substituted by a monovalent aliphatic or araliphatic radical to introduce a further monovalent aliphatic or araliphatic radical.<br>
Resulting salts may be converted in a manner known perse into the free compounds, for example by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, a metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, or with another salt-forming base mentioned at the beginning or with an acid, such as a mineral acid, for example hydrochloric acid, or another salt-forming add mentioned at the beginning.<br>
Resulting salts may be converted in a manner known perse into different salts, for example acid addition salts may be converted by treatment with a suitable metal salt, such as a sodium, barium or silver salt, of a different acid, in a suitable solvent in which an inorganic salt that forms is insoluble and is thus eliminated from the reaction equilibrium, and basic<br><br>
salts may be converted into different salts by freeing the free acid and converting into a salt again.<br>
The compounds of formula I, including their salts, may also be obtained in the form of hydrates, or may include the solvent used for their crystallisation.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and in the form of their salts, hereinbefore and hereinafter any reference to the free compounds and their salts should be understood as including optionally also the corresponding salts and free compounds, respectively, as appropriate and expedient.<br>
Resulting mixtures of diastereoisomers and mixtures of racemates can be separated in known manner into the pure diastereoisomers and racemates on the basis of the physico-chemical differences between the constituents, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation. Resulting racemates can also be separated into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent, with the aid of microorganisms or by reaction of the resulting mixture of diastereoisomers or racemate with an optically active auxiliary compound, for example according to the acidic, basic or functionally modifiable groups present in compounds of formula I with an optically active acid, base or an optically active alcohol, to form mixtures of diastereoisomeric salts or functional derivatives, such as esters, and separation thereof into the diastereoisomers from which the desired enantiomer can be freed in the appropriate customary manner. Examples of suitable bases, acids and alcohols are optically active alkaloid bases, such as strychnine, cinchonine or brucine. or D- or L-(1-phenyl)ethylamine, 3-pipecoline, ephedrine, amphetamine and similar synthetically obtainable bases, optically active carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as quinic acid or D- or L-tartaric acid, D- or L-di-o-toluoyltartaric acid, D- or L-malic acid, D- or L-mandelic acid or D- or L-camphorsulfonic acid, or optically active alcohols, such as borneol or D- or L-(1-phenyl)ethanol.<br>
The invention relates also to those forms of the process in which a compound obtainable as intermediate at any stage of the process is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or in which a starting material is used in the form of a salt or, especially, is formed under the reaction conditions.<br><br>
The invention relates also to the novel starting materials developed specifically for the preparation of the compounds of the invention, especially to those starting materials resulting in the compounds of formula I that were described at the beginning as being preferred, to processes for the preparation thereof and to their use as intermediates.<br>
This relates, for example, to amides of formula IV wherein alk' is co-oxo-lower alkyl bonded to the group R in the co-position, especially carbonyl, and to salts thereof, as well as to processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
The invention accordingly relates also to novel compounds of formula IVa<br><br>
wherein<br>
R is an amino group that is unsubstituted or mono- or di-substituted by monovalent aliphatic<br>
and/or araliphatic radicals or disubstituted by divalent aliphatic radicals and<br>
R1, R2. R3 and R4 are each, independently of the others, hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy,<br>
halogen or trifluoromethyl,<br>
and to salts thereof as well as to processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
The invention relates preferably to those compounds of formula IVa resulting in the compounds of formula I that were described at the beginning as being preferred, and to salts thereof as well as to processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
The process for the preparation of novel compounds of formula IVa comprises reacting a compound of formula IX<br><br><br>

The invention also relates preferably to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of formula I according to the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as active ingredients, and to processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention, which comprise a compound according to the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are pharmaceutical compositions for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to warmblooded animal(s) that comprise the pharmacological active ingredient alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The daily dose of the active ingredient depends on the age and the individual condition as well as on the mode of administration.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical compositions comprise, for example, from approximately 10 % to approximately 80 %, preferably from approximately 20 % to approximately 60 %, active ingredient. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention for enteral or parenteral<br><br>
administration are, for example, in unit dose form, such as in the form of dragees, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and also ampoules. They are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophilising processes. For example, pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, if desired granulating a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary, after the addition of appropriate excipients, into tablets or dragee cores.<br>
Suitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and also binders, such as starch pastes using, for example, com. wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl-cellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, if desired disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Excipients are especially flow agents, flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings, there being used, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arable, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.<br>
Other orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are hard gelatin capsules and also soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticiser. such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard gelatin capsules may comprise the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants. such as talc or magnesium stearate, and if desired with stabilisers. In soft capsules the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, it likewise being possible for stabilisers to be added.<br><br>
Suitable rectally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient with a suppository base material. Suitable suppository base materials are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols. Gelatin rectal capsules that comprise a combination of the active ingredient with a base material may also be used. Suitable base materials include, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols and paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
There are suitable for parenteral administration by infusion and/or injection especially aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example in the form of a water-soluble salt, and also suspensions of the active ingredient, such as corresponding oily suspensions, there being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or aqueous suspensions that comrpise viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and optionally also stabilisers.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredient depends on the species of warm-blooded animal, the age and the individual condition and also on the mode of administration. Normally the estimated approximate daily dose in the case of oral administration to a patient weighing approximately 75 kg is from approximately 10 mg to approximately 500 mg.<br>
