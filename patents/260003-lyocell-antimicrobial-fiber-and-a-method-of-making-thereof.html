A LYOCELL ANTIMICROBIAL FIBER AND A METHOD OF MAKING<br>
THEREOF<br>
ADITYA BIRLA SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD.<br>
an Indian Company of Aditya Birla Center, 2nd floor, C Wing, S. K. Ahire Marg, Mumbai 400 025,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to textile fibers.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The term "fiber" or "textile fiber" means a substance which is capable of being spun into a yarn or made into a fabric by bonding or by interlacing in a variety of methods including weaving, knitting, braiding, felting, twisting, or webbing, and which is the basic structural element of textile products.<br>
Fibers are classified on the basis of their length such as short fibers or staple fiber and long fibers or filament fiber. The fibers can also be classified on the basis of their origin such as natural fibers and man-made fibers. The term natural fibers means any fiber that exists as such in the natural state e.g. vegetable fibers or wood fibers. The other type of fibers is obtained from chemical substances. These are called man made fibers. They are polyester, nylon, acrylic (cashmilon) etc. For centuries, mankind has relied upon various plants and animals to provide raw materials for fabrics and clothing. In recent times, the industrialization and scientific advancement has provided several improved materials having far superior properties, particularly suitable for clothing.<br>
Lyocell is a manmade fiber derived from cellulose. Though it is related to , viscose is obtained by a solvent spinning technique. The solvent spinning technique, which is simpler and more environmentally sound, since it uses a non¬toxic solvent chemical that can be recycled in the manufacturing process. It is an extremely strong fabric with industrial uses such as in automotive filters, ropes, abrasive materials, bandages and protective suiting material. It is primarily found in the garment industry, particularly in women's clothing.<br>
2<br><br>
Lyocell fibers are prepared by following process steps:<br>
The raw cellulose is dissolved into heated, pressurized vessel filled with an amine<br>
oxide solvent.<br>
After soaking for a short time in the solvent at high temperature under vacuum to<br>
remove excess water, the cellulose forms a clear solution and then it is filtered.<br>
The solution is then pumped through spinneret which is pierced with small holes<br>
to obtain long strands of fibers. The fibers are then immersed in another dilute<br>
solution of amine oxide. This helps to set the fiber strands. Then, they are washed<br>
with de-mineralized water.<br>
The lyocell fibers are then led to a drying area, where the water is evaporated<br>
from it. The strands are led to a finishing area, where the lubricant is applied.<br>
The dried, finished fibers are at this stage are called as a tow, which is a large<br>
untwisted bundle of continuous length filaments. Tne'bundles ol tow are taken to<br>
a crimper, a machine which compresses the fiber, giving it texture and bulk. The<br>
crimped fiber is then carded by mechanical carders, which perform an action like<br>
combing, to separate and order the strands. The carded strands are cut and baled<br>
for shipment to a fabric mill.<br>
The amine oxide used to dissolve the cellulose formed set the fiber after spinning is<br>
recovered and re-used in the manufacturing process.<br>
From the spun or filament yarn, fabric is formed by knitting or weaving operations. Knitted fabrics can be made by using hooked needles to interlock one or more sets of yarns through a set of loops. The loops may be either loosely or closely constructed, depending on the purpose of the fabric. Knitted fabrics can be used for hosiery, underwear, sweaters, slacks, suits, coats, rugs and other home furnishings. Knitting is performed using either weft or warp processes.<br>
3<br><br>
Some typical preparations that are involved in the weaving operations are warping, slashing or sizing. Sizing agents are added to the yarn by solution or pad/dry techniques. Differences in raw materials, processing chemicals, fiber diameter, post treatments and blend ratios can be manipulated to produce a fiber having customized properties suitable for desired application. It is often desired that the lyocell fabrics possess typical properties such as thermal stability, ability to retain perfumes, antibacterial properties and the like. These properties are essential in several industrial as well as household applications. There has been a considerable interest in developing such materials. In order to impart various desirable properties to the fabric as mentioned above to the fabric, several additives are added. Such additives include antimicrobial agents, deodorizing agents, antistatic agents, perfumes. Besides such specific additives, generic additives for improving overall quality of the fabric, such as sizing agents, additives for increasing yarn softness and pliability are also added.<br>
Prior art:<br>
US patent 6436419 discloses a process that involves dyeing a polymer with an acid dye to form a dye coated polymer, and attaching an antimicrobial agent like quaternary ammonium salt, thereby making said polymer antimicrobial.<br>
A method for producing an antimicrobial effect in biodegradable textile article containing cellulosic material is disclosed in US 20050225002. Lyocell fibers constitute at least 10 % by weight of the textile article. It is reported that in case of use of Lyocell fibers in the textile, the growth of microorganisms is delayed or prevented, respectively, in comparison with other cellulosic fibers such as cotton or viscose fibers.<br>
4<br><br>
Earlier known processes of incorporating such additives, as reported in the above mentioned patents/applications, mainly involved conventional methods like spraying, solvent spinning the additives on the fabric. However, these methods suffer from several disadvantages which include non-uniform and improper adhesion of additives onto the fiber material, waning and gradual washing out of the additives over a period of time and which further affects the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
There is thus felt a need for a process of incorporating additives to fabric which overcomes these shortcomings.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide antimicrobial lyocell fibers, wherein at least one antimicrobial constituent is incorporated into the body of the fiber.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents into lyocell fibers which ensures uniform distribution of the antimicrobial constituent throughout the fiber length.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide antimicrobial lyocell fibers wherein the antimicrobial constituents are retained in the lyocell product over a prolonged period of time.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents to lyocell fibers which does not alter the feel and texture of the fabric.<br>
5<br><br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process of incorporating antimicrobial constituents to lyoceli fibers such that inherent properties of the lyoceli fibers such as fiber strength, linear density, tenacity, heat resistance, dyeability and drying properties are not altered.<br>

The non-ionic or anionic surfactant is selected such that the lipophilic portion of the non-ionic or anionic surfactant is compatible with the antimicrobial constituent and the surfactant forms oil in water microemulsion. Surfactants with HLB values within the range of 9 to 40 are used. Preferably, non-ionic or anionic surfactants with HLB values more than 13 are used.<br>
In accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention, the HLB value of the surfactant is between 16 and 40.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the antimicrobial constituent, the solvent and the surfactant are processed to form micro-reservoirs which are embedded into the body of the formulation. The antimicrobial lyocell contains<br>
13<br><br>
uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the body of the fibers. The micro-reservoirs are discrete, nano-sized structures without any definite geometrical shape.<br>
Typically, the average mean size of the micro-reservoir is in the range of 5 nm to 2000 nm.<br>
The invention also extends to an antimicrobial lyocell fiber, yarn and fabric manufactured from a formulation in accordance with this invention.<br>
In accordance with this invention there is also provided a process for preparation of an antimicrobial lyocell formulation meant for manufacture of lyocell products comprising the following steps :<br>
•	admixing a water-insoluble antimicrobial constituent with a non¬aqueous solvent followed by heating the resulting mixture to obtain a liquid non-aqueous phase;<br>
•	dissolving and stirring a surfactant, optionally with a co-surfactant, in water to obtain an aqueous phase;<br>
•	heating the aqueous-phase;<br>
•	mixing the aqueous phase with the non-aqueous phase in the liquid state to form a admixture and homogenizing to obtain a micro-emulsion;<br>
•	mixing together cellulosic pulp and N-METHYL-MORPHOLINE-N-OXIDE (NNMO) solution to form a slurry;<br>
14<br><br>
•	dispersing the micro-emulsion in the slurry to obtain a preform mass wherein the antimicrobial constituent is embedded in evenly dispersed micro-reservoirs;<br>
•	vaccumising the preform mass to remove water under 7 to 10 mm of Hg and temperature of over 90°C to obtain the formulation.<br>
Before arriving at the optimum concentration of the surfactant to be used, cloud point of the aqueous phase is determined. Furthermore, alkalinity of the aqueous phase matches with that of the viscous polymer dope thereby avoiding any drastic change in the alkalinity during the emulsification and homogenization step. Typically, the melted non-aqueous phase containing antimicrobial constituent in a non-aqueous solvent along with aqueous phase containing surfactants is emulsified using high speed mixers, such as Ultraturrex or a mechanical emulsifier; a colloid mill; a high pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic emulsifier to form a microemulsion. The micro-emulsion may contain further additional antimicrobial constituents, if desired.<br>
It is important that the non-aqueous phase is maintained in liquid state throughout the mixing process. The aqueous phase therefore is typically heated upto a particular temperature to ensure that the temperature of the resulting emulsion is above the melting point of the non-aqueous solvent. If this does not happen, the resulting emulsion will break down.<br>
The active ingredients are released from the micro-reservoir into the lyocell matrix. The structure of micro-reservoir, lyocell and surrounding conditions determine the release rate of the antimicrobial constituent. The molecules of the volatile   antimicrobial   constituents   migrate   from   micro-reservoirs   to   the<br>
15<br><br>
surrounding primarily by diffusion. The antimicrobial constituent is released from the matrix in a controlled release manner.<br>
Conventional method for manufacture of lyocell involves following major steps :<br>
Step 1. Creating a solvent solution from wood pulp<br>
The wood pulp is obtained from a variety of sources, such as wood chips or even large rolls of paper that have been finely shredded, is the basic starting material for manufacture of lyocell fibers. In case of manufacture of lyocell no further chemical treatment of the wood pulp is needed thereby making the process environment friendly.<br>
The wood pulp solution is produced in a straight solvation process by dissolving wood pulp at high temperatures and pressure in a recyclable non-toxic organic solvent solution of amine oxide, particularly N-methylmorpholine N-oxide,(N-METHYL-MORPHOLINE-N-OXIDE (NNMO)).<br>
Lyocell is manufactured by a "closed loop" spinning process which conserves<br>
energy and water.<br>
Step 2 Spinning lyocell fiber from the solvent solution<br>
Before being formed into fibers, the lyocell polymer dope, is in a thick liquid state. In the spinning process this liquid is forced through a spinneret, which resembles a large shower head.<br>
The clear, viscous resultant solution is filtered and extruded into an aqueous bath of dilute amine oxide, and coagulated into fiber form.<br>
16<br><br>
Step 3. Washing lyocell fiber to remove solvents<br>
The fiber is then washed before it is dried and twisted or spun into yarns, which are woven or knitted into fabrics and garments.<br>
Step 4. Drying fiber and producing yarns<br>
When the filament dries or solidifies, it forms what is called a continuous filament fiber. Many continuous filaments of specific thicknesses collected in a large bundle called a "tow". A tow may contain over a million continuous filaments. The tow bundle is then crimped, is then mechanically cut into staple fibers, usually ranging in length from 1 to 6-1/2 inches, depending how they are to be used.<br>
Strands of continuous filament fibers are then twisted together to form a continuous filament yarn, which is then woven or knit into fabric.<br>
Step 5, Finishing producing lyocell fabric<br>
The fabric is treated with an enzyme that attacks cellulose fibers. Home laundry detergents containing such enzymes are also used for treatment of the fabric for better finishing purposes. This enzyme dissolves the split-end hairs from the fiber surface. The fiber is then washed and agitated again. The resulting fabric is similar in texture and drape to sueded silk or sueded rayon found in fashion apparel. Fabrics processed this way can usually be machine washed and line dried successfully.<br>
Alternatively, the filaments so obtained further blended using standard equipment. The blended fibers are laid in to a web using standard equipment followed by Consolidation of the web to obtain Non-woven Lyocell Fabric.<br>

The lyocell product made from the formulation in accordance with this invention contains uniformly dispersed micro-reservoirs throughout the mass which is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The antimicrobial constituent enriched lyocell fabrics as prepared in the above examples can be tested for antimicrobial activity by various test procedures which include antimicrobial assays used to determine or confirm the effectiveness of treatments applied to medical devices, medical and commercial textiles, and other products. Test methods for measuring the antimicrobial activity include ASTM, AATCC, and other modified methods. Testing includes antibacterial and antifungal activity, with both qualitative and quantitative assays available.<br>
AATCC 100   is a qualitative test for antibacterial activity.<br>
Test lyocell fiber/fabric specimens are placed into contact with a nutrient agar which has been streaked with a microbe such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli bacterial culture. Samples are inoculated with Staphylococcus and evaluated for percent reduction of the bacteria over selected contact periods of 1 - 24 hours. Turnaround Time is usually 5 days. The specimens are then incubated at a temperature 37 °C for a period of time of 24 hours. After the 24 hour incubation period, the samples are visually checked for the growth of bacteria.<br>
The AATCC 147, Part III protocol provides a qualitative test for antifungal activity. Lyocell fiber/ fabric specimens are subjected to the growth of a common fungus, Aspergillus niger, on Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Prewet specimens are<br>
18<br><br>
inoculated and incubated at 28 C for seven days. Specimens are then assessea ror growth of the fungus.<br>
ASTM E2180-01 test method is used for testing inhibitory mold activity of the lyocell product (fiber /fabric) prepared in accordance with this invention.<br>
The antimicrobial lyocell fibers contain the entrapped antimicrobial constituent in releasable form. Microscopic examination of the micro-reservoirs in the lyocell fibers is shown in Fig 2.<br>
The resultant lyocell fabric containing antimicrobial constituent are tested. Linear Density (Denier) of the lyocell Fibers is determined by using standard ASTM Test Method (D 1577). The denier of the standard lyocell fiber (lyocell fiber without any antimicrobial constituents) and anti-microbial enriched lyocell fiber remains the same. Thus addition of antimicrobial constituents does not change the linear density of the lyocell fibers.<br>
Tensile strength and Young's modulus of lyocell fiber sample is tested on an Instron tensile testing machine as per the ASTM CI557-03 procedure at ambient temperature.<br>
Visual appearance of the antimicrobial enriched fiber is evaluated by methods as prescribed in AATCC 124. As far as parameters like % Loss in Dry Tenacity and % loss in dry elongation are concerned, these remain the same in the antimicrobial enriched lyocell fiber and the standard fiber. Incorporation of antimicrobial constituent in accordance with this invention does not affect the visual appearance of the fiber.<br>
19<br><br>
Feel of the fiber: The antimicrobial enriched lyocell fiber as prepared in accordance with this invention offers the same feel effect as is observed in case of plain lyocell fiber without any antimicrobial constituent (Also referred as standard).<br>
Another important concern in textile industry is dye-ability of the fabric, which is tested by comparing the dyeability of the antimicrobial constituent enriched fabric and the standard lyocell fabric. Dyeability of the antimicrobial enriched lyocell fibers as prepared in accordance with this invention remains the same as that of the standard lyocell fiber.<br>

•	dissolving and stirring a surfactant, optionally with a co-surfactant, in water to obtain an aqueous phase;<br>
•	heating the aqueous-phase;<br>
•	mixing the aqueous phase with the non-aqueous phase in the liquid state to form a admixture and homogenizing to obtain a micro-emulsion;<br>
35<br><br>
•	mixing together cellulosic pulp and N-METHYL-MORPHOLINE-N-OXIDE (NNMO) solution to form a slurry;<br>
•	dispersing the micro-emulsion in the slurry to obtain a preform mass wherein the antimicrobial constituent is embedded in evenly dispersed micro-reservoirs;<br>
•	vaccumising the preform mass to remove water under 7 to 10 mm of Hg and temperature of over 90 C to obtain the formulation.<br>
