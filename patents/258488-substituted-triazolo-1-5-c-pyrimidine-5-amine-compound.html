FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to 7-[2-[4-(6-fluoro -3-methyl -1p2-benzisoxazol-5-yl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-2-(1-propynyl)-7H-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-[1,2,4]-triazolo[1t5" c]pyrimidin-5-amine, an adenosine A2a receptor antagonist, the use of said compound in the treatment of central nervous system disorders including movement disorders, e.g., Parkinson's Disease, Extra-Pyramidal Syndrome, restless legs syndrome, essential tremor and Huntington's Disease; attention disorders, e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cognitive impairment and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; and to other central nervous system diseases such as depression, stroke and psychoses. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compound.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Adenosine is known to be an endogenous modulator of numerous physiological functions. At the cardiovascular system level, adenosine is a strong vasodilator and a cardiac depressor. In the central nervous system, adenosine induces sedative, anxiolytic and antiepileptic effects. In the respiratory system, adenosine induces bronchoconstriction. In the renal system, it exerts a biphasic action, inducing vasoconstriction at low concentrations and vasodilation at high doses. Adenosine acts as a lipolysis inhibitor on fat cells and as an antiaggregant on platelets.<br>
Adenosine action is mediated by the interaction with different membrane specific receptors which belong to the family of receptors coupled with G proteins. Biochemical and pharmacological studies, together with advances in molecular biology, have allowed the identification of at least four subtypes of adenosine receptors: Ai, A2a, A2b and A3. A1 and A3 receptors inhibit, while A2a and A2b<br><br>
receptors stimulate the activity of the enzyme adenylate cyclase, Analogs of adenosine able to interact as antagonists with the Ai, A2a, A2b and A3 receptors have also been identified.<br>
Selective antagonists for the A2a receptor are of pharmacological interest because of their reduced probability of potentiating side effects. In the central nervous system, A2a antagonists can have antidepressant properties and stimulate cognitive functions. Moreover, data has shown that A2a receptors are present in high density in the basal ganglia, known to be important in the control of movement. Hence, A2a antagonists can improve motor impairment due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, senile dementia as in Alzheimer's disease, and psychoses.<br>
Adenosine A2a receptor antagonists have been disclosed as being useful in the treatment or prevention of Extra Pyramidal Syndrome (EPS), dystonia, restless legs syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) in WO 05/044245, and have been disclosed as being useful in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in WO 02/055083.<br>
EPS is a collective term for a series of adverse neurological reactions associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs. There are six different categories of EPS-related neurological syndromes of which four, dystonia, akathisia, pseudoparkinsonism (parkinsonian syndrome), and tardive dyskinesia, are particularly prevalent in patients taking antipsychotic medication. Dystonia is a painful spasm of the muscle groups of, in particular, the neck, jaw, back, pharynx, and larynx. It is most common in young males being treated with antipsychotic drugs, but can also be associated with the use of cocaine, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and carbamazepine. Pseudoparkinsonism manifests itself as akinesia (rigidity, stiffness and slow voluntary motion, stooped, shuffling walk) and tremor and these symptoms develop within weeks or months after initiation of therapy. Akathisia manifests itself as strong, subjective inner feelings of distress or discomfort characterized by motor restlessness. Often mistaken for agitation or anxiety, this common syndrome is frequently under-diagnosed and is the least responsive to treatment. Tardive dyskinesia is a late-appearing syndrome associated with chronic use of neuroleptic drugs. It occurs more frequently in older<br><br>
patients and is characterized by stereotypical, repetitive, involuntary, quick choreiform movements of the face, eyelids, mouth, tongue, extremities and trunk.<br>
EPS is more prevalent with the use of typical antipsychotic agents but has also been reported with the use of atypical agents. Typical antipsychotics include loxapine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine and thiothixene. Atypical antipsychotics include clozapine, olanzapine, loxapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, risperidone and aripiprazole.<br>
Akathisia is also a characteristic of RLS and PLMS, as well as PLMD (periodic leg (or limb) movement disorder). RLS is a common disorder that causes patients to have an irresistible and unpleasant desire to move their legs; it usually manifests during periods of inactivity and/or at night, and can disturb sleep. Patients who do not have the typical RLS symptoms, but who do exhibit periodic leg movements that adversely impact sleep, are diagnosed with PLMS. Treatments for RLS and PLMS have included levodopa/carbidopa, levodopa/benserazide, dopamine agonists such as pramipexole and ropinerole, benzodiazepines, opioids, anticonvulsants and Iron (ferrous sulfate), RLS and PLMS have been extensively described in the literature, for example by Saletu et al, Neuropsychobioloav. 41. 4 (2000), p. 190-9.<br>
Some xanthine-related compounds have been found to be Ai receptor selective antagonists, and xanthine and non-xanthine compounds have been found to have high A2a affinity with varying degrees of A2&amp; vs. Ai selectivity. Triazolo-pyrimidine adenosine A2a receptor antagonists have been disclosed previously, for example in WO 95/01356; US 5,565,460; WO 97/05138; WO 98/52568, US 6,630,475, US 6,653,315, US 6,897,217 and PCT/US05/013454, filed April 19, 2005.<br>
This invention is a selection invention over US 6,897,217.<br><br><br>
Another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention is a method of treating central nervous system disorders including movement disorders, e.g., Parkinson's Disease, Extra-Pyramidal Syndrome, restless legs syndrome, essential tremor, Huntington's Disease, dystonia, periodic limb movement in sleep; attention disorders, e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cognitive impairment and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; and to other central nervous system diseases such as depression, stroke and psychoses, comprising administering the compound of formula I to a mammal in need of such treatment.<br>
In particular, the invention is drawn to the method of treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor or Huntington's Disease comprising administering the compound of formula I to a mammal In need of such treatment.<br>
Still another aspect of the invention is a method of treating Parkinson's disease with a combination of the compound of formula I and one or more agents useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, for example dopamine; L-DOPA; a dopaminergic agonist; an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, type B (MAO-B); a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI); or a catechoI-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Also claimed is a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of formula I and one or more agents known to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention also relates to the treatment or prevention of EPS (e.g., dystonia, akathisia, pseudoparkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia) comprising administering the compound of formula I to a mammal in need of such treatment. In particular, this method is for the treatment or prevention of EPS in patients treated with an antipsychotic agent that has the side effect of inducing EPS. The compound of formula I can be administered after the symptoms of EPS have manifested, or the compound of formula I can be administered at the onset of administering an antipsychotic agent in order to prevent EPS from occurring. Thus, the invention also includes a method of treating or preventing EPS induced by an antipsychotic agent<br><br>
comprising administering a combination of an antipsychotic agent and the compound of formula I to a patient in need thereof.<br>
The invention also relates to the treatment of primary (idiopathic) dystonia, and to the treatment or prevention of dystonia in patients who exhibit dystonia as a result of treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium or an anticonvulsant, or who have used cocaine, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I to a patient in need thereof. When dystonia is caused by treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium or an anticonvulsant, the compound of formula I can be administered after the symptoms of dystonia have manifested, or the compound of formula I can be administered at the onset of administering a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium or an anticonvulsant in order to prevent dystonia from occurring. The invention, therefore, also includes a method of treating or preventing dystonia induced by a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium or an anticonvulsant comprising administering a combination of the compound of formula I and a tricyclic antidepressant, lithium or an anticonvulsant to a patient in need thereof.<br>
The invention further relates to treatment of abnormal movement disorders such as RLS or PLMS, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I. The invention also comprises a method of treating RLS or PLMS comprising administering a combination of the compound of formula I with another agent useful in treating RLS or PLMS, such as levodopa/carbidopa, Ievodopa/benserazide, a dopamine agonist, a benzodiazepine, an opioid, an anticonvulsant or iron, to a patient in need thereof.<br>
The invention also relates to the treatment of attention related disorders such as attention deficit disorder (ADD) and ADHD, as well as cognitive impairment and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula I.<br>

Abbreviations used in the specification are as follows: Ac (acetyl); Me (methyl); Et (ethyl); Ph (phenyl); DMF (dimethylformamide); DIPEA (diisopropylethylamine); RT (room temperature).<br>
Example 1<br><br><br>
Step 1: A mixture of 4-fluoro-2-hydroxyacetophenone 1 (50 g, 324 mmol), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (45 g, 648 mmol), and sodium acetate (40 g, 488 mmol) in anhydrous MeOH (1 L) was refluxed for 2 h. After cooling to RT, the reaction mixture was slowly poured onto ice and stirred for 30 rnin. The white precipitate thus obtained was filtered through suction and then dissolved in CH2Cl2, dried (MgS04), filtered, and concentrated to give 2 as a white solid (50 g, 91% yield) which was used without further purification for the next step.<br>
Step 2; To a solution of the oxime 2 (50 g, 296 mmol) in DMF (800 ml) was added sodium acetate (55 g, 670 mmol) followed by acetic anhydride (65 ml, 689 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 3-4 h, at which stage all the starting material was consumed as indicated by TLC (10% EtOAc in hexanes). After cooling to RT, the reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted several times with ether. The combined organic fractions were washed with brine, dried (Na2S04), filtered and concentrated to give 3 as a brownish solid (42 g.; 94% yield). Step 3: To an ice-cold solution of 3 (42 g, 278 mmol) in cone. H2SO4 (300 ml) was added dropwise cone. HN03 (70 ml) through an addition funnel. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was warmed to RT and stirred for 2-3 h. After the<br><br>
starting material was consumed as indicated by TLC (10% EtOAc in hexanes), the reaction mixture was poured slowly on ice with constant shaking. The resulting solid was filtered, dissolved in CH2CI2 and washed with saturated aq. NaHC03 solLition and brine. The combined organic fractions were dried over MgS04, filtered, and concentrated to give 47 g (86% yield) of 4 as a yellow solid.<br>
Step 4: A solution of 4 (47 g, 240 mmol) in AcOH (800 ml) was warmed to 40 °C and to this warm solution was added a solution of SnCl2»H20 (150 g, 665 mmol) in cone, HCI (400 ml). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h and then cooled to RT The pH was carefully adjusted to 5-6 with aqueous NaOH to precipitate most of the tin salts and then ether was added to the mixture with constant stirring. After decanting the liquid, the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was back extracted several times with ether. The combined organic fractions were washed with brine, dried (Na2S04), filtered and concentrated to give a brown oil. Purification by column chromatography (10-20% EtOAc in hexanes) gave 22 g (55% yield) of 5 as a yellow solid.<br>
Step 5: A solution of 5 (3.2 g, 19 mmol) in CH2CI2 (100 ml) was treated with 2M HCI/ether (9.6 ml, 19 mmol) and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The white solid was taken in chlorobenzene (80 ml) and treated with bis(chioroethyl)-amine (3.8 g, 21 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 48 h, at which stage most of the starting material was consumed. Most of the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was taken up in hot MeOH (200 ml). The black insoluble residue was filtered off and the filtrate was purified by column chromatography (2-5% 7N NH3-MeOH in CH2CI2) to give 2.6 g (57% yield) of 6. Step 6: A mixture of 6(2.6 g, 11 mmol), 7 (3.2 g, 12 mmol), Kl (2.0 g, 12 mmol), and DIPEA (2.3 ml, 13.3 mmol) in DMF (30 ml) was heated at 110 °C for 48 h. After cooling to RT, water was added and the resulting solid was filtered. The solid residue was dissolved in 10% MeOH-CH2Cl2, dry loaded on a silica gel column, and purified (2% MeOH in CH2CI2) giving 2.7 g (52% yield) of the title compound. LCMS: 475 (M+H), purity = 100%.<br>

HaloperidoHnduced catalepsy in the rat<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Calco, Italy) weighing 175-200 g are used. The cataleptic state is induced by the subcutaneous administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol (1 mg/kg, sc), 90 min before testing the animals on the vertical grid test. For this test, the rats are placed on the wire mesh cover of a 25x43 plexiglass cage placed at an angle of about 70 degrees with the bench table. The rat is placed on the grid with all four legs abducted and extended ("frog posture"). The use of such an unnatural posture is essential for the specificity of this test for catalepsy. The time span from placement of the paws until the first complete removal of one paw {descent latency is measured maximally for 120 sec.<br>
The selective A?A adenosine antagonists under evaluation are administered orally at doses ranging between 0.03 and 3 mg/kg, 1 and 4 h before scoring the animals.<br>
In separate experiments, the anticataleptic effects of the reference compound, L-DOPA (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, ip), were determined. 6-OHDA Lesion of the Middle Forebrain Bundle in Rats<br>
Adult male Sprague-Dowley rats (Charles River, Calco, Como, Italy), weighing 275-300 g, are used in all experiments. The rats are housed in groups of 4 per cage, with free access to food and water, under controlled temperature and 12 hour light/ dark cycle. The day before the surgery the rats are fasted over night with water ad libitum.<br><br><br><br>
conjunction with haloperidol The studies are conducted using a within-subjects design such that each monkey receives all treatments (vehicle and doses of test compound) in a crossover, balanced design. The reduction in the maximum EPS score, as well as the dose-dependent delay in the onset of EPS are determined.<br>
Clinical guidelines for the treatment of RLS and PLMS have been established: see A. L. Chesson et al, Sleep, 22, 7 (1999), p. 961-8. Efficacy of adenosine A2a antagonists in treating RLS and PLMS can be determined by a method analogous to the clinical method described in the literature for pramipexole and ropinerole by Weimerskirch et al, Annals of Pharmacotherapy. 35. 5 (2001), p. 627-30.<br>
Using the above test procedures, the following results were obtained for the compound of the invention.<br>
Results of the binding assay on the compound of the Invention showed an A2a Kj value of 0.43 nM.<br>
Selectivity is determined by dividing K\ for Ai receptor by Ki for A^ receptor. The compound of the invention has a selectivity greater than 2500 fold.<br>
In the 6-OHDA lesion test, test animals administered a combination of a compound of formula I and a sub-threshold amount of L-DOPA demonstrated significantly higher contralateral turning:<br>
L-DOPA:  171 ±47 rotations<br>
0.1 mpk; 218 ±142 rotations<br>
0,3 mpk: 406 ±167 rotations<br>
1 mpk: 360 ± 178 rotations<br>
3 mpk: 403 ±125 rotations<br>
In the haloperidol-induced catalepsy assay in rats @ 4 h, the % inhibition was<br>
as follows:<br>
0.3 mpk: 28% inhibition of catalepsy<br>
1 mpk: 47% inhibition of catalepsy 3 mpk; 53% inhibition of catalepsy In the EPS assay, four haloperidol-sensitized monkeys were co-administered the compound of formula I (30 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg) in a banana. A scoring system to rate the severity of each symptom was employed over a 6 hour observation period. The compound of formula I completely blocked haloperidol-induced EPS in three subjects during the 6 hr observation period and in the fourth<br><br>
subject, delayed onset and reduced severity of EPS compared to that observed in monkeys dosed with haloperidol alone.<br>
Ex vivo binding study to show duration of receptor occupancy:<br>
Rats were dosed with 1 mg/kg of the compound of formula I and the compound of formula II (generically disclosed in US 6,897,217)<br><br>
for 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours prior to sacrifice and removal of brains. The A2a receptor-rich striatal nucleus was dissected and homogenized in buffer solution. Striatal homogenate was incubated with the Aaa antagonist radioligand 3H-SCH 58261 (see WO 96/38728) prior to separation of bound and free radioactivity by filtration. Bound radioligand on filters was dried, soaked with scintillation fluid, and counted. Homogenates from striata of vehicle-treated rats treated with the same experimental conditions defined the quantity of bound radioligand in the absence of test compound.<br>
For both compounds, receptors are occupied by test compounds at 4 hours, demonstrated by the decrease (42 and 47%) in 3H-SCH 58261 binding. However, in striatal homogenates from rats dosed with formula II, radioligand binding is restored to near vehicle-treated levels at 8 hours, indicating that test compound is no longer competing for A2a receptors at that time. The compound of formula I exhibits sustained displacement of radioligand through 12 hours (40% displacement of radiolabel).<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compound of this invention, inert, pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 70 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br><br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection.<br>
Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.<br>
Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.   •<br>
The compound of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.<br>
Preferably the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>
The quantity of active compound of formula I in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to 300 mg, according to the particular application.<br>
The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.  For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.<br><br>
The amount and frequency of administration of the compound of the invention and the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen for the compound of formula I is oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses to provide relief from central neiA/ous system diseases such as Parkinson's disease or the other disease or conditions listed above.<br>
The doses and dosage regimen of the other agents used in combination with the compound of formula I, i.e., the Parkinson's Disease agents, the antipsychotics, tricycicic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, dopamine agonists, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium or iron, will be determined by the attending clinician in view of the approved doses and dosage regimen in the package insert, taking into consideration the age, sex and condition of the patient and the severity of the disease. When administered in combination, the compound of formula I and the other agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. This is particularly useful when the components of the combination are preferably given on different dosing schedules, e.g., one component is administered daily and the other every six hours, or when the preferred pharmaceutical compositions are different, e.g. one is preferably a tablet and one is a capsule. It is therefore advantageous to provide the compound of formula I and the other agent in a kit comprising, in separate containers in a single package, pharmaceutical compositions for use in combination to treat or prevent Parkinson's disease, EPS, dystonia, RLS or PLMS, wherein one container comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I in a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, and wherein a separate container comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of another agent appropriate to treat the indicated condition.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that a dosage form for one of the components of the combination can be modified to contain both the compound of formula I and another agent, e.g., the compound of formula I and an antipsychotic or the compound of formula I and a dopamine agonist.<br>
While the present invention has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and variations thereof<br><br>
will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such alternatives, modifications and variations are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
