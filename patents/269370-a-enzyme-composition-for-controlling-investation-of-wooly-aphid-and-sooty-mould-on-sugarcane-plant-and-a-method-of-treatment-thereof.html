				<td>Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an enzyme composition useful for control of<br>
infestation of woolly aphid and sooty mould on sugarcane plants.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to an enzyme composition useful for<br>
control of woolly aphid, Ceretovacuna lanigera, on sugarcane, or woolly apple<br>
aphid and mealy bug of grapes using enzyme mixture of Myrothecium verrucaria.<br>
The enzyme composition comprises mainly chitinases, lipases, proteases and (3-1,3<br>
- glucanases.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of preparation of the said enzyme<br>
composition useful for control of infestation of woolly aphid and sooty mould on<br>
sugarcane plants.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for controlling infestation of woody<br>
aphid and sooty mould on sugarcane plants.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention;<br>
Sugarcane is a major industrial crop in India. The area under sugarcane in India and Maharashtra was about 42.97 and 5.95 lakh hectare respectively, during 2000 -2001 with average productivity of 69.6 and 84.4 tones per hectare and producing sugar 185.11 and 67.05 lakh tones, respectively (Vijay Kumar Sugar statistics Cooperative Sugar 2002, 34 (1), 57- 95). Maharashtra state alone contributes 35 % of total sugar production in India. The average production of sugarcane in Maharashtra has been declined drastically during last three years (Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, 2002). Now a day, sugarcane woolly aphid (Ceretovacuna lanigera) has become a serious pest in the state. The woolly aphid adults produce nymphs without mating (parthenogenesis). The woolly aphid multiplies profusely and desaps the foliage heavily and excretes honey dew like substances on the leaves which favors the multiplication of black sooty mould (Capnodium sp.), resulting in drying of leaves and ultimately decrease in yield and sugar recovery. These sugarcane leaves when used as a fodder for cattle resulted in cattle death due to the toxins produced by the sooty mould (Gupta and Goswamai Incidence of sugarcane woolly aphid and its effect on yield attributes and juice quality. Indian sugar, 1995,<br>
44 (12), 883-885). The loss due to heavy incidence of woolly aphid was reported to be 26 % in sugarcane yield and 24 % in sugar content in Indonesia. (Farina, S. R. "Problems on WSCA and strategies for its control at Takakar sp."- Report to the manager of Takakar sp. 1994, Takakar sugar plantation, unpublished report, 9). Various commercial preparations have been used for the control of woolly aphid infestation on sugarcane such as Conobathra aphidivora Meyr. (Pyralidae:Lepidoptera), a potent predator that feeds on nymphs and adults of woolly aphid. However the multiplication rate of the predator is very low as compared to the woolly aphid infestation rate. Chemical control includes malathion and dimethoate sprays. These chemicals though effective in the control, woolly aphid reappear after 10-15 days and again multiply profusely on sugarcane leaves. The 0.1 % soap powder has also been tried to control woolly aphid, but it has scorching effect on sugarcane leaves. In case of biological control Verticillium lecanii was reported to control woolly aphid under field (personal communication). It controls 50% of woolly aphid in 15 days time.<br>
Till date, there was no report for use of enzyme mixture against woolly aphid on sugarcane. Myrothecium verrucaria, a deuteromycetes fungus produces extracellularly enzyme mixture, which degrades insect cuticle, when grown in a medium containing chitin as a sole carbon source within 7 days at 28° C under shaking condition. The enzyme mixture constitutes chitinase, lipase, protease and P-1, 3-glucanase Previously, this enzyme preparation was used to control a fungal plant pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii, a root infecting plant pathogenic fungus (Patil RS, Deshpande AM, Natu AA, Nahar P, Chitnis M, Ghormade V, Laxman R.S, Rokade S, Deshpande MV. Biocontrol of root infecting plant pathogenic fungus, Sclerotium rolfsii using mycolytic enzymes and chitin metabolism inhibitors singly and in combination. J. Bio. Control. 2001, 15, 157-164), and also reported for the control of mosquito larvae (Mendosa ES, Vartak PH, Rao JU, Deshpande MV. An enzyme from Myrothecium verrucaria that degrades insect cuticle for biocontrol of Aedes aegypti mosquito. Biotechnol Lett. 1996, 18, 373-376).<br>
The inventors of the present invention have highlighted the importance of application of enzyme mixture from M. verrucaria for the control of Helicoverpa<br>
armigera and Spodoptera litura, the lepidopteran polyphagous pests of pulses, cotton, vegetable crops, sugar beet etc. The enzyme complex plays an important role in the insect death due to the hydrolysis of insect cuticular chitin with the help of enzymes such as chitinase (S. Chavan, M. Kulye, M.Kulkarni and M.V. Deshpande. Myrothecium verrucaria: A potential biocontrol agent for the control of insect pest. Proceedings of National Symposium on Biomanagement of Insect Pests 2003, Annamalai nagar, India).<br>
