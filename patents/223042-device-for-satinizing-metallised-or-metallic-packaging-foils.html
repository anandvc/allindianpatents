				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>DEVICE FOR SATINIZING METALLISED OR METALLIC PACKAGING FOILS<br>
The present invention refers to a device for satinizing metallised or metallic packaging foils,<br>
more particularly for embossing and / or satinizing foils, the device comprising at least three<br>
embossing rolls.<br>
A device of this kind is e.g. known from WO-A-00/69622, this reference being exclusively<br>
referring to rolls having each the same structure, more particularly truncated pyramidal teeth where<br>
each tooth of a roll engages between four teeth of another roll while the additional roll has the<br>
function of providing an increased embossing quality and a reduced wear of the rolls especially in the<br>
case of flat materials having a large paper and small metallized proportion.<br>
The embossing station for embossing fiber webs as for handkerchiefs or toilet paper<br>
according to EP-A-1 074 381 comprises a smooth mating roll and two embossing rolls disposed<br>
above the latter in a V-shaped arrangement. However, such an arrangement is unsuitable for<br>
satinizing or for embossing special signs on materials such as cigarette paper as the embossing rolls,<br>
which are not described in detail and are illustrated with a relatively coarse profile, are not intended<br>
for this purpose.<br>
EP-A-498 623 discloses the application of pairs of steel and rubber rolls with knobs on the<br>
steel rolls that fit into corresponding recesses in the rubber roll. The application of two pairs of<br>
identical or similar rolls is also disclosed. Such pairs of rolls with recesses in a rubber roll are<br>
unsuitable for a precise fine embossing and satinizing as it is required e.g. for the treatment of<br>
packaging foils where the flat material is a fibrous material such as paper which is bulked after the<br>
treatment.<br><br>
US-A-4 280 978 discloses an embossing and perforating device<br>
including an embossing and two mating rolls, the mating<br>
rolls comprising recesses that are adapted to the spikes of<br>
the embossing rolls. This device is also unsuitable for a<br>
precise fine embossing and satinizing.<br>
US-A-2 290 608 discloses a method and device for wrinkling a<br>
metal foil, thereby producing irregular patterns that are<br>
suitable for reflectors. The metal foil passes between two<br>
rolls provided with pegs, longitudinal grooves, wave-shaped<br>
grooves, or honeycomb structures and is rotated by 90° or<br>
45° after each pass. A device of this kind is neither<br>
appropriate for embossing nor for satinizing, and it is also<br>
inappropriate for embossing security features on suitable<br>
materials.<br>
Further known are US-A-5 007 271 or US-A-5 598 774 to the<br>
applicant of the present invention, which disclose embossing<br>
devices with two embossing rolls for flat materials. In<br>
particular, the flat materials in question are bands or<br>
strips one face of which is coated with metal, generally<br>
with aluminum, and whose support consists of paper or<br>
another fibrous material, or foils, e.g. of synthetic<br>
materials, of metal, or of compound materials.<br>
Inter alia, the latter embossing devices are used in the<br>
packaging industry for the purpose of satinizing packaging<br>
materials while seals, emblems and the like may be stamped<br>
at the same time. In this context, satinizing means<br>
providing the surface with a fine pattern in the millimeter<br>
and submillimeter range. Strip or sheet packaging materials<br>
of this kind, also called innerliners, are e.g. used for<br>
packaging tobacco products, cigarettes, foods, chocolates,<br>
chewing gums and the like.<br><br>
According to the cited reference US-A-5 598 774, the driven<br>
roll is supported stationarily while at least one of the two<br>
mating rolls is free-wheeling and journalled such that the<br>
axes of the embossing rolls are capable of an excursion both<br>
in the longitudinal and/or in the contact pressure direction<br>
and/or in the travelling direction of the material. This<br>
allows an adjustment of the rolls that provides a precise<br>
mutual engagement of the teeth and thus a perfect processing<br>
of the material without the risk of wrinkling it.<br>
The last mentioned devices have been successful and still<br>
are as long as the satin-finished foils, more particularly<br>
packaging foils, are mainly composed of aluminum or mainly<br>
of easily foldable paper. In the manufacture of cigarette<br>
packages, for example, these packaging materials serve the<br>
purpose of wrapping up a counted number of cigarettes in the<br>
production process in order to be subsequently inserted in a<br>
box.<br>
Whereas the first mentioned device according to WO-A-<br>
00/69622 provided the expected advantages in the embossing<br>
of flat materials that are difficult to emboss otherwise, it<br>
has appeared that the rolls do not have suitable surface<br>
structures for embossing certain special signs on the flat<br>
material that produce optical effects depending on the<br>
viewing position and/or the light source.<br>
On the background of this prior art, a first object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a device for producing<br>
embossed patterns that allows signs with optical effects<br>
that depend on the viewing position and/or the light source<br>
to be embossed on flat materials with higher precision and<br>
in a wider variety in order to produce security features<br><br>
that are difficult to copy. This object is attained by the device of the instant invention. Accordingly,<br>
the present invention provides a device for satinizing metallised or metallic packaging foils,<br>
comprising at least a first and a second embossing roll between which the packaging foil is capable<br>
of being passed under pressure in order to produce a pattern, the second embossing roll being<br>
followed by at least another embossing roll which cooperates with the first or second embossing roll<br>
and between which the patterned packaging foil is capable of being passed, characterized in that the<br>
first, driven embossing roll comprises a toothing composed of individual teeth forming a<br>
homogenous grid and at least one other embossing roll comprises a surface structure without<br>
individual teeth, at least one of the additional embossing rolls having rings or longitudinal ribs, the<br>
cross-section of the rings or longitudinal ribs being outwardly tapered, and the rings or longitudinal<br>
ribs being flattened, and the dimensions of the rings or longitudinal ribs and of the grooves<br>
therebetween corresponding to the dimensions of the teeth of the first, driven embossing roll, and all<br>
teeth engaging in the grooves between the rings or the longitudinal ribs.<br>
Another object of the invention is a simplification of the device such that a large range of flat<br>
materials can still be embossed with signs providing optical effects that depend on the viewing<br>
position and / or the light source with higher precision and in a wider variety in order to produce<br>
security features that are difficult to copy.<br>
The invention further provides a device for satinizing metallised or metallic packaging foils,<br>
comprising at least a first and a second embossing roll between which the packaging foil is capable<br>
of being passed under pressure in order to produce a pattern, characterized in that the first, driven<br>
embossing roll comprises a toothing composed of individual teeth forming a homogenous grid and<br>
the second embossing roll comprises a surface structure without individual teeth, the second<br><br>
embossing roll having rings or longitudinal ribs, the cross-section of the rings or longitudinal ribs<br>
being outwardly tapered, and the rings or longitudinal ribs being flattened, and the dimensions of the<br>
rings or longitudinal ribs and of the grooves therebetween corresponding to the dimensions of the<br>
teeth of the first, driven embossing roll, and all teeth engaging in the grooves between the rings or the<br>
longitudinal ribs.<br>
Further advanatages and characteristic features are disclosed in the descriptive part of the<br>
specification.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings of exemplary embodiments.<br>

Fig. 10 shows another exemplifying embodiment including<br>
two embossing rolls; and<br>
Fig. 11 shows a variant of the embodiment of Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a first exemplifying embodiment of a device 1<br>
including three embossing rolls where a first embossing roll<br>
2 cooperates with a second embossing roll 3 and a following<br>
embossing roll 4, the first roll 2 being driven by a driving<br>
system 5 whereas the two other rolls 3 and 4, i.e. the<br>
mating rolls, are neither driven nor synchronized with the<br>
driven roll by synchronizing elements such as e.g.<br>
gearwheels, but driven by the medium 6, see Fig. 1A.<br>
As symbolically indicated in Fig. 1A, the embossed medium 6,<br>
e.g. paper metallized with a thin layer of 0.006 mm, runs in<br>
the vertical direction, i.e. from the top to the bottom of<br>
the figures.<br><br>
In contrast to the device disclosed in the mentioned<br>
reference WO-A-0 069 622 to the applicant of the present<br>
invention, the three embossing rolls do not have the same<br>
structure. In the exemplifying embodiment of Fig. 1, the<br>
first, driven embossing roll 2 is the same as in the device<br>
of the prior art and comprises a number of teeth 8 designed<br>
in the form of truncated pyramids, the sides of the pyramids<br>
extending in parallel resp. perpendicularly to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the embossing roll, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 1. In the present example, the second embossing roll 3<br>
is provided with grooves 9 extending on the entire<br>
circumference and arranged in parallel to each other such<br>
that the teeth 8 of the driven embossing roll 2 engage in<br>
the grooves. The rings 10 formed between grooves 9 are also<br>
outwardly tapered and flattened such that they penetrate<br>
between the truncated pyramidal teeth 8.<br>
In analogy, the third embossing roll 4 comprises<br>
longitudinal grooves 11 forming longitudinal ribs 12 between<br>
them, the latter again being outwardly tapered and flattened<br>
like rings 10 in such a manner that longitudinal grooves 11<br>
and the longitudinal ribs cooperate with the teeth 8 of<br>
driven embossing roll 2.<br>
The production of inscriptions, devices, and the like,<br>
hereinafter called patterns, is realized by removing or<br>
shortening teeth on the embossing roll 2 that comprises<br>
teeth 8. The rings resp. longitudinal ribs may influence<br>
the appearance of the embossed patterns produced by means of<br>
the embossing roll provided with the teeth. Through<br>
variations of the teeth 8 or of rings 10 or longitudinal<br>
ribs 12, i.e. by modifications of the height, of the flanks<br>
or the edges of the teeth, the rings, or the longitudinal<br>
ribs, or through patterns provided on the upper surface<br>
thereof, the embossing roll combinations of the invention<br><br>
allow to produce embossed patterns or signs generating a<br>
particular optical effect such that the embossed pattern<br>
changes as it is viewed from different angles and/or under<br>
different lighting conditions or only appears under a<br>
certain angle and/or under certain lighting conditions. To<br>
this effect, the height of the teeth, of the rings or of the<br>
longitudinal ribs may be varied, or the design of individual<br>
teeth, of entire rings or of parts thereof, and of entire<br>
ribs or of parts thereof may differ from that of the<br>
remaining elements.<br>
In Figs. 1 or 2, it is symbolically indicated that the<br>
second and the third embossing roll 3 and 4 are in<br>
engagement with driven embossing roll 2, but this is not<br>
necessarily always the case. It is also conceivable that<br>
the second resp. the third embossing roll is in engagement<br>
or capable of engaging with the first resp. the preceding<br>
embossing roll only. Furthermore, it may be advantageous<br>
for certain applications to provide more than a total of<br>
three embossing rolls having different surface structures.<br>
Also, both the diameter and the length of the individual<br>
rolls may vary. Soft rolls may be used in addition to the<br>
embossing rolls.<br>
In Fig. 2 appears a second device 13 comprising the same<br>
driven roll 2 and the embossing rolls 3 and 4 with rings<br>
resp. longitudinal ribs, the sequence of embossing rolls 3<br>
and 4 being reversed as compared to the sequence according<br>
to Fig. 1, and the embossing roll that comprises the<br>
longitudinal ribs engaging before the embossing roll<br>
comprising the rings when seen in the travelling direction<br>
of the material 6.<br>
In the exemplifying embodiment of Fig. 3, device 14 again<br>
comprises the same driven roll 2, followed as in Fig. 1 by<br><br>
the embossing roll 3 provided with rings 10. The following<br>
embossing roll 15 is either provided with an identical<br>
toothing as embossing roll 2, i.e. with the same teeth 8<br>
whose bases are arranged in parallel and perpendicularly to<br>
the longitudinal axis or, as illustrated, with a toothing 28<br>
that is complementary thereto.<br>
In analogy to the already cited reference WO-A-0 069 622,<br>
for the production of special embossed patterns, it is<br>
advantageous to provide a positive synchronization of<br>
embossing rolls 2 and 15 provided with teeth 8 and recesses<br>
28, respectively, as it is symbolically indicated in Fig. 3A<br>
by the gearwheels 22 and 23, the gearwheels generally<br>
representing synchronizing elements including other<br>
synchronizing means that are known per se, such as<br>
electronic components and the like. Also, a positive<br>
synchronization is particularly recommended if the material<br>
is subject to strong warping in the embossing procedure.<br>
Generally, for the embossing type intended here, pairs of<br>
rolls whose teeth correspond to the so-called pinup-pindown<br>
constellation will be chosen, i.e. where a tooth 8 of one<br>
roll fits into a recess 28 of the other roll, see Fig. 3B.<br>
However, for special situations, it is also conceivable to<br>
choose the so-called pinup-pinup situation where each tooth<br>
of one roll interpenetrates between four respective teeth of<br>
the other roll and all teeth are designed and arranged<br>
alike. In this case, although a positive synchronization of<br>
the two rolls is also advantageous for the suggested special<br>
embossing, an operation where driven roll 2 is journalled<br>
stationarily and the other toothed roll is free-wheeling and<br>
journalled as described in the introduction with regard to<br>
US-A-5 598 774 is possible too. It follows that the axles<br>
of the embossing rolls are capable of an excursion both in<br><br>
the longitudinal direction and/or in the contact pressure<br>
direction and/or in the passing direction of the material,<br>
thereby allowing an adjustment of the rolls that provides a<br>
precise mutual engagement of the teeth and thus a perfect<br>
processing of the material without the risk of wrinkling it.<br>
This is also described in EP-A-0 925 911 to the applicant of<br>
the present invention.<br>
As a variant of Fig. 3, the exemplifying embodiment of Fig.<br>
4 is illustrated where the sequence of rolls 3 and 15 is<br>
reversed. Fig. 5 shows another variant of Figs. 3 and 4,<br>
device 17 in Fig. 5 comprising the same driven roll 2 and<br>
the same embossing roll 15 as in Figs. 3 and 4, as well as<br>
embossing roll 3 with rings 10, whereas the embossing rolls<br>
are not positively synchronized in contrast to Fig. 3.<br>
In Fig. 6, a further exemplifying embodiment is described<br>
where device 18 comprises the two embossing rolls 2 and 15<br>
as well as embossing roll 4 with longitudinal ribs 12.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate another exemplifying embodiment and<br>
a variant thereof, driven roll 2 and embossing roll 15 of<br>
the preceding examples constituting the first and the second<br>
rolls of this device 19, respectively, while the third roll,<br>
in contrast to the preceding examples, is a rubber roll 20<br>
having a comparatively smooth surface. In device 21<br>
according to Fig. 8, the sequence of rolls 15 and 20 is<br>
reversed.<br>
Figs. 9 and 9A illustrate a variant of the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 7 where the two embossing rolls 2 and 15 each comprise<br>
the same toothing 8, i.e. are arranged in a pinup-pinup<br>
configuration, and the two non-driven rolls 15 and 20 are<br>
positively synchronized by a gear comprising gearwheels 25,<br>
26, and 27.<br><br>
Based on these examples, variations are possible: Thus,<br>
rubber roll 20 may be used instead of ring roll 3 or<br>
longitudinally ribbed roll 4.<br>
Furthermore, the bearings, resp. the two yokes 7<br>
accommodating the two bearings, are schematically<br>
illustrated in the figures, thereby also indicating that the<br>
roll axles may be journalled individually, in groups or in<br>
common.<br>
Here also, the embossing rolls need not have equal diameters<br>
and equal lengths, but in contrast to the first example,<br>
unless they are equal, the diameters of the rolls must form<br>
an integral ratio if the synchronization is provided by<br>
gearwheels, whereas their lengths may differ individually.<br>
In EP-A-1 048 369 to the applicant of the present invention,<br>
which is explicitly included herein by reference, an<br>
embossing device is indicated where at least one of the<br>
embossing rolls is contained in an exchangeable unit such<br>
that it is insertable in a predetermined position in a<br>
bearing mount.<br>
In the present device with at least three embossing rolls,<br>
the arrangement of the rolls in exchangeable units,<br>
individually or in groups, is particularly advantageous as<br>
the rationalization effect and the ecological advantages are<br>
particularly important in this case.<br>
The preceding disclosure shows that the device of the<br>
invention offers many advantages:<br>
a) The application of rolls provided with different<br>
structures, of which at least one roll comprises the teeth<br><br>
of the prior art and at least one additional roll comprises<br>
a different structure, e.g. longitudinal ribs or rings, or<br>
is a smooth rubber roll, allows such a fine embossing that<br>
its structures are variable according to the viewing angle<br>
and/or the lighting conditions. This allows to produce<br>
largely forgery-proof security features.<br>
b) Due to the application of more than two rolls, the<br>
paper fibers are broken in the best possible manner and the<br>
memory effect of the paper is largely neutralized. This is<br>
accomplished by a precise positioning of the successive<br>
embossing rolls, in operation, thereby allowing to re-emboss<br>
even very fine existing embossing patterns without optical<br>
deterioration.<br>
c) The improved folding behavior of the wrapping packaging<br>
foils eliminates problems in inserting pre-folded packaging<br>
units into the box.<br>
d) An advantageous construction allows shorter changeovers<br>
between embossing patterns and between embossing rolls and<br>
thus shorter standstill times of the packaging machine.<br>
e) The device allows to design an embossing machine whose<br>
embossing roll construction requires no flexural<br>
compensation of the rolls.<br>
Further tests have shown that most of the above-mentioned<br>
advantages can also be obtained in a device comprising two<br>
embossing rolls according to Figs. 10 or 11.<br>
Thus, the very schematically illustrated device 30 of Fig.<br>
10 comprises the first embossing roll 2 with teeth 8 and a<br>
second embossing roll 3 comprising rings 10 and grooves 9.<br><br>
Furthermore, drive 5 is illustrated, while the yokes are not<br>
shown.<br>
A device 31 comprising the first embossing roll 2 with teeth<br>
8 and the second embossing roll 4 with longitudinal ribs 12<br>
and longitudinal grooves 11 is shown in Fig. 11. The<br>
remaining elements are the same as in the preceding devices.<br>
What has been said of the three-roll system according to<br>
Figs. 1 to 9 correspondingly applies to the two-roll system<br>
of Figs. 10 and 11, however with the advantage of greater<br>
simplicity. If there is a tendency for particularly<br>
difficult materials to roll up after the treatment, a<br>
smoothing device, e.g. comprising smooth rubber rolls, may<br>
be added.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. Device for satinizing metallised or metallic packaging foils, comprising at least a first (2) and<br>
