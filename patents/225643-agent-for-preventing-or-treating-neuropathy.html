The optical isomers can be produced by a method known per se. Concretely, an optically active isomer can be obtained using an optically active synthetic intermediate or by optical resolution of a final racemate by a conventional method.<br>
For optical resolution, a method known per se, such as a fractional recrystallization method, a chiral column method, a diastereomer method, and the like can be used. 1) Fractional Recrystallization Method<br>
The method which comprises allowing a racemate and an optically-active compound (e.g., (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-mandelic acid, (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-tartaric acid, (+)-l-phenethylamine, (-)-l-phenethylamine, cinchonine, (-)-cinchonidine, brucine, etc.) to form a salt, which is then separated through fractional recrystallization method, followed by, when desired, subjecting the salt to a neutralization step to give a free optical isomer. 2) Chiral Column Method<br>
The method of separating by applying a racemate or a salt thereof, to a column for fractionating optical isomers (chiral column) . In the case of, for example, liquid column chromatography, the optical isomers are separated by applying a mixture of optical isomers to a chiral column, such as ENANTIO-OVM (manufactured by Tosoh Corp.), CHIRAL SERIES (manufactured by Daicel Co.), etc., and developing with water, various buffers (e.g., phosphate buffer) and organic solvents (e.g., ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, diethylamine, etc.), singly or as a suitable mixture of them. In the case of, for example, gas chromatography, a chiral column such as CP-Chirasil-DeX CB (manufactured by GL Science Co.), etc. is used for separation. 3) Diastereomer Method<br>
The method that a racemic mixture is chemically reacted with an optically-active reagent to give a mixture of diastereamer, which is subjected to an ordinary separation means (e.g., fractional recrystallization, chromatography, etc.) to give a single compound, which is then subjected to a chemical treatment (e.g., hydrolysis reaction etc.) to separate the optically-active reagent site from the compound to give an optical isomer. For example, where compound of the present invention has a hydroxy or a primary or secondary amino in the molecule, the compound and an optically-active organic acid (e.g., MTPA [a-methoxy-a-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-acetic acid], (-)-menthoxyacetic acid, etc.) or the like are subjected to condensation reaction to give the respectively corresponding ester or amide diastereomer. On the other hand, where compound of the present invention has a carboxylic acid group, the compound and an optically-active amine or alcohol reagent are subjected to condensation reaction to give an amide or ester diastereomer. The separated diastereomer is then subjected to acidic or basic hydrolysis reaction, through which it is converted into the optical isomer of the original compound.<br>

Using rat C6 glioma cells, the GDNF production promoting action of the compound of the present invention was evaluated.<br>
Rat C6 glioraa cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% EBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) in a collagen type 1 coated 75 cm2 culture flask (SUMITOMO BAKELITE Co., Ltd.) until near confluent, detached by trypsin treatment and washed once with DMEM containing 10% FBS.<br>
The cells after washing were diluted with 10% FBS-containing DMEM to a concentration of 5x104/mL and seeded at 0.3 mL/well in each well of collagen type 1 coated 48 well culture dish (SUMITOMO BAKELITE Co., Ltd.). After 3 days, the culture. in the culture dish was placed in a 1% BSA (bovine serum<br>
albumin, Sigma)-containing DMEM medium supplemented with various concentrations of test compound, and further cultured for 2 days. The culture supernatant was recovered and preserved at -80°C until measurement of GDNF.<br>
The content of GDNF in the culture supernatant was measured by the following ELISA Method.<br>
Anti-GDNF antibody (MAB212, R&amp;D) was diluted with TBS (Tris buffered physiological saline: 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mraol/L NaCl) to 2 mg/mL and dispensed at 0.1 mL/well to each well of a 96-well immunoplate. The 96-well inmunoplate was incubated overnight at 4°C and washed once with TBS containing Tween 20 at 0.05% (hereinafter to be abbreviated as TBST). A blocking solution (TBS containing 1% BSA and 5% sucrose) was added at 0.2 mL/well to each well after washing, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr., after which each well was washed twice with TBST. The culture supernatant (0.1 mL) of the aforementioned C6 cells was added to each well after washing and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 3 hrs., after which the wells were washed 5 times with TBST. The 500-fold diluted anti-GDNF antibody (G2791, Promega) was added by 0.1 mL to each well after washing, incubated at room temperature for 2 hrs. and washed 5 times with TBST. A 5000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-chicken IgY antibody (G1351, Promega) was added at 0.1 mL/well<br>
to each well after washing, incubated at room temperature for 2 hrs. and washed 5 times with TBST. A substrate solution (TMB substrate solution, BIO-RAB) was added at 0.1 mL/well to each well after washing and allowed to develop color at room temperature for 8 min. To stop the reaction, 0.1 mL of 1 mol/L phosphoric acid was added to each well in coloring developing reaction. The absorbance of the reaction solution at 450 nm wavelength was measured.<br>
In the same manner as above except the test compound was not used, the ELISA Method was performed and this was used as a control group.<br>
Using various concentrations of GDNF (Promega), ELISA Method was performed in the same manner as above and standard line was prepared.<br>
From the aforementioned absorbance and standard line, GDNF content in a sample was calculated and the concentration (EC50) , which causes 50% increase of GDNF relative to the control group was calculated from the regression line. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
As shown in Table 1, the compound of the present invention has GDNF production promoting action. Experimental Example 2<br>
Using PC12 cells, the neuroprotective action of the compound of the present invention was evaluated.<br>
PC12 cells were precultured for one day in a DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) culture solution containing 10% FCS (Fetal Calf Serum) in an incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, and seeded at 5xlO3/well in a 24 well plate (Falcon) in the same medium. After the cells adhered to the bottom surface, the culture was changed to a DMEM culture solution containing 0.5% FCS and 2 ng/raL of NGF (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) . After culturing overnight, the test compound was added at a concentration of 0.3-3.0 mmol/L and the cells were cultured for two more days. Gultalaldehyde was added to the cultured to a final concentration of 2% and the cells were fixed for 1 hr. , after which stained with a Diff-Quick (International Reagents Corporation). The cells were washed, dried with air and<br>
observed under a microscope.<br>
As a result, the cells treated with the compounds of Example 2, Example 49/ Example 60, Example 110, Example 149, Example 159, Example 161, Example 185, Example 192, Example 222 and Example 223 showed promoted formation of neurite network, which<br>
