				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a compressor oil diversion device. More particularly, the present invention concerns a system for diverting and collecting excess oil originating in the area of the shaft seal of the crankshaft of a reciprocating compressor.<br>
Background Art<br>
Refrigeration systems, such as the type used in transport refrigeration equipment, include, in the simplest form, a compressor, a condenser, an expansion device and an evaporator serially interconnected to form a closed refrigeration circulation path. Typically, such systems use a reciprocating type compressor that is lubricated by a lubricating oil which mixes with the refrigerant being compressed therein.<br>
A typical reciprocating compressor includes a piston reciprocating within a cylinder for mechanically compressing gaseous refrigerant. Appropriate manifolds and valves are provided to allow gas to be drawn into the cylinder during the down stroke of the piston and to be compressed during the up stroke.<br>
Oil is used in such compressors to lubricate the various parts and interfaces there between. To maintain refrigerant pressure within the compressor, mechanical shaft seals are used that deploy an oil film to seal against the leakage of pressurized gas and to lubricate the faces of the seal during operation. For example, such seals are used on the<br>
crankshaft of the compressor such as in the vicinity of the gland plate. Oil leakage across the seal faces is a common problem with any mechanical shaft seal. If such oil is allowed to leak unabated, external oil leakage through the crankcase can result. Typically such leakage is more visually unpleasing and alarming rather than detrimental to compressor function; however, such leakage often leads to unnecessary component replacement of the mechanical shaft seal components.<br>
Accordingly, devices have been deployed to divert excess oil from the crankshaft seal area to hide external leakages. One such device is an external masking device used on an open-drive compressor known as the Bock FKX40/465. The device allows oil to leak to an external pocket, which is open to the atmosphere, on the outside of the gland plate and then utilizes an absorbent material to capture the excess oil over flowing therefrom. The absorbent material is encapsulated by a band of spring steel that is wrapped around the outside diameter of the material which is in turn wrapped around the gland plate housing in proximity to the external pocket.<br>
While effective, these types of designs use an oil soaked external absorbent band which attracts dirt and can soil its surroundings, adding to the soiling of the external surfaces of the compressor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a compressor oil diversion device for use in a compressor having a housing, a crankshaft having shaft seals,<br>
refrigerant and a compression device for compressing the refrigerant, characterized:<br>
shaft sealing means using a lubricant for preventing compressor refrigerant from leaking out of the compressor housing;<br>
a space within said shaft sealing means where said  lubricants collects,<br>
diversion  means  for  directing  an  excess  amount  of said lubricant from said space; and<br>
a reactor for receiving said excess amount of said lubricant from said diversion means.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The invention as described herein will refer to a reciprocating compressor for use with an air conditioning or refrigeration system. Although this compressor is shown in a configuration and described relative to incorporation with a refrigeration circuit within an air conditioning system or a refrigeration system it is to be understood that this method of oil collection and diversion is equally applicable to other types of compressors, pumps and other applications.<br>
Referring now to FIG.l, shown is a compressor 10 including shell 12. Working pistons 14 are mounted for reciprocating movement within<br>
cylinders 16. Each piston is connected to crankshaft 18 via a connecting rod 20. Connecting rod 20 is secured around offset portion 22 of crankshaft 18. Crankshaft 18 includes counterbalance 24 for balancing the rotational irregularities in the crankshaft. The crankshaft is mounted and rotates within sleeve 28 and extends through shaft seal cavity 26 of housing 12.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 and 4, the crankshaft seal mechanism 31 is shown in greater detail at the point where the housing 12 is exited by the crankshaft. The crankshaft 18 passes through the spring assembly 45, shaft seal faces 29 and 33, gland plate 32 and lip seal 38. The face seal 33 is substantially cylindrical in shape and includes an O-ring 36, which holds it stationary within inner diameter A of the gland plate<br>
32.	The lip seal 38, located in gland plate adjacent to diameter A, in<br>
smaller diameter B, has the function of preventing dirt from entering<br>
the shaft seal cavity. An inner disc-shaped space 40 is located between<br>
face seal 33 and lip seal 38. As shown in FIG.3, a gland plate gasket<br>
35 is used to prevent seepage between the housing and gland plate.<br>
The crankshaft seal mechanism further includes a cylindrical body 44 formed from a resilient material, using oil between it and the crankshaft to act as a refrigerant seal. A spring 45 wrapped around the exterior of the body 44 and resting against the crankshaft seal thrust face provides axial loading between the two shaft seal faces 29 and<br>
33.	The two faces are loaded such that, with the use of oil, they will<br>
act as a refrigerant seal. In the prior art, where oil passing across the<br>
two shaft seal faces is not removed or redirected, it will pass through<br>
crankshaft to the lip seal interface that is located as shown in FIG. 3, leading to leakage and soiling of the external surfaces of the compressor. This external leakage and soiling often leads to incorrect conclusions that a serious mechanical problem exists with the compressor.<br>
The invention as provided herein operates to remove the excess oil to prevent detrimental effects thereof. Referring to FIF.5, in accordance with the principles of the present invention, a first passage 48 is provided in gland plate 32 that leads to a second passage 50 in housing 12, which further leads to a receiver, and in the one embodiment, an internal cavity 53. Accordingly, excess oil leaves space 40 through first passage 48, within which it travels to second passage 50 in the crankcase housing. Oil then travels within second passage 50 to internal cavity 53. hi the preferred embodiment, the internal cavity is elongated and accepts an elongated cartridge or insert 54, also shown in FIG.6, having an elongated portion formed of an absorbent material for absorbing the oil within internal cavity 53. Within the scope of the invention, the cavity could have other shapes or configurations, with a complimentary shaped cartridge or insert, hi the preferred embodiment, the cartridge 54, includes an elongated absorbent portion 56 and a connecting portion 58. The crankcase housing at the external end of cavity 53, in one embodiment, is threaded to engage a threaded interface 59 of connection portion 58 of cartridge 54, securing the insert within cavity 53 for the absorption of<br>
oil. Other connection interfaces could be used as well such as a snap fit, tapered force fit or rotatably locking fit as long as such connections make an appropriate seal and secure connection, and allow the cartridge or insert to be easily removed for servicing. Threaded end 58 includes a weep hold 60. Hole 60 equalizes the pressure in the crankcase oil cavity with atmospheric pressure, allowing the oil to drain freely from the crankcase oil cavity to the internal oil cavity 53. The weep hole 60 further acts as a visual indicator as to when the cartridge 54 is full of oil, and replacement is needed, as oil will begin to weep from the hold when saturation is reached. Upon saturation, the cartridge can be removed in the field and replaced with a new cartridge, easing serviceability of the compressor. An alternative design to the absorbent cartridge described above is a cartridge or insert configured as described but with an integral well, as opposed to an absorbent material, for collecting the excess lubricant, which could be removed and emptied.<br>
hi another embodiment, an external collection reservoir, as shown in FIG. 7, is used as the receiver. Accordingly, reservoir 70 is mounted to the compressor housing 12 via a bolt 71 and includes an inlet 72 mounted to an outlet 74, shown in FIG.8, on housing 12. Inlet 72 receives oil from outlet 74 which receives oil from passage 50, which is diverted similar to as described above from space 40 (See FIG. 5), but for this embodiment, to the outlet 74. Outlet 74 is preferably threaded 75 but inlet 72 of reservoir 70 is not so that an interface is formed between the inlet and outlet which allows the excess oil to pass to the reservoir while also allowing a pressure venting action to occur. The threads allow for a path through which the pressure can be<br>
vented. Accordingly, oil is collected in the external reservoir and can be emptied while being serviced.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 9, in place of the external reservoir, a tube 80 is used as the receiver and is attached via connecting end 81 to housing 12 at outlet 74, through which oil can be directed for draining. As shown in FIG.9, tube 80 includes a preformed segment 82, connected to vertically, downward extending tube-portion 84. Segment 82 is U-shaped, forming a trap which will fill with waste-compressor or excess oil being drained, and will prevent atmospheric moisture and debris from entering back into the compressor housing via the tube. While the invention has been described in reference to a preferred embodiment and a particular type of compressor, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention and the invention could be applied to different types of compressors or other mechanisms incorporating similar type shaft seals.<br><br><br><br>
