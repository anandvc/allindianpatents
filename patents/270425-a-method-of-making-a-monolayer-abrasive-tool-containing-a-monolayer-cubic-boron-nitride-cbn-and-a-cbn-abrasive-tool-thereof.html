				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making a monolayer abrasive tool used<br>
in surface grinding and said tool. The present invention particularly relates to such<br>
tools employing a brazing process for bonding a monolayer of cBN cubic boron<br>
nitride grits to a substrate with uniform grit spacing and bond uniformity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, brazing of abrasive particles to a suitable substrate has gained<br>
importance in the material processing industry with a view to manufacturing tools<br>
which can out perform conventional galvanically bonded tool. In principle the<br>
advantage of brazing lies in the fact that the chemical nature of bonding as obtained<br>
during brazing allows low bond coverage to hold the grits than that required in<br>
mechanical type bonding in galvanic process. This feature results in large grit<br>
protrusion and hence large chip clearance space in the brazed tool in comparison to<br>
that in galvanically bonded wheel for a given grit density on both the wheels.<br>
According to US Patents 3894673 and 4018576 first monolayer diamond brazed<br>
tool which could outperform galvanic type diamond tools uses hard durable Ni-Cr<br>
based alloys. It is further claimed that soft low melting point braze alloy such as<br>
silver/copper eutectic and near eutectic composition containing a relatively...........<br>
small amount of titanium which could readily wet diamond foils to<br>
form a bond exhibiting adequate mechanical properties which would<br>
retain the diamond particles under rigorous grinding and cutting<br>
application of commercial acceptance. Such brazed diamond tools<br>
could not compete with the electroplated tools. It is also<br>
claimed that Ni-Cr alloys are superior to Ag-Cu base soft alloys<br>
in terms of higher mechanical strength and resistance to swarf<br>
abrasion and diamond grit retention. However, the said patent did<br>
not teach about any merits or demerits of Ag—Cu base alloys and<br>
Ni--Cr alloys in making monolayer cBN grinding wheel and its<br>
performance with respect to galvanic type cBN grinding wheel.<br>
It has been first revealed (US Patent 5,129,918) that Ni-Cr base<br>
alloys cannot wet or bond cBN grits effectively. Good wetting is<br>
possible when cBN grits coated with a film of TiC, CrC (US Patent<br>
5,129,918) or Sic (US Patent 5,389t118). Even a Cr free Ni-base<br>
alloy can wet and bond TiC coated or CrC coated cBN particles. It<br>
is further claimed (US Patent 5,492,771) that single layer cBN<br>
brazed wheel fabricated with Ag-Cu eutectic alloy containing<br>
small amount of Ti is less performing than a corresponding<br>
galvanically bonded cBN wheel. It is mentioned in the said patent<br>
that Ag—Cu—In alloy (combined amount of Ag and Cu at least 70%,<br>
Indium 8-15% by weight) containing small amount of Ti sufficient<br>
to wet and bond cBN grits could only out perform the galvanically<br>
bonded cBN wheel. It is claimed that the primary difference<br>
between the exceptional performance of the braze alloy as<br>
mentioned in the said patent for bonding a monolayer of cBN<br>
particles on the tool and failure of the less strong eutectic and<br>
near eutectic silver/copper alloys to make commercially<br>
acceptable abrasive tools appears to be relatively small increase<br>
in yield strength. In the said patent it has also been mentioned<br>
by way of example that performance of cBN wheel fabricated with<br>
Ag-Cu eutectic alloy containing small amount of Ti is 10%<br>
inferior to a galvanically bonded monolayer cBN interms of number<br>
of parts produced whereas performance of monolayer cBN wheel<br>
brazed with Ag-Cu-In alloy (Ag 61.5%, Cu 24%, In 14.5) containing<br>
small amount of Ti was improved by 60% with respect to the<br>
galvanically bonded monolayer cBN wheel.<br>
However, it has been found by the applicant that the brazed cBN<br>
wheel with high grit protrusion than that of galvanically bonded<br>
cBN wheel and having similar grit concentration as that of<br>
galvanic type shows no advantage in grinding steel with high<br>
material removal rate. This is observed for both unhardened and<br>
hardened bearing steels. Three brazing alloys viz. Ag—Cu<br>
eutectic with small amount of Ti, Ag 61.5% Cu 25%, In 14.5%<br>
containing small amount of Ti and a Ni-Cr base braze alloy<br>
containing 76% Ni , 14% Cr, 10%P were used to fabricate three<br>
brazed monolayer cBN wheel. For Ni-Cr braze alloy TiC<br>
Coated cBN grits were used. The brazed cBN wheels did not have any problem<br>
of bond erosion by abrasion of grinding swarf and its effect on retention of cBN<br>
particle in the bond. The grinding wheels experienced wheel loading leading to<br>
premature failure of the wheel. This observation points to the fact that just by<br>
increasing the grit protrusion, life of monolayer cBN grinding wheel cannot be<br>
increased. Similarly increase of yield strength of the braze material did not<br>
necessarily mean an improved performance of the same. It can be very well realized<br>
that for monolayer diamond abrasive tool which machines abrasive materials<br>
producing frangmented or gritty chips, wheel loading is not the main mode of<br>
failure. It has been found that improved abrasion reaistance of Ni-Cr alloy<br>
compared to galvanic Ni-bond is advantageous in holding the diamond crystals on<br>
the tool substrate. Additionally large protrusion of diamond grit in brazed wheel<br>
leads to extended tool life for brazing wheel in comparison to galvanically bonded<br>
wheel.<br>
It is further noted that one of the essential requirement of brazed cBN tool for free<br>
and fast cutting is the uniformity of the bonding layer over the entire working<br>
surface of the abrasing tool.<br>
It has been found that AG-Cu eutectic or near eutectic tool...............<br>
containing small amount of Ti when applied in the form of a paste layer, during<br>
brazing, not only wets cBN grits but flows well on the plain carbon steel substrate<br>
making uniform bond level on the substrate. Similar result was also obtained when<br>
Ti coated cBN grits are used with Ag-Cu eutectic near eutectic alloy containing<br>
no Ti.<br>
Also, during brazing with the Ag-Cu-In braze alloy (contained amount of Ag and<br>
Cu at least 70%, Indium 8-15% by weight) containing small amount of Ti (USA<br>
Patent 5,492,771) uniform bond level could be obtained on the plain carbon steel<br>
substrate.<br>
However, it is also known that for brazing purpose, stainless steel, tool steel are<br>
particularly suitable because of their general resistance to wrapage or dimension<br>
instability during high temperature processing. Similarly tungsten carbide would be<br>
a better candidate as the substrate instead of steel because it is not only stable at<br>
brazing temperature but also having higher rigidity than steel.<br>
The applicants have found that Ag-Cu base alloys with or without any addition of<br>
Ti, when applied on high speed steel, stainless steel or (Tungstel Carbide) WC<br>
substrate could not form uniform bond level during brazing of cBN grit. During<br>
brazing of cBN grits with Ag-Cu-In ................................................<br>
alloy (contained amount of Ag and Cu at; least 70%, Indium 8-15% by<br>
weight) containing small amount of Ti (Re: USA Patent 5,498,771)<br>
uniform bond level could not form on high speed steel, stainless<br>
steel and tungsten carbide substrate.<br>
Two step brazing wherein the filler material was applied to the<br>
substrate in the form of paste and then melted followed by<br>
deposition of cBN particles on the solidified layer and<br>
subsequent brazing, however, did not bring about any improvement<br>
in the uniformity of the bonded layer.<br>
Thus, there remains a demand for a low cost practical method of<br>
brazing of a monolayer of cBN grits to substrate like carbon<br>
steel, stainless steel, alloy steel like high speed steel,<br>
tungsten carbide-colbalt composite.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to provide a cBN<br>
abrasive wheel.<br>
Another object of the present invention is a method of<br>
manufacturing a cBN abrasive wheel which can satisfy the<br>
requirement of load free grinding.<br>
With this object in view, the main aspect of the present<br>
invention is to provide a cBN abrasive tool comprising a steel or<br>
cemented carbide substrate and a single layer of cBN grit bonded<br>
to thesaid substrate by a brazing alloy characterized in that the<br>
said cBN abrasive tool satisfies the requirement of load free<br>
grinding.<br>
The present invention provides a method of making a monolayer<br>
abrasive tool containing a monolayer cubic boron nitride (cBN)<br>
abrasive grit bonded to a steel substrate and which method<br>
comprises of the following steps —<br>
a) applying uniformly on the surface of a plain carbon<br>
steel substrate, a brazing paste made of Ag-Cu eutectic<br>
alloy (72% Ag.28% Cu) mixed with 1% to 3% of titanium<br>
or titaniumhydride powder;<br>
b) placing cBN grits (mono crystalline/microcrystalline<br>
type )said brazing paste in a manner that a monolayer<br>
configuration of the grits with inter-grit spacing of<br>
50 µm to 250 µm is obtained;<br>
c) uniformly placing said grit on the surface of said<br>
steel substrate with the help of a sieve or mesh of<br>
specific size so that only one grit of a particular<br>
grit size may pass through the mesh;<br>
d) drying the tool substrate along with the brazing paste<br>
and a cBN grit placed on it at a temperature varying<br>
from 75 oC - 125 oC for 5 to 15 minutes to remove<br>
volatile materials from the brazing paste;<br>
e) placing the abrasive tool specimen in a vacuum brazing<br>
furnace, where vacuum in the order of 2x10-5 Torr to<br>
8x10-6 Torr is obtained in 10 to 12 min. with help of a<br>
rotary pump and a diffusion pump.<br>
f) raising the temperature of the tool, specimen to the<br>

chamber never rises above 5x10-5 Torr;<br>
g) maintaining the temperature of the tool specimen for<br>
0.5 mimutes to 5 minutes; and<br>

grits bonded to the said substrate by a braze alloy which offers<br>
load free grinding wherein the abrasive tool is provided with<br>
high grit protrusion, regular grit distribution and adequate grit<br>
spacing to overcome failure by wheel loading.<br>
In said cBN abrasive tool, cBN grits are disbributed in a<br>
predetermined pattern on the braze layer applied on the substrate<br>
and are not displaced during brazing, when the braze alloy<br>
becomes totally liquid and remain in the same position and no<br>
clamping device is required to hold grits in respective position.<br>
The braze alloys comprise of passive Ag-Cu base alloys capable of<br>
wetting and bonding Ti coated cBN or Ag-Cu base active alloys<br>
capable of wetting and bonding uncoated cBN grits at temperatures<br>
below 950oC where during brazing, said braze alloy hold the cBN<br>
grits intact in their position without causing any displacement<br>
of grits and capable of forming uniform bond layer on the plain<br>
carbon steel substrate.<br>
In the cBN abrasive tool of the present invention Ag-Cu passive<br>
or Ag-Cu active alloys are incapable of providing uniform bond<br>
layer during brazing of cBN grits on stainless steel, high speed<br>
steel and tungsten carbide substrate but are capable of providing<br>
uniform bond layer when the surface of the said substrate<br>
materials are modified.<br>
The said substrate in the abrasive tool are coated with a film<br>
of titanium nickel. Said substrate may also be coated with a<br>
primary coating of titanium and a secondary coating of nickel.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will now described in detail with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings wherein<br>
Figure 1 shows the cross sectional view of an monolayer abrasive<br>
disc or tool embodying the present invention, and<br>
Figure 2 shows another example of cBN abrasive tool as<br>
illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
In the accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional view of an illustrative disc<br>
embodying the invention wherein cubic boron nitride <cbn></cbn>
abrasive particles 'D' are bonded to the circular disc substrate<br>
'A' in a monolayer configuration by the layer of a brazing alloy<br>
'B' having a thickness C. The principal characteristic features<br>
of the cBN abrasive wheel are grit protrusion 'E' above the braze<br>
layer and the inter grit spacing 'F' along the periphery of the<br>
disc .<br>
Cross-sectional view in Figure 2 illustrates another example of<br>
the cBN abrasive tool described in Fig.1. In this instance the<br>
cBN grits 'D' are provided with a surface coating 'E'. The<br>
circular disc substrate 'A' is also provided with a coating 'B'<br>
on its peripheral surface.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the course of invention it has been observed by the<br>
applicant that the problem of wheel loading which occurs in the<br>
grinding wheels offering large chip clearance space through high<br>
crystal protrusion can be solved if all the grits on the working<br>
surface are bonded to the tool body keeping uniform space between<br>
The adjacent grits unlike that of a galvanic type wheel where grit density is high and<br>
spacing is also not uniform. However, according to the principle of grinding, with<br>
increase of grit spacing, ie. low grit density, chip volume to be removed by each<br>
grit also increases and apparently there is no advantage in increasing the light-grit<br>
spacing.<br>
During the course of invention it has been also found by the applicant that Ti or<br>
TiC coated cBN grits which are wetted by commercially available Ni-Cr based<br>
braze alloy can be precisely placed in a regular pattern on the braze paste layer of<br>
the said braze alloy applied on the carbon steel substrate. But the grits shifted from<br>
their location during brazing when the alloy becomes totally molten and present grit<br>
spacing on the wheel surface cannot be maintained.<br>
This behaviour of the Ni-Cr based brazed alloy can be regarded as the major<br>
incapability of the braze alloy in manufacturing abrasive tool with predetermined<br>
grit spacing and got unnoticed by those skilled in the art and this was never reported.<br>
Surprisingly it has been further found by the applicant that when Ag-Cu base<br>
eutectic alloy used for brazing; same Ti coated cBN grits placed precisely in a<br>
regular pattern keeping a well defined spacing between the adjacent grits on the<br>
braze paste layer applied to the carbon steel substrate, did not shift from<br>
the adjacent grits unlike that of a galvanic type wheel where<br>
grit density is high and spacing is also not uniform. However,<br>
according to the principle of grinding, with increase of grit-<br>
spacing i.e. low grit density, chip volume to be removed by each<br>
grit also increases and apparently there is no advantage in<br>
increasing the inter-grit spacing.<br>
During the course of invention it has been also found by the<br>
applicant that Ti or TiC coated/cBN grits which are wetted by<br>
commercially available Ni-Cr based braze alloy can be precisely<br>
placed in a regular pattern on the braze paste layer of the said<br>
braze alloy applied on the carbon steel substrate. But the grit©<br>
shifted from their location during brazing when the alloy becomes<br>
totally molten and preset grit spacing on the wheel surface<br>
cannot be maintained.<br>
This behaviour of the Ni-Cr based brazed alloy can be regarded as<br>
the major incapability of the braze alloy in manufacturing<br>
abrasive tool with predetermined grit spacing and got unnoticed<br>
by those skilled in the and this was never reported.<br>
Surprisingly it has been further found by the applicant that when<br>
Ag-Cu base eutectic alloy used for brazing; same Ti coated cBN<br>
grits placed precisely in a regular pattern keeping a well<br>
defined spacing between the adjacent grits on the braze paste<br>
layer applied to the carbon steel substrate, did not shift from<br>
their initial position during brazing. Preset position of cBN<br>
grits could be precisely maintained even when the alloy became<br>
liquid totally. Similar behaviour was also discovered with Ag-Cu<br>
eutectic or near eutectic alloy containing small amount of Ti<br>
during brazing of uncoated cBN grits on plain carbon steel<br>
substrate.<br>
This behaviour of the braze alloy can be regarded as its<br>
remarkable capability in the manufacture of a abrasive tool with<br>
predetermined grit setting without the requirment of any fixture<br>
for holding the grits in position when braze alloy became<br>
completely liquid and it is quite surprising that such behaviour<br>
of the Ag-Cu base alloy has gone completely unnoticed by those<br>
skilled in the art. This characteristics of the Ag-Cu alloy is<br>
truly unexpected, when one consider the facts that similar<br>
characteristics has not been demonstrated by Ni or Ni-Cr base<br>
brazing alloys.<br>
The cBN wheel with uniform grit spacing comprising of a<br>
substrate, Ti coated cBN grit and Ag-Cu alloy or uncoated cBN<br>
grit and Ag-Cu-Ti active alloy has revealed the fact that<br>
grinding performance of this wheel could surpass that of<br>
galvanically bonded wheel and this has escaped the notice of<br>
those skilled in the art. It was only revealed that to make high<br>
performance wheel use of Ni-Cr alloy or Ag-Cu-In-Ti alloy is not<br>
sufficient. On the other hand, by ascertaining the<br>
characteristics of Ag-Cu alloy it was possible to overcome the<br>
limitations of the brazed cBN in a very simple way. For cBN wheel<br>
which is prone to failure like wheel loading in dry grinding of<br>
hardened and unhardened material at high material removal rite,<br>
the problem can be solved by using the new method as disclosed in<br>
the invention and this has gone completely unnoticed by those<br>
skilled in the arts. The available yield strength of Ag-Cu or Ag-<br>
Cu-Ti alloy was found to be adequate to prevent failure of the<br>
cBN wheel by mechanical failure of the braze alloy. However,<br>
there is no limitation in using Ag-Cu base alloys with higher<br>
yield strength provided they show the same characteristics that<br>
is in the liquid state, the braze alloy will not casue any<br>
movement of the grit from its initial set position and grit<br>
spacing can be maintained during brazing.<br>
Braze filler metals are available commercially or can be prepared<br>
based on system other than Cu-Ag provided the braze alloy can wet<br>
Ti coated cBN or when activated can also wet uncoated cBN grit<br>
and also show the same characteristics as found with Ag—Cu alloy<br>
in the present invention.<br>
It is obvious that exact grit spacing will depend on the material<br>
removal rate, ductility of the work material. It will be<br>
appreciated that grit spacing should be chosen so that chip<br>
clogging and wheel loading is avoided. Unnecessary increase in grit spacing will<br>
increase specific grinding force on each grit and may cause rapid grit wear by<br>
fracture. However, according to the specific grit force, the friability of the grit can<br>
be changed. Similarly size of the grit can also be changed.<br>
During the course of invention it was also found that the Ag-Cu base alloys applied<br>
to the tool steel, stainless steel or tungsten carbide substrate in the form of a paste<br>
can easily form a uniform bond level during brazing of cBN grits when the surface<br>
chemistry of the substrate is modified. The choice of the coating may depend on the<br>
type braze material, ie. whether the braze material is a passive not containing any<br>
active element like Ti or an active braze alloy containing transition elements like Ti.<br>
Similarly the coating deposition technique may be CVD, PVD which depends on<br>
the material of substrate, geometry of the substrate and the film desired to be<br>
deposited. For economic reason it is obvious that conventional or well established<br>
techniques may be used but in principle there is no limitation imposed on use of<br>
non-conventional deposition technique. The thickness of the coating should be as<br>
minimum as possible but sufficient to cover the entire surface of the substrate. The<br>
purpose of the coating is only to change the surface chemistry of the substrate.<br>
Generally speaking 1~2 µm thick coating would be sufficient for the said purpose.<br>
The................................................................................................<br>
deposition may be high temperature or low temperature process. It is also evident<br>
that coating material improves its adhesion with the substrate during brazing<br>
operation when some thermochemical interaction takes place between the film and<br>
the substrate.<br>
The present invention has been described in more detail and can be appreciated from<br>
the following examples, which are in no way intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example I - Small cylindrical grinding wheels were fabricated using a plain carbon<br>
steel substrate and monolayer of cBN grits and silter-copper eutectic alloy. The<br>
silver-copper brazing alloy "Cusil" from WESGO Inc, USA in the form of paste<br>
was applied uniformly on the round surface of the plain carbon steel substrate. This<br>
was followed by placement of cBN grits in monolayer configuration with<br>
predetermined inter grit spacing. The cBN grits were of size B151 (150 µm/125<br>
um mesh width) of grade Borazon 510 (Ti coated cBN) from General Electric<br>
Company. Uniform placement of grit could be done with the help of a sieve or<br>
mesh, the holes in which could accept just one grit at a time. The size of the hole<br>
would be such just to allow the largest grit to pass through. The pitch of the hole<br>
would be determined by the requirement of grit spacing. There could be other<br>
methlod of placement of grit in a regular pattern. The braze layer in the form of<br>
paste could hold the grits at their deposited position temporarily without any<br>
difficulty. The ..................................................................................<br>
tool specimen was then dried at 100oC for 15 min to remove<br>
excessive volatile materials. The tool specimen was then placed<br>
inside a vacuum brazing furnace. Rough vacuum in the order of<br>
10-2 Torr was obtained in 8 min by the rotary pump and a vacuum<br>
better than 1 x 10-5 Torr could be obtained in 15 min by<br>
connecting the diffusion pump, Temperature was then raised to<br>
450o C and kept at that point for about 1 min followed by further<br>
increase to 850oC in 4 minute™ The specimen was held at<br>
temperature for just 1 min. This was followed by cooling under<br>
same atmosphere i.e., in vacuum not less than 1 x 10-5 Torr. The<br>
brazed tool specimen was then removed from the furnace for<br>
physical examination. The Ti coated cBN grits were effectively<br>
wetted by the "Passive" Ag-Cu eutectic alloy. The braze layer<br>
also maintained its uniformity throughout, the working surface.<br>
The cBN grits were found to set to the substrate in the same<br>
location where those were placed before brazing and on<br>
displacement of grit took place.<br>
Example II<br>
The brazing process of Example I was define carried out except that<br>
grits were uncoated cBN of grade Borazon 500 and the braze alloy<br>
was an active braze alloy prepared by adding 2% by wet of<br>
titanium hydride with commercially available Ag-Cu eutectic braze<br>
alloy powder "Cusil" from WESGO. It is pbvious that titanium<br>
hydride powder was thoroughly mixed with the eutectic powder to<br>
obtain a good homogenity of the active metal in order that upon<br>
melting necessary wetting properties of the liquid could be<br>
obtained through out the entire mass. After brazing the cBN<br>
grits were seen not only to have good bond with the braze alloy<br>
but also to maintain the same location where those were placed<br>
before brazing and no displacement of grit took place.<br>
Example III<br>
The brazing process of example II was carried out except that the<br>
grits were uncoated microcrystalline cBN grit of grade Borszon<br>
570 from Beneral Electric with grit size B 151. After brazing,<br>
microcrystalline grits were found to be effectively wetted by the<br>
brazing alloy. The braze also maintained a low but uniform level<br>
throughout the working surface of the tool resulting in large<br>
Crystal protrusion. The microcrystal1ine cBN grits were found to<br>
S~et to the substrate in the same location, where those were<br>
placed before brazing and no displacement of grit took place.<br>
Example IV<br>
The brazing process of example III was carried out except that<br>
substrate material was a sustentic stainless steel and the<br>
substrate was coated 1~2 um thick PV (Physical Vapour<br>
Deposition) Ti. After brazing a uniform braze layer was obtained<br>
on the working surface of the grinding wheel resulting in large<br>
grit protrusion. The microcrystal1ine cBN grits were found to<br>
set to the substrate in the same position where those were placed<br>
before brazing and no displacement of grit took place.<br>
Example V<br>
The brazing process of example IV was carried out except that the<br>
substrate material was martensitic stainless steel and the<br>
s<br>
substrate was coated with 1~2 µm thick PVD Ti Coating. After<br>
brazing a uniform braze layer was obtained on the working surface<br>
of the grinding wheel resulting in large crystal protrusion. The<br>
microcrystal1ine cBN grits were found to have bonded to the<br>
substrate and remain in the same position where such grits were<br>
placed before brazing and no displacement of cBN grits occurred<br>
during brazing.<br>
Example VI<br>
The brazing process of example I was carried except that<br>
stainless<br>
substrate was austentic/steel and the substrate was coated with<br>
a primary coating of PVD Ti and secondary coating of galvanic<br>
Ni. After brazing a containuous and uniform layer of braze alloy<br>
was obtained which wetted and bonded the cBN crystals resulting<br>
in large crystal protrusion. The cBN grits were found to set to<br>
the substrate in the same location where those were fixed before<br>
brazing and no displacement of grit took place during brazing.<br>
Example VII<br>
The brazing process of example VI was carried except that<br>
substrate was hardmetal having 94% WC and 6% Co. The substrate<br>
was coated with a primary coating Ti and a secondary coating of<br>
Ni. After the 'one step' brazing a continuous and uniform layer<br>
of braze alloy was obtained. The cBN grits were found to set to<br>
the substrate in the same location where those were placed before<br>
brazing and no displacement of grit occurred during brazing.<br>
The product resulting from the practice of the invention<br>
represents a significant advancement in the construction of<br>
monolayer cBN abrasive tool. This advancement can be easily<br>
realized when one compares the performance of brazed tool with<br>
galvanic type cBN tool.<br>

Environment : dry.<br><br>
Sign used in the Table 1<br>
a) 41 : 10 = wheel speed of 41 m/s and downfeed of 10 µm<br>
b)v = the wheel behaviour became steady after few passes<br>
of spark-in grinding<br>
c) X = the wheel loading occurred just after few spark—in<br>
grinding passes and the wheel had to be withdrawn.<br>
Long duration grinding test<br>
1) With 27.5 m/s wheel speed, 30 µm down feed and 4 m/min table<br>
speed, galvanic wheel could remove a specific volume 40<br>
mm3 /mm2 working surface, when the forces rose to a high<br>
value indicating wheel loading. On the other hand brazed<br>
type tool could remove as high as 100 mm3 /mm2 specific<br>
volume of work material without any sign of rise of grinding<br>
force and use the brazed cBN tool could be extended further.<br>
ii) At higher material removed rate i.e., with 41 m/s wheel<br>
speed, 40 µm down feed and 4 m/min table speed, galvanic<br>
wheel could remove a specific volume of 20 mm /mm before<br>
wheel was withdrawn because of wheel wear and loading leading<br>
to high grinding force. The brazed type wheel could remove a<br>
specific volume of 60 mm3 /mm2 before it was withdrawn.<br>
