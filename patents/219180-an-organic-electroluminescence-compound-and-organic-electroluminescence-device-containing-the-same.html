DESCRIPTION<br>
MATERIAL FOR ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENCE ELEMENT, AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENCE ELEMENT USING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to materials for organic electroluminescence element (an organic electroluminescence element will be referred to as an organic electroluminescence device, hereinafter), and organic electroluminescence element made by using the same, and more particularly to materials for organic electroluminescence devices ("electroluminescence" will be referred to as "EL", hereinafter) which exhibit a high current efficiency even when applying a low voltage thereto, and emit a blue light, and electroluminescence devices (organic EL devices) made by using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The organic EL devices made by using organic substances have been expected to be applied to production of full-color wide screen image display devices of a solid state light emission type at reasonable prices, and have been intensively developed.    In general, the organic EL devices are constituted from a light emitting layer and a pair of counter electrodes between which the light emitting layer is sandwiched.<br>
In the organic EL devices, when an electric field is applied between the electrodes, electrons are injected into the light emitting layer from a cathode, whereas holes are injected into the light emitting layer from an anode.    The electrons and holes injected are recombined in the light emitting layer, so that the light emitting layer is brought into a excited state.   When the light emitting layer is returned from the excited state to a ground state, an energy is released in the form of light.<br>
As the light emitting materials, chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum complexes, cumarin derivatives, tetraphenyl butadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives and oxadiazole derivatives<br><br>
are known.    It is reported that light in the visible region ranging from blue light to red light can be obtained by using these light emitting materials, and development of a device exhibiting color images is expected (for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. Heissei 8(l996)-239665, Heisei 7(1995)-138561 and Heisei 3(l99l)-200289, etc.).<br>
Recently, although displays using the organic EL devices have now been used in practical applications, full-color image display devices using the same are still in the course of development.    Therefore, it has been demanded to develop organic EL devices having especially a high current efficiency as well as a long lifetime.<br>
To overcome these problems, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-100476 discloses devices having a light emitting layer containing a phosphorescent compound and an electron transporting material composed of an azole compound, but does not specifically describe a current efficiency, luminance and lifetime thereof.    Therefore, it is not sure whether these devices are practically usable or not.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems. An object of the present invention is to provide materials for organic EL devices having a high current efficiency, and organic EL devices utilizing the materials.<br>
As a result of extensive researches for accomplishing the above object, the inventors have found that organic EL devices made by using as a material therefor, a compound with a specific condensed ring structure having a nitrogen atom are capable of exhibiting a high current efficiency even upon applying a low electric voltage thereto.    The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the above finding.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a material for organic electroluminescent devices, comprising a compound represented by the following general formula (l):<br><br>
cycloalkyl group having 5 to 40 carbon atoms.<br>
Also, the present invention provides an organic EL device comprising a cathode, an anode and one or more organic thin film layers having at least a light emitting layer which are sandwiched between the cathode and the anode, said organic thin film layers comprising at least one layer containing the above material for organic EL devices.   Among the organic thin film layers, the light-emitting layer, an electron transporting layer or a hole transporting layer preferably contains the above material for organic EL devices.<br>

The material for organic EL devices according to the present invention which comprises any of the compounds represented by the general formulae (l) to (13) has a singlet energy gap of 2.9 to 3.9 eV and preferably 2.9 to 3.6 eV.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention comprises a cathode, an anode and one or more organic thin film layers having at least a light emitting layer which are sandwiched between the cathode and the anode, wherein the organic thin film layers comprises at least one layer containing the material for organic electroluminescent devices which is made of any of the compounds represented by the general formulae (l) to (13).<br>
Also, in the organic EL device of the present invention, the light emitting layer, electron transporting layer and hole transporting layer preferably contain the material for organic EL devices which is made of any of the compounds represented by the above general formulae (l) to (13).<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention emits a bluish light having a high color purity ranging from (0.20, 0.38) to (0.26, 0.39) in a chromaticity coordinate.    This is because the material for organic EL devices which is made of any of the compounds represented by the above general formulae (l) to (13) has a broad energy gap.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention preferably emits light by triplet or more multiplet excitation.<br>
The material for organic EL devices according to the present invention is preferably a host material of the organic EL device.    The host material means a material capable of injecting holes and electrons thereinto and transporting the holes and electrons therethrough, and having a function of emitting a fluorescent light by recombination between the holes and electrons.<br>
In addition, the compounds represented by the above general formulae (1) to (13) which are used in the present invention have a singlet energy gap as high as 2.9 to 3.9 eV as well as a triplet energy gap as high as 2.5 to 3.3 eV and is, therefore , suitable as an organic host material for phosphorescent devices.<br><br>
The phosphorescent device used herein means such an organic electroluminescent device utilizing a so-called phosphorescent light which contains such substances having a higher intensity of emitted light based on the transition from a triplet energy level ro a ground singlet energy level than that of other substances, for example, phosphorescent substances such as organic metal complexes containing at least one metal selected from the group consisting of those metals belonging to Groups 7 to 11 of the Periodic Table.<br>
Molecular excitons (excited particles) generated in the light emitting layer of the organic EL device is in the form of a mixture containing singlet excitons and triplet excitons. In general, the singlet and triplet excitons are generated at a ratio of 1-3, namely, the triplet excitons are generated in a larger amount than the singlet excitons. In addition, in the organic EL device utilizing an ordinary fluorescence, the singlet excitons contribute to light emission, and the triplet excitons are not light emissive. Therefore, the triplet excitons are finally consumed in the form of heat, and the light emission depends upon the singlet excitons generated at a low rate.    For this reason, in the organic EL device, among energy generated by the recombination of the holes and electrons, the energy shifted to production of the triplet excitons constitutes a large loss.<br>
On the contrary, in the present invention, by utilizing the above compounds in the phosphorescent device, the energy of the triplet excitons can contribute to light emission. As a result, it is considered that the current efficiency obtained from the organic EL device of the present invention is three times that obtained from devices utilizing a fluorescence. Further, it is considered that the compounds of the present invention, when applied to the light emitting layer of the phosphorescent device, exhibits a higher excitation triplet energy level than that of the phosphorescent organic metal complexes containing the metal selected from the group consisting of those metals belonging to Groups 7 to 11 of the Periodic Table which are contained in the light emitting layer! provides a further stable thin film shape; has a high glass transition temperature Tg ranging from 80 to 160°C; is capable of efficiently transporting the holes and electrons; shows a good electrochemical or chemical<br><br>
stability; and is free from generation of impurities which will tend to cause traps or to quench light emission upon production or use.<br>

The thus cleaned glass substrate with a transparent electrode was attached to a substrate holder of a vacuum deposition apparatus.   First, a 10 nnrthick film made of the following copper phthalocyanine (CuPc film) was formed on a surface of the substrate where the transparent electrode was provided, so as to cover the transparent electrode. The thus formed CuPc film functioned as a hole injecting layer. Successively, a 30 nnrthick film made of 4,4'-bis[N-(l-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (film made of the below-mentioned orNPD) was formed on the CuPc film. The thus formed crNPD film functioned as a hole transporting layer.    Further, a 30 nnrthick light emitting layer was formed on the orNPD film by vapor-depositing the foregoing compound (D35) on page 25 as a host material on the a-NPD film.    Simultaneously with formation of the light emitting layer, Ir-bis[(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N, C2]picolinate (corresponding to the foregoing compound (K&gt;23) on page 34) as a phosphorescent Ir metal complex dopant was added thereto.

Then; a 30 nnrthick film made of (l,l'-bisphenyl)-4'olato) bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato) aluminum (film made of the below-mentioned BALq) was formed on the light emitting layer. The thus formed BALq film functioned as a hole barrier/electron injecting combined layer. Thereafter, LiF as an alkali metal halide was vapor-deposited on the BALq film to form a 0.2 nnrthick film, and then aluminum was vapor-deposited on the LiF film to form<br><br>
a 150 nnrthick film.   The thus formed Al^LiF film functioned as a cathode. Thus, an organic EL device was produced.<br>
