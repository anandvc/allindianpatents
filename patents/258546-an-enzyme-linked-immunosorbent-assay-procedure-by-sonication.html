				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure by sonication. More particularly, the present invention relates to a simple method for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique on a solid surface by ultrasound waves.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an important tool for clinical diagnostics for detection of antigens or antibodies in the diseased sample of both animals (Alois! et.al, Am.J.Med Technol (1981); An ELISA method for detecting unexpected antibodies; 47; 913-918) and plants. Other applications of ELISA include detection of bio-threat agents (Turner et.al, Biosens Bioelectron (2001); Substitution of antibodies and receptors with molecularly imprinted polymers in enzyme-linked and flurorescent assays; 16; 701-707, Reynolds et.al. J. immunol. Methods (2002); Detection strategies for catalytic antibodies; 269; 125-31, Huels et.al. Drug Discovery Today (2002); The impact of protein biochips and microarrays on the drug development process; S119-S124), biomedica! research and high throughput screening for discovery of drug or drug targets (Kricka et.al. Clin.Chem (1980); Variability in adsorption properties of microltitre plates used as solid supports in enzyme immunoassay; 26; 741-744). Conventional ELISA method takes very long time varying from several hours to 2 days for completion. This is one of the major drawbacks of the ELISA procedure required for many important applications. Rapid ELISA can facilitates proper medication by quick diagnosis, accelerates the pace of research including drug screening leading to drug discovery. Rapid ELISA is also necessary for detecting bio-threat agent. Many attempts have been made to shorten ELISA timing.<br>
Bora et al. J. Immunol.Methods (2002); Covalent immbolization of proteins onto photoactivated polystyrene microtiter plates for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures; 268;171-177 have reported a rapid and simple method for a double-antibody sandwich (DAS) ELISA and a direct antigen coating (DAC) ELISA by covalently immobilizing antigen or antibody onto the activated polystyrene surface, developed by Nahar et.al. Anal. Bioechem (2001); Light-Induced Activation of an Inert Surface for Covalent Immobilization of a Protein Ligand; 294; 148-153.<br>
Detection of antibodies at lower concentrations was also done successfully using such activated surface. The ELISA value obtained in about eight hours by this method was found to be similar<br><br>
with the values obtained in the conventional ELISA method carried out in twenty hours. ELISA timing was further shortened by Bora et.al by carrying out ELISA at an elevated temperature. Thus, Bora et al J. Immunol. Methods. (2004); Heat-mediated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure on a photoactivated surface ;293 ; 43-50., carried out heat-mediated ELISA (HELISA) at temperature ranging from 40-50°C in about 3 hours on an activated polymer surface (US 2004/0191831 A1).<br>
However, dramatic decrease in ELISA timing was reported by Nahar et.al (US 6498016 B1) where microwave-mediated ELISA (MELISA) decreased the ELISA timing to less than 10 minutes. MELISA is based on dielectric polarization of the molecule (s); hence composition of the incubation fluids is of significant importance. Absorption of microwave energy and thus increase in temperature depends on molecules present in the incubation fluids. MELISA depends on microwaves which have two different effects acting simultaneously on the bio molecules. These effects are microwave thermal and microwave specific or microwave non-thermal effect. Microwave specific effect or non-thermal effect is an effect which can activate or deactivate a biomolecule even if temperature is not enhanced (Andre Loupy et al. Pure Appl. Chem (2001), Reactivity and selectivity under microwaves in organic chemistry. Relation with medium effects and reaction mechanisms 73; 161-166, S.C. Sudrik et al. J.Org.Chem (2002)., Microwave Specific Wolff Rearrangement of Diazoketones and Its Relevance to the Nonthermal and Thermal Effect; 67; 1574-1579). MELISA is a sensitive technique where a slight change in microwave frequency, output power or time may give non-specific binding leading to non productive assay. Therefore, there is a need for a rapid ELISA method where slight change in frequency, output power or time will not enhance non-specific binding.<br>
The applicants in the present invention have invented a novel ELISA technique using ultrasound waves. This sound wave- mediated ELISA or Sono-ELISA (SELISA) is not depended on reagents, neither a slight change in parameters like time affects the ELISA value considerably.<br>
Ultrasound waves have found applications in many fields including chemical (W.M. de Azevedo et.al Ultrasonic Sonochemistrv (2006) The effect of ultrasonic waves in conducting polymer solution; 13 (5); 433-437 and V. Calvino et.al Applied Surface Science (2006); Ultrasound accelerated Claisen-Schmidt condensation: A green route to chalcones ; 252 (17); 6071-6074) and biological fields. Ultrasound have been applied for enhancement of the reaction rate of agglutination test (Thomas et.al, Ultrasound in medicine and Biology. (1999): Ultrasonic<br><br>
enhancement of coated particle agglutination immunoassay: Influence of particle density and compressibility; 25 (3) 443-450), for red blood cell agglutination IN VITRO (Doubrovski, Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (2000); Ultrasonic wave action upon the red blood cell agglutination IN VITRO ; 26 (4) 655-659) and latex immuno agglutination assay (Bhaskar et.al, Journal of Immunoloaical Methods (2002) 262 181-186, for plasma preparation from whole blood (Cousins et.al Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (2000); Plasma preparation from whole blood using ultrasound; 881-888), for elution of antigen from dried blood (Takkouche et.al. . Immunology letters (1995); Detection of Brucella antibodies in eluted dried blood: a validation study. Immunology letters; 107-108) and mycobacterium cell (Speer et.al. Clinical and vaccine immunology (2006); A Novel enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium subsp. parartuberculosis infections (Johne's disease) in cattle; 535-540) and arrangement of particles in a gel matrix (Gherardini et.al, (2004) Ultrasound in Med. &amp; Biol. 31 (2) 261-272. They are also used in membrane technology to enhance filtration rate (Masselin et.al, Journal Of Membrane Science (2001V 181. 213-220<br>
In the present application ultrasound waves were used for immobilizing antigen or antibody onto the solid surface followed by carrying out subsequent ELISA steps by controlled sonication. Sonication-mediated ELISA has not been reported in the prior art. The present invention relates to an efficient sonication-mediated ELISA method for detection of antigen, antibody etc. This procedure has reduced the total time required for ELISA ranging from 4 min to 40 minutes from 12 to 20 hours in conventional ELISA.<br>
Novelty of the present invention is that sonication- mediated ELISA (SELISA) procedure is carried out on an activated surface in 4 - 40 min at a temperature ranging from 30°C to 60°C. All the steps of ELISA such as antigen binding, blocking, antibody and enzyme-conjugated antibody binding are carried out by ultrasound energy generated in a sonicator bath. The invented SELISA procedure is rapid with comparable ELISA value than the conventional method. Both the thermal and non-thermal effect of ultrasound energy is utilized in sonication -mediated ELISA.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus the main object of the present invention is to provide a novel sonication mediated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process that shortens the time period of<br>
classical ELISA procedure.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to use an alternate source of energy to carry out<br>
ELISA technique which has the potential for automation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to use sonication energy and an activated surface<br>
for rapid ELISA.<br>

In yet another preferred embodiment of this invention, an apparatus may be made which is capable of generating ultrasound waves for sonication-mediated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (SELISA). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a simple method for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique on a solid surface by ultrasound waves. Any solid surface that is used for conventional ELISA can be used for sonication-mediated ELISA (sono-ELISA or SELISA).<br><br>
Activated surface immobilize antigen or antibody either by adsorption or by covalent binding. In the invented procedure activated surface was made which immobilizes the antigen or antibody through covalent bonding. Untreated surface is also used for SELISA, but gave low ELISA readings.<br>
In the invented procedure, all the experiments involving ultrasound waves were carried out in a sonicator bath operating at a frequency of 40 KHz. During operation 1.8 litre of water was used in the sonicator bath. During each step of the experiment initial bath temperature was 37°C. Temperature was raised during sonication in each step and was not lowered by cooling down. The sonicator bath temperature in which the each step of SELISA was carried out was in the range of 37 °C to 50 °C. Each step of SELISA was optimized by carrying out the subsequent steps by conventional ELISA.<br>
The first step of ELISA was optimized by immobilizing goat anti-human IgG onto the polystyrene microtiter plate by sonication in different time and different ultrasound output power (110 W and 120 W). In both the output power (110 W and 120 W) the maximum immobilization occurred at 10 min although 5 min immobilization also showed reasonably good ELISA readings. At higher output power that is at 120 W slightly better result was observed than 110 W. Untreated surface showed much lower ELISA values than the activated surface (Table 1 A and 1 B).<br>
In the second step of SELISA, blocking was carried out with 2% BSA in different timings by sonication at output power of 110 W and 120 W. In both the cases maximum absorbance was obtained in 10 min beyond which no appreciable increase in ELISA value was observed. (Table 2 A and 2 B).<br>
In the third step of SELISA, human IgG binding to the immobilized anti human IgG was carried out by sonicating it in different time at 110 W and 120 W. Human IgG was found to optimally bind to the solid phase in 15 min at 110 W (Table 3 A) and in 10 min at 120 W (Table 3 B).<br>
Similar results were obtained for fourth step of enzyme-conjugated antibody binding where excellent result was obtained in 15 min at 110 W (Table 4 A) and in 10 min at 120 W (Table 4 B).<br><br>
In all the above experiments (Table 1 -4) ultrasound wave- mediated binding at 120 W showed better result than 110 W although 110 W was also found to give comparable ELISA value. At an output power of 120 W, maximum absorbance was obtained when SELISA was carried out for 10 min in each step (Table 4 B). However, in all the above experiments (Table 1-4) 5 min sonication in each step showed fairly good ELISA value. To find out the minimum time required for SELISA at 120 W we have carried out SELISA in 4, 12, 20, 28 min respectively (for each step 1, 3, 5, 7 min respectively). To compare the results, 40 min- SELISA (10 min for each step) and control (conventional) ELISA were also carried out. Result showed that 10 min -SELISA was comparable to conventional ELISA carried out in 20 h. Gradual decline in ELISA values were observed when SELISA time was decreased from 40 min to 4 min. Nevertheless detectable ELISA values were observed even in less time (Table 5). During SELISA experiments, initial temperature of the sonicator bath was 37°C which was increased to 43°C after 10 min.<br>
To find out whether increase in ELISA value in short time in SELISA experiment is due to thermal effect, ELISA was performed by different methods in 10 min such as (i) ELISA by sonication at 37-43°C, (ii) ELISA by sonication at 37°C, (iii) ELISA by thermal incubation at 37°C, (iv) ELISA by thermal incubation at 50°C (blocking 40°C). Control experiment was carried out by conventional ELISA in 20 h. The absorbance values showed 40 min - SELISA and 20 h-conventional ELISA was very similar. Interestingly 40 min - ELISA at elevated temperature (maximum 50°C) showed much lower ELISA reading than that of SELISA even though temperature of the sonicator bath was much lower (maximum 43°C). It clearly demonstrated that ultrasound waves have non-thermal effect. It was further confirmed when sonication at 37°C gave nearly 3 times more ELISA readings than thermal incubation at 37°C (Table 6). The results clearly show that ultrasound waves exert specific or non-thermal effect which enhances the reaction rate.<br>
Although the mechanism of ultra sound effect is still debatable it is likely that ultrasound waves exert variety of non thermal bioeffects via acoustic caviation. Besides, sonication has also thermal effect. During sonication heat is generated which also play a role in sonication -mediated ELISA. Here, both the effects of sonication such as sonication thermal effect and sonication non-thermal effect have been utilized for sonication -mediated ELISA.<br><br>
Thus, time required in each step in SELISA may vary depending on time, output power, temperature and or frequency of sonication and excellent results can be obtained by minor modification of reaction conditions.<br>
The invented procedure can be adapted to any solid surface of any shape or size. However, polystyrene microtiter plates were used for SELISA as they were widely used for ELISA technique. Any polystyrene microtiter plates available in the market for ELISA purpose can also be used for SELISA technique. These polystyrene plates are activated by different procedures to make them suitable for ELISA. In the present invention we have activated 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates by exposing the FNAB coated wells of the plate to UV radiation or bright sunlight. This activated support was used for sonication - mediated ELISA (SEL1SA) and for control ELISA to detect human IgG.<br>
SELISA experiments were performed in an ELMA (Germany) Sonicator bath, model no. T490 DH, operating at a frequency of 40 kHz at 230 V and has a maximum capacity of about 2.6 litre. During operation 1.8 litre of water was used.<br>
Phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.2, 0.01 M was used as antibody dilution buffer. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.2, 0.01 M together with 0.1% Tween- 20 was used as washing buffer in all the experiments. Blocking solution was made by dissolving 2% BSA in triple distilled water Substrate solution was prepared by adding 2 mg o-phenylenediamine hydrochloride and 2 pi H2O2 in 6 mf of 0,2 M phosphate- citrate buffer, pH 5. Normal rabbit sera were taken as negative control sera (-ve sera).<br>
Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG was purchased from Sigma as lyophilized powder. After reconstitution, the optimum dilution was found to be 1: 2000 as determined by checkerboard titration, which was used in the experiments. In all the ELISA experiments, absorbance values are expressed as mean of three replicates.<br>
ELISA is a 5-step procedure, namely antigen binding, blocking, antibody binding, enzyme-conjugated antibody binding and colour development. Each step of SELISA was optimized by carrying out the subsequent steps by conventional ELISA procedure. Conventional ELISA was carried out by coating the wells with anti-human IgG overnight at 4°C, blocking in 1 h at 37°C<br><br>
followed by antibody and conjugate binding at 37°C for 3 h each. The fifth step which is common for all carried out at room temperature for 5 min and absorbance was recorded in an ELISA reader at 490 nm.<br>
The data obtained for different time and power settings clearly shows that there is a wide range of parameters where SELISA can be carried out successfully. Therefore, several embodiments of the present invention can be optimized to suit the specific need.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Activation of polystyrene microtiter plate<br>
FNAB (1.82 mg / 50 jil of ethanol /well) was poured into the wells of polystyrene microtiter plate. Ethanol was allowed to evaporate in the dark and the wells were irradiated by UV light at 365 nm for 10 min in an UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, USA). The wells were then washed with ethanol and dried. These activated wells were used for immobilization of antigen or antibody in the invented procedure.<br>
Example 2 (A) Immobilization of goat anti-human IgG by ultrasound waves at output power of 110 W (Table 1 A)<br>
Goat anti-human IgG (0.25 ug /100 ^l PBS, pH 7.2, 0.01 M / well) was loaded in triplicate wells of microtiter plates. The plates were then sonicated for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min respectively at an ultrasound output power of 110 W in a sonicator bath. The plates were then washed with washing buffer.
