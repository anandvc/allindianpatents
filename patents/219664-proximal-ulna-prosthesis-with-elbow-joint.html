Field of invention<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of medical technology. Further, this invention relates to a novel custom-built endoprosthesis namely the Proximal Ulna Prosthesis with Elbow Joint. More particularly this invention relates to custom-built endoprosthesis Elbow Joint with Ulna.<br>
Introduction<br>
Management of patients with musculoskeletal neoplasms has always been one of the most challenging areas in oncology. Prior to 1970, almost every patient with a primary malignant tumour of musculoskeletal system would have any surgical treatment. They would not have adjuvant chemotherapy or irradiation and surgical treatment was almost an amputation with a five-year survival rate of 20%. For benign lesions such as Giant Cell Tumours, the treatment was curettage with 40-60% recurrence rate. Patients with painful metastatic lesions were managed palliatively until they were mercifully relived by death.<br>
Prior Art Technique and Practice<br>
The conventional treatment for bone tumours over the years has been amputation, which is surgical removal of the affected part of the body. Amputation led to severe disability and psychological problems. The patient was made to lose not only part of the physical human body, but also a part of the personality of the patient. By the advent of limb salvage, the technique of removing the tumour only and saving the limb of the patient was developed. The aim of limb salvage in bone tumour management is to eradicate the disease, retain the integrity of the skeletal system and preserve the limb with useful functions using metallic prosthesis.<br><br>
The early methods of reconstruction after limb salvage used the patient's own bone from another part of the body, but were associated with severe disability due to the lack of knee motion.<br>
The technique of endoprosthetic replacement revolutionized limb salvage by providing a method of reconstruction that provides stability and mobility. The endoprostheses that is used after excision of bone tumours around the Elbow Joint differs from other joint replacement prosthesis because of the amount of mobility required at the site for good function. The prosthesis is fabricated according to the anatomical dimensions of the patient and is therefore termed as the Custom  Prosthesis.<br>
The custom prosthesis was designed by us to meet the anatomical and functional demands after excision of bone tumours. Different types of Custom Prosthesis have been developed by us to replace bone defects after limb salvage surgery for bone tumours of the elbow, distal radius, distal femur (Thigh bone) shoulder joint (Proximal Humerus) proximal tibia (Leg bone) and sholder joint (Proximal Humerus).<br>
Our Patent No. 198872, which has been awarded, is Proximal Tibial Prosthesis with a Pivotal Hinge Mechanism our Patent No: 198869, is a Proximal Tibial Prosthesis with Trust Bearing Pad Mechanism. Our Patent No. 196333 is Distal Femoral Prosthesis with Thrust bearing Pad and Oscillating Hinge Mechanism and our Patent application No: 898/MAS/2001, which has also been submitted, is a Distal Femoral Prosthesis with Pivotal Hinge Mechanism. Our Patent No: 196333, which has also been awarded, is a Distal Femoral Prosthesis With Thrust Bearing Pad And Rotating Axis Mechanism. Even though all these patent applications are for prostheses around the knee joint, the anatomical part replaced by Patent Nos: 198872 and 198869 covers the region of Knee and the accompanying bone below the knee (Proximal Tibia), whereas the patent application No: 898/MAS/2001, and Patent No: 196333 replaces the knee joint and the adjoining thigh bone (Distal Femur). Our other similar patents that have been awarded are Patent No: 201520 for the Distal Tibial Prosthesis with ankle Joint, and the Patent No. 202044 for Distal Radial Prosthesis with Wrist Joint,<br><br>
This patent application that is being filed is the Proximal Ulnar Prosthesis with Elbow joint which surgically replaces the upper part of the ulna (forearm bone) and does not have an oscillating mechanism, whereas the patent application No 1240/CHE/2004, Distal Humerus and Elbow joint with Oscillating Mechanism, replaces the lower part of the humerus (arm bone) and has an oscillating mechanism. All the other applications except 1240/CHE/2004 are for prosthesis that replace other anatomical regions of the body and not the elbow joint.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
I.	Distal Humeral Stem with Condylar Component (1-10)<br>
The Distal humeral stem with condylar component (a) consists of an intramedullary stem and condylar head. The intramedullary stem is present at the upper end and forms the bone-anchoring component. It is tapered (2 &amp; 3 of fig.3) with a matted finish surface and is provided with longitudinal grooves (1 of fig.3) along its length, for fixing into the cement in the intramedullary canal of the humerus. The lower part of the intramedullary stem (3 of fig.3) ends on the upper flat surface of the condylar region. This surface comes into contact with the distal humeral bone when the prosthesis is assembled and has troughs (10 of fig.3) for integration with the bone cement. The distal humeral component then expands into the condylar component (4-9 of fig 3). The anterior surface of the condylar component has a notch placed centrally and two circular walls ( 7 of fig.3), which project anteriorly and have a central hole (6 of fig 3 &amp; 4), and have a semi circular groove (8 of fig.3), to accommodate the upper end of the ulnar component and ends as the free inferior surface of the condylar component (9 of fig.3), which acts as a stopper when the joint is fully extended up to 0 °.<br>
II.	Proximal Ulnar Component: (11 - 20)<br>
The ulnar component (b) of fig.l, 2,3 and 4 has a shaft, which is oval in shape (11 of fig.l-4). The upper end of the shaft, expands into a circular shape which projects anteriorly, and has a central hole (20 of fig.3, 4).   The anterior curved surface of the<br><br>
upper circular part of the proximal ulnar component has a central counter hole with threads, ( 19 of fig 4), which opens into the central hole (20 of fig 4) in the upper of the ulnar component. The lower part of the ulnar component expands into a collar (12 of fig.3), the lower surface of which forms the circular platform for contact with the cut end of the ulnar bone. This surface has grooves (13 of fig.3) which serve to integrate with the cement at the junction with the cut end of the ulna. From the platform arises the intramedullary stem (14 of fig.3), which anchors, into the cement in the medullary canal of the ulna. This stem is tapered (16 of 3) and has a matted finish surface with three longitudinal grooves (15 of 3) for anchorage within the cement in the medullary canal of the ulna.<br>
ffl.      Collared bushes ( 24 - 28)<br>
The collar bushes (c) are in the shape of a hollow cylinder with a collar at one end. The surface of the cylindrical portion (26 of fig.3) is in contact with the inner surface of the holes (6 of fig.l) in the two anterior projecting circular walls of the condylar component (7 of fig.3) and the inner surfaces of the cylinder bore of the collar bush (27 of fig.3) come into contact with the outer surface (29 of fig.3) of the pivot pin. The outer surface of the collar (24 of fig.3) is in content with the inner surfaces of the anterior circular walls of the condylar component and the inner surface of the anterior circular walls of the condylar component and the inner surface of the collar (25 of fig.3) comes into contact with the outer surfaces of the upper circular portion (18 of fig.3) of the ulnar component (b of fig.3). The free edge of the collar (20 of fig.3) is visible between the anterior circular extensions walls of the condylar component (a of fig. 1) and the upper circular portion (18 of fig.3) of the proximal ulnar component (b of fig.3).<br>
IV.      Pivot Pin (29 - 31)<br>
The pivot pin (d of fig. 1-4) has a smooth cylindrical shaft (31 of 3). The anterior aspect of the middle of the pivot pin has a hole (29 of fig.3) for the distal end of the pivot pin fixing screw (e of fig 3) to engage. The two ends of the pivot pin have a longitudinal<br><br>
slot (30 of fig 3) to indicate the central counter hole (19 of fig 4). The two ends of the pivot pin seat in the bore of the collar bush, which seated in the walls of the part (a) of the condylar component (7 of fig.3) and the central part goes through the ulnar component and is locked by the locking screw. This enables the unit to function as a single assembly permitting free movement.<br>
V.        Pivot Pin Fixing Screw (32 - 35)<br>
The pivot pin fixing screw (e of fig.3) has a head (33 of fig.3) with a slot (35 of fig.3). The under portion of the head (34 of fig.3) is flat, from which the threaded part of the screw (32 of fig.3) arises. The thread position of screw fits into the threaded narrower portion of the hole (19 of fig.3) in the proximal ulnar component. When the screw is fully tightened, the head of the screw lies flush with the counter bore of the groove, threaded part the screw engages with the threads in the lower narrower portion of the groove and the tip of the screw engages through in the middle of the anterior aspect of the pivot pin (29 of fig.3). The either ends of the pivot pin are provided with a slot (35 of fig.3) to align the through in the pivot pin with the counter hole. The pivot pin fixing screw can pass through the hole thereby locking the pivot pin with the proximal ulnar component. Thus the condylar component, collared bushes, proximal ulnar component with pivot pin in to a full assembly.<br>
The elbow joint mechanism is formed by the distal humeral component (I of Fig 3), ulnar component (b) of 1-5, collar bushes (c) of fig. 1-5 Pivot pin (e of 1-5) and pivot pin-fixing screw.<br>
The collar bushes fit into the holes (6 of fig.3) in the distal humeral component and the semicircular grooves accommodate the collars of the bushes ( 28 of fig 3). The upper circular portion of the proximal ulnar component ( 20 of fig 3 &amp; 4) seats between the inner surface of the two collared bushes( 25 of fig 3). The pivot pin posses through the groove in the collar bush of side (27 of fig..3) and then through the hole in the upper circular portion of the proximal ulnar component (20 of 3,4) and then through the hole in the collar bush of the opposite side. The pivot pin is held in place by the pivot pin fixing<br><br>
screw (e of fig.3), which passes in to the groove in the anterior part of the proximal ulnar component (19 of fig.3) and engages in the trough in the anterior aspect of pivot pin. All the components are therefore integrated into a single assembly unit held together by the pivot pin, forming the elbow joint. The elbow joint permits a movement of 0-170°. When the joint is fully extended, the upper part of the posterior aspect of the ulnar component comes into contact the free inferior portion of the distal humeral component (19 of fig 3). The flexion of the elbow beyond 170° is limited by contact between the anterior surface of the arm and the forearm.<br><br><br><br>
