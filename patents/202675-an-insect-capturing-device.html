AN INSECT CAPTURING DEVICE<br><br>
The invention relates to an insect capturing device for capturing insects so that they may be removed from a building and released alive outdoors.<br>
Many people regard the presence of insects such as spiders inside a building as a nuisance. However, many such people do not wish to kill the insect and would prefer to have a convenient and simple way of disposing of the insect without  killing it.<br>
This problem has existed for many years and several attempts have been made at providing an insect capturing device to do the task. One type of such device is based on the principle of using suction to pull insects into a chamber. For example, in   US Patent   Specification No. 3965608 (Schuman) a hand-held suction device is described.   A manually-operated piston pump creates a suction and a trigger-actuated shutter valve controls suction at a nozzle. Check valves may be included for strengthening a stored vacuum.<br>
United States Patent Specification No. 4631858 (Kahle) describes a device which operates on a similar principle. The open end of a tube is held near an insect, and a piston is released to cause a vacuum so that the insect is drawn into the chamber.<br>
United States Patent Specification No. 4817330 (Fahringer) also describes a device which operates   on   this principle. This device includes a bellows which creates a vacuum when it is squeezed. A conduit connects the bellows with a trap chamber and a screen is mounted in the conduit.<br>
United States Patent Specification No. 5537777 (Geeting) describes a device having a handle   with   a   compression   chamber at one end. A soft head is attached at the end of a<br><br>
-2-shaft. The   soft   head   is   drawn   into a compression chamber so that it wraps around the<br>
insect as the head is being compressed.<br>
The   devices   which   operate   on   this principle appear to be quite complex and therefore would be expensive and not amenable to widespread use. Another very important aspect is that   the   device appears to exert considerable force on an insect and parts of the devices such as screens in trap chambers would appear to at least injure the insect, if not kill it.<br>
Another approach   is   based on the principle of controlling a trap door so that an insect is trapped within a chamber. For example, in United States Patent Specification No. 4324062 (Schneider) a tubular housing has a movable trap door at either end. One end is shaped for use in comers, and the other end is flat for use against walls etc   In United States Patent Specification No. US5207018 (Reaver) a   device is described which comprises a flexible handle having a transparent rigid housing. The housing has a large aperture through which an    insect    is   placed. A pair   of   parallel channels extend along opposite sides of the compartment aperture and they are arranged to support a front end of a mesh closure member.<br>
These   devices   would   appear    to provide a lesser chance of injuring or killing the insect. However, it appears the they are difficult to operate and are more complex.   There is therefore a need for an insect capturing device which is simpler to operate so that an insect is captured in a convenient manner and is not injured or killed.   There is also a need for such a device which is of simpler and inexpensive construction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an insect capturing device comprising a user handle, an insect capturing head having a plurality of bristles ,and an actuator for causing the bristles to move to surround and capture an insect.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Thus, the invention provides for insect capturing in a simple and convenient manner, using components (namely bnstles) which have been available for many years. Preferably, the actuators are adapted for causing the bristles to converge.<br>
!n one embodiment, the bristles are arranged in a ring. Preferably, the head comprises a plurality of tufts of bristles arranged in a ring.<br>
In one embodiment, the bristles are arranged in two or more concentric rings. Preferably, the bristles of an outer ring are longer than those of an inner ring.<br>
In one embodiment, the rings each comprise a plurality of tufts of bristles, and the tufts of adjacent rings are mounted in a mutually offset configuration.<br>
In  another   embodiment, the actuator comprises a diaphragm supporting the bristles, the diaphragm being movable between a convex position at which the bristles diverge and a concave position at which the bristles converge. This is a very simple and effective way of moving bristles to entrap an insect without killing it.<br>
Preferably, a rod is connected at one end to the diaphragm and at the other end to a trigger mechanism at the handle, for moving the diaphragm.<br>
In one embodiment, the trigger mechanism comprises a front fixed handle part (10) and a rear trigger connected to the rod<br><br>
-4-<br>
Preferably, the actuator further comprises a spring mounted to bias the bristles to a converged state.<br>
In one embodiment, the handle is connected to the head by an elongate rod. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of some embodiments thereof, given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-<br>
Fig. I is a side view of an insect capturing device of the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a more detailed perspective view showing part of a head of the device;<br>
Fig. 3 is a front view of a diaphragm of the device;<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view in the direction of the arrows IV-IV of Fig. 3;<br>
Fig 5 is a diagrammatic side view showing a handle of the device;<br>
Fig. 6 is a diagrammatic side view showing an alternative construction of handle;<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 are diagrammatic cross-sectional side views showing the head of the device in different positions;<br>
Figs. 9(a) to 9(d) are a sequence of diagrams showing the manner in which an insect is captured; and<br><br>
-5-Fig. 10 is a perspective view showing the head of the device with a captured insect.<br>
Referring to the drawings, and initially to Figs. 1 to 5 there is shown an insect capturing device 1 of the invention. The device 1 comprises a handle 2 connected to an elongate rod 3, the other end of which is connected to a head 4 The head 4 comprises tufts of bristles 5 extending from a diaphragm 6.<br>
As   shown   in Figs. 2 and 3, the bristles 5 are arranged in two concentric rings in which the tufts are offset. Also, it  will   be   apparent from Fig. 2 that the bristles of the outer ring are longer by approximately 8 mm than those of the inner ring. The length of the bristles in the inner ring is 92mm and the length of those in the outer ring is 100mm.<br>
Referring particularly to Fig. 5, the handle 2 comprises a fixed handle part 10 which is pivotally connected to a trigger 11 by a pivot joint 12. The fixed handle part 10 comprises a leaf spring 13 against which the trigger 11 presses in an action indicated by the arrow A and the interrupted tines of Fig. 5.  The trigger 11 presses against a rod 14 within the tube 3 against the action of the spring 13.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, an alternative construction of head, indicated generally by the numeral 20 is illustrated. In this embodiment, a fixed handle part 21 is connected to a trigger 22 at a pivot joint 23. The trigger 22 is biased rearwardly by coil spring 24 around a rod 25. In the embodiments of both Figs. 5 and 6 the rod is urged rearwardly by the action of the relevant spring 13 or 24.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 7 and 8, the manner in which movement of the bristles 5 is controlled is   now  described.   Figs. 7 and 8 also illustrate the head 4 in more detail. It comprises a<br><br>
-6-<br>
domed casing 30 and a sealing ring 31 of plastics material which supports the diaphragm 6. The rod 14 is connected to the diaphragm 6 by a fastener 32,  The diaphragm 6 is flexible and its default position is shown in Fig. 7   This default position is caused by the action of the spring 13 which   urges   the   trigger   11 and the rod 14 to a rear extremity shown by interrupted lines in Fig, 5.  At this position, the diaphragm 6 is concave and the bristles 5 converge. The diaphragm 6 may be moved to a convex position when the user pushes the trigger 11 forwardly against the action of the spring 13,<br>
In operation, referring to Figs. 9 and 10, the user holds the device 1 (Fig. 1) at the handle 2 (Fig. 1) and presses the trigger 11 (Fig. 5) forwardly against the action of the spring 13 (Fig. 5). This causes the bristles 5 to diverge, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9 (a). The head 4 is then moved so that the bristles 5 surround the insect (in this illustration a spider S) as shown in Fig. 9(b).<br>
As shown in Fig. 9(c), the user then gradually releases pressure at the handle so that the spring 13 (Fig. 5) causes the rod 14 (Fig. 5) to move and therefore causes the diaphragm 6 to move towards the concave position This causes the bristles 5 to converge Because the bristles 5 press against the surface at which the spider S is located, the inner bristles are free to converge firstly, the outer bristles being held against the surface. Therefore, the inner bristles surround and grip the insect in a manner whereby the insect is trapped but is not injured. The inner bristles tend to lift the spider S to some extent. Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 9(d), the outer bristles 5 converge to surround the spider S to provide a more comprehensive entrapment both around and below the spider S. The final position is shown most clearly in Fig. 10, ft has been found that this action does not injure the insect. The bristles are strong enough to grip the insect but are resilient enough not to injure it.<br><br>
-7-<br>
The user then carries the device 1 outdoors and again presses the trigger 11 (Fig. 5). This causes the bristles 5 to diverge and thus release the insect harmlessly.<br>
It   will   be appreciated that the invention provides an insect capturing device which is much simpler   than   has   heretofore   been   the    case.     Importantly, the device uses simple components which have been available for many years.   Therefore it may be produced using conventional production technologies.<br>
Also, the device is much less likely to injure or kill an insect than the prior art devices. A still further advantage is that the device is much easier to operate. Only simple positioning and triggering actions are required. Another advantage is that the device may be easily used in a variety of locations such as in tight corners or on open surfaces.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described, but may be varied in construction and detail within the scope of the claims. For example, different bristle configurations may be used which provide entrapment of the insect. Also, it is not essential that the bristles converge to capture an insect. For example, the bristles may move laterally on arcuate supports which move in a radial direction. However, the converging action is particularly effective.<br><br>
