PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to combinations of pyrazole compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase (GSK, e.g. GSK-3) with a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor, and to the therapeutic uses of such combinations.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) and subgroups thereof and the compound 4-(2,&amp;-dichk&gt;ro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamkJe and the hydrochloric acid addition salt thereof are disclosed in our earlier International patent application number PCT/GB2004003179 (Publication No. WO 2005/012256) as being inhibitors of Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK kinases) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3).<br>
The methanesulphonic acid and acetic acid addition salts of compound 4-(2f6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1 H-pyrazc4e-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide and crystals thereof and method of making them are disclosed in our earlier applications USSN 607645,973 and GB 0501475.8.<br>
Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes within the cell (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book. I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, CA). The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (e.g., Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T., FASEBJ., 9:576-596 (1995); Knighton, etal.t Science, 253:407-414 (1991); Hiles, et a/., Cell, 70:419-429 (1992); Kunz, et a/., Cell, 73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos, et a/., EMBOJ., 13:2352-2361 (1994)).<br>
Protein kinases may be characterized by their regulation mechanisms. These mechanisms include, for example, autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation by other kinases, protein-protein interactions, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-polynucleotide interactions. An individual protein kinase may be regulated by more than one mechanism.<br>
Kinases regulate many different cell processes including, but not limited to, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, transcription, translation and other signalling processes, by adding phosphate groups to target proteins. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. Phosphorylation of target proteins occurs in response to a variety of extracellular signals (hormones, neurotransmitters, growth and differentiation factors, etc.), cell cycle events, environmental or nutritional stresses, etc. The appropriate protein kinase functions in signalling pathways to activate or inactivate (either directly or indirectly), for example, a metabolic enzyme, regulatory protein, receptor, cytoskeletal protein, ion channel or pump, or transcription factor. Uncontrolled signalling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including, for example, inflammation, cancer, allergy/asthma, disease and conditions of the immune system, disease and conditions of the central nervous system, and angiogenesis.<br>
Cyclin Dependent Kinases<br>
 <br>
The process of eukaryotic cell division may be broadly divided into a series of sequential phases termed G1, S, G2 and M. Correct progression through the various phases of the cell cyde has been shown to be critically dependent upon the spatial and temporal regulation of a family of proteins known as cydin dependent kinases (cdks) and a diverse set of their cognate protein partners termed cydins. Cdks are cdc2 (also known as cdkl) homologous serine-threonine kinase proteins that are able to utilise ATP as a substrate in the phosphorylation of diverse polypeptides in a sequence dependent context. Cydins are a family of proteins characterised by a homology region, containing approximately 100 amino adds, termed the "cydin box" which is used in binding to, and defining selectivity for, specific cdk partner proteins.<br>
Modulation of the expression levels, degradation rates, and activation levels of various cdks and cydins throughout the cell cycle leads to the cydical formation of a series of cdk/cydin complexes, in which the cdks are enzymatically active. The formation of these complexes controls passage through discrete cell cycle checkpoints and thereby enables the process of cell division to continue. Failure to satisfy the pre-requisite biochemical criteria at a given cell cyde checkpoint, i.e. failure to form a required cdk/cydin complex, can lead to cell cyde arrest and/or cellular apoptosis. Aberrant cellular proliferation, as manifested in cancer, can often be attributed to loss of correct cell cyde control. Inhibition of cdk enzymatic activity therefore provides a means by which abnormally dividing cells can have their division arrested and/or be killed. The diversity of cdks, and cdk complexes, and their critical roles in mediating the cell cyde, provides a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic targets selected on the basis of a defined biochemical rationale.<br>
Progression from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cyde is primarily regulated by cdk2, cdk3, cdk4 and cdk6 via association with members of the D and E type cydins. The D-type cydins appear instrumental in enabling passage beyond the G1 restriction point, where as the cdk2/cydin E complex is key to the transition from the G1 to S phase. Subsequent progression through S phase and entry into G2 is thought to require the cdk2/cydin A complex Both mitosis, and the G2 to M phase transition which triggers it, are regulated by complexes of cdkl and the A and B type cydins.<br>
During G1 phase Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and related pocket proteins such as p130, are substrates for cdk(2,4, &amp; 6)/cydin complexes.   Progression through G1 is in part facilitated by hyperphosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of Rb and p130 by the cdk(4/6)/cydin-D complexes. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb and p130 causes the release of transcription factors, such as E2F, and thus the expression of genes necessary for progression through G1 and for entry into S-phase, such as the gene for cydin E. Expression of cydin E fadlitates formation of the cdk2/cydin E complex which amplifies, or maintains, E2F levels via further phosphorylation of Rb.   The cdk2/cyclin E complex also phosphorylates other proteins necessary for DNA replication, such as NPAT, which has been implicated in histone biosynthesis. G1 progression and the G1/S transition are also regulated via the mitogen stimulated Myc pathway, which feeds into the cdk2/cyclin E pathway. Cdk2 is also connected to the p53 mediated DNA damage response pathway via p53 regulation of p21 levels. p21 is a protein inhibitor of cdk2/cyclin E and is thus capable of blocking, or delaying, the G1/S transition. The cdk2/cydin E complex may thus represent a point at which biochemical stimuli from the Rb, Myc and p53 pathways are to some degree integrated. Cdk2 and/or the cdk2/cydin E complex therefore represent good targets for therapeutics designed at arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cyde in aberrantly dividing cells.<br>
 <br>
The exact role of cdk3 in the cell cycle is not clear. As yet no cognate cyclin partner has been identified, but a dominant negative form of cdk3 delayed cells in G1, thereby suggesting that cdk3 has a role in regulating the G1/S transition.<br>
Although most cdks have been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle there is evidence that certain members of the cdk family are involved in other biochemical processes. This is exemplified by cdk5 which is necessary for correct neuronal development and which has also been implicated in the phosphorylation of several neuronal proteins such as Tau, NUDE-1, synapsinl, DARPP32 and the Munc18/Syntaxin1A complex. Neuronal cdk5 is conventionally activated by binding to the p35/p39 proteins. Cdk5 activity can, however, be deregulated by the binding of p25, a truncated version of p35. Conversion of p35 to p25, and subsequent deregulation of cdk5 activity, can be induced by ischemia, excrtotoxicity,, and p-amyloki peptide. Consequently p25 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, and is therefore of interest as a target for therapeutics directed against these diseases.<br>
Cdk7 is a nuclear protein that has cdc2 CAK activity and binds to cyclin H. Cdk7 has been identified as component of the TFIIH transcriptional complex which has RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) activity. This has been associated with the regulation of HIV-1 transcription via a Tat-mediated biochemical pathway. Cdk8 binds cyclin C and has been implicated in the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Similarly the cdk9/cyclin-T1 complex (P-TEFb complex) has been implicated in elongation control of RNA polymerase II. PTEF-b is also required for activation of transcription of the HIV-1 genome by the viral transactivator Tat through its interaction with cyclin T1. Cdk7, cdk8, cdk9 and the P-TEFb complex are therefore potential targets for anti-viral therapeutics.<br>
At a molecular level mediation of cdk/cyclin complex activity requires a series of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation, or dephosphorylation, events.   Cdk phosphorylation is performed by a group of cdk activating kinases (CAKs) and/or kinases such as weel, Myt1 and Mik1. Dephosphorylation is performed by phosphatases such as cdc25(a &amp; c), pp2a, or KAP.<br>
Cdk/cyclin complex activity may be further regulated by two families of endogenous cellular proteinaceous inhibitors: the Kip/Cip family, or the INK family. The INK proteins specifically bind cdk4 and cdk6. p16ink4(also known as MTS1) is a potential tumour suppressor gene that is mutated, or deleted, in a large number of primary cancers. The Kip/Cip family contains proteins such as p21Ci p16ink4 and p16ink4. As discussed previously p21 is induced by p53 and is able to inactivate the cdk2/cyclin(E/A) and cdk4/cyclin(D1/D2/D3) complexes.   Atypically low levels of p27 expression have been observed in breast, colon and prostate cancers. Conversely over expression of cyclin E in solid tumours has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Over expression of cyclin D1 has been associated with oesophageal, breast, squamous, and non-small cell lung carcinomas.<br>
The pivotal roles of cdks, and their associated proteins, in co-ordinating and driving the cell cycle in proliferating cells have been outlined above. Some of the biochemical pathways in which cdks play a key role have also been described. The development of monotherapies for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, using therapeutics targeted generically at cdks, or at specific cdks, is therefore potentially highly desirable. Cdk inhibitors could conceivably also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, amongst others. Cdk targeted therapeutics may also<br>
 <br>
provide clinical benefits in the treatment of the previously described diseases when used in combination therapy with either existing, or new, therapeutic agents. Cdk targeted anticancer therapies could potentially have advantages over many current antitumour agents as they would not directly interact with DNA and should therefore reduce the risk of secondary tumour development<br>
Glycogen Synthase Kinase<br>
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) is a serine-threonine kinase that occurs as two ubiquitously expressed isoforms in humans (GSK3a &amp; beta GSK3p). GSK3 has been implicated as having roles in embryonic development, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, microtubule dynamics, cell motility and cellular apoptosis. As such GSK3 has been implicated in the progression of disease states such as diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, motor neuron disease and/or head trauma. Phylogenetically GSK3 is most closely related to the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs).<br>
The consensus peptide substrate sequence recognised by GSK3 is (Ser/Thr)-X-X-X-(pSer/pThr), where X is any amino acid (at positions (n+1), (n+2), (n+3)) and pSer and pThr are phospho-serine and phospho-threonine respectively (n+4). GSK3 phosphorylates the first serine, or threonine, at position (n). Phospho-serine, or phospho-threonine, at the (n+4) position appears necessary for priming GSK3 to give maximal substrate turnover. Phosphorylation of GSK3a at Ser21, or GSK3p at Ser9, leads to inhibition of GSK3. Mutagenesis and peptide competition studies have led to the model that the phosphorylated N-terminus of GSK3 is able to compete with phospho-peptide substrate (S/TXXXpS/pT) via an autoinhibitory mechanism. There are also data suggesting that GSK3a and GSKp may be subtly regulated by phosphorylation of tyrosines 279 and 216 respectively. Mutation of these residues to a Phe caused a reduction in in vivo kinase activity. The X-ray crystallographic structure of GSK3p has helped to shed light on all aspects of GSK3 activation and regulation.<br>
GSK3 forms part of the mammalian insulin response pathway and is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inactivate, glycogen synthase. Upregulation of glycogen synthase activity, and thereby glycogen synthesis, through inhibition of GSK3, has thus been considered a potential means of combating type II, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): a condition in which body tissues become resistant to insulin stimulation. The cellular insulin response in liver, adipose, or muscle tissues is triggered by insulin binding to an extracellular insulin receptor. This causes the phosphorylation, and subsequent recruitment to the plasma membrane, of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Further phosphorylation of the IRS proteins initiates recruitment of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane where it is able to liberate the second messenger phosphatidylinosityl 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). This facilitates co-localisation of 3-phosphoinositide-dedependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) to the membrane, where PDK1 activates PKB. PKB is able to phosphorylate, and thereby inhibit, GSK3a and/or GSKp through phosphorylation of Ser9, or ser21, respectively. The inhibition of GSK3 then triggers upregulation of glycogen synthase activity. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit GSK3 may thus be able to induce cellular responses akin to those seen on insulin stimulation.   A further in vivo substrate of GSK3 is the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2B (elF2B). elF2B is inactivated via phosphorylation and is thus able to suppress protein biosynthesis. Inhibition of GSK3, e.g. by inactivation of the "mammalian target of rapamydn" protein (mTOR), can thus upregulate protein biosynthesis. Finally there is some evidence for regulation of GSK3 activity via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through phosphorylation of GSK3 by kinases such as<br>
 <br>
mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 1 (MAPKAP-K1 or RSK). These data suggest that GSK3 activity may be modulated by mitogenic, insulin and/or amino acid stimulii.<br>
It has also been shown that GSK3|J is a key component in the vertebrate Wnt signalling pathway. This biochemical pathway has been shown to be critical for normal embryonic development and regulates cell proliferation in normal tissues. GSK3 becomes inhibited in response to Wnt stimulii. This can lead to the de-phosphorylation of GSK3 substrates such as Axin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product and p-catenin. Aberrant regulation of the Wnt pathway has been associated with many cancers. Mutations in APC, and/or p-catenin, are common in colorectal cancer and other tumours, p-catenin has also been shown to be of importance in cell adhesion. Thus GSK3 may also modulate cellular adhesion processes to some degree. Apart from the biochemical pathways already described there are also data implicating GSK3 in the regulation of cell division via phosphorylation of cyclin-Dt, in the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein a (C/EBPa), c-Myc and/or other substrates such as Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFATc), Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1) and the c-AMP response element binding protein (CREB). GSK3 also appears to play a role, albeit tissue specific, in regulating cellular apoptosis. The role of GSK3 in modulating cellular apoptosis, via a pro-apoptotic mechanism, may be of particular relevance to medical conditions in which neuronal apoptosis can occur. Examples of these are head trauma, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and motor neuron diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. In vitro it has been shown that GSK3 is able to hyper-phosphorylate the microtubule associated protein Tau. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau disrupts its normal binding to microtubules and may also lead to the formation of intra-cellular Tau filaments. It is believed that the progressive accumulation of these filaments leads to eventual neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Inhibition of Tau phosphorylation, through inhibition of GSK3, may thus provide a means of limiting and/or preventing neurodegenerative effects.<br>
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL)<br>
Cell cycle progression is regulated by the combined action of cydins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK-inhibitors (CDKi), which are negative cell cycle regulators. p27KIP1 is a CDKi key in cell cycle regulation, whose degradation is required for G1/S transition. In spite of the absence of p27KIP1 expression in proliferating lymphocytes, some aggressive B-cell lymphomas have been reported to show an anomalous p27KIP1 staining. An abnormally high expression of p27KIP1 was found in lymphomas of this type. Analysis of the clinical relevance of these findings showed that a high level of p27KIP1 expression in this type of tumour is an adverse prognostic marker, in both univariate and multivariate analysis. These results show that there is abnormal p27KIP1 expression in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas (DLBCL), with adverse cfinical significance, suggesting that this anomalous p27KIP1 protein may be rendered non-functional through interaction with other cell cycle regulator proteins. (Br. J. Cancer. 1999 Jul;80(9): 1427-34. p27KIP1 is abnormally expressed in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphomas and is associated with an adverse clinical outcome. Saez A, Sanchez E, Sanchez-Beato M, Cruz MA, Chacon I, Munoz E, Camacho Fl, Martinez-Montero JC, Mollejo M, Garcia JF, Piris MA. Department of Pathology, Virgen de la Salud Hospital, Toledo, Spain.)<br>
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia<br>
B-Cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia in the Western hemisphere, with approximately 10,000 new cases diagnosed each year (Parker SL, Tong T, Bolden S, Wingo PA: Cancer<br>
 <br>
statistics, 1997. Ca. Cancer. J. Clin. 47:5, (1997)). Relative to other forms of leukaemia, the overall prognosis of CLL is good, with even the most advanced stage patients having a median survival of 3 years.<br>
The addition of fludarabine as initial therapy for symptomatic CLL patients has led to a higher rate of complete responses (27% v 3%) and duration of progression-free survival (33 v 17 months) as compared with previously used alkylator-based therapies. Although attaining a complete clinical response after therapy is the initial step toward improving survival in CLL, the majority of patients either do not attain complete remission or fail to respond to fludarabine. Furthermore, all patients with CLL treated with fludarabine eventually relapse, making its role as a single agent purely palliative (Rai KR, Peterson B, Elias L, Shepherd L, Hines J, Nelson D, Cheson B, Kolitz J, Schrffer CA; A randomized comparison of fludarabine and chlorambucil for patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A CALGB SWOG, CTG/NCJ-C and ECOG Inter-Group Study. Blood 88:141a, 1996 (abstr 552, suppl 1). Therefore, identifying new agents with novel mechanisms of action that complement fludarabine's cytotoxicity and abrogate the resistance induced by intrinsic CLL drug-resistance factors will be necessary if further advances in the therapy of this disease are to be realized.<br>
The most extensively studied, uniformly predictive factor for poor response to therapy and inferior survival in CLL patients is aberrant p53 function, as characterized by point mutations or chromosome 17p13 deletions. Indeed, virtually no responses to either alkylator or purine analog therapy have been documented in multiple single institution case series for those CLL patients with abnormal p53 function. Introduction of a therapeutic agent that has the ability to overcome the drug resistance associated with p53 mutation in CLL would potentially be a major advance for the treatment of the disease.<br>
Flavopiridol and CYC 202, inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases induce in vitro apoptosis of malignant cells from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).<br>
Flavopiridol exposure results in the stimulation of caspase 3 activity and in caspase-dependent cleavage of p27(kip1), a negative regulator of the cell cycle, which is overexpressed in B-CLL (Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3804-16 Flavopiridol induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via activation of caspase-3 without evidence of bcl-2 modulation or dependence on functional p53. Byrd JC, Shinn C, Waselenko JK, Fuchs EJ, Lehman TA, Nguyen PL, Flinn IW, Diehl LF, Sausville E, Grever MR).<br>
Cytotoxic compounds and signalling inhibitors<br>
A wide variety of cytotoxic compounds and signalling inhibitors find application in the combinations of the invention, as described in detail below.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide therapeutic combinations of pyrazole compounds that inhibit or modulate (in particular inhibit) the activity of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase (e.g. GSK-3) with a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor. Such combinations may have an advantageous efficacious effect against tumour cell growth, in comparison with the respective effects shown by the individual components of the combination.<br>

General Preferences and Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "modulation", as applied to the activity of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK, e.g. GSK-3), is intended to define a change in the level of biological activity of the kinase(s). Thus, modulation encompasses physiological changes which effect an increase or decrease in the relevant kinase activity. In the latter case, the modulation may be described as "inhibition". The modulation may arise directly or indirectly, and may be mediated by any mechanism and at any physiological level, including for example at the level of gene expression (including for example transcription, translation and/or post-translational modification), at the level of expression of genes encoding regulatory elements which act directly or indirectly on the levels of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity, or at the level of enzyme (e.g. cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)) activity (for example by allosteric mechanisms, competitive inhibition, active-site inactivation, perturbation of feedback inhibitory pathways etc.). Thus, modulation may imply elevated/suppressed expression or over- or under-expression of the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and/or increased or decreased expression by a transcriptional effect, as well as hyper- (or hypo-)activrty and (de)activation of the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (including (de)activation) by mutation(s). The terms "modulated" and "modulate" are to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
As used herein, the term "mediated", as used e.g. in conjunction with the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as described herein (and applied for example to various physiological processes, diseases, states, conditions, therapies, treatments or interventions) is intended to operate limitatively so that the various processes, diseases, states, conditions, treatments and interventions to which the term is applied are those in which cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) plays a biological role. In cases where the term is applied to a disease, state or condition, the biological role played by cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease, state or condition (or its aetiology or progression). Thus, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity (and in particular aberrant levels of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)activity, e.g. cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and/or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) over-expression) need not necessarily be the proximal cause of the disease, state or condition: rather, it is contemplated that the CDK- and/or GSK- (e.g. GSK-3-) mediated diseases, states or conditions include those having multifactorial aetiologies and complex progressions in which CDK and/or GSK-<br>
 <br>
3 is only partially involved. In cases where the term is applied to treatment, prophylaxis or intervention (e.g. in the "CDK-mediated treatments" and "GSK-3-mediated prophylaxis" of the invention), the role played by CDK and/or GSK-3 may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the operation of the treatment, prophylaxis or outcome of the intervention.<br>
The term "intervention" is a term of art used herein to define any agency which effects a physiological change at any level. Thus, the intervention may comprises the induction or repression of any physiological process, event, biochemical pathway or cellular/biochemical event. The interventions of the invention typically effect (or contribute to) the therapy, treatment or prophylaxis of a disease or condition.<br>
The combinations of the invention are combinations of a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor and a compound of the formulae (0). (1Â°), (I), (la), (lb). (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof that produce a therapeutically efficacious effect.<br>
The term 'efficacious1 includes advantageous effects such as additrvity, synergism, reduced side effects, reduced toxicity, increased time to disease progression, increased time of survival, sensitization or resensrtization of one agent to another, or improved response rate. Advantageously, an efficacious effect may allow for lower doses of each or either component to be administered to a patient, thereby decreasing the toxicity of chemotherapy, whilst producing and/or maintaining the same therapeutic effect.<br>
A "synergistic" effect in the present context refers to a therapeutic effect produced by the combination which is larger than the sum of the therapeutic effects of the components of the combination when presented individually.<br>
An "additive" effect in the present context refers to a therapeutic effect produced by the combination which is larger than the therapeutic effect of any of the components of the combination when presented individually.<br>
The temn "response rate* as used herein refers, in the case of a solid tumour, to the extent of reduction in the size of the tumour at a given time point, for example 12 weeks. Thus, for example, a 50% response rate means a reduction in tumour size of 50%. References herein to a "clinical response" refer to response rates of 50% or greater. A "partial response" is defined herein as being a response rate of less than 50%.<br>
As used herein, the temn "combination", as applied to two or more compounds, may define material in which the two or more compounds are associated. The terms "combined" and "combining" in this context are to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
The association of the two or more compounds in a combination may be physical or non-physical. Examples of physically associated combined compounds include:<br>
â¢	compositions (e.g. unitary formulations) comprising the two or more compounds in admixture (for example within the same unit dose);<br>
â¢	compositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds are chemically/physicochemically linked (for example by crosslinking, molecular agglomeration or binding to a common vehicle moiety);<br>
 <br>
â¢	compositions comprising material in which the two or more compounds are chemically/physicochemicaily co-packaged (for example, disposed on or within lipid vesicles, particles (e.g. micro- or nanoparticies) or emulsion droplets);<br>
â¢	pharmaceutical kits, pharmaceutical packs or patient packs in which the two or more compounds are co-packaged or co-presented (e.g. as part of an array of unit doses);<br>
Examples of non-physically associated combined compounds include:<br>
â¢	material (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds together with instructions for the extemporaneous association of the at least one compound to form a physical association of the two or more compounds;<br>
â¢	material (e.g. a non-unitary formulation) comprising at least one of the two or more compounds together with instructions for combination therapy with the two or more compounds;<br>
â¢	material comprising at least one of the two or more compounds together with instructions for administration to a patient population in which the others) of the two or more compounds have been (or are being) administered;<br>
â¢	material comprising at least one of the two or more compounds in an amount or in a form which is specifically adapted for use in combination with the others) of the two or more compounds.<br>
As used herein, the term "combination therapy" is intended to define therapies which comprise the use of a combination of two or more compounds (as defined above). Thus, references to "combination therapy", "combinations* and the use of compounds "in combination" in this application may refer to compounds that are administered as part of the same overall treatment regimen. As such, the posology of each of the two or more compounds may differ each may be administered at the same time or at different times. It will therefore be appreciated that the compounds of the combination may be administered sequentially (e.g. before or after) or simultaneously, either in the same pharmaceutical formulation (i.e. together), or in different pharmaceutical formulations (i.e. separately). Simultaneously in the same formulation is as a unitary formulation whereas simultaneously in different pharmaceutical formulations is non-unitary. The posologies of each of the two or more compounds in a combination therapy may also differ with respect to the route of administration.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical kit" defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition together with dosing means (e.g. measuring device) and/or delivery means (e.g. inhaler or syringe), optionally all contained within common outer packaging. In pharmaceutical kits comprising a combination of two or more compounds, the individual compounds may unitary or non-unitary formulations. The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack. The pharmaceutical kit may optionally further comprise instructions for use.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical pack" defines an array of one or more unit doses of a pharmaceutical composition, optionally contained within common outer packaging. In pharmaceutical packs comprising a combination of two or more compounds, the individual compounds may unitary or non-unitary formulations. The unit dose(s) may be contained within a blister pack. The pharmaceutical pack may optionally further comprise instructions for use.<br>
 <br>
As used herein, the term "patient pack" defines a package, prescribed to a patient, which contains pharmaceutical compositions for the whole course of treatment Patient packs usually contain one or more blister pack(s). Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.<br>
The combinations of the invention may produce a therapeutically efficacious effect relative to the therapeutic effect of the individual compounds when administered separately.<br>
The following general preferences and definitions shall apply to each of the moieties X, Y, RÂ°, R1 to R4 and any sub-definition, sub-group or embodiment thereof, unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
In this specification, references to formula (I) include formulae (0), (lÂ°), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV). (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups, examples or embodiments of formulae (0), (lÂ°), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV). (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Thus for example, references to inter alia therapeutic uses, pharmaceutical formulations and processes for making compounds, where they refer to formula (I), are also to be taken as referring to formulae (0), (lÂ°), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa). (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups, examples or embodiments of formulae (0), (lÂ°), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII).<br>
Similarly, where preferences, embodiments and examples are given for compounds of the formula (I), they are also applicable to formulae (0), (1Â°), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb). (VII) or (VIII) and subgroups, examples or embodiments of formulae (0), (1Â°), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
References to "carbocyclic" and "heterocyclic" groups as used herein shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring systems. Thus, for example, the term "carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups" includes within its scope aromatic, non-aromatic, unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. In general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain, for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3,4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ring members, more usually 3 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members. Examples of bicyclic groups are those containing 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring members.<br>
The carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups can be aryl or heteroaryl groups having from 5 to 12 ring members, more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. The term "aryl" as used herein refers to a carbocyclic group having aromatic character and the term "heteroaryl" is used herein to denote a heterocyclic group having aromatic character. The terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" embrace polycyclic (e.g. bicyclic) ring systems wherein one or more rings are non-aromatic, provided that at least one ring is aromatic. In such polycyclic systems, the group may be attached by the aromatic ring, or by a non-aromatic ring. The aryl or heteroaryl groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic groups and can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substrtuents, for example one or more groups R10 as defined herein.<br>
 <br>
The term "non-aromatic group" embraces unsaturated ring systems without aromatic character, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. The terms "unsaturated" and "partially saturated" refer to rings wherein the ring structure(s) contains atoms sharing more than one valence bond i.e. the ring contains at least one multiple bond e.g. a C=C, C=C or N=C bond. The term "fully saturated" refers to rings where there are no multiple bonds between ring atoms. Saturated carbocydic groups indude cydoalkyl groups as defined below. Partially saturated carbocydic groups indude cydoalkenyl groups as defined below, for example cydopentenyl, cydoheptenyl and cydooctenyl. A further example of a cydoalkenyl group is cydohexenyl.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups are monocydtc and bicydic groups containing from five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The heteroaryl group can be, for example, a five membered or six membered monocydtc ring or a bicydic structure formed from fused five and six membered rings or two fused six membered rings or, by way of a further example, two fused five membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Typically the heteroaryl ring will contain up to 4 heteroatoms, more typically up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in the heteroaryl group, induding any amino group substituents of the ring, will be less than five.<br>
Examples of five membered heteroaryl groups indude but are not limited to pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, furazan, oxazole, oxadiazole, oxatriazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, pyrazole, triazole and tetrazole groups.<br>

 <br>
Further examples of non-aromatic cyclic groups include bridged ring systems such as bicycloalkanes and azabicycloalkanes although such bridged ring systems are generally less preferred. By "bridged ring systems" is meant ring systems in which two rings share more than two atoms, see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages 131-133,1992.   Examples of bridged ring systems include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, bicyclo[2.2.2}octane, aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, bicyclo[3.2.1]octane and aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane. A particular example of a bridged ring system is the 1-aza-bicydo[2.2.2]octarv3-yl group.<br>
Where reference is made herein to carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups, the carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring can, unless the context indicates otherwise, be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituent groups R10 selected from halogen, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-C1-4 hydrocarbylamino, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members; a group R*-Rb wherein Ra is a bond, O, CO, X1C(X2), C(X2)X1, X1C(X2)X1, S, SO, SCfe, NRC, S02NRC or NR'SOz; and Rb is selected from hydrogen, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members, and a Ci_e hydrocarbyl group optionally substituted by one or more substrtuents selected from hydroxy, oxo, halogen, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-O-4 hydrocarbylamino, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members and wherein one or more carbon atoms of the Ci_e hydrocarbyl group may optionally be replaced by O, S, SO, SO2, NRC, X1C(X2), C(X2)X1 orX1C(X2)X1;<br>
Rc is selected from hydrogen and C1-4 hydrocarbyl; and<br>
X1 is O, S or NRC and X2 is =0, =S or =NRC<br>
Where the substituent group R10 comprises or includes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic group, the said carbocyclic or heterocyclic group may be unsubstituted or may itself be substituted with one or more further substituent groups R10. In one sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), such further substituent groups R10 may include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, which are typically not themselves further substituted. In another sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), the said further substituents do not include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups but are otherwise selected from the groups listed above in the definition of R10.<br>
The substituents R10 may be selected such that they contain no more than 20 non-hydrogen atoms, for example, no more than 15 non-hydrogen atoms, e.g. no more than 12, or 11, or 10, or 9, or 8, or 7, or 6, or 5 non-hydrogen atoms.<br>
Where the carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups have a pair of substituents on adjacent ring atoms, the two substrtuents may be linked so as to form a cyclic group. Thus, two adjacent groups R10, together with the carbon atoms or heteroatoms to which they are attached may form a 5-membered heteroaryi ring or a 5- or 6-membered non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, wherein the said heteroaryi and heterocyclic groups contain up to 3 heteroatom ring members selected from N, O and S. For example, an adjacent pair of substituents on adjacent carbon atoms of a ring may be linked via one or more heteroatoms and optionally substituted alkylene groups to form a fused oxa-, dioxa-, aza-, diaza- or oxa-aza-cycloalkyl group.<br>
Examples of such linked substituent groups include:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Examples of halogen substrtuents include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Fluorine and chlorine are particularly preferred.<br>
In the definition of the compounds of the formula (I) above and as used hereinafter, the term 'hydrocarbyl" is a generic term encompassing aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups having an all-carbon backbone and consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms, except where otherwise stated.<br>

Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, carbocyclic aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkylalkyl, cycloalkenyialkyl, and carbocyclic aralkyl, aralkenyl and aralkynyl groups. Such groups can be unsubstituted or, where stated, substituted by one or more substrtuents as defined herein. The examples and preferences expressed below apply to each of the hydrocarbyl substftuent groups or hydrocarbyl-containing substituent groups referred to in the various definitions of substrtuents for compounds of the formula (I) unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Preferred non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups are saturated groups such as alkyl and cycloalkyl groups.<br>
Generally by way of example, the hydrocarbyl groups can have up to eight carbon atoms, unless the context requires otherwise. Within the sub-set of hydrocarbyl groups having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, particular examples are C1-6 hydrocarbyl groups, such as C1-4 hydrocarbyl groups (e.g. C1.3 hydrocarbyl groups or C1-2 hydrocarbyl groups), specific examples being any individual value or combination of values selected from C1, C2, C3 C4. C5, C6, C7 and C1-4hydrocarbyl groups.<br>

Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 2-methyl butyl, 3-methyl butyl, and n-hexyl and its isomers. Within the sub-set of alkyl groups having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, particular examples are C1-6 alkyl groups, such as C1-4 alkyl groups (e.g. C1-3 alkyl groups or C1-2 alkyl groups).<br>

 <br>
group will have 2 to 8 carbon atoms, particular examples being C2-6 alkenyi groups, such as C2-4 alkenyl groups.<br>
Examples of cycloalkenyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropenyl, cycJobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl and cyclohexenyl. Within the sub-set of cycloalkenyl groups the cycloalkenyl groups have from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, and particular examples are C3-6 cycloalkenyl groups.<br>
Examples of alkynyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethynyl and 2-propynyl (propargyf) groups. Within the sub-set of alkynyl groups having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, particular examples are C2-6 alkynyl groups, such as C2-4 alkynyl groups.<br>

Salt forms may be selected and prepared according to methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002.<br>

For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K*, alkaline earth cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2*, and other cations such as Al3+. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH/) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NHsR*, NH2R2+, NHR3+, NR/). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicydohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
Where the compounds of the invention contain an amine function, these may form quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary ammonium compounds are within the scope of formula (0), (1Â°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein.<br>
The salt forms of the compounds of the invention are typically pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et a/., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Set., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts.   Such non-pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention.<br>
Particular salts for use in the preparation of liquid (e.g. aqueous) compositions of the compounds of formulae (I) and sub-groups and examples thereof as described herein are salts having a solubility in a given liquid earner (e.g. water) of greater than 25 mg/ml of the liquid carrier (e.g. water), more typically greater than 50 mg/ml and preferably greater than 100 mg/ml.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compound of the fomiula (I) as defined herein is provided in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an aqueous solution containing the said compound in the form of a salt in a concentration of greater than 25 mg/ml, typically greater than 50 mg/ml and preferably greater than 100 mg/ml.<br>
 <br>
Compounds of the formula (1) containing an amine function may also form N-oxides. A reference herein to a compound of the formula (I) that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide.<br>
Where a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.<br>
N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1977,7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichtoromethane.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) may exist in a number of different geometric isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula (I) include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula (I).<br>
 <br>
Where compounds of the formula (I) contain one or more chiral centres, and can exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to compounds of the formula (I) include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures (e.g. racemic mixtures) or two or more optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
The optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e. as + and - isomers, or d and / isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute stereochemistry using the "R and S"<br>
 <br>
nomenclature developed by Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold &amp; Prelog, Angew. Chem. int. Ed. Engl., 1966, 5, 385-415.<br>
Optical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral chromatography (chromatography on a chiral support) and such techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
As an alternative to chiral chromatography, optical isomers can be separated by forming diastereoisomenc salts with chiral acids such as (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-pyroglutamic acid, {-&gt;-di-toluoyN_-tartaric acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-malic acid, and (-)-camphorsulphonic, separating the diastereoisomers by preferential crystallisation, and then dissociating the salts to give the individual enantiomer of the free base.<br>
Where compounds of the formula (I) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms, one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain circumstances, rt may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (I) having one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%) of the compound of the formula (I) is present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment, 99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the formula (I) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer).<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope 1H, 2H (D), and 3H (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively 12C, 13C and 14C and 160 and 180.<br>
The isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.<br>
Esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters of the compounds of formula (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also embraced by Formula (I). Examples of esters are compounds containing the group -C(=0)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a Chalky! group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5-20 aryl group, preferably a C1-7 alkyl group. Particular examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)OCH3, -C(=0)OCH2CH3, -C(=0)OC(CH3)3, and -C(=0)OPh. Examples of acyloxy (reverse ester) groups are represented by -OC(=0)R, wherein R is an acyloxy substituent, for example, a Cw alkyl group, a C3-20 heterocyclyl group, or a Cs^oaryl group, preferably a C1.7 alkyl group. Particular examples of acyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, -OC(=0)CH3 (acetoxy), -OC(=0)CH2CH3, -OC(=0)C(CH3)3, -OC(=0)Ph, and -OC(=0)CH2Ph.<br>
Also encompassed by formula (I) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with<br>
 <br>
metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds. By "prodrugs" is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the formula (I).<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=0)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula -C(=0)OR wherein R is:<br>
Ci-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);<br>
Ci-7aminoalkyl<br>
(e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-{4-morpholino)ethyl); and<br>
acyloxy-Ci-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., acyloxymethyl;<br>
acyloxyethyl;<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl;<br>
acetoxymethyl;<br>
1-acetoxyethyl;<br>
1 -{1 -methoxy-1 -methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl;<br>
1 -(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>

1-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and<br>
1-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT, LIDEPT, etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>

One sub-group of acid addition salts includes salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, adipic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), aspartic (e.g. L-aspartic), caproic, carbonic, citric, dodecanoic, fumaric, galactaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic (e.g. D-gluconic), glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), glycolic, hippuric, lactic (e.g. (+)-L-lactic and (Â±)-DL-iactic), maleic, palmitic, phosphoric, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tartaric (e.g. (+)-L-tartaric) and thiocyanic acids.<br>
More particularly the salts are acid addition salts formed with an acid selected from methanesulphonic actd and acetic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the salt is an acid addition salt formed with methanesulphonic acid.<br>
In another embodiment, the salt is an acid addition salt formed with acetic acid.<br>
For convenience the salts formed from methanesulphonic acid and acetic acid may be referred to herein as the methanesulphonate or mesylate salts and acetate salts respectively.<br>
in the solid state, the salts can be crystalline or amorphous or a mixture thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the salts are amorphous.<br>
In an amorphous solid, the three dimensional structure that normally exists in a crystalline form does not exist and the positions of the molecules relative to one another in the amorphous form are essentially random, see for example Hancock et al. J. Pharm. Sci. (1997), 86, 1).<br>
In another embodiment, the salts are substantially crystalline; i.e. they are from 50% to 100% crystalline, and more particularly they may be at least 50% crystalline, or at least 60% crystalline, or at least 70% crystalline, or at least 80% crystalline, or at least 90% crystalline, or at least 95% crystalline, or at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.<br>
In a further embodiment, the salts are selected from the group consisting of salts that are from 50% to 100% crystalline, salts that are at least 50% crystalline, salts that are at least 60% crystalline, salts that are at least 70% crystalline, salts that are at least 80% crystalline, salts that are at least 90% crystalline, salts that are at least 95% crystalline, salts that are at least 98% crystalline, salts that are at least 99% crystalline, salts that are at least 99.5% crystalline, and salts that are at least 99.9% .crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.<br>
 <br>
More preferably the salts may be those (or may be selected from the group consisting of those) that are 95% to 100 % crystalline, for example at least 98% crystalline, or at least 99% crystalline, or at least 99.5% crystalline, or at least 99.6% crystalline or at least 99.7% crystalline or at least 99.8% crystalline or at least 99.9% crystalline, for example 100% crystalline.<br>
One example of a substantially crystalline salt is a crystalline salt formed with methanesulphonic acid.<br>
Another example of a substantially crystalline salt is a crystalline salt formed with acetic acid.<br>
The salts, in the solid state, can be solvated (e.g. hydrated) or non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous).<br>
In one embodiment, the salts are non-solvated (e.g. anhydrous). An example of a non-solvated salt is the crystalline salt formed with methanesulphonic acid as defined herein.<br>
The term "anhydrous" as used herein does not exclude the possibility of the presence of some water on or in the salt (e.g a crystal of the salt). For example, there may be some water present on the surface of the salt (e.g. salt crystal), or minor amounts within the body of the salt (e.g. crystal). Typically, an anhydrous form contains fewer than 0.4 molecules of water per molecule of compound, and more preferably contains fewer than 0.1 molecules of water per molecule of compound, for example 0 molecules of water.<br>
In another embodiment, the salts are solvated. Where the salts are hydrated, they can contain, for example, up to three molecules of water of crystallisation, more usually up to two molecules of water, e.g. one molecule of water or two molecules of water. Non-stoichiometric hydrates may also be formed in which the number of molecules of water present is less than one or is otherwise a non-integer. For example, where there is less than one molecule of water present, there may be for example 0.4, or 0.5, or 0.6, or 0.7, or 0.8, or 0.9 molecules of water present per molecule of compound.<br>
Other solvates include alcoholates such as ethanolates and isopropanolates.<br>
The salts can be synthesized from the parent compound 4-(2,6-dichloro-ben2oylamino)-1H-pyra2ole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-yiamide by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the parent compound 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide with the appropriate acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used<br>
One method of preparing an acid addition salt of 4-{2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide comprises forming a solution of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide free base in a solvent (typically an organic solvent) or mixture of solvents, and treating the solution with an acid to form a precipitate of the acid addition salt.<br>
The acid may be added as a solution in a solvent which is miscible with the solvent in which the free base is dissolved. The solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which the acid addition salt thereof is insoluble. Alternatively, the solvent in which the free base is initially dissolved may be one in which<br>
 <br>
:he acid addition salt is at least partially soluble, a different solvent in which the acid addition salt is less soluble subsequently being added such that the salt precipitates out of solution.<br>
In an alternative method of forming an acid addition salt, 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyra2ole-3-sarboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide is dissolved in a solvent comprising a volatile acid and optionally a co-solvent, thereby to form a solution of the acid addition salt with the volatile acid, and the resulting solution is then concentrated or evaporated to isolate the salt. An example of an acid addition salt that can be made in this way is the acetate salt<br>
 <br>
with an organic or inorganic acid as defined herein, other than hydrochloric acid, in an organic solvent to remove the terf-butyloxycarbonyl group and form an acid addition salt of 4-{2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide with the organic or inorganic acid, and optionally isolating the acid addition salt thus formed.<br>
The salt is typically precipitated from the organic solvent as it is formed and hence can be isolated by separation of the solid from the solution, e.g. by filtration.<br>
One salt form can be converted to the free base and optionally to another salt form by methods well known to the skilled person. For example, the free base can be formed by passing the salt solution through a column containing an amine stationary phase (e.g. a Strata-Nhfe column). Alternatively, a solution of the salt in water can be treated with sodium bicarbonate to decompose the salt and precipitate out the free base. The free base may then be combined with another acid by one of the methods described above or elsewhere herein.<br>
The methanesulphonate salt form is particularly advantageous because of its good stability at elevated temperatures and in conditions of high relative humidity, its non-hygroscopicity (as defined herein), absence of polymorph and hydrate formation, and stability in aqueous conditions. Moreover, it has excellent water solubility and has better physiochemical properties (such as a high melting point) relative to other salts.<br>
The term 'stable' or 'stability' as used herein includes chemical stability and solid state (physical) stability. The term 'chemical stability' means that the compound can be stored in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no chemical degradation or<br>
 <br>
decomposition. 'Solid-state stability' means the compound can be stored in an isolated solid form, or the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants as described herein, under normal storage conditions, with little or no solid-state transformation (e.g. hydration, dehydration, solvatisation, desolvatisation, crystallisation, recrystallisation or solid-state phase transition).<br>
The terms "non-hygroscopic" and "non-hygroscopicrty" and related terms as used herein refer to substances that absorb less than 5% by weight (relative to their own weight) of water when exposed to conditions of high relative humidity, for example 90% relative humidity, and/or do not undergo changes in crystalline form in conditions of high humidity and/or do not absorb water into the body of the crystal (internal water) in conditions of high relative humidity.<br>
Preferred salts for use in the combinations of the invention are acid addition salts (such as the mesylate and acetate and mixtures thereof as defined herein) having a solubility in a given liquid carrier (e.g. water) of greater than 15 mg/ml of the liquid earner (e.g. water), more typically greater than 20 mg/ml, preferably greater than 25 mg/ml, and more preferably greater than 30 mg/ml.<br>
In another aspect, there is provided a combination comprising an aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of 4^2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide (such as the mesylate and acetate and mixtures thereof as defined herein, and preferably the mesylate) in a concentration of greater than 15 mg/ml, typically greater than 20 mg/ml, preferably greater than 25 mg/ml, and more preferably greater than 30 mg/ml..<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the combination comprises an aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide selected from an acetate or methanesulphonate salt or a mixture thereof in a concentration of greater than 15 mg/ml, typically greater than 20 mg/ml, preferably greater than 25 mg/ml, and more preferably greater than 30 mg/ml.<br>
In another aspect, the combination of the invention includes an aqueous solution of an acid addition salt of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide (such as the mesylate and acetate and mixtures thereof as defined herein), wherein the aqueous solution has a pH of 2 to 12, for example 2 to 9, and more particularly 4 to 7.<br>
In the aqueous solutions defined above, the acid addition salt may be any of the salts described herein but, in one preferred embodiment, is a mesylate or acetate salt as defined herein, and in particular the mesylate salt.<br>
The combinations of the invention may include an aqueous solution of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide in protonated form together with one or more counter ions and optionally one or more further counter ions. In one embodiment one of the counter ions is selected from methanesulphonate and acetate. In another embodiment one of the counter ions is from the formulation buffer as described herein such as acetate. In a further embodiment there may be one or more further counter ions such as a chloride ion (e.g. from saline).<br>
The combinations of the invention may include an aqueous solution of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide in protonated form together with one or more counter ions<br>
 <br>
selected from methanesulphonate and acetate and optionally one or more further counter ions such as a chloride ion.<br>
In the situation where there is more than one counter ion the aqueous solution of 4-(2,6-dichloro-benzoylamino)-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide in protonated form will potentially contain a mixture of counter ions for example a mixture of methanesulphonate and acetate counter ions and optionally one or more further counter ions such as a chloride ion.<br>
The combinations of the invention may include an aqueous solution of 4^2,6-dic*loro4&gt;enzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide in protonated form together with one or more counter ions selected from methanesulphonate and acetate and optionally one or more further counter ions such as a chloride ion, and a mixture thereof.<br>
The aqueous solutions can be formed inter alia by dissolving a mesylate salt in a solution of acetate ions (e.g an acetate buffer) or by dissolving an acetate salt in a solution of mesylate ions. The mesylate and acetate ions may be present in the solution in a mesylate:acetate ratio of from 10:1 or less, for example 10:1 to 1:10, more preferably less then 8:1, or less than 7:1, or less than 6:1, or less than 5:1 or less than 4:1 or less than 3:1 or less than 2:1 or less than 1:1, more particularly from 1:1 to 1:10.   In one embodiment, the mesylate and acetate ions are present in the solution in a mesylate.acetate ratio of from 1:1 to 1:10, for example 1:1 to 1:8, or 1:1 to 1:7 or 1:1 to 1:6 or 1:1 to 1:5, e.g. approximately 1:4.8.<br>
The aqueous solutions of the salts may be buffered or unbuffered but in one embodiment are buffered.<br>
In the context of the acid addition salt formed with methanesulphonic acid, a preferred buffer is a buffer formed from acetic acid and sodium acetate, for example at a solution pH of approximately 4.6. At this pH and in the acetate buffer, the methanesulphonic acid salt has a solubility of about 35 mg/ml.<br>
The salts for use in the combinations of the invention are typically pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et a/., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. ScL, Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts.   Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms therefore also form part of the invention.<br>
Biological Activity<br>
The cytotoxic compounds and signalling inhibitors of the combinations of the invention interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells as described above and have activity against various cancers.<br>
The compounds of the formulae (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof are inhibitors or modulators (in particular inhibitors) of one or more cyclin dependent kinases and/or glycogen synthase kinases, and in particular one or more cyclin dependent kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6 and CDK9, and more particularly selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5 and CDK9.<br>
 <br>
Preferred compounds of the formulae (0), (1Â°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof are compounds that inhibit one or more CDK kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK9, for example CDK1 and/or CDK2.<br>
The compounds of the formulae (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof may modulate or inhibit GSKs such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3).<br>
As a consequence of their activity in modulating or inhibiting CDK kinases and/or glycogen synthase kinases, and the activity of the cytotoxic agents and signalling inhibitors described herein, the combinations of the invention are expected to be useful in providing a means of arresting, or recovering control of, the cell cycle in abnormally dividing cells. It is therefore anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers.<br>
CDKs play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, differentiation and CNS function. Therefore, CDK inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation such as cancer. In particular RB+ve tumours may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. RB-ve tumours may also be sensitive to CDK inhibitors.<br>
Examples of cancers which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, smalt cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burketf s lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, myefodysplastic syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma, a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma piC1-4entosum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.<br>
The cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to inhibition of any one or more cyclin dependent kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5 and CDK6, for example, one or more CDK kinases selected from CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK5, e.g. CDK1 and/or CDK2.<br>
Whether or not a particular cancer is one which is sensitive to inhibition by a cyclin dependent kinase may be determined by means of a cell growth assay as set out in the examples below or by a method as set out in the section headed "Methods of Diagnosis".<br>
Thus, in the pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer.<br>
 <br>
One group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.<br>
Another sub-set of cancers includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, oesophageal cancer, squamous cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas.<br>

Another particular cancer is diffuse large B cell lymphoma.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors or modulators of cyclin dependent kinases and/or glycogen synthase kinases (e.g. GSK-3) can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below and the level of activity exhibited by a given compound can be defined in terms of the IC50 value. Preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having an IC50 value of less than 1 micromole, more preferably less than 0.1 micromole.<br>
Methods for the Preparation of Compounds of Formula (I) of the Invention<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) and the various sub-groups thereof can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person. Unless stated otherwise, R1, R2, R3, Y, X and A are as hereinbefore<br>
defined.<br>
In this section, as in all the other sections of this application, references to formula (I) should be taken to refer also to formulae (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) wherein R1-A- forms an acyl group R1-CO- can be prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid of the formula R1-C02H or an activated derivative thereof with an appropriately substituted 4-amino-pyrazole as shown in Scheme 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The starting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1 is the 4-nrtro-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (X) which can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by nitration of the corresponding 4-unsubstituted pyrazole carboxy compound.<br>
The 4-nitro-pyrazole carboxylic acid (X), or a reactive derivative thereof, is reacted with the amine H2N-Y-R3 to give the 4-nitro-amide (XI). The coupling reaction between the carboxylic acid (X) and the amine is preferably carried out in the presence of a reagent of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, J. Amer. Chem Soc. 1955, 77, 1067), 1-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (referred to herein either as EDC or EDAC but also known in the art as EDCI and WSCDI) (Sheehan et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 2525), uronium-based coupling agents such as 0-(7-azabenzotria20l-1-yl)-A/,A/,A/',A/-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and phosphonium-based coupling agents such as 1-benzo-triazolyloxytris-(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro etal, Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, 31, 205). Carbodiimide-based coupling agents are advantageously used in combination with 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) (L. A. Carpino, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1993, 1_15, 4397) or 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Konig etal, Chem. Ber., 103, 708, 2024-2034). Preferred coupling reagents include EDC (EDAC) and DCC in combination with HOAt or HOBt.<br>
The coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxan, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidine, or in an aqueous solvent optionally together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may be earned out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N, A/-diisopropylethylamine.<br>
 <br>
As an alternative, a reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid, e.g. an anhydride or acid chloride, may be used. Reaction with a reactive derivative such an anhydride is typically accomplished by stirring the amine and anhydride at room temperature in the presence of a base such as pyridine.<br>
Amines of the formula H2N-Y-R3 can be obtained from commercial sources or can be prepared by any of a large number of standard synthetic methods well known those skilled in the art, see for example see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, and and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8), 1995, and see also the methods described in the experimental section below.<br>
The nitro-pyrazole amide (XI) is reduced to give the corresponding 4-amino-compound of the formula (XII). The reduction may be carried out by standard methods such as catalytic hydrogenation, for example in the presence of palladium on carbon in a polar solvent such as ethanol or dimethylformamide at room temperature. As an alternative, reduction may be effected using a reducing agent such as tin (II) chloride in ethanol, typically with heating, for example to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The 4-amino-pyrazole compound (XII) is then reacted with a carboxylic acid of the formula R1-C02H, or a reactive derivative thereof, using the methods and conditions described above for the formation of the amide (XI), to give a compound of the formula (I).<br>
Carboxylic acids of the formula R1-CC&gt;2H can be obtained commercially or can be synthesised according to methods well known to the skilled person, see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry and Organic Syntheses, the details for which are given above.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which X is a group R1-A-NR4, where A is a bond, can be prepared from the 4-amino compounds of the formula (XII) by a number of methods. Reductive amination with an appropriately substituted aldehyde or ketone can be earned out in the presence of variety of reducing agents (see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, pp898-900. For example, reductive amination can be carried out in the presence of sodium triacetoxyborohydride in the presence of an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane at or near ambient temperatures.<br>
Compounds in which X is a group R1-A-NR4 where A is a bond can also be prepared by the reaction of the 4-amino pyrazole compound (XII) with a compound of the formula R1-L in a nucleophilic displacement reaction where L is a leaving group such as a halogen.<br>
In an alternative synthetic route, compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula (XIII) with a compound of the formula R3-Y-NH2. The reaction can be carried out using the amide coupling conditions described above.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Compounds of the formula (I) where A is NH(C=0) can be prepared using standard methods for the synthesis of ureas. For example, such compounds can be prepared by reacting an aminopyrazole compound of the formula (XII) with a suitably substituted phenylisocyanate in a polar solvent such as DMF. The reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) where A is 0(C=0) can be made using standard methods for the synthesis of carbamates, for example by reaction of an amino pyrazole compound of the formula (XII) with a chloroformate derivative of the formula R1-0-C(0)-CI under conditions well known to the skilled person.<br>
Compounds of the formula (l)t wherein A is SO2, can be prepared from amino-compounds of the formula (XII) by standard methods for the formation of sulphonamides. For example, compounds of the fomrula XII) can be reacted with sulphonyl chlorides of the formula F^SC^CI or anhydrides of the formula (R1S02)20. The reaction is typically carried out in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile or a chlorinated hydrocarbon (for example dichloromethane) in the presence of a non-interfering base such as a tertiary amine (e.g. triethylamine) or pyridine, or diisopropylethyl amine (Hunigs base). Alternatively, where the base is a liquid, as is the case with pyridine, the base itself may be used as the solvent for the reaction.<br>
Compounds wherein X is a 5- or 6-membered ring containing a carbon atom ring member linked to the pyrazole group can be prepared by the sequence of reactions set out in Scheme 2.<br>
As shown in Scheme 2, an aldehyde (XIV) (in which X is a C-linked aryl or heteroaryl group such as phenyl) is condensed with maiononitrile to give the alkyne (XVI). The reaction is typically carried out in a polar solvent such as ethanol in the presence of a base such as piperidine, usually with heating. The alkyne (XVI) is then reacted with trimethylsilyidiazomethane in the presence an alkyl lithium such as butyl lithium to give the 5-trimethylsilyl pyrazole-3-nitrile (XVII). The reaction is carried out in a dry aprotic solvent such as THF under a protective atmosphere (e.g. nitrogen) at a reduced temperature (e.g. -78 Â°C).<br>
The nitrile (XVII) is hydrolysed with an alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide to give the acid (XIX) and/or the amide (XVII). Where a mixture of acid and amide are formed, they may be separated according to standard methods such as chromatography. The acid (XIX) can then be coupled with an amine of the formula R -Y-NH2 under typical amide coupling conditions of the type described above to give the compound of the formula (I).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
where "Hal" is a halogen such as chlorine, bromine or iodine, by means of a Suzuki coupling reaction with the appropriate aryl or heteroaryl boronate. The reaction can be carried out under typical Suzuki Coupling conditions in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as bis(tri-f-butylphosphine)palladium and a base (e.g. a carbonate such as potassium carbonate). The reaction may be carried out in an aqueous solvent system, for example aqueous ethanol, and the reaction mixture is typically subjected to heating, for example to a temperature in excess of 100Â°C.<br>
Compounds of the formula (XX) can be prepared from amino-pyrazole compounds of the formula (XII) by means of the Sandmeyer reaction (see Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th edition, by Jerry March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992, page 723) in which the amino group is converted to a diazonium group by reaction with nitrous acid, and the diazonium compound is then reacted with a copper (I) halide such as Cu(l)CI or Cu(l)l.<br>
Once formed, one compound of the formula (I) may be transformed into another compound of the formula (I) using standard chemistry procedures well known in the art For examples of functional group interconversions, see for example, Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2), and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8), 1995.<br>
The starting materials for the synthetic routes shown in the Schemes above, e.g. the pyrazoles of formula (X), can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. They can be obtained using known methods e.g. from ketones, such as in a process described in EP308020 (Merck), or the methods discussed by Schmidt in Helv. Chim. Acta., 1956, 39, 986-991 and Helv. Chim. Acta., 1958, 41, 306-309. Alternatively they can be obtained by conversion of a commercially available pyrazole, for example those containing halogen, nitro, ester, or amide functionalities, to pyrazoles containing the desired functionality by standard methods known to a person skilled in the art. For example, in 3-carboxy-4-nitropyrazole, the nitro group can be reduced to an amine by standard methods. 4-Nitro-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (XII) can either be obtained commercially or can be prepared by nitration of the corresponding 4-unsubstituted pyrazole carboxy compound, and pyrazoles containing a halogen, may be utilized in coupling reactions with tin or palladium chemistry.<br>
Protecting Groups<br>
In many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and deprotecting functional groups, can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
A hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsily! ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=0)CH3l -OAc).<br>
An aldehyde or ketone group may be protected, for example, as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2)t respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
 <br>
An amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OChfeCeHs, -NH-Cbz or NH-Z); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyioxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), or as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec).<br>
For example, in Scheme 1 above, when the moiety R3 in the amine H2N-Y-R3 contains a second amino group, such as a cyclic amino group (e.g. a piperidine or pyrrolidine group), the second amino group can be protected by means of a protecting group as hereinbefore defined, one preferred group being the te/f-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Where no subsequent modification of the second amino group is required, the protecting group can be earned through the reaction sequence to give an N-protected form of a compound of the formula (I) which can then be de-protected by standard methods (e.g. treatment with acid in the case of the Boc group) to give the compound of formula (0), (1Â°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (VIb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein.<br>
Other protecting groups for amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N-H groups, include toluenesulphonyl (tosyl) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups, benzyl groups such as a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group and tetrahydropyranyl (THP) groups.<br>
A carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an Ci-7alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a C1.7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7 trihaloalkyl ester); a trid-7 aikylsilyl-Cwalkyl ester; or a C5-20 aryl-C1-7 alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nrtrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.. A thiol group may be protected, for example, as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=0)CH3).<br>
Isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention<br>
The compounds of the invention can be isolated and purified according to standard techniques well known to the person skilled in the art One technique of particular usefulness in purifying the compounds is preparative liquid chromatography using mass spectrometry as a means of detecting the purified compounds emerging from the chromatography column.<br>
Preparative LC1-4S is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC1-4S methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; J Comb Chem.\ 2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C, Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; J Comb Chem.\ 2003; 5(3); 322-9.<br>
 <br>
An example of such a system for purifying compounds via preparative LC1-4S is described below in the Examples section of this application (under the heading "Mass Directed Purification LC1-4S System"). However, it will be appreciated that alternative systems and methods to those described could be used. In particular, nonnal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of the reverse phase methods described here. Most preparative LC1-4S systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described below could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.<br>
Cytotoxic compounds and signalling inhibitors for use according to the invention<br>
Any of a wide variety of cytotoxic compounds and signalling inhibitors may be used in the combinations of the invention. Cytotoxicity may be assayed or determined using any of a wide variety of techniques well-known to those skilled in the art. The cytotoxic compounds and signalling inhibitors of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers.<br>
Preferably, the cytotoxic compounds for use in the combinations of the invention as described herein are selected from the following classes:<br>
1.	camptothecin compounds;<br>
2.	antimetabolites;<br>
3.	vinca alkaloids;<br>
4.	taxanes;<br>
5.	platinum compounds;<br>
6.	DNA binders and Topo II inhibitors (including anthracydine derivatives);<br>
7.	a combination of two or more of the foregoing classes.<br>
Suitable signalling inhibitors are discussed in section 7, below.<br>
A reference to a particular cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor herein (for example, a reference to a camptothecin compound, antimetabolite, vinca alkaloid, taxane, platinum compound, DNA binder, Topo II inhibitor (including anthracydine derivatives)) is intended to indude ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof).<br>
1. Camptothedn compounds<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the cytotoxic compound is a camptothecin compound.<br>
Definition: The term "camptothedn compound" as used herein refers to camptothecin perse or analogues of camptothecin as described herein, induding the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or<br>
 <br>
solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
Technical background: Camptothecin compounds are compounds related to or derived from the parent compound camptothecin which is a water-insoluble alkaloid derived from the Chinese tree Camptothecin acuminata and the Indian tree Nothapodytes foetida. Camptothecin has a potent inhibitory activity against DNA biosynthesis and has shown high activity against tumour cell growth in various experimental systems. Its clinical use in anti-cancer therapy is, however, limited significantly by its high toxicity, and various analogues have been developed in attempts to reduce the toxicity of camptothecin while retaining the potency of its anti-tumour effect. Examples of such analogues include irinotecan and topotecan.<br>
These compounds have been found to be specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I. Topoisomerases are enzymes that are capable of altering DNA topology in eukaryotic cells. They are critical for important cellular functions and cell proliferation. There are two classes of topoisomerases in eukaryotic cells, namely type I and type II. Topoisomerase I is a monomeric enzyme having a molecular weight of approximately 100,000. The enzyme binds to DNA and introduces a transient single-strand break, unwinds the double helix (or allows it to unwind) and subsequently reseals the break before dissociating from the DNA strand.<br>
Irinotecan, namely 7^thyk10^4-{1i3iperidino)-1^iperidino)canbonyloxy-{20S)<amptothecin and its hydrochloride also known as cpt11 have been found to improved potency reduced toxicity superior water-solubility. irinotecan has clinical efficacy in the treatment of various cancers especially colorectal cancer. another important camptothecin compound is topotecan namely which trials shown against several solid tumours particularly ovarian cancer non-small cell lung carcinoma.></amptothecin>
Exemplary formulations: A parenteral pharmaceutical formulation for administration by injection and containing a camptothecin compound can be prepared by dissolving 100 mg of a water soluble salt of the camptothecin compound (for example a compound as described in EP 0321122 and in particular the examples therein) in 10 ml of sterile 0.9% saline and then sterilising the solution and filling the solution into a suitable container.<br>
Biological activity. The camptothecin compounds of the combinations of the invention are specific inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I are described above and have activity against various cancers.<br>
Prior art references: WO 01/64194 (Janssen) discloses combinations of famesyl transferase inhibitors and camptothecin compounds. EP 137145 (Rhone Poulenc Rorer) discloses camptothecin compounds including irinotecan. EP 321122 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses camptothecin compounds including topotecan.<br>
4<br>
Problems: Although camptothecin compounds have widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically effective in all patients or against all types of tumours. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of camptothecin compounds against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of camptothecin compounds to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
 <br>
Preferences: Preferred camptothecin compounds for use in accordance with the invention include irinotecan and topotecan referred to above. Irinotecan is commercially available for example from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer under the trade name "Campto" and may be prepared for example as described in European patent specification No. 137145 or by processes analogous thereto. Topotecan is commercially available for example from Sm'rthKline Beecham under the trade name "Hycamtin" and may be prepared for example as described in European patent number 321122 or by processes analogous thereto. Other camptothecin compounds may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for irinotecan and topotecan.<br>
Specific embodiments: In one embodiment the camptothecin compound is irinotecan. In another embodiment the camptothecin compound is a camptothecin compound other than irinotecan, for example a camptothecin compound such as topotecan.<br>
Posology. The camptothecin compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 0.1 to 400 mg per square metre (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 1 to 300 mg/ m2, particularly for irinotecan in a dosage of about 100 to 350 mg/ m2 and for topotecan in about 1 to 2 mg/ m2 per course of treatment These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
2. Antimetabolites<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the cytotoxic compound is an antimetabolite.<br>
Definition: The terms "antimetabolic compound* and "antimetabolite" are used as synonyms and define antimetabolic compounds or analogues of antimetabolic compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.   Thus, the antimetabolic compounds, otherwise known as antimetabolites, referred to herein consitute a large group of anticancer drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Such compounds include nucleoside derivatives, either pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analogs, that inhibit DNA synthesis, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and/or dihydrofolate reductase enzymes.<br>
Technical background: Antimetabolites (or antimetabolic compounds), constitute a large group of anticancer drugs that interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells. Such compounds include nucleoside derivatives, either pyrimidine or purine nucleoside analogues, that inhibit DNA synthesis, and inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and/or dihydrofolate reductase enzymes. Anti-tumour nucleoside derivatives have been used for many years for the treatment of various cancers. Among the oldest and most widely used of these derivatives is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) which has been used to treat a number of cancers such as colorectal, breast, hepatic and head and neck tumours.<br>
In order to enhance the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU, leucovorin has been used with the drug to modulate levels of thymidylate synthase which are critical to ensure that malignant cells are sensitive to the effect of 5-FU.<br>
 <br>
However, various factors limit the use of 5-FU, for example tumour resistance, toxicities, including gastrointestinal and haematological effects, and the need for intravenous administration. Various approaches have been taken to overcome these disadvantages including proposals to overcome the poor bioavailability of 5-FU and also to increase the therapeutic index of 5-FU, either by reducing systemic toxicity or by increasing the amount of active drug reaching the tumour.<br>
One such compound which provides improved therapeutic advantage over 5-FU is capecitabine, which has the chemical name [1-(5-oeoxy-P4&gt;Hibofuranosyl)-5-fluor^^<br>
ester. Capecitabine is a pro-drug of 5-FU which is well absorbed after oral dosing and delivers pharmacologically-active concentrations of 5-FU to tumours, with little systemic exposure to the active drug. As well as offering potentially superior activity to 5-FU, it can also be used for oral therapy with prolonged administration. Another anti-tumour nucleoside derivative is gemcitabine which has the chemical name 2-deoxy-2\2'-difluoro-cytidine, and which has been used in the treatment of various cancers including non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Further anti-tumour nucleosides include cytarabine and fludarabine. Cytarabine, also known as ara-C, which has the chemical name 1-p-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, has been found useful in the treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia (blast phase), acute lymphocytic leukemia and erythroleukemia.<br>
Fludarabine is a DNA synthesis inhibitor, which has the chemical name 9-p-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoro-adenine, and is used for the treatment of refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Other antimetabolites used in anticancer chemotherapy include the enzyme inhibitors rattrtrexed, pemetrexed, and methotrexate.<br>
Rattrtrexed is a folate-based thymidytate synthase inhibitor, which has the chemical name N-[5-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)-methyl -N-methylamino}-2-thenoyl}-L-glutamic acid, and is used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.<br>
Pemetrexed is a thymidylate synthase and transferase inhibitor, which has the chemical name N-[4-[2-(2-amino^,7-dihydro-4^xo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyIJ- L-glutamic acid, disodium salt and is used for the treatment of mesothelioma and locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in previously treated patients.<br>
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite which interrupts cell division by inhibiting DNA replication through dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, resulting in cell death, and has the chemical name is N-[4-{[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl}-ethylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, and is used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, and also in the treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head and neck, and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types, and advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.<br>
Biological activity. The antimetabolic compounds of the combinations of the invention interfere with metabolic processes vital to the physiology and proliferation of cancer cells as described above and have activity against various cancers.<br>
 <br>
Problems: These anticancer agents have a number of side-effects especially myelosuppression and in some cases nausea and diarrhoea. There is therefore a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
Preferences: Preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention include anti-tumour nucleosides such as 5-fiuorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine and fludarabine and enzyme inhibitors such as ralitrexed, pemetrexed and methotrexate referred to herein. Thus, preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention are anti-tumour nucleoside derivatives including 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine and fludarabine referred to herein. Other preferred antimetabolic compounds for use in accordance with the invention are enzyme inhibitors including ralitrexed, pemetrexed and methotrexate.<br>

combinations of the invention include 6-mercapto purine, 6-thioguanine, cladribine	, Z-deoxycoformycin<br>
and hydroxyurea.<br>
Specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the antimetabolic compound is gemcitabine. In another embodiment, the antimetabolic compound is a antimetabolic compound other than 5-fluorouracil or fludarabine, for example an antimetabolic compound such as gemcitabine, capecitabine, cytarabine, ralitrexed, pemetrexed or methotrexate.<br>
Posology. The antimetabolite compound will be administered in a dosage that will depend on the factors noted above. Examples of dosages for particular preferred antimetabolites are given below by way of example. With regard to anti-tumour nucleosides, these are advantageously administered in a daily dosage of 10 to 2500 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 700 to 1500 mg/m2, particularly for 5-FU in a dosage of 200 to 500 mg/m2, for gemcitabine in a dosage of 800 to 1200 mg/m2, for capecitabine in a dosage<br>
 <br>
of 1000 to 1200 mg/m2, for cytarabine in a dosage of 100-200mg/m2 and for fludarabine in a dosage of 10 to 50 mg/m2.<br>

raltitrexed can be administered in a dosage of about 3 mg/m2, pemetrexed in a dosage of 500 mg/m2 and<br>
methotrexate in a dosage of 30-40 mg/m2.<br>
The dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7,14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
3. Vinca alkaloids<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the cytotoxic compound is a vinca alkaloid.<br>
Definition: The term "vinca alkaloid" as used herein refers to vinca alkaloid compounds or analogues of vinca alkaloid compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
Technical background. The vinca alkaloids for use in the combinations of the invention are anti-tumour vinca alkaloids related to or derived from extracts of the periwinkle plant (Vinca rosea). Among these compounds, vinblastine and vincristine are important clinical agents for the treatment of leukaemias, lymphomas and testicular cancer, and vinorelbine has activity against lung cancer and breast cancer.<br>
Biological activity. The vinca alkaloid compounds of the combinations of the invention are tubulin targeting agents and have activity against various cancers, particularly a sub-set of cancers including leukaemias, lymphomas, testicular cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer.<br>
Problems: Vinca alkaloids suffer from toxicological effects. For example, vinblastine causes leukopenia which reaches a nadir in 7 to 10 days following drug administration, after which recovery ensues within 7 days, while vincristine demonstrates some neurological toxicity for example numbness and trembling of the extremities, loss of deep tendon reflexes and weakness of distal limb musculature. Vinorelbine has some toxicity in the fomi of granulocytopenia but with only modest thrombocytopenia and less neurotoxicity than other vinca alkaloids. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of anti-tumour vinca alkaloids against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of anti-tumour vinca alkaloids to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
Preferences: Preferred anti-tumour vinca alkaloids for use in accordance with the invention include vindesine, vinvesir, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine. Particularly preferred anti-tumour vinca alkaloids for use in accordance with the invention include vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine refererred to above. Vinblastine is commercially available for example as the sulphate salt for injection from Eli Lilly and Co under the trade name Velban, and may be prepared for example as described in German patent specification No. 2124023 or by<br>
 <br>
processes analogous thereto. Vincristine is commercially available for example as the sulphate salt for injection from Eli Lilly and Co under the trade name Oncovin and may be prepared for example as described in the above German patent specification No. 2124023 or by processes analogous thereto. Vincristine is also available as a liposomal formulation under the name Onco-TCSâ¢. Vinorelbine is commercially available for example as the tartrate salt for injection from Glaxo Wellcome under the trade name Navelbine and may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 4307100, or by processes analogous thereto. Other anti-tumour vinca alkaloids may be prepared in conventional manner for example by processes analogous to those described above for vinoblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine.<br>
Another preferred vinca alkaloid is vindesine. Vindesine is a synthetic derivative of the dimeric catharanthus alkaloid vinblastine, is available from Lilly under the tradename Eldisine and from Shionogi under the tradename Fildesin. Details of the synthesis of Vindesine are described in Lilly patent DE2415980 (1974) and by C. J. Burnett etaL, J. Med. Chem. 21, 88 (1978).<br>
Specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the vinca alkaloid compound is selected from vinoblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine. In another embodiment, the vinca alkaloid compound is vinoblastine.<br>
Posology. The anti-tumour vinca alkaloid is advantageously administered in a dosage of 2 to 30 mg pr square meter (mg/ m2 ) of body surface area, particularly for vinblastine in a dosage of about 3 to 12 mg/ m2 , for vincristine in a dosage of about 1 to 2 mg/ m2 , and for vinorelbine in dosage of about 10 to 30 mg/ m2 per course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 1, 14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
4. Taxanes<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the cytotoxic compound is a taxane.<br>
Definition:   The term "taxane compound" as used herein refers to taxane compounds or analogues of taxane compounds as described herein, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
Technical background: The taxanes are a class of compounds having the taxane ring system and related to or derived from extracts from certain species of yew (Taxus) trees. These compounds have been found to have activity against tumour cell growth and certain compounds in this class have been used in the clinic for the treatment of various cancers. Thus, for example, paclitaxel is a diterpene isolated from the bark of the yew tree, Taxus brevifolia, and can be produced by partial synthesis from 10-acetylbacctin, a precursor obtained from yew needles and twigs or by total synthesis, see Horton et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116; 1597-1601 (1994) and Nicholau et al, Nature 367:630 (1994). Paclitaxel has shown anti-neoplastic activity and more recently it has been established that its antitumour activity is due to the promotion of microtubule polymerisation, Kumar N.J., Biol. Chem. 256: 1035-1041 (1981); Rowinsky et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst 82: 1247-1259 (1990); and Schiff et al, Nature 277: 655-667 (1979). Paclitaxel has now demonstrated efficacy in several human tumours in clinical<br>
 <br>
trials, McGuire et al, Ann. int. Med., 111:273-279 (1989); Holmes et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83: 1797-1805 (1991); Kohn et al J. Natl. Cancer Inst 86:18-24 (1994); and Kohn et al, American Society for Clinical Oncology, 12 (1993). PacJ'rtaxel has for example been used for the treatment of ovarian cancer and also breast cancer.<br>
Another taxane compound which has been used in the clinic is docetaxel which has been shown to have particular efficacy in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Docetaxel has shown a better solubility in excipient systems than paditaxel, therefore increasing the ease with which it can be handled and used in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Biological activity: The taxane compounds of the combinations of the invention are tubulin targeting agents and have activity against various cancers.<br>
Problems: Clinical use of taxanes has demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index with many patients unable to tolerate the side effects associated with its use. There is therefore a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of taxane compounds against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of taxane compounds to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
Preferences: Preferred taxane compounds for use in accordance with the invention include paditaxel or docetaxel referred to herein. Paditaxel is available commercially for example under the trade name Taxol from Bristol Myers Squibb and docetaxel is available commercially under the trade name Taxotere from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Both compounds and other taxane compounds may be prepared in conventional manner for example as described in EP 253738, EP 253739 and WO 92/09589 or by processes analogous thereto.<br>
Specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the taxane compound is paditaxel. In another embodiment, the taxane compound is docetaxel.<br>
Posology. The taxane compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 50 to 400 mg per square metere (mg/ m2) of body surface area, for example 75 to 250 mg/ m2, particularly for paditaxel in a dosage of about 175 to 250 mg/ m2 and for docetaxel in about 75 to 150 mg/ m2 per course of treatment. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7,14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
5. Platinum compounds<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the cytotoxic compound is a platinum compound.<br>
Definition'. The term "platinum compounds" as used herein refers to any tumour cell growth inhibiting platinum compound including platinum coordination compounds, compounds which provide platinum in the form of an ion and analogues of platinum compounds as described herein, induding the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and proteded forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
 <br>
Technical background: In the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers, cisplatin (cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (II)) has been used successfully for many years in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumours for example testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and cancers of the head and neck, bladder, oesophagus and lung.<br>
More recently, other diamine -platinum complexes, for example carboplatin (diamino(l,1-cyclobutane-dicarboxylato)platinum (II)), have also shown efficacy as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various human solid malignant tumours, carboplatin being approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer. A further antitumour platinum compound is oxaliplatin (L-OHP), a third generation diamino-cyclohexane platinum-based cytotoxic drug, which has the chemical name (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)oxalato-platinum (II). Oxaliplatin is used, for example, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, based on its lack of renal toxicity and higher efficacy in preclinical models of cancer in comparison to cisplatin.<br>
Biological activity. The platinum compounds of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers., in particular against a sub-set of cancers including solid malignant tumours (for example testicular cancer), ovarian cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and cancers of the head and neck, bladder, oesophagus and lung.<br>
Problems: Although cisplatin and other platinum compounds have been widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in humans, they are not therapeutically effective in all patients or against all types of tumours. Moreover, such compounds need to be administered at relatively high*dosage levels which can lead to toxicity problems such as kidney damage. Also, and especially with cisplatin, the compounds cause nausea and vomiting in patients to a varying extent, as well as teucopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. There is therefore a need to increase efficacy and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
Preferences: Preferred platinum compounds for use in accordance with the invention include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. Other platinum compounds include chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexaneHÂ»socitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-ris-(pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; and tetraplatin. Cisplatin is commercially available for example under the trade name Platinol from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation as a powder for constitution with water, sterile saline or other suitable vehicle. Cisplatin may also be prepared for example as described by G. B. Kauffman and D. O. Cowan, Inorg. Synth. 7, 239 (1963), or by processes analogous thereto. Carboplatin is commercially available for example from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation under the trade name Paraplatin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 4140707, or by processes analogous thereto. Oxaliplatin is commercially available for example from Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc under the trade name Eloxatin, or may be prepared for example as described in U.S. patent specification No. 4169846, or by processes analogous thereto. Other platinum compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions are commercially available and/or can be prepared by conventional techniques.<br>
Specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the platinum compound is selected from chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin;<br>
 <br>
diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)maionatopiaiinum diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexaneH'socitn3to)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-{pyruvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; tetraplatin, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. In another embodiment, the platinum compound is a platinum compound other than cisplatin, for example a platinum compound such as chloro(diethylenediamino)-platinum (II) chloride; dichloro(ethylenediamino)-platinum (II); spiroplatin; iproplatin; diamino(2-ethylmalonato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)malonatoplatinum (II); (4-carboxyphthalo)-(1.2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum (II); (1r2-diaminocyclohexaneHisocitrato)platinum (II); (1,2-diaminocyclohexane)-cis-(pynjvato)platinum (II); onnaplatin; tetraplatin, cartx&gt;ptatin or oxaliplatin, preferably selected from carboplatin and oxaliplatin.<br>
Posology. The platinum coordination compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 500mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 50 to 400 mg/m2 particularly for cisplatin in a dosage of about 75 mg/m2, for carboplatin in about 300 mg/m2 and for oxaliplatin in about 50-100 mg/m2. These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7, 14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
6. Topoisomerase 2 inhibitors<br>
in another embodiment of the invention, the cytotoxic compound is a topoisomerase 2 inhibitor.<br>
Definition: The term "topoisomerase 2 inhibitor* as used herein refers to topoisomerase 2 inhibitor or analogues of topoisomerase 2 inhibitor as described above, including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
Technical background: An important class of anticancer drugs are the inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase 2 which causes double-strand breaks to release stress build-up during DNA transcription and translation. Compounds that inhibit the function of this enzyme are therefore cytotoxic and useful as anti-cancer agents.<br>
Among the topoisomerase 2 inhibitors which have been developed and used in cancer chemotherapy are the podophyllotoxins. These drugs act by a mechanism of action which involves the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA topoisomerase 2 or the formation of free radicals. Podophyllotoxin, which is extracted from the mandrake plant, is the parent compound from which two glycosides have been developed which show significant therapeutic activity in several human neoplasms, including pediatric leukemia, small cell carcinomas of the lung, testicular tumours, Hodgkin's disease, and large cell lymphomas. These derivatives are etoposide (VP-16), which has the chemical name 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-{4,6-0-(R)-ethylidene-P-D-glucopyranoside], and teniposide (VM-26), which has the chemical name 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin 9-[4,6-0-(R)-2- thenylidene-p-D-glucopyranoside].<br>
Both etoposide and teniposide, however, suffer from certain toxic side-effects especially myelosuppression. Another important class of topoisomerase 2 inhibitors are the anthracycline derivatives which are important anti-tumour agents and comprise antibiotiC1-4obtained from the fungus Streptomyces peuticus var. caesius and<br>
 <br>
their derivatives, characterized by having a tetracycline ring structure with an unusual sugar, daunosamine,<br>
attached by a glycosidic linkage. Among these compounds, the most widely used include daunorubicin, which<br>
has the chemical name 7-3-minc-2,3,6-trideoxy-Wyxohexosyloxy}-9-acetyl-7,8l9,1WetrahydrD-6I9,11-<br>
trihydroxy-4-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenequinone, doxorubicin, which has the chemical name 10-[(3-amino-<br>
5,12-naphthacenedione, and idarubicin, which has the chemical name 9-acety4(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-a-L-<br>
lyxohexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,9,11 -trihydroxy-5,12-naphthacenedione.<br>
Daunorubicin and idarubicin have been used primarily for the treatment of acute leukaemias whereas<br>
doxorubicin displays broader activity against human neoplasms, including a variety of solid tumours particularly<br>
breast cancer. Another anthracycline derivatives which is useful in cancer chemotherapy is epirubicin.<br>
Epirubicin, which has the chemical name (8S-ris)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-tn^Jeoxy-a-L-arabirK&gt;-h^<br>
7,8,9,10- tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacety^	is a doxorubicin<br>
analog having a catabolic pathway that involves glucuronidation, by uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase in the liver (unlike that for doxorubicin), which is believed to account for its shorter half-life and reduced cardiotoxicity. The compound has been used for the treatment of various cancers including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, advanced breast cancer and carcinoma of the bladder but suffers from the side-effects of myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. The latter side-effect is typical of anthracycline derivatives which generally display a serious cardiomyopathy at higher doses, which limits the doses at which these compounds can be administered. A further type of topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is represented by mitoxantrone, which has the chemical name 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis[[2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl]aminol-9t10-anthracenedione, and is used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukaemia, and breast, prostate and liver tumours. Others include losoxantrone and actinomycin D.<br>
Side-effects from administration of mitoxantrone include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia but less cardiotoxicity than anthracyclines.<br>
Biological activity. The topoisomerase 2 inhibitors of the combinations of the invention have activity against various cancers as described above. In particular, they have activity against a sub-set of cancers including leukemia (e.g. acute leukaemias), small cell carcinomas of the lung, testicular tumours, Hodgkin's disease, large cell lymphomas, breast cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, advanced breast cancer and carcinoma of the bladder.<br>
Problems: This class of cytotoxic compound is associated with side effects, as mentioned above. Thus, there is a need to provide a means for the use of lower dosages to reduce the potential of adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
Preferences: Preferred topoisomerase 2 inhibitor compounds for use in accordance with the invention include anthracycline derivatives, mitoxantrone and podophyllotoxin derivatives as defined to herein.<br>
Preferred anti-tumour anthracycline derivatives for use in accordance with the invention include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin and epirubicin referred to above. Daunorubicin is commercially available for example as<br>

Specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is an anthracydine derivative, mitoxantrone or a podophyllotoxin derivative. In another embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is selected from daunorubicin, doxorubidn, idarubidn and epirubidn. In a further embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is selected from etoposide and teniposide. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is etoposide. In another embodiment, the topoisomerase 2 inhibitor is an anthracydine derivative other than doxorubicin, for example a topoisomerase 2 inhibitor such as daunorubidn, idarubidn and epirubidn.<br>
Posology. The anti-tumour anthracydine derivative is advantageously administered in a dosage of 10 to 150 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 15 to 60 mg/m2, particularly for doxorubidn in a dosage of about 40 to 75 mg/m2, for daunorubicin in a dosage of about 25 to 45mg/m2, for idarubidn in a dosage of about 10 to 15 mg/m2 and for epirubidn in a dosage of about 100-120 mg/m2.<br>

 <br>
The anti-tumour podophyllotoxin derivative is advantageously administered in a dosage of 30 to 300 mg/m2 of body surface area, for example 50 to 250mg/m particularly for etoposide in a dosage of about 35 to 100 mg/m, and for teniposide in about 50 to 250 mg/m2.<br>
The dosages noted above may generally be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7,14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
The antibiotic bleomycin may also be used as a cytotoxic agent as an ancillary compound according to the invention.<br>
7. Signalling inhibitors<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the combination comprises a signaling inhibitor.<br>
Definition: The term "signalling inhibitor* as used herein refers to signalling inhibitors or analogues of signalling inhibitors as described herein, including the ionic, salt solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
Technical background: A malignant tumour is the product of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cell growth is controlled by a delicate balance between growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors. In normal tissue the production and activity of these factors results in differentiated cells growing in a controlled and regulated manner that maintains the normal integrity and functioning of the organ. The malignant cell has evaded this control; the natural balance is disturbed (via a variety of mechanisms) and unregulated, aberrant cell growth occurs.<br>
One driver for growth is the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the receptor for EGF (EGFR) has been implicated in the development and progression of a number of human solid tumours including those of the lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary, head and neck. EGFR is a member of a family of four receptors, namely EGFR (HER1 or ErbB1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). These receptors are large proteins that reside in the cell membrane, each having a specific external ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an internal domain which has tyrosine kinase enzyme activity. When EGF attaches to EGFR, it activates the tyrosine kinase, triggering reactions that cause the cells to grow and multiply. EGFR is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of cancer cells, which may divide excessively in the presence of EGF. Inhibition of EGFR activity has therefore been a target for chemotherapeutic research in the treatment of cancer. Such inhibition can be effected by direct interference with the target EGFR on the cell surface, for example by the use of antibodies, or by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the activated receptor.<br>
Examples of antibodies which target EGFR are the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab. Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER 2) in primary breast carcinomas has been shown to correlate with a poor clinical prognosis for certain patients. Trastuzumab is a highly purified recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal lgG1 kappa antibody that binds with high affinity and<br>
 <br>
specificity to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. In vitro and in vivo preclinical studies have shown that administration of trastuzumab alone or in combination with pacl'rtaxel or carboplatin significantly inhibits the growth of breast tumour-derived cell lines that over-express the HER2 gene product In clinical studies trastuzumab has been shown to have clinical activity in the treatment of breast cancer. The most common adverse efFects of trastuzumab are fever and chills, pain, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dyspnea, rhinitis, and insomnia. Trastuzumab has been approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer involving over-expression of the HER2 protein in patients who have received one or more chemotherapy regimes.<br>
Cetuximab has been used for the treatment of irotecan-refractory colorectal cancer. It is also being evaluated both as a single agent and in combination with other agents for use in the treatment of a variety of other cancers for example head and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic carcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. The administration of cetuximab can cause serious side effects, which may include difficulty in breathing and low blood pressure.<br>
Examples of agents which target EGFR tyrosine kinase activity include the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and eriotinib. Gefitinib which has the chemical name 4-{3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)quinazoline, is used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and is also under development for other solid tumours that over-express EGF receptors such as breast and colorectal cancer. It has been found that patients receiving gefitinib may develop interstitial lung disease that causes inflammation within the lung. Eye irritation has also been observed in patients receiving gefitinib. Eriotinib, which has the chemical name N-(3-ethynyl-phenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazoline, has also been used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and is being developed for the treatment of various other solid tumours such as pancreatic cancer, the most common side effects being rash, loss of appetite and fatigue; a more serious side effect which has been reported is interstitial lung disease.<br>
Another growth factor which has received attention as a target for anticancer research is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF acts via association with a family of cell surface receptors and is a key regulator of vasculogenesis during angiogenic processes including wound healing, retinopathy, psoriasis, inflammatory disorders, tumour growth and metastasis. Studies have shown that over-expression of VEGF is strongly associated with invasion and metastasis in human malignant disease.<br>
An example of an antibody that targets the VEGFA/EGF receptor system is the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab which is a recombinant humanised monoclonal lgG1 antibody that binds to and inhibits the growth factor VEGF. Bevacizumab has been used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, for example in combination with 5-fluorouracil. Bevacizumab is also being developed as a potential treatment for other solid tumours such as metastatic breast cancer, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma. The most serious adverse events associated with bevacizumab include gastrointestinal perforations, hypertensive crises, nephrotic syndrome and congestive heart failure. Other therapeutic agents in development which target the action of VEGF at alternate points in the signal transduction cascade intiated by this growth factor include sunitinib which is marketed under the trade name Sutent by Sugen/Pfizer and inhibits the kinase activity of the VEGF receptor. Sutent has demonstrated efficacy in Phase III trials in gastrointestinal tumours.<br>
 <br>
Another growth factor of importance in tumour development is the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that comprises a family of peptide growth factors that signal through cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR) and stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation. PDGF expression has been demonstrated in a number of different solid tumours including glioblastomas and prostate carcinomas. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate, which has the chemical name 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)methyl]-N^4-methyl-3^[4^<br>
blocks activity of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and the cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, and as such is approved for the treatment on chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Imatinib mesylate is also a potent inhibitor of PDGFR kinase and is currently being evaluated for the treatment of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and glioblastoma multiforme, based upon evidence in these diseases of activating mutations in PDGFR. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events were edema, nausea, vomiting, cramps and musculoskeletal pain.<br>
A further growth factor target for cancer chemotherapy is inhibition of Raf which is a key enzyme in the signal transduction pathway that triggers cell growth. Abnormal activation of this pathway is a common factor in the development of most cancers, including two-thirds of melanomas. By blocking the action of Raf kinase, it may be possible to reverse the progression of these tumours. One such inhibitor is sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) which has the chemical name 4^4^3-(4-diloro-3^trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ureido)phenoxy}-N2-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide. Sorafenib targets both the Raf signalling pathway to inhibit cell proliferation and the VEGFR/PDGFR signalling cascades to inhibit tumour angiogenesis. Raf kinase is a specific enzyme in the Ras pathway. Mutations in the Ras gene occur in approximately 20 percent of all human cancers, including 90 percent of pancreatic cancers, 50 percent of colon cancers and 30 percent of non-smatl cell lung cancers. Sorafenib is being investigated for the treatment of a number of cancers including liver and kidney cancer. The most common side effects of sorafenib are pain, swelling, redness of the hands and/or feet, and also rash, fatigue and diarrhea.<br>
Biological activity. The signalling inhibitors of the combinations of the invention are specific inhibitors of cell signalling proteins as described above and have activity against various cancers. Combinations of compounds of Formula I with signalling inhibitors may be beneficial in the treatment and diagnosis of many types of cancer. Combination with a moleculariy targeted agent such as a signalling inhibitor (e.g. Iressa, Avastin, herceptin, or Gleevecâ¢) would find particular application in relation to cancers which express or have activated the relevant molecular target such as EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, ErbB2, BCRabl, c-kit, PDGF. Diagnosis of such tumours could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RTPCR and FISH.<br>
Problems: There is a need to increase the inhibitory efficacy of signalling inhibitors against tumour growth and also to provide a means for the use of lower dosages of signaling inhibitors to reduce the potential for adverse toxic side effects to the patient.<br>
Preferences: Preferred signalling inhibitors for use in accordance with the invention include antibodies targeting EGFR such as monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and eriotinib, VEGF targeting antibody is bevacizumab, PDGFR inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate and Raf inhibitor such as sorafenib referred to herein.<br>
 <br>
Preferred antibodies targeting EGFR include the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab. Trastuzumab is commercially available from Genentech Inc under the trade name Herceptin, or may be obtained as described in U.S. patent specification No. 5821337. Cetuximab is commercially available from Bristol-Myers Squibb Corporation under the trade name Erbitux, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/40210.<br>
Preferred EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors include gefitinib and eriotinib. Gefitinib is commercially available from AstraZeneca pic under the trade name Iressa, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/33980. Eriotinib is commercially available from Pfizer Inc under the trade name Tarceva, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 96/30347.<br>
A preferred antibody targeting VEGF is bevacizumab which is commercially available from Genentech Inc under the trade name Avastin, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 94/10202.<br>
A preferred PDGFR inhibitor is imatinib mesylate which is commercially available from Novartis AG under the trade name Gleevecâ¢ (a.k.a. GlivecÂ®), or may be obtained as described in European patent specification No 564409.<br>
A preferred Raf inhibitor is sorafenib which is available from Bayer AG, or may be obtained as described in PCT patent specification No. WO 00/42012.<br>
Specific embodiments: In one embodiment, the signalling inhibitor is gefitinib (Iressa). In other embodiments the signalling inhibitor is selected from trastuzumab, cetuximab, gefitinib, eriotinib, bevacizumab, imatinib mesylate and sorafenib.<br>
Posology. With regard to the EGFR antibodies, these are generally administered in a dosage of 1 to 500 mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, trastuzumab being advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 5 mg/m2 of body surface area, particularly 2 to 4 mg/m2; cetuxumab is advantageously administered in a dosage of about 200 to 400 mg/m2, preferably about 250 mg/m2.<br>
With regard to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, these are generally administered in a daily oral dosage of 100 to 500 mg, for example gefitinib in a dosage of about 250 mg and eriotinib in a dosage of about 150 mg.<br>
With regard to the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, this is generally administered in a dosage of about 1 to 10 mg/kg for example about 5 mg/kg.<br>
With regard to the PDGF inhibitor imatinib, this is generally administered in a dosage of about 400 to 800 mg per day preferably about 400 mg per day.<br>
With regard to the Raf inhibitor sorfenib, this is still under evaluation but a possible dosage is about 800mg daily.<br>
 <br>
These dosages may be administered for example once, twice or more per course of treatment, which may be repeated for example every 7,14, 21 or 28 days.<br>
PKB pathway inhibitors<br>
Another preferred class of signaling inhibitor for use in the combinations of the invention are PKB pathway inhibitors. PKB pathway inhibitors are those that inhibit the activation of PKB, the activity of the kinase itself or modulate downstream targets, blocking the proliferative and cell survival effects of the pathway. Target enzymes in the pathway include Phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), PKB itself, Mammalian target of rapamydn (MTOR), PDK-1 and p70 S6 kinase and forkhead translocation.<br>
Several components of the PI 3-kinase/PKB/PTEN pathway are implicated in oncogenesis. In addition to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, integrin-dependent cell adhesion and G-protein coupled receptors activate PI 3-kinase both directly and indirectly through adaptor molecules. Functional loss of PTEN (the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in cancer after p53), oncogenic mutations in PI 3-kinase, amplification of PI 3-kinase and overexpression of PKB have been established in many malignancies. In addition, persistent signaling through the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway by stimulation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor is a mechanism of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.<br>
The discovery of non-random, somatic mutations in the gene encoding p110a in a range of human tumours suggests an oncogenic role for the mutated PI 3-kinase enzyme (Samuels, et al., Science, 304 554, April 2004). Mutations in p110a have since been detected in the following human tumours: colon (32%), hepatocellular (36%) and endometroid and clear cell cancer (20%). p110a is now the most commonly mutated gene in breast tumours (25-40%). Forkhead family translocations often occur in acute leukemia.<br>
The PI 3-kinase/PKB/PTEN pathway is thus an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit proliferation and surmount resistance to cytotoxic agents in cancer cells. Examples of PKB pathway inhibitors include PI3K Inhibitors such as Semaphore, SF1126 and MTOR inhibitors such as Rapamycin Analogues. RAD 001 (everolimus) from Novartis is an orally available derivative of the compound rapamycin. The compound is a novel macrolide, which is being developed as an antiproliferative drug with applications as an immunosuppressant and anticancer agent. RAD001 exerts its activity on growth-factor dependent proliferation of cells through its high affinity for an intracellular receptor protein, FKBP-12. The resulting FKBP-12/RAD001 complex then binds with mTOR to inhibit downstream signaling events. The compound is currently in clinical development for a wide variety of oncology indications. CCI 779 (temsirolemus) from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and AP23573 from Ariad Pharmaceuticals are also rapamycin analogues. AP23841 and AP23573 from Ariad Pharmaceutical also target mTOR. Calmodulin inhibitors from Harvard are forkhead translocation inhibitors. (Nature Reviews drug discovery, Exploiting the PI3K/AKT Pathway for Cancer Drug Discovery; Bryan T. Hennessy, Debra L. Smith, Prahlad T. Ram, Yiling Lu and Gordon B. Mills; December 2005. Volume 4; pages 988-1004).<br>
Preferred PKB pathway inhibitors for use in the combinations of the invention include PKB inhibitors, as described in more detail below:<br>
 <br>
Definition: The term "PKB inhibitor" is used herein to define a compound which inhibits OF modulates protein kinase B (PKB), including the ionic, salt, solvate, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, ester, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof (preferably the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof, and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof), as described above.<br>
Technical background: KRX-0401 (Perifosine/ NSC 639966) is a synthetic substituted heterocyclic alkylphosphocholine that acts primarily at the cell membrane targeting signal transduction pathways, including inhibition of PKB phosphorylation. KRX-0401 has been evaluated in phase 1 studies as a potential oral anticancer drug. Dose limiting toxicities included nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Gastrointestinal toxicities increased at higher doses. A phase II trial in refractory sarcoma is planned.<br>
API-2/TCN is a small molecule inhibitor of PKB signaling pathway in tumour cells. Phase I and II clinical trials of API-2/TCN have been conducted on advanced tumours. API-2/TCN exhibited some side effects, which include hepatotoxidty, hypertriglyceridemia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperglycemia. Due to its severe side effects at high doses, API-2/TCN has been limited in the clinic.<br>
RX-0201 is being developed as an AKT protein kinase inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumours. In July 2004, a phase I trial was initiated in patients with advanced or metastasized cancers. Data from this showed RX-0201 inhibited overexpression of Akt and suppressed cancer growth in brain, breast, cervix, liver, lung, ovary, prostate and stomach tumours, and was well tolerated. By March 2005, US Orphan Drug status had been granted to RX-0201 for several solid tumour types.<br>
Enzastaurin HCI (LY317615) suppresses angiogenesis and was advanced for clinical development based upon anti-angiogenic activity. It is described as a selective PKCG inhibitor. It also has a direct anti-tumour effect, and suppresses GSK3R phosphorylation.<br>
SR-13668 is claimed to be an orally active specific AKT inhibitor that significantly inhibits phospho-AKT in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo assessment in mice showed no adverse effects at doses 10 times more than were needed for antitumour activity.<br>
PX-316 is a D-3-deoxy-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol that binds to the PH domain of PKB, trapping it in the cytoplasm and thus preventing PKB activation. Anti-tumour activity was seen in early xenografts and was welt tolerated.<br>
Allosteric, selective inhibitors of PKB based on a 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline core or a 5,6-diphenylpyrazin-2(1H)-one core have been developed (Merck).<br>
KRX-0401: In a Phase I weekly dosing study conducted in Europe, the recommended Phase II dose was 600/mg/week. Subsequent studies conducted in the U.S. have shown that much higher doses are well tolerated when the doses are divided and administered at 4 to 6 hour intervals. In addition, it has been shown that KRX-0401 has a very long half- life in the range of 100 hours. This makes the possibility of a relative non- toxic, intermittent dosing schedule very plausible.<br>
 <br>
A phase I trial of API-2 was conducted using a 5-day continuous infusion schedule. Dose levels ranged from 10 mg/sq m/day X 5 days to 40 mg/sq m/day X 5 days. Initially, courses were repeated every 3 to 4 weeks. As cumulative toxicity became manifested, the interval between courses was changed to every 6 weeks. Recommended schedule for Phase II studies is 20 mg/sq m/day for 5 days every 6 weeks. A Phase II trial of TCN-P was conducted in metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix using a 5-day continuous infusion schedule. The starting dose was 35 mg/m2 x 5 days and courses were repeated every 6 iweei\S.<br>
Further PKB inhibitors include Perifosine from Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. Perifbsine is an oral Akt inhibitor which exerts a marked cytotoxic effect on human tumour cell lines, and is currently being tested in several phase II trials for treatment of major human cancers. KRX-0401 (Perifbsine/ NSC 639966) has the structure:<br>
 <br>

It can be prepared according to Biochemistry (2002), 41(32), 10304-10314 or Peptor patent publication WO2001091754.<br>
DeveloGen (formerly Peptor) is investigating NL-71-101, a protein kinase B (PKB) inhibitor, for the potential treatment of cancer [466579], [539004]. At the beginning of 2003, the compound was undergoing lead optimization [495463]. By February 2004, the company was seeking to outlicense certain development rights to its protein kinase B program [523638].<br>
In 2002, data were published showing that NL-71-101 inhibited the activity of PKB over PKA, PKG and PKC with IC50 values of 3.7, 9, 36 and 104 microM, respectively. NL-71-101 induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 tumour cells, in which PKB is amplified at concentrations of 50 and 100 microM [466579]. This compound has the<br>

Specific embodiments: Embodiments contemplated include combinations in which the anti-cancer agent is a PKB inhibitor selected from one or more of the specific compounds described above.<br>
 <br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compounds in the combinations of the invention to be administered without any accompanying pharmaceutical excipients or carriers, it is preferable to present them in the form of pharmaceutical compositions (e.g. formulations). As such, they may be formulated for simultaneous or sequential administration.<br>
Where they are intended for sequential administration, they will typically be formulated in separate compositions which may be of the same type or a different type. Thus, for example, the components of the combination may be formulated for delivery by the same route (e.g. both by the oral route or both by injection) or they may be formulated for administration by different routes (e.g. one by the oral route and another by a parenteral route such as by i.v. injection or infusion). In a preferred embodiment the compound 4-(2,6-dtchloro-benzoylamino)-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxylJc acid piperidin-4-ylamide and salts therof, particularly acid addition salts such as the methanesulphonic arid, acetic arid and hydrochloric acid salts is administered sequentially (either before or after) or simulatenously with the ancillary compound. Preferably the compound 4-
When they are intended for simultaneous administration, they may be formulated together or separately and, as above, may be formulated for administration by the same route or by different routes.<br>
The compositions typically comprise at least one active compound of the combination together with one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. The compositions may also include other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (C1-4-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).<br>
Also included are agents that inhibit bone resorption such as bisphosphonate agents e.g. zoledronate, pamidronate and ibandronate, as well as agents that suppress inflammatory responses (such as dexamethazone, prednisone, and prednisolone). Also included are agents used to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I in acromegaly patients such as synthetic forms of the brain hormone somatostatin, which includes octreotide acetate which is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Further included are agents such as leucovorin, which is used as an antidote to drugs that decrease levels of folic arid, or folinic arid it self. In one particular embodiment is the combination of 5FU and leucovorin or 5FU and folinic arid. In addition megestrol acetate can be used for the treatment of side-effects including oedema and thromoembolic episodes.<br>
Therefore in one embodiment the combinations further include an additional agent selected from erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (C1-4-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-<br>
 <br>
CSF), zoledronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, dexamethazone, prednisone, prednisolone, leucovorin, folinic acid and megestrol acetate.<br>
In particular the combinations further include an additional agent selected from erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (C1-4-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), zoledronate, pamidronate, dexamethazone, prednisone, prednisolone, leucovorin, and folinic acid such as erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (C1-4-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).<br>
Zoledronic acid is available from Novartis under the Tradename ZometaÂ®. It is used in the treatment of bone metastasis in a variety of tumor types and for the treatment of hypercalcemia.<br>
Pamidronate disodium (APD) available from Novartis under the tradename Aredia is a bone-resorption inhibitor and is used in the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia. Pamidronate disodium is for i.v. injection.<br>
Octreotide acetate is available from Novartis as Sandostatin LAR Â® (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) and SandostatinÂ® (octreotide acetate for injection ampuls or for vials). Octreotide is known chemically as L-Cysteinamide, D-phenylalanyl^-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-[&gt;-m^<br>
hydroxy-Hhydroxy-methyl) propyl}-, cyclic (2, 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*,R*)]. Synthetic forms of the brain hormone somatostatin, such as octreotide, work at the site of the tumour. They bind to sst-2/sst-5 receptors to regulate gastrointestinal hormone secretion and affect tumour growth.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable earners, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable* as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judC1-4ent, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation. Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides combinations of a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor and a compound of the formula (0) or a sub-group thereof such as formulae (1Â°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery. The delivery can be by bolus injection, short term infusion or longer term infusion and can be via passive delivery or through the utilisation of a suitable infusion pump.<br>
 <br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, co-solvents, organic solvent mixtures, cydodexmn complexation agents, emulsifying agents (for forming and stabilizing emulsion formulations), liposome components for forming liposomes, gellabfe polymers for forming polymeric gels, lyophilisation protectants and combinations of agents for, inter alia, stabilising the active ingredient in a soluble form and rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration may also take the form of aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents (R. G. Strickly, Solubilizing Excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 21(2) 2004, p 201-230).<br>
A drug molecule that is kxiizable can be sdubfltzed to the desired concentration by pH adjustment rf the drug's pKa is sufficiently away from the formulation pH value. The acceptable range is pH 2-12 for intravenous and intramuscular administration, but subcutaneousfy the range is pH 2.7-9.0. The solution pH is controlled by either the salt form of the drug, strong acids/bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or by solutions of buffers which include but are not limited to buffering solutions formed from glycine, citrate, acetate, maleate, succinate, histidine, phosphate, tris(hydroxymethy1)aminomethane (TRIS), or carbonate.<br>
The combination of an aqueous solution and a water-soluble organic solvent/surfactant (i.e., a cosotvent) is often used in injectable formulations. The water-soluble organic solvents and surfactants used in injectable formulations include but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethanol, polyethylene glycol 300, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin, dimethylacetamide (DMA), tUr*fa&amp;2-WTdMone (NMP; Pharmasolve), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Solutol HS 15, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80. Such formulations can usually be, but are not always, diluted prior to injection.<br>
Propylene glycol, PEG 300, ethanol, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80 are the entirely organic water-miscible solvents and surfactants used in commercially available injectable formulations and can be used in combinations with each other. The resulting organic formulations are usually diluted at least 2-fold prior to IV bolus or IV infusion.<br>
Alternatively increased water solubility can be achieved through molecular complexation with cyclodextrins<br>
Liposomes are closed spherical vesicles composed of outer lipid bilayer membranes and an inner aqueous core and with an overall diameter of 
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by lyophilising a compound of formula (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein or acid<br>
 <br>
addition salt thereof. Lyophilisation refers to the procedure of freeze-drying a composition. Freeze-drying and lyophilisation are therefore used herein as synonyms. A typical process is to solubilise the compound and the resulting formulation is clarified, sterile filtered and aseptically transferred to containers appropriate for lyophilisation (e.g. vials). In the case of vials, they are partially stoppered with lyo-stoppers. The formulation can be cooled to freezing and subjected to lyophilisation under standard conditions and then hermetically capped forming a stable, dry tyophile formulation. The composition will typically have a low residual water content e.g. less than 5% e.g. less than 1 % by weight based on weight of the lyophile.<br>
The lyophilsation formulation may contain other excipients for example, thickening agents, dispersing agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservatives, and tonicity adjusters. Typical buffers include phosphate, acetate, citrate and glycine. Examples of antioxidants include ascorbic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulph'rte, monothioglycerol, thiourea, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyl anisole, and ethylenediamietetraacetic acid salts. Preservatives may include benzoic acid and its salts, sorbic acid and its salts, alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride. The buffers mentioned previously, as well as dextrose and sodium chloride, can be used for tonicity adjustment if necessary.<br>
Bulking agents are generally used in lyophilisation technology for facilitating the process and/or providing bulk and/or mechanical integrity to the lyophilized cake. Bulking agent means a freely water soluble, solid particulate diluent that when co-lyophilised with the compound or salt thereof, provides a physically stable lyophilized cake, a more optimal freeze-drying process and rapid and complete reconstitute. The bulking agent may also be utilised to make the solution isotonic.<br>
The water-soluble bulking agent can be any of the pharmaceutical^ acceptable inert solid materials typically used for lyophilisation. Such bulking agents include, for example, sugars such as glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose; polyalcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol; amino acids such as glycine; polymers such as poiyvinylpyrrolidine; and polysaccharides such as dextran.<br>
The ratio of the weight of the bulking agent to the weight of active compound is typically within the range from about 1 to about 5, for example of about 1 to about 3, e.g. in the range of about 1 to 2.<br>
Alternatively they can be provided in a solution form which may be concentrated and sealed in a suitable vial. Sterilisation of dosage forms may be via filtration or by autoclaving of the vials and their contents at appropriate stages of the formulation process. The supplied formulation may require further dilution or preparation before delivery for example dilution into suitable sterile infusion packs.<br>
Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection can also comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use.<br>
 <br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
If a compound is not stable in aqueous media or has low solubility in aqueous media, it can be formulated as a concentrate in organic solvents. The concentrate can then be diluted to a lower concentration in an aqueous system, and can be sufficiently stable for the short period of time during dosing. Therefore in another aspect, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a non aqueous solution composed entirely of one or more organic solvents, which can be dosed as is or more commonly diluted with a suitable IV excipient (saline, dextrose; buffered or not buffered) before administration (Soiubilizing excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, 21(2), 2004, p201-230). Examples of solvents and surfactants are propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400, ethanol, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyi-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, Pharmasolve), Glycerin, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60 and polysorbate. Particular non aqueous solutions are composed of 70-80% propylene glycol, and 20-30% ethanol. One particular non aqueous solution is composed of 70% propylene glycol, and 30% ethanol. Another is 80% propylene glycol and 20% ethanol.Normally these solvents are used in combination and usually diluted at least 2-fold before IV bolus or IV infusion. The typical amounts for bolus IV formulations are -50% for Glycerin, propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400, and -20% for ethanol. The typical amounts for IV infusion formulations are -15% for Glycerin, 3% for DMA, and -10% for propylene glycol, PEG300, PEG400 and ethanol.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion. For intravenous administration, the solution can be dosed as is, or can be injected into an infusion bag (containing a pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipient, such as 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose), before administration.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, USA.<br>
 <br>
Thus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as com starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crossiinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.<br>
Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.<br>
The solid dosage forms (eg; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or urv-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit â¢ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.<br>
Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art<br>
Compositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.<br>
Examples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.<br>
 <br>
The compounds of the formula (I) will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation may contain from 1 nanogram to 2 grams of active ingredient, e.g. from 1 nanogram to 2 milligrams of active ingredient. Within this range, particular sub-ranges of compound are, or 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient (more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams), or 1 microgram to 20 milligrams (for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams, e.g. 0.1 milligrams to 2 milligrams of active ingredient).<br>
The active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect<br>
Where the compounds of the combination of the invention are presented together, they can be formulated together as tablets, capsules, solutions for infusion or injection or any of the other solid or liquid dosage forms described above. For example, where they are formulated together, they may be intimately mixed, or physically separated within the same formulation, for example by virtue of being present in different layers or granules within a tablet, or a separate beads or granules within a capsule. More typically, however, they are formulated separately for separate or concurrent administration.<br>
In one embodiment, the the individual components of the combination may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally under common outer packaging and optionally with instructions for their use.<br>
More commonly these days,, pharmaceutical formulations are prescribed to a patient in "patient packs* containing the whole course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physicians instructions.<br>
Accordingly, in a further embodiment, the invention provides a package containing separate dosage units, one or more of which contain a compound of the formula (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein, and one or more of which contain a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor. Dosage units containing a compound of the formula (0), (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein and a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor have suitable amounts of active ingredient as defined herein. A package contains enough tablets, capsules or the like to treat a patient for a pre-determined period of time, for instance for 2 weeks, 1 month or 3 months.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
It is envisaged that the combinations containing a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor and compounds of the formula (0) and sub-groups thereof such as formulae (lÂ°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (111), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein will be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by cyclin dependent kinases and/or GSKs (e.g. GSK-3). Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out herein.<br>
 <br>
The combinations are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.<br>
The compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a compound of the formula (I) may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic efiiects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.<br>
The compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner.<br>
The compounds of the combination can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3,4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods, e.g.1,2, 3,4, 5, 6,or 7 days, apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s). With sequential administration, the delay in administering the second (or additional) active ingredient should not be such as to lose the advantageous benefit of the efficacious effect of the combination of the active ingredients. In addition, the delay in administering the second (or additional) active ingredient is typically timed so as to allow for any adverse side effects of the first compound to subside to an acceptable level before adminstration of the second compound, whilst not losing the advantageous benefit of the efficacious effect of the combination of the active ingredients.<br>
The two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via the same or different routes.<br>
For example, one compound may be administered by the oral route and the other compound administered by parenteral administration such as administration by injection (e.g. i.v.) or infusion. In an alternative, both compounds may be administered by injection or infusion. In a further alternative, both compounds may be given orally. In one particular embodiment, the compound of the formula (I) is administered by injection or infusion and the cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor is adminstered orally.<br>

 <br>
Ultimately, however, the quantity of compound administered, the type of composition used, and the timing and frequency of the adinstration of the two components will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.<br>
Accordingly, a person skilled in the art would know through their common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use. It will be appreciated that the preferred method and order of administration and the respective dosage amounts and regimes for each component of the combination will depend on the particular cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor and compounds of formula (0), (1Â°), (I), (la), (lb), (II), (III), (IV), (IVa), (Va), (Vb), (Via), (Vlb), (VII) or (VIII) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein being administered, their route of administration, the particular tumour being treated and the particular host being treated. The optimum method and order of administration and dosage amounts and regime can be readily determined by those skilled in the art using conventional methods and in view of the information set out herein.<br>
As described infra, the compounds of the formula (I) are administered in combination therapy with one of more other cytotoxic compounds, for example in the treatment of a particular disease state (for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined). Examples of suitable cytotoxic compounds that may be used in the combinations of the invention are described in detail above.<br>

Particular examples of such agents include antiemetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (C1-4-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In other embodiments, the other therapeutic or prophylactic agents can be as described below.<br>
Other therapeutic or prophylactic agents<br>
The compositions may also include other therapeutic or prophylactic agents, for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (C1-4-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).<br>
Also included are agents that inhibit bone resorption such as bisphosphonate agents e.g. zoledronate, pamidronate and ibandronate, as well as agents that suppress inflammatory responses (such as dexamethazone, prednisone, and prednisolone). Also included are agents used to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I in acromegaly patients such as synthetic forms of the brain hormone somatostatin, which includes octreotide acetate which is a long-acting octapeptide with pharmacologic properties mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Further included are agents such as leucovorin, which is used as<br>
 <br>
an antidote to drugs that decrease levels of folic acid, or folinic acid it self, in one particular embodiment is the combination of 5FU and ieucovorin or 5FU and folinic acid, in addition megestrol acetate can be used for the treatment of side-effects including oedema and thromoembolic episodes.<br>
Therefore in one embodiment the combinations further include an additional agent selected from erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating fector (C1-4-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), zoledronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, dexamethazone, prednisone, prednisolone, Ieucovorin, folinic acid and megestrol acetate.<br>
In particular the combinations further include an additional agent selected from erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating fector (C1-4-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating fector (G-CSF), zoledronate, pamidronate, dexamethazone, prednisone, prednisolone, Ieucovorin, and folinic acid such as erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating fector (C1-4-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating fector (G-CSF).<br>
Zoledronic acid is available from Novartis under the Tradename ZometaÂ®. It is used in the treatment of bone metastasis in a variety of tumor types and for the treatment of hypercalcemia.<br>
Pamidronate disodium (APD) available from Novartis under the tradename Aredia is a bone-resorption inhibitor and is used in the treatment of moderate or severe hypercalcemia. Pamidronate disodium is for i.v. injection.<br>
Octreotide acetate is available from Novartis as Sandostatin LAR Â® (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) and SandostatinÂ® (octreotide acetate for injection ampuls or for vials). Octreotide is known chemically as L-Cysteinamide, l&gt;phenylalanyl-L-cysteinyl-L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-L-lysyl-L-threonyl-N-[2-hydroxy-l-(hydroxy-methyl) propyl]-, cyclic (2, 7)-disulfide; [R-(R*,R*)]. Synthetic forms of the brain hormone somatostatin, such as octreotide, work at the site of the tumour. They bind to sst-2/sst-5 receptors to regulate gastrointestinal hormone secretion and affect tumour growth.<br>
Each of the compounds present in the combinations of the invention may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.<br>
Thus, administration of the compound of the formula (I) in combination therapy with one or more cytotoxic compounds may comprise simultaneous or sequential administration. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).<br>
The combinations of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy, surgery and controlled diets.<br>
The combination therapy may therefore involve the formulation of the compound of the formula (I) with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (including at least one cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor). Such formulations can be, for example, a dosage form containing two, three, four or more<br>
 <br>
therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately ana presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.<br>
A person skilled in the art would know through their common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.<br>
Methods of Diagnosis<br>
Prior to administration of a compound of the formula (I), a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against cyclin dependent kinase(s) and/or GSK (e.g. GSK-3) or treatment with a cytotoxic compound or signalling inhibitor.<br>
For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to over-activation of CDKs or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal CDK activity. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation or sensitisation of the CDK2 signal include up-regulation of cyclin E, (Harwell RM, Mull BB, Porter DC, Keyomarsi K.; J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 26;279(13):12695-705) or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants (Rajagopalan H, Jallepalii PVt Rago C, Veicuiescu VE, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C; Nature. 2004 Mar 4;428(6978):77-81). The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or presence of CDC4 variants. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of CDC4. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of cyclin E, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins.<br>
Tumours with upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 may be particularly sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Tumours may preferentially be screened for upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27 prior to treatment. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27. The diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or urine.<br>
It has been found, Rajagopalan et al (Nature. 2004 Mar 4;428(6978):77-81), that there were mutations present in CDC4 (also known as Fbw7 or Archipelago) in human colorectal cancers and endometrial cancers (Spruck et al, Cancer Res. 2002 Aug 15;62(l6):4535-9). Identification of individual carrying a mutation in CDC4 may mean that the patient would be particularly suitable for treatment with a CDK inhibitor. Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a CDC4 variant prior to treatment. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody.<br>
 <br>
lethods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are known to a person skilled the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-anscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-srtu hybridisation.<br>
i screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA illowed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and Dnditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are arried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in lotecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., or Innis, MA et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods nd applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid jchniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3rd Ed, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold pring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche lotecuiar Bfochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States patents 4,666,828; ,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
in example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-srtu ybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152:649).<br>
Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) irehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce lonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure &gt;r tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fraC1-4ents not bound in the hybridization, and (5) letection of the hybridized nucleic acid fraC1-4ents. The probes used in such applications are typically labeled, Dr example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, rom about 50,100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with he target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc and :luorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of dancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine.<br>
Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of umour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtrter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-&gt;olyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will ecognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of upregulation of cyclin E, or loss of p21 or p27, or ietection of CDC4 variants could be applicable in the present case.<br>
Therefore all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with combinations of CDK inhibitors and cytotoxic compounds or signalling inhibitors. Patients with mantle cell ymphoma (MCL) could be selected for treatment with a CDK inhibitor using diagnostic tests outlined herein. vICL is a distinct clinicopathologic entity of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, characterized by proliferation of small to Ttedium-sized lymphocytes with co-expression of CD5 and CD20, an aggressive and incurable clinical course, and frequent t(11 ;14)(q13;q32) translocation. Over-expression of cyclin D1 mRNA, found in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), is a critical diagnostic marker. Yatabe et al (Blood. 2000 Apr 1;95(7):2253-61) proposed that<br>
 <br>
cydin D1-positivity should be included as one of the standard criteria for MCL, and that innovative therapies for this incurable disease should be explored on the basis of the new criteria. Jones et al (J Mol Diagn. 2004 May;6(2):84-9) developed a real-time, quantitative, reverse transcription PCR assay for cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression to aid in the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Howe et al (Clin Chem. 2004 Jan;50(1):80-7) used real-time quantitative RT-PCR to evaluate cyclin D1 mRNA expression and found that quantitative RT-PCR for cyclin D1 mRNA normalized to CD19 mRNA can be used in the diagnosis of MCL in blood, marrow, and tissue. Alternatively, patients with breast cancer could be selected for treatment with a CDK inhibitor using diagnostic tests outline above. Tumour cells commonly overexpress cyclin E and it has been shown that cyclin E is over-expressed in breast cancer (Harwell et al, Cancer Res, 2000,60, 481-489). Therefore breast cancer may in particular be treated with a CDK inhibitor.<br>

â¢	Methods:<br>
Prior to using preparative chromatography to isolate and purify the product compounds, analytical LC1-4S (see above) can first be used to determine the most appropriate conditions for preparative chromatography. A typical routine is to run an analytical LC1-4S using the type of chromatography (low or high pH) most suited for compound structure. Once the analytical trace shows good chromatography, a suitable preparative method of the same type can be chosen. Typical running condition for both low and high pH chromatography methods are:<br>
Flow rate: 24 ml/min<br>
Gradient: Generally all gradients have an initial 0.4 min step with 95% A + 5% B. Then according to analytical trace a 3.6 min gradient is chosen in order to achieve good separation (e.g. from 5% to 50% B for early retaining compounds; from 35% to 80% B for middle retaining compounds and so on)<br>
Wash: 1 minute wash step is performed at the end of the gradient<br>
Re-equilibration: A 2.1 minute re-equilibration step is carried out to prepare the system for the next run<br>
Make UP flow rate: 1 ml/min<br>

The reaction mixture was then heated to between 45 and 50 Â°C and the contents stirred until judged complete by 1H NMR. The contents were then cooled to between 16 and 25 Â°C and water (5.0 vol) was charged. Mixed heptanes (0.5 vol) were added, the contents were stirred for up to 10 minutes and the layers were separated. The aqueous phase was then extracted with tetrahydrofuran:mixed heptanes [(9:1), 3x 5.0 vol]. The organic phases were combined, washed with water (2.5 vol) and then concentrated under vacuum at 40 to 45 Â°C. The residue was azeotroped with toluene (3x 5.0 vol) and concentrated to dryness to yield the crude Stage 5 product<br>

Methanesulphonic acid (0.54 vol) was added over 30 to 60 minutes and the contents were then heated to 95 to 105 Â°C and stirred in this temperature range until the reaction was judged complete by 1H NMR. Once complete, the contents were cooled to between 20 and 30 Â°C and the resultant precipitate<br>
 <br>
collected by filtration. The filter-cake was washed with 2-propanol (2x 2.0 vol) and pulled dry on the filter for 3 to 24 hours to give crude 4-(2l6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate as a free-flowing off-white solid (80.0 to 120.0 %w/w, uncorrected for impurities or solutes).<br>

Stage 6a: Recrvstallisation of 4-(2.6-dichlorobenzovlaminoV1H-Dvra2ole-3-carboxvlic acid piperidin-4-vlamide methanesulphonate<br>
The product of Stage 6 was recrystallised to ensure that any residual levels of Boc-protected product of Stage 5 were no greater than 0.25%. Four batches of Stage 6 product were recrystallised using the following protocol.<br>
Crude Stage 6 product and 2-propanol (10.0 vol) were charged to a suitably sized flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel and thermometer. The contents were stirred under nitrogen and heated to between 75 and 85 Â°C. Water (up to 2.5 vol) was then charged to the contents until a clear solution was obtained. The contents were then cooled to between 40 and 60 Â°C and concentrated under vacuum at 40 to 50 Â°C until the reaction volume was reduced by approximately 50%. 2-Propanol (3.0 vol) was charged to the flask and the contents were concentrated at 40 to 50 Â°C until approximately 3.0 vol of solvent was removed. This process was then repeated twice more with 2-propanol (2x 3.0 vol) and the water content was checked. The resultant slurry was then cooled to between 0 and 5 Â°C and stirred at this temperature for 1 to 2 hours. The contents were filtered, the filter-cake was washed with 2-propanol (2x 1.0 vol) and then pulled dry on the filter for up to 24 hours. The solid was transferred to drying trays and dried under vacuum at 45 to 50 Â°C to constant weight to give 4-(2,6-dichloroben2oylamino)-1H-pyra2ole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate as an off-white solid (60.0 to 100.0% w/w).<br>
The recrystallisation yields for the four batches ranged between 85.6% and 90.4% and the purities of the recrystallised product ranged from 99.29% to 99.39%. A second recrystallisation increased the purity still further.<br>
The 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1 W-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate produced by this route had a melting point (by DSC) of 379.8 Â°C.<br>
Removal of residual Boc-protected product of Stage 5<br>
In some cases, when the methanesulphonate salt was dissolved in acetate buffer, a fine precipitate consisting of residual traces of the Boc-protected free base was observed. Several techniques may be used for removing or preventing the formation of the precipitate, as set out below.<br>

A mixture of the methanesulphonate salt in 200 mM acetate buffer was drawn from a vial into a 20 ml_ single-use syringe using a sterile needle, and a clinical grade 0.2 pm filter (a Sartorius Minisart sterile single use filter unit) was then attached to the syringe. The plunger of the syringe was slowly depressed and the filtrate collected in a clean, clear glass vial. The content of the vial was a clear, colourless solution of the methanesulphonate salt free of particulate matter.<br>
(b)	Heating in aqueous acid<br>
A mixture of the methanesulphonate salt and methanesulphonic acid (0.4 eq.) in water (10 vol) was heated at 100 Â°C for 4 hours, and then cooled to 60 Â°C. Analysis by TLC indicates that the methanesulphonate salt was present as a single component 2-Propanol (10 vol) was added and the mixture cooled to 40 Â°C. The mixture was reduced in vacuo to approximately 10 volumes, then a further portion of 2-propanol added (10 vol) and the mixture again reduced to 10 volumes. This cycle was repeated a further three times. The mixture was cooled in an ice-bath and the solid formed collected by filtration, washed with 2-propanol (5 vol) and dried in vacuo to give the methanesulphonate salt as a white to off-white solid.<br>
(c)	Organic-aqueous Extractions<br>
A mixture of the methanesulphonate salt and methanesulphonic acid (0.4 eq.) in water (10 vol) was heated at 100 Â°C for 3 hours, and then cooled to ambient temperature. To this mixture was added THF-heptane (9:1,10 vol) and the resultant mixture stirred vigorously to give a solution. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase washed with THF-heptane (9:1, 2 x 10 vol) then ethyl acetate (2x10 vol). To the aqueous phase was added 2-propanol (10 vol) and the solution was reduced in vacuo to approximately 5 volumes, then a further portion of 2-propanol added (10 vol) and the mixture again reduced to 5 volumes. This cycle was repeated a further three times. The solid formed was collected by filtration, washed with 2-propanol (5 vol) and dried in vacuo to give the methanesulphonate salt as a white to off-white solid.<br>
(d)	Chromatography<br>
The use of chromatographic techniques may provide a route for removing non-polar impurities from the methanesulphonate salt It is envisaged that the use of reverse-phase methods will be particularly useful.<br>

Human colon carcinoma cell line HT29 (ECACC No. 91072201) cells were seeded onto 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 5x103 cells/well. Cells were allowed to recover overnight prior to addition of compound(s) or vehicle control (0.2% DMSO) as follows;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
j)     Concurrent for 72 hours.<br>
k)    Compound I for 24 hours followed by etoposide for 48 hours.<br>
I)     Etoposide for 24 hours followed by Compound I for 48 hours.<br>
Following a total of 72 hours compound incubation, Alamar Blueâ¢ was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 6 hours. Fluorescent product was quantified by reading at d535/25x (excitation) and d590/20m (emission) on a Fusion Reader (Perkin Elmer). The IC50 for etoposide in the presence of varying doses of Compound I was determined. Synergy was determined when the IC50 shifted down in the presence of sub-effective doses of Compound I. Additivtty was determined when the response to etoposide and Compound I together resulted in an effect equivalent to the sum of the two compounds individually. Antagonistic effects were defined as those causing the IC50 to shift upwards, i.e. those where the response to the two compounds was less than the sum of the effect of the two compounds individually.<br>
Combinations of Compound I and Etoposide were shown to be additive in the IC50 shift assay performed in A2780 cells. This effect was observed when compounds were added concurrently for 72h or when Etoposide was added for 24h followed by compound I for a further 48h. The data obtained are summarised below in Figures 17 and 18 using the example of the IC50 response curves to Etoposide in the presence and absence of 0.075fiM Compound I when added concurrently.PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS EXAMPLE 259<br>

EXAMPLE 256<br>
Determination of the crystal structure of 442.6-dichlorobenzovlamino)-1 H-pvrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-vlamide methanesulphonate by X-ray diffraction<br>
The compound 4-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-4-ylamide methanesulphonate was prepared as described in Example 1. The crystal used for the diffraction experiment was a colourless plate with dimensions 0.05 x 0.08 x 0.14 mm3 obtained by precipitation from a water solution by 2-propanol. Crystallographic data were collected at 93 K using CuKa radiation (A = 1.5418 A) from a Rigaku rotating anode RU3HR, Osmic blue confocal optiC1-4and a Rigaku Jupiter CCD detector. Images were collected in two u&gt; scans at 28=15 and 90Â° with a detector to crystal distance of 67 mm. Data collection was controlled by CrystalClear software and images were processed and scaled by Dtrek. Due to a high absorption coefficient (u=4.01 mm'1) data had to be corrected using 4th order Fourier absorption correction. It was found that the crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group Pbca (# 61) with crystal lattice parameters at 93 K a=8.90(10), 6=12.44(10), c=38.49(4) A, a = p = y = 90Â°. The numbers in brackets represents the deviation (s.u., standard uncertainty).<br>
The crystals described above and the crystal structure form a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The crystal structure was solved using direct methods implemented in SHELXS-97. Intensity data for a total of 2710 unique reflections in a resolution range from 20-0.9 A (2.32o(i)) and goodness of fit S=1.264.<br>
One molecule of protonated free base and one mesylate anion were found in the asymmetric unit. The elemental composition of the asymmetric unit was C17H21CI2N5O5S and the calculated density of the crystals is<br>
 <br>
1.49 Mg/m3. Hydrogen atoms were generated on geometrical grounds while the location of heteroatom bound hydrogen atoms was confirmed by inspection of Fo-Fc difference maps. The positional and thermal parameters of hydrogen atoms were constricted to ride on corresponding non-hydrogen atoms. The thermal motion of non-hydrogen atoms was modelled by anisotropical thermal factors (see Figure 19).<br>
The crystal structure contains one intramolecular (N15H...07 2.690 A) and five intermolecular hydrogen bonds (see packing figure Figure 20). Three of them link the protonated piperidine nitrogen with two mesylate anions. The first mesylate anion is linked through a single H-bond N12H12A. 02M 2.771 A, while the second is involved in a bifurcated H-bond with interactions N12H12B .01M 2.864 A and N12H12B...02M 3.057 A. The remaining mesylate oxygen 03M is involved in a hydrogen bond N8H8...03M 2.928 A. Neighbouring protonated free base molecules are linked together by a H-bond N15H15...07 2.876 A, as well as by relatively long contact N15H15...N2 3.562 A and stacking of phenyl and pyrazole rings. These interactions are propagated infinitely along the b axis. Crystal packing contains 2D layers (in the ab plane) of mesylate anions sandwiched by an extensive network of charged H-bonds with two layers of protonated free base cations. The compact 2D sandwich layers are joined together along the c axis by stacking of phenyl rings and involving chlorine...phenyl interaction with CI2...C18 3.341 A.<br>
A graphical representation of the structure generated by the X-ray diffraction study is provided in Figure 20.<br>
