TORQUE BASED AIR PER CYLINDER AND<br>
VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY DETERMINATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/861,494, filed on November 28, 2006. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to engines, and more particularly<br>
to torque-based control of an engine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines combust an air and fuel mixture<br>
within cylinders to drive pistons, which produces drive torque. Air flow into the<br>
engine is regulated via a throttle. More specifically, the throttle adjusts throttle<br>
area, which increases or decreases air flow into the engine. As the throttle area<br>
increases, the air flow into the engine increases. A fuel control system adjusts<br>
the rate that fuel is injected to provide a desired air/fuel mixture to the cylinders.<br>
As can be appreciated, increasing the air and fuel to the cylinders increases the<br>
torque output of the engine.<br>
[0004] Engine control systems have been developed to accurately<br>
control engine speed output to achieve a desired engine speed. Traditional<br>
engine control systems, however, do not control the engine speed as accurately<br>
as desired. Further, traditional engine control systems do not provide as rapid of<br>
a response to control signals as is desired or coordinate engine torque control<br>
among various devices that affect engine torque output.<br><br>
GP-308406-PTE-CD<br>

SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
regulating operation of an internal combustion engine. The method includes<br>
monitoring a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) of the engine, determining an<br>
engine torque based on the MAP, estimating an air per cylinder (APC) based on<br>
the torque, determining a volumetric efficiency of the engine based on the APC<br>
and regulating operation of the engine based on the volumetric efficiency.<br>
[0006] In another feature, operation of the engine is further regulated<br>
based on the APC.<br>
[0007] In other features, the method further includes determining a<br>
correction factor based on an actual APC and correcting the APC based on the<br>
correction factor. Furthermore, the method further includes determining whether<br>
the engine is operating in steady-state. The step of correcting the APC is<br>
executed when the engine is operating in steady-state.<br>
[0008] In another feature, the method further includes monitoring an<br>
intake air temperature. The volumetric efficiency is further based on the MAP<br>
and the intake air temperature.<br>
[0009] In still another feature, the step of determining an engine torque<br>
includes processing the MAP through a MAP-based torque model.<br>
[0010] In yet another feature, the step of estimating an APC includes<br>
processing the engine torque through an inverted APC-based torque model.<br>
[0011] Further advantages and areas of applicability of the present<br>
disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description provided<br>
hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific<br>
examples, while indicating an embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012] The present disclosure will become more fully understood from<br>
the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0013] Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary engine<br>
system according to the present disclosure;<br>
[0014] Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating steps executed by the torque-<br>
based volumetric efficiency (VE) and air per cylinder (APC) determination control<br>
of the present disclosure; and<br>
[0015] Figure 3 is a block diagram illustrating modules that execute the<br>
torque-based VE and APC determination control of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide<br>
the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake manifold 14 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 18. Although a single cylinder 18 is illustrated, it can be<br>
appreciated that the coordinated torque control system of the present invention<br>
can be implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders including, but not<br>
limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders.<br><br>
GP-308406-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
[0018] A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel that is combined with the<br>
air as it is drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. The fuel injector may<br>
be an injector associated with an electronic or mechanical fuel injection system<br>
20, a jet or port of a carburetor or another system for mixing fuel with intake air.<br>
The fuel injector is controlled to provide a desired air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio within<br>
each cylinder 18.<br>
[0019] An intake valve 22 selectively opens and closes to enable the<br>
air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 18. The intake valve position is regulated by<br>
an intake cam shaft 24. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture<br>
within the cylinder 18. A spark plug 26 initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture,<br>
which drives the piston in the cylinder 18. The piston, in turn, drives a crankshaft<br>
(not shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 18<br>
is forced out an exhaust port when an exhaust valve 28 is in an open position.<br>
The exhaust valve position is regulated by an exhaust cam shaft 30. The<br>
exhaust is treated in an exhaust system and is released to atmosphere. Although<br>
single intake and exhaust valves 22,28 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that<br>
the engine 12 can include multiple intake and exhaust valves 22,28 per cylinder<br>
18.<br>
[0020] The engine system 10 can include an intake cam phaser 32 and<br>
an exhaust cam phaser 34 that respectively regulate the rotational timing of the<br>
intake and exhaust cam shafts 24,30. More specifically, the timing or phase<br>
angle of the respective intake and exhaust cam shafts 24,30 can be retarded or<br>
advanced with respect to each other or with respect to a location of the piston<br>
within the cylinder 18 or crankshaft position. In this manner, the position of the<br>
intake and exhaust valves 22,28 can be regulated with respect to each other or<br>
with respect to a location of the piston within the cylinder 18. By regulating the<br>
position of the intake valve 22 and the exhaust valve 28, the quantity of air/fuel<br>
mixture ingested into the cylinder 18 and therefore the engine torque is regulated.<br><br>
GP-308406-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
[0021] The engine system 10 can also include an exhaust gas<br>
recirculation (EGR) system 36. The EGR system 36 includes an EGR valve 38<br>
that regulates exhaust flow back into the intake manifold 14. The EGR system is<br>
generally implemented to regulate emissions. However, the mass of exhaust air<br>
that is circulated back into the intake manifold 14 also affects engine torque<br>
output.<br>
[0022] A control module 40 operates the engine based on the torque-<br>
based engine control of the present disclosure. More specifically, the control<br>
module 40 generates a throttle control signal and a spark advance control signal<br>
based on a desired engine speed (RPMDES). A throttle position signal generated<br>
by a throttle position sensor (TPS) 42. An operator input 43, such as an<br>
accelerator pedal, generates an operator input signal. The control module 40<br>
commands the throttle 16 to a steady-state position to achieve a desired throttle<br>
area (ATHRDES) and commands the spark timing to achieve a desired spark timing<br>
(SDES). A throttle actuator (not shown) adjusts the throttle position based on the<br>
throttle control signal.<br>
[0023] An intake air temperature (IAT) sensor 44 is responsive to a<br>
temperature of the intake air flow and generates an intake air temperature (IAT)<br>
signal. A mass airflow (MAF) sensor 46 is responsive to the mass of the intake<br>
air flow and generates a MAF signal. A manifold absolute pressure (MAP)<br>
sensor 48 is responsive to the pressure within the intake manifold 14 and<br>
generates a MAP signal. An engine coolant temperature sensor 50 is responsive<br>
to a coolant temperature and generates an engine temperature signal. An engine<br>
speed sensor 52 is responsive to a rotational speed (i.e., RPM) of the engine 12<br>
and generates in an engine speed signal. Each of the signals generated by the<br>
sensors is received by the control module 40.<br>
[0024] The engine system 10 can also include a turbo or supercharger<br>
54 that is driven by the engine 12 or engine exhaust. The turbo 54 compresses<br>
air drawn in from the intake manifold 14. More particularly, air is drawn into an<br>
intermediate chamber of the turbo 54. The air in the intermediate chamber is<br>
drawn into a compressor (not shown) and is compressed therein. The<br><br>
GP-308406-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
compressed air flows back to the intake manifold 14 through a conduit 56 for<br>
combustion in the cylinders 18. A bypass valve 58 is disposed within the conduit<br>
56 and regulates the flow of compressed air back into the intake manifold 14.<br>
[0025] The torque-based VE and APC determination control of the<br>
present disclosure determines an estimated air-per-cylinder (APCEST) and a<br>
volumetric efficiency (VE) of the engine based on the measured or actual MAP<br>
(MAPACT). More specifically, a MAP-based torque model is implemented to<br>
determine a MAP-based torque (TMAP) and is described in the following<br>
relationship:<br><br>
where:	S is the spark timing;<br>
I is the intake cam phase angle;<br>
E is the exhaust cam phase angle;<br>
B is the barometric pressure; and<br>
η is a thermal efficiency factor that is determined based on IAT.<br>
The coefficients ap are predetermined values. An APC-based torque model can<br>
be used to determine an APC-based torque (TAPC) and is described in the<br>
following relationship:<br><br>
The coefficients aA are predetermined values. Because TMAP is equal to TAPC, the<br>
APC-based torque model can be inverted to calculate APCEST based on MAPACT,<br>
in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br>
[0026] If the engine is operating at steady-state, APCEST is corrected<br>
based on a measured or actual APC (APCACT) to provide a corrected APCEST.<br>
APCEST is corrected in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br><br>
GP-308406-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
kI is a pre-determined corrector coefficient. MAPACT is monitored to determine<br>
whether the engine is operating at steady-state. For example, if the difference<br>
between a current MAPACT and a previously recorded MAPACT is less than a<br>
threshold difference, the engine is operating at steady-state. VE is subsequently<br>
determined based on APCEST in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br>
k is a coefficient that is determined based on IAT using, for example, a pre-stored<br>
look-up table. The engine is then operated based on VE and APCEST.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
torque-based VE and APC determination control will be described in detail. In<br>
step 200, control determines whether the engine is running. If the engine is not<br>
running, control ends. If the engine is running, control monitors MAP in step 202.<br>
In step 204, control determines TMAP using the MAP-based torque model, as<br>
described in detail above. Control determines APCEST based on TMAP using the<br>
inverse APC torque model, as described in detail above.<br>
[0028] Control determines whether the engine is operating in steady-<br>
state in step 208. If the engine is operating in steady-state, control continues in<br>
step 210. If the engine is not operating in steady-state, control continues in step<br>
212. In step 210, control corrects APCEST based on APCACT, as described in<br>
detail above. Control determines VE based on APCEST, MAP and IAT in step<br>
212, as described in detail above. In step 214, control regulates engine operation<br>
based on VE and APCEST and control ends.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
torque-based VE and APC determination control will be described in detail. The<br>
exemplary modules include a MAP-based torque model module 300, an inverse<br>
APC-based torque model module 304, a corrector module 304, a steady-state<br>
determining module 306, a summer module 308, a VE module 310 and an engine<br>
control module (ECM) 314. The MAP-based torque model module 300<br>
determines TMAP using the MAP-based torque model described above. The<br><br>
GP-308406-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
inverse APC-based torque model module 302 determines APCEST using the<br>
inverse APC-based torque model.<br>
[0030] The corrector module 304 determines APCCORR based on<br>
APCEST, APCACT and a signal from the steady-state determining module 306.<br>
More specifically, the steady-state determining module 306 determines whether<br>
the engine is operating in steady-state based on MAPACT. If the engine is<br>
operating in steady-state, a correction factor is output by the corrector module<br>
304. If the engine is not operating in steady-state, the correction factor is set<br>
equal to zero. The summer module 308 sums APCEST and the correction factor<br>
to provide a corrected APCEST. The VE module 310 determines VE based on<br>
APCEST, MAPACT and IAT, as described in detail above. The ECM 314 generates<br>
engine control signals based on APCEST and VE to regulate engine operation.<br>
[0031] The torque-based VE and APC determination control enables<br>
both VE and APC values to be determined from a known data set. The data set<br>
is generated during the course of engine development using a tool such as<br>
DYNA-AIR. Because these values can be determined from known values, the<br>
amount of dynamometer time is reduced, because the VE and APC values do not<br>
need to be determined while the engine is running on a dynamometer during<br>
engine development. This contributes to reducing the overall time and cost of<br>
engine development. Furthermore, the torque-based VE and APC determination<br>
control provides an automated process for estimating the VE and APC values.<br>
[0032] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
