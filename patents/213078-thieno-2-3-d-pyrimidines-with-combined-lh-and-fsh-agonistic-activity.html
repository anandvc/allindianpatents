Thieno[2,3-^pyrimidines with combined LH and FSH agonistic<br>
activity<br>
The invention relates to compounds having glycoprotein honnone agonistic activity, in particular to compounds having both Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) agonistic activity. The invention furthermore relates to pharaiaceutical'compositions containmg tlie same as well as to tlie use of these compounds in medical therapy, particulai'ly for use as a control of fertility.<br>
Gonadotropins serve important functions in a variety of bodily functions including metabolism, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. The hypophyseal gonadotropins FSH and LH for example play a pivotal role in the stimulation of folhcle development and maturation whereas LH is involved in induction of the o^allatory process (Sharp, R.M. Clin. Endocrinol 33, 787-807, 1990; Dorrington and Amist'ong, Recent Prog. Horm. Res 35, 301-342, 1979; Levy et al. Human Reproduction 15, 2258-2265, 2000).<br>
Currently, LH is, appUed clinically, in combination with FSH, for ovarian stimulation i.e. ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and induction of ovulation in infertile anovulatory women (Insler, V., Int. J. Fertility 33^, 85-97, 1988, Navot and Rosenwaks, J. Vitro Fert. Embr)'o Transfer 5, 3-13, 1988), as well as for male hypogonadism and male infertility.<br>
Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The actions of these pituitary and placental hormones are mediated by specific plasma membrane receptors that are members of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors. They consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and ai-e able to interact with the Gs protein, leadiiag to the activation of adenyl cyclase.<br>
Gonadotropins destined for therapeutic purposes can be isolated from human urine sources and are of low purity (Morse et al, Amer. J. Reproduct. Innnunol. and Microbiology 17, 143, 1988). Alternatively, they can be prepared as recombinant gonadotropins. In addition to these proteins, gonadotropin receptors can be activated or deactivated by synthetic low molecular weight compounds. BicycUc heteroaromatic<br><br>
compounds have been described in WO 00/61586. By^in vitro and in vivo experiments they are shown to be useful as LH agonists.<br>
In normal females the release of pituitary LH and FSH is characterized by a mid-cycle surge which precedes the ovulation. Ovulation is characterized by tluee distinct physiological phenomena i.e, oocj^e maturation, follicular rupture, and luteinization. Wliile the role of the LH-surge in tlie in vivo induction of these phenomena is undisputed^ the role of the FSH-surge is less clear. However, it has been shown recently that FSH induces oocyte maturation in vitro by inducing cumulus cells to produce a factor that positively overcomes hypoxanthine induced meiotic airest (Lu et al, Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 164, 191-196, 2000), This factor is tliought to be a meiosis activating sterol (^^AS).<br>
In ovulation induction, it is desirable to provide the effects of LH as the major component. According to the present invention compounds have been, found with particular advantageous properties when used in protocols for enhanced fertility. In these compounds LH activity is accompanied by a FSH activity.<br>
Thus the present invention provides low molecular weight compounds that in addition to LH activity unexpectedly also have FSH activity. In general these compounds are tliieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines wliich at the 4-position of the pyrimidine ring are substituted by a phenyl group wliich in turn is substituted at the meta position.<br>
The present invention resides in thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives according to general formula I,<br><br>
(Fonnula I)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein N(R1)R2 are joined in a (2-6C)heterocycloalkyI ring.<br><br>
The most preferred compounds are tert-butyl 5-aniino-2-methyltliio-4-(3-(2-(azetidm-l-yl)-acetamido)-phenyl)-tliieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide; tert-butyl 5-amino-2-methyltliio-4-(3-(2-(morpholin-4-yl)-acetamido)-phenyl)-tIiieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide; tert-butyl 5-amino-2-metliylthio-4-(3-(2-(thiomorpholin-4-yl)-acetamido)-phenyl)-tliieiio[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide; tert-butyl 5-amino-2-methylthio-4-(3-(2-(piperidin-l-yl)-acetamido)-phenyl)-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide; teit-butyl 5-amino-2-methylthio-4-(3-(2-(pyxTolidin-l-yl)-acetamido)-phenyl)-thieno[253-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxamide and tert-butyl 5-amino-2-niethylthio-4-(3-(2-(piperazin-l-yl)-acetamido)-pheayl)-tlaieno[253-d]pyrimidme-6-carboxaniide.<br>
The term joined in a (2-6C)heterocycloallcyl ring in the definition of Formula I, means that Rl and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded fonn a ring having 2-6 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, 0 and/or S. Examples of such rings are azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine and thiomoipholine.<br>
It has been shown that compounds of the above mentioned formula I show agonistic LH and FSH activity. In an in vzr7-o bioassay using CHO cells stably transfected with the human LH or FSH receptor, respectively, the EC50 with regard to the LH receptor was found to be less than 5.10"^ M whereas with regard to the FSH receptor the EC50 was less than lO'^M. Typically the FSH activity ranges from an activity of about 1% of the LH agonist stimulation to about 10% of the LH agonist stimulation.<br>
The invention further resides in a pharaiaceutical composition comprising a thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivative compound or salts thereof having the general foimula I.<br>
Thus, the compounds according to tlT« inveiition can be used in tlierapy. A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of a thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine compound having the general fonnula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the control of fertility, more preferably induction of ovulation. The present compounds ai-e used to activate both tlie LH and FSH receptors. The compound of the present invention can be used tlierefore in a method to treat females with fertility problems.<br><br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula I ai'e those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, acid addition salts of bases according to formula I, niay also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharaiaceutically acceptable or not, are included witliin the ambit of the present invention.<br>
Examples of acid addition salts include those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, and organic acids like citric acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, nialeic acid, malonic acid, fumaric acid, glycohc acid, succinic acid, and the like.<br>
Suitable administration routes for the compounds of formula Lor phamiaceutically acceptable salts thereof, also referred to herein as the active mgredient are intramuscular injections, subcutaneous injections, intravenous injections or intraperitoneal injections, oral and intranasal administration. Preferably, the compounds may be administered orally. The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, will necessarily be dependent upon tlie therapeutic effect to be achieved (treatment of infertility; contraception), and may vary witli the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general, parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other metliods of administration which are more dependent upon adsorption. However, -a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001-25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals tloroughout the day. In case of female recipients, doses may be administered at appropriate daily intervals tln'oughout the menstrual cycle for follicular support or as a single dose for ovulation induction. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.<br>
In case of in vitro or ex vivo applications, like in R-^F applications, the compounds of the inventions are to be used in the mcubation media in a concentration of approximately 0.01-5 )ag/ ml.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to phamiaceutical compositions comprising a  tliieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine  compound  according  to   formula  I  in  admixture  \yith<br><br>
pharraaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, and optionally other therapeutic agents. The<br>
auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the otlier<br>
ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal nasal, topical (including transdermal, buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration. The compositions may be prepared by any method well known in the ait of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro et aL, Remington's Phaimaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture).<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing in association the active ingredient witli any auxilliary agent. The auxiUiaiy agent(s), also named accessory ingredients, include those conventional in the art (Gennaro, supra), such as, fillers, binders, diluents, disintegrants, lubricants, colorants, flavoring agents and wetting agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules, or as a powder or granules, or as a solution or suspension. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus or paste. The compositions can further be processed into a suppository or enema for rectal administration.<br>
For parenteral administration, suitable compositions include aqueous and non¬aqueous sterile injection. The compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed vials and ampoules, and may be stored in a freeze-dided (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid canier, for example, water prior to use.<br>
Compositions, or fonnulations, suitable for administration by nasal inlaalation include fine dusts or mists which may be generated by means of metered dose pressurized aerosols, nebuhsers or insufflators.<br>
The thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds of the invention can also be administered in the form of implantable phannaceutical' devices, consisting of a core of active material, encased by a release rate-regulating membrane. Such implants are J:o be applied subcutaneously or locally, and will release the active ingi*edient at an approximately constant rate over relatively -large periods of time, for instance from<br><br>
r<br>
weeks to years. Methods for the preparation of implantable pharmaceutical devices as such are known in the art, for example as described in European Patent 0,303,306 (AKZO N. v.).<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the present invention can be used for the same clinical purposes as the native LH, with the advantage that they possess FSH activity, display altered stability properties and can be administered differently.<br>
The compounds of the present invention, represented by fomiula (I) can generally be prepared by nucleophilic substitution of halides (II) wherein Q = CI or Br Avith (cyclic) secondary amines of formula (III) in an appropriate solvent such as N,N-dmiethylformamide or THF at room temperature in the presence of a tertiaiy base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA).<br><br><br><br>

Methods to deteiTnine receptor binding as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to detemiine biological activity of gonadotropins are well known. In general, expressed receptor is contacted witli the compound to be tested and binding or stimulation or inlaibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response isolated DNA encoding the LH or the FSH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Cliinese Hamster Ovai-y cell, but other cells are also suitable.<br><br>
Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin (Jia et al, Mol.Endocrin., 5^, 759-776, 1991).<br>
Methods to construct recombinant LH or FSH expressing cell lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Hai-bor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor is attained by expression of the DNA encoding die desired protein. Teclmiques for site * directed mutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and constmction of -suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in tlie art. Portions or all of the DNA encoding the desired protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided to tlie DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems ai'e now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells expressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inliibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively isolated cell membranes containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of compound.<br>
For measurement of binding radioactively or fluorescently labeled compounds may be used. As reference compound human recombinant LH or FSH can be used. In the alternative also competition binding assays can be performed.<br>
Another assay involves screening for LH or FSH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of receptor mediated cAMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expression of the receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The amount of cAMP is than measured. The level of cAMP will be reduced or increased, depending on the inhibitory or stimulating effect of tlie test compound upon binding to the receptor.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which responds to tlie level of cAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or might be constmcted in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP respo);isive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response<br><br>
element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, Ch, Hinimler, A and Czemilofsky, A.P., Curr.Opm.Bioteclmol.6, 574 (1995).<br>
For selecting active compounds on the LH or FSH receptor, testing at lO'VM must result in an activity of more than 20% of the maximal activity when LH or FSH is used as a reference. Another criterion might be the EC50 value, wliich must be 
The skilled artisan will recognize that desirable EC50 values are dependent on tlie compound tested. For example, a compound with an EC50, wliich is less than 10-5 M is generally, considered a candidate for drug selection. Preferably this value is lower than 10'^ M. However, a compound wliich has a higher EC50, but is selective for the particular receptor, may be even a better candidate.<br>
Screening for LH receptor agonistic compomids can also be perfomied by using a mouse Leydig cell bioassay (Van Damme, M., Robersen, D. and Diczfalusy, E., Acta Endocrinol. 77: 655-671 (1974), Mannaerts, B., Kloosterboer, H. and Scliuurs, A., Neuroendocrinology of reproduction. R. RoUand et al. Eds., Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., 49-58 (1987)). In this assay, stimulation of LH receptor mediated testosterone production can be measured in Leydig cells isolated from male mice.<br>
FSH agonistic activity of compounds can also be determined in an ex vivo model using cultured mouse follicles according to Nayudu, P. and Osbom, S. (J. Reproduction and Fertility 95, 349-362 (1992)). Therefore, mouse ovarian folUcles are isolated and cultured in tlie presence of FSH agonistic compounds to induce foUiculai- growth. Measurements of follicular diameter and estradiol in the culture medium are indicative for follicular growth.<br>
To measure LH in vivo activity of compounds, ovulation induction in immature mice can be studied. In this assay immature female mice are primed with urinai-y FSH and approximately 48 hours later treated with a LH agonistic compound. The animals ai-e killed after LH agonist treatment and the number of ova in the oviduct is microscopically assessed.<br>
To measure FSH in vivo activity of compounds immature female rats are treated at 0, 8, 24 and 32 hours with a FSH agonistic compound to induce foUicular growth. At 52 hours after the start of the expeiiment the animals are injected with liCG to induce ovulation. The animals are killed 72 hours after the start of the experiment and^the<br><br>
number of ova in the oviduct is microscopically assessed. In addition ovarian weight is determined.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be applied' clinically in tliose regimens where now LH or hCG is used. These include LH substitution among subjects with h3'pogonadaI hypogonadism either male or female, midcycle administration to induce ovulation (ovulation induction (01) or controlled hyperstimulation (COH) or stimulation of the corpus luteum.<br>

Example 7<br>
CHO-LH and CHO-FSH in vitro bioactivity<br>
LH agonistic activity of compounds were tested in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the human receptor and cotransfected with a cAMP responsive element (CRE) / promoter directing the expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Binding of ligand to the Gs-coupled LH receptor will result in an increase of cAMP, which in turn will induce an increased transactivation of the luciferase reporter construct. The luciferase signal was quantified using a luminescence counter. For test compounds, EC50 values (concentration of test compound causing half-maxmial (5Q %)<br><br>
stimulation) were calculated. For that purpose the software program GrapliPad PRISM, version 3.0 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego) was used.<br>
In a similar way FSH agonistic activity, of compounds was tested in CHO cells transfected with the luciferase reporter gene and the human FSH receptor. Results are shown in Table 1.<br>
In vivo bioactivity<br>
To measui'e in vivo activity of LH/FSH receptor agonistic compounds ovulation induction in immature mice was studied. In tliis assay unmature female mice were primed with urinary FSH (Humegon 12.5 KJ/animal). Approximatel}^ 48 hours later the animals were treated with a LH /FSH agonistic compound at a dose-level of 50 mg/kg. The animals were killed 24 hours after LH/FSH agonist treatment and the number of ova in the oviduct was microscopically assessed. Results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
