				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel N , N -diglycosylated diaminoalcohols useful as antitubercular agents. More particularly the present invention relates to the novel N', N~-diglycosylated diaminoalcohols. These compounds are useful in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis.<br><br><br>
Despite the availability of effective and short course chemotherapy and BCG vaccine the tubercular baccilus continues to claim more lives than any other single infectious agent. A number of substances other than the antibiotics have been proposed heretofore for use in treating tubercular and fungal infections, but they have not been used extensively for a number of reasons. Among them the increased incidence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis, its deadly synergy with human immunodeficiency virus and susceptibility to fungal infections in tuberculosis and resistance to existing antifungals are the prominent ones. Many potentially effective antitubercular and antifungal agents are toxic and cannot be safely administered to patients and still some of them have undesirable side effects. As a result of the foregoing and other deficiencies, it is apparent that the development of new class of nontoxic mechanism based broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents has not been available for treating the tubercular and fungal infections.<br>
 Ethambutol an amino alcohol is clinically used antitubercular drug but it is associated with many drawbacks and resistant cases against this drug are also appearing. It has been discovered that certain glycosylated amino acids are associated with a number of biological activities as these provide important biological signals to the cells in order to combat the adverse conditions (Varki A., Glycobiology (1993), 3, 97 &amp; Drickamen, K. In molecular glycobiology Flukada, M., Hindsgaul. 0., Eds IRL, Oxford 1994, Ch2, pp53-87). Further sugar derivatives are known to offer better pharmacokinetic parameter to the <br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
drugs and at the same time they are less toxic in comparison to other class of compounds [J.F.Fisher, Harrison, A.W., Bundy G.L., K.F. Willinkson, Rush B.D., Ruwart M.J., J. Med. Chem (1991, 34, 3410 &amp; Negre E., Driaf K.P., Veraneuil B, Tetrahedron Lett ~(1~93), 34, 1027]. Thoxyl, a thiourea derivative, an antitbercular compound is associated many drawbacks. Further, glycoconjugates are known to be superior ligands with higher affinity than a natural carbohydrate ligand [P. M. St. Hilaire and M. Meldal Angew.<br><br>
Chem. mt. Ed (2000, 39, 1162)].<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel N , N -<br><br>
diglycosylated diaminoalcohols useful as antitubercular agents. More particularly the present invention relates to the novel N', N~-diglycosylated diaminoalcohols. These compounds are useful in the treatment of tubercular infections.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel N', N~-diglycosylated diaminoalcohols of the general formula 2 (Figure- 1).<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide compounds of formula 2, useful in the treatment of tubercular infections.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation novel ',N~diglycosylated diaminoalcohols of the general formula 2,<br><br>
wherein R, is selected from 1-4 carbon atom alkyl chain and aralkyl group, X is selected from the group consisting of 1-16 carbon, branched or unbranched alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl and aryl and substituted or unsubstituted diureidyl aryl, useful as antitubercular agent which comprises reducing glcosyl amino ester of formula 1, wherein R1 is selected from group consisting of 1-4 carbon atom alkyl chain and aralkyl group, R is 1-4 carbon atom alkyl chain , X is selected from the group consisting of 1-16<br><br>
carbon, branched or unbranched alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted<br>
or unsubstituted diureidyl aryl with a reducing agent in an organic solvent at a<br>
temperature in the range of 0-25 0C in an inert atmosphere, filtering the above said<br><br>
reaction mixture to obtain the solid cake mass followed purification by known methods to obtain the ct. In an embodiment of the present invention the sugar used is selected from the group consisting of xylofuranose, arabinose, mannose and galactose.<br>

For MABA assay M tuberculosis H37Ra was used as a suitable surrogate for the virulent 1137 Rv strain. 7-8 days old cultures were diluted in liquid medium to provide an optimal density of 0.02 at 550 nm spectrophotometrically which gave colour change of Alamar blue 'oxidation reduction' dye (blue to pink). The standard antitubercular agents Rifamycin, isoniazid, p-aminosalicylic acid, ethambutol and ethionamide were taken as positive controls. (Collins, L.A.; Franzblan, S.G.; Antimicrob.
