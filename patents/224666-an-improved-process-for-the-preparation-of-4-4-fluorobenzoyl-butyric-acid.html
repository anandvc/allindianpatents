				<td>INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 4-(4-fluorobenzoyi)butyric acid. The 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)butyric acid has the formula-l given be10w.<br><br>
The 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)butyric acid has the formula-I is a key raw material for the synthesis of anti-hyperlipoproteinemetic drug ezetimibe (US 5767115, Schering). The main criticality in making the compound of formula-I lies in controlling the desfluoro ana10gue impurity (4-benzoylbutyric acid) at an acceptable level (
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the literature only two procedures are known for the preparation of compound of formula-I. In the first procedure reported by Compernolle (Tetrahedron, 49, 3193, 1993) fluorobenzene is reacted with glutaric anhydride under Friedel-Crafts conditions using aluminium ch10ride at 0°C to get the compound of formula-I in 78% yield. The reaction is done in methylene ch10ride medium. In this procedure reaction was done on a 15gr glutaric anhydride scale. The quality of final product with respect to impurities is not addressed in this reference. The main drawbacks in this procedure are:<br>
1.   Temperature of the reaction (0°C) is not suitable for scale up operations. At 0°C aluminum ch10ride-glutaric anhydrde complex is not soluble in the medium and a<br><br>
thick mass (difficult to stir by mechanical stirrer) will form. Because of improper mixing quality and yield of the product is 10w.<br>
2.	Quenching of Friedel-Crafts reaction by adding water or acid to the reaction mass is difficult on a larger scale.<br>
3.	Quality of fluorobenzene used in the process is not mentioned. This is very critical to get an acceptable quality of compound of formula-I with respect to desfluoro ana10gue impurity.<br>
In the second route (US patent, 6,207,822) for the synthesis of compound of formula-I, fluorobenzene is used as a solvent-cum-reagent in the Friedel-Crafts acylation with glutaric anhydride. The yield of compound of the formula-I reported in this procedure is 79%. The reaction is done at 5-12°C. The main disadvantages in this process are:<br>
1.	It requires high quality (benzene content in fluorobenzene should be less than 100ppm) fluorobenzene to get acceptable quality compound of formula-I.<br>
2.	Availability of high quality fluorobenzene is limited for emp10ying the process on a commercial scale.<br>
3.	Price of high quality fluorobenzene is almost 4 times higher than the normal quality (benzene content is 300-700ppm) fluorobenzene. Normal quality fluorobenzene is abundantly available in the market.<br>
Keeping in view of the above mentioned difficulties in implementing the above routes for making compound of formula-I on a commercial scale, we directed our research work to deve10p a simple, convenient, and economical process for the preparation of compound of formula-I which can also be utilized on a commercial scale<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore, to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above overcoming all the disadvantages present in the hitherto known processes.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above which is simple and economical.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above which does not have any mixing problem when the process is used on any scale of operation.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above which does not have reaction quenching problem when the process is used on any scale of operation.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above which does not require high quality fluorobenzene.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above which does not require fluorobenzene as solvent medium to carry out the Friedel-Crafts reaction.<br>
SUMARY O INVENTION<br>
In our preliminary studies in the course of the R&amp;D towards deve10pment of an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I as defined above we found that benzene is more reactive (about 5 times) than fluorobenzene in the above mentioned Friedel-Crafts acylation. This indicates that benzene present in fluorobenzene will react faster than fluorobenzene. Considering this observation we found that<br><br>
(i)   by adjusting the ratio of fluorobenzene with regard to the glutaric anhydride used,<br>
(ii)  dividing the amount of fluorobenzene  used into two   parts - one a10ng with glutaric<br>
anhydride and another part with the ha10genated solvent and (iii) fixing the quantity of the ha10genated solvent used,<br>
a process cab be deve10ped for the preparation of compound of the formula-I as defined above which overcomes the drawbacks of the hitherto known processes described above. Further the process deve10ped can also be useful for any commercial scale production of the said compound of the formula-I. The reaction can be conducted at a convenient temperature range of 10 to 25°C.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of compound (4-4(fluorobenzoyl)butyric acid) of the formula-I<br><br>
which comprises:<br>
(a)	Preparing a solution of normal quality fluorobenzene, glutaric anhydride and ha10genated solvent, the amount of fluorobenzene used being in a molar ratio of 0.5 to 0.7 molar equivalent with regard to the amount of glutaric anhydride used.<br>
(b)	Preparing a mixture of aluminum ch10ride, normal quality fluorobenzene and ha10genated solvent, the amount of fluorobenzene used being in a molar ratio of 0.5 to 0.6 molar equivalent with regard to the amount of glutaric anhydride used and the amount of ha10genated solvent used being at least 4-6 times (w/v) with regard to the amount of glutaric anhydride used.<br>
(c)	Adding the solution obtained in step (a) to the mixture obtained in step (b) at a temperature in the range of 10 to 25°C.<br>
(d)	Maintaining the resulting reaction mixture at a temperature in the range of 10 to 25°C for a period in the range of 2 to 4hrs.<br><br>
(e)	Pouring the reaction mixture into cold dilute hydroch10ric acid.<br>
(f)	Distilling the ha10genated solvent at atmospheric pressure for its recovery.<br>
(g)	Filtering and washing the residue with the same ha10genated solved used in step (b) above to obtain the compound of the formula-I.<br>
(h) Purifying the compound of the formula-I by dissolving it in aqueous base and precipitating the product by acidification after giving a carbon treatment to the basic solution, (i)   Isolating the precipitated compound of formula-I by filtration and if desired (j)   Recrystallizing the purified acid from a single or mixture of solvents.<br>
The normal quality of fluorobenzene used in step (a) refers to the impurity level of benzene. The benzene content in fluorobenzene may be between 300-700ppm. The ha10genated solvent used in step (b) may be selected form methylene ch10ride, ethylene dich10ride, 1,1,2,2-tetrach10roethane. The base used in step (h) may be selected from sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and ammonia. The acid used in step (h) may be selected from hydroch10ric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid. The solvent used for recrystallization in step (j) may be selected from acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, toluene, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane or a mixture of these solvents.<br>
