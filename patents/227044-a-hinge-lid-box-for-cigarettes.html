Folding-box for cigarettes<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a hinge-lid box for cigarettes or other elongate articles, comprising a blank made of thin cardboard or similar packaging material for forming a box part and lid, which can be pivoted with the box part in the region of a box rear wall, the box part comprising a box front wall, box rear wall, base wall and two mutually opposite box side walls, and the lid comprising a lid front wall, lid rear wall, end wall and lid side walls, which correspond to the box side walls. The invention also deals with the configuration of a blank for a hinge-lid box.<br>
Hinge-lid boxes have been used for some time now as a standard form of packaging for cigarettes which is common throughout the world. The pack contents, formed by a cigarette group, are usually enclosed by an inner blank (tinfoil paper). The resulting cigarette block forms the pack contents. The hinge-lid box itself is usually provided with a collar, which mostly comprises a separate blank and is anchored in the box part.<br>
Hinge-lid boxes are predominantly of cuboidal design with a rectangular cross section and right-angled upright pack edges. For adaptation to the shape of the pack contents, namely to the round cigarettes, packs with an octagonal cross section and with rounded upright pack edges have already been proposed.<br>
The object of the invention is to propose a novel shape or configuration of a hinge-lid box, in particular for cigarettes, which ensures improved adaptation to the<br><br>
pack contents and, furthermore, is easy to handle during use.<br>
In order to achieve this object, the hinge-lid box according to the invention is characterized in that at least one of the box side walls and, correspondingly, of the associated lid side wall comprises two wall sections directed at an (obtuse) angle in relation to one another. The pack is preferably of symmetrical design, that is to say with corresponding side walls, which each have a roof-shaped symmetrical cross section with a pack edge in an imaginary central transverse plane of the pack and wall sections of the same width.<br>
The otherwise conventionally designed collar is adapted to the contour of the hinge-lid box, and thus has a roof-shaped angling in the region of collar side tabs, with two tab sections which are directed at an angle in relation to one another being formed in the process.<br>
According to a further proposal of the invention, it is possible for individual upright pack edges, or all the upright pack edges, to be rounded in adaptation to the contour of the cigarettes or of the cigarette group. In the best-case scenario, all (six) upright pack edges are rounded, including the corresponding edges of the collar.<br>
A further special feature is that the box side tabs and lid side tabs, for forming the side walls, only partially overlap, namely in the region of a wall section, that is to say in each case as far as the central pack edge of the side wall on account of a narrow inner side tab. Furthermore, corner tabs, namely base corner tabs and end corner tabs, are configured in a particular manner.<br>
Further features and details of the hinge-lid box according  to  the  invention and of  the blanks  for<br><br>
producing  the  same  are  explained  in  more  detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>

to<br>
figure 17 show partial cross sections of a filled hinge-lid box along a section plane XV-XV from figure 13 for three exemplary embodiments of hinge-lid box.<br>
A hinge-lid box serves preferably for accommodating cigarettes 10. A cigarette group 11 is enclosed by an inner wrapper 12 made of paper, tinfoil or the like. A resulting cigarette block forms the contents of the hinge-lid box.<br>
A hinge-lid box basically comprises a (bottom) box part 13 and a lid 14. The lid 14 is connected in a pivotable manner, via an articulation 15, to the box part 13. The box part 13 comprises a box front wall 16, box rear wall 17, narrow box side walls 18, 19 and a bottom base wall 20. Correspondingly, the lid comprises a lid front wall 21, lid rear wall 22, lid side walls 23, 24 and an end wall 25. The articulation 15 connects the lid rear wall 22 to the box rear wall 17.<br><br>
A hinge-lid box also contains a collar 26. In this case, the latter comprises a separate blank (for example, figure 4) . The collar 26 forms a collar front wall 27 and collar tabs 28. The collar 26 is fixed (by adhesive bonding) within the box part 13, such that a top sub-region projects out of the box part 13 and, when the hinge-lid box is closed, is encased by the lid 14.<br>
One special feature of the present hinge-lid box is that the cross-sectional shape of the latter is adapted, by a corresponding configuration of the side walls 18, 19; 23, 24, to the contour of the pack contents, namely to the shape of the cigarette group 11. For this purpose, the side walls of the box part 13 and of the lid 14 are of essentially roof-shaped design, in any case with two wall sections 29, 30, directed at an (obtuse) angle in relation to one another. In the actual configuration, the side walls comprise two wall sections 29, 30 of the same size, which are directed at an obtuse angle in relation to one another and are thus of wedge-shaped or roof-shaped design.<br>
The exemplary embodiment according to figures 1 to 4 has sharp-edged contours. The side walls 18, 19; 23, 24 form an outwardly directed central edge 35 along an imaginary central transverse plane of the hinge-lid box. The two walls sections 29, 30 converge in the region of said central edge. The two wall sections are preferably directed at an (interior) angle of (approximately) 120°. Furthermore, an optimum pack configuration is provided in that the two (interior) angles between the wall sections 29, 30 on the one hand, and front wall or rear wall of the pack, on the other hand, are also (approximately) 120°.<br><br>
The box side walls 18, 19 and the collar side walls 23, 24 comprise respective side tabs 31, 32 and corresponding lid side tabs 33, 34. When the hinge-lid box is in the finished state, these butt against one another and are connected to one another by adhesive bonding or thermal sealing.<br>
In the case of the present hinge-lid box, the outer side tab 31 and, likewise, the outer lid side tab 33 extends over the entire width of the pack and/or of the side walls 18, 19; 23, 24. For this purpose, this outer side tab 31 or lid side tab 33 is provided with a (more or less) central folding line for forming the central edge 35. The inner side tab 32 or lid side tab 34 has a considerably smaller width than the respective outer side tab 31 or lid side tab 33. As can be seen from figure 14 in particular, the inner side tabs extend merely in the region of a facing wall section 29 of the outer side tabs, namely approximately as far as the central edge 35. The inner and outer side tabs are connected to one another in this region.<br>
The blank  (figure 3)  is configured in a particular manner corresponding to the contour of the hinge-lid box. As is customary, the lid front wall 16, base wall 20, box rear wall 17, lid rear wall 22, end wall 2 5 and lid front wall 21 are positioned one after the other, in one piece, within the blank. The outer side tabs 31 are provided laterally on the box front wall 16, the outer lid side tabs 33, correspondingly, are provided laterally on the lid front wall 21, and the (narrow) side  tabs  32  and  lid  side  tabs  34  are  provided laterally on the box rear wall 17 and lid rear wall 22, respectively. Located on the free end side of the lid<br><br>
front wall 21 is a lid inner tab 37 which is folded against the inside of the lid front wall 21 in the hinge-lid box.<br>
The base wall 20 and end wall 25 are adapted to the contour of the hinge-lid box, that is to say are designed with roof-shaped side edges 38. These butt against top and bottom border regions of the lid side walls 23, 24 on the one hand, and of the box side walls 18, 19, on the other hand, to be precise in a form-fitting manner.<br>
Corner tabs, namely base corner tabs 39 and lid corner tabs 40 are designed in a particular manner. These are provided in extension of the inner side tabs 32, on the one hand, and of the inner lid side tabs 34, on the other hand. The corner tabs 39, 40 are of trapezoidal design in adaptation to the outer contour of the side tabs 32, 34, and to the contour of the base wall 20 and end wall 25. The corner tabs 39, 40 are separated from the respective base wall 2 0 and end wall 25 in each case by an obliquely directed punch cut 41. Accordingly, the corner tabs 39, 40 extend only over half the width of the associated base wall 2 0 and end wall 25, respectively. When the hinge-lid box is in the finished state (figure 1) , the corner tabs 39, 40 butt obliquely against the inside of the respective base wall 20 and end wall 2 5 and are connected thereto.<br>
The collar 26 is adapted to the cross-sectional contour of the hinge-lid box. For this purpose, the collar tabs 28 are provided with an intermediate edge 42, which is located in the region of the central edge 35 of the side walls. The intermediate edge 42 is preformed by a<br><br>
corresponding folding line in the region of the collar tabs 28 (figure 4) .<br>
The geometrical  configuration of the hinge-lid box allows the cigarette group 11  to be  formed  in a particular manner. As can be seen in figures 14 to 17, the cigarettes 10 are arranged in three rows 43, 44, 45. The cigarettes 10 of adjacent rows 43, 44, 45 are positioned in an offset manner in relation to one another (so-called saddle position). The central row 44 has a larger number of cigarettes 10,  namely,  for example eight cigarettes 10, and the two outer rows 43, 45 have seven cigarettes 10.  This results in pack contents, namely in the form of a cigarette block, which are optimally adapted to the cross-sectional contour of the pack. The inner wrapper 12 also follows this contour of the pack and pack contents (figure 14).<br>
A particular end folding formation which is formed at the top of the inner wrapper 12 comprises, in the region of the box front wall 16, a trapezoidal outer longitudinal tab 46 and, adjacent to the box rear wall 17, a correspondingly trapezoidally designed inner longitudinal tab 47. The inner wrapper 12 forms a conventional overlap 48 in the region of the box side walls 18, 19. The inner wrapper 12 is folded here, with two partially overlapping corner gussets 49, 50 being formed in the process. These are folded over internally against the end surfaces of the cigarettes 10, in each case by way of the side regions of the inner wrapper 12, which are likewise oriented in a roof-shaped manner in relation to one another (figure 14).<br>
In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to figures 5 to 8, the central edge in the region of the<br><br>
side walls 18, 19 and 23, 24 is designed, in adaptation to the contour and dimensions of a cigarette 10, as a round edge or as central rounding 51. The pack or the side walls closely fits or fit the shape of the cigarette 10 in this region, to be precise, the respectively outer cigarette in the region of the central row 44. In the case of this exemplary embodiment, upright pack edges 52, 53 in the region of the transition between the side walls 18, 19 and 23, 24 into the front wall and rear wall are of angular design with an (interior) angle of approximately 120°.<br>
The blank according to figure 7 is adapted to this pack shape. In order to form the central roundings 51 in the region of the box part 13 and lid 14, the side tabs 31 and lid side tabs 33 are embossed in order to form the roundings, namely with a group of parallel scores 54 in each case. The collar 26 according to figure 8 is designed correspondingly, that is to say likewise with a group of scores 54 instead of the intermediate edge 42. Accordingly, the collar 26 is attached in the region of the collar tabs 28, to the central roundings 51 of the box part 13 and lid 14.<br>
The base wall 20 and end wall 25 are adapted to the cross-sectional contour of the pack and, on narrow sides, have tongue-like protrusions 55 with a rounded tip matching the central rounding 51.<br>
The hinge-lid box according to figures 9 to 12, is also adapted, in the region of the pack edges, to the contour of the pack contents, to be precise by corner roundings 56, 56 as a transition between the side walls 18, 19 and 23, 24 on the one hand, and the front walls 16, 21 and rear walls 17, 22 on the other hand. The<br><br>
blank for this type of pack is designed correspondingly (figure 11) . The outer side tabs 31 of the box part 13, and correspondingly, the outer lid side tabs are provided with two groups 58, 59 of scores each comprising a j plurality of parallel scores. The groups 58 of scores serve for forming the corner roundings 56 on the front side of the pack, and the group 59 of scores serve for forming the central rounding 51.<br>
) In order to form the rear corner roundings 57, groups 60 of scores are formed in the region of the box rear wall 17 and lid rear wall 22, to be precise, in each case approximately in extension of the groups 58 of scores. The base wall 20 and end wall 25 are designed<br>
i in a manner corresponding to the contour of the pack such that the tongue-like protrusions 55 have central roundings corresponding to the central roundings 51 and, furthermore, merge into the blank by way of border roundings 61, matching the corner roundings 56, 57.<br>
)<br>
In contrast to the abovedescribed exemplary embodiments, the corner tabs, namely base corner tabs 39 and lid corner tabs 40, are separated off from the base wall 20 and end wall 25 by a slot-like interspace 62, with the result that the corner tabs 39, 40 are small, trapezoidal structures.<br>
The three exemplary embodiments differ from one another in respect of the dimensioning of the inner side tabs<br>
i  32 and lid side tabs 34. In the case of the exemplary embodiment according to figures 1 to 4 and figure 15, the inner side tab 32 or 34 extends to the central edge 35, which performs an adjusting action in respect of the precise positioning of the side tabs 32, 34. In the<br>
i  case  of  the  exemplary  embodiments  according  to<br><br>
figures 16 and 17, the side tabs 32, 34 are designed with a smaller width, such that they terminate outside the region of the central roundings 51.<br>
The same applies to the outer side tabs 31, 33, that, in the case of the exemplary embodiments according to figures 15 and 16, these extend more or less as far as the adjacent pack edges 52, whereas, in the case of the example according to figure 15, these tabs terminate outside the region of the corner roundings 57.<br><br>
