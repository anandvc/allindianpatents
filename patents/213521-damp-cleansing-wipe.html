COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
DAMP CLEANSING WIPE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
1047/mumnp/2003<br>
      13-11-03 <br>
DAMP CLEANSING WIPE<br>
The invention concerns low-cost, easily manufacturable disposable single use, substantially damp, cleansing articles.<br>
Personal cleansing and conditioning products have traditionally been marketed in a variety of forms such as bar soaps, creams, lotions, and gels.  These formulations have attempted to satisfy a number of criteria to be acceptable to consumers.  These criteria include cleansing effectiveness, skin feel, skin mildness and lather volume. Ideal personal cleansers should gently cleanse the skin or hair, cause little or no irritation, and not leave the skin or hair overly dry after frequent use.<br>
A series of granted and pending patent applications have<br>
0<br>
been published by Procter &amp; Gamble describing disposable personal cleansing products purportedly addressing many of the aforementioned functionality concerns.  These products are substantially dry articles having deposited onto a woven or non-woven, cloth, a cleansing, composition, of surfactant., structurant, skin conditioning agent and other performance ingredients.  The term "substantially dry" is defined in most of these documents as maximum 10%, but in some instances as high as 15% water.  Particularly preferred levels are 5% or less.  A commercial embodiment sold in the<br>
U.S. is Olay® Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths having water<br>
levels of 3-4% by weight of the total cloth article. The technology is described in the following patents.<br><br>
U.S. Patent 5,951,991 (Wagner et al.) focuses on providing the substrate with a conditioning emulsion separately impregnated from the lathering surfactant onto the cloth substrate.  U.S. Patent 5,980,931 (Fowler et al.) emphasizes impregnation of oil soluble conditioning agents.  WO 99/55303 (Albacarys et al.) describes skin care actives formulated with the cleansing composition.<br>
Manufacturing processes for these products are reported in U.S. Patent 5,952,043 and U.S. Patent 5,863,663, both to Mackey et al.  These patents teach use of a continuous lipid phase with a high melting waxy material deposited onto the wipe substrate.  The material is intended to be sufficiently brittle so as to be easily disrupted by low shear contact (e.g. during wiping of the skin) to readily release an internal skin conditioning phase, yet the material is required to be sufficiently tough to avoid premature release of the internal phase during the rigors of processing.  A problem with this technology is that through compromise the continuous external lipid phase/internal polar phase is neither sufficiently robust for processing and handling nor sufficiently releasable under wash conditions to allow efficient release of conditioning agent onto the skin.<br>
More recent publications in this area include WO 01/08542 Al (Cen et al.), WO 01/08655 Al (Phipps et al.), WO 01/08656 Al (Smith et al.), WO 01/08657 Al (Lorenzi et al.) and WO 01/08658 Al (Cawkwell et al.), all to Procter and Gamble. These documents extend the wipe technology to bonded double layer substrates of contrasting textural properties.  A rougher of the two sides may act as a gripping surface while the other may be used for delivering cleansing aids.  The<br><br>
articles are described as being substantially dry defined as a Moisture Retention ratio of less than 0.95 gms.  The ratio reports weight for total non-bound liquids in the article but is not synonymous with water content.  Water levels are not defined.<br>
Our evaluations of dry wipes produced by the known technology has indicated slow latherability.  We attribute the problem to the relatively thick coating deposited onto the wipe substrate. Another probable source of the problem is the relatively low water content.  A need exists for a cleansing wipe of improved foamability and one which can be efficiently manufactured.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a disposable, cleansing product which upon contact with water rapidly lathers and generates a rich long lasting foam.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a disposable cleansing product having a cleansing composition coatable onto a flexible wiping cloth in a process that minimizes foam generation during manufacture.<br>
Still another advantage of the present invention is to provide a disposable cleansing product which may include an impregnated composition allowing for improved manufacturability, better aesthetics and increased latherability.<br>
These and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in light of the following summary and disclosure.<br><br>
A substantially damp cleansing product is provided which includes:<br>
(i)   a water insoluble substrate; and<br>
(ii)  a cleansing composition impregnated onto the substrate including:<br>
(a)	at least one lathering surfactant present in an amount sufficient to foam;<br>
(b)	water; and<br>
wherein the water is present at greater than 15% by weight of the product, but no higher than 40%, and the composition having a viscosity as measured on a Haake CV 20 Rheometer with 30 mm profiled parallel plates at 23°C ranging from 50 to 300,000 cp.<br>
Now it has been discovered that there is a critical range of viscosity for the impregnated cleansing composition.  Below a minimum viscosity/ the composition foams poorly when the dry wipe is wetted with water by a consumer.  Although not wishing to be bourid by a theory, we believe the low viscosity compositions are readily washed away by water down the sink and unavailable for lathering.  By contrast, a too high viscosity composition cannot be quickly activated with water for lathering by a consumer.  There is a delay period.<br>
Accordingly, the compositions used according to the present invention will have a viscosity ranging from 50 to 300,000 cp (centipoise) . Thickness is measured on a Haake CV 20<br><br>
Rheometer with 3 0 mm profiled parallel plates at 23°C. A preferred viscosity range is from 100 to 250,000 cp, more preferably from 150 to 100,000, even more preferably from 200 to 50,000 cp, and optimally from 400 to 10,000 cp.<br>
Another important discovery is the criticality of water levels.  Substantially dry articles are poor at instantaneously generating 'a foam.  Lathering surfactant cannot easily be activated at levels below 15% water.  Some substantial amount of water must be present to allow the lathering surfactants to exit more rapidly from the substrate creating a foam.  Minimum levels should be greater than 15%, preferably at least about 20%, more preferably at least about 25% by weight of the total cleansing product. These damp levels of water have the further advantage of giving pliability to the fabric substrate. A softer, more pleasant feel results.<br>
Too much water should not be present.  Large amounts of water impart a soggy poor aesthetic feel to the product. Even more significant, water encourages microbial growth. Much higher levels of preservatives are necessary with high water systems. Preservatives are not just a cost issue. Some consumers are hypoallergic to certain types of preservatives. Preserved systems must continuously be monitored to ensure that microbes have not mutated into strain resistant forms. Thus, maximum levels should be no higher than about 40% and preferably no higher than about 35% by weight of the cleansing product.<br>
An essential element of compositions according to the present invention is a lathering surfactant.  By a<br><br>
"lathering surfactant" is meant a surfactant, which when combined with water and mechanically agitated generates a foam or lather.  Preferably, these lathering surfactants should be mild, which means that they must provide sufficient cleansing or detersive benefits but not overly dry the skin or hair, and yet meet the lathering criteria described above.<br>
The products of the present invention typically include at least one lathering surfactant in an amount from about 0.5% to about 60%, preferably from abput 0.75% to about 40%, and more preferably from about 1% to about 2 0%, based on the weight of the impregnated composition.<br>

container is preferably resealable.  Single wipe containing pouches may also be employed.<br>
The water insoluble substrates of the present invention can comprise two or more layers, each having a different texture and abrasiveness.  The differing textures can result from the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate layers of the substrate can be manufactured to have different colors, thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces. Although the present invention may be suitable for substrates with two or more layers having different texture and abrasiveness, the best effectiveness of the damp system can be found with single or multiple layered substrates of identical construction.<br>
The amount of impregnating composition relative to the substrate may range from about 20:1 to 1:20, preferably from 10:1 to about 1:10 and optimally from about 2:1 to about 1:2 by weight.<br>

Water-binding agents are preferably included in compositions of the present invention.  Water soluble binding agents such<br><br>
as polyhydric alcohols are particularly preferred.  Typical polyhydric alcohols include glycerol (also known as glycerin) , polyalkylene glycols and more preferably alkylene polyols and their derivatives, including propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures thereof.  For best results the water-binding agent is preferably glycerin.  Also particularly preferred are polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 2,000,000, with PEG-9M and PEG-14M being preferred) and hexylene glycol.  In certain types of compositions the latter agent may be inappropriate and therefore polyols other than hexylene glycol should be utilized.  The amount of water-binding agent may range anywhere from about 0.5 to about 50%, preferably between about 1 and about 3 0% by weight of the composition.<br>
The disposable, single use personal care cleansing products of the present invention are manufactured by separately or simultaneously adding onto or impregnating into a water insoluble substrate the cleansing composition including lathering surfactants and conditioners, wherein the resulting product is damp.  By "separately" is meant that the surfactants and the conditioners can be added sequentially, in any order without first being combined together.  By "simultaneously" is meant that the surfactants and conditioners can be added at the same time, with or without first being combined together.<br><br>
The surfactant, conditioners, water-binding agents and any-other optional ingredients can be added onto or impregnated into the water insoluble substrate by any means known to those skilled in the art.  For example, addition can be through spraying, laser printing, splashing, dipping, soaking, or coating.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive.  Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above.<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this- invention'.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims' are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A formula typical of the present invention for impregnation onto a rayon/polyester substrate was formulated with the following components.<br><br>
TABLE I Example 1 Formula<br><br>
The formula of the Table was coated onto a substrate at 2.0 grams coating per 2.0 grams rayon/polyester sheet (752 mm by 190 mm area).<br>
Lather quality/stability comparisons were conducted on this Example. A modified Ross-Miles foam tester was employed. The towelettes lather parameters were measured on 3 cloths in 200 ml of water. Results are reported in the Table below.<br><br>
TABLE II Lather Quality/Stability Comparison<br><br>
*  Scale of 1 to 5, in order of increasing lather<br>
quality/stability. ** Representative of towelettes described by P&amp;G in U.S.<br>
Patent 5,951,991, U.S. 5,980,931, U.S. 5,952,043, U.S.<br>
5,863,663 and WO 99/55303.<br>
)  A consumer study was also conducted on two of the towelette types described above.  The study was based on response by 118 panelists.  Results are reported in Table III below.<br>
TABLE III<br>
Consumer Test<br><br><br>
B&amp;sed upon the findings reported in Table III, there was a significant preference for the Example 1 formula towelette<br>
which incorporated 25% water.  The Olay® towelette with only 3-4% water did not provide a sufficiently creamy lather, lathered slower, left skin feeling less soft and less moisturized than the towelette of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A series of compositions are presented under Table IV reflective of the present invention-  These compositions are impregnated onto a non-woven polyester substrate at a 1:1 weight ratio.<br><br>
TABLE  IV<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This Example reports on impregnation composition viscosities and their effect upon lather properties. Three formulations were prepared.  These are reported in the Table below.<br>
TABLE V<br><br>
* Loading = 1.3 grams per 752 mm by 190 mm towelette<br>
Fabric  = 65 grams/m formed of rayon/polyester blend<br>
** Haake CV 20 Rheometer with 30 mm profiled parallel plates at 23°C.<br><br>
TABLE VI Lather Results<br><br>
The Panel high viscosity impregnated composition.  While a satisfactory amount of lather was obtained, the generation was slow.  Sample B with a relatively thin viscosity impregnated composition was quick to lather but total amount was relatively low.  Sample C was a towelette loaded with a mid-range viscosity composition.  It created a good amount of lather and was generated in a short period of time.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A damp cleansing article comprising :<br>
(i)       a water insoluble substrate; and<br>
(ii)       a cleansing composition impregnated onto the substrate comprising :<br>
(a)	at least one lathering surfactant present in an amount which ranges from 1 to 60% by weight of the composition;<br>
(b)	water; and<br>
wherein the water is present at greater than 15% by weight of the product., but no higher than 35%, and the composition having a viscosity at 23°C ranging from 50 to 300,000 cp.<br>
2.	The article as claimed in claim 1 wherein the viscosity ranges from 100 to 250,000 cp.<br>
3.	The article as claimed in claims 1 or 2 wherein the viscosity ranges from 150 to 100,000 cp.<br>
4.	The article as claimed in any preceding claims wherein the viscosity ranges from 400 to 10,000 cp.<br>
5.	The article as claimed in any preceding claims wherein the weight ratio of all lathering surfactants to water ranges from 1:10 to 5:1.<br>
