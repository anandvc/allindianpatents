				<td>The present invention relates to a ceiling member for an automobile interior.<br>
Ceiling members for automobile interiors are known, in the art. One example of such ceiling members is known from Japanese Utility Model Post-Exam Publication No. HEI 3-46996 entitled "VEHICLE .INTERIOR MEMBER".<br>
With respect to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 hereof, there is illustrated a ceiling member 100 as disclosed in the publication. Theceiling member 100 includes a covering material 101 facing towards or exposed to a passenger compartment of an automobile, a ventilative cushioning material 102 laminated to the covering material 101, a ventilative foam 103 lying on the cushioning material 102, a resinous sheet 104 laid on the foam 103, and a lining material 105 applied to the sheet 104. The covering material.101 is made of a ventilative fabric. The cushioning material 102 is formed of polyurethane slab. The foam 103 is made from such a ventilative and sound absorptive materjial as glass wool. The sheet 104 is formed from an olefin-based material. The sheet 104 prevents sound and air from passing therethrough. The lining material 105 is made of nonwoven fabric which, when rubbed against the interior of an automobile body, produces no noise.<br>
The ceiling member 100 is advantageous because air, which has flowed from within the passenger compartment through the covering material 101 and the cushioning material 102 into the<br><br>
foam 103, is prevented from passing through the resinous sheet 104, as shown by an arrow  of- Fig. 7. In other words, air does not flow through the ceiling member 100. Therefore, no dust or the like clings to the covering 101.<br>
Mounting an interior roof lamp 106 to the interior of the automobile body requires forming an aperture 107 in the ceiling<br>
— member 100, as shown in Fig. 8. In such a case, however, harmful air could flow through the cushioning material 102 and an end<br>
surface 108 of the ceiling member 100, as shown by an arrow<br><br>
(1) of Fig. 8. This means that the harmful air undesirably passes through the ceiling member 100. The thus arranged ceiling member 100 fails to exhibit a ventilation characteristic.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a sound absorptive ceiling member for an automobile interior, which prevents harmful air from flowing therethrough.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a ceiling member for an automobile interior, comprising: a ventilative and sound absorptive substrate; a ventilative covering material applied to a surface of the substrate; an unventilated film applied to a back surface of the substrate; and the substrate having edges unventilated.<br>
The unventilated edges of the substrate prevent air from passing therethrough. There is no longer harmful flow of air through the ceiling member.<br>
In a preferred form of the present invention, the edges are compressed hermetic portions.<br><br>
In a further preferred form of the present invention, the edges are impregnated with-resins.<br><br>
The unventilated edges are the hermetic portions compressed such that the sound absorption coefficient of the substrate is maintained constant. Thus, the ceiling member maintains the sound absorption coefficient constant.<br>
The ceiling member is molded in such a manner that an edge of the substrate is compressed to provide the hermetic portion-<br>
~<br>
During the molding of the ceiling member, the edge of the substrate is compressed to thereby provide the hermetic portion, ' and therefore there is no need for a particular process for compressing the edge of the substrate to provide the hermetic portion. 'The production cost of the ceiling member is maintained constant..<br><br>
The present invention relates to a ceiling member for lining the interior of<br>
a passenger compartment of an automobile, comprising:<br>
an air permeable sound absorption substrate,<br>
an air permeable covering material applied to a front surface of said<br>
sound absorption substrate which front surface is to be arranged facing<br>
toward the passenger compartment; and<br>
an   air   impermeable   film   arranged   on   a   back   side   of  said   sound<br>
absorption substrate which backside is to be arranged facing away from<br>
the passenger compartment,<br>
characterized in that the air impermeable film is applied to a back<br>
surface of said sound absorption substrate and in that said sound<br>
absorption   substrate   has   air   impermeable   edges,   wherein   said   air<br>
impermeable edge defines an opening for mounting an interior roof lamp<br>
and an opening provided on the portion of said ceiling    member,  is<br>
recessed   from   an   interior   side   thereof   facing   the   said   passenger<br>
compartment.<br>

The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application or uses.<br>
Referring now to drawings in which similar elements are numbered identically throughout, a description of preferred embodiments is provided.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a ceiling member 10A for an automobile<br>
interior comprises a laminate 16 including a substrate 11, a<br>
covering material 13 applied to a surface 12 of the substrate<br>
11, and an unventilated film 15 applied to a back surface 14<br>
of the substrate 11 positioned opposite from the surface 12.<br>
In other words, the substrate 11, the covering material 13,<br>
and the unventilated film 15 are laminated together to provide<br>
the ceiling member 10A. Formed in the ceiling member 10A is<br>
an opening 23 for an interior roof lamp (not shown). An edge<br>
17 of the substrate 11 is rendered unventilated in a manner<br>
as will be described later to thereby provide a compressed hermetic<br><br>
portion 18. The substrate 11 also has an unventilated edge 19 defining the opening 23. The unventilated edge 19 is a compressed hermetic portion 21, as is the unventilated edge 17. Reference numeral 22 denotes a cover for the interior roof lamp.<br>
The substrate 11 is both ventilative and sound absorptive. .The substrate 11 can be formed of, for example, a mixture of glass fibers and polypropylene resin.<br>
The covering material 13 is ventilative. The covering material 13 can be made of, for example, tricot or nonwoven fabric.<br>
The unventilated film 15 is a resinous film which prevents air from passing therethrough.<br>
Discussion is made as to how the ceiling member 10A is molded using a mold assembly 25 as shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B.<br>
Initially, glass fibers and polypropylene resin are mixed together to prepare the substrate 11, after which theunventilated film 15 is applied onto the back surface 14 of the substrate 11. The substrate 11 having the film 15 applied thereto is then heated to expand the glass fibers. The substrate 11 is thus expanded. The substrate 11 thus arranged is subsequently cooled. Thereafter, adhesive 24 is applied to the covering material 13 . The substrate 11 having the film 15 applied thereto and the covering material 13 having the adhesive 24 applied thereto are set within the mold assembly 25, as shown in Fig. 2A.<br><br>
The mold assembly 25 includes an upper mold 26 and a lower mold 27. The mold assembly 25 can perform trimming, punching, and machining operations on the substrate 11 and the covering material 13 set therewithin. The mold assembly 25 is operated to raise the lower mold 27, as shown by an arrow (D of Fig. 2A.<br>
The upper and lower molds 26, 27 compress the covering material 13 and the substrate 11 together, such that the covering material 13 is applied to the substrate 11. At the same time, part 28 of the substrate 11 is compressed to provide a hermetic part. The hermetic part is then punched to define the opening 23 (see Fig. 3) . Accordingly, the unventilated edge 19 defining the opening 23 is formed. An edge (not shown) of the substrate<br>
11	is also compressed using the mold assembly 25, thereby providing<br>
the hermetic portion 18. Namely, the unventilated edge 17 (see<br>
Fig. 1) is molded.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the ceiling member 10A includes the substrate 11, the covering material 13 applied to the surface<br>
12	of the substrate 11, and the unventilated film 15 applied<br>
onto the back surface 14.  The unventilated edge 19 of the<br>
substrate 11 is the hermetic portion 21, as stated above. More<br>
specifically, the unventilated edge 19 of the substrate 11<br>
contains glass fibers held or compressed together in such a<br>
manner as to provide no spaces therebetween. Provision of the<br>
hermetic portion 21 is advantageous because air 32, which has<br>
passed from passenger compartment 31 through the covering<br>
material 13 into the substrate 11, does not flow through the<br><br>
hermetic portion 21- It is to be understood that the hermetic portion 18 prevents the flow of air therethrough as does the hermetic portion 21.<br>
Since the covering material 13 is applied to the surface 12 of the substrate 11 while the unventilated film 15 is applied onto the back surface 14 of the substrate 11, sound produced within the passenger compartment 31 passes directly into the substrate 11. Little sound 35 passes out of the ceiling member 10A. This means that, with the sound absorption coefficient a maintained constant, the substrate 11 substantially absorbs the sound produced within the passenger compartment 31. As used herein, the sound absorption coefficient (X is expressed as follows:<br>
a (%) = (Sa - Sb) / Sa * 100<br><br>
where Sa is the loudness of the sound produced within the passenger compartment 31 and having sound waves 33 arriving at the substrate 11 at a given angle of incidence and Sb is the loudness of sound having sound waves 34 reflected by the substrate 11.<br>
Fig. 4 graphically shows the sound absorption coefficient of the ceiling member 10A. The axis of ordinates indicates the sound absorption coefficient of the ceiling member while the axis of abscissas indicates the frequency of the sound wave. A ceiling member having any part that is not yet rendered unventilated also exhibits the sound absorption coefficient as shown in Fig. 4. In other words, the sound absorption<br><br><br><br>
coefficient does not depend upon whether or not the ceiling member includes hermetic portions containing glass fibers held or compressed together in such a manner as to provide no spaces formed therebetween.<br>
Ventilation characteristics of ceiling members 50, 60 shown in Figs. 5B and 5C, respectively, were evaluated using a ventilation test apparatus 40 as shown in Fig. 5A- The apparatus<br>
40	includes a mounting portion 42 to which a sample 41 (i.e.,<br>
either of the ceiling members 50, 60) to be evaluated is attached,<br>
and a fan 44. The apparatus 40 is connected to a device 43<br>
for drawing air out of the apparatus 40.<br>
With the sample 41 mounted to the mounting portion 42, the device 43 is operated to draw air out of the apparatus 40 while the fan 44 is operated to raise dust 45, as shown in Fig. 5A. Under such a condition, a judge visually checks whether a surface 46 of the sample 41 is dirtied. More specifically, she checks to see if the dust 45 clings to the surface 46. If the dust 45 clings to the surface 45, she considers the sample<br>
41	to have the ventilation characteristic.  In other words,<br>
the sample 41 is considered to be ventilative.<br>
In relation to Fig. 5B, the ceiling member 50 has an edge 51of thickness tl. The thickness tl is 5mm. A portion 52 other than the edge 51 also has a thickness t2 of 5mm. The edge 51 is ventilative.<br>
To mold the ceiling member 50, a 100-µm-thick film 55 of polypropylene (PP) was initially applied to a back surface 54 of a substrate 53 containing 50 % by weight of glass fibers.<br><br>
The substrate 53 thus arranged was then heated to a temperature<br>
of 200 °C. The substrate 53 was held at 200 °C for 120 seconds to expand the glass fibers. The substrate 53 was thus expanded. The substrate 53 was subsequently cooled, after which adhesive was applied to a surf ace 56 of the substrate 53 positioned opposite from the back surf ace 54 . A covering material 57 and the substrate 53 were set within a mold. The mold is operated such that the covering material 57 adheres to the surface 56 to thereby provide the ceiling member 50, The ceiling member 50 is punched to provide the edge 51.<br>
The ceiling member 50 was then set within the apparatus 40 for evaluation of the ventilation characteristic . As a result, the covering material 57 was found to be dirty. That is, the dust 45 clung to the covering material 57. The result indicates that the air passes through the covering material 57 into the substrate 53 and flows out of the edge 51, as shown by arrows<br>
(D, © of Fig. 5B-<br>
As shown in Fig. 5C, the ceiling member 60 provided in accordance with the present invention has an unventilated edge 61 of thickness t3. The thickness t3 is 2.5mm. A portion 62 other than the edge 61 has a thickness t4 of 5mm. The unventilated edge 61 is formed in the manner as described above. Except that the edge 61 is rendered unventilated, the ceiling member 60 is molded in the same manner as the ceiling member 50.<br>
The ceiling member 60 was set within the apparatus 40 for evaluation of the ventilation characteristic. As a result, it was found that the covering material 57 was not dirtied.<br><br>
Namely, the covering material 57 had no dust 45 clung thereto. The result shows that air, which has passed through the covering material 57, is prevented from flowing through the substrate 53, as shown by an arrow @ of Fig. 5C. This means that harmful flow of air through the substrate 53 is not produced.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an alternative to the ceiling member 10A. A ceiling member 10B is comprised of the laminate 16 including the substrate 11, the covering material 13 applied to the surface 12, and the unventilated film 15 applied to the back surface 14. The substrate 11 includes unventilated edges 71, 72. More specifically, the edges 71, 72 are rendered unventilated because they are coated or otherwise impregnated with resins 73, 74. With this arrangement, air is not permitted to flow through the edges 71, 72.<br>
Provision of the unventilated edges 71, 72 makes it possible to stop the harmful flow of air through the substrate 11 without requiring any major change to the design of the ceiling member-<br>
The present invention has been described as being applied to the ceiling member having the opening 23 for the interior roof lamp, however, it may be altered such that the ceiling member has an opening for a sunroof.<br>
The substrate 11, the covering material 13, and the unventilated film 15 may be formed of a variety of other materials to provide their respective characteristics as stated above.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
