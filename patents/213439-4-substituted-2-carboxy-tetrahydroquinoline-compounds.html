				<td>4-SUBSTITUTED-2-CARBOXY TETRAHYDROQUINOLINE COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to 1, 2, 3, 4 tetrahydroquinoiine derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medicine. In particular, it relates to 1, 2, 3, 4 tetrahydroquinoiine derivatives which are potent and specific antagonists of excitatory arnino acids.<br>
Calling et al., Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 13 pp. 65-70, 1993, teaches 4-substituted-2-carboxy tetrahydroquinolines having good in vitro affinity for the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex but at best only weak in vivo activity. More particularly, it teaches that such derivatives substituted at the 4 position by the group CH2CO2H or CH2CONHPh have little or no in vivo activity when administered systemically (ip).<br>
WO 97/12870 and WO 98/07704 describe novel 4-substituted-2-carboxy-tetrahydroquinoline derivatives which not only have a good in vitro affinity for the strychnine insensitive glycine binding site associated with the NMDA receptor complex but also have good in vivo activity when administered intravenously (iv).<br>
We have now discovered a novel group of 4-substituted-2-carboxv tetrahydroquinoiine having a particularly useful profile of activity as selective antagonists for the strychnine insensitive glycine binding site associated with the NMDA receptor complex.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof are excitatory amino acid antagonists. More particularly they are potent antagonists at the strychnine insensitive glycine binding srte associated with the NMDA receptor complex. As such they are potent antagonists of the NMDA receptor complex. These compounds are therefore useful in the treatment or prevention of neurotoxic damage or neurodegenerative diseases. Thus the compounds are useful for the treatment of neurotoxic injury which follows cerebral stroke, thromboemboiic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral ischemia, cerebral vasospam, hypoglycemia, amnesia, hypoxia, anoxia, perinatal asphyxia cardiac arrest. The compounds are useful in the treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as: Huntingdon's disease, Alzheimer's senile dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Glutaric Acidaemia type, multi-infarct dementia, status epilecticus, contusive injuries (e.g. spinal cord injury and head injury), viral infection induced neurodegeration (e.g. AIDS, encephalopaties), Down syndrome, ocular neurodegeneration (e.g glaucoma), epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, migraine, headaches including cluster headaches and or tension headaches, anxiety, pain (e.g inflamatory pain and neuropathic pain), neurogenic bladder, emesis<br><br>
11<br>
irritative bladder disturbances, drug dependency, including withdrawal symptoms from alcohol, cocaine, opiates, nicotine (e.g. smoking cessation) benzodiazepines and. inhibition of tolerance induced by opioids (i.e morphine).<br>
The potent and selective action of the compound of the invention at the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site present on the NMDA receptor complex may be readily determined using conventional test procedures. Thus the ability to bind at the strychnine insensitive glycine binding site was determined using the procedure of Kishimoto H et al., J Neurochem 1981, 37, 1015-1024. The selectivity of the action of compounds of the invention for the strychnine insensitive glycine site was confirmed in studies at other ionotropic known excitatory amino acid receptors. Thus compounds of the invention were found to show little or no affinity for the kainic acid (kainate) receptor, a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor or at the NMDA binding site.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be found found to inhibit NMDA induced convulsions in mice using the procedure Chiamulera C et at., Psychopharmacology (1990), 102, 551-552.<br>
The neuroprotective activity of the compounds of the invention may be demonstrated in the middle cerebral artery occlusion preparation in mice, using the procedure described by Chiamulera C. et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 216 (1992) pp. 335-336.<br>
The ability of compounds of the invention to alleviate withdrawal symptoms from nicotine following smoking cessation may be demonstrated in conventional tests of nicotine induced relapse using the procedure described in C. Chiamulera et a!., Arch. Pharmacol., 358, 1998.<br>
The invention therefore provides for the use of a compound of formula (I) and/or physiofogically acceptable salts or non-toxic metabolically labile<br><br>
12<br>
esters thereof for use in therapy and in particular use as medicine for antagonising the effects of excitatory amino acids upon the NMDA receptor complex.<br>
The ability of compounds of the invention to inhibit pain may be demonstrated in conventional analgesic screen such as those described by Dubuisson and Dennis, Pain, 1977, 4:161-174; J.J. Bennett and J.K Xue, Pain. 1988,41, 87-107.<br>
The invention also provides for the use of a compound of formula (I) and/or a physiologically acceptable salt or non-toxic metabolically labile esters thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for antagonising the effects of excitatory amino acids upon the NMDA receptor complex.<br>
According to a further aspect, the invention also provides for a method for antagonising the effects of excitatory amino acids upon the NMDA receptor complex, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an antagonistic amount of a compound of formula (I) and/or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment extends to prophylactics as well as the treatment of established diseases or symptoms.<br>
It will further be appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary with the nature of the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age and the condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician. In general however doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 2 to 800mg per day, dependent upon the route of administration.<br>
Thus for parenteral administration a daily dose will typically be in the range 20-100mg, preferably 60-80mg per day. For oral administration a<br><br>
13<br>
daily dose will typically be within the range 200-800mg, e.g. 400-600mg per day.<br>
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.<br>
While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the invention may be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
The invention thus further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula ([) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or non-toxic metabolically labile esters thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients.

In one embodiment of this process the reaction may be carried out using a catalytic amount of a Palladium (O) complex such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladiurn and a suitable organic base such as trialkylamine e.g. triethylamine or inorganic base, e.g. potassium carbonate.<br>
The reaction is conveniently carried out in an aprotic polar solvent such as acetonitriie, dimethylforrnarnide or in aprotic apolar solvent such as hydrocarbon (ie toluene, xilene, hexane) at a temperature within the range of 60°C to 150oC followed, where necessary or desired, by subsequent removal of the carboxyl protecting group R12 and any protecting group R14.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process the reaction is carried out using a<br>

17<br>
necessary or desired, by subsequent removal of the carboxyl protecting group R12 and any nitrogen protecting group R14.<br>

Suitable carboxyl protecting groups R12 for use in this reaction include alkyl, such as ethyl, trichloroalkyl, trialkylsllylalkyl, or arylmethyl groups such as benzyl, nitrobenzyl or trityl.<br>
Further convenient carboxyl protecting groups are those having a chiral<br>
group derived from chiral alcohols such as (+)-S-indanol, (+)-S-methyl<br>
mandelate, chiral (Chalkyl lactate: i.e. (+)-R- or (-)-S-methly lactate, (+)-<br>
R-t-butyl lactate, (+)-R- or (-)-S-ethyl lactate, (-)-S-isopropyl lactate, (-)-S-<br>
butyl lactate, (+)-R-isobutyl lactate or chiral aralkyl lactate (i.e. benzyl<br>
lactate),	(-)-S-perillyl	alcohol,	(-)-methyl-{R)-3-hydroxy-2-<br>
methylpropionate, (-)-(R)-2-butanol, (-)-(S)-2-methyl-1 -butanol. R12 is preferably an ethyl, benzyl group or a group derived from a chiral(C1-4)  alkyl  lactate   alcohol   (eg   (+)-(R)-t-butyl   lactate   (-)-S-butyl lactate, (+)-R- isobutyl lactate alcohol).<br><br>
18<br>
When R14 is nitrogen protecting examples of suitable groups include alkoxycarbonyl e.g. t-butoxycarbonyl, arylsulphonyl e.g. phenysulphonyl or 2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared from compound of formula (111) in which R12 is a  carboxyl protecting group and R14 is hydrogen or a nitrogen protecting group as defined in formula (II) and R13 represents a bromine or iodine atom.<br><br>

followed, where  necessary or desired,  by removal  of the carboxyl protecting group R12 and nitrogen protecting group R13. In one embodiment of this process the reaction may be carried out using a phoshorus ylide of formula (IV)<br><br>
wherein R15 is an alkyl or phenyl group.<br><br>
19<br>
The reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile or dimethylformamide at a temperature ranging from -20°C to the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
Compounds of formula (III) and (IV) are either known compounds or may be prepared by analogous methods to those used for known compounds.<br>
A convenient method for preparing compounds of formula (III) is reacting compound of formula (V) in which R12 is a carboxyl protecting group and R14 is hydrogen or a nitrogen protecting group as defined in formula (II) and R13 represents a bromine or iodine atom with an allyltintrihalide.(VI) followed by ozonization reaction<br><br>
The reaction conveniently takes place in a solvent such as hydrocarbon e.g. Toluene or halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloro methane at a temperature ranging from -78°C to room temperature). The ozonization may be carried out by passing a stream of ozone into a solution in the presence of dimethyl sulphide or triphenylphosphine in a suitable solvent such as halohydrocarbon (e.g dicholoromethane) at low temperature e.g. -78°C.<br>
Alternatively compounds (III) may be prepared by aldolic reaction of the imino compound (V), with the enol ether (VII), wherein R16 is a C1-4 alkyl group.<br>
OSi(R16)3(V|Ill)<br>
The reaction may be carried out in a solvent such as methyiene cloruro or acetonitriie in the presence of a Lewis acid such as Ytterbium triflate.<br><br>
20<br>
In any of the above reactions the carboxyl protecting group may be removed by conventional procedures known for removing such groups. Thus compounds where R12 is a benzyl, ethyl or (+)-R- or (-)-S-t-butyl lactate group may be removed by hydrolysis using an alkali metal hydroxide e.g. lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or isopropanol, water or mixtures thereof, followed, where desired or necessary, by that addition of a suitable acid e.g. hydrochloric acid to give the corresponding free carboxylic acid.<br>
In any of the above reactions the nitrogen protecting group may be removed by conventional procedures known for removing such groups, for example by acid or base hydrolysis. Thus when R14 is alkoxycarbonyl e.g. t-butoxycarbonyi or phenylsulphonyl it may be removed by alkaline hydrolysis using for example lithium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or an alkanol e.g. isopropanol. Alternatively the alkoxycarbonyl group may be removed by acid hydrolysis.<br>
Physiologically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by treating the corresponding acid with an appropriate base in a suitable solvent. For example the sodium or potassium salt may be prepared by treating a solution of the corresponding acid of a compound of formula (I) with sodium or potassium 2-ethylhexanoate with alkali or alkaline metal hydroxide, or the corresponding carbonate or bicarbonate thereof. Alternatively alkali or alkaline metal salts may be prepared by direct hydrolysis of carboxyl protected derivatives of compounds of formula (1) with the appropriate alkali or alkaline metal hydroxide.<br>
Metabolically labile esters of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by esterification of the carboxylic acid group or a salt thereof or by trans esterfication using conventional procedures. Thus, for example, acyloxyalkyl esters may be prepared by reacting the free carboxylic acid or a salt thereof with the appropriate acyloxylalkyl halide in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide. For the esterifcation of the free<br><br>
21<br>
carboxyl group this reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a quaternary ammonium halide such as tetrabutyiammonium chloride or benzyltriethylarnmonium chloride.<br>
Specific enantiomers of the compounds of formula (I) may also be obtained from corrisponding racemic compounds of formula (I) using chiral HPLC procedure.<br>
Alternatively the enantiomers may be prepared by esterification of the corresponding racemic compounds of formula (I) with a suitable chirai alcohol, separating the resultant diastereomeric esters by conventional means e.g. chromatography or crystallisation followed by hydrolysis of the diastereomeric esters.<br>
Suitable chirai alcohols for use in the process include (+)-S-indanol, (+)-S-methyl mandelate, chirai (C1-4)alkyl lactate: i.e. (+)-R- or (-)-S-methly lactate, (+)-R-t-butyl lactate, (+)-R- or (-)-S-ethyl lactate, (-)-S-isopropyl lactate, (-)-S-butyl lactate, (+)-R-isobutyl lactate or chirai aralkyl lactate (i.e. benzyl lactate), (-)-S-perillyl alcohol, (-)-methyl-(R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate, (-)-(R)-2-butanol, (-)-(S)-2-methyl-1 -butanol.<br>
The diastereomeric esters of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by conventional means such as reaction of the chirai alcohol with an activated derivative of a compound of formula (I) in an aprotic solvent such as ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The activated derivative of a compound of formula (I) may be prepared from compounds (I) using conventional means for preparing activated derivatives of a carboxylic acid groups such as those conveniently used in peptide synthesis.<br>
A particularly convenient method of preparing the diastereomeric esters of compounds (I) is to prepare the activated derivative of compounds (I) in the presence of the chirai alcohol.<br><br>
22<br>
Thus for example racemic mixture of compounds (I) may be treated with the Mitsunobu combination of reagents, i.e. a dialkyl azo-dicarboxylate such as diethylazodicarboxylate and a triarylphosphine e.g. triphenylphosphine or trialkylphoshine (i.e. tributylphosphine) in the presence of the chiral alcohol.<br>
The reaction conveniently takes place in the presence of a suitable solvent such as an ether (e.g. diethylether or tetrahydrofuran), a halohydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane) or a nitrile (e.g. acetonitrile) or a mixture thereof at a temperature ranging from 0-30°C.<br>
The required single diastereomeric ester of compounds (I) may be obtained from the mixture thereof by conventional means, for example by the use of conventional chromatographic procedures such as preparative HPLC or by fractional crystallization.<br>
Alternatively the required single diastereomeric ester of compound of formula (I) may be obtained using a suitable chiral protecting group R12 as defined in formula (II).<br>
Specific enantiomers of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared from the corresponding single diastereomeric ester of compounds (I) by hydrolysis e.g. alkaline hydrolysis. Thus, for example, the hydrolysis may be carried using an alkali metal hydroxide e.g. sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide in a solvent such as an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran and water.<br>
Alternatively specific enantiomers of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by stereoselective enzymatic hydrolysis of compounds of formula (VIII)<br><br>
