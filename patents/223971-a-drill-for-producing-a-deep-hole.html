DESCRIPTION DEEP HOLE DRILL<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a drill for producing a deep hole in a cylinder block, a crankshaft, and the like of an engine-Background Ait<br>
One example of a drilling tool is proposed in each of the following Patent Documents 1,2 and 3.<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses a tapping screw having a drill cutting edge provided at the tip section and an end mill cutting edge formed next to the drill cutting edge.. In this prior1 art, the tip section of the drill cutting edge is formed to cause the core section to protrude in the axial direction.<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses an end mill of which the tool body is provided with first and second flutes, wherein the first flute is provided with a first peripheral tip and a central tip, while the second flute is provided with a second peripheral tip.. In this prior art, the cutting edge lines of a tip section of the first and second peripheral tips are formed to be depressed toward the tool core..<br>
The difference between the drill and the end mill is now clarified.. The drill has the cutting edge only on the tip and is used for' drilling and chamfering operations. On the other hand, the end mill has an end cutting edge and a peripheral cutting edge and can be used for drilling, grooving and a side cutting operation, but a shallow hole can only be made because the tip room is narrow.<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses a drill of which the spiral angle of the cutting edge is gradually decreased toward a shank    In this prior art, it is shown that the tip edge line of the cutting edge is depressed. [Patent Document]<br><br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Utility Model Publication No.. Hei 6-18710 Patent Document 2: Japanese Utility Model Publication No.. Hei 6-254711 Patent Document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.. Hei 7-40118 Fig.. 5 explains an example in which a deep hole is made in a cylinder block with a conventional chill (point angle: 118 degrees) of which the tip of the cutting edge is projecting..   As shown in Fig, 5 (a), the cylinder block is foimed with a lower hole (i.e, a mold-release hole) in the case of casting..    If cutting proceeds in such a condition in which the center of the lower hole is not in line with die core of the drill, a difference is caused in the radial force even though a cutting force received fiom the cutting surface is the same as shown in Fig.. 5 (b).   As a result, a sudden hole-bending may be generated as shown in Fig.. 5 (c)..<br>
On the other hand, when the tip section of the cutting edge is foimed to have a depressed shape, the bending can be improved because the tip section does not follow the lower hole in the case of cutting and the rectilineal propagation is good- However, bending is readily generated when the hole to be cut is deep because there is still a difference in the radial force.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
To solve the above-mentioned problem, according to the present invention, there is provided a drill for making a deep hole in which the edge line of a tip section of a spiral cutting edge is depressed toward the core of the drill and a guide section is provided on a heel side on the same circumference as that on which the outer end section of the cutting edge passes in the tip section of the drill.<br>
In this manner, by providing the guide section, the drill is supported at four points including the cutting edges and as a result, bending in the case of making the deep hole can be controlled.. It is also possible to provide the guide section with a diamond edge..<br>
Further, to improve the rectilinear propagation of the drill without following the lower1 hole, it is desirable that the concave angle of the tip section of the cutting edge<br><br>
be between 0 and 10 degrees, for example, be about 5 degrees..<br>
Still further, the standard core thickness of the diiil having a general outside dimension of 7.4 mm (= D) is 1.48 mm oi less (0..2D). However, in this case, the core thickness is overcome or affected by the radial foice produced in the case of producing the deep hole and as a result, bending is readily produced.. It is therefore desirable that the core thickness be 2.22 mm (0..3D) or more, for example, be about 2.96 mm (0..4D).<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Fig,. 1 is a whole view of a drill for making a deep hole according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of a tip section of the drill for making a deep hole according to the present invention;<br>
Fig.. 3 is an end view of the tip section of the drill for making a deep hole according to the present invention;<br>
Figs. 4 is an end view similar to Fig.. 3 showing another embodiment (with a diamond cutting edge provided); and<br>
Fig.. 5 (a) through (c) are views explaining a conventional problem..<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.. Fig., 1 is a whole view of a drill for making a deep hole according to the present invention.. Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of a tip section of the drill for making a deep hole according to the present invention and Fig.. 3 is an end view of the tip section of the drill for making a deep hole according to the present invention,<br>
A drill for producing a deep hole comprises a drill body 1 and a shank 2.. The drill body 1 is spirally provided with a pair of cutting edges 3.. The cutting edges 3 are formed at opposing positions spaced apart by about 180 degrees around a core la of the drill and the edge lines of the tip section of the cutting edges 3 are depressed toward the<br><br>
core la of the drill. An angle foimed between the edge line 3a (the edge line of the cutting edges 3 in the outer end section) and the line perpendicular to the core la is 5 degrees..   In the figure shown here, the core thickness (t) is 2.96 mm (0..4D).<br>
The drill according to the present invention is further provided with a guide section 4 for preventing bending in the case of cutting.. The guide section 4 is provided on a heel side on the same circumference as that on which the outer end section of the cutting edges 3, 3 passes.. In this manner, a stable cutting operation can be performed by four-point support of the cutting edges 3,3 and the guide sections 4,4.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a view similar to Fig.. 3 showing another1 embodiment In this embodiment, diamond edges 5, 5 are provided at the tip section of the guide sections 4, 4 to have a structure that can be diverted to a reaming operation..<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the drill according to the present invention is provided with the guide section so that the drill can have a self-guide function and the tip section of the cutting edge is depressed toward the core so as not to follow the lower hole for smooth rectilinear propagation.. Further, since the core thickness is increased for higher rigidity, generation of bending can be prevented even though a difference is caused in the radial force by the displacement between the center' of the lower hole and the core of the drill when a deep hole is made in a crank shaft, a cylinder- block and the like..<br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.	A drill for producing a deep hole having a spiral cutting edge wherein the edge<br>
line of a tip section of the cutting edge is depressed toward a core of the drill and a<br>
guide section is provided on a heel side on the same circumference as that on which an<br>
outer end section of the cutting edge passes in the tip section of the drill.<br>
2.,	The drill for producing a deep hole according to claim 1, wherein a concave<br>
angle of the depressed tip section of the cutting edge is between 0 and 10 degrees.<br>
3	The drill for producing a deep hole according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein<br>
when the outside dimension of the drill is D, the core thickness of the drill is 0..3D or<br>
more..<br>
4,	The drill for producing a deep hole according to claims 1 through 3, wherein<br>
the guide section is provided with a diamond edge..<br><br></td>
