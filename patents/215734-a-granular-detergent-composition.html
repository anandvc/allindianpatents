				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a detergent composition having a selected surfactant system for improved performance. More particularly, the detergent composition includes a mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant in combination with a linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant, and linear alkyl sulfate surfactant resulting in surfactant system which causes the composition to have improved cleaning performance, especially under low water temperature wash conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional detersive surfactants comprise molecules having a water-solubilizing substituent (hydrophilic group) and an oleophilic substituent (hydrophobic group). Such surfactants typically comprise hydrophilic groups such as carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, amine oxide, polyoxyethylene, and the like, attached to an alkyl, alkenyl or alkaryl hydrophobe usually containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Accordingly, the manufacturer of such surfactants must have access to a source of hydrophobe groups to which the desired hydrophile can be attached by chemical means. The earliest source of hydrophobe groups comprised the natural fats and oils, which were converted into soaps (i.e., carboxylate hydrophile) by saponification with base. Coconut oil and palm oil are still used to manufacture soap, as well as to manufacture the alkyl sulfate ("AS") class of surfactants. Other hydrophobes are available from petrochemicals, including alkylated benzene which is used to manufacture alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactants ("LAS").<br>
Generally, alkyl sulfates are well known to those skilled in the art of detersive surfactants. Alkyl sulfates were developed as a functional improvement over traditional soap surfactants and have been found to possess improved solubility and surfactant characteristics. Linear alkyl sulfates are the most commonly used of the alkyl sulfate surfactants and are the easiest to obtain. For example, long-chain linear alkyl sulfates, such as tallow alkyl sulfate, have been usedln laundry detergents. However, these have significant cleaning performance limitations, especially with the trend to lower wash temperatures.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a detergent composition which includes a surfactant capable of delivering improved cleaning at low wash water temperatures (e.g.,<br>
20°C-5°C). Moreover, even detergent compositions containing surfactants having the desired performance have room for improved performance. In particular, certain detergent compositions containing selected surfactants such as mid-chain branched surfactants typically include other ingredients such as builders, enzymes and the like which can have deleterious effects on the overall cleaning performance of the composition. To that end, a need continues to exist for a detergent composition which exhibits improved performance, especially at low temperature wash water and under relatively high water hardness conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
U.S. 3,480,556 to deWitt, et al., November 25, 1969, EP 439,316, published by Lever July 31, 1991, and EP 684,300, published by Lever November 29, 1995, describe beta-branched alkyl sulfates. EP 439,316 describes certain laundry detergents containing a specific commercial C14/C15 branched primary alkyl sulfate, namely LIAL 145 sulfate. This is believed to have 61% branching in the 2-position; 30% of this involves branching with a hydrocarbon chain having four or more carbon atoms. U.S. 3,480,556 describes mixtures of from 10 to 90 parts of a straight chain primary alkyl sulfate and from 90 to 10 parts of a beta branched (2-position branched) primary alcohol sulfate of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the total number of carbon atoms ranges from 12 to 20 and Rl is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 9 to 17 carbon atoms and R2 is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 1 to 9 carbon atoms (67% 2-methyl and 33% 2-ethyl branching is exemplified).<br>
As noted hereinbefore, R.G. Laughlin in "The Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants", Academic Press, N.Y. (1994) p. 347 describes the observation that as branching moves away from the 2-alkyl position towards the center of the alkyl hydrophobe there is a lowering of Krafft temperatures. See also Finger et al., "Detergent alcohols - the effect of alcohol structure and molecular weight on surfactant properties", J. Amer. Oil Chemists' Society, Vol. 44, p. 525 (1967) and Technical Bulletin, Shell Chemical Co., SC: 364-80.<br>
EP 342,917 A, Unilever, published Nov. 23, 1989 describes laundry detergents containing a surfactant system in which the major anionic surfactant is an alkyl sulfate having an assertedly "wide range" of alkyl chain lengths (the experimental appears to involve mixing coconut and tallow chain length surfactants).<br>
U.S. Patent 4,102,823 and GB 1,399,966 describe other laundry compositions containing conventional alkyl sulfates.<br>
G.B. Patent 1,299,966, Matheson et al., published July 2, 1975, discloses a detergent composition in which the surfactant system is comprised of a mixture of sodium tallow alkyl sulfate and nonionic surfactants.<br>
Methyl- substituted sulfates include the known "isostearyl" sulfates; these are typically mixtures of isomeric sulfates having a total of 18 carbon atoms. For example, EP 401,462 A, assigned to Henkel, published December 12, 1990, describes certain isostearyl alcohols and ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and their sulfation to produce the corresponding alkyl sulfates such as sodium isostearyl sulfate. See also K.R. Wormuth and S. Zushma, Langmuir, Vol. 7, (1991), pp 2048-2053 (technical studies on a number of branched alkyl sulfates, especially the "branched Guerbet" type); R. Varadaraj et al., J. Phys. Chem., Vol. 95, (1991), pp 1671-1676 (which describes the surface tensions of a variety of "linear Guerbet" and "branched Guerbet"- class surfactants including alkyl sulfates); Varadaraj et al., J. Colloid and Interface Sci., Vol. 140, (1990), pp 31-34 (relating to foaming data for surfactants which include C12 and C13 alkyl sulfates containing 3 and 4 methyl branches, respectively); and Varadaraj et al., Langmuir, Vol. 6 (1990), pp 1376-1378 (which describes the micropolarity of aqueous micellar solutions of surfactants including branched alkyl sulfates).<br>
"Linear Guerbet" alcohols are available from Henkel, e.g., EUTANOL G-16.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a detergent composition, preferably granular, which contains a mid-chain branched surfactant as detailed hereinafter and an assortment of other surfactants which have been judiciously selected for inclusion in the detergent composition to render optimal performance. Specifically, the composition includes a linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant which can have a variety of chain lengths as detailed hereinafter, the aforementioned mid-chain branched surfactant, and a linear alkyl sulfate surfactant. It has been found that by including such surfactants in selected weight ratios, unexpectedly superior cleaning performance is achieved by the composition of the invention. Unexpectedly, it has also been found that the relative levels of nonionic surfactant, such as alkyl ethoxylate, in the composition can be reduced without negatively impacting performance. Although optional, it has also unexpectedly been found that detergent composition of the invention can be substantially free of alkyl ethoxylate and alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactants without deleteriously affecting the overall cleaning performance of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of said linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant to said mid-chain branched surfactant is from about 1:3 to about 4:1, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 3:1, most preferably from about 2:1 to about 3:1. Additionally, the weight ratio of the linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant to the linear alkyl sulfate surfactant is from about 2:1 to about 20:1, more preferably from about 4:1 to about 10:1, most preferably from about 5:1 to about 8:1. The detergent composition of the invention also includes up to about 5% by weight of an alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant and up to about 5% of an alkyl ethoxylate surfactant, preferably from about 0.01% to about 4%, most preferably from about 0.1% to about 3%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Optionally, the detergent composition of the invention can include adjunct detergent ingredients selected from the group consisting of builders, enzymes, fillers, brighteners, bleaching agents and mixtures thereof. Preferred adjunct detergent ingredients are selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, polyacrylate and mixtures thereof. Additional preferred adjunct detergent ingredients are selected from the group consisting of builders, enzymes, fillers, brighteners, bleaching agents and mixtures thereof.<br>
The surfactant system of the composition includes a mid-chain branched surfactant as follows. In such surfactants, certain points of branching (e.g., the location along the chain of the R, R1, and/or R2 moieties in the above formula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl branched alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>
more preferred rang — preferred range<br>
mid-chain branching:<br>
It should be noted that for the mono-methyl substituted surfactants these ranges exclude the two terminal carbon atoms of the chain and the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the -X - B group.<br>
The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for di-methyl substituted alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The preferred branched surfactant compositions useful in detergent compositions according to the present invention are described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
Mid-chain Branched Primary Alkvl Sulfate Surfactants<br>
The present invention branched surfactant-containing compositions may comprise two or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants having the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkyl sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon primary alkyl sulfate surfactant having 13 carbon atoms in the backbone must have 1, 2, or 3 branching units (i.e., R, R1and/or R2) whereby total number of carbon atoms in the molecule is at least 16. In this example, the C16 total carbon requirement may be satisfied equally by having, for example, one propyl branching unit or three methyl branching units.<br>
R, Rl, and R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or C1-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, Rl, and R2 are not all hydrogen. Further, when z is 1, at least R or R1 is not hydrogen.<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R1 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-branched primary alkyl sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br><br>
Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol may comprise some amount of the present invention compositions. Such materials may be present as the result of incomplete sulfation of the alcohol used to prepare the alkyl sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols may be separately added to the present invention detergent compositions along with a mid-chain branched alkyl sulfate surfactant according to the present invention.<br>

wherein the total number of carbon atoms, including branching, is from 15 to 18, and wherein further for this surfactant mixture the average total number of carbon atoms in the<br>
branched primary alkyl moieties having the above formula is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5; R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl; M is a water soluble cation; x is from 0 to 11; y is from 0 to 11; z is at least 2; and x + y + z is from 9 to 13; provided R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen. More preferred are compositions having at least 5% of the mixture comprising one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates wherein x + y is equal to 9 and z is at least 2.<br>
Preferably, the mixtures of surfactant comprise at least 5% of a mid chain branched primary alkyl sulfate having R1 and R2 independently hydrogen, methyl, provided R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen; x + y is equal to 8, 9, or 10 and z is at least 2.

The present invention branched surfactant-containing compositions may comprise one or more (preferably a mixture of two or more) mid-chain branched primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfates having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkoxylated sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the alkoxy-sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one alkoxylated sulfate compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>

Further it is to be similarly recognized that non-sulfated mid-chain branched alcohol (including polyoxyalkylene alcohols) may comprise some amount of the present invention alkoxylated sulfate-containing compositions.

Antistatic agents which provide some softening benefit and which are preferred herein are the quaternary ammonium salts described in U.S. Patent 3,936,537, Baskerville, Jr. et al., issued February 3, 1976, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Adjunct Detergent Ingredients<br>
The detergent composition of the invention can include one or more adjunct detergent ingredients as discussed herein. The compositions of the invention can contain all manner of organic, water-soluble detergent compounds, inasmuch as the builder material are compatible with all such materials. In addition to a detersive surfactant, at least one suitable adjunct detergent ingredient is preferably included in the detergent composition. The adjunct detergent ingredient is preferably selected from the group consisting of builders, enzymes, bleaching agents, bleach activators, suds suppressors, soil release agents, brighteners, perfumes, hydrotropes, dyes, pigments, polymeric dispersing agents, pH controlling agents, chelants, processing aids, crystallization aids, and mixtures thereof. The following list of detergent ingredients and mixtures thereof which can be used in the compositions herein is representative of the detergent ingredients, but is not intended to be limiting.<br>
One or more builders can be used in conjunction with the builder material described herein to further improve the performance of the compositions described herein. For example, the builder can be selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, crystalline layered silicates, MAP zeolites, citrates, amorphous silicates, polycarboxylates, sodium carbonates and mixtures thereof. The sodium carbonate ingredient can serve as the inorganic alkaline material when a liquid acid precursor of the mid-chain branched surfactant is used. Other suitable auxiliary builders are described hereinafter.<br>
Preferred builders include aluminosilicate ion exchange materials and sodium carbonate. The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein as a detergent builder preferably have both a high calcium ion exchange capacity and a high exchange rate. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity are a function of several interrelated factors which derive from the method by which the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is produced. In that regard, the aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are preferably produced in accordance with Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509 (Procter &amp; Gamble), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is in "sodium" form since the potassium and hydrogen forms of the instant aluminosilicate do not exhibit the as high of an exchange rate and capacity as provided by the sodium form. Additionally, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material preferably is in over dried form so as to facilitate production of crisp detergent agglomerates as described herein. The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein preferably have particle size diameters which optimize their effectiveness as detergent builders. The term "particle size diameter" as used herein represents the average particle size diameter of a given aluminosilicate ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques, such as microscopic determination and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preferred particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate is from about 0.1 micron to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.5 microns to about 9 microns. Most preferably, the particle size diameter is from about 1 microns to about 8 microns.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is from about 1 to about 5 and x is from about 10 to about 264. More preferably, the aluminosilicate has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, preferably about 27. These preferred aluminosilicates are available commercially, for example under designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B and Zeolite X. Alternatively, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived aluminosilicate ion exchange materials suitable for use herein can be made as described in Krummel et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,985,669, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aluminosilicates used herein are further characterized by their ion exchange capacity which is at least about 200 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram, calculated on an anhydrous basis, and which is preferably in a range from about 300 to 352 mg<br>
equivalent of CaCCO3 hardness/gram. Additionally, the instant aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are still further characterized by their calcium ion exchange rate which is at least about 2 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon, and more preferably in a range from about 2 grains Ca++gallon/minuteAgram/gallon to about 6 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon .<br>
