Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to a method for organizing and<br>
displaying a multiple user database, and more specifically to an application executable<br>
in an electronic device.<br>
Background Art<br>
The falling prices and increased competition in the Personal Digital Assistant<br>
("PDA") business are aiding the development of the next group or family of<br>
applications for these organizers. Most PDAs and other mobile electronic organizers<br>
in the market place support calendar and other personal management and organization<br>
functions. World wide web, or Internet, applications, which can support larger<br>
display screens and provide users with more pleasing viewing experience, are<br>
becoming more common. Some organizers can be synchronized with other devices<br>
such as another personal computer ("PC") or another compatible organizer, allowing<br>
the user to import a calendar and other organization and management files from the<br>
other device. The synchronized files then can be displayed on the screen of the<br>
mobile electronic organizer using contrasting colors to differentiate one file from<br>
another. However, applications currently available do not distinguish between<br>
relevant and irrelevant events relative to the user. When a first user synchronizes his<br>
mobile electronic organizer with a second user, and displays both schedules on the<br>
screen, the screen may be filled with the second user's scheduled events that are of no<br>
interest to the first user. Even with a large screen on a PDA, cluttered and undesired<br>
information displayed would be unwelcome.<br>
With a growing popularity of wireless devices such as cellular telephones, it is<br>
conceivable that every member of a family will have a cellular telephone having a<br><br>
capability of a mobile electronic organizer, and keep his schedule on his cellular telephone. For<br>
example, a mother may wish to see on her mobile electronic organizer a schedule of only when and<br>
where she needs to be to pick up her children in addition to her own personal schedule. However, each<br>
child may keep in his mobile electronic organizer his personal schedule such as school homework<br>
reminder, TV show schedule, play time, etc. in addition to when and where his mother needs to be to<br>
pick him up. If the mother synchronized her mobile electronic organizer with the mobile electronic<br>
organizers of her children, and displayed on her screen all the scheduled events on her mobile<br>
electronic organizer, the screen might become so cluttered such that it might not be so useful.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a method for organizing a plurality of calendar<br>
events by providing an appearance of a single user calendar on an electronic device, the method<br>
comprising acquiring the plurality of calendar events; synchronizing the plurality of calendar events;<br>
selecting a display preference for the plurality of calendar events by selecting a reference user;<br>
selecting a reference category; grouping calendar events that belong to the reference user and to the<br>
reference category; determining whether each of the plurality of calendar events belongs to the<br>
reference user; determining whether each of the plurality of calendar events belongs to the reference<br>
category; determining whether a calendar event detail setting has been disabled; and allowing to<br>
display a message associated with each of the grouped calendar events and to display only the category<br>
of the calendar event belonging to a user other than the reference user and belonging to the reference<br>
category upon determining that the calendar event detail setting has been disabled or enabled; and<br>
displaying at least one calendar event of the plurality of calendar events on the electronic device based<br>
upon the display preference.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention describes a method for organizing and displaying a<br>
multiple user data base to give an appearance of a single user calendar on an<br>
electronic device such as, but not limited to a portable electronic communication<br>
device, a personal computer ("PC"), a personal digital assistant ("PDA"), and a<br>
television set. Each calendar event is organized by its user such as mother, father, son<br>
or daughter and its category, such as, self, family, and work. The present invention<br>
allows a user to create his or her own associations with other users within the same<br>
categories as well as allowing to create associations among the categories. Calendar<br>
events from multiple users are collected into a single device. Desired calendar events,<br>
identified by the corresponding user (mother, father, son or daughter), category (work,<br>
family and self), and the user's association with other users within each category, are<br>
displayed with various visual attributes to differentiate calendar events belonging to<br>
different users. Calendar events of a reference user may be displayed with associated<br>
comments while calendar events of other users may be generalized. Although the<br>
terms "calendar" and "calendar event" are used throughout the description, these<br>
terms are intended to include, but not limited to, to-do and event listings, schedules,<br>
and other information to be managed.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary environment 100 in which the present<br>
invention may be practiced. Each of multiple users, associated with a device (first,<br>
second, third, and fourth devices, 102,104,106, and 108, respectively, are shown),<br>
keeps his or her calendar in his or her device. Alternatively, all the users may use the<br>
same single device with each user maintaining his or her own calendar within the<br>
device. Each of FIGs. 2-5 illustrates an exemplary calendar showing the structure and<br>
calendar events of the first, second, third, and fourth users, respectively. In this<br>
example, family members and their scheduled events, or calendar events, are used to<br>
illustrate the calendar structure. FIG. 2 illustrates the calendar 200 of the first user,<br>
Mother, in the first device 102; FIG. 3 the calendar 300 of the second user, Father, in<br>
the second device 104; FIG. 4 the calendar 400 of the third user, Daughter, in the third<br>
device 106; and FIG. 5 the calendar 500 of the fourth user, Son, in the fourth device<br>
108. Each calendar event has attributes comprising; a message, a user, a category,<br><br>
comments, and a time period associated with it. For example, in FIG. 2, the user is<br>
Mother 202, and categories are Self 204, Family 206, and Work 208. Each calendar<br>
event is associated with Time 210, and some calendar events include comment (212,<br>
214, and 216 shown in parentheses next to messages 218,220, and 222, respectively).<br>
FIG. 6 is an exemplary block diagram 600 illustrating organization of the<br>
present invention. Each user may create his or her own associations of categories. For<br>
example, Mother creates a first association set 602. Within the first association set,<br>
Mother has defined a first category set 604 to be Family having association member<br>
set 606 comprising Mother, Father, Daughter, and Son as association members.<br>
Mother has also defined a second category set 608 to be Work and third category set<br>
610 to be Self, each respectively having association member set 612 comprising<br>
Mother and Daughter as association members, and 614 comprising Mother as<br>
association member. Son also creates his own set, a second association set 616.<br>
Within the second association set, Son has defined a fourth category set 618 to be<br>
Play having association member set 620 comprising Son and John as association<br>
members. This category set is unique to Son, and may not appear in other user's<br>
categories. Alternatively, when all calendars are stored on a single device the<br>
associations may be preset in the device. For example, all users may be considered a<br>
member of all of the other users' Family category.<br>
When a reference user is selected, the calendar events are displayed in a<br>
manner that is meaningful to the reference user. For example, if Mother is selected to<br>
be the reference user, and her Family category set is displayed, then the appearance of<br>
the calendar events may be different from the appearance of the calendar events<br>
preferred and set by Father for the same category. Mother, the reference user, is also<br>
allowed to select the level of detail of the calendar events belonging to the association<br>
members to be displayed.<br>
FIG. 7 is an exemplary flowchart illustrating an aspect of the present<br>
invention. In block 704, the first device 102 acquires the calendar events from the<br>
second, third, and fourth devices 104,106, and 108, respectively. Alternatively,<br>
individual calendars residing in a single device may be combined into a single<br>
calendar. In this example, Mother, associated with the first device, collects the<br>
calendar events of her family members from their corresponding devices: Father with<br><br>
the second device, Daughter with the third device, and Son with the fourth device. In<br>
step 706, all the calendar events are synchronized within the first device. For example,<br>
all 8:00 PM events are recognized and referenced as 8:00 PM events while<br>
maintaining the associated users and categories; all Self category events are<br>
recognized and referenced as Self category events while maintaining the associated<br>
users and time periods. To give an appearance of a single user calendar, the calendar<br>
events need to be displayed in an organized way. In block 708, a display preference is<br>
selected and the calendar events are grouped based upon the selected display<br>
preference in block 710. The grouped calendar events are then displayed on the first<br>
device in block 712, and the process terminates in block 714. The display preference<br>
may be based upon any or combination of the attributes attached to the calendar<br>
events such as, time, user, category, message, and comments.<br>
FIG. 8 further illustrates the display preference of block 708. After all<br>
calendar events are synchronized in block 706, each calendar event may be assigned a<br>
priority level in block 802, and then events having the same priority level are grouped<br>
together such that the events are recognized by the priority level in block 804.<br>
Assigning of a priority level to each calendar event may be based upon any or<br>
combination of its associated time, user, category, message, and comment. A desired<br>
priority level is then selected in block 806 which identifies events having the desired<br>
priority level as the events to be displayed in block 712.<br>
FIG. 9 is an exemplary flowchart further illustrating the display preference<br>
selection of block 708. In block 902 a reference user is selected from available users<br>
such as Mother, Father, Daughter, and Son, and in step 904 a reference category is<br>
selected from available categories such as Self 204, Family 206, and Work 208. In<br>
block 906, a calendar event from the synchronized events is selected, and whether the<br>
selected event belongs to the reference user is determined in block 908. If the selected<br>
event does not belong to the reference user, then whether the selected event belongs to<br>
the reference category is determined in block 910. If the selected event does not<br>
belong to the reference category, then only the category of the selected event is made<br>
available to be displayed in block 912. Then in block 914 whether there are more<br>
events to be processed is determined. If there are more events to be processed, then<br><br>
next event is selected in block 916, and the process repeats from block 908. If there<br>
are no more events to be processed, then the process proceeds to block 710.<br>
If in block 910, the selected event is determined to belong to the reference<br>
category, then in block 918 whether the details of the selected event are to be shown<br>
for other users is determined. For example, details may be shown if the user<br>
associated with the selected event is classified as a member of the reference user's<br>
reference category. Details of the selected event may be made viewable based upon<br>
other criteria such as, but not limited to, display preferences applicable only to<br>
specific users. For example, Mother may desire to view details of all of Father's<br>
events, but may desire to view only the categories of Daughter's events, and to view<br>
categories and messages of Son's events. If the details are not to be shown, then only<br>
 the category of the selected event is made available to be displayed in step 912. Then<br>
in block 914 whether there are more events to be processed is determined. The details<br>
of the selected event may be deemed to be displayed if the selected event belongs to<br>
the reference category and, the user associated with the selected event is associated<br>
with the reference user's reference category. If there are more events to be processed,<br>
then next event is selected in block 916, and the process repeats from block 908. If<br>
there are no more events to be processed, then the process proceeds to block 710.<br>
However, if the details are determined to be shown in block 918, then only the<br>
message of the selected event is made available to be displayed in block 920. Then in<br>
block 914 whether there are more events to be processed is determined. If there are<br>
more events to be processed, then next event is selected in block 916, and the process<br>
repeats from block 908. If there are no more events to be processed, then the process<br>
proceeds to block 710.<br>
If the selected event is determined to belong to the reference user in block 908,<br>
then whether the selected event belongs to the reference category is determined in<br>
block 922. If the selected event does not belong to the reference category, then only<br>
the category of the selected event is made available to be displayed in block 912.<br>
Then in block 914 whether there are more events to be processed is determined. If<br>
there are more events to be processed, then next event is selected in block 916, and<br>
the process repeats from block 908. If there are no more events to be processed, then<br>
the process proceeds to block 710.<br><br>
If the selected event is determined to belong to the reference category in block<br>
922, then whether the comment of the selected event is to be displayed is determined<br>
in block 924. The comment may be set to be displayed based upon a specific setting<br>
for an individual event, category, and user, or the time remaining to the specific event,<br>
or any combination of the above mentioned. For example, the event comment 314<br>
"make 5 copies" may appear as "copies" a week prior to the event, and as the event<br>
approaches and becomes a higher priority to the user, it may appear as the full<br>
comment "make 5 copies." If the comment of the selected event is not to be<br>
displayed, then only the message of the selected event is made available to be<br>
displayed in block 920. Then in block 914 whether there are more events to be<br>
processed is determined. If there are more events to be processed, then next event is<br>
selected in block 916, and the process repeats from block 908. If there are no more<br>
events to be processed, then the process proceeds to block 710. If the comment of the<br>
selected event is to be displayed, then the message and comment of the selected event<br>
are made available to be displayed in block 926. Then in block 914 whether there are<br>
more events to be processed is determined. If there are more events to be processed,<br>
then next event is selected in block 916, and the process repeats from block 908. If<br>
there are no more events to be processed, then the process proceeds to block 710.<br>
FIG. 10 is an exemplary flowchart 1000 illustrating organization of multiple<br>
events in a single time period. The calendar events grouped in block 710 may further<br>
be organized based upon their equivalency with each other. In block 1002, a first<br>
time period is selected, and whether more than one calendar event exists in this single<br>
time period is determined in block 1004. If there is only one event in the time period,<br>
then no further organization is necessary, and whether there is another time period to<br>
be considered is determined in block 1006. If there are no more time periods to be<br>
considered, then the process proceeds to block 712. If there is more time period to be<br>
considered, then the next time period is selected in block 1008, and the process<br>
repeats from block 1004.<br>
If it is determined in block 1004 that there are multiple calendar events in the<br>
selected time period, then whether equivalent calendar events, or duplicate calendar<br>
events, exist in the selected time period is determined in block 1010. If there are no<br>
equivalent calendar events, then all the calendar events in the selected time period are<br><br>
considered to be distinct, and multiple calendar events are created for the selected<br>
time period in block 1012. Then whether there is another time period to be<br>
considered is determined in block 1006. If there are no more time periods to be<br>
considered, then the process proceeds to block 712. If there is more time period to be<br>
considered, then the next time period is selected in block 1008, and the process<br>
repeats from block 1004.<br>
If it is determined in block 1010 that there are equivalent calendar events, then<br>
the number of equivalent calendar events may be determined and a single calendar<br>
event, representing multiple equivalent events, is composed with an indicator for<br>
multiplicity in block 1014. The indicator may be one or more symbols, numbers or<br>
text identifying the number of equivalent events. Additional text descriptions may<br>
include abbreviations or other forms of text to identify individuals with the same<br>
event as the reference user. For example, all users have the "Movie" event at 8:00<br>
PM with the category of Family. If Mother were to view the Family category, in the<br>
8:00 PM time period, the equivalent events may be represented as "Movie (4)" with<br>
"(4)" indicating the number of duplicate events. Then whether there are calendar<br>
events remaining in the selected time period that are not equivalent is determined in<br>
block 1016. If there are no more calendar events, then whether there is another time<br>
period to be considered is.determined in block 1006. If there are no more time<br>
periods to be considered, then the process proceeds to block 712. If there is more<br>
time period to be considered, then the next time period is selected in block 1008, and<br>
the process repeats from block 1004.<br>
If it is determined in block 1016 that there are calendar events that are non-<br>
equivalent, then multiple calendar events, one representing equivalent calendar events<br>
and all non-equivalent calendar events, are created for the selected time period in<br>
block 1012. Then whether there is another time period to be considered is<br>
determined in block 1006. If there are no more time periods to be considered, then<br>
the process proceeds to block 712. If there is more time period to be considered, then<br>
the next time period is selected in block 1008, and the process repeats from block<br>
1004.<br>
To differentiate and to identify the user associated with a calendar event, each<br>
user may be assigned a visual attribute that is different from other users. The visual<br><br>
attribute may be, but not limited to, contrast and color of the calendar events specific<br>
to a particular user. For example, Mother's calendar events may be red, Father's blue,<br>
Daughter's green, and Son's yellow.<br>
FIG. 11 is a first exemplary composite calendar 1100 of the present invention<br>
using the calendar events illustrated in FIGs. 2-5 with the display preference set to<br>
display only events in the Work category 208. In this example, Mother is selected as<br>
the reference user in block 902 resulting in the Work category associations 612 being<br>
displayed on the first device 102. Only three users, Mother, Father, and Daughter, are<br>
involved in this composite calendar, because Son has no Work category events. The<br>
users are distinguished from each other by each having a different visual attribute:<br>
Mother having a first background (1102), Father having a second background (1104),<br>
and Daughter having a third background (1106). In the composite calendar 1100, the<br>
messages 220 and 222 of Mother's events are shown with their associated comments<br>
214 and 216 as previously shown in FIG. 2. The comment 232 for Mother's 11:00 am<br>
event has been suppressed resulting in only the message 230 being displayed for that<br>
event because Mother had initially set to suppress the comment when the event was<br>
entered. Because Daughter is not the reference user, only the message 410 is<br>
viewable and the associated comment 412 is suppressed for the event belonging to<br>
Daughter. Neither the messages 308 and 310 nor comment 314 belonging to Father is<br>
displayed since the father is not one of Mother's association members 612 for the<br>
reference category. However, even though Father is not an association member,<br>
Mother, as the reference user, is able to set an option to display messages for Work<br>
events belonging to Father after 3 p.m., and have such messages displayed as shown<br>
312.<br>
FIG. 12 is a second exemplary composite calendar 1200 of the present<br>
invention using the calendar events illustrated in FIGs. 2-5 with the display preference<br>
set to display only events in the Work category 208 as the reference category. In this<br>
example, Mother is selected as the reference user resulting in the Work category<br>
associations 612 being displayed on the first device 102. Whereas the composite<br>
calendar 1100 was restricted to display only events belonging to the Work category,<br>
the composite calendar 1200 is configured to display representations of all acquired in<br>
block 704. All four users are involved in the composite calendar 1200 who are<br><br>
distinguished by having a different visual attribute: Mother having a first background<br>
1102, Father having a second background 1104, Daughter having a third background<br>
1106, and Son having a fourth background 1202. All events previously shown in the<br>
composite calendar 1100 are also shown in the composite calendar 1200 using the<br>
same display preferences applied in the composite calendar 1100. In the composite<br>
calendar 1200, any calendar event not belonging to the reference category, Work 208,<br>
is represented by its associated category. For example, Mother's tennis message 218)<br>
with a comment 212 is represented as Self 1204, its associated category. Similarly,<br>
all her non-Work events 224,226, and 228 are represented by their associated<br>
categories 1206,1208, and 1210, respectively. Except for the 4:00 p.m. event 312 for<br>
which the previous display preference is applied, all Father's events, 228, 304, 306,<br>
308, and 310 are similarly represented by their associated categories, 1210,1212,<br>
1214,1216, and 1218, respectively. Except for her Work event 410, all Daughter's<br>
events, 228, 404, and 406, are also represented by their associated categories, 1210,<br>
1220, and 1222, respectively. All of Son's events, 228, 504, and 506 are represented<br>
by their associated categories, 1210,1224, and 1226, respectively. Multiple event<br>
entries within the same time period are organized according to the procedure outlined<br>
in FIG. 10. For example, at the 4:00 p.m. time period, each of the four users has a<br>
different event, and each of these events are shown as 1206,312,410, and 1224.<br>
Multiple equivalent events within the same time period belonging to the same<br>
category are also displayed according to the procedure outlined in FIG. 10. For<br>
example, on the composite calendar 1200, the event Movie 228, which - is placed on<br>
all the individual calendars 200,300,400 and 500 under the Family category 206, is<br>
labeled with the term Family 1210 with the number "4" 1228 representing the number<br>
of occurrences of this event among the individual calendars. Multiple equivalent<br>
events, such as Movie 228, may comprise a combination of unique visual attributes,<br>
such as colors and backgrounds, which indicates who the members of the equivalent<br>
event are.<br>
While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br><br>

METHOD FOR ORGANIZING A PLURALITY OF CALENDAR<br>
EVENTS BY PROVIDING AN APPEARANCE OF A SINGLE<br>
USER CALENDAR ON AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE<br>
A method for organizing and displaying multiple calendars (200, 300, 400, and 500)<br>
from multiple devices (102, 104, 106, and 108) to give an appearance of a single user<br>
calendar (1100 and 1200) on a user's device is disclosed. Each calendar event having<br>
associated user category such as time (210), self (204), family (206), and work (208), is<br>
organized based on a display preference selected by a user. Desired calendar events<br>
organized based on the display preference are displayed (1100, 1200) on a selected device.<br>
Calendar events displayed have different visual attributes based on the corresponding<br>
associated users.</td>
