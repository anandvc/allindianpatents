				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of high purity escitalopram. Escitalopram ((S)-l-[3(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitriIe) is the S-enantiomer ((+)-isomer) of the well-known antidepressant drug citalopram having the formula-I given below. Escitalopram was found to be more active than the dl-citalopram or the R-citalopram.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Citalopram, which has been disclosed in DE Patent no. 2,657,013 (1977) corresponding to US Patent no. 4,136,193 (1979) is a well-known antidepressant drug available in the market for some years. It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, is accordingly having the antidepressant activity. The antidepressant activity of citalopram has been reported in several publications, e.g. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-Psychophannacol &amp; Biol. Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987,75,478-486.<br>
The basic process for the preparation of citalopram described in the above-referred patents involves two major routes illustrated in Scheme-1 and Scheme-2. Major difference in these two routes is introduction of dimethylaminopropyl side chain at an early stage (Scheme-1) or at a later stage (Scheme- 2).<br><br>
In the first route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-II is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get the benzophenone derivative of the formula-IIL This benzophenone derivative is reacted with 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride to get the dihydroxy intermediate of the formula-IV.<br><br>
Cyclization of the compound of the formula-IV with an acid catalyst resulted in the formation of phthalane derivative of the formula-V. This bromophthalane derivative is reacted with copper (I) cyanide to get the citalopram base of the formula-!.<br><br>
In the second route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-II is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get the corresponding benzophenone derivative of the formula-Ill.<br><br>
This compound of the formula-Ill is reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to get the dihydroxy compound of the formula-VI, which is cyclized with an acid catalyst to get the phthalane derivative of the formula-VII. The bromo group is replaced with a cyano group and alkylated with the required side chain to get the citalopram base of the formula-I.<br><br>
Another method for the preparation of citalopram base of the formula-I and a novel intermediate useful for the preparation of citalopram was disclosed in US Pat. No. 4,650,884, according to which 5-cyanophthalide of formula-IX is reacted successively with p-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide and 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride to get the compound of the formula-XI which is reacted with 70% sulfuric acid to get the citalopram base (Scheme-3).<br><br>
Process for the preparation of escitalopram is disclosed in U. S. Pat. No, 4,943,590, According to this patent, attempts to crystallize the diastereomeric salts of citalopram enantiomers have failed. In this patent a process for the preparation of escitalopram was described by resolving the intermediate (compound of the formula-XI) of citalopram and ring closure of the resolved intermediate in a stereospecific manner to get the escitalopram (Scheme-4).<br><br><br>
The main drawback in this process is the purity of the intermediate compound of the formula-XI obtained in the Grignard reaction, which is of 80-90% only. The crude compound of formula-XI needs extensive purification before proceeding for resolution. The purification technique given in the above patent process involves repeated charcoal and silica gel treatment to the compound of the formula-XI or its HBr salt. Also, during the HBr salt formation of compound of the formula-XI, the amount of HBr used in the process should be less than the molar quantity to avoid additional impurities formation. As the impurities present in the intermediate compound of the formula-XI have closely related properties such a purification technique is not viable on a commercial scale to make this intermediate and also the escitalopram. Also, the overall yield of escitalopram given in this patent is only 8.8% starting from 5-cyanophthalide of the formula-IX. Therefore such a low yielding process needs to be improved for commercial production of escitalopram.<br><br>
Recently a process for the preparation of escitalopram is disclosed in WO 03/0006449. According to the method given in this patent intermediates of dl-citalopram were separated into the individual enantiomers by chromatographic method and converted to escitalopram. The main drawback in this process is the availability of chiral stationary phase on bulk scale and its implementation on a commercialization. Output from such a process will also be low.<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned process for the preparation of escitalopram, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of escitalopram.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
We observed that a promising approach for a process for the preparation of escitalopram would be to (a) avoid the usage of 5-cyanophthalide as starting material (b) avoid the purification of intermediates involved in making escitalopram thereby making the process commercially viable and economical (c) develop an efficient method for the conversion of intermediates into escitalopram.<br>
Focusing on these points we developed an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram and filed a patent recently (052 /MAS/ 2003). According to the process (Scheme-5) disclosed in the said patent application, 5-bromophthaIide is subjected to double Grignard reaction and the resulting dimagnesium salt of formula-XIV is isolated by fihration. By doing so we could remove all the related impurities present in the reaction mass and get the required compound of formula-IV in more than 98% purity after neutralization of salt. The dihydroxy intermediate thus obtained was resolved into its isomers by treating with a resolving agent. The resolved intermediate of formula-XVI was cyclized to the bromo derivative of formula-XVII and finally this bromo intermediate was converted to escitalopram base by treating it with copper cyanide. The quality of escitalopram obtained by this procedure was found to be more than 97%. The main impurity present in this compound is the starting bromo compound. Removal of this<br><br><br><br>
less than 0.1% level led to very poor yield. Also the yield of escitalopram decreased with increasing scale.<br>
During our sustained research to overcome this problem we found that the basicity of dimethylamino group present in bromo compound is the main cause for poor rate of reaction and poor yield in scale up. To reduce the influence of the dimethylamino group present in the bromo compound during cyanation, we aimed to reduce the basicity of the bromo compound of formula-XVII by converting it into a salt.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram from the corresponding bromo compound of formula-XVII, which is commercially applicable.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram by protecting the dimethylamino group present in the bromo intermediate of formula-XVII in its salt form during cyanation step.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to keep the level of bromo intermediate of formula-XVII at less than 0.1% level in the reaction mass during the cyanation step thereby avoiding the purification step involved during the isolation of escitalopram.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides improved process for the preparation of escitalopram of formula-I,<br><br><br>
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts which comprises: (i) Conversion of the bromo intermediate of formula-XVII,<br><br>
using an acid HX where X represents an organic or inorganic moiety .<br>

(v)       Extracting the escitalopram base into a weak aqueous organic acid . (vi)      Neutralizing the resuhing aqueous organic acid layer with a weak organic<br>
base, (vii)    Extracting the pure escitalopram base into an ether or hydrocarbon solvent, (viii)    Removing the solvent to get pure escitalopram and if desired, (ix)      Preparing the pharmaceutically acceptable salts by conventional methods.<br><br>

The hiflow bed was washed with 200ml of toluene. Filtrate was taken into a separating funnel and the toluene layer separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with toluene (200ml). The combined organic layer was washed with water. The organic layer was extracted with 10% aqueous acetic acid (300ml and 200ml). The combined aqueous acetic acid layer was treated with charcoal (10gr) and filtered. Aqueous ammonia was added to the filtrate to get a pH of 8.5-9.0. The product was extracted into isopropyl ether (1 x 300ml, 2 X 100ml) and the solvent distilled off to get 60gr (87%) of dl-citalopram base as white crystalline solid. Mehing point is 92-93°C. Purity by HPLC was found to be &gt;99%. Bromo compound is less than 0.1%.<br>
Example 8 Preparation of escitalopram oxalate<br>
Into a 500ml three-necked RB flask was charged 50gr of escitalopram base and 250ml of acetone. The solution was stirred for 5min and treated with 25gr of oxalic acid dihydrate. Crystals began to form soon after the addition of oxalic acid. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3hrs at room temperature and filtered the solid. The wet solid thus obtained was suspended in isopropyl alcohol (1300ml) and heated to reflux temperature. After maintaining for 30min a clear solution formed. Activated carbon (5gr) was added to the reaction mass filtered while hot. The filtrate was slowly allowed to reach 45-50°C and maintained at this temperature for 2hrs. The reaction mass was filtered and the cake washed with 50ml of isopropyl alcohol. Drying of the wet cake at 50°C for 2hrs gave the title compound as white crystalline solid (60gr). HPLC purity of the product is 99.8%.<br><br>
