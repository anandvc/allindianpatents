				<td>RUBBER EXTRUDER<br>
This invention relates to a rubber extruder, more particularly to a rubber extruder with a screw rod for extruding a rubber or rubber-like material from the rubber extruder.<br>
Conventional rubber extruders (see Fig. 1) normally include a cylindrical barrel 1.1 adapted to receive a rubber or rubber-like material therein, and a hydraulic operated ram 121 disposed movably in a hydraulic cylinder 12 and extending into the cylindrical barrel 11 for extruding the rubber material through an extrusion die (not shown). A cutter 13 is disposed downstream of the extrusion die for periodically cutting the resultant extruded material into pieces of extrudate of equal dimensions .â€¢<br>
Since the hydraulic operated ram 121 is made from metal, it will be subjected to expansion or contraction as a result of variation of the temperature of hydraulic oil entering into the hydraulic cylinder 12, thereby affecting the advancing speed of the hydraulic operated ram 121. As a consequence, the advancing speed of the extrudate is correspondingly affected, thereby resulting in non-uniform dimensions of the pieces of the extrudate. In addition, the resistance to advancing movement of the hydraulic operated ram 121 is higher when a higher<br><br>
amount of the rubber material is present in the barrel 11. As such, the advancing speed of the hydraulic operated ram 121 will vary along with the variation of the amount of the rubber material present in the barrel 11. Moreover, the hydraulic oil for driving the hydraulic operated ram 121 is required to be periodically replaced with fresh hydraulic oil, and has to be disposed according to the requirements of local environmental regulations.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a rubber extruder with a screw rod that is capable of overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a rubber extruder that comprises: a fixed cylindrical barrel adapted to receive a rubber material and having a die end and an opposite end opposite to the die end; an extrusion die mounted in the die end of the cylindrical barrel; a screw rod having an inner section that extends co-axially through the opposite end of the cylindrical barrel and into the cylindrical barrel and that has an abutting end adapted to abut against the rubber material, and an outer section that extends axially from the inner section and that is disposed outwardly of the cylindrical barrel, the screw rod being movable in an axial direction relative to the cylindrical barrel so as to extrude the rubber<br><br>
material through the extrusion die; a coupling unit including a threaded sleeve that is sleeved rotatabiy on and that engages threadedly the outer section of the screw rod; a fixed limiting member in constant engagement with the screw rod in such a manner that rotation of the threaded sleeve results in axial movement of the screw rod relative to a the cylindrical barrel; and a driving unit for rotating the threaded sleeve,<br>

figs. 2 to 5 illustrate a preferred embodiment<br><br>
of a rubber extruder 2 according to this invention.<br>
The rubber extruder 2 includes: a fixed cylindrical barrel 21 adapted to receive a rubber material and having a die end 211 and an opposite end 212 opposite to the die end 211; an extrusion die 25 mounted in the die end 211 of the cylindrical barrel 21; a screw rod 4 having an inner section 45 that extends co-axially through the opposite end 212 of the cylindrical barrel 21 and into the cy1indrical barrel 21 and that has an abutting end 41 adapted to abut against the rubber material, and an outer section 47 that extends axially from the inner section 45 and that is disposed outwardly of the cylindrical barrel 21, the screw rod 4 being movable in an axial direction relative to the cylindrical barrel 21 so as to extrude the rubber material through the extrusion die 25; a coupling unit 3 including a threaded sleeve 33 that is sleeved rotatably on and that engages threadedly the outer section 47 of the screw rod 4; a fixed limiting member 51 in constant engagement with the screw rod 4 in such a manner that rotation of the threaded sleeve 33 results in axial movement of the screw rod 4 relative to the cylindrical barrel 21; and a driving unit 6 for rotating the threaded sleeve 33 .<br>
The rubber extruder 2 further includes a barrel support 22 that is formed with a supporting hole 23,<br><br>
and a bearing 24 that is mounted in the supporting hole 23. The cylindrical barrel 21 extends through and is journalled to the bearing 24 through the coupling unit 3. The driving unit 6 includes a motor 61 with an output shaft 612. The coupling unit 3 further includes a bearing sleeve 31 that is surrounded by and that contacts slidably the bearing 24 and that is sleeved securely on the threaded sleeve 33, a driven gear 32 that is sleeved securely on the bearing sleeve 31, and a driving gear 62 that is secured to the output shaft 612 and that meshes with the driven gear 32 so as to drive rotation of the threaded sleeve 33.<br>
The outer section 47 of the screw rod 4 has a distal end 42 that is distal from the inner sect ion 45 of the screw rod 4 and that is formed with a limiting groove 52. The limiting member 51 includes an elongated limiting bar 511 that is secured to the barrel support 52 and that extends through the limiting groove 52 in the axial direction so as to prevent the screw rod 4 from rotating upon rotation of the threaded sleeve 33, thereby permitting axial movement of the screw rod 4.<br>
A controller 8 includes a servo mechanism 63 that is connected electrically to the driving unit 6 for controlling the output shaft 612 of the motor 61 to rotate at constant speed.<br><br>
A sensor 7, which is connected electrically to the controller 8, is provided to compensate errors resulting from the precision and wearing of the screw rod 4. The sensor 7 includes a magnetic ruler 71 that is secured to the barrel support 22 and that extends in the axial direction, and a detector 72 that is secured to the distal end 42 of the screw rod 4 and that is magnetically associated with the magnetic ruler 71 so as to generate a signal that corresponds to the distance traveled by the screw rod 4 in the axial direction and that is sent to the controller 8 for calculating the traveling speed of the screw rod 4 in real-time in order to correct the advancing speed of the screw rod 4.<br>
With the inclusion of the screw rod 4 and the controller 8 in the rubber extruder 2 of this invention, the drawbacks as encountered in the prior art can be eliminated.<br><br>
