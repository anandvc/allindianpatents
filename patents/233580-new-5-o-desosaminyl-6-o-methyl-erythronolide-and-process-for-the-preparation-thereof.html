sodium bicarbonate is added.  After agitation for 3 minutes,<br>
extraction is carried out twice with CH2C12.  The organic<br>
phase is washed with 2 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of<br>
NaCl.  The organic phase is dried over sodium sulphate and<br>
the solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure.  After<br>
purification of the residue by chromatography on silica,<br>
eluting with ethyl acetate with 2% tetrahydrofuran, 43 mg of<br>
desired product is recovered.  Yield: 27%.<br>
