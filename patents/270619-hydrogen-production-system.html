				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
METHOD FOR TREATMENT OF DRAIN IN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION AND<br>
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for treating<br>
drain generated in industrially producing hydrogen from a<br>
hydrocarbon-based material. The invention also relates to a<br>
hydrogen production system for properly performing the drain<br>
treatment method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hydrogen (high-purity hydrogen) is utilized in various<br>
industrial fields such as metal heat treatment, glass melting,<br>
semiconductor manufacturing or optical fiber manufacturing.<br>
Hydrogen is also used as the fuel of a fuel cell.<br>
An example of hydrogen production system for<br>
industrially producing hydrogen is disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 1 given below. The hydrogen production system<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1 includes a gasifier, a<br>
reformer, a gas-liquid separator and a pressure swing<br>
adsorption gas separation apparatus and is designed to<br>
produce hydrogen using a hydrocarbon-based material as the<br>
main material. The gasifier serves to heat and gasify a<br>
mixed material containing a hydrocarbon-based material such<br>
as methanol or natural gas, water and oxygen before it is<br>
supplied to the reformer. In the gasifier, the mixed<br>
material flowing in the gasifier is heated to an appropriate<br>
temperature by utilizing high-temperature combustion gas<br>
produced by burning fuel as the heat source. In the reformer,<br>
the gasified mixed material is subjected to reforming<br>
reaction to obtain reformed gas (containing hydrogen) .<br><br><br>
Specifically, in the reformer, both of steam reforming<br>
reaction which is endothermic reaction and partial oxidation<br>
reforming reaction which is exothermic reaction occur. For<br>
instance, in the steam reforming reaction, hydrogen as the<br>
main product and carbon dioxide as the sub product are<br>
produced from methanol and water. For instance, in the<br>
partial oxidation reforming reaction, hydrogen as the main<br>
product and carbon dioxide as the sub product are obtained<br>
from methanol and oxygen. In the gas-liquid separator,<br>
before the reformed gas produced by the reformer is supplied<br>
to the pressure swing adsorption gas separation apparatus<br>
which will be described later, the liquid component contained<br>
in the reformed gas is separated and removed from the gas and<br>
discharged as drain. In this hydrogen production system, the<br>
composition of the mixed material is so adjusted that the<br>
amount of heat absorbed by the steam reforming reaction and<br>
the amount of heat generated by the partial oxidation<br>
reforming reaction balance each other, whereby autothermal<br>
reforming reaction proceeds in which the reaction temperature<br>
in the reformer is maintained substantially constant.<br>
Patent Document 1: WO2006/006479<br>
The pressure swing adsorption gas separation apparatus<br>
serves to adsorb and remove unnecessary components, i.e.,<br>
components other than hydrogen from the reformed gas to<br>
produce hydrogen-rich gas as product gas. The apparatus<br>
includes at least one adsorption tower loaded with an<br>
adsorbent for adsorbing preferentially the unnecessary<br>
components contained in the reformed gas. In the pressure<br>
swing adsorption gas separation apparatus, gas separation by<br>
the pressure swing adsorption gas separation method (PSA<br>
separation method) is performed. For instance, in the gas<br>
separation by the PSA separation method, a cycle including an<br>
adsorption step, a desorption step and a regeneration step is<br><br><br>
repetitively performed in an adsorption tower. In the<br>
adsorption step, reformed gas after passing through the gas-<br>
liquid separator is supplied into the adsorption tower where<br>
the unnecessary component contained in the reformed gas is<br>
adsorbed under high pressure, whereby hydrogen-rich gas is<br>
discharged from the adsorption tower. In the desorption step,<br>
the pressure in the adsorption tower is reduced for desorbing<br>
the unnecessary component from the adsorbent, and the gas<br>
(offgas) containing hydrogen remaining in the tower and the<br>
unnecessary component is discharged from the adsorption tower.<br>
In the regeneration step, the adsorption ability of the<br>
adsorbent for the unnecessary component is recovered by e.g.<br>
supplying cleaning gas into the adsorption tower.<br>
In the adsorption step described above, the reformed gas<br>
from which the liquid components have been removed by passing<br>
through the gas-liquid separator is introduced into the<br>
adsorption tower. Thus, the liquid components in the<br>
reformed gas are prevented from entering the adsorption tower.<br>
As a result, the deterioration of the adsorbent in the<br>
adsorption tower due to the contact with liquid components is<br>
prevented.<br>
The offgas discharged from the adsorption tower is<br>
supplied to the gasifier as the fuel for combustion (fuel for<br>
gasifying the mixed material). In the gasifier, hydrogen gas<br>
contained in the offgas is burned to produce high-temperature<br>
combustion gas. The mixed material flowing within the<br>
gasifier is heated by the combustion gas utilized as a heat<br>
source to be gasified. The combustion gas after used for<br>
heating the mixed material in this way is discharged into the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
In the hydrogen production system disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 1, the amount of offgas to be discharged from the<br>
PSA separation apparatus and supplied to the gasifier (supply<br><br><br>
per unit time) in the operation can be adjusted. This<br>
adjustment ensures that, during the normal operation after<br>
the lapse of a predetermined time from the start of the<br>
operation, the fuel required for heating and gasifying the<br>
mixed material at a desired temperature in the gasifier is<br>
provided only by the offgas supplied from the PSA separation<br>
apparatus. Moreover, in the hydrogen production system<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1, the interior of the reformer<br>
is maintained at a desired reaction temperature by adjusting<br>
the ratio between the steam reforming reaction and the<br>
partial oxidation reforming reaction of the hydrocarbon-based<br>
material proceeding in the reformer. In this way, in the<br>
normal operation of the hydrogen production system disclosed<br>
in Patent Document 1, the heating and gasifying of the mixed<br>
material is performed only by the self-generating heat<br>
obtained in operating the system, and the interior of the<br>
reformer is maintained at a desired temperature. With such a<br>
thermally-independent hydrogen production system,' hydrogen is<br>
produced efficiently by avoiding the inefficient technique of<br>
continuously heating the mixed material and the interior of<br>
the reformer by burning external fuel.<br>
In recent years, restrictions on environmental pollutant<br>
and hazardous substances are strict, and further,<br>
restrictions on a method for treating industrial waste also<br>
tend to become strict. In the hydrogen production system<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1, the drain removed by the gas-<br>
liquid separator is mainly composed of water contained in the<br>
mixed material. When the hydrocarbon-based material<br>
constituting the mixed material is methanol, the drain may<br>
contain unreacted methanol. In this case, to comply with the<br>
recent restrictions on hazardous substances, it is necessary<br>
to additionally provide a facility exclusively used for drain<br>
treatment or provide a facility for storing the drain and<br><br><br>
transfer the stored drain to a dealer as industrial waste.<br>
However, to additionally provide a facility for drain<br>
treatment is not desirable, because the installation of the<br>
facility requires high cost. On the other hand, when the<br>
drain is to be disposed of by utilizing a drain storage<br>
facility, the cost for the maintenance and disposal of the<br>
drain is necessary in addition to the cost for installing the<br>
storage facility. Such cost for maintenance and disposal<br>
increases in accordance with an increase in the amount of<br>
drain, which increases in direct proportion to an increase in<br>
the amount of product gas (hydrogen-rich gas). These<br>
problems about the drain treatment are not peculiar to this<br>
hydrogen production system. For instance, other equipment or<br>
apparatuses for producing gas may involve the same problems.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been proposed under the<br>
circumstances described above. Thus, in a thermally-<br>
independent hydrogen production system in which mixed<br>
material is continuously heated and gasified by the self-<br>
generating heat obtained by the system operation and the<br>
interior of the reactor is maintained at a desired<br>
temperature during the normal operation, the present<br>
invention aims to provide a method for efficiently treating<br>
drain generated in the operation of the system while<br>
suppressing the cost for the treatment.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
system for properly performing such a treatment method.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a method for treating drain in hydrogen<br>
production comprising a gasifying step for gasifying a mixed<br>
material containing a hydrocarbon-based material by heating,<br>
a reforming step for producing reformed gas containing<br><br><br>
hydrogen from the gasified mixed material by reforming<br>
reaction of the hydrocarbon-based material, a gas-liquid<br>
separation step for separating and removing a liquid<br>
component contained in the reformed gas from the reformed gas<br>
for discharge as drain, and a pressure swing adsorption gas<br>
separation step using an adsorption tower loaded with an<br>
adsorbent, in which the reformed gas after the gas-liquid<br>
separation step is supplied into the adsorption tower for<br>
adsorbing an unnecessary component contained in the reformed<br>
gas by the adsorbent, hydrogen-rich gas is discharged from<br>
the adsorption tower, the unnecessary component is desorbed<br>
from the adsorbent, and offgas containing hydrogen remaining<br>
in the adsorption tower and the unnecessary component is<br>
discharged. The gasifying step comprises burning the offgas<br>
discharged from the adsorption tower to produce combustion<br>
gas and heating the mixed material by using the combustion<br>
gas as heat source. The method further comprises an<br>
evaporating step for evaporating the drain discharged by the<br>
gas-liquid separation step by using the combustion gas after<br>
heating the mixed material as heat source.<br>
In this method for treating drain in hydrogen production,<br>
the drain discharged by the gas-liquid separation step is<br>
subjected to the evaporation step to be gasified and<br>
discharged into the atmosphere. In the evaporation step, the<br>
combustion gas after heating the mixed material in the<br>
gasifying step is used as the heat source for evaporating the<br>
drain. In this way, in this treatment method, the drain is<br>
treated using only the self-generating heat produced by the<br>
hydrogen production. Thus, the drain treatment can be<br>
performed efficiently while suppressing the cost.<br>
Preferably, the treatment method further comprises a<br>
decomposing step for decomposing a hazardous component<br>
contained in the gas produced by the evaporation step by<br><br><br>
catalysis. In this case, even when a hazardous component is<br>
contained in the drain, the hazardous component is decomposed<br>
in the decomposition step to become harmless after gasified<br>
in the evaporation step. With this method, therefore, the<br>
drain treatment is performed efficiently and properly even<br>
when the drain contains a hazardous component.<br>
Preferably, the treatment method further comprises a<br>
heat exchange step for preheating the mixed material before<br>
the gasifying step by heat exchange with the reformed gas in<br>
a state before the gas-liquid separation step. By this heat<br>
exchange step, the thermal energy of the high-temperature<br>
reformed gas is transferred to the mixed material in the<br>
state before undergoing the gasifying step, so that the heat<br>
required for gasifying the mixed material is reduced.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a hydrogen production system comprising a<br>
gasifier for gasifying a mixed material containing a<br>
hydrocarbon-based material by heating, a reformer for<br>
producing reformed gas containing hydrogen from the gasified<br>
mixed material by reforming reaction of the hydrocarbon-based<br>
material, a gas-liquid separator for separating and removing<br>
a liquid component contained in the reformed gas from the<br>
reformed gas for discharge as drain, and a pressure swing<br>
adsorption gas separation apparatus for performing pressure<br>
sing adsorption gas separation using an adsorption tower<br>
loaded with an adsorbent, in which the reformed gas after<br>
passing through the gas-liquid separator is supplied into the<br>
adsorption tower for adsorbing an unnecessary component<br>
contained in the reformed gas by the adsorbent, hydrogen-rich<br>
gas is discharged from the adsorption tower, the unnecessary<br>
component is desorbed from the adsorbent, and offgas<br>
containing hydrogen remaining in the adsorption tower and the<br>
unnecessary component is discharged. The gasifier is<br><br><br>
designed to burn the offgas discharged from the adsorption<br>
tower to produce combustion gas and heat the mixed material<br>
by using the combustion gas as heat source. The system<br>
further comprises an evaporator for evaporating the drain<br>
discharged from the gas-liquid separator by using the<br>
combustion gas after heating the mixed material as heat<br>
source.<br>
With the hydrogen production system having the above-<br>
described structure, the method according to the first aspect<br>
of the present invention can be performed properly. Thus, in<br>
the drain treatment process in hydrogen production, this<br>
hydrogen production system can enjoy the same advantages as<br>
those described above as to the first aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably, the hydrogen production system further<br>
comprises a decomposer for decomposing a hazardous component<br>
contained in the gas produced by the evaporator by catalysis.<br>
Preferably, the evaporator and the decomposer are<br>
provided in a common container, and the decomposer is<br>
arranged downstream from the evaporator.<br>
Preferably, the container is provided with a jacket at a<br>
periphery thereof into which drain is supplied from the gas-<br>
liquid separator, and the jacket communicates with the<br>
evaporator in the container.<br>
Preferably, the evaporator comprises an evaporation<br>
tower in a form of a bottomed pipe.<br>
Preferably, the decomposer includes an oxidation<br>
catalyst.<br>
Preferably, the hydrogen production system further<br>
comprises a heat exchanger for preheating the mixed material<br>
in a state before being supplied to the gasifier by heat<br>
exchange with reformed gas in a state before being supplied<br>
to the gas-liquid separator.<br><br><br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become more apparent from the detailed description given<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic structural view of a hydrogen<br>
production system according to the present invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a hydrogen production system XI according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. The hydrogen<br>
production system XI includes a gasifier 1, a reformer 2, a<br>
heat exchanger 3, a gas-liquid separator 4, a pressure swing<br>
adsorption gas separation apparatus (PSA separation<br>
apparatus) 5 and a drain treatment unit 6, and is designed to<br>
produce hydrogen using methanol, which is a hydrocarbon-based<br>
material, as the main material.<br>
The gasifier 1 includes a main container 11, a supply<br>
pipe 12, a catalytic combustion portion 13 and a distribution<br>
pipe 14. In the gasifier 1, a mixed material containing<br>
methanol, water and oxygen is heated to be gasified. In Fig.<br>
1, the internal structure of the gasifier 1 is schematically<br>
illustrated.<br>
The main container 11 is in the form of a closed-end<br>
pipe and provided with a combustion gas discharge port 111 at<br>
the upper end. The supply pipe 12 has a double-pipe<br>
structure made up of an outer pipe 121 and an inner pipe 122.<br>
The outer pipe 121 has an upper end connected to piping 71<br>
outside the main container 11 and a lower end which is open<br>
within the main container 11. The inner pipe 122 has an<br>
upper end connected to piping 73, 82 outside the main<br>
container 11 and a lower end which is open within the outer<br>
pipe 121. The piping 71 connected to the outer pipe 121 is<br><br><br>
connected to an air blower 72. The piping 73 connected to<br>
the inner pipe 122 is connected to the supply source (not<br>
shown) of the fuel for gasifying (e.g. LPG: liquefied<br>
petroleum gas) used in starting the operation. The piping 73<br>
is provided with an automatically operated valve 73a. The<br>
catalytic combustion portion 13 is provided at a lower<br>
portion in the outer pipe 121. In this catalytic combustion<br>
portion 13, high-temperature combustion gas is generated by<br>
catalytic combustion of hydrogen or the above-described fuel<br>
for starting the operation. The catalytic combustion portion<br>
13 is loaded with a catalyst for combustion. As the catalyst<br>
for combustion, platinum-metal catalysts such as platinum or<br>
palladium may be used, for example. The distribution pipe 14<br>
includes a material inlet end 141, a material outlet end 142<br>
and a spiral portion surrounding the supply pipe 12. The<br>
material inlet end 141 extends out of the main container 11<br>
through the lower end of the main container 11. The material<br>
outlet end 142 extends out of the main container 11 through<br>
the upper end of the main container 11. A heat storage<br>
material (not shown) is loaded around the supply pipe 12 and<br>
the distribution pipe 14 in the main container 11, as<br>
required.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the reformer 2 includes a main<br>
container 21 and a reforming reaction portion 22. In this<br>
reformer 2, methanol contained in the mixed material and<br>
gasified by the gasifier 1 is reformed by steam reforming<br>
reaction and partial oxidation reforming reaction, whereby<br>
reformed gas containing hydrogen is obtained.<br>
The main container 21 is in the form of a closed-end<br>
pipe and provided with a material inlet 211 at the lower end<br>
and a reformed gas outlet 212 at the upper end. The material<br>
inlet 211 is connected to the material outlet end 142 of the<br>
gasifier 1. The reforming reaction portion 22 is provided<br><br><br>
within the main container 21 and loaded with a reforming<br>
catalyst (not shown). The reforming catalyst causes steam<br>
reforming reaction and partial oxidation reforming reaction<br>
of methanol contained in the gasified mixed material. As the<br>
reforming catalyst, use may be made of e.g. a mixture<br>
containing aluminum oxide, copper oxide and zinc oxide. For<br>
instance, the contents of CuO, ZnO and A1203 in the reforming<br>
catalyst may be 42 wt%, 47 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively.<br>
The heat exchanger 3 includes a methanol aqueous<br>
solution inlet 31, a methanol aqueous solution outlet 32, a<br>
reformed gas inlet 33 and a reformed gas outlet 34. In the<br>
heat exchanger 3, by the heat exchange between methanol<br>
aqueous solution before being supplied to the gasifier 1 and<br>
the reformed gas generated by the reformer 2, methanol<br>
aqueous solution is preheated, while the reformed gas is<br>
cooled. Specifically, the heat exchanger 3 includes a path<br>
for methanol aqueous solution to flow from the methanol<br>
aqueous solution inlet 31 to the methanol aqueous solution<br>
outlet 32 and a path for the reformed gas to flow from the<br>
reformed gas inlet 33 toward the reformed gas outlet 34, and<br>
heat exchange is performed between these two paths. The heat<br>
exchanger 3 serves to reduce the thermal energy required for<br>
heating and gasifying the mixed material in the gasifier 1.<br>
The methanol aqueous solution inlet 31 is connected to<br>
the supply source (not shown) of methanol aqueous solution<br>
via piping 74 and a pump 75. The pump 75 supplies methanol<br>
aqueous solution at a predetermined pressure. The methanol<br>
aqueous solution outlet 32 is connected to the material inlet<br>
end 141 of the gasifier 1 via piping 76. To the piping 76,<br>
an end of piping 77 is connected. Another end of the piping<br>
77 is connected to the supply source (not shown) of an<br>
oxygen-containing gas (e.g. oxygen-rich gas or air). The<br>
piping 77 is provided with a flow control valve 77a for<br><br><br>
controlling the flow of the oxygen-containing gas. The<br>
reformed gas inlet 33 is connected to the reformed gas outlet<br>
212 of the reformer 2 via piping 78. The reformed gas outlet<br>
34 is connected to the gas-liquid separator 4, which will be<br>
described later, via piping 79.<br>
The gas-liquid separator 4 includes a drain discharge<br>
port 41 and serves to separate the liquid component 42<br>
contained in the reformed gas (e.g. water or unreacted<br>
methanol) from the reformed gas. The liquid component 42<br>
collected in the gas-liquid separator 4 is discharged as<br>
drain from the gas-liquid separator 4 through the drain<br>
discharge port 41.<br>
The PSA separation apparatus 5 includes at least one<br>
adsorption tower loaded with an adsorbent and is designed to<br>
extract hydrogen-rich gas from the reformed gas by the<br>
pressure swing adsorption gas separation method (PSA<br>
separation method) using the adsorption tower. For instance,<br>
as the adsorbent to be loaded in the adsorption tower, use<br>
may be made of a zeolite-based adsorbent, a carbon-based<br>
adsorbent or an alumina adsorbent, and preferably, a zeolite-<br>
based adsorbent is employed. The adsorption tower may be<br>
loaded with either a single kind of adsorbent or a plurality<br>
of kinds of adsorbents. In the gas separation performed by<br>
the PSA separation method in the PSA separation apparatus 5,<br>
a cycle including an adsorption step, a desorption step and a<br>
regeneration step is repetitively performed. In the<br>
adsorption step, reformed gas is supplied into the adsorption<br>
tower the interior of which is kept at a high pressure so<br>
that the unnecessary components (e.g. carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide or nitrogen) contained in the reformed gas are<br>
adsorbed by the adsorbent. Thus, hydrogen-rich gas is<br>
discharged from the adsorption tower. In the desorption step,<br>
the pressure in the adsorption tower is reduced for desorbing<br><br><br>
the unnecessary components from the adsorbent, and the offgas<br>
including hydrogen remaining in the adsorption tower and the<br>
unnecessary components is discharged to the outside. In the<br>
regeneration step, the adsorption ability of the adsorbent<br>
for the unnecessary components is recovered by e.g. supplying<br>
cleaning gas into the adsorption tower, whereby the<br>
adsorption tower becomes ready for the next adsorption step.<br>
As the PSA separation apparatus 5, use may be made of a<br>
conventionally-known PSA hydrogen separation apparatus.<br>
The drain treatment unit 6 includes a main container 61,<br>
a jacket 62, an evaporation tower 63 and a catalytic<br>
decomposition portion 64. The drain treatment unit 6 serves<br>
to evaporate the drain discharged from the gas-liquid<br>
separator 4 and decompose the gas generated by the<br>
evaporation (evaporating gas) by catalysis. In Fig. 1, the<br>
internal structure of the drain treatment unit 6 is<br>
schematically illustrated.<br>
The main container 61 is in the form of a pipe which is<br>
open at the upper end and provided with a combustion gas<br>
inlet 611 at the lower end. The combustion gas inlet 611 is<br>
connected to the combustion gas discharge port 111 of the<br>
gasifier 1 via piping 91, so that the combustion gas<br>
discharged from the combustion gas discharge port 111 is<br>
supplied into the main container 61. The jacket 62 has an<br>
annular shape surrounding the periphery of the main container<br>
61 and is provided with a drain inlet 621 at the lower end.<br>
The drain inlet 621 is connected to the drain discharge port<br>
41 via piping 92, so that the drain discharged from the gas-<br>
liquid separator 4 is supplied into the jacket 62. The<br>
piping 92 is provided with a flow control valve 92a for<br>
controlling the flow of the drain. The evaporation tower 63<br>
is in the form of a bottomed pipe and arranged at a lower<br>
portion in the main container 61. The evaporation tower 63<br><br><br>
has a lower end connected to the jacket 62 via a<br>
communication pipe 631 and an upper end which is open within<br>
the main container 61. The catalytic decomposition portion<br>
64 is arranged above the evaporation tower 63 in the main<br>
container 61 and serves to decompose hazardous components<br>
contained in the evaporating gas by catalysis. The catalytic<br>
decomposition portion 64 is loaded with a decomposition<br>
catalyst for catalyzing the decomposition of the hazardous<br>
components. For instance, to decompose methanol, platinum-<br>
metal oxidation catalyst such as platinum or palladium may be<br>
used as the decomposition catalyst.<br>
The operation and advantages of the hydrogen production<br>
system XI having the above-described structure will be<br>
described below. In operating the hydrogen production system<br>
XI, methanol aqueous solution of a predetermined<br>
concentration is supplied from the methanol aqueous solution<br>
inlet 31 to the heat exchanger 3 through the piping 74 by the<br>
operation of the pump 75. In the heat exchanger 3, the<br>
methanol aqueous solution, which has a relatively low<br>
temperature (e.g. 10 to 25 °C) , is heated (preheated) to e.g.<br>
137 ºC by the heat exchange with the reformed gas supplied to<br>
the heat exchanger 3, which has a relatively high temperature<br>
(e.g. 230 to 270 °C). The methanol aqueous solution<br>
preheated in the heat exchanger 3 is discharged from the heat<br>
exchanger 3 through the methanol aqueous solution outlet 32<br>
and flows through the piping 76. In flowing through the<br>
piping 76, the methanol aqueous solution is mixed with<br>
oxygen-containing gas (e.g. oxygen-rich gas or air) supplied<br>
into the piping 7 6 through the piping 77. The supply of the<br>
oxygen-containing gas can be controlled by the flow control<br>
valve 77a.<br>
The mixed material (containing methanol, water and<br>
oxygen) prepared in this way is supplied into the<br><br><br>
distribution pipe 14 of the gasifier 1 from the material<br>
inlet end 141. The mixed material is gasified in the<br>
gasifier 1. Specifically, the mixed material supplied into<br>
the distribution pipe 14 is heated, in flowing through the<br>
distribution pipe 14, by the combustion gas generated in the<br>
catalytic combustion portion 13 to a predetermined reaction<br>
temperature (e.g. 230 to 270 °C) required for the subsequent<br>
reforming reaction in the reformer 2, which will be described<br>
later, and gasified. The gasified mixed material is<br>
discharged from the gasifier 1 through the material outlet<br>
end 142 of the distribution pipe 14 and supplied to the<br>
reformer 2 through the material inlet 211.<br>
The mixed material supplied to the reformer 2 is<br>
introduced into the reforming reaction portion 22 and<br>
subjected to reforming reaction. Specifically, by the action<br>
of the reforming catalyst, steam reforming reaction of<br>
methanol which is endothermic reaction and partial oxidation<br>
reforming reaction of methanol which is exothermic reaction<br>
occur. Thus, reformed gas containing hydrogen is generated<br>
from the gasified mixed material. In this embodiment, the<br>
proportion of methanol consumed by each reaction (i.e., the<br>
ratio between steam reforming reaction and partial oxidation<br>
reforming reaction) is so set that the reaction temperature<br>
in the reforming reaction portion 22 is maintained<br>
substantially constant (e.g. 230 to 270 °C) . In this way,<br>
autothermal reforming of methanol proceeds in the reforming<br>
reaction portion 22.<br>
The reformed, gas generated in the reforming reaction<br>
portion 22 is discharged from the reformer 2 through the<br>
reformed gas outlet 212 and supplied to the heat exchanger 3<br>
through the piping 78 and the reformed gas inlet 33. As<br>
noted before, in the heat exchanger 3, the reformed gas,<br>
which has a relatively high temperature (e.g. 230 to 270 °C),<br><br><br>
is cooled to e.g. 40 °C by the heat exchange with the<br>
methanol aqueous solution supplied to the heat exchanger 3,<br>
which has a relatively low temperature (e.g. 10 to 25 °C).<br>
The reformed gas cooled in the heat exchanger 3 is discharged<br>
from the heat exchanger 3 through the reformed gas outlet 34<br>
and supplied to the gas-liquid separator 4 via the piping 79.<br>
In the gas-liquid separator 4, the reformed gas is<br>
subjected to gas-liquid separation. Specifically, liquid<br>
components 42 contained in the reformed gas supplied to the<br>
gas-liquid separator 4 are separated from the reformed gas.<br>
This process prevents the liquid components 42 from entering<br>
the adsorption tower of the PSA separation apparatus 5<br>
located downstream from the gas-liquid separator 4. As a<br>
result, the adsorbent loaded in the adsorption tower is<br>
prevented from being deteriorated due to the contact with<br>
liquid components 42. The liquid components 42 collected by<br>
the gas-liquid separation is discharged as drain from the<br>
gas-liquid separator 4 through the drain discharge port 41<br>
and supplied to the drain treatment unit 6 through the piping<br>
92 and the flow control valve 92a. Specifically, the drain<br>
is supplied to the drain treatment unit by the pressure of<br>
the reformed gas. The reformed gas after passing through the<br>
gas-liquid separator 4 is supplied to the PSA separation<br>
apparatus 5 through the piping 80.<br>
In the PSA separation apparatus 5, the reformed gas is<br>
subjected to pressure swing adsorption gas separation step.<br>
Specifically, in the PSA separation apparatus 5, the PSA<br>
separation method is performed in which a cycle including an<br>
adsorption step, a desorption step and a regeneration step is<br>
repetitively performed. In the adsorption step, the reformed<br>
gas containing hydrogen is supplied into the adsorption tower<br>
the interior of which is kept at a high pressure. In the<br>
adsorption tower, unnecessary components (e.g. carbon<br><br><br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide or nitrogen) contained in the<br>
reformed gas are adsorbed by the adsorbent for removal, and<br>
hydrogen-rich gas (gas with high hydrogen concentration) is<br>
discharged from the adsorption tower as product gas. The<br>
hydrogen-rich gas is taken out of the hydrogen production<br>
system XI through the piping 81. In the desorption step, the<br>
unnecessary components are desorbed from the adsorbent by<br>
reducing the pressure in the adsorption tower, and offgas<br>
including hydrogen remaining in the adsorption tower and the<br>
unnecessary components is discharged from the adsorption<br>
tower. The offgas is supplied to the gasifier 1 through the<br>
piping 82 as the fuel for gasifying. In the regeneration<br>
step, the adsorption ability of the adsorbent for the<br>
unnecessary components is recovered by e.g. supplying<br>
cleaning gas into the adsorption tower. In this way,<br>
hydrogen-rich gas (product gas) and offgas are taken out of<br>
the PSA apparatus 5. The hydrogen-rich gas may be used<br>
continuously for a certain purpose or stored in a<br>
predetermined tank, for example.<br>
The offgas supplied to the gasifier 1 as the fuel for<br>
gasifying is introduced into the catalytic combustion portion<br>
13 through the inner pipe 122 and the outer pipe 121. By the<br>
operation of the blower 72, air is continuously supplied to<br>
the catalytic combustion portion 13 through the piping 71 and<br>
the outer pipe 121. Thus, by the action of the catalyst for<br>
combustion, hydrogen contained in the offgas is subjected to<br>
catalytic combustion in the catalytic combustion portion 13,<br>
whereby high-temperature combustion gas (e.g. 500 to 600 °C)<br>
is generated. The high-temperature combustion gas generated<br>
in the catalytic combustion portion 13 is discharged from the<br>
open end (lower end in the figure) of the outer pipe 121 of<br>
the supply pipe 12 and flows around the distribution pipe 14<br>
within the main container 11. Then, the combustion gas exits<br><br><br>
the gasifier 1 through the combustion gas discharge port 111.<br>
When the combustion gas flows around the distribution pipe 14,<br>
thermal energy is transferred from the combustion gas as the<br>
heat source to the distribution pipe 14. As a result, the<br>
mixed material flowing through the distribution pipe 14 is<br>
heated to a predetermined temperature (e.g. 230 to 270 °C)<br>
and gasified. Due to the provision of the spiral portion,<br>
the distribution pipe 14 has a large surface area (heat<br>
receiving area). When the combustion gas is discharged from<br>
the gas discharge port 111 after releasing its thermal energy<br>
by heat transfer to the mixed material flowing through the<br>
distribution pipe 14, the combustion gas still has a<br>
relatively high temperature (e.g. about 300 °C).<br>
The combustion gas discharged from the combustion gas<br>
discharge port 111 of the gasifier 1 and having a relatively<br>
high temperature is supplied to the main container 61 of the<br>
drain treatment unit 6 through the piping 91 and the<br>
combustion gas inlet 611. The combustion gas supplied to the<br>
main container 61 flows around the evaporation tower 63 (i.e.,<br>
near the bottom surface and side surface) located above the<br>
combustion gas inlet 611 to reach an upper portion of the<br>
main container 61. Meanwhile, in the drain treatment unit 6,<br>
the drain discharged from the gas-liquid separator 4 is<br>
supplied to the jacket 62 through the drain inlet 621. The<br>
drain is subjected to an evaporation step and a decomposition<br>
step in the drain treatment unit 6. Specifically, the drain<br>
supplied to the jacket 62 is introduced into the evaporation<br>
tower 63 through the communication pipe 631. When the<br>
combustion gas flows through the main container 61, thermal<br>
energy is transferred from the combustion gas as the heat<br>
source to the evaporation tower 63. Thus, the drain<br>
introduced into the evaporation tower 63 is heated for<br>
evaporation. Specifically, water and methanol contained in<br><br><br>
the drain are evaporated to become evaporating gas (water<br>
vapor and methanol vapor). The evaporating gas exits the<br>
evaporation tower 63 from the upper end, is mixed with the<br>
combustion gas in the main container 61 and then passes<br>
through the catalytic decomposition portion 64. In the<br>
catalytic decomposition portion 64, methanol vapor in the<br>
evaporating gas is decomposed by the action of the oxidation<br>
catalyst to eventually produce harmless carbon dioxide and<br>
water. After passing through the catalytic decomposition<br>
portion 64, the gas is discharged from the drain treatment<br>
unit 6 into the atmosphere.<br>
As described above, during the normal operation of the<br>
hydrogen production system XI, the material successively<br>
passes through the heat exchanger 3, the gasifier 1, the<br>
reformer 2, the heat exchanger 3, the gas-liquid separator 4<br>
and the PSA separation apparatus 5. By this process,<br>
hydrogen-rich gas is taken out of the PSA separation<br>
apparatus 5 and offgas discharged from the PSA separation<br>
apparatus 5 is supplied to the gasifier 1. In the gasifier 1,<br>
combustion gas is generated by catalytic combustion of the<br>
offgas, and the combustion gas is supplied to the drain<br>
treatment unit 6 after the heat exchange with the mixed<br>
material. In the drain treatment unit 6, the drain<br>
discharged from the gas-liquid separator 4 is heated for<br>
evaporation by the combustion gas. The evaporating gas is<br>
discharged into atmosphere after methanol, which is a harmful<br>
component contained in the evaporating gas, is decomposed.<br>
The above-described operation of the hydrogen production<br>
system XI is the normal operation performed when offgas is<br>
sufficiently supplied from the PSA separation apparatus 5 to<br>
the catalytic combustion portion 13 of the gasifier 1.<br>
However, in starting the system, for example, offgas is not<br>
sufficiently supplied from the PSA separation apparatus 5 to<br><br><br>
the catalytic combustion portion 13. In this case, for<br>
instance, the automatically operated valve 73a may be kept<br>
open until a sufficient amount of offgas is supplied from the<br>
PSA separation apparatus 5 to the catalytic combustion<br>
portion 13. By this, fuel for gasifying (e.g. LPG) necessary<br>
for the catalytic combustion portion 13 is additionally<br>
supplied to the gasifier 1 and the catalytic combustion<br>
portion 13.<br>
In the above-described hydrogen production system XI, by<br>
adjusting the supply of offgas (supply per unit time) from<br>
the PSA separation apparatus 5 to the gasifier 1 during the<br>
normal operation, the fuel required for heating the mixed<br>
material into the gaseous state of a desired temperature is<br>
provided by the offgas from the PSA separation apparatus 5<br>
alone. Moreover, in the hydrogen production system XI, the<br>
inside of the reformer is maintained at a desired reaction<br>
temperature by adjusting the ratio between the steam<br>
reforming reaction and the partial oxidation reforming<br>
reaction of the hydrocarbon-based material which proceed in<br>
the reforming reaction portion 22 of the reformer 2. In this<br>
way, in the normal operation of the hydrogen production<br>
system XI, the mixed material is continuously heated and<br>
gasified by the self-generating heat obtained by the<br>
operation of the system, and the inside of the reforming<br>
reaction portion 22 of the reformer 2 is kept at a desired<br>
temperature.<br>
In the hydrogen production system XI, drain generated by<br>
the operation of the system XI is treated by heating and<br>
evaporating the drain by the combustion gas after used for<br>
heating the mixed material in the gasifier 1. That is, the<br>
heat source for evaporating the drain is provided<br>
sufficiently only by the combustion gas after heating the<br>
mixed material. In this way, the drain treatment in the<br><br><br>
hydrogen production system XI is performed automatically only<br>
by the use of the self-generating heat obtained by the<br>
operation of the system XI. Thus, as compared with a case<br>
where a facility exclusively used for drain treatment is<br>
additionally provided or the drain is disposed of as waste,<br>
the cost for drain treatment is reduced, and the treatment<br>
efficiency is enhanced.<br>
Further, in the drain treatment in the hydrogen<br>
production system XI, methanol vapor, which is a harmful<br>
component contained in the evaporating gas generated by<br>
heating the drain, passes through the catalytic decomposition<br>
portion 64 to be decomposed and become harmless. According<br>
to this method in which drain is evaporated and the<br>
evaporating gas is caused to pass through the catalytic<br>
decomposition portion 64, treatment of the drain containing<br>
harmful components is performed properly and automatically as<br>
the system operates. This drain treatment method is suitable<br>
for reducing the cost for the treatment.<br>
As described above, during the normal operation of the<br>
hydrogen production system XI, by using the self-generating<br>
heat obtained by the system operation alone, the mixed<br>
material is heated and gasified in the gasifier 1, a proper<br>
reaction temperature for the reforming reaction is maintained<br>
in the reformer 2, and drain is continuously evaporated in<br>
the drain treatment unit 6. With this hydrogen production<br>
using the thermally-independent hydrogen production system XI,<br>
both of the hydrogen production and the drain treatment can<br>
be performed without receiving the supply of heat source such<br>
as external fuel. Thus, the damage to the environment due to<br>
the system operation is relatively small.<br>
Though the present invention has been described as above,<br>
the scope of the present invention is not limited to the<br>
foregoing embodiment. The specific structure of the hydrogen<br><br>
production system according to the present invention can be<br>
varied in many ways without departing from the spirit of the<br>
present invention. For instance, the hydrogen production<br>
system XI may be so varied that drain discharged from a<br>
facility other than the hydrogen production system XI is<br>
additionally supplied to the drain treatment unit 6 for<br>
treatment. That is, when the combustion gas used for heating<br>
drain in the drain treatment unit 6 has excess thermal energy<br>
even after the evaporation of the drain generated in the<br>
hydrogen production system XI, drain supplied from another<br>
facility can be additionally evaporated in the drain<br>
treatment unit 6. Such variation of the system is suitable<br>
for effectively utilizing the excess thermal energy of the<br>
combustion gas.<br><br>
