				<td>SECURE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION AND VOTING SOLUTION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/444,885 filed February 5, 2003 andlLS. Non-Provisional Application No. 10/743,321 filed December 23, 2003, both entitled "SECURE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION AND VOTING SOLUTION," which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an on-line voting solution, and more particularly, to a secure electronic registration and voting solution incorporating integrated end-to-end voting system architecture and processes providing secure identification and authentication, voter registration, ballot creation, voting, and ballot tabulation. Discussion of the Related Art<br>
The elections process has come under increasing scrutiny over the years. In particular, voting machine failures, confusing or incorrect ballots, confusion over voting locations, and mishandled absentee ballots have been held out as focal points in recent elections.<br>
Typically, a person intending to vote must register prior to an election. On an election day a person must then locate their assigned polling location, as well as navigate what can be can be a complex ballot or balloting machine.<br>
Even more problematic is the case of an absentee voter, one who will be out of the voting jurisdiction or unable to travel to the polling location on an election day. For example, registration for absentee balloting must take place well before the election. An absentee ballot is then provided to the absentee voter, generally by mail. The absentee voter must then complete the ballot and return it to the absentee, voter's local election office by a<br><br>
specific date, again, generally by mail. Aside from the obvious issues associated with using the mail for timely delivery of the ballot, there exist many additional opportunities for an absentee ballot to be mishandled.<br>
For a voter who is absent from their jurisdiction or a voter living in a foreign country the issues associated with using the mail may be amplified considerably. The need to mail a ballot early enough to arrive at a local election office on or before the scheduled deadline may limit an absentee voter's ability to review information concerning the issues and candidates associated with an election. For example, due to the mailing requirements of an absentee ballot, an absentee voter may not have an opportunity to view or read about candidate debates that may occur after the absentee voter has cast and mailed their ballot but before the day of the actual election.<br>
These and other deficiencies exist in current voting solutions. Therefore, a solution to these problems is needed, providing an improved voting solution, including the ability for an absentee voter to register to vote, receive their ballot and to securely cast his or her ballot so that it is counted in an election.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the electronic registration and voting solution system architecture 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system architecture includes a central secure hosting environment 100 accessible through a network 110, such as the Internet, by a user, such as an absentee voter or a person desiring to register as a voter, from any computing device 120 anywhere in the world and subject to the voter's local or State laws governing the absentee voting process. The central hosting facility 100 is also accessible by officials of a local election office via a computer, or computers 120, over the network 110, The computer 120 of a local election office also includes additional processes 130 for managing the voting process for that jurisdiction. FIG. 1 illustrates the local election office processes 130 logically associated with storage devices 1040 assigned to the local election offices.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a user accesses the central hosting facility 100 over the Internet with a computer 120. Through a registration process and assignment of a roaming digital certificate the user's access is not tied to a specific computer; therefore, the user is not required to use the same computer each time he or she accesses the central hosting facility 100. For example, a user may access the central hosting facility 100 to register to vote from a computer in one location, such as a home computer, and may vote later from a different computer in a different location, such as a computer in an Internet cafe in any city, state, or country.<br>
The central hosting facility 100 includes a system web server housing a home page 1010, an application processing segment 1020, firewalls 1030 and 1032, and data storage devices 1040.   According to one embodiment,<br><br>
centralized servers are configured to create the central hosting facility 100. Centralized servers provide greater security and reliability, and the ability to scale the hardware configuration. Centralized servers also provide lower application maintenance and support costs, as well as reduced costs to "harden the site" to detect and prevent against unwanted intruders or attacks.<br>
The system home page 1010 is accessible by a user's computer 120 through a firewall 1030. The system home page 1010 is used as an access point to other system services and information concerning the access and use of the central hosting facility 100. The system home page 1010 provides access to the application processing segment 1020 through a second firewall 1032.<br>
The application processing segment 1020 of the central hosting facility 100 provides the necessary processing hardware and software for the various subsystems and processes associated with voter registration and voting. Applications associated with the application processing segment 1020 may include identification and authentication 1021, voter registration 1022, ballot definition 1023, voting engine 1024, and/or ballot reconciliation 1025. Local election office processes 130 are also located on local election office computers 120. The local election office processes 130 work in conjunction with the application processing segment 1020 as part of the process architecture of the present invention.<br>
The data storage devices 1040 of the central hosting facility 100 provide data storage for each local election office using the central hosting facility 100. A local election office's storage device 1040 provides "voting system records" for that local election office only, and supports local ownership of processing and data. Furthermore, uploading data to, or downloading of data from, the local election office's storage is possible only by designated officials of the local election office through identification and authentication, and authorization access procedures. The local election office's storage may include voter registration information, ballot definitions<br><br>
and styles, and encrypted voted ballots, as well as comprehensive audit records of all events. It can be appreciated by one skilled in tbe art that the data storage devices 1040 may be physically or logically separated. The storage devices 1040 may also be located within a single server or divided among many servers.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the local election office computer gains access to the central hosting facility 110 in a manner similar to that of a voter; namely, through a network 110, such as the Internet, using the roaming digital certificate technology. Through the application processing segment 1020 and the application processes of the local election office 130 a local election office computer includes uploading and downloading capabilities for that local election office's data. Using the application processes 130 of the local election office computer to access the central hosting facility the local election official can access services, such as voter registration, ballot definition, ballot reconciliation, separating encrypted ballots from the voter records to maintain anonymity, and downloading of encrypted ballots. The local election official can also decrypt downloaded ballots and submit them to ballot tabulation and ballot auditing.<br>

If a user is in a jurisdiction allowing on-line voting, the user confiri whether or not he/she has a DoD CAC credential in Step 304. If a user hs a DoD credential, a roaming digital PKI certificate for use as a digital<br><br>
signature is assigned to the user in Step 306. Once the user obtains a digital certificate, he or she may then request and complete an eFPCA form in Step 308.<br>
For a user that does not have a DoD CAC credential, the user may provide a previously secured digital signature in Step 310. If the user provides a digital signature in Step 310, the user is permitted to request and complete the eFPCA form in Step 308. For a user that can not provide a DoD CAC credential in Step 304, nor can provide a digital signature in Step 310, an identity proofing form is provided to the user in Step 320.<br>
The user then fiTIg out in Step 322 and prints the identity proofing form on the user's printer in Step 324. The user may then have the form notarized in Step 326, and forward it to a validation entity in Step 328. The validation entity confirms the accuracy of the information provided in Step 330. Upon the proper completion and validation of the identity proof, the validation entity notifies-the user and is_sues.to the user a roaming digital PIQ certificate in Step 332. The roaming certificate is the user's digital signature for use with the central hosting facility. After receipt of the certificate, the user may request and complete an eFPCA form as previously described.<br>
Once a roaming digital certificate is issued, the user may gain access to the central hosting facility using a user ID, password, and challenge questions. The digital certificate is not user computer specific. Therefore, a user can access the central hosting facility with the acquired digital certificate from any computer.<br>
Election officials are also provided a digital certificate for use with the central hosting facility. The digital certificate and access capabilities assigned to a particular election official are based upon an official's status and need for access to the various processes of the online election system.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a process flow diagram for the voter registration process of the electronic registration and voting solution according to an embodiment of the present invention. The registration process 40 begins<br><br>
when a user, who has previously received a digital certificate, logs in and authenticates them self with the central hosting facility in Step 410.<br>
Once a user is properly identified and authenticated, the user may register to vote with and/or request an absentee ballot from their local i     election office by completing an eFPCA in Step 412 and submitting the eFPCA signed with the user's digital certificate Step 414 to the central hosting facility. The central hosting facility forwards the registration information to the user's local election office in Step 420. Where required and according to State law the user may also be advised to print and submit i     a hard copy of the FPCA with the user's signature.<br>
After submitting a voter registration application (for example, an absentee voter application), a user may also login Step 410 and check the status of the application in Step 430. The LEO may also communicate status information to the voter Step 440.<br>
The local election office's review..of an eFPCA submitted by a user begins when a local election official logs in and authenticates himself in Step 520. A local election office can then retrieve and review the registration application in Step 452. At this point, the local election official may approve or deny the user's application in Step 454. After the review and approval/denial process, the local election official updates the user's status in Step 456 and provides registration information for an approved user to the central hosting facility's voter registration database, as well as the local voter registration database.<br>
In each instance that there is activity at the central hosting facility voter registration database, a communication is generated and sent to the local election office in Step 420.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a process flow diagram for the ballot definition process of the electronic registration and voting solution, according to an embodiment of the present invention. A local election office uses the ballot definition process to create ballots specific to that jurisdiction's races and local ballot requirements. The ballot definition process 50 begins with the<br><br>
local election officials preparing a ballot definition file in Step 510. The definition file defines, for example, the races associated with an election, the candidates, precincts, precinct splits, and any other information and formatting information necessary to create a ballot.<br>
The ballot definition file may be created offline and imported to the central hosting facility in Step 512 or a local election official may log on to the central hosting facility and create the ballot definition file online in Step 514. After either of the ballot creation methods, the ballot definition file is stored on the central hosting facility. Once the central hosting facility collects a definition file, it is transformed into a standard format specified by the central hosting facility and stored in a ballot definition database in Step 530.<br>
The ballot then goes through a ballot content validation process by the local election official in Step 540. The validation process allows for the creation of an audit record in Step 550 or ballot proofing in Step 560. The ballot is then provided to the voting engine in Step 570 for use with registered voters.<br>
The ballot definition process 50 provides the local election offices with the capability to validate the transformed ballot content, associate ballot types with precincts, and apply local election voting rules, such as random sorting of candidates, to their ballots. The central hosting facility also provides for a complete audit trail of the ballot and ballot definition process.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the process flow for voting and securing a ballot, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The voting process 60 begins with a user logging into the central hosting facility by identifying and authenticating himself or herself as a valid voter in Step 610. Once a user has been properly identified and authenticated in Step 610, the voter may then request a ballot Step 612. Upon this request, a ballot is generated in Step 614 based on the voter's registration information,<br><br>
precinct information, and ballot style and definition. For security purposes, the server generating the ballot will also digitally sign the ballot.<br>
The ballot is then provided to the voter in Step 618 and the voter may enter his or her choices on the ballot in Step 620. After voting is completed, the user digitally signs the ballot using the roaming digital certificate and submits the ballot back to the central voting system in Step 622.<br>
When the central hosting facility receives the completed ballot, it is time stamped in Step 624 and encrypted in Step 626 with the user's symmetric key. A summary of the voter's choices is then transmitted back to the voter in Step 628. This retransmission provides the voter with an opportunity to review their choice set from the ballot and confirm their vote in Step 630. Upon digitally signed confirmation by the voter, the central hosting facility time stamps the ballot in Step 632, encrypts the symmetric key using the. local election office's .public key in Step 634, and stores the encrypted ballot and associated encrypted symmetric key in the electronic ballot box of the voter's local election office in Step 640, thus ensuring that only the local election office can view the voter's choices-After a ballot is placed in the electronic ballot box in Step 640, the local election office may perform a ballot reconciliation process, download the ballot or ballots located in the electronic ballot box in Step 650, decrypt the ballot or ballots using the assigned security keys, tabulate the results, and prepare reports based on the tabulation in Step 660.<br>
The balloting process 60 according to the present invention provides a secure voting capability. The balloting process 60 ensures that ballots in the electronic ballot box are received securely and intact. Voters are provided an opportunity to verify their votes and only designated local election officials of the voter's local election office will have the proper security keys necessary to decrypt the ballot.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a detailed view of the process flow for the ballot tabulation process of the electronic registration and voting system,<br><br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The tabulation process of the central hosting facility provides the ability for the local election office to reconcile the ballots in Step 710 submitted during the election process. Reconciliation allows the local election office the opportunity to confirm that the voters participating in the election followed local election rules, such as following proper voting procedures with respect to the time of voting. Voter eligibility may also be confirmed. For example, fraudulent use of a deceased voter's information can be identified during the reconciliation Step 710. The central hosting facility also creates a voter history in Step 720 and allows the local election office to download and store the voter history in the local election office voter registration database in<br>
Step 730.<br>
The ballot tabulation process also includes various security measures to ensure fair and accurate ballot tabulation. According to an embodiment of the present invention,a.token and a computer are provided to the local election office for use during the ballot tabulation. Two or more local officials are designated for the tabulation process. A dual login is also required in Step 740 wherein one election official installs the token and logs into the local election office computer used for tabulation and the second official logs into the central hosting facility. After the dual login Step 730, voter IDs are separated from the encrypted ballots and the encrypted ballots are shuffled and then transferred to the tabulation computer Step 750.<br>
The local election office may then disconnect the tabulation computer from the network and locally decrypt the ballots with the local election office decryption key in Step 760. The local election office decrypts each ballot by first decrypting a ballot's associated symmetric key using the local election office's public key, then using the associated symmetric key to decrypt the ballot. Once the ballots are decrypted, the local election office tabulation system can tabulate the ballots in Step 770, generate election<br><br>
results in Step 772, create audit reports in Step 774, and prepare a consolidated report of the results in Step 776<br>
In summary, the present invention provides a secure, online voting capability that allows any voter to register and cast iheir ballot according to the timeframe of a local election. The cast ballots are encrypted to provide security to the voters and their ballots. All ballots for a local election office are stored in the ballot storage associated with that local election office. Only officials from a voter's local election office may decrypt and tabulate their ballot.<br>
Every event that takes place throughout the registration and voting process may be tracked and audited. Thus, an independent evaluation of all actions associated with an election is possible. Furthermore, ballot reconciliation according to the present invention allows the ability to flag suspect ballots and if necessary exclude them from tabulation until resolved by election officials. B^ptj:ecounting.is.also provided through the repeatability of the reconciliation, download, decryption and tabulation processes.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided that they come within the scope of any claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br>
