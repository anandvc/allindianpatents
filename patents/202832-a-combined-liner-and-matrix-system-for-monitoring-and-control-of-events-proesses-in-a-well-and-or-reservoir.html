RESMAN AS, of Richard Birkelands vei 2 b, 7491 Trondheim, Norway,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1 2 APR 2006<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a System and a method for well completion, control, and<br>
monitoring of processes in a reservoir. Uses of the system and method are. also<br>
disclosed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many wells the hydrocarbon-bearing formation has to be stabilized from col¬lapse of the well bore or cracks around the well bore. Another reason to stabilize a w^iV bore Is to reduce the production of fines like sand. In order to attain this, the bore is often lined with a perforated steel pipe whereafter the space between the bore and the pipe may be packed with gravel or proppant particles as described in W09954592. In addition different kind of sand filters (gravel or matrixes) may be placed inside (US.5 893 416, US 5 232 048 and US 5 551 513) the steel pipe working as a liner.<br>
Usually, during hydrocarbon production a minimum of water production compared to oil or gas is desirable. This is normally achieved by using techniques to sup¬press water flooding into the  reservoir by altering the production zones or by block¬ing water breakthrough. For sub sea wells separation techniques have been attempted to accomplish separation of produced water down hole in the well bore combined with reinjection of the produced water. For example, electric powered centrifugal separators have been positioned downhole to generate a fluid separa¬tion vortex within the downhole separator. Another solution is to install systems of valves and bypass pipelines in the well bore in order to bypass water production zones (W09963234). However, such equipment requires power and moving com¬ponents subject to wear and failure. In US6015011 a downhole separation by ad¬justing the pressure differential across a filter below a packer is described. Other methods proposed to reduce water production in a well is by water sensitive gels (US5609209), water sensitive particles (W09954592), or by microorganisms in<br><br>
porous particles (W09936667) placed in gravel packing or reservoir fractures In US6015011 a downhole separation by adjusting the pressure differential across a filter below a packer is described.<br>
In order to optimize the total production of oil and gas from a well, some produc¬tion zones in a well bore may have to be bypassed or sealed off for a given time. This can be achieved by completing the zones with a cemented liner, which is penetrated mechanically at a later time by intervention. Another solution is to in¬stall systems of valves and bypass pipelines in the wellbore in order to bypass given production zones (W09963234). However, such equipment requires power and moving components subject to wear and failure.<br>
It is also desirable to be able to monitor the production and different phenomena such as e.g. local variations in pH, salinity, hydrocarbon composition, temperature, pressure, microorganisms, and the difference between production of formation and/or injection water. A known method for monitoring of local flow properties in a well is to lower a logging tool into the wed as described in US 4861986, US 5723781 and US 58811807. These tools require power and moving compon¬ents subject to wear and failure. Another method for monitoring the flow is by che¬mical tracers injected (US 4420565 and US 4264329) or placed in solid particle packs placed along the well bore (US 3991827 and US 4008763). Injection of radioactive isotopes is described in US 5892147. NO-C-309884 belonging to the applicant of the present invention describe methods for chemically immobilizing or integrating tracers in the formation, constructions, or filters around the well. The tracers or tracer carriers are chemically intelligent released as a function of speci¬fied events as oil or water flow rates.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a new solution for low cost, fast and simple well or reservoir completion enabling long time monitoring and enhan¬ced production from hydrocarbon wells without any needs for power or moving components.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with a first aspect the invention provides a combined prefabricated liner and matrix system comprising an outer perforated pipe/pipe system having sufficient strength to work as a liner and/or a sand screener, an inner screen, and a matrix arranged between the outer pipe and inner screen, the combined liner and matrix system constituting a prefabricated liner with predefined properties for fast and simple well and/or reservoir completion, monitoring and control.<br>
The matrix may be porous with a controllable porosity, pore size and pore size dis¬tribution, and the porosity and hence the permeability may be automatically affec¬ted by the environment, e.g. by water or oil flow, or by manual trigging with specific reagents. These may be added by the use of well known techniques or via injec¬tion wells. The matrix is either a bulk form (uniform) having the same shape as the geometrical volume filled by a monomer/polymer solution prior to polymerization, a package of at least one type of polymer particle, or a combination of polymer par¬ticles in a bulk polymer (matrix). The matrix may also comprise an inert or porogen medium or compound. It is also possible to start with an initially compact matrix that becomes porous and permeable as a result of external influence. Both an ini¬tially porous and compact matrix may comprise a polymer or chemical compound reacting at the ambient conditions (e.g. temperature, pH, water or triggers) thereby releasing substances chemically bonded or bonded by adsorption to the matrix into the fluid flow.<br>
The matrix may further comprise components that are detectable after release from the matrix, e.g. a chemically intelligent tracer(s) for monitoring, production and/or specific events in the well or reservoir. The tracers may be adsorbed in or chemically bonded to the matrix.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the liner and matrix element system are stated in the dependent claims 2-22.<br>
In accordance with a second'aspect the invention provides a method for control and monitoring of processes in a well or reservoir using the combined liner and matrix element system as given above, the method comprising:<br><br>
-	providing the combined liner and matrix element system containing a matrix with certain properties based on reservoir data prior to installation in the reservoir,<br>
-	installing the combined liner and matrix element system in the reservoir, and<br>
-	controlling or monitoring the well by interaction with/by means of the matrix.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the invention the above combined liner and matrix system may be used as a combined pipeline in any process equipment, like e.g. reactors, separators and storage tanks.<br>
The invented liner and matrix element system provides a fast and simple method for well completion, control and monitoring of processes preferably to be used in any oil, gas or water production or injection well. In a well completion parts of the series of elements may be of unperforated pipe elements.<br>
The matrix may further comprise components inhibiting or preventing any unwan¬ted phenomena as e.g. bacteria growth or scale formation in the matrix.<br>
The invention may be used in any kind of well bore onshore or offshore. It may also be used for similar purposes in any process equipment.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description of different embodiments of the invention are intended by<br>
way of example only and must not be used as limiting for the invention.<br>
The combined prefabricated liner and matrix element system 4 preferably to be used in an oil, gas or water producing or injection well 2, is shown in Figure 1. The wellbore boundary 3 is indicated on the figure. The prefabricated combined liner and matrix element system 4 is inserted into the well bore 2, and may be fabrica¬ted in various lengths, strength and with different properties. The well can be divi¬ded in sections or regions using a plugging system 5. The locations of the plugging system elements may be predetermined, e.g. based on reservoir data. It can also be based on other type data or experiences. In one embodiment (Figure 3) the combined liner and matrix element system 4 comprises several elements, each element consisting of an outer perforated pipe/pipe system 6 of sufficient strength to work as a liner and/or sand screen, and an inner tubular screen 7 between which is a matrix 8. The matrix 8 is based on one or several types of polymer or polymer particles that may have one or several given sizes giving a desired char¬acteristic/property to the matrix. The matrix 8 has any wanted strength and perme¬ability. The polymer particles in matrix 8 may in addition be carriers for any desired chemical or microorganism for control and/or monitoring purposes. The permeabil¬ity of the matrix 8 is predetermined and may vary from zero to 70 %. It may be fixed or vary in time according to oil or water flow rates, predetermined time degra¬dation or sealing, or by chemical trigging. Predetermined holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 and inner screen 7 gives at full open areas nearly free flow of fluids from perforated pipe/pipe system 6. (See e.g. Figure 6) In order to improve (enhance) free unrestricted flow of fluids from perforated pipe/pipe system 6, an inner screen 16 may be placed between pipe/pipe system 6 and matrix 8. Areas of holes or slices 10 is predetermined and may be fixed or vary in time according to oil or water flow rates. The holes or slices 10 may be filled with an inert medium prior to installation in well 2, which degrade in predetermined time at reservoir con¬ditions or by chemical trigging. Decrease of open area trough hole or slices 10 may be obtained by swelling of the matrix 8.<br><br>
The tubular liner and matrix element system 4 as shown in Figure 1 may be prefa¬bricated at any suitable length connected to each other or to any other pipeline elements in order to form a pipeline easily installed in horizontal, vertical or helical wells. The properties of the matrix 8 and shapes, sizes and numbers of holes or 5     slices 10 through matrix 8 may be predetermined from reservoir data and may vary at any length. Each element 4 may be tested before installation in the reser¬voir. Any element may contain equipment for mechanical or chemical sealing 5 of the well bore.<br>
D     The combined liner and matrix elements system 4 may be produced of any suit¬able materials given sufficient strength and wanted properties. The inner diameter or the free space inside an element must be sufficient for free flow of any fluids and for handling of any wanted well tools like measuring equipment or valves.<br>
5     The outer perforated pipe/pipe system 6 may be of a construction having sufficient strength to work as a liner and/or sand screener alone or as an integrated part of the combined liner and matrix element system 4, and may be of any metal, poly¬mer or composite material. The outer tubular pipe/pipe system 6 may be formed as a single perforated pipe or as a flexible material net or any combinations hereof<br>
)     and may e.g. be any commercial liner or sand screen elements.<br>
The inner screen 7 may be of sufficient mechanical strength to handle any flow or well tool inside the elements (central well hole 2) and be an integrated part of the liner and matrix element system 4. The inner screen 7 may be of any metal, poly-;     mer or composite material. It may be formed as a single perforated pipe or as a flexible material net. The outer perforated tubular pipe/pipe system 6, the inner screen 7, and the matrix 8 are shown in figure 3.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In Figure 4, the well bore 2 and the combined liner and matrix element system 4 are divided into three separate sections or zones by plugging system 5. The com¬bined liner and matrix element system 4 used in various sections of the well may<br><br>
have different properties, lengths and strength. The injection or squeezing of the plugging system 5 may be made after the insertion of the combined liner and mat¬rix element system 4 into the wellbore 2.<br>
In the invented combined liner and matrix element system 4, the space between the outer perforated pipe/pipe system 6 and inner screen 7 is filled with a matrix 8 having any wanted property. The matrix 8 may fill the space alone or be a part of the combined liner and matrix element system 4, e.g. as illustrated in Figure 5 where a flexible perforated material 9 between outer perforated tube/pipe system 6 and inner screen 7 forms a part of the combined liner/matrix element 4. The flex¬ible material 9 may be of any metal or polymer material. Material 9 may be used in order to increase physical strength and stability of matrix element system 4. As material 9 is perforated it will not have any significant influence on fluid flow through matrix 8 or through holes or slices 10 through matrix 8.<br>
In one embodiment holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 and inner screen 7 gives free flow to any fluid 12 and/or fines 11 (e.g. sand) passing through outer tubular screen 6. This is shown in Figure 6. A small portion 14 of any fluid 12 is drained trough the porous matrix 8 by a pressure gradient due to fluid streams 12 and 15 and different sizes or geometric shapes of the holes or slices 10. The fluid flow 14 through matrix 8 enables any tracer incorporated into the matrix 8 to be released to the fluid stream 12 and thereafter to fluid stream 15 as disclosed in Norwegian patent NO-C-309884, or to activate control functions like swelling of matrix 8 when   
Figure 7 shows another schematic cross wall drawing of a possible design for a combined liner and matrix element system 4, where holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 and inner screen 7 and a highly porous material or screen 16 of any metal, polymer or composite material between outer screen 6 and matrix 8, giving free flow to any fluid stream 12 and/or fines 11 (e.g. sand) passing through outer<br><br>
tubular screen 6. A small portion 14 of any fluid stream 12 is drained through the porous matrix 8 by a pressure difference created by fluid streams 12 and 15 and different sizes or geometric shapes of the holes or slices 10, enabling any tracer to be released to fluid stream 12 according to the mechanisms described in Norwegian patent NO-C-309884, or to activate control functions like swelling of matrix 8 when exposed to water for a given time. In this case also the inner screen 7 protects the matrix 8 from erosion due to fluid flow 15 and it prevents the fluid flow 15 to wash out the tracer from matrix 8 along its way out to the surface. This is an important issue since the release of tracers from matrix 8 indicates the local fluid flow rate from each section as described in Norwegian patent NO-C-309884.<br>
Perforated pipe/pipe system 6 may in principle be any combination of perforated pipes, spacers and flexible material nets working as a combined liner and/or sand screener. Figure 10 shows an embodiment were perforated pipe system 6 is for¬med by an outer flexible material 19 working as a sand screener, a perforated pipe 21 and a perforated pipe 23. Between outer flexible material 19 and perforated pipe 21 and between perforated pipe 21 and perforated pipe 23 are spacers 20 and 22. Spacers 20 and 22 gives free flow of any fluid and/or fines coming through flexible material 19 alongside perforated pipes 21 and 23. Outer flexible materia! 19, spacer 20 and perforated pipe 21 may be formed by any commercial combined liner and sand screen system. Perforating holes through pipe 21 may be of any shape, number or sizes while perforating holes through pipe 23 is coordinated with holes or slices through matrix 8 and inner screen 7 as indicated for pipe/pipe sys¬tem 6 in Figures 6 and 7. Perforating holes in pipe 23 and holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 and inner pipe 7 may be made in any way to prevent direct fluid flow through perforating holes in both pipes 21 and 23. Outer flexible material 19, perforated pipes 21 and 23 and spacers 20 and 22 may be of any material, poly¬mer or composite material.<br>
Matrix<br>
An important concept in the present invention is accurate control of the matrix por¬osity and the chemical composition. The matrix 8 is made by filling the specific vol¬ume (bulk) with reagents that can react to produce a porous polymer with the same shape as the free accessible volume. The porogen (often an inert solvent or<br><br>
polymers) is used to introduce pores in the polymer matrix. The type and amount of porogen will influence on the pore sizes and the degree of porosity. Evaporation or degradation of the porogen leads to permanent porous matrixes. The matrix 8 may also consist of a bulk matrix as mentioned above combined with one or seve¬ral types of prefabricated polymer particles. In this case the polymer particles are mixed with* the monomer(s) or reagents prior to the polymerization. During the polymerization process, these particles are evenly distributed throughout the whole volume of the matrix. The physical and chemical properties (e.g. porosity, pore size, degradability, swelling) are the same for a bulk matrix as for polymer particles produced from the same amount and type of reagents. Different possibili¬ties for manipulating the matrix are described below for polymer particles, but these also implies for a bulk polymer (matrix). Specially the pore sizes, the poros¬ity and both the chemical and physical properties may alter from the bulk matrix with respect to the polymer particles when a combination of these types are used. Tailor-made matrixes (bulk and polymer particles) may be produced to give a con¬trolled release of tracers and to control the permeability towards different fluids.<br>
The matrix may contain one or several type of porous or nonporous polymer par¬ticles of given diameters from 0.2 µm to 5000 urn, preferentially 0.5 urn to 3000 uin and most preferentially 0.9 urn to 1000 µrn. Monodisperse or narrow sized partic¬les may be produced by a two-step swelling method (EP0003905) or in a step growth process (EP0594696B1). The two step swelling method is suitable for pro¬ducing monodisperse particles with sizes 1 urn to 1000 µm while the step growth process is suitable for producing particles with sizes 100 µm to 1000 µm. Porous particles may be produced with a maximum pore volume of about 90 percent, but higher pore volumes than 70% will give fragile particles not able to withstand large pressures at dry conditions. An optimum will be particles with about 50 to 70 per¬cent free pore volume. A high degree of cross-linking in the particles will increase the amount of fine pores, and depending on the type of porogen, pores with a rad¬ius of about 50 nm to 200 nm are easily made. Larger pores are introduced by use of e.g. organic acids, alcohols, polymers or other degradable organic/inorganic composites.<br><br><br>
Polymer particles may be produced by other polymerization techniques like e.g. but not limited to dispersions, suspensions (oil/water), inverse suspensions, (water/oil), emulsions (mini- and micro emulsions) or by condensation reactions. However, most of these methods will give a wider size distribution of the polymer particles in the upper size range.<br>
By mixing monodisperse or narrow sized particles of different given sizes, special types of matrixes with desired porosity and permeability can be made. Very accu¬rate matrix packing structures may be made using monodisperse particles. Prede¬termined changes to porosity and permeability of the matrix due to given paramet¬ers like time, temperature, flow rate of oil, gas or water can be made.<br>
The pores in matrix 8 are filled with an inert medium or compounds (porogen) after the polymerization process. Exposed to a desired medium (water or hydrocar¬bons), the porogen in the bulk matrix may be replaced by the well fluid. Porogen or compounds inside porous particles will dissolve at a slower rate giving a controlled change of free pore space and. permeability of the matrix 8 in time.<br>
Degradablc small compact' porous particles containing tracers may also be made and incorporated into the matrix. By degradation (like a soap piece) these particles will not give 'larger' holes in the matrix increasing porosity and permeability in time.<br>
Degradable particles or gels present in the matrix may be made by soluble poly¬mers bound together with cross linking which may be broken in time or exposed to e.g. water or oil. When these bonds are broken, the particles will be free to move with the fluid leaving open pores in the matrix.<br>
Matrixes with different functional groups, like but not limited to: -NH2, -OH, -COOH, -CONH2, -SH, -COOR (R is any group), may be made by using monomers with specific chemical groups in addition to the monomers used for the polymerization reaction (described e.g. in EP0003905). By using given mixtures of different mono¬mers, matrixes with different properties may be made containing given amounts of functional groups.<br><br><br>
Active substances like microorganisms or any tracer for monitoring hydrocarbon and water production from different production zones/sections in a hydrocarbon reservoir and detection of different phenomena such as e.g. local variations in pH, salinity, hydrocarbon composition, temperature, pressure, microorganisms, and the difference between production of formation and/or injection water (described in Norwegian patent NO-C-3Q9884) may be bound in the matrix 8 via degradable bond's, iVke but not lYmi'tea' to: esters, anhydride, carbonate ana" scruff bases, actrng on specific events.<br>
Functional groups, like but not limited to -COOH, -OH, -CONH2, -S03H, aromatic and aliphatic chains, may in addition be used in order to give the matrix 8 wanted wetting properties (hydrophobic and hydrophilic).<br>
Predetermined decrease of matrix porosity and permeability can be made by use of swelling polymer particles or gels inside the matrix 8. The swelling properties may be obtained by using polymer/monomers which can e.g. hydrolyse in pre¬sence of water. In the hydrolysis or by other chemical processes, hydrophilic groups (like but not limited to -COO", -S03" and -OH) are generated which gives increased solubility of polymer and swelling of particles/gels. If a ciuss-linkeu sys¬tem is used, the degree of cross-linking will determine the degree of swelling of the matrix 8. A low degree of cross-linking will give a large swelling. The principal for release of active substances or tracers is based on fine and med¬ium sized pores in the matrix 8, giving strength and slow release of the active sub¬stance, as only a small part of the well fluid will pass through the matrix 8 due to the pore size. By intelligent incorporating tracers as part of the matrix 8 (described in Norwegian patent NO-C-309884) e.g. tracer as part of the monomer unit(s) a controlled release of tracers, without any decrease in matrix stability is ensured.<br>
The matrix may comprise chemicals inhibiting or preventing any unwanted pheno¬mena as e.g. bacteria growth or scale formation in the matrix. A series of various chemicals can be immobilized in the matrix, which are controlled released or be¬coming active in response to given unwanted phenomena in the matrix. The pur¬pose of these chemicals is to avoid blockage of pores and growth on pore-walls in<br><br>
the matrix due to unwanted phenomena as e.g. growth of microorganisms or scale formation. The chemicals may be any suitable chemicals, preferentially working in low concentrations.<br>
The microorganisms primarily responsible for troubles in hydrocarbon reservoirs are the sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). These organisms are widely distributed and represent a specialised group of microorganisms that are abfe to reduce suf-phate (SO42") to hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The conditions for growth and activity of SRB in an offshore oil reservoir subjected to seawater flooding are good. The en¬vironment is anaerobic, the seawater contains significant amounts of sulphate and the formation of water and oil contains low molecular fatty acids as well as other nutrients. Thus, indigenous sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) may colonise in the matrix and produce H2S during growth. The H2S may cause souring of the matrix and corrosion of the steel equipment, and the bacteria may produce biofilms (poly¬saccharides) that results in an unwanted plugging of pores in the matrix. Biocide treatments are today used extensively to control bacterial activity and corrosion in oil reservoirs and oil field systems. Toxic chemical used is any convenient biocide (e.g. aldehydes, organic acids, isothiazolones, parabens, quaternary ammonium salts etc.).<br>
Chemicals for biocide treatment immobilized in the matrix may be released or be¬come active in response to certain triggers or SRB-metabolites. For exampie, the chemicals may be released or activated in response to sulphide, which always is generated during growth of microorganisms such as e.g. SRB, or in response to the lowering of pH that results from sulphite production. In this situation, the che¬micals will be released only locally in regions with growth of SRB, while the chemi¬cals in other regions remain latent and/or inactivated in the matrix. One possibility is to use magnetic iron (Fe) remanant particles that will coagulate and entrap or immobilize the chemical in its matrix. In response to sulphite (S2") the iron will pre¬cipitate as FeS, the matrix will degrade and the biocide will be released. Polymers with cross-linkages based on cystamine may also be used. In the presence of sul¬phite, the S-S-bond between two cystamine molecules will split and the active agent will be released.<br><br>
As with respect to release of active compounds in response to lowering of pH, various compounds or linkages that are labile at low pH can be utilised. Biocidal aldehydes that are linked to a matrix as a Shiff s base, will be released as a conse¬quence of lowering of pH. Ester-linkages will also hydrolyse more effectively in aci¬dic environments. Formation of biofilms, blocking pores in the matrix, may be pre¬vented by coating the pore walls with lectins or antibodies against polysacchari¬des. Biofilm formed may be dissolved by e.g. use of enzymes, preferentially from marine thermopile microorganisms, that degrades polysaccharides in the biofilm. Immobilized microorganisms in the matrix with the ability to produce antimicrobial and/or growth restraining compounds, e.g. antibiotics and bacteriocines, may also be used. In this respect genetic engineering may be used to design microorga¬nisms with the ability to both grow and produce such compounds under reservoir conditions.<br>
The matrix 8 may also be prefabricated onshore or offshore on any platform or ship by injecting a slurry containing given polymers and/or any polymer particles having desired properties, or containing any wanted chemicals or microorganism, initiators and an intern media (like but not limited to: stabilized reservoir oil) be¬tween outer perforated tubular pipe/pipe system 6 and inner screen 7. After poly¬merization the matrix will have a given porosity and permeability. In cases where inert media is used the pores in the matrix 8 made by the inert media will open up in time as the inert media is washed out or released at reservoir conditions.<br>
The temperature stability of the matrix 8 varies on the monomers used in the poly¬merization process and may vary from 50 °C to 300 °C.<br>
The physical strength of the bulk matrix or polymer particles (or combinations thereof making up the matrix 8, may be influenced by the pore sizes. Compact particles have high physical strength while macro porous particles with a high pore volume are influenced by e.g. pressure and friction/shear forces.<br>
When liner and matrix element system 4 is not to work for fluid control of water or oil/gas, reservoir fluids and fines passing through the outer screen 6 will flow through matrix 8 and inner screens 7 (and 16) without any significant pressure<br><br>
loss. Matrix 8 and inner screens 7 and 16 are not to work as filters for fines like e.g. sand. This is accomplished by larger openings in inner screen 7 and 16 than outer screen 6 and or by either a high porosity of matrix 8, but more preferably by holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 and inner screens 7 and 16. The holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 and inner screens 7 and 16 may be made by any suitable means and may be of any shape, size or numbers but with larger open areas than holes or slices in screen 6. When matrix 8 swells by e.g. water, the open areas through holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 will decrease giving higher resistance to fluid flow through the liner and matrix element system 4. In some cases before installation in a reservoir free space formed by holes or slices 10 may be filled with any desired inert medium or compound, making the liner and matrix element sys¬tem 4 impermeable when introduced in a well. Exposed to reservoir conditions, a desired medium (water or hydrocarbons), or by any desired chemical trigger, or in time the inert medium may dissolve at a given rate increasing fluid cross flow through element 4. In this way e.g. oil production rate can be delayed in time for given parts/sections of the production zone in an oil well.<br>
Considering the case when in e.g. a production zone in a well, the main content of fluids and all fines through outer screen 6 is to flow through element 4 nearly with¬out any restrictions. For measuring and/or control functions a small portion of the fluids passing through outer screen 6 is to pass through matrix 8. Inside matrix 8, tracers may dissolve into the fluid according to the applicant's patent NO-C-309884. The fluid flow inside matrix 8 may also initiate any wanted control functions by matrix 8. The fluid flow 14 through matrix 8 is due to pressure gradi¬ents caused by main fluid flow 13 through element 4, fluid flow 15 along element 4, shapes, sizes and numbers of holes or slices 10 and inner screens 7 and 16 as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. For enhanced free flow of fluids 12 and any fines 11 through the element 4 and for protection of matrix 8 from e.g. any well tools and erosion due to fluid flow 15 and for preventing the fluid flow 15 to wash out the tra¬cers from matrix 8 along its way out to the surface, the holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 may be coordinated by holes or slices in outer screen 6 and inner screens 7 and 16 as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7.<br><br>
Fluid control<br>
A possible design for a water control function using a combined liner and matrix element system 4 and swelling of matrix 8 is shown in Figure 8. When matrix 8 is exposed to water fluid flow 12 for a given time, or trigged by any desired chemical trigger 17 (from e.g. any injection well), the matrix 8 swells as illustrated in Fig¬ure 8 A, B and C. When matrix 8 swells, pores in the matrix and holes or slices 10 going through matrix 8 shrinks which results in decreases in free open areas in the matrix 8 increasing the flow resistance to the fluid flow 12. The swelling of the mat¬rix may be reversible according to the content of e.g. water or oil in the fluid flow 12 or may be permanent.<br>
Another possible design for a fluid flow control function using a combined liner and matrix element system 4 is shown in Figure 9. An inert medium 18 is filled into pores in matrix 8 and holes or slices 10 going through matrix 8 prior to installation of element 4 into a well 3. Exposed to reservoir conditions or trigged by any desi¬red chemical trigger 17, the inert medium may be dissolved at a given rate open¬ing up pores in matrix 8 and holes or slices 10 through matrix 8 as illustrated in Figure 9, A, B and C.<br>
Elements of the combined liner and matrix element system 4 may preferentially be prefabricated and tested onshore but may also be prefabricated and tested off¬shore on platforms or ships. It may be made in one or several lengths and or seve¬ral outer and inner diameters. Mechanical strength, flexibility, physical and chemi¬cal properties of inner screens 7 and 16 and outer screen 6 and matrix 8 may be varied according to requirements. Properties of the matrixes 8 may vary at any length or circumference along the elements. The properties of the matrixes 8 may be predetermined from any reservoir data. In addition to a more or less permeable matrix 8 and holes or slices 10 through the matrix, the elements may contain parts of plain metal, polymer or composite material.<br>
The elements 4 may be connected to each other, to other conventional liner pipes or to any other kind of pipes (e.g. production tubing) or equipment. Together with any other pipeline segments or equipment the elements 4 may form a pipeline<br><br>
easily installed in horizontal, vertical or helical production or injection wells. The combined liner and matrix element system may preferentially be installed for once in a lifetime or made suitable for retrieval and reinstallation of new elements.<br>
In addition to the use in any kind of well bore onshore and/or offshore, similar com¬bined perforated pipeline matrix system may be used in any kind of process equip¬ment (e.g. but not limited to: in reactors, separators, storage tanks, etc.).<br>
Based on e.g. reservoir data a well bore may be divided into sections or zones that by optimum should be operating separately e.g. in order to stop or restrict injection water to penetrate the hole well bore. Sealing of the well bore in sections or zones may be done by injection or squeezing of an impermeable matrix 5A in the free space between a liner 5B and the well bore 3. This is shown in Figure 4. Compon¬ents for this matrix 5A may be encapsulated inside the combined liner/matrix sys¬tem elements 4 or squeezed throughout the screen 6 using suitable tools. Poly¬merization of the matrix 5A may be activated by remote control through any chemi¬cal, electrical, magnetic or mechanical means. In order to prevent matrix 5Ato form away from wanted placement, end sections may be temporary or permanent sealed off by any mechanical or chemical means.<br>
