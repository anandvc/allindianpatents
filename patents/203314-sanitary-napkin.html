				<td>This invention relates  to a sanitary napkin for absorption and containment of menstrual discharge.<br>
Japanese Utility Model Registration No. 2527597 discloses a sanitary napkin provided in its longitudinally middle region under an upper layer portion of the napkin with an elastic member adapted to be stretched and contracted longitudinally of the napkin. A portion of a topsheet overlying the elastic member protrudes when the napkin is put on a wearer's body and thereupon the elastic member contracts. As a result, the protruding portion of the napkin comes in close contact with the wearer's pudendum.<br>
In the case of the known sanitary napkin, most of menstrual discharge is absorbed through the protruding portion of the topsheet but any excessive amount of menstrual discharge will flow down laterally along a sloped surface of the protruding portion of the topsheet and may cause undesirable sideways leakage.<br>
It is an object of this invention to, in the conventional napkin having its longitudinally middle region adapted to protrude as disclosed in the above-mentioned<br><br>
-2-document, prevent menstrual discharge from leaking sideways.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet and a liquid-absorbent core disposed between said topsheet and said backsheet, said napkin being characterized in that:<br>
at least a single elastic member is provided between said topsheet and said backsheet, said elastic member extending longitudinally under tension and having longitudinally opposite ends bonded to one of said topsheet and said backsheet so that said elastic member is stretched and contracted between said ends;<br>
in the vicinity of transversely opposite side edges of said napkin, said topsheet is compressed together with said absorbent' core which underlies said topsheet toward said backsheet to form a pair of compressed grooves which extend longitudinally of said napkin and to integrate said topsheet and said backsheet and said absorbent core so that they are not easily separable one from another in said grooves and portions lying in said grooves have a density higher than a density in the vicinity of said grooves; and<br>
between said pair of grooves, a portion of said napkin which overlies said elastic member in a thickness direction of the napkin is formed separably from a portion of said absorbent core which underlies said elastic member also in said thickness direction of the napkin so that said portion<br><br>
-3-<br>
of said napkin	which overlies said elastic member   moves<br>
upward as said	napkin is longitudinally curved with said<br>
topsheet  lying	inside  and  thereupon  said  elastic  member<br>
contracts.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, the elastic member is disposed between the topsheet and the absorbent core.<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention, the absorbent core comprises an upper layer portion and a lower layer portion between which the elastic member is disposed between these two layer portions.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a partially cut<br>
away sanitary napkin according to a principle of this invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along a line II-II in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a view similar to Fig. 2 showing one preferred embodiment of this invention.<br>
Details  of  a  sanitary napkin according to  this invention will be more fully understood from the description<br><br>
-4-<br>
given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a partially cut away sanitary napkin according to one embodiment of this invention and Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along a line II-II in Fig. 1. A sanitary napkin 1 is longitudinally larger and basically comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet 2, a liquid-impervious backsheet 3 and a liquid-absorbent core 4 disposed between these two sheets 2, 3. The topsheet 2 and the backsheet 3 are placed upon and bonded to each other along their respective portions extending outward beyond peripheral edges of the absorbent core 4. Between the topsheet 2 and the absorbent core 4, a single elastic member 6 extends under tension along a center line C-C dividing a width of the napkin 1 in two and bonded at longitudinally opposite ends 7 of the elastic member 6 to an inner surface of at least one of the topsheet 2 and the backsheet 3 by means of adhesive agent 8.<br>
In the vicinity of transversely opposite side edges of the napkin 1, the topsheet 2 and the absorbent core 4 are compressed together toward the backsheet 3 to form a pair of grooves 11, 11 extending longitudinally of the napkin 1.<br>
The backsheet 3 is applied on its lower surface with adhesive agent to form three stripe-like fastening zones 12<br><br>
-5-extending longitudinally of the napkin 1 and are protected<br>
with respective release paper sheets 13.<br>
The napkin 1 of such arrangement is longitudinally curved with the topsheet 2 lying inside so as to follow a curvature of an undergarment worn by a wearer, particularly a curvature of the crotch region when the napkin 1 is put on the wearer's body by peeling the release paper sheets 13 off from the respective fastening zones 12 and thereby fastening the napkin 1 to the crotch region of the undergarment. Thereupon, the elastic member 6 contracts and consequently the topsheet 2 is lifted up, as indicated by imaginary lines, into close contact with pudendum of the wearer. Most of menstrual discharge is rapidly absorbed into the napkin 1 through a portion of the topsheet 2 being in close contact with the pudendum of the wearer and, if the amount of discharge is relatively plenty, the excessive amount of menstrual discharge may flow sideways along a sloping surface of the lifted topsheet 2.<br>
However, such excessive amount of menstrual discharge scarcely causes undesirable sideways leakage, since the excessive amount of menstrual discharge flows into the grooves 11 and is effectively prevented thereby from further . flowing sideways. In the case of the absorbent core 4 mainly<br><br>
-6-comprising liquid-absorbent fibers, the amount of menstrual<br>
discharge flowing along the sloped surface is rapidly absorbed by the absorbent core 4 in the grooves 11 and rapidly diffused longitudinally along the grooves 11 since a fiber density in the grooves 11 is higher than a fiber density in the vicinity of these grooves 11. Leakage of menstrual discharge is prevented still more reliably by such absorptive and diffusive effects of the grooves 11.<br>
Fig. 3 is a view similar to Fig. 2 showing another embodiment of this invention. In this embodiment of the sanitary napkin 1, the absorbent core 4 comprises an upper core 16 and a lower core 17 and a pair of elastic members 6 extend longitudinally of the napkin 1 between the upper and lower cores 16, 17. The upper and lower cores 16, 17 are integrally compressed along the grooves 11 but free to be spaced from each other in their regions defined between the pair of grooves 11. Each of the elastic members 6 has its longitudinally opposite ends 7 extending outward beyond respective longitudinally opposite ends of the upper and lower cores 16, 17 and bonded to the inner surface of at least one of the topsheet 2 and the backsheet 3 (not shown).<br>
When the napkin 1 is longitudinally curved and thereupon the elastic members 6 contract, the topsheet 2 is<br><br>
-7-lifted up together with the upper core 16, as indicated by<br>
imaginary lines. With such napkin 1 being in this state, menstrual discharge is more rapidly absorbed through the topsheet 2 than in the case of the napkin 1 shown in Fig. 1, since the upper core 16 remains in close contact with the topsheet 2 even after the latter is lifted up. In this embodiment, the upper and lower cores 16, 17 may be of the same composition. Instead, it is also possible to form the upper core 16 mainly by fluff pulp and to form the lower core 17 by a mixture of fluff pulp and superabsorptive polymer particles.<br>
To exploit this invention, a nonwoven fabric or an apertured plastic film may be used as stock material for the topsheet 2 and a plastic film may be used as stock material for the backsheet 3. The absorbent core 4 may be formed by liquid-absorbent fibers such as the fluff pulp or by a mixture of such fibers and superabsorptive polymer particles. It is also possible to add the fluff pulp or the mixture with liquid-impervious thermoplastic synthetic fibers up to 30 % by weight or less. Addition of such thermoplastic synthetic fibers improves a menstrual discharge diffusing ability of the absorbent core which is formed by fluff pulp. For the absorbent  core  formed  by  fluff  pulp  mixed with  the<br><br>
-8-thermoplastic   synthetic   fibers,   addition  of   this<br>
thermoplastic synthetic fibers improves a shape holding ability of the absorbent core so far as the absorbent core is heated under pressure so that heat-sealing may occur among the individual thermoplastic synthetic fibers as well as among the individual pulp fibers. The upper core 16 adapted to be vertically movable relatively to the lower core 17 is preferably the absorbent core having its shape holding ability improved in this manner.<br>
The sanitary napkin according to this invention can avoid undesirable sideways leakage of menstrual discharge because of its unique arrangement. Namely, the region of the napkin defined between the pair of grooves longitudinally extending in the vicinity of both side edges, respectively, of the napkin is adapted to protrude and an excessive amount of menstrual discharge will flow along the sloped surface of the protruding region into the respective grooves. The bottom of each groove is formed by a high density liquid-absorbent fibers which can rapidly absorb and diffuse the amount of menstrual discharge having flown thereinto. In this manner, the effect of preventing the menstrual discharge from leaking sideways can be improved.<br><br>
