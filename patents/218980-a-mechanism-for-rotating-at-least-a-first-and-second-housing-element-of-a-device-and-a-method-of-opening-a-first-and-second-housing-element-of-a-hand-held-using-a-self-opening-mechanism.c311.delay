				<td>5		The present invention relates generally to the field of portable electronic<br>
	devices and, more particularly, to a hand-held electronic device having all least a two-<br>
	part housing which rotates between an opened and a closed position to facilitate<br>
	usage.<br>
10				BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		Portable electronic devices have many functions and come in a variety of<br>
	different form factors. For purposes of convenience there is a general trend to ward<br>
	miniaturization of many types of portable electronic devices. Miniaturization<br>
	generally makes it easier to carry the electronic device on one's self, including fitting<br>
15	the device into one's pocket/purse or attaching the device to one's belt.<br>
		While generally there is a motivation to shrink a device's form factor as much<br>
	as possible, in several specific instances the extent to which the size of a device can<br>
	be reduced is limited by other countervailing motivations. In some instances, the<br>
	extent to which, the size of a device can be reduced is limited by minimum size<br>
20	requirements that may be necessary for a person to conveniently use and/or interact<br>
	with the device. For example, a keypad can only shrink so far before it becomes<br>
	difficult to operate. A keypad generally needs to accommodate the size of the user's<br>
	hands and/or fingers. Similarly, telephone handsets, which accommodate two-way<br>
	communication, generally need to accommodate a microphone proximate a user's<br>
25	mouth and a speaker proximate a user's ear.<br>
		In order to meet these types of requirements, while otherwise attempting to<br>
	minimize the devices overall size, many manufacturers have introduced devices<br>
	having two part housings, which fold with respect to one another, thereby allowing<br>
	the device to fold open when being used and to fold close when not being used. This<br>
30	allows a device, like a phone, to be more conveniently stored when not being used,<br>
-1-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	and allows the device to expand to a convenient size commensurate with the usage<br>
	needs.<br>
		Previous wireless communication devices have incorporated two part<br>
	housings, which fold open when being used and fold close when not being used. One<br>
5	such design includes a flip-type or clam shell design, which generally includes two<br>
	housing portions coupled together by a hinge at one end of the device. The two parts<br>
	of the housing rotate with respect to one another along an axis of rotation, which is<br>
	parallel to the front surface of the device or front facing.<br>
		Further, previous wireless communication devices have incorporated a two<br>
10	part housing, which includes two housing portions that rotate with respect to one<br>
	another around an axis of rotation, which is perpendicular to the front surface of the<br>
	device. In at least one design, the housing portions can rotate to an opened position in<br>
	either a clockwise direction or a counter-clockwise direction. One such device is<br>
	disclosed in US application Serial No. 09/826,180, entitled "Rotational Mechanism<br>
15	for a Wireless Communication Device", filed April 4, 2001, the disclosure of which is<br>
	incorporated herein by reference.<br>
		A large number of these devices being portable in nature ate of the type to be<br>
	used by people away from home or work. In many instances, these individuals will<br>
	attempt to use the device while performing other activities, where one or both of their<br>
20	hands are generally full or are otherwise engaged. In absence of a self-operating<br>
	mechanism, which, accommodates the opening of the two part housing, or in other<br>
	words, the rotation of the two housing portions with respect to one another, the device<br>
	generally needs to be opened by separately gripping each housing portion and<br>
	repositioning/rotating the housing portions, relative to one another. This generally<br>
25	requires that the user free up both hands for opening the device.<br>
		For at least flip-type device designs, previous automated opening mechanisms<br>
	have been developed, which reduce the effort required for opening the device. In<br>
	some instances the automated opening mechanism, enables the device to be opened<br>
	using a single hand. Many of these devices incorporate a spring loaded mechanism<br>
30	held closed by a latch. By releasing the latch, the spring action causes the two<br>
	portions of the housing to rotate with respect to one another into an opened position.<br>
-2-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	Generally one or more physical stops are additionally incorporated to limit the<br>
	rotational movement of the two parts relative to one another at one or both of the<br>
	opened and closed positions. However, the same geometries present in an automated<br>
	opening mechanism for a flip-type device do not directly translate to an electronic<br>
5	device having a two part housing, where the two housing parts rotate with respect to<br>
	one another along an axis of rotation that is substantially perpendicular to the front<br>
	facing of the device.<br>
		Consequently, there is a need for a self operating opening mechanism for use<br>
	in a hand-held portable electronic device including devices incorporating a two-part<br>
10	housing, where the two parts rotate with respect to one another along an axis of<br>
	rotation that is substantially perpendicular to the front facing of the device. In<br>
	addition, the desired mechanism should not compromise the stability and rigidity of<br>
	the device in the opened and closed positions. It would be further beneficial if the<br>
	mechanism could be conveniently operated with a single hand,<br>
15<br>
SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention provides a mechanism for rotating at least a first and a<br>
	second housing element of a device with respect to one another, where the first and<br>
	second housing elements have a common axis of rotation, which is substantially<br>
20	perpendicular to a front surface of the device. The first housing element has a path,<br>
	which extends at least partly around the axis of rotation at a distance away from the<br>
	axis of rotation. The mechanism includes a tension device, a mechanical stop and an<br>
	engagement member.<br>
		The tension device has a first end coupled to the first housing element, and a<br>
25	second end coupled to the second housing element. The second end of the tension<br>
	device is coupled to the second housing element at a point which travels around the<br>
	axis of rotation along said path of the first housing element, as the first housing<br>
	element and the second housing element rotate with respect to one another.<br>
		The mechanical stop limits the relative rotational movement of the first and<br>
30	second housing elements, when the first and second, housing elements are at or near a<br>
	rotatably opened position.<br>
-3-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
		The engagement member is engaged to one of the first and second housing<br>
	elements and is releasable engaged with the other one of the first and second housing<br>
	elements. The engagement member selectively limits the relative rotational<br>
	movement of the first and second housing elements, when the first and second<br>
5	housing elements are at or near a rotatably closed position.<br>
		In at least one embodiment, the second end of the tension device is moved<br>
	further away from the first end of the tension device along the path, as the first and<br>
	second housing elements are rotated toward a closed position.<br>
		In at least a further embodiment, the path in addition to including a first<br>
10	portion, which extends partly around said axis of rotation, further includes a second<br>
	portion, which extends along at least a part of the length of the first housing element,<br>
	away from the axis of rotation. In a still further embodiment the second portion of the<br>
	path, which extends along at least a part of the length of the first housing element, has<br>
	a length that is longer than the unstretched length of the tension device.<br>
15		The present invention further provides a method for opening a first and a<br>
	second housing element of a hand-held device using a self-opening mechanism. More<br>
	specifically, the method includes preloading a tension device having a first end<br>
	coupled to a first housing element and a second end coupled to a second housing<br>
	element, wherein, the tension device extends along a path of travel, by rotating the first<br>
20	housing element and the second housing element toward a closed position. The path<br>
	of travel extends at least partly around a common axis of rotation at a distance away<br>
	from the common axis of rotation, where the axis of rotation is substantially<br>
	perpendicular to a front surface of the device.<br>
		The rotational movement of the first and second housing elements is limited,<br>
25	when the first and second housing elements are at or near a rotatably closed position,<br>
	by applying a holding force applied by an engagement member. The first and second<br>
	housing elements are then released, thereby enabling me relative rotation of the first<br>
	and second housing elements toward an opened position as a result of the force<br>
	exerted by the preloaded tension device. When the first and second housing elements<br>
30	are at or near a rotatably opened position, the further rotational movement of the first<br>
	housing element relative to the second housing element is limited.<br>
-4-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
		In at least one of the embodiments, releasing the first and second housing<br>
	elements includes applying a release force to the engagement member, which biases<br>
	the engagement member in a direction that reduces the holding force below a level<br>
	where the force applied by the preloaded tension device can overcome the holding<br>
5	force.<br>
		In a further embodiment, releasing the first and second housing elements<br>
	includes applying an opening force to at least one of the first and second housing<br>
	elements, in the direction of rotation, which in addition to the force applied by the<br>
	preloaded tension device overcomes the holding force applied by the engagement<br>
10	member.<br>
		These and other object, features, and advantages of this invention are evident<br>
	from the following description of one or more preferred embodiments of this<br>
	invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
		While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms,<br>
10	there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described presently preferred<br>
	embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an<br>
	exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the<br>
	specific embodiments illustrated.<br>
		Referring to FIG. 1, there is provided a collapsible radiotelephone 100 in a<br>
15	closed position 110. The radiotelephone 100 has wireless communication capabilities<br>
	and, thus, may be used to communicate with wireless infrastructure, such as cellular<br>
	base stations, regional and local wireless transponders, and wireless local area<br>
	networks. The radiotelephone 100 described herein is a representation of the type of<br>
	wireless communication device that may benefit from the present invention.<br>
20	However, it is to be understood that the present invention may be applied to any type<br>
	of hand-held or portable electronic device including, but not limited to, the following<br>
	devices: radiotelephones, cordless phones, paging devices, personal digital assistants,<br>
	portable computers, pen-based of keyboard-based handheld devices, remote control<br>
	units, an audio player (such as an MP3 player) and the like, Accordingly, any<br>
25	reference herein to the radiotelephone 100 should also be considered to apply equally<br>
	to other hand-held or portable electronic devices.<br>
		For the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the radiotelephone 100 has at<br>
	least two housing elements including an upper housing 120 having a generally<br>
	elongated and planar shape. The upper housing 120 has an upper circular portion 122<br>
30	at one end and an upper extending portion 124 extending away from the upper<br>
	circular portion. In the closed position 110, as illustrated, the upper circular portion<br>
-6-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	122 and the upper extending portion 134 are rotated so as to be adjacent to similar<br>
	matching elements corresponding to a lower housing, which are more clearly<br>
	illustrated in FIG. 2. The radiotelephone 100 further includes an external antenna<br>
	180, which may be provided to enhance the wireless communication capabilities of<br>
5	the radiotelephone 100.<br>
		Components of the radiotelephone 100 are positioned near the upper circular<br>
	portion 122 including an interchangeable cover 130, a locking piece 140, and a<br>
	display 150. The interchangeable cover 130 has a ring-like shape that may be<br>
	attached to, and detached from, the radiotelephone 100. The interchangeable cover<br>
10	130 may include cover selection buttons 132 and/or indicator lights (not shown) to<br>
	provide additional functionality to the radiotelephone 100. For example, the preferred<br>
	embodiment provides three cover selection keys 132: a left selection key, and right<br>
	selection key and a menu key there between. The display 150 may be any type of<br>
	output device that provides a convenient display of text and/or graphics to the user.<br>
15	Preferably, the display 150 is a liquid crystal display having a backlighting system to<br>
	illuminate the display when lighting conditions are insufficient for proper viewing by<br>
	the user. The locking piece 140 locks certain components of the radiotelephone 100<br>
	together, while simultaneously allowing relative rotational movement of the upper<br>
	housing with respect to the tower housing. The locking piece 140 also functions as a<br>
20	display leas to protect the display 150 from undesirable, foreign matter.<br>
		The extended portion 124 of the upper housing 120 may include upper<br>
	housing selection, buttons 160 and speaker apertures 170. Although many different<br>
	selection buttons may be provided on the upper housing 120, only one upper housing<br>
	selection button 160 is shown in FIG. 1 by way of example. In this particular<br>
25	embodiment the selection button is similar to a rocker button having a two-direction<br>
	"scrolling" function. The upper housing 120 of the present invention may include one<br>
	or mote selection buttons (such as selection buttons 132 and 160) for various types of<br>
	features including, but not limited to, volume control menu control, call answering,<br>
	call termination, caller identification, phone book control, voicemail conrrol, e-<br>
30	mail/messaging control, network browsing, power on/off, and the like. The speaker<br>
-7-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	apertures 170 direct sounds generated by a speaker or other type of audio output<br>
	device to the user.<br>
		In the illustrated embodiment, the upper housing 120 principally functions as a<br>
	cover, which as noted above can also include some functional electronic components,<br>
5	such as selection buttons 132 and 160, a speaker, or indicator lights. However, in the<br>
	illustrated embodiment, a majority of the functional electronic components are<br>
	included as part of the lower housing, which is also referred to as the body.<br>
		Referring to FIG. 2, the preferred embodiment of the radiotelephone 100 is<br>
	shown in an opened position 210. The portions of the radiotelephone 100 that<br>
10	become visible in the opened position 210 include a lower housing 220, a keypad 230<br>
	and a microphones aperture 240. When viewed from the front, the lower housing of<br>
	the preferred embodiment has a substantially similar profiles to the upper housing 120.<br>
	Correspondingly, the lower housing includes a lower circular portion 222 and a lower<br>
	extending portion 224. In the opened position 210, the upper circular portion 122 of<br>
15	the upper housing 120 is adjacent to, and positioned above, the lower circular portion<br>
	of the lower housing 220. On the other hand, the upper extending portion 124 is<br>
	positioned away from the lower housing. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the upper<br>
	extending portion 124 is oriented in an opposite direction to the lower extending<br>
	portion 124 on opposite sides of the appear and lower circular portions 122 and 222.<br>
20	The keypad 230 may includes any layout of keys that provide convenient operation of<br>
	the radiotelephone 100 by the user. The microphone aperture 240 directs sounds<br>
	received from the user or other local sounds to a microphone or other type of audio<br>
	input device.<br>
		The preferred embodiment includes a standard layout of alphanumeric and<br>
25	menu control for operation of the radiotelephone 100. As shown in FIG. 2, the<br>
	keypad 230 includes twelve standard keys 232 (namely, 0 through 9, # and *) as well<br>
	as three lower housing selection buttons 234. However, the radiotelephone 100 may<br>
	include a larger grouping of keys, such as a QWERTY keyboard, if a device having a<br>
	larger form factor or smaller individual keys is desired. Although not shown in FIG.<br>
30	2, the keypad 230 may also include a cursor or graphical pointing device such as a<br>
	joystick, touch, pad or track ball. Also, similar to selection buttons 132 and 160<br>
-8- <br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	described, above, the lower housing selection buttons 234 may be used for various<br>
	features including, but ant limited to, volume control, menu control, call answering,<br>
	call termination, caller identification, phone book control, voicemail control, e-<br>
	mail/messaging control, network browsing, power on/off, and the like,<br>
5		The preferred embodiment shown in FIGS.1 and 2 includes at least two<br>
	functional positions, namely an opened position 210 (FIG. 2), and a closed position<br>
	110 (FIG, 1). Generally, the opened position 210 and the closed position 110 activate<br>
	functions of the radiotelephone 100 such as answering an incoming call and/or<br>
	initiating a new call, or terminating an existing call. Other relative rotational<br>
10	positions may define alternative functions, and in some caaea may select or define<br>
	functions not specific to radiotelephones. The relative rotational position of the<br>
	housing may also affect the functionality of the cover selection buttons 132, upper<br>
	housing selection button 160, and lower housing selection buttons 234. For example,<br>
	the selection buttons 132, 160, 234 and 236 may each activate a different function<br>
15	dependent upon the position of the upper housing 120 relative to the lower housing<br>
	220.<br>
		In order to facilitate movement between an opened position 210 and a closed<br>
	position 110, the rediotelephone 100 includes a self operating opening mechanisin for<br>
	rotating the upper housing 120 relative to the lower housing 220. FIGS. 3A-3C<br>
20	illustrate saquential plan views of portions of the radiotelephone of FIGS.1 and 2<br>
	having two housing elements, that move between an opered and a closed position,<br>
	with the position of a tension device and corrasponding end points and travel path, of<br>
	the tension device highlighted.<br>

25	housing 220 in a rotatebly/ closad position, FIG. 3C illustrates the-upper housing 120<br>
	and the lower housing 220 in a rotatably opened position. FIG. 3B illustrates the<br>
	upper housing and the lower housing 220 between a rotatably opened position and a<br>
	rotatably closed position.<br>
		Highlighted in each of FIGS. 3A-3C is a representation of the position of the<br>
30	end points, and the corresponding travel path, of a tension device relative to the upper<br>
	and lower housing, as the upper and lower housing rotate with respect to eash other.<br>

	One end 302 of the tension device 300 is coupled to the upper housing 120, and the<br>
	other end 304 of the tension device 300 is coupled to the lower housing 220.<br>
		In at least one embodiment, the tension device 300 is a spring which extends<br>
	between the two end points 302 and 304, along a path having a first portion 310,<br>
5	which extends at least partly around an axis of rotation, and a second portion 320,<br>
	which extends along the length of the upper housing 120. In alternative<br>
	embodiments, the second portion of the path, could alternatively extend along a<br>
	portion of the length of the lower housing 220, this can be the case, where the end<br>
	points of the tension device are each coupled to alternative ones of the upper and<br>
10	lower housing.<br>
		In at least one embodiment, the portion of the path extending along the length<br>
	of the upper housing 120 has a length, that is longer than the unstretched length of the<br>
	tension device 300. This results in the tension device 300 exerting a force, which<br>
	biases the upper and lower housing towadr an opened position, in a direction which<br>
15	minimizes the path distance including the path distance associated with the portion of<br>
	the path 310 that extends at least partly ground the axis of rotation, regardless of the<br>
	amount of the path length that is associated with portion of the path 310 that extends<br>
	at least partly around the axis of potation. In the illustrated embodiment, the portion<br>
	of the path 130 that extends at least partly around the axis of rotation is minimized<br>
20	when the upper and lower housings are in a rotatably open position relative to one<br>
	another, as shown in FIG. 3C.<br>
		In the illustrated embodiment, the upper housing 120 and lower housing 220<br>
	are rotated back to a closed position by manually applying an external closing force,<br>
	which is greater than the tension force of the tension device 300. When the upper<br>
25	housing 120 and lower housing 220 are at or near a closed position, a latch 400 or<br>
	engagement member limits the relative rotation of the upper housing 120 and lower<br>
	bousing 220 back toward an opened position. The latch 400 is illustrated as part of<br>
	the perspective view of the first and second, or upper 120 and lower 220 housing<br>
	elements of a radiotelephone, illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
30		In the illustrated embodiment the latch 400 includes a leaf spring 410 having a<br>
	first end 415, which is firmly engaged to the lower housing 220, and a second end<br>
-10-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	420, which is selectively releasably engaged to the upper housing 120. In an<br>
	alternative embodiment, the latch 400 has a first end 415 firmly engaged to the upper<br>
	housing 120, and a second end 420 releasably engaged to the lower housing 220. Still<br>
	further, in other embodiments, both the first end 415 and the second end 420 are<br>
5	raleasably engaged to respedtiva ones of the upper 120 and lower 220 housings.<br>
		In the illustrated embodiment, the leaf spring 410 is firmly engaged at two<br>
	paints 425 proximate the first end 415, which are displaced a distance away from a<br>
	contact point 430, where the leaf sprig 410 selectively engages the upper housing<br>
	120. The leaf spring 410 engages the upper housing 120 within a notch 435 formed<br>
10	within the upper housing 120, when the upper housing 120 and the lower housing<br>
	220, are at or near a rotationally closed position. The leaf spring 410 is confoured<br>
	and/or bent to match one of the edge facings of the notch 435.<br>
		The leaf spring 410 is biased toward an engagement position, which produces<br>
	a frictional holding force, as well as physically impeding the rotational movement of<br>
15	the upper housing 120 relative to the lower housing 320. In order to release the upper<br>
	housing 120, the end of the leaf spring 410 needs to be deflected away from of out of<br>
	the notch 435. In the illustrated embodiment, there ate at least two ways for the leaf<br>
	spring 410 to be deflected away from or out of the notch 435.<br>
		The first way includes a push button 440, which is coupled to and/or<br>
20	integrated with the leaf spring 410 proximate the scecond end 420. The push button is<br>
	more clearly illustrated in FIG. 6. The push button 440 is positioned so as to be<br>
	accessible to the user, via an exposed portion 445, which can be depressed by the<br>
	user. When the push button 440 is depressed by the user, the leaf spring 410 is<br>
	deflected by the push button 440 out of the notch 435. In at least one embodiment,<br>
25	the push button is positioned so as to be readily accessible by a user's thumb or<br>
	finger, while the device is generally held within the palm of the user's hand.<br>
		The second way includes the manual application of a force 450, to at least one<br>
	of the upper 120 and lower: 220 housings, which rotates the upper housing 120<br>
	relative to the lower housing 220. When the applied force in combination with the<br>
30	opening force applied by the tension device 300 exceeds a level of force required to<br>
	sufficiently deflect the leaf spring 410 out of the notch 435 and overcome the<br>
-11-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	frictional force applied by the leaf spring 410, the latch 400 becomes disengaged and<br>
	the tension device 300 can complete the respective rotation of the upper 120 and<br>
	lower 220 housing elemens toward an opened position.<br>
		FIG. 5 illustrates an enlarged partial plan view of the first and second housing<br>
5	elements of the radiotelephone in a closed position with tension device and<br>
	engagement member illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
		FIG. 6 illustrates a perspective view of one of the upper housing 120 with<br>
	engagement member 400 and tension device 300, viewed from the back side facing.<br>
	From the back side facing vantage at least a portion of the mechanical stop 600, as<br>
10	provided in the present embodiment is illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
	portion of the mechanical stop corresponding to the upper housing 120 includes an<br>
	end wall 605 of a channel 610. FIG. 6 additionally more clearly illustrates the push.<br>
	button 440 coupled to and/or integrated with, the leaf spring 410.<br>
		FIG. 7 illustrates a perspective view of the lower housing 220, which<br>
15	illustrates at least a further portion of the mechanical stop 600, partially illustrated in<br>
	FIG. 6, More specifically, the lower housing 220 includes a post 700. The post is <br>
	positioned so as to travel within the channel 610, illustrated in FIG. 6, though a<br>
	varying degree of relative rotation, when the upper housing 120 and lower housing<br>
	220 are brought together. The channel ends, thereby restricting further rotation of the<br>
20	upper housing 120 and the lower housing 220 relative to one another, when the upper<br>
	housing 120 and the lower housing 220 are at or near a rotatably opened position.<br>
	The other end 615 of the channel ends, proximate to where the post 700 would be<br>
	positioned in the channel, when the upper housing 120 and the lower housing 220 are<br>
	at or near a rotatably closed position.<br>
25		By intersecting the post 700 with the end of the channel 600, further rotation<br>
	of the housing elements is restricted. It is possible to dampen the movement<br>
	imunediately prior to reaching the end wall 605 of the channel 600 by narrowing the<br>
	channel width or making the channel depth shallower. It is further possible that a<br>
	small spring could be positioned within the channel 600 so as to be compressed<br>
30	between the post 700 and the end wall 605 of the channel 600, immediately prior to<br>
-12-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	the end 605 of the channel 600, to act as a shock absorber, so as to dampen the force<br>
	of any contact, when the post 700 and the end wall 605 intersect.<br>
		While the illustrated embodiment has made use of a spring 300 as the tension<br>
	device it will be readily clear to one skilled in the art that other types of tension<br>
5	devices could be used. Furthermore the manner in which the tension device applies a<br>
	force to the upper 120 and lower 220 housings could similarly involve alternative<br>
	approaches. For example, a spring loaded pulley might be used to supply the<br>
	necessary force, which might allow for greater flexibility in the placement of the<br>
	tension device.<br>
10		Additionally illustrated in FIG. 7 is an axis of rotation 705, which, extends<br>
	through the front and back facing of the lower housing 220. The axis of rotation 705<br>
	similarly extends through, the front and back facing of the upper housing 120.<br>
		FIG. 8 illustrates a flow diagram of a method for opening a first and a second<br>
	housing element of a hand-held device using a self-opening mechanism in<br>
15	accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention. Generally, as<br>
	illustrated in FIG. 8, the method 300 includes preloading 805 a tension device having<br>
	a first end coupled to a first housing element and having a second end coupled to a<br>
	second housing element by rotating the first and second element toward a more closed<br>
	position from a more opened position.<br>
20		In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. l-7, given the nature of the coupling of<br>
	the tension device, the housing elements are rotetable from a more opened position<br>
	toward a more closed direction in a counter-clockwise direction. However, one<br>
	skilled in the art could readily recognize, that the geometries could be mirrored<br>
	horizontally, which would allow for the housing elements to move from an opened<br>
25	pasitiom toward a closed position, in a clockwise direction. It is further noted, that<br>
	generally, the housing elements rotate toward a more opened position in a direction<br>
	opposite to the direction that the housing elements rotate, when moving toward a<br>
	more closed position.<br>
		After the tension device is preloaded 805, and when the housing elements are<br>
30	at or near a rotatably closed position, the rotational movement of the housing elements<br>
	are limited by applying 810 a holding force. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS.<br>
-13-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
	1-7, a holding force is applied by the latch 400, where the end 420 of the leaf spring<br>
	410 engages the notes 435. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that other<br>
	structures, which are suitable for producing a holding force, are similarly possible<br>
	without departing from the teachings of the present invention.<br>
5		The first and second housing elements are then released 815, thereby enabling<br>
	the relative rotation of the first, and second housing elements toward an opened<br>
	position. In the at least one illustrated embodiment noted above, the first and second<br>
	housing elements, corresponding to the upper housing 120 and the lower housing 220,<br>
	can be released when the end 420 of the leaf spring 410 is disengaged from said notch<br>
10	435. Alternatively, the upper housing 120 and the lower housing 220 can be released<br>
	when an external manual opening force is initially applied to one or both of the first<br>
	and second bousing elements which, when added to the force applied by the preloaded<br>
	tension device, overcomes the holding force applied to the frist and second housing<br>
	elements.<br>
15		The tension device then acts upon both of the first and second housing<br>
	elements to rotate the two toward a rotatably open position. The method then<br>
	provides for the limiting 820 of the further rotational movement of the first housing<br>
	element relative to the second housing element, when the housing elements are at or<br>
	near a rotatably opened position. In at least some embodiments, the further relative<br>
20	rotation is limited by a mechanical stop, which includes corresponding physical<br>
	structures associated with respective ones of the first and second housing elements,<br>
	that intersect. In at least one embodiment, the corresponding physical structures are a<br>
	post 700 and the end wall 605 of a channel 600.<br>
		Generally, in the preferred embodiment, the opened and closed position differ<br>
25	from one another by approximately 180. However in some instances, the difference<br>
	can be more or less. For example, in same instances a difference less than 180 might<br>
	allow the radiotelephone to follow more closely the contour of a user's fate, where<br>
	one end of the opened phone, which produces an audio output, is proximate to the<br>
	user's ear, and where the other end of the opened phone, which teceives an audio<br>
30	input, is proximate the user's mouth.<br>
-14-<br><br>
	WO 2004/062125							PCT/US2003/037903<br>
		The method additionally provides for the first and second housing elements to<br>
	be retained to a non-rotated position, in at least some instances, this requires the<br>
	manual application of a force by the user, which counteracts the force produced by the<br>
	tension device. In at least the illustrated embodiment, returning the first and second<br>
5	housing element to a closed position serves to preload the tension device.<br>
		While the, above described, self operating opening mechanism for use in a<br>
	hand-held electronic device is completely mechanical, alternative approaches could<br>
	introduce electro-mechanical elements such as motors or linear actuators without<br>
	departing from the scope of the present invention. However, one of the advantages to<br>
10	an all mechanical approach is that the all mechanical opening mechanism will not<br>
	need to draw energy from a self contained power source, like a battery, when the<br>
	mechanism is being used to open or close the device. This allows more of the energy<br>
	stored in the power source to be used for the other operations of the device, such as<br>
	the transmission and reception of a wireless signal.<br>
15		While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and<br>
	described, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited. Numerous<br>
	modifications, changes, variations, substitutions and equivalents will occur to those<br>
	skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present, invention<br>
	as defined by the appended claims.<br>

The present invention provides a mech-<br>
anism and method for rotating at least a first and second<br>
housing elements (120,220) of a device (100) with re-<br>
spect to one another. The first and second housing ele-<br>
ments (120, 220) have a common axis of rotation (705),<br>
which is substantially perpendicular to front surface<br>
of the device (100). The mechanism includes a ten-<br>
sion device (3000) having a first end coupled to the first<br>
housing element (120) and a second end coupled to the <br>
second housing element (220) at a point which travels<br>
around the axis of rotation along a path, where the path<br>
extends at least at partly around the axis of rotation at a <br>
distance from the axis of rotation. The tension device<br>
(300) biases the rotational relationship of the first (120)<br>
and second (220) housing elements toward an opened <br>
position. The mechanism additionally includes a me-<br>
chemical stop (600), that limit the further rotation of <br>
the first (120) and second (220) housing elements be-<br>
yond an opened position. The mechanism still further<br>
includes an engagement member (400), which is en-<br>
geged to one of the first and second housing elements<br>
(120,220) and is releasable engaged with the other one <br>
of the firsthand second housing elements (120, 220).<br>
The mechanism maintains the first and second housing <br>
elements (120, 220) in a closed position, when the en-<br>
gagement member (400) is engaged with the other one <br>
of the first and second housing elements (130, 220).<br></td>
