				<td>HEAVY DUTY RECLINING MECHANISM FOR  VEHICLE SEATS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention lelates to reclining mechanisms for vehicle sealing assemblies, more specifically to heavy duty manually operated reclining mechanisms.<br>
2,	Background Art<br>
Vehicle seats generally include a seat base and a seat back. Reclining mechanisms for vehicle seats allow the seats to be positioned to accommodate different body types and the personal comfort of seat occupants. Reclining mechanisms for vehicle seats permit the seat back to pivot to allow a passenger to recline or incline the seat.<br>
Manually operated reclining mechanisms establish a locked position in which the seat back does not pivot and an unlocked position in which the seat back can pivot. The mechanism is switched between a locked position and an unlocked position when a user manually operates the reclining mechanism. The mechanism is returned to the normally locked position after the user adjusts the reclining mechanism. Full engagement of the reclining mechanism must be assured in the locked position.<br>
Reclining mechanisms must meet or exceed performance specifications and must be simple for customers to use. Some seat manufacturing specifications have higher load specifications that may require the seat back hinge to withstand more than 4,000 N, in the event of a collision. The components of prior art reclining mechanisms are not easily assembled into a compact package. The axial thickness of prior art reclining mechanisms in some instances exceeded the<br><br>
Asserably of me reclining mechanism can be complicated and labor intensive, The need to assemble spring biased parts together may tend to complicate assembly processes because of the need to compress the spring as parts are assembled together in some designs.<br>
The present invention is directed to overcoming the above problems and other problems that are addressed by the embodiments that are summarized below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A reclining mechanism for a vehicle seat is provided that has a guide plate adapted to be secured to one of a seat base or a seal back and a pivotal plate adapted to be secured to the other of the seal base or seat back. The pivotal plate is pivotally connected to the guide plate about a pivotal axis. A circular rib on the guide plate defines an axially extending bearing surface that engages an axially extending bearing surface formed on the outer periphery of the pivota. plate. The pivotal plate is provided with internal gear teeth. A cam is provided that is connected to a hub that has a plurality of cam lobes. A plurality of locking elements are moved between a locked position and a disengaged position relative to the guide piate. Guides are integrally formed in the guide plate that guide Che movement of the locking elements. The locking elements each have a plurality of gear teeth that extend radially outwardly and are interlocked with the internal gear teeth formed on the pivotal plate. The locking elements each have a cam following engagement surface that includes a plurality of lands that cooperates with the cam lobes to hold the gear teeth of the locking elements in engagement with the internal gear teeth of the pivotal plate. Manual rotation of the hub causes the cam lobes to move out of engagement the lands of the engagement surface of the locking elements. A control plate is attached to the hub through the cam. The control plate has a plurality of slots that each receive an axially extending protrusion, or pin, that is provided on each of the locking elements. The control plate is manually rotated with the cam and positively engages the locking elements to draw them inwardly to disengage the gear teeth from the internal teeth of the pivotal plate.   At least two springs are<br><br>
attached to an axially recessed portion of the guide plare that is axially adjacent to two of the locking elements. The springs engage two diaraeTrically opposed, axiallv extending pins on the cam to normally bias the cam lobes into engagement with the lands of the locking elements in the locked position. The springs provide a balanced and symmetrical spring biasing force to the cam that is applied to the locking elements.<br>
A seat assembly for use in a vehicle is provided with a seat base, a seal back, a pair of reclining mechanisms and a shaft. Each of the reclining mechanisms has a guide plate that is adapted to be secured to the seat base and a pivotal plate that is adapted to be secured to the seat back which is pivolaily connected to the guide plate about a pivotal axis. A circular rib on the guide plate defines an axially extending bearing surface that engages an axially extending bearing surface formed on the outer periphery of the pivotal plate. Each pivotal plate is provided with internal gear teeth on an axially extending surface that is located inboard of the outer periphery of the pivotal plate. A hub that receives the shaft is attached to a cam that has a plurality of contact points. Four lock elements are moved by the cam relative to the guide plate between a locked position and an unlocked position. The lock elements each have an external gear segment that faces radially outwardly that are interlocked with the internal gear teeth in the locked position. The cam engages each lock element at two contact points to drive the external gear segments into the internal gear teeth when the pair of reclining mechanisms is in the locked position. The lock elements each have a pin on a first radially extending side that cooperates with a release plate that includes a receptacle for each of the pins. Two springs are provided on a second radially extending side of two of the locking elements that engage the cam at two diametrically opposed locations to urge the cam to move the external gear segments into engagement with the internal gear teeth. The springs are disposed axially adjacent two of the locking elements. The release plate is assembled adjacent to the first radially extending side of the locking elements and is manually rotated to cause the receptacles to draw the pins of the locking elements radially inwardly to the unlocked position. In the unlocked position each of the external gear segments is disengaged from the internal gear teeth and the contact points are disengaged with the locking elements.<br><br>
According to other aspects of the invention, an arcuate rib may be provided on the pivotal plate that engages the pin. or protrusion, on the opposite side of the release plate from the locking elements and prevents the locking elements from returning to the locked position in certain radial alignments of the pivotal plate relative to the guide plate. This arrangement permits the locking elements to be manually released and held in the released position even after the manual force used to release the locking elements is no longer applied.<br>
According to further aspects of the invention, a clamping ring may be secured to the guide plate with an axiaily extending circular flange that retains the pivotal ptate axially adjacent to the guide plate. The axial position of the guide plate on the hub may be established by a circumferentially extending flange on the hub while the clamping ring locates the pivotal plate axially relative to the guide plate which thereby establishes the axial position of the pivotal plate relative to the hub. A resilient spacer ring may be provided between the clamping ring and the pivotal plate. A seal may be provided between the hub, the cam and the pivotal plate to provide a seal around the hub.<br>
These and other features of the invention will be better understood in view of the attached drawings and the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiment.<br>
