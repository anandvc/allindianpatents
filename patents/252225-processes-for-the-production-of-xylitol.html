PROCESSES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF XYLITOL<br>
[001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/556,571, Processes for the Production of Xylitol," filed March 26, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[002] The present invention relates to processes for the production of xylitol In particular, the invention provides processes for the production of xylitol comprising the oxidative decarboxylation of compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[003] Xylitol is a naturally occurring five-carbon sugar alcohol present ixi many fruits and vegetables and produced in the human body during normal metabolism. Xylitol is also an important industrial product and is widely used in the production of confectionary products, including sugarless chewing gum, breath mints and dry hard candies, as well a.s in dental care products, health promoting products, pharmaceutical products and the like.<br>
[004] Certain characteristics of xylitol make it an attractive sweetener or sugar substitute in various contexts, particularly in the production of sweetened food products. For example, xylitol is non-toxic and has approximately the same sweetness as sucrose with a lower caloric content of about 2.4 kcal/g. Xylitol is metabolised independently of glucose and can be safely consumed by noa-insulin dependent diabetics, has a very low glycernic index, and is reported to have an anti-ketogenic effect In diabetes. Xylitol crystals have an endothermic heat of solution and produce a cool feeling when dissolved in the mouth. Xylitol is also believed to be cariostatic and even anti-cariogenic, and is believed to not be utilized by the microflora of the mouth that produce plaques. Indeed, the use of xylitol in place of sucrose has been linked to a reduction in dental carries. Overall, xylitol is a desirable sweetener.<br>
[005] Xyiitol is usually prepared by processes utilizing various natural raw materials, especially xyIan-containing materials. Xylitoi may be obtained by a variety<br><br>
of processes, including the hydrogenation of xylose that is isolated froxn a hemicellulose (xylan or arabinoxylan) hydrolyzate, as disclosed in US Patents &gt;fos. 2,989,569, 3,558,725, and 4,008,285.<br>
[006] Catalytic hydrogenation of D-xylose in hemicellulose hydrolysates remains the primary industrial source of xylitol. Industrial production of D-xylose is primarily performed by hydrolysis of hemicellulose (xylans and arabinoxyLans). However, many of these processes for the production of xylitol are expensive or time-consuming, and a variety of alternative xylitol synthesis methods have been proposed. These include various synthetic chemical processes, the use of microorganisms., and processes such as fermentation. However, despite these developments, a need exists to produce xylitol in a manner that is low cost and yields high-purity product- A decrease in the waste produced during its production is also desirable. In view of the increasing use of xylitol, in particular due to its properties as sweetener and therapeutic effects, there is a continuing need for methods for the production of xylitol.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[007]        Methods of producing xylitol comprising the oxi'dative decarboxylatiom of a reactant substrate are provided. Preferably, the oxidative decarboxylation is performed in one of two ways.

Preferably, the reactant substrate of the second embodiment comprises a L-Gulonic acid moiety.<br>
[010]         The oxidative decarboxylation step 55' produces a xylitol intermediate compound 60', or alternatively produces xylitol or another compound useful in the production of xylitol. Various xylitol intermediate compounds can be produced, and the xylitol intermediate compounds produced according to the first embodiment may be the same or different from the xylitol intermediate compounds produced according to the processes of according to the second embodiment.

The xylitol intermediate 60' is chemically modified 65' to produce a reaction product comprising xylitol 70'. Preferably, the reaction product comprises xylitol in a yield of at least 20% theoretical yield of xylitol. Chemical modification of a starting material, a<br><br>
precursor material, or a xyiitol intermediate can indicate any suitable reaction or series of reactions that modify the chemical structure of the material, including oxidation reactions, reduction reactions, hydrolysis or condensation reactions.<br>
[013]         In one preferred aspect of the first embodiment, a method of producing xylitol comprises the step of electrochemical oxidative decarboxylation of a D-glucuronic acid reactant substrate, a D-fructofuranosyl uronic acid reactant substrate or a L-gulonic acid reactant substrate to produce a xylitol intermediate. Preferably, method comprises the step of oxidatively decarboxylating a reactant substrate by anodic decarboxylation, where the reactant substrate is selected from the group consisting of; a glycoside, an oligosaccharide, a polysaccharide, 1-phosphate or a glycosyl fluoride of D-glucuronic acid salt. The oxidative decarboxylation step produces a xylitol intermediate compound. The xylitol intermediate is preferably a dialdehyde or dicarbonyl structure, that is preferably subsequently reduced with a hydrogenation catalyst and hydrogen gas to yield a product comprising xylitol.<br>
[014] In one preferred aspect of the second embodiment, a method of producing xylitol comprises the step of oxidative decarboxylation of a D-glucuronic acid reactant substrate to produce a dialdehyde xylitol intermediate, such as D-xylo-pent-1,5-diose.

Xylitol Synthesis Comprising Electrochemical Oxidative Decarboxylation<br>
[031] In a first embodiment, shown schematically in Fig. 2, processes for producing xylitol comprise an oxidative decarboxyiation step performed by an electrochemical means, preferably by an odixative decarboxyiation of a reactant substrate. The use of electrochemical decarboxyiation in a xylitol synthesis has many advantages. In particular, few chemical reagents are involved and the reaction is capable of being highly selective, so it is often simpler to purify the product. Furthermore, there is typically a minimal waste stream, byproducts are negligible, and there are typically minimal spent reagents after electrochemical decarboxyiation processes.<br>
[032]         A glucopyranose compound (1) is used as a starting material for both processes shown in Fig. 2, although any starting material that can be converted to a suitable reactant substrate can be used as a starting material or a precursor material. The glucopyranose compound (1) can be oxidized (a) to a glucopyranosiduronic acid<br><br>
compound (2a) by any suitable oxidation reaction method to form a preferred reactant substrate. A starting material or precursor material can comprise any D-glucuronopyranosyl group that is not substituted at the oxygen in the 6-position, or D-fructuronofuranosyl group that is not substituted at the oxygen in the ring position. The reactant substrate (2a) is preferably a salt of D-glucuronic acid or a glycoside, oligomer or polymer thereof, either as a natural material or produced by an oxidation reaction (a). The reactant substrate (2a) can optionally be provided in the form of a sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, and/or magnesium salt.<br>
[033]        The oxidation reaction (a) of the precursor material (1) to a reactant substrate may be accomplished by methods known in the art, including, but not limited to: air/O2 oxidation on a catalyst such as platinum, stable nitroxyl radicals (e.g., TEMPO with regeneration), transition metal ion oxidation with electrochemical regeneration, and electrochemically. Suitable oxidation reactions (a) for use in oxidizing a D-glucopyranoyl compounds to D-glucuronopyranosyl units are described in the following references, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: BL Heyns et al, "Selective catalytic oxidation of carbohydrates, employing platinum catalysts," Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry, 17, 169-221 (1962); T. Yamada et al., Air oxidation of cyclodextrin with a platinum catalyst," Journal of Applied Glycoscience, 47, 21-26 (2002); P. L. Bragd et al, "Selective oxidation of carbohydrates by 4-AcNH-TEMPO/peracid systems," Carbohydrate Polymers, 49, 397-406 (2002); K. Yasuda et al., "The simultaneous use of immobilized reagents for the one-pot conversion of alcohols to carboxylic acids/' Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions, 1, 1024-1025 (2002).<br>
[034]        The glucopyranosiduronic acid (2a) can be used as a reactant substrate that undergoes electrochemical decarboxylation (c) to form a xylitol intermediate (3). Alternatively, the glucopyranosiduronic acid (2a) can be used as a precursor material that undergoes hydrolysis (b) to form a D-glucuronic acid (2b) reactant substrate. Hydrolysis (b) of the glucopyranosiduronic acid compound may be performed using an a- and/or 6-glucuronosidase (or a mixture of both) or an acid with heat to release D-glucuronic acid. Glucuronic acid may be separated from any non-ionic saccharides by ion-exchange chromatography or electrodialysis. In either reaction method, a<br><br>
carboxyl-moiety on the reactant substrate (e.g., the glucopyranosiduronic acid compound (2a) or the D-glucuronic acid (2 b)) reactant substrate undergoes electrochemical decarboxylation (c) to form a xyiitol intermediate (3). The xylitol intermediate produced by both processes shown in Fig. 2 comprises D-xy/c-pent-l,5-diose (d). Preferably, the xylitol intermediate (3) is a dialdehydo xylitol intermediate<br>
[035]         Suitable reactant substrates for performing the step of electrochemically oxidatively decarboxylating (c) a reactant substrate preferably contain a uronic acid that is preferably in a pyranose or fiiranose ring structure. A reactant substrate can be a carbohydrate acid such as an aldonic or saccharinic acid, although reactant substrates comprising a uronic acid are preferred. More specifically, a reactant substrate preferably comprises a chemical moiety selected from the group consisting of: a glycoside, an oligosaccharide, a polysaccharide, 1-phosphate or a glycosyl fluoride of D-glucuronic acid salt and a D- fructuronofuranosyl acid. Examples of preferred reactant substrates are shown in Fig. 2 as a glucopyranosiduronic acid compound (2a) or a D-glucuronic acid compound (2b).<br>
[036] The step of oxidative decarboxylation of a reactant substrate (c) is preferably performed by an electrochemical oxidative decarboxylation of the reactant substrate. The reactant substrate is preferably in its ionized (i.e., salt) form, either as a free compound or linked glycosidically to an alcohol or another molecule. A suitable oxidative decarboxylation (c) reaction to yield the xylitol intermediate (3) is an oxidative decarboxylation reaction such as the Hofer-Moest reaction (Hofer and Moest, Annalen, 1902, S28, 284). The Hofer-Moest reaction is described, for example, by Kruis and Schanzer, Z physikai Chem.y 1942, 191, A, 301. Neuberg (Biochemische Zeitschrift 7 (1908) 537). The decarboxylation of D-gluconic acid to D-arabinose has been researched as an economically important reaction, and continuous flow reactors for the process have been developed. The following references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: Pergola et al., Electrochimica Acta 39 (1994) 1415; Pezzatini et al. Electroanalysis 4 (1992) 129; and Vallieres and K4atlosz, Journal of the Electrochemical Society 146 (1999) 2933.<br>
[037]         An apparatus for the decarboxylation of a reactant substrate preferably comprises an electrochemical cell. An anodic oxidative decarboxylation reaction (c)<br><br>
can be performed using the electrochemical cell   The electrochemical cell anode may be formed from any suitable material, but preferably spectroscopic graphite, pyrolytic carbon, wax-impregnated graphite, glassy carbon, dispersed graphite, dispersed carbonaceous material, carbon cloth, coke, or platinum as a packed bed, fluidized bed, or porous anode. U.S. Patent No, 4,950,366, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses an apparatus for the decarboxylation of D-gluconic acid to yield D-arabinose that can be used to perform the oxidative decarboxylation reaction (c). The electrochemical cell preferably comprises an electrochemical cell anode, where the oxidative decarboxylation reaction (c) is believed to occur. The anode surface area is preferably large and can be made of many carbonaceous materials, platinum, or other metals. Contact between the starting material and the anode elicits the decarboxylation, which results in liberation of carbon dioxide and formation of the xylitol intermediate (3). Preferably, the electrochemical cell further comprises a cathode, where a reduction can occur within the electrochemical cell.<br>
[038]        The electrochemical oxidative decarboxylation is believed to occur when a solution comprising a reactant substrate is contacted with the anode of an electrochemical cell to which a potential is applied. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that decarboxylation of a glucopyranosiduronic acid compound results in formation at carbon 5 of a carbocation (carbonium ion), which is stabilized as a carboxonium ion (involving the ring oxygen atom). Addition of a hydroxide ion or water molecule to this intermediate can form a hemiacetal, which in an aqueous environment opens, forming an aldehyde (carbon 5) and a hemiacetal at carbon 1. The later decomposes to an aldehyde, forming the dtaldehyde.<br>
[039]        Other examples of electrochemical oxidation methods are described in the following references, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety; Schuurman et aL, Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, 72 (1992) 43; Applied Catalysis A: General 89 (1992) 31, 47 and references therein; P.L. Bragd, A.C. Besemer, and H. van Bekkurn, Carbohydrate Polymers 49 (2002) 397-406); Matsuoka etal, Fuel Cells 2 (2002) 35.<br>
[040]        Performing the electrochemical decarboxylation (c) of a reactant substrate, such as glucopyranosiduronic acid (2a) or D-glucuronic acid (2b), yields a xylitol<br><br>
intermediate (3) such as JJ-xylo-pent-l,5-diose (d). One or more subsequent chemical modifications of the xylitol intermediate (3), such as a reduction-hydrogenation reaction (e) yields a product composition comprising xyiitol (4). The non-ionic xylitol intermediate (3) may be separated from unreacted starting material (2), for example by anion-exchange chromatography or electrodialysis. Reduction of the xyiitol intermediate (3) may be performed by any suitable method known in the art, including, but not limited to, catalytic hydrogenation. Effective catalysts include ruthenium and nickel. In particular, supported ruthenium catalysts and Raney nickel may be used. In one aspect, the xylitol intermediate (3) may be reduced with hydrogen and a ruthenium (WO Patent Appl. No. 2004052813, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference), nickel (US Patent No. 4,008,285, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference), or other known hj'drogenation catalyst to produce xylitol (4). The hydrogenation is routinely performed at temperatures between about 70° C and about 150° C and at pressures between about 0.1 and about 10 MPa H2. Alternatively, electrochemical reduction may be used (Taylor, Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Vol. 44 (1937) 588, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference).   Reduction of the intermediate obtained by decarboxylation of D-fructuronofuranosyl acid yields a mixture of xylitol and D-arabinitoL Xylitol can be recovered by crystallization (De Faveri et al., Journal of Food Engineering 61 (2004) 407, incorporated herein by reference in the entirety).<br>
[041]         Fig. 3 shows a detailed chemical reaction scheme for various chemical compounds that can be used according the methods for producing xylitol according to the reaction schemes of Fig- 2. The starting material or precursor material (1) may be any suitable compound that can be chemically altered to form reactant substrate (2) that undergoes electrochemical oxidative decarboxylation (c). As noted above, a suitable starting material or precursor material can comprise any D-glucuronopyranosyl group or D-fructuronofuranosyl group that is not substituted at the oxygen in the 6-position. The starting material (1), or a precursor material (if applicable) that is converted to a reactant substrate, is preferably a salt of D-glucuronic acid (1 in Fig. 2) or a glycoside, oligomer, or polymer thereof, either as a natural material or produced by oxidation. Two examples of suitable natural materials useful as a precursor material or a starting material are gluuoran and<br><br>
glucuronan (a naturally-occurring polymer of glucuronic acid). Other suitable starting material (1) compounds include glucosides (R= alkyl or aryl group), compounds with D-glucopyranosyl units in glycosidic linkages such as malto- or cellulo-oligo- or polysaccharides (R and/or one of the R' groups - a D-glucopyranosyl unit, the other R' groups = H), D-glucopyranosyl phosphate (R = phosphate), D-glucopyranosyl fluoride (OR = F), or sucrose (R = D-fructofuranosyl unit). The starting material (1) may have either an alpha or beta configuration at carbon number L Alternatively, oligo- and polysaccharides containing 2, l-linked D-fructofuranosyl units may also serve as starting materials. In another aspect, a salt of a D-fructofuranosyl-containing compound or a 2,1-linked oligomer or polymer thereof produced by oxidation of a 2,l-linked fructan or oligomers obtained from it also may serve as the reactant substrate of the reaction sequence.<br>
[042]        In Fig, 3, the starting material (1) is converted to a suitable reactant substrate (2) as described above with respect to the reaction schemes of Fig- 2. In reactant substrate (2), the aglycon of the glycoside.(R) is preferably a chemical moiety-selected from the group consisting of: an alkyl or aryl alcohol, a sugar, and glucopyranuronosyl unit (oligo- or polyglucuronic acid) or a like protecting group for carbon 1 of the glucuronopyranosyl unit.

[049] Processes for preparing xylitol comprising using chemical reactions to perform a decarboxylation step are schematically presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 depicts two alternative processes for the production of xylitol within the second embodiment. In a first aspect, xylitol is produced from a D-glucuronic acid reactant substrate (30) that undergoes a chemical decarboxylation (c2). In a second aspect, xylitol is produced from a L-gulonic acid reactant substrate (60) that undergoes a chemical decarboxylation (g2) to form a xylitol intermediate. The xylitol intermediate produced depends on which reactant substrate is used. In the first aspect, a D-xylo-pent-L,5-diose (d2) xylitol intermediate (40) is produced.  In the second aspect, a L-<br><br>
xylose (h2) xylitol intermediate (70) is produced. The xylitol intermediate (40), (70) can be reduced by hydro genation reduction reaction (e2).<br>

The starting material can be oxidized (a2) to a glucopyranosiduronic acid compound (20) by any suitable oxidation reaction method, as described with respect to xylitol synthesis methods of the first embodiment, to form a precursor material or a reactant substrate. The oxidation reaction (a2) of the precursor material (10) to a glucopyranosiduronic acid precursor material (20) may be accomplished by methods known in the art, including, but not limited to: air/Oa oxidation on a catalyst such as platinum, stable nitroxyl radicals (e.g., TEMPO with regeneration), transition metal ion oxidation with electrochemical regeneration, and electrochemical!^.

[051]        The glucopyranosiduronic acid (20) can be used as a precursor material that can be converted to a reactant substrate or to another precursor material. The glucopyranosiduronic acid (20) can be converted to the D-glucuronic acid (30) by hydrolysis (b2) of the glucopyranosiduronic acid precursor material (20). Hydrolysis (b2) of the glucopyranosiduronic acid precursor material (20) can be performed in any suitable manner, such as by using an enzyme, such as a- and/or P-glucuronosidase, or<br><br>

[053]        A D-gulonic acid reactant substrate (30) may undergo any suitable type of chemical oxidative decarboxylation (c2) to yield a first xyiitoi intermediate (40) (D-xy/o-pent-l,5-diose, (d2)). Similarly, L-gulonic acid reactant substrates (60) may undergo any suitable type of oxidative decarboxylation (g2) to yield a second xylitol intermediate (h2) (L-xylose). Oxidative decarboxylation reactions typically result in liberation of carbon, dioxide and formation of the xylitol intermediates such as T&gt;-xylo-pent-l,5-diose (d2) or L-xylose (h2). These non-ionic xylitol intermediates (40) and (70) may be separated from unreacted starting material by anion-exchange chromatography.<br>
[054]        The oxidative decarboxylation (c2), (g2) can be performed on a reactant substrate (30) using various chemical reactions. Examples of suitable chemical oxidative decarboxylation approaches include, but not limited to, one or more of the following: use of a transition metal ion catalyst with a primary oxidizing agent, use of a hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid, photochemical Hofer-Moest reactions, and the use of supercritical water.<br>

Cu(I)/oxygen decarboxylation of aliphatic and (alpha)-hydroxy acids in organic solvents can be used in one aspect. In another aspect, Cu.(III) salts of periodate and tellurate can be used to decarboxylate (alpha)-hydroxy acids to yield aldehydes and ketones. The Ruff degradation is described in W.

EXAMPLES<br>
[086]        The following examples are illustrative only, and should not be interpreted as limiting since further modifications of the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this teaching. All such modifications are deemed to be within the scope of the embodiments disclosed herein.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Electrochemical decarboxylation of a D-glucuroaate monohydrate salt to<br>
produce xylitol<br>
[087]        Sodium D-glucuronate monohydrate (2.69 g, 0.0115 mol) was dissolved in 43 mL of methanol-water (46.2% v/v). The solution was subjected to electrolysis in a undivided cell with a graphite anode at a constant 9,99 volts for 4.31 watt-hours. The electrolyte solution was then brought to 110 mL with ethanol-water (50%) and hydrogenated by the addition of Raney Nickel and the application of hydrogen gas at 1 atmosphere at 50°C. The resulting hydrogenated syrup contained 0.87 g xylitol (50% of theoretical yield) and 1.10 g soldium L-gulonate (42% of the starting material on a molar basis).<br>
[088]        The theoretical yield, or "% of theoretical yield" was calculated as follows: First, the molecular weights were identified as follows:<br>
a.	Sodium D-glucuronate monohydrate 235<br>
b.	Sodium methyl b-D-glucuronate 231<br>
c.	Sodium L-gulonate 219<br>
d.	Xylitol 152<br><br>
[089] Next, the calculation was performed as follows: 2.69 g of starting material is 0.0114 mol and the theoretical yield of xylitol is 0.0114 X 152 or 1.74 g. The actual yield was 0.87 g, which is 50% of the theoretical yield.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Electrochemical decarboxylation of an alkyl-B-D-glucuronoside salt to produce<br>
xylitol<br>
[090]        Sodium methyl B-D-glucuronoside (2.52 g, 0.0103 mol) was dissolved in 39 mL of water. The solution was subjected to electrolysis in a undivided cell with a graphite anode at a coastant 9.99 volts for 8.49 watt-hours. The electrolyte solution was then brought to 11O mL with ethanol-water (50%) and hydrogenated by the addition of Raney Nickel and the application of hydrogen gas at 1 atmosphere at 50°C. The resulting hydrogenated syrup contained 0.70 g xylitol (42% of theoretical yield).<br>
Example 3: Electrochemical decarboxylation of n L-gulonate salt to produce xylitol<br>
[091]         Sodium L-gulonate (2.67 g, .01222 mol) was dissolved in 43 mL of methanol-water (46.2% v/v). The solution was subjected to electrolysis in a undivided cell with a graphite anode at a constant 9.99 volts for 5.32 watt-hours. The electrolyte solution was then brought to 110 mL with ethanol-water (50%) and hydrogenated by the addition of Raney Nickel and the application of hydrogen gas at 1 atmosphere at 50°C. The resulting hydrogenated syrup contained 0.87 g xylitol (47% of theoretical yield) and 1.10 g sodium L-gulonate (41% of the starting material on a molar basis).<br>
Example 4; Cu(II) decarboxylation of a L-gulonate salt to produce xylitol<br>
[092] Sodium L-gulonate (2.25 g, .0100 mol) was dissolved in 17 mL of water and 35 mg of copper sulfate pentahydrate was added. The pH of the solution was raised to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide (2M). 1.2 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added continuously over the reaction period.    The pH was maintained at 7.0 via<br><br>
addition of sodium hydroxide (2M). After 13 minutes, the temperature was 44°C and the copper had precipitated as an orange suspension. The reaction solution was filtered and then brought to 110 mL with 50% ethanol-water and hydrogenated by the addition of Raney Nickel and the application of hydrogen gas at 1 atmosphere at 50°C. The resulting hydrogenated syrup contained 0.91 g xylitol (58% of theoretical yield) and 0.72 g sodium L-gulonate (32% of the starting material on a molar basis).<br>
Example 5: Hypochlorous acid decarboxylation of a L-gulonate salt to produce xylitol<br>
[093] Sodium L-gulonate (0.244 g, 1.12x10° mol) was dissolved in 15 mL of water, and the temperature was raised to 50°C. 1.5 mL of 13% sodium hypochlorite solution was added. 2M hydrochloric acid was added to lower the pH to 5.O. The reaction was kept at 50°C and maintained at a pH of 5.0 via addition of 2M sodium hydroxide. After 19 min., the reaction solution was brought to 110 mL with 50% ethanol-water and hydrogenated by the addition of Raney Nickel and the application of hydrogen gas at 1 atmosphere at 50°C. The resulting hydrogenated syrup contained 0.16 g xylitol (95% of theoretical yield) and 0.004 g sodium L-gulonate (2% of the starting material on a molar basis).<br>
