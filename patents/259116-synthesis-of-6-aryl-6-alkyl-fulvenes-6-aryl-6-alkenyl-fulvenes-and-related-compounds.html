				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/877,021 entitled "Improved Synthesis of 6-Aryl-6-Alkyl Fulvenes, 6-Aryl-6-Alkenyl Fulvenes, and Related Compounds," which was filed on June 25, 2004 and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of organic synthesis, including synthetic methods for fulvenes, bis(cyclopentadienyl)methanes and related compounds, and <m></m>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metallocenes constitute useful compounds for olefin polymerizations when combined<br>
I<br>
with a cocatalyst such as aluminoxane. It is generally accepted that the properties of the polymers formed using such a combination are determined in large, part by the structural nature of the metallocene, including its steric and electronic features. Therefore, there is a need to devebp new methods to prepare metallocenes that alfow an assortment of diverse substiruents to be incorporated into the metallocene structure.<br>
Fulvenes, having the general formula C4R"4C=CRR' and the structure<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
are often-useful precursors to metallocenes and can provide a means for integrating a range of substituents into the metallocene structure. One aspect of this utility can be seen from the reaction of fulvenes with cyclopentadienyl-, indenyl-, and fluorenyl-Hthium reagents as illustrated in Scheme 1, because the resulting products can be used as ligand precursors to form bridged or a/wa-raetallocenes. ^wtf-metallocene catalysts are useful in -olefin<br><br>
polymerizations and copolymerizations, in part because of impact the tailored ligand set can have on the properties of the resulting polymer.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Therefore, it is of interest to develop new methods to prepare fulvenes that may provide these ligands in higher yields or with greater selectively. It is also of interest to develop new methods to prepare fl/ua-metallocenes based on new fulvene synthetic methods.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention encompasses methods for the selective synthesis of 6-aryl-6-alkyl fulvenes, 6-aryl-6-alkenyl folvenes, and similar compounds, which constitute useful intermediates in preparing metallocene complexes that can be subsequently used as catalyst components in olefin polymerizations. In one aspect, the methods of this invention afford higher chemical selectivity and higher yields of the desired product than were heretofore available. Traditional methods to prepare 6-aryl-6-alkyl fulvenes and 6-aryl-6-alkenyI fulvenes include the reaction of metal alkoxides with cyclopentadienes and ketones or aldehydes in an alcoholic (protic) solvent. While this method can afford some of the desired product, a mixture of isomers or tautomers in varying concentrations is typically generated, thereby rendering isolation, purification, and subsequent use of the desired isomer tedious and difficult.<br>
In one aspect, this present invention provides a method of selectively preparing 6-aryl-6-alkyl fulvenes, 6-aryl-6-alkenyl fulvenes, and similar compounds, having the general formula C4R34C=CR1CH2R2 and the structure<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
or an isomer thereof, wherein R1 is an aryl or substituted aryl group; R2 is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group or hydrogen; and R3, in each instance, is independently chosen from a hydrocafbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group; by reacting aryl-alkylketoiies or aryl-alkenylketones with magnesium-cyclopentadienyl reagents in aptotic solvents. In this aspect, ethereal solvents were typically employed This method afforded the desired fulvene compound either exclusively or in large excess over the undesired isomer, thereby greatly simplifying its isolation and purification. In one aspect, a Grignard cyclopentadienyl reagent was typically used in the synthesis, which' afforded a higher yield of the desired product, in addition to<br>
providing a highly selective reaction.<br>
In   another   aspect,   the   present   invention   provides   a   method	of  making<br>
bis(cyclopentadienyl)methane      compounds,      and      various      analogs	such      as<br>

The following patent applications, filed contemporaneously with the present application, are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties: U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/877,039; U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/876,891; U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/876,930; and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/876,948.<br>
The present invention provides a method of making fulvenes, particularly 6-aryl-6-alkylfulvenes, 6-aryl-6-alkenylfulvenes, and similar compounds, by combining alkyl- or alkenyl-arylketones with magnesium-cyclopentadienyl reagents in nonprotic solvents, including ethereal solvents. This invention also provides for the use of these fulvenes in preparing bis(cyclopentadienyl)methane compounds and related chemicals such as (cyclopentadienyl)(indenyl)methane and (cyclopentadienyl)-(fluorenyl)methane compounds, as well as fl«ya-metallocenes. This invention also provides a process of combining an a-aromatic substituted carbonyl compound of the formula (XTR^HjR2, wherein R1 is an aryl<br>
or substituted aryl group and R2 is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group, or hydrogen, with a magnesium cyclopentadienyl reagent in nonprotic solvents to form fulvenes. Generally, and in another aspect, this invention affords improved yields and enhanced selectivity in fulvene syntheses.<br>
Preparation of Fulvene Compounds<br>
Fulvenes themselves have been known since the early 1900s. See, for example: Chem. Rev. 1953, 53(2), 167; Chem. Rev. 1967, 68(1), 41; Progr. Org. Chem. 1955, 3, 41; Adv. Alicydic Chem. 1968, 2, 59; and J. Org. Chem., 1984, 49, 1849; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These publications, and the references cited therein, describe many of the known methods for formation of fulvenes as well as their various physical properties. Two common methods for preparing fulvenes are as follows: a) the reaction of cyclopentadiene with sodium or potassium alkoxides in the presence of ketones or aldehydes in an alcoholic solvent; arid b) the reaction of cyclopentadiene with ketones or aldehydes in the presence of pyrollidme, also in an alcoholic solvent (see: J. Org. Chem., 1984, 49, 1849). These methods are illustrated herein as equations 1 and 2, respectively, where the results of their application to a ketone precursor having the formula 2, wherein R1 is an aryl (or substituted aryl) group, are demonstrated<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
As equations 1 and 2 indicate, issues of selectivity and yield arise when the ketone comprises an aryl substituent (R1 in the structure), and a hydrocarbyl substituent with at least one a-hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl functionality. In one aspect, for example, when R1<br>
of the formula O=CR1CH2R2 is an aryl or substituted aryl group, and when R2 of this formula is an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic group or hydrogen, employing the method illustrated in equation 1 leads to a mixture of isomeric fulvene compounds 1 and 2, that are difficult to separate by conventional means. Employing the method illustrated in equation 2 for a ketone of the formula 0=CR1CHaR2 described herein affords a reaction that is sufficiently slow and unselective to be undesirable. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the aryl substituent R1 imparts a comparatively higher reactivity to the a-hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group, which likely leads to the poor selectivity observed.<br>
In one aspect, for example, the synthetic methods of the present invention are illustrated herein, though not exhaustively, by the general equations shown in equations 3 and 4. As indicated in these equations, a gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture indicated at least an 80% conversion of the starting ketone to the desired fulvene product was typically obtained, with 100% selectivity, that is, 100% of the fulvene formed constituted the desired isomer.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In another aspect, this invention provides a synthetic approach to 6-aryl-6-alkylfulvenes and 6-aryl-6-alkenyIfulvenes by reacting cyclopentadiene or a cyclopentadiene analog with a base such as an alkyhnagnesium halide in an aprotic (also termed nonprotic) solvent as a reaction medium. Generally, the aprotic solvent used can be an ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, diphenyl ether, tetrahydro&amp;ran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and the like, or combinations thereof Reacting the thus-formed cyclopentadienyl anion with an aryl-alkenylketone or aryl-alkylketone in an aprotic solvent as a reaction medium (such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and the like), and refluxing the solvent as needed, followed by hydrolytic workup or<br>
neutralization using a weak acid (such as dilute hydrochloric acid and the like) affords the desired product<br>
In another aspect, the cyclopentadiene or a cyclopentadiene analog can also be reacted with a dialkyhnagnesium compound in an aprotic solvent as a reaction medium. As disclosed herein for the Grignard reagents, the aprotic solvents used in this case can also be ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, diphenyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and the like.<br>
While not intending to be bound by theory, it is thought that the use of an ethereal solvent such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, diphenyl ether, THF, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or any combination thereof, may assist the reaction of the cyclopentadienyl anion with an aryl-alkenylketone or aryl-alkylketone. It is believed that the acidity of the protons next to a ketone-functional group is due to the aryl substituent, and using the aprotic, ethereal solvents instead of a protic solvent such as an alcohol provides the high selectivity and high yields observed<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a compound having the formula C4R34C=CR1CH2R2 and the structure:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
or an isomer thereof, comprising contacting in a nonprotic solvent:<br>
a)	a ketone of the formula OCR^HkR2; and<br>
b)	a cyclopentadienyl compound comprising Mg(C5R34H)X, Mg(C5R34H)2, or a<br>
combination thereof; followed by<br>
c)	a proton source;<br>
wherein:<br>
R1 is an aryl or substituted aryl group having up to 20 carbon atoms; R2 is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen;<br>
R3, in each instance, is independently chosen from a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen; and X is Cl, Br, or I.<br>
The proton source can be any compound or combination of compounds that can serve as a source of protons to the formal anion formed upon reacting the ketone with the cyclopentadienyl reagent. In this aspect, for example, the proton source can be water, an acid including an aqueous acid, ammonium salts including aqueous solutions of ammonium salts, and the like. For example, aqueous HC1 can be used in this reaction.<br>
All of the R3 substituents on the fidvene structure shown here<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
are not required to be the same, which is indicated by specifying that R3, in each instance, is independently chosen from a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen. Thus, R3 can be chosen such that the Mvene is substituted with 4 hydrogens and no non-hydrogen substituents, with 3 hydrogens and a single non-hydrogen substituent, with 2 hydrogens and 2 non-hydrogen substituents, with 1 hydrogen and 3 non-hydrogen substituents, or with no hydrogens and 4 non-hydrogen substituents.<br>
In one aspect, the possible substitution patterns on the fulvene compound depicted in the generic structure herein lead to the possibility of isomers. For example, when three R3 moieties are independently chosen to be hydrogen, and the fourth R3 moiety is independently chosen to be methyl, the following isomers are possible.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that because the fulvene is prepared by the nucleophilic reaction of a cyclopentadienyl reagent with a ketone, isomers A and B are likely to predominate. The addition of a cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, or fluorenyl anion to a mixture of these isomers renders A and B equivalent and also renders C and D equivalent. However, when the metal complex of the ligand is formed, the complexes derived from A and B are enantiomeric, and the complexes derived from C and D are enantiomeric. Accordingly, when all of the R3 substituents in the fulvene formula C4R34C=CR1CH2R2 are not the same, it is intended that the general structure<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
disclosed herein refers to any isomers that arise from the possible substitution patterns in this<br>
structure.<br>
In another aspect, R1 can be phenyl, naphthyl, or a substituted analog thereof having up to 20 carbon atoms. Thus, for example, R1 can be phenyl or naphthyL Also in this aspect, R2 can be alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, or a substituted analog thereof, having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or hydrogen. Thus, for example, R2 can be alkyl or alkenyl having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms. In still another aspect of this invention, CHaR2 can be:<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene using cyclopentadienyl Grignard reagents<br>
Method 1. AIL round bottomed flask was charged with l-phenyl-4-penten-l-one (50 g, 313 mmol), THF (270 mL), and a stir bar, and cooled to 0 °C. Cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride (325 mL of an approximately 1.1M solution in THF, 345 mmol) was added dropwise via an addition funnel, while maintaining the temperature at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature, refluxed for 3 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. This reaction mixture was then neutralized with 2M HC1, and extracted with pentane. The pentane extracts were dried with sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to afford 70 g of red oil. Elution of this oil through silica" using<br>
heptane afforded 39 g (60% isolated and purified yield) of the product 6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene as a red oil<br>
Method 2. An alternative preparation of 6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene to that detailed in Method 1 is to allow the reaction to proceed at room temperature for about 4 days, prior to neutralizing the reaction mixture with HCL Following a similar workup as that detailed in Method 1, at least about an 80% conversion to the desired product 6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene was obtained, with 100% of this product constituting the desired isorner (100% selectivity).<br>
Method 3. AIL round bottomed flask was charged with l-phenyl-4-penten-l-one (49.1 g, 307 mmol), THF (200 mL), and a stir bar, and cooled in an ice bath. Cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride (330 mL of approximately 1 M solution in THF, 330 mmol) was added dropwise over 1 hour. The pale red solution was stirred overnight"while warming to room temperature. The solution was then refluxed for 4.5 hours, during which time the red color intensified. After being stirred overnight at room temperature again, the solution was acidified by first adding 5.5 g of ammonium chloride in 100 mL of water, and then adding 50 mL of 1 M HCL The product was.extracted with pentane, and the pentane extracts were collected, washed with water, and dried over sodium sulfate. Elution through silica with heptane and concentration under vacuum afforded 38.6 g (55% isolated and purified yield) of the product 6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)folvene as a red oil<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Comparative preparation of6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene using lithium cydopentadienyl<br>
A 1 L round bottomed flask was charged with l-phenyl-4-penten-l-one (38.4 g, 240 mmol), THF (100 mL), and a stir bar, and cooled to -78 °C. Cyclopentadienyl lithium (245 mmol) in THF (200 mL) was added dropwise via an addition funnel while maintaining the temperature at -78 °C. The resulting mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 days. After this time, the reaction mixture was neutralized with 2M HC1 and extracted with pentane. The pentane extracts were collected and dried with sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to afford 46 g of red oil.

A solution of potassium ethoxide (5.30 g, 63 mmol) dissolved in 250 mL of absolute ethanol was prepared This KOEt/EtOH solution was cooled in a dry ice bath and 10 mL of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene was added The solution was stirred for 3 hours at dry ice temperature, after which time 10 mL (62.4 mmol) of l-phenyl-4-penten-l-one was added This solution was stirred for 4 hours at dry ice temperature, then warmed to 5 °C and stirred for 65 hours. While the reaction mixture was then cooled to ice temperature, 50 mL of 3 M HC1, followed by 100 mL of water were added. The product was extracted from the reaction solution with both ether and pentane, and the combined organic layers were washed with water. The resulting solution was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to afford 12.65 g of the crude product as a red oil The desired fulvene, 6-phenyl-6-butenylfulvene, was shown by GC to comprise 77.6% of the red oil, but the undesired isomeric product constituted 15.3 % of the oil The crude oil was chromatographed through silica using hexane to elute the fractions, a process that made it possible to lower the isomeric product to less than 4% of the material. The combined fractions of fulvene obtained in this way weighed 3.32 g (17 %).<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Comparative preparation of 6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene using NaOEt/EtOH<br>
A flask was charged with l-phenyl-4-penten-l-one (45 g of 94 % pure, 264 mmol) and cooled to 0 °C under nitrogen. Sodium ethoxide (100 mL of 21 wt % in ethanol, 268 mmol) was added via an addition funnel followed by addition of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene (43 mL, 528 mmol) via syringe. This reaction was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 4 hours. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC, which indicated that all of the ketone had been consumed Water was added to quench the reaction followed by extraction of the product with pentane. The pentane extract was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to afford a red oil (51.5 g). The desired fulvene was shown by GC to comprise 82% of the product, but the isomeric product constituted 16% of the resulting product.<br><br>
EXAMPLES Comparative preparation of 6-phenyl-6-(3-butenyl)fulvene using lithium cyclopentadienyl<br>
Butyl lithium in hexanes, 59 mL (94.4 mmol), was added to 8.0 mL of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene dissolved in 100 mL of THF and cooled in a dry ice bath. After the addition was complete, the dry ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3.5 hours yielding a white slurry. This slurry was cooled in an ice bath and 15.1 g of l-phenyl-4-penten-1-one (94. 2 mmol) as a solution in 40 mL of THF was added. The ice bath was then removed and the resulting yellow solution was stirred for 18 hours. An aliquot of the reaction solution was analyzed by GC and the ketone-to-product molar ratio was 78:17. After the reaction mixture was stirred for 20 more minutes, the molar ratio was 74:20. Refluxing this reaction mixture for 24 hours gave a ratio of 50:31. Subsequent stirring of the reaction mixture for 5 days at room temperature provided a ratio to 40:37. The reaction was abandoned.<br>

EXAMPLE 9 Preparation of6-phenyl-6-(4-pentenyl)fulvene using cyclopentadienyl Grignard reagents<br>
AIL round bottomed flask was charged with l-phenyl-5-hexene-l-one (see: K6ppl and Alt Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, 2001,165, 23) (50 g, 287 mmol), THF (100 mL), and a stir bar, and cooled to 0 °C. Cyclopentadienyl magnesium chloride (325 mL of an approximately 1.1M solution in THF, 345 mmol) was added dropwise via an addition funnel while maintaining the temperature at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature, then refluxed for 3 hours, and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The reaction was neutralized with 2M HC1, and extracted with pentane. The pentane extracts were dried with sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness affording 67 g of red oil. Elution of this oil through silica using heptane afforded 33 g (52%) of 6-phenyl-6-(4-pentenyl)fulvene as a red oil. 1H NMR (CDCfe, 30°C): 5 7.38 (m, 5H, Csfls), 6.63 (m, 1H), 6.58 (m, 1H), 6.49 (m, 1H), 6.11 (m, 1H, fulvene CH), 5.75 (m, 1H, alkenyl CH), 4.97 (m, 2H, alkenyl C#2), 2.94 (t, 2H),.2.07 (dd, 2H, CH2), 1.53 (t, 2H, C#3).<br>
EXAMPLE 10 Preparation ofl-cyclopentadiene-l-phenylpent-4-ene-l-ol using Grignard reagents<br>
The present invention also provides a method to prepare the corresponding carbinol intermediates, resulting from nucleophilic addition of the cyclopentadienyl-type reagents to the aryl alkyl ketones or aryl alkenyl ketones folbwedby hydrolysis, as follows.<br>
A sample of l-phenylpent-4-ene-l-one 50 mL, 49.7 grams, 310 mmoles) was dissolved in 200 mL of dry THF under nitrogen and the flask was cooled in an ice bath While this solution was stirred vigorously, 350 mL of 1.07 M CpMgCl (375 mmoles;<br><br>
Mg:ketone ratio of 1.2:1) was added over a period of 60 mirmtes. The resulting yellow solution was stirred for 20 hours at room temperature, over which time it developed- a red color. A small aliquot of this reaction solution was then removed and hydrolyzed, folbwed by a gas chromatography analysis (GC) using a flame ionization detector. The major peaks identified by this GC detection were as shown in Table 1.<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 Conditions for obtaining retention times in the GC analysis reported in this Table are described in the General Details section.<br>
Stirring the reaction mixture for an additional day (24 hours) at room temperature produced no further changes in the GC of an aliquot The reaction solution was then refluxed for 3.5 hours. A subsequent GC analysis of an aliquot of this reaction solution, which was then hydrolyzed, revealed that much of the carbinol had been converted to the fulvene, as shown in Table 1. However, it was also observed that the amount of ketone increased during this process. Since the absolute amount of dicyclopentadiene would not have decreased during this process, and while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that this increase in the ketone amount is likely due to the decomposition of some of the carbinol back to the starting material Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, this observation suggests an explanation for why excess CpMgCl works well during the fulvene preparation. Further, the conversion of carbinol to fulvene shown in section B of Table 1 suggests why elevated temperatures, including but not limited to reflux, are useful to convert the carbinol to the fulvene without isolating the carbinol first<br><br>
EXAMPLE 11 Preparation of l-(phenyl)-l-(4-pentenyl)-l-(cydopentadienyl)-l-(fluorenyl)-methane<br>
AIL round bottomed flask was charged with fluorene (23.2 g, 139.6 mmol), THF (400 mL), and a stir bar, and cooled to -78 °C as n-butyl lithium (165 mmol) was slowly added The mixture was warmed to room temperature, stirred overnight, then cooled to 0 °C, and 6-phenyl-6-(4-pentenyl)fulvene (38 g, 171 mmol), dissolved in 400 mL of THF was added via cannula. After the resulting mixture was stirred for two days at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with saturated NHUC1 solution, the organic material extracted with diethyl ether, and the ether extracts dried over anhydrous Na2SC&gt;4. Upon solvent removal, 69.1 g of a yellow oil was isolated Chromatography of this oil through silica using heptane afforded 31.7 g (58%) of the desired ligand, l-(phenyl)-l-(4-pentenyl)-l-(cyclopentadienyl)-l-(fluorenyl)-methane, which was used without further purification.<br>
