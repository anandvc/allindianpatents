				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to flyer spinning machine with aviator drive.<br>
During spinning operations, continuous strand of fibres is sufficiently drawn by speed frames to a diameter suitable for successive drafting and twisting operations. Fly-frames draft roving by attenuating them in preparation for spinning. Roving for drafting is wound on plurality of bobbins from where they are fed to the successive spinning stages.<br>
Incoming strand of fibre is twisted to form a roving which is wound up in a bobbin mounted on a bobbin holding arrangement in a trough. A series of such bobbins and holding arrangements may be provided in a spinning station. For uniform and even winding of roving in bobbins, rotary movement of the bobbin and vertical movement of the holding trough are effected. Even and uniform roving winding ensures better packaging. It is necessary to regulate the speed of rotation of the bobbin in relation to the thickness of the incoming strand of fibres. Rotational speed of the bobbin and the speed of the vertical movement of the trough must also be regulated during the winding process. An empty bobbin at the initial stages of operation must, understandably, be rotated more times to produce uniformity in winding. The package diameter increases as winding continues, and for winding the same length of roving only lesser number of rotations will be required as the operation progresses. Similarly, the speed of vertical movements of the trough that holds the bobbin also needs controlling for even and uniform winding of roving. Trough movement speed must be increased when the roving is thick and vice versa when the roving is relatively thin.<br><br>
Conventional flyer spinning machines have a main drive means for driving the bobbins and flyers and additional driving means to alter the rotational speed of the bobbin. Vertical trough movement is effected by yet another drive means. Introduction of separate drive means for driving different components of the spinning machine is expensive.<br>
In another known embodiment, a conical drive shaft arrangement with changeable gears are connected to the main drive means, from which drive is taken. This method is found disadvantageous as the operation is time consuming. Further, the accuracy levels in vertical movements are not adequately controllable in this embodiment.<br>
We have modified the existing drive arrangement by introducing a variator provided with setting means in the additional drive means. Additional driving means alters the bobbin and simultaneously enable vertical movement of the bobbin holding assembly through the variator thereby avoiding an individual drive. Variator and the setting means provides accuracy of the vertical movements of the trough and reduces the time required for setting and resetting. This arrangement connects a plurality of bobbin and trough assembly and flyers.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a flyer spinning machine with variator drive which comprises at least one bobbin, disposed on a bobbin holding assembly and at least one flyer, a drive means for rotation driving the said bobbin and flyer, the  said drive means being provided with an additional  variator<br><br>
drive operatively connected for altering the bobbin speed, and a variator for enabling vertical movement of the bobbin holding assembly and for regulating its speed.<br>
The trough of the holding assembly is connected to the variator drive means which in turn is connected to the additional drive. Setting or regulating means provided in this variator is for controlling the vertical movements of the bobbin holder to achieve the desired configuration of bobbin winding.<br>
This invention will now be described with particular reference to the diagramatic representation in the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the single figure I, reference numberO^ indicates the main drive and reference numbers^2\ and (3)indicate the additional drive and the variator respectively. Reference numbers(4)4; (j5) show the flyer (4) and the bobbin (5). The bobbin holding assembly consists of vertically movable trough (7) having holding means (6) disposed therein. The main drive and the additional drive are connected in a known manner as illustrated in the drawings. On energisation, the main drive rotates the flyer and bobbin while the additional drive alters the bobbin speed. Variator moves the trough vertically. The trough movement may be adjusted as required with the help of a setting or regulating meansC^^in the variator drive. This arrangement ensures that the bobbin is wound evenly and uniformly, thus ensuring smooth successive operation. Operation of the drive is simple and setting and  resetting the vertical movement of  the  trough  is<br><br>
easy. Though this invention has been described and illustrated herein above with a specific embodiment, obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are understood to be within the scope of this invention claimed in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A flyer-spinning machine with variator drive (2) comprising at least one<br>
bobbin (5) disposed on a bobbin holding assembly (6, 7) and at least one<br>
flyer (4)  a drive means (1) for rotationally driving the said bobbin and<br>
the flyer, the said drive means being provided with an additional variator<br>
drive (2) for altering the bobbin speed, and a variator for enabling<br>
vertical movement of the bobbin holding assembly and for regulating its<br>
speed.<br>
2.	The flyer spinning machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein a plurality of<br>
bobbins, flyers and bobbin holding assemblies are drivably connected to<br>
the said drive means.<br>
3.	The flyer spinning machine as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein the said<br>
bobbin holding assembly consists of vertically movable trough provided<br>
with holding means for holding the bobbins.<br>
4.	The flyer spinning machine as claimed in any of the above mentioned<br>
claims, wherein the variator drive has regulating means (8) for controlling<br>
the vertical movement of the holding assembly.<br>
5.	A flyer spinning machine with variator drive substantially as herein<br>
described with particular reference to figure 1 in the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br></td>
