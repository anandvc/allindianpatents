FRONT BODY COVER STRUCTURE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to front body cover structure provided to a vehicle such as a motorcycle, particularly relates to front body cover structure in which the realization of the similar effect in design to effect when a ventilating hole is provided is enabled without providing the ventilating hole to a windscreen.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
It is well-known that a ventilating hole is provided to a front cowl and a windscreen attached to the upside so as to cover the front of the body of a large-sized motorcycle. The ventilating hole is provided as a measure against negative pressure caused on the rear side of the windscreen. Refer to Patent document 1: Japanese patent No. 2688913<br>
The ventilating hole in the above-mentioned conventional type is also provided to produce effect in design that a sporty feeling is given in addition to the measure against negative pressure. However, as wind and rainwater sometimes enter the rear side of the windscreen from the ventilating hole in running when such a ventilating hole is provided, the structure of a front body cover is made intricate to prevent it and the number of manufacturing processes is also increased. In the meantime, in a small-sized vehicle and others, there is a case that a ventilating hole is not necessarily required to be provided.<br><br>
However, if no ventilating hole is provided, the sporty feeling<br>
cannot be given.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Then, the object of the invention is to enable the realization of a sporty feeling acquired by the ventilating hole of the conventional type even if a ventilating hole is omitted.<br>
To solve the above-mentioned problem, Claim 1 related to front body cover structure is based upon a front body cover provided with a front cowl and a transparent windscreen provided to the upside for covering the front of a vehicle and is characterized in that a concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole open f orward and convex backward is provided to the wind screen.<br>
Claim 2 is based upon Claim 1 and is characterized in that the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole is provided in a part overlapped with a flange provided to the front cowl out of the windscreen, a receiving concave portion for receiving the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole is provided to the flange and the windscreen and the flange are made composite by containing the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole in the receiving concave portion.<br>
Claim 3 is based upon Claim 1 and is characterized in that a pattern part including a logotype and others is formed around the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole.<br>
Claim 4 is based upon Claim 1 and is characterized in that fitting structure is provided to a connection of the<br><br>
windscreen and the front cowl.<br>
Claim 5 is based upon Claim 1 and is characterized in that a plate for receiving the top face of a headlight supported by the front cowl is provided to the inside of the front cowl.<br>
Claim 6 is based upon Claim 5 and is characterized in that a rib is integrated between the flange and the plate.<br>
According to Claim 1, as the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole open forward is provided to the wind screen, the appearance looks as if a ventilating hole existed and a sporty feeling can be realized by the concave portion. Therefore, the similar effect in design to effect when a ventilating hole is provided can be realized without providing the ventilating hole to the wind screen. Besides, as the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole does not pierce the wind screen, wind and rainwater do not penetrate the back of the wind screen, and intricate structure for preventing wind and rainwater in case a ventilating hole is provided and the increase of a manhour for it can be made unnecessary.<br>
Moreover, as the penetration of wind and rainwater is not required to be considered, a degree of freedom in design related to the shape of the windscreen is enhanced. In addition, as the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole is integrated with the windscreen, the strength can be increased, compared with a case that a ventilating hole is provided.<br>
According to Claim 2, as the windscreen and the flange in a ventilating hole are made composite, the strength of the windscreen can be increased. In addition, as the receiving<br><br>
concave portion for receiving the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole is provided to the flange, the compositeness of the windscreen and the flange can be made secure. Besides, in case the flange is a meter visor, the meter visor is made to approach the windscreen, the front of the body can be made compact and intrepidity can be given.<br>
According to Claim 3, as the pattern part is provided close to the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole, the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole is made prominent by the pattern part and a sporty feeling can be increased.<br>
Besides, as the colored flange makes the pattern part prominent as the background color of the pattern part if the flange is colored, the visibility is enhanced.<br>
According to Claim 4, as the fitting structure is provided to the connection of the windscreen and the front cowl, they can be connected only by fitting the windscreen to the front cowl. Therefore, the assembly is facilitated and the strength can be secured.<br>
According to Claim 5, as the plate is provided to the inside of the front cowl and receives the top face of the headlight, the strength for supporting the heavy headlight can be secured.<br>
According to Claim 6, as the rib is provided between the flange and the plate, the strength of the plate is further increased and the plate can support a heavy thing such as the headlight.<br><br>

Referring to the drawings, one embodiment applied to a motorcycle will be described below.<br>
First, referring to Fig. 1, the outline of the whole structure of the motorcycle will be described. The motorcycle is configured as a relatively small-sized vehicle to an extent that the adjustment of negative pressure by a ventilating hole in the windscreen is not required, a front wheel 1 is supported by the lower end of a front fork 2, an upper part of the front fork 2 is turnably supported by a head pipe 3 via an upper bracket 4 and a bottom bracket 5, and the front fork is steered by a handlebar 6.<br><br>
A front cowl 7 is arranged in front of the head pipe 3 and the rear end of the side is attached to the front end of the upper bracket 4. A headlight 8 is provided to the front face of the front cowl 7 and a winker 9 is provided to the center of the side.<br>
A transparent windscreen 10 is attached to the upside of the front cowl 7. A meter 11 is arranged inside the front cowl 7 and is supported by the upper bracket 4 and the front cowl 7.<br>
A reference number 12 denotes a body frame, 13 denotes an engine, 14 denotes a seat, 15 denotes a fuel tank, 16 denotes a rear swing arm, 17 denotes a rear cushion and 18 denotes a rear wheel.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 to 4, an opening 19 shown in Fig. 4 for a large headlight is provided to the center of the front of the front cowl 7 and the headlight 8 is fitted into the opening. As clear from Fig. 2, a substantially U-shaped flange 20 when the flange is viewed from the front is provided to the upside of the front cowl 7.<br>
A lower edge 21 of the windscreen 10 and the right and left side edges 22 are overlapped on the flange 20 and are integrated with the flange, and the lower edge 21 is fitted to a pawl 23 integrated with the center of the flange 20. The right and left side edges 22 are fastened to the flange 20 by screws 24. The windscreen 10 is made of transparent suitable resin.<br>
A concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is integrated with a lower part of the center of the windscreen<br><br>
10 and a pattern part 26 including a logotype and others is formed on it. The pattern part 26 includes arbitrary characters such as a logotype or an arbitrary pattern and is formed by suitable means such as printing and sticking.<br>
The pattern part 26 is provided close to the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 and makes the existence of the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 prominent. A part including the pattern part 26 of the wind screen 10 is overlapped on the meter 11 and a meter visor 27 respectively located close to the inside of the wind screen 10 when the part is viewed from the front as shown in Fig. 2, and the surfaces colored beforehand of these function as background color for making the pattern part 26 prominent. For the background color, arbitrary color that can make the pattern part 26 and the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 prominent such as dark color including black is possible.<br>
The meter visor 27 is a part continuously protruded upward from the front of a case of the meter 11 and as the meter visor is made of resin, it can be colored in arbitrary color. The meter visor 27 can be also formed separately from the case of the meter 11. The flange 20 may be also colored in suitable color as a part of background color.<br>
The front cowl 7 is made of suitable resin and longitudinal ribs 28 are integrated with the upside of the adjacent front cowl 7 inside on the right and left sides of the flange 20. The winker 9 is attached to the right and left sides of the front cowl 7 with the winker protruded on the sides,<br><br>
a fitting 29 is provided to the rear end of the side of the front cowl 7 as shown in Fig. 3, and the front cowl is attached to the upper bracket 4 via the fitting.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5, 7 to 10, the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is open forward, is made convex backward, and is shaped substantially in an inverted triangle when the concave portion is viewed from the front. As shown in Fig. 8, the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 looks as if it was formed by cutting out a lower part of the windscreen 10 when the concave portion is viewed from the side.<br>
As shown on sections in Figs. 5 and 9, a forked overhang 30 is integrated with a lower end 21a under the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 inside, and a fitting groove 31 is formed between the lower end 21a of the windscreen 10 and the forked overhang 30. The concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is composed of an upper part 32 stuck out backward on the upside and a slant part 33 stuck out forward toward the lower end of the windscreen 10 from the rear end.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the center of the flange 20 functions as a receiving concave portion 36 for receiving the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25. The part is equivalent to a slant part 37 inclined backward along the slant part 33. A hole 38 for letting in the overhang portion 30 is made below the slant part 37 and the pawl 23 is opposite to a lower part of the hole 38.<br>
The pawl 23 is protruded upward to be fitted into the fitting groove 31. When the pawl 23 and the fitting groove 31<br><br>
are fitted, the lower edge 21 and a part 7a over the opening are located on the same plane.<br>
A plate 40 stuck out inside is integrally protruded inside from the paxt 7a over the opening below the slant part 37. The part 7a over the opening is a part formed between the flange 20 and the upside of the opening 19.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the longitudinal rib 28 is formed to tie the plate 40 and the flange 20 and reinforces the plate 40. A hole 41 is made in the plate 40 and a protrusion 42 provided to the upside of the headlight 8 is fitted into the hole.<br>
The plate 40 also supports the meter 11 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
As clear from Fig. 9, the upper edge 34 of the windscreen 10 is in the shape of a bead and as shown in Fig. 8, mounting holes 35 are provided to the side edge 22. The side edge 22 is overlapped on the flange 20 made lower by one step as shown in Fig. 10 of the front cowl 7.<br>
Next, the action of this embodiment will be described. First, to attach the windscreen 10 to the front cowl 7, the lower edge 21 of the windscreen 10 is fitted to the center of the flange 20 by fitting the pawl 23 into the fitting groove 31 as shown in Fig. 5, the side edge 22 is overlapped with the flange 20 and the sides are fastened by the screws 24. Hereby, the windscreen 10 can be promptly attached to the front cowl 7. At this time, the windscreen 10 and the front cowl 7 respectively connected form the same plane.<br>
When the vehicle is run in this state, wind and rainwater<br><br>
hit the front cowl 7 and the windscreen 10, however, as the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is concave and does not pierce the windscreen 10, wind and rainwater do not penetrate inside through the concave portion. Intricate structure for preventing wind and rainwater in case a ventilating hole is provided and the increase of a manhour for the structure can be made unnecessary.<br>
Moreover, though a ventilating hole is omitted in the case of a small-sized motorcycle, a sporty feeling which produces the similar effect in design to effect when a ventilating hole is provided can be given by the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25.<br>
In addition, as the penetration of wind and rainwater is not required to be considered, a degree of freedom in design related to the shape of the wind screen is enhanced. In addition, as the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is integrated with the windscreen 10, the strength can be increased, compared with a case that a ventilating hole is provided.<br>
Besides, as the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 of the windscreen 10 and the flange 20 are composite, the strength of the windscreen can be increased. In addition, as the receiving concave portion 36 for receiving the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is provided to the flange 20, the compositeness of the windscreen 10 and the flange 20 can be made secure.<br>
Further, as the pattern part 26 is provided close to the concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25, the<br><br>
concave portion substituted for a ventilating hole 25 is made prominent by the pattern part 26 and a sporty feeling can be increased. Besides, as the meter visor 27 located close to the inside of the windscreen 10 and the front of the case of the meter 11 are overlapped with the pattern part 26 and the colored surfaces make a pattern prominent as the background color of the pattern part 26, the visibility is enhanced. In addition, the front of the body can be made compact by bringing the meter visor 27 close to the windscreen 10 and intrepidity can be given.<br>
Besides, as the fitting structure is provided to the connection of the windscreen 10 and the front cowl, both can be connected only by fitting the windscreen to the front cowl. Therefore, assembly is facilitated and the strength can be secured.<br>
Further, as the plate 40 is provided to the inside of the front cowl 7 and receives the top face of the headlight 8, the strength for supporting the heavy headlight 8 can be secured. In addition, the longitudinal rib 28 is provided between the flange 20 and the plate 40, the strength of the plate 40 is further increased and a heavy thing such as the headlight 8 can be supported.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment and can be variously transformed and applied within the principle of the invention. For example, a vehicle to which the front body cover can be applied is not limited to a motorcycle and the front body cover can be applied to a three-wheeled vehicle and a buggy.<br><br><br>
