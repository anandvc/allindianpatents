				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ACTIVE VOLTAGE<br>
CONTROL OF ELECTRIC MOTORS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to controlling electric<br>
drives, and more particularly relates to apparatus and methods for voltage<br>
control of electric motors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A voltage source inverter may be used to control the phase currents<br>
of a three-phase alternating current (AC) motor, such as incorporated in<br>
electric drives. Some voltage source inverters employ a switching circuit<br>
(e.g., based on semiconductor switches) to regulate these phase currents and<br>
thus, control the fundamental output voltage component of the voltage source<br>
inverter. The capacity to activate/deactivate any given switch of the voltage<br>
source inverter is typically provided by a gate drive circuit, which provides a<br>
gate drive supply voltage to the switch.<br>
[0003] Most conventional gate drive circuits are designed with a fixed<br>
supply voltage, and this supply voltage is typically selected based on a balance<br>
of considerations to account for a number of performance trade-offs. These<br>
trade-offs may impact delays, required dead-time, transient response, fault<br>
response, or the like. Additionally, the voltage source inverter may be<br>
required to operate over a wide temperature range and with wide fluctuations<br>
of the main power supply voltage. The supply voltage for the gate drive<br>
circuit is often selected such that the voltage source inverter can operate over<br>
most, if not all, of these operating conditions and differences resulting from<br>
manufacturing tolerances.<br><br>
[0004] In general, the supply voltage for the gate drive circuit is typically<br>
maintained at a fixed level below a maximum value for periods of elevated<br>
high voltage direct current (DC) supply voltage levels (e.g., elevated DC link<br>
voltage). At times, the voltage source inverter may encounter thermal stresses,<br>
and during periods of low output electrical frequency, the thermal stresses may<br>
not be evenly distributed among the inverter switches. For example, uneven<br>
distribution of thermal stresses may occur when the thermal time constant of<br>
the inverter is slower than the change in the electrical output angle of the<br>
inverter. Typically, this occurs for output electrical fundamental frequencies<br>
less than about 3 Hz to a stall condition at about 0 Hz. To thermally protect<br>
the inverter switches, the electrical output of the voltage source inverter may<br>
be restricted. This generally reduces the current carrying capacity of the<br>
inverter. In the past, the silicon die area of the inverter may be increased to<br>
increase the current carrying capacity and thereby offset this reduction.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide methods and apparatus for<br>
dynamically controlling a voltage source inverter that reduces conduction<br>
losses during low-speed, high-current conditions. In addition, it is desirable to<br>
provide methods and apparatus for increasing the current carrying capacity of<br>
a voltage source inverter while limiting the losses for a non-varying silicon die<br>
area of the inverter. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics<br>
of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed<br>
description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Methods and apparatus are provided for controlling a voltage<br>
source inverter that reduces voltage distortion effects in electric motors. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, a method for controlling an electric motor via an<br>
inverter is provided. The inverter is configured to receive a gate voltage and<br><br>
further configured to provide an output voltage to the electric motor in<br>
response to the gate voltage. The method includes, but is not necessarily<br>
limited to, modifying the gate voltage based on a speed of the electric motor.<br>
[0007] In another exemplary embodiment, a method for controlling an<br>
inverter is provided. The inverter is operable to provide an output voltage to<br>
an electric motor. The method includes, but is not necessarily limited to,<br>
determining if a commanded output frequency of the inverter does not exceed<br>
a first pre-determined threshold, determining, if the commanded output<br>
frequency does not exceed the first pre-determined threshold, if a commanded<br>
stator current of the inverter exceeds a second pre-determined threshold,<br>
producing a first command if the commanded stator current exceeds the<br>
second pre-determined threshold, and producing a second command if the<br>
commanded stator current does not exceed the second threshold. The inverter<br>
receives a first gate voltage in response to the first command and provides the<br>
output voltage in response to the first gate voltage. The inverter receives a<br>
second gate voltage in response to the second command and provides the<br>
output voltage in response to the second gate voltage. The first gate voltage is<br>
greater than the second gate voltage.<br>
[0008] In another exemplary embodiment, an inverter is provided<br>
including, but not necessarily limited to, a gate drive circuit having an input<br>
and having an output configured to couple to a switch network, and a<br>
controller coupled to the input of the gate drive circuit. The gate drive circuit<br>
is configured to produce provide a gate voltage to the switch network, and the<br>
switch network is operable to produce an output voltage to an electric motor in<br>
response to the gate voltage. The controller is configured to modify the gate<br>
voltage based on a speed of the electric motor.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

elements, and<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0014] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0015] Methods and apparatus are provided for dynamically changing and<br>
regulating a gate drive voltage of an inverter providing an output voltage to an<br>
electric motor. In one embodiment, the gate drive voltage is increased during<br>
low-speed, high-current conditions to reduce conduction losses of the inverter<br>
and support an increased current-carrying capacity of the inverter, particularly<br>
when inverter thermal losses (e.g., associated with elevated current levels) are<br>
not evenly distributed in the inverter. Additionally, lower gate drive voltages<br>
may be employed during inverter conditions of higher speeds and elevated<br>
high-voltage supply conditions to increase the operating margin of the inverter<br>
switches during fault conditions.<br><br>
[0016] Referring to FIG. 1, an electric drive system 10 is shown in<br>
accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
electric drive system 10 comprises a controller 31, an inverter circuit 30<br>
having an input coupled to an output of the controller 31, and an electric motor<br>
12 (e.g., an alternating current (AC) motor) coupled to an output of the<br>
inverter circuit 30. Generally, the controller 31 controls the switching action<br>
of the inverter circuit 30, and the inverter circuit 30 produces an AC voltage<br>
for driving the electric motor 12. The electric motor 12 may be any<br>
conventional AC motor (e.g., a permanent magnet machine or the like)<br>
commonly used in vehicles (e.g., hybrid electric vehicles or the like).<br>
[0017] In one embodiment, the controller 31 produces a pulse width<br>
modulation (PWM) signal for controlling the switching action of the inverter<br>
circuit 30. The controller 31 may also receive a signal (e.g., another PWM<br>
signal) and produce the PWM signal to control the inverter circuit 30<br>
therefrom. Additionally, the controller 31 monitors various operating<br>
parameters and conditions of the electric drive system 10. For example, the<br>
controller 31 monitors the levels of a main high voltage (e.g., a direct current<br>
(DC) supply voltage) supplied to the inverter circuit 30 for fluctuations (e.g.,<br>
for an elevated value), the inverter temperature, various commanded values<br>
and actual values (e.g., a commanded output frequency of the inverter circuit<br>
30 and a commanded output current of the inverter circuit 30), or the like.<br>
[0018] The inverter circuit 30 receives the PWM signal and converts this<br>
signal to a voltage waveform for driving the electric motor 12. In one<br>
embodiment, the inverter circuit 30 is a three-phase voltage source inverter.<br>
The inverter circuit 30 converts a supply voltage (VdC) into an AC voltage,<br>
which is used to drive the electric motor 12. For example, the inverter 14<br>
produces three-phase voltages (e.g., Va, Vb, Vc) from a supply potential (e.g., a<br>
battery potential or DC bus voltage) based on the PWM signal and drives the<br>
electric motor 12 with the three-phase voltages. The inverter circuit 30 can<br><br>
also vary the amount of voltage applied to the electric motor 12, thus allowing<br>
the controller 31 to control the phase currents of the electric motor 12.<br>
[0019] It will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention described<br>
herein may comprise one or more conventional processors and stored program<br>
instructions that control the one or more processors to implement, in<br>
conjunction with certain non-processor circuits (e.g., switching network),<br>
some, most, or all of the functions for controlling/modifying signals supplied<br>
to the inverter circuit 30 as described herein. As such, these functions may be<br>
interpreted as steps of a method for controlling an inverter. Alternatively,<br>
some or all functions could be implemented by a state machine that has no<br>
stored program instructions, or in one or more application specific integrated<br>
circuits (ASICs), in which each function or some combinations of certain of<br>
the functions are implemented as custom logic. Additionally, a combination<br>
of the two approaches could be used.<br>
[0020] FIG. 2 is a circuit diagram of the inverter circuit 30 shown in FIG.<br>
1. The inverter circuit 30 is a three-phase circuit coupled to the electric motor<br>
12. More specifically, the inverter circuit 30 comprises voltage source 14, 16<br>
and a switch network having a first input coupled to the voltage source 14, 16<br>
and an output configured to be coupled to the electric motor 12. Although the<br>
voltage source 14, 16 is shown as a distributed DC link with two series<br>
sources (e.g., a first series source 14 and a second series source 16), a single<br>
voltage source may be used.<br>
[0021] The switch network comprises three pairs of series switches with<br>
antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch) corresponding to each of<br>
the phases. Each of the pairs of series switches comprises a first switch 18,<br>
22, and 26 having a first terminal coupled to a positive electrode of the voltage<br>
source 14, 16 and a second switch 20, 24, and 28 having a first terminal<br>
coupled to a negative electrode of the voltage source 14, 16 and having a<br>
second terminal coupled to a second terminal of the first switch 18, 22, and 26,<br><br>
respectively. Although not shown, the controller 31, shown in FIG. 1, may<br>
also monitor the switching cycle of the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 and<br>
the output voltage of the inverter circuit 30.<br>
[0022] In one embodiment, each of the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28<br>
is a combination of a transistor (e.g., an insulated gate bipolar transistor<br>
(IGBT), a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), or the<br>
like) coupled in anti-parallel with a diode. This switch-diode combination<br>
allows the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 to bi-directionally conduct<br>
current and uni-directionally block voltage. To regulate phase currents (ia, ib,<br>
ic) of the electric motor 12, a switch pair (e.g., for a particular phase leg) is<br>
controlled using a pulse width modulation (PWM) method such that one of the<br>
switches in the switch pair is "on" and the other switch in the switch pair is<br>
"off." For example, the switch pair in a phase leg of the three-phase voltage<br>
source inverter operates in a complimentary fashion such that one switch of<br>
the switch pair is always "on" and the other switch of the switch pair is always<br>
"off."<br>
[0023] In practice, a blanking time, or dead-time, is typically inserted<br>
during each transition of a switching state of the voltage source inverter. The<br>
dead-time is a short interval during which both switches are gated "off." This<br>
prevents both switches in a particular phase leg from simultaneously being<br>
"on," which could short-circuit the voltage source inverter. Conventional<br>
PWM methods typically switch two phases of the inverter during any given<br>
switching cycle with the remaining phase having one switch continuously<br>
"on." The result of switching action is to produce the three-phase voltages<br>
(e.g., Va, Vb, Vc) from the supply potential (e.g., DC bus voltage) based on the<br>
PWM signal and drive the electric motor 12 with the three-phase voltages.<br>
[0024] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a portion of the inverter<br>
circuit 30 shown in FIG. 2 in greater detail. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, any<br>
one of the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 may be configured as a<br><br>
semiconductor switch 32 having first and second terminals coupled in anti-<br>
parallel with a diode 33, in one embodiment. For example, in one<br>
configuration of the switch 18 (or of the switches 22 and 26), the first terminal<br>
(e.g., a collector) of the semiconductor switch 32 is configured to couple to a<br>
positive switch connection (e.g., the positive electrode of the voltage source<br>
14, 16) and the second terminal (e.g., an emitter) of the semiconductor switch<br>
32 is configured to couple to a negative switch connection (e.g., one of the<br>
windings of the electric motor 12). In this example, the diode 33 has an anode<br>
coupled to the second terminal of the semiconductor switch 32 and has a<br>
cathode coupled to the first terminal of the semiconductor switch 32. In<br>
another example, in one configuration of the switch 20 (or of the switches 24<br>
and 28), the first terminal (e.g., the collector) is configured to couple to a<br>
positive switch connection (e.g., one of the windings of the electric motor 12)<br>
and the second terminal (e.g., the emitter) of the semiconductor switch 32 is<br>
configured to couple to a negative switch connection (e.g., the negative<br>
electrode of the voltage source 14, 16).<br>
[0025] The control capacity to turn "on" or turn "off any of the switches<br>
18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28 is provided by a gate drive circuit. In this<br>
embodiment, a gate drive circuit 34 is coupled to the semiconductor switch 32<br>
(e.g., at the gate or base of the semiconductor switch 32). The gate drive<br>
circuit 34 is powered by a power supply (not shown). For example, the gate<br>
drive circuit 34 is configured to couple to a positive terminal and a common<br>
terminal of the power supply, and thereby receives a gate drive positive supply<br>
voltage and a gate drive common supply voltage from the power supply. The<br>
gate drive positive supply voltage and/or the gate drive common supply<br>
voltage are independently controllable from the main power supply voltage<br>
(e.g., the DC bus voltage) to the semiconductor switch 32 and diode 33.<br>
Based on the gate drive positive supply voltage and the gate drive common<br>
supply voltage, the gate drive circuit provides a gate voltage to the<br><br>
semiconductor switch 32. Additionally, the gate drive circuit 34 may contain<br>
any necessary signal processing (e.g., isolation, level-shifting, or the like),<br>
additional fault protection circuitry, or the like, to control the semiconductor<br>
switch 32 and diode 33.<br>
[0026] In general, a higher gate drive supply voltage causes the<br>
semiconductor switch 32 to achieve a deeper state of saturation. This reduces<br>
the on-state resistance of the switch. Reducing the on-state resistance of the<br>
switch reduces the conduction losses in the switch for a given current level.<br>
During periods of low output electrical frequency (e.g., during low speeds of<br>
the electric motor 12), the thermal stresses are generally not evenly distributed<br>
among the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28. Typically, this occurs when the<br>
thermal time constant of the inverter circuit 30 is slower than the change of<br>
electrical output angle (e.g., for output electrical fundamental frequencies less<br>
than about 3 Hz).<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the electrical output of the inverter circuit 30 is<br>
restricted (e.g., by the controller 31) at low output frequencies (e.g., less than<br>
about 3 Hz) to account for the uneven distribution of thermal stresses among<br>
the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28. This typically results in a reduced<br>
current-carrying capacity of the inverter circuit 30 at low output frequencies.<br>
To increase the current-carrying capacity of the inverter circuit 30, while<br>
maintaining this operating margin, conduction losses can be decreased by<br>
actively increasing the gate voltage provided by the gate drive circuit 34 to the<br>
semiconductor switch 32. Decreasing the conduction losses generally permits<br>
an increase in the current-carrying capacity of the semiconductor switch 32<br>
while limiting the losses associated with a given silicon area of the inverter<br>
circuit 30.<br><br>
[0028] By monitoring the operating parameters and conditions of the<br>
electric motor 12, the controller 31 can compare one or more of these<br>
operating parameters and conditions with one or more thresholds to provide a<br>
basis for commanding a gate voltage to be produced by the inverter circuit 30.<br>
In one embodiment, the gate drive positive supply voltage and/or the gate<br>
drive common supply voltage is regulated (e.g., directly or indirectly by the<br>
controller 31) in response to the commanded gate voltage.<br>
[0029] By actively controlling the gate voltage provided by the gate drive<br>
circuit 34, and thus controlling the associated conduction losses, the current-<br>
carrying capacity of the inverter circuit 30 may be increased during periods of<br>
operation when the inverter circuit 30 is thermally limited (e.g., during<br>
operation of the inverter circuit 30 at low output frequencies, which is<br>
associated with low operating speeds of the electric motor 12). In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the gate voltage provided by the gate drive circuit 34<br>
is actively controlled to maximize the current-carrying capacity of the inverter<br>
circuit 30 without compromising the operating margins which may occur due<br>
to an elevated supply voltage (e.g., based on the gate drive positive supply<br>
voltage and/or the gate drive common supply voltage) to the gate drive circuit<br>
34.<br>
[0030] FIG. 4 is a method 100 for controlling an inverter in accordance<br>
with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In general, a gate<br>
voltage received by the inverter is modified based on a speed of the electric<br>
motor. In one embodiment, operating conditions of the electric motor are<br>
compared with one or more thresholds to provide a basis for selecting a<br>
commanded gate voltage. Referring to FIGS. 1-4, a determination is made as<br>
to if one or more operating conditions of the electric motor 12 meets<br>
dissipation conditions, as indicated at step 105. During operation of the<br>
inverter circuit 30, the inverter circuit 30 may have an inverter temperature.<br>
The controller 31 can compare the current DC supply voltage with a pre-<br><br>
determined elevated voltage level and compare the inverter temperature with a<br>
pre-determined temperature to determine if the electric motor 12 and/or<br>
inverter circuit 30 are operating in a state that can support an increased gate<br>
voltage. For example, for sufficient dissipation of gate drive losses due to an<br>
elevated gate voltage, the DC supply voltage should be less than the pre-<br>
determined elevated voltage level and the inverter temperature should be less<br>
than the pre-determined elevated temperature. The values of the pre-<br>
determined elevated voltage level and the pre-determined elevated temperature<br>
may be selected based on the historical performance of the electric motor 12<br>
and/or the inverter circuit 30 under various conditions, one or more device<br>
tolerances, system performance requirements, or the like.<br>
[0031] If the dissipation conditions are met, a commanded output<br>
frequency (ωr ) of the inverter circuit 30 is compared with a pre-determined<br>
frequency threshold (ωthreshold) to determine if the commanded output<br>
frequency does not exceed this frequency threshold, as indicated at step 110.<br>
For example, if the DC supply voltage is less than the pre-determined elevated<br>
voltage level and the inverter temperature is less than the pre-determined<br>
elevated temperature, the commanded output frequency is compared with the<br>
frequency threshold. If the commanded output frequency does not exceed the<br>
frequency threshold, a commanded stator current (Is ) of the inverter circuit 30<br>
is compared with a current threshold (tthreshold) to determined if the commanded<br>
stator current exceeds the current threshold, as indicated at step 115. In one<br>
embodiment, the current threshold is modeled with a hysteresis, and the<br>
amplitude of the commanded stator current is compared to this hysteresis.<br>
[0032] If the commanded stator current exceeds the current threshold, a<br>
first command is produced, as indicated at step 120. For example, if the<br>
commanded stator current exceeds the current threshold, the controller 31<br>
produces a gate voltage command (Vgate*) for an increased gate voltage (Vhigh)<br>
(e.g., Vgate* = Vhigh). The inverter circuit 30 receives the increased gate voltage<br><br>
(e.g., from the gate drive circuit 34) in response to the first command and<br>
provides the output voltage in response to the increased gate voltage. If the<br>
commanded stator current does not exceed the current threshold, a second<br>
command is produced (e.g., by the controller 31), as indicated at step 125. For<br>
example, if the commanded stator current does not exceed the current<br>
threshold, the controller 31 produces a gate voltage command (Vgate*) for a<br>
decreased or nominal gate voltage (Vlow) (e.g., Vgate* = Vlow). The inverter<br>
circuit 30 receives the nominal gate voltage in response to the second<br>
command and provides the output voltage in response to the nominal gate<br>
voltage. The second command is also produced if the dissipation conditions<br>
are not met or if the commanded output frequency exceeds the frequency<br>
threshold.<br>
[0033] In another embodiment, a third command is produced by the<br>
controller 31 if the commanded output frequency of the inverter exceeds<br>
another pre-determined frequency threshold. The inverter circuit 30 receives a<br>
decreased gate voltage in response to the third command and provides the<br>
output voltage in response to the decreased gate voltage. The decreased gate<br>
voltage may be less than the nominal gate voltage, or simply the nominal gate<br>
drive voltage. Employing lower gate voltages (e.g., lower than the nominal<br>
gate voltage) under conditions of higher speeds of the electric motor 12 and<br>
elevated high-voltage supply conditions (e.g., elevated DC supply voltage<br>
levels) permits an increased operating margin of the switches 18, 20, 22, 24,<br>
26, and 28, particularly under fault conditions.<br>
[0034] In general, the gate voltage is increased if the speed of the electric<br>
motor 12 is less than a pre-determined threshold, in one embodiment. For<br>
example, the inverter circuit 30 is configured to receive a first gate voltage and<br>
has a first current capacity associated with the first gate voltage. The first gate<br>
voltage may be increased to a second gate voltage if the speed of the electric<br>
motor 12 is less than the pre-determined threshold (e.g., if a rotational speed of<br><br>
the electric motor 12 is less than about 3 Hz). The inverter circuit 30 produces<br>
an output voltage in response to the second gate voltage and provides the<br>
output voltage to the electric motor 12 to drive the same. When the speed of<br>
the electric motor 12 is less than the pre-determined threshold, the first current<br>
capacity is reduced (e.g., as a result of restricting the electrical output of the<br>
inverter circuit 30 to account for the uneven distribution of thermal stresses<br>
among the switches 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28). By increasing the first gate<br>
voltage to the second gate voltage, the first current capacity is increased to a<br>
second current capacity.<br>
