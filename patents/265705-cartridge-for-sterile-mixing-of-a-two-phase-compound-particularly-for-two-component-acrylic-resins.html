				<td>CARTRIDGE FOR STERILE MIXING OF A TWO-PHASE COMPOUND, PARTICULARLY FOR TWO-COMPONENT ACRYLIC RESINS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention finds its application in the field of devices and methods<br>
for physical and chemical mixing of products and refers particularly to a<br>
cartridge for sterile mixing of a two-phase compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
As is known, in arthroplasty operations, performed to treat bone or vertebra<br>
pathologies, and in operations for the implanting and stabilisation of bone<br>
prostheses, acrylic resins or bone cements are usually used to be introduced in<br>
the specific area to be treated.<br>
The materials normally used in this field of surgery consist of a liquid phase,<br>
generally monomeric, used as a solvent for the polymerisation of a resin in<br>
powder form, to which may be added antibiotic drags, promoters of growth or<br>
the like.<br>
For these operations, the resin must be prepared directly in the operating fheatre.<br>
Consequently, the two phases are initially enclosed in two separate containers<br>
and then mixed immediately before introduction into the bone or vertebra area<br>
to be treated.<br>
Considering the critical nature of these types of operations, it is most important<br>
that the utmost sterility of the resin and the resin dispensing devices be<br>
guaranteed at all stages.<br>
Normally, the liquid is kept inside a plastic bag or a glass phial and then poured<br>
into a container in which powder has been previously collected. Subsequently,<br>
an operator mixes the two components using a spatula driven manually or<br>
mechanically. Finally, the compound thus  obtained is introduced into  a<br>
dispensing syringe and then injected under pressure through a special needle,<br>
into the bone cavity of the implant.<br>
Such known solutions have the evident and recognised disadvantage of placing<br>
the compound into contact with the outside environment, thereby negatively<br>
affecting the sterility of the operation and making the resin a hazardous vehicle<br><br>
of infections for the person undergoing therapy. At the same time, the operator is placed in contact with a highly-reactive and toxic monomeric liquid, the vapours of which can freely spread in the work environment, with high risk of inhalation by the operator.<br>
The preparation and the final composition of the mixture is, furthermore, strongly dependent on the particular skill of the operator, and so the risk exists of obtaining cements that are not perfectly homogeneous or, again, with incorrect proportions between the two phases.<br>
In an attempt to overcome the above disadvantages, various solutions have been placed at disposal whereby one or more of such disadvantages are overcome. From US-A-5435645, in the name of the same applicant, a device is known for mixing bone cements in which the preparation of the cement is carried out in conditions of sterility and safety for the operator. The liquid is in fact initially placed inside a first chamber and then forced to pass into a second chamber containing the powder. This way a cement is also obtained that has the right proportions between monomer and powder.<br>
A drawback of such solution is however represented by the fact that the mixing of the two phases is done by manually shaking the whole device. This operation thus strongly depends on the skill of the single mixing operator. Being naturally impossible to precisely establish the shaking time and energy required to obtain a uniform component mix, it follows that the compound is not always shaken enough and this does not therefore show the most suitable physical characteristics. The operation is also not at all easy.<br>
From WO-A-0183094 a device is known for mixing a bone cement in which the mixture of liquid and solid is favoured by the sliding of an agitator disc inside the mixing chamber. This way, a uniform compound is produced of correct phase proportions. Nevertheless, an evident disadvantage of such solution is represented by the fact that the liquid phase is initially taken from a container by means of a common syringe and then introduced into the mixing chamber. These phases therefore do not guarantee absolute sterility of the cement besides being inconvenient and dangerous for the operator.<br><br>
From documents WO 97/18031. US 5 934 803, US 6 017 349 A,WO 99/37256 A, US 2003/021180 A1, US 2004/066706 A1, and US 6 024 480 A there are known other solutions and devices for mixing together a liquid and a solid component or phase, so as to obtain a two-phase compound, in which in particular the two phases are mixed by suitable mixing means, operable manually from the outside and provided either for moving axially inside the device or to rotate about an axis. However even these known devices have not totally exempt from drawbacks, and in particular they would request to have a more compact construction, as well as a use involving simpler manual operations and a more practical handling. In particular, at least for some of them, it would be desirable that the user have not to handle and use auxiliary tools, other than the device itself, for performing the mixing and dispensing steps of the compound, and/or even to remove from the mixing device the container for one of the basic phases, namely the liquid phase, once such container has been used and emptied of the liquid phase contained therein. Disclosure of the Invention<br><br>
The purpose of this invention is to overcome the above drawbacks and make a<br>
cartridge for mixing a two-phase compound with clearly efficient features and<br>
which is relatively inexpensive.<br>
A particular purpose is to make a cartridge for mixing a two-phase compound<br>
that permits obtaining a compound with homogeneous chemical, physical and<br>
mechanical characteristics in conditions of absolute sterility.<br>
A further purpose is to make a cartridge for mixing a two-phase compound<br>
which is easy and safe to use for each operator.<br>
Such purposes, as well as others which will appear clearer later on, are achieved<br>
by a cartridge for the sterile mixing of a two-phase compound, as in claim 1,<br>
comprising a first tubular body defining a first collection chamber substantially<br>
longitudinal for a solid phase, a second tubular body defining a second<br>
collection chamber for a liquid phase, means for mixing the liquid phase with<br>
the solid phase, characterized by the fact that the mixing means comprise<br>
agitator means acting on the mixture inside the first chamber with the first<br>
tubular body in substantially stationary conditions.<br>
Thanks to this particular configuration, the cartridge according to the invention<br>
favours the dispersion of the solid phase inside the liquid phase thus making it<br>
possible to obtain a compound with uniform chemical, physical and mechanical<br>
properties in conditions of absolute sterility. The presence of agitator means in<br>
fact permits the uniform diffusion of the solid phase in the liquid phase, thereby<br>
ensuring perfect component mixing homogeneousness.<br>
Advantageously, the agitator means can include a mobile agitator element<br>
which will be housed inside the first chamber and can be at least partially<br>
hollow and will be preferably transversal and shaped like a grid.<br>
Preferably, the mobile agitator element can be coupled to means of movement<br>
that can be operated by an operator.<br>
Advantageously, the means of movement can include a gripping element<br>
outside the first and second chamber and rigidly coupled to the mobile agitator<br>
element by means of suitable linking means. The latter may, in turn, comprise at<br>
least one, preferably a pair of rods with a first end connected to the gripping<br>
element and a second end connected to the mobile agitator element.<br><br>
Preferably, the first tubular body can feature a top cover with at least a first<br>
guide opening for the connection rod which can be shaped like a slot.<br>
Thanks to this characteristic, it will be possible to make a cartridge for mixing a<br>
two-phase compound that is easy and safe to use by each operator. The agitator<br>
element will in fact be of simple and light manufacture and may, furthermore,<br>
be easily operated by means of the alternate movement of the grip element and<br>
with minimum expenditure of energy. Moreover, the characteristics of the<br>
compound will always be reproducible to the same extent.<br>
As required, the means for transferring the liquid phase into the first chamber<br>
can comprise at least one through cavity made on the end portion of the second<br>
tubular body.<br>
Preferably, the transfer means can comprise pressure means operating between<br>
the first and the second chamber and, according to a particular form of<br>
embodiment, the pressure means can feature an open portion of the side wall of<br>
the  second tubular  body  enclosed by  an  elastically yielding  membrane<br>
deformable towards the inside.<br>
Thanks to this latter characteristic, during mixing, the compound components<br>
are prevented from coming into contact with the outside and sterility is<br>
maintained.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear even more<br>
evident from the detailed description of a preferred, but not exclusive, form of<br>
embodiment of a mixing cartridge according to this invention, illustrated by<br>
way of non limiting example in the attached drawings, wherein:<br>
FIG. 1 is a front view of a cartridge according to the invention in a first<br>
preferred embodiment;<br>
FIG.2 is an exploded view of cartridge of FIG. I;<br>
FIG.3 is an enlarged view of a detail of FIG.2;<br>
FIG.4 is a view from above of a first detail of FIG. 1;<br>
FIG.5 is a section view according to the tracing plan /-J of a further detail of the<br>
cartridge in FIG. 1;<br>
FIG.6 is a front view of a cartridge according to the invention in a second<br><br>
preferred form of embodiment.<br>
Ways of carrying out the invention<br>
With reference to the above mentioned figures, the cartridge according to the<br>
invention, generally designated by reference numeral 1, may be used to mix, in<br>
sterile  conditions,  the  components   of a bone  cement  acrylic  resin  for<br>
arthroplasty operations or bone or joint prostheses implants. The compound will<br>
consist of a liquid phase, generally monomeric, and of a solid phase in powder<br>
state, if necessary with the addition of antibiotic agents or growth promoters,<br>
which polymerises once dissolved in the liquid phase. According to another<br>
possible use, the compound may also be a pharmaceutical product chosen from<br>
among the antibiotics, vitamins or the like. The two phases will, in any case, be<br>
initially kept separate.<br>
As shown particularly in Figures 1 and 2, the cartridge comprises a first tubular<br>
body 2, defining a first collection chamber 3 substantially longitudinal for the<br>
solid phase, and a second tubular body 4, defining a second collection chamber<br>
5 for the liquid phase. The sterile transit of the liquid phase from the second<br>
chamber 5 into the first chamber 3 is by means of suitable transfer means 6<br>
which maintain sterility.<br>
The different parts of the cartridge 1 can be made of plastic, rigid or semi-rigid,<br>
with suitable stress resistance characteristics.<br>
Preferably the material will be transparent and the cartridge 1 will be of the<br>
disposable type.<br>
According to the invention, means 7 are comprised for mixing the liquid phase<br>
with the solid phase which comprise further agitator means 8 to favour the<br>
dispersion of the solid phase inside the liquid phase while keeping the first<br>
tubular body 2 substantially stationary.<br>
As illustrated, the second tubular body 4 features the lower end portion 9<br>
housed sliding and coaxially inside the first tubular body 2.<br>
Suitably, at end portion 9 is a ring-shaped flange 10 with outer diameter dl<br>
slightly less than the diameter d2 of the first chamber 3. The flange 10, together<br>
with the end portion 9, will act as a piston 11 in the last resin dispensing phase.<br>
As specifically shown in Figure 4, the first tubular body 2 will feature an upper<br><br>
portion 12 with an entry door 13 made in central position to allow transit of the second tubular body 4. The first body 2 will on the other hand be closed in opposite position by a rear wall 14 featuring a through hole 15 for dispensing the mixed resin towards suitable external implantation means E. During the mixing stage, the through hole 15 will be closed by a closing element 16, such as, for example, a cap that screws onto it, which will be removed when the compound is dispensed ready for use.<br>
Advantageously, the transfer means 6 for putting the collection chambers 3, 5 in fluid communication will comprise a series of through cavities 17 made on the lower wall 18 of the second body 4, visible in Figure 5.<br>
The liquid phase can be introduced into the second chamber 5 inside a suitable container F, such as for instance a breakable glass phial, through specific breaking means 19 positioned inside the second chamber 5. The means 19 will preferably comprise an upper cylindrical element 20 sliding inside the second chamber 5, and a pointed element 21 longitudinally opposite. The upper element 20 will be operated from outside so as to push the phial F against the pointed element 21 causing this to break and, therefore, the liquid phase to pour into the first chamber 3 passing through the through cavities 17. Downstream of the latter, a first filter element 22 will also be located to prevent the transit of fragments of glass produced by the breakage of phial F or, again, the transit of the solid phase in the opposite direction.<br>
Preferably, to favour the transit of the liquid phase inside the first chamber 3, the transfer means 6 can comprise pressure means 23 able to determine, inside the first chamber 3, a reduction in pressure and consequently a lower pressure compared to that existing inside the second chamber 5. This way, the liquid will be recalled inside the first chamber 3 by the vacuum generated inside this. In a first preferred but not exclusive form of embodiment of the invention, shown in figures 1 and 2, the pressure means 23 will comprise an elastically yielding membrane 24 which closes an open portion 25 of the side wall 26 of the second tubular body 4. By adjusting the pressure on membrane 24, the operator can change the volume inside the second collection chamber 5 and when this is released, the above vacuum will be produced.<br><br>
In a second form of embodiment, shown in fig. 6; the pressure means 23 can consist of the same piston 11 which, operated by the altemative sliding m axial direction of the second tubular body 4, will determine the vacuum inside the first collection chamber 3 and, consequently, the transit of the liquid inside this. In each configuration, a stop element 27 will also be fitted to restrict the movement of the piston 11. The element 27 will be substantially longitudinal, and will protrude inside the first chamber 3 and will be associated with the closing element 16. This way, any contact between piston 11 and the powder will be avoided during generation of the vacuum in the first chamber 3. In order to achieve a strong vacuum inside the first chamber 3, the transfer means 6 will comprise suitable-^fluid coimecting means 28 of the first collection chamber 3 to the external vacuum means E. The connecting means 28 will comprise a pipe 29 made inside the stop element 27 and having a longitudinal direction X, according to the development of element 27 itself. The pipe 29 will feature a fi:ee entrance 30 inside the Gist chamber 3 and an exit 31 inside the closing element 16 and downstream of which a second filter element 32 will be positioned. The latter can be a microbiological filter, for example of the active charcoal type, designed to preserve the sterility of the compound housed in the first collection chamber 3, particularly during the vacuum creation phase. After the transit of the liquid phase inside the first chamber 3, the mixing will occur of the two phases present at the same time inside the first chamber 3, manually operating the agitator means 8, particularly shown in Fig. 3. Advantageously, the means 8 will comprise a mobile agitator element 33 inside the first chamber 3 and at least partially hollow. Preferably, the element 33 will be configured like a flat grid with development substantially transversal witii respect to the longitudinal dimension of the cartridge 1, its being possible fiuthermore to make it of the same material as cartridge 1 or of a similar material.<br>
The movement of the agitator element 33 will be suitably simplified by coupling this with suitable means of movement 34 that can be operated from outside by an operator. The means 34 will comprise a gripping element 35 outside the collection<br><br>
chamber of phases 3, 5 configured like a round crown coaxial to the second tubular body 4, rigidly coupled to the agitator element 33 by means of specific linking means 36. The latter will be substantially a pair of rods 37 arranged symmetrically to the development axis X.<br>
The rods 37 will have a first end 38 connected to the gripping element 35 and a second end 38' connected to the agitator element 33, Furthermore, the rods 37 will be conducted through respective guide openings 39 made in a ring nut 40 that can be fitted at the upper portion 12 of the first tubular body 2, so as to slide sealed. The guide openings 39 will be configured as slots to permit partial rotation of the agitator means 8 around the longitudinal direction X, so as to ensure more efficient mixing of the phases. After mixing, the resin will be ready to be dispensed towards the external implantation means. For this purpose, the closing element 16 will be removed from the hole 15 on the rear wall 14, the implantation means E will be connected and the resin will be dispensed by means of adequate pressure applied by means of piston 11. operated by means of the thrust applied by the operator on the second tubular body 4. From the above description, it is evident that the cartridge according to the invention achieves the intended purposes, and particularly to allow the phase mixing so as to obtain a two-phase compound with homogenuous chemical, physical and mechanical characteristics and in conditions of absolute sterility. Furthermore, thanks to the special configuration of the mixing means, it is possible to achieve a cartridge being safe and easy to use for any operator. The cartridge according to the invention is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which falling within the scope of the inventive concept as contained in the enclosed claims. All the details can be replaced with others that are technically equivalent and the materials used may be any according to requirements without because of this moving outside the protection scope of the invention.<br>
The cartridge has also been described with special reference to the attached figures, the reference numbers used in the description and claims are used to upgrade the intelligence of the invention and do not represent any limitation to the claimed protection scope.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
