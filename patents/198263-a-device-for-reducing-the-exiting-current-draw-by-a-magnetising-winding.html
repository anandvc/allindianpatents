				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for reducing the exciting current drawn by a magnetising winding.<br>
The problem of reducing the exciting current drawn by a winding for establishing flux in a magnetic core has been  receiving considerable attention over the  years.<br>
Reduced excitation current leads to better performance of inductive ratio devices. Conventionally, quality materials of high permeability and low loss have been employed for this purpose. "Two-stage principle" has also been employed along with buffer amplifiers for increasing the input impedance, especially of inductive voltage dividers (IVDs).<br>
The  device, according to this invention, for  reducing<br>
the exciting current drawn by a magnetising winding of the single core or two-core type comprises a compensating winding, one end of the primary of said winding being connected to an output terminal of an <a.c source an i-to converter to the input terminal of which other end primary is connected reference said being tied></a.c><br>
the other output terminal of the said source; a second converter of the v-to-i type, to the input terminal of which the L output terminal of the first converter is connected, the output terminal of the second converter being connected to one end of the compensating winding, the reference (ground) of the second converter and the other end of the compensating winding being tied to the said other output terminal of the said source; and a feed back compensation circuit provided for the winding of the single-core as well as the two—core type.<br>
This invention will now be described in further	detail<br>
by   reference  to  the  accompanying  drawings	which<br>
illustrate by way of example embodiments of the	device<br>
proposed herein,<br>
Fig.l  illustrating  the embodiment in  a  single-core configuration<br>
Fig.2   illustrating  the embodiment  in  a  two-core arrangement with feed back compensation<br>
and<br><br>
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) respectively illustrating  wave forms  of  induced  emf  and  exciting  current without compensation  and with compensation  (exciting  current magnified  50  times)  for  the single core  type bf configuration.<br>
In addition to the usual primary (Nl turns) and secondary (N 2 turns), the single core magnetic circuit now has a compensating winding of Nc turns.<br>
One end, PI of the primary, is connected to an a.c. source S while the other end P2 goes to the input terminal of an i-to-v converter exemplified by the opamp 0A1. The reference (ground) of 0A1 is tied to the free end of the source S. The output of 0A1 is connected to the input of opamp 0A2 which feeds the compensating winding.<br>
Assuming  the opamps  to  be  ideal,  the output  of<br>
0A1,  namely, I Riv which forms the input of 0A2  would<br>
e be zero. Since Riv is finite, I  would reduce to  zero.<br>
e In  other words, 0A2 would provide a  suitable  current<br>
through the compensating winding so as to make I<br>
e zero.<br><br>
The winding P1P2 is thus relieved of the task of having<br>
to carry     the exciting current.  In such  a  case  the<br>
applied voltage to the primary V  would be equal to the<br>
1 induced  emf e, .  Hence the secondary induced emf  will<br>
be  e   =  v   N2     resulting  in  a  perfect   voltage 2      1  N1<br>
transformation. In practice however, the gain of 0A2 should be finite to have a stable feedback system. It can  be shown that the exciting current drawn  by  the<br><br>
where Gvi is the transconductance of 0A2 which operates<br>
as a v-to-i converter.  The factor  Nc<br>
— Riv Bvi Nl<br>
is nothing but the loop gain of the feedback system  of<br>
Fig.l.   The device proposed herein takes the  form of Fig.2 for the two stage case.  The current drawn by the P1P2 winding which is normally low because of the two stage arrangement, gets further reduced by the addition of the i-to-v converter and associated feedback.<br><br>
f<br>
The device proposed herein can readily be used for constructing interposing voltage transformers of electronic energy meter circuits. High input impedance multi-decade inductive voltage dividers can be fabricated using the said device of the two stage arrangement. With the negative pin of the opamp 0A1 at virtual ground, the primary applied voltage across P1P2 could be quite large. The said device can therefore be used for constructing high accuracy high voltage reference PTs also.<br>
It may be noted here that the waveform of the secondary emf would be an exact reproduction of the source voltage. If the latter is sinusoidal, then it nicely turns out that the flux in the core gets forced to become sinusoidal in wave shape. Hence the feed back arrangement can also be employed in a.c. magnetic testing.<br>
To check the workability of the device proposed herein, tests were conducted on toroidal as well as E-I/E core specimens for the single core case of Fig.l and on a toroidal  snecimen for two*stage operation. Reduction<br><br>
by a -factor of nearly 100 was observed -for  the  single-core  prototype.  The two stage arrangement provided  a reduction of 25 without compensation and the  reduction<br>
factor with compensation  was 750.  An input  impedance<br>
7 of  10   ohms  was easily obtained  in  the  two-stage<br>
arrangement,  without  any precautions  like guarding,<br>
shielding etc.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention to exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other features of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
