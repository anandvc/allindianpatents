BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		Such cutting tools, generally in the form of end mills and shell mills are<br>
	used in metal working applications in the manufacture of dies and molds and other<br>
	structures having complex geometrical surfaces and extended shoulders. In these<br>
10	applications it is often required, to produce internal corners of small radius<br>
	sometimes smaller than 0.5 mm. Generally, complex geometrical surfaces are<br>
	produced in metal workpieces using ball nose end mills, or end mills with round<br>
	cutting inserts. There are no 	ball nose end mills having replaceable cutting inserts<br>
	that can produce internal corners having a radius as small as 0.5 mm, Also, there<br>
15	are no round cutting inserts having radii as small as 0.5mm.<br>
		When working a large surface of a workpiece, the most economical<br>
	approach is to use cutting tools having large radii cutting inserts in order to produce<br>
	the main, large seals features of the surface and then to use tools having small<br>
	radius cutting capability for producing small scale features and for reducing the<br><br><br>
WO 2004/048021								PCT/IL2003/000909<br>
-2-<br>
	radii of internal corners where needed.<br>
		Cutting inserts having small radius cutting capability are usually<br>
	rhomboidal in shape, having a cutting nose (or comer) with the required small<br>
	radius. An example of such a. cutting insert and associated cutting tool is disclosed<br>
5	in EP 1 157 768 Al. The cutting insert has a positive geometry and therefore only<br>
	two cutting corners.<br>
		It is an object of the present invention to provide a cutting insert having<br>
	four cutting comers capable of cutting small radii internal comers in a workpiece.<br>

	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
		Attention is first drawn to Figs. 1 to 4 showing an indexable cutting<br>
	insert 10 in accordance with the present invention. The editing insert 10 has two<br>
	identical generally rhornboidal opposing end surfaces 12 with a peripheral side<br>
10	surface 14 extending therebetween. Each end surface 12 is bounded by a<br>
	peripheral edge 16 at which the end surface 12 and the peripheral side surface 14 	merge. Each peripheral edge 16 comprises two continuous cutting edge sections 18 	separated by two non- cutting edge sections 20. Adjacent each cutting edge section<br>
	18 is a groove 22 which borders a generally flat end region 24 of the end surface<br>
15	12, Therefore the cutting insert 10 has two opposing fiat end regions 24. The two<br>
	opposing flat end regions 24 are parallel to each other and to a median plane M of<br>
	the cutting insert 10 which is located midway between the flat end regions 24.<br>
		The peripheral side surface 14 is perpendicular to the median plane M<br>
	and comprises eight component side surfaces, namely, four generally flat major<br>
20	side surfaces 26, two diametrically opposing radiused corner side surfaces 28 and<br>
	two diametrically opposing generally flat minor side surfaces 30. Each minor side<br>
	surface 30 is located between and merges with the two major side surfaces 26<br>
	Similarly, each corner side surface 28 is located between and merges with the two<br>
	major side surfaces 26.<br>
25		Each outting edge section 18 comprises a first cutting edge 32, a second<br>
	cutting edge 34 and a corner cutting edge 36 at which the first and second cutting<br>
	edges 32, 34 marge. Bach first cutting edge 32 extends away from the coprner<br>
	cutting edgs 36 with which it merges to an adjacent non-cutting edge section. 20<br>
	and towards the median plane M. The first cutting edge 32 is preferably straight<br><br><br>
WO 2004/048021								PCT/IL2003/000909<br>
-6-<br>
	and is inclined at a non-zero first angle 1 with respect to the median plane M.<br>
	Similarly, each second cutting edge 34 extends away from the corner cutting edge<br>
	36 with which it merges to an adjacent non-cutting edge section 20 and towards the<br>
	median plane M. The second cutting edge 34 is preferably straight and is inclined<br>
5	at a non-zero second angle 62 with respect to the median plane M The first and<br>
	second angles 01, 82 can be equal or non-equal to each other. The two first cutting<br>
	edges 32 associated with a given end surface 12 are parallel to each other, and the<br>
	two second cutting edges 54 associated with a given end surface 12 are parallel to<br>
	each other. The flat minor side surfaces 30 from a pair of diametrically opposed<br>
10	flat corners of the cutting insert 10,<br>
		Each end surface 12 comprises a rake surface 38 adjacent each cutting<br>
	edge section 18. The rake surface 38 extends from the cutting edge section 18<br>
	inwards towards the median plane M to a join 40 where it merges with a rise 42<br>
	that slopes from the join 40 away from the median plane M to the flat end region<br>
15	24 As can be seen in Figs. 2 and 5A to 5D, the rake surface 38 adjacent the first<br>
	cutting edge 32 has a variable length (measured perpendicular to the first cutting<br>
	edge 52.) along the cutting edge. It has a first length L1 (at cross-section VA-VA)<br>
	near to an adjacent non-cutting edge 20 and 3 second length 1-2 (at cross-section<br>
	VB-VB) near to an adjacent corner cutting edge 36, where the second length L2 is<br>
20	greater than the first length L1 and continuously varies between these two values<br>
	along the cutting edge. On the other hand, the rake surface 33 adjacent with the<br>
	second cutting edge 34 has a third length L3 which is approximately constant along<br>
	the length of the second cutting edge 34. For the sake of clarity it is pointed out<br>
	that the line shown as the join 40 in Figs, 1 and 2 is only illustrative. It will be<br>
25	apparent from Figs. 5A to 5D that the join 40 is actually a curved region of finite<br>
	width -forming part of the groove 22.<br>
		The cutting insert 10 has 1800 rotational symmetry about first, second<br>
	and third axes of rotational symmetry R1, R2, H3, The first axis R1 is<br>
	perpendicular to the flat end tegions 24, the second axis R2 passes through the<br><br><br>
WO 2004/048021								PCT/IL2003/000909<br>
-7-<br>
	minor side surfaces 30 and the third axis R3 passes through the corner side surfaces<br>
	28. The second and third axes R2, R3 lie in the median plane M and the first axis<br>
	Rl is perpendicular to the second and third axes R2, R3. The cutting insert 10 is<br>
	provided with a through bore 44 having as axis the first axis of rotational symmetry<br>
5	R1. The through bore 44 extends between the flat end regions 24 and defines an<br>
	axial direction of the cutting insert. It should he noted from the side views of the<br>
	cutting insert 10 in Figs, 3 and 4 that the cutting insert 10 is widest in the axial<br>
	direction of the cutting insert 10 at regions where the flat end regions 24 are<br>
	directly opposite each other. In other words, the flat end regions 24 form axially<br>
10	outermost protruding regions of the cutting insert 10. Typically, the radius R of the<br>
	corner cutting edges 36 is in the range 0.2 to 6.35 mm.<br>
		Attention, is now drawn to Fig. 6 showing a cutting tool 46 in<br>
	accordance with the present invention. The cutting tool 46 is an end mill capable<br>
	of cutting small radii internal corners in a workpiece 48 in accordance with the<br>
15	value of the radius R of the corner cutting edges 36. The cutting tool 46 is also<br>
	capable performing ramp down cutting operations by means of the second cutting<br>
	edge 34, The cutting tool 46 has an axis of rotation A and comprises a culler body<br>
	50 with the indexable cutting inserts 10 in accordance with the present invention<br>
	seated in insert pockets 52 of the cutter body 30. Each, cutting insert 10 has two<br>
20	effective operative cutting edges, one operative first cutting edge 32' and one<br>
	operative second cutting edge 34', and one operative corner cutting edge 36', The<br>
	insert pockets 52 are so designed that the operative first cutting edge 32' is<br>
	positioned with and axial rate angle  of typically close to 00 but generally no<br>
	larger that 50, Since the operative first cutting edge 32' makes a first angle 01 with<br>
25	respect to the median plane M of the cutting insert 10 an inherent back clearance a<br>
	typically close to  but generally no less than 1 -50 is obtained between the<br>
	cutting insert 10 and portions of the surface of the workpiece 48 adjacent the<br>
	operative second cuitting edge 34',<br>
		The operative first cutting edge 32' can be divided into a leading portion<br><br><br>
WO 2004/048021								PCT/IL2003/000909<br>
-8-<br>
	adjacent the operative cutting comer 36', a trailing portion distal the operative<br>
	catting corner 36' and an intermediate portion therebetween. In cutting operations<br>
	involving the production of internal small radius corners in a workpiece, such as in<br>
	the manufacture of dies and molds, it is mainly the operative cutting corner 36' that<br>
5	is involved in the cutting operation. It will be appreciated that even if the leading<br>
	portion of the operative first cutting edge 32' also participates in such cutting<br>
	operations, the groove 22 should extend adjacent the whole length of the operative<br>
	first cutting edge 32' from the leading portion to trailing portion, in order to provide<br>
	clearance between the end surface 12 adjacent the trailing portion of the operative<br>
10	first cutting edge 32' and the workpiece 48. It will also be appreciated that if<br>
	instead of the flat minor side surfaces 30 the cutting insert were to have comers<br>
	protruding beyond the flat minor side surfaces 30, then that part of the cutting insert<br>
	protruding beyond the flat minor side surfaces 30 associated with the operative first<br>
	cutting edge 32' would disadvantageously enter the cutting circle defined by the<br>
15	operative first cutting edge 32', This is especially important when working in the<br>
	region of extended shoulders and also in ramp up cutting operations.<br>
		Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of<br>
	particularity, it should be understood that various alterations and modifications can<br>
	be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as hereinafter<br>

The present invention provides a cutting insert an indexable cutting insert (10). For use is a cutting tool (46) for<br>
milling operations, The cutting insert (10) is generally rhomboidal in share having a peripheral side surface.(14) extending between<br>
and perpendicular to the two opposing end surfaces (12). A cutting edge section is associated with each end surface (12) end com<br>
prises first (12) and second (34) cutting edges merging a corner cutting edge (36). The two first cutting edges (32,34) associated <br>
with each end surface form a non-zero first angle with respect in a median plane (m) of the cutting insert (10), The peripheral side<br>
surface (12) comprises four generally that major side surfaces (26) two diamertically opposing rediused corner side surface (28)<br>
and two diamertically opposing generally flat minor side surfaces (30). Each end surface is provided with a flat end region (24 ). The<br>
flat end regions are parallel and from axially outermost protruding regions of the cutting insert (10).<br></td>
