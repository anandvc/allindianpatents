				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (a) Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a damper clutch control system- for an automatic transmission, and more particularly, to a method which duty control is performed in releasing the damper clutch when a down-shift is executed during an accelerator pedal being depressed in a sports mode and thereby reducing a gear-shift shock. (b) Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally, an automatic transmission automatically shifts gears according to a driving state. However, a driver can directly input a gear-shift signal into the automatic transmission if necessary.<br>
The gear-shift signal inputted by a driver is divided into an 'up-shift' signal by which the gear shifts upward and a 'down-shift' signal by which the gear shifts downward.<br>
The gear-shift signal is inputted by moving a shift lever from a general shift mode column comprising P-R-N-D to a sports mode column. The sports mode is provided with means for generating '+' or '-' signals for shifting gears. Therefore, the gear-shift signal can be generated by a manipulation of the shift lever, and the generated gear-shift signal is inputted into a transmission control means.<br>
In the automatic transmission, engine torque is transmitted to the<br><br>
transmission via a torque converter. The torque converter transmits engine torque through a flow of working fluid, and therefore slip occurs, but a damper clutch is provided inside the torque converter to reduce this slip. In some driving states, the engine and the transmission are directly coupled by an operation of the damper clutch, and thereby fuel mileage and a power transmission ratio are improved.<br>
When the transmission control means receives a down-shift signal from a driver in the sports mode, the transmission control means immediately releases the damper clutch.<br>
However, if the down-shift signal is inputted in a state when an accelerator pedal is depressed , the transmission control means determines a down-shift and immediately releases the damper clutch. Therefore, a difference between the engine speed at the point when the shift is completed and the engine speed at the point the shift is started is substantial, and thus gear-shift shock occurs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a damper clutch control system to solve the above problem, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a damper clutch control system, in which duty control is performed in releasing the damper clutch when a down-shift is executed during an accelerator pedal being depressed in a sports mode and thereby reducing a gear-shift shock.<br>
To achieve the object above, a damper clutch release control system comprises:<br><br>
a throttle position sensor for detecting an opening angle of a throttle valve;<br>
a sports mode detecting means for detecting whether a shift lever is in a sports mode column;<br>
a gear-shift signal detecting means for detecting a gear-shift signal generated by manipulation of the shift lever;<br>
a damper clutch controlling the power transmission between the engine and the transmission, the damper clutch being installed inside a torque converter transmitting the rotating power of the engine to the transmission; and<br>
a transmission control means for controlling an operation of the damper clutch through having inputted data from the throttle position sensor, sports mode detecting means and gear-shift signal detecting means.<br>
wherein the transmission control means performs the steps of:<br>
(a)	determining whether the down-shift signal is inputted in a state when<br>
a gear shift mode is a sports mode and a throttle valve opening angle is within a<br>
predetermined range; and<br>
(b)	performing duty control until the transmission control means outputs<br>
a down-shift start signal to the transmission if it determined that the down-shift<br>
signal is inputted.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a damper clutch control system<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing a damper clutch release control<br>
performed by the damper clutch control system according to the preferred<br><br>
First, the transmission control means 150 determines whether conditions for the damper clutch release control are satisfied (S210), the conditions being that an opening angle of the throttle valve is within a predetermined range, the shift mode is a sports mode, and the down-shift signal is inputted.<br>
The predetermined range of the throttle valve can be differently determined according to driving states, and by way of example, it can be set as a range in which the IPS output value is 0.859V through 1.992V.<br>
If the shift lever is in the sports mode column, the shift mode is determined to be the sports mode. Also, if the driver inputs the down-shift signal by manipulation of the shift lever, it is determined that the down-shift signal is inputted.<br>
If the conditions for the release control are not satisfied, the damper clutch release control comes to an end.<br>
If the conditions for the release control are satisfied, the damper clutch duty ratio is immediately reduced to the predetermined ratio when it has been determined that the down-shift signal is inputted (S220).<br>
If the duty ratio is reduced, the engine speed can increase. The predetermined ratio can be set as an arbitrary ratio based on the needed engine speed, and by way of example, it can be set as 47.5%.<br>
After the transmission control means 150 reduces the duty ratio to the predetermined ratio, the transmission control means 150 decreases the duty ratio at a predetermined rate (S230). The predetermined rate can be set as an arbitrary rate of decrease, and by way of example, it can be set as<br><br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a system of a method for controlling a damper clutch according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a damper clutch release control system according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a throttle position sensor 110 for detecting opening angle of a throttle valve, a sports mode detecting means 120 for detecting whether a shift lever is in a sports mode column, a gear-shift signal detecting means 130 for detecting a gear-shift signal generated by manipulation of the shift lever, a damper clutch 140 controlling power transmission between an engine and a transmission, the damper clutch being installed inside a torque converter transmitting engine torque to the transmission, and a transmission control means 150 for controlling operation of the damper clutch 140 by having data inputted from the throttle position sensor 110, the sports mode detecting means 120 and the gear-shift signal detecting means 130.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart showing a damper clutch release control performed by the damper clutch control system according to the preferred embodiment according to the present invention.<br><br>
0.061 %/msec.<br>
The transmission control means 150 calculates a difference between engine speed (Ne) and turbine speed (Nt) and then determines whether the difference is greater than or equal to a predetermined value (AN) (S240). Here, if the difference is smaller than the predetermined value (AN; for example, 100RPM), the transmission control means 150 continues performing the duty control (S230). If the difference is greater than or equal to the predetermined value (AN), the transmission control means 150 makes the duty ratio of the damper clutch zero and outputs a gear-shift start signal to the transmission (S250).<br>
After the gear-shift start signal is outputted, the damper clutch release control method according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention comes to an end.<br>
FIG. 3 is a graph showing a result of damper clutch release control according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3c, before determining the gear-shift signal in the sports mode during the power-on state, the damper clutch operates, and therefore the engine speed (Ne) and the turbine speed (Nt) are the same value.<br>
At this time, if a driver shifts the shift lever down, as shown in FIG. 3b, the transmission control means 150 immediately reduces the duty ratio of the damper clutch to the predetermined ratio with the determination of the gear-shift signal and then decreases the duty ratio at the predetermined rate.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIG. 3c, the engine speed (Ne) becomes greater than the turbine speed (Nt). If the difference between the engine speed<br><br>
and the turbine speed is greater than or equal to the predetermined value (AN), the transmission control means 150 outputs the gear-shift signal and simultaneously makes the duty ratio of the damper clutch zero, and thereby the damper clutch 140 is completely released.<br>
Thus, gear-shifting is accomplished. Also, the turbine speed (Nt) increases to be equal to the engine speed (Ne), and thereby the shock of the gear-shift decreases.<br>
While the present invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and substitutions can be made thereto without departing from the sprit and scope of the present invention as set in forth in the appended claims.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the down-shift is performed during the accelerator pedal being depressed in the sports mode , the duty control for the damper clutch is performed and thereby the shock of gear-shifting decreases.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br><br>
1.	A damper clutch release control method for an automatic transmission<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	determining whether a down-shift signal is inputted in a state when a<br>
gear shift mode is a sports mode and throttle valve opening angle is<br>
within a predetermined range at step S210; and<br>
(b)	performing duly control until a transmission control means outputs a<br>
down-shift start signal to a transmission if it is determined that the<br>
down-shift signal is inputted at steps form S220 to S250.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step (b) comprises:<br>
(c)	immediately  reducing  a  duly  ratio  of the  damper clutch to a<br>
predetermined value when it is determined that the down-shift signal is<br>
inputted.<br>
(d)	decreasing the duty ratio of the clutch at a pre-determined rate; and<br>
(e)	simultaneously making the duty zero and outputting the down-shift<br>
start signal to the transmission.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the step (e).down-shift start<br>
signal is outputted if a difference between an engine speed and a turbine<br>
speed is greater than or equal to a predetermined value.<br></td>
