				<td>METHODS FOR PURIFYING TRANS-(-)-Δ9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL AND TRANS-(+)-Δ9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL<br>
1.   Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for purifying<br>
trans-(-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol or trans-(+)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; compositions comprising purified forms of trans-(-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol or trans-(+)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; and methods for treating or preventing a condition such as pain, emesis, loss of appetite or weight loss comprising administering purified form of trans-(-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol to a patient in need thereof.<br>
2.   Background of the Invention<br>
(-)-6a,10a-Trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ("(-)-Δ9-THC") is mainly responsible for the antiemetic effects associated with cannabis (S.E. Sallen et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 302:135 (1980); A.E. Chang et al, Cancer 47:1746 (1981); and D.S. Poster et al, J. Am. Med. Asso. 245:2047 (1981)). Both trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+&gt;Δ9-THC, the<br>
trans-(-)- and (+)-enantiomers, respectively, of (±)-V9-THC, are reported to be useful for treating pain, with trans-(-)-Δ9-THC reported to be more potent than trans-(+&gt;Δ9-THC (see, e.g., G. Jones et al., Biochem. Pharmacol 23:439 (1974); S.H. Roth, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 56:968 (1978); B.R. Martin et al, Life Sciences 29:565 (1981); M. Reichman et al, Mol. Pharmacol 34:823 (1988); and M. Reichman et al, Mol. Pharmacol 40:547 (1991)). trans-(-)-A9-THC is reported to be useful an antiemetic to relieve nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and to stimulate weight gain in patients suffering from symptomatic HIV infection (see U.S. Patent No. 6,703,418 B2 to Plasse). An encapsulated formulation of synthetic trans-(-)-Δ9-THC ("dronabinol") in sesame oil is currently sold as Marinol® by Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in 2.5, 5, and 10 mg dosage strengths.<br>
Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can be extracted from hashish (see, Y. Gaoni et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:217 (1971); and U.S. Patent No. 6,365,416 Bl to Elsohly eta/.). The concentration of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC in hashish, however, ranges from only about 1-5% depending on the source, and, even after extraction, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC must be separated from other impurities such as cannabinoid isomers.<br>
R.F. Turk et aL, J. Pharm. Pharmac. 23:190-195 (1971) describes a method for isolating trans-(-)-Δ9-THC from marihuana, but the product contained an undetermined amount of carboxylic precursors of THC.<br>
The following paragraphs relate to known methods that purport making trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or (±)-A9-THC:<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,560,528 to Petrizilka describes the reaction of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-l-ol with olivetol in the presence of p-toluenesurfonic acid monohydrate ("PTSA-HaO") or trifluoroacetic acid in refluxing benzene to provide (-)-Δ8-THC, which can be converted to trans-(-)-Δ9-THC by addition of HC1 followed by dehydrochlorination (see Y. Mechoulam et aL, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:4553 (1967); and R. Mechoulam et aL, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972)).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 to Razdan et aL describes the reaction of a mixture of czV/rans-(+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-l-ol with olivetol hi an inert organic solvent in the presence of an excess of a non-alkaline dehydrating agent and an acid catalyst to form trans-(-)-A9-THC; this patent also describes the reaction of (-)-cannabidiol ("(-)-CBD") or (-)-abnormal-CBD ("(-)-abn-CBD") with a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride diethylether ("BF3'Et2O") in an inert solvent under anhydrous conditions to form trans-(-)-Δ9-THC.<br>
R. K. Razdan et aL, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 96:5860 (1974) describes the reaction of a mixture of ciV,fram-(+)-pnientha-2,8-dien-l-ol with olivetol in the presence of 1% BF3-Et20, methylene chloride and anhydrous magnesium sulfate to form trans-(-)-Δ9-THC.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,381,399 to Olsen et al. describes a method for separating trans-(-)-Δ9-THC from a crude synthetic mixture, the method comprising esterifying the crude mixture, isolating the resultant trans-(-)-Δ9-THC ester, hydrolyzing the ester, and distilling trans-(-)-Δ9-THC at reduced pressure.<br>
K.E. Fahrenholtz et al., J. Am. Chem, Soc. 89:5934-5941 (1967) describes the hydrolysis of (±)-l-m-nitrobenzenesulfoanate-6a,10a-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabrnol with NaOH in aqueous methanol to provide (±)-A9-THC, which was subsequently crystallized from hexane.<br>
E.G. Taylor et al.,J. Am. Chem. Soc. 88:367 (1966) describes the reaction of citral with olivetol in acidified ethanol to form (±)-A9-THC in about 35% yield.<br>
S. L. Levin et al, J. Chromatogr. A 654:53-64 (1993) describe a method for resolving trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC from a composition comprising equimolar amounts of the trans-(-)- and (+)-enantiomer.<br>
Despite these described methods, there remains a need for improved methods for making trans-(-)-Δ9-THC in pure or substantially pure form.<br>

4.2. Methods for Purifying trans-(-)-Δ9-THC<br><br>
compositions comprising at least about 98% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or<br>
As noted above, the present invention relates methods for making sc trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method comprising allowing a composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC composition, wherein the<br>
 (±)-A9-THC is obtained from crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC. Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that cannabinoid impurities typically present in Δ9-THC compositions are substantially, if not completely, removed when trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC are allowed to form crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC. Subsequent resolution of (±)-Δ9-THC obtained from crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC with an eluting solvent on a chiral stationary phase provides a composition comprising at least about 98% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for preparing a composition comprising trans-(-)~Δ9-THC, comprising:<br>
allowing a composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition, wherein the (±)-Δ9-THC is obtained from crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for preparing a composition comprising trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, comprising:<br>
allowing a composition comprising (±)-A9-THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(+)-Δ9-THC composition, wherein the (±)-Δ9-THC is obtained from crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC.<br>
Crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC useful in the present invention can be obtained by any known or later-developed method. For example, a non-limiting method for obtaining crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC includes crystallization from a first composition comprising<br>
trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC as described below in Section 4.3.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for preparing a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition, comprising:<br>
allowing a composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(-)-A9-THC<br>
composition comprising at least about 98% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on<br>
the total amount of<br>
trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC;<br>
wherein the (±)-A9-THC was obtained by allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a first composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-A9-THC and a liquid phase.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for preparing a trans-(+)-A9-THC composition, comprising:<br>
allowing a composition comprising (±)-A -THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(+)-Δ9-THC composition comprising at least about 98% by weight of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and trans-(-)-A9-THC;<br>
wherein the (±)-A9-THC was obtained by allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a first composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC and a liquid phase.<br>
Compositions comprising rrans-(-)-A9-THC and trans-(+)-A9-THC useful for obtaining crystalline (±)-A9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 4.3.<br>
4.3. The Crystallizing Step<br>
As noted above, crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC can, in one embodiment, be obtained by allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and a non-polar organic solvent (the "Crystallizing Step") to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC and a liquid phase. Compositions comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and a non-<br><br>
polar organic solvent useful for the Crystallizing Step can be obtained by any known or later-developed method.<br>
For example, crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC can be obtained by contacting a suitable amount of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC with a non-polar organic solvent. The order and rate of addition of the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and the non-polar organic solvent is not critical and can be carried out sequentially or substantially simultaneously. As an example, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, optionally in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent, and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, optionally in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent, can be added to a non-polar organic solvent. Likewise, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent and trans-(-)-Δ9-THC in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent can be admixed.<br>
Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can be obtained from natural products or by synthetic methods. In one embodiment, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is obtained from a natural product such as, e.g., hashish or marijuana (see Y. Gaoni et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:217 (1971); and U.S. Patent No. 6,365,416 Bl to Elsohly et al).<br>
Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can also be obtained by known synthetic methods including, but not limited to, reaction ofcis/trans mixture of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-l-ol with olivetol in the presence of an acid catalyst such a para-toluenesulfonic acid and a dehydrating agent (see U.S. Patent No. 3,560,528 to Petrizilka and U.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 to Razdan et al.); reaction of (-)-CBD with a Lewis acid such as BF3-Et2O in an inert solvent under anhydrous conditions (see U.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 to Razdan et al.; and International publication no. WO 03/070506); or reaction of (-)-Δ8-THC with HC1 followed by dehydrochlorination (see Y. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:4553 (1967); and R. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972)). Alternatively, trans-(-)-A9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 5.<br>
Trans-(+)-A -THC, which is not known to occur in nature, can be made by known synthetic methods including, but not limited to, reaction of<br>
 (+)-A8-THC with HC1 followed by dehydrochlorination (see R. Mechoulam et at., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972). Alternatively, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 5. In one embodiment, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step is "recycled" from a previous resolution of (±)-Δ9-THC on a chiral stationary phase as described in Section 4.4<br>
In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step can be obtained as a mixture of enantiomers by a direct synthetic method. When a synthetic method is used, the ratio of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and<br>
trans-(+)-A9-THC can vary depending on the optical purity of the reagents and the synthetic process. In one embodiment, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC are obtained in about equimolar amounts by a synthetic route using racemic reagents. Non-limiting methods for preparing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC by a direct synthetic route include reaction of citral and olivetol in the presence of a Lewis acid (see R. Mechoulam et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972)) or hydrolysis of (±)-l-/w-nitrobenzenesulfoanate-6a,10a-trans-A9-THC withNaOH in aqueous methanol (K.E. Fahrenholtz et al.,J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:5934-5941 (1967)). Alternatively, (±)-A9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 5.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step can be obtained from derivatives of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and<br>
trans-(+)-A9-THC. For example, an admixture of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC can be reacted with a phenol protecting group such as m-nitrobenzenesulfonate and crystallized to provide 2-m-nitrobenzenesulfonate-(±)-Δ9-THC (see U.S. Patent No. 3,507,885 to Fahrenholtz; and K.E. Fahrenholtz et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:5934-5491 (1967))). The2-;w-nitrobenzenesulfonate-(±)-A9-THC can then be deprotected, and the resultant composition comprising trans-(-)-A9-THC and trans-<br>
 (+)-A9-THC can be crystallized from a composition comprising the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC.<br>
The ratio of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step can vary. In one embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from about 0.75 to about 1.25 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from about 0.9 to about 1.1 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from about 0.95 to about 1.05 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. And in another embodiment, the<br>

In another embodiment, the non-polar organic solvent used in the Crystallizing Step is n-heptane.<br>

Typically, the non-polar organic solvent is present in an amount sufficient to provide a mixture having a Δ9-THC concentration from about 1% to about 95%, preferably from about 20% to about 75%, more preferably from<br>
about 40% to about 60% by weight based on the total amount of A9-THC and the non-polar organic solvent.<br>

trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and a non-polar organic solvent is prepared at a first temperature, e.g., 20°C or higher. Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that forming the composition at a temperature of 20°C or higher increases the solubility of the<br>
trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC in the non-polar organic solvent. The temperature of the admixture can then be decreased to a second temperature, e.g., 0°C or lower. Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that holding the admixture at a temperature of 0°C or lower decreases the solubility of (±)-A9-THC and promotes crystallization. Optionally, the temperature of the admixture can be further decreased to third temperature, e.g., -20 to -15°C. As noted above, such a decrease in temperature is believed to enhance the (±)-Δ9 -THC crystallization process.<br>
In one embodiment, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC are dissolved in a non-polar organic solvent; the resultant solution is cooled to about<br>
0°C; the resultant mixture is further cooled to about -15°C; and the resultant crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC is separated from the liquid phase.<br>

When administered to a patient, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC compositions containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total<br>
amount of cannabinoids comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, containing at least about 99.0% by weight of<br>
trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids, is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical carriers can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like,In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, and/or pH buffering agents. When administered to a patient, the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are preferably sterile.<br>
The present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use.<br>
In one embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids further comprises sesame oil. In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC compositions containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-A9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids further comprises sesame oil, and the resultant admixture is encapsulated (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,703,418 B2).<br>
In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids is formed as a tablet.<br>
The trans-(-)-Δ9-THC compositions containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total weight of cannabinoids can be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with another biologically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical compositions. Methods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The preferred mode of administration is oral, but other modes of administration can be left to the discretion of the practitioner.<br>
When used for oral delivery, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions can contain one or more optional agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero-order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard carriers such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such carriers are preferably of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
When used for intravenous delivery, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC<br>
composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids is formulated in accordance with routine procedures for intravenous administration to human beings. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer, optionally with a solublizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration may optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the pharmaceutical compositions are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline, optionally with a solublizing agent. Where the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.<br>
The amount of the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids that is effective in the treatment or prevention of a Condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can<br>
optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage amounts. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the Condition and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal's circumstances. When<br>
trans-(-)-Δ9-THC compositions containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids are administered orally, the effective dosage amount is from about 0.005 mg/kg of body weight to about 0.4 mg/kg of body weight about every 4 hours, although it is typically about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight or less. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount is from about 0.005 mg/kg of body weight to about 0.4 mg/kg of body weight; in another embodiment, the effective dosage amount is from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight; and in another embodiment, the effective dosage amount is from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 0.075 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
The oral dosage forms typically comprise an amount of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg; in another embodiment, from about 2.5 mg to about 10 mg; in another embodiment, about 2.5 mg; in another embodiment, about 5 mg; and in another embodiment, about 10 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 hours until the Condition is abated, hi another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 hours until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 hours until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 hours until the Condition is abated. And in another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4 hours until the Condition is abated.<br>
In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection. Intraventricular injection may be<br>
facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.<br>
Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides.<br>
In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al, mLiposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer,<br>

In yet another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition containing at least about 99.0% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids can be delivered in a controlled-release system. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol.
