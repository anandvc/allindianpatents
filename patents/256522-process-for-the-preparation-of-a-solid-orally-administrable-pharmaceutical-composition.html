				<td>Process for the preparation of a solid, orally administrable pharmaceutical composition<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a solid, orally administrable pharmaceutical composition, comprising 5-chloro-Ar-({(55)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxo-4-morpholinyl)-phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}-methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide in hydrophilized form, and its use for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases.<br>
5-Chloro-Ar-({(55)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxo-4-morpholinyl)-phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}-methyl)-2-thio-phenecarboxamide (I) is a low molecular weight, orally administrable inhibitor of blood clotting factor Xa, which can be employed for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of various thromboembolic diseases (for this see WO-A 01/47919, whose disclosure is hereby included by way of reference). If, below, the discussion is of the active compound (I), all modifications of 5-chloro-AL({(55)-2-oxo-3 -[4-(3 -oxo-4-morpholinyl)-phenyl]-1,3 -oxazolidin-5 -yl} -methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide (I), and the respective hydrates are additionally included.<br>
The active compound \I) has a relatively poor water solubility (about 7 mg/1). As a result of this, difficulties with the oral bioavailability and an increased biological variability of the absorption rate can result.<br>
To increase the oral bioavailability, various concepts have been described in the past:<br>
., Thus, solutions of active compounds are frequently used which can be filled, for example, into soft gelatine capsules. On account of the poor solubility of the active compound (I) in the solvents used for this purpose, this option is not applicable, however, in the present case, since, in the necessary dose strength, capsule sizes would result which are no longer swallowable.<br>
An alternative process is the amorphization of the active compound. Here, the solution method proves problematical, since the active compound (I) is also poorly soluble in pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as ethanol or acetone. Amorphization of the active compound by means of the fusion method is also disadvantageous because of the high melting point of the active compound (about 230°C), since an undesirably high proportion of breakdown components is formed during the preparation.<br>
Furthermore, a process for the hydrophilization of hydrophobic active compounds as exemplified by hexobarbital and phenytoin has been described (Lerk, Lagas, Fell, Nauta, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Vol. 67, No. 7, July 1978, 935 - 939: "Effect of Hydrophilization of Hydrophobic Drugs on Release Rate from Capsules"; Lerk, Lagas, Lie-A-Huen, Broersma, Zuurman, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Vol. 68, No. 5, May 1979, 634-638: "In Vitro and In Vivo Availability of Hydrophilized Phenytoin from Capsules"). The active compound particles<br><br>
are blended here in a mixer with a methyl- or hydroxyethylcellulose solution with extensive avoidance of an agglomeration step and then dried. The active compound thus obtained is subsequently filled into hard gelatine capsules without further treatment.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a special treatment of the surface of the active compound (I) in the course of the moist granulation brings about improved absorption behaviour. The use of the active compound (I) in hydrophilized form in the preparation of solid, orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions leads to a significant increase in the bioavailability of the formulation thus obtained.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a solid, orally administrable pharmaceutical composition comprising 5-chloro-7^-({(55)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxo-4-morpholinyl)-phenyl]-l,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}-methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide in hydrophilized form, in which<br>
(a)	first granules comprising the active compound (I) in hydrophilized form are prepared by<br>
moist granulation	-	'<br>
(b)	and the granules are then converted into the pharmaceutical composition, if appropriate<br>
with addition of pharmaceutically suitable additives.<br>
The moist granulation in process step (a) can be carried out in a mixer (= mixer granulation) or in a fluidized bed (= fluidized bed granulation); fluidized bed granulation is preferred.<br>
In the moist granulation, the active compound (I) can either be introduced into the pre-mixture (original mixture) as a solid or it is suspended in the granulating liquid. Preferably, the active compound (I) suspended in the granulating liquid is introduced into the moist granulation (suspension process).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the active compound (I) is employed in crystalline form.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the crystalline active compound (I) is employed in micronized form. The active compound (I) in this case preferably has an average particle size X50 of less than 10 urn, in particular between 1 and 8 urn, and X90 (90% proportion) of less than 20 um, in particular of less than 15 um.<br>
The granulating liquid used according to the invention contains a solvent, a hydrophilic binding agent and, if appropriate, a wetting agent. The hydrophilic binding agent is in this case dispersed in<br>
the granulating liquid or preferably dissolved therein.<br><br>
The solvents used for the granulating liquid can be organic solvents, such as, for example, ethanol or acetone, or water or mixtures thereof. Preferably, water is used as a solvent.<br>

5.   Comparison of tablets with/without hydrophilized active compound (I)<br>
5.1	Tablet composition, preparation<br>
In order to investigate the tablet properties and the improved bioavailability of formulations containing hydrophilized active compound (I), uncoated tablets having a 10 mg active compound content (I) of the following composition are prepared (in mg/tablet):<br>
Active compound (I), micronized	10.0 mg<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose	40.0 rng<br>
Lactose monohydrate	27.9 mg<br>
Croscarmellose (Ac-Di-Sol®, FMC)	3.0mg<br>
.. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, 5 cp	3.0mg<br>
Sodium lauryl sulphate	0.5 mg<br>
Magnesium stearate	0.6 me<br>
85.0 mg<br>
Tablet A:         prepared by direct tabletting without granulation<br>
Tablet B:	prepared by the fluidized bed granulation/suspension process described in 1.2<br>
The mixture for tablet A and the granules for tablet B are in each case pressed to give tablets having a diameter of 6 mm and a fracture strength of about 70 - 80 N.<br>
5.2	Tablet properties<br>
5.2.1    Disintegration time in water (USP disintegration tester, Erweka):<br>
Tablet A:	about 1.5 minutes<br>
Tablet B:	about 6.5 minutes<br><br>
5.2.2    In-vitro release<br>
The amounts of active compound released based on the declared total content of the tablets are shown in Table 1 below:<br>
Table 1: In-vitro release<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
(USP paddle, 900 ml of acetate buffer pH 4.5 + 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate, 75 rpm) 5.2.3    Bioavailability<br>
For the investigation of the bioavailability, three dogs were in each case administered three tablets of A or three tablets of B in cross-over fashion. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters after oral administration of 3 mg of active compound (I)/kg are listed in Table 2 below:<br>
Table 2: Pharmacokinetic parameters of active compound (I) (Table Remove)<br>
 Result: In spite of slower disintegration (see 5.2.1) and very similar in-vitro release (see 5.2.2) of tablet B in comparison to tablet A, tablet B has marked advantages in absorption and thus a bioavailability increased by about 35%. At the same time, a marked decrease in the variability is to be noted. The only difference between tablet A and tablet B is the hydrophilization of the active compound (I) in tablet B with the aid of the suspension process in the course of the moist granulation.<br><br><br>
