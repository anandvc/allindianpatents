Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[52]	FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a system for transmitting and receiving traffic information<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[53]	In a network shown in FIG. 1, a trafficinformation providing server 100 of a<br>
broadcasting service company reconfigures various kinds of traffic information<br>
collected via variouspaths including operator inputs, other servers via the network 101,<br>
and probe cars and other traffic information collected from other servers for example<br>
and then transmits the reconfigured traffic information. A traffic information receiving<br>
device loaded in a vehicle 200 or the like, e.g., a navigation device receives the traffic<br>
information and then displayed the received traffic information.<br>
[54]	The traffic information providing server 100 transmits various kinds of traffic information<br>
necessary for vehicle operations such as road CTT information (hereinafter<br>
named congestion and travel time (CTT) information), road block information, parking<br>
lot information, and the like by radio for example.<br>
[55]	FIG. 2 is a structural diagram of traffic information transmitted via a broadcast<br>
signal.<br>
[56]	Referring to FIG. 2, the CTT (congestion and travel time) information can be exemplarily<br>
carried by a messagestructure. Traffic information has a configuration of a<br>
sequence of message segments. One of the message segments in the sequence can<br>
correspond to a CTT (congestion and travel-time information) message that indicates<br>
CTT information.<br>
[57]	The CTT messageincludes a message management container 21, a CTT even<br>
container (application event container) 22, and a CTT location container 23.<br>
[58]	And, another traffic information different from the CTT message, e.g., information<br>
30 for occurrences of factors (accident, slippery road, etc.) working as hindrance on<br>
road operations can be delivered by the message structure exemplarily shown in FIG.<br>
2.<br>
[59]	The message management container 21 carries message management date and time<br>
information.<br>
[60]	The CTT event container 22 carrying the CTT information contains a current-<br>
congestion and travel time status, a prediction of congestion and travel time status, and<br>
the like of each link. In this case, the link can indicates a road section having no<br>
crossroad between diverging points or crossroads. The congestion and travel time<br>
status includes an average link speed, a travel time, a link delay, and the like.<br>
[61]	And, the CTT location container 23 carries information for a location of a link.<br>
[62]	FIG. 3 is a diagram of a syntax structure of the message management container 21.<br>
[63]	Referring to FIG. 3, a message management container contains a message identifier<br><br>
identifying CTT information, a version number, a CTT message length, and a message<br>
generation time. In this case, the message generation time carries information for<br>
generation time of a messagewith reference to a timing point of a message<br>
transmission.<br>
[64]	FIG. 4 is an exemplary diagram of a template of a CTT event container carrying<br>
CTT information and a CTT location container.<br>
[65]	Referring to FIG. 4, each of the CTT event container or the CTT location container<br>
can include a number of components and at least one or more CTT components 201.<br>
[66]	FIG. 5 is an exemplary diagram of a template of a CTT component included in the<br>
CTT event container shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[67]	Referring to FIG. 5, a CTT component includes an identifier for CTT information, a<br>
byte-unit component length and CTT information component data among traffic in-<br>
formation message components.<br>
[68]	Yet., FIG. 6 exemplarily shows a template of a CTT location container included in<br>
the CTT event container shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[69]	Referring to FIG. 6, a CTT location container contains an identifier for a location<br>
container, a byte-unit component length, and location container data.<br>
[70]	If an identifier of the CTT event container 22 is 80h, the CTT event container 22<br>
can include a status component indicating CTT information (current status in-<br>
formation) for an average link speed, a travel time, a link delay, and the like as current<br>
operation information.<br>
[71]	FIG. 7 is an exemplary structural diagram of a congestion and travel time<br>
component included in a CTT event container.<br>
[72]	Referring to FIG. 7, an identifier 80h ('h' indicates a hexadecimal number) 3a is<br>
assigned to a CTT component. The CTT component includes a field 3b representingan<br>
overall data length of an included status component by byte unit and m status<br>
components 3c.<br>
[73]	Information for the aforesaid average link speed, travel time and link delay is<br>
delivered to each of the status components in a format exemplarily shown in FIG. 8,<br>
Fig. 9, or FIG. 10.<br>
[74]	An identifier 00 can be assigned to the average link speed shown in FIG. 8. An<br>
identifier 04 can be assigned to the travel time shown in FIG. 9. And, an identifier 05<br>
can be assigned to the link delay shown in FIG. 10. In this case, the link delay indicates<br>
a time delayed according to a current traffic status for a time taken to pass through a<br>
corresponding link at a speed limit regulated for the corresponding link.<br>
[75]	FIG. 11 is an exemplarydiagram of first type time information which carries the<br>
travel time shown in FIG. 9 and the link delay shown in FIG. 10.<br>
[76]	Referring to FIG. 11, a first type for time information is represented as <time_span><br><br>
. The first type for the time information includes a selector for selecting a time span<br>
and is able to include at least one information among a year span, a month span, a day<br>
span, a time span, a minute span, and a second span.<br>
[77]	Syntax for the type shown in FIG. 11 is explained in detail as follows.<br>
[78]	First of all, an additional byte can follow each bit for which a value of a selector<br>
corresponding to 'bitswitch' in the first type. In case that at least one byte follows a<br>
selector, a sequence of the byte value becomes a byte according to a byte corresponding<br>
to a bit close to an LSB of the selector. For instance, a select '8 bits'can<br>
indicate year, month, date, time, minute, and second according to digit values of the<br>
respective bits.<br>
[79]	And, the byte following the selector becomes the respective bit digit values<br>
according to the LSB sequenceof the selector. If a value according to a <time_span><br>
type is '18h 02h 1Eh', the value corresponding to the selector is 18h (00011000), which<br>
represents that a bit value corresponding to a minute and hour is set. So, '02h'<br>
following the selector becomes a value corresponding to 00001000 closer to the LSB<br>
among a value of '1' of the selector, i.e., the hour. And, '1Eh(=30)' corresponding to<br>
'00010000' becomes the minute. Hence, '<time_span>=18h 02h 1Eh' means a duration<br>
of '2 hours and 30 minutes'. For another instance, '06h 01h 0Fh' indicates a duration of<br>
'1 month and 15 days'.<br>
[80]	If a travel time is '30 minutes' according to the example shown in FIG. 9, a status<br>
component for the travel time for the link carries '04h 02h 10h 1Eh'. In this case, the<br>
'04h' in the front is an ID that indicates that a status component is for the travel time.<br>
The '02h' is a value that indicates a length of additional data, i.e., data corresponding to<br><time_span>. And, the '10h 1Eh' is a value coded according to the <time_span> type<br>
exemplarily shown in FIG. 11 and indicates '30 minutes'.<br>
[81 ]	If a travel time is '45 minutes' according to the example shown in FIG. 10, a status<br>
component for the travel time for the link carries '05h 02h 10h 2Dh'. In this case, the<br>
latter '10h 2Dh' is the value according to the <time_span> type exemplarily shown in<br>
FIG. 13 and is interpreted by the aforesaid method to indicate '45 minutes'.<br>
[82]	In another embodimentof the present invention, each of the status components of<br>
the travel time and link delay can have the 1-byte time information <intunti> instead of<br>
the format of <time_span> shown in FIG. 11. And, different identifying values, e.g.,01<br>
and 02 can be assigned to the status components of the travel time and link delay<br>
having the 1-byte time information each to be discriminated from the status<br>
components shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10, respectively.<br>
[83]	Thus, the traffic information receiving apparatus recognizes that time span information<br>
coded according to which type is loaded on a status component and is then<br>
able to decode the corresponding information.<br><br>
[84]	If an identifier of the CTT event container 22 is 8 1h, the CTT event container 22 is<br>
able to carry information for prediction CTT status. In this case, the prediction CTT<br>
status means the prediction information for the CTT information. The prediction CTT<br>
status can include a prediction average link speed, a prediction travel time, and the<br>
like.<br>
[85]	FIG. 12 is an exemplary structural diagram of a component carrying predicted in-<br>
formationfor CTT information included in a CTT event container.<br>
[86]	Referring to FIG. 12, an identifier 81h (5a) is assigned to a CTT component<br>
carrying prediction information and includes a field 5b representing a lengthof overall<br>
data of the included status components and m status components 5c carrying prediction<br>
information each.<br>
[87]	And, the aforesaid prediction average link speed and the prediction travel time can<br>
be carried by the status component for the prediction information.<br>
[88]	FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 exemplarily show status components carrying a prediction<br>
average link speed and a prediction travel time, respectively.<br>
[89]	Referring to FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, an identifier 00 (FIG. 13) and an identifier 01<br>
(FIG. 4) can be assigned to a prediction average link speed and a prediction travel<br>
time, respectively. A status component carrying prediction information can be carried<br>
by a 4-byte field <intunlo> coded for a predicted future time in a format of the UTC<br>
(universal time coordinated) agreementworld time. In this case, the predicted time<br>
indicates a time for obtaining the prediction information, i.e., a specific date or hour<br>
instead of a current time.<br>
[90]	In order to obtain prediction information, a traffic information transmitting<br>
apparatus is capable of generating prediction information for an average link speed, a<br>
travel time, and the like according to current traffic information collected via various<br>
paths and a traffic information database. For instance, the prediction travel time can be<br>
found by a length of a link in the respective links established in its database using the<br>
predicted average speed. A method of generating the prediction information will be<br>
explained in detail with reference to FIG. 23 and FIG. 24 later.<br>
[91]	FIG. 15 and FIG. 16 show another formats of status components carrying a<br>
prediction average link speed and a prediction travel time, respectively.<br>
[92]	Referring to FIG. 15, a status component for a prediction average link speed among<br>
status components for prediction information can have an identifier 03 and is able to<br>
include a status component data length for the prediction average link speed, the<br>
prediction average link speed, and a predicted time of the speed.<br>
[93]	Referring to FIG. 16, a status component for a prediction travel time among status<br>
components for prediction information can have an identifier 04 and is able to include<br>
a status component data length for the prediction average link speed, the prediction<br><br>
travel time, and a predicted time of the prediction travel time.<br>
[94]	In this case, the predicted time is the provided time information for the prediction<br>
information and indicates a second type of the time information for the traffic information.<br>
The second type for the time information is represented as <specific_></specific_>
_iterative_time&gt; and indicates a predicted time necessary to transmit the prediction information.<br>
[95]	The status components, as shown in FIG. 15 and FIG. 16, of the prediction average<br>
link speed and the prediction travel time having the information 5d and the information<br>
5e for the predicted times configured according to <specific_> can<br>
have identifiersdifferent from those shown in FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, e.g., identifiers 03<br>
and 04, respectively.<br>
[96]	In the embodimentshown in FIG. 16, the status component for the prediction travel<br>
time can have information 5f coded according to the aforesaid <time_span> type for<br>
the prediction travel time.<br>
[97]	FIG. 17 is an exemplary diagram of second type time information.<br>
[98]	Referring to FIG. 17, second type time information includes a selector for selecting<br>
a random timing point and is able to include at least one of time information indicating<br>
a current time of year, month, date, hour, minute, and second and information<br>
indicating whether the time is periodic information according to a value of the selector.<br>
A second type syntax of the time information is explained with reference to FIG. 17 as<br>
follows.<br>
[99]	First of all, a value of the selector corresponding to 'bitswitch' precedes and an<br>
additional byte can follow the selector one by one for each bit having a value of '1' in<br>
the selector. A value of the following byte is carried in a sequence of bytes corresponding<br>
to a bit close to an LSB of the selector. The selector can represent year,<br>
month, date, hour, minute, second, and a time at a position where the selector (i.e., a<br>
time of an undesignated field) is 0 as equality to a present time component and units of<br>
iterative time. The meaning of each of the units is shown in FIG. 17.<br>
[100]	For instance, if a value according to a <specific_.> is '58h OEh<br>
1Fh', a value corresponding to a selector is 58h (= 0101 1000). And, '1' close to MSB<br>
indicates that a time component of an undesignated field is the same time component<br>
of a present time. A second '1' from the MSB indicates 'minute and a third '1' indicates<br>
'hour'.<br>
[101]	The 'OEh (=14)'following the selector is a value corresponding to '00001000' closer<br>
to LSB and indicates 'hour'. And, the '1Fh (=31)'is a value corresponding to 00010000<br>
and indicates 'minute'. And, the elements for the rest of the fields (year, month, date,<br>
and second) do not exist to indicate a time component corresponding to a present time.<br>
So, if a present date is October 12, 2006, the '<specific_>:=58h 0Eh<br><br>
1Fh' means 13:30, October 12, 2006. In this case, it is assumed that 'second' is equal to<br>
that of the present time since the 'second' may be insignificant. Since values greater<br>
than 1 are recorded in the fields of 'year', 'hour', 'minute', and 'second' of the <specific_></specific_>
&amp;_iterative_time&gt;, the 'OEh' indicates 13 hours and the '1Fh' indicates 30 minutes.<br>
[102]	For another instance, if <specific_> is '50h 1Fh', it indicates bits<br>
for the 'minute' and 'undesignated fields are equal to those of present date and hour'.<br>
The '1Fh' is a value for 'minute'. If present date and hour are 15:00, October 12, 2006,<br>
the time information indicates 15:30, October 12, 2006.<br>
[103]	The <specific_> type exemplarily shown in FIG. 17 is able to<br>
reduce an information quantity, which is needed to carry information for a random<br>
timing point, smaller than that of the examples shown in Fig. 13 and FIG. 14 using information<br>
for a present time. Of course, it is able to carry information for random date<br>
and hour using all information for a present time for all fields.<br>
[104]	For instance, if '15:30 00, October 12, 2006' is coded according to a <specific_></specific_>
_iterative_time&gt; type, it becomes '3Fh 07h 0Ah 0Ch 0Eh 1Fh 01h'. In this case, '3Fh' is<br>
a value for a selector and the respective following bytes indicate values for year,<br>
month, date, hour, minute, and second in a sequence of the respective bytes.<br>
[105]	Hence, if a travel time predicted for a link at 14:30 today is 30 minutes, a traffic information<br>
transmitting apparatus transmits a value of '04h 05h 10h 1Eh 58h 0Fh 1Fh'<br>
carried by a status component of a prediction travel time for the link. In this case, the<br>
foremost '04h' is an ID indicating that the status component carries a prediction travel<br>
time of the <specific_> type. The '05h' is a value indicating lengths of<br>
data 5e and 5f corresponding to additional data, i.e., <tirne_span> and <specific_></specific_>
_iterative__time&gt; types. The 'lOh lEh'is a value according to the <time_span> type exemplarily<br>
shown in FIG. 11 and is interpreted in the aforesaid manner to indicate '30<br>
minutes'. The '58h 0Fh 1Fh'is a value coded according to the <specific_></specific_>
_iterative_time&gt; type shown in FIG. 17 and is interpreted in the aforesaid manner to<br>
indicate a timing point of '14:30 October 12, 2006' if a current date is October 12,<br>
2006.<br>
[106]	In the same manner, if a predicted average speed for a random link is 40km/h with<br>
reference to 14:30 today, a value of '03h 04h 28h 58h 0Fh 1Fh' can be carried by a<br>
status component of a prediction average link speed for the link. In this case, the '28h'<br>
is a value indicating a speed 130km/h and the '58h OFh 1Fh' indicates that '14:30<br>
October 12, 2006' is a predicted timing point if a present date is October 12, 2006.<br>
[107]	In another embodiment of the present invention, in case that prediction operation information<br>
for a link is carried, it is able to deliver prediction informationfor a specific<br>
period instead of delivering a specific timing point.<br>
[108]	FIG. 18 and FIG. 19 are another exemplary diagrams of prediction information for<br><br>
CTT information, in which a status component of a prediction average link speed for a<br>
specific period and a status component of a prediction travel time are shown, respectively.<br>
A third type of time information is exemplarily shown to carry traffic information<br>
predicted for a specific period, which is represented as <period_of_time><br>
hereof. And, identifiers 05 and 06 can be assigned to the status components carrying<br>
predicted operation information of the average speed and travel time for the specific<br>
period in FIG. 18 and FIG. 19, respectively.<br>
[109]	FIG. 20 is an exemplary diagram of third type time information to carry traffic information<br>
predicted for the predicted specific period shown in FIG. 18 and FIG. 19.<br>
[110]	Referring to FIG. 20, time informationshown in FIG. 20 includes at least one of a<br>
period information field 7a for a start point and an end point of a specific period<br>
according to the <specific_> type, a selector corresponding to<br>
'bitswitch', a day selection field <day_selector> following a value of the selector, the 
specific_&amp;_iterative_time&gt; field shown in FIG. 17, and the <time_span> field of<br>
which syntax is exemplarily shown in FIG. 13.<br>
[111]	FIG. 21 exemplarily shows a syntax of the day selection field.<br>
[112]	Referring to FIG. 21, a 1-byte value coded according to the type exemplarily shown<br>
in FIG. 21 can be written in the <day_selector> field. Lower 7 bits of the written byte<br>
designate days of the week, respectively. And, MSB indicates a presence or non-<br>
presence of the repetition of the corresponding day. For instance, if <day_selector> =<br>
01h, the MSB indicates that a day of an event occurrence is Sunday. If <day_selector><br>
= 84h, the MSB indicates that an event repeatedly occurs on each Tuesday.<br>
[113]	And, temporary information repeated everyday in a specific period designated by<br>
the period information field 7a can be carried by the <specific_> field<br>
selectively following according the selector within the <period_of_time> type shown<br>
in FIG. 20.<br>
[114]	The selectively following <time_span> field 7c carries a time interval from the<br>
timing point designated by the <specific_> field. Of course, if a<br>
timing point within a specific period is carried only, the <time_span> field may not be<br>
included.<br>
[115]	If a construction work is scheduled for a prescribed link from October 1, 2006 to<br>
January 1, 2007 and if the construction work is substantially carried out Monday to<br>
Thursday, a prediction travel time for the link can be provided by the status component<br>
exemplarily shown in FIG. 20 while the construction work is in progress.<br>
[116]	In this case, the start time field of the specific period of the <period_of_time> field<br>
5g, which is carried by the status component and shown in FIG. 20, can be set to<br>
October 1, 2006 and the end time field there of can be set to January 1, 2007. And, the<br>
selector is set to a value of '01h' indicating that the <day_selector> field follows. The 
 <br>
day_selector&gt; includes a selector for selecting a day and a presence or non-presence of<br>
repetition of the corresponding day. And, the <day_selector> can include at least one<br>
of information indicating one of Monday to Sunday and information for a presence or<br>
non-presence of a traffic event repeated on the corresponding day. In the example<br>
shown in FIG. 20, the <day_selector> field can carry a value of '9Eh (= 1001<br>
1110)'indicating Monday to Thursday and a repetition.<br>
[117]	In the same manner, assuming that a construction work is scheduled for a<br>
prescribed link from October 1, 2006 to January 1, 2007 and that the construction work<br>
is supposedto be carried out 10 p.m. to 12 p.m., Monday to Thursday, a prediction<br>
travel time for the link can be provided by the status component exemplarily shown in<br>
FIG. 18. And, the status component can be set to the value according to FIG. 20. In<br>
particular, the start time field of the specific period of the <period_of_time> field 5f is<br>
set to October 1, 2006 and the end time field thereof is set to January 1, 2007. And, the<br>
selector carries a value 07h indicting that <day_selector>, <specific_><br>
and <time_span> fields follow respectively. And, a value of 'BEh (= 1011 1110)'<br>
indicating a repetition of Monday to Friday is carriedby the following <day_selector><br>
field. A value of '58h 17h 01h' indicating 10 p.m. is carried by the next following 
specific_&amp;_iterative_time&gt; field. And, a value of '08h 02h' indicating two hours can be<br>
carried by the last following <time_span> field.<br>
[118]	FIG. 22 and FIG. 23 are exemplary diagrams for a method of calculating prediction<br>
information for CTT information. A traffic information transmitting apparatus is able<br>
to store prediction information for each link according to a time to provide prediction<br>
information for CTT information. For instance, an average link speed of operation information<br>
is stored per day, time zone, week, month, and year. For instance, operation<br>
information is databased per 30 minutes to be stored in a format shown in FIG. 22. The<br>
numerical values shown in FIG. 22 are based on the unit of 'km/h' and follows the<br>
speed expressions for the transmission of operation information.<br>
[119]	A speed at every 30-mintue timing point of the currentlyprovided average speed of<br>
each link keeps being updated and stored for a prescribed time, e.g., 3 hours and a<br>
pattern of the speed variation is compared to the pattern stored in a database corresponding<br>
to a time zone of a current day.<br>
[120]	FIG. 23 exemplarily shows a speed variation pattern on a prescribed day of the<br>
week.<br>
[121]	Referring to FIG. 23, if a 3-hour based speed variation pattern-A up to a present<br>
time of 04:30 p.m. on Monday is shown, the pattern-A can be compared to a speed<br>
variation pattern-B between 01:30 p.m. and 04:30 p.m. on Monday in the database<br>
shown in FIG. 22.<br>
[122]	If a sum of absolute values of the speed variation pattern differences, e.g., speed<br><br>
differences of the respective time zones (a sum of speed differences can be found by<br>
giving a weight value greater than a speed difference of a farther time zone to speed<br>
difference of a time zone closer to a present time zone) is equal to or smaller than a<br>
preset reference value, a speed variation pattern can be used. In particular, in case that<br>
a speed variation pattern is decided as usable, an average speed B1 in a time zone after<br>
30 minutes from a present time, i.e., 05:00 p.m. on the database can be carried as a<br>
prediction average link speed. Of course, a prediction average link speed can be<br>
provided togetherwith predicted time information by predicting an operational status<br>
for a time zone after 1 hour, 1 hour and 30 minutes, 2 hours or more hours.<br>
[123]	If the speed variation pattern difference is greater than the preset reference value,<br>
the prediction average link speed is not provided. Alternatively, a progress or transition<br>
is calculated from a speed variation pattern for previous three hours and a predicted<br>
value for an average speed after 30 minutes is then obtained to provide as a prediction<br>
average link speed. In a method of obtaining a predicted value from FIG. 23, a highest<br>
weight is given to a present time and a lower weight is given to a time getting farther<br>
from the present time. They are multiplied together to find an average value. Alternatively,<br>
one of various graph estimations can be used to obtain the predicted value.<br>
[124]	FIG. 24 shows an example of trafficinformation provided by a traffic information<br>
transmitting apparatus, in which an exemplary structural diagram of a message<br>
carrying parking lot associated information is shown.<br>
[125]	Referring to FIG. 24, a traffic information transmitting apparatus is able to provided<br>
various kinds of traffic associated information using the above-described time information<br>
types. The traffic information transmitting apparatus is able to provide<br>
various components, e.g., a parking lot name component, a parking restriction<br>
component, and the like as well as the components exemplarily shown in the formats<br>
of FIG. 24.<br>
[126]	One message segment includes a messagemanagement container 91, a parking lot<br>
information component, a capacity component 93, and a location container 94.<br>
[127]	And, the parking lot information component 92 can include an opening hour<br>
component 921, a pricing payment component 922, and a facility component 923.<br>
[128]	Moreover, the facility component 923 can include a service operation component<br>
922a, a related facility component 922b, a target site component 922c, and other<br>
facility component 922d.<br>
[129]	In the following description, details of the components included in the parking lot<br>
information component 92 are explained.<br>
[130]	FIG. 25 shows the opening hour component exemplarily shown in FIG. 24.<br>
[131]	Referring to FIG. 25, an opening hour component is able to carry opening hours of<br>
a parking lot. Information for a location of a parking lot, information for commands,<br><br>
and the like can be individually identified by other components, respectively. The<br>
opening hour component includes a type of opening hours (openingHoursType) and is<br>
able to include at least one of a parking lot time type (pkiTimeType), a parking service<br>
type (service_day_type), a vehicle type (vehicleType), and a user type (userType)<br>
according to a value of a selector. In particular, the opening hour component 921,<br>
according to a value of the selector, includes the <tirne_span> field 1002 exemplarily<br>
shown in FIG. 11 and the <specific_> field 1001 shown in FIG. 17.<br>
[132]	The <specific_> field 1001 can carry information for parking lot<br>
opening hours. For instance, if a parking lot is open at 07:00 a.m. everyday, the 
specific_&amp;_iterative_time&gt; field 1001 is set to 'C8h 08h'. In this case, an MSB '1' of<br>
the 'C8h (=1100 1000)' indicates iterative information.<br>
[133]	And, the <time_span> field 1002 is able to carry information for a parking lot<br>
opening time interval according to FIG. 11. For instance, if a parking lot keeps open<br>
for 15 hours from an opening time, the <time_span> field 1002 can be set to a value of<br>
•08h OEh1.<br>
[134]	FIG. 26 is an exemplary diagram of the pricing payment component exemplarily<br>
shown in FIG. 24.<br>
[135]	Referring to FIG. 26, a pricing payment component is provided to indicate a fee<br>
system of a parking lot. The pricing payment component is able to include a parking<br>
fee amount per unit hour. According to a valueof a selector, the pricing payment<br>
component can selectively include at least one of a parking lot time type<br>
pkiTimeType), a vehicle type (vehicleType), a user type (userType), and payment<br>
details (PaymentDetails). The pricing payment component 922 can include a 
time_span&gt; field 101 according to a value of a selector, And, the <time_span> field<br>
101 carries information for a parking fee unit hour. For instance, if a parking lot<br>
charges a parking fee designated by the parking fee amount field by a unit of 10<br>
minutes, the <time_span> field 101 caries a value of '10h 0Ah'.<br>
[136]	FIG. 27 is an exemplary diagram of the service operation component exemplarily<br>
shown in FIG. 24.<br>
[137]	Referring to FIG. 27, the service operation component 922a is able to indicate a<br>
service provided by a parking lot such as a security service, a supervision service, and<br>
the like. According to a value of a selector, the service operation component 922a can<br>
selectively include at least one of asecurity type (securityType), a parking guidance<br>
type (parkingGuidanceType), a supervision type (supervisionType), and a parking time<br>
type (pkiTimeType).<br>
[138]	The service operation component 922a includes a <period_of_time> field 1020<br>
according to a value of aselector. In this case, the <period_of_time> field 1020 is able<br>
to indicate a period of a service provided by a parking lot. For instance, it is assumed<br><br>
that a parking lot exemplarily operates a security service every weekdays except<br>
Saturday and Sunday from October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006. If so, a start time of<br>
the period information field of <period_of_time> is set to October 1, 2006 and an end<br>
time of the period information field of <period_of_time> is set to December 31, 2006.<br>
A selector is set to a value of '01h' indicating that a <day_selector> field follows. And,<br>
the <day_selector> field is finally set to a value of 'BEh (= 1011 1110)' indicating a<br>
repetition of Monday to Friday.<br>
[ 139]	Of course, if the security service is operated for a period of time for permitting a<br>
vehicle parking, e.g., 07:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m., a <specific_> field<br>
within the <period_of_time> field is set to 07:00 a.m. and the <time_span> field is set<br>
to 11 hours. Thus, it is able to use all information elements within the <period_of_time></period_of_time>
&gt; field.<br>
[140]	FIG. 28 is an exemplary diagram of the capacity component shown in FIG. 24.<br>
[141]	Referring to FIG. 28, the capacity component93, according to a value of a selector,<br>
selectively includes at least one of a number of parking available spaces (spaces), a<br>
parking occupancy (parkingOccupancy), a parking state (fillState), a parking state<br>
varying rate (fillStateRate), and a parking available type (availableType). In particular,<br>
according to a value of a selector, the capacity component 93 enables a <time_span><br>
field 1030 to indicate a time taken for parking. For instance, if it takes 5 minutes for<br>
complete parking from a parking lot entry of a vehicle, the corresponding field 1030<br>
caries a value of '10h 05h'.<br>
[142]	In case of attempting to transmit the above-explained traffic information by the<br>
traffic information transmitting and receiving method and apparatus according to the<br>
present invention, an example of a type of a transmission signal is explained as<br>
follows.<br>
[143]	In the traffic informationtransmitting and receiving method and apparatus according<br>
to the present invention, traffic information can be transmitted/received in a broadcast<br>
signal format of DVB-T (digital video broadcasting-terrestrial) or DVB-H (digital<br>
video broadcasting-handheld).<br>
[144]	FIG. 29 is a block diagram of an apparatus for transmitting the above-mentioned<br>
traffic information according to one embodimentof the present invention.<br>
[145]	Referring to FIG. 29, an audio/video signal as a broadcast signal is multiplexed into<br>
an MPEG-2 transport stream (TS) by a multiplexing unit 510 and is then outputted.<br>
The aforesaid traffic information can be multiplexed with the audio/video signal by<br>
MPEG-2 TS format.<br>
[146]	For energy dispersal, the multiplexing unit 510 multiplexes a signal including<br>
traffic information in an MPEG-2 TS format.<br>
[147]	An outer coder 521 encodes multiplexed data to enhance transmission performance<br><br>
for the multiplexed signal. And, an outer interleaver 522 interleaves the encoded data<br>
to enhance the transmission performance for the multiplexed signal. For instance,<br>
Reed-Solomon coding scheme is usable as the outer coding scheme. And, convolution<br>
interleaving is usable for the interleaving.<br>
[148]	An inner coder 531 encodes a signal to be transmitted to prepare for the error<br>
occurrence in the transmission signal. And, an inner interieaver 532 interleaves the<br>
encoded signal to prepare for the error occurrence in the transmission signal. The inner<br>
coder 531 is capable of encoding a transmission signal according to punctured<br>
convolution codes. And, the inner-interleaving can adopt a native or in-depth interleaving<br>
scheme according to a memory use in a transmission mode of 2k, 4k or 8k.<br>
[149]	A mapper 535 is capable of mapping a transmission signal into a symbol according<br>
to 16QAM, 64QAM, QPSK, or the like by considering a pilot and TPS (transmission<br>
parameter signaling) according to a transmission mode.<br>
[150]	A frame configuring unit 540 modulates the mapped signal by OFDM (orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing) and then configures a frame in a manner thata guard<br>
interval is inserted in a data interval including the modulated signal. In this case, each<br>
frame includes 68 OFDM symbols. Each of the OFDM symbols includes 6,817 carriers<br>
in 8k mode or 1,705 carriers in 2k mode. The guard interval is a sort of a cyclic continuation<br>
that copies data of the data interval and its length varies according to a<br>
transmission mode. An OFDM frame includes a scattered pilot signal, a continual pilot<br>
signal, and a TPS carrier. The structure of the frame configured by the frame<br>
configuring unit 540 shown in FIG. 29 is explained with reference to FIG. 30 later.<br>
[151]	A digital-to-analog converting unit 541 converts a digital broadcastsignal having a<br>
guard interval and a data interval to an analog signal. And, a transmitting unit 542is<br>
able to transmit the analog signal as an RF signal. So, the MPEG-2 TS formatted<br>
traffic information can be transmitted by DVB-T. In this case, the MEPG-2 TS<br>
(transport stream) format may have a format of PES (packetized elementary stream) or<br>
section.<br>
[152]	FIG. 30 is a diagram of signal arrangement according to a result of a frame<br>
configured by the frame configuring unit shown in FIG. 29.<br>
[ 153]	Referring to FIG. 30, 'Tu'indicates a number of usable subcarriers, 'Dt'indicates a<br>
distance between scattered pilots on a time axis, and 'Df indicates a distance between<br>
scattered pilots on a frequency axis. The distance Df between scattered pilots on a frequencydomain<br>
determines a delayed range of a ghost that can be estimated on a<br>
channel. And, FIG. 30 shows a position of a pilot to be interpolated in case of<br>
receiving a signal configured by the frame configuring unit.<br>
[154]	Meanwhile, symbols are arranged in a manner that the same pilot pattern can appear<br>
for each four inputted symbols to perform time interpolation at a pilot position in case<br><br>
of signal reception.<br>
[155]	In particular, for a first inputted symbol (t= 1), the same scattered pilot signal of a<br>
symbol inputted at t=5 is arranged. And, time interpolation can be executed for<br>
symbols inputted at t=2, 3, and 4 at a position of a scattered pilot signal in case of<br>
signal reception.<br>
[156]	A symbol inputted at t=6 has the same scattered pilot pattern of a symbol inputted at<br>
t=2, And, time interpolation for signals at t=3, 4, and 5 can be performed at a position<br>
of a scattered pilot of the symbol inputted at t=6 and at a position of a scattered pilot of<br>
the symbol inputted at t=2.<br>
[157]	If the time interpolation is performed in the above manner after a symbol has been<br>
inputted at t=7 in case of signal reception, the symbol inputted at t=4 has scattered<br>
pilots located at each 4-subcarrier position. So, the interval between scattered pilot<br>
signals on a frequency domain of the symbol inputted at t=4 is reduced into ¼ of the<br>
original interval between the scattered pilot signals. And, the symbol inputted at t=4 is<br>
made to have the pattern configured in a manner that a scattered pilot signal is located<br>
at each 4-subcarrier position. Hence, in case of signal reception, more pilot signals can<br>
be located at the corresponding symbol. If signals are transmitted using a continual<br>
pilot signal and a scattered pilot signal, channel compensation can be adaptively<br>
performed according to a status of a reception channel in case of the corresponding<br>
signal reception.<br>
[158]	An apparatus for transmitting traffic information according to another em-<br>
bodimentof the present invention is explained with reference to FIG. 31 as follows.<br>
[ 159]	FIG. 31 is a block diagram of an apparatus for transmitting the above-mentioned<br>
traffic information according to another embodimentof the present invention.<br>
[160]	Referring to FIG. 31, another example of transmitting the traffic information can<br>
adapt DVB-H (digital video broadcasting-handheld). The DVB-H expands a<br>
broadcasting range to a mobile terminal area and enables transmission information as<br>
IP datagram. In this case, the datagram indicates a signal processingmethod of sending<br>
a signal as a packet by Internet protocol. And, the datagram includes a header<br>
containing an IP address and a data container carrying information. The data container<br>
of the packet-unit IP datagram is able to carry video, audio, and traffic information<br>
signals. In particular, the DVB-H uses IP datacasting that transmits the video, audio,<br>
and traffic information signals by dividing and compressing the video, audio, and<br>
traffic information signals by packet unit.<br>
[161]	A signal transforming unit 8 is capable of transforming trafficinformation into data<br>
including IP by compressing the traffic information by separate packet unit together<br>
with audio and video signals. In this ease, IP datais embedded into MPEG-2 TS<br>
(transport stream) by MPE (multi-protocol encapsulation). The MPE can become<br><br>
MPEG-FEC section data to which a forward error correction(FEC) code is added. If<br>
transmission signals are arranged by MPE-FEC (multi-protocol encapsulation-forward<br>
error correction), it is able to enhancea carrier-to-noise (CN) ratio of the transmission<br>
signals. So, the MPE-FEC data including FEC or the MPE data not including FEC can<br>
include IP data formatted transmission data.<br>
[162]	The IP datagram encapsulated by MPE by the signal transforming unit 8 can be<br>
multiplexed by time slicing for the power consumption reduction. And, the<br>
multiplexed signal is transformed into a transport stream to be multiplexed with the<br>
MPEG-2 TS carrying the video or audio signal.<br>
[163]	A modulating and encoding unit 50 can include the blocks21 to 42 shown n FIG.<br>
29. The traffic information multiplexed into the MEPG-2 TS can be transmitted via a<br>
broadcast signal through the modulation and encoding of the DVB-T broadcasting<br>
explained in FIG. 29.<br>
[164]	FIG. 32 is a diagram of an example that a DVB-H type sliced service and a service<br>
transmitted on a shared channel by DVB-T and DVB-H are transmitted on channels.<br>
[165]	Referring to FIG. 32, a program can be transmitted on each channel of DVB-H and<br>
DVB-T. In case that the program is transmitted by DVB-H, each service can be<br>
transmitted by time division multiplexing according to time slicing. Traffic in-<br>
formation is included in IP datagram by DVB-H, transformed into MPE or MPE-FEC,<br>
and then transmitted as MPEG-2 TS in which the transformed MPE or MPE-FEC is<br>
embedded.<br>
[166]	A location of descriptor table information for traffic information according to the<br>
present invention is explained with reference to FIG. 33 as follows.<br>
[167]	FIG. 33 is an exemplary diagram of a location of a descriptor transmittable by<br>
having descriptor table information for traffic information included therein in case that<br>
the traffic information is transmitted by the encoding and modulation explained with<br>
reference to FIGs. 29 to 31. In the example shown in FIG. 33, for convenienceand fa-<br>
cilitation of explanation, a descriptor for traffic information to be transmitted is named<br>
a traffic service descriptor.<br>
[168]	Referring to FIG. 33, table information for parsing traffic information is ex-<br>
emplarily shown if the traffic information transmitted by the present invention is<br>
carried by a broadcast signal.<br>
[169]	The table information transmitted by being included in the broadcast signal can<br>
include NIT, BAT, SDT, EIT, or the like. The table shown in FIG. 33 indicates that a<br>
descriptor for parsing a signal included in a broadcast signal is included in which table<br>
of a transmission signal. And, a case that a descriptor is included in a table is marked<br>
by '*'. For instance, 'network_name_descriptor' can be transmitted by being included in<br>
NIT. So, if the NIT is parsed from a broadcast signal, it is able to obtain a transmitted<br><br>
broadcast signal according to contents of the 'network_name_descriptor'.<br>
[170]	A traffic service descriptor, which is the service information for traffic information<br>
according to thepresent invention, can be placed in at least one table of NIT, SDT, and<br>
PMT.<br>
[171]	The NIT is the table information for providing a transport stream group such as a<br>
channel frequencyand the like and tuning information. The SDT is used in transmitting<br>
a service name and parameter within a transport stream. And, the TMT carries PID in-<br>
formation for video, audio, data and program clock reference (PCR). If the traffic<br>
service descriptor, which is the service information for the traffic information, is<br>
transmitted by being included in the PMT (program map table), the PMT can be<br>
obtained from parsing PAT (program associated table) from MPEG-2 TS. FIG. 33 exemplarily<br>
shows '0x80'as an identifier tag value of the traffic service descriptor.<br>
[172]	FIG. 34 and FIG. 35 are diagrams of PAT and PMT as program information<br>
transmitted by being included in MPEG-2 TS type signals, respectively.<br>
[173]	Referring to FIG. 34 and FIG. 35, PAT is a packet having a PID (packet identifier)<br>
of '0' and is able to play a role in allocating a transport packet to each program. The<br>
PID for the packet carrying the PMT can be obtained from the PAT. And, by obtaining<br>
the PID for the packet from the PMT, it is able to what kind of information is carried<br>
by a prescribed packet within a stream. So, if a packet having a PID obtained from<br>
PMT is found, it is able to obtain the video, audio and traffic information included in<br>
the packet.<br>
[174]	FIG. 36 is an exemplary diagram of a descriptor capable of parsing a broadcast<br>
signal carrying trafficinformation according to the present invention.<br>
[175]	Referring to FIG. 36, a traffic service descriptor inclusive in PMT (program map<br>
table) is capable of parsing a broadcast signal including traffic information.<br>
[ 176]	First of all, a traffic service descriptor includes a descriptor tag field<br>
(descriptor_tag), a descriptor length field (descriptor_length), a service component<br>
number field (Number_of_TPEG_Service_Components) indicating a number of<br>
service components included in the descriptor, and a plurality of sets of traffic information<br>
amounting to a value of the service component number field<br>
(Number_of_TPEG_Service_Components). And, each of a plurality of the traffic information<br>
sets can include a service component identifier field<br>
(Service..Component_ID), an application identifier field (Application_ID) field, and a<br>
service information field.<br>
[177]	Eight bits are allocated to the descriptor_tag. And, the descriptor_tag is set to a<br>
value to identify the traffic information descriptor from other descriptors.<br>
[178]	Eight bits are allocatedto the descriptorjength. And, the descriptor_length indicates<br>
a length to an end of the descriptor after the descriptorjength.<br><br>
[179]	Eight bits are allocated to the Service_component_ID (SCID). And, the<br>
Service_component_ID indicates a value for identifying a service component within<br>
one service. A value of the Service_component_ID (SCID) can be decided by a service<br>
provider.<br>
[180]	Sixteen bits are allocated to the Application_ID. And, a value for identifying each<br>
application is assigned to the Application_ID. In particular, an application identifier<br>
(AID) is assigned to each traffic information application. And, a new AID is assigned<br>
each time a new application is defined.<br>
[181]	Each traffic information within the iterative statement can include a service name<br>
field (Service_name), a service description field (Service_description), a service logo<br>
field (Service_logo), a subscriber information field (Subscriber_information), a free<br>
text information field (Free_text_information), and a help information field<br>
(Help_information). A length of each of the fields within the service information field<br>
is variable and is represented as one format of text string, numeral and graphic.<br>
[182]	The Service_name indicates a service name for traffic information and enables a<br>
user to identify a service. For instance, the Service_name can carry a service name<br>
'Traffic information service by Broadcasting Station-A'.<br>
[183]	The Service_description indicates details of a corresponding service and is provided<br>
to explain service contents in detail. For instance, the Service_description can carry a<br>
service description 'Public Traffic Information for Outer City in South Metropolitan<br>
Area'.<br>
[184]	The Service_logo indicates a service logo and enables a service or a service<br>
provider to be visually identified. The service logo is mainly transmittable in a bit map<br>
or other image format.<br>
[185]	The Subscriber_information indicates subscriber information. For instance, the<br>
Subscriber_Information can carry pricing and payment information for a restricted<br>
service component.<br>
[186]	The Free_text_information indicates additional information to be transmitted to a<br>
user. For instance, the Free_text_information can carry a service interruption, information<br>
cancellation, and the like.<br>
[187]	And, the Help_information indicates help information to be referred to by a user.<br>
For instance, the Help_information can carry an Internet address, a phone number, and<br>
the like.<br>
[188]	Traffic information according to the present invention is explained with reference to<br>
FIG. 37 as follows.<br>
[189]	FIG. 37 is a block diagram of an apparatus for receiving traffic information<br>
according to one embodimentof the present invention.<br>
[190]	Referring to FIG. 37, an apparatus for receiving traffic information according to one<br><br>
embodimentof the present invention includes a tuner 701, a demodulating unit 702, a<br>
demultiplexing unit 703, an audio decoding unit 704, a video decoding unit 705, a data<br>
decoding unit 710, and a traffic information storing unit 711.<br>
[191]	The tuner 701 tunes a frequency of a specific channel via antenna, cable, or<br>
satellite, down-converts a signal to an intermediate frequency(IF) signal, and then<br>
outputs the down-converted signal to the demodulating unit 702. In this case, the signal<br>
received in a frequency of a specific channel includes an audio signal, a video signal, a<br>
traffic information signal, and DVB-T/H descriptor table information.<br>
[ 192]	A channel manager 707 makes a request for a table associated with service information<br>
to the data decoding unit 710 with reference to channel information stored in<br>
a channel map 708 and then received a corresponding result. In this case, the channel<br>
manager 707 is capable of controlling channel tuning of the tuner 701 and can be implemented with a software module.<br>
[ 193]	The demodulating unit 702 demodulates the signal outputted from the tuner 701.<br>
[194]	The demultiplexing unit 703 separates the demodulated signal into a video signal,<br>
an audio signal, and a signal including traffic information and then outputs the signal<br>
by TS packet unit.<br>
[ 195]	And, the demultiplexing unit 703 outputs the TS packet including the traffic information<br>
to the data decoding unit 710.<br>
[196]	The data decoding unit 710 is cable of decoding the TS packet including the traffic<br>
information, PSI (program specific information) according to MPEG-2, descriptor<br>
table information according to DVB-SI (DVB-service information). In the example<br>
shown in FIG. 37, it is assumed that the traffic information is transmitted in a format of<br>
DSM-CC (digital storage media-command and control) section of TS packet payload.<br>
[197]	In case that a traffic information messageis transmitted in the MPEG-2 TS format<br>
according to DVB-T/H, the data decoding unit 710 is able to parse a traffic service<br>
descriptor included in the PMT of the table information according to MPEG-2 TS and<br>
DVB-SI (DVB-service information).<br>
[198]	The data decoding unit 710 parses the traffic information from the DSM-CC section<br>
including the traffic information and then stores the parsed traffic information in the<br>
traffic information storing unit 711.<br>
[199]	The data decoding unit 710 configures a table by collecting sections having the<br>
same table identifiers (table_id).<br>
[200]	The data decoding unit 710 databases the descriptor table information in the traffic<br>
information storing unit 711 and is able to store the traffic information message.<br>
[201]	If the data decoding unit 710 parsesthe traffic service descriptor, it is able to obtain<br>
application identifying information, service component identifying information,<br>
service information (e.g., service name, service description, service logo, subscriber in-<br><br>
formation, free text information, help information, etc.) and the like of the traffic in-<br>
formation message transmitted on a corresponding channel.<br>
[202]	A first application manager 706 shown in FIG. 7 drives a native application<br>
program stored in a storage unit 709 to perform such a general function as a channel<br>
switching and the like. In this case, the native application program means loaded<br>
software since a receiving apparatus has been manufactured.<br>
[203]	If there is a user request is made to a receiving system via a user interface (UI), the<br>
first application manager 706 complies with the user requestby displaying a graphic<br>
user interface (GUI) on a screen. The user interface receives the user request via an<br>
input device such as a remote controller, a keypad, a jog dial, a touchscreen on the<br>
screen, and the like and then outputs it to the first application manager 706, a data<br>
broadcast application manager 713, and the like.<br>
[204]	The first application manager 706 is able to perform channel associated operations<br>
by controlling a channel manager 707. In particular, the first application manager 706<br>
is able to manage the channel map 708 and control the data decoding unit 710.<br>
[205]	The first application manager 706 stores a GUI control of an overall receiving<br>
system, a user request, and a status of the receiving system in the storage unit 709 and<br>
reconstructs them from the storage unit 709.<br>
[206]	Meanwhile, if a data service requestis made by the user interface (UI), the data<br>
broadcast application manager 713 provides a data service to a user by processing the<br>
requested data in a manner of driving the corresponding application program stored in<br>
the storage unit 709. For this data service, the data broadcast application manager 713<br>
supports the GUI. In this case, the data service is provided in a format of text, audio,<br>
graphic, still picture, moving picture, and/or the like.<br>
[207]	The data broadcast application manager 713 can be a software or hardware platform<br>
to execute an application program stored in the storage unit 709. In this case, the<br>
platform includes a Java virtual machine to execute a Java program for example.<br>
[208]	And, the data broadcast application manager 713 executes a traffic information<br>
providing application program stored in the storage unit 709 to process the traffic information<br>
message stored in the traffic information storing unit 711. An exampleof<br>
providing the traffic information service in the above manner is explained as follows.<br>
[209]	First of all, a traffic information service, which can be provided by the present<br>
invention, can be provided to a plurality of users via at least one of text, audio, graphic,<br>
still picture and moving picture in a receiver loaded with either an electronic map or a<br>
GPS or a receiver failing to be loaded with both of the electronic map and the GPS.<br>
[210]	If the receiving system shown in FIG. 36 is loaded with a GPS module 714, the<br>
GPS module 714 receives satellite signals transmitted by a plurality of low orbit<br>
satellites, extracts current location information (latitude, longitude, altitude), and then<br><br>
outputs the current location information to the data broadcast application manager 713.<br>
In this case, an electronic map and various kinds of graphic information including a<br>
plurality of links and nodes of roads can be stored in the traffic information storing unit<br>
711, the storage unit 709, or other storage units.<br>
[211]	If so, the data broadcast application manager 713 is able to provide the traffic information<br>
service requested by a user based on the current position obtained by the<br>
GPS module 714, the traffic information message stored in the traffic information<br>
storing unit 711, and the like by executing the traffic information providing application<br>
program.<br>
[212]	By the request made by the data broadcast application manager 713, the traffic information<br>
messagestored in the traffic information storing unit 711 is read out and then<br>
inputted to the data broadcast application manager 713.<br>
[213]	The data broadcast application manager 713 interprets the traffic informationmessage<br>
read from the traffic information storing unit 711 and then outputs<br>
necessary information and/or control signal according to contents of the interpreted<br>
message. For facilitation and convenience of explanation, it is assumed that the user<br>
made a request for a CTT (congestion and travel time) status.<br>
[214]	The data broadcast application manager 713 extracts messageidentification information<br>
and information for a message generation time and message transmission<br>
time within the messagemanagement container 102 of the traffic information message<br>
and then recognizes whether a following container is a CTT status container from the<br>
message identification information. In this case, 'message element' informationcontains<br>
a message identifier and a version number. The messageidentifier and the version<br>
number are necessary elements included in all kinds of messages and are used for the<br>
data broadcast application manager 713 to manage the traffic information message.<br>
[215]	If the following container is the CTT status container 104, information is obtained<br>
from the CTT component within the CTT status container 104 to activate a display<br>
action according to the road operation status information and the prediction information<br>
for the road operation status. And, location informationcorresponding to the<br>
currently received operation information is obtained from the following location<br>
container 106.<br>
[216]	In this case, the location information is position coordinates (longitude or latitude)<br>
of start and end points or a link ID assigned to a link, i.e., a road section according to a<br>
location type of the location container. If necessary, a link correspondingto the<br>
received information is specified with reference to the information for the respective<br>
links and nodes stored in the traffic information storing unit 711. And, the received<br>
location coordinates of the link are converted to the link ID to use, and vice versa.<br>
According to the present invention, if the location type information is the link ID and if<br><br>
the location information is the text information including the road name associated<br>
with the link, it is able to specify a link corresponding to the received information for<br>
the operation status with reference to the information for the corresponding link. If the<br>
location information is the link ID and if the link ID is a defined code, it is able to<br>
specify a link corresponding to the received information for the operation status using<br>
the information for the corresponding link with reference to a link system stored in the<br>
traffic information storing unit 711.<br>
[217]	Meanwhile, the data broadcast application manager 713 reads a necessary electronic<br>
map from the traffic information storing unit 711 centering on the currentlocation coordinates<br>
received from the GPS module 712 and the displays the read electronic map<br>
on a screen. In this case, a point corresponding to the currentlocation can be marked by<br>
a graphic sign.<br>
[218]	And, the data broadcast application manager 713 controls average link speed information<br>
received via the traffic information message to be displayed on a link corresponding<br>
to the link ID or the location coordinated of the locationcontainer following<br>
the container carrying the average link speed information. For this, a color can vary<br>
according to an average link speed (e.g., in case of a normal road, red, orange, green<br>
and blue indicate 0~10km/h, 10~20km/h, 20~40km/h, and 41km/h or higher, re-<br>
spectively) or a correspondinglink is indicated by a numeral. If the congestion<br>
transition information extracted from the traffic information message has a value of 1<br>
or 2, a text string ('increase1 or 'decrease') or icon assigned to the valuecan be displayed<br>
on the correspondinglink together. If it is 0 or 3, a displayed status is maintained as it is<br>
without a separate update. If the congestion transition information is the information<br>
for an average speed variation rate, it is displayed on the screen according to a request<br>
made by a user. This is to reduce the visual confusion of a vehicle driver. And, it can<br>
be displayed together with an available range, e.g., a set traveling path or a front path.<br>
[219]	If the receiving apparatus fails to be provided with the traffic information storing<br>
unit 711 storing the electronic map and the like or other storage units, an average link<br>
speed of a link ahead of a current traveling path is discriminated by a color or indicated<br>
by a numeral. If a path, on which a vehicle loaded with a receiving apparatus such as a<br>
traffic information receiving terminal is to travel, is set, it is able to display average<br>
link speeds for the links included in the traveling path only.<br>
[220]	If the information added to the traffic information messageis the information for a<br>
famous restaurant, a theatre, or the like within a link, the data broadcast application<br>
manager 713 can display the corresponding point to be discriminated on the link<br>
displayed on the screen and control the corresponding information to be displayed as<br>
text on the screen.<br>
[221 ]	According to a requestmade by a user, the data broadcast application manager 713<br><br>
enables information for the travel time, link delay and congestion type for each link,<br>
which is extracted from the traffic information message, to be displayed on the screen<br>
together with or insteadof the average link speed. If a user makes a request for<br>
predicted information about a road operation status by specifying a predicted time, the<br>
data broadcast application manager 713 displays a prediction average link speed<br>
received via the traffic information messageas a color or numeral instead of a present<br>
average speed. Of course, if a user makes a requestfor a display mode as a prediction<br>
travel time mode instead of a present average speed, the data broadcast application<br>
manager 713 displays the received prediction travel time information as an electronic<br>
map or graphic image on the screen.<br>
[222]	If an auto search function for a destination is set in the receiving apparatus shown in<br>
FIG. 37, it is able to search or re-search for a preferable path based on the received<br>
prediction average link speed or the received prediction travel time. For instance, for<br>
each link after the node at which a user is supposed to arrive at a present traveling<br>
speed after 30 minutes, it is able to select a link, which takes a shortest time to a set<br>
destination, as a traveling path to be displayed as a path on the screen using the<br>
received prediction average link speed or the received prediction travel time after 30<br>
minutes. In case that the receiving apparatus according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention shown in FIG. 37 is provided with an audio output means, the<br>
operation status information or the prediction information for an operation status for<br>
the specified link can be outputted as audio.<br>
[223]	The information and/or control information extracted from the traffic information<br>
messageis temporarily stored in a volatile memory (not shown in the drawing) such as<br>
a RAM and then usable by the data broadcast application manager 713.<br>
[224]	After having used the information stored in the volatile memory, the data broadcast<br>
application manager 713 keeps storing the used information for a prescribed time<br>
instead of deleting the used information. For instance, thedata broadcast application<br>
manager 713 keeps storing the information within a last one hour, and more particularly,<br>
the average link speed or the travel time for each twenty minutes (top of the<br>
hour, 20 minutes after the hour, 40 minutes after the hour). It is able to set the last time<br>
long and a storing interval short according to a memory capacity. In case that an<br>
average speed provided for each link is stored, if a user selects a specific link, the data<br>
broadcast application manager 713 displays a history of the average speed stored for<br>
the specific link, a travel time history and prediction average link speed, or a prediction<br>

[226]	FIG. 38 is a block diagram of an apparatus for receiving traffic information<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention, in which a navigation<br>
terminal is shown.<br>
[227]	Referring to FIG. 38, an apparatus for receiving traffic information according to<br>
another embodimentof the present invention includes a tuner 811, a demodulating unit<br>
812, a decoding unit 813, a storage unit 814, a control unit 815, a display controller<br>
816, a display unit 817, a GPS module 818, and an input unit 819.<br>
[228]	The tuner 811 tunes a signal including traffic information having the aforesaid type<br>
time information. The demodulating unit 812 demodulates the tuned signal by a predetermined<br>
scheme and then outputs the demodulated signal. The decoding unit 813<br>
decodes the demodulated signal into a traffic information message sequence, interprets<br>
each message within the sequence, and then delivers contents of the interpreted<br>
messageto the control unit 815.<br>
[229]	The decoding unit 813 extracts date/hour and message generation time from a<br>
message management container of each traffic information message and then outputs<br>
information for discriminating the followingdata is a congestion information event<br>
container, a parking lot information component, or the like from the information of information<br>
for 'message component.<br>
[230]	The decoding unit 813 decodes location information corresponding to currently<br>
transmitted operation information from a location container flowing the congestion information<br>
event container and then outputs the decoded location information.<br>
[231]	The storage unit 814 stores location information for each link or node and information<br>
including time information and traffic information from a received signal.<br>
[232]	The control unit 815 enables traffic informationoutputted by the decoding unit 813<br>
or traffic information stored in the storage unit 814 to be displayed to a user.<br>
[233]	The display controller 816 enables the display unit 817 to output the traffic information<br>
outputted by the control unit 815.<br>
[234]	The input unit 819 receives a control command from a user and then delivers the received<br>
control command to the control unit 315.<br>
[235]	If the data of the message management container include the components associated<br>
with the parking lot information, the decodingunit 813 delivers the decoded in-<br><br>
formation of the components to the control unit 815. The control unit 515 is then able<br>
to control the display unit 817 to display the decoded parking lot associated information.<br>
[236]	The control unit 815 reads a necessary part of an electronic map from the storage<br>
unit 814 centering on current location coordinates received from the GPS module 814<br>
and then controls the display unit 817 to display the traffic information as graphic<br>
signs.<br>
[237]	A method of receiving traffic information according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention is explained with reference to FIG. 39 as follows.<br>
[238]	FIG. 39 is a flowchart of a method of receivingtraffic information according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[239]	Referring to FIG. 39, in case that traffic information is carried by DVB-T/H, traffic<br>
information is received via a broadcast signal.<br>
[240]	First of all, while a power of a receiver is turned on (S721), if a channel selection or<br>
a channel switching is inputted (S722), a physical frequency corresponding to the<br>
selected or switched channel is tuned using a channel map (S723).<br>
[241]	If so, stream parsing informationsuch as PMT according to MPEG-2 TS format and<br>
multiplexed traffic information data can be received via the tuned frequencyof the cor-<br>
responding channel. If the traffic information data is received (S724), the de-<br>
multiplexer 703 is able to demultiplex the traffic information message using PID<br>
detection from the stream parsing information (PAT/PMT) and section filtering<br>
(S725).<br>
[242]	Tf a traffic information descriptor is parsed from the stream parsing information, it<br>
is able to obtain an application identifier associated with the traffic information, a<br>
service component identifier associated with the traffic information, service information<br>
associated with the traffic information, and the like. In particular, information<br>
for a virtual channel is extracted from the stream parsing information with<br>
reference to a stream type (ES type) and a PID of a stream packet (S726). If there<br>
exists an A/V ES for a broadcast output (S727), A/V PID of the corresponding virtual<br>
channel (VCH) of the channel map is set (S728). A/V demultiplexing and decoding are<br>
then executed (S729). If so, a user is able to view the broadcast corresponding to the<br>
A/V (S730).<br>
[243]	Meanwhile, if the A/V ES does not exist n the virtual channel in the step S727, it is<br>
checked whether the traffic information data is transmitted on the virtual channel<br>
(S731). For the presence or non-presence of the traffic information data, an application<br>
identifier, a service component identifier, service information and the like can be<br>
obtained by parsing the descriptor table information for the traffic information from the<br>
stream parsing information. Assuming that the traffic information data is carried by a<br><br>
DSM-CC section, all DSM-CC formatted traffic information data is received using<br>
PID of ES obtainedfrom PMT (S732). A user specific traffic information service is<br>
then provided (S733).<br>
[244]	In the step S731, if the A/V ES does not exist on the virtual channel and if it is<br>
confirmed that the traffic information data does not exist, it is decided that the virtual<br>
channel is an invalid channel. In this case, it is able to display that a valid channel or<br>
signal does not exist (S736). And, the process goes back to the step S724 to newly<br>
receive a valid program information table.<br>
[245]	Meanwhile, it is checked whether a channel switching requestis made in the course<br>
of viewing a broadcast (S734). If a channel switching is requestedand if the requested<br>
channel switching is a virtual channel switching, a data broadcast work is reset and the<br>
process then goes back to the step S726. If the requested channel switching is a<br>
physical channel switching, the process goes back to the step S723 to tune a corre-<br>
spondingphysical channel.<br>
[246]	If the channel switching request is not made, it is checked whether a version of<br>
stream parsing information such as PAT, PMT, and the like is upgraded (S735). If it is<br>
confirmed that the stream parsing informationversion is upgraded in the step S735, this<br>
means that channel information is changed from a broadcasting station. So, the process<br>
goes back to the step S724 toreceive stream parsing information again. If it is<br>
confirmed that there is no channel information change in the step S735, the corresponding<br>
broadcast cankeep being viewed.<br>
[247]	FIGs. 40 to 43 are diagrams for displaying traffic information provided according to<br>
an embodimentof the present invention.<br>
[248]	Referring to FIG. 40, a color can vary according to an average link speed (e.g., in<br>
case of a normal road, red, orange, green and blue indicate 0~10km/h, 10~20km/h,<br>
20~40km/h, and 41km/h or higher, respectively) or a corresponding link is indicated<br>
by a numeral.<br>
[249]	In case of displaying traffic information including time information, if a user makes<br>
a request for an predicted operation status via an input unit, information for a<br>
prediction average link speed or prediction average link speed for each link can be<br>
displayed.<br>
[250]	Meanwhile, a user is able to specify a predicted time via the input unit. For<br>
instance, a user is able to specify a predicted time such as '1 hour later' or '07:30 p.m.'.<br>
[251]	FIG. 41 shows an example of displaying a predicted time 1201 on an upper end of a<br>
screen. For a link having a matched predicted time or a non-approximate predicted<br>
time, 'information not acquired' can be represented as a color not used in indicating an<br>
operation status, e.g., gray 1202. In case that a destination auto search function is set<br>
for a destination, it is able to search or re-search for a shortcut based on a prediction<br><br>
average link speed (or, prediction travel time). For instance, for each link after a<br>
diverging point (crossroad) at which a vehicle will arrive at a current traveling speed<br>
30 minutes later, it is able to select a link, which takes a shortest time to a set<br>
destination, as a traveling path to be displayed as a path on the screen by obtaining<br>
predicted operation information enabling a predicted period or a start time to be used<br>
as a prediction average speed (or a prediction travel time) after 30 minutes from the<br>
currently received predicted operation information.<br>
[252]	FIG. 42 shows an exemplary diagram of the provided parking lot associated information.<br><br>
[253]	Referring to FIG. 42, if a user makes a request for 'parking lot information', a traffic<br>
information receiving apparatus searches parking lot associated information and then<br>
displays names of paring lots having location informationin the vicinity of a current<br>
location like FIG. 4. In particular, an example of displaying a number of parking<br>
available spaces obtained from a capacity component for a searched parking lot and a<br>
time taken to complete a parking (<time_span> type time) are displayed together.<br>
[254]	FIG. 43 exemplarily shows details of one of the searched parking lots.<br>
[255]	Referring to FIG. 43, a traffic informationreceiving apparatus is able to display information<br>
for opening hours obtained from an opening hour component, information<br>
for a unit time obtained from a pricing payment component, and the like among<br>
parking lot associated information.<br>
[256]	FIGs. 40 to 43 relate to display examples of providing a user with information for<br>
vehicle operation provided by the server 100 via screen. And, these display modes can<br>
be variously modified, corrected, and compensated intuitively. So, although a mode of<br>
displaying the information for the vehicle operation explained in the present invention<br>
on the screen is changed or a mode of the information recognized by a user is changed<br>
(e.g., audio mode), if the invention uses the configuration of the information for the<br>
vehicle operation and the processing method thereof, it is intended that the present<br>
invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention that come within the<br>
scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>

according to one embodimentof the present invention.<br>
[258]	Referring to FIG. 44, a method of transmitting traffic information may include the<br>
following steps.<br>
[259]	First of all, audio data, video data, component data carrying traffic information,<br>
time information for the traffic information, and stream parsing information including<br>
descriptor table information for parsing the traffic information are multiplexed into<br>
transport streams, (S810). In this case, the multiplexed traffic information can be encapsulated<br>
into IP datagram.<br><br>
[260]	Error correction coding is carried out on the multiplexed streams and the encoded<br>
signals are interleaved (S815).<br>
[261]	A scattered pilot signal varying according to a time and a continual pilot signal<br>
fixed according to a time are mapped within one frame of the interleaved signals<br>
(S820).<br>
[262]	The mapped signals within the frame are modulated by OFDM (orthogonal frequen-<br>
cydivision multiplexing). And, portions of the modulated signals within the frame are<br>
inserted in a guard interval of the modulated frame (S825).<br>
[263]	And, a signal having the guard interval inserted therein isconverted to an RF signal<br>
and then transmitted (S830).<br>
[264]	A method of receiving the traffic information is explained as follows.<br>
[265]	First of all, a broadcast signal generating from multiplexing an audio signal, a video<br>
signal, a data signal including traffic information and time information for the traffic<br>
information, and stream parsing information for parsing descriptor table information<br>
for the traffic information with each other is received (S840).<br>
[266]	Channel compensation is carried out by considering a scattered pilot signal and a<br>
continualpilot signal of the received signal and a broadcast transport stream is<br>
outputted by performing error correction on the demodulated signal (S845).<br>
[267]	The descriptor table information for the traffic information is parsed by demultiplexing<br>
the broadcast transport stream and the data signal including the traffic information<br>
is obtained (S850).<br>
[268]	The traffic information included in the data signal is implemented to be displayed<br>
(S855).<br>
[269]	Accordingly, the present invention enables various kinds of traffic information to be<br>
transmitted using DVB-H or DVB-T broadcast signals. In particular, the present<br>
invention enables information for CTT status to be transmitted by DVB-H or DVB-T.<br>

traffic information, time information for the traffic information,<br>
and stream parsing information including descriptor table<br>
information for parsing the traffic information into broadcast<br>
transport streams, performing error correction encoding<br>
on the multiplexed streams and interleaving the encoded signals,<br>
mapping a scattered pilot signal changed according to a<br>
time and a continual pilot signal fixed according to the time<br>
within one frame of the interleaved signals, modulating the<br>
mapped signals within the frame by OFDM and inserting portions<br>
of the modulated signals within the frame in a guard interval<br>
of the modulated frame, and converting the signal having<br>
the guard interval inserted therein to an RF signal and transmitting<br>
the RF signal.</time_span></time_span></time_span></period_of_time></specific_></day_selector></day_selector></period_of_time></period_of_time></period_of_time></period_of_time></time_span></time_span></time_span></time_span></specific_></specific_></tirne_span></time_span></day_selector></time_span></specific_></day_selector></period_of_time></day_selector></day_selector></day_selector></period_of_time></time_span></specific_></time_span></period_of_time></specific_></day_selector></day_selector></day_selector></time_span></day_selector></specific_></period_of_time></time_span></tirne_span></specific_></specific_></specific_></specific_></specific_.></time_span></specific_></intunlo></time_span></intunti></time_span></time_span></time_span></time_span></time_span></time_span></td>
