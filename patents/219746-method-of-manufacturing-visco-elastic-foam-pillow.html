Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a foam pillow, more particularly it is sag resistant, low resilient and temperature sensitive visco elastic foam pillow. It is also highly flexible, high damping and moulds to the curve of the body whereby stress free sleep is ensured.<br>
Description of the related Art<br>
Conventional foam pillows cause pressure on specific parts of the body viz. shoulder blades and other points. Conventional pillows cause localized pressure at shoulder blades, scuff of the neck which may result in poor circulation of blood resulting in pressure spikes, stiffiiess and pain.<br>
In view of the fact that conventional pillows cause pressure on specific part of the body it was not contemplated to provide a low resilient, highly flexible and temperature sensitive foam due to which the foam attains visco elasticity to overcome the resilience. Due to this inherent limitation of the quality of the foam which is primary component of pillows it is quite difficult to fiirther improve the durability of the product.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a visco elastic foam pillow and a potential to be used in mattresses, chairs, cushions, sky wear,    toys,    ear    plug,    shoe    etc    and    which    overcomes    the<br><br>
aforementioned problems, commonly associated with the prior art. The drawback of the conventional pillows and the benefits of the visco elastic foam pillow is enunciated in figure 1 of the drawing accompanying the complete specification.<br>
According to this invention the visco elastic foam pillow comprises the raw materials viz. polyols, toluene-di-isocynate and special additives to impart visco elasticity for the product. The visco elastic foam is breathable, thus allowing air to circulate and the moisture to dissipate which is good for arthritic problems and for prevention of pressure spikes and for reducing skin irritation and bed sour. It is thus anti microbial and dust - mite resistant. The visco elastic foam softens and flows around the pressure points. It can regulate the pressure fi-om 30mm hg to around 15mm hg.<br>
The visco elastic foa21m pillow has the balanced (Tg) factor, which is optimized at 30^C to adhere to the body temperature, which facilitates softness and holds the neck at optimal pressure. Thus reducing tossing and turning and ensures improved circulation.<br>
Open celled physical structure of the visco elastic foam pillow facilitates self ventilating throughout the pillow whereby the body heat is dissipated and counter pressure and harmfiil capillary compression due to restriction caused at pressure points are eliminated.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the<br><br>
invention with reference to the flow chart represented as figures 3 and 4 of the drawings accompanying the complete specification.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the drawings show in elevation the conventional<br>
pillow and visco elastic foam pillow respectively.<br>
Figure 3 and Figure 4 of the drawings refer to the flow charts, which explain the detailed process of manufacture of the visco elastic foam pillow.<br>
In conventional pillow (Figure 1) the load on the pillow (Numeral 1) gets deflected in both directions of the pillow (Numerals 2 and 3). In respect of visco elastic foam pillow (Figure 2) the load is not deflected. But the load is absorbed by the pillow because of the provision of the layer in the pillow. The illustration shows the application of the load (Numeral 1), the segment which absorbs the load (Numeral 2) and the bottom portion of the pillow giving resistance to the load (Numeral 3) This effect is due to the provision of foam block within the pillow.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INVENTION Referring to Figure 3 and Figure 4, a process of manufacturing of visco elastic foam pillow, according to the present invention is shown to comprise the following steps.<br>
The raw materials such as polyols, toluene-di-isocynate, amine, tin and surfactant are collected in respective storage tanks. They are injected into<br><br>
speed mixing at 500 RPM for a span of about 5 minutes and then subjected to high speed mixing for about 3 seconds. The mixed compound starts reacting ^id forms the foam block.<br>
The raw materials such as polyols, toluene-di-isocynate, special additives, amine, tin and surfactant go through poly condensation and poly addition, wherein firstly in the presence of water, certain molecules of the materials are eliminated, which is referred to as poly condensation and subsequently water molecules are replaced to form poly urethane, the process being referred to as poly addition.<br>
Water molecules mix with isocynate to result in carbon dioxide, which goes through an exothermic reaction forming liquid polymer. The liquid polymer is then blown by carbon dioxide, which results in the formation polyurethane foam.The foam is cured for 48 hours.<br>
Salient features of Invention<br>
1.	Visco elastic foam can be used in pillows, mattresses, chairs, cushions, sky wear, toys, ear plug and shoes.<br>
2.	The foam being low resilient, offers muscular comfort to the body.<br>
3.	The foam can be used as fire retardant as it helps in warding off bums.<br>
4.	The foam is anti parasitic and hence it is hygienic.<br>
5.	The foam is soft and supportive with a balanced factor (Tg), which is being optimized to 30 degrees to adhere to the body temperature. The foam facilitates softness and flows around the pressure points in the human body, thereby enabling good health.<br><br>
6.	The foam is anti parasitic and hence it is hygienic.<br>
7.	The foam is soft and supportive with a balanced factor (Tg), which is being optimized to 30 degree to adhere to the body temperature. The foam facilitates and flows around the pressure points in the human body there by enabling good health.<br>
8.	The foam is anti microbial, dust mite resistant and breathable, thus allowing the moisture o dissipate, which is good for arthritic problem, skin irritations and bed sore.<br>
9.	The foam has the features of heat dissipater having an open celled physical structure which facilitates self ventilating through out the pillow thereby dissipating body heat and in the process eliminating counter pressure and harmfiil capillary compression due to restriction caused at pressure points in the body while sleeping.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
