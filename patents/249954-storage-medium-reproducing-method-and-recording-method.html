				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
STORAGE MEDIUM, REPRODUCING METHOD, AND RECORDING<br>
METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to a<br>
storage medium such as an optical disk, a reproducing<br>
method, and a recording method of the storage medium<br>
capable of recording and reproducing information with a<br>
laser light beam having a short wavelength such as a<br>
blue laser light beam.<br>
As is well known, in recent years, with prevalence<br>
of personal computers or the like, media for<br>
accumulating digital data has been increasingly<br>
important. For example, currently, an information<br>
storage medium capable of digitally recording and<br>
reproducing video image information and voice<br>
information or the like for a long time is prevalent.<br>
In addition, an information storage medium for digital<br>
recording and reproduction is used for a mobile device<br>
such as a cellular phone.<br>
As an information storage medium of this type,<br>
there is often utilized a medium of disk shape because<br>
the medium has a large capacity of recording<br>
information; has random access performance capable of<br>
speedily making a search for desired recording<br>
information; and moreover, the medium is small in size<br>
and light in weight, excellent in storage property and<br>
portability, and is inexpensive.<br>
In addition, as an information storage medium of<br>
such a disk shape, currently, there is mainly used a so<br>
called optical disk capable of recording and<br>
reproducing information in a non-contact manner by<br>
irradiating a laser light beam. This optical disk<br>
primarily conforms to a CD (Compact Disk) standard or a<br>
DVD (Digital Versatile Disk) standard, and is<br>
compatible with both of these standards.<br>
There are three types of optical disks, i.e., a<br>
read-only type which cannot record information such as<br>
a CD-DA (Digital Audio), a CD-ROM (Read-Only Memory), a<br>
DVD-V (Video), or a DVD-ROM and the like; a write-once<br>
type capable of recording information only once such as<br>
a CD-R (Recordable) or a DVD-R and the like; and a<br>
rewritable type capable of rewriting information any<br>
times such as a CD-RW (Rewritable) or a DVD-RW and the<br>
like.<br>
Among them, as a recordable disk, a write-once<br>
type optical disk using an organic dye for a recording<br>
layer is the most prevalent because of its low<br>
manufacturing cost. This is because, if an information<br>
recording capacity exceeds 700 MB (Mega Bytes), there<br>
is almost no need for erasing recorded information and<br>
rewriting new information, and eventually only one<br>
recording suffices.<br>
In the write-once type optical disk using the<br>
organic dye for the recording layer, after a recording<br>
area (track) specified by a groove is irradiated with a<br>
laser light beam and a resin substrate is excessively<br>
heated to its glass transition point Tg or more, an<br>
organic dye film in the groove causes an opto-chemical<br>
reaction and produces a negative pressure. As a<br>
result, the resin substrate is deformed in the groove.<br>
A recording mark is formed by utilizing this<br>
deformation.<br>
A typical organic dye used for a CD-R whose<br>
wavelength of a recording and reproducing laser light<br>
beam is about 780 nm includes a phthalocyanine based<br>
dye such as IRGAPHOR Ultragreen MX available from Ciba<br>
Speciality Chemicals. In addition, a typical organic<br>
dye used for a DVD-R whose wavelength of a recording<br>
and reproducing laser light beam is about 650 nm<br>
includes an azo metal complex based dye available from<br>
Mitsubishi Kagaku Media Co., Ltd.<br>
In the meantime, in comparison with a current<br>
optical disk, in a next generation optical disk which<br>
achieves recording and reproduction with higher density<br>
and higher performance, a blue laser light beam whose<br>
wavelength is short at about 405 nm is used as a<br>
recording and reproducing laser light beam. However,<br>
an organic dye material capable of obtaining<br>
practically sufficient recording and reproducing<br>
characteristics by using a light beam having such a<br>
short wavelength has not been developed yet.<br>
In document 1 (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication<br>
No. 2002-74740), there is disclosed an optical storage<br>
medium having a longer wavelength than a wavelength of<br>
a write light beam in absorption extremity of an<br>
organic dye compound contained in a recording layer.<br>
However, in this document 1, for example, there is<br>
nowhere described a configuration of enhancing<br>
performance of an optical disk itself such as<br>
durability in the case where a mark recorded in an<br>
optical disk has been continuously reproduced by a blue<br>
laser light pickup. There is a need for a signal not<br>
to be degraded in the case where a certain track is<br>
continuously reproduced. A write-once type optical<br>
disk using an excellent dye in reproduction light<br>
stability must be provided.<br>
In document 2 (Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication<br>
No. 2004-139712), there is disclosed an Ag-group alloy<br>
reflection film or a semipermeable reflection film for<br>
an optical information recording medium, the Ag-group<br>
alloy reflection film being made of an Ag-group alloy<br>
containing 0.005 at% to 0.40 at% of Bi and/or Sb in<br>
total. However, document 2 merely discloses a<br>
reflection film simplex, and does not describe how an<br>
organic dye component is used as a recording layer and<br>
how the above-described storage medium is configured as<br>
using a recording and reproducing light beam having a<br>
short wavelength.<br>
As has been described above, a conventional<br>
storage medium using an organic dye material is not<br>
sufficient in reproduction durability count.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various embodiments according to the invention<br>
will be described hereinafter with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. In general, according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention, a storage medium comprises<br>
a recording layer using an organic dye material formed<br>
on a substrate; and a reflection layer comprises Ag and<br>
an additive element which prevents degradation of<br>
recording and reproducing characteristics due to<br>
reaction with Ag and the organic dye material.<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of a recording medium and<br>
a method for recording and reproducing the recording<br>
medium according to the invention will be described<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Summary of characteristics and advantageous effect<br>
of the invention<br>
1) Relationship between track pitch/bit pitch and<br>
optimal recording power:<br>
Conventionally, in the case of a principle of<br>
recording with a substrate shape change, if a track<br>
pitch is narrowed, a "cross-write" or a "cross-erase"<br>
occurs, and if bit pitches are narrowed, an inter-code<br>
crosstalk occurs. As in the present embodiment, since<br>
a principle of recording without a substrate shape<br>
change is devised, it becomes possible to achieve high<br>
density by narrowing track pitches/bit pitches. In<br>
addition, at the same time, in the above described<br>
principle of recording, recording sensitivity is<br>
improved, enabling high speed recording and multilayering<br>
of a recording film because optimal recording<br>
power can be lowly set.<br>
2) In optical recording with a wavelength of<br>
620 nm or less, an ECC block is composed of a<br>
combination of a plurality of small ECC blocks and each<br>
item of data ID information in two sectors is disposed<br>
in a small ECC block which is different from another:<br>
According to the embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2B,<br>
a local optical characteristic change in a recording<br>
layer 3-2 is a principle of recording, and thus, an<br>
arrival temperature in the recording layer 3-2 at the<br>
time of recording is lower than that in the<br>
conventional principle of recording due to plastic<br>
deformation of a transparent substrate 2-2 or due to<br>
thermal decomposition or gasification (evaporation) of<br>
an organic dye recording material. Therefore, a<br>
difference between an arrival temperature and a<br>
recording temperature in a recording layer 3-2 at the<br>
time of playback is small. In the present embodiment,<br>
an interleaving process between small ECC blocks and<br>
data ID allocation are contrived in one ECC block,<br>
thereby improving reproduction reliability in the case<br>
where a recording film is degraded at the time of<br>
repetitive playback.<br>
3) Recording is carried out by light having a<br>
wavelength which is shorter than 620 nm, and a recorded<br>
portion has a higher reflection factor than a nonrecording<br>
portion:<br>
Under the influence of absorption spectrum<br>
characteristics of a general organic dye material,<br>
under the control of light having a wavelength which is<br>
shorter than 620 nm, the light absorbance is<br>
significantly lowered, and recording density is<br>
lowered. Therefore, a very large amount of exposure is<br>
required to generate a substrate deformation which is a<br>
principle of recording in a conventional DVD-R. By<br>
employing an "Low to High (hereinafter, abbreviated to<br>
as L-H) organic dye recording material" whose<br>
reflection factor is increased more significantly than<br>
that of an unrecorded portion in a portion (recording<br>
mark) recorded as in the present embodiment, a<br>
substrate deformation is eliminated by forming a<br>
recording mark using a "discoloring action due to<br>
dissociation of electron coupling", and recording<br>
sensitivity is improved.<br>
4) "L-H" organic dye recording film and PSK/FSK<br>
modulation wobble groove:<br>
Wobble synchronization at the time of playback can<br>
be easily obtained, and reproduction reliability of a<br>
wobble address is improved.<br>
5) "L-H" organic dye recording film and<br>
reproduction signal modulation degree rule:<br>
A high C/N ratio relating to a reproduction signal<br>
from a recording mark can be ensured, and reproduction<br>
reliability from the recording mark is improved.<br>
6) Light reflection factor range in "L-H" organic<br>
dye recording film and mirror section:<br>
A high C/N ratio relating to a reproduction signal<br>
from a system lead-in area SYLDI can be ensured and<br>
high reproduction reliability can be ensured.<br>
7) "L-H" organic dye recording film and light<br>
reflection factor range from unrecorded area at the<br>
time of on-track:<br>
A high C/N rate relating to a wobble detection<br>
signal in an unrecorded area can be ensured, and high<br>
reproduction reliability relevant to wobble address<br>
information can be ensured.<br>
8) "L-H" organic dye recording film and wobble<br>
detection signal amplitude range:<br>
A high C/N ratio relating to a wobble detection<br>
signal can be ensured, and high reproduction<br>
reliability relevant to wobble address information can<br>
be ensured.<br>

Chapter 0:Description of Relationship between Use<br>
Wavelength and the Present Embodiment<br>
As a write-once type optical disk obtained by<br>
using an organic dye material for a recording medium,<br>
there has been commercially available a CD-R disk using<br>
a recording/reproducing laser light source wavelength<br>
of 780 nm and a DVD-R disk using a<br>
recording/reproducing laser light beam wavelength of<br>
650 nm. Further, in a next-generation write-once type<br>
information storage medium having achieved high<br>
density, it is proposed that a laser light source<br>
wavelength for recording or reproducing, which is close<br>
to 405 nm (namely, in the range of 355 nm to 455 nm),<br>
is used in either of H format (Dl) and B format (D2) of<br>
FIG. 1 described later. In a write-once type<br>
information storage medium using an organic dye<br>
material, recording/reproducing characteristics<br>
sensitively changes due to a slight change of a light<br>
source wavelength. In principle, density is increased<br>
in inverse proportion to a square of a laser light<br>
source wavelength for recording/reproducing, and thus,<br>
it is desirable that a shorter laser light source<br>
wavelength be used for recording/reproducing. However,<br>
for the above described reason, an organic dye material<br>
utilized for a CD-R disk or a DVD-R disk cannot be used<br>
as a write-once type information storage medium for<br>
405 nm. Moreover, because 405 nm is close to an<br>
ultraviolet ray wavelength, there can easily occur a<br>
disadvantage that a recording material "which can be<br>
easily recorded with a light beam of 405 nm", is easily<br>
changed in characteristics due to ultraviolet ray<br>
irradiation, lacking a long period stability.<br>
Characteristics are significantly different from each<br>
other depending on organic dye materials to be used,<br>
and thus, it is difficult to determine the<br>
characteristics of these dye materials in general. As<br>
an example, the foregoing characteristics will be<br>
described by way of a specific wavelength. With<br>
respect to an organic dye recording material optimized<br>
with a light beam of 650 nm in wavelength, the light to<br>
be used becomes shorter than 620 nm,<br>
recording/reproducing characteristics significantly<br>
change. Therefore, in the case where a<br>
recording/reproducing operation is carried out with a<br>
light beam which is shorter than 620 nm in wavelength,<br>
there is a need for new development of an organic dye<br>
material which is optimal to a light source wavelength<br>
of recording light or reproducing light. An organic<br>
dye material of which recording can be easily carried<br>
out with a light beam shorter than 530 nm in wavelength<br>
easily causes characteristic degradation due to<br>
ultraviolet ray irradiation, lacking long period<br>
stability. In the present embodiment, a description<br>
will be given with respect to an embodiment relevant to<br>
an organic recording material suitable to use in close<br>
to 405 nm. Namely, a description will be given with<br>
respect to an embodiment relating to an organic<br>
recording material which can be stably used in the<br>
range of 355 nm to 455 nm in consideration of a<br>
fluctuation of a light emitting wavelength which<br>
depends on manufacturers of semiconductor laser light<br>
sources. That is, the scope of the present embodiment<br>
corresponds to a light beam which is adapted to a light<br>
source of 620 nm in wavelength, and desirably, which is<br>
shorter than 530 nm in wavelength (ranging from 355 nm<br>
to 455 nm in a definition in the narrowest range).<br>
In addition, the optical recording sensitivity due<br>
to light absorption spectra of an organic dye material<br>
is also influenced by a recording wavelength. An<br>
organic dye material suitable for long period stability<br>
is easily reduced in light absorbance relevant to a<br>
light beam which is shorter than 620 nm in wavelength.<br>
In particular, the light absorbance is significantly<br>
lowered with respect to a light beam which is shorter<br>
than 620 nm in wavelength, and in particular, is<br>
drastically reduced with respect to a light beam which<br>
is shorter than 530 nm in wavelength. Therefore, in<br>
the case where recording is carried out with a laser<br>
light beam ranging from 355 nm to 455 nm in wavelength,<br>
which is the severest condition, recording sensitivity<br>
is impaired because the light absorbance is low, and<br>
there is a need for a new design employing a new<br>
principle of recording as shown in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
The size of a focusing spot used for recording or<br>
reproducing application is reduced in proportion to a<br>
wavelength of a light beam to be used. Therefore, from<br>
only a standpoint of the focusing spot size, in the<br>
case where a wavelength is reduced to the above<br>
described value, an attempt is made to reduce a track<br>
pitch or channel bit length by a wavelength component<br>
with respect to a current DVD-R disk (use wavelength:<br>
650 ran) which is a conventional technique. However, as<br>
described later in "3-2-A] Scope requiring application<br>
of technique according to the present embodiment", as<br>
long as a principle of recording in a conventional<br>
write-once type information storage medium such as a<br>
DVD-R disk is used, there is a problem that a track<br>
pitch or a channel bit length cannot be reduced. A<br>
track pitch or a channel bit length can be reduced in<br>
proportion to the above described wavelength by<br>
utilizing a technique devised in the present embodiment<br>
described below.<br>
Chapter 1: Description of Combination of<br>
Constituent Elements of Information Storage Medium in<br>
the Present Embodiment<br>
In the present embodiment, there exists a great<br>
technical feature in that an organic recording medium<br>
material (organic dye material) adapted to a light<br>
source of 620 nm or less in wavelength has been<br>
devised. Such an organic recording medium (organic dye<br>
material) has a unique characteristic (Low to High<br>
characteristic) that a light reflection factor<br>
increases in a recording mark, which does not exist in<br>
a conventional CD-R disk or a DVD-R disk. Therefore, a<br>
technical feature of the present embodiment and a novel<br>
effect attained thereby occurs in a structure,<br>
dimensions, or format (information recording format)<br>
combination of the information storage medium which<br>
produces more effectively the characteristics of the<br>
organic recording material (organic dye materials)<br>
shown in the present embodiment. FIG. 1 shows a<br>
combination, which produces a new technical feature and<br>
advantageous effect in the present embodiment. That is<br>
the information storage medium in the present<br>
embodiment has the following constituent elements:<br>
A] an organic dye recording film;<br>
B] a pre-format (such as pre-groove<br>
shape/dimensions or pre-pit shape/dimensions);<br>
C] a wobble condition (such as wobble modulation<br>
method and wobble change shape, wobble amplitude, and<br>
wobble allocating method); and<br>
D] a format (such as format for recording data<br>
which is to be recorded or which has been recorded in<br>
advance in information storage medium).<br>
Specific embodiments of constituent elements<br>
correspond to the contents described in each column of<br>
FIG. 1. A technical feature and a unique advantageous<br>
effect of the present embodiment occur in combination<br>
of the specific embodiments of the constituent elements<br>
shown in FIG. 1. Hereinafter, a description will be<br>
given with respect to a combination state of individual<br>
embodiments at a stage of explaining the embodiments.<br>
With respect to constituent elements, which do not<br>
specify a combination, it denotes that the following<br>
characteristics are employed:<br>
A5) an arbitrary coating recording film;<br>
B3) an arbitrary groove shape and an arbitrary pit<br>
shape;<br>
C4) an arbitrary modulation system;<br>
C6) an arbitrary amplitude amount; and<br>
D4) an arbitrary recording method and a format in<br>
a write-once medium.<br>
Chapter 2: Description of Difference in<br>
reproduction signal between Phase Change Recording Film<br>
and Organic Dye Recording Film<br>
2-1) Difference in Principle of<br>
Recording/Recording Film and Difference in Basic<br>
Concept Relating to Generation of Reproduction Signal<br>
FIG. 2A shows a standard phase change recording<br>
film structure (mainly used for a rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium), and FIG. 2B shows a<br>
standard organic dye recording film structure (mainly<br>
used for a write-once type information storage medium)<br>
In the description of the present embodiment, a whole<br>
recording film structure excluding transparent<br>
substrates 2-1 and 2-2 shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B<br>
(including light reflection layers 4-1 and 4-2) is<br>
defined as a "recording film", and is discriminated<br>
from recording layers 3-1 and 3-2 in which a recording<br>
material is disposed. With respect to a recording<br>
material using a phase change, in general, an optical<br>
characteristic change amount in a recorded area (in a<br>
recording mark) and an unrecorded area (out of a<br>
recording mark) is small, and thus, there is employed<br>
an enhancement structure for enhancing a relative<br>
change rate of a reproduction signal. Therefore, in a<br>
phase change recording film structure, as shown in<br>
FIG. 2A, an undercoat intermediate layer 5 is disposed<br>
between the transparent substrate 2-1 and a phase<br>
change type recording layer 3-1, and an upper<br>
intermediate layer 6 is disposed between the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 and the phase change type<br>
recording layer 3-1. In the invention, as a material<br>
for the transparent substrates 2-1 and 2-2, there is<br>
employed a polycarbonate PC or an acrylic PMMA (poly<br>
methyl methacrylate) which is a transparent plastic<br>
material. A center wavelength of a laser light beam 7<br>
used in the present embodiment is 405 nm, and<br>
refractive index r\2i, 22  tne polycarbonate PC at<br>
this wavelength is close to 1.62. Standard refractive<br>
index ni and absorption coefficient ki in 405 nm at<br>
GeSbTe (germanium antimony tellurium) which is most<br>
generally used as a phase change type recording<br>
material are ni =? 1.5 and k-i =? 2.5 in a crystalline<br>
area, whereas they are ni = 2.5 and ki =? 1.8 in an<br>
amorphous area. Thus, a refractive index (in the<br>
amorphous area) of a phase change type recording medium<br>
is different from a refractive index of the transparent<br>
substrate 2-1, and reflection of a laser light beam 7<br>
on an interface between the layers is easily occurred<br>
in a phase change recording film structure. As<br>
described above, for the reasons why (1) a phase change<br>
recording film structure takes an enhancement<br>
structure; and (2) a refractive index difference<br>
between the layers is great or the like, a light<br>
reflection amount change at the time of reproduction<br>
from a recording mark recorded in a phase change<br>
recording film (a differential value of a light<br>
reflection amount from a recording mark and a light<br>
reflection amount from an unrecorded area) can be<br>
obtained as an interference result of multiple<br>
reflection light beams generated on an interface<br>
between the undercoat intermediate layer 5, the<br>
recording layer 3-1, the upper intermediate layer 6,<br>
and the light reflection layer 4-2. In FIG. 2A,<br>
although the laser light beam 7 is apparently reflected<br>
on an interface between the undercoat intermediate<br>
layer 5 and the recording layer 3-1, an interface<br>
between the recording layer 3-1 and the upper<br>
intermediate layer 6, and an interface between the<br>
upper intermediate layer 6 and the light reflection<br>
layer 4-2, in actuality, a reflection light amount<br>
change is obtained as an interference result between a<br>
plurality of multiple reflection light beams.<br>
In contrast, an organic dye recording film<br>
structure takes a very simple laminate structure made<br>
of an organic dye recording layer 3-2 and a light<br>
reflection layer 4-2. An information storage medium<br>
(optical disk) using this organic dye recording film is<br>
called a write-once type information storage medium,<br>
which enables only one time of recording. However,<br>
unlike a rewritable-type information storage medium<br>
using the phase change recording medium, this medium<br>
cannot carry out an erasing process or a rewriting<br>
process of information which has been recorded once. A<br>
refractive index at 405 nm of a general organic dye<br>
recording material is often close to n2  1-4 (n32 =<br>
1.4 to 1.9 in the refractive index range at 405 nm of a<br>
variety of organic dye recording materials) and an<br>
absorption coefficient is often close to k2  0-2<br>
0.1 to 0.2 in the absorption coefficient range<br>
at 405 nm of a variety of organic dye recording<br>
materials). Because a refractive index difference<br>
between the organic dye recording material and the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 is small, there hardly occurs<br>
a light reflection amount on an interface between the<br>
recording layer 3-2 and the transparent substrate 2-2.<br>
Therefore, an optical reproduction principle of an<br>
organic color recording film (reason why a reflection<br>
light amount change occurs) is not "multiple<br>
interference" in a phase change recording film, and a<br>
main factor is a "light amount loss (including<br>
interference) midway of an optical path with respect to<br>
the laser light beam 7 which comes back after being<br>
reflected in the light reflection layer 4-2". Specific<br>
reasons which cause a light amount loss midway of an<br>
optical path include an "interference phenomenon due to<br>
a phase difference partially caused in the laser light<br>
7" or an "optical absorption phenomenon in the<br>
recording layer 3-2". The light reflection factor of<br>
the organic dye recording film in an unrecorded area on<br>
a mirror surface on which a pre-groove or a pre-pit<br>
does not exist is featured to be simply obtained by a<br>
value obtained by subtracting an optical absorption<br>
amount when the recording layer 3-2 is passed from the<br>
light reflection factor of the laser light beam 7 in<br>
the light reflection layer 4-2. As described above,<br>
this film is different from a phase change recording<br>
film whose light reflection factor is obtained by<br>
calculation of "multiple interference".<br>
First, a description will be given with respect to<br>
a principle of recording, which is used in a current<br>
DVD-R disk as a conventional technique. In the current<br>
DVD-R disk, when a recording film is irradiated with<br>
the laser light beam 7, the recording layer 3-2 locally<br>
absorbs energy of the laser light beam 7, and becomes<br>
hot. If a specific temperature is exceeded, the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 is locally deformed.<br>
Although a mechanism, which induces deformation of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2, is different depending on<br>
manufacturers of DVD-R disks, it is said that this<br>
mechanism is caused by:<br>
1) local plastic deformation of the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 due to gasification energy of the<br>
recording layer 3-2; and<br>
2) transmission of a heat from the recording layer<br>
3-2 to the transparent substrate 2-2 and local plastic<br>
deformation of the transparent substrate 2-2 due to the<br>
heat.<br>
If the transparent substrate 2-2 is locally<br>
plastically deformed, there changes an optical distance<br>
of the laser light beam 7 reflected in the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 through the transparent substrate<br>
2-2, the laser light beam 7 coming back through the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 again. A phase difference<br>
occurs between the laser light beam 7 from a recording<br>
mark, the laser light beam coming back through a<br>
portion of the locally plastically deformed transparent<br>
substrate 2-2, and a laser light beam 7 from the<br>
periphery of the recording mark, the laser light beam<br>
coming back through a portion of a transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 which is not deformed, and thus, a light<br>
amount change of reflection light beam occurs due to<br>
interference between these light beams. In addition,<br>
in particular, in the case where the above described<br>
mechanism of (1) has occurred, a change of a<br>
substantial refractive index n^2 produced by cavitation<br>
of the inside of the recording mark in the recording<br>
layer 3-2 due to gasification (evaporation), or<br>
alternatively, a change of a refractive index n2<br>
produced due to thermal decomposition of an organic dye<br>
recording material in the recording mark, also<br>
contributes to the above described occurrence of a<br>
phase difference. In the current DVD-R disk, until the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 is locally deformed, there is<br>
a need for the recording layer 3-2 becoming hot (i.e.,<br>
at a gasification temperature of the recording layer<br>
3-2 in the above described mechanism of (1) or at an<br>
internal temperature of the recording layer 3-2<br>
required for plastically reforming the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 in the mechanism of (2)) or there is a<br>
need for a part of the recording layer 3-2 becoming hot<br>
in order to cause thermal decomposition or gasification<br>
(evaporation). In order to form a recording mark,<br>
there is a need for large amount of power of the laser<br>
light beam 7.<br>
In order to form the recording mark, there is a<br>
necessity that the recording layer 3-2 can absorb<br>
energy of the laser light beam 7 at a first stage. The<br>
light absorption spectra in the recording layer 3-2<br>
influence the recording sensitivity of an organic dye<br>
recording film. A principle of light absorption in an<br>
organic dye recording material which forms the<br>
recording layer 3-2 will be described with reference to<br>
(A3) of the present embodiment.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a specific structural formula of the<br>
specific contents "(A3) azo metal complex + Cu" of the<br>
constituent elements of the information storage medium<br>
shown in FIG. 1. A circular periphery area around a<br>
center metal M of the azo metal complex shown in FIG. 3<br>
is obtained as a light emitting area 8. When a laser<br>
light beam 7 passes through this light emitting area 8,<br>
local electrons in this light emitting area 8 resonate<br>
to an electric field change of the laser light beam 7,<br>
and absorbs energy of the laser light beam 7. A value<br>
converted to a wavelength of the laser light beam with<br>
respect to a frequency of an electric field change at<br>
which these local electrons resonate most and easily<br>
absorbs the energy is called a maximum absorption<br>
wavelength, and is represented by A,max. As a range of<br>
the light emitting area 8 (resonation range) as shown<br>
in FIG. 3 increases, the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
^max is shifted to the long wavelength side. In<br>
addition, in FIG. 3, the localization range of local<br>
electrons around the center metal M (how large the<br>
center metal M can attract the local electrons to the<br>
vicinity of the center) is changed by changing atoms of<br>
the center metal M, and the value of the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength A,max changes.<br>
Although it can be predicted that the light<br>
absorption spectra of the organic dye recording<br>
material in the case where there exists only one light<br>
emitting area 8 which is absolute 0 degree at a<br>
temperature and high in purity draws narrow linear<br>
spectra in close to a maximum absorption wavelength<br>
Xmax, the light absorption spectra of a general organic<br>
recording material including impurities at a normal<br>
temperature, and further, including a plurality of<br>
light absorption areas exhibit a wide light absorption<br>
characteristic with respect to a wavelength of a light<br>
beam around the maximum absorption wavelength X,max.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an example of light absorption<br>
spectra of an organic dye recording material used for a<br>
current DVD-R disk. In FIG. 4, a wavelength of a light<br>
beam to be irradiated with respect to an organic dye<br>
recording film formed by coating an organic dye<br>
recording material is taken on a horizontal axis, and<br>
absorbance obtained when an organic dye recording film<br>
is irradiated with a light beam having a respective<br>
wavelength is taken on a vertical axis. The absorbance<br>
used here is a value obtained by entering a laser light<br>
beam having incident intensity lo from the side of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 with respect to a state in<br>
which a write-once type information storage medium has<br>
been completed (or alternatively, a state in which the<br>
recording layer 3-2 has been merely formed on the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 (a state that precedes<br>
forming of the optical reflection layer 4-2 with<br>
respect to a structure of FIG. 2B)), and then,<br>
measuring reflected laser light intensity Ir (light<br>
intensity It of the laser light beam transmitted from<br>
the side of the recording layer 3-2). The absorbance<br>
Ar (At) is represented by:<br>
Ar = -Iog10(lr/Io) (A-l)<br>
Ar = -logio(It/Io) (A-2)<br>
Unless otherwise specified, although a description<br>
will be given assuming that the absorbance denotes<br>
absorbance Ar of a reflection shape expressed by<br>
formula (A-l), it is possible to define absorbance At<br>
of a transmission shape expressed by formula (A-2)<br>
without being limited thereto in the present<br>
embodiment. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, there<br>
exist a plurality of light absorption areas, each of<br>
which includes the light emitting area 8, and thus,<br>
there exist a plurality of positions at which the<br>
absorbance becomes maximal. In this case, there exist<br>
a plurality of maximum absorption wavelength Xmax when<br>
the absorbance takes a maximum value. A wavelength of<br>
the recording laser light in the current DVD-R disk is<br>
set to 650 nm. In the case where there exist a<br>
plurality of the maximum absorption wavelengths <br>
the present embodiment, a value of the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength ^max which is the closest to the<br>
wavelength of the recording laser light beam becomes<br>
important. Therefore, only in the description of the<br>
present embodiment, the value of the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength A,max set at a position which is the closest<br>
to the wavelength of the recording laser light beam is<br>
defined as "A,max write"; and is discriminated from<br>
another Xmax (Xmax 0)•<br>
2-2) Difference of light reflection layer shape in<br>
pre-pit/pre-groove area<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B each show a comparison in shape<br>
when a recording film is formed in a pre-pit area or a<br>
pre-groove area 10. FIG. 5A shows a shape relevant to<br>
a phase change recording film. In the case of forming<br>
any of the undercoat intermediate layer 5, the<br>
recording layer 3-1, the upper intermediate layer 6,<br>
and the light reflection layer 4-1 as well, any of<br>
methods of sputtering vapor deposition, vacuum vapor<br>
deposition, or ion plating is used in vacuum. As a<br>
result, in all of the layers, irregularities of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-1 are duplicated comparatively<br>
faithfully. For example, in the case where a sectional<br>
shape in the pre-pit area or pre-groove area 10 of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-1 is rectangular or<br>
trapezoidal, the sectional shape of the recording layer<br>
3-1 and the light reflection layer 4-1 each is also<br>
rectangular or trapezoidal.<br>
FIG. 5B shows a general recording film sectional<br>
shape of a current DVD-R disk which is a conventional<br>
technique as a recording film in the case where an<br>
organic dye recording film has been used. In this<br>
case, as a method for forming the recording film 3-2,<br>
there is used a method called spin coating (or spinner<br>
coating) which is completely different from that shown<br>
in FIG. 5A. The spin coating used here denotes a<br>
method for dissolving in an organic solvent an organic<br>
dye recording material which forms the recording layer<br>
3-2; applying a coating onto the transparent substrate<br>
2-2; followed by rotating the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
at a high speed to spread a coating agent to the outer<br>
periphery side of the transparent substrate 2-2 by a<br>
centrifugal force; and gasifying the organic solvent,<br>
thereby forming the recording layer 3-2. Using this<br>
method, a process for coating the organic solvent is<br>
used, and thus, a surface of the recording layer 3-2<br>
(an interface with the light reflection layer 2-2) is<br>
easily flattened. As a result, the sectional shape on<br>
the interface between the light reflection layer 2-2<br>
and the recording layer 3-2 is obtained as a shape<br>
which is different from the shape of the surface of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 (an interface between the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 and the recording layer 3-2).<br>
For example, in a pre-groove area in which the<br>
sectional shape of the surface of the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 (an interface between the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 and the recording layer 3-2) is<br>
rectangular or trapezoidal, the sectional shape on the<br>
interface between the light reflection layer 2-2 and<br>
the recording layer 3-2 is formed in a substantially<br>
V-shaped groove shape. In a pre-pit area, the above<br>
sectional shape is formed in a substantially conical<br>
side surface shape. Further, at the time of spin<br>
coating, an organic solvent is easily collected at a<br>
recessed portion, and thus, the thickness Dg of the<br>
recording layer 3-2 in the pre-pit area or pre-groove<br>
area 10 (i.e., a distance from a bottom surface of the<br>
pre-pit area or pre-groove area to a position at which<br>
an interface relevant to the light reflection layer 2-2<br>
becomes the lowest) is larger than the thickness Dl in<br>
a land area 12 (Dg  Dl). As a result, an amount of<br>
irregularities on an interface between the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 and the recording area 3-2 in the pre-pit<br>
area or pre-groove area 10 becomes substantially<br>
smaller than an amount of irregularities on the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 and the recording layer 3-2.<br>
As described above, the shape of irregularities on<br>
the interface between the light reflection layer 2-2<br>
and the recording layer 3-2 becomes blunt and an amount<br>
of irregularities becomes significantly small. Thus,<br>
in the case where the shape and dimensions of<br>
irregularities on a surface of the transparent<br>
substrate 2 (pre-pit area or pre-groove area 10) are<br>
equal to each other depending on a difference in method<br>
for forming a recording film, the diffraction intensity<br>
of the reflection light beam from the organic dye<br>
recording film at the time of laser light irradiation<br>
is degraded more significantly than the diffraction<br>
intensity of the reflection light beam from the phase<br>
change recording film. As a result, in the case where<br>
the shape and dimensions of irregularities on the<br>
surface of the transparent substrate 2 (pre-pit area or<br>
pre-groove area 10) are equal to each other, as<br>
compared with use of the phase change recording film,<br>
use of the conventional organic dye recording film is<br>
disadvantageously featured in that:<br>
1) a degree of modulation of a light reproduction<br>
signal from the pre-pit area is small, and signal<br>
reproduction reliability from the pre-pit area is poor;<br>
2) a sufficiently large track shift detecting<br>
signal is hardly obtained in accordance with a pushpull<br>
technique from the pre-groove area; and<br>
3) a sufficient large wobble detecting signal is<br>
hardly obtained in the case where wobbling occurs in<br>
the pre-groove area.<br>
In addition, in a DVD-R disk, specific information<br>
such as address information is recorded in a small<br>
irregular (pit) shape in a land area, and thus, a width<br>
Wl of the land area 12 is larger than a width Wg of the<br>
pre-pit area or pre-groove area 10 (Wg  Wl).<br>
Chapter 3: Description of Characteristics of<br>
Organic Dye Recording Film in the Present Embodiment<br>
3-1) Problem(s) relevant to achievement of high<br>
density in write-once type recording film (DVD-R) using<br>
conventional organic dye material<br>
As has been described in "2-1) Difference in<br>
recording principle/recording film structure and<br>
difference in basic concept relating to generation of<br>
reproducing signal", a general principle of recording<br>
of a current DVD-R and CD-R, which is a write-once type<br>
information storage medium using a conventional organic<br>
dye material includes "local plastic deformation of<br>
transparent substrate 2-2" or "local thermal<br>
decomposition or "gasification" in recording layer<br>
3-2". FIGS. 6A and 6B each show a plastic deformation<br>
state of a specific transparent substrate 2-2 at a<br>
position of a recording mark 9 in a write-once type<br>
information storage medium using a conventional organic<br>
dye material. There exist two types of typical plastic<br>
deformation states. There are two cases, i.e., a case<br>
in which, as shown in FIG. 6A, a depth of a bottom<br>
surface 14 of a pre-groove area at the position of the<br>
recording mark 9 (an amount of step relevant to an<br>
adjacent land area 12) is different from a depth of a<br>
bottom surface of a pre-groove area 11 in an unrecorded<br>
area (in the example shown in FIG. 6A, the depth of the<br>
bottom surface 14 in the pre-groove area at the<br>
position of the recording mark 9 is shallower than that<br>
in the unrecorded area); and a case in which, as shown<br>
in FIG. 6B, a bottom surface 14 in a pre-groove area at<br>
the position of the recording mark 9 is distorted and<br>
is slightly curved (the flatness of the bottom surface<br>
14 is distorted: In the example shown in FIG. 6B, the<br>
bottom surface 14 in the pre-groove area at the<br>
position of the recording mark 9 is slightly curved<br>
toward the lower side). Both of these cases are<br>
featured in that a plastic deformation range of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 at the position of the<br>
recording mark 9 covers a wide range. In the current<br>
DVD-R disk which is a conventional technique, a track<br>
pitch is 0.74 jam, and a channel bit length is 0.133 )im.<br>
In the case of a large value of this degree, even if<br>
the plastic deformation range of the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 at the position of the recording mark 9<br>
covers a wide range, comparatively stable recording and<br>
reproducing processes can be carried out.<br>
However, if the track pitch is narrower than<br>
0.74 fj,m described above, the plastic deformation range<br>
of the transparent substrate 2-2 at the position of the<br>
recording mark 9 covers a wide range, and thus, the<br>
adjacent tracks are adversely affected, and the<br>
recording mark 9 of the existing adjacent track is<br>
substantially erased (cannot be reproduced) due to a<br>
"cross-write" or overwrite in which the recording mark<br>
9 widens to the adjacent tracks. In addition, in a<br>
direction (circumferential direction) along the tracks,<br>
if the channel bit length is narrower than 0.133 (im,<br>
there occurs a problem that inter-code interference<br>
appears; an error rate at the time of reproduction<br>
significantly increases; and the reliability of<br>
reproduction is lowered.<br>
3-2) Description of basic characteristics common<br>
to organic dye recording film in the present embodiment<br>
3-2-A] Range requiring application of technique<br>
according to the present embodiment<br>
As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, in a conventional<br>
write-once type information storage medium including<br>
plastic deformation of the transparent substrate 2-2 or<br>
local thermal decomposition or gasification phenomenon<br>
in the recording film 3-2, a description will be given<br>
below with respect to what degree of track pitch is<br>
narrowed when an adverse affect appears or what degree<br>
of channel pit length is narrowed when an adverse<br>
effect appears and a result obtained after technical<br>
discussion has been carried out with respect to a<br>
reason for such an adverse effect. A range in which an<br>
adverse effect starts appearing in the case of<br>
utilizing the conventional principle of recording<br>
indicates a range (suitable for the achievement of high<br>
density) in which advantageous effect is attained due<br>
to a novel principle of recording shown in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
1) Condition of thickness Dg of recording<br>
layer 3-2<br>
When an attempt is made to carry out thermal<br>
analysis in order to theoretically identify a lower<br>
limit value of an allowable channel bit length or a<br>
lower limit value of allowable track pitch, a range of<br>
the thickness Dg of a recording layer 3-2 which can be<br>
substantially thermally analyzed becomes important. In<br>
a conventional write-once type information storage<br>
medium (CD-R or DVD-R) including plastic deformation of<br>
the transparent substrate 2-2 as shown in FIGS. 6A and<br>
6B, with respect to a change of light reflection amount<br>
in the case where an information reproduction focusing<br>
spot is provided in the recording mark 8 and in the<br>
case where the spot is in an unrecorded area of the<br>
recording layer 3-2, the largest factor is "an<br>
interference effect due to a difference in optical<br>
distance in the recording mark 9 and in unrecorded<br>
area". In addition, a difference in its optical<br>
difference is mainly caused by "a change of the<br>
thickness Dg of a physical recording layer 3-2 due to<br>
plastic deformation of the transparent substrate 2-2 (a<br>
physical distance from an interface between the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 and the recording layer 3-2<br>
to an interface between the recording layer 3-2 and a<br>
light reflection layer 4-2) and "a change of refractive<br>
index n32 °f the recording layer 3-2 in the recording<br>
mark 9". Therefore, in order to obtain a sufficient<br>
reproduction signal (change of light reflection amount)<br>
between the recording mark 9 and the unrecorded area,<br>
when a wavelength in vacuum of laser light beam is<br>
defined as X, it is necessary for the value of the<br>
thickness 3-2 in the unrecorded area has a size to some<br>
extent as compared with X/n32. If not, a difference<br>
(phase difference) in optical distance between the<br>
recording mark 9 and the unrecorded area does not<br>
appear, and light interference effect becomes small.<br>
In reality, a minimum condition:<br>
Dg  A./8n32 (1)<br>
must be met, and desirably, a condition that:<br>
Dg X/4n32 (2)<br>
At a time point of current discussion, the<br>
vicinity of A, = 405 nm is assumed. A value of<br>
refractive index n2 °f an organic dye recording<br>
material at 405 nm ranges from 1.3 to 2.0. Therefore,<br>
as a result of substituting n2 = 2.0 in formula (1),<br>
it is conditionally mandatory that a value of the<br>
thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 is:<br>
Dg 25 nm (3)<br>
Here, discussion is made with respect to a<br>
condition when an organic dye recording layer of a<br>
conventional write-once type information storage medium<br>
(CD-R or DVD-R) including plastic deformation of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 has been associated with a<br>
light beam of 405 nm. As described later, in the<br>
present embodiment, although a description is given<br>
with respect to a case in which plastic deformation of<br>
the transparent substrate 2-2 does not occur and a<br>
change of an absorption coefficient k2 is a main<br>
factor of a principle of recording, it is necessary to<br>
carry out track shift detection by using a DPD<br>
(Differential Phase Detection) technique from the<br>
recording mark 9, and thus, in reality, the change of<br>
the refractive index n32 is caused in the recording<br>
mark 9. Therefore, the condition for formula (3)<br>
becomes a condition, which should be met, in the<br>
present embodiment in which plastic deformation of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 does not occur.<br>
From another point of view as well, the range of<br>
the thickness Dg can be specified. In the case of a<br>
phase change recording film shown in FIG. 5A, when a<br>
refractive index of the transparent substrate is r\2i, a<br>
step amount between a pre-pit area and a land area is<br>
X/(8n2i) when the largest track shift detection signal<br>
is obtained by using a push-pull technique. However,<br>
in the case of an organic dye recording film shown in<br>
FIG. 5B, as described previously, the shape on an<br>
interface between the recording layer 3-2 and the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 becomes blunt, and a step amount<br>
becomes small. Thus, it is necessary to increase a<br>
step amount between a pre-pit area and a land area on<br>
the transparent substrate 2-2 more significantly than<br>
X/(8n22) For example, the refractive index at 405 nm<br>
in the case where polycarbonate has been used as a<br>
material for the transparent substrate 2-2 is<br>
n22  1-62, and thus, it is necessary to increase a<br>
step amount between the pre-pit area and the land area<br>
more significantly than 31 nm. In the case of using a<br>
spin coating technique, if the thickness Dg of the<br>
recording layer 3-2 in the pre-groove area is greater<br>
than a step amount between the pre-pit area and the<br>
land area on the transparent substrate 2-2, there is a<br>
danger that thickness Dl of the recording layer 3-2 in<br>
a land area 12 is eliminated. Therefore, from the<br>
above described discussion result, it is necessary to<br>
meet a condition that:<br>
Dg ^ 31 nm (4)<br>
The condition for formula (4) is also a condition,<br>
which should be met in the present embodiment in which<br>
plastic deformation of the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
does not occur. Although conditions for the lower<br>
limit values have been shown in formulas (3) and (4),<br>
the value Dg = 60 nm obtained by substituting n2 =<br>
1.8 for an equal sign portion in formula (2) has been<br>
utilized as the thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2<br>
used for thermal analysis.<br>
Then, assuming polycarbonate used as a standard<br>
material of the transparent substrate 2-2, 150°C which<br>
is a glass transition temperature of polycarbonate has<br>
been set as an estimate value of a thermal deformation<br>
temperature at the side of the transparent substrate<br>
2-2. For discussion using thermal analysis, a value of<br>
k32 = 0.1 to 0.2 has been assumed as a value of an<br>
absorption coefficient of the organic dye recording<br>
film 3-2 at 405 nm. Further, discussion has been made<br>
with respect to a case in which an NA value of a<br>
focusing objective lens and an incident light intensity<br>
distribution when an objective lens is passed is NA =<br>
60 and H format ((D1):NA = 0.65 in FIG. 1) and B format<br>
((D2):NA = 0.85 in FIG. 1) which is assumed condition<br>
in a conventional DVD-R format.<br>
2) Condition for lower limit value of channel bit<br>
length<br>
A check has been made for a lengthwise change in a<br>
direction along a track of an area reaching a thermal<br>
deformation temperature at the side of a transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 which comes into contact with a recording<br>
layer 3-2 when recording power has been changed.<br>
Discussion has been made with respect to a lower limit<br>
value of an allowable channel bit length considering a<br>
window margin at the time of reproduction. As a<br>
result, if the channel bit length is slightly lower<br>
than 105 nm, it is considered that a lengthwise change<br>
in a direction along a track in an area which reaches<br>
the thermal deformation temperature at the side of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 occurs according to the<br>
slight change of recording power, and a sufficient<br>
window margin cannot be obtained. On discussion of<br>
thermal analysis, an analogous tendency is shown in the<br>
case where the NA value is any one of 0.60, 0.65, and<br>
0.85. Although a focusing spot size is changed by<br>
changing the NA value, a possibility cause is believed<br>
to be that a thermal spreading range is wide (a<br>
gradient of a temperature distribution at the side of<br>
the transparent substrate 2-2 which comes into contact<br>
with the recording layer 3-2) is comparatively gentle).<br>
In the above thermal analysis, the temperature<br>
distribution at the side of the transparent substrate<br>
2-2 which comes into contact with the recording layer<br>
3-2 is discussed, and thus, an effect of the thickness<br>
Dg of the recording layer 3-2 does not appear.<br>
Further, in the case where a shape change of the<br>
transparent substrate 3-3 shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B<br>
occurs, a boundary position of a substrate deformation<br>
area blurs (is ambiguous), and thus, a window margin is<br>
lowered more significantly. When a sectional shape of<br>
an area in which the recording mark 9 is formed is<br>
observed by an electron microscope, it is believed that<br>
a blurring amount of the boundary position of the<br>
substrate deformation area increases as the value of<br>
the thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 increases.<br>
With respect to the effect of the thermal deformation<br>
area length due to the above recording power change, in<br>
consideration of the blurring of the boundary position<br>
of this substrate deformation area, it is considered<br>
necessary that the lower limit value of the channel bit<br>
length allowed for allocation of a sufficient window<br>
margin is in order of two times of the thickness Dg of<br>
the recording layer 3-2, and it is desirable that the<br>
lower limit value is greater than 120 nm.<br>
In the foregoing, a description has been<br>
principally given with respect to discussion using<br>
thermal analysis in the case where thermal deformation<br>
of the transparent substrate 2-2 occurs. There also<br>
exists a case in which plastic deformation of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 is very small as another<br>
orinciple of recording (mechanism of forming the<br>
recording mark 9) in a conventional write-once type<br>
information storage medium (CD-R or DVD-R) and thermal<br>
deformation or gasification (evaporation) of the<br>
organic dye recording material in the recording layer<br>
3-2 mainly occurs. Thus, an additional description<br>
rfill be given with respect to such a case. Although<br>
the gasification (evaporation) temperature of the<br>
organic dye recording material is different depending<br>
on the type of the organic dye material, in general,<br>
the temperature ranges 220°C to 370°C, and a thermal<br>
decomposition temperature is lower than this range.<br>
Although a glass transition temperature 150°C of a<br>
polycarbonate resin has been presumed as an arrival<br>
temperature at the time of substrate deformation in the<br>
above discussion, a temperature difference between<br>
150°C and 220°C is small, and, when the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 reaches 150°C, the inside of the<br>
recording layer 3-2 exceeds 220°C. Therefore, although<br>
there exists an exception depending on the type of the<br>
organic recording material, even in the case where<br>
plastic deformation of the transparent substrate 2-2 is<br>
very small and thermal decomposition or gasification<br>
(evaporation) of the organic dye recording material in<br>
the recording layer mainly occurs, there is obtained a<br>
result which is substantially identical to the above<br>
discussion result.<br>
When the discussion result relating to the above<br>
channel bit length is summarized, in the conventional<br>
write-once type information storage medium (CD-R or<br>
DVD-R) including plastic deformation of the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2, it is considered that, when a channel<br>
bit length is narrower than 120 nm, the lowering of a<br>
window margin occurs, and further, if the length is<br>
smaller than 105 nm, stable reproduction becomes<br>
difficult. That is, when the channel bit is smaller<br>
than 120 nm (105 nm), advantageous effect is attained<br>
by using a novel principle of recording shown in the<br>
present embodiment.<br>
3) Condition for lower limit value of track<br>
pitches<br>
When a recording layer 3-2 is exposed at recording<br>
power, energy is absorbed in the recording layer 3-2,<br>
and a high temperature is obtained. In a conventional<br>
write-once type information storage medium (CD-R or<br>
DVD-R), it is necessary to absorb energy in the<br>
recording layer 3-2 until the transparent substrate 3-2<br>
has reached a thermal deformation temperature. A<br>
temperature at which a structural change of the organic<br>
dye recording material occurs in the recording layer<br>
3-2 and a value of a refractive index r\2 or an<br>
absorption coefficient k^2 starts its change is much<br>
lower than an arrival temperature for the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 to start thermal deformation. Therefore,<br>
the value of the refractive index 1132 or absorption<br>
coefficient k^2 changes in a comparatively wide range<br>
in the recording layer 3-2 at the periphery of a<br>
recording mark 9, which is thermal deformed at the side<br>
of the transparent substrate 2-2, and this change seems<br>
to cause "cross-write" or "cross-erase" for the<br>
adjacent tracks. It is possible to set a lower limit<br>
value of track pitch in which "cross-write" or "crosserase"<br>
does not occur with the width of an area which<br>
reaches a temperature which changes the refractive<br>
index n^2 or absorption coefficient k^2 i-n the<br>
recording layer 3-2 when the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
exceeds a thermal deformation temperature. From the<br>
above point of view, it is considered that "crosswrite"<br>
or "cross-erase" occurs in location in which the<br>
track pitch is equal to or smaller than 500 ran.<br>
Further, in consideration of an effect of warping or<br>
inclination of an information storage medium or a<br>
change of recording power (recording power margin), it<br>
can be concluded difficult to set the track pitch to<br>
600 nm or less in the conventional write-once type<br>
information storage medium (CD-R or DVD-R) in which<br>
energy is absorbed in the recording layer 3-2 until the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 has reached a thermal<br>
deformation temperature.<br>
As described above, even if the NA value is<br>
changed from 0.60, 0.65, and then, to 0.85,<br>
substantially similar tendency is shown because the<br>
gradient of the temperature distribution in the<br>
peripheral recording layer 3-2 when the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 has reached a thermal deformation<br>
temperature at a center part is comparatively gentle,<br>
and the thermal spread range is wide. In the case<br>
where plastic deformation of the transparent substrate<br>
2-2 is very small and thermal decomposition or<br>
gasification (evaporation) of the organic dye recording<br>
material in the recording layer 3-2 mainly occurs as<br>
another principle of recording (mechanism of forming<br>
the recording mark 9) in the conventional write-once<br>
type information storage medium (CD-R or DVD-R), as has<br>
been described in the section "(2) Condition for lower<br>
limit value of channel bit", the value of track pitch<br>
at which "cross-write" or "cross-erase" starts is<br>
obtained as a substantially analogous result. For the<br>
above described reason, advantageous effect is attained<br>
by using a novel principle of recording shown in the<br>
present embodiment when the track pitch is set to<br>
600 nm (500 nm) or lower.<br>
3-2-B] Basic characteristics common to organic dye<br>
recording material in the invention<br>
As described above, in the case where plastic<br>
deformation of the transparent substrate 2-2 is very<br>
small and thermal decomposition or gasification<br>
(evaporation) of the organic dye recording material in<br>
the recording layer 3-2 mainly occurs as another<br>
principle of recording (mechanism of forming the<br>
recording mark 9) in the conventional write-once type<br>
information storage medium (CD-R or DVD-R), there<br>
occurs a problem that a channel bit length or track<br>
pitches cannot be narrowed because the inside of the<br>
recording layer 3-2 or a surface of the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2 reaches a high temperature at the time of<br>
forming the recording mark 9. In order to solve the<br>
above described problem, the present embodiment is<br>
primarily featured in "inventive organic dye material"<br>
in which "a local optical characteristic change in the<br>
recording layer 3-2, which occurs at a comparatively<br>
low temperature, is a principle of recording" and<br>
"setting environment (recording film structure or<br>
shape) in which the above principle of recording easily<br>
occurs without causing a substrate deformation and<br>
gasification (evaporation) in the recording layer 3-2.<br>
Specific characteristics of the present embodiment can<br>
be listed below.<br>
a] Optical characteristic changing method inside<br>
of recording layer 3-2<br>
Chromogenic characteristic change<br>
Change of light absorption sectional area due<br>
to qualitative change of light emitting area 8 (FIG. 3)<br>
or change of molar molecule light absorption<br>
coefficient<br>
The light emitting area 8 is partially destroyed<br>
or the size of the light emitting area 8 changes,<br>
whereby a substantial light absorption sectional area<br>
changes. In this manner, an amplitude (absorbance) at<br>
a position of changes in the recording mark<br>
9 while a profile (characteristics) of light absorption<br>
spectra (FIG. 4) itself is maintained.<br>
Change of electronic structure (electron orbit)<br>
relevant to electrons which contribute to a chromogenic<br>
phenomenon<br>
Change of light absorption spectra (FIG. 4)<br>
based on discoloring action due to cutting of local<br>
electron orbit (dissociation of local molecular<br>
bonding) or change of dimensions or structure of light<br>
emitting area 8 (FIG. 3)<br>
Intra-molecular (inter-molecular) change of<br>
orientation or array<br>
Optical characteristic change based on<br>
orientation change in azo metal complex shown in<br>
FIG. 3, for example<br>
Molecular structure change in molecule<br>
For example, discussion is made with respect<br>
to an organic dye material which causes either of<br>
dissociation between anion portion and cation portion,<br>
thermal decomposition of either of anion portion and<br>
cation portion, and a tar phenomenon that a molecular<br>
structure itself is destroyed, and carbon atoms are<br>
precipitated (denaturing to black coal tar). As a<br>
result, the refractive index n^2 or absorption<br>
coefficient k^2 in the recording mark 9 is changed with<br>
respect to an unrecorded area, enabling optical<br>
reproduction.<br>
P] Setting recording film structure or shape,<br>
making it easy to stably cause an optical<br>
characteristic change of [a] above:<br>
The specific contents relating to this<br>
technique will be described in detail in the section<br>
"3-2-C] Ideal recording film structure which makes it<br>
easy to cause a principle of recording shown in the<br>
present embodiment" and subsequent.<br>
y] Recording power is reduced in order to form<br>
recording mark in a state in which inside of recording<br>
layer or transparent substrate surface is comparatively<br>
low at temperature<br>
The optical characteristic change shown in [a]<br>
above occurs at a temperature lower than a deformation<br>
temperature of the transparent substrate 2-2 or a<br>
gasification (evaporation) temperature in the recording<br>
layer 3-2. Thus, the exposure amount (recording power)<br>
at the time of recording is reduced to prevent the<br>
deformation temperature from being exceeded on the<br>
surface of the transparent substrate 2-2 or the<br>
gasification (evaporation) temperature from being<br>
exceeded in the recording layer 3-2. The contents will<br>
be described later in detail in the section "3-3)<br>
Recording characteristics common to organic dye<br>
recording layer in the present embodiment". In<br>
addition, in contrast, it becomes possible to determine<br>
whether or not the optical characteristic change shown<br>
in [a] above occurs by checking a value of the optimal<br>
power at the time of recording.<br>
8] Electron structure in a light emitting area is<br>
stabilized, and structural decomposition relevant to<br>
ultraviolet ray or reproduction light irradiation is<br>
hardly generated<br>
When ultraviolet ray is irradiated to the<br>
recording layer 3-2 or reproduction light is irradiated<br>
to the recording layer 3-2 at the time of reproduction,<br>
a temperature size in the recording layer 3-2 occurs.<br>
There is a request for a seemingly contradictory<br>
performance that characteristic degradation relevant to<br>
such a temperature rise is prevented and recording is<br>
carried out at a temperature lower than a substrate<br>
deformation temperature or a gasification (evaporation)<br>
temperature in the recording layer 3-2. In the present<br>
embodiment, the above described seemingly contradictory<br>
performance is ensured by "stabilizing an electron<br>
structure in a light emitting area". The specific<br>
technical contents will be described in "Chapter 4<br>
Specific Description of Embodiments of Organic Dye<br>
Recording Film in the Present Embodiment".<br>
e] Reliability of reproduction information is<br>
improved for a case in which reproduction signal<br>
degradation due to ultraviolet ray or reproduction<br>
light irradiation occurs<br>
In the present embodiment, although a<br>
technical contrivance is made for "stabilizing an<br>
electron structure in a light emitting area", the<br>
reliability of the recording mark 9 formed in a<br>
principle of recording shown in the present embodiment<br>
may be principally lowered as compared with a local<br>
cavity in the recording layer 3-2 generated due to<br>
plastic deformation or gasification (evaporation) of<br>
the surface of the transparent substrate 2-2. As<br>
countermeasures against it, in the present embodiment,<br>
advantageous effect that the high density and the<br>
reliability of recording information are achieved at<br>
the same time in combination with strong error<br>
correction capability (novel ECC block structure), as<br>
described later in "Chapter 7: Description of H Format"<br>
and "Chapter 8: Description of B Format". Further, in<br>
the present embodiment, PRML (Partial Response Maximum<br>
Likelihood) technique is employed as a reproduction<br>
method, as described in the section "4-2 Description of<br>
reproducing circuit in the present embodiment", the<br>
high density and the reliability of recording<br>
information are achieved at the same time in<br>
combination with an error correction technique at the<br>
time of ML demodulation.<br>
Among the specific characteristics of the above<br>
described present embodiment, a description has been<br>
given with respect to the fact that items [a] to [y]<br>
are the contents of technical contrivance newly devised<br>
in the present embodiment in order to achieve "narrow<br>
track pitch" and "narrow channel bit length". In<br>
addition, "narrow channel bit length" causes the<br>
achievement of "reduction of minimum recording mark<br>
length". The meanings (objects) of the present<br>
embodiment relating to the remaining items [8] and [e]<br>
will be described in detail. At the time of<br>
reproduction in the H format in the present embodiment,<br>
a passage speed (line speed) of a focusing spot of<br>
light passing through the recording layer 3-2 is set to<br>
6.61 m/s, and the line speed in the B format is set in<br>
the range of 5.0 m/s to 10.2 m/s.<br>
In any case, the line speed at the time of<br>
reproduction in the present embodiment is equal to or<br>
greater than 5 m/s. As shown in FIG. 31, a start<br>
position of a data lead-in area DTLDI in the H format<br>
is 47.6 mm in diameter. In view of the B format as<br>
well, user data is recorded in location equal to or<br>
greater than 45 mm in diameter. An inner periphery of<br>
45 mm in diameter is 0.141 m, and thus, the rotation<br>
frequency of an information storage medium when this<br>
position is reproduced at a line speed of 5 m/s is<br>
obtained as 35.4 rotations/s. Video image information<br>
such as TV program is provided as one of the methods<br>
utilizing a write-once type information storing medium<br>
according to the present embodiment. For example, when<br>
a user presses "pause (temporary stop) button" at the<br>
reproduction of the user's recorded video image, a<br>
reproduction focusing spot stays on a track of its<br>
paused position. When the spot stops on the track of<br>
the paused position, the user can start reproduction at<br>
the paused position immediately after a "reproduction<br>
start button" has been pressed. For example, after the<br>
user has pressed a "pause (temporary stop) button", in<br>
the case where a customer visits the user's home<br>
immediately after the user has gone to toilet, there is<br>
a case in which the pause button is left to have been<br>
pressed for one hour while the user meets the customer.<br>
The write-once type information storage medium makes<br>
35.4 x 60 x 60 ^ 130,000 rotations for one hour, and<br>
the focusing spot traces on the same track during this<br>
period (130,000 repetitive playbacks). If the<br>
recording layer 3-2 is degraded due to repetitive<br>
playback and video image information cannot be<br>
reproduced after this period, the user coming back one<br>
hour later cannot see any portion of video image, and<br>
thus, gets angry, and in the worst case, there is a<br>
danger that the problem may be taken to court.<br>
Therefore, a minimum condition that, if the recorded<br>
video image information is not destroyed even if such a<br>
pausing is left for one hour or longer (even if<br>
continuous playback in the same track occurs), no video<br>
image data is destroyed, requires to guarantee that at<br>
least 100,000 repetitive playback occurs, no<br>
reproduction degradation occurs. There is a rare case<br>
in which a user repeats one-hour pausing (repetitive<br>
playback) 10 times with respect to the same location in<br>
a general use condition. Therefore, when it is<br>
guaranteed that the write-once type information storage<br>
medium according to the present embodiment desirably<br>
makes 1,000,000 repetitive playbacks, no problem occurs<br>
with use by the general user, and it is considered<br>
sufficient to set to about 1,000,000 times the upper<br>
limit value of the repetitive playback count as long as<br>
the recording layer 3-2 is not degraded. If the upper<br>
limit value of the repetitive playback count is set to<br>
a value which significantly exceeds 1,000,000 times,<br>
there occurs inconvenience that "recording sensitivity<br>
is lowered" or "medium price increases".<br>
In the case where the upper limit value of the<br>
above repetitive reproduction count is guaranteed, a<br>
reproduction power value becomes an important factor.<br>
In the present embodiment, recording power is defined<br>
in a range set in formulas (8) to (13). It is said<br>
that a semiconductor laser beam is featured in that<br>
continuous light irradiation is not stable in a value<br>
equal to or smaller than 1/80 of the maximum use power.<br>
Because the power, which is 1/80 of the maximum use<br>
power, is in location in which light irradiation is<br>
just started (mode initiation is started), mode hopping<br>
is likely to occur. Therefore, at this light<br>
irradiation power, the light reflected in the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 of the information storage medium<br>
comes back to a semiconductor laser light source, there<br>
occurs a "return light noise" featured in that the<br>
light emission amount always changes. Accordingly, in<br>
the present embodiment, the values of the reproduction<br>
power is set below around the value which is 1/80 of<br>
the value described at the right side of formula (12)<br>
or formula (13):<br>
[Optical reproduction power]<br>
0.19 x (0.65/NA)2 x (V/6.6) (B-l)<br>
[Optical reproduction power]<br>
0.19 x (0.65/NA)2 x (V/6.6)1-2 (B-2)<br>
In addition, the value of the optimal reproduction<br>
power is restricted by a dynamic range of a power<br>
monitoring optical detector. Although not shown in an<br>
information recording/reproducing unit 141 of FIG. 11,<br>
a recording/reproducing optical head exists. This<br>
optical head incorporates an optical detector which<br>
monitors a light emission amount of a semiconductor<br>
laser light source. In the present embodiment, in<br>
order to improve light irradiation precision of the<br>
reproduction power at the time of reproduction, this<br>
optical detector detects a light emission amount and<br>
applies a feedback to an amount of a current to be<br>
supplied to the semiconductor laser light source at the<br>
time of light irradiation. In order to lower a price<br>
of the optical head, it is necessary to use a very<br>
inexpensive optical detector. A commercially<br>
available, inexpensive optical detector is often molded<br>
with a resin (an optical detecting unit is surrounded).<br>
As disclosed in "Chapter 0: Description of<br>
Relationship between Use Wavelength and the Present<br>
Embodiment", 530 nm or less (in particular, 455 nm or<br>
less) is used as a light source wavelength in the<br>
present embodiment. In the case of this wavelength<br>
area, a resin with which the optical detecting unit is<br>
molded (mainly, epoxy resin) causes such a degradation<br>
that occurs when ultraviolet ray has been irradiated if<br>
the wavelength light is irradiated (such as dark yellow<br>
discoloring or occurrence of cracks (fine white<br>
stripes)) and the optical detection characteristics are<br>
impaired. In particular, in the case of the write-once<br>
type information storage medium shown in the present<br>
embodiment, a mold resin degradation is likely to occur<br>
because the storage medium has a pre-groove area 11 as<br>
shown in FIGS. 8A, 8B and 8C. As a focus blurring<br>
detection system of an optical head, in order to remove<br>
adverse effect due to the diffraction light from this<br>
pre-groove area 11, there is most often employed a<br>
"knife-edge technique" of allocating an optical<br>
detector at an image forming position relevant to the<br>
information storage medium (image forming magnification<br>
M is in order of 3 times to 10 times). When the<br>
optical detector is arranged at the image forming<br>
position, high optical density is irradiated onto a<br>
mold resin because light beams are focused on the<br>
optical detector, and resin degradation due to this<br>
light irradiation is likely to occur. This mold resin<br>
characteristic degradation mainly occurs due to a<br>
photon mode (optical action), and however, it is<br>
possible to predict an upper limit value of an<br>
allowable irradiation amount in comparison with a light<br>
emission amount in a thermal mode (thermal excitation).<br>
Assuming the worst case, let us assume an optical<br>
system in which an optical detector is arranged at an<br>
image forming position as an optical head.<br>
From the contents described in "(1) Condition for<br>
thickness Dg of recording layer 3-2" in "3-2-A] Range<br>
requiring application of technique according to the<br>
present embodiment", when an optimal characteristic<br>
change (thermal mode) occurs in the recording layer 3-2<br>
at the time of recording in the present embodiment, it<br>
is considered that a temperature temporarily rises in<br>
the range of 80°C to 150°C in the recording layer 3-2.<br>
In view of a room temperature of about 15°C, a<br>
temperature difference ranges from 65°C to<br>
135°C. Pulse light emissions occur at the time of<br>
recording, and continuous light emissions occur at the<br>
time of reproduction. At the time of reproduction, the<br>
temperature rises in the recording layer 3-2 and a<br>
temperature difference occurs. When an image<br>
forming magnification of a detecting system in the<br>
optical head is M, the optical density of the detected<br>
light focused on the optical detector is obtained as<br>
1/M2 of the optical density of convergence light<br>
irradiated on the recording layer 3-2, and thus, a<br>
temperature rise amount on the optical detector at the<br>
time of reproduction is obtained as ATreaci/M2 which is<br>
a rough estimate. In view of the fact that an upper<br>
limit value of optical density, which can be irradiated<br>
on the optical detector, is converted by the<br>
temperature rise amount, it is considered that the<br>
upper limit value is in order of iyi2  1°C. The<br>
image foaming magnification of the detecting system in<br>
the optical head M is in order of 3 times to 10 times<br>
in general, if the magnification M2 =.<br>
tentatively estimated, it is necessary to set<br>
reproduction power so as to obtain:<br>
ATread/ATwrite = 20 (B-3)<br>
Assuming that a duty ratio of recording pulses at<br>
the time of recording is estimated as 50%, the<br>
following is required:<br>
 [Optimal reproduction power]<br>
[Optimal recording power]710 (B-4)<br>
Therefore, in view of formulas (8) to (13)<br>
described later and the above formula (B-4), optimal<br>
reproduction power is assigned as follows:<br>
[Optimal reproduction power]<br>
[Optimal reproduction power]<br>
[Optimal reproduction power]<br>
[Optimal reproduction power]<br>
[Optimal reproduction power]<br>
[Optimal reproduction power]<br>
(Refer to "3-2-E] Basic characteristics relating<br>
to thickness distribution of recording layer in the<br>
present embodiment for definition of parameters".) For<br>
example, when NA = 0.65 and V = 6.6 m/s, the following<br>
is obtained:<br>
[Optimal reproduction power] 
[Optimal reproduction power] 
[Optimal reproduction power] 
In reality, the optical detector is fixed as<br>
compared with the fact the information storage medium<br>
rotates and relatively moves, and thus, in<br>
consideration of this fact, it is necessary to further<br>
set the optimal reproduction power to be in order of<br>
1/3 or less of the value obtained in the above formula.<br>
In the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the present embodiment, a value of the<br>
reproduction power is set to 0.4 mW.<br>
3-2-C] Ideal recording film structure in which a<br>
principle of recording shown in the present embodiment<br>
is easily generated<br>
A description will be given with respect to a<br>
method for "setting an environment" (recording film<br>
structure or shape) in which the above principle of<br>
recording is easily generated in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
As an environment in which an optical<br>
characteristic change inside of the above described<br>
recording layer 3-2 is likely to occur, the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that a technical contrivance<br>
is carried out in recording film structure or shape<br>
such as:<br>
"in an area for forming the recording mark 9, a<br>
critical temperature at which an optical characteristic<br>
change is likely to occur is exceeded, and at a center<br>
part of the recording mark 9, a gasification<br>
(evaporation) temperature is not exceeded, and a<br>
surface of a transparent substrate 2-2 in the vicinity<br>
of the center part of the recording mark 9 does not<br>
exceed a thermal temperature".<br>
The specific contents relating to the above<br>
description will be described with reference to<br>
FIGS. 7A, 7B and 7C. In FIGS. 7A, 7B and 1C, the open<br>
(blank) arrow indicates an optical path of an<br>
irradiation laser light beam 7, and the arrow of the<br>
dashed line indicates a thermal flow. A recording film<br>
structure shown in FIG. 7A indicates an environment in<br>
which an optical characteristic change inside of a<br>
recording layer 3-2 corresponding to the present<br>
embodiment is most likely to occur. That is, in<br>
FIG. 7A, the recording layer 3-2 consisting of an<br>
organic dye recording material has uniform thickness<br>
anywhere in the range shown in formula (3) or formula<br>
(4) (where the thickness is sufficiently large), and<br>
receives irradiation of the laser light beam 7 in a<br>
direction vertical to the recording layer 3-2. As<br>
described in detail in "6-1) light reflection layer<br>
(material and thickness)", a silver alloy is used as a<br>
material for a light reflection layer 4-2 in the<br>
present embodiment. A material including a metal with<br>
high light reflection factor, in general, has high<br>
thermal conductivity and heat radiation characteristics<br>
without being limited to the silver alloy. Therefore,<br>
although a temperature of the recording layer 3-2 is<br>
risen by absorbing the energy of the irradiated laser<br>
light beam 7, a heat is radiated toward the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 having heat radiation<br>
characteristics. Although a recording film shown in<br>
FIG. 7A is formed anywhere in a uniform shape, a<br>
comparatively uniform temperature rise occurs inside of<br>
the recording layer 3-2, and a temperature difference<br>
at points a, P, and y at the center part is<br>
comparatively small. Therefore, when the recording<br>
mark 9 is formed, when a critical temperature at which<br>
an optical characteristic change at the points a and P<br>
occurs is exceeded, a gasification (evaporation)<br>
temperature is not exceeded at the point a of the<br>
center part; and a surface of a transparent substrate<br>
(not shown) which exists at a position which is the<br>
closest to the point a of the center part does not<br>
exceed a thermal deformation temperature.<br>
In comparison, as shown in FIG. 7B, a step is<br>
provided partly of the recording film 3-2. At the<br>
points 5 and e, the radiation of the laser light beam 7<br>
is subjected in a direction oblique to a direction in<br>
which the recording layer 3-2 is arrayed, and thus, an<br>
irradiation amount of the laser light beam 7 per a unit<br>
area is relatively lowered as compared with the point cc<br>
of the center part. As a result, a temperature rise<br>
amount in the recording layer 3-2 at the points 8 and e<br>
is lowered. At the points 8 and E as well, thermal<br>
radiation toward the light reflection layer 4-2 occurs,<br>
and thus, the arrival temperature at the points 8 and s<br>
is sufficiently lowered as compared with the point a of<br>
the center part. Therefore, a heat flows from the<br>
point P to the point a and a heat flows from the point<br>
a to the point P, and thus, a temperature difference at<br>
the points P and y relevant to the point a of the<br>
center part becomes very small. At the time of<br>
recording, a temperature rise amount at the points P<br>
and y is low, and a critical temperature at which an<br>
optical characteristic change occurs is hardly exceeded<br>
at the points p and a. As countermeasures against it,<br>
in order to produce an optical characteristic change<br>
occurs at the points P and y (in order to produce a<br>
critical temperature or more), it is necessary to<br>
increase an exposure amount (recording power) of the<br>
laser light beam 7. In the recording film structure<br>
shown in FIG. 7B, a temperature difference at the point<br>
a of the center part relevant to the points P and y is<br>
very large. Thus, when a current temperature has risen<br>
at a temperature at which an optical characteristic<br>
change occurs at the points P and y, a gasification<br>
(evaporation) temperature is exceeded at the point a of<br>
the center part or the surface of a transparent<br>
substrate (not shown) in the vicinity of the point a of<br>
the center part hardly exceeds a thermal deformation<br>
temperature.<br>
In addition, even if the surface of the recording<br>
layer 3-2 at the side at which irradiation of the laser<br>
light beam 7 is subjected is vertical to the<br>
irradiation direction of the laser light beam 7<br>
anywhere, in the case where the thickness of the<br>
recording layer 3-2 changes depending on a location,<br>
there is provided a structure in which an optical<br>
characteristic change inside of the recording layer 3-2<br>
according to the present embodiment hardly occurs. For<br>
example, as shown in FIG. 7C, let us consider a case in<br>
which the thickness Dl of a peripheral part is<br>
significantly small with respect to the thickness Dg of<br>
the recording layer 3-2 at the point a of the center<br>
part (for example, formula (2) or formula (4) is not<br>
satisfied). Even at the point a of the center part,<br>
although heat radiation toward the light reflection<br>
layer 4-2 occurs, the thickness Dg of the recording<br>
layer 3-2 is sufficiently large, thus making it<br>
possible to achieve heat accumulation and to achieve a<br>
high temperature. In comparison, at the points 2, and rat which the thickness Dl is significantly small, a<br>
heat is radiated toward the light reflection layer 4-2<br>
without carrying out heat accumulation, and thus, a<br>
temperature rise amount is small. As a result, heat<br>
radiation toward points p, 8, and £, in order and heat<br>
radiation toward points y, e, and r| in order occurs as<br>
well as heat radiation toward the light reflection<br>
layer 4-2, and thus, as in FIG. 7B, a temperature<br>
difference at the point a of the center part relevant<br>
to points P and y becomes very large. When an exposure<br>
amount of the laser light beam 7 (recording power) is<br>
increased in order to produce an optical characteristic<br>
change at the points P and y (in order to produce a<br>
critical temperature or more), the gasification<br>
(evaporation) temperature at the point a of the center<br>
part is exceeded or the surface of the transparent<br>
substrate (not shown) in the vicinity of the point a of<br>
the center part easily exceeds a thermal deformation<br>
temperature.<br>
Based on the contents described above, referring<br>
to FIGS. 8A, 8B and 8C, a description will be given<br>
with respect to: the contents of a technical<br>
contrivance in the present embodiment relating to the<br>
pre-groove shape/dimensions for providing "setting of<br>
environment (structure or shape of a recording film)"<br>
in which a principle of recording according to the<br>
present embodiment is likely to occur; and the contents<br>
of a technical contrivance in the present embodiment<br>
relating to a thickness distribution of the recording<br>
layer. FIG. 8A shows a recording film structure in a<br>
conventional write-once type information storage medium<br>
such as CD-R or DVD-R; and FIGS. 8B and 8C each show a<br>
recording film structure in the present embodiment. In<br>
the invention, as shown in FIGS. 8A, 8B and 8C, a<br>
recording mark 9 is formed in a pre-groove area 11.<br>
3-2-D] Basic characteristics relating to pregroove<br>
shape/dimensions in the present embodiment<br>
As shown in FIG. 8A, there have been many cases in<br>
which a pre-groove area 11 is formed in a "V-groove"<br>
shape in a conventional write-once type information<br>
storage medium such as CD-R or DVD-R. In the case of<br>
this structure, as described in FIG. 7B, the energy<br>
absorption efficiency of the laser light beam 7 is low,<br>
and the temperature distribution non-uniformity in the<br>
recording layer 3-2 becomes very large. The present<br>
embodiment is featured in that, in order to make close<br>
to an ideal state of FIG. 7A, a planar shape orthogonal<br>
to a traveling direction of the incident laser light<br>
beam 7 is provided in the pre-groove area 11 at the<br>
side of at least the "transparent substrate 2-2". As<br>
described with reference to FIG. 7A, it is desirable<br>
that this planar area be as wide as possible.<br>
Therefore, the present embodiment is secondarily<br>
featured in that the planar area is provided in the<br>
pre-groove area 11 and the width Wg of the pre-groove<br>
area 11 is wider than the width Wl of a land area (Wg <br>
Wl). In this description, the width Wg of the pregroove<br>
area and the width Wl of the land area are<br>
defined as their respective widths at a position at<br>
which there crosses a plane having an intermediate<br>
height between a height at a planar position of the<br>
pre-groove area and a height at a position at which the<br>
land area becomes the highest and an oblique surface in<br>
the pre-groove.<br>
A discussion has been made using thermal analysis,<br>
data has been recorded in a write-once type information<br>
storage medium actually produced as a prototype,<br>
substrate deformation observation due to a sectional<br>
SEM (scanning type electronic microscope) image at the<br>
position of the recording mark 9 has been made, and<br>
observation of the presence or absence of a cavity<br>
generated due to gasification (evaporation) in the<br>
recording layer 3-2 has been repeated. As a result, it<br>
is found that advantageous effect is attained by<br>
widening the width Wg of the pre-groove area more<br>
significantly than the width Wl of the land area.<br>
Further, a ratio of the pre-groove area width Wg and<br>
the land area width Wl is Wg:Wl = 6:4, and desirably,<br>
is greater than Wg:Wl = 7:3, whereby it is considered<br>
that a local optical characteristic change in the<br>
recording layer 3-2 is likely to occur while the change<br>
is more stable at the time of recording. As described<br>
above, when a difference between the pre-groove area<br>
width Wg and the land area width Wl is increased, a<br>
flat surface is eliminated from the top of the land<br>
area 12, as shown in FIG. 8C. In the conventional DVDR<br>
disk, a pre-pit (land pre-pit: not shown) is formed<br>
in the land area 12, and a format for recording address<br>
information or the like in advance is realized here.<br>
Therefore, it is conditionally mandatory to form a flat<br>
area in the land area 12. As a result, there has been<br>
a case in which the pre-groove area 11 is formed in the<br>
"V-groove" shape. In addition, in the conventional<br>
CD-R disk, a wobble signal has been recorded in the<br>
pre-groove area 11 by means of frequency modulation.<br>
In a frequency modulation system in the conventional<br>
CD-R disk, slot gaps (a detailed description of each<br>
format is given in detail) are not constant, and phase<br>
adjustment at the time of wobble signal detection (PLL:<br>
synchronization of PLL (Phase Lock Loop)) has been<br>
comparatively difficult. Thus, a wall face of the<br>
pre-groove area 11 is concentrated (made close to the<br>
V-groove) in the vicinity of a center at which the<br>
intensity of a reproducing focusing spot is the highest<br>
and a wobble amplitude amount is increased, whereby the<br>
wobble signal detection precision has been guaranteed.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 8B and 8C, after the flat area in the<br>
pre-groove area 11 in the present embodiment has been<br>
widened, when the oblique surface of the pre-groove<br>
area 11 is shifted to the outside relatively than a<br>
center position of the reproducing focusing spot, a<br>
wobble detection signal is hardly obtained. The<br>
present embodiment is featured in that the width Wg of<br>
the pre-groove area described above is widened and the<br>
H format utilizing PSK (Phase Shift Keying) in which<br>
slot gaps at wobble detection is always fixedly<br>
maintained or the B format utilizing FSK (Frequency<br>
Shift Keying) or STW (Saw Tooth Wobble) are combined,<br>
whereby stable recording characteristics are guaranteed<br>
(suitable to high speed recording or layering) at low<br>
recording power and stable wobble signal detection<br>
characteristics are guaranteed. In particular, in the<br>
H format, in addition to the above combination, "a<br>
ratio of a wobble modulation is lowered more<br>
significantly than that of a non-modulation area",<br>
thereby facilitating synchronization at the time of<br>
wobble signal detection more significantly, and<br>
further, stabilizing wobble signal detection<br>
characteristics more significantly.<br>
3-2-E] Basic characteristics relating to thickness<br>
distribution of recording layer 3-2 in the present<br>
embodiment<br>
In the present description, as shown in FIGS. 8B<br>
and 8C, the thickness in a portion at which the<br>
recording layer 3-2 in the land area 12 is the thickest<br>
is defined as recording layer thickness Dl in the land<br>
area 12; and a portion at which the recording layer 3-2<br>
in the pre-groove area 11 is the thickest is defined as<br>
recording layer thickness Dg in the pre-groove area.<br>
As has been described with reference to FIG. 1C, the<br>
recording layer thickness Dl in the land area is<br>
relatively increased, whereby a local optical<br>
characteristic change in the recording layer is stably<br>
likely to occur at the time of recording.<br>
In the same manner as that described above, a<br>
discussion has been made using thermal analysis, data<br>
has been recorded in a write-once type information<br>
storage medium actually produced as a prototype,<br>
substrate deformation observation and observation of<br>
the presence or absence of a cavity generated due to<br>
gasification (evaporation) in the recording layer 3-2<br>
by a sectional SEM (scanning type electronic<br>
microscope) image at the position of the recording mark<br>
9 have been made. As a result, it has been found<br>
necessary to set a ratio between the recording layer<br>
thickness Dg in the pre-groove area and the recording<br>
layer thickness Dl in the land area to be equal to or<br>
smaller than Dg:Dl = 4:1. Further, Dg:Dl = 3:1 is set,<br>
and desirably, Dg:Dl = 2:1 is set, thereby making it<br>
possible to guarantee stability of a principle of<br>
recording in the present embodiment.<br>
3-3) Recording characteristics common to organic<br>
dye recording film in the present embodiment<br>
As one of "3-2-B] basic characteristics common to<br>
an organic dye recording material in the present<br>
embodiment", the present embodiment is featured by<br>
recording power control, as described in item [y] .<br>
The formation of the recording mark 9 due to a<br>
local optical characteristic change in the recording<br>
layer 3-2 occurs at a temperature, which is much lower<br>
than a plastic deformation temperature of the<br>
conventional transparent substrate 2-2, at a thermal<br>
decomposition temperature in the recording layer 3-2,<br>
or a gasification (evaporation) temperature. Thus, an<br>
upper limit value of recording power is restricted so<br>
as not ensure that the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
locally exceeds a plastic deformation temperature at<br>
the time of recording or a thermal decomposition<br>
temperature or a gasification (evaporation) temperature<br>
is locally exceeded in the recording layer 3-2.<br>
In parallel to discussion using thermal analysis,<br>
by using an apparatus described later in "4-1)<br>
Description of structure and characteristics of<br>
reproducing apparatus or recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus in the present embodiment" and by using a<br>
recording condition described later in "4-3)<br>
Description of recording condition in the present<br>
embodiment", there has been made a demonstration of a<br>
value of optimal power in the case where recording has<br>
been carried out in a principle of recording shown in<br>
the present embodiment. A numerical aperture (NA)<br>
value of an objective lens in the recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus used in a demonstration test has been 0.65,<br>
and a line speed at the time of recording has been<br>
6.61 m/s. As a value of recording power (Peak Power)<br>
defined later in "4-3) Description of recording<br>
condition in the present embodiment", it has been found<br>
that:<br>
• Gasification (evaporation) occurs with most of<br>
an organic dye recording material at 30 mW, and a<br>
cavity occurs in a recording mark;<br>
A temperature of the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
at a position in the vicinity of the recording layer 3-<br>
2 significantly exceeds a glass transition temperature;<br>
• A temperature of the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
at a position in the vicinity of the recording layer<br>
3-2 reaches a plastic deformation temperature (glass<br>
transition temperature) at 20 mW;<br>
• 15 mW or less is desirable in consideration of a<br>
margin such as surface pre-warping or recording power<br>
change of an information storage medium.<br>
The "recording power" described above denotes a<br>
sum of exposure amount irradiated to the recording<br>
layer 3-2. The optical energy density at a center part<br>
of a focusing spot and at a portion at which the<br>
optical intensity density is the highest is obtained as<br>
parameters targeted for discussion in the present<br>
embodiment. The focusing spot size is inversely<br>
proportional to the NA value, and thus, the optical<br>
energy density at the center part of the focusing spot<br>
increases in proportion to a square of the NA value.<br>
Therefore, the current value can be converted to a<br>
value of optimal recording power in the B format<br>
described later or another format (another NA value)<br>
shown in FIG. 1 (D3) by using a relational formula<br>
below:<br>
[Recording power applicable to different NA<br>
values]<br>
= [Recording power when NA = 0.65] x 0.652/NA2<br>
(5)<br>
Further, optimal recording power changes depending<br>
on a line speed V in phase change type recording<br>
material. In general, it is said that optimal<br>
recording power changes in proportion to a 1/2 square<br>
of a line speed V in phase change type recording<br>
material, and changes in proportion to a line speed V<br>
in organic dye recording material. Therefore, a<br>
conversion formula of optimal recording power<br>
considering a line speed V, obtained by extending<br>
formula (5), is obtained as follows:<br>
[General recording power]<br>
= [Recording power when NA = 0.65; 6.6 m/s] x<br>
(0.65/NA)2 x (V/6.6) (6)<br>
or<br>
[General recording power]<br>
= [Recording power when NA = 0.65; 6.6 m/s] x<br>
(0.65/NA)2 x (V/6.6)l/2 (7)<br>
When the above discussion result is summarized, as<br>
recording power for guaranteeing a principle of<br>
recording shown in the present embodiment, it is<br>
desirable to set an upper limit value such as:<br>
[Optimal recording power]<br>
[Optimal recording power]<br>
[Optimal recording power]<br>
[Optimal recording power]<br>
[Optimal recording power]<br>
[Optimal recording power]<br>
From among the above formulas, a condition for<br>
formula (8) or formula (9) is obtained as a mandatory<br>
condition; a target condition for formula (10) or<br>
formula (11) is obtained; and a condition for formula<br>
(12) or formula (13) is obtained as a desirable<br>
condition.<br>
3-4) Description of characteristics relating to<br>
"H-L" recording film in the present embodiment<br>
A recording film having characteristics that a<br>
light reflection amount in a recording mark 9 is lower<br>
than that in an unrecorded area is referred to as an<br>
"H-L" recording film. In contrast, a recording film in<br>
which the above light reflection amount is high is<br>
referred to as an "L-H" recording film. Among them,<br>
with respect to the "H-L" recording film, the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that:<br>
1) an upper limit value is provided at a ratio of<br>
absorbance at a reproduction wavelength relevant to<br>
absorbance at a Viax write position of light absorption<br>
spectra; and<br>
2) a light absorption spectra profile is changed<br>
to form a recording mark.<br>
A detailed description relating to the above<br>
contents will be given with reference to FIGS. 9 and<br>
10. In the "H-L" recording film in the present<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIG. 9, a wavelength of A.max<br>
write is shorter than a use wavelength utilized for<br>
recording/reproduction (in the vicinity of 405 nm). As<br>
is evident from FIG. 10, in the vicinity of a<br>
wavelength of A,max write' change of absorbance is<br>
small between an unrecorded portion and a recorded<br>
portion. If a change of absorbance is small between<br>
the unrecorded portion and the recorded portion, a<br>
large reproduction signal amplitude cannot be obtained.<br>
Even if a wavelength change of a recording or<br>
reproducing laser light source occurs, in view of the<br>
fact that recording or reproduction can be stably<br>
carried out, in the present embodiment, as shown in<br>
FIG. 9, a design of the recording film 3-2 is made so<br>
that a wavelength of A,max Write arrives at the outside<br>
ranging from 355 nm to 455 nm, i.e., arrives at the<br>
shorter wavelength side than 355 nm.<br>
The relative absorbance at 355 nm, 455 run, and<br>
405 nm described in "Chapter 0: Description of<br>
Relationship between Use Wavelength and the Present<br>
Embodiment" when the absorbance at a position of A,max<br>
write defined in "2-1) Difference in principle of<br>
recording/recording film structure and difference in<br>
basic concept relating to reproduction signal<br>
generation", is defined as Ah355, Ah455, and Ah4Q5.<br>
In the case where of Ah4Q5 = 0.0, the light<br>
reflection factor from a recording film in an<br>
unrecorded state coincides with that at 405 nm in the<br>
light reflection layer 4-2. A light reflection factor<br>
of the light reflection layer 4-2 will be described<br>
later in detail in the section "6-1) Light reflection<br>
layer". Hereinafter, a description will be given with<br>
respect to the fact that the light reflection factor of<br>
the light reflection layer 4-2 is defined as 100% for<br>
the sake of simplification.<br>
In the write-once type information storage medium<br>
using an "H-L" recording film in the present<br>
embodiment, a reproduction circuit is used in common to<br>
a case of using a read-only type information storage<br>
medium (HD DVD-ROM disk) in the case of a one-sided<br>
single layer film. Therefore, in this case, an optical<br>
reflection factor is defined as 45% to 85% in<br>
accordance with a light reflection factor of the<br>
reflection only information storage medium (HD DVD-ROM<br>
disk) of a one-sided single layer film. Therefore, it<br>
is necessary to set the light reflection factor at an<br>
unrecorded position to 40% or more. Because 1 - 0.4 =<br>
0.6, it is possible to intuitively understand whether<br>
or not the absorbance Ah4Q5 at 405 nm may be set:<br>
Ah405 
In the case where formula (14) above is met, it is<br>
possible to easily understand that the light reflection<br>
factor can be set to 40% or more. Thus, in the present<br>
embodiment, an organic dye recording material, which<br>
meets formula (14) in an unrecorded location, is<br>
selected. The above formula (14) assumes that, in<br>
FIG. 9, the light reflection factor is obtained as 0%<br>
when the light reflection layer 4-2 is reflected over<br>
the recording layer 3-2 with a light beam having a<br>
wavelength of A,max write- However, in reality, at this<br>
time, the light reflection factor is not obtained as<br>
0%, and has a certain degree of light reflection<br>
factor. Thus, strictly, there is a need for correction<br>
relevant to formula (14). In FIG. 9, if the light<br>
reflection factor is defined as RXmax write when the<br>
light reflection layer 4-2 has been reflected over the<br>
recording layer 3-2 with a light beam having a<br>
wavelength of A,max Write' a strict conditional formula<br>
in which the light reflection factor at an unrecorded<br>
position is set to 40% or more is obtained as follows:<br>
I - Ah405 x (1 - R^max write) ^ 0.4 (15)<br>
In the "H-L" recording layer, in many cases,<br>
write) - °-25, and thus, formula (15) is established as<br>
follows:<br>
Ah4o5  0.8 (16)<br>
In the "H-L" recording film according to the<br>
present embodiment, it is conditionally mandatory to<br>
meet formula (16). Characteristics of the above<br>
formula (14) has been provided, and further, a detailed<br>
optical film design has been made under a condition<br>
that the film thickness of the recording layer 3-2<br>
meets the condition for formula (3) or formula (4), in<br>
consideration of a variety of margins such as a film<br>
thickness change or a wavelength change of reproduction<br>
light. As a result, it has been found desirable that:<br>
Ah405 0.3 (17)<br>
Assuming that formula (14) is established, when:<br>
the recording/reproducing characteristics are more<br>
stable. This is because, in the case where formula<br>
(14) meets any of at least formulas (18) and (19) when<br>
formula (14) is established, the value of Ah becomes<br>
0.6 or less in the range of 355 nm to 405 nm or in the<br>
range of 405 nm to 455 nm (occasionally in the range of<br>
355 nm to 455 nm), and thus, even if a fluctuation<br>
occurs at a light emission wavelength of a recording<br>
laser light source (or a reproducing laser light<br>
source), a value of absorbance does not change<br>
drastically.<br>
As a specific principle of recording of the "H-L"<br>
recording film in the present embodiment, there is<br>
utilized a phenomenon of "array change between<br>
molecules" or "molecular structure change in molecule"<br>
in a recording mechanism listed in item [a] in "3-2-B]<br>
Basic featured common to organic dye recording material<br>
in the present embodiment" which has been described as<br>
a specific principle of recording of the "H-L"<br>
recording film in the present embodiment. As a result,<br>
as described in the above item (2), a light absorption<br>
spectrum profile is changed. The light absorption<br>
spectrum profile in a recording mark in the present<br>
embodiment is indicated by the solid line shown in<br>
FIG. 10, and the light absorption spectrum profile in<br>
an unrecorded location is superimposed by the dashed<br>
line, thereby making it possible to compare these<br>
profiles with each other. In the present embodiment,<br>
the light absorption spectrum profile in the recording<br>
mark changes comparatively broadly, and there is a<br>
possibility that a molecular structure change in<br>
molecules occurs and partial precipitation (coal tar)<br>
of carbon atoms occurs. The present embodiment is<br>
featured in that a value of a wavelength ^-Imax a^ which<br>
the absorbance in the recording mark becomes maximal is<br>
made closer to a reproduction wavelength of 405 nm than<br>
a value of a wavelength write at an unrecorded<br>
position, thereby generating a reproduction signal in<br>
the "H-L" recording film. In this manner, the<br>
absorbance at the wavelength A,lmax at which the<br>
absorbance is the highest becomes smaller than "1", and<br>
a value of the absorbance A14Q5 at a reproduction<br>
wavelength of 405 nm becomes greater than a value of<br>
Ah4Q5- As a result, a total light reflection factor in<br>
a recording mark is lowered.<br>
In the H format in the present embodiment, as a<br>
modulation system, there is employed ETM (Eight to<br>
Twelve: 8-bit data code is converted to 12-channel bit)<br>
and RLL (1, 10) (Among a code train after modulated, a<br>
minimum inversion length relevant to a 12-channel bit<br>
length T is 2T, and a maximum inversion length is 11T).<br>
Where performance evaluation of a reproduction circuit<br>
described later in "4-2) Description of reproducing<br>
circuit in the present embodiment) is carried out, in<br>
order to stably carry out reproduction by the<br>
reproducing circuit, it has been found necessary to<br>
meet that a ratio of [differential value 111 = IHH ~<br>
IHL between the I11H and reproduction signal amount<br>
IHL from a recording mark having a sufficiently long<br>
length (11T)] is:<br>
I11/I11H  °-4 (2°) or preferably,<br>
I11/I11H &gt; 0.2 (21)<br>
In the present embodiment, a PRML method is<br>
utilized at the time of signal reproduction recorded at<br>
high density, and a signal processor circuit and a<br>
state transition chart shown in FIGS. 15 to 17 is used<br>
(A detailed description is given later). In order to<br>
precisely carry out detection in accordance with a PRML<br>
technique, the linearity of a reproduction signal is<br>
requested. The characteristic of the signal processor<br>
circuit shown in FIGS. 15 and 16 has been analyzed<br>
based on the state transition chart shown in FIG. 17,<br>
in order to ensure the linearity of the above<br>
reproduction signal. As a result, it has been found<br>
necessary to meet that a ratio relevant to the above<br>
of a value when a recording mark having a length of<br>
3T and a reproduction signal amplitude from a<br>
repetition signal of an unrecorded space is defined as<br>
13 meets:<br>
l3/Ill  0.35 (22); or desirably,<br>
I3/In  0.2 (23)<br>
In view of a condition for the above formula (16),<br>
the present embodiment is technically featured in that<br>
a value of AlQS been set so as to meet formulas<br>
(20) and (21). Referring to formula (16), the<br>
following is obtained:<br>
1 - 0.3 = 0.7 (24)<br>
In view of formula (24), from a correlation with<br>
formula (20), the following condition is derived:<br>
 (A1405 ~ 0.3)/0.7  0.4, that is,<br>
A1405 2. 0.58 (25)<br>
Formula (25) is a formula derived from a very<br>
coarse result of discussion, and is merely shown as a<br>
basic concept. Because the Ah4Q5 setting range is<br>
specified in accordance with formula (16), in the<br>
present embodiment, at least a condition for A14Q5 is<br>
mandatory as:<br>
A1405 &gt; 0.3 (26)<br>
As a method for selecting an organic dye material<br>
suitable to a specific "H-L" recording layer, there is<br>
selected an organic dye material for which, in the<br>
present embodiment, based on an optical film design, a<br>
refractive factor range in an unrecorded state is<br>
1.3 to 2.0; the absorption coefficient range is<br>
0.1 to 0.2, desirably n32 = 1.7 to 1.9; the absorption<br>
coefficient range is k-2 = 0.15 to 0.17, and a series<br>
of conditions described above are met.<br>
In the "H-L" recording film shown in FIG. 9 or 10,<br>
in light absorption spectra in an unrecorded area,<br>
although a wavelength of write is shorter than a<br>
wavelength of reproduction light or<br>
recording/reproducing light (for example, 405 nm), the<br>
wavelength of write longer than a<br>
wavelength of reproduction light or<br>
recording/reproducing light (for example, 405 nm),<br>
without being limited thereto.<br>
In odder to meet the above formula (22) or formula<br>
(23), the thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 is<br>
influenced. For example, if the thickness Dg of the<br>
recording layer 3-2 significantly exceeds an allowable<br>
value, optical characteristics of only a part coming<br>
into contact with the transparent substrate 2-2 in the<br>
recording layer 3-2 are changed as a state that follows<br>
forming of the recording mark 9, whereby the optical<br>
characteristics of a portion coming into contact with<br>
the light reflection layer 4-2 adjacent to its location<br>
are obtained as a value equal to that in the unrecorded<br>
area. As a result, a reproduction light amount change<br>
is lowered, and a value of 13 in formula (22) or<br>
formula (23) is reduced, and a condition for formula<br>
(22) or formula (23) cannot be met. Therefore, in<br>
order to meet formula (22), as shown in FIGS. 8B and<br>
8C, it is necessary to make a change to the optical<br>
characteristics of a portion which comes into contact<br>
with the light reflection layer 4-2 in the recording<br>
mark 9. Further, if the thickness Dg of the recording<br>
layer 3-2 significantly exceeds an allowable value, a<br>
temperature gradient occurs in the thickness direction<br>
in the recording layer 3-2 when the recording mark is<br>
formed. Then, before reaching the optical<br>
characteristic change temperature at a portion coming<br>
into contact with the light reflection layer 4-2 in the<br>
recording layer 3-2, a gasification (evaporation)<br>
temperature of a portion coming into contact with the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 is exceeded or a thermal<br>
deformation temperature is exceeded in the transparent<br>
substrate 2-2. For the above reason, in the present<br>
embodiment, in order to meet formula (22), the<br>
thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 is set to "3T"<br>
or less based on the discussion of thermal analysis;<br>
and a condition meeting formula (23) is such that the<br>
thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 is set to<br>
"3 x 3T" or less. Basically, in the case where the<br>
thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 is equal to or<br>
smaller than "3T", although formula (22) can be met,<br>
the thickness may be set to "T" or less in<br>
consideration of effect of a tilt due to a facial<br>
motion or warping of the write-once type information<br>
storage medium or a margin relevant to a focal<br>
blurring. In consideration of a result obtained by<br>
formulas (1) and (2) described previously, the<br>
thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 in the present<br>
embodiment is set in the range assigned in a required<br>
minimum condition that:<br>
9T &gt; Dg &gt; X/8n32 (27)<br>
and in a desired condition that:<br>
3T &gt; Dg &gt; X/4n32 (28)<br>
Without being limited thereto, the severest<br>
condition can be defined as:<br>
T &gt; Dg &gt; L/4n32 (29)<br>
As described later, a value of the channel bit<br>
length T is 102 nm in the H format, and is 69 nm to<br>
80 nm in the B format. Thus, a value of 3T is 306 nm<br>
in the H format and is 207 nm to 240 nm in the B<br>
format. A value of 9T is 918 nm in the H format and is<br>
621 nm to 720 nm in the B format. Here, although an<br>
"H-L" recording film has been described, the conditions<br>
for formulas (27) to (29) can be applied to an "L-H"<br>
recording film without being limited thereto.<br>
Chapter 4 Description of Reproducing Apparatus or<br>
Recording/Reproducing Apparatus and Recording<br>
Condition/Reproducing Circuit<br>
4-1) Description of structure and characteristics<br>
of reproducing apparatus or recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus in the present embodiment<br>
FIG. 11 shows an illustration of a structure in an<br>
embodiment of an information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus. In FIG. 11, an upper side of a control unit<br>
143 mainly indicates an information recording control<br>
system for an information storage medium. In the<br>
embodiment of the information reproducing apparatus, a<br>
structure excluding the information recording control<br>
system in FIG. 11 corresponds to the above structure.<br>
In FIG. 11, the arrow drawn by the thick solid line<br>
indicates a flow of main information which designates a<br>
reproduction signal or a recording signal; the arrow of<br>
the thin solid line denotes a flow of information; the<br>
arrow of the one-dotted chain line denotes a reference<br>
clock line; and the arrow of the thin dashed line<br>
denotes a command indicating direction.<br>
An optical head (not shown) is arranged in an<br>
information recording/reproducing unit 141 shown in<br>
FIG. 11. In the present embodiment, although a<br>
wavelength of a light source (semiconductor laser) used<br>
in the optical head is 405 nm, the present embodiment<br>
is not limited thereto, and there can be used a light<br>
source having a use wavelength equal to or shorter than<br>
620 nm or 530 nm or a light source ranging from 355 nm<br>
to 455 nm, as described previously. In addition, two<br>
objective lenses used to focus the light beam having<br>
the above wavelength onto the information storage<br>
medium may be incorporated in the optical head. In the<br>
case where a recording/reproducing operation is carried<br>
out with respect to an information storage medium in<br>
the H format, an objective lens having a NA value of<br>
0.65 is used. A structure is provided such that, in<br>
the case where a recording/reproducing operation is<br>
carried out with respect to an information storage<br>
medium in the B format, an objective lens having NA =<br>
0.85 is used. As an intensity distribution of incident<br>
light immediately before the light is incident to an<br>
objective lens, the relative intensity at the periphery<br>
of the objective lens (at the boundary position of an<br>
aperture) when the center intensity is set to "1" is<br>
referred to as "RIM Intensity". A value of the RIM<br>
intensity in the H format is set in the range of 55% to<br>
70%. At this time, a wave surface aberration amount in<br>
the optical head is optically designed so as to be<br>
0.33A, (0.33X or less) with respect to a use<br>
wavelength A,.<br>
In the present embodiment, a partial response<br>
maximum likelihood (PRML) is used for information<br>
reproduction to achieve high density of an information<br>
storage medium (FIG. 1, point [A]). As a result of a<br>
variety of tests, when PR(1, 2, 2, 2, 1) is used as a<br>
PR class to be used, line density can be increased and<br>
the reliability of a reproduction signal can be<br>
improved (i.e., demodulation reliability can be<br>
improved) when a servo correction error such as a focal<br>
blurring or a track shift has occurred. Thus, in the<br>
present embodiment, PR(1, 2, 2, 2, 1) is employed<br>
(FIG. 1, point [Al]). In the present embodiment, a<br>
channel bit pattern after modulated is recorded in an<br>
information storage medium in accordance with a (d, k;<br>
m, n) modulation rule (In the above described method,<br>
this denotes RLL(d, k) of m/n modulation).<br>
Specifically, ETM (Eight to Twelve Modulation) for<br>
converting 8-bit data to a 12-channel bit (m = 8, n =<br>
12) is employed as a modulation system, and a condition<br>
of RLL (1, 10) in which a minimum value having<br>
continuous "0"s is defined as d = 1, and a maximum<br>
value is defined as k = 10 as a run length limited RLL<br>
restriction for apply limitation to a length that<br>
follows "0" in the channel bit pattern after modulated<br>
must be met. In the present embodiment, in order to<br>
achieve high density of an information storage medium,<br>
a channel bit gap is reduced to the minimum. As a<br>
result, for example, after a pattern<br>
"101010101010101010101010" which is a repetition of a<br>
pattern of d = 1 has been recorded in the information<br>
storage medium, in the case where the data is<br>
reproduced in an information recording/reproducing unit<br>
141, the data is close to a shutdown frequency having<br>
MTF characteristics of a reproducing optical system,<br>
and thus, a signal amplitude of a reproduced raw signal<br>
is formed in a shape almost hidden by noise.<br>
Therefore, a partial response maximum likelihood (PRML)<br>
technique is used as a method for thus reproducing a<br>
recording mark or a pit, which has been dense up to the<br>
vicinity of a limit of the MTF characteristics<br>
(shutdown frequency). That is, a signal reproduced<br>
from the information recording/reproducing unit 141<br>
receives reproducing waveform correction by a PR<br>
equalizer circuit 130. A signal having passed through<br>
the PR equalizer circuit 130 is sampled by converting a<br>
signal after passing through the PR equalizer circuit<br>
130 to a digital amount in accordance with a timing of<br>
a reference clock 198 sent from a reference clock<br>
generating circuit 160; the sampled signal is converted<br>
to a digital data by an AD converter 169; and a Viterbi<br>
decoding process is carried out in a Viterbi decoder<br>
156. The data after Viterbi-decoded is processed as<br>
data, which is completely similar to binary data at a<br>
conventional slice level. In the case where the PRML<br>
technique has been employed, if a sampling timing<br>
obtained by the AD converter 169 is shifted, an error<br>
rate of the data after Viterbi decoded increases.<br>
Therefore, in order to enhance precision of the<br>
sampling timing, the information reproducing apparatus<br>
or information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the present embodiment has another<br>
sampling timing sampling circuit in particular<br>
(combination of Schmidt trigger binarizing circuit 155<br>
and PLL circuit 174). This Schmidt trigger circuit 155<br>
has a specific value (forward direction voltage value<br>
of diode in actuality) at a slice reference level for<br>
binarizing, and is featured in that binarizing is<br>
provide only when the specific width has been exceeded.<br>
Therefore, for example, as described above, in the case<br>
where a pattern of "101010101010101010101010" has been<br>
input, a signal amplitude is very small, and thus,<br>
switching of binarizing does not occur. In the case<br>
where "1001001001001001001001" or the like, for<br>
example, being a pattern of a rarer fraction than the<br>
above, has been input, an amplitude of a reproducing<br>
raw signal increases, and thus, the polarity switching<br>
of a binary signal occurs in accordance with a timing<br>
of "1" by a Schmidt trigger binarizing circuit 155. In<br>
the present embodiment, an NRZI (Non Return to Zero<br>
Invert) technique is employed, and a position of "1" of<br>
the above pattern coincides with an edge section<br>
(boundary section) of a recording mark or a pit.<br>
A PLL circuit 174 detects a shift in frequency and<br>
phase between a binary signal which is an output of<br>
this Schmidt trigger binarizing circuit 155 and a<br>
signal of a reference clock 198 sent from a reference<br>
clock generating circuit 160 to change the frequency<br>
and phase of the output clock of the PLL circuit 174.<br>
A reference clock generating circuit 160 applies a<br>
feedback to (a frequency and a phase) of a reference<br>
clock 198 so as to lower an error rate after Viterbi<br>
decoded, by using an output signal of this PLL circuit<br>
174 and decoding characteristic information on a<br>
Viterbi decoder 156 and a convergence length<br>
(information on (distance to convergence)) in a path<br>
metric memory in the Viterbi decoder 156, although is<br>
not specifically shown). The reference clock 198<br>
generated by this reference clock generating circuit<br>
160 is utilized as a reference timing at the time of<br>
reproduction signal processing.<br>
A sync code position sampling unit 145 serves to<br>
detect the presence and position of a sync code, which<br>
coexists in an output data train of the Viterbi decoder<br>
156 and to sample a start position of the above output<br>
data. While this start position is defined as a<br>
reference, a demodulator circuit 152 carries out a<br>
demodulating process with respect to data temporarily<br>
stored in a shift resistor circuit 170. In the present<br>
embodiment, the above temporarily stored data is<br>
returned to its original bit pattern with reference to<br>
a conversion table recorded in a demodulating<br>
conversion table recording unit 154 on 12-channel bit<br>
by bit basis. Then, an error correcting process is<br>
performed by an ECC decoding circuit 162, and<br>
descrambling is carried out by a descrambling circuit<br>
159. Address information is recorded in advance by<br>
wobble modulation in a recording type (rewritable type<br>
or write-once type) information storage medium<br>
according to the present embodiment. A wobble signal<br>
detecting unit 135 reproduces this address information<br>
(i.e., judges the contents of a wobble signal), and<br>
supplies information required to provide an access to a<br>
desired location to the control unit 143.<br>
A description will be given with respect to an<br>
information recording control system provided at the<br>
upper side than the control unit 143. After data ID<br>
information has been generated from a data ID<br>
generating unit 165 in accordance with a recording<br>
position on an information storage medium, when copy<br>
control information is generated by a CPR_MAI data<br>
generating unit 167, a variety of information on data<br>
ID, IED, CPRJMAI, and EDC is added to information to be<br>
recorded by a data ID, IED, CPR_MAI, and EDC adding<br>
unit 168. After the added information has been<br>
descrambled by the descrambling circuit 157, an ECC<br>
block is formed by an ECC encoding circuit 161, and the<br>
ECC block is converted to a channel bit pattern by a<br>
modulating circuit 151. A sync code is added by a sync<br>
code generating/adding unit 146, and data is recorded<br>
in an information storage medium in the information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141. At the time of<br>
modulation, DSV values after modulated are sequentially<br>
calculated by a DSV (Digital Sum Value) calculating<br>
unit 148, and the serially calculated values are fed<br>
back to code conversion after modulated.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a detailed structure of peripheral<br>
portions including the sync code position detector unit<br>
145 shown in FIG. 11. A sync code is composed of a<br>
sync position detecting code section and a variable<br>
code section having a fixed pattern. From the channel<br>
bit pattern output from a Viterbi decoder, a sync<br>
position detecting code detector unit 182 detects a<br>
position of a sync position detecting code section<br>
having the above fixed pattern. Variable code transfer<br>
units 183 and 184 sample data on a variable code which<br>
exists before and after the detected position, and<br>
judge in which sync frame in a sector the sync code is<br>
positioned, the sync code being detected by an<br>
identifying unit 185 for detecting a sync position<br>
having the above fixed pattern. User information<br>
recorded on an information storage medium is<br>
sequentially transferred in order of a shift register<br>
circuit 170, a demodulation processing unit 188 in a<br>
demodulator circuit 152, and an ECC decoding<br>
circuit 162.<br>
In the present embodiment, in the H format, the<br>
high density of the information storage medium is<br>
achieved (in particular, line density is improved) by<br>
using the PRML system for reproduction in a data area,<br>
a data lead-in area, and a data lead-out area. In<br>
addition, compatibility with a current DVD is ensured<br>
and reproduction stability is ensured by using a slice<br>
level detecting system for reproducing in a system<br>
lead-in area and a system lead-out area. (A detailed<br>
description will be given later in "Chapter 7:<br>
Description of H Format".)<br>
4-2) Description of reproducing circuit in the<br>
present embodiment<br>
FIG. 13 shows an embodiment of a signal<br>
reproducing circuit using a slice level detecting<br>
system used at the time of reproduction in a system<br>
lead-in area and a system lead-out area. A quadrature<br>
optical detector 302 in FIG. 13 is fixed into the<br>
optical head, which exists in the information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141 in FIG. 11.<br>
Hereinafter, a signal having taken a sum of detection<br>
signals obtained from optical detecting cells la, Ib,<br>
Ic, and Id of the quadrature optical detector 302 is<br>
referred to as a "lead channel 1 signal". From a<br>
preamplifier 304 to a slicer 310 in FIG. 13 corresponds<br>
to a detailed structure in the slice level detecting<br>
circuit 132 in FIG. 11. A reproduction signal obtained<br>
from an information storage medium is subjected to a<br>
waveform equalizing process by a pre-equalizer 308<br>
after the signal has passed through a high path filter<br>
306 which shuts out a frequency component lower than a<br>
reproduction signal frequency bandwidth. According to<br>
testing, it has found that this pre-equalizer 308<br>
minimizes a circuit scale by using a 7-tap equalizer<br>
and can detect a reproduction signal precisely. Thus,<br>
in the present embodiment, the 7-tap equalizer is used.<br>
A VFO circuit/PLL 312 in FIG. 13 corresponds to the PLL<br>
circuit 174 in FIG. 11; and a demodulating/ECC decoding<br>
circuit 314 in FIG. 13 corresponding to the decoding<br>
circuit 152 and the ECC decoding circuit 162 in<br>
FIG. 11.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a detailed structure in a circuit of<br>
the slicer 310 in FIG. 13. A binary signal after<br>
sliced is generated by using a comparator 316. In<br>
response to an inverting signal of binary data after<br>
binarized is set at a slice level at the time of<br>
binarizing. In the present embodiment, a cutoff<br>
frequency of this low path filter is set to 5 KHz.<br>
When this cutoff frequency is high, a slice level<br>
change is fast, and the low path filter is affected by<br>
noise. In contrast, if a cutoff frequency is low, a<br>
slice level response is slow, and thus, the filter is<br>
affected by dust or scratch on the information storage<br>
medium. The cutoff frequency is set to 5 KHz in<br>
consideration of a relationship between RLL(1, 10) and<br>
a reference frequency of a channel bit described<br>
previously.<br>
FIG. 15 shows a signal processor circuit using a<br>
PRML detecting technique used for signal reproduction<br>
in a data area, a data lead-in area, and a data leadout<br>
area. A quadrature optical detector 302 in FIG. 15<br>
is fixed into the optical head, which exists in the<br>
information recording/reproducing unit 141 in FIG. 11.<br>
Hereinafter, a signal having taken a sum of detection<br>
signals obtained from the optical detecting cells la,<br>
lb, Ic, and Id of the quadrature optical detector 302<br>
is referred to as a "lead channel 1 signal". A<br>
derailed structure in the PR equalizer circuit 130 in<br>
FIG. 11 is composed of circuits from a preamplifier 304<br>
to a tap controller 332, an equalizer 330, and an<br>
offset canceller 336 in FIG. 15. A PLL circuit 334 in<br>
FIG. 15 is a part in the PR equalizer circuit 130, and<br>
denotes an element other than the Schmidt trigger<br>
binarizing circuit 155. A primary cutoff frequency of<br>
a high path filter circuit 306 in FIG. 15 is set at<br>
1 KHz. A pre-equalizer circuit 308 uses a 7-tap<br>
equalizer in the same manner as that in FIG. 13<br>
(because the use of the 7-tap equalizer minimizes a<br>
circuit scale and can detect a reproduction signal<br>
precisely). A sample clock frequency of an A/D<br>
converter circuit 324 is set to 72 MHz, and a digital<br>
output is produced as an eight-bit output. In the PRML<br>
detecting technique, if a reproduction signal is<br>
affected by a level change (DC offset) of its entire<br>
signal, an error is likely to occur at the time of<br>
Viterbi demodulation. In order to eliminate such an<br>
effect, there is provided a structure of correcting an<br>
offset by the offset canceller 336 using a signal<br>
obtained from an equalizer output. In the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 15, an adaptive equalizing process is<br>
carried out in the PR equalizer circuit 130. Thus, a<br>
tap controller for automatically correcting tap<br>
coefficients in the equalizer 330 is utilized by<br>
utilizing an output signal of the Viterbi decoder 156.<br>
FIG. 16 shows a structure in the Viterbi decoder<br>
156 shown in FIG. 11 or 15. A branch metric relevant<br>
to all branches, which can be predicted in response to<br>
an input signal, is calculated by a branch metric<br>
calculating unit 340, and the calculated value is sent<br>
to an ACS 342. The ACS 342 is an acronym of Add<br>
Compare Select, which calculates a path metric obtained<br>
by adding branch metrics in response to each of the<br>
passes which can be predicted in the ACS 342 and<br>
transfers the calculation result to a path metric<br>
memory 350. At this time, in the ACS 342, a<br>
calculating process is carried out with reference to<br>
the information contained in the path metric memory<br>
350. A path memory 346 temporarily stores a value of<br>
the path metric corresponding to each path (transition)<br>
state and such each path, which can be predicted in the<br>
memory 346, the value being calculated by the ACS 342.<br>
An output switch unit 348 compares a path metric<br>
corresponding to each path, and selects a path when a<br>
path metric value becomes minimal.<br>
FIG. 17 shows a state change in PR(1, 2, 2, 2, 1)<br>
class in the present embodiment. A change of a state<br>
which can be obtained in the PR(1, 2, 2, 2, 1) class<br>
can be made as only a change shown in FIG. 17, and a<br>
path which can exist (which can be predicted) at the<br>
time of decoding is identified in the Viterbi decoder<br>
156 based on a transition chart in FIG. 17.<br>
4-3) Description of recording condition in the<br>
present embodiment<br>
"A description of optimal recording power (peak<br>
power) in the present embodiment has been given in<br>
"3-3) Recording characteristics common to organic dye<br>
recording film in the present embodiment". Referring<br>
to FIG. 18, a description will be given with respect to<br>
a recording waveform (exposure condition at the time of<br>
recording) used when the optimal recording power is<br>
checked.<br>
The exposure levels at the time of recording have<br>
four levels of recording power (peak power), bias power<br>
1, bias power 2, and bias power 3. When a long (4T or<br>
more) recording mark 9 is formed, modulation is carried<br>
out in the form of multi-pulses between recording power<br>
(peak power) and bias power 3. In the present<br>
embodiment, in any of the H format and B format<br>
systems, a minimum mark length relevant to a channel<br>
bit length T is obtained as 2T. In the case where this<br>
minimum mark of 2T is recorded, one write pulse of<br>
recording power (peak power) after bias power 1 is used<br>
as shown in FIG. 18, and bias power 2 is temporarily<br>
obtained immediately after the write pulse. In the<br>
case where a 3T recording mark 9 is recorded, bias<br>
power 2 is temporarily used after exposing two write<br>
pulses, a first pulse and a last pulse of recording<br>
power (peak power) level that follows bias power 1. In<br>
the case where a recording mark 9 having a length of 4T<br>
or more is recorded, bias power 2 is used after multipulse<br>
and write pulse exposure.<br>
The vertical dashed line in FIG. 18 shows a<br>
channel clock cycle. In the case where a 2T minimum<br>
mark is recorded, the laser power is risen at a<br>
position delayed by TSFP from a clock edge, and fallen<br>
at a position, which is backward by TELP from an edge<br>
of a succeeding clock. A cycle during which the laser<br>
power is set at bias power 2 is defined as TLO Values<br>
of TSFP, TELp, and TLC are recorded in physical format<br>
information PFI contained in a control data zone CDZ as<br>
described later in the case of the H format. In the<br>
case where a 3T or more long recording mark is formed,<br>
the laser power is risen at a position delayed by TSFP<br>
from a clock edge, and lastly, ended with a last pulse.<br>
Immediately after the last pulse, the laser power is<br>
kept at the bias power 2 during a period of TLQ. Shift<br>
times from a clock edge to a rise/fall timing of the<br>
last pulse are defined as TSLP^ TELP- In addition, a<br>
shift time from a clock edge to a fall timing of the<br>
last pulse is defined as TEEp, and further, an interval<br>
of a single pulse of a multi-pulse is defined as T^p.<br>
Each of intervals TELP - TSFP, TMP, TELP - TSLP,<br>
and TLC is defined as a half-value wide relevant to a<br>
maximum value, as shown in FIG. 19. In addition, in<br>
the present embodiment, the above parameter setting<br>
range is defined as follows:<br>
0.25T 
O.OOT 
LOOT 
- 0.10T 
O.OOT 
0.1ST 
Further, in the present embodiment, the values of<br>
the above described parameters can be changed as shown<br>
in FIGS. 20A, 20B and 20C according to a recording mark<br>
length (Mark Length) and the immediately<br>
preceding/immediately succeeding space length<br>
(Leading/Trailing space length). FIGS. 21A, 21B and<br>
21C each shows parameter values when optimal recording<br>
power of the write-once type information storage medium<br>
recorded in a principle of recording shown in the<br>
present embodiment has been checked, as described in<br>
the section "3-3) Recording characteristics common to<br>
organic dye recording film in the present embodiment".<br>
At this time, the values of bias power 1, bias power 2,<br>
and bias power 3 are 2.6 mW, 1.7 mW, and 1.7 mW, and<br>
reproduction power is 0.4 mW.<br>
Chapter 5: Specific Description of Organic Dye<br>
Recording Film in the Present Embodiment<br>
5-1) Description of characteristics relating to<br>
"L-H" recording film in the present embodiment<br>
A description will be given with respect to an "LH"<br>
recording film having characteristics in which a<br>
light reflection amount is lowered in a recording mark<br>
as compared with that in an unrecorded area. From<br>
among principles of recording described in "3-2-B]<br>
Basic characteristics common to organic dye recording<br>
material in the present embodiment", a principle of<br>
recording in the case of using this recording film<br>
mainly utilizes any of:<br>
- Chromogenic characteristic change;<br>
- Change of electron structure (electron orbit)<br>
relevant to elements which contribute to chromogenic<br>
phenomenon [discoloring action or the like]; and<br>
- Array change between molecules, and changes<br>
characteristics of light absorption spectra. The "L-H"<br>
recording film is featured in that the reflection<br>
amount range in an unrecorded location and a recorded<br>
location has been specified in view of characteristics<br>
of a read-only type information storage medium having a<br>
one-sided two-layered structure. FIG. 22 shows a light<br>
reflection factor range in an unrecorded area (nonrecording<br>
portion) of the "H-L" recording film and the<br>
"L-H" recording film according to the present<br>
embodiment. In the present embodiment, the lower limit<br>
value 8 of the reflection factor at the non-recording<br>
portion of the "H-L" recording film is specified so as<br>
to be higher than an upper limit value y at the nonrecording<br>
portion of the "L-H" recording film. When<br>
the above information storage medium has been mounted<br>
on an information recording/reproducing apparatus or an<br>
information reproducing apparatus, a light reflection<br>
factor of the non-recording portion is measured by the<br>
slice level detector unit 132 or the PR equalizer<br>
circuit 130 shown in FIG. 11, thereby making it<br>
possible to judge whether the film is the "H-L"<br>
recording film or "L-H" recording film, and thus,<br>
making it very easy to judge type of recording film.<br>
Measurement has been carried out while producing the<br>
"H-L" recording film and the "L-H" recording film under<br>
a changed manufacturing condition, when a light<br>
reflection factor a between the lower limit value 8 at<br>
the non-recording portion of the "H-L" recording film<br>
and the upper limit value y at the non-recording<br>
portion of the "L-H" recording film is set in the range<br>
of 32% to 40%. As a result, it has been found that<br>
high manufacturing performance of the recording film is<br>
obtained and medium cost reduction is facilitated.<br>
After an optical reflection factor range 801 of a nonrecording<br>
portion ("L" portion) of the "L-H" recording<br>
film is made coincident with a light reflection factor<br>
range 803 of a one-sided double recording layer in the<br>
read-only type information storage medium, when a light<br>
reflection factor range 802 of a non-recording portion<br>
("H" portion") of the "H-L" recording film is made<br>
coincident with a light reflection factor range 804 of<br>
a one-sided single layer in the read-only type<br>
information storage medium, a reproducing circuit of<br>
the information reproducing apparatus can be used in<br>
common to be well compatible with the read-only type<br>
information storage medium, and thus, the information<br>
reproducing apparatus can be produced inexpensively.<br>
Measurement has been carried out while producing the<br>
"H-L" recording film and the "L-H" recording film under<br>
a variety of changed manufacturing conditions, in order<br>
to facilitate price reduction of a medium while<br>
improving the manufacturing performance of the<br>
recording film. As a result, the lower limit value (3<br>
of the light reflection factor of the non-recording<br>
portion ("L" portion) of the "L-H" recording film is<br>
set to 18%, and the upper limit value y is set to 32%;<br>
and the lower limit value 8 of the light reflection<br>
factor of the non-recording portion ("H" portion) of<br>
the "H-L" recording film is set to 40%, and the upper<br>
limit value e is set to 85%.<br>
FIGS. 23 and 24 show reflection factors at a nonrecording<br>
position and a recorded position in a variety<br>
of recording films in the present embodiment. In the<br>
case where an H format has been employed (refer to<br>
"Chapter 7: Description of H Format"), an optical<br>
reflection factor range at the non-recording portion is<br>
specified as shown in FIG. 22, whereby a signal appears<br>
in a same direction in an emboss area (such as system<br>
leas-in area SYLDI) and a recording mark area (data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI, data lead-out area DTLDO, or data<br>
area DTA) in the "L-H" recording film while a groove<br>
level is defined as a reference. Similarly, in the "HL"<br>
recording film, while a groove level is defined as a<br>
reference, a signal appears in an opposite direction in<br>
an emboss area (such as system lead-in area SYSDI) and<br>
a recording mark area (data lead-in area DTLDI, data<br>
lead-out area DTLDO, or data area DTA). Utilizing this<br>
phenomenon, a detecting circuit design corresponding to<br>
the "L-H" recording film and "H-L" recording film is<br>
facilitated in addition to use for recording film<br>
identification between the "L-H" recording film and the<br>
"H-L" recording film. In addition, the reproduction<br>
signal characteristics obtained from a recording mark<br>
recorded on the "L-H" recording film shown in the<br>
present embodiment is adjusted to conform to signal<br>
characteristics obtained from the "H-L" recording film<br>
to meet formulas (20) to (23). In this manner, in the<br>
case of using either one of the "L-H" recording film<br>
and the "H-L" recording film, the same signal processor<br>
circuit can be used, and the signal processor circuit<br>
can be simplified and reduced in price.<br>
5-2) Characteristics of light absorption spectra<br>
relating to "L-H" recording film in the present<br>
embodiment<br>
As has been described in "3-4) Description of<br>
characteristics relating to "H-L" recording film in the<br>
present embodiment, the relative absorbance in an<br>
unrecorded area is basically low in the "H-L" recording<br>
film, and thus, when reproduction light has been<br>
irradiated at the time of reproduction, there occurs an<br>
optical characteristic change generated by absorbing<br>
energy of the reproduction light. Even if an optical<br>
characteristic change (update of recording action) has<br>
occurred after the energy of the reproduction light has<br>
been absorbed in a recording mark having high<br>
absorbance, a light reflection factor from the<br>
recording mark is lowered. Thus, reproduction signal<br>
processing is less affected because such a change works<br>
in a direction in which an amplitude of a reproduction<br>
signal (In = IHH ~ ^IIL.) °f tne reproduction signal<br>
increases.<br>
In contrast, the "L-H" recording film has optical<br>
characteristics that "a light reflection factor of an<br>
unrecorded portion is lower than that in a recording<br>
mark". This means that, as is evident from the<br>
contents described with respect to FIG. 2B, the<br>
absorbance of the unrecorded portion is higher than<br>
that in the recording mark. Thus, in the "L-H"<br>
recording film, signal degradation at the time of<br>
reproduction is likely to occur as compared with the<br>
"H-L" recording film. As described in "3-2-B] Basic<br>
characteristics common to organic dye recording<br>
material in the invention", there is a need for<br>
improving reliability of reproduction information in<br>
the case where reproduction signal degradation has<br>
occurred due to ultraviolet ray or reproduction light<br>
irradiation".<br>
As a result of checking the characteristics of an<br>
organic dye recording material in detail, it has been<br>
found that a mechanism of absorbing the energy of<br>
reproduction light to cause an optical characteristic<br>
change is substantially analogous to that of an optical<br>
characteristic change due to ultraviolet ray<br>
irradiation. As a result, if there is provided a<br>
structure of improving durability relevant to<br>
ultraviolet ray irradiation in an unrecorded area,<br>
signal degradation at the time of reproduction hardly<br>
occurs. Thus, the present embodiment is featured in<br>
that, in the "L-H" recording film, a value of Xmax<br>
write (maximum absorption wavelength which is the<br>
closest to wavelength of recording light) is longer<br>
than a wavelength of recording light or reproduction<br>
light (close to 405 nm). In this manner, the<br>
absorbance relevant to the ultraviolet ray can be<br>
reduced, and the durability relevant to ultraviolet ray<br>
irradiation can be significantly improved. As is<br>
evident from FIG. 26, a difference in absorbance<br>
between a recorded portion and an unrecorded portion in<br>
the vicinity of A,max Write ^s small, and a degree of<br>
reproduction signal modulation (signal amplitude) in<br>
the case where the wavelength light in the vicinity of<br>
max write is reduced. In view of a wavelength change<br>
of a semiconductor laser light source, it is desirable<br>
that a sufficiently large degree of reproduction signal<br>
modulation (signal amplitude) be taken in the range of<br>
355 nm to 455 nm. Therefore, in the present<br>
embodiment, a design of a recording film 3-2 is made so<br>
that a wavelength of A.max write exists out of the range<br>
of 355 nm to 455 nm (i.e., at a longer wavelength than<br>
455 nm).<br>
FIG. 25 shows an example of light absorption<br>
spectra in the "L-H" recording film in the present<br>
embodiment. As described in "5-1) Description of<br>
features relating to "L-H" recording film, a lower<br>
limit value (3 of a light reflection factor at a nonrecording<br>
portion ("L" section) of the "L-H" recording<br>
film is set to 18%, and an upper limit value y is set<br>
to 32% in the present embodiment. From 1 - 0.32 =<br>
0.68, in order to meet the above condition, it is<br>
possible to intuitively understand whether or not a<br>
value A14Q5 °f ^he absorbance in an unrecorded area at<br>
405 nm should meet:<br>
A1405  68% (36)<br>
Although the light reflection factor at 405 nm of<br>
the light reflection layer 4-2 in FIGS. 2A and 2B is<br>
slightly lowered than 100%, it is assumed that the<br>
factor is almost close to 100% for the sake of<br>
simplification. Therefore, the light reflection factor<br>
when absorbance Al = 0 is almost 100%. In FIG. 25, the<br>
light reflection factor of the whole recording film at<br>
a wavelength of A,max Write is designated by<br>
write- At this time, assuming that the light<br>
reflection factor is zero (R-rnax write 0) / formula<br>
(36) is derived. However, in actuality, the factor is<br>
not set to "0", and thus, it is necessary to drive a<br>
severer formula. A severe conditional formula for<br>
setting the upper light value y of the light reflection<br>
factor of the non-recording portion '"L" portion) of<br>
the "L-H" recording film to 32% is given by:<br>
1 - A1405 x (1 - R^max write) °-32 (37)<br>
In a conventional write-once type information<br>
storage medium, only the "H-L" recording film is used,<br>
and there is no accumulation of information relating to<br>
the "L-H" recording film. However, in the case of<br>
using the present embodiment described later in "5-3)<br>
Anion portion: azo metal complex + cation portion: dye"<br>
and "5-4) Using "copper" as azo metal complex + center<br>
metal", the most severest condition which meets formula<br>
(37) is obtained as:<br>
A1405  80% (38)<br>
In the case of using an organic dye recording<br>
material described later in the embodiment, when an<br>
optical design of a recording film is made including a<br>
margin such as a characteristic variation at the time<br>
of manufacture or a thickness change of the recording<br>
layer 3-2, it has been found that a minimum condition<br>
which meet the reflection factor described in the<br>
section "Description of featured relating to "L-H"<br>
recording film" in the present embodiment:<br>
A1405 &gt; 40% (39)<br>
may be met. Further, by meeting either of:<br>
A1355 &gt; 40% (40)<br>
A1455 &gt; 40% (41)<br>
it is possible to ensure stable recording<br>
characteristics or reproduction characteristics even if<br>
a wavelength of a light source is changed in the range<br>
of 355 nm to 405 nm or in the range of 405 ran to 455 nm<br>
(in the range of 355 nm to 455 nm in the case where<br>
both of the formulas are met at the same time) .<br>
FIG. 26 shows a light absorption spectrum change<br>
after recorded in the "L-H" recording film according to<br>
the present embodiment. It is considered that a value<br>
of a maximum absorption wavelength Xlmax in a recording<br>
mark deviates from a wavelength of lmax write' anc* an<br>
inter-molecular array change (for example, an array<br>
change between azo metal complexes) occurs. Further,<br>
it is considered that a discoloring action (cutting of<br>
local electron orbit (local molecular link<br>
dissociation) ) occurs in parallel to a location in<br>
which both of the absorbance in location of ^lmax<br>
the absorbance Al at 405 nm are lowered and the<br>
light absorption spectra spreads itself.<br>
In the "L-H" recording film according to the<br>
present embodiment as well, by meeting each of formulas<br>
(20), (21), (22), and (23), the same signal processor<br>
circuit is made available for both of the "L-H"<br>
recording film and the "H-L" recording film, thereby<br>
promoting simplification and price reduction of the<br>
signal processor circuit. In formula (20), when:<br>
is modified,<br>
IllH IllL/0-6 (43)<br>
is obtained. As described previously, in the<br>
present embodiment, a lower limit value p of a light<br>
reflection factor of an unrecorded portion ("L"<br>
portion) of an "L-H" recording film is set to 18%, and<br>
this value corresponds to IHL- Further, conceptually,<br>
the above value corresponds to:<br>
IllH - 1 - Ah405 x (1 - RVax write) (44).<br>
Thus, from formulas (43) and (44), the following<br>
formula is established:<br>
1 - Ah405 x (1 - RA-max write) 0.18/0.6<br>
(45)<br>
If 1 - RX,max write ^ ®r formula (45) is modified<br>
as follows:<br>
Ah405 
In comparison between the above formulas (46) and<br>
(36), it is found that the values of A14Q5 and Ah4Q5<br>
may be seemingly set in the vicinity of 68% to 70% as<br>
values of absorbance. Further, in view of a case in<br>
which the value of A14Q5 is obtained in the range of<br>
formula (39) and performance stability of a signal<br>
processor circuit, a sever condition is obtained as:<br>
Ah405 
If possible, it is desirable to meet;<br>
Ah405  0.3 (48)<br>
5-3) Anion portion: Azo metal complex + cation<br>
portion: dye<br>
A description will be specifically given with<br>
respect to an organic dye material in the present<br>
embodiment having characteristics described in "5-1)<br>
Description of characteristics relating to "L-H"<br>
recording film in the present embodiment", the present<br>
embodiment meeting a condition shown in "5-2)<br>
Characteristics of optical absorption spectra relating<br>
to "L-H" recording film" in the present embodiment".<br>
The thickness of the recording layer 3-2 meets the<br>
conditions shown in formulas (3), (4), (27), and (28),<br>
and is formed by spinner coating (spin coating). For<br>
comparison, a description will be given by way of<br>
example. A crystal of a "salt" is assembled by "ion<br>
coupling" between positively charged "sodium ions" and<br>
negatively charged "chloride ions". Similarly, in<br>
polymers as well, there is a case in which a plurality<br>
of polymers are combined with each other in the form<br>
close to "ion coupling", forming configuring an organic<br>
dye material. The organic dye recording film 3-2 in<br>
the present embodiment is composed of a positively<br>
charged "cation portion" and a negatively charged<br>
"anion portion". In particular, the above recording<br>
film is technically featured in that: coupling<br>
stability is improved by utilizing a "dye" having<br>
chromogenic characteristics for the positively charged<br>
"cation portion" and utilizing an organic metal complex<br>
for the negatively charged "anion portion"; and there<br>
is met a condition that "8] an electron structure in a<br>
chromogenic area is stabilized, and structural<br>
decomposition relevant to ultraviolet ray or<br>
reproduction light irradiation hardly occurs" shown in<br>
"3-2-B] Basic feature common to organic dye recording<br>
material in the present embodiment". Specifically, in<br>
the present embodiment, an "azo metal complex" whose<br>
general structural formula is shown in FIG. 3 is<br>
utilized as an organic metal complex. In the present<br>
embodiment which comprises a combination of an anion<br>
portion and a cation portion, cobalt or nickel is used<br>
as a center metal M of this azo metal complex, thereby<br>
enhancing optical stability. There may be used:<br>
scandium, yttrium, titanium, zirconium, hafnium,<br>
vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chrome, molybdenum,<br>
tungsten, manganese, technetium, rhenium, iron,<br>
ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium,<br>
platinum, copper, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, or<br>
mercury and the like without being limited thereto. In<br>
the present embodiment, as a dye used for the cation<br>
portion, there is used any of a cyanine dye whose<br>
general structural formula is shown in FIG. 27; a<br>
styril dye whose general structural formula is shown in<br>
FIG. 28; and a monomethine cyanine dye whose general<br>
structural formula is shown in FIG. 29.<br>
Although an azo metal complex is used for the<br>
anion portion in the present embodiment, a formazane<br>
metal complex whose general structural formula is shown<br>
in FIG. 30 may be used without being limited thereto,<br>
for example. The organic dye recording material<br>
comprising the anion portion and cation portion is<br>
first powdered. In the case of forming the recording<br>
layer 3-2, the powdered organic dye receding material<br>
is dissolved in organic solvent, and spin coating is<br>
carried out on the transparent substrate 2-2. At this<br>
time, the organic solvent to be used includes: a<br>
fluorine alcohol based TFP (tetrafluoro propanol) or<br>
pentane; hexane; cyclohexane; petroleum ether; ether or<br>
analogous, nitrile or analogous, and any of a nitro<br>
compound or sulfur-containing compound or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
5-4) Using "copper" as azo metal complex + center<br>
metal<br>
FIGS. 65 and 66 each show an example of a light<br>
spectrum change before and after recording (forming a<br>
recording mark) in an "H-L" recording film and an "L-H"<br>
recording film using an optical characteristic change<br>
according to the present embodiment as a principle of<br>
recording. A wavelength of X,max write before recording<br>
(in an unrecorded area) is defined as.bmax Write; a<br>
half value width of a light absorption spectrum (b)<br>
around this X,max write (a width of a wavelength area<br>
meeting a range of "A  0.5" when the absorbance A at<br>
krnax write is "1") is defined as Was; and a wavelength<br>
°f ^max write °f a light absorption spectrum (a) after<br>
recorded (in a recording mark) is defined as ^.amax<br>
write- The recording film 3-2 having the<br>
characteristics shown in FIGS. 65 and 66 utilizes a<br>
"change of an electron structure (electron orbit)<br>
relevant to elements which contribute to a chromogenic<br>
phenomenon and a "molecular structure change in<br>
molecules" from among the principles of recording shown<br>
in [a] of "3-2-B] Basic characteristics common to<br>
organic dye recording material in the invention". If<br>
there occurs a "change of an electron structure<br>
(electron orbit) relevant to electrons which contribute<br>
to a chromogenic phenomenon", for example, the<br>
dimensions or structure of the light emitting area 8 as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 changes. For example, if dimensions of<br>
the light emitting area 8 change, the resonant<br>
absorption wavelength of the local electrons also<br>
changes, and thus, the maximum absorption wavelength of<br>
light absorption spectra changes from raax Write to<br>
max write- Similarly, if a "molecular structure<br>
change in molecules" occurs, a structure of the light<br>
emitting area 8 also changes, and thus, the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength of the light absorption spectra<br>
also changes. When a change amount of the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength is defined as AA,max, the<br>
following relationship is established:<br>
A^max - I amax write ~"max write I (49)<br>
When the maximum absorption wavelength of the<br>
light absorption spectra thus changes, the half value<br>
width Was of the light absorption spectra also changes<br>
concurrently. A description will be given with respect<br>
to an effect on a reproduction signal obtained from a<br>
recording mark position when the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength of the light absorption spectra and the half<br>
value width Was of the light absorption spectra have<br>
thus changed at the same time. The light absorption<br>
spectra in a pre-recording/unrecorded area are<br>
represented as (b) in FIG. 65 (FIG. 66), and thus, the<br>
absorbance with a reproduction light beam having 405 nm<br>
is obtained as Ah4Q5 (Alos) If only the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength changes to Xamax write as optical<br>
spectra after recorded (in recording mark) and a change<br>
of the half value width Was has not occurred, the light<br>
absorption spectra are theoretically obtained as shown<br>
in (c) of FIG. 65 (FIG. 66). Then, the absorbance with<br>
a reproduction light beam having 405 nm changes to<br>
A405- However, in actuality, the half value width<br>
changes, and the absorbance after recorded (in<br>
recording mark) is obtained as A14Q5 (Ah4Q5). A change<br>
amount |A]_4Q5 - Ah4Q5 of the absorbance before and<br>
after recorded is proportional to a reproduction signal<br>
amplitude value. Thus, in the example shown in FIG. 65<br>
(FIG. 66), the maximum absorption wavelength change and<br>
the half width value change work as an offset action<br>
relevant to an increase of the reproduction signal<br>
amplitude. Therefore, there occurs a problem that a<br>
C/N ratio of a reproduction signal is impaired. A<br>
first application example of the present embodiment for<br>
solving the above problem is featured in that the<br>
characteristics of the recording layer 3-2 is set<br>
(film-designed) so that a maximum absorption wavelength<br>
change and a half value width change work relevant to<br>
an increase of the reproduction signal amplitude in a<br>
synergetic manner. That is, as is easily predicted<br>
from the change shown in FIG. 65 (FIG. 66), the<br>
characteristics of the recording layer 3-2 is set<br>
(film-designed) so that a change occurs in a direction<br>
in which a half value width widens independent of a<br>
moving direction of A,amax Write after recorded relevant<br>
to bmax write before recorded in the "H-L" recording<br>
film or in a direction in which the half value width<br>
narrows independent of a moving direction of A,amax<br>
write after recorded relevant to bmax write before<br>
recorded in the "L-H" recording film.<br>
Now, a second application example in the present<br>
embodiment will be described here. As described<br>
previously, there is a case in which the C/N ratio of<br>
the reproduction signal is lowered by offsetting a<br>
difference between Ah4Q5 and A1405 due to the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength change and the change of the half<br>
value width Was. Further, in the above first<br>
application example or the embodiment shown in FIG. 65<br>
or FIG. 66, the maximum absorption wavelength change<br>
and the half value width Was of the light absorption<br>
spectra change at the same time, a value of the<br>
absorbance "A" after recorded (in recording mark) is<br>
affected by both of the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
change amount AXmax and the half value width change<br>
amount. When the write-once type information storage<br>
medium 12 has been mass-produced, it is difficult to<br>
precisely control values of both of the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength change amount A^max and the half<br>
value width change amount. Thus, when the information<br>
is recorded in the mass-produced write-once type<br>
information storage medium 12 has been recorded, a<br>
fluctuation of the reproduction signal amplitude<br>
increases. Then, the reliability of the reproduction<br>
signal is lowered when the signal has been reproduced<br>
by the information reproducing apparatus shown in<br>
FIG. 11. In contrast, the second application example<br>
in the present embodiment is featured in that a<br>
material of which the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
does not change between before and after recorded<br>
(between the recording mark and the unrecorded area).<br>
Therefore, a fluctuation of values of the absorbance<br>
"A" after recorded (in recording mark) is suppressed<br>
and a fluctuation between the individuals of the<br>
reproduction signal amplitude from the above value<br>
fluctuation is reduced, whereby the reliability of the<br>
reproduction signal has been improved. In this second<br>
application example, the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
does not change between before and after recording (in<br>
recording mark and in unrecorded area), and the value<br>
of the absorbance "A" is determined depending on only<br>
the spread of the light absorption spectra before and<br>
after recording (in recording mark and in unrecorded<br>
area). When a large number of write-once type<br>
information storage mediums 12 have been mass-produced,<br>
it is sufficient if only the spread of the light<br>
absorption spectra before and after recorded (in<br>
recording mark and in unrecorded area) is controlled,<br>
and thus, a fluctuation in characteristics between<br>
mediums can be reduced. Even if a contrivance is made<br>
so that a maximum absorption wavelength before and<br>
after recording (in recording mark and in unrecorded<br>
area) does not change, strictly, it is difficult to<br>
completely match the values of A,bmax write anc-amax<br>
write other, as shown in FIG. 68. The half value<br>
width Was of the light absorption spectra around Xbmax<br>
write shown in FIG. 65 or 66 is often included in the<br>
range of 100 nm to 200 nm in a general organic dye<br>
recording material. Therefore, if the value of the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength change amount AXmax<br>
exceeds 100 nm, it is possible to easily predict from<br>
FIG. 65 or 66 that there occurs a large difference<br>
between the absorbance Ah4Q5 (A14Q5) obtained from the<br>
characteristics of item (b) and the absorption A*4Q5<br>
obtained from the characteristics of item (c).<br>
Accordingly, the fact that "the maximum absorption<br>
wavelength does not change" as the second application<br>
example mans that the following condition is met:<br>
AA,max 
Further, when a condition that the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength change amount AXmax is 1/3 of the<br>
value obtained by formula (50), i.e.,<br>
AXmax 
a difference between the absorbance Ah4Q5 (A14Q5)<br>
obtained from the characteristics of item (b) and the<br>
absorption A*4Q5 obtained from the characteristics of<br>
item (c) is very small, and a fluctuation in<br>
reproduction signal characteristics between the mediums<br>
can be reduced.<br>
FIG. 68 shows the "L-H" recording film<br>
characteristics, which meet formula (50) or formula<br>
(51). The light absorption spectra before recorded (in<br>
unrecorded area) are obtained as wide spectra as shown<br>
in the characteristic (b) of FIG. 68, and the<br>
absorbance Ah4Q5 at a reproduction wavelength of 405 nm<br>
is obtained as a sufficient small value. The<br>
absorbance Ah405 after recorded (in recording mark)<br>
narrows in width as shown in the characteristic (a) of<br>
FIG. 68, and the absorbance AlQS at a reproduction<br>
wavelength of 405 nm rises.<br>
In order to meet formula (50) or formula (51), the<br>
present embodiment utilizes an "orientation change in<br>
molecules" in item [a] of "3-2-B] Basic characteristics<br>
common to organic dye recording material in the<br>
invention" as a principle of recording. In the azo<br>
metal complex shown in FIG. 3, a plurality of benzene<br>
nucleus rings are located on the same plane because the<br>
benzene nucleus rings are radically coupled with each<br>
other. That is, in FIG. 3, four benzene nuclear rings<br>
which exist more upwardly than the center metal M forms<br>
an U (up-side) plane which the benzene nucleus group<br>
produced; and four benzene nuclear rings which exist<br>
more downwardly than the center metal M forms a D<br>
(down-side) plane which the benzene nucleus group<br>
produced.<br>
A mutually parallel relationship is always<br>
maintained between the above U plane and D plane in any<br>
case (irrespective of whether pre-recording or postrecording<br>
may be). Side chain groups of Rl and R3 are<br>
arranged in a form orthogonal to the above U plane and<br>
D plane. Ion coupling is carried out between the<br>
center metal atom M and the oxygen atom 0, and a plane<br>
formed by a line segment for connecting 0-M-O is<br>
located in parallel to the above U plane and D plane.<br>
The light emitting area 8 surrounded in a round area<br>
shown in FIG. 3 has such a three-dimensional structure.<br>
For further description, a direction oriented from a<br>
direction of R4 to a direction of R5 in the U plane is<br>
tentatively defined as a "Yu direction", and a<br>
direction oriented from a direction of R4 to a<br>
direction of R5 in the D plane is defined as a "Yd<br>
direction". Orientation coupling is carried out<br>
between a nitrogen atom N included in the U plane or D<br>
plane and the center metal atom M sandwiched between<br>
these two planes so that a position of the nitrogen<br>
atom N around the center metal atom M can be rotated.<br>
That is, a structure is provided such that the Yd<br>
direction can be rotated with respect to the Yu<br>
direction while a mutually parallel relationship is<br>
maintained between the above U plane and D plane. In<br>
the azo metal complex shown in FIG. 3, the Yu direction<br>
and Yd direction can be parallel to each other, as<br>
shown in FIG. 67A (the orientations can be made<br>
identical or opposite to each other as shown in<br>
FIG. 67A); and the Yu direction and Yd direction can be<br>
in a skew position relationship as shown in FIG. 67B.<br>
Of course, an arbitrary angle relationship between<br>
FIGS. 67A and 67B can be also established. As<br>
described previously, the side chain groups of Rl and<br>
R3 are arranged in a form orthogonal to the above U<br>
plane and D plane. Thus, in the structure of FIG. 67A,<br>
collision is likely to occur between the side chain<br>
group of Rl or R3 and another side chain group of R4 or<br>
the like. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 67B, a time<br>
point at which the Yu direction and Yd direction are in<br>
a skew position relationship (when the U plane is seen<br>
from far above, the Yu direction and Yd direction are<br>
seen as if it were orthogonal to each other) is the<br>
most stable in a structural point of view. The light<br>
absorption wavelength in the light emitting area 8 when<br>
the state shown in FIG. 67B is established coincides<br>
with a value of Xamax write = ^bmax write shown in<br>
FIG. 68. If the relationship between the Yu direction<br>
and Yd direction deviates from the state shown in<br>
FIG. 67B, the electron structure in the light emitting<br>
area 8 and the local distance of light absorption<br>
electrons (the size of local area) slightly change, and<br>
the light absorption wavelength deviates from the value<br>
of amax write = bmax write- BY means of spinner<br>
coating, a relationship between the above Yu direction<br>
and Yd direction is arbitrarily oriented in the<br>
recording layer 3-2 (in unrecorded state) immediately<br>
after formed on the transparent substrate 2-2.<br>
Therefore, the distribution width of light absorption<br>
spectra widens as shown in characteristic (b) of<br>
FIG. 68. In order to form a recording mark, when a<br>
temperature in the recording layer 3-2 is locally<br>
risen, a molecular orientation moves because of a high<br>
temperature, and finally, an almost stable state shown<br>
in FIG. 67B is established in a structural point of<br>
view. Then, the electron structures in the light<br>
emitting area 8 coincide with each other anywhere in<br>
the recording mark, and the current spectra changes to<br>
narrow light absorption spectra in width, as shown in<br>
characteristic (a) of FIG. 68. As a result, the<br>
absorbance at a reproduction wavelength (for example,<br>
405 nm) changes from Al^QS to Ah4Q5-<br>
A description will be made with respect another<br>
advantageous effect of using the light emitting area 8<br>
in an azo metal complex. A dye is utilized for a<br>
cation portion in the case of utilizing a combination<br>
of the anion portion and the cation portion described<br>
previously. Although the chromogenic area in each of<br>
the dyes shown in FIGS. 27 to 29 occupies a portion in<br>
each of the dye structures, a relative occupying<br>
capacitance of the chromogenic area in the recording<br>
layer 3-2 is decreased by combining this area with an<br>
anion portion which does not contribute to the<br>
chromogenic area. Therefore, a light absorption<br>
sectional area is relatively lowered, and a molar<br>
molecule light absorption coefficient is lowered. As a<br>
result, a value of the absorbance at a position of A,max<br>
write shown in FIG. 25 is reduced, and recording<br>
sensitivity is lowered. In contrast, in the case of<br>
utilizing the chromogenic characteristics at the<br>
periphery of the center metal of an azo metal complex<br>
itself described here, the azo metal complex itself<br>
emits light, and thus, there does not exist a redundant<br>
portion which does not contribute to a chromogenic area<br>
such as the anion portion described previously.<br>
Therefore, there is no unnecessary factor that the<br>
relative occupying capacitance of the chromogenic area<br>
decreases. Further, as shown in FIG. 3, the occupying<br>
capacitance of the light emitting area 8 in the azo<br>
metal complex is wide, and thus, the light absorption<br>
sectional area increases, and a value of the molar<br>
molecule light absorption coefficient rises. As a<br>
result, there is provided advantageous effect that the<br>
value of the absorbance at a position of Xmax write<br>
shown in FIG. 25 increases, and the recording<br>
sensitivity is improved.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that the<br>
structural stability of the chromogenic area has been<br>
achieved by optimizing the center metal of the azo<br>
metal complex as a specific method for "8] stabilizing<br>
an electron structure in a chromogenic area so that<br>
structural decomposition relevant to ultraviolet ray or<br>
reproduction light irradiation hardly occurs" described<br>
in "3-2-B] Basic characteristics common to organic dye<br>
recording material in the invention".<br>
It is known that metal ions have their unique<br>
ionization tendency. These metal atoms are arranged in<br>
stronger order of ionization tendency, i.e., Na &gt; Mg &gt;<br>
Al &gt; Zn &gt; Fe &gt; Ni &gt; Cu &gt; Hg &gt; Ag &gt; Au. The ionization<br>
tendency of the metal atoms represents "nature of metal<br>
radiating electrons to form positive ions".<br>
After a variety of metal atoms has been<br>
incorporated as the center metal of the azo metal<br>
complex having the structure shown in FIG. 3, where<br>
reproduction stability (stability of chromogenic<br>
characteristics when a light beam in the vicinity of<br>
405 nm is repeatedly irradiated with reproduction<br>
power) is repeatedly checked, it has been found that<br>
the metal atoms with high ionization tendency radiates<br>
electrons more remarkably and are easily decoupled; and<br>
the light emitting area 8 is easily destroyed. As a<br>
result of a number of tests, in order to ensure<br>
structural stabilization of the chromogenic area, it<br>
has been found desirable to use a metal material (Ni,<br>
Cu, Hg, Ag, Au) after nickel (Ni) as the center metal.<br>
Further, from the viewpoint of "structural stability of<br>
high chromogenic area", "low price", and "use safety",<br>
it is the most desirable to use copper (Cu) as the<br>
center metal as the present embodiment. In the present<br>
embodiment, any of CH3, CxHy, H, Cl, F, NC&gt;2, S02, and<br>
S02NHCH3 is used as Rl, R2, R3, R4, or R5 which is a<br>
side chain shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Now, a description will be given with respect to a<br>
method for forming an organic dye recording material<br>
having a molecular structure shown in FIG. 3 as the<br>
recording layer 3-2 on a transparent substrate 2-2.<br>
The powdered organic dye recording material of 1.49 g<br>
is dissolved in 100 nm of TFP (tetrafluoro propanol)<br>
which is a fluorine alcohol based solvent. The above<br>
numeric value denotes that 1.4 wt% is obtained as a<br>
mixture ratio, and an actual use amount changes<br>
depending on a manufacture amount of the write-once<br>
type information storage medium. It is desirable that<br>
the mixture ratio ranges from 1.2 wt% to 1.5 wt%. As a<br>
solvent, it is conditionally mandatory that a surface<br>
of the transparent substrate 2-2 made of a<br>
polycarbonate resin is not dissolved, and the above<br>
described alcohol based solvent is used. Because the<br>
above TFP (tetrafluoro propanol) has polarity, the<br>
solubility of the powdered organic dye recording<br>
material is improved. While the transparent substrate<br>
2-2 on a spindle motor is rotated, the organic dye<br>
recording material dissolved in the solvent is applied<br>
to the center part of the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
until the solvent has evaporated after the material has<br>
been spread by utilizing a centrifugal force, and then,<br>
the recording layer 3-2 is compressed in accordance<br>
with a baking process for increasing the entire<br>
temperature.<br>
FIG. 69 shows a third application example in which<br>
a basic principle of the second application example in<br>
the present embodiment is applied to the "H-L"<br>
recording film. The maximum absorption wavelength<br>
amax write °f absorption spectra (a) after recorded<br>
(in recording mark) is equalized with respect to the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength A,bmax Write °f absorption<br>
spectra (b) before recorded (in unrecorded area). As<br>
an example of a specific organic dye material which<br>
achieves the third application example, an azo metal<br>
complex is used for an anion portion. For a cation<br>
portion, there is used an "anion/cation type organic<br>
dye recording material" utilizing dye molecules having<br>
an absorption wavelength A,bmax write on a shorter<br>
wavelength side than a reproduction signal wavelength<br>
(for example, 405 nm), as shown in FIG. 69. In this<br>
case, in the azo metal complex shown in FIG. 3, at an a<br>
position or a y position in the D plane, which a<br>
benzene nucleus group produces and a P position or a 8<br>
position in the U plane which a benzene nucleus group<br>
produces, color dye molecules (positively charged<br>
cation portion) are allocated by an inter-ion force.<br>
As in the second application example, a principle of<br>
changing (recording) the light absorption spectra<br>
before and after recorded while keeping unchanged the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength A,bmax write °f the light<br>
absorption spectra (b) before recorded (in unrecorded<br>
area) and the maximum absorption wavelength A,amax Write<br>
of the light absorption spectra (a) after recorded (in<br>
recording mark) utilizes rotation between the U plane<br>
(Yu direction) which the benzene nucleus group produces<br>
and the D plane (Yd direction) which the benzene<br>
nucleus group produces. Further, in the third<br>
application example, the electron coupling force in the<br>
light emitting area 8 is improved, whereby "degradation<br>
of an electron structure (electron orbit) with respect<br>
to electrons which contribute to a chromogenic<br>
phenomenon" hardly occurs. As a result, an area in the<br>
absorption spectra (b) before recorded (in unrecorded<br>
area) (an integration result in spectra wavelength<br>
direction) can be adjusted to conform to an area in the<br>
absorption spectra (a) after recorded (in receding<br>
mark). In this manner, the absorbance "A" at the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength A,amax write in tne<br>
absorption spectra (a) after recorded (in recording<br>
mark) becomes greater than the absorbance "1" at the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength ?ibmax wrj_te before<br>
recorded (in unrecorded area), and a value of A14Q5<br>
rises more significantly than a value of Ah4Q5, as<br>
shown in FIG. 69.<br>
In the case where degradation in the light<br>
emitting area 8 such as discoloring action does not<br>
occur, the area in the absorption spectra before and<br>
after recorded (the integration result in the spectra<br>
wavelength direction) is kept unchanged. Thus, the<br>
absorbance Aamax in the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
amax write increases with a decrease in the width of<br>
the absorption spectra before and after recorded. When<br>
a difference clearly occurs between the value of the<br>
absorbance Al^gs and the value of Ah4Q5 at the<br>
reproduction wavelength of 405 nm (when a reproduction<br>
signal can be detected at a good C/N ratio), from<br>
FIG. 69, it is found necessary to meet a condition that<br>
the value of the absorbance Aamax in the maximum<br>
absorption wavelength Xamax write ^s:<br>
Aamax  1-2 (52)<br>
Further, in order to stably ensure the reliability<br>
of reproduction of a detection signal, it is necessary<br>
to meet a condition:<br>
Aamax &gt; 1.5 (53)<br>
Although there has been shown an example of<br>
providing a structure in which an azo metal complex is<br>
utilized for an anion portion and dyes are utilized for<br>
a cation portion as a specific organic dye recording<br>
material which achieve the third application example,<br>
the invention (third application example) include an<br>
organic dye recording material having "H-L" recording<br>
characteristics; meeting formula (50) or formula (51)<br>
with respect to the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
change amount before and after recorded; and changing<br>
the absorbance at the maximum absorbance wavelength<br>
without being limited thereto, as the specific organic<br>
dye recording material which achieves the third<br>
application example.<br>
Further, a fourth application example is shown in<br>
FIG. 70. In a phase change recording film, "atoms are<br>
allocated in order (in crystalline state) before<br>
recorded", and "atoms are arranged in random (in<br>
amorphous state) after recorded". In the fourth<br>
application example, a feature of this phase change<br>
recording film is combined with a feature that "the<br>
maximum absorption wavelength does not change before<br>
and after recorded" shown in the second application<br>
example. Although a specific organic dye recording<br>
material in the fourth application example has a<br>
structure of utilizing the azo metal complex shown in<br>
the third application example for an anion portion and<br>
dyes for a cation portion as a specific organic<br>
recording material in the fourth application example,<br>
the detailed contained atoms, these application<br>
examples are different from each other in terms of<br>
detailed contained atoms, detailed intra-molecular<br>
structure, or a method for manufacturing the recording<br>
layer 3-2. That is, a time required for solidification<br>
of the recording layer 3-2 is taken by using an organic<br>
solvent which hardly evaporates after applying an<br>
organic dye recording material dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent on the transparent substrate 2-2 by spinner<br>
coating, or alternatively, a temperature of the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2 is increased in advance at<br>
the time of the application, and then, the temperature<br>
of the transparent substrate 2-2 is slowly decreased at<br>
the time of evaporation of an organic solvent, whereby<br>
a contrivance is made so that the intra-molecular (or<br>
inter-molecular) orientation or array can be easily<br>
arranged in order at the stage of the solidification of<br>
the recording layer 3-2. As a result, as shown in<br>
characteristic (b) of FIG. 70, the width of the light<br>
absorption spectra before recorded (in unrecorded area)<br>
becomes narrow. Next, contrivance is made to apply a<br>
recording pulse at the time of recording (for example,<br>
after the inside of the recording layer 3-2 has locally<br>
exceeded an optical characteristic change temperature,<br>
the width of the recording pulse is narrowed instead of<br>
increasing the height of the recording pulse at the<br>
time of applying the same energy so as to provide rapid<br>
cooling), and the intra-molecular (or inter-molecular)<br>
orientation or array after recorded (in recording mark)<br>
is arranged in random. As a result, the width of the<br>
light absorption spectra after recorded (in recording<br>
mark) widens as shown in characteristic (a) of FIG. 70.<br>
A large difference in absorbance "A" before and after<br>
recorded is produced by adjusting a reproduction light<br>
wavelength to conform to a lower end position of the<br>
light absorption spectra. Although an example of<br>
providing a structure in which an azo metal complex is<br>
utilized for an anion portion and dyes are utilized for<br>
a cation portion as a specific organic dye recording<br>
material which achieve the fourth application example,<br>
the invention (fourth application example) include an<br>
organic dye recording material having "H-L" recording<br>
characteristics; meeting formula (50) or formula (51)<br>
with respect to the maximum absorption wavelength<br>
change amount before and after recorded; and changing<br>
the absorbance at the maximum absorbance wavelength<br>
without being limited thereto, as the specific organic<br>
dye recording material which achieves the fourth<br>
application example.<br>
Chapter 6: Description Relating to Pre-groove<br>
shape/pre-pit shape in coating type organic dye<br>
recording film and on light reflection layer interface<br>
6-1) Light reflection layer<br>
As described in "Chapter 0: Description of<br>
Relationship between Use Wavelength and the Present<br>
Embodiment", the present embodiment assumes a range of<br>
355 nm to 455 nm in particular around 405 ran. When the<br>
metal materials each having a high light reflection<br>
factor at this wavelength bandwidth are arranged in<br>
order from the highest light reflection factor, Ag is<br>
in the order of around 96%; Al is in the order of<br>
around 80%, and Rh is in the order of around 80%. In a<br>
write-one type information storage medium using an<br>
organic dye recording material, as shown in FIG. 2B,<br>
the reflection light from the light reflection layer<br>
4-2 is a standard, and thus, the light reflection layer<br>
4-2 requires a high light reflection factor in<br>
characteristics. In particular, in the case of the "HL"<br>
recording film according to the present embodiment,<br>
the light reflection factor in an unrecorded area is<br>
low. Thus, if the light reflection factor in the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 simplex is low, in particular, a<br>
reproduction signal C/N ratio from a pre-pit (emboss)<br>
area is low, lacking the stability at the time of<br>
reproduction. Thus, in particular, it is mandatory<br>
that the light reflection factor in the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 simplex is high. Therefore, in<br>
the present embodiment, in the above wavelength<br>
bandwidth, a material mainly made of Ag (silver) having<br>
the highest reflection factor is used. As a material<br>
for the light reflection layer 4-2, there occurs a<br>
problem that "atoms easily move" or "corrosion easily<br>
occurs" if silver is used alone. To solve the first<br>
problem, when partial alloying is carried out by adding<br>
other atoms, silver atoms hardly move. In the first<br>
embodiment in which other atoms are added, the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 is made of AgNdCu according to the<br>
first embodiment. AgNdCu is in a solid soluble state,<br>
and thus, the reflection factor is slightly lowered<br>
than a state in which silver is used alone. In the<br>
second embodiment in which other atoms are added, the<br>
light reflection layer 4-2 is made of AgPd, and an<br>
electric potential is changed, whereby corrosion hardly<br>
occurs in an electrochemical manner. If the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 corrodes due to silver oxidization<br>
or the like, the light reflection factor is lowered.<br>
In an organic dye recording film having a recording<br>
film structure shown in FIG. 2B, in particular, in the<br>
case of an organic dye recording film shown in "Chapter<br>
3: Description of Characteristics of Organic Dye<br>
Recording Film in the Present Embodiment", in<br>
particular, a light reflection factor on an interface<br>
between the recording layer 3-2 and the light<br>
reflection later 4-2 is very important. If correction<br>
occurs on this interface, the light reflection factor<br>
is lowered, and an optical interface shape blurs. In<br>
addition, the detection signal characteristics from a<br>
track shift detection signal (push-pull signal) or a<br>
wobble signal and a pre-pit (emboss) area are degraded.<br>
In addition, in the case where the width Wg of the pregroove<br>
area 11 is wider than the width Wl of the land<br>
area, a track shift detection signal (push-pull signal)<br>
or a wobble signal is hardly generated, thus increasing<br>
effect of degradation of the light reflection factor on<br>
the interface between the recording layer 3-2 and the<br>
light reflection layer 4-2 due to corrosion. In order<br>
to prevent degradation of the light reflection factor<br>
on this interface, AgBi is used for the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 as the third embodiment. AgBi<br>
forms a very stable phase and prevents degradation of<br>
the light reflection factor on the above interface<br>
because a passive coat film is formed on a surface<br>
(interface between the recording layer 3-2 and the<br>
light reflection layer 4-2). That is, if Bi (bismuth)<br>
is slightly added to Ag, Bi is isolated from the above<br>
interface, the isolated Bi is oxidized. Then, a very<br>
fine film (passive coat film) called oxidized bismuth<br>
is formed to function to preclude internal oxidization.<br>
This passive coat film is formed on the interface, and<br>
forms a very stable phase. Thus, the degradation of a<br>
light reflection factor does not occur, and the<br>
stability of detection signal characteristics from a<br>
track shift detection signal (push-pull signal) or a<br>
wobble signal and a pre-pit (emboss) area is guaranteed<br>
over a long period of time. At a wavelength band<br>
ranging from 355 nm to 455 nm, the silver simplex has<br>
the highest light reflection factor, and the light<br>
reflection factor is lowered as an additive amount of<br>
other atoms is increased. Thus, it is desirable that<br>
an additive amount of Bi atoms in AgBi in the present<br>
embodiment be equal to or smaller than 5 at%. The unit<br>
of at% used here denotes atomic percent, and indicates<br>
that five Bi atoms exist in a total atom number 100 of<br>
AgBi, for example. When characteristics have been<br>
evaluated by actually producing the passive coat film,<br>
it has found that a passive coat film can be produced<br>
as long as an additive amount of Bi atoms is equal to<br>
or greater than 0.5 at%. Based on a result of this<br>
evaluation, an additive amount of Bi atoms in the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 in the present embodiment is<br>
defined as 1 at%. In this third embodiment, only one<br>
atom Bi is added, and an additive amount of atoms can<br>
be reduced as compared with AgNdCu according to the<br>
first embodiment (a case in which two types of atoms Nd<br>
and Cu is added in Ag), and AgBi can increase the light<br>
reflection factor more significantly than AgNdCu. As a<br>
result, even in the case of the "H-L" recording film<br>
according to the present embodiment or in the case<br>
where the width Wg of the pre-groove area 11 is wider<br>
than the with Wl of the land area, as shown in FIGS. 8B<br>
and 8C, a detection signal can be stably obtained from<br>
a track shift detection signal (push-pull signal) or a<br>
wobble signal and a pre-pit (emboss) area with high<br>
precision. The third embodiment is not limited to<br>
AgBi, and a ternary system including AgMg, AgNi, AgGa,<br>
AgNx, AgCo, AgAl or the atoms described previously may<br>
be used as a silver allow which produces a passive coat<br>
film. The thickness of this light reflection layer 4-2<br>
is set in the range of 5 nm to 200 nm. If the<br>
thickness is smaller than 5 nm, the light reflection<br>
layer 4-2 is not uniform, and is formed in a land<br>
shape. Therefore, the thickness of the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 is set to 5 nm. When an AgBi film<br>
is equal to or smaller than 80 nm in thickness, the<br>
film permeates to its back side. Thus, in the case of<br>
a one-sided single recording layer, the thickness is<br>
set in the range of 80 nm to 200 nm, and preferably, in<br>
the range of 100 nm to 150 nm. In the case of a onesided<br>
double recording layer, the thickness is set in<br>
the range of 5 nm to 15 nm.<br>
Write-once type information storage mediums having<br>
high density and used for a method for recording<br>
information in a storage medium which uses an organic<br>
dye material, the storage mediums carrying out<br>
recording and reproduction by using a light beam of<br>
620 nm or less in wavelength, include: a one-sided<br>
single-layer medium as shown in FIG. IB; and a onesided<br>
double-layer medium as shown in FIG. 1C. The<br>
one-sided single-layer medium is sequentially composed<br>
of a transparent substrate 2-2, a recording layer<br>
(recording film) 3-2, and a light reflection layer<br>
(light reflection film) 4-2 from a light incident side.<br>
A storage medium (referred to as LO) close to the light<br>
incident side of the one-sided double-layer medium is<br>
sequentially composed of the transparent substrate 2-2,<br>
the recording layer 3-2, and a semipermeable light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 from the light incident side. A<br>
storage medium (referred to as LI) distant from the<br>
light incident side is sequentially composed of the<br>
recording layer 3-2, the light reflection layer 4-2,<br>
and the substrate 2-2 from the light incident side. A<br>
layer for optically separating two layers, a so called<br>
interlayer separating layer (interlayer separation<br>
film) 7-1, is formed between the medium LO and the<br>
medium LI. In addition, the transparent substrate 2-2<br>
of the medium LI may not be always transparent, and an<br>
opaque substrate may be used. In the following<br>
description, in the case where a layer is merely<br>
referred to as a light reflection layer, it denotes a<br>
generic name of the light reflection layer 4-1 and the<br>
semipermeable light reflection layer 4-2. In order to<br>
obtain high signal characteristics on an entire surface<br>
of an optical storage medium, there is a need for<br>
providing a high reflectivity in a state in which the<br>
transparent substrate 2-2, the recording layer 3-2, and<br>
the light reflection layer 4-2 have been laminated.<br>
Thus, it is desirable that a light reflection film<br>
simplex have a high reflectivity. In order to achieve<br>
this, a material mainly made of Ag (silver) having the<br>
highest reflectivity is used in the above wavelength<br>
band (405 nm and its proximity, for example, 355 nm to<br>
455 nm).<br>
On the other hand, as described in section 6-1),<br>
in a silver simplex used as a material for a light<br>
reflection film, there occurs a problem that light<br>
reflection characteristics are changed by the fact that<br>
"atoms easily move" and "corrosion easily occurs", and<br>
the performance is degraded in terms of information<br>
repetition reproduction, count, and storage service<br>
life. As a means for solving these problems, a method<br>
using a variety of silver alloys is conventionally<br>
known. However, in the storage medium according to the<br>
present invention, there is used an organic dye<br>
recording material which has not been used<br>
conventionally. Thus, in the conventional method, the<br>
above-described problems have not been solved.<br>
A conventionally known method for preventing<br>
movement of single silver atoms in a light reflection<br>
film includes a method for adding to silver an element<br>
which has a pinning effect. On the other hand, there<br>
has not been clarified an element which prevents<br>
movement of single silver atoms without lowering a<br>
reflectivity in the above-described wavelength band or<br>
significantly lowering thermal characteristics. With<br>
respect to a disclosed conventional technique, as long<br>
as an amount of additives is not particularly large,<br>
there is substantially no advantageous effect. On the<br>
other hand, there are two methods for preventing<br>
corrosion of silver in a reflection film; (1) a<br>
electrochemical method; and (2) a method for forming a<br>
passive coat on an interface. With respect to (1) the<br>
electrochemical method, as long as an amount of<br>
additives is not particularly large, there is<br>
substantially no advantageous effect. In addition,<br>
with respect to (2) the method for forming the passive<br>
coat on the interface as well, there has not been<br>
achieved a method for forming a rigid passive coat<br>
without lowering the reflectivity in the abovedescribed<br>
wavelength band or significantly lowering the<br>
thermal characteristics. This is because, in order to<br>
complete a storage medium embodiment, characteristics<br>
greatly depend on what configuration of a storage<br>
medium is used, and thus, it is impossible to obtain<br>
problems to be solved and a proper means for solving<br>
these problems merely by investigating general material<br>
characteristics. In addition, in the case of the<br>
present embodiment, in addition to these problems, it<br>
has been difficult to achieve the embodiment by the use<br>
of the organic dye recording material which has not<br>
been used conventionally, as described below.<br>
In order to prevent movement of single silver<br>
atoms and prevent corrosion of silver in a reflection<br>
film without lowering the reflectivity in the abovedescribed<br>
waveform band or without significantly<br>
lowering the thermal characteristics, the present<br>
embodiment is featured by a light reflection layer of a<br>
storage medium shown in FIGS. IB and 1C using an<br>
organic dye material recorded with a light beam of<br>
620 nm or less in wavelength in which prevention layers<br>
8, 8-1, and 8-2 which prevent a characteristic change<br>
of a light reflection layer are provided between a<br>
light reflection layer and a recording layer. The<br>
causes for characteristic change are movement of atoms<br>
and reaction (corrosion). The reaction used here<br>
includes a chemical reaction or performance degradation<br>
caused by a light reflection layer coming into contact<br>
with an organic dye material which is a recording film.<br>
The prevention layer used here may not be formed to<br>
have a finite thickness (passive coat formed on<br>
interface), and may be formed as a layer<br>
(electrochemical layer) having electrically different<br>
characteristics, the layer being formed by a<br>
semiconductor apparatus or a semiconductor device and<br>
the like.<br>
The light reflection layer used here is composed<br>
essentially of silver Ag, contains at least one type of<br>
additive elements selected from: aluminum Al; gold Au;<br>
bismuth Bi; calcium Ca; cerium Ce, cobalt Co, gallium<br>
Ga, lanthanum La; magnesium Mg; nitrogen N; nickel Ni;<br>
neodium Nd; palladium Pd; yttrium Y; tungsten W, and<br>
zirconium Zr, and ranges from 0.05 at% to 5 at% in<br>
total of additive elements. It is impossible to avoid<br>
entry of a very small amount of elements into Ag and<br>
additive elements used as a base material for a<br>
reflection film material. With respect to these<br>
elements, even if a very small amount thereof is<br>
detected by analysis, it is impossible to say they are<br>
a different material. Therefore, this material is not<br>
said to be different from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For example, let us consider a light reflection<br>
layer using AgBi. AgBi forms a passive coat on a<br>
surface (interface between recording layer 3-2 and<br>
light reflection layer 4-2). Thus, this element forms<br>
a very high stable phase, and prevents degradation of<br>
the light reflectivity on the above-described<br>
interface. That is, if a small amount of Bi (bismuth)<br>
is added to Ag, Bi floats on the interface, and is<br>
oxidized. Then, a very delicate film (passive coat)<br>
called bismuth oxide is formed, and functions to stop<br>
internal oxidization or reaction, or alternatively,<br>
degradation of the reflection film. In addition, in a<br>
combination with the organic dye recording material<br>
used in the present embodiment, it has been found that<br>
there is attained advantageous effect of preventing<br>
movement of single silver atoms without lowering the<br>
reflectivity in the above-described wavelength band or<br>
significantly lowering the thermal characteristics. In<br>
general, the concentration of additive elements in an<br>
Ag alloy is greatly influenced by a reflectivity or<br>
optical characteristics, thermal characteristics, and<br>
easiness of movement of single silver atoms.<br>
Therefore, an Ag alloy in which a concentration change<br>
occurs is considered to be generally low in<br>
advantageous effect of preventing movement of single<br>
silver atoms without lowering the reflectivity or<br>
significantly lowering the thermal characteristics. In<br>
the present embodiment, it is considered that<br>
advantageous effect has been attained in a<br>
configuration which seems to have been ineffective<br>
conventionally because a specific organic dye material<br>
is used. Therefore, the present invention is greatly<br>
featured by a light reflection layer of a storage<br>
medium using an organic dye material recorded with a<br>
light beam of 620 nm or less in wavelength in which<br>
there is formed a prevention layer which prevents<br>
reaction between a light reflection layer and a<br>
recording layer caused by the light reflection layer<br>
coming into contact with an organic dye material or a<br>
characteristic change or degradation of an optical<br>
reflection layer. These advantageous effects are<br>
considered as being attained by combining the organic<br>
dye material and the Ag alloy according to the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
In addition, apart from Bi, it has been found that<br>
similar advantageous effect is attained in Ca, Ce, Co,<br>
Ga, Ni, La, Mg, W, and Zr (elements for forming a<br>
passive coat including Bi is referred to as additive<br>
elements of group 1). On the other hand, in Al, Au,<br>
Pd, Pt, and Rh (referred to as additive elements of<br>
group 2), electrochemically advantageous effect is<br>
strong. Thus, it is effective to use these additive<br>
elements of group 2 in combination with the additive<br>
elements of group 1. In addition, with respect to N<br>
(nitrogen), a reaction product with Ag-N serves as part<br>
of a passive coat. Thus, the passive coat may be<br>
formed of a plurality of layers without being limited<br>
to a single layer. In addition to the additive<br>
elements of group 1, it is effective to add Cu, Nd, or<br>
Y (referred to as additive elements of group 3). With<br>
respect to group 2, group 3, and N, even if<br>
comparatively large amounts of these elements are added<br>
or reacted, no precipitation occurs, and solid solution<br>
or reaction with Ag can be obtained. Thus, if an<br>
amount of additives increases, the reflectivity or<br>
thermal conductivity is rapidly lowered. Therefore,<br>
careful consideration is required for the amount of<br>
additives and adding process. Among them, for example,<br>
in the case where AgAl is used, if an amount of<br>
additives increases, the lowering of the reflectivity<br>
and thermal conductivity of the reflection film becomes<br>
very substantial.<br>
When the content of additive elements 0.05 at% or<br>
less, advantageous effect is low. In addition, when it<br>
is 5 at% or more, advantageous effect is low. In the<br>
case where an amount of additive elements is 0.05 at%<br>
or less, in particular, performance of forming a<br>
passive coat and preventing corrosion is lowered.<br>
Conversely, in the case where an amount of additive<br>
elements is 5 at% or more, the lowering of the<br>
reflectivity and thermal characteristics becomes<br>
substantial. The above-described amount of additive<br>
elements denotes an amount analyzed by forming a<br>
reflection film simplex on a substrate on which no<br>
reaction occurs or a substrate composed of elements<br>
separated by analysis even if a reaction occurs.<br>
Therefore, in the storage medium, the additive elements<br>
move from the inside of the reflection film onto an<br>
interface of an organic dye material and the like,<br>
thereby forming a passive coat, and thus, locally<br>
different portions may exist. Therefore, an amount of<br>
additive elements indicates a value obtained by<br>
analyzing an amount added to the reflection layer<br>
without forming a passive coat. With respect to the<br>
concentration of the additive elements in the<br>
reflection layer, the additive elements occasionally<br>
move onto an interface with an opposite adhesive layer<br>
in addition to moving onto the interface with the<br>
organic dye recording material which is a recording<br>
layer, thereby forming a passive coat. To which<br>
interface a larger amount of the elements move depends<br>
on type of organic dye recording material to be used,<br>
Ag alloy of reflection layer to be used and type of<br>
adhesive to be used.<br>
6-2) Description relating to pre-pit shape in<br>
coating type organic dye recording film and on light<br>
reflection layer interface<br>
In an H format according to the present<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 35A, 35B and 35C, the<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI is provided. In this area,<br>
an emboss pit area 211 is provided, and, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 71A and 71B, information is recorded in advance<br>
in the form of a pre-bit. A reproduction signal in<br>
this area is adjusted to conform to reproduction signal<br>
characteristics from a read-only type information<br>
storage medium, and a signal processor circuit in an<br>
information reproducing apparatus or an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 11 is<br>
compatible with a read-only type information storage<br>
medium and a write-once type information storage<br>
medium. A definition relevant to a signal detected<br>
from this area is adjusted to conform with a definition<br>
of "3-4): Description of characteristics relating to<br>
"H-L" recording film in the invention". That is, a<br>
reproduction signal amount from the space area 14<br>
having a sufficiently large length (11T) is defined as<br>
IllHf and a reproduction signal from the pre-pit<br>
(emboss) area 13 having a sufficiently large length<br>
 (11T) is defined as IHL- In addition, a differential<br>
value between these amounts is defined as !]_]_ = IHH ~<br>
IHL- n the present embodiment, in accordance with<br>
the reproduction signal characteristics from the<br>
read-only type information storage medium, the<br>
reproduction signal in this area is set to be:<br>
Ill/Inn  0.3 (54)<br>
and desirably, is set to be:<br>
I11/I11H &gt; O-5 (55)<br>
When a repetitive signal amplitude of the space<br>
area 14 relevant to the pre-pit (emboss) area 13 having<br>
a 2t length is defined as 12, the amplitude is set to<br>
be:<br>
I2/In &gt; 0.5 (56)<br>
and desirably, is set to be:<br>
I2/In &gt; 0.7 (57)<br>
A description will be given with respect to a<br>
physical condition for meeting the above formula (54)<br>
or formula (55).<br>
As has been described in FIG. 2B, the signal<br>
characteristics from a pre-pit are mainly dependent on<br>
the reflection in the light reflection layer 4-2.<br>
Therefore, the reproduction signal amplitude value _]_<br>
is determined depending on a step amount Hpr between<br>
the space area 14 and the pre-pit (emboss) area 13 in<br>
the light reflection layer 4-2. When optical<br>
approximation calculation is made, this step amount<br>
Hpr, with respect to a reproduction light wavelength A,<br>
and a refractive index n32 in tne recording layer 3-2,<br>
has the following relationship:<br>
111 « sin2{(27i x Hpr x n32)/M (58)<br>
From formula (58), it is found that In becomes<br>
maximal when Hpr ^ X/(4 x n32). In order to meet<br>
formula (54) or formula (55), from formula (58), it is<br>
necessary to meet:<br>
Hpr &gt; K/ (12 x n32) (59)<br>
and desirably,<br>
Hpr &gt; A,/(6 x n32) (60)<br>
As described in "Chapter 0: Description of<br>
Relationship between Use Wavelength and the Present<br>
Embodiment", X = 355 nm to 455 nm is used in the<br>
embodiment, and as described in "2-1) Difference in<br>
Principle of Recording/Recording Film and Difference in<br>
Basic Concept Relating to Generation of Reproduction<br>
Signal", n32 = 1.4 to 1.9 is established. Thus, when<br>
this value is substituted into formula (59) or formula<br>
(60), a step is produced so as to meet a condition:<br>
Hpr &gt; 15.6 nm (62)<br>
and desirably,<br>
Hpr &gt; 31.1 nm (63)<br>
In the conventional write-once type information<br>
storage medium, as shown in FIG. 71B, the thickness of<br>
the recording layer 3-2 is small in the space area 14,<br>
and thus, a step on an interface between the light<br>
reflection layer 4-2 and the recording layer 3-2 is<br>
small, and formula (62) has not successfully met. In<br>
contrast, in the present embodiment, a contrivance has<br>
been made to ensure that a relationship between the<br>
thickness Dg of the recording layer 3-2 in the pre-pit<br>
(emboss) area 13 and the thickness Dl of the recording<br>
layer 3-2 in the space area 14 conform with a condition<br>
described in "3-2-E] Basic characteristics relating to<br>
thickness distribution of recording layer in the<br>
present embodiment for definition of parameters". As a<br>
result, as shown in FIG. 71B, a sufficiently large step<br>
Hpr which meets formula (62) or formula (63) has been<br>
successfully provided.<br>
By carrying out optical approximation discussion<br>
as described above, in the present embodiment, in order<br>
to have sufficient resolution of a reproduction signal<br>
so as to meet formula (56) or formula (57), a<br>
contrivance is made so that the width Wp of the pre-pit<br>
(emboss) area 13 is equal to or smaller than half of<br>
track pitches as shown in FIG. 71B, and a reproduction<br>
signal from the pre-pit (emboss) area 13 can be largely<br>
taken.<br>
6-3) Description relating to pre-groove shape in<br>
coating type organic dye recording film and on light<br>
reflection layer interface:<br>
Chapter 7: Description of H Format<br>
Now, an H format in the present embodiment will be<br>
described here.<br>
FIG. 31 shows a structure and dimensions of an<br>
information storage medium in the present embodiment.<br>
As embodiments, there are explicitly shown three types<br>
of embodiments of information storage mediums such as:<br>
- "read-only type information storage medium" used<br>
exclusively for reproduction in which recording cannot<br>
be carried out;<br>
- "write-once type information storage medium"<br>
capable of additional recording; and<br>
- "rewritable type information storage medium"<br>
capable of rewriting or recording any times<br>
As shown in FIG. 31, the above three types of<br>
information storage mediums are common to each other in<br>
a majority of structure and dimensions. In all of the<br>
three types of information storage mediums, from their<br>
inner periphery side, a burst cutting area BCA, a<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI, a connection area CNA, a<br>
data lead-in area DTLSI, and a data area DTA have been<br>
arranged. All the mediums other than an OPT type readonly<br>
medium is featured in that a data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO is arranged at the outer periphery. As described<br>
later, in the OPT type read-only medium, a middle area<br>
MDA is arranged at the outer periphery. In either of<br>
the write-once type and rewritable type mediums, the<br>
inside of this area is for read-only (additional<br>
writing disabled). In the read-only type information<br>
storage medium, information is recorded in the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI in the form of emboss (pre-pit). In<br>
contrast, in the write-once type and the rewritable<br>
type information storage medium, new information can be<br>
additionally written (rewritten in the rewritable type)<br>
by forming a recording mark in the data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI. As described later, in the write-once type and<br>
rewritable type information storage medium, in the data<br>
lead-out area DTLDO, there coexist an area in which<br>
additional writing can be carried out (rewriting can be<br>
carried out in the rewritable type) and a read-only<br>
area in which information is recorded in the form of<br>
emboss (pre-pit). As described previously, in the data<br>
area DTA, data lead-in area DTLVI, data lead-out area<br>
DTSDO, and middle area MDA shown in FIG. 31, high<br>
density of the information storage medium is achieved<br>
(in particular, line density is improved) by using a<br>
PRML (Partial Response Maximum Likelihood) method for<br>
reproduction of signals recorded therein. In addition,<br>
in the system lead-in area SYLDI and the system leadout<br>
area SYLDO, compatibility with a current DVD is<br>
realized and the stability of reproduction is improved<br>
by using a slice level detecting system for<br>
reproduction of signals recorded therein.<br>
Unlike the current DVD specification, in the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 31, the burst cutting area BCA<br>
and system lead-in area SYLDI are separated from each<br>
other in location without being superimposed on each<br>
other. These areas are physically separated from each<br>
other, thereby making it possible to prevent<br>
interference between the information recorded in the<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI at the time of information<br>
reproduction and the information recorded in the burst<br>
cutting area BCA and to allocate information<br>
reproduction with high precision.<br>
In the case where an "L-H" type recording film has<br>
been used as another embodiment, there is a method for<br>
forming fine irregularities in advance in location for<br>
allocating the burst cutting area BCA. A description<br>
will be given later with respect to information on<br>
polarity (identification of "H-L" or "L-H") of a<br>
recording mark which exists at a 192nd byte in FIG. 42.<br>
In this section, a description will be given with<br>
respect to the present embodiment in which an "L-H"<br>
recording film as well as the "H-L" recording film is<br>
also incorporated in a specification and a scope of<br>
selecting the recording film is widened to enable high<br>
speed recording or supply of an inexpensive medium. As<br>
described later, the present embodiment also considers<br>
a case of using the "L-H" recording film. Data<br>
recorded in the burst cutting area BCA (barcode data)<br>
is formed by locally carrying out laser exposure to a<br>
recording film. As shown in FIGS. 35A, 35B and 35C,<br>
the system lead-in area SYLDI is formed of the emboss<br>
bit area 211, and thus, the reproduction signal from<br>
the system lead-in area SYLDI appears in a direction in<br>
which a light reflection amount decreases as compared<br>
with a light reflection level from the mirror surface<br>
210. If while the burst cutting area BCA is formed as<br>
the mirror surface 210, in the case where the "L-H"<br>
recording film has been used, a reproduction signal<br>
from the data recorded in the burst cutting area BCA<br>
appears in a direction in which a light reflection<br>
amount increases more significantly than a light<br>
reflection level from the mirror surface 210 (in an<br>
unrecorded state). As a result, a significant step<br>
occurs between a position (amplitude level) of a<br>
maximum level and a minimum level of the reproduction<br>
signal from the data recorded in the burst cutting area<br>
BCA and a position (amplitude level) of a maximum level<br>
and a minimum level of the reproduction signal from the<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI. As described later with<br>
respect to FIGS. 35A, 35B and 35C, an information<br>
reproducing apparatus or an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus carry out processing in<br>
accordance with the steps of:<br>
1) reproducing information in the burst cutting<br>
area BCA;<br>
2) reproducing information contained in a<br>
information data zone CDZ in the system lead-in area<br>
SYLDI;<br>
3) reproducing information contained in the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI (in the case of write-once type or<br>
rewriting type);<br>
4) readjusting (optimizing) a reproduction circuit<br>
constant in a reference code recording zone RCZ; and<br>
5) reproducing information recorded in the data<br>
area DTA or recording new information.<br>
Thus, if there exists a large step between a<br>
reproduction signal amplitude level from the data<br>
formed in the burst cutting area BCA and a reproduction<br>
signal amplitude level from the system lead-in area<br>
SYLDI, there occurs a problem that the reliability of<br>
information reproduction is lowered. In order to solve<br>
this problem, in the case where the "L-H" recording<br>
film is used as a recording film, the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that fine irregularities are<br>
formed in advance in thus burst cutting area BCA. When<br>
such fine irregularities are formed, the light<br>
reflection level becomes lower than that from the<br>
mirror surface 210 due to a light interference effect<br>
at the stage prior to recording data (barcode data) by<br>
local laser exposure. Then, there is attained an<br>
advantageous effect that a step is remarkably decreased<br>
between a reproduction signal amplitude level<br>
(detection level) from the data formed in the burst<br>
cutting area BCA and a reproduction signal amplitude<br>
level (detection level) from the system lead-in area<br>
SYLDI; the reliability of information reproduction is<br>
improved; and processing going from the above item 1)<br>
to item 2) is facilitated. In the case of using the<br>
"L-H" recording film, the specific contents of fine<br>
irregularities formed in advance in the burst cutting<br>
area BCA include the emboss pit area 211 like the<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI. Another embodiment includes<br>
a method for forming the groove area 214 or the land<br>
area and the groove area 213 like the data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI or data area DTA. As has been described in the<br>
description of embodiments in which the system lead-in<br>
area SYSDI and burst cutting area BCA are separately<br>
arranged, if the burst cutting area BCA and the emboss<br>
bit area 211 overlaps each other, there increases a<br>
noise component from the data provided in the burst<br>
cutting area BCA due to unnecessary interference to a<br>
reproduction signal. When the groove area 214 or the<br>
land area and groove area 213 is formed without forming<br>
the emboss pit area 211 as an embodiment of the fine<br>
irregularities in the burst cutting area BCA, there is<br>
attained an advantageous effect that there decreases a<br>
noise component from the data formed in the burst<br>
cutting area BCA due to unnecessary interference to a<br>
reproduction signal and the quality of a reproduction<br>
signal is improved. When track pitches of the groove<br>
area 214 or the land area and groove area 213 formed in<br>
the burst cutting area BCA are adjusted to conform with<br>
the those of the system lead-in area SYLDI, there is<br>
attained an advantageous effect that the manufacturing<br>
performance of the information storage medium is<br>
improved. That is, at the time of original master<br>
manufacturing of the information storage medium, emboss<br>
pits in the system lead-in area are produced while a<br>
feed motor speed is made constant. At this time, the<br>
track pitches of the groove area 214 or the land area<br>
and groove area 213 formed in the burst cutting area<br>
BCA are adjusted to conform with those of the emboss<br>
pits in the system lead-in area SYLDI, thereby making<br>
it possible to continuously maintain a constant motor<br>
speed in the burst cutting area BCA and the system<br>
lead-in area SYLDI. Thus, there is no need for<br>
changing the speed of the feed motor midway, and thus,<br>
the pitch non-uniformity hardly occurs, and the<br>
manufacturing performance of the information storage<br>
medium is improved.<br>
FIG. 32 shows parameter values according to the<br>
present embodiment in a read-only type information<br>
storage medium; FIG. 33 shows parameter values<br>
according to the present embodiment in a write-once<br>
type information storage medium; and FIG. 34 shows<br>
parameter values according to the present embodiment in<br>
a rewritable type information storage medium. As is<br>
evident in comparison between FIG. 32 or 33 and FIG. 34<br>
(in particular, in comparison of section (B)), the<br>
rewritable type information storage medium has higher<br>
recording capacity than the read-only type or<br>
write-once type information storage medium by narrowing<br>
track pitches and line density (data bit length). As<br>
described later, in the rewritable type information<br>
storage medium, the track pitches are narrowed by<br>
reducing effect of a cross-talk of the adjacent tracks<br>
by employing land-groove recording. Alternatively, any<br>
of the read-only type information storage medium,<br>
write-once information storage medium, and rewritabletype<br>
information storage medium is featured in that the<br>
data bit length and track pitches (corresponding to<br>
recording density) of the system lead-in/system leadout<br>
areas SYLDI/SYLDO are greater than those of the<br>
data lead-in/data lead-out area DTLDI/DTLDO (in that<br>
the recording density is low). The data bit length and<br>
track pitches of the system lead-in/system lead-out<br>
areas SYLDI/SYLDO are close to the values of the<br>
current DVD lead-in area, thereby realizing<br>
compatibility with the current DVD. In the present<br>
embodiment as well, like the current DVD-R, an emboss<br>
step in the system lead-in/system lead-out areas<br>
SYLDI/SYLDO of the write-once type information storage<br>
medium is shallowly defined. In this manner, there is<br>
attained advantageous effect that a depth of a pregroove<br>
of the write-once information storage medium is<br>
shallowly defined and a degree of modulation of a<br>
reproduction signal from a recording mark formed on a<br>
pre-groove by additional writing is increased. In<br>
contrast, as a counteraction against it, there occurs a<br>
problem that the degree of modulation of the<br>
reproduction signal from the system lead-in/system<br>
lead-out areas SYLDI/SYLDO decreases. In order to<br>
solve this problem, the data bit length (and track<br>
pitches) of system lead-in/system lead-out areas<br>
SYLDI/SYLDO are roughened and a repetition frequency of<br>
pits and spaces at the narrowest position is isolated<br>
(significantly reduced) from an optical shutdown<br>
frequency of an MTF (Modulation Transfer Function) of a<br>
reproduction objective lens, thereby making it possible<br>
to increase the reproduction signal amplitude from the<br>
system lead-in/system lead-out areas SYLDI/SYLDO and to<br>
stabilize reproduction.<br>
FIGS. 35A, 35B and 35C show a comparison of<br>
detailed data structure in a system lead-in area SYLDI<br>
and a data lead-in area DTLDI in a variety of<br>
information storage mediums. FIG. 35A shows a data<br>
structure of a read-only type information storage<br>
medium; FIG. 35B shows a data structure of a<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium; and<br>
FIG. 35C shows a data structure of a write-once type<br>
information storage medium.<br>
As shown in FIG. 35A, except that only a<br>
connection zone CNZ is formed as a mirror surface 210,<br>
the read-only type information storage medium is<br>
featured in that the emboss pit area 211 having emboss<br>
pits formed therein is provided in all of the system<br>
lead-in area SYLDI and data lead-in area DTLDI and data<br>
area DTA. The emboss pit area 211 is provided in the<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI, and the connection zone CNZ<br>
is provided in the mirror surface 210. As shown in<br>
FIG. 35B, the rewritable-type information storage<br>
medium is featured in that the land area and the groove<br>
area 213 are formed in the data lead-in area DTLSI and<br>
the data area DTA. The write-once type information<br>
storage medium is featured in that the groove area 214<br>
is formed in the data lead-in area DTLDI and the data<br>
area DTA. Information is recorded by forming a<br>
recording mark in the land area and the groove area 213<br>
or groove area 214.<br>
The initial zone INZ indicates a start position of<br>
the system lead-in area SYLDI. As significant<br>
information recorded in the initial zone INZ, there is<br>
discretely arranged data ID (Identification Data)<br>
information including information on physical sector<br>
numbers or logical sector numbers described previously.<br>
As described later, one physical sector records<br>
information on a data frame structure composed of data<br>
ID, IED (ID Error Detection code), main data for<br>
recording user information, and EDC (Error detection<br>
code); and the initial zone records information on the<br>
above described data frame structure. However, in the<br>
initial zone INZ, all the information on the main data<br>
for recording the user information is all set to "OOh",<br>
and thus, the significant information contained in the<br>
initial zone INZ is only data ID information. A<br>
current location can be recognized from the information<br>
on physical sector numbers or logical sector numbers<br>
recorded therein. That is, when an information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141 shown in FIG. 11 starts<br>
information reproduction from an information storage<br>
medium, in the case where reproduction has been started<br>
from the information contained in the initial zone INZ,<br>
first, the information on physical sector numbers or<br>
logical sector numbers recorded in the data ID<br>
information is sampled, and the sampled information is<br>
moved to the control data, zone CDZ while the current<br>
location in the information storage medium is checked.<br>
A buffer zone 1 BFZl and a buffer zone 2 BFZ2 each<br>
are composed of 32 ECC blocks. As shown in FIGS. 32,<br>
33 and 34, one ECC block corresponds to 1024 physical<br>
sectors. In the buffer zone I BFZl and the buffer zone<br>
2 BFZ2 as well, like the initial zone INZ, main data<br>
information is set to all "OOh".<br>
The connection zone CNZ which exists in a CNA<br>
(Connection Area) is an area for physically separating<br>
the system lead-in area SYLDI and the data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI from each other. This area is provided as a<br>
mirror surface on which no emboss pit or pre-groove<br>
exists.<br>
An RCZ (Reference code zone) of the read-only type<br>
information storage medium and the write-once type<br>
information storage medium each is an area used for<br>
reproduction circuit tuning of a reproducing apparatus<br>
(for automatic adjustment of tap coefficient values at<br>
the time of adaptive equalization carried out in the<br>
tap controller 332 shown in FIG. 15) , wherein<br>
information on the data frame structure described<br>
previously is recorded. A length of the reference code<br>
is one ECC block (= 32 sectors). The present<br>
embodiment is featured in that the RCZ (Reference code<br>
zone) of the read-only type information storage medium<br>
and the write-once information storage medium each is<br>
arranged adjacent to a DTA (data area). In any of the<br>
structures of the current DVD-ROM disk and the current<br>
DVD-R disk as well, a control data zone is arranged<br>
between the reference code zone and data area, and the<br>
reference code zone and the data area are separated<br>
from each other. If the reference code zone and data<br>
area are separated from each other, a tilt amount or a<br>
light reflection factor of the information storage<br>
medium or the recording sensitivity of a recording film<br>
(in the case of the write-once information storage<br>
medium) slightly changes. Therefore, there occurs a<br>
problem that an optimal circuit constant in the data<br>
area is distorted even if a circuit constant of the<br>
reproducing apparatus is adjusted. In order to solve<br>
the above described problem, when the RCZ (reference<br>
code zone) is arranged adjacent to the DTA (data area),<br>
in the case where the circuit constant of the<br>
information reproducing apparatus has been optimized in<br>
the RCZ (reference code zone), an optimized state is<br>
maintained by the same circuit constant in the DTA<br>
(data area). In the case where an attempt is made to<br>
precisely reproduce a signal in arbitrary location in<br>
the DTA (data area), it becomes possible to reproduce a<br>
signal at a target position very precisely in<br>
accordance with the steps of:<br>
1) optimizing a circuit constant of the<br>
information reproducing apparatus in the RCZ (reference<br>
code zone);<br>
2) optimizing a circuit constant of the<br>
information reproducing apparatus again while<br>
reproducing a portion which is the closest to the<br>
reference code zone RCZ in the data area DTA;<br>
3) optimizing a circuit constant once again while<br>
reproducing information at an intermediate position<br>
between a target position in the data area DTA and the<br>
position optimized in step 2); and<br>
4) reproducing signal after moving to the target<br>
position.<br>
GTZ1 and GTZ2 (guard track zones 1 and 2) existing<br>
in the write-once information storage medium and the<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium are areas<br>
for specifying the start boundary position of the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI, and a boundary position of a drive<br>
test zone DRTZ and a disc test zone DKTZ. These areas<br>
are prohibited from being recorded a recording mark.<br>
The guard track zone 1 GTZ1 and guard track zone 2 GTZ2<br>
exist in the data lead-in area DTLDI, and thus, in this<br>
area, the write-once type information storage medium is<br>
featured in that the pre-groove area is formed in<br>
advance. Alternatively, the rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium is featured in that the<br>
groove area and the land area are formed in advance.<br>
In the pre-groove area or groove area and the land<br>
area, as shown in FIGS. 32, 33 and 34, wobble addresses<br>
are recorded in advance, and thus, the current location<br>
in the information storage medium is determined by<br>
using these wobble addresses.<br>
The disk test zone DKTZ is an area provided for<br>
manufactures of information storage mediums to carry<br>
out quality test (evaluation).<br>
The drive test zone DRTZ is provided as an area<br>
for carrying out test writing before the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus records information in<br>
the information storage medium. The information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus carries out test<br>
writing in advance in this area, and identifies an<br>
optimal recording condition (write strategy). Then,<br>
the information contained in the data area DTA can be<br>
recorded under the optimal recording condition.<br>
The information recorded in the disk<br>
identification zone DIZ which exists in the rewritabletype<br>
information storage medium (FIG. 35B) is an<br>
optional information recording area, the area being<br>
adopted to additionally write a set of drive<br>
descriptions composed of: information on manufacturer<br>
name of recording/reproducing apparatuses; additional<br>
information relating thereto; and an area in which<br>
recording can be uniquely carried out by the<br>
manufacturers.<br>
A defect management area 1 DMA1 and a defect<br>
management area 2 DMA2 which exist in a rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium (FIG. 35B) record defect<br>
management information contained in the data area DTA,<br>
and, for example, substitute site information when a<br>
defect occurs or the like is recorded.<br>
In the write-once type information storage medium<br>
(FIG. 35C), there exist uniquely: an RMD duplication<br>
zone RDZ; a recording management zone RMZ; and an R<br>
physical information zone R-PFIZ. The recording<br>
management zone RMZ records RMD (recording management<br>
data) which is an item of management information<br>
relating to a recording position of data updated by<br>
additional writing of data. A detailed description will<br>
be given later. As described later in FIGS. 36 (a),<br>
(b), (c) and (d), in the present embodiment, a<br>
recording management zone RMZ is set for each bordered<br>
area BRDA, enabling area expansion of the recording<br>
management zone RMZ. As a result, even if the required<br>
recording management data RMD increases due to an<br>
increase of additional writing frequency, such an<br>
increase can be handled by expanding the recording<br>
management zone RMZ in series, and thus, there is<br>
attained advantageous effect that the additional<br>
writing count can be significantly increased. In this<br>
case, in the present embodiment, the recording<br>
management zone RMZ is arranged in a border-in BRDI<br>
which corresponds to each bordered area BRDA (arranged<br>
immediately before each bordered area BRDA). In the<br>
present embodiment, the border-in BRDI corresponding to<br>
the first bordered area BRDA#1 and a data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI are made compatible with each other, and<br>
efficient use of the data area DTA is promoted while<br>
the forming of the first border-in BRDI in the data<br>
area DTA is eliminated. That is, the recording<br>
management zone RMZ in the data lead-in area DTA shown<br>
in FIG. 35C is utilized as a recording location of the<br>
recording management data RDM which corresponds to the<br>
first bordered area BRDA#1.<br>
The RMD duplication zone RDZ is a location for<br>
recording information on the recording management data<br>
RMD which meets the following condition in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ, and the reliability of<br>
the recording management data RMD is improved by<br>
providing the recording management data RMD in a<br>
duplicate manner, as in the present embodiment. That<br>
is, in the case where the recording management data RMD<br>
contained in the recording management zone RMZ is valid<br>
due to dust or scratch adhering to a write-once<br>
information storage medium surface, the recording<br>
management data RMD is reproduced, the data being<br>
recorded in this RMD duplication zone RDZ. Further,<br>
the remaining required information is acquired by<br>
tracing, whereby information on the latest recording<br>
management data RMD can be restored.<br>
This RMD duplication zone records recording<br>
management data RDM at a time point at which (a<br>
plurality of) borders are closed. As described later,<br>
a new recording management zone RMZ is defined every<br>
time one border is closed and a next new bordered area<br>
is set. Thus, every time a new recording management<br>
zone RMZ is created, the last recording management data<br>
RMD relating to the preceding bordered area may be<br>
recorded in this RMD duplication zone RDZ. When the<br>
same information is recorded in this RMD duplication<br>
zone RDZ every time the recording management data RDM<br>
is additionally recorded on a write-once information<br>
storage medium, the RMD duplication zone RDZ becomes<br>
full with a comparatively small additional recording<br>
count, and thus, an upper limit value of the additional<br>
writing count becomes small. In contrast, as in the<br>
present embodiment, in the case where a recording<br>
management zone is newly produced when a border is<br>
closed, the recording management zone in the border-in<br>
BRDI becomes full, and a new recording management zone<br>
RMZ is formed by using an R zone, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that only the last recording<br>
management data RMD contained in the past recording<br>
management zone RMZ is recorded in the RMD duplication<br>
zone RDZ, thereby making it possible to improve an<br>
allowable additional writing count by efficiently using<br>
the RMD duplication zone RDZ.<br>
For example, in the case where the recording<br>
management data RMD contained in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ which corresponds to the bordered<br>
area BRDA on the way of additional writing (before<br>
closed) cannot be reproduced due to the dust or scratch<br>
adhering to the surface of the write-once type<br>
information storage medium, a location of the bordered<br>
area BRDA, which has been already closed, can be<br>
identified by reading the recording management data RMD<br>
lastly recorded in this RMD duplication zone RDZ.<br>
Therefore, the location of the bordered area BRDA on<br>
the way of additional writing (before closed) and the<br>
contents of information recorded therein can be<br>
acquired by tracing another location in the data area<br>
DTA of the information storage medium, and the<br>
information on the latest recording management data RMD<br>
can be restored.<br>
An R physical information zone R-PFIZ records the<br>
information analogous to the physical format PFI<br>
contained in the control data zone CDZ which exists<br>
common to FIGS. 35A to 35C (described later in detail).<br>
FIG. 36 shows a data structure in the RMD<br>
duplication zone RDZ and the recording management zone<br>
RMZ which exists in the write-once type information<br>
storage medium (FIG. 35C). FIG. 36 (a) shows the same<br>
structure as that shown in FIG. 35C, and FIG. 36 (b)<br>
shows an enlarged view of the RMD duplication zone RDZ<br>
and the recording management zone RDZ shown in<br>
FIG. 35C. As described above, in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ contained in the data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI, data relating to recording management which<br>
corresponds to the first bordered area BRDA is<br>
collectively recorded, respectively, in one items of<br>
recording management data (RMD); and new recording<br>
management data RMD is sequentially additionally<br>
written at the back side every time the contents of the<br>
recording management data RMD generated when additional<br>
writing process has been carried out in the write-once<br>
information storage medium are updated. That is, the<br>
RMD (Recording Management Data) is recorded in size<br>
units of single physical segment block (a physical<br>
segment block will be described later), and new<br>
recording management data RMD is sequentially<br>
additionally written every time the contents of data<br>
are updated. In the example shown in FIG. 36 (b), a<br>
change has occurred with management data in location<br>
recording management data RMD#1 and RMD#2 has been<br>
recorded. Thus, this figure shows an example in which<br>
the data after changed (after updated) has been<br>
recorded as recording management data RMD#3 immediately<br>
after the recording management data RMD#2. Therefore,<br>
in the recording management zone RMD, a reserved area<br>
273 exists so that additional writing can be further<br>
carried out.<br>
Although FIG. 36 (b) shows a structure in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ which exists in the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI, a structure in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ (or expanded recording management<br>
zone: referred to as expanded RMZ) which exists in the<br>
border-in BRDI or bordered area BRDA described later is<br>
also identical to the structure shown in FIG. 36 (b)<br>
without being limited thereto.<br>
In the present embodiment, in the case where a<br>
first bordered area BRDA#1 is closed or in the case<br>
where the terminating process (finalizing) of the data<br>
area DTA is carried out, a processing operation for<br>
padding all the reserved area 273 shown in FIG. 36 (b)<br>
with the latest recording management data RMD<br>
duplication zone is carried out. In this manner, the<br>
following advantageous effects are attained:<br>
1) An "unrecorded" reserved area 273 is<br>
eliminated, and the stabilization of tracking<br>
correction due to a DPD (Differential Phase Detection)<br>
technique is guaranteed;<br>
2) the latest recording management data RMD is<br>
overwritten in the past reserved area 273, thereby<br>
remarkably improving the reliability at the time of<br>
reproduction relating to the last recording management<br>
data RMD; and<br>
3) an event that different items of recording<br>
management data RMD are mistakenly recorded in an<br>
unrecorded reserved area 273 can be prevented.<br>
The above processing method is not limited to the<br>
recording management zone RMZ contained in the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI. In the present embodiment, with<br>
respect to the recording management zone RMZ (or<br>
expanded recording management zone: referred to as<br>
expanded RMZ) which exists in the border-in BRDI or<br>
bordered area BRDA described later, in the case where<br>
the corresponding bordered area BRDA is closed or in<br>
the case where the terminating process (finalizing) of<br>
the data area DTA is carried out, a processing<br>
operation for padding all the reserved area 273 shown<br>
in FIG. 36 (b) with the latest recording management<br>
data RMD is carried out.<br>
The RMD duplication zone RDZ is divided into the<br>
RDZ lead-in area RDZLI and a recording area 271 of the<br>
last recording management data RMD duplication zone RDZ<br>
of the corresponding RMZ. The RDZ lead-in area RDZLI<br>
is composed of a system reserved field SRSF whose data<br>
size is 48 KB and a unique ID field UIDF whose data<br>
size is 16 KB, as shown in FIG. 36 (b). All "OOh" are<br>
set in the system reserved field SRSF.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that DRZ<br>
lead-in area RDZLI is recorded in the data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI which can be additionally written. In the writeonce<br>
type information storage medium according to the<br>
present embodiment, the medium is shipped with the RDZ<br>
lead-in area RDZLI being in an unrecorded state<br>
immediately after manufacturing. In the user's<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus, at a stage<br>
of using this write-once type information storage<br>
medium, RDZ lead-in area RDZLI information is recorded.<br>
Therefore, it is determined whether or not information<br>
is recorded in this RDZ lead-in area RDZLI immediately<br>
after the write-once type information storage medium<br>
has been mounted on the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus, thereby making it<br>
possible to easily know whether or not the target<br>
write-once type information storage medium is in a<br>
state immediately after manufacturing/shipment or has<br>
been used at least once. Further, as shown in FIG. 36,<br>
the present embodiment is secondarily featured in that<br>
the RMD duplication zone RDZ is provided at the inner<br>
periphery side than the recording management zone RMZ<br>
which corresponds to a first bordered area BRDA, and<br>
the RDZ lead-in RDZLI is arranged in the RMD<br>
duplication zone RDZ.<br>
The use efficiency of information acquisition is<br>
improved by arranging information (RDZ lead-in area<br>
RDZLI) representing whether or not the write-once type<br>
information storage medium is in a state immediately<br>
after manufacturing/shipment or has been used at least<br>
once in the RMD duplication zone RDZ used for the<br>
purpose of a common use (improvement of reliability of<br>
RMD). In addition, the RDZ lead-in area RDZLI is<br>
arranged at the inner periphery side than the recording<br>
management zone RMZ, thereby making it possible to<br>
reduce a time required for acquisition of required<br>
information. When the information storage medium is<br>
mounted on the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus, the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus starts reproduction from the burst cutting<br>
area BCA arranged at the innermost periphery side, as<br>
described in FIG. 31, and sequentially changes a<br>
reproducing location from the system lead-in SYLSI to<br>
the data lead-in area DTLDI while the reproduction<br>
position is sequentially moved to the innermost<br>
periphery side. It is determined whether or not<br>
information has been recorded in the RDZ lead-in area<br>
RDZLI contained in the RMD duplication zone RDZ. In a<br>
write-once type information storage medium in which no<br>
recording is carried out immediately after shipment, no<br>
recording management data RMD is recorded in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ. Thus, in the case where<br>
no information is recorded in the RDZ lead-in area<br>
RDZLI, it is determined that the medium is "unused<br>
immediately after shipment", and the reproduction of<br>
the recording management zone RMD can be eliminated,<br>
and a time required for acquisition of required<br>
information can be reduced.<br>
As shown in FIG. 36 (c), a unique ID area UIDF<br>
records information relating to an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus for which the writeonce<br>
type information storage medium immediately after<br>
shipment has been first used (i.e., for which recording<br>
has been first started). That is, this area records a<br>
drive manufacturer ID 281 of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus or serial number 283<br>
and model number 284 of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus. The unique ID area<br>
UIDF repeatedly records the same information for 2 KB<br>
(strictly, 2048 bytes) shown in FIG. 36 (c).<br>
Information contained in the unique disk ID 287 records<br>
year information 293, month information 294, date<br>
information 295, time information 296, minutes<br>
information 297, and seconds information 298 when the<br>
storage medium has been first used (recording has been<br>
first started). A data type of respective items of<br>
information is described in HEX, BIN, ASCII as<br>
described in FIG. 36 (d), and two types or four bytes<br>
are used.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that the<br>
size of an area of this RDZ lead-in area RDZLI and the<br>
size of the one recording management data RMD are 64<br>
KB, i.e., the user data size in one ECC block becomes<br>
an integer multiple. In the case of the write-once<br>
type information storage medium, it is impossible to<br>
carry out a processing operation for rewriting ECC<br>
block data after changed in the information storage<br>
medium after changing part of the data contained in one<br>
ECC block. Therefore, in particular, in the case of<br>
the write-once type information storage medium, as<br>
described later, data is recorded in recording cluster<br>
units composed of an integer multiple of a data segment<br>
including one ECC block. Therefore, the size of the<br>
area of the RDZ lead-in area RDZLI and the size of such<br>
one item of recording management data RMD are different<br>
from a user data size in an ECC block, there is a need<br>
for a padding area or a stuffing area for making<br>
adjustment to the recording cluster unit, and a<br>
substantial recording efficiency is lowered. As in the<br>
present embodiment, the size of the area of the RDZ<br>
lead-in area RDZLI and the size of such one item of<br>
recording management data RMD are set to an integer<br>
multiple of 64 KB, thereby making it possible to lower<br>
the recording efficiency.<br>
A description will be given with respect to a last<br>
recording management data RMD recording area 271 of the<br>
corresponding RMZ shown in FIG. 36 (b). As described<br>
in Japanese Patent No. 2621459, there is a method for<br>
recording intermediate information at the time of<br>
interruption of recording inwardly of the lead-in area.<br>
In this case, every time recording is interrupted or<br>
every time an additional writing process is carried<br>
out, it is necessary to serially additionally write<br>
intermediate information in this area (recording<br>
management data RMD in the present embodiment). Thus,<br>
if such recording interruption or additional writing<br>
process is frequently repeated, there is a problem that<br>
this area becomes full immediately and a further adding<br>
process cannot be carried out. In order to solve this<br>
problem, the present embodiment is featured in that an<br>
RMD duplication zone RDZ is set as an area capable of<br>
recording the recording management data RMD updated<br>
only when a specific condition is met and the recording<br>
management data RMD sampled under such a specific<br>
condition is recorded. Thus, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that the RMD duplication zone RDZ<br>
can be prevented from being full and the numbers of<br>
additional writings enable with respect to the writeonce<br>
type information storage medium can be remarkably<br>
improved by lowering the frequency of the recording<br>
management data RMD additionally written in the RMD<br>
duplication zone RDZ. In parallel to this effect, the<br>
recording management data updated every time an<br>
additional writing process is carried out is serially<br>
additionally written in the recording management zone<br>
RMZ in the border-in area BRDI shown in FIG. 36 (a) (in<br>
the data lead-in area DTLDI as shown in FIG. 36 (a)<br>
with respect to the first bordered area BRDA#1) or the<br>
recording management zone RMZ utilizing an R zone<br>
described later. When a new recording management zone<br>
RMZ is created, for example, when the next bordered<br>
area BRDA is created (new border-in area BRDI is set)<br>
or when a new recording management zone RMZ is set in<br>
an R zone, the last recording management data RMD (the<br>
newest RMD in a state immediately before creating a new<br>
recording management zone RMZ) is recorded in (the<br>
corresponding last recording management data RMD<br>
recording area 271) contained in the RMD duplication<br>
zone RDZ. In this manner, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that a newest RMD position search<br>
is facilitated by utilizing this area in addition to a<br>
significantly increase of additional writing enable<br>
count for the write-once type information storage<br>
medium.<br>
FIG. 38 shows a data structure in the recording<br>
management data RMD shown in FIG. 36. FIG. 38 shows<br>
the same contents of FIG. 36. As described previously,<br>
in the present embodiment, the border-in area BRDI for<br>
the first bordered area BRDA#1 is partially compatible<br>
with the data lead-in area DTLDI, and thus, the<br>
recording management data RMD#1 to #3 corresponding to<br>
the first bordered area are recorded in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ in the data lead-in area DTLDI. In<br>
the case where no data is recorded in the data area<br>
DTA, the inside recording management zone RMZ is<br>
provided as a reserved area 273 in which all data is in<br>
an unrecorded state. The recording management data RMD<br>
updated every time data is additionally written in the<br>
data area DTA is recorded in first location contained<br>
in this reserved area 273, and the corresponding<br>
recording management data RMD is sequentially<br>
additionally written in the first bordered area<br>
contained in the recording management zone RMZ. The<br>
size of the recording management data RMD additionally<br>
written each time in the recording management zone RMZ<br>
is defined as 64 KB. In the present embodiment, one<br>
ECC block is composed of 64 KB data, and thus, an<br>
additional writing process is simplified by adjusting<br>
the data size of this recording management data RMD to<br>
conform with one ECC block size. As described later,<br>
in the present embodiment, one data segment 490 is<br>
configured by adding part of a guard area before and<br>
after one ECC block data 412, and recording clusters<br>
540 and 542 in units of additional writing or rewriting<br>
are configured by adding expanded guard fields 258 and<br>
259 to one or more (n) data segments. In the case of<br>
recording the recording management data RMD, the<br>
recording clusters 540 and 542 including only one data<br>
segment (one ECC block) are sequentially additionally<br>
written in this recording management zone RMZ. As<br>
described later, a length of a location for recording<br>
one data segment 531 corresponds to that of one<br>
physical segment block composed of seven physical<br>
segments 550 to 556.<br>
FIG. 38 (c) shows a data structure in one<br>
recording management data RMF#1. FIG. 38 (c) shows a<br>
data structure in recording management data RMD#1<br>
contained in the data lead-in area DTLDI. The<br>
illustrated data structure is identical to a data<br>
structure in the recording management data RMD#A and #B<br>
(FIG. 36 (b)) recorded in the RMD duplication zone RDZ;<br>
(expanded) recording management data RMD recorded in a<br>
border-in area BRDI described later; (expanded)<br>
recording management data RMD recorded in an R zone;<br>
and copy CRMD of RMD recorded in the border-out area<br>
BRDO (FIG. 39 (d)) as well. As shown in FIG. 38 (c) ,<br>
one item of recording management data RMD is composed<br>
of a reserved area and RMD fields ranging from "0" to<br>
"21". In the present embodiment, 32 physical sectors<br>
are included in one ECC block composed of 64 KB user<br>
data, and user data of 2 KB (strictly, 2048 bytes) is<br>
recorded in one physical sector. Each RMD field are<br>
assigned by 2048 bytes in conformance to a user data<br>
size recorded in this physical sector, and relative<br>
physical sector numbers are set. RMD fields are<br>
recorded on a write-once type information storage<br>
medium in order of these relative physical sector<br>
numbers. The contents of data recorded in each RMD<br>
field are as follows:<br>
RMD field 0 ... Information relating to disk state<br>
and data area allocation (information relating to<br>
location for allocating a variety of data in data area)<br>
RMD field 1 ... Information relating to used test<br>
zone and information relating to recommended recording<br>
waveform<br>
RMD field 2 ... User available area<br>
RMD field 3 ... Start position information on<br>
border area and information relating to expanded RMZ<br>
position<br>
RMD fields 4 to 21 ... Information relating to<br>
position of R zone<br>
As shown in FIG. 35 in any of the read-only type,<br>
write-once type, and rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium, the present embodiment is featured in<br>
that a system lead-in area is arranged at an opposite<br>
side of a data area while a data lead-in area is<br>
sandwiched between the two areas, and further, as shown<br>
in FIG. 31, the burst cutting area BCA and the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI are arranged at an opposite side to<br>
each other while the system lead-in area SYSDI is<br>
sandwiched between the two areas. When an information<br>
storage medium is inserted into the information<br>
reproducing apparatus or information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 11, the<br>
information reproducing apparatus or information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus carries out processing<br>
in accordance with the steps of:<br>
1) reproducing information contained in the burst<br>
cutting area BCA;<br>
2) reproducing information contained in the<br>
information data zone CDZ contained in the system leadin<br>
area SYLDI;<br>
3) reproducing information contained in the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI (in the case of a write-once type or<br>
a rewritable-type medium);<br>
4) readjusting (optimizing) a reproduction circuit<br>
constant in the reference code zone RCZ; and<br>
5) reproducing information recorded in the data<br>
area DTA or recording new information.<br>
As shown in FIG. 35, information is sequentially<br>
arranged from the inner periphery side along the above<br>
processing steps, and thus, a process for providing an<br>
access to an unnecessary inner periphery is eliminated,<br>
the number of accesses is reduced, and the data area<br>
DTA can be accessed. Thus, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that a start time for reproducing<br>
the information recording in the data area or recording<br>
new information is accelerated. In addition, RPML is<br>
used for signal reproduction in the data lead-in area<br>
DTDLI and data area DTA by utilizing a slice level<br>
detecting system for signal reproduction in the system<br>
lead-in area SYLDI. Thus, if the data lead-in area<br>
DTLDI and the data area DTA are made adjacent to each<br>
other, in the case where reproduction is carried out<br>
sequentially from the inner periphery side, a signal<br>
can be stably reproduced continuously merely by<br>
switching a slice level detecting circuit to a PRML<br>
detector circuit only once between the system lead-in<br>
area SYLDI and the data lead-in area DTLDI. Thus, the<br>
number of reproduction circuit switchings along the<br>
reproduction procedures is small, thus simplifying<br>
processing control and accelerating a data intra-area<br>
reproduction start time.<br>
FIG. 37 shows a comparison of the data structures<br>
in the data areas DTA and the data lead-out areas DTLDO<br>
in a variety of information storage mediums.<br>
FIG. 37 (a) shows a data structure of a read-only type<br>
information storage medium; FIGS. 37(b) and 37(c) each<br>
show a data structure of a writing-type information<br>
storage medium; and FIG. 37(d) to 37(f) each show a<br>
data structure of a write-once type information storage<br>
medium. In particular, FIGS. 37 (b) and 37(d) each show<br>
a data structure at the time of an initial state<br>
(before recording); and FIGS. 37(c), 37 (e) and 37 (f)<br>
each show a data structure in a state in which<br>
recording (additional writing or rewriting) has<br>
advanced to a certain extent.<br>
As shown in FIG. 37 (a), in the read-only type<br>
information storage medium, the data recorded in the<br>
data lead-out area DTLDO and the system lead-out area<br>
SYLDO each have a data frame structure (described later<br>
in detail) in the same manner as in the buffer zone 1<br>
BFZ1 and buffer zone 2 BFZ2 shown in FIGS. 35 (a) to<br>
35 (c), and all values of the main data contained<br>
therein are set to "OOh". In the read-only type<br>
information storage medium, a user data prerecording<br>
area 201 can be fully used in the data area DTA.<br>
However, as described later, in any of the embodiments<br>
of the write-once information storage medium and<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium as well,<br>
user rewriting/additional writing enable ranges 202 to<br>
205 are narrower than the data area DTA.<br>
In the write-once information storage medium or<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium, an SPA<br>
(Spare Area) is provided at the innermost periphery of<br>
the data area DTA. In the case where a defect has<br>
occurred in the data area DTA, a substituting process<br>
is carried out by using the spare area SPA. In the<br>
case of the rewritable-type information storage medium,<br>
the substitution history information (defect management<br>
information) is recorded in a defect management area 1<br>
(DMAl) and a defect management area 2 (DMA2) shown in<br>
FIG. 35(b); and a detect management area 3 (DMA3) and a<br>
defect management area 4 (DMA4) shown in FIGS. 37(b)<br>
and 37 (c) . The defect management information recorded<br>
in the defect management area 3 (DMAS) and defect<br>
management area 4 (DMA4) shown in FIGS. 37(b) and 37(c)<br>
are recorded as the same contents of the defect<br>
management information recorded in the defect<br>
management information 1 (DMAl) and defect management<br>
information 2 (DMA2) shown in FIG. 35B. In the case of<br>
the write-once type information storage medium,<br>
substitution history information (defect management<br>
information) in the case where the substituting process<br>
has been carried out is recorded in the data lead-in<br>
area DTLDI shown in FIG. 35C and copy information C_RMZ<br>
on the contents of receding in a recording management<br>
zone which exists in a border zone. Although defect<br>
management has not been carried out in a current DVD-R<br>
disk, DVD-R disks partially having a defect location<br>
are commercially available as the manufacture number of<br>
DVD-R disks increases, and there is a growing need for<br>
improving the reliability of information recorded in a<br>
write-once type information storage medium. In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 37A to 37F, a spare area SPA<br>
is set with respect to the write-once information<br>
storage medium, enabling defect management by a<br>
substituting process. In this manner, a defect<br>
management process is carried out with respect to the<br>
write-once type information storage medium partially<br>
having a defect location, thereby making it possible to<br>
improve the reliability of information. In the<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium or writeonce<br>
type information storage medium, in the case where<br>
a defect frequently has occurred, a user judges an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus, and an<br>
ESPA, ESPA1, and ESPA2 (Expanded Spare Areas) are<br>
automatically set with respect to a state immediately<br>
after selling to the user shown in FIGS. 37A and 37D so<br>
as to widen a substitute location. In this manner, the<br>
expanded spare areas ESPA, ESPA1, and ESPA2 can be set,<br>
thereby making it possible to sell mediums with which a<br>
plenty of defects occur for a manufacturing reason. As<br>
a result, the manufacture yield of mediums is improved,<br>
making it possible to reduce a medial price. As shown<br>
in FIGS. 37A, 37E and 37F, when the expanded spare<br>
areas ESPA, ESPA1, and ESPA2 are expanded in the data<br>
area DTA, user data rewriting or additional writing<br>
enable ranges 203 and 205 decrease(s), thus making it<br>
necessary to management its associated positional<br>
information. In the rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium, the information is recorded in the<br>
defect management area 1 (DMA1) to the defect<br>
management area 4 (DMA4) and in the control data zone<br>
CDZ, as described later. In the case of the write-once<br>
type information storage medium, as described later,<br>
the information is recorded in recording management<br>
zones RMZ which exist in the data lead-in area DTLDI<br>
and in the border-out BRDO. As described later, the<br>
information is recorded in the RMD (Recording<br>
Management Data) contained in the recording management<br>
zone RMZ. The recording management data RMD is updated<br>
or additionally written in the receding management zone<br>
RMZ every time the contents of management data are<br>
updated. Thus, even if an expanded spare area is reset<br>
many times, timely updating and management can be<br>
carried out. (The embodiment shown in FIG. 37E<br>
indicates a state in which an expanded spare area 2<br>
(ESPA2) has been set because further area substituting<br>
setting is required due to a number of defects even<br>
after the expanded spare area 1 (ESPA1) has been fully<br>
used).<br>
A guard track zone 3 (GTZ3) shown in FIGS. 37B and<br>
37C each is arranged to separate a defect management<br>
area 4 (DMA4) and a drive test zone (DRTS) from each<br>
other, and a guard track zone 4 (GTZ4) is arranged to<br>
separate a disk test zone DKTZ and a servo calibration<br>
zone SCZ from each other. The guard track zone 3<br>
(GTZ3) and guard track zone 4 (GTZ4) are specified as<br>
area which inhibits recording by forming a recording<br>
mark, as in the guard track zone 1 (GTZl) and guard<br>
track zone 2 (GTZ2) shown in FIGS. 35A to 35C. The<br>
guard track zone 3 (GTZ3) and the guard track zone 4<br>
(GTZ4) exist in the data lead-out area DTLDO. Thus, in<br>
these areas, in the write-once type information storage<br>
medium, a pre-groove area is formed in advance, or<br>
alternatively, in the rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium, a groove area and a land area are<br>
formed in advance. As shown in FIGS. 32 to 34, wobble<br>
addresses are recorded in advance in the pre-groove<br>
area or the groove area and land area, thus judging a<br>
current position in the information storage medium by<br>
using this wobble addresses.<br>
As in FIGS. 35A to 35C, a drive test zone DRTZ is<br>
arranged as an area for test writing before an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus records<br>
information in an information storage medium. The<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus carries out<br>
test writing in advance in this area, and identifies an<br>
optimal recording condition (write strategy). Then,<br>
this apparatus can record information in the data area<br>
DTA under the optimal recording condition.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 35A to 35C, the disk test zone<br><br>
DKTZ is an area provided for manufacturers of<br>
information storage mediums to carry out quality test<br>
(evaluation).<br>
In all of the areas contained in the data lead-out<br>
area DTLDO other than the SCZ (Servo Calibration Zone),<br>
a pre-groove area is formed in advance in the writeonce<br>
type information storage medium, or alternatively,<br>
a groove area and a land area are formed in advance in<br>
the rewritable-type information storage medium,<br>
enabling recording (additional writing or rewriting) of<br>
a recording mark. As shown in FIGS. 37C and 37E, the<br>
SCZ (Servo Calibration Zone) serves as an emboss pit<br>
area 211 in the same manner as in the system lead-in<br>
area SYLDI instead of the pre-groove area 214 or the<br>
land area and groove area 213. This area forms<br>
continuous tracks with emboss pits, which follows<br>
another area of the data lead-out area DTLDO. These<br>
tracks continuously communicate with each other in a<br>
spiral manner, and form emboss pits over 360 degrees<br>
along the circumference of the information storage<br>
medium. This area is provided to detect a tilt amount<br>
of the information storage medium by using a DPD<br>
(Deferential Phase Detect) technique. If the<br>
information storage medium tilts, an offset occurs with<br>
a track shift detection signal amplitude using the DPD<br>
technique, making it possible to precisely the tilt<br>
amount from the offset amount and a tilting direction<br>
in an offset direction. By utilizing this principle,<br>
emboss pits capable of DPD detection are formed in<br>
advance at the outermost periphery (at the outer<br>
periphery in the data lead-out area DTLDO), thereby<br>
making it possible to carry out detection with<br>
inexpensiveness and high precision without adding<br>
special parts (for tilt detection) to an optical head<br>
which exists in the information recording/reproducing<br>
unit 141 shown in FIG. 11. Further, by detecting the<br>
tilt amount of the outer periphery, servo stabilization<br>
(due to tilt amount correction) can be achieved even in<br>
the data area. In the present embodiment, the track<br>
pitches in this servo calibration zone SCZ are adjusted<br>
to conform with another area contained in the data<br>
lead-out area DTLD, and the manufacturing performance<br>
of the information storage medium is improved, making<br>
it possible to reduce a media price due to the<br>
improvement of yields. That is, although a pre-groove<br>
is formed in another area contained in the data leadout<br>
area DTLDO in the write-once type information<br>
storage medium, a pre-groove is created while a feed<br>
motor speed of an exposure section of an original<br>
master recording device is made constant at the time of<br>
original master manufacturing of the write-once type<br>
information storage medium. At this time, the track<br>
pitches in the servo calibration zone SCZ are adjusted<br>
to conform with another area contained in the data<br>
lead-out area DTLDO, thereby making it possible to<br>
continuously maintain a motor speed constantly in the<br>
servo calibration zone SCZ as well. Thus, the pitch<br>
non-uniformity hardly occurs, and the manufacturing<br>
performance of the information storage medium is<br>
improved.<br>
Another embodiment includes a method for adjusting<br>
at least either of the track pitches and data bit<br>
length in the servo calibration zone SCZ to conform<br>
with the track pitches or data bit length of the system<br>
lead-in area SYLDI. As described previously, the tilt<br>
amount in the servo calibration zone SCZ and its tilt<br>
direction are measured by using the DPD technique, and<br>
the measurement result is utilized in the data area DTA<br>
as well, thereby promoting servo stabilization in the<br>
data area DTA. A method for predicting a tilt amount<br>
in the data area DTA is featured in that the tilt<br>
amount in the system lead-in area SYLDI and its<br>
direction are measured in advance by using the DPD<br>
technique similarly, and a relationship with the<br>
measurement result in the servo calibration zone SCZ is<br>
utilized, thereby making it possible to predict the<br>
tilt amount. In the case of using the DPD technique,<br>
the present embodiment is featured in that the offset<br>
amount of the detection signal amplitude relevant to a<br>
tilt of the information storage medium and a direction<br>
in which an offset occurs, change depending on the<br>
track pitches and data bit length of emboss pits.<br>
Therefore, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
at least either of the track pitches and data bit<br>
length in the servo calibration zone SCZ is adjusted to<br>
conform with the track pitches or data bit length of<br>
the system lead-in area SYLDI, whereby the detection<br>
characteristics relating to the offset amount of the<br>
detection signal amplitude and the direction in which<br>
an offset occurs are made coincident with each other<br>
depending on the servo calibration zone SCZ and the<br>
system lead-in area SYLDI; a correlation between these<br>
characteristics is easily obtained, and the tilt amount<br>
and direction in the data area DTA is easily predicted.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 35C and 37D, in the write-once<br>
type information storage medium, two drive test zones<br>
DRTZ are provided at the inner periphery side and the<br>
outer periphery side of the medium. As more test<br>
writing operations are carried out for the drive text<br>
zones DRTZ, parameters are finely assigned, thereby<br>
making it possible to search an optimal recording<br>
condition in detail and to improve the precision of<br>
recording in the data area DTA. The rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium enables reuse in the drive<br>
test zone DRTZ due to overwriting. However, if an<br>
attempt is made to enhance the recording precision by<br>
increasing the number of test writings in the writeonce<br>
type information storage medium, there occurs a<br>
problem that the drive test zone is used up<br>
immediately. In order to solve this problem, the<br>
present embodiment is featured in that an EDRTZ<br>
(Expanded Drive Test Zone) can be set from the outer<br>
periphery to the inner periphery direction, making it<br>
possible to expand a drive test zone. In the present<br>
embodiment, features relating to a method for setting<br>
an expanded drive test zone and a method for carrying<br>
out test writing in the set expanded drive test zone<br>
are described below.<br>
1) The setting (framing) of expanded drive test<br>
zones EDRTZ are sequentially provided collectively from<br>
the outer periphery direction (close to the data leadout<br>
area DTLDO) to the inner periphery side.<br>
- As shown in FIG. 37E, the expanded drive test<br>
zone 1 (EDRTZ1) is set as an area collected from a<br>
location which is the closest to the outer periphery in<br>
the data area (which is the closest to the data leadout<br>
area DTLDO); and the expanded drive test zone 1<br>
(EDRTZ1) is used up, thereby making it possible to<br>
secondarily set the expanded drive test zone 2 (EDRTZ2)<br>
as a corrected area which exists in the inner periphery<br>
side than the current position.<br>
2) Test writing is sequentially carried out from<br>
the inner periphery side in the expanded dive test zone<br>
DDRTZ.<br>
- In the case where test writing is carried out in<br>
the expanded drive test zone EDRTZ, such test writing<br>
is carried out along a groove area 214 arranged in a<br>
spiral shape from the inner periphery side to the outer<br>
periphery side, and current test writing is carried out<br>
for an unrecorded location that immediately follows the<br>
previously test-written (recorded) location.<br>
The data area is structured to be additionally<br>
written along the groove area 214 arranged in a spiral<br>
manner from the inner periphery side to the outer<br>
periphery side. A processing operation from "checking<br>
immediately test-written location" to "carrying out<br>
current test writing" can be serially carried out by<br>
using a method for sequentially carrying out additional<br>
writing a location that follows a test writing location<br>
in which test writing in the expanded drive test zone<br>
has been carried out immediately before, thus<br>
facilitating a test writing process and simplifying<br>
management of the test-written location in the expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ.<br>
3) The data lead-out area DTLDO can be reset in<br>
the form including the expanded drive test zone.<br>
FIG. 37E shows an example of setting two areas,<br>
i.e., an expanded spare area 1 (ESPAl) and an expanded<br>
spare area 2 (ESPA2) in the data area DTA and setting<br>
two areas, i.e., the expanded drive test zone 1<br>
(EDRTZ1) and expanded drive test zone 2 (EDRTZ2). In<br>
this case, as shown in FIG. 37F, the present embodiment<br>
is featured in that the data lead-out area DTLO can be<br>
reset with respect to an area including up to the<br>
expanded drive test zone 2 (EDRTZ2). Concurrently, the<br>
range of data area DTA is reset in a range-narrowed<br>
manner, making it easy to manage an additional writing<br>
enable range 205 of the user data which exists in the<br>
data area DTA. In the case where the resetting has<br>
been provided as shown in FIG. 37F, a setting location<br>
of the expanded spare area 1 (ESPAl) shown in FIG. 37E<br>
is regarded as an "expanded spare area which has<br>
already been used up", and an unrecorded area (area<br>
enabling additional test writing) is managed only in<br>
the expanded spare area 2 (ESPA2) contained in the<br>
expanded drive test zone EDRTZ if any. In this case,<br>
non-defect information which is recorded in the<br>
expanded spare area 1 (ESPAl) and which has been used<br>
up for substitution is transferred to a location of an<br>
area which is not substituted in the expanded spare<br>
area 2 (ESPTA2), and defect management information is<br>
rewritten. The start position information on the reset<br>
data lead-out area DTLDO is recorded in allocation<br>
position information on the latest (updated) data area<br>
DTA of RMD field 0 contained in the recording<br>
management data RMD, as shown in FIG. 44.<br>
A structure of a border area in a write-once type<br>
information storage medium will be described here with<br>
reference to FIG. 40. When one border area has been<br>
first set in the write-once information storage medium,<br>
an bordered area (Bordered Area) BRDA#1 is set at the<br>
inner periphery size (which is the closest to the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI), as shown in FIG. 40 (a), and then,<br>
a border out (Border out) BRDO that follows the above<br>
area is formed.<br>
Further, in the case where an attempt is made to<br>
set a next bordered area (Bordered Area) BRDA2, as<br>
shown in FIG. 40 (b), a next (1) border in area BRDI<br>
that follows the preceding 1 border out area BRDO is<br>
formed, and then, a next bordered area BRDA2 is set.<br>
In the case where an attempt is made to close the next<br>
bordered area BRDA2, a (2) border out area BRDO that<br>
immediately follows the area BRDA2 is formed. In the<br>
present embodiment, a state in which the next ((1)<br>
border in area BRDI) that follows the preceding (1)<br>
border out area BRDO is formed and combined is referred<br>
to as a border zone BRDZ. The border zone BRDZ is set<br>
to prevent an optical head from overrun between the<br>
bordered areas BRDAs when reproduction has been carried<br>
out by using the information reproducing apparatus (on<br>
the presumption that the DPD detecting technique is<br>
used). Therefore, in the case where a write-once type<br>
information storage medium having information recorded<br>
therein is reproduced by using a read-only apparatus,<br>
it is presumed that a border close process is made such<br>
that the border out area BRDO and border-in area BRDI<br>
are already recorded and the border out area BRDO that<br>
follows the last bordered area BRDA is recorded. The<br>
first bordered area BRDA#1 is composed of 4080 or more<br>
physical segment blocks, and there is a need for the<br>
first bordered area BRDA#1 to have a width of 1.0 mm or<br>
more in a radial direction on the write-once type<br>
information storage medium. FIG. 40 (b) shows an<br>
example of setting an expanded drive test zone EDRTZ in<br>
the data area DTA.<br>
FIG. 40 (c) shows a state obtained after<br>
finalizing a write-once information storage medium.<br>
FIG. 40 (c) shows an example in which an expanded drive<br>
test zone EDRTZ is incorporated in the data lead-out<br>
area DTLDO, and further, an expanded spare area ESPA<br>
has been set. In this case, a user data adding enable<br>
range 205 is fully padded with the last border out area<br>
BRDO.<br>
FIG. 40 (d) shows a detailed data structure in the<br>
border zone area BRDZ described above. Each item of<br>
information is recorded in size units of one physical<br>
segment blocks (physical segment block). Copy<br>
information C_RMZ on the contents recorded in a<br>
recording management zone is recorded at the beginning<br>
of the border out area BRDO, and a border end mark<br>
(Stop Block) STB indicating the border out area BRDOP<br>
is recorded. Further, in the case the next border in<br>
area BDI is reached, a first mark (Next Border Marker)<br>
NBM indicating that a next border area reaches an<br>
"Nl-th" physical segment block counted from a physical<br>
segment block in which the border end mark (Stop Block)<br>
STC has been recorded; a second mark NBM indicating<br>
that a next border region reaches an "N2-th" physical<br>
segment block; and a third mark NBM indicating that a<br>
next border region reaches an "N3-th" mark NBM are<br>
discretely recorded in a total of three locations on a<br>
size by size basis of one physical segment block,<br>
respectively. Updated physical format information<br>
U_PFI is recorded in the next border-in area BRDI. In<br>
a current DVD-R or a DVD-RW disk, in the case where a<br>
next border is not reached (in the last border out area<br>
BRDO), a location in which "a mark NBM indicating a<br>
next border" should be recorded (a location of one<br>
physical segment block size) shown in FIG. 40 (d) is<br>
maintained as a "location in which no data is<br>
recorded". If border closing is carried out in this<br>
state, this write-once type information storage medium<br>
(current DVD-R or DVD-RW disk) enters a state in which<br>
reproduction can be carried out by using a conventional<br>
DVD-ROM drive or a conventional DVD player. The<br>
conventional DVD-ROM drive or the conventional DVD<br>
player utilizes a recording mark recorded on this<br>
write-once type information storage medium (current<br>
DVD-R or DVD-RW disk) to carry out track shift<br>
detection using the DPD (Differential Phase Detect)<br>
technique. However, in the above described "location<br>
in which no data is recorded", a recording mark does<br>
not exist over one physical segment block size, thus<br>
making it impossible to carry out track shift detection<br>
using the DPD (Differential Phase Detect) technique.<br>
Thus, there is a problem that a track servo cannot be<br>
stably applied. In order to solve the above described<br>
problem with the current DVD-R or DVD-RW disk, the<br>
present embodiment newly employed methods for:<br>
1) in the case where a next border area is<br>
reached, recording data on a specific pattern in<br>
advance in a "location in which the mark NBM indicating<br>
a next border should be recorded"; and<br>
2) carrying out an "overwriting process" in a<br>
specific recording pattern partially and discretely<br>
with respect to a location indicating "the mark NBM<br>
indicating a next border" in which, in the case where a<br>
next border area is reached, the data on the specific<br>
pattern is recorded in advance, thereby utilizing<br>
identification information indicating that "a next<br>
border area is reached".<br>
By setting a mark indicating a next border due to<br>
overwriting, there is attained advantageous effect<br>
that, even in the case where a next border area is<br>
reached as shown in item (1), a recording mark of a<br>
specific pattern can be formed in advance in a<br>
"location in which the mark NBM indicating a next<br>
border should be recorded", and, after border closing,<br>
even if a read-only type information reproducing<br>
apparatus carries out track shift detection in<br>
accordance with the DPD technique, a track servo can be<br>
stably applied. If a new recording mark is overwritten<br>
partially on a portion at which a recording mark has<br>
already been formed in a write-once type information<br>
storage medium, there is a danger that the stability of<br>
a PLL circuit shown in FIG. 11 is degraded in an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus or an<br>
information reproducing apparatus. In order to<br>
overcome this danger, the present embodiment further<br>
newly employs methods for:<br>
3) when overwriting is carried out at a position<br>
of "the mark NBM indicating a next border" of one<br>
physical segment block size, changing an overwrite<br>
state depending on a location contained in the same<br>
data segment;<br>
4) partially carrying out overwriting in a sync<br>
data 432 and disabling overwriting on a sync code 431;<br>
and<br>
5) carrying out overwriting in a location<br>
excluding data ID and IED.<br>
As described later in detail, data fields 411 to<br>
418 for recording user data and guard areas 441 to 448<br>
are alternately recorded on an information storage<br>
medium. A group obtained by combining the data fields<br>
411 to 418 and the guard areas 441 to 448 is called a<br>
data segment 490, and one data segment length coincides<br>
with one physical segment block length. The PLL<br>
circuit 174 shown in FIG. 11 facilitates PLL lead-in in<br>
VFO areas 471 and 472 in particular. Therefore, even<br>
if PLL goes out immediately before the VFO areas 471<br>
and 472, PLL re-lead-in is easily carried out by using<br>
the VFO areas 471 and 472, thus reducing an effect on a<br>
whole system in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus or information reproducing apparatus. There<br>
is attained advantageous effect that (3) an overwrite<br>
state is changed depending on a location in a data<br>
segment internal location, as described above, by<br>
utilizing this state, and an overwrite amount of a<br>
specific pattern is increased at a back portion close<br>
to the VFO areas 471 and 472 contained in the same data<br>
segment, thereby making it possible to facilitate<br>
judgment of "a mark indicating a next border" and to<br>
prevent degradation of the precision of a signal PLL at<br>
the time of reproduction. As described in detail with<br>
respect to FIGS. 83 (a) to 83 (f) and FIGS. 62 (a) and<br>
62 (b), one physical sector is composed of a<br>
combination of a location in which sync codes (SYO to<br>
SY3) are arranged and the sync data 434 arranged<br>
between these sync codes 433. The information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus or the information<br>
recording apparatus samples sync codes 43 (SYO to SY3)<br>
from a channel bit pattern recorded on the information<br>
storage medium, and detects a boundary of the channel<br>
bit pattern. As described later, position information<br>
(physical sector numbers or logical sector numbers) on<br>
the data recorded on the information storage medium is<br>
sampled from data ID information. A data ID error is<br>
sensed by using an IED arranged immediately after the<br>
sampled information. Therefore, the present embodiment<br>
enables (5) disabling overwriting on data ID and IED<br>
and (4) partially carrying out overwriting in the sync<br>
data 432 excluding the sync code 431, thereby enabling<br>
detection of a data ID position and reproduction<br>
(content-reading) of the information recorded in data<br>
ID by using the sync code 431 in the "mark NMB<br>
indicating a next border".<br>
FIG. 39 shows another embodiment which is<br>
different from that shown in FIG. 40 relating to a<br>
structure of a border area in a write-once type<br>
information storage medium. FIGS. 39 (a) and 39 (b)<br>
show the same contents of FIGS. 40 (a) and 40 (b).<br>
FIG. 39 (a) to 39 (d) are different from FIG. 40 (c) in<br>
terms of a state that follows finalization of a writeonce<br>
type information storage medium. For example, as<br>
shown in FIG. 39 (c), after information contained in<br>
the bordered area BRDA#3 has been recorded, in the case<br>
where an attempt is made to achieve finalization, a<br>
border out area BRDO is formed immediately after the<br>
bordered area BDA#3 as a border closing process. Then,<br>
a terminator area TRM is formed after the border out<br>
area DRDO which immediately follows the bordered area<br>
BRDA#3, thereby reducing a time required for<br>
finalization. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 40,<br>
there is a need for padding a region that immediately<br>
precedes the expanded spare area ESPA with border out<br>
area BRDO. There occurs a problem that a large amount<br>
of time is required to form this border out area BRDO,<br>
thereby expanding the finalization time. In contrast,<br>
in the embodiment shown in FIG. 39 (c), a comparatively<br>
short terminator area TRM is set in length; all of the<br>
outer areas than the terminator TRM are redefined as a<br>
data lead-out area NDTLDO; and an unrecorded portion<br>
which is outer than the terminator TRM is set as a user<br>
disable area 911. That is, when the data area DTA is<br>
finalized, the terminator area TRM is formed at the end<br>
of recording data (immediately after the border out<br>
area BRDO). All the information on the main data<br>
contained in this area is set to "OOh". Type<br>
information on this area is set in an attribute of the<br>
data lead-out area NDTLDO, whereby this terminator area<br>
TRM is redefined as a new data lead-out area NDTLDO, as<br>
shown in FIG. 39 (c). Type information on this area is<br>
recorded in area type information 935 contained in data<br>
ID, as described later. That is, the area type<br>
information 935 contained in the data ID in this<br>
terminator area TRM is set to "lOb", as shown in<br>
FIGS. 50 (a) to 50 (d), thereby indicating that data<br>
exists in the data lead-out area DTLDO. The present<br>
embodiment is featured in that identification<br>
information on a data lead-out position is set by the<br>
data ID internal area type information 935. In an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus or an<br>
information reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 11, let<br>
us consider a case in which an information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141 has provided a random<br>
access to a specific target position on a write-once<br>
type information storage medium. Immediately after<br>
random access, the information recording/reproducing<br>
unit 141 must reproduce a data ID and decode a data<br>
frame number 922 in order to know where on the writeonce<br>
type information storage medium has been reached.<br>
In the data ID, area type information 935 exists near<br>
the data frame number 922. At the same time, it is<br>
possible to immediately identify whether or not the<br>
information recording/recording unit 141 exists in the<br>
data lead-out area DTLDO merely by decoding this area<br>
type information 935. Thus, a simplification and high<br>
speed access control can be made. As described above,<br>
identification information on the data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO is provided by data ID internal setting of the<br>
terminator area TRM, thereby making it easy to detect<br>
the terminator area TRM.<br>
As a specific example, in the case where the<br>
border out area BRDO is set as an attribute of the data<br>
lead-out area NDTLDO (that is, in the case where the<br>
area type information 935 contained in the data ID of a<br>
data frame in the border out BRDO is set to "lOb"), the<br>
setting of this terminator area TRM is not provided.<br>
Therefore, when the terminator area TRM is recorded,<br>
the area having an attribute of the data lead-out area<br>
NDTLDO, this terminator area TRM is regarded as part of<br>
the data lead-out area NDTLDO, thus disabling recording<br>
into the data area DTA. As a result, as in FIG. 39<br>
(c), a user disable area 911 may remain.<br>
In the present embodiment, the size of the<br>
terminator area TRM is changed depending on a location<br>
on a write-once type information storage medium,<br>
thereby reducing a finalization time and achieving<br>
efficient processing. This terminator area TRM<br>
indicates an end position of recording data. In<br>
addition, even in the case where this area is used in a<br>
read-only apparatus, which carries out track shift<br>
detection in accordance with a DPD technique, the<br>
terminator area, is utilized to prevent overrun due to<br>
a track shift. Therefore, a width in a radial<br>
direction on the write-once type information storage<br>
medium having this terminator area TRM (width of a<br>
portion padded with the terminator area TRM) must be a<br>
minimum of 0.05 nm or more because of the detection<br>
characteristics of the read-only apparatus. A length<br>
of one cycle on the write-once type information storage<br>
medium is different depending on a radial position, and<br>
thus, the number of physical segment blocks included in<br>
one cycle is also different depending on the radial<br>
position. Thus, the size of the terminator area TRM is<br>
different depending on the physical sector number of a<br>
physical sector which is positioned at the beginning of<br>
the terminator area TRM, and the size of the terminator<br>
area TRM increases as the physical sector go to the<br>
outer periphery side. A minimum value of a physical<br>
sector number of an allowable terminator area TRM must<br>
be greater than "04FEOOh". This derived from a<br>
restrictive condition in which the first bordered area<br>
DRDA#1 is composed of 4080 or more physical segment<br>
blocks, making it necessary for the first bordered area<br>
BRDA#1 to have a width equal to or greater than 1.0 mm<br>
in a radial direction on the write-once type<br>
information storage medium. The terminator area TRM<br>
must start from a boundary position of physical segment<br>
blocks.<br>
In FIG. 39 (d), a location in which each item of<br>
information is to be recorded is set for each physical<br>
segment block size for the reason described previously,<br>
and a total of 64 KB user data recorded to be<br>
distributed in 32 physical sectors is recorded in each<br>
physical segment block. A relative physical segment<br>
block number is set with respect to a respective one<br>
item of information, as shown in FIG. 39 (d) , and the<br>
items of information are sequentially recorded in the<br>
write-once type information storage medium in ascending<br>
order from the lowest relative physical segment number.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 39 (a) to 39 (d),<br>
copies CRMD#0 to CRMD#4 of RMD, which are the same<br>
contents, are overwritten five times in a copy<br>
information recording zone C_TRZ of the contents<br>
recorded in the recording management zone shown in<br>
FIG. 40 (d). The reliability at the time of<br>
reproduction is improved by carrying out such<br>
overwriting, and, even if dust or scratch adheres onto<br>
a write-once information storage medium, the copy<br>
information CRMD on the contents recorded in the<br>
recording management zone can be stably reproduced.<br>
Although the border end mark STB shown in FIG. 39 (d)<br>
coincides with a border end mark STB shown in FIG. 40<br>
(d), the embodiment shown in FIG. 39 (d) does not have<br>
the mark NBM indicating a next border, unlike the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 40 (d). All the information<br>
on the main data contained in reserved areas 901 and<br>
902 is set to"00h".<br>
At the beginning of the border-in area BRDI,<br>
information which is completely identical to updated<br>
physical format information U_PFI is multiply written<br>
six times from N+l to N+6, configuring the updated<br>
physical format information U_PFI shown in FIG. 40.<br>
The thus updated physical format information U_PFI is<br>
multiply written, thereby improving the reliability of<br>
information.<br>
In FIG. 39 (d), the present embodiment is featured<br>
in that the recording management zone RMZ in the border<br>
zone is provided in the border-in area BRDI. As shown<br>
in FIG. 36 (a), the size of the recording management<br>
zone RMZ contained in the data lead-in area DTLDI is<br>
comparatively small. If the setting of a new bordered<br>
area BRDA is frequently repeated, the recording<br>
management data RMD recorded in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ is saturated, making it impossible<br>
to set a new bordered area BRDA midway. As in the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 39 (d), there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that a recording management zone<br>
for recording the recording management data RMD<br>
relating to the bordered area BRDA#3 that follows is<br>
provided in the border-in area DRDI, whereby the<br>
setting of a new bordered area BRDA can be provided a<br>
number of times and the additional writing count in the<br>
bordered area BRDA can be significantly increased. In<br>
the case where the bordered area BRDA#3 that follows<br>
the border-in area BRDI including the recording<br>
management zone RMZ in this border zone is closed or in<br>
the case where the data area DTA is finalized, it is<br>
necessary to repeatedly record all the last recording<br>
management data RMD into a spare area 273 (FIG. 38 (b))<br>
established in an unrecorded state in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ, and pad all the spare area with<br>
the data. In thins manner, the spare area 273 in an<br>
unrecorded state can be eliminated, a track shift (due<br>
to DPD) at the time of reproduction in a read-only<br>
apparatus can be prevented, and the reproduction<br>
reliability of the recording management data RMD can be<br>
improved by multiple recording of the recording<br>
management data. All the data contained in a reserve<br>
area 903 are set to "OOh".<br>
Although the border out area BRDO serves to<br>
prevent overrun due to a track shift in the read-only<br>
apparatus while the use of DPD is presumed, there is no<br>
need for the border-in area BRDI to have a<br>
particularly large size other than having the updated<br>
physical format information U_PFI and the information<br>
contained in recording management zone RMZ in the<br>
border zone. Therefore, an attempt is made to reduce<br>
the size to the minimum in order to reduce a time<br>
(required for border zone BRDZ recording) at the time<br>
of setting a new bordered area BRDA. With respect to<br>
FIG. 39 (a), before forming the border out area BRDO<br>
due to border closing, there is a high possibility that<br>
the user data additional writing enable range 205 is<br>
sufficiently large, and a large number of additional<br>
writing is carried out. Thus, it is necessary to<br>
largely take a value of "M" shown in FIG. 39 (d) so<br>
that recording management data can be recorded a number<br>
of times in the recording management zone RMZ in a<br>
border zone. In contrast, with respect to FIG. 39 (b),<br>
in a state that precedes border closing of the bordered<br>
area BRDA#2 and that precedes recording the border out<br>
area BRDO, the user data additional writing enable<br>
range 205 narrows, and thus, it is considered that not<br>
the number of additional writings of the recording<br>
management data to be additionally written in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ in the border zone does<br>
not increase so much. Therefore, the setting size "M"<br>
of the recording management zone RMZ in the border-in<br>
area BRDI that immediately precedes the bordered area<br>
BRDA#2 can be taken to be relatively small. That is,<br>
as a location in which the border-in area BRDI is<br>
arranged goes to the inner periphery side, the number<br>
of predicted additional writings of the recording<br>
management data increases. As the location goes to the<br>
outer periphery, the number of predicted additional<br>
writings of the recording management data decreases.<br>
Thus, the present embodiment is featured in that the<br>
size of the border-in area BRDI is reduced. As a<br>
result, the reduction of a time for setting a new<br>
bordered area BRDA and processing efficiency can be<br>
achieved.<br>
A logical recording unit of the information<br>
recorded in the bordered area BRDA shown in FIG. 40 (c)<br>
is referred to as an R zone. Therefore, one bordered<br>
area BRDA is composed of at least one or more R zones.<br>
In a current DVD-ROM, as a file system, there are<br>
employed a file system called a "UDF bridge" in which<br>
both of file management information which conforms with<br>
a UDF (Universal Disc Format) and file management<br>
information which conforms with ISO 9660 are recorded<br>
in one information storage medium at the same time. In<br>
a file management method which conforms with ISO 9660,<br>
there is a rule that one file must be continuously<br>
recorded in an information storage medium. That is,<br>
information contained in one file is disabled to be<br>
divisionally arranged at a discrete position on an<br>
information storage medium. Therefore, for example, in<br>
the case where information has been recorded in<br>
conformance with the above UDF bridge, all the<br>
information configuring one file is continuously<br>
recorded. Thus, it is possible to adapt this area in<br>
which one file is continuously recorded so as to<br>
configure one R zone.<br>
FIG. 41 shows a data structure in the control data<br>
zone CDZ and the R-physical information zone RIZ. As<br>
shown in FIG. 41 (b), physical format information (PFI)<br>
and disc manufacturing information (DMI) exist in the<br>
control data zone CDZ, and similarly, an DMI (Disc<br>
Manufacturing Information) and R PFI (R-Physical Format<br>
Information) are contained in an R-physical information<br>
zone RIZ.<br>
Information 251 relating to a medium manufacture<br>
country and medium manufacturer's nationality<br>
information 252 are recorded in medium manufacture<br>
related information DMI. When a commercially available<br>
information storage medium infringes a patent, there is<br>
a case in which an infringement warning is supplied to<br>
such a country in which a manufacturing location exists<br>
or an information storage medium is consumed (or used).<br>
A manufacturing location (country name) is identified<br>
by being obliged to record the information contained in<br>
an information storage medium, and a patent<br>
infringement warning is easily supplied, whereby an<br>
intellectual property is guaranteed, and technical<br>
advancement is accelerated. Further, other medium<br>
manufacture related information 253 is also recorded in<br>
the medium manufacture related information DMI.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that type of<br>
information to be recorded is specified depending on a<br>
recording location (relative byte position from the<br>
beginning) in physical format information PFI or Rphysical<br>
format information R_PFI. That is, as a<br>
recording location in the physical format information<br>
PFI or R-physical format information R_PFI, common<br>
information 261 in a DVD family is recorded in an 32-<br>
byte area from byte 0 to byte 31; common information<br>
262 in an HD_DVD family which is the subject of the<br>
present embodiment is recorded in 96 bytes from byte 32<br>
to byte 127; unique information (specific information)<br>
263 relating to various specification types or part<br>
versions are recording in 384 bytes from byte 128 to<br>
byte 511; and information corresponding to each<br>
revision is recorded in 1536 bytes from byte 512 to<br>
byte 2047. In this way, the information allocation<br>
positions in the physical format information are used<br>
in common depending on the contents of information,<br>
whereby the locations of the recorded information are<br>
used in common depending on medium type, thus making it<br>
possible to carry out in common and simplify a<br>
reproducing process of an information reproducing<br>
apparatus or an information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus. The common information 261 in a DVD family<br>
recorded in byte 0 to byte 31, as shown in FIG. 41D, is<br>
divided into: information 267 recorded in common in all<br>
of a read-only type information storage medium and a<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium, and a<br>
write-once type information storage medium recorded<br>
from byte 0 to byte 16; and information 268 which is<br>
recorded in common in the rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium and the write-once type information<br>
storage medium from byte 17 to byte 31 and which is not<br>
recorded in the read-only type medium.<br>
FIG. 55 shows another embodiment relating to a<br>
data structure in the control data zone shown in<br>
FIG. 41. As shown in FIG. 35C, the control data zone<br>
CDZ is configured as part of an emboss bit area 211.<br>
This control data zone CDZ is composed of 192 data<br>
segments start from physical sector number 151296<br>
(024FOOh). In the embodiment shown in FIG. 55, a<br>
control data section CTDS composed of 16 data segments<br>
and a copyright data section CPDS composed of 16 data<br>
segments are arranged on two by two basis in the<br>
control data zone CDZ, and a reserve area RSV is set<br>
between these two sections. By allocating these<br>
sections on a two by two basis, a physical distance<br>
between the two sections is widened, and an effect<br>
relevant to a burst error which occurs due to a scratch<br>
of an information storage medium surface or the like is<br>
reduced.<br>
In one control data section CTDS, as shown in<br>
FIG. 55 (c), physical sector information on first three<br>
relative sector numbers "0" to "2" is recorded to be<br>
repeated 16 times. Multiple writing is carried out<br>
16 times, thereby improving the reliability of<br>
recording information. Physical format information PFI<br>
described in FIG. 42 or 54 is recorded in a first<br>
physical sector in a data segment whose relative<br>
physical sector number is "0". Disk manufacture<br>
related information DMI is recorded in a second<br>
physical sector in a data segment whose relative<br>
physical sector number is "1". Furthermore, copyright<br>
protection information CPI is recorded in the third<br>
physical sector in the data segment in which relative<br>
number of the physical sector is "2". A reserved area<br>
RSV whose relative physical sector number is "3" to<br>
"31" is reserved so as to be available in a system.<br>
As the contents of the above described disk<br>
manufacture related information DMI, a disk<br>
manufacturer's name (Disc Manufacturer's name) is<br>
recorded in 128 bytes from byte 0 to byte 127; and<br>
information on a location in which a manufacturer<br>
exists (information indicating where this disk has been<br>
manufactured" is recorded in 128 bytes from byte 128 to<br>
byte 255.<br>
The above disk manufacturer's name is described in<br>
ASCII codes. However, the ASCII codes available in use<br>
as a disk manufacturer's name are limited to a starting<br>
byte to "ODh" and "20h" to "7Eh". A disk manufacture's<br>
name is described from the first byte 1 in this area,<br>
and the remaining portions in this area are padded<br>
(terminated) with data "ODh".<br>
With respect to information on a location in which<br>
the above disk manufacturer exists, the information<br>
indicating where this disk has been manufactured, a<br>
country or a region is described in the ASCII codes.<br>
This area is limited to a starting byte to "ODh" and<br>
"20h" to "7Eh" which are available ASCII codes as in<br>
the disk manufacturer's name. The information on a<br>
location in which a disk manufacturer exists is<br>
described from the first byte I in this area, and the<br>
remaining portions in this area are padded (terminated)<br>
with data "ODh". Alternatively, another describing<br>
method includes setting an allowable size in the range<br>
of the first byte to "ODh" as the information on a<br>
location in which a disk manufacturer exists. In the<br>
case where the information on a location in which a<br>
disk manufacturer exists is long, the information is<br>
terminated at "ODh", and a region subsequent to "ODh"<br>
may be padded with data "20h".<br>
The reserved area RSV shown in FIG. 55 (c) is<br>
fully padded with data "OOh".<br>
FIG. 42 shows a comparison depending on a medium<br>
type (read-only type, rewritable-type, or write-once<br>
type) of information contained in the physical format<br>
information PFI with the contents of specific<br>
information contained in the physical format<br>
information PFI or R-physical format information R_PFI<br>
shown in FIG. 41 or FIG. 55. As information 267<br>
recorded in common to all of the read-only type,<br>
rewritable-type, and write-once type medium in the<br>
common information 261 in the DVD family, there are<br>
sequentially recorded from byte positions 0 to 16:<br>
specification type (read-only, rewriting, or writeonce)<br>
information and version number information;<br>
medium size (diameter) and maximum allowable data<br>
transfer rate information; a medium structure (single<br>
layer or double layer or whether or not emboss pit,<br>
additional writing area, or rewriting area exists); a<br>
recording density (line density and track density)<br>
information; allocation location information on data<br>
region DTA; and information on whether or not burst<br>
cutting area BCA exists (both of them exist in the<br>
present embodiment).<br>
As information 268 in common information 261 of a<br>
DVD family and recorded in common to a rewriting type<br>
and a write-once type, there are recorded: revision<br>
number information for sequentially defining a maximum<br>
recording speed from byte 28 to byte 31; revision<br>
number information for defining a maximum recording<br>
speed; a revision number table (application revision<br>
number); class state information and expanded (part)<br>
version information. The embodiment is featured in<br>
that the information contained from byte 28 to byte 31<br>
include revision information according to a recording<br>
speed in a recording area of physical format<br>
information PFI or R-physical format information R_PFI.<br>
Conventionally, upon development of a medium featured<br>
in that a medium recording speed such as x 2 or x 4<br>
increases, there has been a very complicated<br>
inconvenience that a specification is newly drafted<br>
concurrently. In contrast, according to the present<br>
embodiment, there are divisionally provided: a<br>
specification (version book) in which a version is<br>
changed when the contents have been significantly<br>
changed; and a revision book in which the corresponding<br>
revision is changed and issued, and only a revision<br>
book is issued, the book having updated only revision<br>
every time a recording speed is improved. In this<br>
manner, an expanding function for a medium which<br>
supports high speed recording and a specification can<br>
be handled by a simple method called revision change.<br>
Thus, in the case where a high speed recording<br>
compatible medium has been newly developed, there is<br>
attained advantageous effect that high speed recording<br>
can be carried out. In particular, the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that revision numbers can be<br>
separately set by a maximum value and a minimum value<br>
by separately providing a field of revision number<br>
information defining a maximum recording speed of byte<br>
17 and a field of revision number information defining<br>
a minimum recording speed of byte 18. For example, in<br>
the case where a recording film capable of carrying out<br>
recording at a very high speed has been developed, that<br>
recording film is often very expensive. In contrast,<br>
as in the present embodiment, revision numbers are<br>
separately set depending on a maximum value and a<br>
minimum value of a recording speed, thereby increasing<br>
options of recording mediums which can be developed.<br>
As a result, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
a medium capable of carrying out high speed recording<br>
or a more inexpensive medium can be supplied. An<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus according<br>
to the present embodiment has in advance information on<br>
an allowable maximum recording speed and an allowable<br>
minimum recording speed for each revision. When an<br>
information storage medium is mounted on this<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus, first, the<br>
information recording/reproducing unit 141 shown in<br>
FIG. 11 reads the information contained in this<br>
physical format information PFI and R-physical format<br>
information R_PFI. Based on the obtained revision<br>
number information, there are detected by the control<br>
unit 143: an allowable maximum speed and an allowable<br>
minimum recording speed of an information storage<br>
medium mounted with reference to information on an<br>
allowable maximum recording speed and an allowable<br>
minimum recording speed for each revision recorded in<br>
advance in the memory unit 175; and recording is<br>
carried out at an optimal recording speed based on the<br>
result of the identification.<br>
Now, a description will be given with respect to<br>
the significance of specific information 263 of the<br>
type and version of each of the specifications from<br>
byte 128 to byte 511 shown in FIG. 41 (c) and the<br>
significance of information content 264 which can be<br>
set specific to each of the revisions from byte 512 to<br>
byte 2047. That is, in the specific information 263 of<br>
type and version of each of the specifications from<br>
byte 128 to byte 511, the significance of the contents<br>
of recording information at each byte position<br>
coincides with a rewritable-type information storage<br>
medium of a different type regardless of a write-once<br>
type information storage medium. The information<br>
content 264 which can be set specific to each of the<br>
revisions from byte 512 to byte 2047 permits the fact<br>
that if a revision is different from another in the<br>
same type of medium as well as a difference between a<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium and a writeonce<br>
type information storage medium whose types are<br>
different from each other, the significances of the<br>
contents of recording information at byte positions are<br>
different from each other.<br>
As shown in FIG. 42, as information contents in<br>
the specific information 263 on the type and version of<br>
each of the specifications which coincide with each<br>
other in significance of the contents of recording<br>
information at byte positions between the<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium and the<br>
write-once type information storage medium whose types<br>
are different from each other, there are sequentially<br>
recorded: disk manufacturer's name information;<br>
additional information from the disk manufacturer;<br>
recording mark polarity information (identification of<br>
"H-L" or "L-H"); line speed information at the time of<br>
recording or reproduction; a rim intensity value of an<br>
optical system along a radial direction; and<br>
recommended laser power at the time of reproduction<br>
(light amount value on recording surface).<br>
In particular, the present embodiment is featured<br>
in that recording mark polarity information (Mark<br>
Polarity Descriptor (identification of "H-L" or "L-H")<br>
is provided in byte 192. In the conventional<br>
rewritable-type or write-once DVD disk, only a "H-L"<br>
(High to Low) recording film whose light reflection<br>
amount in a recording mark is low with respect to an<br>
unrecorded state (a state in which reflection level is<br>
relatively high: High) has been accepted. In contrast,<br>
if a medium requires "high speed recording<br>
compatibility", "price reduction" or "decrease in<br>
cross-erase" and "increase in upper limit value of<br>
rewriting count" which are physical properties, there<br>
is a problem that the conventional "H-L" recording film<br>
is insufficient. In contrast, the present embodiment<br>
allows use of an "L-H" recording film whose light<br>
reflection amount increases in a recording mark as well<br>
as only an "H-L" recording film. Thus, there is<br>
attained advantageous effect that the "L-H" recording<br>
film as well as the conventional "H-L" film is<br>
incorporated in the specification, and selecting<br>
options of the recording films are increased, thereby<br>
making it possible to achieve high speed recording or<br>
to supply an inexpensive medium.<br>
A specific method for mounting an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus will be described<br>
below. The specification (version book) or revision<br>
book describe both of the reproduction signal<br>
characteristics derived from the "H-L" recording film<br>
and the reproduction signal characteristics derived<br>
from the "L-H" recording film. Concurrently, the<br>
corresponding circuits are provided on a two by two<br>
basis in the PR equalizing circuit 130 and Viterbi<br>
decoder 156 shown in FIG. 11. When an information<br>
storage medium is mounted in the information<br>
reproduction unit 141, first, the slice level detector<br>
circuit 132 for reading the information contained in<br>
the system lea-in area SYLDI is started up. This slice<br>
level detector circuit 132 reads information on<br>
polarity of a recording mark recorded in this 192 byte<br>
(identification of "H-L" or "L-H"); and then make<br>
judgment of "H-L" or "L-H". In response to the<br>
judgment, after the PR equalizing circuit 130 and a<br>
circuitry contained in the Viterbi decoder 156 has been<br>
switched, the information recorded in the data lead-in<br>
area DTLDI or data area DTA is reproduced. The above<br>
described method can read the information contained in<br>
the data lead-in area DTLDI or data area DTA<br>
comparatively quickly, and moreover, precisely.<br>
Although revision number information defining a maximum<br>
recording speed is described in byte 17 and revision<br>
number information defining a minimum recording speed<br>
is described in byte 18, these items of information are<br>
merely provided as range information defining a maximum<br>
and a minimum. In the case where the most stable<br>
recording is carried out, there is a need for optimal<br>
line speed information at the time of recording, and<br>
thus, the associated information is recorded in<br>
byte 193.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that<br>
information on a rim intensity value of an optical<br>
system along a circumferential direction of byte 194<br>
and information on a rim intensity value of an optical<br>
system along in a radial direction of byte 195 is<br>
recorded as optical system condition information at a<br>
position which precedes information on a variety of<br>
recording conditions (write strategies) included in the<br>
information content 264 set specific to each revision.<br>
These items of information denote conditional<br>
information on an optical system of an optical head<br>
used when identifying a recording condition arranged at<br>
the back side. The rim intensity used here denotes a<br>
distribution state of incident light incident to an<br>
objective lens before focusing on a recording surface<br>
of an information storage medium. This intensity is<br>
defined by a strength value at a peripheral position of<br>
an objective lens (iris face outer periphery position)<br>
when a center intensity of an incident light intensity<br>
distribution is defined as "1". The incident light<br>
intensity distribution relevant to an objective lens is<br>
not symmetrical on a point to point basis; an<br>
elliptical distribution is formed; and the rim<br>
intensity values are different from each other<br>
depending on the radial direction and the<br>
circumferential direction of the information storage<br>
medium. Thus, two values are recorded. As the rim<br>
intensity value increases, a focal spot size on a<br>
recording surface of the information storage medium is<br>
reduced, and thus, an optimal recording power condition<br>
changes depending on this rim intensity value. The<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus recognizes<br>
in advance the rim intensity value information<br>
contained in its own optical head. Thus, this<br>
apparatus reads the rim intensity values of the optical<br>
system along the circumferential direction and the<br>
radial direction, the value being recorded in the<br>
information storage medium, and compares values of its<br>
own optical head. If there is no large difference as a<br>
result of the comparison, a recording condition<br>
recorded at the back side can be applied. If there is<br>
a large difference, there is a need for ignoring the<br>
recording condition recorded at the back side and<br>
starting identifying an optimal recording condition<br>
while the recording/reproducing apparatus carries out<br>
test writing by utilizing the drive test zone DRTZ<br>
shown in FIGS. 35B, 35C, 37A to 37F.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for quickly making a<br>
decision as to whether to utilize the recording<br>
condition recorded at the back side or whether to start<br>
identifying the optimal recording condition while<br>
ignoring the information and carrying out test writing<br>
by oneself. As shown in FIG. 42, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that the rim intensity information<br>
can be read, and then judgment can be made at a high<br>
speed as to whether or not the receding condition<br>
arranged later is met by arranging conditional<br>
information on an optical system identified at a<br>
preceding position with respect to a position at which<br>
the recommended recording condition has been recorded.<br>
As described above, according to the present<br>
embodiment, there are divisionally provided: a<br>
specification (version book) in which a version is<br>
changed when the contents have been significantly<br>
changed; and a revision book in which the corresponding<br>
revision is changed and issued, and only a revision<br>
book is issued, the book having updated only revision<br>
every time a recording speed is improved. Therefore,<br>
if a revision number is different from another, a<br>
recording condition in a revision book changes. Thus,<br>
information relating to a recording condition (write<br>
strategy) is mainly recorded in the information content<br>
264 which can be set specific to each of the revisions<br>
from byte 512 to byte 2047. As is evident from<br>
FIG. 42, the information content 264 which can be set<br>
specific to each of the revisions from byte 512 to byte<br>
2047 permits the fact that if a revision is different<br>
from another in the same type of medium as well as a<br>
difference between a rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium and a write-once type information<br>
storage medium whose types are different from each<br>
other, the significances of the contents of recording<br>
information at byte positions are different from each<br>
other.<br>
Definitions of peak power, bias power 1, bias<br>
power 2, and bias power 3 shown in FIG. 42 coincide<br>
with power values defined in FIG. 18. An end time of a<br>
first pulse shown in FIG. 42 denotes Tgjrp defined in<br>
FIG. 18; a multi-pulse interval denotes Tjyjp defined in<br>
FIG. 18; a start time of a last pulse denotes TgLp<br>
defined in FIG. 38, and a period of bias power 2 of 2T<br>
mark denotes T^c defined in FIG. 18.<br>
FIG. 54 shows another embodiment relating to a<br>
data structure in each of physical format information<br>
and R-physical format information. Further, FIG. 54<br>
comparatively describes "updated physical format<br>
information". In FIG. 54, byte 0 to byte 31 are<br>
utilized as a recording area of common information 269<br>
contained in a DVD family, and byte 32 and subsequent<br>
are set for each specification.<br>
In a write-once type information storage medium,<br>
as shown in FIG. 35C, with respect to R-physical format<br>
information recorded in an R-physical information zone<br>
RIZ contained in the data lead-in area DTLDI, border<br>
zone start position information (first border outermost<br>
periphery address) is added to the physical format<br>
information PFI (copy of HD_DVD family common<br>
information), and the added information is described.<br>
In the updated physical format information U_PFI,<br>
updated in the border-in area BRDI shown in FIG. 40 or<br>
39, start position information (self-border outermost<br>
periphery address) is added to the physical format<br>
information (copy of HD_DVD family common information),<br>
and the added information is recorded. In FIG. 42,<br>
this border zone start position information is recorded<br>
from byte 197 to byte 204. In contrast, the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 54 is featured in that information is<br>
recorded at byte 133 to byte 140 which are positions<br>
preceding information relating to a recording condition<br>
such as peak power or bias power 1 (information content<br>
264 which can be set specific to each revision), the<br>
position following the common information 269 contained<br>
in the DVD family. The updated start position<br>
information is also arranged in byte 133 to byte 140<br>
which are positions preceding information relating to a<br>
recording condition such as peak power or bias power 1<br>
(information content 264 which can be set specific to<br>
each revision), the position following the common<br>
information 269 contained in the DVD family. If<br>
revision number is upgraded and a recording condition<br>
for high precision is required, there is a possibility<br>
that the recording condition information contained in<br>
the rewritable-type information storage medium uses<br>
byte 197 to byte 207. In this case, as in the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 42, if the border zone start<br>
position information for R-physical format information<br>
recorded in the write-once type information storage<br>
medium is arranged in byte 197 to byte 204, there is a<br>
danger that a correlation (compatibility) between the<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium and the<br>
write-once type information storage medium relating to<br>
the arranged position of the recording condition is<br>
distorted. As shown in FIG. 54, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that the border zone start position<br>
information and the updated start position information<br>
are arranged in byte 133 to byte 140, thereby making it<br>
possible to record a correlation (compatibility) in<br>
recording position of a variety of information between<br>
the rewritable-type information storage medium and the<br>
write-once type information storage medium even if an<br>
amount of information relating to a recording condition<br>
will be increased in the future. With respect to the<br>
specific contents of information relating to the borer<br>
zone start position information, the start position<br>
information on the border out area BRDO situated at the<br>
outside of the (current) bordered area BRDA currently<br>
used in byte 133 to byte 136 is described in PSN<br>
(Physical Sector Number); and border-in area BRDI start<br>
position information relating to the bordered area BRDA<br>
to be used next is described in the physical sector<br>
number (PSN) in byte 137 to byte 140.<br>
The specific contents of information relating to<br>
the updated start position information indicate the<br>
latest border zone position information in the case<br>
where a bordered area BRDA has been newly set. The<br>
start position information on the border out area BRDO<br>
situated at the outside of the (current) bordered area<br>
BRDA currently used in byte 133 to byte 136 is<br>
described in PSN (Physical Sector Number); and the<br>
start position information on the border-in area BRDI<br>
relating to the bordered area BRDA to be used next is<br>
described in the sector number (PSN) in byte 137 to<br>
byte 140. In the case where recording cannot be<br>
carried out in the next bordered area BRDA, this area<br>
(ranging from byte 137 to byte 140) is padded with all<br>
"OOh".<br>
As compared with the embodiment shown in FIG. 42,<br>
in the embodiment shown in FIG, 54, "medium<br>
manufacturer's name information" and "additional<br>
information from medium manufacturer" are erased, and<br>
recording mark polarity information (identification of<br>
"H-L" or "L-H") is arranged in 128 byte and subsequent.<br>
FIG. 43 shows a comparison of the contents of<br>
detailed information recorded in the allocation<br>
location information on the data area DTA recorded in<br>
byte 4 to byte 15 shown in FIG. 42 or 54. The start<br>
position information on the data area DTA is recorded<br>
in common regardless of identification of medium type,<br>
physical format information PFI, and R-physical format<br>
information R_PFI. As information indicating an end<br>
position, end position information on the data area DTA<br>
is recorded in a read-only type information storage<br>
medium.<br>
End position information on an additional writing<br>
enable range of the user data is recorded in the<br>
physical format information PFI contained in the writeonce<br>
type storage medium. This positional information<br>
denotes a position that immediately precedes point 5 in<br>
an example shown in FIG. 37E, for example.<br>
In contrast, the R-physical format information<br>
R_PFI contained in the write-once type information<br>
storage medium records the end position information on<br>
the recorded data contained in the corresponding<br>
bordered area BRDA.<br>
Further, the read-only type information storage<br>
medium records the end address information contained in<br>
"layer 0" which is a front layer when seen from the<br>
reproduction optical system; and the rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium records information on a<br>
differential value of each item of start position<br>
information between a land area and a groove area.<br>
As shown in FIG. 35C, a recording management zone<br>
RMZ exists in the data lead-in area DTLDI. In<br>
addition, as shown in FIG. 40 (d), the associated copy<br>
information exists in the border-out zone BRDO as copy<br>
information C_RMZ indicating the contents recorded in<br>
the recording management zone. This recording<br>
management zone RMZ records RMD (Recording Management<br>
Data) having the same data size as one physical segment<br>
block size, as shown in FIG. 36 (b), so that new<br>
recording management data RMD updated every time the<br>
contents of the recording management data RMD is<br>
updated can be sequentially added backwardly. A<br>
detailed data structure in such one item of recording<br>
management data RMD is shown in each of FIGS. 44, 45,<br>
46, 47, 48 and 49. The recording management data RMD<br>
is further divided into fine RMD field information RMDF<br>
of 2048 byte size.<br>
The first 2048 bytes in the recording management<br>
data are provided as a reserved area. The next RMD<br>
field 0 of 2048 byte size sequentially allocates:<br>
format code information of recording management data<br>
RMD; medium state information indicating a state of the<br>
target medium, i.e., (1) in an unrecorded state, (2) on<br>
the way of recording before finalizing, or (3) after<br>
finalizing; unique disk ID (disk identification<br>
information); allocation position information on the<br>
data region DTA; allocation position information on the<br>
latest (updated) data area DTA; and allocation position<br>
information on recording management data RMD. The<br>
allocation position information on the data area<br>
records information indicating a user data additional<br>
writing enable range 204 (FIG. 37D), i.e., start<br>
position information on the data area DTA and the end<br>
position information on the user data recording enable<br>
range 204 at the time of an initial state. In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 37D, this information<br>
indicates a position that immediately precedes point p.<br>
The present embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 37E and<br>
37F, is featured in that an expanded drive test zone<br>
EDRTZ and an expanded spare area ESPA can be<br>
additionally set in the user data additional writing<br>
enable range 204. However, such expansion narrows a<br>
user data additional writing enable range 205. The<br>
present embodiment is featured in that associated<br>
information is recorded in "allocation position<br>
information on the latest (updated) data area DTA" so<br>
as not to additionally write the user data in these<br>
expanded areas EDRTZ and ESPA. That is, it is possible<br>
to identify whether or not the expanded drive test zone<br>
EDRTZ has been expanded based on the identification<br>
information on the presence or absence of the expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ, and it is possible to identify<br>
whether or not the expanded spare area ESPA has been<br>
expanded based on identification information on the<br>
presence or absence of the expanded spare area ESPA.<br>
Further, the recording enable range information<br>
relating to the user data additional writing enable<br>
range 205 managed in the recording management data RMD<br>
includes an end position of the latest user data<br>
recording enable range 205 recorded in the allocation<br>
position information on the data area DTA. Therefore,<br>
the user data recording enable range 205 shown in<br>
FIG. 37F can be identified immediately, enabling high<br>
speed detection of a size of an unrecorded area in<br>
which recording can be carried out in the future (the<br>
residual amount of unrecorded area). In this manner,<br>
for example, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
a transfer rate at the time of optimal recording is set<br>
in conformance with the user specified image recording<br>
reserved time, thereby making it possible to fully<br>
record an image in a medium during the user specified<br>
image recording reserved time. By way of example of<br>
the embodiment shown in FIG. 37D, "the end position of<br>
the latest user data recording enable range 205"<br>
denotes a position that precedes point 8. These items<br>
of positional information can be described in ECC block<br>
address numbers according to another embodiment instead<br>
of being described in physical sector numbers. As<br>
described later, in the present embodiment, one ECC<br>
block is composed of 32 sectors. Therefore, the least<br>
significant five bits of the physical sector number of<br>
a sector arranged at the beginning in a specific ECC<br>
block coincides with that of a sector arranged at the<br>
start position in the adjacent ECC block. In the case<br>
where a physical sector number has been assigned so<br>
that the least significant five bits of the physical<br>
sector of the sector arranged at the beginning in the<br>
ECC block is "00000", the values of the least<br>
significant six bits or more of the physical sector<br>
numbers of all the sectors existing in the same ECC<br>
block coincide with each other. Therefore, address<br>
information obtained by eliminating the least<br>
significant five bit data of the physical sector<br>
numbers of the sectors existing in the same ECC block<br>
as above and sampling only data of the least<br>
significant six bit and subsequent is defined as ECC<br>
block address information (or ECC block address<br>
number). As described later, the data segment address<br>
information (or physical segment block number<br>
information recorded in advance by wobble modulation<br>
coincides with the above ECC block address. Thus, when<br>
the positional information contained in the recording<br>
management data RMD is described in the ECC block<br>
address numbers, there is attained advantageous effects<br>
described below:<br>
1) An access to an unrecorded area is accelerated<br>
in particular:<br>
- A differential calculation process is<br>
facilitated because a positional information unit of<br>
the recording management data RMD coincides with an<br>
information unit of data segment addresses recorded in<br>
advance by wobble modulation; and<br>
2) A management data size in the recording<br>
management data RMD can be reduced:<br>
- The number of bits required for describing<br>
address information can be reduced by 5 bits per<br>
address.<br>
As described later, a single physical segment<br>
block length coincides with a one data segment length,<br>
and the user data for one ECC block is recorded in one<br>
data segment. Therefore, an address is expressed as an<br>
"ECC block address number"; an "ECC block address"; a<br>
"data segment address", a "data segment number", or a<br>
"physical segment block number" and the like. These<br>
expressions have the same meaning.<br>
As shown in FIG. 44, in the allocation position<br>
information on the recording management data RMD<br>
existing in RMD field 0, size information in that the<br>
recording management zone RMZ capable of sequentially<br>
additionally writing the recording management data RMD<br>
is recorded in ECC block units or in physical segment<br>
block units. As shown in FIG. 36 (b), one recording<br>
management zone RMD is recorded on one by one physical<br>
segment block basis, and thus, based on this<br>
information, it is possible to identify how many times<br>
the updated recording management data RMD can be<br>
additionally written in the recording management zone<br>
RMZ. Next, a current recording management data number<br>
is recorded in the recording management zone RMZ. This<br>
denotes number information on the recording management<br>
data RMD which has been already recorded in the<br>
receding management zone RMZ. For example, assuming<br>
that this information corresponds to the information<br>
contained in the recording management data RMD#2 as an<br>
example shown in FIG. 36 (b), this information<br>
corresponds to the second recorded recording management<br>
data RMD in the receding management zone RMZ, and thus,<br>
a value "2" is recorded in this field. Next, the<br>
residual amount information contained in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ is recorded. This information<br>
denotes information on the item number of the recording<br>
management data RMD which can be further added in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ, and is described in<br>
physical segment block units (= ECC block units = data<br>
segment units). Among the above three items of<br>
information, the following relationship is established.<br>
 [Size information having set RMZ therein]<br>
= [Current recording management data number]<br>
+ [residual amount in RMZ]<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that the use<br>
amount or the residual amount information on the<br>
recording management data RMD contained in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ is recorded in a<br>
recording area of the recording management data RMD.<br>
For example, in the case where all information is<br>
recorded in one write-once type information storage<br>
medium once, the recording management data RMD may be<br>
recorded only once. However, in the case where an<br>
attempt is made to repeatedly record additional writing<br>
of the user data (additional writing of the user data<br>
in the user data additional writing enable range 205 in<br>
FIG. 37F) very finely in one write-once type<br>
information storage medium, it is necessary to<br>
additionally write recording management data RMD<br>
updated every time additional writing is carried out.<br>
In this case, if the recording management data RMD is<br>
frequently additionally written, the reserved area 273<br>
shown in FIG. 36 (b) is eliminated, and the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus requires<br>
countermeasures against this elimination. Therefore,<br>
the use amount or residual amount information on the<br>
recording management data RMD contained in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ is recorded in a<br>
recording area of the recording management data RMD,<br>
thereby making it possible to identify in advance a<br>
state in which additional writing in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ cannot be carried out and to take<br>
action by the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus earlier.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 37E to 37F, the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that the data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO can be set in the form such that the expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ is included (FIG. 1 (E4)). At<br>
this time, the start position of the data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO changes from point P to point £. In order to<br>
manage this situation, there is provided a field for<br>
recording the start position information on the data<br>
lead-out area DTLDO in the allocation position<br>
information of the latest (updated) data area DTA of<br>
the RMD field shown in FIGS. 44 to 49. As described<br>
previously, a drive test (test writing) is basically<br>
recorded in cluster units which can be expanded in data<br>
segment (ECC block) units. Therefore, although the<br>
start position information on the data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO is described in the ECC block address numbers,<br>
this information can be described in the physical<br>
sector number or physical segment block number, data<br>
segment address, or ECC block address of a physical<br>
sector first arranged in this first ECC block according<br>
to another embodiment.<br>
In an RMD field 1, there are recorded: update<br>
history information on an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus in which recording of<br>
the corresponding medium has been carried out. This<br>
information is described in accordance with a format of<br>
all recording condition information contained in<br>
information 264 (FIG. 42) in which manufacturer<br>
identification information for each information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus; serial numbers and<br>
model numbers described in ASCII codes; date and time<br>
information when recording power adjustment using a<br>
drive test zone has been made; and recording condition<br>
information provided at the time of additional writing<br>
can be set specific to each revision.<br>
An RMD field 2 is a user available area so that a<br>
user can record information recorded contents (or<br>
contents to be recorded), for example.<br>
The start position information of each border zone<br>
BRDZ is recorded in an RMD field 3. That is, as shown<br>
in FIG. 45, the start position information from the<br>
start to the fiftieth border out areas BTDOs is<br>
described in the physical sector numbers.<br>
For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 40<br>
(c), the start position of the first border out area<br>
BRDO indicates a position of point r|, and the start<br>
position of the second BRDO indicates a position of<br>
point 9.<br>
The positional information on an expanded drive<br>
test zone is recorded in an RMD field 4. First, there<br>
are recorded: the end position information on a<br>
location which has already been used for test writing<br>
in the drive test zone DRTZ which exists in the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI described in FIG. 36 (c); and the<br>
end position information on a location which has<br>
already been used for test writing in the drive test<br>
zone DRTZ which exists in the data lead-out area DTLDO<br>
described in FIGS. 37D to 37F. In the drive test zone<br>
DRTZ, the above position information is sequentially<br>
used for test writing from the inner periphery side<br>
(from the lowest physical sector number) to the outer<br>
periphery direction (in a direction in which the<br>
physical sector number is higher). Test writing is<br>
carried out in cluster units which are units of<br>
additional writing, as described later, and thus, ECC<br>
block units are used as location units. Therefore, in<br>
the case where the end position information on the<br>
location which has been already used for test writing<br>
is described in the ECC address numbers or is described<br>
in the physical sector numbers, there are described a<br>
physical sector number of a physical sector arranged at<br>
the end of the ECC block which has been used for test<br>
writing. Because a location used for test writing once<br>
has already been described, in the case where next test<br>
writing is carried out, such test writing is carried<br>
out from a next of the end position which has already<br>
been used for test writing. Therefore, the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus can identify<br>
momentarily from where test writing should be started<br>
by using the end position information (= a use amount<br>
in the drive test zone DRTZ) on a location which has<br>
already been used in the above drive test zone DRTZ.<br>
In addition, based on that information, this apparatus<br>
can judge whether or not a free space in which next<br>
test writing can be carried out exists in the drive<br>
test zone DRTZ. The drive test zone DRTZ which exists<br>
in the data lead-in area DTLDI records: flag<br>
information indicating whether or not area size<br>
information indicating that additional writing can be<br>
carried out; flag information indicating that this<br>
drive test zone DRTZ has been used up or area size<br>
information indicating that additional test writing can<br>
be further carried out in the drive test zone DRTZ<br>
which exists in the data lead-out area DLTDI; and area<br>
size information indicating that additional test<br>
writing can further be carried out in the drive test<br>
zone DRTZ which exists in the data lead-out area DTLDO<br>
or flag information indicating whether or not this<br>
drive test zone DRTZ has been used up. The size of the<br>
drive test zone DRTZ which exists in the data lead-in<br>
area DTLDI and the size of the drive test zone DRTZ<br>
which exists in the data lead-out area DTLDO are<br>
identified in advance, thus making it possible to<br>
identify the size (residual amount) of an area in which<br>
additional test writing can be carried out in the drive<br>
test zone DRTZ only based on the end position<br>
information on a location which has already been used<br>
for test writing in the drive test zone DRTZ which<br>
exists in the data lead-in area DTLDI or in the drive<br>
test zone DRTZ which exists in the data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO. However, this information is provided in the<br>
recording management data RMD, thereby making it<br>
possible to identify the residual amount in the drive<br>
test zone DRTZ immediately and to reduce a time<br>
required for judging whether or not to newly set the<br>
expanded drive test zone EDRTZ. According to another<br>
embodiment, in this field, it is possible to record:<br>
flag information indicating whether or not this drive<br>
test zone DRTZ has been used up instead of area size<br>
(residual amount) information indicating that<br>
additional writing can further be carried out in the<br>
drive test zone DRTZ. If a flag has already been set<br>
to identify momentarily that the above test zone has<br>
already been used up, it is possible to preclude a<br>
danger that test writing is carried out in this area.<br>
Additional setting count information on the next<br>
expanded drive test zone EDRTZ is recorded in the RMD<br>
field 4. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 37E, the<br>
expanded drive test zones EDRTZs are set in two zones,<br>
i.e., an expanded drive test zone 1 EDRTZl and an<br>
expanded drive test zone 2 EDRTZ2, and thus,<br>
"additional setting count of the expanded drive test<br>
zone EDRTZ = 2" is established. Further, range<br>
information for each expanded drive test zone EDRTZ and<br>
range information which has already been used for test<br>
writing are recorded in the RMD field 4. In this way,<br>
the positional information on the expanded drive test<br>
zone can be managed in the recording management data<br>
RMD, thereby enabling expansion setting of the expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ a plurality of times. In<br>
addition, in a write-once type information storage<br>
medium, the positional information on the expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ which has been sequentially<br>
expanded can be precisely managed in the form of<br>
updating and additional writing of the recording<br>
management data RMD, and it is possible to preclude a<br>
danger that the user data is overwritten on the<br>
expanded drive test zone EDRTZ while user data<br>
additional writing enable range 204 (FIG. 37D) is<br>
mistakenly determined. As described above, test<br>
writing units are also recorded in cluster units (ECC<br>
block units), and thus, the range of each expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ is specified in ECC block address<br>
units. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 37E, the start<br>
position information on the first set expanded drive<br>
test zone EDRTZ indicates point y because the expanded<br>
drive test zone 1 EDRTZl has been first set; and the<br>
end position information on the first set expanded<br>
drive test zone EDRTZ corresponds to a position that<br>
immediately precedes point p. Positional information<br>
units are described in the address numbers or physical<br>
sector numbers similarly. While the embodiment of<br>
FIGS. 44 and 45 shows the end position information on<br>
the expanded drive test zone EDRTZ, size information on<br>
the expanded drive test zone EDRTZ may be described<br>
without being limited thereto. In this case, the size<br>
of the first set expanded drive test zone 1 EDRTZl is<br>
set to "p-y". The end position information on a<br>
location which has already been used for test writing<br>
in the first set expanded drive test zone EDRTZ is also<br>
described with the ECC block address number or physical<br>
sector number. Then, the area size information<br>
(residual amount) in which additional test writing can<br>
be carried out in the first set expanded drive test<br>
zone EDRTZ. The size of the expanded drive test zone 1<br>
EDRTZl and the size of the area, which has already been<br>
used therein, is already been identified based on the<br>
above described information. Thus, the area size<br>
(residual amount) in which additional test writing can<br>
be carried out is already obtained. By providing this<br>
field, it is possible to identify immediately whether<br>
or not a current drive test zone will suffice when a<br>
new drive test (test writing) is carried out. In<br>
addition, it is possible to reduce a judgment time<br>
required for determining additional setting of a<br>
further expanded drive test zone EDRTZ. In this field,<br>
there can be recorded area size (residual amount)<br>
information indicating that additional writing can be<br>
carried out. According to another embodiment, in this<br>
field it is possible to set flag information indicating<br>
whether or not this expanded drive test zone EDRTZ has<br>
been used up. It is possible to preclude a danger that<br>
test writing is mistakenly carried out in this area, as<br>
long as a flag is set to momentarily identify that the<br>
test zone has already been used up.<br>
A description will be given with respect to an<br>
example of a processing method for newly setting an<br>
expanded drive test zone EDRTZ by the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 11 and<br>
carried out test writing in the zone.<br>
1) A write-once type information storage medium is<br>
mounted on an information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus.<br>
2) Data formed in the burst cutting area BCA is<br>
reproduced by the information recording/reproducing<br>
unit 141; the recorded data is supplied to the control<br>
unit 143; and the information is decoded in the control<br>
unit 143, and it is determined whether or not<br>
processing can proceeds to a next step.<br>
3) Information recorded in the control data zone<br>
CDZ in the system lead-in area SYLDI is recorded by the<br>
information recording/reproducing unit 141, and the<br>
reproduced information is transferred to the control<br>
unit 143.<br>
4) Values of rim intensities (in bytes 194 and 195<br>
shown in FIG. 42) when a recommended recording<br>
condition has been identified in the control unit 143<br>
are compared with a value of rim intensity of an<br>
optical head used at the information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141; and an area size<br>
required for test writing is identified.<br>
5) The information contained in recording<br>
management data is reproduced by the information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141, and the reproduced<br>
information is transferred to the control unit 143.<br>
The control section decodes the information contained<br>
in the RMD field 4 and determines whether or not there<br>
is a margin of an area size required for test writing,<br>
the size being identified in step 4). In the case<br>
where the judgment result is affirmative, processing<br>
proceeds to step 6). Otherwise, processing proceeds to<br>
step 9).<br>
6) A location for starting test writing is<br>
identified based on end position information on a<br>
location which has already been used for test writing<br>
in the drive test zone DRTZ or expanded drive test zone<br>
EDRTZ used for test writing from the RMD field 4.<br>
7) Test writing is executed by the size identified<br>
in step 4) from the location identified in step 6).<br>
8) The number of locations used for test writing<br>
has been increased in accordance with the processing in<br>
step 7), and thus, recording management data RMD<br>
obtained by rewriting the end position information on<br>
the locations which has already been used for test<br>
writing is temporarily stored in the memory unit 175,<br>
and processing proceeds to step 12).<br>
9) The information recording/reproducing unit 141<br>
reads information on "end position of the latest user<br>
data recording enable range 205" recorded in the RMD<br>
field 0 or "end position information on the user data<br>
additional writing enable range" recorded in the<br>
allocation location information on the data area DTA<br>
contained in the physical formed shown in FIG. 43; and<br>
the control unit 143 further internally sets the range<br>
of a newly set expanded drive test zone EDRTZ.<br>
10) Information on "end position of the latest<br>
used data recording enable range 205" recorded in the<br>
RMD field 0 based on the result described in step 9) is<br>
updated and additional setting count information on the<br>
expanded drive test zone EDRTZ contained in the RMD<br>
field 4 is incremented by one (that is, the count is<br>
added by 1); and further, the memory unit 175<br>
temporarily stores the recording management data RMD<br>
obtained by adding the start/end position information<br>
on the newly set expanded drive test zone EDRTZ.<br>
11) Processing moves from step 7) to step 12).<br>
12) Required user information additionally written<br>
into the user data additional writing enable range 205<br>
under an optimal recording condition obtained as a<br>
result of test writing carried out in step 7).<br>
13) The memory unit 175 temporarily stores the<br>
recording management data RMD updated by additionally<br>
writing the start/end position information (FIG. 47)<br>
contained in an R zone which has been newly generated<br>
in response to step 12).<br>
14) The control unit 143 controls the information<br>
recording/reproducing unit 141 to additionally record<br>
the latest recording management data RMD temporarily<br>
stored in the memory unit 175, in the reserved area 273<br>
(for example, FIG. 36 (b)) contained in the recording<br>
management zone RMZ.<br>
As shown in FIG. 47, positional information on the<br>
expanded spare area ESPA is recorded in an RMD field 5.<br>
In the write-once type information storage medium, a<br>
spare area can be expanded, and the positional<br>
information on that spare area is managed in the<br>
position management data RMD. In the embodiment shown<br>
in FIG. 37E, the expanded spare area ESPA is set in two<br>
areas, i.e., an expanded spare area 1 ESPA1 and an<br>
expanded spare area 2 ESPA2, and thus, "the number of<br>
additional settings of the expanded space area ESPA" is<br>
set to "2". The start position information on the<br>
first set expanded spare area ESPA corresponds to at a<br>
position of point 8; the end position information on<br>
the second set expanded spare area ESPA corresponds to<br>
at a position that precedes point y; the end position<br>
information on the first set expanded spare area ESPA<br>
corresponds to at a position that precedes point £; and<br>
the end position information on the second set expanded<br>
spare area ESPA corresponds to at a position of<br>
point E.<br>
The information relating to defect management is<br>
recorded in the RMD field 5 shown in FIG. 47. A first<br>
field in the RMD field 5 shown in FIG. 47 records ECC<br>
block number information or physical segment block<br>
number information which has already been used for<br>
substitution in the adjacent area to the data lead-in<br>
area DTLDI. In the present embodiment, a substituting<br>
process is carried out in ECC block units with respect<br>
to a defect area found in the user data additional<br>
writing range 204. As described later, one data<br>
segment configuring one ECC block is recorded in one<br>
physical segment block area, and thus, the substitution<br>
count which has already been done is equal to the<br>
number of ECC blocks which has already been used (or<br>
number of physical segment blocks and number of data<br>
segments). Therefore, the units of information<br>
described in this field are obtained as ECC block units<br>
or physical segment block units and data segment units.<br>
In the write-once type information storage medium, in<br>
the spare area SPA or expanded pare area ESPA, a<br>
location used as a replacing process may be often used<br>
sequentially from the inner periphery side having the<br>
lowest ECC block address number. Therefore, with<br>
respect to the information contained in this field, in<br>
another embodiment, it is possible to describe an ECC<br>
block address number as the end position information on<br>
a location which has already been used for<br>
substitution. As shown in FIG. 47, with respect to the<br>
first set expanded spare area 1 ESPA1 and the second<br>
set expanded spare area 2 ESPA2 as well, there exist<br>
fields for recording similar information ("ECC block<br>
number information or physical segment block number<br>
information which have already been used for<br>
substitution in the first set expanded spare area ESPA<br>
or end position information (ECC block address number)<br>
on a location which has been used for substitution";<br>
and "ECC block number information or physical segment<br>
block number information which have already been used<br>
for substitution in the second set expanded spare area<br>
ESPA or end position information (ECC block address<br>
number) on a location which has been used for<br>
substitution".<br>
Using these items of information, the following<br>
advantageous effects are attained:<br>
1) A spare location to be newly set with respect<br>
to a defect area found in the user data additional<br>
writing enable range 205 is identified immediately when<br>
next substituting process is carried out.<br>
- New substitution is carried out immediately<br>
after the end position of a location which has already<br>
been used for substitution.<br>
2) The residual amount in the spare area SPA or<br>
expanded spare area ESPA is obtained by calculation and<br>
(in the case where the residual amount is<br>
insufficient) , it is possible to identify necessity of<br>
setting a new expanded spare area ESPA.<br>
The size of the spare area SPA adjacent to the<br>
data lead-in area DTLDI is identified in advance, and<br>
thus, the residual amount in the spare area SPA can be<br>
calculated if there exists information relating to the<br>
number of ECC blocks which have already been used in<br>
the spare area SPA. However, the residual amount can<br>
be identified immediately by providing a recording<br>
frame of the ECC block number information or physical<br>
segment block number information in an unused location<br>
available for future substitution, which is residual<br>
amount information contained in the spare area SPA.<br>
Thus, it is possible to reduce a time required for<br>
judgment of the necessity of providing settings<br>
relating to a further expanded spare area ESPA. For a<br>
similar reason, there is provided a frame capable of<br>
recording "residual amount information contained in the<br>
first set expanded spare area ESPA and "residual amount<br>
information contained in the second set expanded spare<br>
area ESPA. In the present embodiment, a spare area SPA<br>
is extensible in the write-once type information<br>
storage medium, and the associated position information<br>
is managed in the recording management data RMD. As<br>
shown in FIGS. 37A to 37F, it is possible to<br>
extensively set an expanded spare area 1 ESPA1 and an<br>
expanded spare area 2 ESPA2 or the like at an arbitrary<br>
start position and at an arbitrary size as required in<br>
the user data additional writing enable range 204.<br>
Therefore, the additional setting count information on<br>
the expanded spare area ESPA is recorded in the RMD<br>
field 5, making it possible to set the start position<br>
information on the first set expanded spare area ESPA<br>
or the start position information on the secondly set<br>
expanded spare area ESPA. These items of start<br>
position information are described in physical sector<br>
numbers or ECC block address numbers (or physical<br>
segment block numbers or data segment addresses). In<br>
the embodiment shown in FIGS. 44 and 45, "the end<br>
position information on the first set expanded spare<br>
area ESPA" or "the end position information on the<br>
second set expanded spare area ESPA" are recorded as<br>
information for specifying the range of the expanded<br>
spare area ESPA. However, in another embodiment, in<br>
stead of these items of end position information, size<br>
information on the expanded spare area ESPA can be<br>
recorded by the ECC block number or physical segment<br>
block number, data segment number, and ECC block number<br>
or physical sector number.<br>
Defect management information is recorded in an<br>
RMD field 6. The present embodiment uses a method for<br>
improving reliability of information to be recorded in<br>
an information storage medium, the information relating<br>
to defect processing, in the following two modes:<br>
1) A conventional "replacing mode" for recording<br>
in a spare location information to be recorded in a<br>
defect location; and<br>
2) A "multiplying mode" for recording the same<br>
contents of information twice in a location which is<br>
different from another one on an information storage<br>
medium, thereby improving reliability.<br>
Information as to which mode processing is carried<br>
out is recorded in "type information on defect<br>
management processing" contained in secondary defect<br>
list entry information contained in the recording<br>
management data RMD as shown in FIG. 48. The contents<br>
of secondary defect list entry information are as<br>
follows:<br>
1) In the case of the conventional replacing mode<br>
Type information on defect management processing<br>
is set to "01" (in the same manner as in conventional<br>
DVD-RAM);<br>
The "positional information on a replacement<br>
source ECC block" used here denotes positional<br>
information on an ECC block found as a defect location<br>
in the user data additional writing enable range 205,<br>
and information to be essentially recorded in the range<br>
is recorded in a spare area or the like without being<br>
recorded in the above range; and<br>
The "positional information on a replacement<br>
destination ECC block" used here indicates positional<br>
information on a location of a replacement source to be<br>
set in the spare area SPA or expanded spare area I<br>
ESPA1, and an expanded spare area 2 ESPA2 shown in<br>
FIG. 37E, and the information to be recorded in a<br>
defect location, the information being found in the<br>
additional writing enable range 205, is recorded in the<br>
above area.<br>
2) In the case of the multiplying mode<br>
Type information on defect management processing<br>
is set to "10";<br>
The "positional information on replacement source<br>
ECC block" denotes a non-defect location, and indicates<br>
position information in which target information is<br>
recorded and the information recorded therein can be<br>
precisely reproduced; and<br>
The "positional information on replacement<br>
destination ECC block" indicates positional information<br>
on a location in which the completely same contents as<br>
the information recorded in the above described<br>
"positional information on replacement source ECC<br>
block" are recorded for the purpose of multiplication<br>
set in the spare area SPA or expanded spare area 1<br>
ESPA1 and expanded spare area 2 ESPA 2 shown in<br>
FIG. 37E.<br>
In the case where recording has been carried out<br>
in the above described "1) conventional replacing<br>
mode", it is confirmed that the information recorded in<br>
an information storage medium is precisely read out at<br>
the stage immediately after recording. However, there<br>
is a danger that the above described information cannot<br>
be reproduced due to scratch or dust adhering to an<br>
information storage medium, caused by the user's abuse.<br>
In contrast, in the case where recording has been<br>
carried out in the "2) multiplying mode", even if<br>
information cannot be partially read in an information<br>
storage medium due to a scratch or dust caused by<br>
user's abuse or the like, because the same information<br>
is backed up at another portion, the reliability of<br>
information reproduction is remarkably improved. The<br>
above backed up information is utilized for the<br>
information which cannot be read at this time, and the<br>
replacing process in "1) conventional replacing mode"<br>
is carried out, thereby further improving reliability.<br>
Therefore, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
high reliability of information reproduction after<br>
recorded, considering countermeasures against scratch<br>
or dust can be arranged by a processing operation in<br>
"1) conventional replacing mode" alone and by using a<br>
combination of the processing operation in "1)<br>
conventional replacing mode" and a processing mode in<br>
"2) multiplying mode". Methods for describing the<br>
positional information on the above ECC block include:<br>
a method for describing a physical sector number of a<br>
physical sector which exists at a start position which<br>
configures the above ECC block and a method for<br>
describing an ECC block address, a physical segment<br>
block address, or a data segment address. As described<br>
later, in the present embodiment, a data area including<br>
data of one ECC block size is referred to as a data<br>
segment. A physical segment block is defined as a<br>
physical unit on an information storage medium serving<br>
as a location for recording data, and one physical<br>
segment size coincides with a size of an area for<br>
recording one data segment.<br>
The present embodiment provides a mechanism<br>
capable of recording the defect position information<br>
detected in advance before the replacing process. In<br>
this manner, the manufacturers of information storage<br>
mediums check a defect state in the user data<br>
additional writing range 204 immediately before<br>
shipment. When the detected defect location is<br>
recorded in advance (before the replacing process) or<br>
the information recording/reproducing apparatus has<br>
carried out an initializing process at the user's site,<br>
the defect state in the user data additional writing<br>
enable range 294 is checked so that the detected defect<br>
location can be recorded in advance (before the<br>
replacing process). In this way, the information<br>
indicating a defect position detected in advance before<br>
the replacing process corresponds to "information on<br>
the presence or absence of the process for replacing a<br>
defect block with a spare block" (SLR: State of Linear<br>
Replacement) contained in the secondary defect list<br>
entry information.<br>
When the information SLR on the presence or<br>
absence of the process for replacing a defect block<br>
with a spare block is set to "0":<br>
- The replacing process is carried out with<br>
respect to a defect ECC block specified by "positional<br>
information on replacement source ECC block"; and<br>
Information, which can be reproduced, is recorded<br>
in a location specified by "positional information on<br>
replacement destination ECC block".<br>
When the information SLR on the presence or<br>
absence of the process for replacing a defect block<br>
with a spare block is set to "1":<br>
- A defect ECC block specified by "positional<br>
information on replacement source ECC block" denotes a<br>
defect block detected in advance at the state that<br>
precedes the replacing process; and<br>
A field of "positional information on replacement<br>
destination ECC block" is blanked (no information is<br>
recorded).<br>
When a defect location is thus identified in<br>
advance, there is attained advantageous effect that an<br>
optimal replacing process can be carried out at a high<br>
speed (and in a real time) at the stage at which an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus carries out<br>
additional writing in a write-once type information<br>
storage medium. In addition, in the case where video<br>
image information or the like is recorded in the<br>
information storage medium, it is necessary to<br>
guarantee continuity at the time of recording, and a<br>
high speed replacing process based on the above<br>
described information becomes important.<br>
If a defect occurs in the user data additional<br>
writing enable range 205, the replacing process is<br>
carried out in predetermined location placed in the<br>
spare area SPA or expanded spare area ESPA. Every time<br>
the replacing process is carried out, one item of<br>
Secondary Defect List Entry information is added; and<br>
set information on the positional information on an ECC<br>
block utilized as a substitute of the positional<br>
information on a defect ECC block is recorded in this<br>
RMD field 6. When additional writing of the user data<br>
is newly repeated in the user data additional writing<br>
enable range 205, if a new defect location is detected,<br>
the replacing process is carried out, and the number of<br>
items of the secondary defect list entry information<br>
increases. A management information area (RMD field 6)<br>
for defect management can be expanded by additionally<br>
writing the recording management data RMD with an<br>
increased number of items of this Secondary Defect List<br>
Entry information into the reserved area 273 contained<br>
in the recording management zone RMZ, as shown in<br>
FIG. 36 (b). By using this method, the reliability of<br>
defect management information itself can be improved<br>
for the reasons described below.<br>
1) The recording management data RMD can be<br>
recorded while avoiding a defect location in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ.<br>
- A defect location may be produced in the<br>
recording management zone RMZ shown in FIG. 36 (b).<br>
The contents of the recording management data RMD newly<br>
additionally written in the recording management zone<br>
RMZ are verified immediately after additional writing,<br>
thereby making it possible to sense a state in which<br>
recording cannot be carried out due to a defect. In<br>
that case, the recording management data RMD is<br>
rewritten adjacent to the defect location, thereby<br>
making it possible to record the recording management<br>
data RMD in the form such that high reliability is<br>
guaranteed.<br>
2) Even if the past recording management data RMD<br>
cannot be reproduced due to the scratch adhering to an<br>
information storage medium surface, a certain degree of<br>
backup can be carried out.<br>
- For example, in the case where the example shown<br>
in FIG. 36 (b) is taken, a state in which, after<br>
recording management data RMD#2 has been recorded, the<br>
information storage medium surface is scratched due to<br>
the user's mistake or the like, and then, the recording<br>
management data RMD#2 cannot be reproduced, is presumed<br>
as an example. In this case, a certain degree of the<br>
past defect management information (information<br>
contained in the RMD field 6) can be recovered by<br>
reproducing information on the recording management<br>
data RMD#1 instead.<br>
Size information on the RMD field 6 is recorded at<br>
the beginning of the RMD field 6, and this field size<br>
is made variable, thereby making it possible to expand<br>
the management information area (RMD field 6) for<br>
defect management. Each RMD field is set to 2048 size<br>
(for one physical sector size), as described<br>
previously. However, if a plenty of defects occur with<br>
the information storage medium, and then, the replacing<br>
process count increases, the size of the Secondary<br>
Detect List information increases, and the 2048 byte<br>
size (for one physical sector size) becomes<br>
insufficient. In consideration of this situation, the<br>
RMD field 6 can be set to a plurality of multiples of<br>
2048 size (recording across a plurality of sectors can<br>
be carried out). Namely, if "the size of the RMD field<br>
6" has exceeded 2048 bytes, an area for a plurality of<br>
physical sectors is arranged to the RMD field 6.<br>
The secondary defect list information SDL records:<br>
the secondary defect list entry information described<br>
above; "secondary defect list identification<br>
information" indicating a start position of the<br>
secondary defect list information SDL; and "secondary<br>
defect list update counter (update count information)"<br>
indicating count information as to how many times the<br>
secondary defect list information SDL has been<br>
rewritten. The data size of the whole secondary defect<br>
list information SDL can be identified based on "number<br>
information on the secondary defect list entry".<br>
As described previously, user data recording is<br>
locally carried out in units of R zone in the user data<br>
additional writing enable range 205. That is, part of<br>
the user data additional writing enable range 205<br>
reserved for receding the user data is referred to as<br>
an R zone. This R zone is divided into two types<br>
according to a recording condition. Among them, a type<br>
of zone in which additional user data can be further<br>
recorded is referred to as an Open R Zone, and a type<br>
of zone in which no further user data can be added is<br>
referred to as a Complete R Zone. The user data<br>
additionally writing enable range 205 cannot have three<br>
or more Open R zones. That is, up to two Open R zones<br>
can be set in the user data additional writing enable<br>
range 205. A location in which either of the above<br>
two types of R zones are not set in the user data<br>
additional writing enable range 205, i.e., a location<br>
in which the user data is reserved to record the user<br>
data (as either of the above two types of R zones), is<br>
referred to as an unspecified R zone (Invisible R<br>
Zone). In the case where the user data is fully<br>
recorded in the user data additional writing enable<br>
range 205, and then, no data can be added, this<br>
Invisible R zone does not exist. Up to 254-th R zone<br>
position information is recorded in an RMD field 7.<br>
The "whole R zone number information" first recorded in<br>
the RMD field 7 denotes a total number totalizing the<br>
number of Invisible R Zone logically established in the<br>
user data additional writing enable range 205, Open R<br>
Zones and the number of Complete R Zones. Next, the<br>
number information on the first Open R zone and the<br>
number information on the second Open R zones are<br>
recorded. As described previously, the user data<br>
additional writing enable range 205 cannot have three<br>
or more Open R zones, and thus, "1" or "0" is recorded<br>
(in the case where the first or second Open R zone does<br>
not exist). Next, the start position information and<br>
the end position information on the first Complete R<br>
zone are described in physical sector numbers. Then,<br>
the second to 254th start position information and end<br>
position information are sequentially described in the<br>
physical sector numbers.<br>
In an RMD field 8 and subsequent, the 255-th and<br>
subsequent start position information and end position<br>
information are sequentially described in the physical<br>
sector numbers, and a maximum of RMD fields 15 (a<br>
maximum of 2047 Complete R zones) can be described<br>
according to the number of Complete R Zones.<br>
FIGS. 51 and 52 each show another embodiment with<br>
respect to a data structure in the recording management<br>
data RMD shown in FIGS. 44 to 49.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, up to<br>
128 bordered areas BRDAs can be set on one write-once<br>
type information storage medium. Therefore, the start<br>
position information on the first to 128 border out<br>
areas BRDOs is recorded in the RMD field 3. In the<br>
case where (128 or less) bordered areas BRDAs are set<br>
midway, "OOh" is set as the start position information<br>
on the subsequent border out areas BRDOs. In this<br>
manner, it is possible to identify how many bordered<br>
areas BRDAs are set on the write-once information<br>
storage medium merely by checking to where the start<br>
position information on the border out areas BRDOs are<br>
recorded in the RMD field 3.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, up to<br>
128 expanded recording management zones RMZs can be set<br>
on one write-once information storage medium. As<br>
described above, there are two types of expanded<br>
recording management zones RMZs such as:<br>
1) an expanded recording management zone RMZ set<br>
in the border-in area BRDI; and<br>
2) an expanded recording management zone RMZ set<br>
by utilizing an R zone.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52,<br>
without discriminating these two types of RMZ zones,<br>
they are managed by receding a pair of the start<br>
position information on the expanded recording<br>
management zone RMZ (indicated by the physical sector<br>
number) and size information (number information on<br>
occupying physical sectors) in the RMD field 3. In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, although there has<br>
been recorded: information on a pair of the start<br>
position information (indicated by the physical sector<br>
number) and size information (number information on<br>
occupying physical sectors) on the expanded recording<br>
management zone RMZ, a set of the start position<br>
(indicated by the physical sector number) and the end<br>
position information (indicated by the physical sector<br>
number) on the expanded recording management zone RMZ<br>
may be recorded without being limited thereto. In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, although the<br>
expanded recording management zones RMZ numbers have<br>
been assigned in order set on the write-once type<br>
information storage medium, the expanded recording<br>
management data zone RMZ numbers can be assigned in<br>
order from the lowest physical sector number as a start<br>
position without being limited thereto. Then, the<br>
latest recording management data RMD is recorded, a<br>
currently used recording management zone (which is open<br>
to enable additional writing of RMD) is specified by<br>
the number of this expanded recording management zone<br>
RMZ. Therefore, the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus or the information reproducing apparatus<br>
identifies the start position information on the<br>
currently used (opened so that the RMZ can be<br>
additionally recorded) recording management zone based<br>
on these items of information, and carries out<br>
identification of which one is the latest recording<br>
management data RMD from the identified information.<br>
Even if the expanded recording management zone is<br>
arranged to be distributed onto the write-once type<br>
information storage medium, the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus or information<br>
reproducing apparatus can easily carry out<br>
identification of which one is the latest recording<br>
management data RMD by taking a data structure shown in<br>
FIGS. 51 and 52 each. Based on these items of<br>
information; the start position information on the<br>
currently used (opened) recording management zone is<br>
identified; and the location is accessed to identify to<br>
where the recording management data RMD has already<br>
been recorded. In this manner, the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus or the information<br>
reproducing apparatus can easily identify to where the<br>
updated latest recording management data may be<br>
recorded.<br>
In the case where 2) an expanded recording<br>
management zone RMZ set by utilizing an R zone has been<br>
set, one whole R zone corresponds to one expanded<br>
recording management zone RMZ. Thus, the physical<br>
sector number indicating the corresponding start<br>
position of the expanded recording management zone RMZ<br>
described in the RMD field 3 coincides with the<br>
corresponding physical sector number indicating the<br>
start position of the R zone described in the RMD<br>
fields 4 to 21.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, up to<br>
4606 (4351 + 255) R zones can be set in one write-once<br>
type information storage medium. This set R zone<br>
position information is recorded in the RMD field 4 to<br>
21. The start position information on each R zone is<br>
displayed by the information on the physical sector<br>
number, and the physical sector numbers LRAs (Last<br>
Recorded Addresses) indicating the end recording<br>
position in each R zone are recorded in pair. Although<br>
the R zones described in the recording management data<br>
RMD are set in order of setting R zones in the<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, these zones can be<br>
set in order from the lowest physical sector number<br>
indicating the start position information without being<br>
limited thereto. In the case where R zone setting of<br>
the corresponding number is not provided, "OOh" is<br>
recorded in this field. Number information on<br>
invisible R zone is described in the RMD field 4. This<br>
number information on invisible R zone is indicated by<br>
a total number of the number of invisible R zones<br>
(zones in which area reserved for data recording is not<br>
made in data area DTA); the number of open type R zones<br>
(zones each having an unrecorded area in which<br>
additional writing can be carried out); and the number<br>
of complete type R zones (R zones which are already<br>
complete and which does not have an unrecorded area in<br>
which additional writing can be carried out). In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52, it is possible to<br>
set up to two Open R zones in which additional writing<br>
can be carried out. In this way, by setting up to two<br>
Open R zones, it is possible to record video image<br>
information or audio information for which continuous<br>
recording or continuous reproduction must be guaranteed<br>
in one Open R zone, and then, separately record<br>
management information relevant to the video image<br>
information or audio information; general information<br>
used by a personal computer or the like; or file system<br>
management information in the remaining one Open R<br>
zone. Namely, it is possible to separately record<br>
plural items of information in another Open R zone<br>
according to type of user data to be recorded. This<br>
results in improved convenience in recording or<br>
reproducing AV information (video image information or<br>
audio information). In the embodiment shown in<br>
FIGS. 51 and 52, which R zone is an Open R zone is<br>
specified by the R zone allocation numbers arranged in<br>
the RMD fields 4 to 21. That is, the R zones are<br>
specified by the corresponding R zone number to the<br>
first and second Open R zones. A search can be easily<br>
made for the Open R zone by taking such a data<br>
structure. In the case where no Open R zone exists,<br>
"OOh" is recorded in that field. In the present<br>
embodiment, the end position of an R zone coincides<br>
with the end recording position in the Complete R zone,<br>
the end position of the R zone and the last recording<br>
position LRA in the R zone are different from each<br>
other in the Open T zone. On the way of additionally<br>
writing user information in the Open R zone (at a state<br>
that precedes completion of additional writing of the<br>
recording management data RMD to be updated), the end<br>
recording position and a recording position at which<br>
additional writing can be further carried out are<br>
shifted. However, after an additional writing process<br>
of user information has completed, after completing the<br>
additional writing process of the latest recording<br>
management data RMD to be recorded, the end recording<br>
position and an end recording position at which<br>
additional writing can be further carried out coincide<br>
with each other. Therefore, after completing the<br>
additional writing process of the latest recording<br>
management data RMD to be updated, in the case where<br>
additional writing of new user data is carried out, the<br>
control unit 143 in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus shown in FIG. 11<br>
carries out processing in accordance with procedures<br>
for:<br>
1) checking a number of an R zone which<br>
corresponds to the Open R zone described in the RMD<br>
field 4;<br>
2) checking a physical sector number indicating an<br>
end recording position in the Open R zone described in<br>
each of the RMD fields 4 to 21 to identify an end<br>
recording position at which additional writing can be<br>
carried out; and<br>
3) starting additional writing from the above<br>
identified end recording position NWA at which<br>
additional writing can be carried out.<br>
In this manner, a new additional writing start<br>
position is identified by utilizing Open R zone<br>
information in the RMD field 4, thereby making it<br>
possible to sample a new additional writing start<br>
position simply and speedily.<br>
FIG. 53 shows a data structure in an RMD field in<br>
the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51 and 52. As compared<br>
with the embodiment shown in FIGS. 44 to 49, there are<br>
added: address information on a location in which<br>
recording condition adjustment has been made in the<br>
inner drive test zone DRTZ (which belongs to the data<br>
lead-in area DTLDI); and address information on a<br>
location in which recording condition adjustment has<br>
been made in the outer drive test zone DRTZ (which<br>
belongs to the data lead-out area DTLDO). These items<br>
of information are described in the physical segment<br>
block address numbers. Further, in the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 53, there are added: information relating<br>
to a method for automatically adjusting a recording<br>
condition (running OPC); and the end DSV (Digital Sum<br>
Value) value at the end of recording.<br>
FIG. 56 shows an outline of converting procedures<br>
for, after an ECC block is configured of a data frame<br>
structure in which user data in units of 2048 bytes has<br>
been recorded, and then, sync codes have been added,<br>
forming a physical sector structure to be recorded in<br>
an information storage medium. These converting<br>
procedures are employed in common for a read-only type<br>
information storage medium, a write-once type<br>
information storage medium, and a rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium. According to each<br>
converting stage, a data frame, a scrambled frame, a<br>
recording flame, or recorded data field are defined.<br>
The data frame is a location in which user data is<br>
recorded. This frame is composed of: main data<br>
consisting of 2048 types; a four-type data ID; a<br>
two-byte ID error detecting code (IED); a six-byte<br>
reserved bytes (RSV); and a four-byte error detecting<br>
code (EDC). First, after an IED (ID error detecting<br>
code) has been added to a data ID described later, the<br>
6-byte reserved byte and main data consisting of<br>
2048 bytes and in which the user data is recorded are<br>
added. Then, an error detecting code (EDC) is added.<br>
Then, scrambling relevant to the main data is executed.<br>
Here, a Cross Reed-Solomon Error Correction Code is<br>
applied to these scrambled 32 data frames (scrambled<br>
frames), and an ECC encode processing operation is<br>
executed. In this manner, a recording frame is<br>
configured. This recording frame includes a parity of<br>
outer-code (PO) and a parity of inner-code (PI). The<br>
PO and PI each are error correcting codes produced with<br>
respect ECC blocks, each of which is formed of 32<br>
scrambled frames. The recording frame, as described<br>
previously, is subjected to ETM (Eight to Twelve<br>
Modulation) for converting eight data bits to 12-<br>
channel bits. Then, a sync code SYNC is added to the<br>
beginning on a 91 by 91 bytes basis, and 32 physical<br>
sectors are formed. As described in the lower right<br>
frame shown in FIG. 56, the present embodiment is<br>
featured in that one error correcting unit (ECC block)<br>
is composed of 32 sectors. As described later, the<br>
numbers "0" to 31" in each frame shown in FIG. 60 or 61<br>
indicate the numbers of physical sectors, respectively,<br>
and a structure is provided to ensure that one large<br>
ECC block is composed of a total of 32 physical<br>
sectors. In a next-generation DVD, even in the case<br>
where a scratch whose extent is identical to that of a<br>
current-generation DVD adheres to an information<br>
storage medium surface, it is required to enable<br>
reproduction of precise information by an error<br>
correction processing operation. In the present<br>
embodiment, recording density has been improved for the<br>
achievement of high capacity. As a result, in the case<br>
where a conventional one ECC block = 16 sectors, a<br>
length of a physical scratch which can be corrected by<br>
error correction is reduced as compared with a<br>
conventional DVD. As in the present embodiment, there<br>
is attained advantageous effect that one ECC block is<br>
composed of 32 sectors, thereby making it possible to<br>
increase an allowable length of a scratch on the<br>
information storage medium surface for which error<br>
correction can be carried out and to ensure<br>
compatibility/format continuity of a current DVD ECC<br>
block structure.<br>
FIG. 57 shows a structure in a data frame. One<br>
data frame is 2064 bytes consisting of 172 bytes x 2 x<br>
6 rows, and includes main data of 2048 bytes. IED is<br>
an acronym for IE Error Detection Code, and denotes a<br>
reserved area for enabling setting of information in<br>
the future. EDC is an acronym for Error Detection<br>
Code, and denotes an additional code for error<br>
detection of a whole data frame.<br>
FIG. 50 shows a data structure in a data ID shown<br>
in FIG. 57. The data ID is composed of items of<br>
information on data frames 921 and 922. The data frame<br>
number indicates a physical sector number 922 of the<br>
corresponding data frame.<br>
The data frame information 921 is composed of the<br>
following items of information.<br>
- Format type 931<br>
... Ob: This indicates CLV<br>
Ib: This indicates zone configuration<br>
- Tracking method 932<br>
... Ob: This is pit-compatible and uses a<br>
DPD (Differential Phase Detect) technique in the<br>
present embodiment<br>
Ib: This is pre-groove compatible and<br>
uses a push-pull technique or a DPP (Differential Push-<br>
Pull) technique.<br>
- Recording film reflection factor 933<br>
... Ob: 40% or more<br>
Ib: 40% or less<br>

FIG. 58A shows an example of default values<br>
assigned to a feedback shift register when a frame<br>
after scrambled is produced. FIG. 58B shows a circuit<br>
configuration of the feedback shift register for<br>
producing scrambled bytes. The values of r7 (MSB) to<br>
rO (LSB) are used as scramble bytes while they are<br>
shifted by 8 by 8 bit basis. As shown in FIG. 58A,<br>
16 types of preset values are provided in the present<br>
embodiment. The default preset numbers shown in<br>
FIG. 58A are equal to 4 bits of data ID (b7 (MSB) to b4<br>
(LSB)). When data frame scrambling is started, the<br>
default values of r!4 to rO must be set to the default<br>
preset values in a table shown in FIG. 58A. The same<br>
default preset value is used for 16 continuous data<br>
frames. Next, the default preset values are changed,<br>
and the changed same preset value is used for the 16<br>
continuous data frames.<br>
The least significant eight bits of the default<br>
values of r7 to rO are sampled as a scramble byte SO.<br>
Then, eight-bit shifting is carried out, and the<br>
scrambled byte is then sampled. Such an operation is<br>
repeated 2047 times.<br>
FIG. 59 shows an ECC block structure in the<br>
present embodiment. The ECC block is formed of 32<br>
scrambled frames. 192 rows + 16 rows are arranged in a<br>
vertical direction, and (172 + 10) x 2 columns are<br>
arranged in a horizontal direction. BQ,Q, B]_,Q, ...<br>
are one byte, respectively. PO and PI are error<br>
correction codes, and an outer parity and an inner<br>
parity. In the present embodiment, an ECC block<br>
structure using a multiple code is configured. That<br>
is, as error correction additional bits, a structure is<br>
provided such that, PI (Parity in) is added in a "row"<br>
direction, and PO (Parity out) is added in a "column"<br>
direction. A high error correction capability using an<br>
erasure correction and a vertical and horizontal<br>
repetitive correction process can be guaranteed by<br>
configuring such an ECC block structure using a<br>
multiple code. Unlike a conventional DVD ECC block<br>
structure, the ECC block structure shown in FIG. 59 is<br>
featured in that two Pis are set in the same "row".<br>
That is, PI of 10-byte size described at the center in<br>
FIG. 59 is added to 172 bytes arranged at the left<br>
side. That is, for example, 10-byte PI from BQ o to<br>
BO 172 is added to 172-byte data from BQ g to BQ 171/<br>
and 10-byte PI from 61,172 to Bl 181 i-s added to<br>
172-byte data from B]_ Q to Bl,171- The PI of 10-byte<br>
size described at the right end of FIG. 59 is added to<br>
172 bytes arranged at the center on the left side of<br>
the figure 59. That is, for example, 10-byte PI from<br>
Eg 354 to BQ 363 are added to 172-byte data from &amp;QriQ2<br>
to B0,353-<br>
FIG. 60 shows an illustration of a frame<br>
arrangement after scrambled. Units of (6 rows x<br>
172 bytes) are handled as one frame after scrambled.<br>
That is, one ECC block is formed of 32 frames after<br>
scrambled. Further, this system handles a pair of<br>
(block 182 bytes x 207 bytes). When L is assigned to<br>
the number of each frame after scrambled, in the left<br>
side ECC block, and R is assigned to the number of each<br>
frame after scrambled in the right side ECC block, the<br>
frames after scrambled are arranged as shown in<br>
FIG. 60. That is, the left and right frames after<br>
scrambled exist alternately at the left side block, and<br>
the frames after scrambled exist alternately at the<br>
right side block.<br>
That is, the ECC block is formed of 32 frames<br>
after continuously scrambled. Lines of the left half<br>
of odd numbered sectors each are exchanged with those<br>
of the right half. 172 x 2 bytes x 192 rows are equal<br>
to 172 bytes x 12 rows x 32 scrambled frames, and are<br>
obtained as a data area. 16-byte PO is added to form<br>
an outer code of RS (208, 192, 17) in each 172 x<br>
2 columns. 10-byte PI (RS (182, 172, 11)) is added to<br>
each 208 x 2 rows in the left and right blocks. PI is<br>
added to a row of PO as well. The numerals in frames<br>
indicate scrambled frame numbers, and suffixes R and L<br>
denote the right half and the left half of the<br>
scrambled frame. The present embodiment is featured in<br>
that the same data frame is arranged to be distributed<br>
in a plurality of small ECC blocks. Specifically, in<br>
the present embodiment, a large one ECC block is<br>
composed of two small ECC blocks, and the same data<br>
frame are arranged to be alternately distributed into<br>
two small ECC blocks. As has already been described in<br>
FIG. 59, PI of 10-byte size described at the center is<br>
added to 172 bytes arranged at the left side, and PI of<br>
10 byte size described on the right end is added to<br>
172 bytes arranged at the center on the left side.<br>
Namely, the left side small ECC block is composed of<br>
continuous PI of 10 bytes from the left end of FIG. 59,<br>
and the right side small ECC block is composed of<br>
10 bytes at the right end from the central 172 bytes.<br>
The signs in each frame are set in response to these<br>
blocks in FIG. 60. For example, "2-R" denotes which of<br>
a data frame number and the left and right small ECC<br>
blocks one belongs to (for example, one belongs to<br>
right side small ECC block in second data frame). As<br>
described later, with respect to each of the finally<br>
configured physical sectors, the data contained in the<br>
same physical sector is also alternately arranged to be<br>
distributed into the left and right small ECC blocks<br>
(the columns of the left half in FIG. 61 are included<br>
in the left side small ECC block (small ECC block "A"<br>
on the left side shown in FIG. 64), and the column of<br>
the right half are included in small ECC blocks (small<br>
ECC block B on the right side shown in FIG. 64).<br>
Thus, when the same data frame is arranged to be<br>
distributed in a plurality of small ECC blocks, the<br>
reliability of recording data is improved by improving<br>
an error correction capability of the data contained in<br>
a physical sector (FIG. 61). For example, let us<br>
consider a case in which a track fails at the time of<br>
recording; the recorded data is overwritten; and data<br>
for one physical sector is damaged. In the present<br>
embodiment, the damaged data contained in one sector is<br>
subjected to error correction by using two small ECC<br>
blocks; a burden on error correction in one ECC block<br>
is reduced; and error correction with better<br>
performance is guaranteed. In the present embodiment,<br>
even after forming an ECC block, a structure is<br>
provided such that a data ID is arranged at the start<br>
position of each sector, thus making it possible to<br>
check a data position at the time of access at a high<br>
speed.<br>
FIG. 61 shows an illustration of a PO interleaving<br>
method. As shown in FIG. 61, 16 parities are<br>
distributed on one by one row basis. That is,<br>
16 parity rows are arranged on a one by one row basis<br>
with respect to two recording frames placed.<br>
Therefore, a recording fame consisting of 12 rows is<br>
obtained as 12 rows + 1 row. After this row<br>
interleaving has been carried out, 13 rows x 182 bytes<br>
are referred to as a recording frame. Therefore, an<br>
ECC block after row interleaved is formed of 32<br>
recording frames. In one recording, as described in<br>
FIG. 60, 6 rows exist in each of the right side and<br>
left side blocks. POs are arranged so as to be<br>
positioned in different rows between a left block (182<br>
x 208 bytes) and a right block (182 x 208 bytes).<br>
FIG. 61 shows one complete type ECC block. However, at<br>
the time of actual data reproduction, such ECC blocks<br>
continuously arrive at an error correction processing<br>
section. In order to improve such an error correction<br>
processing capability, there is employed an<br>
interleaving system as shown in FIG. 61.<br>
Referring to FIG. 61, a detailed description will<br>
be given with respect to a relationship from a<br>
structure in one data frame shown in FIG. 57 to a PO<br>
interleaving method shown in FIG. 61. FIG. 64 is an<br>
enlarged view showing, an upper side portion of an EC<br>
block structure after PO-interleaved shown in FIG. 61,<br>
wherein allocation locations of data ID, IED, RSV, and<br>
EDC shown in FIG. 57 are explicitly indicated, thereby<br>
visually identifying a series of conversion from<br>
FIGS. 57 to 61. "0-L" "0-R", "1-R", and "1-L" shown in<br>
FIG. 64 correspond to "0-L", "0-R", "1-R", and "1-L"<br>
shown in FIG. 60, respectively. The "0-L" and "1-L"<br>
denote data obtained after only the main data has been<br>
scrambled with respect to the left half shown in<br>
FIG. 57, that is, a set composed of 172 bytes and six<br>
rows from the center line to the left side. Similarly,<br>
the "0-R" and "1-R" denote data obtained after only the<br>
main data has been scrambled with respect to the right<br>
half shown in FIG. 57, that is, a set composed of 172<br>
bytes and six rows from the center line to the right<br>
side. Therefore, as is evident from FIG. 57, data ID,<br>
IED, and RSV are arranged in order from the beginning<br>
of the first row (row 0) to byte 12 of "0-L" and "1-L".<br>
In FIG. 64, the centerline to the left side configures<br>
the left side small ECC block "A", and the centerline<br>
to the right side configures the right side small ECC<br>
block "B". Therefore, as is evident from FIG. 64, data<br>
ID#1, data ID#2, IED#0, IED#2, RSV#0, and RSV#2<br>
included in "0-L" and "2-L" are included in the left<br>
side small ECC block "A". In FIG. 60, "0-L" and "2-L"<br>
are arranged at the left side, and "0-R" and "2-E" are<br>
arranged at the right side. In contrast, "1-R" and<br>
"1-L" are arranged at the left and right sides,<br>
respectively. Data ID#1, IED#1, and RSV#1 are arranged<br>
from the beginning to byte 12 of the first row in<br>
"1-L". Thus, as a result of reversing the left and<br>
right allocations, as is evident from FIG. 64, data<br>
ID#1, IED#1, and RSV#1 included in "1-L" is configured<br>
in the right side small ECC block "B". In the present<br>
embodiment, a combination of "0-L" and "0-R" in FIG. 64<br>
is referred to as a "0-th recording frame" and a<br>
combination of "1-L" and "1-R" is referred to as a<br>
"first recording frame". The boundary between the<br>
recording frames are indicated by the bold characters<br>
shown in FIG. 64. As is evident from FIG. 64, data ID<br>
is arranged at the beginning of each recording frame<br>
and PO and PI-L are arranged at the end of each<br>
recording frame. As shown in FIG. 64, the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that small ECC blocks in<br>
which data ID is included are different from each other<br>
depending on the odd-numbered and even-numbered<br>
recording frames, and data ID, IED, and RSV are<br>
alternately arranged in the left side and right side<br>
small ECC blocks "A" and "B" in accordance with<br>
continuous recording frames. The error correction<br>
capability in one small ECC lock is limited, and error<br>
correction is disabled with respect to a random error<br>
exceeding a specific number or a burst error exceeding<br>
a specific length. As described above, data ID, IED,<br>
and RSV are alternately arranged in the left side and<br>
right side small ECC blocks "A" and "B", thereby making<br>
it possible to improve the reliability of reproduction<br>
of data ID. That is, even if a defect on an<br>
information storage medium frequently occurs, disabling<br>
error correction of any of the small ECC blocks and<br>
disabling decoding of data ID to which the faulty block<br>
belongs, data ID, IED, and RSV are alternately arranged<br>
in the left side and right side small ECC blocks "A"<br>
and "B", thus enabling error correction in the other<br>
small ECC block and enabling decoding the remaining<br>
data ID. Because the address information contained in<br>
data ID continuously lasts, the information on data ID<br>
is used, enabling interpolation with respect to the<br>
information on data ID which has not been successfully<br>
decoded. As a result, the access reliability can be<br>
improved according to the embodiment shown in FIG. 64.<br>
The numbers parenthesized at the left side of FIG. 64<br>
denote row numbers in an ECC block after POinterleaved.<br>
In the case where numbers are recorded in<br>
an information storage medium, row numbers are<br>
sequentially recorded from the left to the right. In<br>
FIG. 64, data ID intervals included in each recording<br>
frame are always constantly arranged, and thus, there<br>
is attained advantageous effect that data ID position<br>
searching capability is improved.<br>
A physical sector structure is shown in FIGS. 62A<br>
and 62B. FIG. 62A shows an even numbered physical<br>
sector structure, and FIG. 62B show an odd numbered<br>
data structure. In FIGS. 62A and 62B, with respect to<br>
both of an even recorded data field and an odd recorded<br>
data field, outer parity PO information shown in<br>
FIG. 61 is inserted into a sync data area contained in<br>
the last 2 sync frames (i.e., in a portion at which the<br>
last sync code is SYS and a portion at which the<br>
immediately succeeding sync data and sync code is SY1;<br>
and a portion at which sync code is SYl and a portion<br>
at which the immediately succeeding sync data is<br>
arranged in the sync data area shown in FIG. 61 wherein<br>
information of outer parity PO is inserted).<br>
Part of the left side PO shown in FIG. 60 is<br>
inserted at the last two sync frames in the even<br>
recorded data field, and part of the right side PO<br>
shown in FIG. 60 is inserted at the last two sync<br>
frames in the odd recorded data field. As shown in<br>
FIG. 60, one ECC block is composed of the left and<br>
right small ECC blocks, respectively, and the data on<br>
PO groups alternately different depending on sectors<br>
(the data on PO belonging to left small ECC block or<br>
the data on PO belonging to right small ECC block) is<br>
inserted. The even numbered physical sector structure<br>
shown in FIG. 62A and the odd numbered data structure<br>
shown in FIG. 62B are divided into two sections at a<br>
center line. The left side "24 + 1092 + 24 + 1092<br>
channel bits are included in the left side small ECC<br>
block shown in FIG. 59 or 60, and the right side "24 +<br>
1092 + 24 + 1092 channel bits are included in the right<br>
side small ECC block shown in FIG. 59 or 60. In the<br>
case where the physical sector structure shown in<br>
FIGS. 62A and 62B is recorded in an information storage<br>
medium, this structure is serially recorded on one by<br>
one column base. Therefore, for example, in the case<br>
where channel bit data on an even numbered physical<br>
sector structure shown in FIG. 62A is recorded in an<br>
information storage medium, the data on 2232 channel<br>
bits first recorded is included in the left side small<br>
ECC block, and the data on the 2232 channel bits<br>
recorded next is included in the right side small EC<br>
block. Further, the data on 2232 channel bits recorded<br>
next is included in the left side small ECC block. In<br>
contrast, in the case where the channel bit data on an<br>
odd numbered data structure shown in FIG. 62B is<br>
recorded in an information storage medium, the data on<br>
2232 channel bits first recorded is included in the<br>
right side small ECC block, and the data on the 2232<br>
channel bits recorded next is included in the left side<br>
small EC block. Further, the data on 2232 channel bits<br>
recorded next is included in the right side small ECC<br>
block. Thus, the present embodiment is featured in<br>
that the same physical sector is alternately included<br>
in two small ECC blocks on a 2232 by 2322 channel bit<br>
basis. In other words, a physical sector is formed in<br>
the shape such that the data included in the right side<br>
small ECC block and included in the left side small ECC<br>
block are alternately arranged to be distributed on a<br>
2232 by 2332 channel bit basis, and the formed physical<br>
sector is recorded in an information storage medium.<br>
As a result, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
a structure strong to a burst error can be provided.<br>
For example, let us consider a state in which a<br>
lengthwise scratch occurs in a circumferential<br>
direction of an information storage medium, and there<br>
occurs a burst error which disables decoding of data<br>
exceeding 172 bytes. In this case, a burst error<br>
exceeding 172 bytes is arranged to be distributed in<br>
two small ECC blocks. Thus, a burden on error<br>
correction in one ECC block is reduced, and error<br>
correction with better performance is guaranteed.<br>
The present embodiment is featured by, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 62A and 62B, a data structure in a physical<br>
sector is different from another depending on whether<br>
or not the physical sector number of a physical sector<br>
configuring one ECC block is an even number or an odd<br>
number. Namely,<br>
1) Small ECC blocks (right side or left side) to<br>
which the first 2232 channel bit data of a physical<br>
sector belongs are different from each other; and<br>
2) There is provided a structure in which data on<br>
a PO group alternately different from each other<br>
depending on sectors is inserted.<br>
As a result, in order to guarantee a structure in<br>
which data ID is arranged at the start position of all<br>
the physical sectors even after an ECC block has been<br>
configured, a data position check at the time of access<br>
can be made at a high speed. In addition, POs which<br>
belong to different small ECC blocks are mixed and<br>
inserted into the same physical sector, structurally<br>
simplifying a method employing a PO inserting method as<br>
shown in FIG. 61, facilitating information sampling on<br>
a sector by sector manner after error correction<br>
processing in an information reproducing apparatus; and<br>
simplifying an ECC block data assembling process in an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus.<br>
In a method for specifically achieving the above<br>
contents, PO interleaving and inserting positions have<br>
different structures depending on the left and right.<br>
Portions indicated by the narrow double lines shown in<br>
FIG. 61 or portions indicated by the narrow double line<br>
and shading indicate the PO interleaving and inserting<br>
positions. PO is inserted at the left end in an even<br>
numbered physical sector number or at the right end in<br>
an odd numbered physical sector number. By employing<br>
this structure, even after an ECC block has configured,<br>
data ID is arranged at the start position of a physical<br>
sector, thus making it possible to check a data<br>
position at the time of access at high speed.<br>
FIG. 63 shows an embodiment of specific pattern<br>
contents from sync codes "SYO" to "SYS" shown in<br>
FIGS. 62A and 62B. Three states from State 0 to State<br>
2 are provided in accordance with a modulation rule<br>
according to the present embodiment (a detailed<br>
description will be given later). Four sync codes from<br>
SYO to SYS are set, and each code is selected from the<br>
left and right groups shown in FIG. 63 according to<br>
each state. In a current DVD specification, as a<br>
modulation system, there employed RLL(2, 10) of 8/16<br>
modulation (8 bits are converted to 16 channel bits (a<br>
minimum value is 2 and a maximum value is 10 when Run<br>
Length Limit: d = 2, k = 10: "0" continuously lasts),<br>
four states from State 1 to State 4, i.e., eight types<br>
of sync codes from SYO to SY7 are set. In comparison,<br>
in the present embodiment, types of sync codes are<br>
decreased. In an information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus or an information reproducing apparatus, at<br>
the time of information reproduction from an<br>
information storage medium, types of sync code is<br>
identified in accordance with a pattern matching<br>
technique. As in the present embodiment, by<br>
significantly decreasing types of sync codes, target<br>
patterns required for matching are decreased in number;<br>
a processing operation required for pattern matching is<br>
simplified; and the processing efficiency is improved,<br>
making it possible to improve a recognition speed.<br>
In FIG. 63, a bit (channel bit) indicated by "#"<br>
denotes a DSV (Digital Sum Value) control bit. As<br>
described later, the above DSV control bit is<br>
determined so as to suppress a DC component by means of<br>
a DSV controller (so as to make a value of DSM close to<br>
0). The present embodiment is also featured in that a<br>
polarity inversion channel bit "#" is included in a<br>
sync code. There is attained advantageous effect that<br>
a value of "#" can be selected as "1" or "0" so that<br>
the DSV value is close to "0" in a macroscopic point of<br>
view, including both frame data fields (1092 channel<br>
bit fields shown in FIGS. 62A and 62B) sandwiching the<br>
above sync code, enabling DSV control from the<br>
macroscopic point of view.<br>
As shown in FIG. 63, the sync codes in the present<br>
embodiment is composed of the sections below.<br>
1) Sync position detecting code section<br>
This section has a common pattern in all sync<br>
codes, and forms a fixed code area. A sync code<br>
allocation position can be detected by detecting this<br>
code. Specifically, this section denotes the last 18<br><br>
channel bits "010000 000000 001001" in each sync code<br>
in FIG. 63.<br>
2) Modulation conversion table selector code<br>
section<br>
This section forms part of a variable code area,<br>
and changes in response to state number at the time of<br>
modulation. The first channel bit shown in FIG. 63<br>
corresponds to this section. That is, in the case<br>
where one of State 1 and State 2 is selected, the first<br>
channel bit is set to "1" in any of the codes from SYO<br>
to SYY3. When State 0 is selected, the first channel<br>
bit of a sync code is set to "1". However, as an<br>
exception, the first channel bit of SY3 in State 0 is<br>
set to "0".<br>
3) Sync frame position identification code section<br>
Part of a variable code area is composed of codes<br>
identifying types from SYO to SY3 in sync codes. The<br>
first to sixth channel bit section in each sync code<br>
shown in FIG. 63 corresponds to this section. As<br>
described later, a relative position in the same sector<br>
can be detected from a connection pattern of three by<br>
three sync codes continuously detected.<br>
4) DC suppressing polarity inversion code section<br>
A channel bit at a position "#" shown in FIG. 63<br>
corresponds to this section. As described above, this<br>
bit is inverted or non-inverted, thereby making close<br>
to "0" the DSV value of a channel bit pattern including<br>
the preceding and succeeding frame data.<br>
In the present embodiment, 8/12 modulation (ETM:<br>
Eight to Twelve Modulation), RLL (1, 10) is employed as<br>
a modulation method. That is, eight bits are converted<br>
to 12-cahnnel bits at the time of modulation, and a<br>
minimum value (d value) is set to 1, and a maximum<br>
value (k value) is set to 10 in a range such that the<br>
settings "0" after converted are continuous. In the<br>
present embodiment, although high density can be<br>
achieved more significantly than conventionally by<br>
setting d = 1, it is difficult to obtain a sufficiently<br>
large reproduction signal amplitude at a site indicated<br>
by the mark indicating the highest density.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIG. 11, an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the<br>
present embodiment has the PR equalizing circuit 130<br>
and the Viterbi decoder 156, and enables very stable<br>
signal reproduction by using a PRML (Partial Response<br>
Maximum Likelihood) technique. In addition, k = 10 is<br>
set, and thus, there is no case in which eleven or more<br>
"0" settings are continuous in the modulated general<br>
channel bit data. By utilizing this modulation rule,<br>
the above sync position detecting code section has a<br>
pattern which hardly appears in the modulated general<br>
channel bit data. That is, as shown in FIG. 63, in the<br>
sync position detecting code section, 12 (= k + 2) "0"s<br>
are continuously arranged. The information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus or the information<br>
reproducing apparatus finds this section and detects a<br>
position of the sync position detecting code section.<br>
In addition, if "0" continuously lasts too much, a bit<br>
shift error is likely to occur. Thus, in order to<br>
reduce this problem, in the sync position detecting<br>
code section, a pattern having less continuous "0"s is<br>
arranged immediately after that portion. In the<br>
present embodiment, d = 1, and thus, it is possible to<br>
set "101" as the corresponding pattern. However, as<br>
described above, a sufficiently large reproduction<br>
signal amplitude is hardly obtained at a site of "101"<br>
(at a site indicating the highest density), and thus,<br>
"1001" is arranged instead, obtaining a pattern of the<br>
sync position detecting code section as shown in<br>
FIG. 63.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that, as<br>
shown in FIG. 63, 18 channel bits at the back side in a<br>
sync code are independently used as (1) sync position<br>
detecting code section, and the front side 6 channel<br>
bits are used as (2) modulation conversion table<br>
selector code section; (3) sync frame position<br>
identification code section; or (4) DC suppression<br>
polarity inversion code section. There is attained<br>
advantageous effect that in the sync codes, the sync<br>
position detecting code section in item (1) is provided<br>
independently, thereby facilitating single detection<br>
and enhancing sync position detecting precision; the<br>
code sections in items (2) to (4) are used in common in<br>
the 6-channel bits, thereby reducing the data size of<br>
the whole sync codes (channel bit size); and a sync<br>
data occupying rate is increased, thereby improving<br>
substantial data efficiency.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that, from<br>
among four types of sync codes shown in FIG. 63, only<br>
SYO is arranged at the first sync frame position in a<br>
sector, as shown in FIGS. 62A and 62B. Advantageous<br>
effect thereof includes that the start position in a<br>
sector can be identified immediately merely by<br>
detecting SYO, and the start position sampling process<br>
in the sector is extremely simplified.<br>
The present embodiment is also featured in that<br>
all of the combination patterns of three continuous<br>
sync codes are different from each other in the same<br>
sector.<br>
A detailed description will be given with respect<br>
to the pattern contents of a reference code recorded in<br>
the reference code recording zone RCZ shown in<br>
FIGS. 35A to 35C. In a current DVD, an "8/16<br>
modulation" system for converting 8-bit data to 16-<br>
channel bits is employed as a modulation system. As a<br>
pattern of a reference code serving as a channel bit<br>
pattern recorded in an information storage medium after<br>
modulated, there is employed a repetition pattern<br>
"00100000100000010010000010000001". In comparison with<br>
this pattern, in the present embodiment, ETM modulation<br>
for modulating 8-bit data into 12-channel bits is used<br>
as shown in FIGS. 32 to 34, providing an RLL (1, 10)<br>
5 run length restriction. In addition, the PRML<br>
technique is employed for signal reproduction from the<br>
data lead-in area DTLDI, data area DTA, data lead-out<br>
area DTLDO, and middle area MDA. Therefore, there is a<br>
need for setting the above described modulation rule<br>
10 and a pattern of a reference code optimal for PRML<br>
detection. In accordance with the RLL(1, 10) run<br>
length restriction, a minimum value of continuous "0"<br>
settings is "d = 1", and is a repetition pattern of<br>
"10101010". Assuming that a distance from a code "0"<br>
15 to the next adjacent code is "T", a distance relevant<br>
to the adjacent "1" in the above pattern is obtained as<br>
"2T". In the present embodiment, in order to achieve<br>
high density of an information storage medium, as<br>
described previously, a reproduction signal from the<br>
20 repetition pattern ("10101010") of "2T" recorded on the<br>
information storage medium is close to a shutdown<br>
frequency of MTF (Modulation Transfer Function)<br>
characteristics of an objective lens in an optical head<br>
(exists in the information recording/reproducing unit<br>
25 141 shown in FIG. 11); and thus, a degree of modulation<br>
(signal amplitude) is hardly obtained. Therefore, in<br>
the case where a reproduction signal from a repetition<br>
pattern ("10101010") of "2T" has been used as a<br>
reproduction signal used for circuit tuning of the<br>
information reproducing apparatus or the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus (for example,<br>
5 initialing and optimizing tap coefficients in the tap<br>
controller 332 shown in FIG. 15), noise effect is<br>
significant, and stabilization is poor. Therefore,<br>
with respect to a signal after modulated in accordance<br>
with RLL(1, 10) run length restriction, then, it is<br>
10 desirable to carry out circuit tuning by using a<br>
pattern of "3T" having high density. In the case where<br>
a digital sum value (DSV) of the reproduction signal is<br>
considered, an absolute value of a DC (direct current)<br>
value increases in proportion to the number of<br>
15 continuous "0"s between "1" and next "1" that<br>
immediately follows it, and the increased value is<br>
added to the immediately preceding DSV value. The<br>
polarity of this added DC value is inverted every time<br>
"1" is reached. Therefore, as a method for setting the<br>
20 DSV value to "0" where a channel bit pattern having<br>
continuous reference code is followed, the DSV value is<br>
set to be "0" in 12 channel bit patterns after ETMmodulated,<br>
whereby the degree of freedom in reference<br>
code pattern design is increased more significantly by<br>
25 setting to an odd number the number of generated "1"<br>
appearing in 12 channel bit patterns after ETMmodulated;<br>
offsetting a DC component generated in one<br>
set of reference code cells consisting of a next set.<br>
Therefore, in the present embodiment, the number of "1"<br>
appearing in the reference code cells consisting of<br>
12 channel bit patterns after ETM-modulated is set to<br>
5 an odd number. In the present embodiment, in order to<br>
achieve high density, there is employed a mark edge<br>
recording technique in which a location of "1"<br>
coincides with a boundary position of a recording mark<br>
or an emboss pit. For example, in the case where a<br>
10 repetition pattern of "3T" ("100100100100100100100") is<br>
followed, there occurs a case in which a length of a<br>
recording mark or an emboss pit and a length of a space<br>
between the mark and pit are slightly different from<br>
each other depending on a recording condition or an<br>
15 original master producing condition. In the case where<br>
the PRML detecting technique has been employed, a level<br>
value of a reproduction signal becomes very important.<br>
As described previously, even in the case where the<br>
length of the recording mark or emboss pit and the<br>
20 length of the space between the mark and pit are<br>
different from each other, there occurs a necessity of<br>
correcting such slightly different component in a<br>
circuit manner so as to enable signal detection stably<br>
and precisely. Therefore, a reference code for tuning<br>
25 a circuit constant has a space with a length of "3T",<br>
like a recording mark or an emboss pit with a length of<br>
"3T", thereby improving the precision of tuning a<br>
circuit constant. Thus, if a pattern of "1001001" is<br>
included as a reference code pattern according to the<br>
present embodiment, the recording mark or emboss pit<br>
having the length "3T"; and a space are always<br>
5 arranged. In addition, circuit tuning also requires a<br>
pattern in a non-dense state as well as a pattern<br>
("1001001") having a high density. Therefore, in<br>
consideration of that fact that a non-dense state<br>
(pattern in which "0" is continuously and frequently<br>
10 generated) is generated at a portion at which a pattern<br>
of "1001001" has been excluded from among 12 channel<br>
bit patterns after ETM-modulated and the number of<br>
generated "l"s is set in an odd number, with respect to<br>
a reference code pattern, a repetition of<br>
15 "100100100000" is obtained as an optical condition, as<br>
shown in FIG. 72. In order to ensure that the channel<br>
bit pattern after modulated is produced as the pattern,<br>
although not shown, there is a need for setting to<br>
"A4h" a data word before modulated, when utilizing a<br>
20 modulation table specified in an H format. This data<br>
on "A4h" (hexadecimal notation) corresponds to a data<br>
symbol "164" (decimal notation).<br>
A description will be given below with respect to<br>
how to produce specific data in accordance with the<br>
25 above data conversion rule. First, data symbol "164"<br>
(= "OA4h") is set to main data "DO to D2047" in the<br>
data frame structure described previously. Next, a<br>
data frame 1 to a data frame 15 are pre-scrambled in<br>
advance by an initial preset number "OEh", and a data<br>
frame 16 to a data frame 31 are pre-scrambled in<br>
advance by an initial preset number "OFh". If pre-<br>
5 scrambling is applied in advance, when scrambling is<br>
applied in the data conversion rule described<br>
previously, scrambling is applied in duplicate, and a<br>
data symbol "164" (= "OA4h") appears as it is (when<br>
scrambling is applied in duplicate, an original pattern<br>
10 is returned). When pre-scrambling is applied to all of<br>
the reference codes, each of which is formed of 32<br>
physical sectors, DSV control cannot be made, and thus,<br>
pre-scrambling cannot be applied to only data frame 0<br>
in advance. After the foregoing scrambling has been<br>
15 applied, if modulation is carried out, a pattern shown<br>
in FIG. 72 is recorded on the information storage<br>
medium.<br>
Referring to FIG. 73, a description will be given<br>
with respect to a comparison in data recording format<br>
20 between a variety of information storage mediums in the<br>
present embodiment. FIG. 73 (a) shows a data recording<br>
format in a conventional read-only type information<br>
storage medium DVD-ROM; a conventional write-once type<br>
information storage medium DVD-R; and a conventional<br>
25 DVD-RW; FIG. 73 (b) shows a data recording format in a<br>
read-only type information storage medium in the<br>
present embodiment; FIG. 73 (c) shows a data recording<br>
format of a write-once type information storage medium<br>
in the present embodiment; and FIG. 73 (d) shows a data<br>
recording format of a rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium. For the sake of comparison, ECC blocks<br>
5 411 to 418 are shown as the same size. However, one<br>
ECC block is composed of 16 physical sectors in the<br>
conventional read-only type information storage medium<br>
DVD-ROM shown in FIG. 73 (a); the conventional writeonce<br>
type information storage medium DVD-R; and the<br>
10 conventional rewritable type information storage medium<br>
DVD-RW, whereas, in the present embodiment shown in<br>
FIGS. 73 (b) to 73 (d) , one ECC block is composed of 32<br>
physical sectors. The present embodiment is featured<br>
in that guard areas 442 to 448 having the same length<br>
15 as a sync frame length 433 is provided between ECC<br>
blocks #1 411 to #8 418, as shown in FIGS. 73 (b) to<br>
73 (d). In the conventional read-only type information<br>
storage medium DVD-ROM, ECC blocks #1 411 to #8 418 are<br>
continuously recorded as shown in FIG. 73 (a). If an<br>
20 attempt is made to allocate compatibility in data<br>
recording format with the conventional read-only type<br>
information storage medium DVD-ROM by means of the<br>
conventional write-once type information storage medium<br>
DVD-R or the conventional rewritable type information<br>
25 storage medium DVD-RW, if an additional writing or<br>
rewriting process called restricted overwrite is<br>
carried out, there has been a problem that part of the<br>
ECC block is damaged due to overwriting and the data<br>
reliability at the time of reproduction is<br>
significantly degraded. In contrast, as in the present<br>
embodiment, if guard areas 442 to 448 are arranged<br>
5 between data fields (ECC blocks), there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that an overwrite location is<br>
restricted to the guard areas 442 to 448, and the data<br>
damage in a data field (ECC block) can be prevented.<br>
The present embodiment is secondarily featured in that<br>
10 the lengths of the above guard areas 442 to 448 are<br>
adjusted to conform with a sync frame length 433 which<br>
is one sync frame size, as shown in FIGS. 73 (a) to 73<br>
(d). As shown in FIGS. 62A and 62B, sync codes are<br>
arranged in space in determined sync frame lengths 433<br>
15 having 1116 channel bits, and a sync code position is<br>
sampled by utilizing this predetermined cyclic space in<br>
the sync code position detector unit 145 shown in<br>
FIG. 11. In the present embodiment, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that, even if the guard areas 442<br>
20 to 448 are encompassed at the time of reproduction by<br>
making adjustment to conform with the length sync frame<br>
length 433 of the guard areas 442 to 448, the sync<br>
frame space is kept unchanged, thus facilitating sync<br>
code position detection at the time of reproduction.<br>
25 Further, in the present embodiment, sync data is<br>
arranged in the guard area for the purpose of:<br>
1) improving detection precision of the sync code<br>
position detection while matching a generation<br>
frequency of the sync codes even in a location<br>
encompassing the guard areas 442 to 448; and<br>
2) facilitating judgment of a position in a<br>
5 physical sector including the guard areas 442 to 448.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIG. 75, a postamble<br>
field 481 is formed at the start position of each of<br>
the guard areas 442 to 468, and a sync code "SY1" of<br>
sync code number "1" shown in FIG. 63 is arranged in<br>
10 that postamble area 481. As is evident from FIGS. 62A<br>
and 62B, combinations of sync code numbers of three<br>
continuous sync codes in a physical sector are<br>
different from each other in all locations. Further,<br>
combinations of sync code numbers of three continuous<br>
15 sync codes considering up to sync code numbers "1" in<br>
the guard areas 442 to 448 are also different from each<br>
other in all locations. Therefore, the judgment of a<br>
position in physical sectors including a location of<br>
the guard area as well as positional information in the<br>
20 physical sectors can be made in accordance with sync<br>
code number combinations of three continuous sync codes<br>
in an arbitrary area.<br>
FIG. 75 shows a detailed structure in the guard<br>
areas 441 to 448 shown in FIG. 73. The present<br>
25 embodiment is featured in that, although a structure in<br>
physical sectors is composed of a combination of the<br>
sync code 431 and sync data 432, the guard areas 441 to<br>
448 is composed of a combination of a sync code 433 and<br>
sync data 434 similarly; and, in an area of the sync<br>
data 434 contained in the guard area #3 443, data is<br>
arranged, the data being modulated in accordance with<br>
5 the same modulation rule as the sync data 432 in<br>
sectors. An area in one ECC block #2 412 composed of<br>
32 physical sectors shown in FIG. 59 is referred to as<br>
a data field 470 in the invention.<br>
VFO (Variable Frequency Oscillator) areas 471 and<br>
10 472 in FIG. 75 are utilized for synchronization of a<br>
reference clock of an information reproducing apparatus<br>
or an information recording/reproducing apparatus when<br>
the data field 470 is reproduced. As the contents of<br>
data recorded in the areas 471 and 472, the data before<br>
15 modulated, in a common modulation rule described later,<br>
is obtained as a continuous repetition of "7Eh", and a<br>
channel bit pattern actually described after modulated<br>
is obtained as a repetition of "010001 000100" (pattern<br>
in which three "0" settings are repeated). In order to<br>
20 obtain this pattern, it is necessary to set the start<br>
bytes of the VFO areas 471 and 472 to State 2.<br>
The pre-sync areas 477 and 478 indicates a<br>
boundary position between the VFO areas 471 and 472 and<br>
the data area 470, and a recording channel bit pattern<br>
25 after modulated is a repetition of "100000 100000"<br>
(pattern in which continuous five "0" settings are<br>
repeated). The information reproducing apparatus or<br>
the information recording reproducing apparatus detects<br>
a pattern change position of a repetition pattern of<br>
"100000 100000" in pre-sync areas 477 and 478 and<br>
recognizes that the data area 470 approaches, from a<br>
5 repetition pattern of "010001 000100" contained in the<br>
VFO areas 471 and 472.<br>
A postamble area 481 indicates an end position of<br>
the data area 470 and designates a start position of<br>
the guard area 443. A pattern in the postamble area<br>
10 481 coincides with a pattern of "SY1" in a SYNC code<br>
shown in FIG. 63, as described above.<br>
An extra area 482 is an area used for copy control<br>
or illegal copy protection. In particular, in the case<br>
where this area is not used for copy control or illegal<br>
15 copy protection, all "Os" are set by channel bits.<br>
In a buffer area, data before modulated, which is<br>
identical to that in the VFO areas 471 and 472, is<br>
obtained as a continuous repetition of "7Eh", and the<br>
actually recorded channel bit pattern after modulated<br>
20 is obtained as a repetition pattern of "010001 000100"<br>
(pattern in which continuous three 0 settings are<br>
repeated). In order to obtain this pattern, it is<br>
necessary to set the start bytes of the VFO areas 471<br>
and 472 to State 2.<br>
25 As shown in FIG. 75, a postamble area 481 in which<br>
a pattern of "SYl" is recorded corresponds to the sync<br>
code area 433; and an area from the immediately<br>
succeeding extra area 482 to a pre-sync area 478<br>
corresponds to the sync data area 434. An area from<br>
the VFO area 471 to the buffer area 475 (namely, area<br>
including the data area 470 and part of the preceding<br>
5 and succeeding guard areas) is referred to as a data<br>
segment 490 in the invention. This area indicates the<br>
conditions different from those of a "physical segment"<br>
described later. The data size of each item of data<br>
shown in FIG. 75 is expressed by byte number of data<br>
10 before modulated.<br>
In the present embodiment, without being limited<br>
to a structure shown in FIG. 75, the following method<br>
can be employed as another embodiment. That is, the<br>
pre-sync area 477 is arranged midway of the VOF areas<br>
15 471 and 472 shown in FIG. 75 instead of allocating the<br>
pre-sync area 477 at the boundary section between the<br>
VOF area 471 and the data area 470. In such another<br>
embodiment, a distance correlation is taken by spacing<br>
a distance between a sync code "SYO" and the pre-sync<br>
20 area 477 arranged at the start position of the data<br>
block 470; the pre-sync area 477 is set as pseudo-Sync;<br>
and the pre-sync area 477 is set as distance<br>
correlation information on a real Sync position<br>
(although it is different from a distance relevant to<br>
25 another Sync position). If a real Sync position cannot<br>
be detected, Sync is inserted into a position at which<br>
the real position generated from a pseudo Sync position<br>
would be detected. Another embodiment is featured in<br>
that the pre-sync area 477 is thus spaced slightly from<br>
real Sync ("SYO"). When the pre-sync area 477 is<br>
arranged at the beginning of the VFO areas 471 and 472,<br>
5 the role of the pre-sync becomes weaken because PLL of<br>
a read clock is not locked. Therefore, it is desirable<br>
that the pre-sync area 477 be arranged at the<br>
intermediate position of the VFO areas 471 and 472.<br>
In the invention, address information in a<br>
10 recording type (rewritable-type or write-once)<br>
information storage medium is recorded in advance by<br>
using wobble modulation. The present embodiment is<br>
featured in that phase modulation of ±90 degrees<br>
(180 degrees) is used as a wobble modulation system,<br>
15 and NRZ (Non Return to Zero) method is employed,<br>
recording address information in advance with respect<br>
to an information storage medium. A specific<br>
description will be given with reference to FIG. 76.<br>
In the present embodiment, with respect to address<br>
20 information, the 1-address bit (referred to as an<br>
address symbol) area 511 is expressed by a four-wobble<br>
cycle, and a frequency and an amplitude/a phase are<br>
matched everywhere in the 1-address bit area 511. In<br>
the case where the same values of address bits are<br>
25 continued, the same phase continuously lasts at the<br>
boundary section of the 1-address bit areas 511 (at a<br>
portion indicated by "triangular mark" shown in<br>
FIG. 76). In the case where an address bit is<br>
inverted, wobble pattern inversion (180-degree shift of<br>
phase) occurs. In the wobble signal detector unit 135<br>
of the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
5 shown in FIG. 11, a boundary position of the above<br>
address bit area 511 (location indicated by "triangular<br>
mark" shown in FIG. 76) and a slot position 412 which<br>
is a boundary position of a 1-wobble cycle are detected<br>
at the same time. Although not shown in the wobble<br>
10 signal detector unit 135, a PLL (Phase Lock Loop)<br>
circuit is incorporated, and PLL is applied in<br>
synchronism with both of the boundary position of the<br>
above address bit area 511 and the slot position 412.<br>
If the boundary position of this address bit area 511<br>
15 or the slot position 412 is shifted, the wobble signal<br>
detector unit 135 is out of synchronization, disabling<br>
precise wobble signal reproduction (reading). A gap<br>
between the adjacent slot positions 412 is referred to<br>
as a slot gap 513. As this slot gap 513 is physically<br>
20 closer, synchronization with a PLL circuit can be<br>
easily obtained, enabling stable wobble signal<br>
reproduction (reading of contained information). As is<br>
evident from FIG. 76, this slot gap 513 coincides with<br>
a 1-wobble cycle. As a wobble modulating method,<br>
25 although an AM (Amplitude Modulation) system for<br>
changing a wobble amplitude is easily affected by dust<br>
or scratch adhering to the information storage medium<br>
surface, the above phase modulation is hardly<br>
comparatively affected by dust or scratch adhering to<br>
the information storage medium surface because a change<br>
of a phase is detected instead of a signal amplitude in<br>
5 the above phase modulation. As another modulation<br>
system, in an FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) system for<br>
changing a frequency, a slot gap 513 is long with<br>
respect to a wobble cycle, and synchronization of a PLL<br>
circuit is relatively hardly obtained. Therefore, as<br>
10 in the present embodiment, when address information is<br>
recorded by wobble phase modulation, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that a slot gap is narrow, and<br>
wobble signal synchronization is easily obtained.<br>
As shown in FIG. 76, although binary data "1" or<br>
15 "0" is assigned to the 1-address bit area 511, a method<br>
for allocating bits in the present embodiment is shown<br>
in FIG. 77. As shown on the left side of FIG. 77, a<br>
wobble pattern, which first wobbles from the start<br>
position of one wobble to the outer periphery side, is<br>
20 referred to as an NPW (Normal Phase Wobble), and data<br>
"0" is arranged. As shown at the right side, a wobble<br>
pattern which first wobbles from the start position of<br>
one wobble to the inner periphery side is referred to<br>
as an IPW (Invert Phase Wobble), and data "1" is<br>
25 arranged.<br>
A description will be given with respect to an<br>
address information recording format using wobble<br>
modulation in an H format of a write-once type<br>
information storage medium according to the invention.<br>
An address information setting method using wobble<br>
modulation in the present embodiment is featured in<br>
5 that "allocation is carried out in units of the sync<br>
frame length 433" shown in FIG. 73. As shown in<br>
FIGS. 62A and 62B, one sector is composed of 26 sync<br>
frames, and, as is evident from FIG. 56, one ECC block<br>
is formed of 32 physical sectors. Thus, one ECC block<br>
10 is composed of 32 physical sectors and is composed of<br>
832 (= 26 x 327) sync frames. As shown in FIG. 73, a<br>
length of the guard areas 442 to 468 which exist<br>
between the ECC blocks 411 to 418 coincides with one<br>
sync frame length 433, and thus, a length obtained by<br>
15 adding one guard area 462 and one ECC block 411 to each<br>
other is composed of 832 + 1 = 833 sync frames. Prime<br>
factorization can be carried out into 833 = 7 x 17 x 7,<br>
and thus, a structural allocation utilizing this<br>
feature is provided. That is, a basic unit of data<br>
20 capable of writing an area equal to a length of an area<br>
obtained by adding one guard area and one ECC block to<br>
each other is defined as a data segment 531 (A<br>
structure in the data segment 490 shown in FIG. 75<br>
coincides with one another regardless of the read-only<br>
25 type information storage medium, the rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium, or the write-once type<br>
information storage medium); an area having the same<br>
length as a physical length of one data segment 490 is<br>
divided into "seven" physical segments, and address<br>
information is recorded in advance in the form of<br>
wobble modulation on a physical segment by segment<br>
5 basis. A boundary position relevant to the data<br>
segment 490 and a boundary position relevant to a<br>
physical segment do not coincide with each other, and<br>
are shifted by an amount described later. Further,<br>
wobble data is divided into 17 WDU (Wobble Data Units),<br>
10 respectively, on a physical segment by segment basis.<br>
From the above formula, it is evident that seven sync<br>
frames are arranged to a length of one wobble data<br>
unit, respectively. Thus, a physical segment is<br>
composed of 17 wobble data units, and seven physical<br>
15 segment lengths are adjusted to conform with a data<br>
segment length, thereby making it easy to allocate a<br>
sync frame boundary and detect a sync code in a range<br>
encompassing guard areas 442 to 468.<br>
Each of the wobble data units #0 560 to #11 571 is<br>
20 composed of: a modulation area 598 for 16 wobbles; and<br>
non-modulation areas 592 and 593 for 68 wobbles, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 78A to 78D. The present embodiment is<br>
featured in that an occupying ratio of the nonmodulation<br>
areas 592 and 593 with respect to a<br>
25 modulation area is significantly large. In the<br>
non-modulation areas 592 and 593, a group area or a<br>
land area always wobbles at a predetermined frequency,<br>
and thus, a PLL (Phase Locked Loop) is applied by<br>
u L i l i z i n y LliH nun=iuodulation areas 592 and 593, making<br>
it possible to stably sample (generate) a reference<br>
clock when reproducing a recording mark recorded in the<br>
5 information storage medium or a recording reference<br>
clock used at the time of new recording. Thus, in the<br>
present embodiment, an occupying ratio of the nonmodulation<br>
areas 592 and 593 with respect to a<br>
modulation area 598 is significantly increased, thereby<br>
10 making it possible to remarkably improve the precision<br>
of sampling (generating) a recording reference clock<br>
and remarkably improving the stability of the sampling<br>
(generation). That is, in the case where phase<br>
modulation in wobbles has been carried out, if a<br>
15 reproduction signal is passed through a band path<br>
filter for the purpose of waveform shaping, there<br>
appears a phenomenon that a detection signal waveform<br>
amplitude after shaped is reduced before and after a<br>
phase change position. Therefore, there is a problem<br>
20 that, when the frequency of a phase change point due to<br>
phase modulation increases, a waveform amplitude change<br>
increases, and the above clock sampling precision<br>
drops; and, conversely, if the frequency of a phase<br>
change point in a modulation area is low, a bit shift<br>
25 at the time of wobble address information detection is<br>
likely to occur. Thus, in the present embodiment,<br>
there is attained advantageous effect that a modulation<br>
area and a non-modulation area due to phase modulation<br>
configured, and an occupying ratio of the nonmodulation<br>
area is increased, thereby improving the<br>
above clock sampling precision. In the present<br>
5 embodiment, a position of switching the modulation area<br>
and the non-modulation area can be predicted in<br>
advance. Thus, a reproduction signal is gated to<br>
obtain a signal from the non-modulation area, making it<br>
possible to carry out the above clock sampling from<br>
10 that detection signal. In addition, in the case where<br>
the recording layer 3-2 is composed of an organic dye<br>
recording material using a principle of recording<br>
according to the present embodiment, a wobble signal is<br>
comparatively hardly taken in the case of using the<br>
15 pre-groove shape/dimensions described in "3-2-D] Basic<br>
characteristics relevant to pre-groove shape/dimensions<br>
in the present embodiment" in "3-2) Description of<br>
basic characteristics common to organic dye film in the<br>
present embodiment". In consideration of this<br>
20 situation, the reliability of wobble signal detection<br>
is improved by significantly increasing an occupying<br>
ratio of the non-modulation areas 590 and 591 with<br>
respect to a modulation area, as described above. At<br>
the boundary between the non-modulation areas 592 and<br>
25 593 and the modulation area 598, an IPW area is set as<br>
a modulation start mark of the modulation area 598 by<br>
using four wobbles or six wobbles. At a wobble data<br>
section shown in FIGS. 78C and 78D, allocation is<br>
carried out so that wobble address areas (address bits<br>
#2 to #0) wobble-modulated immediately after detecting<br>
the IPW area which is this modulation start mark.<br>
5 FIGS. 78A and 78B each show the contents in a wobble<br>
data unit #0 560 which corresponds to a wobble sync<br>
area 580 shown in FIG. 79 (c) described later; and<br>
FIGS. 78C and 78D each show the contents in a wobble<br>
data unit which corresponds to a wobble data section<br>
10 from segment information 727 to a CRC code 726 shown in<br>
FIG. 79 (c). FIGS. 78A and 78C each show a wobble data<br>
unit which corresponds to a primary position 701 in a<br>
modulation area described later; and FIGS. 78B and 78D<br>
each show a wobble data unit which corresponds to a<br>
15 secondary position 702 in a modulation area. As shown<br>
in FIGS. 78A and 78B, in a wobble sync area 580, six<br>
wobbles are allocated to the IPW area, and four wobbles<br>
are allocated to an NPW area surrounded by the IPW<br>
area. As shown in FIGS. 78C and 78D, four wobbles are<br>
20 allocated to a respective one of the IPW area and all<br>
of the address bit areas #2 to #0 in the wobble data<br>
section.<br>
FIG. 79 shows an embodiment relating to a data<br>
structure in wobble address information in a write-once<br>
25 type information storage medium. For the sake of<br>
comparison, FIG. 79 (a) shows a data structure in<br>
wobble address information of a rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium. FIGS. 79 (a) and 79 (c)<br>
show two embodiments relating to a data structure in<br>
wobble address information in the write-once type<br>
information storage medium.<br>
5 In a wobble address area 610, three address bits<br>
are set by 12 wobbles (referring to FIG. 76). Namely,<br>
one address bit is composed of four continuous wobbles.<br>
Thus, the present embodiment employs a structure in<br>
which address information is arranged to be distributed<br>
10 on three by three address bit basis. When the wobble<br>
address information 610 is intensively recorded at one<br>
site in an information storage medium, it becomes<br>
difficult to detect all information when dust or<br>
scratch adheres to the medium surface. As in the<br>
15 present embodiment, there is attained advantageous<br>
effect that: wobble address information 610 is arranged<br>
to be distributed on a three by three address bit<br>
(12 wobbles) basis included in one of the wobble data<br>
units 560 to 576; and a set of information is recorded<br>
20 on an integer multiple by multiple address bit basis of<br>
three address bits, enabling information detection of<br>
another item of information even in the case where it<br>
is difficult to detect information in one site due to<br>
dust or scratch.<br>
25 As described above, the wobble address information<br>
610 is arranged to be distributed, and the wobble<br>
address information 610 is completely arranged on a one<br>
by one physical segment basis, thereby making it<br>
possible to identify address information on a physical<br>
segment by segment basis, and thus, identify a current<br>
position in physical segment units every time an<br>
5 information recording/reproducing apparatus provides an<br>
access.<br>
In the present embodiment, an NRZ technique is<br>
employed as shown in FIG. 76, and thus, a phase does<br>
not change in four continuous wobbles in the wobble<br>
10 address area 610. A wobble sync area 580 is set by<br>
utilizing this characteristic. That is, a wobble<br>
pattern which is hardly generated in the wobble address<br>
information 610 is set with respect to the wobble sync<br>
area 580, thereby facilitating allocation position<br>
15 identification of the wobble sync area 580. The<br>
present embodiment is featured in that, with respect to<br>
wobble address areas 586 and 587 in which one address<br>
bit is composed of four continuous wobbles, one address<br>
bit length is set at a length other than four wobbles<br>
20 at a position of the wobble sync area 580. That is, in<br>
the wobble sync area 580, as shown in FIGS. 78A and<br>
78B, an area (IPW area) in which a wobble bit is set to<br>
"1" is set as a wobble pattern change which does not<br>
occur in the wobble data section as shown in FIGS. 78C<br>
25 and 78D such as "six wobble —» four wobbles —»<br>
six wobbles". When a method for changing a wobble<br>
cycle as described above is utilized as a specific<br>
method for setting a wobble pattern which can be hardly<br>
generated in the wobble data section with respect to<br>
the wobble sync area 580, the following advantageous<br>
effects can be attained:<br>
5 1) Wobble detection (wobble signal judgment) can<br>
be stably continued without distorting PLL relating to<br>
the slot position 512 (FIG. 76) of a wobble which is<br>
carried out in the wobble signal detector unit 135<br>
shown in FIG. 11; and<br>
10 2) A wobble sync area 580 and modulation start<br>
marks 561 and 562 can be easily detected due to a shift<br>
of an address bit boundary position generated in the<br>
wobble signal detector unit 135 shown in FIG. 11.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 78A to 78D, the present<br>
15 embodiment is featured in that the wobble sync area 580<br>
is formed in 12 wobble cycles, and a length of the<br>
wobble sync area 580 is made coincident with three<br>
address bit lengths. In this manner, all the<br>
modulation areas (for 16 wobbles) in one wobble data<br>
20 unit #0 560 are arranged to the wobble sync area 580,<br>
thereby improving detection easiness of the start<br>
position of wobble address information 610 (allocation<br>
position of wobble sync area 580). This wobble sync<br>
area 580 is arranged in the first wobble data unit in a<br>
25 physical segment. Thus, there is attained advantageous<br>
effect that the wobble sync area 580 is arranged to the<br>
start position in a physical segment, whereby a<br>
boundary position of the physical segment can be easily<br>
sampled merely by detecting a position of the wobble<br>
sync area 580.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 78C and 78D, in wobble data<br>
5 units #1 561 to #11 571, the IPW area (refer to<br>
FIG. 77) is arranged as a modulation start mark at the<br>
start position, the area preceding address bits #2 to<br>
#0. The waveform of NPW is continuously formed in the<br>
non-modulation areas 592 and 593 arranged at the<br>
10 preceding position. Thus, the wobble signal detector<br>
unit 135 shown in FIG. 11 detects a turning point from<br>
NPW to IPW is detected, and samples the position of the<br>
modulation start mark.<br>
As a reference, the contents of wobble address<br>
15 information 610 contained in a rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium shown in FIG. 79 (a) are as<br>
follows:<br>
1) Physical segment address 601<br>
- Information indicating a physical segment number<br>
20 in a track (within one cycle in an information storage<br>
medium 221);<br>
2) Zone address 602<br>
- This address indicates a zone number in the<br>
information storage medium 221; and<br>
25 3) Parity information 605<br>
- This information is set for error detection at<br>
the time of reproduction from the wobble address<br>
information 610; 14 address bits from reserved<br>
information 604 to the zone address 602 are<br>
individually added in units of address bits; and a<br>
display as to whether or not a result of the addition<br>
5 is an even number or an odd number is made. A value of<br>
the parity information 605 is set so that a result<br>
obtained by taking exclusive OR in units of address<br>
bits becomes "1" with respect to a total of 15 address<br>
bits including one address bit of this address parity<br>
10 information 605.<br>
4) Unity area 608<br>
- As described previously, each wobble data unit<br>
is set so as to be composed of a modulation area 598<br>
for 16 wobbles and non-modulation areas 592 and 593 for<br>
15 68 wobbles, and an occupying ratio of the nonmodulation<br>
areas 592 and 593 with respect to the<br>
modulation area 598 is significantly increased.<br>
Further, the precision and stability of sampling<br>
(generation) of a reproducing reference clock or a<br>
20 recording reference clock is improved more remarkably<br>
by increasing the occupying ratio of the non-modulation<br>
areas 592 and 593. The NPW area is fully continuous in<br>
a unity area 608, and is obtained as a non-modulation<br>
area having its uniform phase.<br>
25 FIG. 79 (a) shows the number of address bits<br>
arranged to each item of the above described<br>
information. As described above, the wobble address<br>
information 610 is divided on a three by three address<br>
bits, and the divided items of the information are<br>
arranged to be distributed in each wobble data unit.<br>
Even if a burst error occurs due to the dust or scratch<br>
5 adhering to a surface of an information storage medium,<br>
there is a very low probability that such an error<br>
propagates across the wobble data units which are<br>
different from each other. Therefore, a contrivance is<br>
made so as to reduce to the minimum the count<br>
10 encompassing the different wobble data units as<br>
locations in which the same information is recorded and<br>
to match the turning point of each items of information<br>
with a boundary position of a wobble data unit. In<br>
this manner, even if a burst error occurs due to the<br>
15 dust or scratch adhering to a surface of an information<br>
storage medium, and then, specific information cannot<br>
be read, the reliability of reproducing of wobble<br>
address information is improved by enabling reading of<br>
another item of information recorded in another one of<br>
20 the wobble data units.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 79 (a) to 79 (d), the present<br>
embodiment is featured in that the unity areas 608 and<br>
609 are arranged at the end in the wobble address<br>
information 610. As described above, in the unity<br>
25 areas 608 and 609, a wobble waveform is formed in the<br>
shape of NPW, and thus, the NPW continuously lasts in<br>
substantially three continuous wobble data units.<br>
There is attained advantageous effect that the wobble<br>
signal detector unit 135 shown in FIG. 11 makes a<br>
search for a location in which NPW continuously lasts<br>
in a length for three wobble data units 576 by<br>
5 utilizing this feature, thereby making it possible to<br>
easily sample a position of the unity area 608 arranged<br>
at the end of the wobble address information 610, and<br>
to detect the start position of the wobble address<br>
information 610 by utilizing the positional<br>
10 information.<br>
From among a variety of address information shown<br>
in FIG. 79 (a), a physical segment address 601 and a<br>
zone address 602 indicate the same values between the<br>
adjacent tracks, whereas a value changes between the<br>
15 adjacent tracks in a groove track address 606 and a<br>
land track address 607. Therefore, an indefinite bit<br>
area 504 appears in an area in which the groove track<br>
address 606 and the land track address 607 are<br>
recorded. In order to reduce a frequency of this<br>
20 indefinite bit, in the present embodiment, an address<br>
(number) is displayed by using a gray code with respect<br>
to the groove track address 606 and the land track<br>
address 607. The gray code denotes a code in the case<br>
where a code after converted when an original value<br>
25 changes by "1" only changes by "one bit" anywhere. In<br>
this manner, the indefinite bit frequency is reduced,<br>
making it possible to detect and stabilize a<br>
reproduction signal from a recording mark as well as a<br>
wobble detecting signal.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 79 (b) and 79 (c), in a writeonce<br>
type information storage medium as well, as in the<br>
5 rewritable-type information storage medium, a wobble<br>
sync area 580 is arranged at the start position of a<br>
physical segment, thereby making it easy to detect the<br>
start position of the physical segment or a boundary<br>
position between the adjacent segments. Type<br>
10 identification information 721 on the physical segment<br>
shown in FIG. 79B indicates an allocation position in<br>
the physical segment as in the wobble sync pattern<br>
contained in the above described wobble sync area 580,<br>
thereby making it possible to predict in advance an<br>
15 allocation location of another modulation area 598 in<br>
the same physical segment and to prepare for next<br>
modulation area detection. Thus, there is attained<br>
advantageous effect that the precision of signal<br>
detection (judgment) in a modulation area can be<br>
20 improved. Specifically,<br>
When type identification information 721 on a<br>
physical segment is set to "0", it denotes that all the<br>
items of information in the physical segment shown in<br>
FIG. 81 (b) are arranged at a primary position or that<br>
25 a primary position and a secondary position shown in<br>
FIG. 81 (d) are mixed; and<br>
When type identification information 721 of a<br>
physical segment is set to "1", all items of<br>
information in a physical segment are arranged at a<br>
secondary position, as shown in FIG. 81 (c).<br>
According to another embodiment relevant to the<br>
5 above described embodiment, it is possible to indicate<br>
an allocation location of a modulation area in a<br>
physical segment by using a combination between a<br>
wobble sync pattern and type identification information<br>
721 on a physical segment. By using the combination of<br>
10 the two types of information described previously,<br>
three or more types of allocation patterns of<br>
modulation areas shown in FIGS. 81 (b) to 81 (d) can be<br>
expressed, making it possible to provide a plurality of<br>
allocation patterns of the modulation areas. While the<br>
15 above described embodiment shows an allocation location<br>
of a modulation area in a physical segment which<br>
includes a wobble sync area 580 and type identification<br>
information 721 on a physical segment, the invention is<br>
not limited thereto. For example, as another<br>
20 embodiment, the wobble sync area 580 and the type<br>
identification information 721 on the physical segment<br>
may indicate an allocation location of a modulation<br>
area in a next physical segment. By doing this, in the<br>
case where tracking is carried out continuously along a<br>
25 groove area, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
the allocation location of the modulation area in the<br>
next physical segment can be identified in advance, and<br>
a long preparation time for detecting a modulation area<br>
can be taken.<br>
Layer number information 722 in a write-once type<br>
information storage medium shown in FIG. 79 (b)<br>
5 indicates either of the recording layers from among a<br>
single-sided single-layer or a single-sided doublelayer.<br>
This information denotes:<br>
- "LO later" in the case of a single-sided singlelayer<br>
medium or a single-sided double-layer medium when<br>
10 "0" is set (a front layer at the laser light beam<br>
incident side); and<br>
- "LI layer" of a single-sided double-layer when<br>
"1" is set (a rear layer in viewed from the laser light<br>
beam incident side).<br>
15 Physical segment sequence information 724<br>
indicates an allocation sequence of relative physical<br>
segments in the same physical segment block. As is<br>
evident as compared with FIG. 79 (a), the start<br>
position of the physical segment sequence information<br>
20 724 contained in wobble address information 610<br>
coincides with that of a physical segment address 601<br>
contained in a rewritable-type information storage<br>
medium. The physical segment sequence information<br>
position is adjusted to conform with the<br>
25 rewritable-type medium, thereby making it possible to<br>
improve compatibility between medium types and to share<br>
or simplify an address detection control program using<br>
a wobble signal in an information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus in which both of a rewritable-type<br>
information storage medium and a write-once type<br>
information storage medium can be used.<br>
5 A data segment address 725 shown in FIG. 79 (b)<br>
describes address information on a data segment in<br>
numbers. As has already been described, in the present<br>
embodiment, one ECC block is composed of 32 sectors.<br>
Therefore, the least significant five bits of a<br>
10 physical sector number of a sector arranged at the<br>
beginning in a specific ECC block coincides with that<br>
of a sector arranged at the start position in the<br>
adjacent ECC block. In the case where a physical<br>
sector number has beet set so that the least<br>
15 significant five bits of the physical sector number of<br>
a sector arranged in an ECC block are "00000", the<br>
values of the least significant six bits or more of the<br>
physical sector numbers of all the sectors which exist<br>
in the same ECC block coincide with each other.<br>
20 Therefore, the least significant five bit data of the<br>
physical sector number of the sectors which exist in<br>
the same ECC block is eliminated, and address<br>
information obtained by sampling only the least<br>
significant six bits or more is defined as an ECC block<br>
25 address (or ECC block address number). A data segment<br>
address 725 (or physical segment block number<br>
information) recorded in advance by wobble modulation<br>
coincides with the above ECC block address. Thus, when<br>
positional information on a physical segment block due<br>
to wobble modulation is indicated by a data segment<br>
address, there is advantageous effect that a data<br>
5 amount decreases on five by five bit basis as compared<br>
with when the address is displayed by a physical sector<br>
number, simplifying current position detection at the<br>
time of an access.<br>
A CRC code 726 shown in FIGS. 79 (b) and 79 (c) is<br>
10 a CRC code (error correction code) arranged to 24<br>
address bits from physical segment type identification<br>
information 721 to the data segment address 725 or a<br>
CRC code arranged to 24 address bits from segment<br>
information 727 to the physical segment sequence<br>
15 information 724. Even if a wobble modulation signal is<br>
partially mistakenly read, this signal can be partially<br>
corrected by this CRC code 726.<br>
In a write-once type information storage medium,<br>
an area corresponding to 15 address bits is arranged to<br>
20 the unity area 609, and an NPW area is fully arranged<br>
in five wobble data units 12 to 16 (the modulation area<br>
598 does not exist).<br>
A physical segment block address 728 shown in<br>
FIG. 79 (c) is an address set for each physical segment<br>
25 block which configure one unit from seven physical<br>
segments, and a physical segment block address relevant<br>
to the first segment block in the data lead-in area<br>
DTRDI is set to "1358h". The values of the physical<br>
segment block addresses are sequentially added one by<br>
one from the first physical segment block contained in<br>
the data lead-in area DTLDI to the last physical<br>
5 segment block contained in the data lead-out area<br>
DTLDO, including the data area DTA.<br>
The physical segment sequence information 724<br>
denotes the sequence of each of the physical segments<br>
in one physical segment block, and "0" is set to the<br>
10 first physical segment, and "6" is set to the last<br>
physical segment.<br>
The embodiment shown in FIG. 79 (c) is featured in<br>
that the physical segment block address 728 is arranged<br>
at a position which precedes the physical segment<br>
15 sequence information 724. For example, as in the RMD<br>
field 728 shown in FIG. 53, address information is<br>
often managed by this physical segment block address.<br>
In the case where an access is provided to a<br>
predetermined segment block address in accordance with<br>
20 these items of management information, first, the<br>
wobble signal detector unit 135 shown in FIG. 11<br>
detects a location of the wobble sync area 580 shown in<br>
FIG. 79 (c), and then, sequentially decodes items of<br>
information recorded immediately after the wobble sync<br>
25 area 580. In the case where a physical segment block<br>
address exists at a position which precedes the<br>
physical segment sequence information 724, first, the<br>
physical segment block address is decoded, and it is<br>
possible to judge whether or not a predetermined<br>
physical segment block address exists without decoding<br>
the physical segment sequence information 724. Thus,<br>
5 there is advantageous effect that access capability<br>
using a wobble address is improved.<br>
The segment information 727 is composed of type<br>
identification information 721 and a reserved area 723.<br>
The type identification information 721 denotes an<br>
10 allocation location of a modulation area in a physical<br>
segment. In the case where the value of this type<br>
identification information 721 is set to "Ob", it<br>
denotes a state shown in FIG. 81 (b) described layer.<br>
In the case where the information is set to "Ib", it<br>
15 denotes a state shown in FIG. 81 (c) or FIG. 81 (d)<br>
described later.<br>
The present embodiment is featured in that type<br>
information identification 721 is arranged immediately<br>
after the wobble sync area 580 in FIG. 79 (c). As<br>
20 described above, first, the wobble signal detector unit<br>
135 shown in FIG. 11 detects a location of the wobble<br>
sync area 580 shown in FIG. 79 (c), and then,<br>
sequentially decodes the items of information recorded<br>
immediately after the wobble sync area 580. Therefore,<br>
25 the type identification information 721 is arranged<br>
immediately after the wobble sync area 580, thereby<br>
enabling an allocation location check of a modulation<br>
area in a physical segment immediately. Thus, high<br>
speed access processing using a wobble address can be<br>
achieved.<br>
In the write-once type information storage medium<br>
5 according to the present embodiment, a recording mark<br>
is formed on a groove area, and a CLV recording system<br>
is employed. In this case, as described previously, a<br>
wobble slot position is shifted between the adjacent<br>
tracks, and thus, interference between the adjacent<br>
10 wobbles is likely to occur with a wobble reproduction<br>
signal. In order to eliminate this effect, in the<br>
present embodiment, a contrivance is made to shift a<br>
modulation area so that modulation areas do not overlap<br>
each other between the adjacent tracks.<br>
15 Specifically, as shown in FIG. 80, a primary<br>
position 701 and a secondary position 702 can be set in<br>
an allocation location of a modulation area.<br>
Basically, assuming that after allocation has been<br>
fully carried out in the primary position, there occurs<br>
20 a location in which modulation areas partially overlap<br>
between the adjacent tracks, there is employed a method<br>
for partially shift the modulation area to the<br>
secondary position. For example, in FIG. 80, when a<br>
modulation area of a groove area 505 is set at the<br>
25 primary position, a modulation area of the adjacent<br>
groove area 502 and a modulation area of a groove area<br>
506 partially overlap on each other. Thus, the<br>
modulation area of the groove area 505 is shifted to<br>
the secondary position. In this manner, there is<br>
attained advantageous effect that a wobble address can<br>
be stably reproduced by preventing the interference<br>
5 between the modulation areas of the adjacent tracks in<br>
a reproduction signal from a wobble address.<br>
The specific primary position and secondary<br>
position relating to a modulation area is set by<br>
switching an allocation location in the same wobble<br>
10 data unit. In the present embodiment, an occupying<br>
ratio of a non-modulation area is set to be higher than<br>
a modulation area so that, the primary position and the<br>
secondary position can be switched merely by making a<br>
mere allocation change in the same wobble data unit.<br>
15 Specifically, in the primary position 701, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 78 (a) and 78 (c), the modulation area 598 is<br>
arranged at the start position in one wobble data unit.<br>
In the secondary position 702, as shown in FIGS. 78 (b)<br>
and 78 (d), the modulation area 598 is arranged at the<br>
20 latter half position in one of the wobble data unit 560<br>
to 571.<br>
A coverage of the primary position 701 and the<br>
secondary position 702 shown in FIGS. 78 (a) to 78 (d),<br>
i.e., a range in which the primary position or the<br>
25 secondary position continuously lasts is defined in the<br>
rage of physical segments in the present embodiment.<br>
That is, as shown in FIGS. 81 (b) to 81 (d) , after<br>
three types (plural types) of allocation patterns of<br>
modulation areas in the same physical segment have been<br>
provided, when the wobble signal detector unit 135<br>
shown in FIG. 11 identifies an allocation pattern of a<br>
5 modulation area in a physical segment from the<br>
information contained in the type identification<br>
information 721 on a physical segment, the allocation<br>
location of another modulation area 598 in the same<br>
physical segment can be predicted in advance. As a<br>
10 result, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
preparation for detecting a next modulation area can be<br>
made, thus making it possible to improve the precision<br>
of signal detection (judgment).<br>
FIG. 81 (b) shows allocation of wobble data units<br>
15 in a physical segment, wherein the number described in<br>
each frame indicate wobble data unit numbers in the<br>
same physical segment. A 0-th wobble data unit are<br>
referred to as a sync field 711 as indicated at a first<br>
stage. A wobble sync area exists in a modulation area<br>
20 in this sync field. First to eleventh wobble data<br>
units are referred to as an address field 712. Address<br>
information is recorded in a modulation area contained<br>
in this address field 712. Further, in twelfth to<br>
sixteenth wobble data units, all of the wobble patterns<br>
25 are formed in an NPW unity field 713.<br>
A mark "P" described in FIGS. 81 (b), 81 (c) and<br>
81 (d) indicates that a modulation area is set at a<br>
primary position in a wobble data unit; and a mark "S"<br>
indicates that a modulation area is set at a secondary<br>
position in a wobble data unit. A mark "U" indicates<br>
that a wobble data unit is included in a unity field<br>
5 713, and a modulation area does not exist. An<br>
allocation pattern of a modulation area shown in<br>
FIG. 81 (b) indicates that all the areas in a physical<br>
segment are set at the primary position; and an<br>
allocation pattern of a modulation area shown in<br>
10 FIG. 81 (c) indicates all areas in a physical segment<br>
are set at the secondary position. In FIG. 81 (d), the<br>
primary position and the secondary position are mixed<br>
in the same physical segment; a modulation area is set<br>
at the primary position in each of 0-th to fifth wobble<br>
15 data units, and a modulation area is set at the<br>
secondary position in each of sixth to eleventh wobble<br>
data units. As shown in FIG. 81 (d), the primary<br>
positions and the secondary positions are half divided<br>
with respect to an area obtained by adding a sync field<br>
20 711 and an address field 712, thereby making it<br>
possible to finely prevent an overlap of modulation<br>
areas between the adjacent tracks.<br>
Now, a description will be given with respect to a<br>
method for recording the data segment data described<br>
25 previously with respect to the physical segment or the<br>
physical segment block in which address information is<br>
recorded in advance by wobble modulation described<br>
above. Data is recorded in recording cluster units<br>
serving as units of continuously recording data in both<br>
of a rewritable-type information storage medium and a<br>
write-once type information storage medium. FIGS. 82A<br>
5 and 82B show a layout in this recording cluster. In<br>
recording clusters 540 and 542, one or more (integer<br>
numbers) of data segments continuously lasts, and an<br>
expanded guard field 528 or 529 is set at the beginning<br>
or at the end of the segment. The expanded guard<br>
10 fields 528 and 529 are set in the recording clusters<br>
540 and 542 so as to be physically overlapped and<br>
partially overwritten between the adjacent recording<br>
clusters so as not to produce a gap between the<br>
adjacent recording clusters when data is newly<br>
15 additionally written or rewritten in units of the<br>
recording clusters 540 and 542. As the position of<br>
each of the expanded guard fields 528 and 529 set in<br>
the recording clusters 540 and 542, in the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 82A, the expanded guard field 528 is<br>
20 arranged at the end of the recording cluster 540. In<br>
the case where this method is used, the expanded guard<br>
field 528 follows a post amble area 526 shown in<br>
FIG. 83 (a). Thus, in particular, in the write-once<br>
type information storage medium, the post-amble area<br>
25 526 is not mistakenly damaged at the time of rewriting;<br>
protection of the post-amble area 526 at the time of<br>
rewriting can be carried out; and the reliability of<br>
position detection using the post amble area 526 at the<br>
time of data reproduction can be arranged. As another<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIG. 82B, the expanded guard<br>
field 529 can also be arranged at the beginning of the<br>
5 recording cluster 542. In this case, as is evident<br>
from a combination of FIG. 82B and FIGS. 83 (a) to<br>
83 (f), the expanded guard field 529 immediately<br>
precedes a VFO area 522. Thus, at the time of<br>
rewriting or additional writing, the VFO area 522 can<br>
10 be sufficiently taken long, and thus, a PLL lead-in<br>
time relating to a reference clock at the time of<br>
reproduction of a data field 525 can be taken long,<br>
making it possible to improve the reliability of<br>
reproduction of data recorded in the data field 525.<br>
15 In this way, there is attained advantageous effect that<br>
a structure composed of data segments in the case where<br>
one or more recording clusters denote writing units is<br>
provided, thereby making it possible to facilitate a<br>
mixing recording process with respect to the same<br>
20 information storage medium, PC data (PC files) of which<br>
a small amount of data is often rewritten many times<br>
and AV data (AV file) of which a large amount of data<br>
is continuously recorded one time. That is, with<br>
respect to data used for a personal computer, a<br>
25 comparatively small amount of data is often rewritten<br>
many times. Therefore, a recording method suitable for<br>
PC data is obtained by minimally setting data units of<br>
rewriting or additional writing. In the present<br>
embodiment, as shown in FIG. 56, an ECC block is<br>
composed of 32 physical sectors. This, a minimum unit<br>
for efficiently carrying out rewriting or additional<br>
5 writing is obtained by carrying out rewriting or<br>
additional writing in data segment units including only<br>
one ECC block. Therefore, a structure in the present<br>
embodiment in which one or more data segments are<br>
included in a recording cluster which denotes rewriting<br>
10 units or additional writing units is obtained as a<br>
recording structure suitable for PC data (PC files).<br>
In AV (Audio Video) data, it is necessary to<br>
continuously record a very large amount of video image<br>
information and voice information smoothly without any<br>
15 problem. In this case, continuously recorded data is<br>
collectively recorded as one recording cluster. At the<br>
time of AV data recording, when a random shift amount,<br>
a structure in a data segment, or a data segment<br>
attribute and the like is switched on a data segment by<br>
20 segment basis configuring one recording cluster, a<br>
large amount of time is required for such a switching<br>
process, making it difficult to carry out a continuous<br>
recording process. In the present embodiment, as shown<br>
in FIGS. 82A and 82B, it is possible to provide a<br>
25 recording format suitable for AV data recording for<br>
continuously recording a large amount of data by<br>
configuring a recording cluster while data segments in<br>
the same format (without changing an attribute or a<br>
ransom shift amount and without inserting specific<br>
information between data segments) are continuously<br>
arranged. In addition, a simplified structure in a<br>
5 recording cluster is achieved, and simplified recording<br>
control circuit and reproduction detector circuit are<br>
achieved, making it possible to reduce the price of an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus or an<br>
information reproducing apparatus. A data structure in<br>
10 recording cluster 540 in which data segments (excluding<br>
the expanded guard field 528) in the recording cluster<br>
shown in FIGS. 82A and 82B are continuously arranged is<br>
completely identical to those of the read-only<br>
information storage medium shown in FIG. 73 (b) and the<br>
15 write-once type information storage medium shown in<br>
FIG. 73 (c). In this way, a common data structure is<br>
provided among all of the information storage mediums<br>
regardless of the read-only type, the write-once type,<br>
or the rewritable-type, thus allocating medium<br>
20 compatibility. In addition, a detector circuit of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus or the<br>
information reproducing apparatus whose compatibility<br>
has been arranged can be used in common; high<br>
reliability of reproduction can be arranged; and price<br>
25 reduction can be achieved.<br>
By employing the structure shown in FIGS. 82A and<br>
82B, random shift amounts of all the data segments<br>
inevitably coincide with each other in the recording<br>
cluster. In the rewritable-type information medium, a<br>
recording cluster is recorded by random shifting. In<br>
the present embodiment, the random shift amounts of all<br>
5 the data segments coincide with each other in the same<br>
recording cluster 540. Thus, in the case where<br>
reproduction has been carried out across the different<br>
data segments from each other in the same recording<br>
cluster 540, there is no need for synchronization<br>
10 adjustment (phase resetting) in a VFO area (reference<br>
numeral 522 in FIG. 83 (d)), making it possible to<br>
simplify a reproduction detector circuit at the time of<br>
continuous reproduction and to allocate high<br>
reliability of reproduction detection.<br>
15 FIGS. 83 shows a method for recording data to be<br>
rewritably recorded in a rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium. Now, although a description will be<br>
given while focusing on a rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium, it should be noted that an additional<br>
20 writing method relevant to a write-once type<br>
information storage medium is basically identical to<br>
the above recording method. A layout in the recording<br>
cluster in a write-once type information storage medium<br>
according to the present embodiment will be described<br>
25 in way of example employing a layout shown in FIG. 82A.<br>
The present embodiment is not limited thereto, and a<br>
layout shown in FIG. 82B may be employed for a<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium. In the<br>
present embodiment, rewriting relating to rewritable<br>
data is carried out in units of the recording clusters<br>
540 and 541 shown in FIGS. 82B and 83 (e). As<br>
5 described later, one recording cluster is composed of<br>
one or more data segments 529 to 531 and an expanded<br>
guard field 528 arranged at the end. That is, the<br>
start position of one recording cluster 631 coincides<br>
with that of the data segment 531, and the cluster<br>
10 starts from the VFO area 522. In the case where a<br>
plurality of data segments 529 and 530 are continuously<br>
recorded, the plurality of data segments 529 and 530<br>
are continuously arranged in the same recording cluster<br>
531. In addition, the buffer area 547 which exists at<br>
15 the end of the data segment 529 and the VFO area 532<br>
which exists at the beginning of a next data segment<br>
continuously last, and thus, a phase (of a recording<br>
reference clock) at the time of recording) between<br>
these areas coincides with one another. When<br>
20 continuous recording terminates, an expanded guard area<br>
528 is arranged at the end position of the recording<br>
cluster 540. The data size of this expanded guard area<br>
528 is equal to the size for 24 data bytes as data<br>
before modulated.<br>
25 As is evident from a correlation between FIGS. 83<br>
(a) and 83 (c), rewritable-type guard areas 461 and 462<br>
each include: post amble areas 546 and 536; extra areas<br>
544 and 534; buffer areas 547 and 537; VFO areas 532<br>
and 522; and pre-sync areas 533 and 523, and an<br>
expanded guard field 528 is arranged only in location<br>
in which continuous recording terminates. The present<br>
5 embodiment is featured in that rewriting or additional<br>
writing is carried out so that the expanded guard area<br>
528 and the succeeding VFO area 522 partially overlap<br>
each other at a duplicate site 591 at the time of<br>
rewriting. By rewriting or additional writing while<br>
10 partial duplication is maintained, it is possible to<br>
prevent a gap (area in which no recording mark is<br>
formed) from being produced between the recording<br>
clusters 540 and 541. In addition, a stable<br>
reproduction signal can be detected by eliminating<br>
15 inter-layer cross talk in an information storage medium<br>
capable of carrying out recording in a single-sided<br>
double recording layer.<br>
The data size which can be rewritten in one data<br>
segment in the present embodiment is 67 + 4 + 77376 + 2<br>
20 + 4 + 16 = 77469 (data bytes). One wobble data unit<br>
560 is 6 + 4 + 6 + 68 = 84 (wobbles). One physical<br>
segment 550 is composed of 17 wobble data units, and a<br>
length of seven physical segments 550 to 556 coincides<br>
with that of one data segment 531. Thus, 84 x 17 x 7 =<br>
25 9996 (wobbles) are arranged in the length of one data<br>
segment 531. Therefore, from the above formula,<br>
77496/9996 =7.75 (data bytes/wobble) corresponds to<br>
one wobble.<br>
As shown in FIG. 84, an overlap portion of the<br>
succeeding VFO area 522 and the expanded guard field<br>
528 follows 24 wobbles from the start position of a<br>
5 physical segment, and the starting 16 wobbles of a<br>
physical segment 550 are arranged in a wobble sync area<br>
580, and the subsequent 68 wobbles are arranged in a<br>
non-modulation area 590. Therefore, an overlap portion<br>
of the VFO area 522 which follows 24 wobbles and the<br>
10 expanded guard field 528 is included in the nonmodulation<br>
area 590. In this way, the start position<br>
of a data segment follows the 24 wobbles from the start<br>
position of a physical segment, whereby the overlap<br>
portion is included in the non-modulation area 590. In<br>
15 addition, a detection time and a preparation time for<br>
recording process of the wobble sync area 580 can be<br>
sufficiently taken, and thus, a stable and precise<br>
recording process can be guaranteed.<br>
A phase change recording film is used as a<br>
20 recording film of the rewritable-type information<br>
storage medium in the present embodiment. In the phase<br>
change recording film, degradation of the recording<br>
film starts in the vicinity of the rewriting start/end<br>
position. Thus, if recording start/recording end at<br>
25 the same position is repeated, there occurs a<br>
restriction on the number of rewritings due to the<br>
degradation of the recording film. In the present<br>
embodiment, in order to alleviate the above described<br>
problem, at the time of rewriting, J^+i/l2 data bytes<br>
are shifted as shown in FIG. 84, and the recording<br>
start position is shifted at random.<br>
5 Although the start position of the expanded guard<br>
field 528 coincides with that of the VFO area 522 in<br>
order to explain a basic concept in FIGS. 83 (c) and 83<br>
(d), strictly, the start position of the VFO area 522<br>
is shifted at random, as shown in FIG. 84, in the<br>
10 present embodiment.<br>
A phase change recording film is used as a<br>
recording film in a DVD-RAM disk which is a current<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium as well, the<br>
start/end positions of recording is shifted at random<br>
15 for the purpose of improving the rewriting count. The<br>
maximum shift amount range when random shifting has<br>
been carried out in the current DVD-RAM disk is set to<br>
8 data bytes. A channel bit length (as data after<br>
modulated, to be recorded in a disk) in the current<br>
20 DVD-RAM disk is set to 0.143 |^m on average. In the<br>
rewritable-type information storage medium according to<br>
the present embodiment, an average length of channel<br>
bits is obtained as (0.087 + 0.093)/2 = 0.090 (\m) . In<br>
the case where a length of a physical shift range is<br>
25 adjusted to conform with the current DVD-RAM disk, by<br>
using the above value, the required minimal length<br>
serving as a random shift range in the present<br>
embodiment is obtained as:<br>
8 bytes x (0.143 |am/0.090 jam) = 12.7 bytes<br>
In the present embodiment, in order to allocate<br>
easiness of a reproduction signal detecting process,<br>
5 the unit of random shift amount has been adjusted to<br>
conform with "channel bits" after modulated. In the<br>
present embodiment, ETM modulation (Eight to Twelve<br>
modulation) for converting 8 bits to 12 bits is used,<br>
and thus, formula expression which indicates a random<br>
10 shift amount is designated by Jm/12 (data bytes) while<br>
a data byte is defined as a reference. Using the value<br>
of the above formula, a value which can be taken by Jm<br>
is 12.7 x 12 = 152.4, and thus, Jm ranges 0 to 152.<br>
For the above described reason, in the range meeting<br>
15 the above formula, a length of the random shift range<br>
coincides with the current DVD-RAM disk, and the<br>
rewriting count similar to the current DVD-RAM disk can<br>
be guaranteed. In the present embodiment, a margin is<br>
slightly provided with respect to the required minimal<br>
20 length in order to allocate the current or more<br>
rewriting count, and the length of the random shift<br>
range has been set to 14 (data bytes). From these<br>
formulas, 14 x 12 = 168 is established, and thus, a<br>
value which can be taken by Jm has been set in the<br>
25 range of 0 to 167. As described above, the random<br>
shift amount is defined in a range which is wider than<br>
Jm/12 (0 
range relevant to the random shift amount coincides<br>
with that of the current DVD-RAM. Thus, there is<br>
attained advantageous effect that the repetition<br>
recording count similar to that of the current DVD-RAM<br>
5 can be guaranteed.<br>
In FIG. 83 (c), the lengths of the buffer area 547<br>
and the VFO area 532 in the recording cluster 540<br>
become constant. As is evident from FIG. 82 (a) as<br>
well, the random shift amount Jm of all the data<br>
10 segments 529 is obtained as the same value everywhere<br>
in the same recording cluster 540. In the case of<br>
continuously recording one recording cluster 540 which<br>
includes a large amount of data segments, a recording<br>
position is monitored from a wobble. That is, a<br>
15 position of the wobble sync area 580 shown in FIGS. 79<br>
(a) to 79 (c) is detected, and, in the non-modulation<br>
areas 592 and 593 shown in FIGS. 78 (c) and 78 (d), the<br>
check of the recording position on the information<br>
storage medium is made at the same time as recording<br>
20 while the number of wobbles is counted. At this time,<br>
a wobble slip (recording at a position shifted by one<br>
wobble cycle) occurs due to mistaken wobble count or<br>
rotation non-uniformity of a rotary motor which rotates<br>
the information storage medium, and the recording<br>
25 position on the information storage medium is rarely<br>
shifted. The information storage medium according to<br>
the present embodiment is featured in that, in the case<br>
where a recording position shift generated as described<br>
above has been detected, adjustment is made in the<br>
rewritable-type guard area 461 shown in FIG. 83 (a),<br>
and recording timing correction is carried out in the<br>
5 guard area 461. Now, an H format will be described<br>
here. This basic concept is employed in a B format,<br>
described later. In FIGS, 83 (a) to 83 (f), although<br>
important information for which bit missing or bit<br>
duplication cannot be allowed is recorded in a<br>
10 postamble area 546, an extra area 544, and a pre-sync<br>
area 533, a specific pattern is repeated in the buffer<br>
area 547 and the VFO area 532. Thus, as long as this<br>
repetition boundary position is arranged, missing or<br>
duplication of only one pattern is allowed. Therefore,<br>
15 in the present embodiment, in particular, adjustment is<br>
made in the buffer area 547 or the VFO area 532, and<br>
recording timing correction is carried out.<br>
As shown in FIG. 84, in the present embodiment, an<br>
actual start point position defined as a reference of<br>
20 position setting is set so as to match a position of<br>
wobble amplitude "0" (wobble center). However, the<br>
position detecting precision of a wobble is low, and<br>
thus, in the present embodiment, the actual start point<br>
position allows a shift amount up to a maximum of ±1<br>
25 data byte", as "±1 max" in FIG. 84 is described.<br>
In FIGS. 83 (a) to 83 (f) and 84, the random shift<br>
amount in the data segment 530 is defined as Jm (as<br>
described above, the random shift amounts of all the<br>
data segments 529 coincide with each other in the<br>
recording cluster 540); and the random shift amount of<br>
the data segment 531 to be additionally written is<br>
5 defined as Jm+i- As a value which can be taken by Jm<br>
and Jm+i shown in the above formula, for example, when<br>
an intermediate value is taken, Jm = Jm+]_ = 84 is<br>
obtained. In the case where the positional precision<br>
of an actual start point is sufficiently high, the<br>
10 start position of the expanded guard field 528<br>
coincides with that of the VFO area 522, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 83 (c) and 83 (d).<br>
In contrast, after the data segment 530 is<br>
recorded at the maximum back position, in the case<br>
15 where the data segment 531 to be additionally written<br>
or rewritten has then been recorded in the maximum<br>
front position, the start position of the VFO area 522<br>
may enter a maximum 15 data bytes in the buffer area<br>
537. Specific important information is recorded in the<br>
20 extra area 534 that immediately precedes the buffer<br>
area 537. Therefore, in the present embodiment, a<br>
length of the buffer area 537 requires 16 data bytes or<br>
more. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 83 (c), a data<br>
size of the buffer area 537 is set to 15 data bytes in<br>
25 consideration of a margin of one data byte.<br>
As a result of a random shift, if a gap occurs<br>
between the expanded guard area 528 and the VFO area<br>
522, in the case where a single-sided double recording<br>
layer structure has been employed, there occurs an<br>
inter-layer crosstalk at the time of reproduction due<br>
to that gap. Thus, even if a random shift is carried<br>
5 out, a contrivance is made such that the expanded guard<br>
field 528 and the VFO area 522 partially overlap each<br>
other, and a gap is not produced. Therefore, in the<br>
present embodiment, it is necessary to set the length<br>
of the expanded guard field 528 to be equal to or<br>
10 greater than 15 data bytes. The succeeding VFO area<br>
522 sufficiently takes 71 data bytes. Thus, even if an<br>
overlap area of the expanded guard field 528 and the<br>
VFO area 522 slightly widens, there is no obstacle at<br>
the time of signal reproduction (because a time for<br>
15 obtaining synchronization of reproduction reference<br>
clocks is sufficiently arranged in the VFO area 522<br>
which does not overlap). Therefore, it is possible to<br>
set the value of the expanded guard field 528 to be<br>
greater than 15 data bytes. As has already been<br>
20 described, a wobble strip rarely occurs at the time of<br>
continuous recording, and a recording position may be<br>
shifted by one wobble cycle. One wobble cycle<br>
corresponds to 7.75 (=?8) data bytes, and thus, in the<br>
present embodiment, a length of the expanded guard<br>
25 field 528 is set to equal to or greater than 23 (= 15 +<br>
8) data bytes. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 83 (c),<br>
like the buffer area 537, the length of the expanded<br>
guard field 528 is set to 24 data bytes in<br>
consideration of a margin of one data byte similarly.<br>
In FIG. 83 (e), it is necessary to precisely set<br>
the recording start position of the recording cluster<br>
5 541. The information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the present embodiment detects this<br>
recording start position by using a wobble signal<br>
recorded in advance in the rewritable-type or writeonce<br>
type information storage medium. As shown in<br>
10 FIGS. 78A to 78D, in all areas other than the wobble<br>
sync area 580, a pattern changes from NPW to IPW in<br>
units of four wobbles. In comparison, in the wobble<br>
sync area 580, wobble switching units are partially<br>
shifted from four wobbles, and thus, the wobble sync<br>
15 area 580 can detect a position most easily. Thus, the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus according<br>
to the present embodiment detects a position of the<br>
wobble sync area 580, and then, carries out preparation<br>
for a recording process, and starts recording. Thus,<br>
20 it is necessary to arrange a start position of a<br>
recording cluster 541 in a non-modulation area 590<br>
immediately after the wobble sync area 580. FIG. 84<br>
shows the contents of the allocation. The wobble sync<br>
area 580 is arranged immediately after switching<br>
25 position of a physical segment. The length of the<br>
wobble sync area 580 is defined by 16 wobble cycles.<br>
Further, after detecting the wobble sync area 580,<br>
eight wobble cycles are required for preparation for<br>
the recording process in consideration of a margin.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIG. 84, even in consideration<br>
of a ransom shift, it is necessary that the start<br>
5 position of the VFO area 522 which exists at the start<br>
position of the recording cluster 541 is arranged<br>
rearwardly by 24 wobbles or more from a switching<br>
position of a physical segment.<br>
As shown in FIG. 83, a recording process is<br>
10 carried out many times in a duplicate site 591 at the<br>
time of rewriting. When rewriting is repeated, a<br>
physical shape of a wobble groove or a wobble land<br>
changes (is degraded), and the wobble reproduction<br>
signal amount is lowered. In the present embodiment,<br>
15 as shown in FIG. 83 (f), a contrivance is made so that<br>
a duplicate site 591 at the rewriting or at the time of<br>
additional writing is recorded in the non-modulation<br>
area 590 instead of arriving in the wobble sync area<br>
580 or wobble address area 586. In the non-modulation<br>
20 area 590, a predetermined wobble pattern (NPW) is<br>
merely repeated. Thus, even if a wobble reproduction<br>
signal amount is partially degraded, interpolation can<br>
be carried out by utilizing the preceding and<br>
succeeding wobble reproduction signals. In this way,<br>
25 the position of the duplicate site 591 at the rewriting<br>
or at the time of additional writing has been set so as<br>
to be included in the non-modulation area 590. Thus,<br>
there occurs advantageous effect that a stable wobble<br>
detection signal from the wobble address information<br>
610 can be guaranteed while preventing degradation of<br>
the wobble reproduction signal amount due to the shape<br>
5 degradation in the wobble sync area 580 or wobble<br>
address area 586.<br>
Now, FIG. 85 shows an embodiment of a method for<br>
additionally writing a write-once type data recorded on<br>
a write-once type information storage medium. A<br>
10 position rearwardly of 24 wobbles is defined as a<br>
writing start point from the boundary position of<br>
physical segment blocks. With respect to data to be<br>
newly additionally written, after a VFO area for<br>
71 data bytes has been formed, a data area (data field)<br>
15 in an ECC block is recorded. This writing start point<br>
coincides with an end position of the buffer area 537<br>
of recording data recorded immediately before the<br>
writing. The backward position at which the expanded<br>
guard field 528 has been formed by a length for eight<br>
20 data bytes is obtained as a recording end position of<br>
additional writing data (writing end point).<br>
Therefore, in the case where data has been additionally<br>
written, the data for eight data bytes is recorded to<br>
be duplicated at a portion of expanded guard field 529<br>
25 recorded just before and the VFO area to be newly<br>
additionally written.<br>
Chapter 8: Description of B Format<br>
Optical disk specification of B format<br>
FIG. 86 shows specification of an optical disk in<br>
a B format using a blue violet laser light source. The<br>
5 optical disks in the B format are classified into<br>
rewritable-type (RE disk), read-only (ROM disk), and<br>
write-once type (R disk). However, as shown in<br>
FIG. 86, common specification other than standard data<br>
transfer speed is defined in any type, facilitating the<br>
10 achievement of a drive commonly compatible with a<br>
different type. In a current DVD, two disk substrates<br>
having thickness of 0.6 nm are adhered to each other.<br>
In contrast, a structure is provided such that, in the<br>
B format, a recording layer is provided on a disk<br>
15 substrate having disk thickness of 1.1 nm, and the<br>
recording layer is covered with a transparent cover<br>
layer having thickness of 0.1 nm.<br>
[Error correction system]<br>
In the B format, there is employed an error<br>
20 correction system capable of efficiently sensing a<br>
burst error referred to as a "picket" code. A "picket"<br>
is inserted into main data (user data) patterns at<br>
predetermined intervals. The main data is protected by<br>
strong, efficient Reed Solomon codes. A "picket" is<br>
25 protected by second very strong, efficient Reed Solomon<br>
codes other than the main data. During decoding, a<br>
picket is first subjected to error correction.<br>
Correction information can be used to estimate a<br>
position of a burst error in the main data. As a<br>
symbol of these positions, there is set a flag called<br>
"erasure" utilized when correcting a code word of the<br>
5 main data.<br>
FIG. 87 shows a configuration of a "picket" code<br>
(error correction block). An error correction block<br>
(ECC block) of the B format is configured while the<br>
user data of 64 Kbytes is defined in unit in the same<br>
10 manner as in the H format. This data is protected by<br>
very string, Reed Solomon codes LDC (long distance<br>
codes).<br>
An LCD is formed of 304 cord words. Each code<br>
word is formed of 216 information symbols and 32 parity<br>
15 symbols. Namely, a code word length has 248 (= 216 +<br>
32) symbols. These code words are interleaved on a<br>
2 x 2 basis in a vertical direction of ECC blocks,<br>
configuring an ECC block of horizontal 152 (= 304/2)<br>
bytes x vertical 496 (= 2 x 216 + 2 x 32) bytes.<br>
20 A picket interleave length has 155 x 8 bytes<br>
(there are eight correction series of control codes in<br>
496 bytes), and a user data interleave length has 155 x<br>
2 bytes. The 496 types in the vertical direction are<br>
defined in units of recording on a 31 x 31 row basis.<br>
25 With respect to the parity symbols of the main data,<br>
two-groove parity symbols are provided as nests on a<br>
one by one row basis.<br>
In the B format, picket codes padded at<br>
predetermined intervals have been employed for this ECC<br>
block in a "columnar" shape. A burst error is sensed<br>
by referring to a state of that error. Specifically,<br>
5 four picket columns have been arranged at equal<br>
intervals in one ECC block. An address is also<br>
included in a "picket". A "picket" includes its unique<br>
parity.<br>
There is a need for correcting symbols in the<br>
10 picket columns, and thus, the "pickets" in the right<br>
three columns are subjected to error correction and<br>
encoding by means of BIS (burst indicator subcode), and<br>
is protected. This BIS is formed of 30 information<br>
symbols and 32 parity symbols, and a code word length<br>
15 has 62 symbols. It is found that very strong<br>
correction capability exists from a ratio between<br>
information symbols and parity symbols.<br>
The BIS code word is interleaved and stored in<br>
three picket columns each composed of 496 bytes. Here,<br>
20 the number of parity symbols per code word which both<br>
of LDS and BIS codes have is equal to 32 symbols. This<br>
denotes that LDC and BIS can be decoded by one common<br>
Reed Solomon decoder.<br>
When data is decoded, first, a correcting process<br>
25 of picket columns is carried out by means of the BIS.<br>
In this manner, a burst error location is estimated,<br>
and a flag called "erasure" is set in that location.<br>
This flag is utilized when a code word of the main data<br>
is corrected.<br>
The information symbols protected by the BIS codes<br>
forms additional data channels (side channels) other<br>
5 than the main data. This side channel stores address<br>
information. Prepared executive Reed Solomon codes<br>
other than the main data are used for error correction<br>
of address information. This code is formed of five<br>
information symbols and four parity symbols. In this<br>
10 manner, it has been possible to grasp an address at a<br>
high speed and with a high reliability independent of<br>
an error correction system of the main data.<br>
[Address format]<br>
In an RE disk, like a CD-R disk, a very thin<br>
15 groove is engraved as a recording track like a spiral.<br>
A recording mark is written into a protrusive portion<br>
viewed in a laser light beam incident direction from<br>
among the irregularities (on-groove recording).<br>
Address information indicating an absolute<br>
20 position on a disk is padded by slightly wobbling<br>
(meandering or swinging) this groove like a CD-R disk<br>
or the like. Digital data for modulating signal is<br>
included, the digital data indicating "1" or "0" in the<br>
shape or cycle of wobbling. FIG. 88 shows a wobble<br>
25 system. A wobbling amplitude is slightly + 10 nm in a<br>
disk radial direction. 56 wobbles (about 0.3 mm in<br>
disk length) is obtained as one bit of address<br>
information = ADIP unit (described later).<br>
In order to write a fine recording mark without<br>
almost any displacement, it is necessary to generate a<br>
stable, precise recording clock signal. Therefore,<br>
5 attention has been paid to a system in which a main<br>
frequency component of the wobbles is single and a<br>
groove is smoothly continuous. If the frequency is<br>
single, a stable recording clock signal can be easily<br>
generated from a wobble component sampled by a filter.<br>
10 Timing information or address information is added<br>
to a wobble on the basis of this single frequency.<br>
"Modulation" is performed for the purpose of this<br>
addition. For this modulation system, a system in<br>
which an error is unlikely to occur is selected even if<br>
15 a variety of variations specific to an optical disk<br>
occur.<br>
The following four variations of wobble signals<br>
generated in an optical disk are summarized on a factor<br>
by factor basis:<br>
20 1) Disk noise: A variation in a surface shape<br>
which occurs with a groove portion (surface roughness)<br>
at the time of manufacturing, noise generated in a<br>
recording film, and crosstalk noise leaks from recorded<br>
data:<br>
25 2) Wobble shift: A phenomenon that detection<br>
sensitivity is lowered by a relative shift of a wobble<br>
detection position from a normal position in a<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus. This shift is likely<br>
to occur immediately after seek operation.<br>
3) Wobble beat: A crosstalk generated between a<br>
track to be recorded and a wobble signal of the<br>
5 adjacent track. In the case where the rotation control<br>
system is CLV (constant linear velocity), this beating<br>
occurs in the case where a shift occurs with an angle<br>
frequency of the adjacent wobbles.<br>
4) Defect: This is caused by a local defect due to<br>
10 the dust or scratch of a disk surface.<br>
In an RE disk, two different wobble modulation<br>
systems are combined in the form such that a synergetic<br>
effect is produced under a condition that high<br>
durability is provided with respect to all of these<br>
15 different four types of signal variations. In general,<br>
this is because the durability relevant to four types<br>
of signal variations which is hardly achieved by only<br>
one type of modulation system can be obtained without<br>
any side effect.<br>
20 There are two systems: an MSK (minimum shift<br>
keying system; and an STW (saw tooth wobble) system<br>
(FIG. 89). The name of the STW comes from the fact<br>
that its waveform is like a saw tooth shape.<br>
In the RE disk, one bit of "0" or "1" is expressed<br>
25 by a total of 56 wobbles. These 56 wobbles are<br>
referred to as a unit, i.e., an ADIP (address inpre<br>
groove) unit. When the ADIP unit is continuously read<br>
out by 83 units, an ADIP word indicating one address is<br>
obtained. The ADIP word is formed of: address<br>
information having a 24-bit length; auxiliary data<br>
having a 12-bit length; a reference (correction) area;<br>
5 and error correction data. In the RE disk, three ADIP<br>
words per one RUB (recording unit block, units of 64<br>
Kbytes) for recording main data have been arranged.<br>
The DIP unit consisting of 56 wobbles is greatly<br>
divided into a first half and a latter half. The first<br>
10 half whose wobble numbers range from 0 to 17 is an MSK<br>
system; and the latter half whose wobble numbers range<br>
from 18 to 55 is a STW system. These systems smoothly<br>
communicate with a next ADIP unit. One bit can be<br>
expressed by one ADIP unit. Depending on whether "0"<br>
15 or "1" is set, first, in the first half, there is<br>
changed a position of a wobble to which MSK system<br>
modulation is applied; and, in the latter half, an<br>
orientation of a saw tooth shape is changed, thereby<br>
making discrimination.<br>
20 The first-half portion of the MSK system is<br>
divided into: a three-wobble area in which MSK<br>
modulation has been further performed; and a mono-tone<br>
wobble cos (cot) area. First, three wobbles from 0 to 2<br>
always start from at any ADIP unit to which MSK<br>
25 modulation has been applied. This is referred to as a<br>
bit sync (identifier indicating start position of ADIP<br>
unit).<br>
After this identifier has been passed,<br>
continuation of mono-tone wobbles is then obtained.<br>
Then, data is indicated according to how many mono-tone<br>
wobbles exist up to three wobbles which appear again<br>
5 next and which has been subjected to MSK modulation.<br>
Specifically, "0" is set in the case of 11 wobbles, and<br>
"1" is set in the case of 9 wobbles. Data is<br>
discriminated from each other by means of a shift of<br>
two wobbles. The MSK system utilizes a local phase<br>
10 change of a basic wave. In other words, an area in<br>
which no phase change occurs is dominant. In the STW<br>
system as well, this area is efficiently utilized as a<br>
location in which a phase of a basic wave does not<br>
change.<br>
15 An area to which MSK modulation has been applied<br>
has a three-wobble length. A phase is restored by<br>
setting a frequency at 1.5 times with respect to a<br>
mono-tone wobble at the first wobble; setting a<br>
frequency equal to that of a mono-tone wobble at the<br>
20 second wobble; and setting a frequency at 1.5 times<br>
again at the third wobble. By doing this, the polarity<br>
of the second (center) wobble is just inverted with<br>
respect to the mono-tone wobble, and this inversion is<br>
detected. At the first start point and at the third<br>
25 end point, a phase is just fitted to a mono-tone<br>
wobble. Therefore, smooth connection free from a<br>
discontinuous portion can be made.<br>
On the other hand, there are two types of<br>
waveforms in the latter half STW system. One waveform<br>
rapidly rises toward the disk outer periphery side and<br>
returns in gentle inclination to the disk center side,<br>
5 and the other waveform rises in gentle inclination, and<br>
returns rapidly. The former indicates data "0", and<br>
the latter indicates data "1". In one ADIP unit, the<br>
same bit is indicated by using both of the MSK system<br>
and the STW system, thereby improving data reliability.<br>
10 When the STW system is mathematically expressed, a<br>
secondary harmonic wave sin (2cot) whose amplitude is<br>
1/4 is added to or subtracted from a basic wave cos<br>
(cot) . However, even whichever of "0" and "1" the STW<br>
system indicates, a zero cross point is identical to a<br>
15 mono-tone wobble. Namely, its phase is not affected at<br>
all when a clock signal is sampled from a basic wave<br>
component common to a mono-tone portion in the MSK<br>
system.<br>
As described above, the MSK system and the STW<br>
20 system function so as to compensate for weak points of<br>
counterparts each other.<br>
FIG. 90 shows an ADIP unit. A basic unit of an<br>
address wobble forma is an ADIP unit. Each group of<br>
56 NML (nominal wobble length) is referred to as an<br>
25 ADIP unit. One NML is equal to 69 channel bits. An<br>
ADIP unit of a different type is defined by inserting a<br>
modulation wobble (MSK mark) into a specific position<br>
contained in an ADIP unit (refer to FIG. 89). 83 ADIP<br>
units are defined as one ADIP word. A minimum segment<br>
of data recorded in a disk precisely coincides with<br>
three continuous ADIP words. Each ADIP word includes<br>
5 36 information bits (24 bits of which are address<br>
information bits).<br>
FIGS. 91 and 92 each show a configuration of an<br>
ADIP word.<br>
One ADIP word includes 15 nibbles, and nine<br>
10 nibbles are information nibbles, as shown in FIG. 93.<br>
Other nibbles are used for ADIP error correction.<br>
15 nibbles configure a code word of Reed Solomon codes<br>
[15, 9, 7] .<br>
A code word is formed of nine information nibbles;<br>
15 six information nibbles record address information; and<br>
three information nibbles record auxiliary information<br>
(for example, disk information).<br>
Reed Solomon codes of [15, 9, 7] are nonsystematic,<br>
and a hamming distance due to "informed<br>
20 decoding" in knowledge in advance can be increased.<br>
The "informed decoding" is such that all code words<br>
have distance 7; all cod words of nibble ng has<br>
distance 8 in common; and knowledge in advance relating<br>
to ng increases a hamming distance. Nibble ng is<br>
25 formed of an MSB of a layer index (three bits) and a<br>
physical sector number. If nibble ng is known,<br>
distance increases from 7 to 8.<br>
FIG. 94 shows a track structure. A description<br>
will be given here with respect to a track structure of<br>
the first layer (which is distant from a laser light<br>
source) and the second layer of a disk having a single-<br>
5 sided double-layer structure. A groove is provided to<br>
enable tracking in a push-pull system. Plural types of<br>
track shapes are used. The first layer LQ and the<br>
second layer L]_ are different from each other in<br>
tracking direction. In the first layer, the left to<br>
10 the right of the figure is a tracking direction. In<br>
the second layer, the right to the left is a tracking<br>
direction. The left side of the figure is a disk inner<br>
periphery, and the right side is an outer periphery.<br>
A BCA (burst cutting area) area formed of a first-<br>
15 layer straight groove; a pre-recording area formed of<br>
an HFM (High Frequency Modulated) groove; and a wobble<br>
groove area in a rewritable area are equivalent to an<br>
H-format lead-in area. A wobble groove area in a<br>
second-layer rewritable area; a pre-recording area<br>
20 formed of an HFM (High Frequency Modulated) groove; and<br>
a BCA area formed of a straight groove are equivalent<br>
to an H format lead-out area. However, in the H<br>
format, the lead-in area and the lead-out area are<br>
recorded in a pre-pit system instead of a groove<br>
25 system. In the HFM groove, a phase is shifted in the<br>
first and second layers so as not to produce an interlayer<br>
crosstalk.<br>
FIG. 95 shows a recording frame. As shown in<br>
FIG. 87, the user data is recorded on 64 by 64 Kbytes<br>
basis. Each row of the ECC cluster is converted into<br>
the recording frame by adding frame sync bits and DC<br>
5 control units. The stream of 1240 bits (155 bytes) in<br>
each row is converted as follows. Data of 25 bits is<br>
arranged at the beginning of the 1240-bit stream, and<br>
the subsequent data is divided into data of 45 bits; a<br>
frame sync code of 20 bits is added before data of<br>
10 25 bits; one DC control bit is added after data of<br>
25 bits; and one DC control bit is added after data of<br>
45 bits similarly. A block including data of the first<br>
2 bits is defined as DC control block #0, and the<br>
subsequent data of 45 bits and one DC control bit are<br>
15 defined as DC control blocks #1, #2, ... #27. 496<br>
recording frames are referred to as a physical cluster.<br>
A recording frame is subjected to 1-7PP modulation<br>
at a rate of 2/3. A modulation rule is applied to 1268<br>
bits excluding the first frame sync code; 1902 channel<br>
20 bits are formed; and a frame sync code of 30 bits is<br>
added at the beginning of the entirety. That is, 1932<br>
channel bits (= 28 NML) are configured. A channel bit<br>
is subjected to NRZI modulation, and the modulated bit<br>
is recorded in a disk.<br>
25 Frame sync code structure<br>
Each physical cluster includes 16 address units.<br>
Each address unit includes 31 recording frames. Each<br>
recording frame starts from a frame sync code of 30<br>
channel bits. The first 24 bits of frame sync code<br>
violates a 1-7PP modulation rule (including a length<br>
which is twice of 91). Ihe 1-7PP modulation rule uses<br>
5 a (1, 7)PLL modulation system to carry out Parity<br>
Preserve/Prohibit RMTR (repeated minimum transition run<br>
length). Parity Preserve makes control of a so called<br>
DC (direct current) component of a code (decreases a DC<br>
component of a code). The remaining six bits of frame<br>
10 sync code changes, and identifies seven frame sync<br>
codes FSO, FS1, ... FS6. These six-bit signs are<br>
selected so that a distance relating to a deflection<br>
amount is equal to or greater than 2.<br>
Seven frame sync codes make it possible to obtain<br>
15 more detailed positional information than only 16<br>
address units. Of course, it is insufficient to<br>
identify 31 recording frames merely by seven different<br>
frame sync codes. Therefore, from 31 recording frames,<br>
seven frame sync sequences are selected so that each<br>
20 frame can be identified by using a combination between<br>
one's own frame sync codes and a frame sync code of<br>
each of four preceding frames.<br>
FIGS. 96A and 96B each show a structure of a<br>
recording unit block RUB. A recording unit is referred<br>
25 to as a RUB. As shown in FIG. 96A, the RUB is formed<br>
of: 40-wobble data run-in; a physical cluster of 496 x<br>
28 wobbles; and 16-wobble data run-out. Data run-in<br>
and data run-out enables sufficient data buffering in<br>
order to facilitate completely random overwriting. The<br>
RUB may be recorded on a one by one basis or a<br>
plurality of RUBs are continuously recorded as shown in<br>
5 FIG. 96B.<br>
Data run-in is mainly formed of a repetition<br>
pattern of 3T/3T/2T/2T/5T/5T, and two frame sync codes<br>
(FS4 and FS6) are spaced from each other by 40cbs as an<br>
indicator indicating a start position of a next<br>
10 recording unit block.<br>
The data run-out starts at FSO, follows a<br>
9T/9T/9T/9T/9T/9T pattern which indicates the end of<br>
data after FSO, and follows a repetition pattern mainly<br>
formed of 3T/3T/2T/2T/5T/5T.<br>
15 FIG. 97 shows a structure of data run-in and data<br>
run-out.<br>
FIG. 98 is a view showing allocation of data<br>
relating to a wobble address. A physical cluster is<br>
formed of 496 frames. A total of 56 wobbles (NWLs) of<br>
20 data run-in and data run-out are 2 x 28 wobbles, and<br>
correspond to two recording frames.<br>
One RUB = 496 + 2 = 498 recording frames<br>
One ADIP unit = 56 NWLs = Two recording frames<br>
83 ADIP units = One ADIP word (including one ADIP<br>
25 address)<br>
Three ADIP words = 3 x 83 ADIP units<br>
Three ADIP words = 3 x 83 x 2 = 498 recording<br>
frames<br>
When data is recorded in a write-once disk, it is<br>
necessary to continuously record next data in already<br>
5 recorded data. If a gap occurs with data, reproduction<br>
cannot be carried out. Then, in order to record<br>
(overwrite) the first data run-in of the succeeding<br>
recording frame to be overlapped on the last data runout<br>
of the preceding recording frame, three guard areas<br>
10 are arranged at the end of the data run-out area, as<br>
shown in FIGS. 99A and 99B. FIG. 99A shows a case in<br>
which only one physical cluster is recorded; and<br>
FIG. 99B shows a case in which a plurality of physical<br>
clusters are continuously recorded, wherein three guard<br>
15 areas are provided only after run-out of the last<br>
cluster. Thus, each of the recording units recorded<br>
along, or alternatively, a plurality of recording unit<br>
blocks continuously recorded are terminated in three<br>
guard areas. These three guard areas guarantees that<br>
20 an unrecorded area does not exist between the two<br>
recording unit blocks.<br>
Now, a description will be given with respect to<br>
reproduction durability of a write-once type<br>
information storage medium according to an embodiment<br>
25 of the present invention. This storage medium includes<br>
a transparent resin substrate formed in a disk shape,<br>
the substrate being made of a synthetic resin material<br>
such as polycarbonate, for example. On this<br>
transparent resin substrate, a groove is formed in a<br>
concentric shape or in a spiral shape. This<br>
transparent resin substrate can be manufactured by<br>
5 injection molding using a stamper.<br>
In addition, on this transparent resin substrate,<br>
a recording film including an organic dye is formed so<br>
as to fill its groove. An organic dye forming this<br>
recording film is used such that its maximum absorption<br>
10 wavelength area is shifted to a longer wavelength side<br>
than a recording wavelength (405 nm). In addition,<br>
absorption is not eliminated in a recording wavelength<br>
area, and a design has been made so as to have<br>
substantial light absorption.<br>
15 In this manner, in the case where focusing or<br>
tracking is carried out on a track before information<br>
recording by means of a recording laser light beam, a<br>
low light reflectivity is obtained. A dye decomposing<br>
reaction is caused by the laser light beam, and the<br>
20 light absorbance is lowered, and thereby the light<br>
reflectivity of a recording mark portion rises. Thus,<br>
there are achieved so called a low-to-high (L to H)<br>
characteristic that the light reflectivity of the<br>
recording mark portion formed by irradiating the laser<br>
25 light beam is higher than that before the laser light<br>
irradiation.<br>
In addition, a transparent resin substrate, and,<br>
in particular, a groove bottom may be deformed due to a<br>
heat generated. In this case, a phase difference may<br>
occur with reflection light.<br>
The above-described organic dye is liquefied by<br>
5 being solved in a solvent, and the liquefied dye can be<br>
easily applied onto a transparent resin substrate<br>
surface in accordance with a spin coat technique. In<br>
this case, film thickness can be managed with high<br>
precision by controlling a dilution rate based on a<br>
10 solvent or a rotation speed at the time of spin<br>
coating.<br>
The organic dye consists of a dye portion and an<br>
counter-ion (anion) portion. As the dye portion, a<br>
cyanine dye or a styryl dye and the like can be used.<br>
15 In particular, the cyanine dye and the styryl dye are<br>
preferred because absorbance relative to a recording<br>
wavelength is easily controlled.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 102A to 102E and 101A to 101C,<br>
a description will be given with respect to a method<br>
20 for producing a disk stamper for a write-once type<br>
storage medium.<br>
As shown in FIG. 102A, there is prepared: a<br>
silicon wafer 2011 for manufacturing a semiconductor,<br>
the wafer being formed in a disk shape to have a<br>
25 diameter of 200 nm and thickness of 0.725 mm.<br>
This silicon wafer 2011 is immersed for 5 minutes<br>
in a mixture solution of a thermal concentrated<br>
sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide water (solution<br>
temperature 100°C). Next, the silicon wafer 2011 is<br>
rinsed by immersing it in ultra-pure water, and the<br>
rinsed wafer is washed with ultrasound waves; the<br>
5 washed wafer is immersed in a 70°C ultra-pure water<br>
tank, and the immersed wafer is dried by gradually<br>
pulling it up.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 102B, an electron beam<br>
resist film 2012 is formed on a surface of the silicon<br>
10 wafer 2011. This electron beam resist film 2012 is<br>
formed by spin-coating a resist solution obtained by<br>
mixing and stirring an electron beam resist (ZEP520A7<br>
available from ZEON Corporation) by 86.2% by weight<br>
with respect to an anisole solvent (ZEP-A available<br>
15 from ZEON Corporation) on a surface of the silicon<br>
wafer 2011.<br>
In addition, in a spin coating condition, the<br>
silicon wafer 2011 is vacuum-chucked on a spin table; a<br>
resist solution is dropped at the center part of the<br>
20 silicon wafer 2011 via a 0.1 micron filter while<br>
rotation of the spin table stops; and then, the spin<br>
table is rotated at 2500 rpm.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 102C, a groove 2013 is<br>
formed in the electron beam resist film 2012. This is<br>
25 accomplished by putting the silicon wafer 2011 coated<br>
with the electron beam resist film 2012 in a vacuum<br>
tank serving as an electron beam cutting machine;<br>
carrying out evacuation up to 10~5 Pa; and then,<br>
rotating the silicon wafer 2011; irradiating an<br>
electron beam from an electron gun 2014 to the electron<br>
beam resist film 2012; and carrying out electron-beam<br>
5 recording of a concentric or spiral groove pattern.<br>
A groove pattern recording condition is such that<br>
an electron beam acceleration voltage is 50 kV; a beam<br>
current is 120 nA; a beam diameter is 110 nm; and a<br>
recording beam linear speed is 1.1 m/sec. In a<br>
10 recording area of the groove 2013, the radius of the<br>
silicon wafer 2011 ranges from 23 mm to 59 mm.<br>
Then, the silicon wafer 2011 on which the groove<br>
13 has been recorded is removed from the inside of the<br>
vacuum tank serving as the electron beam cutting<br>
15 machine, and dip developing is carried out while the<br>
removed silicon wafer is immersed in an organic<br>
developing solution 2016 contained in an immersing tank<br>
2015, as shown in FIG. 102D, thereby forming a resist<br>
pattern of the groove 2013.<br>
20 Next, DC sputtering of an Ni film is carried out,<br>
and thereby an Ni thin film 2017 is formed and<br>
electrically conducted onto the above-described resist<br>
pattern surface, as shown in FIG. 102E.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 101A, Ni electric casting<br>
25 is carried out on the Ni thin film 2017, forming an Niplated<br>
layer 2018 having thickness of 247 Then, as<br>
shown in FIG. 101B, the Ni-plated layer 2018 is<br>
released, and spin-coated, and then, the residual resin<br>
is released from a surface by means of oxygen RIE.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 101C, the Ni-plated layer 2018<br>
is coated with a protective film; a back face side<br>
5 thereof is polished; an inner diameter and an outer<br>
diameter are processed; and a disk stamper 2019 is<br>
produced.<br>
Next, a write-once type optical disk is produced<br>
by using this disk stamper 2019. That is, as shown in<br>
10 FIG. 100A, by using the disk stamper 2019, injection<br>
molding is carried out by using an injection molding<br>
device SD40 available from Sumitomo Heavy Industries<br>
Co., Ltd, thereby duplicating a transparent disk<br>
substrate 2020 made of polycarbonate having thickness<br>
15 of 0.6 mm as shown in FIG. 101B. A groove 2021 is, of<br>
course, formed on this disk substrate 2020.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 100C, by using a dispenser<br>
2022 having a nozzle diameter of 21G, an organic dye<br>
solution 2023 described later obtained by dissolving an<br>
20 organic dye in a solvent is dropped on a surface of the<br>
disk substrate 2020 on which the groove 2021 is formed.<br>
Next, by rotationally controlling the disk substrate<br>
2020, as shown in FIG. 100D, the groove 2021 is filled<br>
with the organic dye solution 2023, and a recording<br>
25 film 2024 is formed.<br>
A spin coat condition of this recording film 2024,<br>
as shown in FIG. 103, is such that, first, the disk<br>
substrate 2020 is rotationally driven from an inactive<br>
state to 300 rpm within 1 second, and the organic dye<br>
solution 2023 is coated by means of the dispenser 2022<br>
while this state is maintained for 8 seconds. Next,<br>
5 the rotation frequency of the disk substrate 2020 is<br>
increased to 1800 rpm within 2 seconds, and this state<br>
is maintained for 15 seconds. Then, the rotation<br>
frequency of the disk substrate 2020 is increased to<br>
3000 rpm within 2 seconds, and this state is maintained<br>
10 for 3 seconds.<br>
The film thickness of the recording film 2024 can<br>
be controlled by controlling the rotation speed at a<br>
second stage. More specifically, the film thickness of<br>
the recording film 2024 can be increased by setting the<br>
15 rotation speed at the second stage at a low speed.<br>
Next, the disk substrate 2020 coated with the<br>
recording film 2024 is baked at 80°C for 30 seconds by<br>
using a clean oven, and a 100 nm metal film 2025 is<br>
sputtered on the recording film 2024, as shown in<br>
20 FIG. 100E. An Ag alloy including 1% of Bi in Ag is<br>
used as this metal film 2025.<br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 100F, an ultraviolet-ray<br>
curing type resin 2026 is spin-coated on the metal film<br>
2025, and a disk substrate 2027 made of polycarbonate<br>
25 having thickness of 0.6 mm is adhered onto the spincoated<br>
resin, and thereby a write-once type optical<br>
disk (R disk) 2028 including an organic dye in the<br>
recording film 2024 is produced.<br>
Here, in the write-once type optical disk 2028<br>
produced as described above, a laser light beam for<br>
recording and reproduction by an optical head 2029 is<br>
5 made incident from a face opposite to a face coated<br>
with the recording film 2024 of the disk substrate<br>
2020, as shown in FIG. 104.<br>
In this case, a bottom face 2021a of the groove<br>
2021 formed on the disk substrate 2020 and a land 2020<br>
10 sandwiched between the adjacent grooves 2021 are<br>
obtained as information recording tracks. The<br>
recording track made of the bottom face 2021a of the<br>
groove 2021 is referred to as a groove track Gt, and<br>
the recording track made of the land 2030 is referred<br>
15 to as a land track Lt.<br>
In addition, a height difference between a face of<br>
the groove track Gt and a face of the land track Lt is<br>
referred to as a groove depth Gh. Further, a width of<br>
the groove track Gt viewed from a height which is<br>
20 almost 1/2 of the groove depth Gh is referred to as a<br>
groove width Gw, and a width of the land track Lt<br>
viewed from a height which is almost 1/2 of the groove<br>
depth Gh is referred to as a land width Lw.<br>
Now, a description will be given with respect to<br>
25 generation of the above-described organic dye solution<br>
2023. This organic dye solution 2023 is used as a<br>
solution having a solution concentration of 1.2% by<br>
weight obtained by dissolving organic dye powders of<br>
1.2g in 100 nm of TFP. A solution condition for a<br>
solvent is such that dye powders are put in the<br>
solvent, and ultrasound waves are applied for<br>
5 30 minutes.<br>
By using the organic dye, a write-once optical<br>
disk 2028 is produced by the above-described method,<br>
and recording and reproduction are carried out in these<br>
groove tracks Gt, thereby carrying out an evaluation<br>
10 test. As an evaluation device, an optical disk<br>
evaluation device available from PULSTEC Co., Ltd is<br>
used.<br>
A testing condition is such that an objective lens<br>
aperture NA of an optical head is 0.65; a wavelength of<br>
15 a laser light beam for recording and reproduction is<br>
405 nm; and a linear velocity during recording and<br>
reproduction is 6.61 m/sec. A recording signal is 8-12<br>
modulated random data, and is a waveform recorded by<br>
predetermined recording power and two types of bias<br>
20 powers 1 and 2 as shown in FIG. 105.<br>
In addition, track pitches are 400 nm; a groove<br>
width Gw is defied as "1.2" with respect to a land<br>
width Lw "I"; a wobble amplitude of the groove track Gt<br>
is 14 nm; and the groove depth Gh is 60 nm. Wobble<br>
25 phase modulation is used to record address information<br>
using wobbles.<br>
Here, three types of evaluation characteristics<br>
are measured including: a carrier noise ratio CNR of a<br>
reproduction signal; an SN ratio during partial<br>
response (partial response signal to noise ratio:<br>
PRSNR); and a simulated bit error rate SbER. PRSNR<br>
5 defining and measuring techniques are described in a<br>
book which can be purchased from DVD Format Logo<br>
Licensing Co., Ltd. This is a part of Annex H of DVD<br>
Specifications for High Density Read-Only Disc PART 1<br>
Physical Specifications Version 1.0. It is preferable<br>
10 that the PRSNR be 15 or more. The SbER defining and<br>
measuring techniques are described in a book which can<br>
be purchased from DVD Format Logo Licensing Co., Ltd.<br>
This is a part of Annex H of DVD Specifications for<br>
High Density Read-Only Disc PART 1 Physical<br>
15 Specifications Version 1.0. It is preferable that the<br>
SbER be 5.0 x 10~5 or less. The PRSNR and SbER are<br>
measured in a state in which information is recorded in<br>
the adjacent tracks.<br>
As evaluation characteristics, three types of<br>
20 light reflectivity, SbER, and PRSNR are measured. A<br>
light reflectivity defining and measuring techniques<br>
are described in a book which can be purchases from DVD<br>
Format Logo Licensing Co., Ltd. This is a part of<br>
Annex D of DVD Specifications for High Density Read-<br>
25 Only Disc PART 1 Physical Specifications Version 1.0.<br>
The reflectivity corresponds to I11H level after<br>
recording. It is preferable that the reflectivity<br>
range from 14% to 28% in order to obtain reproduction<br>
light durability of 1,000,000 times or more.<br>
In addition, in the case where management<br>
information (system lead-in) is inserted into a certain<br>
5 portion of a disk, for example, into the innermost<br>
peripheral area, the most advantageous effect can be<br>
attained in this Low-to-High recording disk. With<br>
respect to management information, pit arrays identical<br>
to those on a ROM disk substrate are formed on a disk<br>
10 substrate. What is recorded as a pit array is<br>
management information such as whether the disk is a<br>
read-only type or write-once type, or rewritable type;<br>
what recording and reproducing wavelength is, whether<br>
the recording film type is Low-to-High or High-to-Low,<br>
15 and what a recording data capacity is. The track<br>
pitches of a groove of a recording data area are<br>
selected as 400 nm or in the range of 320 nm to 300 nm.<br>
Advantageously, the track pitches of the pit array in<br>
this management information area is formed to be wider<br>
20 than the above track pitches, and data bit pitches of<br>
pits are larger than that of the recording data area,<br>
thereby facilitating reproduction and making it<br>
possible to easily judge management information. The<br>
Low-to-High disk is uniform in signal level position<br>
25 between a system lead-in area and a data area, and<br>
drive reproduction is made easy.<br>
Now, a description will be given with respect to a<br>
test result relating to reproduction durability count<br>
in the case where a mark recorded in an optical disk<br>
using an organic dye material according to the present<br>
invention for a recording material has been<br>
5 continuously reproduced by a blue laser light beam<br>
pickup. Here, testing has been carried out with<br>
respect to 5 types of organic dye materials.<br>
A first material is dye "A" which is an organic<br>
metal complex simplex, and a general structural formula<br>
10 of Al which is an example of the dye is shown in<br>
FIG. 106. Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Al,<br>
Gd, and Y or the like are mainly used as M. Cu is the<br>
best in reproduction light durability.<br>
As Rl to R5, there are used CH3, C2H5, H,<br>
15 CH2N(CH3)2, SCH3, N02, Cl, S02NHCH3, CN, and CH30CH2 or<br>
the like without being limited thereto. In particular,<br>
in the case where Cl has been added, the best<br>
reproduction light durability is obtained.<br>
In an example Al of dye "A", M is Cu; Rl is CH3;<br>
20 R2 is CH3; R3 is Cti^; R4 is Cl; and R5 is Cl.<br>
A second material is dye B which is an organic<br>
metal complex simplex having another structure, and a<br>
general structural formula of Bl which is an example of<br>
the dye is shown in FIG. 107. Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, Sc,<br>
25 Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Al, Gd, and Y or the like are mainly<br>
used as M. Cu is the best in reproduction light<br>
durability.<br>
As Rl to R5, there are used CH3, C2H5, H, CH2N<br>
(CH3) 2i SCH3, N02, Cl, S02NHCH3, CN, and CH3OCH2 or<br>
the like without being limited thereto. In particular,<br>
in the case where Cl has been added, the best<br>
5 reproduction light durability is obtained.<br>
In an example Bl of dye B, M is Cu; Rl is C2H5; R2<br>
is CH3; R3 is C2H5,- R4 is SCH3; and R5 is Cl.<br>
Bl is better than Al in PRSNR and SbER when it is<br>
used for an optical disk; and is better in recording<br>
10 and reproducing characteristics such as large degree of<br>
modulation and high reflectivity.<br>

25 the periodic table such as an oxygen atom, a sulfur<br>
atom, a selenium atom, and a tellurium atom, for<br>
example.<br>
The organic metal complex represented by the<br>
general formula is generally used in a mode in which<br>
one or a plurality of metal complexes are oriented at a<br>
metal (center atom). Examples of metal elements<br>

15 A test for reproduction degradation was carried<br>
out by recording an ETM modulation signal in a writeonce<br>
type R optical disk fabricated by using the above<br>
5 types of organic dye materials, and then, obtaining<br>
reproduction count when a degree of signal modulation<br>
20 is 0.4 or less, PRSNR is 15 or less, and SbER is 5 x<br>
10~5 or more in the case where a track recorded by<br>
predetermined reproduction laser power was continuously<br>
reproduced (still-reproduced) at a line speed of 6.61<br>
m/sec. The reproduction light stability is better as<br>
25 the reproduction count increases. A result is shown in<br>
FIG. 122. It was found that the reproduction<br>
durability count is 1,000,000 or more at the<br>
reproduction laser power of 0.4 mW in an "L to H" type<br>
optical disk using a mixture dye. Namely, it was found<br>
that a mixture of a plurality of an organic metal<br>
complex simplex and an organic metal complex cation and<br>
5 anion has excellent reproduction light durability. In<br>
particular, the fifth mixture dye of two types of<br>
organic metal complex cation and anion and an organic<br>
metal complex simplex achieved 1,500,000 or more in<br>
reproduction light durability.<br>
10 In addition, with respect to the reflectivity<br>
obtained by measuring I11H after recording, the<br>
reflectivity was 12% in the case of the first dye "A"<br>
and 30% in the case of the second dye. The<br>
reflectivity was 14% in the case of the third dye U + W<br>
15 + Y; the reflectivity was 22% in the case of the fourth<br>
dye B + W -I- Y; and the reflectivity was 28% in the case<br>
of the fifth dye U + W + Y. Therefore, it was<br>
experimentally found convenient that the reflectivity<br>
ranges from 14% to 28% in order to obtain the<br>
20 reproduction light durability of 1,000,000 times or<br>
more.<br>
In addition, a novel embodiment that the following<br>
concept of constitution of a mixture dye is proper was<br>
obtained. This constitution consists of at least two<br>
25 portions, i.e., a "recording function dye" and a<br>
"reproduction light durability function dye". An<br>
organic metal complex such as A, B, or Y can be used as<br>
the former "recording function dye". The organic metal<br>
complex is not limited to these structures or<br>
skeletons. In addition, U, V, W, WW, WWW, and WWWW can<br>
be used. Use of an anion and cation type is convenient<br>
5 to further improve reproduction light durability.<br>
Mainly, it is preferable to use a dye of this portion<br>
having excellent performance of recording and<br>
reproducing characteristics. The latter "reproduction<br>
light durability function dye" serves to improve the<br>
10 reproduction light durability. Although the use of one<br>
type of the dye will suffice, the use of two types is<br>
further effective. An organic metal complex such as A,<br>
B, or Y can also be used. The organic metal complex is<br>
not limited to these structures and skeletons. In<br>
15 addition, U, V, W, WW, WWW, and WWWW can be used. The<br>
use of a cation and anion type is convenient to further<br>
improve the reproduction light durability. In<br>
particular, the use of dyes W, WW, WWW, and WWWW is<br>
preferable to improve the reproduction light<br>
20 durability. For example, in the case where two types<br>
are used, it is convenient to carry out recording of a<br>
burst cutting area (BCA) by adjusting a maximum<br>
absorption wavelength of one dye in the range of 630 nm<br>
to 680 nm, and large BCA amplitude can be obtained. In<br>
25 the case where a high level voltage (IBH) of a BCA<br>
signal is set to 100%, it becomes possible to set the<br>
BCA signal amplitude to 20% or more. IBL/IBH can be<br>
set to 0.80 or less when this amplitude is expressed by<br>
using a low level voltage (IBL).<br>
In addition, with respect to a mixture ratio of<br>
the "recording function dye" and the "reproduction<br>
light durability function dye", it is preferable that<br>
the "reproduction light durability function dye" range<br>
from 30% to 400% in the case where the "recording<br>
function dye" is set to 100%. It is particularly<br>
preferable that the above dye range from 150% to 300%.<br>
The best ratio should be set to 200%. It is preferable<br>
that a dye added for BCA recording range from 5% to<br>
50%. It is particularly preferable that the dye range<br>
from 10% to 30%. The best ratio should be set to 15%.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the abovedescribed<br>
embodiments. At a stage of carrying out the<br>
invention, the present invention can be embodied by<br>
modifying constituent elements without departing from<br>
the spirit of the invention. In addition, a variety of<br>
inventions can be formed by using a proper combination<br>
of a plurality of constituent elements disclosed in the<br>
above-described embodiments. For example, some<br>
constituent elements may be eliminated from all the<br>
constituent elements shown in the embodiments.<br>
Further, the constituent elements over the different<br>
embodiments may be properly combined with each other.<br>
Examples<br>
Now, examples of the recording film will be<br>
described here. In the following examples, one-sided<br>
single layer mediums and one-sided double layer mediums<br>
were fabricated. As a substrate, there was used a<br>
polycarbonate (PC) substrate having thickness of 0.6 mm<br>
fabricated by injection molding. A groove was formed<br>
on the substrate in track pitches of 0.4 (am. A onesided<br>
single layer medium was fabricated as follows.<br>
That is, a dye was coated on the substrate in<br>
accordance with a spin coat technique. On the coated<br>
substrate, a reflection layer was formed in a<br>
sputtering technique. On the formed reflection layer,<br>
a PC substrate having thickness of 0.6 mm was adhered<br>
by using an UV curing resin.<br>
On the other hand, two methods can be used in the<br>
case of the one-sided double layer medium. In a first<br>
method, the one-sided double layer medium was<br>
fabricated as follows. On an LO substrate, a dye was<br>
coated in accordance with a spin coat technique. On<br>
the coated substrate, a semipermeable reflection layer<br>
was formed in accordance with a sputtering technique.<br>
On the formed layer, an interlayer separating layer and<br>
a groove for LI were formed in accordance with a 2P<br>
technique (photo polymer technique). Further, on the<br>
formed groove, a dye was coated again in accordance<br>
with the spin coat technique. On the coated layer, a<br>
reflection layer was formed in accordance with the<br>
sputtering technique. Lastly, a PC substrate having<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm was adhered to the formed<br>
reflection layer by using a UV curing resin. In this<br>
method, the LO-layer semipermeable reflection film was<br>
formed, and further, another layer can be formed on the<br>
formed reflection film for adjustment of optical<br>
characteristics. In a second method, the following<br>
preparation was carried out. On an LO substrate, a dye<br>
was coated in accordance with a spin coat technique.<br>
On the coated substrate, a semipermeable reflection<br>
layer was formed in accordance with a sputtering<br>
technique. In addition, on the LI substrate, first, a<br>
reflection layer is formed in accordance with a<br>
sputtering technique. On the formed reflection layer,<br>
a dye was coated in accordance with a spin coat<br>
technique. The fabricated LO and LI substrates were<br>
adhered to each other using a UV curing resin while<br>
their respective semipermeable reflection film and<br>
organic dye film were set inwardly. In this method,<br>
another layer can be inserted between an organic dye<br>
layer which is a recording layer of Ll and the UV<br>
curing resin for the purpose of stabilizing an organic<br>
dye which is a recording film material of Ll or<br>
adjusting optical characteristics. In the present<br>
embodiment, testing was carried out using mediums<br>
fabricated by both of the methods.<br>
For evaluation, a disk evaluation device ODU-1000<br>
available from a PULSTEC Co., Ltd. was used. This<br>
device includes a blue violet semiconductor laser<br>
having a wavelength of 405 nm and an objective lens of<br>
NA = 0.65. Recording and reproducing testing was<br>
carried out under a condition for a linear velocity of<br>
6.6 m/sec. Evaluation was carried out with respect to<br>
five characteristics below. That is, measurements of<br>
(a) SbER (Simulated bit Error Rate); (b) PRSNR (Partial<br>
Response Signal to Noise Ratio) ; (c) Modulation; (d)<br>
reflectivity of data portion; and (e) read stability of<br>
each storage medium were carried out. The evaluation<br>
criteria were defined as follows. That is, in the case<br>
where continuous readout is carried out at an SbER of<br>
5.0 x 10~5 or less, a PRSNR of 15.0 or more, a<br>
modulation of 0.4 or more, a reflectivity of 14% or<br>
more in the case of a one-sided single layer medium or<br>
a reflectivity of 4% or more in each of the LO and LI<br>
mediums in the case of one-sided double layer, at power<br>
of 0.4 mW in the case of a one-sided single layer<br>
medium and at any good power of 0.4 mW to 0.8 mW in the<br>
case of a one-sided double layer medium for read<br>
stability, even if readout was carried out for<br>
1,000,000 times or more, characteristics (a) to (e)<br>
must achieve their target values. Read power in the<br>
one-sided double layer medium was selected as a<br>
condition such that SN ratios and signal amplitudes of<br>
reproduction signals are substantially equal to each<br>
other in LO and LI. This is because optical<br>
characteristics (LO reflectivity and transmittance, LI<br>
reflectivity) and sensitivity of a medium and a signal<br>
amplitude and SN ratio of reflection signal are<br>
different depending on a dye of a medium and a material<br>
and a film thickness or the like of the reflection<br>
film. However, the read power values of LO and LI are<br>
often identical to each other. In the case where all<br>
the characteristics met the target values, the storage<br>
medium was defined as "good", and if only one<br>
characteristic failed to meet its target value, the<br>
medium was defined as being "unacceptable".<br>
There were used three types of organic dye<br>
recording materials (occasionally simply referred to as<br>
dye), i.e., (1) cation-anion based; (2) organic metal<br>
complex (azo based); and (3) mixture dye of cationanion<br>
based and organic metal complex (azo based). The<br>
used reflection films are binary Ag allows, i.e., AgAu,<br>
AgBi, AgCa, AgCe, AgCo, AgGa, AgLa, AgMg, AgN, AgNi,<br>
AgNd, AgPd, AgY, AgW, AgZr; and tertiary Ag alloys,<br>
i.e., AgAlMg, AgAuBi, AgBiGa, AgAuCo, AgAuCe, AgAuNi,<br>
AgAuMg, AgBiMg, AgBiN, AgBiPd, and AgBiZr; and<br>
advantageous effect in the case where additive elements<br>
of group 1 and group 2 and N (nitrogen) were added at<br>
the same time was verified. As a film forming method,<br>
there was used each of Ag alloy targets described<br>
previously or there was used a multi-dimensional<br>
simultaneous sputtering in which a sputtering condition<br>
was adjusted so as to obtain a desired constitution.<br>
Reaction with nitrogen was carried out by using as a<br>
sputtering gas a mixture gas of Ar and N (nitrogen)<br>
instead of only Ar. The constitution, film thickness,<br>
and substrate shape of dyes and reflection films were<br>
adjusted, respectively, so that signal characteristics<br>
are good.<br>
Additive amounts of additive elements in an Ag<br>
alloy reflection film used in each of examples were<br>
four levels of 0.05 at%, 1 at%, 2 at%, and 5 at%, and<br>
three levels of (1), (2), and (3) were used for organic<br>
dye materials. Therefore, a total number of sample<br>
types produced in examples were 12. FIG. 123 and<br>
FIG. 124 each show additive element names of Ag-alloy<br>
reflection films used in examples, and FIG. 125 shows<br>
Ag-alloy reflection films and amounts of additive<br>
elements used in comparative examples and a chart of<br>
combination with organic dye materials. As organic dye<br>
material (4), there was used a conventionally used dye<br>
material, i.e., a phthalocyanine based organic dye and<br>
super-green dye (IRAPHOR Utragreen MX available from<br>
Ciba Speciality Chemicals).<br>
Example 1<br>
In example 1, a one-sided single layer storage<br>
medium was produced, and testing was carried out. Au<br>
was used as an additive element of an Ag-alloy<br>
reflection film; four types 0.05 at%, 1 at%, 2 at%, and<br>
5 at% were used as additive amounts; and three types<br>
(1), (2), and (3) were used as organic dye materials<br>
for recording films. In order to cover all<br>
combinations of amounts of additive elements and dye<br>
materials, all combinations, 12 types of storage<br>
mediums were produced, and evaluation of the recording<br>
and reproducing characteristics were carried out.<br>
FIG. 126 specifically exemplifies constitutions of<br>
reflection films and combinations of organic dye<br>
materials for recording films.<br>
When the characteristics (a) to (e) of the<br>
produced storage mediums were evaluated, the evaluation<br>
results were obtained as shown in FIG. 127.<br>
As is evident from these results, each of the<br>
storage mediums achieved the target values; SbER of<br>
5.0 x 10~5 or less; PRSNR of 15.0 or more; modulation<br>
of 0.4 or more; reflectivity of 14% or more; and read<br>
stability of 1,000,000 times or more. Therefore, each<br>
of the storage mediums obtained "good" characteristics.<br>
Example 2<br>
In example 2, one-sided single layer and double<br>
layer storage mediums were produced. Bi was used as an<br>
additive element of an Ag-alloy reflection film; four<br>
types 0.05 at%, 1 at%, 2 at%, and 5 at% were used as<br>
amounts of additives; and three types (1), (2), and (3)<br>
was used as organic dye materials for recording films.<br>
As in example 1, 12 combinations of storage mediums<br>
were produced, and evaluation of recording and<br>
reproducing characteristics were carried out. With<br>
respect to the one-sided double layer storage medium, a<br>
medium whose Bi additive amounts are 0.05 at% and 1 at%<br>
was produced, and with respect to the one-sided single<br>
layer storage medium, a medium whose Bi additive<br>
amounts are 1 at%, 2 at%, and 5 at% was produced,<br>
respectively, and evaluation was carried out. FIG. 128<br>
specifically exemplifies constitutions of reflection<br>
films and combinations of organic dye materials for<br>
recording films.<br>
When the characteristics (a) to (e) of the<br>
produced storage mediums were evaluated, the evaluation<br>
results were obtained as shown in FIG. 129. In<br>
FIG. 129, data represented with "double layer"<br>
indicates data on a one-sided double layer medium in<br>
the case where there exists data on both of a one-sided<br>
single layer medium and a one-sided double layer<br>
medium.<br>
As is evident from these results, each of the<br>
storage mediums achieved the target values; SbER of<br>
5.0 x 10~5 or less; PRSNR of 15.0 or more; modulation<br>
of 0.4 or more; reflectivity of 4% or more relevant to<br>
the one-sided double layer medium in both of LO and LI<br>
and 14% or more relevant to the one-sided single layer<br>
medium; and read stability of 1,000,000 times or more.<br>
Therefore, each of the storage mediums obtained "good"<br>
characteristics.<br>
Example 3<br>
In example 3, as in example 1, a one-sided single<br>
layer storage medium was produced. Ca was used as an<br>
additive element of an Ag-alloy reflection film; four<br>
types 0.05 at%, 1 at%, 2 at%, and 5 at% were used as<br>
amounts of additives; and three types (1), (2), and (3)<br>
were used as organic dye materials for recording films.<br>
As in example 1, 12 types of storage mediums were<br>
produced, and evaluation of recording and reproducing<br>
characteristics were carried out. Each of the storage<br>
mediums achieved the target values; SbER of 5.0 x 10~5<br>
or less; PRSNR of 15.0 or more; modulation of 0.4 or<br>
more; reflectivity of 14% or more; and read stability<br>
of 1,000,000 times or more. Therefore, each of the<br>

1,000,000 times or more. Therefore, each of the<br>
storage mediums achieved only "unacceptable"<br>
characteristics.<br>
Comparative example 3<br>
In comparative example 3, as in example 1, a onesided<br>
single layer storage medium was produced. Pd was<br>
used as an additive element of an Ag-alloy reflection<br>
film; two types of 0.04 at% and 6 at% were used as<br>
additive amounts; and a phthalocyanine based organic<br>
dye and super-green dye (IRGAPHOR Ultragreen MX<br>
available from Ciba Speciality Chemicals) were used as<br>
organic dye materials for recording films. A storage<br>
medium was produced, and evaluation of recording and<br>
reproducing characteristics were carried out. In the<br>
case where the additive amount of Pd contained in the<br>
Ag alloy was defined as 6 at%, the modulation and<br>
reflectivity did not meet 0.4 or more and 14% or more<br>
which are their target values, and was "unacceptable".<br>
In addition, in the case where the additive amount of<br>
Pd contained in the Ag alloy was defined as 0.04 at%,<br>
in particular, read stability did not achieve<br>
1,000,000 times or more. Therefore, each of the<br>
storage mediums achieved only "unacceptable"<br>
characteristics.<br>
According to an embodiment, a storage medium<br>
comprises a transparent resin substrate on which a<br>
groove is formed; a recording layer formed on the<br>
groove on the transparent resin substrate, the<br>
recording layer using an organic dye material and<br>
recording information with a light beam of 620 nm or<br>
less in wavelength; a reflection layer formed on the<br>
recording layer; and a prevention layer formed between<br>
the recording layer and the reflection layer, the<br>
prevention layer preventing degradation of<br>
characteristics of the reflection layer.<br>
In the storage medium, the reflection layer may<br>
comprise Ag and an additive element selected from Al,<br>
Au, Bi, Ca, Ce, Co, Cu, Ga, La, Mg, N, Ni, Nd, Pd, Pt,<br>
Rh, Y, W, and Zr.<br>
In the storage medium, a total amount of the<br>
additive elements may range from 0.05 at% to 5 at%.<br>
