				<td>The present invention relates to a spiroazabicyclic heterocyclic amines of formula i and process thereof.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel spiroazabicyclic heterocyclic amines or pharmaceutic ally acceptable salts thereof, processes for preparing them, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy. A further object is to provide active compounds which are potent ligands for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR's).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of compounds which bind nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the treatment of a range of disorders involving reduced cholinergic function such as Alzheimer's disease, cognitive or attention disorders, anxiety, depression, smoking cessation, neuroprotection, schizophrenia, analgesia, Tourette's syndrome, and Parkinson's disease has been discussed in McDonald et al. (1995) "Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors: Molecular Biology, Chemistry and Pharmacology", Chapter 5 in Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, vol. , 30, pp. 41-50, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA; and in Williams et al. (1994) "Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors," Drug News &amp; Perspectives, vol. 7, pp. 205-223.<br>
US Patent 5,468,875 discloses N-alkylcarbamic acid l-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-3-yl esters which are centrally active muscarinic agents useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders.<br>
N-(2-alkoxyphenyl)carbamic acid l-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-yl esters are disclosed in Pharmazie, vol. 48, 465-466 (1993) along with their local anesthetic activity. N-phenylcarbamic acid l-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-yl esters substituted at the ortho position on the phenyl ring are described as local anaesthetics in Acta Pharm. Suecica, 7, 239-246 (1970).<br><br><br>
Furopyridines useful in controlling synaptic transmission are disclosed in WO 97/05139.<br>

Pharmacology<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds of the invention may be measured in the<br>
tests set out below:<br>
Test A - Assay for affinity at α7 nAChR subtype<br>
125I-α-Bungarotoxin (BTX) binding to rat hippocampal membranes. Rat hippocampi were homogenized in 20 volumes of cold homogenization buffer (HB: concentrations of constituents (mM): tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane 50; MgCl2 1; NaCl 120; KCI 5: pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 g, the supernatant was saved and the pellet re-extracted. The pooled supernatants were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 12000 g, washed, and resuspended in HB. Membranes (30-80 µg) were incubated with 5 nM [125I]α-BTX, 1 mg/mL BSA (bovine serum albumin), test drug, and either 2 mM CaCl2 or 0.5 mM EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethylether)] for 2 hours at 21°C, and then filtered and washed 4 times over Whatman glass fibre filters (thickness C) using a Brandel cell harvester. Pretreating the filters for 3 hours with 1% (BSA/0.01% PEI (polyethyleneimine) in water was critical for low filter blanks (0.07% of total counts per<br>
minute). Nonspecific binding was described by 100 µM (-)-nicotine, and specific binding was typically 75%.<br>
Test B - Assay for affinity to the α4 nAChR subtype<br>
[3H]-(-)-nicotine binding. Using a procedure modified from Martino-Barrows and Kellar (Mol Pharm (1987) 31:169-174), rat brain (cortex and hippocampus) was homogenized as in the [125I]α-BTX binding assay, centrifuged for 20 minutes at 12,000 x g, washed twice, and then resuspended in HB containing 100 µM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. After 20 minutes at 4°C, membranes (approximately 0.5 mg) were incubated with 3 nM [3H]-(-)-nicotine, test drug, 1 µM atropine, and either 2 mM CaCl2 or 0.5 mM EGTA for 1 hour at 4°C, and then filtered over Whatman glass fibre filters (thickness C) (pretreated for 1 hour with 0.5% PEI) using a Brandel cell harvester. Nonspecific binding was described by 100 µM carbachol, and specific binding was typically 84%.<br>
Binding data analysis for Tests A and B<br>
IC5o values and pseudo Hill coefficients (nH) were calculated using the non-linear curve fitting program ALLFIT (DeLean A, Munson P J and Rodbard D (1977) Am. J. Physiol., 235:E97-E102). Saturation curves were fitted to a one site model, using the non-linear regression program ENZFITTER (Leatherbarrow, R.J. (1987)), yielding KD values of 1.67 and 1.70 nM for the 125I-α-BTX and [3H]-(-)-nicotine ligands respectively. Ki values were estimated using the general Cheng-Prusoff equation:<br>
Ki-[IC50]/((2+([ligand]/[KD])n)1/n-l)<br>
where a value of n=l was used whenever nH1.5. Samples were assayed in triplicate and were typically±5%. Ki values were determined using 6 or more drug concentrations. The compounds of the invention are compounds with binding affinities (Ki) of less than 1000 nM in either Test A or Test B, indicating that they are expected to have useful therapeutic activity.<br>
The compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be less toxic, be more efficacious, be longer acting, have a broader range of activity, be more potent, produce fewer side effects, are more easily absorbed or have other useful pharmacological properties.<br>

Example 7<br>
Spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3.2'(3'H)-furo[2.3-b]isoquinoline] The borane protected chloride of Example 6 (0.3g or 0.96 mmol) was suspended in a mixture of glacial acetic acid (6.0 ml) and water (0.5 ml). The suspension was placed under nitrogen and zinc dust (150mg) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70°C for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool and was then poured into saturated NaHCO3. Enough aqueous NaHCO3 was added to give a basic pH, and the products were extracted with three portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extract was dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated in vacuo. Two runs were combined for purification on a<br>
silica flash column, using a gradient from 2:1 hexane /ethyl acetate to 100% ethyl acetate. The faster eluting compound was spiro[l-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,2'(3'H)-furo[2,3-b]isoquinoline] N-borane complex and the slower eluting compound was the title compound. Yield 100%: chemical ionization MS 279 [MH]+-H2 for the N-borane complex and 267 [MH]+ for the title compound. Removal of the borane group under the conditions of Example 1 followed by flash chromatography gave the title compound as a brown semi-solid: chemical ionization MS 267 [MH]+.<br>
