In the recent times there has been a tremendous interest in the microwave mediated<br>
organic synthesis. He main advantages are, a shorter reaction time, cleaner reaction,<br>
better yields, eat* of workup after reaction, reduction in thermal degradation, better<br>
selectivity and environment friendly conditions (Abramovrtch, R.A., Tetrahedron Lett., 32.<br>
1991,5271. Bose, A.K.; Manhas, M.S.; Ghosh, M.: Shah, M.; Raju, V.S.; Ban, S.S.: Newaz,<br>

Lett., 37, 19i6, 6989. Verma. R.S.; Dahiya, R.; Saini R.K., Tetrahedron Lett., 38,<br>
1997, 7029.). The reactions can be carried out from a few milligrams to 500 grams<br>
quantities in a simple household micowaye oven (Banik, B.K.; Manhas, M.S.: Kaulza Z.;<br>
Barakat K.J.; Bose A.K., Tetrahedron Lett,, 33, 1992, 3603.). Microwave ovens can range<br>
from simple house hold muttimode ovens to large scale batch as well as continuous<br>
rTHitemode ovens, in batch closed reactor, veaaeh or turntables having a capacity to contain<br>
a number of reaction vessels have been applied. Specifically in<br>
fopd industry large-scale (continuous rtiode) ovens are used frequently Galema.<br>
S.A , Chem. Sac. Rev., 26, 1997. Staruss, C.R.; Tramor, R.W., Aust. J. Cram., 48.<br>
1995, 1665). Thus it is possible to scale up the reactions to industrial scale.<br>
The first generation dthydropyridmes are one possessing identical ester functions at<br>
position 3 and 5 in the dihydropyridine ring. The second gener=tion of<br>
dihydropyrtdine (DHP) development candidates have greater potency and are all<br>
chiral owing to non-identical ester functions (Meyer, H; Bossert, F.; Wehiger, E.;<br>
Stoepel, K; Vater, W., Arzneim.-ForschJDrug Res., 30, 1981, 407.) and can exist in<br>
enantiomeric forms differing in absolute configration at C-4 (Towart, R.; Wehinger,<br>
E.; Meyer, H.; Schmiedbergs, N., Arch. Pharmacol., 317,1981, 183.). Felocipine (1)<br>
is one of these DHP candidates, which have non-identical ester function and is<br>
characterized by pronounced peripheral vasodilation, so it appears to be particularly<br>
intsresting for therapy of hypertension (Ek, B.; Ahnoft, M.; Norlander, H.H.; Jung,<br>
BiL., Arch. Pharmacol., 313, 1980, Supl. R37.).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Another DHP which has non-identical ester functionalities is nivaldipine (2; .vnich is<br>
also substituted at the position-2 by cyano group in place of customary metryl group<br>
(Jully, S.R.; Hardmann, H.F.; Gross, G.H., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 217 1981,<br>
20.). Nitrendipine (3) another 1.4-dihydropyridine derivative with mixe: ester<br>
functionalities is being marketed as antihypertensive drug which has longer curation<br>
of action than nifedipine (4). A marked therapeutic response is obta ned on<br>
administration of nitrendipine (3) in hypertensive patients with corona-/ artey<br>
diseases who respond inadequately to p-blockers (Scriabine, A.; Vanov, S. Deek,<br>
K. Eds., Nitrendipine, Urban &amp; Schwartzenberg, Tokyo, 1983.).<br>

Nimodipine (5) due to its dilative action on spasm of cerebral vessels, has also<br>
become a drug of choice in patients with subarchanoid hemorrhage (Betz. E. Deek,<br>
K.; Hoffmeister, F. Eds., Nimodipine, Pharmacological and Clinical Properjes, F.K.<br>
Sctwttener Verlag, Stutgart, New York, 1985.). Moreover, nimodipine cresses the<br>
blood brain barrier and elicits some direct psyhotropic activity. It also dnates the<br>
cerbral vessels to a greater extent (Baldwin, J.J.; Hirschmann, R.; Engekhsrdt, E.L.;<br>
Pintieello, G.S.; Sweet, C.S.; Scribine, A, J. Med. Chem., 24, 1981, 628.).<br>

Nisoldipine i.e. Bay k 5552 (6) is one of the most potent blockers r voltage<br>
dependent Ca2* channels and is characterized by its predominating effec:s on the<br>
coronary and peripheral blood vessels (Kazda, S.; Garthoff, B.; Rams:n, K.D.;<br>
Schluter, G.. New Drugs of annual, Cardiovascular Drugs 1, A. Scribane E: Raven<br>

Amtodipine (7) another DHP with non-identical ester functionalites and a basic side<br>
chain at position 2 is a long acting dihydropyridine with a half life of 30 hrs ;n dogs.<br>
The bulk of the activity resides in (-) isomer of (7) which has shown extensive<br>
potential as antihypertensive and antianginal drug (Arrowsmith, J.E., Campbell<br>
S.F.; Croat, PE Stubbs, J.K.; Surges, R.A.; Gardiner, D.G.; Blackburn. K.J., J.<br>
1. Chem., 29, 1986, 1696, Alker, D.; Campbell, S.F.; Cross, P.E.. J. Med.<br>
7,, 34,1991,19.).<br>
Structural modifications among dihydropyridines continue to be concentrated on the<br>
ester and aryl substituents with the aim of discovering examples having sicw onset<br>
and long duration of action. Results with FRC-8653 (8) are encouraging. In<br>
spontaneous hypertensive rats, this compound exhibits an antihypertensr-e effect<br>
with slow onset and a longer duration of action (lida, H.; Fujiyoshi, T.; Iksda, K.;<br>
Hosoro, M.; Yanura, M.; Kase, N.; Sekive, A.; Uematsu, T., Japan. J. Phs'macol.,<br>
43, 1987,296.).<br>
CfiH6 "5,<br>
Similar long lasting effects were also observed in dogs with B844-39 (9) (Fisner, G.<br>
Krumple, G.; Mayer, N.: Schneider, W.; Raberger, G.J.. Cardiovasc. Fha'macol.<br>
10, 1987,268.).<br>
More extensive structural modifications of ester moiety are found in R018-3017 (10)<br>
(HoHk, M.; Osterrieder, W., Br. J. Pharmac., 91, 1987, 61.).<br>
H3C<br>
(12)<br>
Another compound PN 200-110 (12) is more potent than (11) due to mixed ester<br>
functionalities (Hof, R.P.; Schweinitzer, M.E.; Neumann, P., Br. J. Pharmacol., 73,<br>
1981,196.)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
FRC-8411 (13) shows good hypotensive and antianginal activites (Yamaura, T.:<br>
Kase, N.; Kita. H.; Uematsu, T., Arzeneim.-Forsch./Drug Res., 36, 1SS5. 29.).<br>
Compound YM - 09730 (14) shows greatest coronary vasodilating activity<br>
(Tamnzawa, K.; Arima, H.; Kojima, T.; Tsotnura, Y.; Okeda, M.; Fujita, S.; Furuya, T.;<br>
Takeneda. T.; Inagaski, 0.; Terai, M., J. Med. Chem., 29, 1986, 2504.).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compounds (15) and (16) have been reported to have activity similar to felodipine<br>
(1) which has been shown to be 1000 folds more potent than nifedipine (4) (Ohno,<br>
Si; tdmatsu, 0.; Miznokoshi, K.; Jahihara, K.; Nakamura, Y.; Marighima, I.; Sumuta,<br>
fc, J. Pharm. Dyn., 7,1984, 5).<br>
(17)<br>
Nigulidipine (17) developed orginally as a long acting calcium channel blocker. also<br>
increases the opening probability of Ca2+ activated K* channels and may be example<br>
of a compound acting in opposite fashion on two distinct ion channels (Robertson.<br>
D.W.; Steinberg, M.I., J. Med. Chem., 33, 1990, 1).<br>

Some new dihydropyridines. benidipine (18), manidipine (19), CV-159 (2(T and P-<br>
0285 (21), have been found to be more potent and have specific vascular effects<br>
than prototypes in the class of compounds related to nifedipine (4). They have been<br>
reported to have slow onset and long duration of action in animals without<br>
cardiodepressant effect which is characteristic of other dihydropyridines.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
CHjCOOCONH,<br>
, Compounds like NB-818 (22), are more potent and have longer duration of action in<br>
vivo than agents like nifedipine (4). Compound (23) has been reported to increase<br>
cerebral QQrtH*Wood flow and improves memory in certain models (Naurse, T.,<br>
Kiozymi, Y., Japan. J. Pharmacol., 4S(Suppl.), 1988, 75. Nichikibe, A.; Nakajuma,<br>
A,, Life Sciences, 43,1988,1715.).<br>
From the study of the literature we reach at the conclusion that a number of methods<br>
have been reported for the preparation of 1,4-dihydropyridines which involve the<br>
condensation of various substituted aldehydes with methylacetoacetate or<br>
ethylacetoacetate in the presence of ammonia by using methanol or ethanol as the<br>
solvent. So Up no attempt has been made to provide dean, safe, time-saving,<br>
enwrafMnnt tritMty and an inexpensive method for the preparation of 1,4-<br>
dihvdropyrioines. This method can only be provided if the reaction is carried out<br>
under the influence of microwave irradiations. There is only one method in the<br>
literature for the preparation of 1,4-dihydropyridines with the help of microwave<br>
irradiations where the ammonia, alkylacetoacetate and aldehyde with ethanol as<br>
solvent have been used for the preparation of 1,4-dihydropyridines (Alajarin, R.;<br>
Viquero, J.J.; Garcia, Navio, J.L; Alavarez-Builla, J., Synlett., 1992, 297.). In the<br>
literature no method is available where the preparation of 1,4-dihydropyridines have<br>
been carried out under dry conditions on a solid support. The methods vÂ»tiere the<br>
solvents such as ethanol or methanol are used for the preparation of various<br>
compounds under the influence of microwave irradiations suffer from one or the<br>
other drawbacks such as inflammability due to switching on and off of the magnetron<br>
of microwave oven to control the power out put. There is no method in literature<br>
where 4-aryl-2,6-dimethyl-3-carboethoxy-5-carbomethoxy-1,4-dihydropyridine have<br>
been prepared in a single step.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide the safe, clean, devoid of<br>
solvent, time-saving, high yield, inexpensive, environment friendly, one pot synthetic<br>
process for the preparation of 4-aryl-2,6-dimethyl-3-carboethoxy-5-carbomethoxy-<br>
1,4-dihydropyridines. Another objective of the invention is to develop new analogues<br>
felodipine, which could act as potent cardiovascular agents and can become the<br>
drugs of future.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides 4-aryl-2,6 dimethyl-3-carboethoxy-5-<br>
carbomethoxy-1,4-dihydropyridines useful as therapeutic agents.<br>

3. To the above mixture add basic adsorbents like potassium carbonate, calcium<br>
carbonate, aluminium oxide or magnesium oxide in small increments with<br>
thorough mixing so as tc adsorb whole of the above mixture on it till the<br>
adrafeMnt becomM free flowing.<br>
4. Tranatar the adsorbent intc a conical flask much larger in capacity as compared<br>
to the volume of the adsorcent. Place a funnel on the flask as condenser.<br>
5. Place the flask in the microwave oven cavity. Also place another flask<br>
containing ice (as heat sir.x) with a funnel as condenser in the microwave cavity<br>
along with the reaction flas
reactants is less, if sufficsnt quantity of reactants is there to adsoro all the<br>
microwaves then heat sink s not required).<br>
6. Subject the reaction vesse. :o microwave irradiations (MWI) at 250W to 400W for<br>
30sec to 10 minutes. Allow tie reaction vessel to cool to room temperature.<br>
7. Extract the compound w?r adequate quantity of haioalkane after srakmg it<br>

coloured crystals of 4-{2-actoxy-3-methoxypnenyl)-2.6-dimetnyi-3-carDoe:noxy-5-<br>
carbomethoxy-1,4,-dihydropyridines (m.p.162Â°C ) in 85% yield.<br>
Example iii<br>
One mmoie of 2-acetoxy-3-methoxyDenaidenyde was taken in a mortar and to it<br>
added a premixed mixture of methyl acetoacetate(1.1 mmoies) ars ethyi<br>
acetoacetate(i.1 mmoies).. The two were mixed tnoroughiy with the neip of :estie in<br>
a mortar. Ammonium acetate(1.2 mmoies) was added to above reaction mixrjre and<br>
then triturated the mixture with the help of pestie. To the above mixture a;uminum<br>
oxide was added in small increments with thorough mixing tiii the mixture cecame<br>
free flowing. Transferred the mixture to a conical flask much larger in capacity as<br>
compared to the volume of the adsorbent. Placed a glass funnel on the -"asK as<br>
 condenser. I he reaction mixture was subjected to microwave irradiation at 300VV for<br>
nine minutes in a microwave oven placing a heat sinK aiongwitn it. Aiiowed the<br>
reaction mixture to cooi to tne room temperature. Extracted the compound with<br>
3xÂ§Qmf portions of dJetiloromethane after stirring it thoroughly with adsorbent.<br>
Filtered the organic extract through the bunchner funnel on a filter paper. Washed<br>
the organic layer with 2x100mi portidns of water. Dried the organic layer over<br>
anhydrous sodium sulphate. Filtered the extract and removed the solvent by<br>
distillation under vacuum to give the residue which was recrystaiised in methanoi to<br>
give yellow coloured crystals of 4-(2-actoxy-3-methoxyphenyi)-2,6-dimethyi-3-<br>
carboethoxy-5-carbomethoxy-1,4,-dihydropyridines (m.p.162Â°C ) in 85% yield.<br>
The acetoxy compound was subjected to hydrolysis by stirring one mole of<br>
compound with 1.1 mole of ammonium hydoxide soiution in methanoi for one hour at<br>
3Q-35Â°C on a magnetic sftrrer and then removing the solvent under vacuum. The<br>
resulting compound was recrystaiiised in petroleum ether to give 4-(2-hydroxy-3-<br>
methoxyphenyi)-2,6-dimethyi-3-carboethoxy-5-carbomethoxy-1,4,-dihydropyridines<br>
(m. p. 170*0) in 75% yield.<br>
Advantages<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1. A process for the preparation of 4-aryi-2,6-dimethyi-3-carboetnoxy-5-<br>
carbomethoxy-1.4-dihydropyridines as racemates (DHP compounds) where the<br>
reaction times are reduced i.e. from 16 hours to 10 minutes.<br>
2. A process for the preparation of DHP compounds where the reaction yields are<br>
improved (50-60%).<br>
3. A process for tne preparation of DHP compounds wnere tne minimum use of<br>
solvents is required as solvents are required for extraction ana recrystaiiisation<br>
only.<br>
4. A process for tne preparation of DHP compounds where there are no fire<br>
nazaro as no solvents are used in the reaction.<br>
5. A process for the preparation of DHP compounds whjch may be useful in future<br>
as antiangmal and nypotensive agents.<br>
3.* A process for the preparation of the DHP compounds which may be useful as<br>
new test models in the development of agents which could be used as drugs in<br>
the future for the management of various cardiovascular ailments.<br>
7. The entire process of synthesis is environment friendly.<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. 4-aryl-2,6 dimethyl-3-carboethoxy-5-carbomethoxy-l,4-dihydropyridines useful<br>
as therapeutic agents<br>
wherein RI is H, N02, Cl, OAc, OH, R2 is H, NO2, CL,-O-CH2-O-Ome, OAc,<br>
