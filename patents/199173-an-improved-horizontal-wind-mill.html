'AN IMPROVED HORIZONTAL WINDMILL'<br>
Field of Invention :<br>
This invention relates to Windmills, especially applicable to a windmill which comprises one or more horizontal fan or fans revolving horizontally in a vertical shaft; where the horizontal fan does not contain any folding type blades or wings.<br>
Background of the invention :<br>
Windmills and Wind turbines, which are functioning with fans horizontally with plurality of blades or wings, where the blades are secured to a hub and the said hub rotates along with the vertical shaft is the prior art of the invention. Conventionally, the fan of the Windmills of vertical type start to perform revolution by the force of wind by spinning methodology. The wind, which dashes the fan blades and passes through the gaps of the blades drives the blades to spin in a particular direction. The blades are shapely constructed in such a way, so that the fan tends to rotate in a particular direction. The principle or methodology involved in horizontal windmill is quiet different. In horizontal windmill, the wind which has the hydrodynamic force impinges the blades and makes them pushing onwards straightly or propelling the blades to move ahead suddenly. This method is clearly known as pushing.<br>
The prior art is also using of folding blades in horizontal windmills. A horizontal windmill, where the folding blade method adopted and used,   also<br><br>
functions by the same pushing methodology. In this method, the blades have to open and close automatically while in the course of its revolution.<br>
The folding blade system adopted in the horizontal windmill has many critics. In the course of each and every revolution, the said type blades have to open and close very quickly in every semi-circular revolution. Also, the open and close process should function absolutely without missing in each and every revolution. It will cause damages quickly, in addition to probable breakage, in the folding blade parts and also will require frequent mechanical aid and fault attending.<br>
And hence, there is a need for a horizontal windmill which should perform revolution constantly, continuously and consistantly without using folding blades as it's parts or wings. Object of the invention :<br>
The object of this invention is, therefore, to establish a horizontal windmill which should perform revolution constantly, continuously and consistantly without requiring any mechanical supervison farely over a long period. Also, it should perform revolution even in case of the wind speed is minimum threshold. It can be done by making adequate improvements and modifications in the construction of the windmill blades and in other components of the windmill, which are only applicable to horizontal windmills.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
According to this invention, the improved horizontal windmill comprises a strong structure known as tower, which is made either of steel or other metal erected on the earth where a small bed is mounted on the top, and where the windmill blades are secured in a hub horizontally and the hub contains plurality of 'V shapely constructed or moulded blades known as the horizontal fan,<br><br>
where both the sides of the said ' V blades may be equal or unequal but to show like the symbols '&gt;' or '
 <br>
to revolve fastly because of high wind force, and such a fast revolution is essentially required for any known device to be fitted either on the top or at the bottom of the tower, and as such, instead of using the component namely 'Wind Piercer', the component namely 'Wind Blocker' can also be used to get a speedy revolution of the horizontal fan, where the said 'Wind Blocker' is constructed of steel or any other metal and which is located in such a manner to revolve around the top and bottom of the round frames of the tower freely with the help of bearing support, and which comprises of three parts namely, 'Tail', 'Blocker' and the 'Piercer' respectively, and as such, the part 'Tail' is constructed as the shape of a rectangle and mounted steeply at the reverse of the 'Nose' and which is made to revolve freely around the top and bottom frames of the tower with ball bearing support, so as to direct the nose to face the blowing wind straightly, and as such, the part namely 'Blocker' is permanently constructed in one side of the 'Wind Blocker' as the shape of a rectangle so as to prevent the wind from being dashed on the horizontal wing in that side, and as such, the part namely 'Piercer' is fabricated in the other side of the 'Wind Blocker' as the shape of a rectangle to form a 'nose' so as to pierce the blowing wind and allowing it to impinge the same on the 'V portion of the blade and makes the said fan to revolve fastly because of the high wind force and as such, the 'Piercer' has been fabricated in such a manner so as to have a forward and backward movement before the horizontal fan with the help of a thread shaft connected with a hydraulic disc brake, and the said disc brake is connected with the gears of the vertical shaft, by a shaft, located at the top, and as such, the said brake starts to work when the revolution of the vertical shaft exceeds the limit as set in the said disc brake and thereby controlling as well as regulating the revolution of the horizontal fan in tune with the velocity of the blowing wind, and as such, the said brake starts to pull one portion of the 'nose', that is,<br><br>
the 'piercer' before the horizontal fan automatically when the revolution of the said fan increases beyond the desired level as set in the mechanism of the said brake, and conversely starts to push the 'piercer' before the said fan with the help of the spring provided in the said disc brake or with the help of hydraulic pump provided when the revolution of the said fan decreases below the expected minimum and, alternatively, the revolution of the horizontal fan has also been automatically regulated and controlled with the help of a motor which performs rotation both in clock wise and anti-clock wise directions in accordance and tune with the revolution of the vertical shaft as required, which is essentially required at the bottom of the vertical shaft to be fitted with a known device.<br>

Detailed description of the invention with reference to drawings:<br>
As per this improved horizontal windmill(l), the strong steel tower(2)has been erected strongly on the earth and a small bed(3)is mounted on its top. A horizontal fan(4)which contains three or more blades, each blade is fitted with a arm(5)which is horizontally secured in a hub(6)and the said hub is mounted on the top of the vertical shaft(7).The vertical shaft(7)is located in the centre of the bed(3)which is freely rotatable with the help of ball bearings(8).The horizontal fan blades(ll)are constructed as the shape of ' V in its width and which are arranged in the hub to show like the symbols *&gt;' or *
The blowing wind dashes in the inner portion(10)of the 'V blades in one side and pushes them onwards to take a revolution, while in the other side, the outer portion of the 'V blade pierces the wind and at the same time take revolution, because, the wind force acting on the inner portion of the 'V blade(l l)in one side is more stronger than the wind force acting upon the outer portion because of the sharp knife(12)like back portion of the wing.<br>
Thus, the horizontal fan will rotate continuously without any hindrances, irrespective of the direction from which the wind blows.<br><br>
In this windmill, a component is used which is namely known as 'Wind Piercer'(13).It is located under the horizontal fan. It has a common steel frame(14)where one side of the frame comprises a part namely 'nose'(15)which is shapely constructed as a rightangle with a inclined surface(16)and the other side is constructed as the shape of a rectangle namely known as tail(17).The 'wind piercer' is located under the horizontal fan to perform rotation freely, independently and automatically around the tower(2)with the help of ball bearings mounted at the centre of the bed and made rotatable on a circular steel frame(18).The circular steel frame is strongly mounted at the required place of the tower(2).<br>
The structure of the nose is constructed as just like a rightangle having a rim on both sides and extended and fabricated in the longitudinal side but covered partly by steel or any other material. The right bottom of the nose(15)is constructed like the symbol'&gt;', which is intended for piercing the wind where the left bottom of the nose is seated on the circular steel frame(18).The diagonal of the nose(15)is partly covered by any sheet metal( 19),which provides a inclined surface(16)for the wind to pass to the top.<br>
The tail(17)is constructed as the shape of rectangle and which comprises of a rectangular rim fully covered by sheet metal(20)or any other material and attached straightly and steeply at the back side of the nose by a common steel frame( 14).Since one part of the nose is hollow(32),the wind which passes through it dashes on the side of the tail(17)and turns it straightly in tune with its direction while the nose automatically tends to face the blowing wind straightly. Thus, the wind piercer(13)supports to a speedy revolution of the horizontal fan.<br>
Instead of using the component 'wind piercer' the component 'wind blocker'(23 )may also be used to get a fast revolution of the horizontal fan. Where the wind blocker is constructed of steel or any other metal and which is<br><br>
located in such a manner to revolve freely around the top and bottom frames(24),(25)of the tower with the help of ball bearing support.The *wind blocker'comprises of three parts namely/tair,(17)'blocker'(26)and the Tiercer'(33)respectively. The tail is constructed as the shape of a rectangle comprising a rectangular rim fully covered by sheet metal or other material and mounted at the reverse of the nose(27)and which is made to freely revolve around the top and bottom frames(25) of the tower with ball bearing supports. It always directs the nose to face the blowing wind. The 'blocker'(26)is fabricated in one side of the 'wind blocker' as the shape of a rectangle which comprises of a rectangular rim and extended and fabricated in the longitudinal side and fiilly covered by steel or any other metal and connected with the tail by a steel frame(31)supportably so as to prevent the wind from being dashed on the opposite wing of the horizontal fan.The portion'nose' is as the shape of 'V which is constructed by joining the 'blocker' and the 'piercer'so as to pierce the blowing wind and allowing it to pass in side ways. As such, the one portion of the 'nose' that is, the 'blocker'(26)has been permanently fabricated with the 'wind blocker' and the other portion of the nose ,that is, the 'piercer'(33) is fabricated in such a manner so as to have a forward and backward movement before the horizontal fan with the help of a thread shaft(28)connected with a hydraulic disc brake(29) in one end and connected with gears(30)of the vertical shaft by a shaft(35)in the other end. The hydraulic brake will start to work when the revolution of the vertical shaft exceeds the limit as set in the disc brake. When the revolution of the vertical shaft exceeds beyond the set limit, the said brake will pull one portion of the nose, that is, the piercer before the horizontal fan and as such, the moving nose portion will tend to block the surface area where the wind impinges the interior portion of the 'V blades. This will reduce the revolution of the horizontal fan automatically. When the<br><br>
revolution of the horizontal fan tends to be low, the hydraulic disc brake will slowly release the shoe where the brake shoe is located in side the disc. This will result in releasing the the 'piercer', as such, the piercer will move forward automatically with the help of spring(34) or hydraulic pump(36) as may be used. Where, alternatively, a motor(37)is used instead of hydraulic disc brake to control and regulate the piercer movements forward and backward in front of the horizontal fan, then the said spring(34)or the said hydraulic pump(36) is need not be used. In this way the 'piercer' will perform its function continuously.<br>
The vertical shaft(7)may be attached with a dynamo(21)or a pump(22)for generation of electricity or pumping water from a bore-well.<br>
This improved horizontal windmill does not require wind speed sensor. Also, the tower height may be reduced or increased depending upon the height of wind velocity. More than one horizontal fan can also be mounted and used in the vertical shaft.<br>
If the tower height is high, it is possible to fix more horizontal fans one by one to comprise many stages over the vertical shaft<br><br><br><br><br>
