				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a multi gigahertz high capacity digital radio frequency (RF)<br>
link transceiver terminal device, and method for same. The field of application for the present<br>
invention may generally be labelled "high capacity microwave radio", and more specifically<br>
such kind of microwave radio link solutions that offer very high quality, very high reliability,<br>
point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication with capacities beyond 8Mb/s wireless<br>
communication at microwave frequencies. In the context of the present invention, microwave<br>
frequencies are understood to include the range 3GHz to 100GHz.<br>
The field of interest is in particular described in terms of the variability and complexity of the<br>
possible installations, ranging from single channel solutions without interaction with other<br>
radios to more complex installations requiring access to more than one receive signal for<br>
successful operation. Application like MIMO systems (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) and<br>
future interference mitigation solutions are considered to be of relevance to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Known solutions and problems with these<br>
High capacity radio systems serve a variety of communication needs, and the great range of<br>
potential applications makes it natural to explain this invention in the light of technology and<br>
logistics, reflecting the kind of problem it aims to solve. The traditional applications are<br>
described by Freeman, Roger L., "Radio System Design for Telecommunications", Second<br>
Edition (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1997), giving an introduction to the application<br>
background for the invention.<br>
 Norwegian patent application no 20034776, filed 24. Oct. 2003<br><br>
When making radio systems for trunk and mobile backhaul point-to point communication, it<br>
turns out that the conventional arrangement/device of the functional units does not allow<br>
exploitation of technology advances for efficient radio transmitters. Point-to point high<br>
capacity radios operate at high frequencies, traditionally requiring line-of sight between the<br>
two antennas. The antennas often have to be placed in towers or other inconvenient locations<br>
with respect to access and maintenance. It is often highly desirable to have the transmit power<br>
amplifier as close to the antenna as possible in order to avoid power loss. For the same reason<br>
it is desirable to have the receive low noise amplifier close to the antenna.<br>
The split of radio installations into an outdoor unit and an indoor unit is natural. The outdoor<br>
unit should be robust and as simple as possible, and if one can afford the losses by separating<br>
the antenna from the transmit power amplifier and the receiver low noise amplifier, we may<br>
find that only the antenna belongs to the outdoor unit For solutions in a product portfolio<br>
where this is not always the case, it has become common to designate all functional units that<br>
may need to be located outdoors in some installations as outdoor functions. As we only need<br>
to have channel frequency specific hardware in the outdoor functions, it has become common<br>
practice to class all channel frequency dependant hardware as outdoor functions, assuming<br>
communication with functions in the indoor unit at one or more fixed frequencies. The<br>
importance of this interface solution is shown by the fact that the outdoor unit actually<br>
includes the functional units on the antenna side of the abovementioned fixed frequency<br>
interface, regardless of whether these functional units are placed indoors or outdoors,<br>
meaning that what is typically referred to as the outdoor unit can in fact be distributed as, for<br>
example, an outdoor antenna and an indoor transceiver. Likewise would all functional units<br>
separated from the antenna by the abovementioned fixed frequency interface belong to the<br>
indoor unit.<br>
This fixed, typically intermediate frequency interface between the outdoor unit and the indoor<br>
unit enables a standardization that makes the indoor unit hardware frequency independent.<br>
The implementation also is very effective. In the outdoor unit one only needs to shift the<br>
frequencies between the specific radio channels and the selected intermediate frequencies.<br><br>
The modulator and the demodulator of the indoor unit are not more costly due to the extra<br>
frequency conversion. Adding management messages and power supply to the same cable<br>
effectively completes a general interface allowing very flexible product arrangements<br>
devices.<br>
An illustration of this basic arrangement/device is provided in figure 1, giving the opportunity<br>
to define some terminology useful for the following descriptions. At the far right, an antenna<br>
is indicated in location A, closely connected to a frequency separation solution, marked D.<br>
The frequency separation solution can be a diplexer or more complex branching<br>
arrangements/devices. The signal prepared for wireless transmission, C2, and the received<br>
signal, C3, from the antenna are identified here. To the left of the frequency separation<br>
solution (D), we find two functional units, numbered 2 and 3, and collectively labeled M2 as<br>
an abbreviation for "module 2", often named a transceiver.<br>
Functional unit 2 performs frequency translation and amplification of the transmit signal,<br>
while functional unit 3 performs low-noise amplification and frequency translation of the<br>
receive signal. The outdoor unit hence contains the units labeled A, D and M2. The functional<br>
units 2 and 3 are kept together in a common module because they represent units that are<br>
most likely to need service in the outdoor unit, and efforts have been made to ease<br>
replacement service by non-specialists. Depending on product, M2 and D may be integrated<br>
as well.<br>
The module M1 is 'part of the indoor unit of the radio system, containing the modulator unit 1<br>
and the demodulator unit 4 for the specific radio. The interface towards the outdoor unit is as<br>
described above. We identify the transmit signal, C5, and the received signal, C6, both having<br>
chosen,fixed frequencies. A cable based connection, covering distances from 1 to 300 meters<br>
between M1 and M2 provides an effective communication solution. Input digital data for<br>
wireless transmission, labeled C1, are received in the modulator unit 1. Output digital data,<br>
demodulated from the received signal, are provided from the demodulator 4, at the interface<br>
labeled C4.<br><br>
There is significant cost associated with the generation of the transmit signal with required<br>
quality. Recent developments, such as what is disclosed in Norwegian patent application no<br>
20034776, filed by the present applicant on 24. Oct. 2003, have created further potential for<br>
improvement in the transmit chain, having an important impact on system cost, output power,<br>
linearity and efficiency of the power amplifier. To take full advantage of these advancements,<br>
the modulator unit 1 and the circuits at channel frequency, including the power amplifier,must<br>
work in close cooperation, which in turn requires physical proximity. Known arrangements/<br>
devices (radio architectures) are not capable of taking full advantage of such solutions due to<br>
the physical distances that traditionally separate the indoor unit from the outdoor unit, which<br>
may be as large as up to 300 meters. Until now, the skilled person in the art has chosen the<br>
obvious solution to this problem, namely to move both modulator and demodulator to the<br>
outdoor unit, thereby eliminating the interfaces at C5 and C6. Thus, by communication of the<br>
input data and the output data at C1 and C4, respectively, directly to the outdoor unit, as<br>
known from in present day technology, a straightforward solution is available. This<br>
straightforward solution, however, does not address the thereby incurred problems of<br>
maintainability and other important operational aspects, which all tend to add cost and other<br>
design considerations in order to meet the stringent performance requirements that typically<br>
are presented by radio link operators.<br>
Furthermore, in installations with more than one radio channel, quality and availability<br>
requirements, in conjunction with the desire to utilize the spectrum as efficiently as possible,<br>
often require the demodulators to cooperate. One example of this is the use of two, or even<br>
more, polarizations in a radio link. Briefly, the antennas are arranged to excite and receive<br>
signals at, for example, orthogonal polarizations, thereby multiplying the spectrum utilization.<br>
However, in the case of orthogonal polarization, perfect orthogonality is a rare event, and<br>
there is need for interference mitigation in order to arrive at the expected performance. If a<br>
demodulator receives the signal from both polarizations, it is possible to solve this task. The<br>
traditional solution to this is illustrated in figure 2, being characterized by the need to<br>
exchange the received signal between the two demodulators. This transfer of received signals<br><br>
is labeled C7. Other arrangements/devices exist, requiring similar transfers of signals, giving<br>
cross connections similar to what is shown in figure 3. One or more antennas may be used.<br>
The essential feature is that some of the demodulators need access to the receive signals from<br>
one or more other receivers.<br>
If the demodulators are placed in respective outdoor units for such system arrangements/<br>
devices, then cross-links between the demodulators outdoors must to be provided. It is clear<br>
that such an arrangement/device will incur significant costs.<br>
To date, the industry has tried to improve the transmit chain cost and performance for<br>
complex radio installations without taking advantage of the potential associated with close<br>
connection between the modulator and channel frequency dependant hardware, including the<br>
power amplifier. The inventors of the present invention do not know of any previously known<br>
solution to this challenge of the type disclosed herein.<br>
Brief description and objects of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, it is proposed to separate the modulator and demodulator<br>
units, whereby it becomes possible to take advantage of benefits in the transmit chain while<br>
maintaining the advantages of having an indoor demodulator. The idea of such a separation<br>
results in some complications to be overcome. The choice to do so and the measures taken to<br>
overcome the associated obstacles are material to the invention.<br>
The major benefits become apparent when a complete product portfolio is to be created that<br>
supports a variety system solutions that range from from single channel radios with just one<br>
transmitter and one receiver to complex systems that for performing one or more<br>
demodulation tasks require access to more than one of the received radio signals. The typical<br>
solution of optimised hardware for the different configurations is not a viable alternative, as<br>
customers often want flexibility and options for further expansion, and because the average<br>
number of installations per configuration typically is limited.<br><br>
In order to arrive at a solution that enables a common hardware platform to support all<br>
configurations of interest in a cost effective manner, it is an important choice not to integrate<br>
the frequency separating unit with the module M2, as seen in figure 4 and figure 5, where the<br>
transmit and receive signals are simply labelled C2 and C3. This enables assembly of simple,<br>
diplexer based, installations using the same modules as those employed in more complex<br>
solutions that are based on branching.<br>
A further object of the invention is to take advantage of a common mechanical solution. Such<br>
a solution must cope with all product configurations, including variants with high output<br>
power that may have demanding thermal requirements. Exploitation of the integrated<br>
transmit chain and the solution disclosed in Norwegian patent application no 20034776, filed<br>
24. Oct. 2003, to obtain maximum power efficiency by means of e.g. dynamic biasing<br>
schemes in installations requiring high output power, eases the thermal requirements<br>
significantly. In the context of the present invention, this new technology further enhances the<br>
enablement of one common mechanical solution for a complete product range that does not<br>
add what previously has been considered unacceptable cost.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a multi gigahertz digital radio frequency (RF)<br>

providing a respective one of said intermediate frequency digital RF receive signal. The<br>

receiving at least one of said respective one of said intermediate frequency digital RF receive<br><br>

Detailed description and exemplary embodiments of the invention<br>
The novel arrangement/device, having the modulator in the outdoor unit and the demodulator<br>
in the indoor unit, as shown in figure 4 and figure 5, is a prominent characteristic of the<br>
present invention. By this arrangement/device, the present invention teaches against the bias<br>
of prior art solutions which define the interface traditionally used between the indoor unit and<br>
the outdoor unit to be the only way for obtaining an efficient and attractive solution in the<br>
field of the present invention.<br>
A new interface introduced between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit would represent an<br>
additional complexity, with cost implications. Therefore, the present invention represents and<br>
identifies a solution that adds little enough cost to make the change very attractive.<br>
Furthermore, the actual interface solution that is chosen for the invention can be embodied in<br>
a number of different ways, as any interface solution that is appropriate for bringing the<br>
transmit data to the outdoor unit and the receive signal to the indoor unit within acceptable<br>
cost is considered part of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A first example of an interface for an employment of the invention lies in the introduction of a<br>
cable modem to transfer transmit data from the indoor unit to the outdoor unit, essentially<br>
enabling the same physical solutions for connecting the indoor unit with the outdoor unit. In<br>
the indoor unit, a new functional unit, labeled 0, is added, which modulates the digital data CI<br><br>
to create a cable transmit signal C5 for transfer to the outdoor unit. In the outdoor unit, the<br>
functional unit I is extended, due to the fact that demodulation has to be performed for<br>
restoring the digital data fed into the modulator, which, according to the invention is placed in<br>
close interaction with the microwave transmitter. Thus, to obtain a separation of the<br>
demodulator from the modulator in this solution, an extra cable modem has been added.<br>
By a further development of the interface solution, management communication is integrated<br>
into the modem solution for transmit data, simplifying multiplexing tasks and making<br>
previous management communication solutions obsolete.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention where the capacity of the cable modem allows<br>
transmission of a digitized version of the receive signal, is yet another attractive solution, as<br>
the need for frequency separation on the medium between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit<br>
is completely removed.<br>
Some variants of the present invention are illustrated by the accompanying, starting with the<br>
fact that the novel architecture enables the offering of a complete range of radio<br>
configurations based on the same hardware elements when technical specifications, such as<br>
frequency and output power, are kept the same. This gives major benefits in terms of<br>
development effort, logistics cost and overall manufacturing cost.<br>
The placement of the demodulator indoors enables the configuration flexibility for both<br>
simple and complex systems.<br>
Figure 6 shows a simple system solution embodiment, which embodiment by itself is not at a<br>
cost optimum. However, it offers to the customer the option to make a low-entry cost<br>
investment-with a high degree of freedom for reuse in a future expansion of the link.<br>
Figure 7 shows a more complex system embodiment, where a further radio is added to<br>
provide hardware redundancy. The freedom to reconfigure the hardware resources is high.<br><br>
Figure 8 shows an embodiment of the invention with a space diversity receiver radio<br>
arrangement/device. This is the first of several configurations disclosed here where the indoor<br>
placement of the demodulator proves important. The basic benefit of such a system is<br>
mitigation of selective (multipath) fading by using two antennas.<br>
In a traditional approach, the functional blocks in the transmit direction can be removed from<br>
one of the radios, including the transmission solution from M1 to M2. If a full radio is<br>
installed in both radios, it is possible to have full hardware redundancy as well, and even<br>
envision the extension to a MIMO system.<br>
Figure 9 is a schematic drawing that shows an example of a significantly more complex<br>
system embodiment of the present invention, that utilizes a common antenna for simultaneous<br>
communication at N radio channels, with one radio as a redundant hardware element. In this<br>
example, it is essential not to have the diplexer integrated with unit M2 (transceiver).<br>
Figure 10 is a schematic drawing that shows an example of an XPIC installation (cross<br>
polarization interference cancellation solution). In this example, the exchange of receive<br>
signals is used to its full extent. This solution has very high value, as it doubles the capacity<br>
within the same frequency slot.<br>
Figure 11 is a schematic drawing that shows an installation that combines Space Diversity<br>
and XPIC. It shows a system with extended use of the capability to transfer receive signals to<br>
other radios. The opportunity to be able to combine information from several receive signals<br>
is essential to meet performance requirements presented by demanding customers.<br>
For all of the exemplary radio installations illustrated by way of the figures 6 through 11, and<br>
as otherwise disclosed herein, variations for coping with conditions calling for high power<br>
variants of the transmitters in order to cope with longer hops, difficult climate etc. are<br>
contemplated. Such variants are likely to be more costly, due to, for example, the fact that the<br><br>
power amplifier would require the use of components that provide enhanced performance.<br>
Furthermore, it is realized by the present inventors that, if there also is a need for different<br>
mechanics, such as, for example, to cope with heat removal, the cost for the product portfolio<br>
may rise by another order of magnitude. For this reason it is extremely important to base new<br>
link terminals on the novel architecture of the present invention, in order to take advantage of<br>
the option for enhanced efficiency offered by the integrated modulator and transmitter in this<br>
new architecture.<br>
For providing efficient demodulation, and to minimise demodulation errors, the demodulators<br>
of a multi gigahertz RF terminal according to the invention is provided with an interlace for<br>
exchanging demodulation processing data related to demodulation of an intermediate RF<br>
signal being input to the modulator. The exchange of demodulation processing data can be<br>
arranged to be made in one direction from a first demodulator to a second modulator included<br>
in the same indoor unit (IDU), or as a bidirectional exchange of demodulation processing<br>
data. In case more than two demodulators are included in the same IDU, or in co-located<br>
IDUs, all of which IDUs being arranged to provide the same signal, a demodulator in one of<br>
said IDUs may be provided with an interlace for sending to, or receiving from, a plurality of<br>
said demodulators the demodulation processing data. The digital demodulator will employ<br>
appropriately designed demodulation processing, designed to take into account the<br>
information received from other demodulators to obtain the best possible demodulation result<br>
Having described preferred embodiments of multi gigahertz high capacity digital radio<br>
