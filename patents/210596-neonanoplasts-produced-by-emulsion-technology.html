NEONANOPLASTS AND MlCROEMUISION TECHNOLOGY FOR INKS<br>
AND INK JET PRINTING<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to colorant compositions containing neonanoplasts. The colorant compositions exhibit improved color brightness and brilliance due to the incorporation of one or more colorants in the neonanoplasts. The colorant compositions may be printed onto virtually any substrate. The colorant compositions of the present invention have particular utility in the area of printed textiles.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A major problem with colorants is that they tend to fade when exposed to electromagnetic radiation such as sunlight or artificial light and the like. It is believed that most of the fading of colorants when exposed to light is due to photodegradation mechanisms. These degradation mechanisms include oxidation or reduction of the colorants depending upon the environmental conditions in which the colorant is placed. Fading of a colorant also depends upon the substrate upon which they reside.<br>
Product analysis of stable photoproducts and intermediates has revealed several important modes of photodecomposition. These include electron ejection from the colorant, reaction with ground-state or excited singlet state oxygen, cleavage of the central carbon-phenyl ring bonds to form amino substituted benzophenones, such as triphenylmethane dyes, reduction to form the colorless leuco dyes and electron or hydrogen atom abstraction to form radical intermediates.<br><br>
Various factors such as temperature, humidity, gaseous reactants, including O2, O3, SO2, and NO2, and water soluble,<br>
nonvolatile photodegradation products have been shown to influence fading of colorants. The factors that effect colorant fading appear to exhibit a certain amount of interdependence. It is due to this complex behavior that observations for the fading of a particular colorant on a particular substrate cannot be applied to colorants and substrates in general.<br>
Under conditions of constant temperature it has been observed that an increase in the relative humidity of the atmosphere increases the fading of a colorant for a variety of colorant-substrate systems (e.g., McLaren, K., /. Soc. Dyers Colour, 1956, 72, 527). For example, as the relative humidity of the atmosphere increases, a fiber may swell because the moisture content of the fiber increases. This aids diffusion of gaseous reactants through the substrate structure.<br>
The ability of a light source to cause photochemical change in a colorant is also dependent upon the spectral distribution of the light source, in particular the proportion of radiation of wavelengths most effective in causing a change in the colorant and the quantum yield of colorant degradation as a function of wavelength. On the basis of photochemical principles, it would be expected that light of higher energy (short wavelengths) would be more effective at causing fading than light of lower energy (long wavelengths). Studies have revealed that this is not always the case. Over 100 colorants of different classes were studied and found that generally the most unstable were faded more efficiently by visible light while those of higher lightfastness were degraded mainly by ultraviolet light (McLaren, K., J. Soc. Dyers Colour, 1956, 72, 86).<br>
The influence of a substrate on colorant stability can be extremely important. Colorant fading may be retarded or promoted by a chemical group within the substrate. Such a group can be a ground-state species or an excited-state species. The porosity of the substrate is also an important factor in colorant stability. A high porosity can promote fading of a colorant by facilitating penetration of moisture and gaseous reactants into the substrate. A substrate may also act as a protective agent by screening the colorant from light of wavelengths capable of causing degradation.<br>
The purity of the substrate is also an important consideration whenever   the   photochemistry   of   dyed   technical   polymers   is<br><br>
considered.   For example, technical-grade cotton, viscose rayon,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyisoprene are known to contain<br>
carbonyl  group   impurities.     These  impurities  absorb  light  of -<br>
wavelengths greater than 300 nm, which are present in sunlight, and<br>
so, excitation of these impurities may lead to reactive species capable<br>
of causing colorant fading (van Beek, H.C.A., Col. Res. AppL, 1983,<br>
8(3), 176).<br>
Mother  nature protects naturally-occurring colorants from<br>
one or more of the above-described photodegradation mechanisms<br>
by surrounding the naturally-occurring colorants with a cell wall. The cell wall prevents destructive materials, such as O2 gas, from<br>
reaching the colorant. The result is a colorant which maintains its brilliance, brightness and beauty even when exposed to sunlight day after day.<br>
What is needed in the art is a colorant system which provides protection to a colorant in much the same way that nature protects colorants. There exists a need for methods and compositions which are capable of stabilizing a wide variety of colorants, regardless of the stability of the colorant, from the effects of both sunlight and artificial light.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention addresses the needs described above by providing compositions and methods for stabilizing colorants against radiation including radiation in the visible wavelength range. The present invention provides a system for shielding a colorant from destructive forces, such as oxidants and reductants. By providing a protective shield for the colorant, very unstable colorful dyes may be used in a wide variety of printing applications which were believed to be impossible applications due to rapid degradation of the dye.<br>
The present invention is directed to neonanoplasts formed by microemulsion technology. The neonanoplasts contain one or more colorants and optionally colorant stabilizers. The neonanoplasts comprise a polymeric membrane which prevents degradable materials from reaching the colorant. The neonanoplasts may be incorporated into a variety of liquid mediums to form colorant compositions.<br><br>
The present invention is further directed to a method of stabilizing a colorant by encapsulating the colorant in a polymeric membrane, forming a neonanoplast. In one embodiment of the' present invention, one or more colorant stabilizers are also encapsulated in the polymeric membrane, creating multiple levels of colorant protection from photodegradable mechanisms.<br>
The present invention is also directed to colorant compositions containing the above-described neonanoplasts. The colorant compositions may be applied to any substrate to impart a color to the substrate. In one embodiment of the present invention, a colorant composition comprising neonanoplasts, a liquid medium and a pre-polymer is coated onto a substrate and subsequently exposed to radiation to fix the neonanoplast to the substrate via the polymerization of the pre-polymer.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, neonanoplasts are present in a polymer coating of a heat transfer product, such as is used for transferring graphic images onto clothing.<br>
The neonanoplasts are particularly effective in ink jet inks. Use of the neonanoplasts, as described herein, intensifies the colors and stabilizes the colorants when exposed to light and other potentially degrading conditions. Additionally, the neonanoplasts are particularly effective in coatings for paper products and textiles.<br>
These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and the appended claims.<br>

The aqueous solution is added to the non-aqueous solution while stirring to form a mixture. To the mixture is added an initiator to polymerize the one or more monomers of the aqueous phase. As the polymerization reaction proceeds, the colorant of the aqueous phase is encapsulated by the polymerizing monomer to form microemulsion spheres within the non-aqueous phase. The nonaqueous phase is removed to yield an aqueous phase containing the neonanoplasts. In order to remove the surfactant from the aqueous phase, dialysis bags or some other separation means are used to separate the surfactant from the aqueous phase containing the neonanoplasts. Water is then removed to yield neonanoplasts. The resulting neonanoplasts may have an average particle size of less than about 1000 nm. Desirably, the neonanoplasts have an average particle size of less than about 500 nm. More desirably, the neonanoplasts have an average particle size of less than about 100 nm.<br>

incorporating one or more colorant stabilizers into the aqueous<br>
solution described above, colorant stabilizers may be encapsulated<br>
within the neonanoplasts along with the colorant. Suitable colorant<br>
stabilizers for use in the present invention include, but are not limited<br>
to, colorant stabilizers disclosed in U.S. Patent Applications<br>
08/627,693 filed March 29,1996 and 08/788,863 filed January 23,1997,<br>
as well as, U.S. Patents Nos. 5,782,963; 5,855,655; and 5,891,229; all<br>
of which are assigned to Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc., the<br>
enririty of which is incorporated herein by reference.	In	a<br>
further  embodiment  of  the  present invention,  suitable colorant<br><br>
stabilizers include, but are not limited to, a porphine, a metal, a metal   salt,   a   molecular   includant  or   a   combination   thereof.<br>
*<br>
Particularly suitable porphines include, but are not limited  to, porphines having the following structure:<br><br>
wherein R is any proton-donating moiety and M is iron, cobalt or copper. Desirably, R is SO3H,<br><br>
RlCOOH wherein Ri is an alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbons, or the<br>
corresponding salt thereof.<br>
Desirably, the colorant stabilizer is represented by one or more porphines such as Cu-meso-tetra-(4-sulfanatophenyl)-porphine (designated CuTPPS4) and Cu-meso-tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphine (designated CuTMPS4), having the following structure:<br><br><br><br>
In the above-described porphines, the copper ion can also be substituted with an iron or cobalt ion. It is also understood that in the case of FeTPPS4, CuTPPS4 or CoTPPS4, the sulfuric acid moieties may be substituted with salts when in solution, such as sodium salts. The colorant maybe stabilized with about 0.1% to 10% wt/wt porphine, more preferably about 0.3% to 1% wt/wt porphine, and more preferably about 0.5% wt/wt porphine based on the total weight of the colorant containing solution.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the neonanoplasts contain a colorant and a colorant stabilizer in the form of a metal or metal salt, such as a lanthanide or lanthanide salt. Desirably, the amount of metal or metal salt in the colorant solution is from about 0.01% to 10% wt/wt metal, more desirably about 0.03% to 1% wt/wt metal, and more desirably about 0.05% wt/wt metal. Although lanthanides and lanthanide salts are desired metals, other metals, may also be used such as magnesium, iron, zinc, and other transition metals. To improve the solubility of the metai or metal salt in solution, metal solubility-enhancing agents may be added. Particularly useful metal solubility-enhancing agents include, but are not limited to, chelating agents, including, but not limited to, EDTA (emylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(fi-aminoethyl ether)).<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the neonanoplasts comprise a colorant in combination with a porphine and a lanthanide, such as europium.    Desirably,  the amount of<br><br>
porphine in the colorant solution is from about 0.1% to 10% wt/wt porphine, more desirably about 0.3% to 1% wt/wt porphine, and more desirably about 0.5% wt/wt porphine. Desirably, the amount of lanthanide in the colorant solution is from about 0.01% to 10% wt/wt lanthanide, more desirably about 0.03% to 1% wt/wt lanthanide, and more desirably about 0.05% wt/wt lanthanide. Although europium and europium salts are desired lanthanides, other lanthanides, may also be used.<br>
Although not wanting to be limited by the following hypothesis, it is theorized that, in addition to the protection provided by the polymeric membrane of the neonanoplasts, the above colorant stabilizing compounds act by quenching the excited state of a dye molecule within the neonanoplast by efficiently returning it to a ground state. This reduces the likelihood of an oxidative or other chemical reaction occurring which would render the dye chromophore colorless.<br>
The quenching process can occur by a number of processes. One such process is referred to as the heavy atom effect (internal or external) in which atoms with a high atomic number, such as iodine, xenon and lanthanides, can effect the excited electronic transitions of the dye molecule by allowing here to fore forbidden electronic transitions to occur and by decreasing the excited state lifetimes. This effect permits the rapid return of the dye to its ground state.<br>
Another quenching process involves back electron transfer. In this case, quenching of the excited dye molecule occurs through sequential electron transfer. The additive or quencher, and dye form an ion pair through electron donation within which back electron transfer leads to an overall deactivation of the excited energy donor, i.e., the dye.<br>
Another quenching process involves a condition in which the quencher (additive) molecule has an excited energy state lower than the excited dye. In this case, it may be possible to transfer the excited energy to the quencher thereby allowing the dye molecule to return to its ground state. These mechanisms are more fully discussed in Chemistry and Light, Suppan, P., Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry, 1994, pgs 65 - 69 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, the colorant and/or colorant stabilizer within the neonanoplast is associated with<br><br>
a molecular inciudant. The term "associated" in its broadest sense means that the colorant and/or colorant stabilizer is at least in close proximity to the molecular inciudant. For example, the colorant and/or colorant stabilizer may be maintained in close proximity to the molecular inciudant by hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or the like. Alternatively, the colorant and/or colorant stabilizer may be covalently bonded to the molecular inciudant, although this normally is neither desired nor necessary. As a further example, the colorant and/or colorant stabilizer may be at least partially included within the cavity of the molecular inciudant.<br>
The molecular inciudant can be inorganic or organic in nature. In certain embodiments, the chemical structure of the molecular inciudant is adapted to form a molecular inclusion complex. Examples of molecular includants are, by way of illustration only, clathrates or intercalates, zeolites, and cyclodextrins. Examples of cyclodextrins include, but are not limited to, a-cyclodextrin, b-cyclodextrin, g-cyclodextrin, d-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl b-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl a cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl a cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl b cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl g cyclodextrin, octyl succinated a cyclodextrin, octyl succinated b cyclodextrin, octyl succinated g cyclodextrin and sulfated b cyclodextrin and sulfated g-cyclodextrin (Cerestar U.S.A., Incorporated, Hammond, Indiana).<br>
The term "derivatized cyclodextrin" as used herein means a cyclodextrin having more than two leaving groups covalently coupled to each molecule of cyclodextrin. The term "leaving group" is used herein to mean any leaving group capable of participating in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. Examples of derivatized cyclodextrin includes, but is not limited to, hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl b-cyclodextrin, hydroxyethyl a cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl a cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl b cyclodextrin, carboxymethyl g cyclodextrin, octyl succinated a cyclodextrin, octyl succinated b cyclodextrin, octyl succinated g cyclodextrin and sulfated b and g-cyclodextrin. A desired derivatized cyclodextrin is ethylhydroxy b-cyclodextrin.<br>
A desired molecular inciudant is g-cyclodextrin. Another desirable molecular inciudant is b-cyclodextrin. In other embodiments, the molecular inciudant is an ethyl hydroxy b-cyclodextrin.   Although not wanting to be bound by the following<br><br>
hypothesis, it is believed that the molecular includant inhibits the<br>
aggregation of the colorant molecule in solution. Other aggregation<br>
inhibitors that can be used in practicing the present invention are -<br>
starches, pectins, amyloses, clathrates and the crown ethers. It is to<br>
be understood that the addition of derivatized cyclodextrins to a<br>
neonanoplast-forming   solution   for   the    purpose    of   inhibiting<br>
aggregation  and/or stabilizing the dyes in the neonanoplast is<br>
considered one aspect of the present invention.<br>
In addition to the colorant, optional colorant stabilizer, and<br>
optional molecular includant, the neonanoplasts  of the present<br>
invention also may contain additional components, depending upon<br>
the application for which it is intended, as long as the additional<br>
component does not negatively effect the dye molecule. Examples of<br>
such additional components include, but are not limited to, charge<br>
carriers;    stabilizers    against    thermal    oxidation;     viscoelastic<br>
properties   modifiers;   cross-linking   agents;   plasticizers;   charge<br>
control additives such as a quaternary ammonium salt; flow control<br>
additives such as hydrophobic silica, zinc stearate, calcium stearate,<br>
lithium  stearate,   polyvinylstearate,   and   polyethylene  powders;<br>
fillers such as calcium carbonate, clay and talc; surfactants; chelating<br>
agents; and TINUVIN® compounds; among other additives used by<br>
those having ordinary skill in the art.    Charge carriers are well<br>
known to those having ordinary skill in the art and typically are<br>
polymer-coated metal particles. Desirable surfactants include, but are not limited to, Cl2 to Ci8 surfactants such as cetyl trimethyl<br>
ammonium chloride and carboxymethylamylose. TINUVIN®<br>
compounds are a class of compounds produced by Ciba-Geigy<br>
Corporation, which includes benzophenones, benzotriazoles and<br>
hindered amines. Desirable TINUVIN® compounds include, but are<br>
not limited to, 2-(2,-hydroxy-3,-sec-butyl-5,-ferf-butylphenyl)-<br>
benzo-triazole,	poly-(N-fi-hydroxyethyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-<br>
hydroxy-piperidyl      succinate	and	2-(2'-hydroxy-3!,5'-<br>
diter£butylphenyl)-5-chloro-benzotriazole. The identities and amounts of such additional components in the colored composition are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Applications For The Neonanoplasts<br>
The present invention is also directed to colorant compositions containing   the    above-described    neonanoplasts.    The   colorant<br><br>
composition may comprise an aqueous or non-aqueous medium, although an aqueous medium is desirable. The colorant compositions of the present invention contain neonanoplasts, as well" as, any of the above-described colorant stabilizers and additives. For example, the colorant composition may contain the above-described neonanoplasts in combination with any of the following additives: a second colorant; a colorant stabilizer, such as a porphine; a molecular includant; a pre-polymer; and any additional components as described above. The present invention is particularly useful for inks to be used in ink jet printers. Inks used in ink jet printers are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,681,380, assigned to Kimberly Clark Worldwide, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The colorant compositions of the present invention may be applied to any substrate to impart a color to the substrate. The surface tension of the neonanoplasts may be controlled to enable monolayer coatings of neonanoplasts on a substrate surface.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the colorant composition comprises neonanoplasts, a liquid medium, a pre-polymer and a photoinitiator. The colorant composition is coated onto a substrate and subsequently exposed to radiation to photoaire the pre-polymer, fixing the neonanoplasts to the substrate via the polymerization of the pre-polymer. Suitable pre-polymers include, but are not limited to, acrylates, diacrylates, modified acrylates, triacrylates, pentaacrylates, methacrylates and cationic resins. Suitable photoinitiators include, but are not limited to, conventional photoinitiators, as well as, photoinitiators disclosed in U.S. No. 5,739,175; U.S. patent application no. 08/625,737; U.S. provisional patent application reference no. 11300-0420P, filed on May 07,1998; and U.S. provisional patent application reference no. 11300-0450P, filed on June 01,1998; all of which are assigned to Kimberly Clark Worldwide, Inc., the entire content of which is hereby incorporated<br>
by<br>
The substrates to which the neonanoplasts may be applied include, but are not limited to, paper, wood, a wood product or composite, woven fabric, nonwoven fabric, textile, plastic, glass, metal, or any other substrate that would benefit from having a neonanoplast thereon. Examples of suitable substrates are disclosed in parent U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/843,410, assigned to<br><br>
Kimberly Clark Worldwide, Inc., the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment of the present invention, neonanoplasts are applied to a textile article, such as clothing. A very thin coating having a thickness of about one neonanoplast may be applied to a textile surface and subsequently fixed to the surface using a pre-polymer as described above. The resulting textile has excellent hand and drapeability, as well as, brilliant, color due to the thin coating of neonanoplasts of the textile.<br>
In another further embodiment of the present invention, neonanoplasts are present in a carrier, the nature of which is well known to those having ordinary skill in the art. For many applications, the carrier will be a polymer, typically a thermosetting or thermoplastic polymer, with the latter being the more common. Examples of suitable thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers are disclosed in parent U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/843,410, assigned to Kimberly Clark Worldwide, Inc., the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference. One particularly suitable application is the incorporation of neonanoplasts into a polymer coating of a heat transfer product, such as is used for transferring graphic images onto clothing.<br>
The present invention is further described by the examples which follow. Such examples, however, are not to be construed as limiting in any way either the spirit or scope of the present invention. In the examples, all parts are parts by weight unless stated otherwise.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Magenta Neonanoplasts To a 500 ml round bottom flask with stirring bar was added 200 ml of hexane and 40 ml of Aerosol OT (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate; available from American Cyanamid). To this mixture was added 1.0 ml of an acrylamide (8 mg/ml) and N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) (2 mg/ml) solution in water. To this mixture was added 20 ul of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylene diamine (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). The mixture was stirred and flushed with argon gas to remove oxygen.<br>
In a separate container, an aqueous dye solution was prepared by adding 0.083 g of Rhodamine WT (Aldrich Chemical Company,<br><br>
Milwaukee, Wisconsin) to 10 ml of water and stirring for about 30 minutes. The aqueous dye mixture was then added to the reaction mixture and again flushed with argon gas for 1 hour. Then, 20 ul of a 80 mg/ml solution of ammonium persulfate was added to the flask. The reaction mixture was stirred under argon gas for 8 hours.<br>
The hexane was then removed under reduced pressure to yield a syrupy liquid. The syrupy liquid was placed in dialysis bags (SIGMA, 10,000 MW cut off) and subjected to continuous dialysis for 2 days to remove the surfactant and any unencapsulated dye. The bags were then opened and the water removed to yield neonanoplasts in the form of a light magenta powder.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Higher Concentrations of Magenta Neonanoplasts<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated using three different Rhodamine WT dye concentrations.<br><br>
As the dye concentration increased, the resulting neonanoplasts had a deeper magenta color. All of the resulting neonanoplasts were filtered through a 0.45 [i filter without leaving a precipitate.<br><br><br>
The resulting neonanoplasts in the form of a powder had a deep color. All of the resulting neonanoplasts were filtered through a 0.45 u filter without leaving a precipitate.<br>
