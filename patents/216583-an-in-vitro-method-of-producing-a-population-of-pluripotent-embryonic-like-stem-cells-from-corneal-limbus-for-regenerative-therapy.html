				<td>The present invention provides pluripotent corneal stem cells from limbal biopsies, cultured ex vivo, and isolated and purified by magnetic affinity cell sorting (MACS). These cells possess multilineage differentiation potential and self-renewing capability. They could be propagated in culture, where they continuously produce corneal epithelial cells and other cell lineages from ecotodermal origin, neurons, skin mesodermal origin; osteoblasts, chondrocytes, skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, endodermal origin, beta islet cells and hepatocytes, and endothelial cells. This data indicates that self-renewing multipotent stem cells persists in limbus of the cornea and that such cells can be induced to become cells of other organs of all lineages. The mutipotential capacity of these cells, their easy isolation and culture as well as their high ex vivo proliferation capacity makes these cells a promising therapeutic tool. Hence, these pluripotent stem cells may provide new insight into therapy of various degenerative diseases.</td>

orgn 240/mum/2004<br><br>

TITLE:<br>
Self-renewing Embryonic like Pluripotent Stem Cells From Corneal Limbus for use in regenerative therapy and method of producing the same.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to cell replacement therapy with stem cells. More specifically, the present invention relates to isolation of embryonic like pluripotent stem cells from corneal limbus tissuefor use in regenerative medicines. The present invention also describes a culture methodology of embryonic-like pluripotent stem cells isolated from limbal tissue and its differentiation into various committed lineages.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Stem cells are responsible for cellular replacement and tissue regeneration throughout life. Cellular development is accomplished through cellular proliferation; lineage commitment and lineage progression, resulting in the formation of differentiated cell types. This process begins with the embryonic stage when the cells are totipotent and continues through out adult life. As the development progress, the cells proliferate and form three main lineages. They are ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Ectoderm can form the epidermis of the skin, the sense organs, nervous system and spinal cord where as, mesoderm can form smooth muscle, connective tissues, blood vessels, heart, blood cells and bone marrow, reproductive organ, excretory system, striated muscles and skeletal muscles. On the other hand, endoderm can form epithelial linings of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, intestine and other associated organs.<br>
Majority of the cells progress throughout the developmental process differentiation, but a few cells leave this pathway to become reserve stem cells that provide for the continual<br>
2<br><br>
maintenance and repair of the organs. These reserve stem cells also include some progenitor stem cells and some pluripotent stem cells. Progenitor stem cells although have self-replicating capability but have limited life span and limited to particular lineages. On the contrary, pluripotent stem cells are uncommitted. They are self-renewal and can differentiate into several committed lineages.<br>
Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are pluripotent cell derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst that can be propagated indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are taken from the very early stages of embryo development and can give rise to all of the cells of the human body, except placenta and other supportive tissues in the womb. All human beings start their lives from a single cell, called the zygote , which is formed after fertilization. The zygote divides and forms two cells; each of those cells divides again, and so on. Pretty soon, about five days after conception, there is hollow ball of about 150 cells called the blastocyt .The blastocyst is smaller than a grain of sand and contains two types of cells, the trophoblast and the inner cell mass.JEmbryonic stem cells are the cells that make up the inner cell mass. As embryonic stem cells can form all cell types in an adult, they are referred to as pluripotent stem cells. ES cells differentiate into all cell lineages in vivo and differentiate into many cell types in vitro. ES cells have been isolated from humans (Thomson et al, 1998. Embryonic stem, cell lines derived from human blastocysts. Science 282: 1145-1147, Gearhart J, Science 282, 1061-62 (1998)]j.<br>
Adult stem cells are tissue specific stem cells and not pluripotent and are found in the tissues of a fully developed child or adult and can produce a limited number of cell types. Stem cells can also be found in very small numbers in various tissues in the adult body, including haemopoietic (Weissman IL. 2000. Translating stem and progenitor cell biology to the clinic: barrier and opportunity. Science 287:1442-1446), neural (Gage FH, 2000. Mammalian neural stem cells. Science 287, 1433-1438), gastrointestinal (Potten C. 1998. Stem cells in gastrointestinal epithelium: numbers, characteristics and death. Phil Trans R. Soc Lond B. 353:821-830), epidermal (Watt F. 1997. Epidermal stem cell: markers patterning and the control of stem cell fate. Phil Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B.<br>
3<br><br>
353:831), hepatic (Alison M and SarrafC. 1998. Hepatic stem cells. J. Hepatol 29:678-683), and mesenchymal stem cells (Pittenger et al, 1999. Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells. 284:143-147)., bone marrow stem cells that are found in the marrow of the bone and they give rise to all specialized blood cell types. Adult stem cells have not yet been identified in all vital organs. In some tissues like the brain, although stem cells exist, they are not very active, and thus do not readily respond to cell injury or damage. Scientists are now also exploring ways in which they can induce the stem cells already present to grow and make the right cell types to replace the damaged ones. Questions have been raised about the usefulness of adult stem cells in research and treatment, especially as compared to pluripotent stem cells derived from embryos or fetal tissue. Indeed, there is enormous potential for research using such cells. Human adult stem cells have been isolated from tissues such as blood, brain, intestine, skin, and muscle. Furthermore, some adult stem cells have been shown to be more "plastic" than first thought - that is, some of these stem cells appear to be capable of developing into different kinds of cells than first predicted.<br>
Some studies have suggested that adult stem cells are very versatile and can develop into many different cell types. However, other studies have concluded that adult stem cells are only able to develop into a limited number of cell types related to the tissue that the stem cells originally came from. Although a wealth of information on adult stem cells has already accumulated, scientists still do not understand their specific properties well. Research continues with the hope of one day being able to use these cells to restore or replace damaged tissues or organs.<br>
Compared with ES cells, tissue-specific stem cells as they normally are called as adult stem cells have less self-renewal ability and, although they differentiate into multiple lineages, they are not pluripotent.<br>
There is, however, considerable evidence that adult stem cells may have limited potential compared to pluripotent stem cells derived from embryos or fetal tissue. Human adult stem cells have not yet been isolated from all cell and tissue types, and they have not been shown to be capable of developing into all of the different cell and tissue types of<br>
4<br><br>
the body. Furthermore, adult stem cells are difficult to obtain, since they are often present in only minute quantities. They are difficult to isolate and purify, and their numbers appear to decrease with age. Moreover, adult stem cells may have more DNA damage, and they appear to have a shorter life span than pluripotent stem cells.<br>
Recently it has become clear that adult mammalian bone marrow contains not one but two ostensibly discrete population of adult stem cells. The first and by far the most fully characterized are the hematopoetic stem cells responsible for maintaining lifelong production of blood cells. The biological characteristics and properties of the second marrow resident population of stem cells, variously termed as bone marrow stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells are not well understood. However, they were found to have pluripotent properties. These new types of stem cells have been identified from few organs that have capability of self-renewal, are pluripotent and have multi-lineage differentiation potential. Recently, pluripotent cells have been isolated from adult bone marrow (Jiang et al., 2002. Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow. Nature. 418, 41-48), liver (Nakauchi et al., 2003 US patent application number 20030186439 ) and mouse inner ear (Li and Heller. 2003 Pluripotent stem cells form the adult mouse inner ear. Nat Med 9: 1293-1299), amniotic fluid (Prusa et al, 2003. Oct-4 expressing cells in human amniotic fluid: New source for stem cell research Human Reproduction 18: 1489-1493). Pluripotent stem cells have also been recently described in many tissues such as skeletal muscle, brain, intestinal epithelium (Howell et al, 2003. Pluripotent stem cells identified in multiple murine tissues. Ann. NY. Acd. Set 996:158-173.).<br>
While these prior art references report the various sources of pluripotent stem cells, none of these cells have shown the characteristics of embryonic like stem cells unlike the bresent invention. Also, these reports unlike the present invention show the pluripotent stem cells differentiate into few lineages. The scientists of the present invention have been successful in its mission of isolating a source of pluripotent embryonic like stem pell, that is safest, easiest and most efficient way of isolating them from corneal limbus<br>
5<br><br>
tissue. The present invention obviates the problems associated with the conventional sources of isolating the pluripotent stem cells.<br>
The scientists of the present invention have for the first time shown that corneal limbal tissue has also two discrete populations of adult stem cells. The first and by far the mosl fully characterized are the limbal stem cells responsible for maintaining corneal integrity and other has similar characteristics and properties embryonic-like pluripotent stem cells. This is one of the novel features of the present invention in addition to other novel {features of the invention which is discussed in the later portion of the specification.<br>
It is known that stem cells present in corneoscleral limbus has enormous capacity to participate in the dynamic equilibrium of the corneal surface and replace superficial epithelial cells that are shed and sloughed off during eye-blinking.<br>
The normal ocular surface is covered by cornea. Limbal and conjuctival epithelial cells , together with a stable pre-ocular tear film maintain its integrity. Severe damage to the limbal stem cells from chemical or thermal burns, the Steven-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatrical pemphigoid, contact lenses, severe microbial infection or multiple surgical procedures or cryotherapy in the limbal region, may lead to loss of the corneal and limbal epithelial cells. Disease that destroy limbal epithelial cells can lead to limbal stem cell deficiency and cause photophobia and reduced vision (Anderson DF, Ellies P, Pires RTF, Tseng SCG, 2001. Br J. Opthalmol. 85:567-575).<br>
The cornea is a transparent and avascular tissue and is located at the outer surface of the anterior eye. It provides protection from environmental insult, and allows for the efficient transmission of light into the eye. The cornea is comprised of two main compartments; the anterior non-cornified stratified squamous epithelial layer and the underlying substantia propria. The human cornea harbors three cell types; the corneal epithelial cells, the stromal keratocytes (corneal fibroblast) and underlying layer of stromal associated corneal endothelial cells.<br>
6<br><br>
Corneal epithelium is a cellular multiplayer, five to seven cells thick which covers the anterior surface of the cornea. It serves to protect the corneal interior from ingress by external agents, and supports the tear film via interactions with mucins on the front surface of the most superficial epithelial cells (Kinosita S, Adachi W, Sotozono C, Nishida K, Yokoi N, Quantock AJ, Okubo K (2001). Characteristics of the ocular surface epithelium. Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 20:639-673.). Ordinarily, a natural turnover of corneal epithelial cells takes place in which superficial epithelial cells are shed from the epithelial surface and replaced by those from below (Thoft RA, Friend J. (1983) The XYZ hypothesis of corneal epithelial maintenance. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci 24:1442-1443.). In turn, basal epithelial cells, migrating inward from the periphery, replenish the population of deeper corneal epithelial cells.<br>
The first pointer towards the existence of such slow-cycling cells in the corneal epithelium was provided in the 1980 (Schermer A, Galvin S, Sun TT (1986) Differentiation-related expression of a major 64 K corneal keratin in vivo and in culture suggests limbal location of corneal epithelial stem cells. J cell Biol. 103:49-62; Cotsarelis G, Cheng SZ, Dong G, Sun TT, Lavker RM (1989) Existence of slow-cycling limbal epithelial basal cells that can be preferentially stimulated to proliferate: implications on epithelial stem cells. Cell 57:201-209). Stem cell with their high proliferative capacity, are clearly crucial for maintenance of a viable ocular surface because they provide an unbroken supply of corneal epithelial cells with the appropriate phenotype (Tseng, 1996)., LiDQ., Comparison of protein kinase C subtype expression between normal and aniridic human ocular surfaces: implication for limbal stem cell dysfunction in aniridia. Cornea, March., 15(2):168-178. Chemical burn or other form of inflammatory eye disease may damage this supply process that result in abnormal corneal surface, which cannot normalize without the re-introduction of a source of stem cells (Tseng et al., 1999;). Reconstruction of the conjunctival and corneal surface. Transplantation of amoinitc membrane, Optha;mologe, Dec; 95(12):805-813,. Henderson TR et.al; Identifying the origin of single corneal cells by DNA finger printing :Part II- Application to limbal allografting. Cornea, May 20(4): 404-407<br>
8<br><br>
Earlier it was known that P-63 is a specific marker for human corneal stem cells. However, this marker also express in other epithelial cells such as skin. Therefore, there is no specific marker for corneal limbal stem cells. Although P-63 expression has been shown to be principally limited to basal limbal region in human corneas, contrary to this, in mouse expression of this transcription factor was both maximum in paracentral cornea rather than limbus (Moore et al., 2002) The corneal epithelial stem cell. DNA and Cell Biology, May., 21 (5-6): 443-451. Currently, there is no definitive stem cell marker for limbal epithelial stem cells exist. Therefore, further research and better stem cell markers are required to ascertain long-term survival of graft.<br>
In order to find out appropriate stem cell marker for limbal epithelial stem cells, we checked a panel of stem cell markers, during which, we identified a population of pluripotent stem cells in the limbal cultures on the amniotic membrane, the origin of which was traced and pluripotency of which was revealed. These cells behave similar to embryonic stem cells, due to their multipotential differentiation capacity. These cells have the ability to form embryoid like bodies (ELBs), and can differentiate into the three germ layers. Hence, we provide a novel method of producing diverse cell types, thus minimizing dependence on human embryonic stem cells. In the present invention, we have for the first time shown that corneal limbal tissue has another population of stem cells other than P-63 positive stem cells, they are not only pluripotent but have capability of self-renewal and can be differentiated into various lineages for use in regenerative therapy.<br>
These unique pluripotent characteristics make these stem cells very promising for supplying cells to treat debilitating diseases like Alzheimer"s disease, cancer, Parkinson"s disease, type-1 diabetes, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Today, donated organs and tissues are often used to replace those that are diseased or destroyed. Unfortunately, the number of people needing transplants far exceeds the number of organs available. Stem cells offer the potential for supplying cells and tissues, which can be used to treat these various diseases. This potential benefit is responsible for the huge amount of interest in stem cell research. The establishment of human pluripotent stem cell lines represents a major step forward in the understanding of human biology. These unique cells have captured the interest of<br>
9<br><br>
scientists and the public, particularly patients and their advocates. Although such research promises new treatments and, possibly even cures for many debilitating diseases and injuries, including Parkinson"s disease, diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, burns and spinal cord injuries, there are ethical issues related to this and the research need due consideration. Recently, human pluripotent stem cells have been isolated from two sources: the inner cell mass of human embryos at the blastocyst stage and from fetal tissue obtained from terminated pregnancies. Because these cells are capable of limitless division and self-renewal, they can be maintained indefinitely in tissue culture, making them a vital resource for research.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have targeted human corneal limbal tissue as an alternate source of pluripotent stem cells as opposed to other sources as known in the art. The advantage of targeting human corneal limbal tissue as an alternate source of pluripotent stem cells of the present invention is the following:<br>
1.	It is easy to obtain the cells from the corneal limbal tissue and requires minor surgery for obtaining the same.<br>
2.	It can be propagated up to  100 population doublings without loosing any sternness.<br>
3.	It can be differentiated into almost all the lineages of the tissue.<br>
4.	Autologous therapy is possible and therefore tissue graft rejection problem is eliminated.<br>
5.	It is non-embryonic and hence there are no such ethical issues.<br>
6.	Issue of nuclear cloning for therapeutic cloning is also eliminated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Other embodiment of the invention will be apparent from the description that follows:<br>
Definitions:<br>
As used herein the term "pluripotent embryonic like stem cells" refer to a cell that is not derived from inner cell mass of blastocyst stage embryo and are capable of self-regeneration and capable of differentiation to cells of all the three lineages such as ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. The pluripotent embryonic like stem cells in the present invention are lineage uncommitted means they are not committed to particular germ lineage such as ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.<br>
As used herein the term "limbal cells" are the cells from limbus of the eye. Limbus contain majority of the stem cells that help in natural turnover of corneal epithelial cells<br>
20<br><br>
in which superficial epithelial cells are shed from the epithelial surface and replaced by those from limbus.<br>
As used herein the term "Pluripotent cells" refer to a cells that have complete differential plasticity. That means the cells have a capacity to develop into any of the mammalian organ cells. A pluripotent cells can be self-renewing and can remain dormant or quiescent within the tissue.<br>
As used herein the term "embryoid like bodies" refer to an aggregation of differentiated or undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells surrounded by primitive endoderm generated in suspension culture. Embryoid like bodies contain cells of all three lineages that are ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Mouse embryonic stem cells have been studied for approximately 20 years. When mouse stem cells are placed in culture, they develop into "embryoid like bodies" containing cells characteristic of the three primitive layers of the embryo: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. In the embryo, each of these layers gives rise to a different set of tissues.<br>
About six years ago, primate (rhesus monkey) embryonic stem cells were isolated. These stem cells did not readily develop into mature embryoid like bodies, so it was uncertain how useful human stem cells would be. However the results have shown that human embryonic stem cells behave in culture like mouse embryonic stem cells. In mature human embryoid like bodies, it is possible to discern cells bearing markers of various cell types: neuronal cells, haematopoietic cells, liver cells, cardiac muscle cells. Some cells appearing in mature embryoid like bodies behave functionally like differentiated cells. For example, active cardiac muscle cells can cause an embryoid body to pulsate. The aim is thus to control embryonic stem cell differentiation so that we obtain the cell types we need to treat specific conditions. In the present invention, pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells also develop similar kind of embryoid like bodies as developed by human embryonic stem cells.<br>
21<br><br>
As used herein the term "differentiation" refers to as a process whereby undifferentiated embryonic stem cells acquire a state where cells are more specialized and has characteristics of special tissues. These special tissues show the expression of tissue specific proteins by using tissue specific antibodies.<br>
As used herein the term "growth factor" refers to as proteins that bind to receptors on the cell surface with the primary result of activating cellular proliferation and differentiation. Many growth factors are quite versatile, stimulating cellular division in numerous different cell types, while others are specific to particular cell types. In the present invention growth factors used are specific to pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells and its differentiation into various lineages such as neurons, hepatocytes, cardiomyocytes, beta-islet, chondocytes, osteoblast, myocytes and the like.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The scientists of the present invention have discovered the pluripotent embryonic like stem cells derived from limbus of the cornea. The present invention provides for the first time, the isolation of pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells from corneal epithelial limbal cells, capable of self-renewing and capable of differentiation into the cells of all the three lineages such as ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. To the knowledge of the scientist there has been no public report of such a source of pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells derived from corneal epithelial limbal cells, having the capacity of self-renewal and capable of differentiating into the cells of all the three lineages such as ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing a population of pluripotent embryonic like stem cells of non embryonic origin derived from adult human tissue.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, embryonic like stem cells are isolated from a limbal tissue. Approval of Institutional Ethics Committee has been sought before initiating the project. Consent of each donor has been taken. Small limbjjjbiopsy of 2-3<br>
22<br><br>
mm is removed surgically from superior or temporal quadrant of the corneal surface from donor" s_eye. The biopsy thus excised is then immediately put in 2 ml of transport medium in transport vial and transported to the main cGMP laboratory for the further processing. Limbal biopsy is washed several times preferably 4-5 times with the washing medium and put for enzymatic digestion. Here, enzymatic digestion is carried out by treatment with either dispase or trypsin-EDTA. Single cell suspension is achieved and then seeded on the tissue culture grade plastic_dish.<br>
Alternatively, the explants are subjected to dry incubation for 5 minutes on the biocoated tissue culture plate. The explants are placed in a circular fashion on the tissue culture dish with small drop (200 jul) of culture medium for 2hrs at room temperature, so that they stick to the bio-coated tissue culture surface. Next day, 2 ml of medium is gently added and incubated for 4-5 days at 37°C in C02 incubator with alternate day change of medium. The medium used for culture of limbal cells is DMEM:F-12 (1:1) supplemented with the growth factors. The growth factors used for the culture are selected from the group of EGF, basic FGF, LIF, insulin, sodium selenite, human transferrin, and human Leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) and the like or the combinations thereof.<br>

Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells isolated from the limbal cultured cells are viable. Limbal epithelial cells are sorted using stem cell surface markers such as stage specific embryonic antigen marker-4 (SSEA-4) using MACS yielding_about 40-70% of the pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells from the total cultured cells.<br>
In the preferred embodiments, SSEA-4 positive cells are then cultured on extra-cellular matrix coated petri dishes. The extra-cellular matrices are matrigel or fibronectin, laminin, Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and collagen IV or the like or the combinations thereof.<br>

EXAMPLES:<br>
The following example is intended to illustrate the invention but do not limit the scope thereof.<br>
In the following example, inventors of the present invention are able to show that pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells derived from limbus can differentiate into various lineages.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
COLLECTION OF LIMBAL BIOPSY:<br>
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained before initiation of the procedure. Informed consent was also obtained from each patients and donors, and all human subject were treated according to the Helsinki Accord. 2-3 mm of limbal biopsy of the donor eye is collected surgically from superior or temporal quadrants of the corneal surface by lamemmar keratectomy as these two loci are found to be rich in stem cells. Biopsy thus excised is then immediately put in the 2-ml transport vial having transport medium in it.<br>
31<br><br>
Limbal biopsy is taken from the donor"s healthy eye and transported to the laboratory in the transport medium that consists of Dulbecco"s modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) and Ham"s F-12 (DMEM:F-12; 1:1) and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 5% human serum collected from cord blood, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) 0.5%, recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) 2 ng/ml, insulin 5  transferrin 5 sodium selenite 5 hydrocortisone 0.5 ug/ml, cholera toxin A<br>
0.1 nmol/1, gentamycin 50 and amphotericin B 1.25 Blood sample from<br>
each donor is collected and transported along with limbal biopsy to centrally located cGMP facility. Blood sample is immediately sent for infectious disease diagnostic tests. Infectious diseases diagnostic tests includes, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Syphillis and CMV.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
PREPARATION OF EXTRA-CELLULAR MATRIX:<br>
In the present invention suitable extra-cellular carrier matrices such matrigel, human amniotic membrane, fibrinogen, PDGF, laminin, EGF, collagen V or human amniotic membrane was treated with attachment factors such as laminin, collagen V, PDGF, EGF, fibrinogen singly or in combinations and growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin singly or in combinations. However, extra-cellular matrix carrier is preferably matrigel.<br>
Preparation of Matrigel Coated Plates:<br>
To prepare Matrigel aliquots, Matrigel was slowly thawed at 4°C overnight to avoid the formation of gel. After complete thawing, 10 ml of cold knockout DMEM was added to the bottle containing 10 ml Matrigel. Mixture was then kept on ice and mixed well.Mixture was then aliquoted and stored in -20°C until use for coating the plates.<br><br>
For coating the plates, Matrigel aliquot was slowly thawed at 4°C for atleast 2 h to avoid the formation of a gel. Matrigel aliquot was diluted 1: 15 in cold knockout DMEM. 1 ml of Matrigel solution was then added to each plate to coat 35 mm or 60 mm plates. Plates were incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature or at least overnight at 4°C. Matrigel was removed before use, and the plates were washed with knockout DMEM and ready for seeding the cells.<br>
Preparation of Amniotic Membrane:<br>
In the present invention, human placental membrane is collected from elective cesarean operation and transported to the laboratory in the transport medium. The transport medium consists of Dulbecco"s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin 50 unit/ml, neomycin 100 and amphotericin B 2.5<br>
Hg/ml. Placental membrane is transported to the laboratory within 3 hours of surgery. Blood samples from each donor is collected and sent for infectious disease diagnostic test.<br>
Placenta is then washed with washing medium so as to remove the mucus and blood clots. Washing medium composed of Dulbecco"s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) is supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin 50 unit/ml, neomycin 100 and<br>
amphotericin B 2.5 Placental tissue is then cut off from the amniotic membrane<br>
using sterile scissors. Amniotic membrane is washed thoroughly at least 7 times to remove all the blood clots from it. Chorion is peeled off from the amniotic membrane with the blunt forceps. Epithelial side is then washed 5 times with the washing medium. Amniotic membrane is then stuck on to the sterile nitrocellulose membrane with epithelial side up. Mounted placenta on nitrocellulose membrane is cut in to 5 cm x 5 cm area and each of them are placed in a cryo-vials filled with the freezing medium. Freezing medium consists of 50% glycerol in DMEM. Entire batch of placenta is then stored at -80°C. Sterility, mycoplasma and endotoxin of each batch of processed placenta is checked before using it for limbal culture.<br>
33<br><br>
For culture of limbal cells, amniotic membrane is thawed at room temperature for 20 minutes. Amniotic membrane is then removed carefully from nitrocellulose membrane without tearing the surface with the help of blunt forceps. Amniotic membrane is then placed on sterile glass slide in a 100 mm petri plate. 1-1.5 ml of trypsin is then added to cover amniotic membrane and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Epithelial layer of the placenta is then scraped off with the help of cell scrapper under sterile aseptic conditions. Amniotic membrane is then washed 3 times with washing solution. In the present invention, processed and treated amniotic membrane that is used as a extra-cellular carrier matrix, is placed in the culture insert having 0.4 uM track-etched polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane. Processed human amniotic membrane is fastened to the cell culture insert membrane using either number 10 Ethilon non-absorbent suture. In the present invention, processed and treated amniotic membrane that is used as a extra¬cellular matrix, alternately is placed on the culture insert from outside after removing 0.4 uM track-etched polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane by surgical blade and fitted with medical grade silicon O ring so as to fasten the amniotic membrane to the cell culture insert.<br>
Amniotic membrane is spread in such a way that the denuded epithelial side faces the inner side of the insert and stromal side faces out of the insert. Amniotic membrane is streched uniformly and O-ring is then inserted from the bottom to hold the amniotic membrane securely. Alternately we can also suture the amniotic membrane to the basement membrane of the insert. Entire set-up in culture medium in a 6-well dish is then incubated for at least 2 hours. After 2-hours, entire culture medium is then removed and pre coated with laminin, fibrinogen or collagen TV alone or in combination. Amniotic membrane is then washed two times with culture medium and again incubated in culture medium for 30 minutes. Amniotic membrane is then ready for culturing limbal stem cells.<br>

EXAMPLE-3<br>
CULTURING AND CHARACTERISING LIMBAL CELLS:<br>
Location of Stem Cells:<br>
It has been observed that any tissue undergoing repairs have connective or stromal tissue compartment, and also has resident population of mesenchymal stem cells. Corneal limbus has essentially two types of cells and segregated into two zones and that is based on stem cell population. The top layer of limbus has corneal epithelial stem cells and at basal layer there is stromal cells. Top layer of the limbus are essentially corneal epithelial stem cells and are P-63 positive and basal layer is all stroma and has predominantly pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells. We have found such pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells for the first time in the limbus and they are predominant to the tune of 70%.<br>
Culturing of limbal tissue<br>
Limbal biopsies were washed several times with culture medium. Biopsies were then trimmed of any sclera and conjunctiva tissues and cut into 6-7 pieces. Entire limbal biopsy tissue pieces were then cultured on matrigel coated plates. Alternatively, biopsies were enzymatically treated. Enzymatic treatment were either given by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 30 minutes or by dispase overnight at 4°C. Epithelial layer was removed using blunt forceps and entire epithelial layer and stromal cells were cultured separately on Matrigel coated 35 mm plate in the culture medium. Single cell suspension of these cells is also used on several occasions without any compromising in culture quality. Culture medium consists of Dulbecco"s modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) and F-12 (DMEM:F-12; 1:1) and is supplemented with 10% knock out serum or 10% heat inactivated human serum collected from cord blood, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) 0.5%, recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) 2 ng/ml, insulin 5 ng/ml, transferrin 5 (ig/ml, sodium selenite 5 u-g/ml, hydrocortisone 0.5 [ig/ml, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 4 rig/ml, human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) 10 r|g/ml, gentamycin 50 ug/ml and<br>
35<br><br>
amphotericin B 1.25 ug/ml. Entire culture is carried out at 37 C in an atmosphere of 5% C02 in air for 7-21 days or till the cells get confluent. Medium is changed every alternate day.<br>
Characterization of limbal cells:<br>
The limbal cells were characterised by showing positive (green) immunofluoresence to SSEA -4 antibody as well as by Flow cytometry. Molecular characterizarion was done by RT-PCR analysis which shows positive signals for OCT-4, Nanog and Rex-1, which establishes the pluripotency of the limbal cells at this stage. (Fig 1)<br>
EXAMPLE-4<br>
ISOLATION OF PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS:<br>
After 7-21 days of limbal cell culture, the cells are subjected to magnetic affinity cell sorting (MACS). Cells are dispersed with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. The action of the trypsin is neutralized by adding an equal amount of culture medium that contained trypsin inhibitor or fetal calf serum. The cells are pipetted out into single cell suspension. Cells are counted using hemocytometer and resuspended per 107 cells in 200 JLXI of PBS. Cells are then cultured for 30 min. at 4°C with 1 .1 of primary antibody SSEA-4. The cells are washed twice to remove unbound antibody. 20 ul of secondary antibody beads is added to 200 jxl of cell suspension and mixed well and incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes. Cells are then washed three times with PBS so as to wash out unbound secondary antibody. Cell suspension is then passed through magnetic column (Meltiny). Negative fraction is collected first. Column is washed again twice with PBS. Column is then removed from the magnet and positive fraction is collected. Positive fraction of the cells are washed twice and seeded on extra-cellular matrix carrier in culture medium. Here extracellular matrix carrier is preferably matrigel coated plates. Here culture medium is Dulbecco"s modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) and F-12 (DMEM:F-Ti; 1:1) and supplemented with 10% knock out serum or 10% heat inactivated human.serum collected from cord blood,<br>
36<br><br>
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) 0.5%/recombinant human epidermal, growth-iactor (rhEGF) 2 ng/ml, insulin 5 ug/ml, transferrin 5 ug/ml, sodium selenite 5 ug/ml, gentamycin 50 ug/ml and amphotericin B 1.25 ug/ml, Leukemia inhibitory factor 10ng/ml and basic FGF 4rjg/ml. Cells are cultured for an additional one week at 37°C in C02 incubator until it gets confluent^.<br>
After getting confluent, the cells are dissociated and re-plated on fresh bio-coated tissue culture dishes at the rate of 1:3. The limbal cells are then expanded and serially passaged. The limbal cells are serially passaged up to 100 population doublings.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
ANALYSIS OF PLURIPOTENT EMBRYONIC-LIKE STEM CELLS:<br>
Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells derived from limbal tissue are characterized for its undifferentiated status. Stem cells are analyzed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and molecular analysis for different stem cell markers. Karyotyping and telomerase activity was also analyzed at various passages.<br>
Flow Cytometric Analysis:<br>
Very few surface markers related to pluripotent stem cells are known. We analyzed the cell surface cluster differentiation (CD) markers and stage specific embryonic antigen (SSEA) that is usually expressed on pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Analysis was carried out after every passage. We analyzed SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, CDllc, CD14, CD34, CD45, CD54, CD73, CD105, CD106, CD123, CD133, SCF, HLA-DR. by flow cytometry.<br>
Antibodies to stage specific embryonic antigen (SSEA) 1, 3, and 4 and cluster differentiation (CD) markers have been used in conjunction with flow cytometry. Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells were trypsinized after expansion. The cells were<br>
37<br><br>
then centrifuged and resuspended in wash buffer at the concentration of 1 x 106 /ml. Wash buffer consists of phosphate buffer supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. lxlO5 cells were incubated with SSEA-1, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, CDllc, CD14, CD34, CD45, CD54, CD73, CD105, CD106, CD117, CD123, CD133, HLA-DR antibody conjugated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE). The cells were incubated in the dark for 1 hour at 4°C. The cells were washed 3-4 times with wash buffer and resuspended in 500 ul of wash buffer. Flow cytometry was performed on a   FACS Calibure (Becton-Dickinson). Cells were identified by light scatter. Logarithmic fluorescence was evaluated on 10,000 gated events. Analysis was performed using CELL QUEST software (Becton Dickinson). The control samples were used for adjusting the background fluorescence. The percent positivity was determined with respect to the control tube events. Results are summarized in the Table -1 given below:<br>

Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells were positive for SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 that is a stage specific embryonic antigen usually express on pluripotent human embryonic stem cells derived from inner cell mass. Expression of SSEA-3 and SSEA-4 in limbal tissue derived pluripotent embryonic stem cells was similar to that of human embryonic stem cells. Expression of SSEA-1 however, was not observed in these cells. SSEA-1 usually express on mouse embryonic stem, cells. Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells examined for cluster differentiation markers were negative for CD1 lc, CD 14, CD34, CD-45, CD106, CD123, CD133, and HLA-DR markers. Data demonstrate that the isolated stem cells from limbus are not hematopoietic origin since they are negative for CD34 and CD45 marker. Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells were also negative for CD lie, CD14, CD106, CD123, CD133 and HLA-DR. These particular cell surface markers are only known to express on differentiated cells. This demonstrated that the present pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells are not having any differentiated lineages. (Fig 3). However, expression of CD73, and CD 105 shows that the cells are mesenchymal origin. Limbus tissue has two sets of cells. Upper layer is epithelial in nature and basement cells are stromal cells that contain mesenchymal and fibroblastic cells. Surprisingly these cells were also expressed CD54 marker that is known for endothelial marker. In order to substantiate this finding, our RT-PCR results are also showing the expression of PECAM gene. (Figure 8)<br>
Molecular Analysis:<br>
Array of unique sets of markers have been reported in these pluripotent embryonic stem cells. We analyzed the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers for Oct-4, Nanog, Rexl and TDGF1 genes. GAPDH gene was used as housekeeping gene. Conspicuous expression of all the undifferentiated markers were observed in the pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells at various passages. Undifferentiated markers however, gradually decrease on progression of differentiation (Table 2 &amp; 3). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. Hence, these results clearly indicate that the cells isolated from limbal tissues are pluripotent and has potential embryonic stem cell¬like activity (Figs 5 &amp; 6.).<br>
39<br><br>
We also have performed the profiling of various genes for ectoderm, mesoderm and endodermal lineages like NFH and Keratin (Ectodermal lineage markers), cardiac- Actin (Mesodermal lineage) and AFP and Albumin ( Endodermal lineage markers). The differential expression of appropriate lineage markers in 2d, 4d, 8d, 12d and 14d embryoid like bodies establishes the ability of these cells to give rise to all three lineages (Figs 7&amp; 8.). Expression of the some of the markers such as Keratin, KGF, Collagen-I and P 63 clearly shows that the cells are derived from limbal origin. Expression of P 63 markers also shows that the cells do have some population of corneal limbal stem cells (Table 4.). Table 2:<br><br>

Cellular Analysis:<br>
Pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells are further characterized for its pluripotency and undifferentiation status by cellular markers. Cellular markers used herein are SSEA-4, SSEA-3, SSEA-1, OCT-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-80, Alkaline phosphatase. In order to determine whether these genes are expressed by these cells, cells were collected 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and subjected to imrnunofluoroscense. It was observed that strong expression of all the undifferentiated markers were observed on the undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells (Fig 5).<br>
Telomerase Activity:<br>
Cell extracts from passage 5, 10, 15, and 20 were prepared as per protocol, (see material and methods). After estimation of protein concentration, samples were placed in a thermocycler and PCR was performed as per protocol. After PCR, amplification, amplified products were denatured, and detected by ELISA. Proper positive and negative<br>
41 ^1<br><br>
controls provided in the kit were used, in every assay. Care was taken to remove inhibitors of taq polymerase, which otherwise results in a false negative result. High expression of telomerase activity was seen in all the 5 passages, indicative of high proliferative capacity of the pluripotent embryonic like stem cells.<br>
Karyotyping:<br>
Cells were karyotyped using a standard G-banding technique (Genetics Lab., Reliance Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai) and compared to published human karyotypes. Cells with "normal karyotype" were obtained, which means that the cells at PI3 passage are euploid, wherein all human chromosomes are present and are not noticeably altered (Fig 4).<br>
EXAMPLE-6<br>
GENERATION OF EMBRYOID LIKE BODIES<br>
Undifferentiated pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells are proliferated and expanded. This stage includes culturing embryonic-like stem cells in bacteriological plate having non-adhesive surface that prevents attachment and stimulate differentiation of embryonic-like stem cells. Embryonic-like stem cells are dissociated using brief exposure of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and cultured in an appropriate media as a suspension culture. Appropriate media preferably contain DMEM:F-12 or knockout DMEM and supplemented with 10-20% fetal calf serum, cord blood serum or knockout serum replacement. In addition to that other supplements are also added such as- 2-mercaptoethanol, L-glutamine, insulin, human transferrin, sodium selenite, and without addition of bFGF and hLIF. hi this stage, the cells are incubated for about 4 days and media is changed every alternate day. The medium is changed every day by transferring the suspension of aggregates to a centrifuge tube and allowing the aggregates to settle down, aspirating the medium and replacing it with fresh medium. The aggregates and the fresh medium are returned to the culture dishes. At the end of the 4 days, embryoid like<br>
42<br><br>
bodies (Fig 2) are collected and spun down at low speed (1000 rpm, 5 min) and resuspended in embryonic stem cell medium.<br>
EXAMPLE: 7<br>
INDUCTION OF DIFFERENTIATION INTO NEURONS:<br>
The embryoid like bodies are cultured until they reach sufficient size, for example 4-10 days, preferably 4 days old embryoid like bodies, are plated onto extracellular matrix coated plates, preferably poly-o-orinithin and laminin coated plates. The embryoid like bodies are then cultured under conditions to encourage further differentiation of the cells into neuronal or CNS precursors cells. For example, the embryoid like bodies are cultured in a serum-free defined expansion medium Preferably, the CNS expansion media comprises a minimal essential medium such as DMEM:F12, and is supplemented with neuronal inducing agents such as N2 and B27. The CNS expansion media also preferably includes growth factor, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Preferably, the neuronal cells are grown in the CNS expansion medium for 6 days.<br>
The neuroprogenitor cells prepared according to the methods disclosed herein can be further differentiated into high proportions of mature neurons, for example glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic neurons. The neuronal progenitor cells are grown in the differential medium containing Neurobasal-A medium, insulin (5-20 ug/ml), and transferrin (4-10 ug/ml), FGF-8 (10-50 ng/ml) and supplemented with Ara-C (10-50 ng/ml) and retinoic acid (20-80 ng/ml). The cells are grown in the differential medium for 12 days, with media change on every second day. In order to achieve, mature neuronal-like morphology, the differentiated neurons are grown in the differential medium supplemented with other neuronal growth factors such neurotrophin-3 and GDNF factors. For example the neurotrophin-3 (5-20 ug/ml) and GDNF (10-50 ug/ml) are added in the differential medium on the 6th day of differentiation to day 12 of differentiation.<br>
43<br><br>
Characterization of Neuronal Cells:<br>
The differentiated neuronal cell types generated according to the present disclosure were evaluated both by the overall morphology of the cells, as well as the phenotypes identified by immunuflorescence. Immunuflorescence analysis was carried out at the end of differentiated stage, preferably 12 days after neuronal differentiation as disclosed in the above protocol. First, the isolated cells were grown in 2-well chamber slides, rinsed with PBS, and fixed for 10 minutes with 4 % paraformaledyde at room temperature. Next, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2 % Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1 % normal goat serum and blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin (BAS) for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 degree Celsius with primary antibody (antibody dilution was made in 1 % BSA). The following primary antibodies were employed in the immunuflorescence investigation. Monoclonal GABA 1:200 (Chemicon Inc. USA); Glutamate 1:500 (Chemicon Inc. USA), Nestin 1:50 (Chemicon Inc. USA), Tyrosine hydroxylase 1:800 (Chemicon Inc. USA); B-tubulin HI 1: 500 (Chemicon Inc. USA), Serotonin 1:500 (Chemicon Inc. USA), Neurofilament 1:500 (Chemicon, USA), Oligodendrocytes 1:500 (Chemicon Inc. USA). After overnight incubation with primary antibody, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with FITC labeled secondary antibody for one hour in a dark environment. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and covered with mounting media. The chamber slides were observed under fluorescence microscope to evaluate the immunoposiitve cells.<br>
Results:<br>
Immunuflorescence analysis of the neuronal cells derived from corneal stem cells revealed that high populations of cells were immunoposiitve to neuron-specific markers such as P-tubulin m and neurofilament. Of the total neuronal cells in the culture, majority of the neuronal cells stained with Glutamate, the marker for glutamatergic neurons, while small population of neurons were stained with GABA (marker for GABAergic neurons), Tyrosine hydroxylase (marker for dopaminergic neurons), and serotonin (marker for serotonergic neurons). In addition to neuronal cells, derived cells also stained with<br>
44<br><br>
oligodendrocytes antibodies, which is marker for oligodendrocytes. Morphologically, most of the neuronal cells were bipolar in appearance and having fine projections, while few of them were multipolar in appearance. Typically, mature neurons are identified by the presence of neurofilament like immunoreactivity.<br>
Preferably, a high percentage of the neuroprogenitor cells differentiate into glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic. Most of the derived neuronal cells are expressed neuronal-specific markers such as B-tubulin HI and neurofilament, which verified that derived neurons are indeed neurons (Fig 9).<br>
The neuroprogenitor cells derived from corneal stem cells described herein (e.g., glutamatergic, GABAergic,, serotonergic, dopaminergic and as well as oligodendrocytes) may be utilized for various applications, such as therapeutic application, as well as in vitro and in vivo assessment and screening of various compounds such as small molecule drugs for their effects on the cells.<br>
The neuronal cells can be used to treat or prevent various neurological or neurodegenerative disorders or diseases but limited to Parkinson"s disease, Alzheimer"s disease, Huntington"s disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, cerebellar ataxia, progressive supranuclear palsy, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), epilepsy, stroke, ischemia, injury or trauma to the nervous system, neurotoxic injury, and the like in which neurons or glial cells are injured or die in the central nervous system or spinal cord. Additionally, the neuronal cells derived from pluripotent corneal stem cells can also used in neurological disorders associated with cognition and psychology including but not limited to anxiety disorders, mood disorders, addition, obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), personality disorders, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
INDUCTION OF DIFFERENTIATION INTO HEPATOCYTES:<br>
This example describes the induction of pluripotent embryonic-like stem cells derived from corneal limbus into hepatocytes.<br>
The embryoid like bodies are cultured until they reach sufficient size, for example 4-14 days, preferably 4 days old embryoid like bodies, are plated onto extracellular matrix coated plates, preferably matrigel.coated plates. The embryoid like bodies are then cultured under conditions to encourage further differentiation of the cells into hepatocytes. For example, embryoid like bodies are cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10-15% knockout serum and in the presence of epidermal growth factor 10-100 ng/ml, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 5-50 ng/ml, basic FGF (5-20 r|g/ml), FGF-4 (5-50 r|g/ml) IL-6 (10-100 rjg/ml), acidic FGF(50-100 Tig/ml), human oncostatin (10-50 ng/ml), Insulin-transferrin-selenious acid (ITS) (IX), Dexamethasone (10-100riM), sodium butyrate (1-5 mM), DMSO (0.5-1%), 5 Azacytidine (l-10uM), These growth factors were added together or at different time points as early growth factors, mid- stage growth factors or late stage growth factors, and were kept for 20 days.<br>
Characterization of Hepatocytes:<br>
The differentiated cell types generated according to the present disclosure were examined by morphology of the cells by phase contrast microscopy and by hematoxylin - eosin staining, gene expression analysis by RT-PCR, immunological characterization by immunofluorescence, and functional characterisation by evidence of stored glycogen in the cells by periodic-acid-Schiff s staining (PAS). Analysis was carried out at the end of differentiated stage, preferably 20 days after hepatocyte differentiation as disclosed in the above protocol.<br>
46<br><br>
Immunological Characterisation by Immunofluorescence:<br>
Undifferentiated and differentiated cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min The cells were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (freshly prepared) for 20 mins at room temp. After fixing, the cells were rinsed once with PBS at RT and then stored at 4 deg C or directly permeabilised with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 mins at room temperature for intracellular staining. After aspirating the fixative, cells were washed thrice for 5 mins each with PBS. The cells were then blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 hr at RT. They were given 2 washes with 1XPBS.

Telomerase Activity:<br>
This assay is designed for the highly sensitive qualitative detection of telomerase activity in the cell pellet. The activity was assayed by telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) and detected by photometric enzyme immunoassay. Passage P5, P10, PI5, and P20 were checked for detection of telomerase activity in the cell pellet. All passages expressed high levels of telomerase activity, as indicated by the assay.<br>
Telomerase PCR ELISA was done according to manufacturer"s protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The telomerase PCR ELISA allows highly specific amplification of telomerase mediated elongation products combined with non-radioactive detection following the ELISA protocol. In the first step, telomerase adds telomeric<br>
56<br><br>
repeats (TTAGGG) to the 3" end of the biotin-labeled synthetic primer. In the second step, these elongation products are amplified by PCR using primers generating PCR products with the telomerase specific six nucleotide increments. An aliquot of the PCR product is denatured and the hybridized to a digoxigenin -(DIG)-labeled, telomeric repeat-specific detection probe. The resulting product is immobilized via the biotin labeled primer to a strepatavidin-coated microliter plate. After detection with an antibody, which is conjugated to peroxidase, telomerase activity is detected by formation of a colored product.<br>
Cell extracts from passage 5, 10, 15, and 20 were prepared. After estimation"of protein concentration, samples were placed in a thermocycler and PCR was performed as per protocol. After PCR, amplification, amplified products were denatured, and detected by ELISA. Proper positive and negative controls provided in the kit were used, in every assay. Care was taken to remove inhibitors of taq polymerase, which otherwise results in a false negative result. High expression of telomerase activity was seen in all the 5 passages, indicative of high proliferative capacity of the pluripotent embryonic like stem cells.<br>
Flow cytometry :<br>
The cells were dissociated from the plates using 0.25% trypsin -EDTA treatment for 2-3 minutes. These cells were passed through the 40 micron filter mesh to get rid of any clumps which may interfere with the staining. The cells were resuspended as lxl06cells/ml. lxlO5 cells/tube were added to control and test tubes. The respective antibody was added to each of the test tubes. The tubes were vortexed briefly and incubated for half an hour at room temperature. Fluorescein (FITC) labeled secondary antibody was added to all the tubes, control as well as the test tubes, and the tubes were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in dark. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in IX Phosphate buffered saline for flow cytometry. The samples were analyzed on FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson). A total of 10,000 events<br>
57<br><br>
were acquired. The control samples were used for adjusting the background fluorescence. The percent positivity was determined with respect to the control tube events.<br>
DISCUSSION:<br>
We were able to isolate pluripotent cells from the limbus, despite being an adult tissue specific cell type and a non-embryonic source, its behavior was like embryonic like stem cells, capable of multipotent differentiation, and self-renewing capabilities. The cryopreservation of these cells for 30days had no effect on their percentage viability and pluripotency. Our findings have shown that the origin of our ELSCs is different from those reported earlier (Pittenger et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2002; Toma et al, 1991; Li et al., 2003).<br>
The role of the ELSCs in the eye is speculative. Moreover the factors that govern stem cell survival, migration, replication, plasticity are also not known. Recent reports indicate that the milieu or local microenvironment that a stem cell encounters governs it behavior or fate. To understand this, the cellular and molecular signaling between the local environments in which a stem cell resides needs to be minutely studied. In this context, the role of Wnt signaling pathway in maintenance of pluripotency in human ES cells has very recently been documented ( Sato et al, 2004). Are the ELSCs endogenous stem cells, which reside in the tissues and upon injury. Factors responsible for maintaining the "sternness" of these ocular stem cells have not been determined. Though, the plasticity of the corneal stem cells has been recently published (Seigel et al., 2003). It is believed that both intrinsic as well as extrinsic stimuli are involved in the regulation and maintenance of the stem cell "niche". It is currently believed that this microenvironment maintains the stem cells in its undifferentiated state at rest, while at times of injury it supplies the necessary cytokine mediated or neural mediated signals, to enable recruitment of these cells for undergoing multiple cell divisions. As has been already reported there seems to be a close interaction of the epithelial layer with the stromal niche. We hypothesize that ELSCs are primarily present is the stroma and migrate towards the epithelial zone whenever required, and remain undifferentiated until required.   Embryonic and adult<br>
58<br>
5?<br><br>
epithelia from different locations can be differentiated in to an entirely different phenotype depending on the stromal population recombined.<br>
Adult stem cell therapy holds a great promise for the treatment of regenerative diseases. Clinical trials using mesenchymal stem cells has given encouraging results (Horwitz et al., 1999) and this kind of therapy would definitely be more advantageous than ES cell therapy, which is confronted with a number of ethical issues. The next step in our research will be clonogenic selection and subsequent transplantation in animals to study in vivo engraftment and behavior of ELSCs. Though there is an acute need for further research on the comprehension of the molecular control, and concomitant developmental significance of these processes awaits further in vivo studies, the possibility of using theses ELSCs for tissue specific cell therapy opens exciting clinical perspectives.<br>
