				<td>NOVEL MANNANASES<br>
The present invention relates to -microbial mannanases, more specifically to microbial enzymes exhibiting mannanase activity as their major enzymatic activity in the neutral and alkaline pH ranges; to a method of producing such enzymes; and to methods for using such enzymes in the paper and pulp, textile, oil drilling, cleaning, laundering, detergent and cellulose fiber processing industries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mannan containing polysaccharides are a major component of hues hemicellulose fraction in woods and endosperm in many leguminous seeds and in some mature seeds of non-legurrdnous plants. Essentially unsubstituted linear beta-1,4-mannan is found in some non-leguminous plants, Unsubstituted beta-1,4-mannan which is present e.g. in ivory nuts resembles cellulose in the conformation of she   individual polysaccharide chains, and is water-insoluble. In leg ominous seeds, water-soluble galactomannan is the main storage carbohydrate comprising up to 20% of the total dry weight. Galactomannans have a linear beta-1,4-mannan backbone substituted with single alpha-1,6-galactose, optionally substituted with acetyl groups. Mannans are also found in several  monocotyledonous-..plants    the most abundant polysaccharides in the cell wall material in palm. kernel meal. Gluccmannans are linear polysaccharides with a backbone of beta-1,4-linked mannose and glucose alternating in a more or less regular manner, he backbone optionally being substituted with galactose and/or acetyl groups. Hanna’s, galactomannans, gluccmannans and gHilactcglc.cG:T.£nnans (i.e. glucomannan backbones with branched galactose) contribute to more than 50% of the softwood hemicellulose. Moreover, the cellulose of many red algae contains a significant amount of mannose.<br>
Mannanases have been identified in several Bacillus organisms. For example, Talbot et al., Appl. Environ.<br><br>
Microbiol., Vol.56, No. II, pp. 3505-3510 (1990) describes a<br>
beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus  stearothermophilus  in dimer form having molecular weight of 162 kDa and an optimum pH of 5.5-7.5. Mendoza et al., World J. Microbial. Biotech., Vol. 10, No. 5, pp. 551-555 (1994) describes a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus  subtitles  having a molecular weight of 38 kDa, an<br>
optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 55^C and a pi of 4.8. JP-A-03047076 discloses a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus  sp. r having a molecular weight of 37±3 kDa measured by gel filtration, an optimum pH of, 8-10 and a pi of 5.3-5.4. JP-A-63055289 describes the production of an alkaline, thermostable beta-mannanase which hydrolyses beta-1, 4-D-mannopyranoside bonds of e.g. mannans and produces manno-oligosaccharides. JP-A-63036775 relates to the Bacillus  microorganism FERM P-8856 which produces beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase at an alkaline pH. JP-A-08051975 discloses alkaline beta-mannanases from alkalophilic Bacillus   sp.   AM-001 having molecular weights of<br>
43±3 kDa and 57±3 kDa and optimum pH of 8-10. A purified mannanase from Bacillus  amyloliquefaciens  useful in the bleaching of pulp and paper and a method of preparation thereof is disclosed in WO 97/11164. WO 91/18974 describes a hemicellulase such as a glutamate, xylanase or mannanase active at an extreme pH and temperature. WO 94/2557 6 discloses an enzyme from Aspergillums  aculeate,   CBS 101.43, exhibiting mannanase activity which may be useful for degradation or modification of plant or algae cell wall material. WO 93/24622 discloses a mannanase isolated from Trichoderma   reseed  useful for bleaching lignocelluloses pulps.<br>
WO 95/35362 discloses cleaning compositions containing      - -plant cell wall degrading enzymes having peptidase and/or hemicellulase and optionally cellulase activity for the removal of stains of vegetable origin and further discloses an alkaline mannanase from the strain C11SB.G17.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel 1 and efficient enzyme exhibiting mannanase activity also in the<br><br>
Alkaline pH range, e.g. when applied in cleaning compositions or<br>
different industrial processes.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
Prior to discussing this invention in further detail, the<br>
following terms will first be defined.<br>
The term "orthodox" (or   homolog') denotes a polypeptide or protein obtained from one species that has homology to an analogous polypeptide or protein from a different species.<br>
The term  prolog" denotes a polypeptide or protein obtained from a given species that has homology to a distinct polypeptide or protein from that same species.<br>
The term "expression vector" denotes a DNA molecule, linear or circular, that comprises a segment encoding~a polypeptide of interest operably linked to additional segments that provide for its transcription. Such additional segments may include promoter and terminator sequences, and may optionally include one or more origins of replication, one or more selectable markers, an enhancer, a polyadenylation signal, and the like.  Expression vectors are generally derived from 'plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of burgh. The expression vector of the invention may be any expression vector that is conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal<br><br>
entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The term ^"^recombinant expressed" or "recombinant expressed" used herein in connection with expression of a polypeptide or protein is defined according to the standard definition in the art. Recombinantly expression of a protein is generally performed by using an expression vector as described immediately above.<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a polynucleotide molecule, denotes that the polynucleotide has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use within genetically engineered protein production systems.  Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones.  Isolated DMA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5* and 3* untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators.  The identification of associated regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dyne and Texan, Nature -316:-7- Z8,- 1985) ■  The term "'an isolated polynucleotide" may alternatively be termed "'a cloned polynucleotide".<br>
When applied to a protein/polypeptide, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein is found in a condition other than its native environment. In a preferred form, the isolated protein is-substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)). It is preferred to provide the protein in a greater than 40% pure form, more preferably greater than 60% pure form.<br>
Even more preferably it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 80% pure, more<br><br>
preferably greater than 95% pure, and even more preferably greater than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term  isolated protein/polypeptide may alternatively be termed 'purified protein/polypeptide".<br>
The term "homologous impurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the polypeptide of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the polypeptide of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The term "obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide is produced by the specific source (homologous expression), or by a cult in which a gene from the source have been inserted (heterologous expression].<br>
The term "operably linked", when referring to DNA segments, denotes that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in the promoter and proceeds through the coding segment to the terminator<br>
The term "polynucleotide" denotes a single- or double-<br>
stranded polymer of deoxyribonucleotide or rib nucleotide bases<br>
read from the 5* to the 3' end.  Polynucleotides include RNA and<br>
DNA, and may be isolated from natural sources, synthesized in<br>
victor   or  prepared from a combination of natural and synthetic<br>
molecules. _		 	 ,_<br>
The term "complements of polynucleotide molecules" denotes polynucleotide molecules having a complementary base sequence and reverse orientation as .compared to a reference sequence. For example, the sequence 5' ATGGACGGG 3' is complementary to 5' CCCGTGCAT 3'.<br>
The term "degenerate nucleotide sequence" denotes a sequence of nucleotides that includes one or more degenerate codons (as compared to a reference polynucleotide molecule that encodes a polypeptide). Degenerate codons contain different triplets of nucleotides, but encode the same amino acid residue (i.e., GAU and GAG triplets each encode Asp).<br><br>
The teen "promoter" denotes a portion of a gene containing DNA sequences that provide for the binding of RNA polymerase and initiation of transcription.  Promoter sequences are commonly, but not always, found in the 5' non-coding regions of genes.<br>
The term "secretory signal sequence" denotes a DNA sequence that encodes a polypeptide (a "secretory peptide") that, as a component of a larger polypeptide, directs the larger polypeptide through a secretory pathway of a cell in which it is synthesized.  The larger peptide is commonly cleaved to remove the secretory peptide during transit through the secretory pathway.<br>
The term "enzyme core" denotes a single domain enzyme which may or may not have been modified or altered, but which has retained its original activity; the catalytic domain as known in the art has remained intact and functional.<br>
By the term 'linker" or "spacer" is meant a polypeptide comprising at least two amino acids which may be present between the domains of a multinomial protein, for example an enzyme comprising an enzyme core and a binding domain such as a cellulose binding domain (CBD) or any other enzyme hybrid, or between two proteins or polypeptides expressed as a fusion polypeptide, for example a fusion protein comprising two core enzymes. For example, the fusion protein of an enzyme core with a CBD is provided by fusing a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme core, a DNA sequence encoding the linker and a DNA sequence encoding the CBD sequentially into one open reading frame and expressing this construct.<br>
The term "mannanase" or "galactomannanase" denotes a man-nanas enzyme defined according to the art as officially being named mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase and having the alternative names-" beta-madman’s and endo-1, 4-mannanase and catalyst-g  ■ hydrolyses of 1,4-beta-D-mannosidic linkages in mannans, gaiac-tomannans, glucomannans, and galactoglucomannans which enzyme is classified according to the Enzyme Nomenclature as EC 3.2.1.78 (http://www.expasy,ch/enzyme).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
HOW TO USE A SEQUENCE OF THE INVENTION TO GET OTHER RELATED SEQUENCES: The disclosed sequence information herein relating to a polynucleotide sequence encoding a mannanase of the invention can be used as a tool to identify other homologous mannanases. For instance, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify sequences encoding other homologous mannanases from a variety of microbial sources, in particular of different Eacii-lus  species.<br>
ASSAY FOR ACTIVITY TEST<br>
A polypeptide of the invention having mannanase activity may be tested for mannanase activity according to standard test procedures known in the art, such as by applying a solution to be tested to 4 mm diameter holes punched out in agar plates containing 0.2% AZCL galactomannan (carob), i.e. substrate for the assay of endo-1,4-beta-D-mannanase available as CatNo.I-AZGMA forcer; the company Magazine (Magazine’s Internet address: hertz: //www.megazyme-coTTi/Purchase/index.html) .<br>

GAP is used with the following settings for polypeptide sequence comparison: GAP creation penalty of 3.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.1.<br>
Sequence identity of polynucleotide molecules is deterrence by similar methods using GAP with the following settings for DNA sequence comparison: GAP creation penalty of 5.0 and GAP extension penalty of 0.3.<br>

These species are claimed based on phylogenic relationships identified from aligned 16S cDNA sequences from RDP (Ribosomal Database Project) {Bonne L. Media, Nails Larson, Michael J.

Substantially homologous proteins and polypeptides are char-cauterized as having one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions. These changes are preferably of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions (see Table 2; and other substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein or polypeptide; small deletions, -cynically of one to about 30 amino acids; and small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal motioning residue, a small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues, or a small extension that facilitates purification -an affinity tag), such as a ply-histidine tract, protein A (Nilsson et al . , EMBO J. 4_:1075, 1985; Nilsson et al . , Methods Enzvmol. 198:3, 1991. See, in general Ford et al.. Protein Expression and Purification 2_: 95-10-7, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. DNAs encoding affinity tags are available from commercial suppliers (e.g., Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ; New England Bola’s, Beverly, MA).<br>
However, even though the changes described above preferably are of a minor nature, such changes may also be of a larger nature such as fusion of larger polypeptides of up to 300 amino acids or more both as amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions to a Mannanase polypeptide of the invention.<br>

merhionine In addition to the 2 0 standard amino acids, non-standard amino acids (such as 4-hydroxyproline, 6-N-methyl lysine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, isohaline and a-methyl serine) may be substituted for amine acid residues of a polypeptide according ~o the invention. A lairised   of non~conservative amino acids, amino acids that are not encoded by the genetic code, and unnatural amino acids may be substituted for amino acid residues . '^Unnatural amino acids' have been modified after protein synthesis, and/or have a chemical structure in their side chain (s). different from that of the standard amino acids. Unnatural amino acids can be chemically synthesized, or preferably, are commercially available, and include pipe colic acid, thiazolidine carboxylic acid, dehydroproline, 3- and 4-methylproline, and 3,3-dimethylproline.<br>
Essential amino acids in the mannanase polypeptides of the present invention can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed autogenesis or ai'anine-' scanning autogeneses (Cunningham and Wells, Science 24 4:. 1081-1085, 1989) . In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resul-r,ant mutant molecules are tested for biological activity (i. e mannanase activity) to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et<br><br>
al., J, Biol. Chem. 271:4699-4708, 1996. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction or photo affinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids.  See, for example, de Voss et al., Science 255:306-312, 1992; Smith et al., J, Mol. Biol. 211:899-904, 1992; Woodier et al., FEES Lett. 309:59-64, 1992.<br>
The identities of essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of homologies with polypeptides which are related to a polypeptide according to the invention.<br>
Multiple amino acid substitutions can be made and tested using known methods of autogeneses, recombination and/or shuffling followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer (Science 241:53-57, 1988), Bowie and Sauer (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:2152-2156, 1989), W095/17413, or WO 95/22625. Briefly, these authors disclose methods for siiriultaneously randomizing two or more pcsix:ions in 5 polypeptide, or recombination/shuffling of different mutations fW095/174i3, W095/22625), followed by selecting for functional a polypeptide, and then sequencing the mutagenized polypeptides to determine the spectrum of allowable substitutions at each position. Other methods that can be used include phage display {e.g., Lowman et al., Biochem. 1£:10832-10837, 1991; Lander et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; Huse, WIPO Publication WO 92/06204) and region-directed autogeneses (Derbyshire et al., Gene £6:145, 1986; Ner et al., DNA 2:127, 1988) .<br>
Autogeneses/shuffling methods as disclosed above can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides in host cells. Mutagenized DNA molecules.that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using modern equipment. These methods allow the rapid determination of ~he importance of individual airing acid residues in a polypeptide of interest, and can be applied to polypeptides of unknown structure.<br><br>
Using the methods discussed above, one of ordinary skill in<br>
rhe art can identify and/or prepare a variety of polypeptides that are substantially homologous to residues 33-340 or 33-490 of SEQ ID N0:2; or to residues 32-344 or 32-494 of SEQ ID N0:6; or to residues 32-362 or32-586 of SEQ ID NO:10; or to residues 35-331 of SEQ ID N0:12; or to residues 166-488 or 22-488 of SEQ ID N0:14; or to residues 68-369 or 32-369 of SEQ ID N0:16; or to residues 1-305 of SEQ ID N0:18; or to residues 1-132 of SEQ ID NO:20; or to residues 29-320 of SEQ ID NO:22; or to residues 29-136 of SEQ ID NC:24; or to residues 301-625 or 30-625 of SEQ ID NG:26; or ro residues 166-496 or 38-496 of SEQ ID NO:28; or to residues 26-361 of SEQ ID NO:30; or to residues 593-903 or 23-9C3 of SEQ ID NO:32 and retain the mannanase activity of the wild-type protein.<br>
The mannanase enzyme of the invention may, in addition to the enzyme core comprising the catalytically domain, also comprise a cellulose binding domain (CBD), the cellulose nine in g domain and Enzvmol core (the catalytically active domain) of the enzyme being operably linked. The cellulose binding domain (CED) may exist as an integral par of ::he encoded enzyme, or a CBD from another origin may be introduced into the mannan degrading, enzyme thus creating an enzyme hybrid. In this context, the term "'cellulose-binding domain" is intended to be understood as defined by   et al. 'Cellulose-Binding Domains: Classification and Properties" in "Enzymatic Degradation of Insoluble Carbohydrates", John N. Saddler and Michael H. Fenner (Eds.), ACS Symposium Series, No. 618, 1996. This definition classifies more than 120 cellulose-binding domains into 10 families (I-X), and demonstrates that C3Ds are found” in various enzymes such as cellulases, xylanase, mannanases, arabinofuranosidases, acetyl esterase’s and chattiness. CBDs have also been found in algae, e.g. the red alga Porphyra purposes   as   a non-hydrolytic polysaccharide-binding protein, -see Time et al. , O]D. cit.   However, most of the CBDs are from cellulases and xylanase, CBDs are found at the N and C termini of proteins or are internal. Enzyme hybrids are<br><br>
known in the art, see e.g. WO 90/00609 and WO 95/16782, and may<br>
be prepared by transforming into a host cell a DNA construct comprising at least a fragment of DNA encoding the cellulose-binding domain liased, with or without a linker, to a DNA sequence encoding the mannan degrading enzyme and growing the host cell to express the fused gene. Enzyme hybrids may be described by the following formula:<br>
CBD - MR - X wherein. CBD is the N-terminal or the C-terminal region of an amino acid sequence corresponding to at least the cellulose-binding domain; MR is the middle region (the linker), and may be a bond, or a short linking group preferably of from about 2 to about 100 carbon atoms, more preferably of from 2 to 40 carbon atoms; or is preferably from about 2 to about 100 amino acids, more preferably of from 2 to 40 amino acids; and X is an N-terminal or C-terminal region of the mannanase of the invention. SEQ ID NO:4 discloses the amino acid sequence of an enzx-nme hybrid of a mannanase benzene core and a CBD.<br>
Preferably, the mannanase enzyme of the present invention has its maxim am cat a lyric activity at a kPa of at least 7, mere preferably of at least 8, more preferably of at least 8.5, more preferably of at least 9, more preferably of at least 9.5, more preferably of at least 10, even more preferably of at least 10-5, especially of at least 11; and preferably the maximum activity of the enzyme is obtained at a temperature of at least<br>
40°C, more preferably of at least 50°C, even more preferably of<br>
at least 55°C.<br>
Preferably, the cleaning composition of the present invention provides, eg when used for treating fabric during a washing cycle of a machine washing process, a washing solution having a pH typically between about 8 and about 10.5. Typically, such a<br>
Washing solution is used at temperatures between about 20'  and about 95°C, preferably between about 20'  and about 60°C, preferably between about 2 0°C and about DOE’S.<br><br>
PROTEIN PRODUCTION:<br>
The proteins aid polypeptides, of the present invention, including full-length proteins, fragments thereof and fusion proteins, can be produced in genetically engineered host cells according to conventional techniques. Suitable host cells are those cell types that can be transformed or transfected with exogenous DNA and grown in culture, and include bacteria, fungal cells, and cultured higher eukaryotic cells. Bacterial cells, particularly cultured cells of gram-positive organisms, are preferred. Gram-positive cells from the genus of Bacillus are especially preferred, such as from group consisting of Bacillus subtonics. Bacillus   lentos <br>
.      Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillums  host cells are described in EP 238 023 and Elton et ai., 1984, Proceedings  of the National  Academy  of Sciences   USA  81:1470-1474,  A suitable method of transforming Fusariijm  species is described by Malaria et la.l   1989, Gene  78:147-156 or in cop ending US Serial No. 08/269,449.  Yeast may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarantee, in  Abelson’s, J.N. and Sermon, M.I., editors. Guide   to   Yeast   Genetics  and Molecular Biology, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 194, pp 182-187, Academia Press, Inc., New York; Ito et al.,   1983, Journal   of Bacteriology 153:163; and Hinnen et a., 1978, Proceedings  of  the National Academy of Sciences   USA  75:1920.  Mammalian cells may be transformed by direct uptake using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and Van dour Eb [1378, Virology 52:546).<br><br>
Techniques for manipulating cloned DNA molecules and introducing exogenous DNA into a variety of host cells are disclosed by Sambrook et al.. Molecular Cloning:  A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989; Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY, 1987; and '^Bacillus s-utilise and Other Gram-Positive Bacteria", Sonneteer et al., 1993, American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C., which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In general, a DNA sequence encoding a mannanase of the present invention is operably linked to other genetic elements required for ins expression, generally including a transcription promoter and terminator within an expression vector. The vector will also commonly contain one or more selectable markers and one or more origins of replication, although those skilled in she art will recognize that within certain systems selectable markers gray be provided on separate vectors, and replication of the exogenous DNA may be provided by integration into the host cell venom.  Selection of urometers, terminators, selectable markers, vectors and other elements is a matter of routine design within the level of ordinary skill in the art. Many such elements are described in the literature and are available through commercial suppliers.<br>
To direct a polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepare sequence or pre sequence) is provided in the expression vector. The secretory signal sequence may be that of the polypeptide, or may be derived from another secreted protein or synthesized de  novo-   Numerous suitable secretory signal sequences are known m the art and reference is made to '"Bacillus subtitles and Other Gram-Positive Bacteria", Sonneteer et al., 1993, American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.C.; and Cutting, S. M.(eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for. Bacillus", John Wiley and Sons, 1990, for further description of suitable secretory signal sequences especially for secretion in a Bacillus host cell. The secretory signal sequence is joined to<br><br>
the  DNA sequence in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5 * to the DNA sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest, although certain signal se-quinces may be positioned elsewhere in the DNA sequence of interest (see, e.g., Welch et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,037,743; Holland et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,143,830).<br>
,The expression vector of the invention may be any expression vector that is conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and hue choice of vector will often depend on rhe host cell into which the vector it is to be introduced. Thus, the verse may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use -in filamentous fungus host cells are, e.g. the ADH3 promoter. [McKnight  et  al., The EM30-J. ^ (1985), 2093 - 2099) or the <br>
Transformed or transfected host cells are cultured according our conventional procedures in a culture medium containing nutrients and other components required for the growth of the chosen host cells. A variety of suitable media, including defined media and complex media, are known in the art and generally include a carbon source, a nitrogen source, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Media may also contain such components as growth factors or serum, as required. The growth medium will generally select for cells containing the exogenously added DNA<br><br>
by, for example, drug selection or deficiency in an  essential nutrient which is complemented by the selectable inerter carried on the expression vector or co-transfected into the host cell.<br>
PROTEIN ISOLATION<br>
When the expressed recombinant polypeptide is secreted the polypeptide may be purified from the growth media. Preferably ~he expression host cells are removed from the media before purification of the polypeptide (e.g. by centrifugation).<br>
When the expressed recombinant polypeptide is not secreted from the host cell, the host cell are preferably disrupted and rhe polypeptide released into an aqueous "extract" which is the first stage of such purification techniques. Preferably the expression host cells are collected from the media before the cell disruption (e.g. by centrifugation).<br>
The cell disruption may be performed by conventional techniques such as 'by lysczyme digestion or by forcing the cells "hrough high pressure. See (Robert K. Scobes, Protein Purification, .Second edition, Springer-Verlag) for further description of such cell disruption techniques.<br>
Whether or not the expressed recombinant polypeptides (or chimeric polypeptides) is secreted or not it can be purified using fractionation and/or conventional purification methods and media.<br>
Ammonium sulfate precipitation and acid or chaotrope extraction may be used for fractionation of samples. Exemplary purification steps may include hydroxyapatite, size exclusion, FPLC and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Suitable anion exchange media include derivalized dextrin’s, agarose, cellulose, polyacryamido, specialty" silica, and the like. PEI, DEA-E, QAE and Q derivatives are preferred, with DEAE Fast-Flow Sparse (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) being particularly preferred. Exemplary chromatographic media include those media■ derivatized with phenyl, butyl, or octyl groups, such as Phenyl-Spheres FF (Pharmacia), Toy pearl butyl 650 (Togo Hams, Montgomery vi lie, PA), Ocryl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and the like; or<br><br>
polyacrylic resins, such as Amberchroxn CG 71 (Torso Haws) and the like. Suitable solid supports include glass beads^ silica-based resins, cellulosic resins, agarose beads, cross-linked agarose beads, polystyrene beads, cross-linked polyacrylamide resins and rhe like that are insoluble under the conditions in which they are to be used. These supports may be modified with reactive ' groups that allow attachment of proteins by amino groups, car-boxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups, hydroxyl groups and/or carbohydrate moieties. Examples of coupling chemistries include cyanogen bromide activation, N-hydroxysuccinimide activation, epoxide activation, sulfhydryl activation, hydrazide activation, and carboxyl and amino derivatives for carbodiimide coupling chemis-rries. These and other solid media are well known and widely used in the art, and are available from commercial suppliers.<br>
Selection of a particular method is a matter of routine design and is determined in part by the properties of the chosen support. See, for example, Affinitv Chromatography: Principles &amp; Mei-hods, PharTTLccia LKE Biotechnology, Upsilon, Sweden, 198 6.<br>
