				<td>The present invention relates to an improved digital gasometer for rapid determination of carbonate content in marine sediment<br>
The main usage of the present invention is for rapid measurement of calcium carbonate content of marine sediments<br>
References may be made to the "Karbonat-Bombe" of G Muller and M.Gastner (Neuses Jahrbuch Mineralogie, 1971, H.10. Stuttgart pp 466-469.), gasometric device of J. Hulsemann (Journal of sedimentary petrology, 1966, Vol 36 pp 622-625), rapid gasometer of G.A Jones and P.Kaiteris (Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, 1983, Vol 55, pp 655-660) and vacuum Gasometer described by H.Kato and S. Okabe (Journal of .-Fisheries and Marine .Science and Technology, 1988, Vol No. 27, Tokai University pp. 1-8.) wherein the measurement of carbonates in sediments is done by measuring the pressure generated by reaction of carbonate with weak acids in a reaction chamber, and measurement of pressure is by mechanical or digital pressure sensor.<br>
The "Karbonat Bombe" of G Muller and M.Gastner (Neuses Jahrbuch Mineralogie, 1971, H.10. Stuttgart pp 466-469.) measures the pressure generated in an acrylic reaction chamber with a simple mechanical pressure gauge. A precise amount of sample is weighed and placed in the reaction chamber The acid is filled into a acid resistant bucket and placed into the reaction chamber along with the sample. After closing the reaction chamber the device is tilted and the acid spills onto the sample and reacts with the sample with the liberation of carbon dioxide. The pressure generated being proportional to the amount of carbonate in the sample. The drawbacks are (i) This device is tedious to operate, is less precise and has no safety features and the method of introducing acid into the reaction chamber by a bucket is<br>
hazardous and the operator is exposed to acid fumes and (ii) The pressure gauge is corroded rapidly as it is directly exposed to acid fumes during operation.<br>
The gasometric device of J. Hulsemann (Journal of sedimentary petrology, 1966, Vol. 36 pp 622-625), is similar to the "Karbonat Bombe" but uses a digital pressure gauge for measurement of the pressure generated in an acrylic chamber. The drawbacks are (1) the method of introduction of acid in the reaction chamber is tedious, hazardous and (n) the operator is exposed to acid fumes during this process.<br>
The rapid gasometer described by G.A Jones and P.Kaiteris (Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, 1983, Vol 55, pp 655-660) uses a mercury manometer to measure the pressure generated in a glass reaction chamber. The drawback are (i), this apparatus requires elaborate delicate glassware (ii) uses an open flame, (iii) this apparatus is also tedious to use and (iv) the method of introduction of acid in the reaction chamber is hazardous and the operator is exposed to acid fumes during this process.<br>
The vacuum-gasometric technique described by H.Kato and S. Okabe (Journal of Fisheries and Marine .Science and .Technology, 1988, No. 27, Tokai University pp. 1-8) uses a glass reaction chamber and measures the pressure using a mechanical pressure gauge. In this technique a vacuum pump is used to evacuate the reaction chamber to obtain precise readings. Acid is added in the reaction chamber by filling a side arm and tilting the reaction chamber after closing the reaction chamber. The drawbacks are (I) This apparatus is   very tedious to use and (iv) the method of introduction of<br>
acid in the reaction chamber is hazardous and the operator is exposed to acid fumes during this process<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved digital gasometer for rapid determination of carbonate content in marine sediment which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above<br>
Another object is to provide a simple, precise quick and safe way of introducing acid into the reaction chamber without allowing the liberated gases to escape<br>
Still another object is to prevent the pressure transducer from corroding due to exposure to acid fumes<br>
The digital gasometer of the present invention is fully described substantially in the figure 1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. The digital gasometer essentially consists of a reaction chamber where the sample is placed, a digital pressure gauge and a system to introduce the acid into the reaction chamber The reaction chamber [1] maybe a made of a transparent acid resistant material like acrylic and comprising of a upper half [2] and detachable lower half [3]. A conventional electronic pressure transducer [4] with a range of 0 to 1.0 kg/cm2 is fixed to the top of the upper half of the reaction chamber. A venting stopcock [5] is fixed to the upper half of the reaction chamber for venting the reaction chamber. The pressure generated in the reaction chamber is read from the digital pressure indicator readout [ 6 ] which is connected to the pressure transducer by a cable [7] The acid is stored in a an acid resistant container [8] and a precise amount of acid is introduced into the reaction chamber using a acid dispenser [9] through a flexible   acid resistant tubing [10] by lifting and then depressing the plunger<br>
[11] of the acid dispenser. A one-way microvalve [12] fitted at the end of the acid resistant flexible tubing prevents gases and acids from being flushed back into the dispenser. A acid resistant filter [13] fitted between the reaction chamber and pressure transducer prevents acid fumes from corroding the pressure transducer<br>
The present invention is used for determining the carbonate content of marine sediments by measuring the volume of carbon dioxide released by reaction of the calcium carbonate with dilute acid The pressure generated in the reaction chamber is measured with a pressure gauge which is proportional to the volume of carbon dioxide released due to the above reaction<br>
The novelty of the present invention is in the way acid is introduced into the reaction chamber. In the previous methods acid is introduced into an open reaction chamber by filling a small bucket or side arm with acid and tilting the reaction chamber Introducing acid into an open reaction chamber is hazardous and the operator is exposed to acid fumes. In the present invention, an acid dispenser is used to rapidly transfer a precise amount of acid from a sealed glass bottle directly into a closed reaction chamber through a flexible acid resistant tubing.. There is no escape of acid fumes and the operator and equipment are protected from acid fumes. A one way acid resistant valve fitted at the end of the flexible acid resistant tubing prevents the escape and flushing back of the liberated gases into the acid dispenser Another novel feature is the acid resistant filter fitted between the reaction chamber and pressure transducer which prevents acid fumes from corroding the pressure transducer<br>
The present invention may be used as follows. A precisely weighed dmount of sample is put into the lower half of the reaction chamber which is<br>
then screwed tightly to the upper fixed half A precise amount of acid is introduced into the reaction chamber by lifting fully and then depressing the plunger of the acid dispenser The acid flows directly into the reaction chamber via an acid resistant tube and acid resistant one way microvalve and reacts with the sample The pressure generated due to release of carbon dioxide is read from the digital pressure indicator The pressure buildup in the reaction chamber due to pumping in of the acid should be measured and subtracted from the final reading After the final reading is noted the liberated tjases are allowed to escape by opening the venting stopcock The lower half of the reaction chamber may then be unscrewed cleaned with deionised water and dried<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved gasometer for rapid determination of carbonate content in marine sediment which comprises, a transparent acid resistant reaction chamber [1] a conventional electronic pressure transducer [4] with digital pressure indicator readout [6] a venting stopcock [5] an acid resistant container [8] filled with hydrochloric acid, an acid dispenser [9] the said acid dispenser (9) characterised in that is used to rapidly transfer a precise amount of acid connected to the reaction chamber by a flexible acid resistant tubing [10] a one way microvalve [12] to prevent gases and acids from being flushed back into dispenser and fitted to the end of the acid resistant tube acid-resistant filter [13] fitted between the reaction chamber and pressure transducer<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the operation of this device is more rapid and having a unique precise, rapid and safe method of introducing acids into the reaction chamber and a one way acid resistant microvalve prevents escape of the liberated gases and offering protection from acid fumes to both equipment and operator<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the improved apparatus offers protection from acid fumes to the pressure transducer<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention<br>
EXAMPLE- 1<br>
Determination of calcium carbonate in manne sediments with the improved digital gasometer and companson with calcium carbonate determination using EDTA titration<br>
1	The acid dispenser was filled with 500 ml of 2N Hydrochlonc acid and set to dispense exactly 3 00 ml of acid<br>
2	The pressure gauge was switched on and allowed to warm up for 10 minutes<br>
3	The pressure generated by pumping 3 00 ml of hydrochlonc acid into an empty reaction chamber was measured several times and was found to be 30 mbars Accordingly the initial reading of the pressure gauge was set to -30 millibar and checked that it reads 0 millibar when 3 00 ml of acid is dispensed into the reaction chamber<br><br>
4	For determination of calcium carbonate using the improved rapid digital gasometer, the lower half of the reaction chamber was cleaned with deionised water, dried and a precisely weighed amount of pure sample or standard calcium carbonate is put into it The lower half of the reaction chamber is screwed to the upper half and the venting stopcock closed Exactly 3 00 ml of 2N Hydrochlonc acid was pumped into the reaction chamber and after 1 minute, the pressure inside the reaction chamber was noted<br>
5	The improved digital gasometer was calibrated using varying amounts of standard reagent grade calcium carbonate powder (98 4% CaC03) as shown in Table 1 below<br>
Table 1  Calibration of the improved digital gasometer<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It is seen that there is a    linear relation (R2 =o 0 9996 at 95% confidence limit)<br>
between the amount of calcium carbonate introduced into the reaction chamber and the pressure measured by the pressure gauge<br>
From the pressure generated in the reaction chamber it is possible to calculate the calcium carbonate percentage by using the following equation<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
It must be noted that since the pressure developed in the reaction chamber is dependent on the ambient temperature and pressure conditions the above equation is valid only for the day the calibration was camed out A fresh calibration must be made at least once every day<br>
6 Manne sediment samples from the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Central Indian Ocean were chosen for this experiment The sediments were washed with deionised water to remove its salt content, dned overnight in an oven at 40 C and powdered using an agate pestle and mortar Calcium carbonate was determined using the improved digital gasometer by following steps 1 to 4 given above and using the calibration factor determined for the day as shown above The percentage of calcium carbonate was determined using the equation given above The above equation is valid as both the calibration as well as determination of calcium carbonate was done on the same day Calcium carbonate for the same samples were also determined by another standard method of determination of calcium carbonate descnbed by Welcher F J (Standard methods of chemical analysis Volume 2 - Industnal and natural products and non-instrument methods Part A 1975 Robert E Kreiger publishing company Incorporated Flonda pp 267-269 ) i e by leaching the sample with minimum quantity of dilute HCI and titrating with EDTA The results are shown in Table 2 below<br>
Table 2 Determination of calcium carbonate in manne sediments with improved digital gasometer in companson with EDTA titration Calcium Carbonate percentage was determined from the equation given below using the calibration factor determined for the day<br>
Calcium carbonate % =   (Pressure in mbar * 0 4754 + 0 6648) * 100<br>
weight of sample in mg<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In conclusion it may be said that the present invention provides and rapid, precise and safe method of measurement of carbonates in manne sediments It is seen that compared to EDTA titration method the accuracy of the present invention is better than +2%<br>
The main advantages of the present invention over existing devices are<br>
i    Carbonate measurement by this device is more    rapid and safe compared to<br>
earlier devices ?    A precise amount of acid can be rapidly pumped into the reagent chamber and a<br>
one way microvalve prevents the escape of the liberated gases<br>
3	Handling of acids and exposure of operator to acid fumes is kept to a minimum<br>
4	The stainless steel pressure transducer is protected from acid fumes by suitable acid resistant filters<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
