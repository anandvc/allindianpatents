				<td>SHIP FOR TRANSPORTING ELECTRICAL ENERGY<br>
The invention concerns a ship for and a method of transporting electrical<br>
energy. Electrical conductors are used almost without exception as such<br>
apparatuses. However those electrical conductors are only limitedly suitable for<br>
transport over relatively long distances as the losses in such conductors rise with<br>
increasing length and make energy transport when long distances are involved<br>
uneconomical.<br>
Alternatively electrical energy is used to perform a chemical process such<br>
as electrolysis which results in a desired substance such as for example<br>
hydrogen. That substance can be transported to a destination and there<br>
converted into electrical energy again by a suitable apparatus such as for<br>
example a fuel cell. That situation however involves transporting not electrical<br>
energy but an energy carrier, the production of which on the one hand and the<br>
conversion into electrical energy of which on the other hand involves losses.<br>
In addition it has long been known for electrical energy which is required<br>
for the operation of apparatuses to be carried on or in such apparatuses in<br>
suitable storage devices. By way of example reference may be made here to a<br>
motor vehicle which includes a lead accumulator which provides the electrical<br>
energy required for the start-up process. A further example is for example mobile<br>
telephones which are provided with accumulators for providing the energy<br>
required for operation thereof. Those examples however always involve suitably<br>
carrying around energy which is required by the unit itself.<br>
In accordance with the invention, it is here precisely not the storage device<br>
which makes the energy available in the case of portable units, but transport of<br>
the energy as such, in particular over long distances, that is meant.<br>
In comparison therewith the object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
ship for and a method of transporting electrical energy â€”<br><br>
with the lowest possible level of losses over long distances so that the<br>
energy is ready at the destination for consumption outside the vehicle.<br>
In an apparatus of the kind set forth in the opening part of this<br>
specification that object is attained by a storage device which is formed<br>
from a plurality of storage elements and which is arranged as a payload on<br>
and/or in a vehicle or craft, wherein in the delivery of the electrical energy<br>
the storage device remains on and/or in the vehicle and the vehicle has a<br>
connection for transmitting the stored electrical energy upon discharge.<br>
In addition that object is attained by a method comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
-	charging the storage device with electrical energy;<br>
-	transporting the vehicle to a destination; and<br>
-	discharging the storage device at the destination.<br>
In that respect the invention is based on the realisation that such<br>
storage devices admittedly always involve a mass which, in the case of a<br>
lead accumulator, is considerable, but that this disadvantage fades into the<br>
background in the case of transport over very long distances with a<br>
correspondingly large-size transport capacity, in comparison with the<br>
possible ways of transporting a very large amount of energy in the form of<br>
electrical energy by way of conductors and the losses that this entails.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention accumulators and/or<br>
capacitors are provided as storage elements. These are common storage<br>
elements and are also available in large numbers. In addition use in the<br>
event of damage is thus reliably possible.<br>
In a particularly preferred feature a plurality of storage elements are<br>
combined together mechanically and/or electrically to form storage device<br>
groups. By virtue of that combination, on the one hand they can be<br>
charged or discharged at the same time and/or in the case of replacement<br>
they can be handled as a complete group without each storage element<br>
having to be handled individually. That is particularly advantageous if the<br>
storage device comprises a very large number of storage elements so that<br>
access to an individual storage element is very complicated and expensive.<br>
In this case a storage device group in which the storage element which is<br><br>
being sought is included can be rapidly removed from the storage device <br>
and replaced by a new, faultless storage device group. The vehicle can then<br>
complete its journey with at worst a slight delay.<br>
In a preferred development of the invention the vehicle drive can be<br>
operated with the stored energy. This means that there is no need for the<br>
vehicle to also carry an additional storage device, for example in the form<br>
of a tank with fuel. It will be appreciated that nonetheless a limited supply<br>
of fuel and an internal combustion engine can be carried along in order to<br>
permit an emergency drive.<br>
In order to permit speedy charging or discharging of a storage device<br>
according to the invention, there are preferably provided fixed stations at<br>
which intermediate storage devices are arranged. Thus a vehicle can firstly<br>
deliver its charge to that intermediate storage device and immediately<br>
leave the station again in order to pick up further charges. Then, as<br>
required, the energy can be forwarded from the station or the intermediate<br>
storage device and fed into a network.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention there can be provided a<br>
collective connection for a plurality of storage elements and/or storage<br>
device groups. In that way, a plurality of storage elements or storage<br>
device groups can be simultaneously charged/discharged, in which case it is<br>
possible to save on the time for making the electrical connections to each<br>
individual storage element.<br>
In particular if accumulators which contain an electrolyte fluid are<br>
used as the storage elements, it is possible to save on a considerable part<br>
of the weight of the storage device by removing the fluid so that the fluid is<br>
not contained in the accumulators during the transport procedure. For that<br>
purpose each storage element preferably has an opening. In that way, the<br>
required drive power is reduced or, if the carrying capacity of the vehicle is<br>
fully utilised, the amount of energy which can be transported is increased.<br>
In order not to have to drain off the fluid separately at each<br>
individual storage element, the openings of a plurality of storage elements<br>
can be connected together by collecting conduits. That also affords a time<br>
saving when filling or draining off the fluid.<br><br>
If, when draining off the fluid, the fluid is firstly collected in a container on<br>
board the vehicle, that fluid, after having been drained out of the storage<br>
elements, can be taken off the vehicle with that container in one working<br>
operation or, prior to filling of the storage elements, the fluid can be put on board<br>
in one working operation and preliminary treatment procedures or subsequent<br>
treatment procedures can be carried out independently of the vehicle and<br>
without influencing the travel schedule thereof. If the vehicle for transporting a<br>
battery storage device is for example a ship, then that ship can already cast off,<br>
after charging of the storage device, and begin the journey to the destination<br>
port, while the electrolyte is being drained out of the batteries and collected in a<br>
container (or a plurality of containers).<br>
As soon as the electrolyte is drained out of all storage elements, that<br>
container can be transferred for example with an on-board loading apparatus on<br>
to another ship which carries the fluid back to land for preparation and storage.<br>
With suitable container sizes, that task can also be performed by an aircraft such<br>
as for example a helicopter.<br>
A preliminary treatment or a subsequent treatment can involve for example<br>
cleaning the fluid in order to remove suspended substances therein. In that way<br>
accumulators are always filled with a clean electrolyte and the sludge which with<br>
an increasing service life limits the accumulators or the efficiency thereof cannot<br>
become deposited. That increases the service life of the storage elements, with<br>
a high capacity.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are set forth in the<br>
appendant claims.<br>
An embodiment by way of example of the invention is described in greater<br>
detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a storage device according to the invention on board a<br>
ship,<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of a storage device group according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a simplified view of the procedure involved in energy<br>
transport according to the invention.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a ship 10 as a transport vehicle or craft for a storage<br>
device according to the invention. That storage device is made up of a<br>
plurality of storage elements which are combined together in grouped<br>
relationship in containers 12. The containers 12 can be for example<br>
commercially usual containers which can be transported on known and<br>
available container ships, both below deck, in cargo spaces and also as<br>
deck load. In that way considerable amounts of storage devices can be<br>
transported with such a ship 10.<br>
In order to charge up or discharge the storage devices it is sufficient<br>
to provide a suitable connection at the outside of each container 12. If<br>
storage elements should turn out to be defective, the container 12 in<br>
question with the defective storage device can be unloaded and replaced by<br>
a substitute container using standard loading equipment such as container<br>
bridges or container spreaders, so that the turnaround time of the ship is<br>
not prolonged to any degree worth mentioning, even if storage elements<br>
have to be replaced. In a corresponding manner for example when using<br>
accumulators as the storage elements, the electrolyte fluids can be<br>
respectively introduced and drained off in container-wise fashion in each<br>
case by way of collecting conduits in order in that way to reduce the weight<br>
of the storage device during the journey.<br>
Figure 2 shows a partially cut-open view of such a container 12 with<br>
storage elements 14 arranged therein in such a way as to fill up the space.<br>
In the left-hand part of Figure 2 the storage elements 14 are shown in the<br>
form of capacitors such as for example high-capacity ultracaps. In the<br>
right-hand part of the Figure they are shown in the form of accumulators,<br>
for example lead accumulators. That clearly shows the many different<br>
possible ways of constructing the storage device. It will be appreciated that<br>
basically it is possible to use any suitable storage elements 14.<br>
Figure 3 shows the method according to the invention. The left-hand<br>
part of the Figure shows wind power installations 20 which continuously<br>
generate electrical energy. That electrical energy is stored in an<br>
intermediate storage device 24 by way of a control 22. If now a ship 10 or<br>
the storage devices thereof are to be charged up the storage devices are<br><br>
connected to the connecting station 26 and the control 20 causes a flow of<br>
current from the intermediate storage device 24 and/or the wind power<br>
installations 20 to the connecting station 26 and to the storage device on<br>
board the ship 10.<br>
As soon as the storage device on board the ship 10 is charged up,<br>
then, in the case of lead accumulators, the electrolyte can be drained off<br>
and cleaned and then stored in a tank. The ship 10, with the charged<br>
storage devices but without electrolyte, can then steer for its destination<br>
port. There it is once again connected to a connecting station 36. If<br>
necessary electrolyte which is stored there can again be filled into the lead<br>
accumulators and the discharge operation begins. In that case there is once<br>
again provided a control 32 which firstly causes a flow of current from the<br>
storage device into an intermediate storage device 34 and/or straightaway<br>
into a network 30 in which the electrical energy can then be consumed.<br>
For the return journey the electrolyte can then be removed again<br>
from the storage device which has been discharged in the meantime.<br><br>
