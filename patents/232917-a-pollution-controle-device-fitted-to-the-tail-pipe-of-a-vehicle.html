disposed along the longitudinal axis or radially of tail pipe, a circuit dfifcrbLt.<br>
having a switching member connected between said power source and<br>
ion emitter to disconnect the ion emitter in the event of a short circuit.<br>
Reference is made hereinafter to a vehicle. Such a reference has<br>
been made as a matter of convenience to exemplify an embodiment, but<br>
without intending to imply any limitation. Thus, such reference is also<br>
intended to include an engine.<br>
In accordance with this invention the device is adapted to be fitted<br>
or held to the tail pipe and after the silencer of a vehicle. A negative ion<br>
generating member is provided with said device. Preferably, a plurality of<br>
such generating members are provided with said device. In accordance<br>
with one embodiment, the ion generating member are disposed in a<br>
spaced relationship to each other, such members being<br>
: 3 :<br>
: 4 :<br>
disposed longitudinally and within the length of the<br>
tail pipe,, The generating members may comprise needles<br>
or sharp pointed members so as to cause a generation of<br>
negative ions. In accordance with another embodiment,<br>
i. on g en er a t i n g mem bers a re d i sposed rad i a 11 y to 5a i d<br>
pipe and within or outside thereto.<br>

Further objects and advantages of this<br>
invention will be more apparent from the ensuing<br>
description when read in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig.. .1 shows a device adapted to be fitted to a<br>
tail pipe in accordance with one<br>
embodiment;<br>

Referring to the drawings and with particular<br>
reference to fig. 1 the tail pipe 1 has the device 2 of<br>
s 5 :<br>
the present invention removably held thereto,<br>
by means of metal clamps 15. The device 2 specifically.<br>
comprises ian ioniser 4 disposed within the tail pipe 1.<br>
and at the outlet end 5,, Ionizer 4 is covered within an<br>
i n su 1 a t i. n g mem ber 3 prov i ded ex ter i or to tail p i pe .1.,<br>
and adapted to hie connected to a power source through<br>
the circuit of fig 4. As shown in fig. 1 ionizer 4 has<br>
an e;-;posed surface 4a within tailpipe 1 and terminating<br>
i. n t o a B i. n q 1 e p o i. n t e d n e e d 1 e 4 b , T h e s i. n g 1 e p o i n t<br>
needle 4b discharges a cloud of ions within tail pipe<br>
4. Such .ions meet the exhaust stream discharged from<br>
the engine and flows in the direction of the outlet of<br>
tail pipe i. Such ions assist in the formation of<br>
nascent oxygen which converts carbon monoxide in the<br>
exhaust stream to carbon dioxide. Further, such a<br>
nascent oxygen converts the hydrocarbons present in the<br>
exhaust stream into water and carbon dioxide. The<br>
part.iculat.es present in the exhaust. stream form a<br>
cluster and agglomerate into bigger particles and drop<br>
to the bottom of the tail pipe 1 and are drawn out by<br>
the moving gases. In accordance with the present<br>
invention, ionizer 4 is connected to a power source<br>
through a circuit having a voltage amplifier so as to<br>
produce a high d.c. voltage 19 of at least 5KV to the<br>
ionizer. The? presence of such a high voltage allows the<br>
production of hiqher levels of nascent oxygen.<br>
