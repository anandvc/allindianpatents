treadle pump for irrigation'<br>
2. APPLICANT<br><br>
(a)	NAME :<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION      The following specification<br>
particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to the field of manual pumping of water for domestic consumption as well as irrigating small plots of land and more particularly to the field of pumping in areas where there is no electricity. This is achieved by a foot-operated treadle pump, which can be operated by a medium built person.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
A few prior works in the field are summarized in the following paragraphs.<br>
The Russian Patent No.RU2108485 apparently relates to a treadle pump, incorporating therein a rocker and an accelerating system. The present invention has no such features, is constructed of molded engineering plastic, employs a manifold box, threaded inlet-outlet ports and rubberized inlet-outlet valves. It substantially differs from the cited prior work of art. The Chinese patent No. 19882014194U discloses no information on the available patent databases.<br><br><br><br>
Drawbacks of existing Inventions<br>
a.	The barrels of all the above pumps and what used in patent<br>
no. RU2108485, GB 2363828, GB 2397856 and CN<br>
2044292U are made from steel sheets with a welding. Since<br>
they are seam welded the performance is depended on<br>
workmanship and the skill of the fabricator.<br>
b.	Also the barrel piston assembly with the steel piston rings<br>
and gaskets offers a good frictional resistance to movement<br>
and hence shorter life of the seals.<br>
c.	The pistons are also fabricated from steel. The replacement<br>
of gaskets is a difficult task.<br>
d.	The manifold assembly is almost non existent but if present<br>
in some pumps is fabricated from steel sheets. Higher<br>
pressure and suction is very difficult to achieve.<br>
e.	All the fabricated parts are to be hot dipped galvanized for<br>
long life-otherwise very prone to rust and corrosion. The<br>
inside of the fabricated cylinder / barrel is rough because of<br>
hot dipped galvanizing and the protective coating gets worn<br>
out easily in due course of time and thereby attracting rust<br>
and added difficulty to restart the operation after keeping it<br><br><br>
idle for even a day.<br>
f.	Base component pat no 4671746 and 6,612,325 is in the<br>
yoke format composed of one single assembly which also<br>
pivotally mounts piston and handle assembly for the same<br>
reason to provide strength to the whole structure it uses a<br>
extruded aluminum, in the present invention this extra use of<br>
aluminum is avoided by segregating all the parts into the<br>
separate component provided with the rim for strength also<br>
the segregation helps detached parts to be easily replaceable.<br>
g.	The overall operating efficiency of the existing units is low.<br>
3.0	Obj ects of the Invention<br>
3.1	The principal object of the present invention is to devise a lightÂ¬weight treadle pump that can be carried easily over a distance, which has a very high efficiency, requires low maintenance, is easy to repair, and very consistent in quality.<br>
3.2	Another object of this invention is to make the cylinder piston and<br>
manifold assembly entirely out of molded engineering plastic for the known advantages of light weight, dimensional consistency and lower coefficient of friction vis-a-vis the conventional sheet metal pumps and production of the pump is carried out with mass production capability.<br><br><br>
4.0	Summary of Invention<br>
4.1	The present invention addresses these problems with a treadle pump which is lightweight, operationally efficient in delivering higher quantities of water for given manual energy input, is sturdy in construction, has a long operational life and is simple to maintain and repair. The improved treadle pump has all components made of injection molded thermoplastic, has threaded end for cylinders and improved piston assembly.<br>

6.0	Description of the Invention<br>
6.1	The invention relates to a device used in an liquid expulsion type spout unit used in a reciprocating twin cylinder piston pump type spout unit by mounting it on manifold pressure sustaining assembly by means of threading and sealing in the upright position. The use of all injection molded thermoplastic components, the specially designed manifold assembly help achieve the best performance and utility. The complete treadle pressure pump with the use of this thermoplastic molded unit with the fabricated mechanism is portable and one person can move it<br><br><br>
to different locations with minimum effort as it weighs around 12Kgs only.<br>
A pair of cylinders (01) - made of molded plastic by injection molding - is longitudinally fitted by means of male threaded end (1.30) into a manifold (05), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 1/13 and # 5/13. The said cylinders (01) are open-mouthed and have internal flanged section at the open mouth thereof for high strength thereto. A rubber gasket is fitted between the collar (1.2) thereof and the threaded end (1.3) for a leak-proof threaded connection.<br>
An upright mounted fully detachable pump comprises of twin cylinders having an upper piston rod opening and a lower end provided with means for releasably securing the cylinder onto the manifold box. The upper end of the piston rod (02-A) extends through and outwardly of the head portion on the upper end of the cylinder to which guy rope and frame is connected. The pedals are such operate the pistons in the cylinders in counter operation mode. The piston rod ( 02-A) when depressed by pedal to push in the piston increases the pressure inside transfers the liquid to the manifold delivery side through the openable rubber flaps (09) and also accordingly reduces the pressure in the other cylinder chamber<br><br><br>
thus opening the rubber flaps i.e. inlet valve (9) in the suction side of the manifold to allow the liquid to fill in the cavity thus created, sucking up the contents of the manifold assembly. In such reciprocating pump type spout unit, the cylinder piston pumping assembly is attached to manifold assembly (5) by threading and sealing by means of rubber rings. The bottom of the manifold assembly is sealed on to the bottom plate (7) by rubber gasket nuts bolts and specially designed thermoplastic molded washers for uniform pressure all along the edge. A piston (02) - each of a pair of pistons, constructed of molded engineering plastic by injection molding - is fitted in position to the piston rod (02-A) thereof by means of nuts and washers on either side of the said piston (02). The piston (02) has a pair of grooves (2.3), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 2/13. A rubber gasket (03) - as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 3/13 - is fitted / mounted on the said pair of grooves (2.3) of each said piston (02) manually.<br>
Like the cylinder (01), the piston (02) and the piston rod (02-A), the manifold (05) is constructed in one-piece of molded engineering plastic by injection molding process and is illustrated<br><br><br>
in the accompanying drawing # 5/13. The manifold (05) has a central threaded inlet (5.6) on one front side thereof and its counterpart threaded outlet (5.6) on the other rear side thereof. On either side of the said threaded inlet (5.6) and the threaded outlet (5.6) is provided a pair of ribs (5.6-A), extending from top end thereof to the base thereof that are joined into a wall, enveloping the said threaded connection. There is provided additionally on each lateral side thereof a pair of ribs (5.5). The underside of the manifold (05) has a central partition (5.3), extending longitudinally across the manifold (05) and reinforced at midpoint distance with the said pair of lateral ribs (5.5). The said central partition (5.3) is held in a groove (7.3) of the base plate (07). The manifold (05) has a flanged bottom end (5.2-A) to which is bolted through a rubber gasket (06) a bottom plate (07). The gasket (06) and the bottom plate (07) are respectively illustrated in the accompanying drawings # 6/13 and # 7/13. A rubber flap valve (09) - as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 9/13 - is sandwiched by means of a pair of molded strip holding plate (10)-as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 10/13 - and is fitted to the manifold (05) by means of a pair of split pins (11) by<br><br><br>
squeezing its split ends (13.1) through the holes (5.3-A) - as illustrated in the accompanying drawing #11/13. Molded washers (8A-1/8A-2) and (8A-3/8A-4) - as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 12/13 - are used to ensure leak-proof joint of the base plate (07) with the manifold (05). The molded washers have recessed base surface and curvature identical to the rim of the base plate, exerting thereby uniform pressure along periphery and yielding a leak-proof fitment. The pump has a metal frame structure to support the thermoplastic "Cylinder-Piston manifold block assembly" in the firm position. The Frame structure is used to fix the complete molded cylinder-piston assembly by using bolts as clamping means. The frame is so designed that the plastic molded assembly doesn't require to be bolted or fixed. It is secured perfectly in place protected fairly from mechanical strains. All the areas of stressed contacts are adequately reinforced to take the stresses and suitable locating seats are created in the molded components to avoid any mistakes whatever during assembly and use. The steel fabricated structure is made out of hollow steel sections properly welded to from the framework as per the design<br><br><br>
requirement - to withstand the working loads in minimum overall weight of the unit. The fabricated framework can be either hot dipped galvanized or powder coated or plated to make it resistant to corrosion.<br>
The cylinder-piston-manifold assembly with the base plate is supported in position by a top (100) and a bottom metal frame structure (101), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 14.<br>
6.5.1	The bottom frame structure (101) is constructed of rectangular hollow steel sections, forming a bracket with four vertical sections (102) such that the manifold assembly fits exactly within it with the base plate thereof properly supported by the horizontal sections (103). The bottom section bears the weight of operator and of the unit as well and is powder coated or galvanized to make it corrosion resistant.<br>
6.5.2	The top metal frame structure (100) is constructed of steel angle sections with holes such that bolts fastening the top frame (100) fit perfectly into nuts welded inside the vertical sections of the bottom frame structure (101). The central hollow section rests perfectly onto recessed portion of the manifold box. The manifold fox with base plate is sandwiched between this section of the top<br><br><br>
frame (100) and the base section of the bottom frame structure (101). This arrangement not only protects the plastic molded assemblies but exerts enough force to counteract the inside pressure during pump running operation and facilitates to form a leak proof joint.<br>
6.5.3	2 no. treadles are hinged at one end onto the extreme end of the top frame structure (100). They have small angular sections welded in between just above the piston rod to impart the required up and down reciprocating movements on the piston rod assembly.<br>
6.5.4	A molded pulley (103) constructed of reinforced plastic has a metal hollow steel insert (104) to take care of wear and tear. It has a recessed groove on it for facilitating movement of plastic rope to ensure lifting action of piston rod.<br>
6.6     Salient Features of Invention :<br>
6.6.1 PUMP : The pump manifold and fitting, cylinders and pistons are all made from injection molded engineering thermoplastic - very strong, impact resistant, and low heat deflection, anti ageing and durable properties. Since they are injection molded from special tool steel die molds on sophisticated machines - consistent<br><br><br>
product quality is achievable. Till date due to lack of proper design, injection molded cylinders, pistons and valve manifold were unsuccessful. All the components have been adequately strengthened with ribs and sections. Sealing is done with the use of rubber gaskets and circular rings wherever required which can be easily changed after prolonged use. The piston design and the mounting of the rubber gaskets is aimed to get lesser frictional losses by substantially reducing the frictional coefficient to improve upon the pumping efficiency and simultaneously reducing the muscle power involved in. 6.6.2 THE DESIGN : The whole unit including the fabricated structure is so designed that a person weighing 60 kg should easily carry the unit, install it at place and then should be able to suck water from a well of upto 7 mtrs depth and pump it to a level upto 15mtr. The quantity of the water a person can transfer would however depend on the levels - upto 20001trs per hr. at the highest level and as much as 50001trs per hr. at minimum heads. The present invention relates generally to a reciprocating pump and particularly to a reciprocating pump used for the water delivery for irrigation and construction activities.<br><br><br>
Reciprocating pumps for such purposes are known and are commonly designed with galvanized metal welded material and have generally flat metal or wooden plates joined by a double hinge about which the plates can be turned in a reciprocating fashion by acting on the ends remote from the hinge. In each case the volume between the piston and manifold box is separated by flexible rubber flaps acting as unidirectional valves allowing water (liquid) in from the suction side of the manifold and out into the delivery side of the manifold.<br>
6.6.3	When considering pumps of this sort it is desirable to produce the largest possible displacement volume for each cycle of the reciprocal motion. Additionally, taking into account the most likely usage at remote and de-electrified sites. It is advantageous for such a pump to be as easily portable as possible. A further consideration is the ergonomic relationship between the actuating member and that part of the user's anatomy, for example the foot, by which the pump is to be activated. Consideration must be given to the most ergonomically effective positioning of the foot on the pump paddie.<br>
6.6.4	With an increase in size to increase the displacement volume the<br><br><br>
mechanical force onto the piston is also increased requiring a heavier load to create the necessary pressure, this would make the pump more cumbersome involving a longer stroke which is inconvenient for the user.<br>
Although a degree of lateral movement of the point of contact of the foot is acceptable due to a hinge design, natural movement of climbing stairs during pumping with a maximum possible and comfortable rise is taken into account. 6.6.5 The present invention seeks, therefore, to provide a reciprocating pump in which the displacement volume is maximized, with a pressure enough to run a drip / sprinkler system or to transfer water upto 15mtrs head whilst retaining portability. It is a feature of the present invention that the design is ergonomic and allows a much more agreeable movement by the user in operating the pump. The piston rods are fitted to the piston by means of nut bolts and sealing washers.<br>
The piston has grooves to hold the rubber gasket seals which fit inside snugly and can be easily replace whenever necessary. The twin cylinders having an upper end provided (with a inside flanged for reinforcement) open head portion and a lower end<br><br><br>
provided with means for releasably securing the twin cylinders on manifold - boys. 6 The pump assembly consisting of the twin cylinders pistons fitted onto the manifold assembly is designed strong enough and impact resistant to sustain the pressure and mechanical forces generated during pumping and handling.<br>
The pump has a metal frame structure to support the thermoplastic "Cylinder-Piston manifold block assembly" in the firm position. The Frame structure used to fixed the complete molded cylinder-piston assembly uses simple bolts as clamping unit, designed in such a manner that the plastic molded assembly doesn't require to be bolted or fixed. It is secured perfectly in place protected fairly from mechanical strains. All the areas of stressed contacts are adequately reinforced to take the stresses and suitable locating seats are created in the molded components to avoid any mistakes whatever during assembly and use. The Treadles, the base supports are made like the conventional pumps from fabricated steel sections with corrosion treatment -either Galvanizing or powder coating or plating suiting to requirement.<br><br><br>
6.6.7 Advantages of Invention :<br>
The use of engineering plastic molded manifold assembly, threaded cylinders, and pistons coupled with perfect product design gives the following distinct advantages.<br>
a.	Consistent product quality is achieved as almost all the<br>
working components in the piston cylinder and manifold<br>
assembly are injection molded in engineering thermoplastic<br>
material.<br>
b.	Closer tolerance hence better performance.<br>
c.	Smoother finish and concentricity of cylinder bore and piston<br>
- hence minimum frictional losses and hence easier and highly<br>
efficient operation resulting to minimum and optimum use of<br>
manpower.<br>
d.	Minimum weight - hence making the whole product light<br>
weight as much as 50% less weight than the available ones.<br>
Making the unit more portable. To the extent even a child can<br>
work on it.<br>
e.	Easier maintenance - the piston gaskets are simply mounted<br>
on the pistons without the use of any fasteners.<br>
f.	Since the main pump unit is made from thermoplastic,<br><br><br>
corrosion or using or even scaling is ruled out. The contact during operation / movement of the piston is between the cylinder inside walls and the rubber gaskets. The rubber gaskets being softer get worn out over prolonged use but no appreciable wear on the cylinder. These can be replaced easily whenever necessary, g. All the components can be easily assembled hence easy replacement of any single part if necessary as possible by the user. The cylinders and hence the piston assembly is easy detachable from the top for changing of gaskets or for tightening of the piston rod nuts/ fasteners. All molded parts are interchangeable - replacement of a single component is easy. 6.7     Working of invention :<br>
6.7.1 Conventional reciprocating pumps for such purposes are known and are commonly designed with galvanized metal welded material and have generally flat wooden plates joined by a double hinge about which the plates can be turned in a reciprocating fashion by acting on the ends remote from the hinge. In each case the volume between the piston and manifold box is separated by<br><br><br>
flexible rubber flaps acting as unidirectional valves allowing water (liquid) in from the suction side of the manifold and out into the delivery side of the manifold. This embodiment carries oppositely orientated inlet and outlet valves (9).<br>
6.7.2	The piston rods are fitted to the piston by means of nut bolts and sealing washers.<br>
6.7.3	The piston has grooves to hold the rubber gasket seals which fit inside snugly and can be easily replaced whenever necessary.<br>
6.7.4	The twin cylinders have an upper end provided with a open head portion and a lower end provided with means for releasably securing the twin cylinders on manifold assembly.<br>
6.7.5	The inlet and outlet valves are created by rubber flaps hinged onto the manifold assembly by means of the split pins(ll) and strip plate (10) assembly Commonly known reciprocating pumps with rubber flaps hinged use metal nuts and bolt and supporting strip washers which, unless they are stainless steel, will corrode over time and this may be accelerated by exposure to certain conditions such as to kind of liquid pumped, its PH value, minerals content and presence of oxidizing agents in it. The present invention assembly being made up of thermoplastic<br><br><br>
component is not vulnerable to corrosion and related problems.<br>
6.7.6	According to a second aspect of the present invention a reciprocating pump assembly is provided with thermoplastic molded manifold box having a clear reinforced partition wall meant for separating the manifold into two independent compartments viz suction and delivery. The box is positively sealed at the bottom of the bottom plate (07) by means of rubber gasket and nuts bolts and molded seal support washers to distribute the sealing pressure uniformly on the entire flanged rim. The manifold box has the internal threading on the top for sealed fitment of the cylinders with provision for fixing of the unidirectional flow control rubber flap as described above. Also the manifold box has perforations below the rubber flaps for the smooth flow of the liquids in operation and simultaneously provides support to rubber flaps.<br>
6.7.7	The pump is operable by relative movement of piston (2) to create suction and pressure to intake and expel water from the suction to the delivery side of the manifold box.<br>
6.7.8	A suction and delivery hose can be removably attached to either the inlet valve or outlet valve. The delivery hose is reieasably<br><br><br>
connected to the outlet with both the Inlet &amp; Outlet pipe having same specifications.<br>
6.7.9 The present invention is Useful in the area of civil engineering, agriculture individual construction water supply for production of concrete construction members delivery of water for watering orchards or gardens and for other purposes like drainage clearance where generally sites are devoid of electricity.<br>
6.7.10All of the embodiments of the pump structure namely two cylinders with pistons and valve system, suction system and delivery system, manifold box mounted on the base plate are made up of injection molded thermoplastics.<br>
7.0	Best Method of Operation of Invention<br>
7.1	The invention may be operated by a child. However, water delivery<br>
to higher elevations is achieved with ease, when the invention is operated by an adult weighing 60 kgs.<br><br><br>
