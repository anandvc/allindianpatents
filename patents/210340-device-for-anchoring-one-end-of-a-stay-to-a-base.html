THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10] "DEVICE FOR ANCHORING ONE END OF A STAY TO A BASE"<br><br>
VSL INTERNATIONAL AG, of Scheibenstrasse 70, 3014 Bern, Switzerland,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
31-8-2007<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a device for anchoring one end of a stay to a base,<br>
This invention relates to a device for anchoring one end of a stay to  a base, generally called an anchor head.<br>
	Designated by stay is particularly, but not exclusively, a cable used<br>
 for the construction of suspended and stayed structures, such as suspension fbridges, cable-stayed bridges, stadium roofs, buildings, telecommunications<br>
towers, etc.<br><br>
A stay could also be a cable used for an earth anchor. (An earth   anchor includes a steel tension member, or members, sheath encased and   embedded in ahardenable material such as mortar grout poured in a bore hole    prepared in the ground.)<br>
Such a stay allows parts of a structure to be connected where bases   for the anchoring of the ends of this stay have been created beforehand, each   through the agency of a device designed for this purpose.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for creating a device of the   aforementioned type.<br>
The invention relates more specifically to a device for the anchoring   of one end of a stay to a base, this end of the stay comprising at least two strands which diverge from the longitudinal axis of the stay in such a way as to become anchored in the device, the strands each being generally made up of a metallic core wire and a protective sheathing, the device itself being intended to be positioned and immobilised in translation in a bore provided in said base.<br>
To anchor the stay to the base, one starts by mounting the anchoring device on the base in the shouldered bore, then in this device one engages, then immobilises, the ends concerned, one by one, of the strands.<br>
Such a device comprises a first rigid unit which :<br>
 delimited transversally by a cylindrical face and longitudinally by<br>
two opposite faces, substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of said first<br>
unit,<br>
-	is traversed by perforations which, made substantially parallel to<br>
       the longitudinal axis of the unit, are each intended for passage of one end,<br>
devoid of sheathing, of a strand, and each including a bearing surface intended to co-operate with an immobilisation piece of such an end devoid of sheathing,<br><br>
-	bears at least one tubular element to cover, over a certain distance<br>
measured from one of its opposite faces, the bundle of strands in a water-tight<br>
way at least in its part where the strands are devoid of sheathing.<br>
In this type of device, the length of the tubular element, referred to as the transition pipe, is such that it makes the device cumbersome to mount.<br>
1:<br>
In the prior art, to place the device in the bore of the base and abutting against the shouldered face of this bore, it often happens that it is not possible to mount it by engaging it in the bore, against its shouldered face.<br>
In the prior art, the mounting must be achieved in reverse manner,<br>
that is to say in a direction opposite to that in which the stay must be stressed,<br>
and stops, clamping jaws making up a so-called split shim, must be installed<br>
around the device to allow it to find, ultimately, support against the shouldered<br>
        face of the bore.<br>
These technical features increase the manufacturing price of these creations.<br>
One object of the invention is to obtain an anchoring device which overcomes this drawback.<br>
	Likewise a drawback with the state-of-the-art devices is that the ends<br>
of the strands which have had their sheathing removed are not protected<br>
3<br><br>
against oxidation through the device during the entire duration of mounting, which can amount to between several hours and several months.<br>
In fact, the strands are mounted one by one, and the tubular element which must finally cover the bundle of strands in a water-tight way does not ensure individual protection of these strands during their mounting.<br>
One solution can consist in protecting the strands by metallisation, but this method increases the manufacturing cost.<br>
An object of the invention is to obtain a device which makes it possible to protect the part of each strand devoid of sheathing against oxidation     during and after installation of the strands.<br>
An additional object of the invention is to obtain a device which can be prefabricated without posing problems with respect to transport to the place of utilisation and subsequent mounting on the base.<br>
Another object of the invention is to obtain a device which makes it        possible to damp the vibrations and bending constraints of each strand, and this individually.<br>
Another object is to obtain a device in which it is possible to check the system of protection for each strand during service.<br>
Finally, a further object of the invention is to obtain a device of     standardised length.<br>
To achieve these objects, the invention has as its subject matter a device of the aforementioned type, in particular characterised in that, in the state of being separated from the base, the device comprises a second substantially cylindrical, rigid unit which :<br>
	- is rigidly connected to said first unit,<br>
4<br><br>
- has at least two independent channels which, running substantially parallel and in each case in the prolongation of a perforation of the first unit, each have the one of their ends connected in a water-tight way to the first unit and the other having,<br>
•	a first locally water-tight pressing surface around the sheath<br>
covering the core wire of a strand, when it is engaged in the channel,<br>
•	a second surface of lateral support for the sheath of a strand in<br>
view of the deviation of said strand from the axis of the channel, which receives<br>
it, toward the axis of the end of the stay.<br>
The invention will be better understood from reading the following description, given by way of non-limiting example, with reference to the attached drawings :<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal section of a non-adjustable anchoring device according to the invention in which certain constituent parts have been omitted in order to show more clearly the details of the device,<br>
Figures 2 and 3 are a longitudinal section of two different embodiments of an adjustable anchoring device according to the invention,<br>
Figures 4 to 10 show diagrammatically, the different stages in producing a device according to the invention.<br>
Referring to the drawings, one sees a device 1 tor anchoring one end 2A of a stay 2 to a base 3, this end 2A of the stay 2 comprising at least two strands 2B which diverge from the longitudinal axis^Cj&gt;f the stay 2 in such a way as to come to be anchored in the device 1, these strands 2B each being made up of a core wire 2D and a protective sheathing 2E, the device itself being intended to be positioned and immobilised in translation in a bore 3A provided in the base 3.<br>
5<br><br>
By way of example, in Figure 1, the device shown is of non-adjustable type in axial position in the bore 3A of the base 3, whereas in Figures 2 and 3, the device shown is of adjustable type in axial position in the bore 3A of the base 3.<br>
As can be seen in the drawing, the device 1 comprises a first rigid unit 4, which :<br>
- is delimited transversally by a cylindrical face 4A and longitudinally by two opposite faces 4B, 4C substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 4D of said first unit 4,<br>
	- is traversed by perforations 4E which, made substantially parallel to<br>
the longitudinal axis 4D of the unit 4, are each intended for passage of one end 2F, devoid of sheathing 2E, of a strand 2B of the stay 2, and each including a bearing surface 4F intended to co-operate with an immobilisation piece 4G of such an end 2A devoid of sheathing 2E,<br>
	- bears at least one tubular element 5C to cover, over a certain<br>
distance L1 measured from one 4C of its opposite faces 4B, 4C, the bundle of strands 2B in a water-tight way at least in its part where the strands 2B are devoid of sheathing 2E.<br>
For example, as seen in Figure 2, the outer cylindrical surface 4A of         the first unit 4 can have at least locally a threading 4J with which a threaded ring 4K co-operates, intended to be supported on a shoulder 3B provided around the bore 3A made in the base 3.<br>
The screwing or unscrewing of the ring 4K allows adjustment of the position of the anchoring  device  1   in the  bore 3A of the  base 3 and,     consequently, adjustment of the tension of the stay 3.<br>
Noteworthy is that in the state of being separated from the base 3, the device 1 comprises a substantially cylindrical second rigid unit 5 which :<br><br><br><br>
-	is rigidly connected to said first unit 4,<br>
-	has at least two independent channels 6A which, running<br>
substantially parallel and in each case in the prolongation of a perforation 4E of<br>
      the first unit 4, each have the one 6C of their ends 6C, 6D connected in a     water-tight way to the first unit 4 and the other having,<br>
•	a first locally water-tight pressing surface 7A around the sheath 2E covering the core wire 2D of a strand 2B, when it is engaged in the channel 6A,<br>
•	a second surface 8A of lateral support for the sheath 2E of a strand 2B in view of the deviation of this strand from the axis 6B of the channel 6A,<br>
       which receives it, toward the axis 2C of the end 2A of the stay 2.<br>
With these means the device makes possible protection against oxidation of the part of each strand 2B which is devoid of sheathing 2E, and this during and after the successive installation of each of said strands 2B.<br>
These technical features likewise make it possible to provide stand-      by sites for the strands 2B, i.e. sites in which it is possible to mount strands 2B later on, for example to increase the resistance of a structure.<br>
Noteworthy is that the second unit 5 comprises a cylindrical body 5B traversed by a plurality of holes 5A each accommodating a tubular piece 6 which :<br>
  	-at a first end 6C, is connected to the first unit 4 in a water-tight way<br>
such that its channel 6A is situated substantially in the axis 4H of a perforation 4E of said first unit 4,<br>
-	at a second end 6D, bears said first locally water-tight pressing<br>
surface 7A around the sheath 2E and said second surface 8A of lateral support<br>
    for the sheath 2E.<br><br>
These technical features make it possible to really ensure a water-tightness strand by strand.<br>
With a device of this type, it is possible to replace one or more strands without affecting the water-tightness of the strands in place.<br><br>
. 	It is likewise possible to check selectively the water-tightness of each<br>
strand.<br>
It is to be noted that the device according to the invention (Figure 1) comprises a covering 90 which is intended to cover in a water-tight manner the set of immobilisation pieces 4G of ends 2A, of strands 2B, which are accessible     from the one 4B of the opposite faces 4B, 4C of the first unit 4.<br>
It is to be noted moreover that the device according to the invention<br>
(Figure 1) can comprise a plurality of caps 9 which are each intended to cover<br>
in a water-tight manner an assembly which, made up of an immobilisation piece<br>
4G of an end 2A of strand 2B and said end 2A of strand 2B, is accessible from<br>
       the one 4B of the opposite faces 4B, 4C of the first unit 4.<br>
For example, each cap 9 co-operates in a water-tight way with a seat of water-tightness built around the entrance of the bearing surface 4F.<br>
It is possible for the set of caps 9 itself to be covered by the covering 90.<br>
	Noteworthy is that the second end 6D of each tubular piece 6 bears<br>
an element 8, referred to as a drilled element 8, which :<br>
-	is connected in a water-tight manner to the second end 6D of said<br>
tubular piece,<br>
-	has an axial channel intended for the passage of a strand 2B, in<br>
     particular covered by a sheath 2E,<br><br><br>
-	accommodates an annular element 7, made of elastic, deformable<br>
material, which has a bore of a diameter compatible with the passage of the<br>
sheath 2E, but whose surface 7A constitutes the locally water-tight pressing<br>
surface around this sheath 2E of a strand 2B,<br><br>
	- bears the lateral support surface 8A for the sheath 2E, surface 8A<br>
being provided in view of the deviation of the strand 2B.<br>
The grouping together of the surfaces fulfilling the functions of water tightness and of deviation on a drilled element 8, which is installed on a tubular piece 6, makes it possible to construct a device in an economical way.<br>
	In fact, the drilled elements 8 can be used, for example, with tubular<br>
pieces 6 of different lengths I_2.<br>
Noteworthy is that each tubular piece 6 is inserted by its first end 6C into a bore 41 reserved for this purpose in the first unit 4 in such a way that the channel 6A of the respective tubular piece 6 is situated substantially in the axis 15    4H of a perforation 4E of said first unit 4.<br>
This ensures water-tightness and facilitates the mounting of the device.<br>
These features are exploited in the method described later on.<br>
Noteworthy moreover is that each drilled element 8 has (Figure 1 23    and Figures 4 to 7):<br>
-	a first bore 8C, dimensioned to allow a water-tight fit on a second<br>
end 6D of a tubular piece 6, and a bearing surface 8D to limit the amount of<br>
axial insertion on said end 6D, and this by abutting on the end face 6F of this<br>
end 6D, and<br><br><br>
15<br><br><br>
-	a bearing surface 8E where the annular element 7 is retained that<br>
accommodates the locally water-tight pressing surface 7A around the sheath<br>
2E of a strand 2B.<br>
In a first embodiment (Figure 4):<br>
	- the bearing surface 8E, in which the water-tight annular element 7<br>
around the sheath 2E of a strand 2B is retained, is made up of a portion of the surface of the first bore 8C dimensioned for water-tight fit on a second end 6D of a tubular piece 6, this bearing surface 8E being located in the vicinity of the bearing surface 8D of the drilled element 8 which is intended to limit the axial insertion with said end 6D of the tubular piece 6,<br>
-	the annular element 7, which accommodates the water-tight<br>
support surface 7A around the sheath 2E of a strand 2B, is dimensioned to fit in<br>
the bore 8C of the drilled element 8 in such a way as to be able to be placed<br>
between, on the one hand, the bearing surface 8D of this element 8 which is<br>
intended to limit its insertion on the end 6D of the tubular piece 6, and, on the<br>
other hand, the end face 6F of this end 6D.<br>
In a second embodiment (Figure 5), the bearing surface 8E intended to receive the water-tight annular support element 7 around the sheath 2E of a strand 2B, consists in an annular groove made in the wall of the drilled element 8, and this being between said first bore 8C and the surface 8A of lateral support for the sheath 2E, provided in view of the deviation of the strand 2B.<br>
In a third embodiment (Figures 6 and 7), the preferred embodiment, the drilled element 8 :<br>
-	on the one hand, is made up of at least two parts 81, 82, namely,<br>
• a first part 81 which comprises the first bore 8C dimensioned to allow the water-tight fit on an end 6D of a tubular piece 6 and a bearing surface 8D to limit the axial insertion on said end 6D by pressing at least indirectly on the end face 6F of that end 6D, and<br><br><br><br><br><br>
• a second part 82 which comprises the surface 8A of lateral support for the sheath 2E, surface 8A being provided in view of the deviation of the strand 2B, and<br>
-	on the other hand, these first and second parts 81, 82 are provided<br>
with bearing surfaces for assembly through axial insertion, which limit the axial<br>
insertion in such a way as to reserve an accommodation for the water-tight<br>
annular support element 7 around the sheath 2E of a strand 2B that is to say a<br>
bearing surface 8E where the annular element 7 is retained.<br>
The term drilled does not refer to any specific method to obtain the bores 8C and 8F.<br>
	In a noteworthy way, each drilled element 8 has at least one stop 8B<br>
oriented to resist the material making up the second unit 5 and impede its extraction from this second unit 5.<br>
In a noteworthy way, the second unit 5 comprises :<br>
-	an outer tubular element 5C formed by a rigid tubular wall delimited by an inner cylindrical face 5D, an outer cylindrical face 5E and two opposite annular end faces 5F, 5G,<br>
-	an inner cylindrical element 5B formed by a core 5B of material in which channels 6A are provided, the channels being intended to prolong the perforations 4E of the first unit 4, and which closely abuts, on the one hand, against the inner face 5D of the tubular element 5C and, on the other hand, against the first unit 4.<br>
These technical features make it possible to transfer efficiently, on the first unit 4 and thus on the base, forces which arise through the collection of strands, these forces being oriented transversely to the device.<br>
In a manner which is also noteworthy, the outer tubular element 5C makes contact with the first unit 4 through the one 5F of its annular end faces<br><br><br>
                                                     11<br><br><br>
5F, 5G, and has at this end a flange 5H (Figures 1 and 2) which protrudes with respect to its outer cylindrical face 5E, and bears support surfaces for anchoring elements 51 in the said first unit 4.<br>
The anchoring elements preferably consist of screws the bodies of     which traverse the flange at its thickness to become anchored in a threaded boring reserved for that purpose in the first unit and whose heads abut on an open face of the flange.<br>
In another noteworthy manner (Figure 3), the outer tubular element 5C and the first unit 4 are connected by threaded surfaces 41,51.<br>
10	In one noteworthy embodiment, the inner cylindrical element 5B can<br>
be formed by a core 5B of material having vibration-damping features.<br>
For example, the inner cylindrical element 5B is formed by a core 5B of material obtained through hardening of at least one material introduced in the rigid tubular element 5C around tubular pieces 6 and in such a way as to         confine the drilled elements 8.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment example, the material used can comprise high-strength concrete.<br>
In particular, the longitudinal dimensions :<br>
-	L1, of the outer tubular element 5C,<br>
                         - L2 , of each tubular piece 6,<br>
-	L3, of each boring 41 reserved in the first unit 4 to accept a tubular piece 6,<br>
-	L4, of the inner cylindrical element 5B,<br>
12<br><br><br>
are determined in such a way that each drilled element 8, its stop 8B intended to impede its extraction from the second unit 5, resists the material making up said second unit 5 without said material impeding the passage of a strand 2B.<br>
As has already been mentioned, the invention also relates to a method for obtaining a device 1 for anchoring an end 2A of a stay 2 to a base 3, this end 2A of the stay 2 comprising at least two strands 2B which diverge from the longitudinal axis 2C of the stay in such a way as to become anchored in the device 1, said strands 2B each being made up of a core wire 2D and a     protective sheathing 2E, the device being intended to be positioned and immobilised in translation in a boring 3A provided in the base 3.<br>
According to this method :<br>
-	a first unit 4 is provided which is,<br>
•	delimited transversally by a cylindrical face 4A and longitudinally by<br>
        two opposite faces 4B, 4C substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 4D of<br>
the said first unit 4,<br>
•	traversed by perforations 4E, made substantially parallel to its<br>
longitudinal axis 4D, which are each intended for the passage of an end 2F of a<br>
strand 2B of stay 2 devoid of sheathing 2E and each comprising a bearing<br>
    surface 4F intended to co-operate with an immobilisation piece 4G of such an end 2A devoid of sheathing 2E, and<br>
•	bears at least one tubular element 5C to cover, over a certain<br>
distance measured from one of its opposite faces, the bundle of strands 2B in a<br>
water-tight way at least in its part where the strands are devoid of sheathing,<br>
-	a second rigid unit 5, substantially cylindrical, is built against face<br>
AC, of said opposite faces 4B, 4C, of the first unit 4, which is the face intended<br>
to bear at least one tubular element 5C to cover the bundle of strands 2B at<br>
least in its part where the strands 2B are devoid of sheathing 2E, which second<br><br>
13 <br><br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
rigid unit 5 is rigidly connected to said first unit 4, this second unit having at least two channels 6A which,<br>
•	extend substantially parallel, each in the prolongation of a<br>
perforation 4E of the first unit 4,<br>
•	each have one 6B of their ends which is connected in a water-tight<br>
