				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes based on polyacrylonitrile or copolymers based on acrylonitrile and other monomers. The membranes made by the process of this invention have improved separation properties giving a substantial increase in purity of fluids permeating through the membrane. Such membranes are highly useful for microbiological purification of water during which virus, bacteria and cysts are to be removed with certifiable high log reductions in particle counts.<br>
Polymeric ultrafiltration membranes are commonly prepared by the "phase inversion" method (R.E. Resting, 1971, Synthetic Polymeric Membranes, McGraw-Hill) in which a thin film of a polymer solution is solidified by immersion in a bath containing a non-solvent. Poly(acrylonitrile) and its copolymers can be dissolved in polar organic solvents such as dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetamide, or dimethyl sulfoxide for purposes of membrane preparation (U.S. patent 4,025,439) . By virtue of relatively low cost, solvent power and safety in handling, dimethyl formamide is a preferred solvent for preparing the polyacrylonitrile containing solution. For similar reasons, water is a preferred non-solvent.<br>
The use of copolymers based on acrylonitrile with other monomers have been suggested as materials for ultrafiltration membranes eg. U.S. patent nos. 4,181,694 (isobutene, vinyledene chloride, butadiene, methacrylonitrile, ethylene vinyl ether as<br><br>
comonomers), U.S. patent 3,950,257 (vinyl pyrrolidone as comonomer) and U.K patent application GB 2,096,941A (methyl methacrylate and sodium salt of vinylsulfonic acid as comonomers).<br>
The prior art mentioned above do not describe  the preparation of PAN ( Polyacrylonitrile)membranes  using salts. The membranes prepared by the prior art are  not useful  in the separation of microbes, viruses  in  the process of purification of water.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of the  ultra-filtration  membranes based on poly(acrylonitrile)  and its copolymers useful for purification of water free of microbial contaminants.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of ultrafiltration membranes based on polyacrylonitrile and its copolymers which comprises preparing a saturated solution of a di- or trivalent metal salt such as herein described in an organic solvent as herein described, filtering the resulting solution to remove undissolved particles, adding the poly(acrylonitrile) polymer or its copolymer in an amount in the range of 10 to 20% by weight to the above solution, mixing thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous solution, casting this solution by conventional technique, and gelling the cast film in a bath containing water to obtain the polymeric membrane.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the solution used for the membrane contains between 0.5 to 4% of a di- or triva-lent metal salt which is soluble both in the solvent used to dissolve the polymer as well as in the non-solvent in which the polymer solution is immersed.<br>
The polymers used include polyacrylonitrile or copolymers of acrylonitrile and acrylamide, prepared by any conventional method. The amount of acrylamide in the copolymer used may be preferably 10-20% . The acrylamide containing polymer will yield membranes with better fouling resistance in the same applications .<br>
The solvents used for preparing the solution of the polymers may be selected from well known solvents for polyacrylonitrile such as dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl acetamide.<br>
The non-solvent used to coagulate the polymer may be or lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol etc.<br>
The di- or trivalent salt which is incorporated to the polymer solution must be soluble in both the solvent (e.g. dimethyl formamide) as well as nonsolvent (e.g. water). Suitable examples of such salts are chlorides and nitrates of Zn, Fe and Al.<br>
The purification ability of the membrane can be expressed in<br><br>
the following related manners:<br>
R ( Rejection) = 1- ( concentration of species A in the permeate<br>
/ concentration of species A in the feed)<br>
or,<br>
LR (log reduction) = log 10 (concentration of species A in the feed / concentration of species in the permeate) LR can  also be expressed as log 10 [1/(1 - R) ] .<br>
Ultrafiltration membranes are described by their nominal molecular weight cut off (MWCO) defined arbitrarily as the molecular wt of the species for which R is approximately 0.9 (Cheryan M., Ultrafiltration Handbook, 1986, Technomic Publishing Co.).<br>
The membranes prepared as per the process of the present invention have unexpectedly high values of LR for bacteria, virus and cyst removal in comparison with other membranes with similar MWCO values made by a conventional method. These membranes appear to have a narrower pore size distribution, so defects and large pores which allow passage of virus, bacteria, cysts are greatly eliminated. The presence of such large pores/defects can be readily detected by the bubble point technique. Correlations of LR for bacteria with bubble points are well established for microfiltration membranes (Goel et al , in Membrane Handbook, 1992, Van Nostrand Reinhold). The membranes of this invention have higher  bubble points than the conventionally made membranes.<br><br>
While the membranes of this invention have higher values of LR compared to conventional membranes with similar MWCO values, the membrane permeability for water is not greatly reduced.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein with the help of examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1 :<br>
A solution was prepared by adding polyacrylonitrile in dimethyl formamide (DMF) in order to make a 13% polymer solution. The mixture was stirred until dissolution. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes were washed in water overnight. The membranes were characterized for their pure water flux, rejection of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The performance of 3-5 samples cut from each membrane is summarized in Table 1.<br>
Example 2 :<br>
A solution was prepared by first dissolving 4 % of urea in DMF, filtering the solution and then 13% polyacrylonitrile was added and stirred till complete dissolution. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes were washed in water overnight. The<br><br>
membranes were characterized for their pure water flux, rejection of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The performance of these membranes is also summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that urea as an additive does not improve the membrane performance .<br>
Example 3 :<br>
A solution was prepared by first dissolving 4 % of LiCl in DMF, filtering the solution and then 13% polyacrylonitrile was added and stirred till complete dissolution. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes were washed in water overnight. The membranes were characterized for their pure water flux, rejection of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The performance of these membranes is also summarized in Table 1. Addition of a monovalent metal based salt such as LiCl gave membranes with less defects; however, this was with substantial flux penalty.<br>
Example 4 :<br>
A solution was prepared by first dissolving 4 % of ZnCl2 in DMF, filtering the solution and then 13% polyacrylonitrile was added and stirred till complete dissolution. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes were washed in water overnight. The membranes were characterized for their pure water flux, rejection of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The performance of<br><br>
these membranes is also summarized in Table 1. Membranes cast from solutions containing ZnCl2 have similar ultrafiltration performance (water flux, rejections of BSA or PEG) as the membrane cast from solution without additives. However, the incidence of defects is less as shown by the higher value of the average bubble points and less scatter in the bubble point measurements .<br>
Example 5 :<br>
A solution was prepared by first dissolving 4 % of AlCl^ in DMF, filtering the solution and then 13% polyacrylonitrile was added and stirred till complete dissolution. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes were washed in water overnight. The membranes were characterized for their pure water flux, rejection of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The performance of these membranes is also summarized in Table 1. Membranes cast from solutions containing AlCl3 have improved properties similar to those cast with ZnCl2<br><br>
Example 6 :<br>
A solution was prepared by first dissolving 4 % of Fed-, in DMF, filtering the solution and then 13% polyacrylonitrile was added and stirred till complete dissolution. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes was washed in water overnight. The membrane was characterized for their pure water flux, rejection<br><br>
of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The performance of the membrane is also summarized in Table 1. Membranes cast from solutions containing FeCl3 has improved properties similar to those cast with ZnCl2<br>

Example 7<br>
The membrane cast as per the procedure of Example 2 using ZnCl2 as an additive was compared to the membrane prepared without this additive when both membranes were wound in the form of spiral modules. E coli containing broth was circulated through the modules at 0.7 bars at 1 1pm. The permeate was collected and assayed for bacterial content along with feed side samples. The feed contained 108 E.coli counts /ml. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>

*  measured at   0.7  kg/cnr"<br><br>
Example 8<br>
A copolymer of poly (acrylonitrile-acrylamide) was prepared by solution polymerization of the two monomers acrylonitrile and acrylamide using acidic catalyst (HN03) as per the procedure of Bhadani and Kundu (Macromol. Chem., Rapid Commun. 1, 1980, p281). The copolymer containing 15 mole% of acrylamide and 85 mole% acrylonitrile had intrinsic viscosity between 0.8 to 1.0 dl/gm. Two solutions were made each containing 18% copolymer in DMF, one containing ZnC12 the other one without. It was then cast by knife coating on a moving porous support and gelled in 20°C water. The cast membranes were washed in water overnight. The membranes were characterized for their pure water flux, rejection of PEG and BSA and their water bubble points. The bubble point profiles of both membranes are shown in Table 3. This shows that the ZnCl2 additive greatly depresses the incidence of large pores, in the case of acrylamide-acrylonitrile copolymer as well.<br>
The ultrafiltration membranes cast from the solution containing a di- or trivalent metal salt have a reduced number of macrovoids, defects etc; thus giving better separation without significant loss in flux. These membranes are suitable for microbiological purification of water and other aqueous media. Membranes made by a similar process but omitting the salt additive to the casting solution have a large number of defects making them unsuitable for microbiological purification.<br><br>

Example 9<br>
A solution was prepared by first dissolving 4 % of ZnCl2 in DMF, filtering the solution and then 19% polyacrylonitrile was added and stirred till complete dissolution. The resulting solution was extruded under 50 psi nitrogen pressure through a hollow fiber spinneret. The resulting membrane was obtained as a hollow fiber with internal diameter of 0.7 mm and outer diameter of 1.3 mm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
