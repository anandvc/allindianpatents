				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to grinding machines, in particular tool grinding<br>
machines with concentricity correction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
With grinding machines, especially tool grinding machines, high accuracy must<br>
now be attained, which makes stringent demands in terms of precision on all the<br>
machine elements involved, especially with regard to the bearing and guidance<br>
of the workpiece as well as the bearing and guidance of the grinding head.<br>
Inaccurate chucks represent a considerable problem in this respect.<br>
EP 0611630 discloses a torsionally-rigid portal (9) is fixed to the machine bed<br>
(2), having a gantry (11) between two lateral uprights (10). The spindle<br>
mounting (20) is adjustable along the gantry on a first axis (-Y). The bed<br>
protrudes in front of the portal to one side. The uprights can be at the opposite<br>
sides of the bed, and can be supported from its protruding end. A closed<br>
stiffening rear wall (13) can be mounted between the uprights, and can also be<br>
rigidly secured to the bed.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
With this as the point of departure, it is the object of the invention to create a<br>
grinding machine, in particular a tool grinding machine, with which tools can be<br>
made with highly accurate concentricity in a simple and reliable way.<br>
DE19753426 discloses the invention relates to a device for correcting radial run-<br>
outs during the fabrication of cylindrical parts (9). The device comprises a<br>
rotating spindle (4) which can be driven and a chuck (5, 6) which is fastened to<br>
the spindle (4) and accommodates a cylindrical part (9). The invention is<br>
characterized in that the chuck (5, 6) can be transversally displaced on the<br>
spindle (4) relative to the spindle axis (3) by being actuated with a defined force.<br>
In addition, a measuring device (12) is provided in order to determine a radial<br>
run-out of the cylindrical part (9) relative to the spindle axis (3). The invention is<br>
also characterized in that a final control element (14) can be controlled according<br>
to the measurement result of the measuring device (12) in order to generate the<br>
defined force which thus displaces the chuck (5,6) relative to the spindle (4). The<br>
device permits the middle axis (13) of a cylindrical part (9) to be centered<br>
opposite the spindle axis (3) in a fully automatic manner.<br>

position detection device, which are connected to the workpiece receptacle a<br>
grinding head, which has a rotary drive mechanism and carries at least one<br>
grinding tool; a positioning device which is connected to the workpiece<br>
receptacle and/or to the grinding head, for effecting a relative motion between<br>

device, taking into consideration the alignment error and the eccentricity in order<br>
to cause the grinding tools to track an unsteady workpiece so that the workpiece<br>
is machined concentrically and to the correct dimension.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for controlling a<br>
grinding machine, in particular a tool grinding machine, comprising the steps of<br>
receiving an elongated rotationally symmetrical blank or a workpiece in a<br>
workpiece receptacle; rotating the workpiece receptacle in a rotary positioning<br>
device about a predetermined receptacle axis, the rotary positioning device<br>
having a rotary position detection means, which are connected to the workpiece<br>
receptacle; providing a grinding head, which has a rotary drive mechanism and<br>
carries at least one grinding tool; effecting a relative motion between the<br>
grinding tool and the blank or workpiece in a positioning device, which is<br>
connected to the workpiece receptacle and/or to the grinding head; determining<br>
the eccentricity and the misalignment of the blank or workpiece with respect to<br>
the receptacle axis in a measuring device; determining control commands for the<br>
positioning device, in a machine control unit, connected to the rotary positioning<br>
device, the rotary position detection device, the positioning device, and the<br>
measuring device, and having a computation module, taking into consideration<br>
the alignment error and the eccentricity in order to cause the grinding tools to<br>
track an unsteady workpiece so that the workpiece is machined concentrically<br>
and to the correct dimension.<br>
The grinding machine of the invention performs the required grinding machining<br>
on the basis of a coordinate system defined by the clamped workpiece. This can<br>
be done either by working directly with tool coordinates, or, which is preferred,<br>
by first determining the location and orientation of the workpiece coordinate<br>
system by means of a measurement and then converting this workpiece<br>
coordinate system to the machine coordinate system by means of a kinematic<br>
transformation. For the kinematic transformation, a transformation matrix is<br>
used, which is obtained from the orientation of the workpiece and its oordinate<br>
system within the machine coordinate system. As a result, the machine control<br>
unit takes a virtually arbitrary misorientation of the workpiece in the machine<br>
coordinate system into account. If the machine coordinates for instance include<br>
cartesian coordinates x, y, z, which characterize a relative motion between the<br>
grinding wheel and the workpiece, as well as one or more pivot axes about<br>
which the grinding head and/or the.............................................<br>
workpiece holder is to be pivoted, then in addition to the<br>
machine coordinates a receptacle axis of the workpiece<br>
receptacle is used, which describes a rotation of the<br>
workpiece receptacle about the longitudinal direction of the<br>
workpiece to be clamped. The machine coordinate system thus<br>
in the most general case has six degrees of freedom; that is,<br>
it has three linear axes and two pivot axes as well as one<br>
rotary axis. This last axis is formed by the receptacle axis.<br>
The tool coordinate system is for instance a cartesian<br>
or a polar coordinate system. This system is designed such<br>
that at least one axis forms the axis of symmetry of the<br>
preferably cylindrical blank. This coordinate direction, also<br>
called the workpiece axis, is determined in a first<br>
measurement step. This is done in the machine coordinate<br>
system by means of a suitable measuring device, such as an<br>
optical measuring device or a mechanical tracer, which traces<br>
the blank, which initially is cylindrical as a rule, on its<br>
jacket face in the course of one or more revolutions of the<br>
workpiece receptacle about the receptacle axis. The tumbling<br>
motion that exists is recorded. From the path that the blank<br>
takes, the location of the workpiece axis can be calculated<br>
relative to the receptacle axis. The receptacle axis and the<br>
workpiece axis need not intersect one another. The location<br>
of the workpiece axis to the receptacle axis is determined by<br>
two vectors x0, r0. The two vectors characterize the<br>
eccentricity and the misalignment of the two axes to one<br>
another.<br>
The control unit converts the position of the blank,<br>
taking these vectors into account, into the machine<br>
coordinate system and takes this into account in triggering<br>
suitable control motors, which are associated with the<br>
various directions of motion (axes) of the components, that<br>
is, of the grinding head or of the workpiece holder of the<br>
grinding machine. Taking this into account can be done in<br>
such a way that the existing and previously determined<br>
commands for the actions of the individual control motors of<br>
the individual axes are modified. However, it can also be<br>
done in such a way that the tumbling motion of the workpiece<br>
is taken into account in advance when creating the individual<br>
control commands for the control motors. This last can be<br>
done by setting up a transformation specification T, which<br>
converts the kinematic transformation of a point PW in the<br>
workpiece coordinate system into a point PM of the machine<br>
coordinate system (PM = T (PW)), taking the vectors x0, r0<br>
into account. The new transformation Tnew (T, x0, r0) is then<br>
in turn used for converting (copying) a point PW in the<br>
workpiece coordinate system into a point PM in the machine<br>
coordinate system; PM = Tnew (PW). It should be noted that<br>
the vectors x0, r0 are dependent on the coordinate C of the<br>
machine coordinate system that describes a rotation of the<br>
receptacle about the receptacle axis.<br>
The determination of the vectors xo, ro is preferably<br>
done at the beginning of each machining operation on the<br>
still un-machined blank. For each machining operation, an<br>
individual transformation specification Tnew (T, x0, r0) is<br>
therefore set up. Thus for the individual blanks, different<br>
chucks can be used, whose accuracy is no longer critical.<br>
Even with very inexpensive chucks, highly precisely machined<br>
tools can thus be produced, whose ground cutting edges and<br>
other functional faces are positioned in the very best way<br>
possible to the tool axis. The tool axis is defined by the<br>
predetermined tool shaft on the blank. The latter can be<br>
shaped cylindrically or conically. Precise concentricity in<br>
precision chucks is assured, even though the workpiece may<br>
have been ground in a substantially less-precise chuck.<br>
Further details of advantageous embodiments of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the drawings, the description, and the claims. In the drawings,<br>
one exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In Fig. 1, a tool grinding machine 1 is shown in a schematic illustration. It<br>
includes a machine frame 2, which carries a grinding head 3 and a tool holder 4.<br>
As schematically indicated in Fig. 1 by arrows, the tool holder 4 and the grinding<br>
head 3 are adjustable relative to one another in three coordinate directions X,Y<br>
and Z. The corresponding guides for the X direction, the Y direction and the Z<br>
direction, and the drive mechanisms not otherwise shown for moving the tool<br>
holder 4 or-the grinding head 3 in these directions are represented here as<br>
"axes" or "CNC axes". The tool holder 4 is furthermore pivotably supported about<br>
a vertical axis B. The tool holder 4 furthermore has a workpiece receptacle 5,<br>
which is rotatable about a receptacle axis C. The motions along all the directions<br>
X,Y,Z and about the axes B and C are monitored, or in other words<br>
controlled/regulated, by a machine control unit 6, as schematically shown in Fig.<br>
5.<br>
The grinding head 3 serves to produce the desired workpiece, such as a drill or<br>
milling cutter or the like, from a blank 7 that is held in the workpiece receptacle<br>
5. The blank 7 is preferably a cylindrical body. As Fig. 3 shows, it is as a rule<br>
clamped by the workpiece receptacle 5 not entirely coaxially with the receptacle<br>
axis C. Instead, the axis of symmetry of the cylindrical blank 7, or in other words<br>
the workpiece axis D, deviates from the receptacle axis C. As a rule, the<br>
deviation is stochastic, and it is all the greater, the lower the accuracy of the<br>
workpiece receptacle 5 is. The receptacle axis C and the workpiece axis D need<br>
not intersect one another at all; that is, they can be skewed relative to one<br>
another. Upon a rotation of the blank 7 about the receptacle axis C, the blank 7<br>
executes a tumbling motion.<br>
The machine control unit 6 has a measurement module 8,<br>
to which one or more measuring tracers 9 (Fig. 3) or other<br>
measuring means belong that are capable of detecting the<br>
position of the blank 7. If tracers 9 are used, they serve<br>
for instance, during one or more revolutions of the blank 7,<br>
to trace the blank on its outer circumference, or in other<br>
words its jacket face, for instance at various points. It is<br>
for instance possible to trace a blank at three or more<br>
points on its circumference, by providing that from one<br>
tracing operation to another it is rotated in each case about<br>
a fixed angular amount about the receptacle axis C and then<br>
traced again. If the tracing operation is done over multiple<br>
rotations, periodic errors whose period extends over a<br>
plurality of revolutions of the blank and which originate for<br>
instance in the drive gear or in ball bearings, can also be<br>
detected. The measurement module 8 also includes an<br>
evaluation program, which on the basis of new measurement<br>
points obtained draws a conclusion about the location of the<br>
workpiece axis D. The tracing operations may, as indicated by<br>
dashed lines in Fig. 3, be performed at a plurality of places<br>
spaced apart axially from one another with respect to the<br>
receptacle axis C.<br>
The measurement module 8 also serves, on the basis of<br>
the measurement values obtained, to draw a conclusion about<br>
the eccentricity and the misalignment with which the blank 7<br>
is held relative to the receptacle axis C. The eccentricity<br>
and the misalignment can be described by vectors x0, r0, as<br>
are shown greatly exaggerated in Fig. 4. The blank 7 is<br>
adjusted in a skewed fashion to the receptacle axis C. The<br>
concentricity error is described by an orientation vector ro,<br>
which is located parallel to the center axis of the blank 7<br>
or some other workpiece, and a further vector x0, which<br>
describes the offset of the workpiece fr0m the ideal<br>
position. The vectors x0, r0 ascertained by the measurement<br>
module 8 are transferred to a computation module 11, with<br>
which the coordinates of the workpiece or blank 7 are<br>
converted fr0m a workpiece-specific coordinate system into<br>
the machine coordinate system X, Y, Z, B, C. In addition to<br>
the usual transformation T with which a given point PW in the<br>
tool coordinate system is to be converted into a point PM in<br>
the machine coordinate system if no tumbling motion is<br>
occurring, or in other words, when the vector r0 has the same<br>
direction as the receptacle axis C and when the vector x0<br>
disappears (is zer0), the transformation Tnew now takes into<br>
account the vectors x0/ r0 (Tnew (T, x0, r0) ) as well. The<br>
computation module, which may be formed by a pr0gram running<br>
in the machine contr0l unit 6, receives data or commands fr0m<br>
a contr0l module 12 that can be considered as positioning<br>
commands for the individual guide motors associated with the<br>
axes X, Y, Z, B and C. These contr0l commands are modified by<br>
the computation module 11 and sent onward, as corrected<br>
contr0l commands, to the drive mechanisms 14.<br>
The tool grinding machine described thus far functions<br>
as follows:<br>
For machining a workpiece, or in other words for<br>
pr0ducing a tool fr0m a blank 7, first the blank 7 is clamped<br>
in the workpiece receptacle 5 and measured in it. To that<br>
end, the computation module 11 initially triggers the<br>
appr0priate drive mechanism of the tool holder 4 such that<br>
the blank 7 is r0tated in increments about the receptacle<br>
axis C. The tracer 9, which may be connected to the grinding<br>
head 3 or guided in some other way, traces the jacket face of<br>
the blank 7 at various places in the same axial position and<br>
furnishes the corresponding measurement values to the<br>
computation module 11. After at least one but preferably a<br>
plurality of revolutions of the blank 7, the tracer 9 is<br>
axially adjusted, in order to trace the blank 7 again along<br>
its circumference. To that end, the computation module 11<br>
causes the blank 7 to r0tate onward in increments. If needed,<br>
the blank 7 can be traced at further places.<br>
Once the at least two axially spaced-apart annular<br>
regions of the blank 7 have been traced, then fr0m that, the<br>
measurement module 8 or the computation module 9 calculates<br>
the vectors x0, r0, which characterize the eccentricity and<br>
the misorientation of the blank 7. The two vectors x0, r0 are<br>
then kept in readiness individually for the workpiece or<br>
blank 7 that has just been measured and are further used for<br>
transforming the workpiece-related coordinates into the<br>
machine-related coordinates.<br>
If the blank 7 is then to be machined in a grinding<br>
machining operation, as indicated in Fig. 2, and if a<br>
cylindrical face is for instance to be created, then the<br>
grinding head 3 is br0ught as Fig. 2 shows to the blank 7.<br>
For creating the cylindrical face, the blank 7 is r0tated<br>
about the receptacle axis C while the grinding wheel 15 is in<br>
engagement with it. The wobble runout of the blank 7 has been<br>
determined in the previous measurement operation and stored<br>
in memory by the machine contr0l unit 6. The contr0l unit now<br>
takes the wobble runout into account in triggering the<br>
grinding head 3, so that the grinding head executes a<br>
recipr0cating motion, as indicated by the arr0w 16 in Fig. 2.<br>
The motion is adapted such that the circle on the blank 7<br>
described by the point of contact between the grinding wheel<br>
15 and the circumference of the blank 7 is located<br>
concentrically to its workpiece axis D. It is therefore<br>
possible, regardless of clamping inaccuracies on the part of<br>
the workpiece receptacle 15, to create cylindrical faces on<br>
the blank 7 which are concentric and dimensionally accurate<br>
relative to the workpiece axis D.<br>
Other surfaces, such as flanks, faces, and cutting<br>
edges, can also be created symmetrically and precisely<br>
relative to the location of the workpiece axis D.<br>
A tool grinding machine 1 has a machine contr0l unit 6,<br>
which by means of a suitable measuring device, which for<br>
instance comprises a tracer 9 and a measuring module 8, first<br>
determines the wobble runout with respect to the ideal<br>
receptacle axis C of a workpiece receptacle. In the grinding<br>
machining of the blank 7 or a workpiece, this wobble runout<br>
is taken into account and compensated for; that is, the<br>
grinding tools are made to track a tumbling workpiece in such<br>
a way that the workpiece is machined to the exact intended<br>
dimensions and concentrically.<br>

8. A method for controlling a grinding machine, in particular a tool grinding<br>
machine (1), comprising the steps of:<br>
- receiving an elongated rotationally symmetrical blank (7) or a<br>
workpiece (7) in a workpiece receptacle (5);<br>
- rotating the workpiece receptacle (5) in a rotary positioning device<br>
about a predetermined receptacle axis (C ), the rotary positioning<br>
device having a rotary position detection means, which are<br>
connected to the workpiece receptacle (5);<br>
- providing a grinding head (3), which has a rotary drive mechanism<br>
and carries at least one grinding tool (15);<br>
- effecting a relative motion between the grinding tool (15) and the<br>
blank (7) or workpiece (7) in a positioning device (14), which is<br>
connected to the workpiece receptacle (5) and/or to the grinding<br>
head (3);<br>
- determining the eccentricity and the misalignment of the blank (7)<br>
or workpiece (7) with respect to the receptacle axis (C) in a<br>
measuring device (8,9);<br>
- determining control commands for the positioning device (14), in a<br>
machine control unit (6), connected to the rotary positioning<br>
device, the rotary position detection device, the positioning device,<br>
and the measuring device, and having a computation module (11),<br>
taking into consideration the alignment error and the eccentricity in<br>
order to cause the grinding tools (15) to track an unsteady<br>
workpiece (7) so that the workpiece (7) is machined concentrically<br>
and to the correct dimension.<br>
9. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the workpiece or blank is<br>
traced at a plurality of places spaced apart from one another in the axial<br>
direction by means of at least one measuring tracer allocated to the<br>
measuring device.<br>
lO.The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the workpiece or blank is<br>
traced at a plurality of places spaced apart from one another in the<br>
circumferential direction.<br>
11.The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the workpiece is rotated step<br>
by step for measuring the eccentricity and the misalignment of the<br>
workpiece, and during the process it is traced initially in a first axial<br>
position and then in at least one other axial position.<br>
12. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein two vectors (x0, ro) are<br>
determined from the measurement values obtained by means of the<br>
computation module, which vectors characterize the amount of deviation<br>
of the workpiece axis from the receptacle axis and the orientation of the<br>
workpiece axis relative to the receptacle axis.<br>
13.The method as recited in claim 13, characterized in that the computation<br>
module converts the workpiece coordinates, in the course of a coordinate<br>
transformation, into machine coordinates and in this transformation takes<br>
the vectors (x0, ro) into account.<br>
14.The method as recited in claim 8, characterized in that the determination<br>
of the eccentricity and the misalignment is done on the basis of the<br>
determination of the vectors after each clamping operation, in which a<br>
workpiece or blank has been clamped in the workpiece receptacle.<br>
