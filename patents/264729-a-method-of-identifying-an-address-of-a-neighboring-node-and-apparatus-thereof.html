DISCOVERY OF NEIGHBOR CELLS BACKGROUND<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application titled "Discovery<br>
of Neighbor Cells in E-UTRAN," filed June 20, 2006 and assigned provisional patent application no. 60/815,290, the entire disclosure of this application beii^ considered part of the disclosure of this application.<br>
Field<br>
[0002]	The  present  application pertains  generally to  communications,  and  more<br>
specifically, to discovery of neighbor cells in E-UTRAN.<br>
Background<br>
{0003J	In the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE),<br>
network nodes have a logical connection to each other over an IP transport. In the decentralized architecture. Node B may be considered to be attached to the network in a "plug-n-play" manner, wherein Node B self-configures operation parameters. It is expected that Node B will use information provided by user equipment (UE). Then the Node B may establish an association with the neighbor cells. However, in the prior art, the UEs do not know the IP addresses of those neighboring cells, the UEs just provide a cell ID.<br>
[0004]	Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is one of the third-<br>
generation (3G) mobile telephone technologies (or 3rd Generation Wireless Mobile Communication Technology). A UMTS network consist of 1) a core network (CN), 2) a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) and 3} user equipment (UE). The core network work provides routing, switching, and transit for user traffic. A Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is the basic core network architecture that UMTS is based on. The UTRAN provides the air interface access method for User Equipment. A base station is referred as Node B and control equipment for Node Bs is called a radio network controller (RNC). For an air interface, UMTS most commonly uses a wideband spread-spectrum<br><br>
mobile air interface known as wideband code division multiple access (or W-CDMA). W-CDMA uses a direct sequence code division multiple access signaling method (or CDMA) to separate users.<br>
{0005J	A UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) is a collective term for<br>
the Node Bs (or base stations) and the control equipment for the Node Bs (or radio network controllers (RNC)) it contains which make up the UMTS radio access network. This is a 3G communications network which can carry both real-time circuit switched and IP based packet switched traffic types. The RNC provides control functionalities for one or more Node Bs. Connectivity is provided between the UE (user equipment) and the core network by the UTRAN.<br>
[0006]	The UTRAN is connected internally or externally to other functional entities by<br>
four interfaces: lu, Uu, lub and lur. The UTRAN is attached to a GSM core network via an external interface called lu. A radio network controller (RNC) supports this interface. In addition, RNC manages a set of base stations called Node Bs through interfaces labeled Tub. The lur interface connects two RNCs with each other. The UTRAN is largely autonomous from the core network since the RNCs are interconnected by the lur interface. FIG. 1 discloses a communication system which uses the RNC, the Node Bs and the lu and Uu interfaces. The Uu is also external, coimects the Node B with the UE, while the Tub is an intemal interface connecting the RNC with the Node B.<br>
[0007]	The RNC fills multiple roles. First, it may control the admission of new mobiles<br>
or services attempting to use the Node B. Second, from the Node B, i.e. base station, point of view, the RNC is a controlling RNC. Controlling admission ensures that mobiles are allocated radio resources (bandwidth and signal/noise ratio) up to what the network has available. It is where Node B's lub interface terminates. From the UE, i.e. mobile, point of view, the RNC acts as a serving RNC in which it terminates the mobile's link layer communications. From the core network point of view, the serving RNC terminates the lu for the UE. The serving RNC also controls the admission of new mobiles or services attempting to use the core network over its lu interface.<br>
[0008]	Cell searching is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and frequency<br>
synchronization with a cell and detects the cell ID of that cell. Two signals ("channels") transmitted in the downlink, the "SCH" (Synchronization Channel) and "BCH" (Broadcast Channel) may be used in a universal terrestrial radio access (or UTRA) cell<br><br>
search. In the UMTS system, UTRA identifies the time division duplex (TDD) and the frequency division duplex (FDD) access mode. The primary purpose of the SCH is to acquire the timing, i.e., at least the SCH symbol timing, and frequency of the received downlink signal. The BCH broadcasts a set of cell and/or system-specific information which may be similar to the current UTRA BCH transport channel. Aside from the SCH symbol timing and frequency information, the UE acquires cell-specific information such as the cell ID. To facilitate cell ID detection, the cell ID may be embedded into the SCH. For example, the cell ID may be directly mapped into the SCH, or different cell ID information may be group-wised. For the case of group ID, cell ID group index can be detected using the SCH, and the cell IDs within the detected cell ID group can be detected using reference symbols or the BCH. As an alternative approach, information regarding the BCH bandwidth and CP length may be detected by blind detection from the SCH or BCH, by using hypothesis testing for example. FIG. 2 is a flowchart disclosing the basic cell search procedure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodhnents.<br>
[0024]	The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended<br>
drawings is intended as a description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the present invention can be practiced. The term "exemplary" used throughout this description means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration," and should not necessarily be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the present invention.<br>
[0025]	Communication systems may use a single carrier frequency or multiple carrier<br>
frequencies. Each link may incorporate a different number of carrier frequencies. Furthermore, an access terminal 10 may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal 10 may be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or wireline phone. The access terminal 10 is also known as user equipment (UE), a remote station, a mobile station or a subscriber station. Also, the UE 10 may be mobile or stationary. An example of a cellular communication system 100 is shown in FIG. 3 where reference numerals 102A to 102G refer to cells, reference numerals 20A to 20G refer to Node Bs or evolved Node Bs (eNode Bs) or base stations and reference numerals 1OA to 1OG refer to UEs.<br>
[0026]	FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a communication system 100 having a 3GPP<br>
LTE/SAE architecture which uses an evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN). User equipment 10 may communicate with one or more eNode Bs 20 by transmitting and receiving data packets through one or more eNodeBs 20. Unlike the UTRAN discussed above, there is<br><br>
no radio network controller 65 (also referred to as a base station controller (BSC) 65 or modem pool controller (MFC) 65). Instead, all radio-related fimctions are in the cNode Bs 20. Another difference is found in the core network 44 which is comprised of an IP network operably connected to one or more evolved packet cores (EPC) 49. As shown in FIG. 4, the evolved packet cores 49 may be connected to each other and to individual or many eNode Bs 20. These multiple connections minimize single points of failure above the eNode Bs 20. Also, the eNode Bs 20 may be connected to each other.<br>
10027]	An access network 40 transports data packets between multiple access terminals<br>
10 or user equipment 10. The access network 40 may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network 40, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each user equipment 10 and such outside networks 122. User equipment 10 that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more eNode Bs 20 is called active user equipment 10, and is said to be in a traffic state. User equipment 10 that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more eNode Bs 20 is said to be in a connection setup state. User equipment 10 may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or " through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. The communication link through which the user equipment 10 sends signals to the eNode B 20 is called a reverse link. The communication Jink through which an eNodeB 20 sends signals to a user equipment 10 is called a forward link.<br>
[0028]	A goal with current E-UTRAN systems is to minimize operational efforts for E-<br>
UTRAN system setup. To deploy LTE quickly and in a cost effective manner, the LTE/SAE system supports automatic installation and setup of newly deployed nodes 20 (eNode Bs) in a plug-and-play manner. Plug and play (PnP) is a computer feature that allows the addition of a new device, such as a peripheral, without reconfiguring the system or manually installing the device drivers. There seem to be two elements in the concept of "plug-and-play" eNode B 20: 1) Discovery of other nodes and session establishment to discovered nodes 20; and 2) Self-configuration of operational parameters by an eNode B 20. Self-configuration includes the configuration of a neighbor list 45 maintained by an eNode B 20. The neighbor list 45 may be constructed over time through radio measurements performed by UEs 10 on the E-UTRAN. Self-configuration of the neighbor list 45 in LTE network where the concept of the plug-n-play eNode B 20 is used might be based on a number of methods such as measuring RF<br><br>
on the E-UTRAN, and potentially other supported radio access technologies (RATs), and querying neighbor cell 102 related information via the backbone from the system or via neighbor eNode Bs 20, etc.<br>
[0029]	To hand over control of user equipment 10 from a source (or serving) eNode B<br>
20 to a target eNode B 20, the source eNode B 20 uses a connection/association with the target eNode B 20. A measurement report may be used to assist in the handover. (The term handoff (or handover) involves transferring an ongoing call or data session from one node 20 connected to the core network 44 to another node 20. The nodes 20 may be in different cells 102, different sectors of the same cell 102, or sometimes within the same cell 102. A handover may occur if user equipment 10 receives a stronger signal (e.g., better metric performance such as signal-to-noise ratio) from another node 20. Another reason for a handover is if a current node 20 Is fulL) The UE 10 continuously monitors neighboring cells 102 to determine which may become a candidate cell 102 for handover. The UE 10 then generates a measurement report using a cell ID which identifies a candidate cell 102 for handover and sends the measurement report to the source eNode B 20 which is currently serving the UE 10. Put another way, the source eNode B 20 is currently serving the cell 102 in which the UE 10 is located. (The cell ID may represent the candidate cell's 102 geographical location). One problem in the prior art is that the serving (or source) eNode B 20 may not know the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the neighboring or target eNode B 20 of the candidate cell 102 identified in the measurement report. It is desirable for a source eNode B 20 to know the contact point (IP address) of the neighboring or target eNode B 20 of the cell 102 identified by a cell ID reported by the UE 10. The present patent application addresses this issue. The following is a disclosure of the methods and apparatuses to solve this problem and obtain the IP address of the target eNode B 20.<br>
[0030]	In the LTE where IP transport is used among the eNode Bs 20 in the core<br>
network 44 and the RAN 40, multicast IP transport and unicast IP transport are available for nodes 20 to communicate with each other. IP multicast is used by a network node 20 to send a message to all the nodes 20 participating in a multicast group IP address. Unicast is used when a network node 20 wants to talk to a particular node 20 for which a unicast IP address is known.<br>
[0031]	Targeted Discovery with Cell ID<br>
[0032]	Unicast Option<br><br>
[0033]	Both imicast  and  multicast transmissions  may  be  used to  inquire  about<br>
information of the target eNode B 20 from other nodes 20 or servers 30.  The unicast option can be used when the source eNode B 20 knows a node 20 or server 30 that may have information for the target eNode B 20.   One example is a network 40 where the operator deploys servers/databases 30 that have a mapping database containing cell IDs and IP addresses of eNode Bs 20. In one example, this mapping database is referred to as a neighbor list 45.   Thus, the source eNodes 20 are capable of evaluating an IP address of a target node 20 from a neighbor list 45 via the E-UTRAN network 40 (neighbor eNode Bs 20, server 30, other entity). This is illustrated in FIG. 5. In FIG. 5, the UE 10 finds a cell ID of a candidate cell 102 that a neighboring eNode B 20 is serving (step 205). In step 210, the measurement report containing the cell ID is sent to the source eNode B 20 (step 210). In step 220, the source eNode B 20 sends a unicast -inquiry containing the cell ID to server 30 inquiring what the IP address of the neighboring eNode B 20 is.    In step 230, the server/database 30 sends an inquiry ■. response as a unicast transmission back to the source eNode B 20 containing the IP address of the target (or in this case, neighboring) eNode B 20.   In step 240, source. eNode B 20 sends a connection establishment message to the target or neighboring -eNode B 20. In step 250, an association is established between the source eNode B 20 and the target or neighboring eNode B 20.<br>
[0034]	Multicast Option<br>
[0035]	The multicast option may be used when the eNode B 20 would like to collect the<br>
information from neighbor nodes 20. The eNode B 20 sends an inquiry message containing the cell ID of the target cell 102. Other nodes 20 that received the message respond with required information if they are aware of the eNode B 20 associated with the target cell 102. Here, the other nodes 20 contain a mapping database for cell IDs and IP addresses of eNode Bs 20. If a neighboring node 20 knows the cell ID of the UE 10, the neighboring node 20 may know the IP address of the eNode B 20 serving that cell 102. The eNode B 20 inquiry contains the cell ID and is multicast to neighboring cells 102. The response is sent back by a neighboring node 20 which knows the IP address of the UE 10 as a unicast message to the requesting E Node B 20.<br>
[0036]	Here, rather than configuring the information about each neighboring eNode B<br>
in servers/databases 30 that have a mapping database for cell IDs and IP addresses of eNode Bs 20 serving those cells 102, the radio access network 40 discovery protocols<br><br>
can be used to gather the information from the neighboring transceivers or nodes 20. Nodes 20 may be configured with sufficient information about neighboring eNode Bs 20 (eg., cell IDs and IP addresses) and the IP addresses are gathered from the neighboring node 20 using discovery protoco](s).<br>
(0037]	This interaction is illustrated in the following call flow shown in FIG. 6.   The<br>
eNode B2 (20) (target eNode B) is a neighbor of eNode Bl (20) (source eNode B). ENode B3 (20) is provisioned with a Neighbor List 45 that includes the IP address of eNode B2 (20) and the cell ID of the geographic location (or cell 102) served by said eNode 32 (20). The 'Neighbor List Manager' 50 shown in the FIG. 6 is a logical entity that is responsible for gathering information from neighboring eNode Bs 20. Thus, the eNode Bs 20 are capable of evaluating an IP address of a serving node 20 &amp;om a neighbor list 45 via neighbor eNode Bs 20,"<br>
[0038]	In FIG. 6, the UE 10 finds a cell ID of a candidate cell 102 that a neighboring<br>
eNode B 20 is serving (step 305). In step 310, the measurement report containing the cell ID is sent to a source eNode B 20 (step 310). In step 320, the source eNode B 20 sends a multicast inquiry containing the cell ID to surrounding eNode Bs 20 that are radio base stations or on the access gateway (AGW) inquiring what the IP address of the neighboring eNode B 20 is. In step 330, one of the eNode Bs 20 containing a neighbor list 45 that are radio base stations or on the access gateway (AGW) sends an inquiry response as a unicast transmission back to the source eNode B 20 containing the IP address of the target (or neighboring) eNode B 20. In step 340, source eNode B 20 sends a coimection establishment message to neighboring eNode B 20. In step 350, an association is established between the source eNode B 20 and the target (or neighboring) eNode B 20.<br>
[0039]	FIG. 7 is detailed herein below, wherein specifically, an eNode B 20 and radio<br>
network controller 65 interface with a packet network interface 146. Radio network controller 65 includes a channel scheduler 132 for hnplementing a scheduling algorithm for transmissions in system 100. The channel scheduler 132 determines the length of a service interval during which data is to be transmitted to any particular remote station 10 based upon the remote station's 10 associated instantaneous rate for receiving data (as indicated in the most recently received DRC signal). The service interval may not be contiguous in time but may occur once every n slots. According to one embodiment, the first portion of a packet is transmitted during a first slot at a first time and the second<br><br>
portion is transmitted 4 slots later at a subsequent time. Also, any subsequent portions of the packet are transmitted in multiple slots having a similar 4 slots spread, i.e., 4 slots apart from each other. According to an embodiment, the instantaneous rate of receiving data Ri determines the service interval length Li associated with a particular data queue.<br>
[0040]	In addition, the channel scheduler 132 selects the particular data queue for<br>
transmission. The associated quantity of data to be transmitted is then retrieved from a data queue 172 and provided to the channel element 168 for transmission to the remote station 10 associated with the data queue 172. As discussed below, the channel scheduler 132 selects the queue for providing the data, which is transmitted in a following service interval using information including the weight associated with each of the queues. The weight associated with the transmitted queue is then updated.<br>
[0041]	Radio network controller 65 interfaces with packet network interface 146, Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 148, and all eNode Bs 20 in the communication system 100 (only one eNode B.20 is shown in FIG. 6 for simplicity). Radio network controller 65 coordinates the communication between remote stations 10 in the communication system and other users connected to packet network interface 146 and PSTN 148. PSTN 148 interfaces with users through a standard telephone network (not shown in FIG. 7).<br>
[0042]	Radio network controller 65 contains many selector elements 136, although only<br>
one is shown in FIG. 7 for simplicity. Each selector element 136 is assigned to control communication between one or more base stations 20 and one remote station 10 (not shown). If selector element 136 has not been assigned to a given user equipment 10, call control processor 141 is informed of the need to page the remote station. Call control processor 141 then directs eNode B 20 to page the remote station 10.<br>
[0043]	Data source 122 contains a quantity of data, which is to be transmitted to a given<br>
remote station 10. Data source 122 provides the data to packet network interface 146. Packet network interface 146 receives the data and routes the data to the selector element 136. Selector element 136 then transmits the data to eNode B 20 in communication with the target remote station 10. In the exemplary embodiment, each eNode B 20 maintains a data queue 172, which stores the data to be transmitted to the remote station 10.<br>
[0044]	The data is transmitted in data packets from data queue 172 to chaimel element<br>
168.  In one example, on the forward link, a "data packet" refers to a quantity of data<br><br>
which is a maximum of 1024 bits and a quantity of data to be transmitted to a destination remote station within a predetermined "lime slot" (such as « 1,667 msec.). For each data packet, channel element 168 inserts the necessary control fields. In the exemplary embodiment, channel element 168 performs a cyclic redundancy check, CRC, encoding of the data packet and control fields and inserts a set of code tail bits. The data packet, control fields, CRC parity bits, and code tail bits comprise a formatted packet. In the exemplary embodiment, channel element 168 then encodes the formatted packet and interleaves (or reorders) the symbols within the encoded packet. In the exemplary embodiment, the interleaved packet is covered with a Walsh code, and spread with the short PNI and PNQ codes. The spread data is provided to RF unit 170 which quadrature modulates, filters, and amplifies the signal. The forward link signal is transmitted over the air through an antenna to the forward link.<br>
[0045]	At the user equipment 10, the forward link signal is received by an antenna and<br>
routed to a receiver. The receiver filters, amplifies, quadrature demodulates, and quantizes the signal. The digitized signal is provided to a demodulator (DEMOD) where it is despread with the short PNI and PNQ codes and decovered with the Walsh cover. The demodulated data is provided to a decoder which performs the inverse of the signal processing functions done at eNode B 20, specifically the de-interleaving, decoding, and CRC check functions. The decoded data is provided to a data sink.<br>
[0046]	The DRC signal transmitted by each remote station 10 travels through a reverse,<br>
link channel and is received at the base station 20 through a receive antenna coupled to -RP unit 170. In one example, the DRC information is demodulated in channel element 168 and provided to a channel scheduler 132 located in the radio network controller 65 or to a channel scheduler 174 located in the eNode B 20. In a first exemplary embodiment, the channel scheduler 132 is located in the eNode B 20. In an alternate embodiment, the charmel scheduler 132 is located in the radio network controller 65, and connects to all selector elements 136 within the radio network controller 65.<br>
