This patent application claims the priority of pending US patent<br>
application Serial No. 60/633,143 flied December 3, 2004, and incorporates ii<br>
in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to thermal paper with improved<br>
thermal properties, in particular, the present Invention relates to thermal<br>
paper containing a base layer that provides improved thermal insulating<br>
characteristics that in turn provide numerous advantages to the thermal<br>
paper.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermal printing systems use a thermal print element energized to<br>
heat specific and precise areas of a heat sensitive paper to provide an image<br>
of readable characters or graphics on the heat sensitive paper. The heat<br>
sensitive paper, also known as thermal paper, includes materlal(s) which is<br>
reactive to applied heat. The thermal paper is a self-contained system,<br>
referred to as direct thermal, wherein ink need not be applied. This is<br>
advantageous in that providing ink or a marking material to the writing<br>
instrument is not necessary.<br>
Thermal printing systems typically include point of sale (POS) devices,<br>
facsimile machines, adding machines, automated teller machines (ATMs),<br>
credit card machines, gas pump machines, electronic blackboards, and the<br>
like, While the aforementioned thermal printing systems are known and<br>
employed extensively in some fields, further exploitation is possible if image<br>
quality on thermal paper can be Improved.<br>
Some thermal papers produced by thermal printing systems suffer<br>
from low resolution of written image, limited time duration of an image<br>
(fading), deiicacy of thermal paper before printing (increasing care when<br>
handling, shipping, and storing), and the like.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order<br>
to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the Invention. This<br>
summary Is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended to<br>
neither identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the<br>
scope of the invention, Rather, the sole purpose of this summary Is to<br>
present some concepts of the Invention, in a simplified form as a prelude to<br>
the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter.<br>
The present invention provides a thermal paper composite precursor<br>
comprising (a) a substrate layer; and (b) a base layer positioned on the<br>
substrate layer, the base layer comprising a binder and at least one porosity<br>
Improver wherein the thermal paper composite precursor has a thermal<br>
tfffuslvlty that is at least about 2% less than the thermal effuslvlty of porosity<br>
improver-less thermal paper composite precursor.<br>
The present invention provides thermal paper containing a base layer<br>
that provides thermal insulating properties which mitigates heat transfer from<br>
the active layer to the substrate layer, Mitigating heat transfer results in<br>
printing, images of improved quality. The thermal insulating properties of the<br>
base layer also permit the use of decreased amounts of active layer<br>
materials, which are typically relatively expensive compared to other<br>
components of the thermal paper,<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to thermal paper containing a<br>
substrate layer; an active iayer containing image forming components; and a<br>
base layer positioned between the substrate layer and the active layer, the<br>
base layer containing a binder and a porosity improver having a specified<br>
thermal effuslvity. The specified thermal effusivity dictates, In part, the<br>
improved thermal Insulating properties of the thermal paper, The base iayer<br>
need not contain Image forming components, which are Included in the active<br>
layer,<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to making thermal paper<br>
involving forming a base iayer containing a binder and a porosity improver to<br>
improve thermal effuslvity over a substrate layer; and forming an active iayer<br>
containing Image forming components over the base layer.<br><br>
3<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to printing thermal paper<br>
containing a substrate layer, an active layer, and a base layer positioned<br>
between the substrate layer and the active layer, the base layer containing a<br>
binder and a porosity improver, involving applying localized heat using a<br>
thermal paper printer in the pattern of a desired image to form the desired<br>
image In the thermal paper.<br>
To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the<br>
invention comprises the features hereinafter fully described and particularly<br>
pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed<br>
 drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of<br>
the invention. These are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways<br>
in which the principles of the invention may be employed. Other objects,<br>
advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the<br>
following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction<br>
with the drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   phrase   "porosity   Improver-less   thermal   paper   composite<br>
precursor means a thermal paper composite precursor that does not contain<br>
at least one porosity improver in the base layer thereof,<br>
Generally speaking, thermal paper is coated with a base layer and a<br>
colorless formula (the active layer) which subsequently develops an image by<br>
the application of heat. When passing through an imaging device, precise<br>
measures of heat applied by a print head cause a reaction that creates an<br>
Image (typically biack or color) on the thermal paper. The base layer of the<br><br>
	4<br>
subject Invention is made so that it possesses a thermal effusivity that<br>
improves the quality and/or efficiency of thermal paper printing.<br>
Direct thermal imaging technology of the subject invention may employ<br>
a print head where heat generated Induces a release of ink in the active layer<br>
of thermal paper. This Is also known as direct thermal imaging technology<br>
and uses a thermal paper containing ink in a substantially colorless form in an<br>
active coating on the surface. Heat generated in the print head element<br>
transfers to the thermal paper and activates the ink system to develop an<br>
image. Thermal imaging technology may also employ a transfer ribbon in<br>
addition to the thermal paper. In this case, heat generated in a print head is<br>
transferred to a plastic ribbon, which in turn releases ink for deposition on the<br>
thermal paper. This is known as thermal transfer imaging as opposed to the<br>
subject of direct thermal imaging.<br>
Thermal paper typically has at least three layers: a substrate layer, an<br>
active layer for forming an image, and a base layer between the substrate<br>
layer and active layer. Thermal paper may optionally have one or more<br>
additional layers including a top coating layer (sometimes referred to as a<br>
protective layer) over the active layer, a backside barrier adjacent the<br>
substrate layer, image enhancing layers, or any other suitable layer to<br>
enhance performance and/or handling,<br>
The substrate layer is generally in sheet form. Thai is, the substrate<br>
layer is in the form of pages, webs, ribbons, tapes, belts, films, cards and the<br>
like. Sheet form indicates that the substrate layer has two large surface<br>
dimensions and a comparatively small thickness dimension. The substrate<br>
layer can be any of opaque, transparent, translucent, colored, and non-<br>
colored (white), Examples of substrate layer materials include paper,<br>
filamentous synthetic materials, and synthetic films such as cellophane and<br>
synthetic polymeric sheets (the synthetic films can be cast, extruded, or<br>
otherwise formed). In this sense, the word paper in the term thermal paper is<br>
not inherently limiting.<br>
The substrate layer is of sufficient basis weight to support at least an<br>
active layer and base layer, and optionally of sufficient basis weight to further<br>
support additional, optional layers such as a top coating layer and/or a<br><br>
backside barrier. In one embodiment, the substrate layer 'nas a basis weight<br>
of abou! 14 g/m2 or more and about 50 g/rn2 or less. In another 'embodiment,<br>
the substrate layer has a basis weight of about 30 g/m2 or more and about<br>
148 g/m2 or less. In yet another embodiment, the substrate layer has a<br>
thickness of about 40 microns or more and about 130 microns or less, in still<br>
yet another embodiment, the substrate layer has a thickness of about 20<br>
microns or more and about 80 microns or less.<br>
The active layer contains image forming components that become<br>
visible to the human eye or a machine reader after exposure to localized heat.<br>
The active layer contains one or more of a dye, chromogenic material,<br>
developer, Inert pigment, antioxldants, lubricants, polymeric binder, sensltlzer,<br>
stabilizer, wetting agents, and waxes. The active layer is sometimes referred<br>
to as a reactive or thermal layer.   The components of the active layer are<br>
typically uniformly distributed throughout the active layer,  Examples of dyes,<br>
chromogenlc materials, and Inert pigments include fluorescent, organic and<br>
inorganic pigments.   These compounds may lead to black-white printing or<br>
color printing.   Examples of developers include acidic developers such as<br>
acidic phenolic compounds and aromatic carboxyllo acids.    Examples of<br>
sensitizers include ether compounds such as aromatic ether compounds.<br>
One or more of any of the active layer components may or may not be<br>
microencapsulated,<br>
The active layer is of sufficient basis weight to provide a visible,<br>
detectable and/or desirable image on the thermal paper for an end user. In<br>
one embodiment, the active layer has a basis weight of about 1,5 g/m' or<br>
more and about 7,5 g/m2 or less. In another embodiment, the active layer<br>
has a basis weight of about 3 g/m2 or more and about 30 g/m2 or less, in yet<br>
another embodiment, the active layer has a basis weight of about 5 g/rnz or<br>
more and about 15 g/m2 or less, in still yet another embodiment, the active<br>
iayer has a thickness of about 1 micron or more and about 30 microns or<br>
less. In another embodiment, the active Saver has a thickness of about 5<br>
microns or more and about 20 microns or less.<br>
One of the advantages of the subject invention is that a smaller active<br>
layer (or less active layer components) is required in thermal paper of the<br><br>
6<br>
Invention compared to thermal paper that does not contain a base layer<br>
having specified thermal effusivity properties as described herein. Since the<br>
 active layer of thermal paper typically contains the most expensive<br>
components of the thermal paper, decreasing the size of the active layer Is a<br>
significant advantage associated with making the subject thermal paper.<br>
The base layer contains a binder and a porosity improver and has a<br>
specified thermal effusivlty as described herein. The base iayer may further<br>
and optionally contain a dispersant, wetting agent, and other additives, so<br>
long as the thermal effusivlty values are maintained. In one embodiment, the<br>
base layer does not contain image forming components; that Is, the base<br>
layer does not contain any of a dye, chromogenlc material, and/or organic<br>
and inorganic pigments,<br>
The base layer contains a sufficient amount of binder to hold the<br>
porosity improver. In one embodiment, the base layer contains about 5% by<br>
weight or more and about 95% by weight or less of binder. In another<br>
embodiment, the base layer contains about 15% by weight or more and about<br>
90% by weight or less of binder,<br>
Examples of binders Include water-soluble binders such as starches,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, gelatin,<br>
casein, polyviny) alcohol, modified polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate,<br>
acrylic amide/acrylic ester copolymer, acrylic amide/acrylic ester/methacrylic<br>
acid terpolymer, alkali salts of styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer, alkali<br>
salts of ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyviny! acetate, polyurethane,<br>
polyacryiic esters, styrene/butadlene copolymer, acrylontrile/butadiene<br>
copolymer, methyl aorylate/butadiene copolymer, ethylene/viny! acetate<br>
copolymer, and the like. Further examples of binders include polyester resin,<br>
vinyl chloride resin, polyurethane resin, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer,<br>
vinyl chlorideacrylonitrile copolymer, epoxy resin, nitrocellulose, and the like.<br>
The porosity improver of the subject invention has at least one of high<br>
surface area, high pore volume, narrow particle size distribution, and/or high<br>
porosity when assembled in a layer (and thus appear to possess a high pore<br>
volume), Examples of the porosity improver include one or more of calcined<br>
clays such as calcined kaolin, flash calcined kaolin, and calcined bentonlte,<br><br>
7<br>
acid treated bentonite, high surface area alumina, hydrated alumina,<br>
boehmite, flash calcined alumina trlhydrate (ATH), silica, silica gel, zeolites,<br>
zeotypes and other molecular sieves, clathrasils, micro-, meso- and macro-<br>
poroiis particles, alumina phosphates, metal alumina phosphates, mica,<br>
pillared clays and the like. These compounds are commercially available<br>
through a number of sources.<br>
The base layer may contain at least one porosity improver, at iaasl two<br>
porosity improvers, at 'east three porosity impi overs, and so on. The porosity<br>
improver contributes to the desirable thermal effuslvlty properties of the base<br>
layer. In one embodiment where at least two porosity Improvers are included<br>
in the base layer, one porosity Improver Is a calcined clay such as calcined<br>
kaolin and the other porosity improver Is one of an acid treated bentonite,<br>
high surface area alumina, hydrated alumina, flash calcined kaolin, flash<br>
calcined ATH, silica, silica gel, zeolite, micro-, meso- or macro-porous<br>
particle, alumina phosphate, molecular sieve, clathrasils, pillared clay,<br>
boehmite, mica or metal alumina phosphate.<br>
Other useful porosity improvers include zeolites, Zeolites and/or<br>
zeotypes, frequently also referred to as molecular sieves, are a ciass of<br>
micro- and mesoporous materials with 1, 2 or 3-D pore system and with a<br>
variety of compositions including silica, aluminosilicates (natural and<br>
traditional synthetic zeolites), alumlno-phosphates (ALPO's), silicon-<br>
aiuminophosphates (SAPO's) and many others. One of the key properties of<br>
these materials is that they (In many cases) reverslbly adsorb and desorb<br>
large quantities of structural water, and if they are stable in their dehydrated<br>
state, they will also reversibly adsorb and desorb other gas8s and vapors,<br>
This is possibis because of the micro- and mesoporous nature of their<br>
structure.<br>
The porosity in zeolites can be best described In terms of channels or<br>
cages connected by smaller windows. Depending on if and how these<br>
intersect, they create 1-, 2- or 3-dimenslona! pore system with pore diameters<br>
and pore openings ranging in size from about 2.5 angstroms to more than<br>
100 angstroms. As a result, they contain a non-negligible amount of pore<br>
volume In their structures and their densities are lower than those of their<br><br>
8<br>
non-porous or dense poiymorphs. In some instances they can be at least 50<br>
% less dense, The amount of porosity is most commonly described in terms<br>
of pore volume (cc/g), or framework density (FD), The reference FD of dense<br>
silica structure (quartz) is approximately 26.5. Table 1 shows examples ot<br>
some of the most common structures including their pore characteristics.<br><br>
For the porosity Improvers other than calcined clays, the porosity<br>
Improver of the subject invention has one or more of at least about 70% by<br>
weight of the particles have a size of 2 microns or less, at least about 50% by<br>
weight of the particles have a size of 1 micron or less, a surface area of at<br>
least about 10 m2/g, and a pore volume of at least about 0.1 cc/g. in another<br>
embodiment, the porosity improver of the subject invention (other than<br>
calcined clays) has one or more of at least about 80% by weight of the<br>
particles have a size of 2 microns or less, at least about 60% by weight of the<br>
particles have a size of 1 micron or less, a surface area of at least about 15<br>
m2/g, and a pore volume of at least about 0.2cc/g. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the porosity Improver of the subject invention (other than<br>
calcined clays) has one or more of at least about 90% by weight of the<br>
particles have a size of 2 microns or less, at least about 70% by weight.of the<br>
particles have a size of 1 micron or less, a surface area of at least about 20<br>
m2/g, and a pore volume of at least about 0.3 cc/g.<br>
Calcining destroys the crystallinity of hydrous kaolin or bentonlte, and<br>
renders the kaolin/clay substantially amorphous. Calcination typically occurs<br>
after heating at temperatures In the range from about 700 to about 1200 *C.<br><br>
9<br>
for a sufficient period of time, Commercial vertical and horizontal rotary<br>
calciners can be used to produce metakaolin, partially calcined kaolin, and/or<br>
calcined kaolin. Acid treatment involves contacting clay with an amount of a<br>
mineral acid to render the clay substantially amorphous,<br>
in one embodiment, calcined day of the subject invention has one or<br>
more of at least about 70% by weight of the particles have a size of 2 microns<br>
or less, at least about 50% by weight of the particles have a size of 1 micron<br>
or less, a surface area of at least about 5 m2/g, and a pore volume of at least<br>
about 0.1 cc/g, In yet another embodiment, calcined clay of the subject<br>
Invention has one or more of at least about 80% by weight of the particles<br>
have a size of 2 microns or less, at least about 60 % by weight of the particles<br>
have a size of 1 micron or less, a surface area of at least about 10 nVVg, and<br>
a pore volume of at least about 0.2 cc/g, In still yet another embodiment,<br>
calcined day of the subject Invention has one or more of at least about 90%<br>
by weight of the particles have a size of 2 microns or less, at ieast about 70%<br>
by weight of the particles have a size of 1 micron or less, a surface area of at<br>
least about 15 mz/g, and a pore volume of at least about 0,3 cc/g.<br>
As noted the non-calcined clay porosity Improver or the calcined clay<br>
porosity improver may have a pore volume of at ieast about 0.1 cc/g, at least<br>
about 0.2 cc/g, or at least about 0,3 cc/g. Alternatively, the non-calcined clay<br>
porosity improver or the calcined clay porosity Improver may have an<br>
equivalent pore volume of at least about 0.1 cc/g, at least about 0,2 cc/g, or at<br>
least about 0,3 cc/g, in this connection, while the individual porosity Improver<br>
particles may not have the required pore volume, when assembled in a layer,<br>
the porosity Improver particles may form a resultant structure (base layer) that<br>
is porous, and has the porosity as if the layer was made of a porosity<br>
Improver having a pore volume of at least about 0.1 cc/g, at least about 0,2<br>
cc/g, or at least about 0.3 cc/g. That is, the base layer may having a pore<br>
volume of at ieast about 0,1 cc/g, at ieast about 0,2 cc/g, or at least about<br>
0.3 cc/g. Thus, the porosity Improver may be porous in and of Itself, or It may<br>
enhance the porosity of the base layer,<br>
Surface area is determined by the art recognized BET method using N2<br><br>
as the adsorbate. Surface area alternatively is determined using Gardner<br>
Coleman Oil Absorption Test and is based on ASTM D-1483-84 which<br>
measures grams of oil absorbed per 100 grams of kaolin. Pore volume or<br>
porosity Is measured by standard Mercury Porosimetry techniques.<br>
Ail particle sizes referred to heteln are determined by a conventional<br>
sedimentation technique using a Micromeritics, Inc.'s SEDIGRAPH® 5100<br>
analyzer, The sizes, in microns, are reported as "e.s.d," (equivalent spherical<br>
diameter). Particles are slurried in water with a dispersant and pumped<br>
through the detector with agitation to disperse loos© agglomerates,<br>
Examples of commercially available calcined clay of the subject<br>
invention include those under the trade designations such as Ansllex® such<br>
as Ansllex® 93, Satlntons®, and Translink®, available from Hngelhard<br>
Corporation of lselln, New Jersey.<br>
The base layer contains a sufficient amount of a porosity improver to<br>
contribute to providing insulating properties, such as a beneficial thermal<br>
effusivity, that facilitate high quality image formation in the active layer. In<br>
one embodiment, the base layer contains about 5% by weight or more and<br>
about 95% by weight or less of a porosity improver, in another embodiment,<br>
the base layer contains about 15 % by weight or more and about 90% by<br>
weight or less of a porosity improver. In yet another embodiment, the base<br>
layer contains about 15% by weight or more and about 40% by weight or less<br>
of a porosity improver. Ths base layer is of sufficient basis weight to provide<br>
Insulating properties, such as a beneficial thermal effusivity, that facilitate high<br>
quality image formation In the active layer. In one embodiment, the base<br>
layer has a basis weight of about 1 g/m2 or more and about 50 g/m2 or less,<br>
In another embodiment, the base layer has a basis weight of about 3 g/m2 or<br>
more and about 40 g/m2 or less, in yet another embodiment, the base layer<br>
has a basis weight of about 5 g/m2 or more and about 30 g/mz or less., in still<br>
yet another embodiment,, the base layer has a basis weight of about 7 g/m or<br>
more and about 20 g/m2 or less, in another embodiment, the base layer has<br>
a thickness of about 0.5 microns or more and about 20 microns or less. In<br>
yet another embodiment, the base layer has a thickness of about 1 micron or<br>
more and about 10 microns or less. In another embodiment, the base layer<br><br>
11<br>
has a thickness of about 2 microns or more and about 7 microns or less.<br>
Another beneficial aspect of the base layer is the thickness uniformity<br>
achieved when formed across the substrate layer. In this connection, the<br>
thickness of the base layer does not vary by more than about twenty percent<br>
when selecting two random locations of the base layer for determining<br>
thickness.<br>
Each of the layers or coatings is applied to the thermal paper substrate<br>
by any suitable method, including coating optionally with a doctor blade,<br>
   rollers, air knife, spraying, extruding, laminating, printing, pressing, and the<br>
like.<br>
The thermal paper of the subject invention has one or more of the<br>
Improved properties of less active layer material required, enhanced Image<br>
intensity, enhanced image density, Improved base layer coating rheology,<br>
lower abrasion characteristics, and Improved thermal response, The porosity<br>
improver functions as a thermal insulator thereby facilitating reaction between<br>
the image forming components of the active layer providing a more intense,<br>
crisp image at lowered temperatures and/or faster imaging. That is, the<br>
porosity improver functions to Improve the heat Insulating properties In the<br>
thermal paper thereby Improving the efficiency of the active layer in forming<br>
an image.<br>
For thermal paper, thermal sensitivity is defined as the temperature at<br>
which the active layer of thermal paper produces an image of satisfactory<br>
Intensity. Background is defined as the amount of shade/coloration ot<br>
thermal paper before Imaging and/or in the unimaged areas of imaged<br>
thermal paper. The ability to maintain the thermal sensitivity of thermal paper<br>
while reducing the background shade/coloration is significant advantage of<br>
the subject invention, Beneficial increases In thermal response in the active<br>
iayer of thermal paper are achieved through the Incorporation of a porosity<br>
improver as described herein in the base layer.<br>
Comparing thermal papers with similar components, except that one<br>
(thermal of the subject invention) has at least one porosity Improver in the<br>
base layer, the thermal paper precursor of the subject invention has a thermal<br>
effuslvlty value that Is about 2% less than the thermal effusivity of porosity<br><br>
improver-less thermal paper composite precursor. The 2% includes a<br>
standard deviation of about 0.5-1 % observed in effusivity measurements of<br>
precursor sheets, in another embodiment, the thermal paper precursor of the<br>
subject invention has a thermal effusivity value that Is about 5% less than the<br>
thermal effusivity of porosity Improver-less thermal paper composite<br>
precursor. In another embodiment, the thermal paper precursor of the subject<br>
invention has a thermal effusivity value that is about 15% less than the<br>
thermal effusivity of porosity improver-less thermal paper composite<br>
 precursor.<br>
Thermal effusivity is a comprehensive measure for heat distribution<br>
across a given material. Thermal effusivity characterizes the thermal<br>
Impedance of matter (its ability to exchange thermal energy with<br>
surroundings). Specifically, thermal effusivity is a function of the density, heat<br>
capacity, and thermal conductivity. Thermal effusivity can be calculated by<br>
taking the square root of thermal conductivity (W/mK) times the density<br>
(kg/m3) times heat capacity (J/kgK). Thermal effusivity is a heat transfer<br>
property that dictates the interfacial temperature when two semi-infinite<br>
objects at different temperature touch.<br>
Thermal effusivity can be determined employing a Mathis Instruments<br>
TC-30 Thermal Conductivity Probe using a modified hot wire technique,<br>
operating under constant current conditions. The temperature of the heating<br>
element is monitored during sample testing, and changes In the temperature<br>
at the interface between the probe and sample surface, over the testing time,<br>
are continually measured,<br>
in one embodiment, the thermal effusivity (Ws1/2/m2K) of the substrate<br>
coated with base layer is about 450 or less. In another embodiment, the<br>
thermal effusivity of the substrate coated with base layer Is about 370 or less.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the thermal effusivity of the substrate coated with<br>
base layer is about 330 or less, in still yet another embodiment, the thermal<br>
effusivity of the substrate coated with base layer is about 300 or less.<br>
The subject invention can be further understood In connection with the<br>
drawings. Referring to Figure 1, a cross sectional view of a three layer<br>
construction of thermal paper 100 is shown.  A substrate layer 102 typically<br><br>
13<br>
contains a sheet of paper. On one side (the writing side or image side) of the<br>
substrate layer 102 Is a base layer 104. The combination of substrate layer<br>
102 and the base layer 104 is an example of the present thermal paper<br>
composite precursor.<br>
The thermal paper composite precursor car. be combined with an<br>
active layer 108 so that the base layer 104 is positioned between the<br>
substrate layer 102 and the active layer 106, This combination is an example<br>
of a thermal paper composite precursor. The base layer 104 contains a<br>
porosity improver in a binder and provides thermal insulating properties and<br>
prevents the transfer of thermal energy emanating from a thermal print head<br>
through the active layer 106 to the substrate layer 102 during the writing or<br>
imaging process, The base layer 104 also prevents the active layer 106<br>
materials from weeping Into the substrate layer 102. The active layer 106<br>
contains components that form an image In specific locations in response to<br>
the discrete delivery of heat or Infrared radiation from the thermal print head.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, a cross sectional view of a five layer construction<br>
of thermal paper 200 is shown, A substrate layer 202 contains a sheet of<br>
paper. On one side (the non-writing side or backside) of the substrate layer.<br>
202 is a backside barrier 204, The backside barrier 204 in some instances<br>
provides additional strength to the substrate layer 202 as well as prevents<br>
contamination of the substrate layer 202 that may creep to the writing side.<br>
On the other side (the writing side or Image side) of the substrate layer 202 is<br>
a base layer 206, an active layer 208, and a protective coat 210. The<br>
combination of substrate layer 202 and the base layer 206 is an example of<br>
the present thermal paper composite precursor. The base layer 206 is<br>
positioned between the substrate iayer 202 and the active layer 208. The<br>
base layer 206 contains a porosity improver In a binder and provides thermal<br>
insuiatmg properties and prevents the transfer of thermal energy emanating<br>
from a thermal print head through the active iayer 208 and protective coat 210<br>
to the substrate layer 202 during the writing or Imaging process. The active<br>
layer 208 contains components that form an image in specific locations in<br>
response to the discrete delivery of heat or infrared radiation from the thermal<br>
print head. The protective coat 210 Is transparent to the subsequently formed<br><br>
14<br>
image, and prevents loss of active layer 208 components due to abrasion with<br>
the thermal paper 200,<br>
Although not shown in the figures, the thermal paper structures may<br>
contain additional layers, and/or the thermal papor structures may contain<br>
additional base and active layers for specific applications. For example, the<br>
thermal paper structures may contain a base layer, optionally a backside<br>
barrier, three base layers alternating with three active layers, and a protective<br>
coating.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, a cross sectional view of a method 300 of<br>
imaging thermal paper is shown. Thermal paper containing a substrate layer<br>
302, a base layer 304 and an active layer 306 is subjected to a writing<br>
process. A thermal print head 308 from a writing machine (not shown) Is<br>
positioned near or in close proximity to the side of the thermal paper having<br>
the active layer 306. in some instances the thermal print head 308 may<br>
contact the thermal paper. Heat 310 is emitted, and the heat generates,<br>
induces, or otherwise causes and image 312 to appear in the active layer<br>
308. The temperature of the heat applied or required depends upon a<br>
number of factors including the identity of the image forming components In.<br>
the active layer. Since the base layer 304 is positioned between the<br>
substrate layer 302 and the active layer 306, the base layer 304 mitigates the<br>
transfer of thermal energy from the thermal print head 308 through the active<br>
layer 306 io the substrate layer 302 owing to its desirable thermal effusivity<br>
and thermal insulating properties.<br>
Thermal effusivity test method; Thermal properties of materials can be<br>
characterized by a number of characteristics, such as thermal conductivity,<br>
thermal dlffusivity and thermal effusivity. Thermal conductivity is a measure of<br>
the ability of material to conduct heat (W/mK). Thermal diffusMty measures<br>
the ability of a material to conduct thermal energy relative to its ability to store<br>
energy (mmz/s). Thermal effusivity is defined as the square root of the<br>
product of thermal conductivity (k), density (p) and heat capacity (cp) of a<br>
material (Ws1/2/m2K).<br>
Thermal insulating properties of the pigments of current invention were<br>
characterized using Mathls Instruments TC-30 direct thermal conductivity<br><br>
15<br>
instrument, by measuring thermal effusivities of coated substrates. No active<br>
coat was applied. Substrates were typically coated with 5-10 g/m2 of base<br>
layer containing the pigment, and then calendered to about the same<br>
smoothness of approximately 2 microns as determined by Print-Parker-Surf<br>
(PP3) roughness test, A sheet of the coated substrate was then cut into<br>
pieces large enough to cover the TC-30 detector. Although the orientation of<br>
the base coat with respect to the sensor (If kept constant), is not cruclal for<br>
obtaining useful data, orientation "towards the sensor" (as opposed to "away<br>
 from the sensor") is preferred and was used. To ensure that the heat wave<br>
does not penetrate the sample, about 5-10 pieces of coated substrate were<br>
layered in the test to increase the useful sample cross section. For each<br>
pigment, approximately 100 measurements were performed with optimized<br>
test times, regression start times and cool times, and to maximize the base-<br>
layer coat area subject to measurement, the bottom piece was removed and<br>
placed on top of the stack every 12 measurements. This aiso significantly<br>
improved precision of the measurement, Since any air pockets in-between the<br>
layers due to non-uniform surface roughness wiii have negative impact on<br>
accuracy and precision of the effusivity measurements, calendering is a very<br>
Important step in the sample preparation, Any differences In effusivities<br>
greater then the standard deviation of respective measurements, typically 0.5-<br>
1 %, can be considered real.<br>
As thermal effusivity values of substrates costed with base layer can vary<br>
depending on many parameters, Including the base-layer coat weight and Its<br>
formulation, nature of the substrate, temperature and humidity during<br>
measurement, calendering conditions, smoothness of the tested papers,<br>
instrument calibration etc., it is best to evaluate and rank pigments and their<br>
thermal properties on a comparative basis vs, control (does not contain<br>
porosity improver) rather than by using their absolute measured effusivity<br>
values.<br>
Inventive Example 1<br><br>
Two pigments coated as a base coat on a substrate layer and also<br>
coated with commercial active layer coat were evaluated for thermal effusivlty<br>
and image quality, respectively, to Illustrate the importance of the thermal<br>
Insulating properties of the base coat en the Image quality - both optical<br>
density and visual quality/uniformity. One of the pigments was a commercially<br>
available synthetic pigment - "Synthetic pigment", the other was a 100 %<br>
calcined kaolin pigment". Active coats on both papers were developed by-<br>
placing 3x3 Inch squares of each paper into an oven sat to 100 *C for 2 min.<br>
Thermal effustvities of substrate/base coat composites and their<br>
corresponding image quality evaluations are summarized in Table 2. The<br>
synthetic pigment gave lower effusivity and had higher optical density.<br>
Visually, It looked black and had very good image uniformity. Sample coated<br>
with calcined kaolin pigment showed higher effusivity and lower optical<br>
density. In visual evaluations, this sample looked gray with highly non-uniform<br>
appearance. Overall, the data indicate an inverse relationship between the<br>
thermal effusivity of the thermal paper precursor and the optical density of the<br>
finished thermal paper. Visual evaluation also shows better image quality for<br>
lower effusivity pigment.<br><br>
Inventive Example. 2<br>
Two pigments were prepared, coated on a thermal base paper,<br>
calendered to about the same PPS roughness of approximately 2μm and<br>
evaluated for thermal effusivity, Tnermal effusivities were measured on base<br>
paper/base coat composites at about 22 °C and about 40% RH using Mathls<br>
Instruments TC-30 thermal conductiviiy/effusivily analyzer.<br><br>
17<br>
These composite thermal paper precursor sheets were then coated<br>
with a commercial active coat and evaluated using Industry standard<br>
instrumentation for half energy optical density. The pigments Included<br>
commercial standard calcined kaolin and hydrous kaolin treated with sodium<br>
silicate (20 ibs/ton clay). Physical characteristics of these pigments and their<br>
coatings are summarized in Table 3, The hydrous kaolin treated with sodium<br>
silicate is referred to as treated hydrous kaolin In the remainder of this<br>
inventive Example 2,<br><br>
Thermal effuslvity of the calcined kaolin containing precursor was more<br>
than 5 % lower than that of the treated hydrous kaolin. This lowered effuslvity,<br>
as expected, provided improved print quality as measured by higher optical<br>
densities. The calcined kaolin showed about 8% Improvement In optical<br>
density compared to the treated hydrous kaolin. In the case of treated<br>
hydrous kaolin, thermal effuslvity of the thermal paper precursor was higher<br><br>
18<br>
than that of calcined kaolin, which in turn yielded worse optical density. One<br>
can conclude that lower thermal effusivity of the base coat layer, and thus of<br>
the thermal paper composite precursor, has a positive effect on the image<br>
quality of the final thermal paper.<br>
Inventive Example 3<br>
To illustrate the effect of porosity In the bass coat on the thermal<br>
effusivity of the thermal paper precursor, four pigments were prepared,<br>
coated on a thermal base paper, calendered to about the same PPS<br>
roughness of approximately 2μm and evaluated for thermal effusivity using<br>
Mathis Instruments TC-30 analyzer. The pigments included commercial<br>
calcined kaolin, blend of 80 parts of commercial calcined kaolin and 20 parts<br>
of commercially available silica zeolite Y - "80 kaoi!n/20 silicaY", blend of 90<br>
parts of commercial calcined kaolin and 10 parts of Engelhard made zeolite Y<br>
- "90 kaolin/10 zsoiiteY" and hydrous keoiin treated with sodium silicate (20<br>
lbs/ton clay) - "treated hydrous kaolin". The effusivities were measured on<br>
base paper/base coat composites at about 22°C and about 40% RH; the pore<br>
volumes in the base coat layers were obtained from mercury porosimetry.<br>
Physical characteristics of these pigments and their coatings are summarized<br>
in Table 5.<br><br>
Effusivity measurements of the composite sheets and pore volumes in their<br>
respective base coat layers are presented in Table 6.<br><br><br>
19<br>
Results show thai the thermal effusivity of the composite precursor is<br>
inversely proportional to the pore volume in the base coat layer I.e. that the<br>
composite sheet with the highest thermal effusivity has the lowest pore<br>
volume, and the composit© with the lowest effusivity contains highest pore<br>
volume. This also shows that the presence of a porosity improver In the base<br>
coat layer has a positive effect on its thermal properties, such that it reduces<br>
the thermal effusivity of the thermal paper composite precursor when<br>
compared to the same that does not contain a porosity improver. One can<br>
conclude that, a precursor containing a porosity Improver and having an<br>
increased pore volume In the base coat will posses lower thermal effusivity<br>
and thus will result in Improved image quality of the finished thermal paper.<br>
Inventive Example 4<br>
Two pigments were prepared and tested to demonstrate positive<br>
benefit of increased base coat layer porosity on thermal effusivity of the<br>
thermal paper precursor and on Image quality of the finished thermal paper.<br>
One pigment was a hydrous kaolin calcined to muilite Index of 35-55 -<br>
"Calcined clay", the second plgmQnt was a blend of 80 parts of commercial<br>
calcined kaolin and 20 parts of commercially available silica zeolite Y - "80<br>
kaolln/20 siiicaY". Both pigments were coated on a commercial thermal base<br>
paper, calendered to approximately the same PPS roughness of about 2μm,<br>
and evaluated for pore volumes and thermal effusivlties. Both effusivities and<br>
pore volumes were measured on respective thermal paper precursor sheets.<br><br>
20<br>
The sheets were also treated with a commercial active coat layer and tested<br>
using industry standard Instrumentation (Atlantek 200) for image density.<br>
Basic physical characteristics of both pigments and their base coatings are<br>
summarized in Table 7.<br><br>
The pore volume of the blended pigment was more than 5 % higher<br>
than that of the calcined day. This increased porosity of the blended pigment<br>
base coat in turn positively affected thermal effusivity of the full precursor,<br>
which was about 5 % lower compared to the calcined clay containing<br>
precursor. Most importantly, the image density of the blended pigment<br>
containing thermal paper was significantly improved. These results dearly<br>
show the benefit of the porosity improver in the base coat, its positive effect<br>
on the thermal effusivity of the precursor and Its 6trong positive impact on<br>
image quality of the finished thermal paper.<br><br>
