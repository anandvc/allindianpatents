FAT, WAX OR OIL-BASED FOOD INGREDIENT COMPRISING ENCAPSULATED FLAVORS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to the technical field of encapsulated<br>
flavors and to fat or oil-based food ingredients comprising encapsulated flavors. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a food or food ingredient comprising lipids<br>
and flavor-capsules. The present invention further relates to food products comprising, as<br>
a coating or a filling, the food ingredient.<br>
Background of the Invention and Problem to be Solved<br>
Flavor compounds include many small-sized, volatile and hydrophobic molecules,<br>
which tend to diappear from food products during the production, distribution or storage<br>
process by evaporation. Loss by evaporation of flavors can be reduced, for example, by<br>
using fats or oils as carriers for hydrophobic flavors, and, as a consequence, flavors are<br>
often applied to foods in the form of fat or oil-based coatings or fillings. However, flavors<br>
that are entrapped in a lipid matrix may not be released during consumption and are often<br>
swallowed together with fat droplets without interacting with the taste buds of the oral<br>
cavity. In this way, a substantial amount of flavor molecules is consumed without being<br>
perceived and the flavor profile of a food product comprising flavors dispersed in oil or<br>
fat may be poor despite high flavor load.<br>
On the other hand, complex encapsulation systems are often employed in order to<br>
provide high concentrations of flavors in a storage-stable and easily applicable way.<br>
However, a drawback of encapsulation of flavors is that the timely release of all<br>
encapsulated flavors during chewing in the oral cavity is difficult to control. Possibly,<br>
encapsulated flavors are not released from their encapsulation matrix and do thus not add<br>
to the flavor profile of a food product during consumption, but are swallowed in<br>
encapsulated form. Alternatively, flavors may be released too early from the<br>
encapsulation matrix and subsequently be lost through evaporation.<br>
The present invention addresses the problem of adding flavors to a food product in<br>
a way that flavors are not lost during manufacturing, distribution or storage of the food<br>
product. Importantly, loss of volatile flavors during manufacturing processes that involve<br>
above-ambient temperatures should be prevented. In addition, the present invention has<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
2<br>
the objective of providing flavors in a way such that the flavor perception and/or intensity<br>
during consumption is increased.<br>
A more specific objective of the present invention is to provide flavors within a<br>
lipid base in a way that the flavors, during chewing, are immediately released and come<br>
into contact with the taste buds of the oral cavity and do not remain bound to oils or fats<br>
of the lipid base.<br>
More particularly, an objective of the present invention is to provide flavor<br>
capsules that, when dispersed in a lipid base, for example an oil, are capable of retaining<br>
hydrophobic flavors within the capsules while preventing a release from the capsules into<br>
the lipid base.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to add flavors to a food product in a<br>
way that flavor intensity during consumption of the food product is increased compared to<br>
existing methods of adding flavors.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to stabilize flavors in food<br>
ingredients or foods having high quantities of fat or oil. In particular, evaporation of<br>
flavors needs to be prevented during the manufacture, storage or shelf life of this class of<br>
food products.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Remarkably, the inventors of the present invention found that if flavor-capsules<br>
based on a micro-organism, a matrix component and at least one flavor are mixed with a<br>
lipid and applied to a food product, for example by coating or filling of the food product<br>
with the lipid, even hydrophobic flavors are retained in the flavor-capsules and do not<br>
diffuse into the surrounding lipid environment. In this form, flavors remain encapsulated<br>
and evaporation of volatile flavors is prevented even if the lipid or the food product<br>
comprising the flavor-capsules is exposed to above-ambient temperatures, for example by<br>
heating, drying or baking.<br>
Surprisingly, the stable encapsulation of flavors in a lipid base is interrupted as<br>
soon as the capsules come in contact with water. Upon contact with water, or the saliva of<br>
the oral cavity, and in presence of lipids, the flavors are immediately released from the<br>
flavor capsules. Food products or food ingredients comprising lipids and further<br>
comprising flavor-capsules based on a micro-organism, a matrix component and at least<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
3<br>
one flavor provide a remarkable flavor impact or overall flavor intensity upon<br>
consumption.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides, in a first aspect, a food or food<br>
ingredient comprising a lipid phase and, dispersed in said lipid phase, flavor-capsules<br>
comprising a micro-organism, a matrix component and at least one encapsulated flavor.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a food product comprising a<br>
coating or a filling according to the present invention.<br>
In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a method for applying a<br>
flavor to a food product, and/or a method for preparing a food product, the method<br>
comprising the step of coating and/or filling a food product with the food ingredient of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention relates to a food or food ingredient comprising a lipid and,<br>
dispersed therein, flavor-capsules comprising a micro-organism, a matrix component and<br>
at least one encapsulated flavor compound.<br>
Within the context of this specification the word "comprises" is taken to mean<br>
"includes, among other things". It is not intended to be construed as "consists only of.<br>
Capsules comprising a micro-organism, a carbohydrate-component and at least<br>
one encapsulated flavor are disclosed in patent applications WO2005/067733A1 and<br>
WO2006/006003A1, which are completely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The term "flavor", in the context of the present invention, may refer to a single<br>
flavoring molecule, or to a composition comprising several flavoring agents. Preferably,<br>
the term flavor composition refers to a composition of at least two flavor compounds<br>
preferably having different logP values. More preferably, the composition comprises at<br>
least one flavor compound with logP &gt; 2 and/or at least one flavor compound with<br>
logP
The term logP refers to the octanol/water partition coefficient of a specific flavor<br>
compound to be encapsulated. For the purpose of the present invention, reference to a<br>
calculated logP (=clogP) value is made. This value is calculated by the software<br>
T. Suzuki, 1992, CHEMICALC 2, QCPE Program No 608, Department of Chemistry,<br>
Indiana University. See also T. J. Suzuki, Y. Kudo, J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design<br>
(1990), 4,155-198.<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
4<br>
The term "flavor" thus means a compound, which is used alone or in combination<br>
with other compounds, to impart a desired gustative effect. To be considered as a flavor,<br>
it must be recognized by a skilled person in the art as being able to modify in a desired<br>
way the taste of a composition. Such compositions are intended for oral consumption and<br>
are hence often foods, nutritional compositions and the like.<br>
The textbook "Perfume and Flavor Chemicals" Steffen Arctander, published by<br>
the author, 1969, is a collection of perfumes and flavors known to the skilled person and<br>
is expressly incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The molecules of this<br>
textbook are suitable for being encapsulated in the capsules of the present invention.<br>
The term flavor also includes compounds that are perceived by mediation of the<br>
trigeminal nerve, such as cooling, salivating, pungent and tingling compounds, for<br>
example.<br>
The term "flavor-capsules" or "capsules", for the purpose of the present invention,<br>
refers to capsules based on a micro-organism, a matrix component and at least one<br>
encapsulated flavor.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the capsules based on a<br>
micro-organism, a matrix component and at least one flavor are prepared by a process<br>
comprising the steps of<br>
a)	mixing yeast with water to obtain an aqueous mixture,<br>
b)	adding a flavor to the aqueous mixture,<br>
c)	stirring the aqueous mixture including the flavor until at least part of the flavor has<br>
passed into the micro-organism,<br>
d)	adding the matrix component to the aqueous mixture comprising the at least partly<br>
encapsulated flavor, and,<br>
e)	drying the resulting mixture.<br>
Steps a), b) and c) are familiar to the skilled person, for example from<br>
EP1454534A1, which discloses, in Example 1-6, the inclusion of flavorings into yeast<br>
cell bodies. Similarly, J. R. P. Bishop et al. "Microencapsulation in yeast cells",<br>
J. Microencapsulation, 1998, vol. 15, no. 6, 761-773, disclose the encapsulation of high<br>
concentrations of essential oils into bakers yeast. Accordingly, an aqueous suspension of<br>
yeast and oil is mixed, which allows the oil to pass freely through the cell wall and<br>
membrane and to remain passively within the cell.<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
5<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the micro-<br>
organism has an intact cell wall. Preferably, the micro-organism is a fungus or a bacterial<br>
micro-organism comprising a cell wall, more preferably it is a yeast cell. The cell wall of<br>
the micro-organism needs to be basically intact in order to effectively encapsulate and<br>
retain the flavors in the cells.<br>
In addition, preferably, the endogenous intracellular components are still present<br>
in the micro-organisms. In other words, the micro-organisms have preferably not been<br>
treated with protease and/or acid and/or base (OH) in order to elute or wash away<br>
intracellular components.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous mixture comprising the micro-organism and water is a<br>
suspension of 10-30%, preferably 15-25 wt.-% solids, depending on type of organism and<br>
equipment used.<br>
In the context of the present invention, percentages or parts are generally<br>
percentages or parts by weight of dry matter, unless otherwise indicated, for example by<br>
reference to aqueous solutions or percentages of solids, where the percentages refer to<br>
parts of the total solution, including water.<br>
According to step b), at least one flavor is added to the aqueous mixture. Of<br>
course, the flavor could also be added earlier, for example, together with the yeast and the<br>
water. The flavor is usually present in a hydrophobic solvent, such as an essential oil or a<br>
flavor dissolved in an oil, and, therefore, the addition of the flavor may entail the<br>
formation of an emulsion. Accordingly, emulsifiers, surfactants and/or stabilizers may<br>
also be added to the aqueous liquid, for example. Preferably, the dry-weight ratio of<br>
micro-organism to flavor in the aqueous liquid is in the range of 1:1 to 5:1, preferably<br>
1.4:1 to 4:1.<br>
According to step c) the aqueous mixture comprising the micro-organism, water<br>
and the material to be encapsulated is then stirred for 1 to 6 hours, preferably. Stirring, in<br>
the context of the present invention also refers to actions like agitating or mixing. After<br>
completion of step c), substantial amounts of the material to be encapsulated have passed<br>
through the cell wall into the micro-organisms. Accordingly, in an embodiment, the<br>
encapsulated flavor is present within the cell wall of the micro-organism.<br>
According to step d), the matrix component is added to the aqueous mixture. As is<br>
listed in WO2006/006003A1 a variety of possible matrix components may be used, which<br>
are all incorporated herein by reference. Accordingly, carbohydrates, proteins and other,<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
6<br>
for example film-forming materials can be used for providing a suitable matrix.<br>
Preferably, the matrix component comprises a carbohydrate, more preferably, the matrix<br>
component comprises at least 50wt.%, more preferably at least 80wt.% of carbohydrates.<br>
Preferably, the carbohydrate includes di-, oligo- and/or polysaccharides. Preferably, the<br>
carbohydrate forming the matrix component is water soluble. The term "water soluble"<br>
means that the carbohydrate is at least 50% soluble according to the method described by<br>
L. Prosky et al., J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. 71,1017-1023 (1988).<br>
Preferably, the matrix component comprises dextrin, more preferably maltodextrin<br>
and/or corn syrup. Most preferably, the matrix component comprises maltodextrin and/or<br>
corn starch syrup having a mean dextrose equivalence of 6-25, preferably 11-22, most<br>
preferably 12-20. With DE &gt; about 12 the maltodextrin is more suitable to also<br>
encapsulate hydrophilic flavors.<br>
The matrix component may also comprise starches, starch derived carbohydrates,<br>
dietary fibre, for example, which are preferably water-soluble. For example, the matrix<br>
component may comprise capsul®, a modified starch commercially obtainable form<br>
National Starch -Food Innovation (New Jersey, USA).<br>
Step e) of the process provides drying of the resulting mixture. Drying may be<br>
performed by spray drying, freeze drying, fluidized bed drying and/or oven drying, for<br>
example. Preferably, the drying step is performed by spray drying.<br>
Following steps a) to e) given above, dried flavor capsules based on a micro-<br>
organism, a matrix component and at least one encapsulated flavor may be provided.<br>
Preferably, the capsules essentially consist of a micro-organism, a matrix, and at least one<br>
flavor, the latter being located within the micro-organism and optionally also in the<br>
matrix. The matrix component generally forms a film or a further layer around the micro-<br>
organism. Preferably, the matrix component is located on the outside surface of the cell<br>
wall of the micro-organism.<br>
The flavor-capsules preferably comprise 8-25%, more preferably 12-24%, even<br>
more preferably 15-23%, and most preferably 18-22% by weight of encapsulated flavor.<br>
The flavor capsules based on a micro-organism and a matrix component as<br>
obtained above have substantial advantages over the prior art. In particular, they are<br>
advantageous over capsules devoid of a matrix component in that they are suitable to<br>
encapsulate flavor compositions comprising different flavor molecules having different<br>
hydrophobicity and/or hydrophilicity. In this event, the matrix component is suitable to<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
7<br>
withhold more hydrophilic flavors, while hydrophobic flavors are encapsulated within the<br>
yeast cell's plasma membrane, in particular, within the phospholipid bilayer. In this way,<br>
the capsules are suitable to provide a more rounded flavor profile than capsules based on<br>
encapsulated yeast only, for example.<br>
The food or food ingredient may be prepared by mixing the flavor capsules with<br>
the lipid, preferably until even dispersion of the capsules in the lipid matrix (=lipid phase)<br>
is obtained. If solid at room temperature, the lipid may be heated before addition of the<br>
capsules in the lipids. Ingredients other than lipids and flavor capsules, such as those<br>
mentioned below, for example, may be added at any stage before, during or after the step<br>
of mixing the lipid with the capsules.<br>
The food or food ingredient according to the present invention further comprises a<br>
lipid phase. The phase may comprise all kind of lipids, for example edible or food-grade<br>
fats, such as hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated fats, fatty acid esters, cacao butter and<br>
cacao butter replacers, oils and/or waxes, such as carnauba, hydrogenated castor oil,<br>
paraffin and the like, for example. The lipid may be solid at room temperature<br>
(RT=25°C), or it may be liquid at RT.<br>
The food ingredient may consist of lipids and the flavor-capsules, however, it<br>
often comprises other components. Therefore, in an embodiment, the food or food<br>
ingredient of the present invention comprises at least 5% by weight of lipids. Preferably it<br>
comprises at least 10% by weight of lipids, more preferably at least 20% or 30%, and<br>
most preferably at least 40% by weight of lipids. For example, the food or food ingredient<br>
of the present invention may comprise more than 50% or more than 60% by weight of<br>
lipids.<br>
The food or food ingredient may further comprise any kind of filler or food<br>
ingredient, if desired. For example, the food or food ingredient may comprise<br>
carbohydrates, proteins, oligo-peptides, amino acids, or other food-grade materials. For<br>
example, the food or food ingredient comprises modified carbohydrates, such as modified<br>
starches, fibres, and others, for example.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the food or food ingredient of the<br>
present invention further comprises sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, tagatose or other<br>
sweeteners. The term "other sweeteners" includes artificial sweetening agents, such as<br>
sucralose, acesulfeme K, aspartame, sodium saccharine, sodium cyclamate, and polyols<br>
such as glycerol, maltitol, lactitpl, sorbitol, xylitol, erythriol, for example.<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
8<br>
Preferably, the food or food ingredient of the present invention comprises<br>
-	5-99.99 wt.%, preferably 10-90.00 wt.% of a lipid,<br>
-	0.01-20 wt.%, preferably 0.5-10 wt.% of flavor capsules, and, optionally,<br>
-	0-80 wt.%, preferably 0.1-70 wt.% of further materials, with the exception of water.<br>
While the food or food ingredient of the present invention is not limitative as<br>
regards the presence of any possible filling or other food-grade material, it preferably<br>
contains small or no amounts of water. Surprisingly, the benefits of encapsulation,<br>
temperature-protection and release of the flavors in the food ingredient are related to the<br>
fact that there is little or no interaction of the flavor-capsules with water. In the presence<br>
of lipids and water, the cell wall of the capsules changes its structure and encapsulated<br>
flavors tend to be released quickly. The release of flavor is observed once the cell wall of<br>
the yeast in the capsules contains about 7-13 wt.% of water and gets in further contact<br>
with lipids. The concept of the present invention thus provides that the flavor is only<br>
released once the food or food ingredient is exposed to saliva in the oral cavity.<br>
Therefore, in an embodiment, the food or food ingredient of the present invention<br>
comprise less than 20% by weight of water. Preferably, it comprises less than 15%, more<br>
preferably less than 8%, even more preferably less than 7% and most preferably less than<br>
5% of water. Most preferably, the food ingredient of the present invention is substantially<br>
free of water.<br>
The preferably low water content of the food or food ingredient of the invention<br>
may also be expressed in terms of the water activity of the food or food ingredient (Aw).<br>
Preferably, the food or food ingredient of the present invention has a water activity Aw of<br>
less than 0.7, preferably less than 0.5, more preferably less than 0.3, most preferably<br>
below 0.2. Water activity is preferably measured with an Aqualab CX-2 apparatus<br>
(Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, Washington, USA, or, alternatively with a Novasina<br>
apparatus, type Aw Sprint RS50, obtainable in Switzerland). The apparatus is to be used<br>
according to the user's manual. In particular the thermostatic water bath connected to the<br>
apparatus is adjusted to 20°C. Start the procedure once the sample has been made<br>
thermostatic in the chamber foreseen for this. At the end of the procedure, check that<br>
temperature still is at 20 ±0.5 °C.<br>
While the food or food ingredient of the present invention has only little water as<br>
defined above, it may be used as a component in a more complex food product, which in<br>
turn contains more water, with the water being physically separated from the capsules in<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
9<br>
the food ingredient of the present invention. For example, one can envisage food<br>
products, which contain oil-in water emulsions with the food ingredient of the invention<br>
being the oily phase having the capsules dispersed in it, and thus protected from the<br>
aqueous part of the emulsion.<br>
For example, the food- or food ingredient, however, may be a product, which is<br>
manufactured to be stored in a dry form, but reconstituted with an aqueous liquid (water,<br>
milk, juice, for example) shortly before consumption. Shortly before consumption means<br>
about 1-5 hours or 0.1-59 minutes before consumption. Upon reconstitution, the flavors<br>
may be released from the capsules but are still available to the consumer because loss of<br>
flavors will be small in the short time until consumption. Examples of such products are<br>
powdered products, such as powdered soups, sauces, breakfast drinks, as mentioned<br>
below in more detail.<br>
With regard to the preferably low water content of the food or food ingredient of<br>
the present invention, the optional food grade materials (proteins, carbohydrates), which<br>
are other than lipids and flavored capsules, are preferably selected from those that do not<br>
attract and/or accumulate water from the ambient air, or, if they do, other materials having<br>
water accumulating capacity are preferably present in low amounts.<br>
An advantage of the flavor capsules in the food or food ingredient of the present<br>
invention are the efficient protection of flavor loss by evaporation or degradation in the<br>
presence of above-ambient temperatures. Surprisingly, generally volatile flavors remain<br>
encapsulated within the capsules based on a micro-organism and a matrix component<br>
even if the capsules are exposed to elevated temperatures up to 280°C.<br>
Therefore, in an embodiment of the present invention, the food or food ingredient<br>
is characterized in that it is subjected to a temperature of &gt;20°C during the manufacturing<br>
process. In another embodiment, the food or food ingredient is subjected to a temperature<br>
of &gt;80°C during the manufacturing process. Preferably, the food or food ingredient is<br>
subjected to temperatures of at least 30,40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 180, 200,<br>
220,250, or 270°C during the manufacturing process.<br>
The ambient temperatures defined above may be applied with any means used in<br>
food manufacturing.<br>
For example, the food ingredient may be heated to 30 to 80°C in order to facilitate<br>
dispersion of the flavor capsules within the lipids of the food ingredient. This procedure is<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
10<br>
particularly preferred if the lipid is a fat that is solid at room temperature, and heating will<br>
result in liquefying the fat, allowing easy mixing of the flavor capsules with the fat.<br>
Additionally, if the food ingredient of the present invention is combined with<br>
other food materials to prepare a final food product, the food ingredient comprising lipids<br>
and flavor capsules of the present invention may have to be heated in order to add it to the<br>
final food product. This is particularly the case with coating processes, where the coating<br>
material is heated or melted in order to apply it onto a food product. During a subsequent<br>
cooling step, the coating may solidify or congeal on the surface of the food product, for<br>
example.<br>
Furthermore, a food consumer end product comprising the food ingredient of the<br>
present invention may have to be heated after having been combined with the food<br>
ingredient, for example for the purpose of increasing palatability or for reducing germ<br>
load of the food product. The elevated temperature may thus include processes like<br>
melting, cooking, drying, frying, baking, toasting, pasteurizing, sterilizing, for example.<br>
These procedures are known to the skilled person and do not have to specified in more<br>
detail here. It is a particular advantage of the present invention that conventional food<br>
processing methods do not have to be modified due to the presence of the food ingredient<br>
of the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment, the food of the present invention is a confectionery, a spread, a<br>
fat filling, a fat coating, a spray coating, a wax coating, a chocolate coating, a spicing<br>
agent, a powdered nutritional composition, a shortening, a margarine, and/or a bakery<br>
dry-mix.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a food ingredient, which is<br>
a coating, filling, or the oily phase of an emulsion in food products. The food ingredient<br>
of the present invention has lipids as an essential component and is, therefore, particularly<br>
suitable as a filling or coating of any kind of food product.<br>
Accordingly, in an aspect, the present invention relates to a food product<br>
comprising, as a coating or filling, the food ingredient of the present invention.<br>
Clearly, the above-mentioned advantages in terms of temperature resistance of the<br>
food or food ingredient of the present invention do also apply for food products<br>
comprising, as a coating or a filling, the food ingredient of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, according to embodiments, the present invention also provides food<br>
products comprising the food ingredient of the present invention as a coating or filling<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
11<br>
which are subjected to a temperature of &gt;25°C or above 100°C during the manufacturing<br>
process, respectively, or to the temperatures disclosed before for the food ingredient.<br>
In an embodiment, the food product is a filled food product selected from the<br>
group consisting of a pie, a cake, a snack, a fat-filled pretzel or cracker, a fat filled biscuit,<br>
and/or an eclair type product.<br>
In another embodiment, the food product is a coated food product selected from<br>
sweetened products, such as pastry, cakes, pies, candies, hard-boiled candies, chewing<br>
gums (including pellets and sticks), gummi bears, jelly bellies, compressed tablets, for<br>
example. Accordingly, these or other food products comprise as a coating the food<br>
ingredient of the present invention.<br>
The coated food product may also be a savory food, such as a pizza, a cracker, a<br>
snack, a cracker, a bread, potato chips, extruded or puffed snacks, snack noodles, for<br>
example.<br>
The coating or filling of the food products with the food ingredient of the present<br>
invention may be performed with conventional coating or filling technologies. Coating or<br>
filling equipment generally used for coating with lipids like oil or fat may be used.<br>
Examples for coating equipment suitable for applying lipid coatings also<br>
comprising the flavor capsules of the present invention are spraying equipments, coating<br>
pans (Bracks®, Bruccoma L/GII, Germany), coating guns (Binks® 95G Gravity Speed<br>
Spray Gun), fluid bed equipments (Niro Aeromatic, Switzerland), for example.<br>
Examples for filling equipments suitable for applying fillings to food products are<br>
extruders, such as screw-extruders, pistons, APV Baker's (Peterborough, PE4 7AP, UK),<br>
forming extruders (Hosokawa Bepex GmBH, 74211 Leingarten, Germany), for example.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by way of the following examples but is not<br>
limited to these example.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Capsules based on Yeast Maltodextrin and Encapsulated Flavors<br>
100 g spray-dried yeast (Aventine Renewable Energy Company, USA) were dispersed in<br>
375 g water. 75g of flavor (NovaMint FreshMint®, commercially obtainable from<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
12<br>
Firmenich SA, Switzerland, commercial no. 50603 8T) are added and the mixture is<br>
maintained for 4 hours at 50°C under constant agitation at 150 rpm in a blade stirrer.<br>
Thereafter, 150 g of maltodextrin (DE 18) was added and mixed until the total aqueous<br>
mixture was homogenous.<br>
The mixture was then spray dried on a Niro mobile minor® at 210°C inlet and 90°C<br>
outlet temperature at a feed rate of 10 ml/minute. A powder of capsules based on a micro-<br>
organism, a matrix component and at least one flavor are obtained. At the end of the<br>
process, the flavor capsules comprised 40wt.% yeast, 40wt.% maltodextrin and 20wt.%<br>
liquid flavor.<br>
The same procedure is repeated two times with a liquid butter and a liquid pizza flavor,<br>
respectively, instead of the mint flavor. Accordingly, 75 g of butter or pizza flavor<br>
(commercial nos: 334550 01NF and 700543 02T, respectively), commercially obtainable<br>
from Firmenich, Switzerland, were used in the same procedure as outlined above, to<br>
obtain butter flavor and pizza flavor encapsulated in capsules based on a micro-organism<br>
and a matrix component. The spray-dried butter- or pizza flavored capsules comprised<br>
40wt.% yeast, 40wt.% maltodextrin and 20wt.% of the liquid flavor, hence five times less<br>
flavor compared to the pure liquid flavor.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Fat Fillings Comprising Encapsulated and Non-Encapsulated Flavors<br>
A fat base that can be used as a filling or a coating of food products is prepared by mixing<br>
in a Hobart® mixer (model N-50, Canada) at ambient temperature l00g of confectionery<br>
T) sugar with 100 g of vegetable coco-fat (Astra cocofat, Unilever, Switzerland).<br>
Two series of flavored fat fillings were prepared, both of which comprised pure liquid<br>
flavor and encapsulated flavor obtained in Example 1 above, at the weight percentages<br>
indicated below:<br>
Series 1<br>
Sample 1:       Liquid NovaMint FreshMint® flavor (see Example 1):       0.05wt.%<br>
Sample 2:       Flavor-capsules obtained in Example 1:	0.25wt%<br>
The two fat fillings of the first series thus contained iso-load of mint flavor.<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
13<br>
Series 2<br>
Sample 3:       Liquid NovaMint FreshMint® flavor (see Example 1):      0.05wt.%<br>
Sample 4:       Flavor-capsules obtained in Example 1:	0.10wt.%<br>
Fat filling no. 4 of the second series differs in that the filling comprising the flavor-<br>
capsules (Sample 4) actually contains 3 times less flavor than any of the preceding fillings<br>
(Samples 1 - 3), given the composition of the capsules (see Example 1).<br>
Sensory Evaluation of Flavored Fat Fillings<br>
The fat fillings of each of the two series obtained in Example 2 were blind tested by<br>
20 trained panelists in one testing session. The test design provided an intensity rating and<br>
a paired t-test for statistical evaluation.<br>
Accordingly, all panelists have tasted one small spoon of iat filling following one of the<br>
two possible presentation orders, which were presented an equal number of times<br>
(10 panelists started with Sample 1 and 10 panelists tasted Sample 2 first). Subjects were<br>
asked to identify the sample for which the mint flavor was more intense. For one sample<br>
of the pair, subjects were also asked to rate the mint intensity on a scale ranging from 1 to<br>
10 (0 = no mint flavor, 10 = strong mint flavor). Subjects were also invited to describe<br>
product differences.<br>
Results Series 1:<br>
Four (4) subjects selected sample 1 (liquid flavor) as being the most intense and<br>
16 subjects found sample 2 (comprising flavor capsules) as being the most intense.<br>
Therefore, fat fillings flavored with capsules comprising yeast, a matrix component and at<br>
least one flavor have significantly (p=0.0118) stronger flavor intensity than fat fillings<br>
comprising the same amount of flavor in a non-encapsulated, liquid form.<br>
Results Series 2:<br>
Ten subjects selected sample 1 (liquid flavor) as being the most intense and 10 subjects<br>
found sample 2 (comprising flavor capsules), which contained 60wt.% less flavor than<br>
sample 1, as being the most intense. Therefore, fat fillings flavored with capsules<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
14<br>
comprising yeast, a matrix component and at least one flavor have the same intensity as<br>
fat fillings containing more liquid, non-encapsulated flavor.<br>
The observed fact that flavor encapsulated in yeast and a matrix component are perceived<br>
more intensely than flavors that are not so encapsulated flavors is concluded to be related<br>
to the better release of the encapsulated flavor in the oral cavity during consumption.<br>
While flavors dispersed in the lipid matrix may remain bound to the matrix, the<br>
encapsulated flavors, when coming into contact with the saliva and the surrounding lipids,<br>
are disrupted and the flavors come easily into contact with the taste buds.<br>
Example 3<br>
Coated Crackers<br>
The purpose of this example is to manufacture baked goods coated with an oil dispersion<br>
of liquid and encapsulated flavors, both having the same flavor loads.<br>
Two series of flavor dispersions in vegetable oil containing similar amounts of active<br>
flavor ingredients were produced according to the procedures below.<br>
First Series: Oil Dispersion Comprising Liquid and Encapsulated Butter Flavor<br>
1.	1.0 g of encapsulated butter flavor (see Example 1) were added to 99 g of liquid<br>
Canola Oil, heated to 65.5°C, and stirred well.<br>
2.	0.2 g of liquid butter flavor was added to 99.8 g of liquid Canola Oil, heated to<br>
65.5°C and stirred well.<br>
This resulted in two 100-gram quantities of butter flavor / oil mixtures, each of which<br>
contained 0.2 g of butter flavor.<br>
Second Series: Oil Dispersion Comprising Liquid and Encapsulated Pizza Flavor<br>
According to the same procedure and with the same quantities as in Series 1 above, pizza<br>
flavor (see Example 1) was added to Neobee® oil to obtain two 100-gram quantities of<br>
pizza flavored oil mixtures, each of which contained 0.2 g of pizza flavor.<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
15<br>
The flavor in oil dispersions were then applied to the surfaces of store-bought crackers<br>
using a hand-pump trigger sprayer at the rate of 10 grams of flavor dispersion per<br>
100 grams of crackers. This resulted in 0.02% butter or pizza flavor being added to the<br>
crackers. The crackers used were Manischewitz Matzo® crackers miniatures, unsalted.<br>
They were preferred because they contain no added flavors or fat or oil, and consist of<br>
essentially unbleached wheat flour and water, making them ideal for the evaluation of<br>
flavors.<br>
After the addition of the oil/flavor dispersion, the crackers were heated in a continuous<br>
oven for 10 minutes at 220°F (104.4°C) in order to facilitate absorption of the oil into the<br>
cracker. Oil is typically applied to crackers and other baked goods to enhance,<br>
appearance, taste, and mouth feel properties, as well as to help particles such as salt or<br>
seasonings adhere to the baked good surface. Heat, either applied separately, or residually<br>
present from the baking process, facilitates the absorption of the oil by the cracker.<br>
The crackers were allowed to cool to room temperature and then packaged to protect the<br>
texture.<br>
Sensory Evaluation of Flavored Crackers<br>
The crackers obtained above were tested by three trained panelists in a blind taste test.<br>
Each subject was asked to assess butter or pizza flavor intensity of subsequently tasted<br>
pairs of butter and pizza flavored crackers.<br>
The crackers with the encapsulated flavor were considered to be much stronger in terms<br>
of butter and pizza flavor intensities compared to the crackers flavored with liquid<br>
flavors. The crackers flavored with the encapsulated flavors had stronger flavor impact<br>
and longer lasting flavor compared to the crackers flavored with the un-encapsulated<br>
flavor, when the flavors were applied at similar dosages. These improvements are<br>
attributed to the heat stable nature of the yeast-encapsulated flavor.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of Mint-Flavored Milk Chocolate<br>
A flavored milk chocolate is prepared according to the following protocol:<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
16<br>
-	In a Pyrex® glass beaker (1000 ml), place in the milk chocolate (Carma, Milk<br>
Chocolate, Dubendorf, Switzerland) and melt it in a microwave to the temperature, 46-<br>
48°C.<br>
-	Cool the milk chocolate to 27-29°C<br>
-	Reheat the milk chocolate to 30-32°C<br>
-	Add flavor and mix it well<br>
-	Pour into an empty mold<br>
-	Wait until the chocolate sets hard and gently remove from the mold at room temperature<br>
The flavors that were used are:<br>
Sample 1: liquid mint flavor (Example 1) at 0.06 wt.% of milk chocolate<br>
Sample 2: mint flavored capsules (Example 1) at 0.30 wt.% of milk chocolate<br>
Sensory Evaluation of Mint-Flavored Milk Chocolate<br>
The same protocol as described for Example 2 was used, with the difference that<br>
10 panelists tasted 2 g units of liquid-flavored (sample 1) versus capsule-flavored<br>
chocolate (sample 2).<br>
Sample 1 was perceived as having good mint flavor impact initially which gradually<br>
decreased during eating.<br>
Sample 2 provided a lower mint flavor impact initially, which gradually increased until its<br>
overall mint intensity was higher than Sample 1.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of a Mint-flavored Milk Chocolate Crispy Cake<br>
A cake having a chocolate coating was prepared according the following procedure:<br>
-	In a Pyrex® glass beaker (1000 ml), place in 100 g of milk chocolate (Carma, Milk<br>
Chocolate, Dubendorf, Switzerland) and melt it in a microwave to the temperature,<br>
46-48C<br>
-	Cool the milk chocolate to 27-29C<br>
-	Reheat the milk chocolate to 30-32C<br><br>
WO 2006/117705	PCT/IB2006/051203<br>
17<br>
-	Add flavor and mix well<br>
-	Weigh 15 grams of milk chocolate with flavor and spread it evenly on top of the<br>
unflavored rice crispy cake<br>
-	Wait until the milk chocolate sets hard on top of the unflavored rice crispy cake at<br>
room temperature<br>
The flavors that were used are:<br>
Sample 1: liquid mint flavor (Example 1) at 0.08 wt.% of milk chocolate<br>
Sample 2: mint flavored capsules (Example 1) at 0.40 wt.% of milk chocolate<br>
Sensory Evaluation of Mint-flavored Milk Chocolate Crispy Cake<br>
The same protocol as described in Examples 2 and 4 was conducted, with the difference<br>
that 5 panelists participated in one tasting session and that the sample size was 3 g of<br>
coated cake.<br>
The results of the sensory evaluation were as for the flavored milk chocolate (Example 6)<br>
alone: Sample 2, comprising encapsulated flavors, had a lower initial impact but over the<br>
entire time of tasting a overall stronger mint flavor intensity than Sample 1, which<br>
contained liquid, non-encapsulated flavor.<br>
Conclusions of Examples 1-5<br>
The above experiments show that foods or food ingredients, such as fillings or coatings,<br>
which contain lipids can advantageously be flavored with flavor capsules based on a<br>
micro-organism, a matrix component and at least one encapsulated flavor. In oil or iat<br>
based foods or food ingredients, which are substantially free of water, flavors can<br>
effectively be encapsulated and flavor diffusion into the lipid matrix is prevented. Upon<br>
consumption, probably due to the contact with saliva (water) in the oral cavity, the flavors<br>
are immediately released from these capsules and enhanced flavor intensity is perceived<br>
by the consumer.<br><br>
