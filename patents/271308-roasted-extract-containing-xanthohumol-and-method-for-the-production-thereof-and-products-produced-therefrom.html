				<td>Description<br>
Natural extract comprising fcanthohumol, and method for the production thereof and products produced therefrom<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention reives to a method for producing a roasted extract from cereals, cereal malt or coffee comprising xanthohurnol (XN) and a hop extract comprising xanthohuaiol) as well as its use for the production of beverages and/or food products.<br>
Background art<br>
Hop is used as raw mateial for the production of beer. Hop provides the bitter impression of beer but atyb an elongated shelf life due to its antibacterial<br>
effect.<br>
The most important compcfunds contained in hop are, besides the bitter acids <e a-acids essential oils tannins and polyphenols.></e>
Xanthohumol, a ptenylflayonoid (polyphenol) of hop which occurs in the lupulin glands of the hop conefc has a plurality of positive effects. Beside the antiviral and the anti-oestrogenj|c and anti-inflammatory effect, a cancer-chemo preventive activity of XN is attso discussed which activity is currently under investigation in animal experiments. The content of xanthdhumol in hops varies depending on the hop variety between 0.1 and 1 %. The hop varieties having a high content ot'xanthohurnol usually comprise a high portion of bitter substances.<br><br>
Hop products may be [divided in raw [hops, hop pellets and hop extracts. Since xanthohumol occurs oijly in the lupuluj glands of the hop cone, hop pellets exhibit a high content of XN| corresponding (to the accumulation of ctracids. Hop<br><br>
extracts may be obtained by' extraction with extract hardly comprises any xanthohumol<br><br>
CO2 and/or ethancl. Whereas CO: XN is extracted almost completely<br><br>
during the ethanol extraction] Recently, XN bunched products are produced by a combination of both eXtractiofi methods. Depending on the production method XN contents of between 8 and <f9 are achieved. the production of hop extracts enriched with xn and drinlts comprising jj is described e.g. in patents de ahdep></f9><br>
In the brewing process<br><br>
xanthohumol |s relatively instable and is mainly<br><br>
precipitated via the trub, the yeast, by filtration and stabilisation due to its limited solubility. Besides, xanthohurhol is isomerisefl to iso-xanthohumol wliich also has u positive effect, however, to Quite a lower extent compared to xanthohumol. With the conventional method less! then 0.2 me/1 KN are reached in the final beer in most of the cases. In some sjout or porter tyjpfe dark beers XN contents of up to 1.2 mg/1 XN were found (Walker et al., Brauwelt 2003). With a special brewing method which applies late hooping and a fast pooling of the beer wort it is possible to increase the XN consent in non-ffltered pale beers to 1-10 mg/1 (DE 102 56166).<br>
It is an advantage of the present iivention that the isomerisation of xanthohumol to iso-xantbohjimol is supresfsed to a large extent due to the improvement of the brewing method. Therefore, it is possible to increase dosage amounts of XN without allohvine the beers! to become unpleasantly bitter, for instance. Further, the addition of stabilisers is|possible which would normally lea;l to a relevant decrease in the XN content.<br><br>
A method for producing the roasted extract comprising XN from roasted products of cereals, cereal maty, coffee or cacao and a hop extract comprising XN is an object of the present' (invention. The hop extract comprising XN is characterised by a particularly |i|gh content of xanthohurnol. It is in the range from 10 mg to 2 g/kg, preferably in t|h|e range of 200 mg to 850 mg/kg. Due to the use of this roasted extract beers with|a significant increased content of XN compared to the prior art can be obtained! in accordance with the German purity law, for instance.<br>
Herein, "roasted extract)' comprising XN" denotes an extract which is obtainable from a roasted extrtact from roasted products of cereals, cereal malt. coffee or cacao and from th4' hop extract comprising XN. "Roasted extract" denotes a cold or hot extract ftftm coarsely ground or non-ground roasted malt or cereals and includes a hot or liold extract from coffee or cacao; "cereal malt" denotes a cereal that was artificially or controllably allowed to germinate, and "hop extract comprising XN" denoteslan extract from hops which was obtained with the aid of a solvent and exhibits afl increased content of XN. "Basic materials" is a collective term for plain or oHmbined substances which may be of natural or synthetic origin. They are used &amp; parent material for the farther production of food products, In the present invention basic materials denote e.g. essences which may be enriched with XN as well fls e.g. a basic material for coke according to an embodiment of the present inveiRtion.<br>
For producing roasted exttact comprising XN a hot aqueous extract of the ground roasted products e.g. of barley, wheat, rye as well as the corresponding malts, coffee beans or cacao b«fens is prepared. A hop extract comprising XN is added thereto at the beginning of the heating period. The extraction of .xanthwhurnol in the extractions'! of the roasted products leads to a XN content which is by far higher than the solubility limit of XN in typical aqueous solutions.<br><br>
This amounts to 1.3 mg/I of ^N at a water temperature of 23. °C and to 1.1 mg/1 of XN at a water temperature of 8 °C.<br>
Soluble roasted substances which absorb or bind XN and therefore, apparently keep it in solution, are orobablvl responsible for the high yields of xanthoburriol in the extracts] The extracts pay be fermented, concentrated or clarified without noteworthy josses of XN. AJecording to one embodiment of the present invention a xanthohWoI content of approximately 1320mg/kg was obtained in the extract after concentration of tl}e XN comprising roasted malt wort.<br>
The XN comprising roasted malt wortnjay be used in the food industry such as in the brewing and beveragb industry as wo|ll as in the foodstuff industry. Thus, the application of the XN comprising roasted |nalt wort may lead to an enrichment of xanthohumol in spirits, hejrbal spirits, herbal liquor wine, beer, mixed drinks comprising beer, or bitters, an{! also of non-alifoholic drinks or drinks with reduced alcohol content such as malt tyeverages, coffe^, coffee substitute, cacao, ice tea or soft drinks as well as of basii materials for the production of such products in a simple, safe and economic wa(y, A particular ^dvantage is that a roasted malt beer enriched with XN and prepared according jo this method may be added to a conventionally produced beer| at any time of the beer production in accordance with the purity law, i.e., withput the use of ejtnulsifying agents or other chemical additives.<br>
An enrichment of food ijroducts with xajnthohumol, such as bakery products, backing kits, parfaits, dairy products Ce.e. yoghurt, curd cheese and mixed drinks comprising milk) desserts, ice' cream, meat -products, sauces and herbal candies as well as enrichment of pharmajceutical products with xanthohumol, such as cough syrup, is also possible.<br><br>
The method for preparing I Jan aqueous extract comprising XN from roasted products of cereals, cereal malt, |[coffee or cacao comprises the following process steps:<br>
a)	addition of a hop product comprising XN to an extract which is mainly or<br>
completely produced frcjfri roasted or colour malts, respectively, or roasted<br>
barley; wherein the added hop product has a content of XN which is,<br>
related to the mass used'for its production, at least 5 times that of the hops<br>
used for its production; ^nd wherein after the addition of the hop product<br>
comprising xanthohunxf to the aqueous roasted extract the dissolving or<br>
even an intensive dissolving of XN is reached, despite the original low<br>
solubility in aqueous solutions;<br>
b)	dissolving of XN by pr^-dissolving of the XN comprising hop product in<br>
ethano.l;<br>
c)	dissolving of XN by ajgitating, mixing, shaking, supersonic treatment,<br>
ultraturax treatment or other mechanical forces;<br>
d)	dissolving of XN by heading of theroasted extract;<br>
e)	dissolving of XN by application of an alternating current;<br>
() wherein the amount of tjhe addition of the hop product comprising XN is al least 50 mg XN per litre,<br>
As will be understood fronji the following examples, it is not necessary that all of the previously mentioned process steps are realised when implementing the process. The process steps b) to hjj are optional.<br><br>
