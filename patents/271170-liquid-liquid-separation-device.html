This invention allows the liquids of various densities to enter the cenfrifugal cylinder; under the action of centrifugal force, the liquid medium of the highest density approaches to the cylinder wall first, while the liquids of lower densities follow in sequence; when the inward buoyant force that the float bears in the liquids of various densities is over the outward centrifugal force generated due to its own mass, the float will move inwards to open the passageway and discharge the heavy medium deposited on the cylinder wall, thus achieving the automatic separation.</td>

				<td>Liquid-Liquid Separation Device<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention involves a separation device, more specifically, a liquid-liquid separation device be capable of automatically sepai-ating the liquid media of different densities during whole process.<br>
Background Technologies<br>
Currently, there are two modes with which a centrifugal inacliine removes the heavy media. One is the intennittent operation mode, in which the principle of gravity settlement is mainly adopted: to stop (he machine when the centrifugal cylinder is filled with heavy media, and to cause the heavy media settle into a special case in the natui-al state after a given period of time is passed; to discharge the heavy media in the case through the valve. In tills case, it is inevitable to frequently stop the macliine. The other is the continuous operation mode, in which tlie principle of centrifugal separation is adopted: to classify the outlet passageway of centrifugal separator into heavy media passageway and light media passageway, the latter is close to the rotating shaft of centriftigal separator, while the former is close to the outside. In this mode, it is necessaiy to set a specific gi'avity ring in the heavy media passageway (manufacturing of the specific gravity ling is under restriction of such conditions as temperature, density and oil liquid), and the specific gravity ring has extremely strict requirements on temperature and density In the event that the liquid is a mixture of light and heavy media, the specific gravity ring needs a real-time manual adjustment and has to stop for times as the heavy media is discharged constantly<br>
Contents of the invention<br>
an object of the invention is to overcome the above shortcomings in the arts, and provide a liquid-liquid separation device that is capable of automatically separating the<br><br>
liquid media of different densities duiing whole process without stop and breaking through the volumetric restriction after liquid media of different densities is separated in a centrifiigal cylinder.<br>
This invention may be implemented through the following measures:<br>
A liquid-liquid separation device, which includes a cenlj-ifugal cylinder having a liquid<br>
inlet and a liquid outlet, a centripetal float valve is provided inside tlie centrifugal cylinder<br>
and mounted on the wall of the centiifugal cylinder.<br>
The centripetal float valve of this invention comprises a float body and a valve base,<br>
the float body is arranged in inside the valve base and connected to thi-ough hole provided<br>
in the wall of the centrifugal cylinder The valve seat may be directly formed by inachining<br>
on the wall of centrifugal cylinder.<br>
Due to (he above descried sCmcture of this invention, the liquids of different densities flow into the centrifugal cylinder; under the action of centrifugal force, the liquid medium of the higher density approaches to the cylinder wall while the liquids of lower densities approaches to the central of the cyVrnder; when the inward buoyant force that the float body bears in the liquids of various densities is over the outwaid centrifugal force generated due to its own mass, the float body will move inwards to open the passageway and discharge the heavy medium deposited on the cylinder wall outside ihe cylindei; tlius achieving the automatic separation; when the heavy media are dischai'ged one by one, and the remaining light media are insufficient to overcome the outward centiilligal force that the float body produces due to its mass, the float body will move outwards to close the passageway; a small amount of heavy media continue to settle on the wall of centiifiigal cylinder throu^ centrifugal separation, and when a certain density is readied, the float will open the passageway one more tune. This is reciprocal, till the separation is completely done.<br>
Explanation to the Attached Drawings<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the structure of this invention. Specific Emixxliments<br>
Witli reference to the attached drawings, this invention is further desaibed as follows.<br>
As showed in the Fig. 1, a liquid-liquid septu-ation device includes a centiifugal cylinder 1. The centrifugal cylinder 1 has a liquid inlet 2, outlet 5, and a separation plate 3 is proved in the centriftigal cylinder 1. The separation plate 3 is close to the liquid inlet 2 and connected with the centrifugal cylinder 1. On the wall of the centrifiigal cylinder 1. one or more centripetal float valve(s) 4 is/are provided. The centripetal float valve 4 is classically mounted in the middle of tlie centrifugal cylinder 1, or altejiiatively in the upper or lower part of the centrifagal cylinderl. The centripetal float valve 4 comprises of the valve base and float body 7, The float body 7 is located inside the valve base 6, and connected to the through holes formed by machining the wall of the centrifugal cylinder 1, and the quantity and size of the through holes are determined according to the quantity of the centripetal float valves 4. Altematively, the valve base may be fonned by directly machining on the cylinder wall. The float body may be of various shapes, such as sphere, cylinder, cone or a combination of them. During operation, the liquids of different densities flow into the centrifugal cylinder, and under the action of centrifugal force, the liquid medium of the higher density approaches to the cylinder wall while the liquids of lower densities approaches the central of the cylinder. When the inward buoyant force that the float beai's in Ihe liquids of various densities is over the outward centrifugal force generated due to its own mass, the float body wiU move inwards to open the passageway and discharge the heavy medium deposited on tlie cylinder wail, thus tiie automatic sepai-ation is achieved.<br>
Industrial applicability<br>
This invention may be applied to oil liquid purification, food processing, oil-water separation, automatic washing, sewage treatment, filtering separation, lubrication, metallurgy, petrochemical, traffic &amp; transportation, mechanical processing, and other industries.<br><br><br>
