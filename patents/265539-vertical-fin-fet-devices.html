				<td>VERTICAL FIN-FET MOS DEVICES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, more particularly to<br>
MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) devices, and still more<br>
particularly to vertical MOSFETs.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In 1965, Dr. Gordon Moore, then Director of Research and Development for Fairchild<br>
Semiconductor, made the observation that the number of transistor devices per integrated<br>
circuit had been doubling every couple of years since the creation of the first integrated<br>
circuits in the late 1950's and that he expected the trend to continue for the foreseeable<br>
future. This observation was dubbed "Moore's Law" by the trade press. Now almost 40<br>
years later, despite numerous dire predictions of fundamental obstacles, unrelenting industry<br>
efforts towards every-increasing semiconductor density have effectively affirmed Dr.<br>
Moore's prophetic observation, and the trend is still expected to continue unabated for the<br>
foreseeable future. The process of reducing semiconductor device size to increase integrated<br>
circuit density is generally referred to as "scaling".<br>
Ongoing scaling efforts of semiconductor MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) devices not<br>
only contribute to higher integrated circuit packing density, but also improve integrated<br>
circuit performance. As the scaling process proceeds towards the physical limits of currently<br>
available MOS technologies and techniques, new technologies and techniques are developed<br>
to further decrease device size and increase device performance. As MOS device size<br>
decreases, tremendous challenges arise in a variety of areas, including source/drain contact<br>
resistance and current carrying capacity. In these two areas at least, extremely small size<br>
tends to work against performance.<br>
One approach that has been employed to improve current carrying capacity of extremely<br>
small-geometry FETs is the creation of "double gate" (also referred to as dual-gate herein)<br>
transistors. In principle, double-gate transistors act something like two transistors in parallel,<br>
thereby improving current flow between source and drain. Two major types of double-gate<br>
transistors have been demonstrated: the planar double-gate transistor and the double-gate Fin-<br>
FET.<br>
The planar double-gate FET is not unlike a conventional single gate transistor in that it has a<br>
horizontal "planar" transistor body with a source and drain at each end and a channel<br>
therebetween. Unlike single-gate transistors, however, the planar double-gate FET has a<br>
second gate below the transistor body effectively creating a second, parallel channel between<br>
the source and drain. However, there is considerable process complexity involved in forming<br>
the second, buried gate and in connecting to it, and the planar double-gate transistor is not<br>
significantly different from conventional planar transistor structures in terms of its ability to<br>
be scaled. Such planar devices are rapidly approaching the physical limits of scaling.<br>
The double-gate Fin-FET employs thin vertical silicon "fins" that act as the transistor body.<br>
Horizontally opposed ends of the fin act as source and drain. The gate structure is formed<br>
around the fin in an inverted "U" configuration such that the fin has parallel gates formed<br>
along both vertical sidewalls thereof. As in the planar double-gate transistor, the double-gate<br>
Fin-FET improves current flow between source and drain by effectively creating parallel<br>
channels therebetween. Current flows horizontally through the fin between source and drain<br>
when the double gate is appropriately biased. Because the transistor body of the Fin-FET is a<br>
thin vertical structure, there can be considerable space savings over similar planar devices.<br>
Series resistance in Fin-FETs is a significant problem, however.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventive technique produces high-density, vertical Fin-FET devices with low<br>
contact resistance by means of vertical silicon "fins" that act as the transistor body. Doped<br>
source and drain regions are formed at the bottoms and tops, respectively, of the fins. Gate<br>
structures are formed along sidewalls of the fins, spanning the vertical distance between the<br>
source and drain regions and separated from the fins by thin gate insulators. Current flows<br>
vertically through the channel region between the source and drain regions when an<br>
appropriate bias is applied to the gates. Through the use of selective doping, both nFET and<br>
pFET variants of the inventive vertical Fin-FET device are easily formed on the same<br>
substrate. Preferably, the substrate is an SOI (silicon-on-insulator) wafer, but any suitable<br>
substrate or portion thereof having a silicon layer formed over an insulator layer (e.g., buried<br>
oxide layer - "BOX") could be employed.<br>
The basic structure of the inventive vertical Fin-FET device is characterized by at least one<br>
vertical semiconductor fin disposed on an insulator layer. Doped source and drain regions<br>
are formed in bottom and top portions of the fin(s) and gate conductors are disposed along<br>
vertical sidewalls of the at least one semiconductor fin. The gate conductors are space away<br>
from the fins by thin gate insulators.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the gate conductors span a vertical distance between<br>
the source region and drain region of the fin(s). Since gate conductors are disposed on both<br>
sides of the fin(s), the vertical Fin-FET is essentially a dual-gate device. When an<br>
appropriate biasing voltage is applied to the gate conductors, channels form between the<br>
source and drain regions adjacent to each gate, effectively creating parallel channels and<br>
improving the current carrying capacity of the vertical Fin-FET as compared to single-gate<br>
devices.<br>
Generally speaking, source conductors contact the source regions on both sides of the fins.<br>
Source contacts (typically metal) are employed to connect to the source conductors, drain<br>
contacts connect to the drain regions and gate contacts connect to the gate conductors.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the gate connections can be made either separately or<br>
in common. Providing separate gate contacts that connect to the gate conductors on opposite<br>
sides of a fin yields a multi-gate vertical Fin-FET whereby each of the gates can be separately<br>
controlled. Connecting to the gate conductors on opposite sides of a fin in parallel with a<br>
single gate contact yields a double-gate vertical Fin-FET with enhanced drive capability.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the source contact can connect to the source<br>
conductor on one side of the fin only in a "single-source" variant of the vertical Fin-FET.<br>
Multi-Fin versions of the vertical fin-FET are readily formed by creating multiple fins and<br>
connecting them in parallel such that the source conductors are all connected together, the<br>
drain regions are all connected together and the gate conductors are all connected together.<br>
Alternatively, the gates can be connected such that two gate contacts are provided where one<br>
gate contact connects to all of the gate conductors on one side of each fin and the other gate<br>
contact connects to all of the gate conductors on the other side of each fin.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a "fat-drain" variation improves drain contact<br>
resistance. In this variation, the drain contact is "widened" to over extend the fin laterally.<br>
By selective doping, nFET and pFET devices are readily created on the same substrate. For<br>
nFET devices, the source regions, drain regions, gate conductors and source conductors are<br>
all n+ doped. For pFET devices, the source regions, drain regions, gate conductors and<br>
source conductors are all p+ doped.<br>
Any number of pFET and/or nFET devices can be created, and multi-Fin devices can be<br>
created using the same process steps as single-fin devices. This permits any combination of<br>
single-fin and/or multi-fin pFET and/or nFET devices to be formed on a single substrate<br>
using essentially the same process steps. These devices can be parts of CMOS circuits or<br>
non-complementary circuits and can be part of a large integrated circuit device.<br>
One suitable method for forming the vertical fin-FET device can be summarized as a series of<br>
processing steps as follows:<br>
(1) provide a semiconductor substrate having a semiconductor layer disposed over an<br>
insulator layer;<br>
(2) form vertical semiconductor fins on top of the insulator layer by etching parallel trenches<br>
through the semiconductor layer down to the insulator layer;<br>
(3) selectively deposit doped source conductors at the bottoms of the trenches such that the<br>
doped conductors contact bottom portions of the fins;<br>
(4) form source insulators over the doped conductors;<br>
(5) form gate insulators along sidewalls of the trenches;<br>
(6) thermally drive dopants from the doped conductors into bottom portions of the fins to<br>
create source regions;<br>
(7) form gate conductors along vertical sidewalls of the fins spaced away the fins by the gate<br>
insulators;<br>
(8) dope top portions of the fins to form drain regions therein;<br>
(9) form sidewall spacers along exposed sidewalls of the trenches, fins and gate conductors;<br>
(10) etch back the source insulators to expose the underlying doped source conductors;<br>
(11) form silicide in exposed portions of the source and gate conductors;<br>
(12) fill the trenches with an oxide trench-fill and planarize;<br>
(13) form metal source, drain and gate contacts by Damascene processes of selective etching,<br>
metal fill, and chem-mech polishing.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventive technique produces high-density, vertical Fin-FET devices with low<br>
contact resistance by forming tall, thin vertical silicon "fins" that act as the transistor body.<br>
Appropriately doped source and drain regions are formed at the bottoms and tops,<br>
respectively, of the fins and gate structures are formed along sidewalls of the fins,<br>
overlapping the doped source and drain regions, thereby creating a vertical channel region in<br>
the fin between the source and drain regions. Current flows vertically through channels that<br>
form in the channel region adjacent to the gate structures and extending between the source<br>
and drain regions when an appropriate bias is applied to the gates. Through the use of<br>
selective doping, both nFET and pFET variants of the inventive vertical Fin-FET device are<br>
easily formed on the same substrate. Preferably, the substrate is an SOI (silicon-on-insulator)<br>
wafer, but any suitable substrate or portion thereof having a silicon layer formed over an<br>
insulator layer (e.g., buried oxide layer - "BOX") could be employed. Preferably, an SOI<br>
substrate having a nitride layer overlying a silicon layer that in turn overlies a buried oxide<br>
layer (BOX) is employed.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a method for forming vertical Fin-FET semiconductor structures<br>
can be summarized as: (1) Forming tall, thin vertical semiconductor (silicon) "fins" on top of<br>
an insulator layer in a suitable substrate (e.g. SOI), e.g., by etching parallel trenches through<br>
the silicon layer down to the insulator layer (e.g, BOX); (2) selectively depositing n+ and/or<br>
p+ doped polysilicon conductors at the bottoms of the trenches (as appropriate to the type of<br>
FinFET devices being formed: nFET and/or pFET) such that the doped polysilicon<br>
conductors contact bottom portions of the fins; (3) forming an HDP oxide insulating layer<br>
over the polysilicon; (4) effecting appropriate channel doping (in the "fin") using<br>
conventional masking and implantation techniques; (5) forming gate insulators along<br>
sidewalls of the trenches and thermally "driving" the polysilicon dopants into bottom portions<br>
of the fins; (6) forming gate conductors on the sides of the fins (with the gate insulators<br>
separating the gate conductors from the fins); (7) Selectively implanting n+ and/or p+<br>
dopants (as appropriate to the type of FinFET devices being formed: nFET and/or pFET) into<br>
top portions of the fins to form drain regions therein; (8) depositing nitride and etching back<br>
to form sidewall spacers; (9) etching back the HDP oxide to expose the underlying doped<br>
polysilicon source conductors and forming silicide in exposed portions of the source and gate<br>
conductors; (10) filling the trenches with an oxide trench-fill and planarizing via CMP<br>
(chem-mech polishing); and (11) forming metal source, drain and gate contacts by<br>
Damascene processes of selective etching, metal fill, and chem-mech polishing.<br>
It should be noted that in the ensuing detailed description of the preferred embodiment(s) of<br>
the invention, drawing features are not necessarily to scale and should be interpreted as being<br>
merely schematically representative of the relationships between the structures and features<br>
depicted.<br>
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional diagram of an SOI wafer substrate 100 on which n-channel and<br>
p-channel vertical Fin-FETs are to be formed, in accordance with the invention. Preferably,<br>
the wafer substrate structure has a" bulk silicon liiycr 2 over which a buried oxide layer (BOX)<br>
4 is formed. Overlying the buried oxide layer 4 is a single-crystal silicon layer 6. A nitride<br>
dielectric layer (e.g., SiN) 8 overlies the silicon layer 6. Preferably the silicon layer 6 is 50-<br>
200 nanometers (nM - 10" meters) in thickness, but with further device scaling, thinner<br>
layers may be appropriate.<br>
Figure 2 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 200 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 100 of Figure 1 after etching to form well-defined, parallel trenches 10A, 10B, IOC<br>
and 10D through the nitride layer 8 and silicon layer 6 down to the BOX layer 4. Trenches<br>
10A and 10B define a first fin 12A therebetween, which will become the body of an nFET<br>
transistor (generally indicated in the Figure as "nFET"). The first fin 12A has a nitride "cap"<br>
14A. Trenches IOC and 10D define a second fin 12B therebetween, which will become the<br>
body of a pFET transistor (generally indicated in the Figure as "pFET"). The second fin 12B<br>
also has a nitride "cap" 14B. Trenches 10B and IOC define a spacer structure therebetween<br>
comprising a silicon base 16B with a nitride cap 16A. Preferably, the fins 12A and 12B are<br>
10-20 nM wide, but with further device scaling, smaller widths may be appropriate. The<br>
heights of the fins 12A and 12B are equal to the thickness of the silicon layer 6. preferably<br>
50-200 nM.<br>
Figure 3 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 300 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 200 of Figure 2 after a process of forming n+ doped polysilicon source conductors<br>
ISA at the bottoms of trenches 10A and 10B, respectively, and forming p+ doped polysilicon<br>
source conductors 18C and 18D at the bottoms of trenches IOC and 10D, respectively.<br>
Preferably, the source conductors 18A and 18B are formed by masking off the inchoate<br>
"pFET" device (generally indicated in the Figure as "pFET") and depositing n+ doped<br>
polysilicon in trenches 10A and 10B (generally associated with the inchoate "nFET" device<br>
generally indicated in the Figure as "nFET") and etching back such that the n+ source<br>
conductors ISA and 18B generally uniformly fill the trenches 10A and 1 OB to a uniform<br>
depth, contacting the fin 12A only at a bottom portion thereof. Then the mask is removed<br>
and source conductors 18C and 18D are formed in similar fashion by masking off the<br>
inchoate "nFET" device and depositing p+ doped polysilicon in trenches IOC and 10D<br>
(generally associated with the inchoate "pFET" device) and etching back such that the p+<br>
source conductors 18C and 18D generally uniformly fill the trenches IOC and 10D to a<br>
uniform depth, contacting the fin 12B only at a bottom portion thereof. Those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will immediately understand that the order of processing (i.e., "nFET first" as<br>
described herein where n+ source conductors 18A and 18B are fonned first or or "pFET first"<br>
where p+ source conductors 18C and 18D are formed first) is not critical, and the inventive<br>
technique is readily adapted to either order of processing. Further, if only nFET devices or<br>
pFET devices are required, some intermediate steps can be eliminated.<br>
Figure 4 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 400 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 300 of Figure 3 after forming HDP oxide layers 20A, 20B, 20C and 20D on top of<br>
source conductors ISA, 18B, 18C and 18D, respectively. Preferably, the HDP oxide layers<br>
are formed by an HDP (High-density plasma) oxide deposition process followed by a<br>
sidewall etch. Assuming that the inchoate nFET and pFET transistors (generally indicated in<br>
the Figure as "nFET" and "pFET", respectively) are part of a larger, integrated<br>
semiconductor device, those of ordinary skill in the art will immediate appreciate and<br>
understand that any required gas phase doping and/or well implantation can be performed at<br>
this point using appropriately patterned masks.<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 500 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 400 of Figure 4 after forming gate insulators 22 and "driving in" source dopants<br>
from the source conductors 18A, 18B, 18C and 18D into the fins 12A and 12B to form source<br>
regions 26A and 26B, respectively, therein. Preferably, the gate insulators 22 are formed on<br>
exposed silicon sidewalls of the trenches 10A, 10B, IOC and 10D (including exposed<br>
sidewalls of the fins 12A and 12B) via a thermal oxide formation process. This same thermal<br>
process causes thermal diffusion "drive in" of the n+ source dopant in source conductors 18A<br>
and 18B into a bottom source-region portion 26A of the first fin 12A and of the p+ source<br>
dopant in source conductors 18C and 18D into a bottom source-region portion of the second<br>
fin 26B. If desired, additional heating can be employed to continue the source "drive in"<br>
thermal diffusion process. As shown in the Figure, the "driven in" source diffusion from<br>
opposite sides of the fins tends to overlap and mix (shown as overlapping curved lines in the<br>
source regions 26A and 26B). The HDP oxide layers 20A, 20B, 20C and 20D should be thin<br>
enough that the drive-in process causes the source-regions 26A and 26B to reach higher in<br>
the fins 12A and 12B than the upper surfaces of the HDP oxide layers 20A, 20B, 20C and<br>
20D. Note that although not shown in the Figure, the source "drive-in" process will also<br>
cause diffusion into the bottom portion of the silicon base 16B of the spacer structure.<br>
Appropriate inter-device isolation will be employed at an earlier or later step to prevent this<br>
extraneous source diffusion from creating any type of cross-coupling between devices.<br>
Figure 6 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 600 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 500 of Figure 5 after forming polysilicon gate conductors 24A, 24B, 24C and 24D<br>
(gate poly). Gate conductors 24A and 24B are disposed on opposite sides of the first fin 12A<br>
(in trenches 10A and 10B. respectively, and atop HDP oxide layers 22A and 22B,<br>
respectively), in contact with the gate insulators 22, and are n+ doped. Gate conductors 24C<br>
and 24D are disposed on opposite sides of the second fin 12B (in trenches IOC and 10D,<br>
respectively, and atop HDP oxide layers 22A and 22B, respectively), in contact with the gate<br>
insulators 22, and are p- doped. The gate conductors 24A, 24B, 24C and 24D extend<br>
vertically partway up the sides of the fins 12A and 12B. Preferably, the gate conductors 24A<br>
and 24B are created by forming a "pFET" mask that exposes only desired areas of the nFET<br>
device (generally indicated in the Figure as "nFET"), depositing n+ doped polysilicon.<br>
etching back to a suitable depth, masking the desired gate outline (nFET litho), and etching<br>
with a suitable highly directional etching process, e.g., reactive ion etching (RIE). Then a<br>
similar process can be employed to form gate conductors 24C and 24D (i.e., nFET mask, p+<br>
gate poly deposition, etch back, pFET litho, and RIE etch).<br>
As with the formation of the source conductors 18A-D, those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
immediately appreciate and understand that the order of formation of the gate conductors<br>
24A-D (i.e., n+ first or p- first) is not critical and the inventive technique is readily adapted<br>
to suit either order.<br>
Figure 7 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 700 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 600 of Figure 6 after implanting drain regions 28A and 28B in top portions of fins<br>
12A and 12B. Preferably, this is accomplished by (1) masking to expose the fin 12A of the<br>
inchoate nFET device (and any other similar fin of any other nFET device(s) being<br>
simultaneously formed on a larger integrated circuit) then n+ implanting through the mask by<br>
any suitable process to form the n+ doped drain region 28A to a depth that extends slightly<br>
lower in the fin 12A than the tops of the gate conductors 24A and 24B, then (2) removing the<br>
mask and re-masking to expose the fin 12B of the inchoate pFET device (and any other<br>
similar fin of any other pFET device(s) being simultaneously formed on a larger integrated<br>
circuit) and p+ implanting through the mask by any suitable process to form the p+ doped<br>
drain region 28B to a depth that extends slightly lower in the fin 12B than the tops of the gate<br>
conductors 24C and 24D. As before, the order of processing (n+ first or p+ first) is not<br>

Figure 8 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 800 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 700 of Figure 7 after forming nitride sidewall spacers 30. Preferably, the nitride<br>
spacers are formed by depositing nitride (by any suitable deposition process), then etching<br>
back such that the nitride covers all exposed vertical sidewalls, i.e., the exposed vertical<br>
sidewalls of trenches 10A, 10B, IOC and 10D, gate insulators 22, gate conductors 24A, 24B,<br>
24C and 24D, and nitride caps 14A, 14B and 16A.<br>
Figure 9 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 900 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 800 of Figure 8 after the formation of silicide gate contact structures 32A, 32B, 32C<br>
and 32D; and silicide source contract structures 34A, 34B, 34C and 34D. Preferably, these<br>
silicide structures are formed by etching through exposed portions of the HDP oxide layers<br>
20A, 20B, 20C and 20D to expose the polysilicon source conductors 18A, 18B, 18C and<br>
18D, then performing any suitable silicidation process to form silicide gate contact structures<br>
32A, 32B, 32C, and 32D in exposed portions of the gate conductors 24A, 24B, 24C and 24D,<br>
respectively and to form silicide source contact structures 34A, 34B, 34C and 34D in the<br>
newly exposed portions of the source conductors ISA, 18B, 18C and 18D, respectively. All<br>
silicide contact structures (32x and 34x) can be formed essentially simultaneously.<br>
Preferably, the silicide contact formation process comprises deposition of the appropriate<br>
metal for silicidation (e.g.. Cobalt for formation of CoSi:), silicidation by any suitable means<br>
(e.g., RTA) and removal of excess metal.<br>
Figure 10 is a cross-sectional diagram of a wafer substrate 1000 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 900 of Figure 9 after an oxide fill and planarization process. Preferably, a suitable<br>
trench-fill technique is employed to overfill the trenches 10A, 10B, IOC and 10D (see Figs 1-<br>
7) with oxide fill 36. The oxide fill 36 is then planarized via a CMP process.<br>
Figure 11 is a plan view of a wafer substrate 1100 representative of the wafer substrate 1000<br>
of Figure 10 after formation of metal source contacts 38A and 38B, drain contacts 40A and<br>
40B and gate contacts 42A and 42B. Preferably, the source contacts 38A and 38B and gate<br>
contacts 42A and 42B via a Damascene process whereby openings are formed in the oxide<br>
fill extending downward to corresponding silicide contact structures. The openings are filled<br>
(overfilled) with metal via a suitable metal deposition process and the metal is polished flush<br>
using CMP planarization process. The drain contacts 40A and 40B are preferably formed<br>
via a similar Damascene process whereby nitride caps 14A and 14B are selectively etched<br>
away to create openings that expose tops of the doped drain regions 28A and 28B.<br>
respectively of fins 12A and 12B, respectively. Metal deposition and CMP polishing are<br>
used in similar fashion to form the metal drain contacts 40A and 40B. At this same point,<br>
shallow trench isolation 36 is formed around each transistor device using conventional STI<br>
techniques. Note that the source contacts 38A and 38B and gate contacts 42A and 42B<br>
appear bifurcated. This is because the metal gate contact 42A connects to silicide gate<br>
contact structures 32A and 32B on both sides of the fin 12A. Similarly, gate contact 42B and<br>
source contacts 38A and 38B connect to respective silicide contact structures on both sides of<br>
their respective fins. This is shown and described in greater detail hereinbelow with respect<br>
to Figures 12, 13 and 14. Note that the gate contacts 42A and 42B extend only partway<br>
across their respective devices. Similarly the source contacts 38A and 38B extend only<br>
partway across their respective devices. Also note that the drain contacts 40A only extend<br>
laterally a short distance across their respective devices. This facilitates routing of<br>
subsequently formed wiring layers that connect to the devices.<br>
Figure 12 is a cross-sectional view of a wafer substrate 1200 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 1100 of Figure 11 as seen when sectioned at A-A' through the source contacts 38A<br>
and 38B. In the Figure, the two legs of bifurcated source contact 38A can be seen extending<br>
downward to contact the silicide source contact structures 34A and 34B on either side of fin<br>
12A. Similarly, the two legs of bifurcated source contact 38B are seen extending downward<br>
to contact the silicide source contact structures 34C and 34D on either side of fin 12B.<br>
Figure 13 is a cross-sectional view of a wafer substrate 1300 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 1100 of Figure 11 as seen when sectioned at B-B' through the drain contacts 40A<br>
and 40B. In the Figure, the drain contacts 40A and 40B can be seen extending downward to<br>
contact respective drain regions 28A and 28B in respective fins 12A and 12B.<br>
Figure 14 is a cross-sectional view of a wafer substrate 1400 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 1100 of Figure 11 as seen when sectioned at C-C' through the gate contacts 42A<br>
and 42B. In the Figure, the two legs of bifurcated gate contact 42A can be seen extending<br>
downward to contact the silicide gate contact structures 32A and 32B on either side of fin<br>
12A. Similarly, the two legs of bifurcated source contact 42B are seen extending downward<br>
to contact the silicide source contact structures 32C and 32D on either side of fin 12B.<br>
One alternate embodiment of the inventive vertical Fin-FET device employs a "fat drain"<br>
structure that improves drain contact resistance. This is shown and described with respect to<br>
Figure 15.<br>
Figure 15 is a cross-sectional view of a wafer substrate 1500 representative of the wafer<br>
substrate 1100 of Figure 11 as seen when sectioned at B-B' through "fat-drain" contacts 40A<br>
and 40B. In the Figure, the drain contacts 40A and 40B laterally overextend their respective<br>
fins 12A and 12B. The "fat-drain" contacts are preferably formed by masking off the desired<br>
drain contact profiles, performing a controlled nitride/oxide etch, disposing thin Si epitaxial<br>
layers 44A, 44B at the bottoms of the openings thus formed, then forming the metal drain<br>
contacts 40A and 40B by metal deposition and CMP polishing as described hereinabove.<br>
In some applications, it may be desirable for the source contacts to connect only to one side<br>
of their respective fin. Figure 16 is a plan view of a wafer substrate 1600 similar to the wafer<br>
substrate 1100 of Figure 11 except that the source contacts 38A and 38B are formed on only<br>
one side of their respective fins (12A, 12B).<br>
The gate contacts 42A and 42B are bifurcated to connect in common to silicide gate contact<br>
structures on both sides of their respective fins 12 A, 12B (see Figures 11, 14). In some<br>
applications, it may be desirable to provide separate gate contacts to the gate conductors on<br>
each side of the Fin-FET device, thereby creating a Fin-FET with multi-gate voltage control.<br>
This is shown and described with respect to Figure 17.<br>
Figure 17 is a plan view of a wafer substrate 1700 similar to the wafer substrate 1100 of<br>
Figure 11 except that instead of forming bifurcated gate contacts (see 42A, 42B, Fig. 11) the<br>
legs of the gate contacts are kept separate, thereby providing separate gate contacts 42AA,<br>
42AB, 42BA and 42BB connecting to respective silicide gate contact structures 32A, 32B,<br>
32C and 32D (see, e.g., Figs. 10, 14). This permits the gate contacts on each side of their<br>
respective Fin-FET devices to be controlled independently, thereby creating multi-gate<br>
vertical Fin-FETs.<br>
In applications that require higher drive currents, multi-fin versions of the vertical Fin-Fet<br>
structure can be formed. All gate contacts are connected in parallel, all drain contacts are<br>
connected in parallel and all source contacts are connected in parallel, effectively creating an<br>
array of parallel-connected vertical fin-FETs with effective channel width multiplied by the<br>
number of fins employed, and correspondingly improved drive current capability.<br>
Connecting to "left side" and "right side" silicide gate contact structures separately creates a<br>
dual-gate version of the multi-fin vertical fin-FET. A multi-fin vertical Fin-FET device is<br>
shown and described with respect to Figure 18.<br>
Figure 18 is a cross-sectional view of a wafer substrate 1800 on which a multi-fin version of<br>
the vertical Fin-FET device has been formed prior to metal contact formation. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will immediately understand that the processing steps required to<br>
create the multi-fin vertical finFET are essentially the same as those described hereinabove<br>
for creating single-fin devices. Three thin vertical fins 112A, 112B and 112C are formed,<br>
doped polysilicon source conductors 118A, 118B, 118C and 118D are formed alongside the<br>
fins 112A, 112B and 112C. The doping of the source conductors should be appropriate to the<br>
type of device being formed (n+ for nFET, p+ for pFET). HDP oxide insulating layers 120A,<br>
120B, 120C and 120D are formed atop source conductors 118A, 118A, 118C, and 118D,<br>
respectively. Gate insulators, gate conductors and nitride sidewall spacers are all formed in<br>
similar fashion to that described hereinabove. Silicide gate contact structures 132A. 132B,<br>
132C, 132D, 132E and 132F are formed in top surfaces of the gate conductors on each side of<br>
the fins 112A-112C and silicide source contact structures 134A, 134B, 134C, 134D. 134E<br>
and 134F are formed in top surfaces of the source conductors 118A, 118B, 118C, 118D,<br>
118E, and 118F, respectively. An oxide trench fill 136 is deployed and planarized as<br>
described hereinabove. Subsequent processing steps form metal gate, source and drain<br>
contacts in similar fashion to that described hereinabove for single-fin devices.<br>
It is generally assumed that the present inventive vertical Fin-FET device will be applied to<br>
larger CMOS (complementary MOS) circuits. It is fully within the spirit and scope of the<br>
present invention to do so. Accordingly, the descriptions hereinabove with respect Figures 1-<br>
17 have shown nFET and pFET devices side-by-side. Typically these devices will be part of<br>
a CMOS circuit, which may in turn be part of a larger integrated circuit device employing<br>
many such CMOS circuits. Further, individual nFET and pFET versions of the inventive<br>
vertical Fin-FET can be employed in any type of circuit (including non-complementary<br>
circuits) on an integrated device with or without other CMOS circuits. Those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will understand that through appropriate masking, any desired combination of<br>
nFET and pFET vertical Fin-FET devices can be created.<br>
In the description of the inventive vertical Fin-FET and its various embodiments, specific<br>
reference has been made hereinabove to "drain contacts" and "drain regions" generally<br>
located at top portions of the fins and "source contact structures", "source conductors" and<br>
"source regions" generally located at bottom portions of the fins. Those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will understand that as with many MOS devices, the designations "source" and "drain"<br>
can be interchanged, thereby reversing the presumed direction of current flow within the<br>
transistor, although performance may or may not be identical in both directions.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate and understand that any of the various<br>
aspects and embodiments of the inventive technique can be used alone or in combination<br>
(e.g., dual-gate, single-side source, fat drain, multi-fin, etc.). For example, a dual-gate, multifin<br>
device has already been described. By way of further example, the "fat drain" structure<br>
can also be employed in dual-gate and/or multi-fin variants of the vertical Fin-FET.<br>
Processing steps as described hereinabove have generally been presented in "nFET first<br>
order" whereby nFET structures are formed first, followed by pFET structures. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will immediately understand that the order of processing is not<br>
critical, and that the inventive technique is readily adapted to either order of processing.<br>
Further, if only nFET devices or pFET devices are required, some intermediate steps can be<br>
eliminated.<br>
The vertical Fin-FET device of the present invention provides several advantages in addition<br>
to the high-density advantages that derive from its vertical orientation. The "double-gate"<br>
feature is an inherent feature of the device and provides a significant advantage in offering<br>
improved drive current. Drive current can be further enhanced by creating multiple-fin<br>
versions of the vertical Fin-FET as described hereinabove with respect to Figure 18. The<br>
same process steps can be used to create both single-fin and multi-fin devices, so there is no<br>
processing penalty in mixing them on a single integrated circuit device.<br>
The present invention has been described hereinabove specifically with respect to siliconbased<br>
semiconductor technology. Those of ordinary skill in the art will immediately<br>
understand that similar techniques can be employed to produce equivalent structures having<br>
vertically oriented transistor "fin" bodies with vertical current flow using other<br>
semiconductor technologies. The description in terms of silicon-based semiconductor<br>
technology hereinabove should be viewed as exemplary rather than limiting.<br>
Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to a certain preferred<br>
embodiment or embodiments, certain equivalent alterations and modifications will occur to<br>
others skilled in the art upon the reading and understanding of this specification and the<br>
annexed drawings. In particular regard to the various functions performed by the above<br>
described components (assemblies, devices, circuits, etc.) the terms (including a reference to<br>
a "means") used to describe such components are intended to correspond, unless otherwise<br>
indicated, to any component which performs the specified function of the described<br>
componente., that is functionally equivalent), even though not structurally equivalent to<br>
the disclosed structure which performs the function in the herein illustrated exemplary<br>
embodiments of the invention. In addition, while a particular feature of the invention may<br>
have been disclosed with respect to only one of several embodiments, such feature may be<br>
combined with one or more features of the other embodiments as may be desired and<br>
advantageous for any given or particular application.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
