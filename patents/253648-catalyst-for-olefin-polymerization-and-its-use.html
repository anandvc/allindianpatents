				<td>Catalyst for Olefin Polymerization and its Use<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for olefin polymerization, in particular, to<br>
a catalyst comprising silicon ether compounds having a novel structure, and to use of<br>
the catalyst in olefin polymerization, especially in propylene polymerization. The catalyst<br>
system exhibits good hydrogen responsibility, and can be used to prepare polymer<br>
having high isotacticity at high yield.<br>
Background Art<br>
Catalysts for olefin polymerization or copolymerization are well known in the<br>
literatures. These catalysts typically comprise a transition metal-containing active<br>
component, generally comprising magnesium, titanium and halogen as main ingredients;<br>
a cocatalyst component, typically organo-aluminium compound; and external electron<br>
donor component, typically organo-silicon compound. For stereoelective polymerization<br>
of olefin, especially stereoelective polymerization of propylene, if no external electron<br>
donor component is used, most of these catalysts give a polymer having lower<br>
isotacticity, typically lower than 90%, so that they are not applicable to industrial scale<br>
production. Therefore, the addition of external electron donor component is often<br>
necessary.<br>
At present, the types of external electron donor compounds have developed from<br>
initial benzoates to current organosiloxane. For instance, WO 00/63261 discloses<br>
external electron donor compounds useful in olefin polymerization, i.e. silicon<br>
compounds having a general formula R11aR12bSi(OR13)c, wherein a and b are integer<br>
from 0 to 2, c is integer from 1 to 3, and the sum of a+b+c is 4, R11, R12 and R13 are<br>
independently C1-C18 hydrocarbyl which optionally contains a heteroatom. The preferred<br>
are those silicon compounds in which a is 1, b is 1, c is 2, at least one of R11 and R12 is<br>
selected from the group consisting of branched alkyl, alkenyl, alkylene, cycloalkyl and<br><br>
aryl, having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms and containing optionally a heteroatom, and R13<br>
is C1-C10 alkyl, especially methyl, for example, cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane. The<br>
also preferred are those silicon compounds in which a is O, b is 1, c is 3, R12 is branched<br>
alkyl or cycloalkyl, containing optionally a heteroatom, and R13 is methyl, for example,<br>
cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane and the like.<br>
It is noted that, among the silicon compounds having the general formula<br>
R11aR12bSi(OR13)C, those silicon compounds wherein c is 1 are generally not deemed as<br>
good external electron donor compounds. In the prior art, y-trihydrocarbylsilyloxy ether<br>
compounds have never been used as external electron donor compounds in olefin<br>
polymerization. However, the inventors have surprisingly found that, when used as<br>
external electron donor compounds in olefin polymerization, especially in propylene<br>
polymerization, y-trihydrocarbylsilyloxy-ether or -silicon ether compounds exhibit good<br>
properties, for instance, the catalyst system exhibits good hydrogen responsibility, and<br>
can be used to prepare polymer having high isotacticity at high yield.<br>
Description the invention<br>

halogen, C1-C20 linear or branched alkyl, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, C6-C20 aryl, C7-C20 alkaryl or<br>
C7-C20 aralkyl, and two or more of R1-R12 groups can be linked to form saturated or<br>
unsaturated ring structure(s), which is/are optionally substituted by a group having the<br>
same meanings as that of R1-R12 groups; R1-R12 groups optionally contain one or more<br>
hetero-atoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, silicon,<br>
phosphorus and halogen atom for replacing carbon atom(s), hydrogen atom(s) or the<br>
both; and A represents carbon atom or silicon atom.<br>
In the above general formula (I), it is preferable that R1-R10 groups, which are<br>
identical to or different from each other, represent hydrogen, halogen, C1-C10 linear or<br>
branched alkyl, or C6-C10 aryl.<br>

Initially, the magnesium compound is dissolved in a solvent system consisting of<br>
the organic epoxy compound, the organophosphorus compound, and an inert diluent to<br>
form a homogeneous solution. Then the solution is mixed with the titanium compound,<br>

entirety, describes in detail the preparation of the solid titanium-containing catalyst<br>
components according to the above embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the solid titanium-containing catalyst<br>
components can be prepared by reacting the titanium compound having the formula<br><br>

In the formula of MgCI2.pROH, p is a value of from 0.1 to 6, preferably from 2 to 3.5,<br>
and R is hydrocarbyl having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. The adduct can be<br>
advantageously formed into spheric shape according to the following process: the<br>
alcohol is mixed with magnesium dichloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon<br>
which is not miscible with the adduct, and the resultant emulsion is quenched quickly to<br>
solidify the adduct in the form of spheric particles. Such obtained adduct can directly<br>
react with the titanium compound, alternatively, before it reacts with the titanium<br>
compound, it can be subjected to a heat control dealcoholization at a temperature of<br>
from 80 to 130°C to obtain an adduct, in which the p value is generally lower than 3,<br>
preferably in a range of from 0.1 to 2.7. The adduct (dealcoholized or as-such) can be<br>
suspended in cool TiCI4 (typically at 0°C), and reacted with the titanium compound by<br>
programmed heating the reaction mixture to a temperature of from 80 to 130°C and<br>
holding at said temperature for 0.1 to 2 hours. The TiCI4 treatment can be carried out for<br>
one or more times. During the TiCI4 treatment, the internal electron donor compound can<br>
be added, and this treatment can also be repeated for one or more times.<br>
CN1036011C and CN1330086A, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference in their entirety, describe in detail the preparation of the solid<br>
titanium-containing catalyst components according to the above embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The organo-aluminum component of the catalysts according to the invention can be<br>

ratio of titanium : aluminum : silicon.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide use of the catalysts as described above<br>

hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl or aryl, or in copolymerization of said olefin with an alpha olefin<br>
comonomer having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for olefin polymerization,<br>
comprising contacting, under polymerization conditions, an olefin having a formula of<br>
CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl or aryl, and optional an alpha olefin<br>
comonomer having from 2 to 20 carbon atoms with the catalysts according to invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymerization" includes homopolymerization and<br>
copolymerization.<br>
More specifically, the invention is to provide a process for propylene polymerization,<br>
comprising contacting propylene and optional an alpha olefin comonomer having from 2<br>
to 20 carbon atoms with the catalyst according to the invention under polymerization<br>
conditions.<br>
The catalysts of the invention can be used in various known olefin polymerization<br>
processes, especially in propylene homopolymerization or copolyerization, including<br>
continuous polymerization and batch polymerization processes. For instance, the<br>
polymerization can be carried out in slurry phase with inert hydrocarbon solvents as<br>
diluent or in bulk with liquid monomers, such as propylene, as reaction media.<br>
Alternatively, the polymerization may be carried out in gas phase in one or more<br>
fluidized-bed or mechanically agitated bed reactors. A polymerization process<br>
comprising a combination of gas phase polymerization and liquid phase polymerization<br>
is also contemplated.<br>
The polymerization reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of from 0 to<br>
150°C, typically from 20 to 120°C, more typically from 40 to 100°C. When the<br><br>
polymerization is carried out in gas phase, operation pressure is usually in a range of<br>
from 0.5 to 10 MPa (absolute pressure, the same hereinafter), preferably from 1 to 5<br>
MPa. The operation pressure in bulk polymerization is usually in a range of from 1 to<br>
6MPa, preferably from 1.5 to 4MPa. Hydrogen or other compounds which act as<br>
chain-transfer agent can be used to control the molecular weight of polymers.<br>

Preparation of 9-methoxymethyl-9-hydroxymethyl-fluorene<br>
Under nitrogen atmosphere and water-free conditions, to a reactor were added in<br>
succession 80 ml of THF, 22.6 g of 9,9-bis(hydroxymethyl)fluorene and 57 g of methyl<br>
iodide. After the reaction mixture was admixed homogeneously by stirring, 4.6 g of 52%<br>
NaH in mineral oil was added batch-wise over 2 hours at room temperature. Upon<br>
completing the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred for further 2 hours. The<br>
unreacted methyl iodide was recovered by distillation. The remainder was diluted with<br>
100 ml of water, and extracted twice using 100 ml of diethyl ether for each time. The<br>
combined diethyl ether extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After drying,<br><br>
the ether solution was evaporated to dryness to give 22.8 g of crude. The crude was<br>
purified through column chromatography to give 14.9g of<br>
9-methoxymethyl-9-hydroxymethyl-fluorene (yield 62%).<br>

Preparation of the solid titanium-containing catalyst component<br>
To a reactor that had been completely purged with N2 were added successively 4.8g<br>
of magnesium chloride, 95ml of toluene, 4ml of epichlorohydrin, and 12.5ml of tributyl<br><br>
phosphate. With stirring, the mixture was heated to 50°C and held at the temperature for<br>
2.5 hours, thereby the solid was dissolved completely. Then 1.4g of phthalic anhydride<br>
was added thereto and the reaction mixture was held at that temperature with stirring for<br>
further one hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to below -25°C and 56ml of TiCI4 was<br>
added dropwise thereto over one hour, then the temperature was increased slowly to<br>
80°C. Solid precipitated gradually during the heating. To the system were added 6 mmol<br>
of di-n-butyl phthalate, and the reaction was held at the temperature with stirring for<br>
further one hour. After removing the supernatant, to the residue was added 70ml of<br>
toluene and the supernatant was removed again after mixing completely. The washing<br>
procedure was repeated twice. The resulting solid precipitate was treated with 60ml of<br>
toluene and 40ml of TiCI4 at 100°C for 2 hours, and after removing the supernatant, the<br>
residue was treated with 60ml of toluene and 40ml of TiCl4 at 100°C for 2 hours again.<br>
After removing the supernatant, the residue was washed with 60ml toluene under boiling<br>
state for three times, washed with 60ml hexane under boiling state for two times,<br>
washed with 60ml hexane at room temperature for two times, to yield the solid<br>
titanium-containing catalyst component.<br>
Examples 1-38 utilize, respectively, the silicon ether compounds as prepared in<br>
above Preparation Examples 1-38 as external electron donor, and Comparative Example<br>
1 utilizes methylcyclohexyldimethoxysilane as external electron donor, in the propylene<br>
polymerization experiment carried out according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 5L stainless steel autoclave, which had been replaced with propylene gas<br>
completely, were added 2.5mmol AIEt3, 0.1 mmol said silicon ether compounds used as<br>
external electron donor, about 10mg of the solid titanium-containing catalyst component<br>
prepared above, and 1L of hydrogen, followed by introduction of 2.3L of liquid propylene.<br>
The reactor was heated to 70°C, and the polymerization was performed at that<br>
temperature for one hour. After the temperature was reduced and the pressure was<br>
relieved, PP powder was removed.<br>
Polymerization results were summarized in Tables 1-4.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 39-40 and Comparative Example 2: Propylene Polymerization Experiment<br>
Examples 39 and 40 utilize, respectively, the silicon ether compounds as prepared<br>
in above Preparation Examples 7 and 18 as external electron donor, and Comparative<br>
Example 2 utilizes methylcyclohexyldimethoxysilane as external electron donor in the<br>
propylene polymerization experiment carried out according to the same polymerization<br>
procedure as described in Examples 1-38, except for that the amount of hydrogen gas<br>
was changed to 4L. Polymerization results were summarized in Table 5. For comparison,<br>
the results obtained in Examples 7 and 18 as well as in Comparative Example 1 were<br>
also shown in Table 5.<br><br>
It can be seen from the data given in Table 5 that, at the same hydrogen gas level,<br>
the polymerization using the silicon ether compounds according to the invention as<br>
external electron donor will give polymers having higher melt index than the<br>
polymerization using the silane compound commonly used in the art as external electron<br>
donor. As the level of hydrogen gas increases, melt index increases more notably. This<br>
performance facilitates the development of various grades of polymers.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in connection with embodiments<br><br>
and examples, further modifications and alternative embodiments of various aspects of<br>
the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this description.<br>
