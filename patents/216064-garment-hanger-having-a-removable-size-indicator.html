				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application s/n 09/479, 170 filed<br>
January 7, 2000.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a garment hanger of the type having a<br>
removable size indicator and, more particularly, to a garment hanger having a size indicator<br>
which may be removed by way of a tool which engages a pivoting latch.<br>
2. Prior Art<br>
U.S. Patent 3,949,914 illustrates a hanger with a modified hook which accepts a<br>
size indicator which clips onto one of the flanges which define the hook structure.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,115,940 illustrates a hanger having a size indicator or sizing tab<br>
which attaches to a tab mounting member mounted between the hanger hook and the hanger<br>
body. Hangers having size indicators mounted in this position are generally referred to in the<br>
trade as side sizers.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,322,902 illustrates a hanger having a display portion formed at the<br>
top of the hook which may accept two different types of size indicators. One type fastens to the<br>
display portion like a tie-tac, and the other slips over the top of the display portion. Hangers<br>
having size indicators mounted in this position are generally referred to in the trade as top sizers.<br>
U.S.. Patent 5,485,943 is typical of a number of patents which disclose one or<br>
more means to prevent inadvertent removal of the side sizer by blocking access to the edges of<br>
the side sizer, thereby preventing young children from obtaining "finger purchase" on the edge<br>
of the side sizer to pry it off.<br>
U.S. Patents 5,469,995; 5,778,575; 5,469,995; 5096,101; 5,950,883; 5,683,018;<br>
5,642,840; 5,611,469; and 5,407,109 all illustrate hangers having various means to make the side<br>
sizer "substantially unremovable" or "irremovable" once the sizing tab engages the tab holder on<br>
the hanger. The intent is to make the hanger and sizing system "child proof, and thereby<br>
prevent a child from inadvertently removing the tab, and swallowing or choking on the side sizer.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,449,099 is one of several patents on a hanger and side sizer system<br>
that provides a tool for removing the side sizer if it is inadvertently applied, or if the hanger is<br>
later used to hang a garment of a different size. Multiple cuts are provided through the security<br>
rib and the attachment member to enable a special tool to pry the indicator from the hanger.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,687,887 illustrates another design for a hanger and side sizer that<br>
enables a special tool to slide through cuts in the security rib and thereby remove the side sizer.<br>
U..S. Patent 5,794,363 illustrates a hanger hook adapted to receive a top sizer,<br>
which hanger hook has a resilient detent engagement means for securing the top sizer which<br>
enables the top sizer to be automatically removed for re-use of the hanger.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a garment hanger with a novel<br>
size indicator and indicator attachment mechanism.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a garment hanger with a<br>
removable size indicator.<br>
It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a garment hanger with<br>
a removable size indicator that may be mounted on the top of the hook or at the side of the hook.<br>
It is still yet a further object of the present invention to provide a garment hanger<br>
with a removable size indicator that is securely affixed to the hanger during use, and is thereby<br>
"child proof, yet which may be quickly and easily removed with a tool when it is desired to re-<br>
use the hanger with a garment of a different size. <br>
Accordingly, a garment hanger having a removable size indicator is provided.<br>
The garment hanger comprises: a hanging means for suspending the hanger on a support and a<br>
body connected to the hanging means; the hanger having at least one web for removably securing<br>
a size indicator to the hanger, the web having a fixed latch and a pivoting latch; and a size<br>
indicator having a triangular cross-section and finger means for engaging the fixed and pivoting<br>
latches such that the size indicator is secured on the web, wherein the size indicator is released<br>
from the fixed latch when the pivoting latch is pivoted out of engagement with the finger means<br>
of the size indicator.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the garment hanger of the present invention, the<br>
hanging means is a hook and the web is located at either, a junction between the hook and the<br>
body, at a top portion of the hook, or at both locations.<br>
In another preferred implementation of the garment hanger of the present<br>
invention, the pivoting latch is located at a central portion of the web and the fixed latch is<br>
located on at least one end of the pivoting latch. Preferably, the fixed latch is located adjacent<br>
each end of the pivoting latch, with the pivoting latch projecting from a first side of the web and<br>
the fixed latch projecting from an opposite side of the web.<br>
In yet another preferred implementation of the garment hanger of the present<br>
invention, the pivoting latch is defined by a slot cut through the web, the slot having a shape<br>
defined by at least two sides, the pivoting latch being further defined by a living binge closing<br>
the shape of the slot Preferably, the slot is two sided and the living hinge closes the shape of the<br>
slot thereby forming a triangular shaped pivoting latch. The pivoting latch further having an<br>
engagement means for facilitating the pivoting of the pivoting latch. Preferably, the engagement<br>
means comprises a cantilevered end of the pivoting latch which when a releasing force is applied<br>
thereto provides a mechanical advantage for pivoting the pivoting latch out of engagement with<br>
at least one engagement abutment and finger means of the size indicator. The web further has a<br>
guard extending across the web and below the size indicator, the guard having a down-turned<br>
portion which follows the contours of the cantilevered end. The guard protects the cantilevered<br>
end from inadvertent actuation. The cantilevered end preferably has engagement means adapted<br>
to receive a tool used for application of the releasing force. The engagement means is preferably<br>
a dimple formed on a side of the cantilevered end.<br>
In a preferred implementation of the garment hanger of the present invention, the<br>
size indicator preferably has two sides depending from and apex, each of the sides terminating in<br>
a foremost edge, the foremost edges being configured such that the cantilevered end of the<br>
pivoting latch is exposed .when the size indicator is secured on the web. The finger means of the<br>
size indicator preferably comprises an inwardly facing ridge disposed at each of the foremost<br>
edges and projecting inwards towards the channel.<br>
In yet another preferred implementation of the garment hanger of the present<br>
invention, the web further comprises an outermost edge having an outermost portion or a<br>
predetermined cross-section, the apex of the size indicator forming a trough which is<br>
substantially configured to receive an outermost portion of the web therebetween for preventing a<br>
lateral movementof the size indicator when the size indicator is secured on the web.<br>
In still yet another preferred implementation of the garment hanger of the present<br>
invention, the web further comprises locating guides for locating the size indicator in a<br>
predetermined position on the web. The locating guides preferably comprise first and second<br>
guides disposed on each of the side edges of the size indicator and spaced apart to fit the size<br>
indicator therein to center the size indicator between the guides when it is applied. Preferably<br>
each of the first and second guides do not extend the full length of the side of the size indicator.<br>
Still yet provided is a size indicator to be removably secured to a web of a<br>
garment hanger. The size indicator comprises two sides depending from an apex defining a V-<br>
shaped channel, each of the sides terminating in a foremost edge, the apex defining a trough<br>
substantially configured to receive an outermost portion of the web therebetween for preventing a<br>
lateral movement of the size indicator when the size indicator is secured on the web. Each of the<br>
sides have an inwardly facing ridge disposed at each of the foremost edges and projecting<br>
inwards towards the channel for engaging a fixed ridge and a pivoting ridge on the web. The<br>
cross section of the size indicator enables the size indicator to be extruded and then cut into<br>
sections. The indicators may be printed before or after cutting. This process substantially<br>
lowers the cost of producing size indicators as compared to the cost of producing indicators<br>
which must be individually molded.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a hanger hook is provided which has<br>
provisions for receiving either a side sizer or a top sizer as desired. This reduces the inventory of<br>
hangers required for a garment manufacturer who ships to both types of retail environments, i.e.,<br>
retail stores which desire side sizers, and those who desire top sizers. Alternately, if desired,<br>
both could be affixed to the hook. In this embodiment, the top sizer is longer than the side sizer<br>
to provide greater visibility and visual harmony with other top sizer hangers, although the top<br>
web and the side web could be formed to receive the same length of size indicator, thereby<br>
allowing the manufacturer to use the same size indicator as either a side sizer or a top sizer.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Although this invention is applicable to numerous and various types of hangers, it<br>
has been found particularly useful in the environment of garment hangers having a hook for<br>
suspending the garment hanger from a display. Therefore, without limiting the applicability of<br>
the invention to these types of hangers, the invention will be described in such environment.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a first embodiment of the garment<br>
hanger of the present invention, generally referred to by reference numeral 100a. The garment<br>
hanger 100a has a hanging means, such as a hook 102, for supporting the hanger 100a on a<br>
display (not shown). The hanger 100a further having a body 104 connected to the hook 102.<br>
The body has at least one web 106a for removably securing a first version of a first embodiment<br>
of a size indicator 108a (FIG. 2a) to the body 104. In a first embodiment of the garment hanger<br>
of the present invention, illustrated in FIG 1, the web 106a is located at a junction between the<br>
hook 102 and the body 104. As will be discussed below with regard to FIG. 8, in a second<br>
embodiment of the garment hanger of the present invention, generally referred to by reference<br>
numeral 100b, the web 106b can be alternatively located at a top portion 102a of the hook 102.<br>
Furthermore, as will be discussed below with regard to FIG. 11, in a third embodiment of the<br>
garment hanger of the present invention, generally referred to by reference numeral 100c, the<br>
web 106b can be alternatively located at both the junction between the hook 102 and the body<br>
104 and at the top portion 102a of the hook 102.<br>
Referring Now to FIG. 3a, the web has a fixed latch 110 and a pivoting latch 112.<br>
The pivoting latch 112 is preferably located at a central portion of the web 106a and the fixed<br>
latch 110 is located on at least one end of the pivoting latch 112. Preferably, the fixed latch 110,<br>
as shown in FIG. 3, comprises two abutments 110a, 110b located on each end of the pivoting<br>
latch 112. As illustrated in FIGS. 4-7, and most clearly in FIGS. 6a and 6b, it is also preferable<br>
that the pivoting latch 112 projects from a first side 114 of the web 106a and the fixed latch 110<br>
projects from an opposite side 116 of the web 106a.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 3a, the pivoting latch 112 is preferably defined by a slot<br>
118 cut through the web 106a. The slot preferably has a shape defined by at least two sides<br>
118a, 118b. The pivoting latch 112 is further defined by a living hinge, shown by dotted line 120<br>
closing the shape of the slot 118. As shown in FIG. 3a, the slot 118 is preferably substantially<br>
two sided 118a, 118b and the living hinge 120 closes the shape of the slot 118 thereby forming a<br>
triangular shaped pivoting latch 112. It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the<br>
pivoting latch and the slot defining fee shape thereof, can have a variety of shapes, such as<br>
rectangular, without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 3a, 3b, and 6a in combination, the pivoting latch 112<br>
preferably has an engagement means for facilitating movement of the pivoting latch about arrow<br>
A shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. The engagement means preferably comprises a cantilevered end<br>
122 of the pivoting latch 112 which when a releasing force (F) is applied thereto provides a<br>
mechanical advantage for movement of the pivoting latch 112 out of engagement with the si2e<br>
indicator. Simultaneously, the opposite side of the pivoting latch 112 displaces the size indicator<br>
such that it no longer engages the fixed latch 110.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 2a, 2b, and 6a in combination, a first version of the size<br>
indicator 108a of the first embodiment generally has a face 124 and two sides 126, 128<br>

outermost portion 142a therein for preventing a lateral movement of the size indicator along<br>
direction B-B when the size indicator 108a is secured on the web 106a. The preferable<br>
predetermined cross-section of both the outermost portion 142a and the trough 144 is<br>
substantially rectangular. In the second version of the size indicator 111 a the inner portion of the<br>
apex 125 forms a trough 144a which is shaped such that the outermost portion 142a is accepted<br>
therein when the size indicator 11 la is secured on the web 106a to prevent lateral movement of<br>
the size indicator 111a along direction B-B (illustrated in FIG. 6b).<br>
Referring to FIG. 3b, the web 106a further comprises locating means for locating<br>
the size indicator 108a, 111 a in a predetermined position on the web 106a. The locating means<br>
preferably comprises first and second guides 146a, 146b disposed adjacent each side edge 148a,<br>
148b of the size indicator 108a, 111a and spaced apart to align the size indicator 108a, 111a<br>
therebetween and to center the.size indicator 108a, 111a during application thereof on the web<br>
106a. Preferably, the first and second guides 146a, 146b do not extend the full length of the side<br>
edges 148a, 148b of the size indicator but define elongate openings 150a, 150b which expose the<br>
side edges 148a, 148b of the size indicator.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6a and 7a, the operation of the garment hanger 100a of<br>
the present invention will be explained with regard to size indicator 108a. Size indicator 108a is<br>
mounted on the web 106a by sliding it over web 106a in the direction of arrow C. While being<br>
mounted in the direction of arrow C, the pivoting latch 112 pivots in the direction of arrow A<br>
until the inwardly facing ridges 134a, 134b of ringer means 134 pass over the fixed and pivoting<br>
ridges 110, 112. After which, the inwardly facing fingers 134a, 134b snap into place in an area<br>
defined by the guide 136 and a bottom edge of the fixed and pivoting ridges 110, 112, the area<br>
being referenced by reference numeral 152 (illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5). As such, the size<br>
indicator 108a is releasably secured on the web 106a.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6b and 7b, the operation of the garment hanger 100a of<br>
the present invention will be explained with regard to second version of the first embodiment of<br>
the size indicator 111a. Similar to the manner in which size indicator 108a is mounted, size<br>
indicator 111a is mounted on the web 106a by sliding it in the direction of arrow C over web<br>
106b. While being mounted in the direction of arrow C, the pivoting latch 112 pivots in the<br>
direction of arrow A until the inwardly facing ridges 134a, 134b of finger means 134 pass over<br>
the fixed and pivoting ridges 110, 112. After which, the inwardly facing fingers 134a, 134b snap<br>
into place in an area defined by the guide 136 and a bottom edge of the fixed and pivoting ridges<br>
110, 112, the area being referenced by reference numeral 152 (illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5).<br>
To release the size indicators 108a, 111a from the web 106a, a releasing force (F)<br>
is applied to the cantilevered end 122 of the pivoting latch 112, preferably by engaging the<br>
dimple 140 thereon with a release tool (not shown). The release force (F) results in the pivoting<br>
latch 112 to pivot about the living hinge 120 in the direction of arrow A. As can be seen in<br>
FIGS. 7a and 7b, planar side wall of the pivoting latch 112 causes the inner ridge 134a of the<br>
finger means 134 of size indicators 108a, 111a to extend past the furthest extending portion of<br>
the fixed latch 110. At this point, the size indicator 108a, 111a may be manually removed from<br>
the web 106a.<br>
Preferably, the size indicators 108a, 111 a are fabricated from a resilient material<br>
and thereby the sides 126, 128 may be slightly biased towards each other. Thus, when the side<br>
126 of the size indicator 108a, 111a extends past the furthest extending portion of the fixed latch<br>
110 the resilient bias of the size indicator 108a, 111a pops the size indicator off of the web<br>
automatically, without further manual intervention.<br>
Preliminary testing of the releasable size indicators 108a, 111a of the present<br>
invention has indicated that a force of approximately 25-30 pounds is needed to pull the size<br>
indicators from the latches of the web. Thus, the size indicators 108a, 111a of the present<br>
invention are considered to be child-proof, since industry standards require a minimum force of<br>
15 pounds to pull off a size indicator from a hanger for the size indicator to be considered child-<br>
proof.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 8, 9a, 9b, and 10, there is illustrated a second embodiment<br>
of the garment hanger of the present invention, generally referred to by reference numeral 100b<br>
and in which like reference numerals denote like elements as previously discussed. The garment<br>
hanger 100b differs from garment hanger 100a illustrated in FIG. 1 in that a second web 106b is<br>
disposed at a top portion 102a of the hook 102. Generally, the second web 106b differs from the<br>
first web 106a by the inclusion of first and second pivoting latches 212a, 212b.<br>
Referring Now to FIG. 10, the web 106b has a fixed latch 210 and first and<br>
second pivoting latches 212a, 212b. The fixed latch 210 is preferably located at a central portion<br>
of the web 106b and each of the pivoting latches 212a, 212b is located each end of the fixed latch<br>

side of the web 106b and the fixed latch 210 project from an opposite side of the web 106b.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 10, each pivoting latch 212a, 212b is preferably defined by<br>
a slot 218a, 218b cut through the web 106b. Each slot preferably has a triangular shape as<br>
discussed above with regard to hanger 100a. Each slot 218a, 218b is defined by a living hinge,<br>
shown by dotted lines 220a, 220b closing the shape of each slot 218a, 218b.<br>
As discussed above with regard to hanger 100a, each pivoting latch 212a, 212b<br>
preferably has an engagement means for facilitating movement of the pivoting latch. The<br>
engagement means preferably comprises a cantilevered end 222a, 222b of the pivoting latch<br>
212a, 212b which when the releasing force (F) is applied thereto provides a mechanical<br>
advantage for movement of each pivoting latch 212a, 212b out of engagement with a first or<br>
second version of a second embodiment of a size indicator 108b, 111b, respectively.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 9a and 9b, in combination, the first version of the second<br>
embodiment of the size indicator 108b generally has a face 224 and two sides 226, 228<br>
depending therefrom to form a generally C-shaped channel 209. Each of the sides 226,228<br>
terminate in a foremost edge 230, 232. The foremost edges 230,232 are preferably configured<br>
such that the cantilevered end 222a, 222b of each of the pivoting latches 212a, 212b are exposed<br>
when the size indicator 108b is secured on the web 106b.<br>
In an alternative version, a second size indicator of the second embodiment is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 9c in which like reference numerals refer to similar features, the second size<br>
indicator of the second embodiment being referred to generally by reference numeral 111b. Size<br>
indicator 111b having a cross-sectional shape similar to that of size indicator 11 la, in that the<br>
side walls 226 and 228 meet at an apex 225 and define a V-shaped cavity 213.<br>
The first and second size indicators 108b, 111b of the second embodiment further<br>
have finger means 234 for engaging the fixed and pivoting latches 210, 212a, and 212b,<br>
respectively, such that the size indicators 108b, 111b are secured on the web 106b during normal<br>
use. However, the size indicators 108b, 111b are releasably secured on the web 106b such that<br>
they may be released from the web 106b when.both of the pivoting latches 212a, 212b are<br>
pivoted out of engagement with the finger means 234 of the size indicators 108b, 111b when a<br>
release force is applied. The finger means 234 preferably comprises inwardly facing ridges 234a,<br>
234b disposed at each of the foremost edges 230, 232 and projecting inwards towards the<br>
channel 209, 213 of the size indicators 108b, 111b.<br>
Although a size indication can be disposed on either the top or side surfaces of<br>
second size indicator 108b of the second embodiment, it is preferable that size indicator 108 a of<br>
the first embodiment have the size indication 107 disposed on the face 124 of the size indicator<br>
108a and the size indicator 108b of the second embodiment have the size indication 207 on both<br>
sides 226, 228 of the size indicator 108b. Because size indicators 111a, 11b are triangular in<br>
cross-section, the size indication 107, 207, can only be displayed on the sides thereof (126, 128<br>
for size indicator 111a; 226, 228 for size indicator 111b).<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the web 106b preferably also has a mounting hedge 236<br>
extending partially across the web 106b and below the size indicator 108b to provide external<br>
support for the edges 230, 232 of the size indicator. Each of the cantilevered ends and<br>
engagement means 222a, 222b are preferably configured to engage a tool (not shown) used for<br>
application of the releasing force (F). The engagement means is preferably a dimple 240a, 240b<br>
formed on a side of each of the cantilevered ends 222a, 222b. The tool being configured as<br>
described above with regard to hanger 100a. .<br>
The web 106b preferably also has an outermost edge 242 having an outermost<br>

therein for preventing a lateral movement of the size indicator when the size indicator 108b is<br>
secured on the web 106b. The preferable predetermined cross-section of both the outermost<br>
portion and the trough 244 is substantially rectangular. The second version of the second<br>
embodiment of the size indicator 111b, like size indicator 111a, has a trough 244a which is<br>
shaped such that the outermost portion is accepted therein when the size indicator 111b is<br>
secured on the web 106a to prevent lateral movement of the size indicator 111b along direction<br>
B-B.<br>
The web 106b further comprises locating means for locating the size indicators<br>
108b, 111b in a predetermined position on the web 106b. The locating means are formed from<br>
reinforcing webs of the hanger hook and preferably comprises first and second guides 246a, 246b<br>
disposed adjacent each side edge 248a, 248b of the size indicators 108b, 111b and spaced apart<br>
to align the size indicators 108b, 111b therebetween and to center the size indicators 108b, 111b<br>
during application thereof on the web 106b.<br>
The operation of the hanger 100b of the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention operates substantially equivalently to that of the hanger 100a of the first embodiment.<br>
It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that both pivoting latches 212a, 212b are pivoted<br>
by application of the release force to release the size indicators 108b, 111b from the web 106b.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a hanger of a third embodiment of the present invention<br>
generally referred to by reference numeral 100c. The hanger 100c of the third embodiment of the<br>
