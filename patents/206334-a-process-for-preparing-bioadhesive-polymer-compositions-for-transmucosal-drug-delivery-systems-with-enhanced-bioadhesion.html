The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to process for preparing bioadhesive polymer compositions for transmucosal drug delivery systems with enhanced bioadhesion. This invention further relates to nonpolymeric polyphenols or polyhydroxy excipients for use in bioadhesive polymer compositions for enhanced adhesion.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Modern pharmaceutical formulations may require a number of additives to carryout the complex activities ofa good drug delivery system. Thus, it may be necessary to solubilise a sparingly soluble drug, enhance the permeability of the drug across a biological membrane, have the dosage form adhere to particular site, inhibit the metabolising enzymes etc. Each of these functions is over and above the normal roles of formulation additives. Clearly, addition ofa separate agent for each of these functions would generate a very large dosage form and therefore it has become necessary to generate pharmaceutical excipients with multiple functions.<br>
Certain sites such as GIT and sublingual are very challenging in terms of developing retentive systems. The high mucus turnover rate and strong motility of GIT pose a major challenge in enhancement of residence time ofa dosage form. The sublingual site poses a problem because of large amounts of saliva that collect below the tongue, which may result in excessive hydration and formation of slippery mucilages with minimal or no bioadhesive properties.<br>
A two-phase, water absorbent bioadhesive composition is described in US Patent Application No. US 2003130427. The composition described contains both a hygroscopic phase and a hydrophilic phase. The composition claimed is useful as a bio-adhesive for affixing drug delivery systems.<br><br><br>
US Patent 6583225 describes a polymeric hydrogel of a polymeric anhydride or acid, crosslinked with a crosslinking agent such as polymeric ester or amide / imide, useful in bioadhesive products.<br>
A prolonged release bioadhesive mucosal therapeutic system containing at least one active principle, natural proteins and compression excipients comprising alkali metal alkyl sulphate and a monohydrate sugar is described in US Patent Application No. US 2003108603.<br>
US Patent 6562363 discloses bioadhesive compositions in a flexible, finite form for topical applications to skin or mucous membrane comprising a composition which results from admixture of at least one PVP polymer, at least one bioadhesive and optionally a suitable solvent.<br>
Methods and compositions for enhancing bioadhesive properties of polymers using organic excipients are described in US Patent Application US 2003077317 where incorporating a short chain polymer with one or more free carboxylic groups into the base polymer enhances the adhesive property. The base polymers in the form of microspheres have improved ability to adhere to mucosal membranes.<br>
US Patent Application US 2003065060 claims use of bioadhesive composition comprising a polyphenolic protein from byssus-forming mussels and a polymer comprising carbohydrate groups.<br>
Bioadhesive microsphere drug delivery systems having prolonged gastric retention time due to bioadhesion are described in Patent Application WO03051304.<br>
Polymers such as carbopol and chitosan act as multifunctional polymers with carbopol reported to inhibit the metabolic enzymes and chitosan acting as a permeation enhancer along with their bioadhesive properties. Among the bioadhesive polymers carbopol is reported to be one of the strongest bioadhesive polymer, however it has failed in<br><br><br>
increasing the transit time of a microparticulate system in GIT as revealed by a y-scintigraphic study. Increasing the concentration of a bioadhesive polymer should ideally increase the bioadhesion force of a polymer and therefore provide better retention. However, bioadhesion force is found optimum at a particular concentration beyond which the force decreases with increase in the polymer concentration. Thus, there is a need of a strong bioadhesive polymer or an excipient. which increases the bioadhesion force of existing polymers and performs other functions as well.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to bioadhesive polymer compositions for transmucosal drug delivery systems with enhanced bioadhesion. This invention further relates to nonpolymeric, polyphenoiic or polyhydroxy excipients for use in bioadhesive polymer compositions for enhanced bioadhesion.<br>
A process for making bioadhesive polymer compositions for transmucosal drug delivery systems with enhanced bioadhesion comprising drug; a bioadhesive polymer and at least one nonpolymeric poly phenolic or poly hydroxyl excipient, Detailed Description<br>
Bioadhesion is defined as a state in which two materials at least one of which is biological in nature are held together for an extended period of time by interfacial forces. If the adhesive attachment is to a mucus layer the phenomenon is referred to as mucoadhesion. The process of mucoadhesion involves two main components i.e. the polymers employed in drug delivery system and the mucus layer or mucosal epithelium. Bioadhesion is a reasonably complicated process, which involves physical interaction between two polymer networks (the mucus and the polymer) in an aqueous medium followed by establishment of stabilizing forces in terms of weak chemical bonds. Localisation of a drug delivery system using mucoadhesion can improve bioavailability of a drug, allows modification of tissue permeability, allows targeting of a drug and allows for inhibition of metabolizing enzymes in localized areas. The major component of these bioadhesive delivery systems is a bioadhesive polymer. Many commercially available polymers already known in the literature (e.g., Smart, J. D. et al, J.Pharm. Pharmacol.,  1984,  36:295-99) as being bioadhesive can be used  for this purpose.<br>
4<br><br>
Examples (without limitation) include: group of polymers consisting of cellulosics, starches, cross linked poly vinyl pyrrolidone, polymethacrylates, polyacrylates, xanthan gum, locust bean gum etc.<br>
Despite the good bioadhesive force of existing bioadhesive polymers, there are several sites wherein stronger bioadhesion is required, particularly at aites with high mucin turn over. Therefore there is a need for stronger bioadhesive polymers or a need for increasing the bioadhesive force of existing polymers. It was surprisingly found that polyphcnolic compounds as well as polyhydroxy compounds when used in combination with reported bioadhesive polymers increase the bioadhesion force of the reported polymers synergistically such that the formulation could be administered at sites of high mucus turnover.<br>
A process for making bioadhesive polymer compositions for transmucosal drug delivery systems with enhanced bioadhesion comprising mixinga drug; a bioadhesive polymer and at least one nonpolymeric poly phenolic or poly hydroxyl excipient.<br>
These polyphenols or polyhydroxy compounds act by virtue of their interaction with mucin and formation of secondary chemical bonds/interactions which increases the force require to separate the two surfaces, thus resulting in increased bioadhesion. A number of polyphenols compounds can be employed but of particular interest are a group of compounds known as tannins.<br>
The term tannin was first applied for the substances present in plant extract that were able to combine with protein of animal hides, prevent their putrefaction and convert them into leather. True tannins are the compounds, which give the Goldbeater's skin test positive. Tannins usually have molecular weight ranging from 1000-5000 and many of them are glycosides. Chemically tannins are moderately sized molecules of a substantial number of phenolic groups many of which are associated with O-dihydroxy and O-trihydroxy orientation within a phenyl ring.<br>
Tannins are classified into two classes, hydrolysable tannin and condensed tannin. Hydrolysable tannins are tannins, which may be hydrolysed by acids, or enzymes and they are further classified as galllitannins and ellagitannins. Examples of gallitannins are rhubarb, clove, galls, chestnut etc. and examples of ellagitannins include pomegranate.<br><br><br>
eucalyptus, oak bark etc. Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidines) include all tannins those are not hydrolysable for example cinnamon, tea, cinchona, acacia, catechu etc. Compounds which are of lower molecular weight and do not respond to Goldbeater's skin test even though they are polyphenols are known as pseudotannins which includes coffee tannins.<br>
Selection of nonpolymeric polyphenolic excipients and polyhydroxy excipient for combining with bioadhesive polymer needed to be based on the preferred structural features and other suitable properties of the target excipient. The preferred polyphenolic excipient selected by us for the preferred composition is a member of the tannin or tannic acid family. Non polymeric excipient studied is a polyphenolic compound, more specifically tannic acid or tannin. Preferably the selected tannins were arjuna tannin, tannic acid and catechu tannin.<br>
The non polymeric polyhydroxyl excipient studied is a carbohydrate. The carbohydrates studied are oligosachharides and monosachharides. The preferred carbohydrate is oligosachharides which are lactose, mannitol and sorbitol, more specifically mannitol.<br>
These non-polymeric, polyphenolic or polyhydroxy compounds themselves have no bioadhesive properties, but when combined with other bioadhesive polymers, they synergistically increase the bioadhesion force of these reported bioadhesive polymers. The concentration of these agents depend on a number of factors including: the desired bioadhesion force, the type of non-polymeric, polyphenolic or polyhydroxy excipient. and also on the type and concentration of the bioadhesive polymer employed. In general these agents can be used in the concentrations ranging from 1-95%, preferably in the range of 2-75% and most preferably in the range of 2.5-50%.<br>
The bioadhesive polymer that can be included in the formulation of the invention include polyacrylic  polymers  such  as,  carbomer and  carbomer derivatives  (Polycarbophil, Carbopol etc);    cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). hydroxyethylcellulose      (HEC),      hydroxypropylcellulose      (HPC)      and      sodium<br>
6<br><br>
carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC); natural polymers such as gelatin, sodium alginate, pectin; more generally, any physiologically acceptable polymer showing bioadhesivc characteristics may also be used. Also suitable as the bioadhesives are hydrophilic polysaccharide gums such as natural plant exudates, e.g., karaya gum, ghatti gum and the like, as well as seed gums, e.g., guar gum, locust bean gum, psyllium seed gum and the like. Cross-linked alginate gum gel of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 3,640,741 to Etes is also suitable for use as the mucoadhesive.<br>

The appropriate dosage for the pharmaceutical agents will often be approximately comparable to that of the pharmaceutical agent alone; dosages will be set by the prescribing medical professional considering many factors including age, weight, and condition of the patient, as well as the pharmacokinetics of the specific agent.

9<br><br>
&gt;	Increased  bioadhesive  force  of the polymer  for  sublingual  as  well  as  GIT administration.<br>
&gt;	Allows reduction in the amount of bioadhesive polymer employed for retentive systems.<br>
&gt;	Use lower amounts of polymers with sufficient bioadhesion force which are most suited for immediate release bioadhesive systems.<br>
&gt;	Carryout  multiple  functions   such  as  penetration  enhancement,   inhibition  of enzymes, taste masking etc., and<br>
&gt;	Allows reduction in the cost of the manufacturing.<br>
Example 1: Bioadhesive property of Tannic acid.<br>
Tannic acid was compressed into 8 mm tablets using standard excipients and conventional tableting techniques. The concentration of tannic acid was kept at 10% w/w and the tablets were evaluated for bioadhesive property using guinea pig ileum. Bioadhesion test was carried out using modified Peel Adhesion Tester (Lami Coat Equipments, Thane) Equipment consisted of two clamps designed to hold the test cells (Plate 3). For guinea pig ileum as substrate, the ileum was stuck with the help of an adhesive to the cells without cavity. The tablet was stuck to the surface of the upper cell with the help of an adhesive. Tablet surface was wetted with a 20 ul medium. The test cells were then placed in cell holders and the two surfaces were kept in contact for 2 min. at the force of 400 x 103 dynes. After 2 min the upper test cell holding the tablet was pulled at a speed of 50 mm/min and the detachment force was recorded. The bioadhesion force obtained for these tablets was less than 30 x 103 dynes. These results indicate that tannic acid at concentration of 10 %w/w is not a good bioadhesive. The possible reason for this poor bioadhesive nature of tannic acid may be the lack of polymeric nature because of its low molecular weight.<br>
Example 2: Synergism in bioadhesion force<br>
Tablets of various bioadhesive polymers such as sodium CMC, Hydroxypropyl cellulose E5, Hydroxypropyl cellulose EXF, and Sodium alginate were prepared in 1:1 ratio with<br><br><br><br><br>
tannic acid at the concentration of total 20 % (i.e. 10+10 %). A model drug ketorolac tromethamine (KT) at 10 % w/w concentration was also incorporated in the system containing Sodium alginate and tannic acid.<br>
The results indicate that for all polymers a synergistic effect was obtained (Fig. 1) which means that the bioadhesion force for the combination was greater than the sum of the individual contribution of polymer towards bioadhesion force. Bioadhesion force for tannic acid alone was 28.50 ± 10.64. Taking example of sodium alginate, bioadhesion force for sodium alginate was 120.88 ± 14.06 x 103 dynes at 10 % w/w concentration. When 1:1 tannic acid was added to sodium alginate the bioadhesion force was found to increase to 171.11 ± 18.90 x 103 dynes. A similar result was also obtained with other bioadhesive polymers. A study was also carried out with incorporation of a drug ketorolac tromethamine in polymer combination. Incorporation of drug although resulted in a decrease in bioadhesion force for individual polymers, a synergistic effect was still observed.<br>
As evident from Fig. 2 arjuna tannin and catechu tannin also synergistic ally increased the bioadhesive force of Sodium alginate. These results suggest that the property of increasing the bioadhesion force of polymers resides with a family of compounds having similar structures and the properties.<br>
