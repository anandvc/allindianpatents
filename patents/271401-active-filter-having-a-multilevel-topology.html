				<td>Description<br>
Active filter having a multilevel topology<br>
The invention relates to a device for influencing the<br>
electrical energy transmission of an AC voltage line having a<br>
plurality of phases with phase modules, which each have an AC<br>
voltage terminal for connection to a respective phase of the AC<br>
voltage line and two connecting terminals, wherein a phase<br>
module branch extends between each connecting terminal and each<br>
AC voltage terminal, said phase module branch comprising a<br>
series circuit formed by submodules each having a power<br>
semiconductor circuit and an energy store connected in parallel<br>
with the power semiconductor circuit, and wherein the<br>
connecting terminals are connected to one another.<br>
Such a device is already known from US 6,075,350, which<br>
describes a so-called multilevel converter that is provided for<br>
filtering harmonics of the power supply frequency of an AC<br>
voltage line and for power factor correction. The previously<br>
known converter has a phase module for each phase of the AC<br>
voltage power supply, said phase module having an AC voltage<br>
terminal, by means of which each phase module is connected to a<br>
respective phase of the AC voltage line. In this case, each<br>
phase module has a series circuit comprising submodules<br>
configured as two-terminal networks, wherein each submodule has<br>
a capacitor and, connected in parallel with the capacitor, a<br>
full-bridge circuit comprising power semiconductors. Each of<br>
these turn-off power semiconductors has a freewheeling diode<br>
connected in parallel with it in the opposite sense. Examples<br>
of appropriate turn-off power semiconductors include iGBTs,<br>
GTOs or the like. With the aid of the full-bridge circuit,<br><br><br><br>
given expedient driving of the turn-off power semiconductors,<br>
it is possible to impress the capacitor voltage, a zero voltage<br>
or else the inverted capacitor voltage on the terminals of each<br>
submodule. At their end remote from the AC voltage terminal,<br>
the phase modules are interconnected with one another to form a<br>
star. By turning submodules on and off with the aid of the<br>
power semiconductor circuit, it is possible to approximate a<br>
sinusoidal voltage in stepped fashion. In this case, the full-<br>
bridge circuit permits the greatest possible flexibility in the<br>
circuit. However, the full-bridge circuit necessitates a<br>
multiplicity of power semiconductor modules, whereby the costs<br>
of such a device are increased.<br>
It is an object of the invention, therefore, to provide a<br>
device of the type mentioned in the introduction which is cost-<br>
effective.<br>
The invention achieves this object by virtue of the fact that<br>
the power semiconductor circuit has turn-off power<br>
semiconductors interconnected with one another in a half-<br>
bridge.<br>
The invention provides an active filter having a multilevel<br>
topology. In other words, a phase module is provided for each<br>
phase or alternatively, in the case of an application of the<br>
active filter in a DC voltage intermediate circuit, for each<br>
pole, said phase module comprising a series circuit formed by<br>
submodules. The submodules are bipolar networks and have two<br>
connection terminals. In this case, each submodule has an<br>
energy store, for example a capacitor, with which a power<br>
semiconductor circuit is connected in parallel. Depending on<br>
the driving of the power semiconductors of the power<br>
semiconductor circuit, the voltage dropped across the energy<br>
store can be produced at the connection terminals, or else a<br>
zero voltage. In contrast to the multilevel active filter in<br>
accordance with the prior<br><br><br><br>
art, a half-bridge circuit is provided according to the<br>
invention. Such topologies have previously been disclosed only<br>
in connection with high voltage direct current transmission.<br>
The use of a full-bridge circuit in connection with high<br>
voltage direct current transmission fails since energy cannot<br>
be fed into a DC voltage intermediate circuit on account of a<br>
full-bridge circuit. The invention is based on the concept that<br>
an interconnection of power semiconductors that is only known<br>
from energy transmission can also be used for an active filter.<br>
The suppression of harmonics in an AC voltage power supply or<br>
in a DC voltage intermediate circuit is also possible according<br>
to the invention by means of a half-bridge circuit which, in<br>
contrast to the prior art, cannot generate an inverted energy<br>
store voltage at its connection terminals. The major advantage<br>
of the half-bridge circuit over the full-bridge circuit can be<br>
seen in the costs, since, on account of the half-bridge<br>
circuit, only half as many power semiconductor modules have to<br>
be used in the active filter.<br>
In a first expedient configuration of the half-bridge circuit,<br>
each submodule has a first connection terminal, a second<br>
connection terminal, an energy store and a power semiconductor<br>
branch connected in parallel with the energy store, said power<br>
semiconductor branch having two turn-off power semiconductors<br>
connected in series, wherein a freewheeling diode that is<br>
connected in the opposite sense is connected in parallel with<br>
each turn-off power semiconductor and the junction point of the<br>
emitter of a first turn-off power semiconductor of the power<br>
semiconductor branch and the anode of the freewheeling diode<br>
that is connected in the opposite sense and is assigned to the<br>
first turn-off power semiconductor forms the first connection<br>
terminal and the junction point of the turn-off<br><br>
power semiconductor of the power semiconductor branch and the<br>
freewheeling diodes forms the second connection terminal.<br>
In a configuration that deviates therefrom, each submodule has<br>
a first connection terminal, and a second connection terminal,<br>
wherein the power semiconductor circuit has a power<br>
semiconductor branch connected in parallel with the energy<br>
store, said power semiconductor branch having two turn-off<br>
power semiconductors connected in series, wherein a diode that<br>
is connected in the opposite sense is connected in parallel<br>
with each turn-off power semiconductor and the junction point<br>
of the collector of the first turn-off power semiconductor of<br>
the power semiconductor, branch and the cathode of the<br>
freewheeling diode that is connected in the opposite sense and<br>
is assigned to the first turn-off power semiconductor forms the<br>
first connection terminal and the junction point of the turn-<br>
off power semiconductors of the power semiconductor branch and<br>
the freewheeling diode forms the second connection terminal.<br>
In accordance with one expedient further development of the<br>
invention, a further phase module is provided, which has a<br>
grounding terminal connected to ground potential and two<br>
connecting terminals, wherein a respective phase module branch<br>
extends between each connecting terminal and the grounding<br>
terminal, said phase module branch comprising a series circuit<br>
formed by submodules, wherein each connecting terminal is<br>
connected to the connecting terminal of the remaining phase<br>
modules. In accordance with this advantageous further<br>
development, not only is damping of the negative phase sequence<br>
system provided, rather the grounding also enables the flowing<br>
away of zero phase sequence system currents, thus also enabling<br>
the suppression thereof in the AC voltage line.<br>
In accordance with one preferred configuration of the<br>
invention, a capacitor module having a grounding terminal and<br>
two connecting<br><br><br>
terminals is provided, wherein a respective capacitor branch is<br>
formed between the grounding terminal and each connecting<br>
terminal, said capacitor branch comprising one or a plurality<br>
of capacitors connected in series with one another, wherein<br>
each connecting terminal is connected to a connecting terminal<br>
of the phase module branches. The flowing away of zero phase<br>
sequence system currents is also made possible via the<br>
grounding terminal of the capacitor module. The capacitor<br>
module can thus be equipped with a grounding terminal in<br>
addition to the phase module described further above, or indeed<br>
be provided instead. Both in the case of the grounded phase<br>
module and in the case of the capacitor module, a central<br>
arrangement of the grounding terminal and hence a symmetrical<br>
configuration of the capacitor module is expedient. The phase<br>
module branches of a phase module that respectively extend<br>
between the connecting terminal and the grounding terminal are<br>
therefore identical. The same correspondingly applies to the<br>
series circuit comprising capacitors or to the two capacitors<br>
which are respectively arranged in a branch between grounding<br>
terminal and connecting terminal. On account of this<br>
configuration, too, a high degree of symmetry can be provided<br>
in the transmission.<br>
Further expedient configurations and advantages of the<br>
invention are the subject matter of the following description<br>
of exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the<br>
figures of the drawing, wherein identical reference symbols<br>
refer to identically acting component parts and wherein<br>
figure 1 shows an exemplary embodiment of the device according<br>
to the invention in an equivalent circuit<br>
illustration,<br>
figure 2 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention, and<br><br>
figure 3 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an exemplary embodiment of the device 1<br>
according to the invention, this device being connected to an<br>
AC voltage line 2 with the phases 2a, 2b and 2c. In this case,<br>
the AC voltage line 2 extends between a supply system 3 that<br>
feeds electrical energy and a load 4 that loads the supply<br>
system 3 or the AC voltage line 2 asymmetrically, and at the<br>
same time harmonics of the nominal frequency of the AC voltage<br>
of the AC voltage line 2 are produced here. The device 1 is<br>
provided for compensating for the asymmetries and, in<br>
particular, for suppressing said harmonics.<br>
The device 1 illustrated in figure 1 comprises three phase<br>
modules 5a, 5b and 5c, which each have an AC voltage terminal<br>
6a, 6b and 6c, which are respectively connected to a phase 2a,<br>
2b and 2c of the AC voltage line 2. Furthermore, each phase<br>
module 5a, 5b and 5c in each case has two connecting terminals<br>
7p and 7n, wherein a respective phase module branch 8ap, 8bp,<br>
8cp, 8an, 8bn and 8cn extends between each AC voltage terminal<br>
6a, 6b and 6c and each of the connecting terminals 7p and 7n,<br>
respectively. Each of these six phase module branches comprises<br>
a series circuit formed by submodules 9.<br>
The submodules 9 are configured as two-terminal networks and<br>
have a first connection terminal 10 and a second connection<br>
terminal 11. Furthermore, each submodule 9 has a power<br>
semiconductor branch 12 having two turn-off power<br>
semiconductors 13, such as IGBTs, for example, connected in<br>
series with one another. Each turn-off power semiconductor<br><br>
13	has a freewheeling diode 14 connected in parallel with it in<br>
the opposite sense. The power semiconductor branch 12 is<br>
connected in parallel with a capacitor 15 as energy store. The<br>
emitter of the turn-off power semiconductor 13 illustrated at<br>
the bottom in figure 1 and the anode of the freewheeling diode<br>
14	connected in parallel with said turn-off power semiconductor<br>
13 are at the potential of the first connection terminal 10 of<br>
the submodule. The second connection terminal is at the<br>
potential of the junction points between the two turn-off power<br>
semiconductors 13 and thus at the potential of the junction<br>
point between the two freewheeling diodes 14 connected in<br>
series.<br>
Depending on the driving of the turn-off power semiconductors<br>
13, either the capacitor voltage or a zero voltage is dropped<br>
across the connection terminals 10 and 11. However, this can<br>
also be achieved with some other interconnection of the stated<br>
components as mentioned further above.<br>
The capacitors 15 of each submodule 9 are charged by means of<br>
an expedient driving (not shown in figure 1) of the turn-off<br>
power semiconductors. However, the control and regulating unit<br>
furthermore also comprises a procedure by which harmonics of<br>
the alternating current flowing in the AC voltage line are<br>
identified. Said harmonics have a frequency that is an integer<br>
multiple of the nominal frequency of the voltage in the AC<br>
voltage line. Through expedient driving of the turn-off power<br>
semiconductors 13, on account of the charged capacitors 9 a<br>
voltage is generated which drives a compensation current or<br>
filter current, which is coupled into the AC voltage line 2 and<br>
ensures that the harmonics and also asymmetries<br><br>
of the current in the AC voltage line 2 are suppressed.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further example of the device 1 according to<br>
the invention with the phase modules 5a, 5b and 5c each having<br>
two phase module branches 8ap, 8an, 8bp, 8bn, 8cp and 8cn,<br>
respectively. In order to allow zero phase sequence system<br>
currents to flow away, a further phase module 5d is provided,<br>
which again has two connecting terminals 7p and 7n, which are<br>
connected to the connecting terminals 7p and 7n, respectively,<br>
of the phase modules 5a, 5b and 5c by means of a connecting<br>
line. In contrast to the phase modules 5a, 5b and 5c, however,<br>
the phase module 5d does not have an AC voltage terminal, but<br>
rather a grounding terminal 16, via which zero phase sequence<br>
system currents can flow away given expedient driving of the<br>
turn-off power semiconductors of the submodules 9 of the phase<br>
module branches 8dp and 8dn. Suppression of asymmetries on<br>
account of zero phase sequence system currents is thus also<br>
made possible in accordance with this advantageous<br>
configuration of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the invention,<br>
wherein, however, the connecting terminals 7p and 7n of the<br>
phase modules 5a, 5b and 5c are connected to the connecting<br>
terminals 7p and 7n, respectively, of a capacitor module 17.<br>
The capacitor module 17 has a grounding terminal 16, wherein a<br>
respective capacitor 18 is connected between the grounding<br>
terminal 16 and each connecting terminal 7p and 7n,<br>
respectively. It goes without saying that a plurality of<br>
capacitors 18 connected in series can also be provided between<br>
the grounding terminal 16 and each connecting terminal 7p and<br>
7n, respectively, of the capacitor module 17. A flowing away of<br>
the zero phase sequence system currents is once again made<br>
possible via the grounding terminal 16.<br><br>
Furthermore, the coupling of a capacitive reactive power into<br>
the AC voltage line 2 is made possible by expedient driving of<br>
the turn-off power semiconductors of the phase modules 5a, 5b<br>
and 5c. Consequently, power factor correction is also provided<br>
by this further development of the device 1 according to the<br>
invention. It goes without saying that a centrally grounded<br>
phase module, which is designated by 5d in figure 2, can also<br>
be used together with a capacitor module 16 and also the three<br>
phase modules 5a, 5b and 5c in the context of the invention,<br>
wherein the connecting terminals 7p and 7n, respectively, are<br>
put at a common potential by means of a connecting line.<br><br>
