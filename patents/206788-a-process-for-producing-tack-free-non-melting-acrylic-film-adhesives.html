This invention relates to a process for producing tack-free  non-melting acrylic film adhesives,  Non-melting thin  films are useful as thermosetting film adhesives for bonding a  variety of substrates including polyimide films.<br>
Film  adhesives  have great  application  potential  in high-tech  areas  like  aerospace.   Bonding  is  the   technique employed  in  the  manufacture  of  several  critical   structure components   for  aerospace  applications.   Notable   components include,   honeycomb structures, antennas, solar sail  and  solar panel  for satellites.  Solar sail is made by  bonding  polyimide film  segments.   A polyimide suitable for such  applications  is marketed  by  DuPont  in  the trade  name  KAPTON.   The  bonding requirements in majority of these areas ar	e  generally met by  use of  glue-1ike  and solvent-based  resinous  polymeric  adhesives. There is an increased preference for dry film adhesives for  such applications.    This  is  because  use  of  film  adhesive   can faci1itate  bonding  manoeuvre, avoid use of  solvents  and  help regulate the flue line thickness and minimise wastage of adhesive and  accumulation  of dead weight which are  very  critical  when weight saving becomes a matter of concern.  A few  film adhesives for  structural and general purpose applications are        known  and the  majority  of them are based on high molecular  weight  epoxy resin  and some on acrylic copolymers and  vinyl  acetal-phenolic systems.   Thermosetting  epoxy film adhesives  require  blending with  other  polymeric  additives  such as rubber, nylon etc. for<br><br>
deriving  film-farming   characteristics which  makes  the  process complex and at times lead  to problems of phase separation of the various components of the film.  Those based on polyvinyl acetai-phenolic  also have the short-comings of a  two-component  system and are     associated  with condensation cure  reaction  which  is accompanied   by  evolution  of  volatiles  during  cure.    This necessitates  application  of  pressure  during  bonding  to  get defect—free bonds.  Thus, E Lavins and J A Snelgrove describe  in the  Hand  Book  of Adhesives  (Editor,  Skiest;  Publisher, Van Nostrand and Reinold, 1977) and L T Eby and H P Brown describe in Treatise   on  Adhesion And     Adhesives  (Editor  R  L   Patrick, publisher, Marcel Dekker, 1966) vinyl acetal-phenolic  structural adhesives  in  which  polyvinyl acetal  serves  as  co-reactant, flexibi1ising agent and flow control component.<br>
In  this  heterogeneous  system,  adhesive   properties<br>
depend  on  the particle size of resole  dispersed  in  polyvinyl<br>
acetal.   Conventional acrylic film adhesives make  use of  vinyl<br>
polymerisation  for  crosslinking•  Such cure  reactions  proceed<br>
with   great   difficulty  and  are  incomplete   under   aerobic<br>
environments due to interference of atmospheric oxygen acting  as<br>
polymerisation  inhibitor-  The poor shelf-life of the  resultant<br>
films  is  also  of  concern -  In  many  applications,  the  film<br>
adhesives  is required to be non-tacky under ambient  conditions,<br>
non-melting and non-flowing while heating and curing as otherwise<br>
melt-flow  of  the ahesive can cause many problems  arising  from<br><br>
the spreading of adhesives to unwanted areas of the adherends. Majority of the above mentioned systems do not possess these qualities, whereas the present invention possesses them.<br>
The main objective of the present invention relates to a process for production of a non-tacky, non-melting film adhesive suitable for the above referred applications using a combination of acrylic polymerisation and epoxy curing.<br>
The  synthesised acrylic copolymer is blended with  the fillers  and  curatives  and  cast in  to  tack-free,  thin  film adhesive for qse in bonding.  The adhesives are selected so as to induce  partial  cure of the film at ambient  conditions  (or  B-staging) and to render it non-tacky.  The film does not show  any melt-flow characteristics like many reported film adhesives.  The film adhesive of the present invention can be used as a thermoset adhesive  with  good lap shear strength and peel strength  for  a variety  of  substrates including polyimide film.  In  the  first step, a pendant epoxy-functional polymer is made by free  radical copolymerization  of  a  mixture of three  vinyl  monomers  in  a solvent.   One  such monomer is an alkeny1 cyanide  monomer  like acrylonitrile  or methacrylonitrile.  The second monomer  of  the mixture  is an alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylie  acid  where the  alkyl  part can be constituted by one among  methyl,  ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, or ethyl hexyl group an^ preferably  butyl group.  The third component of the  mixture  is constituted  by glyeidyl ester of an   unsaturated acid.   Glyeidyl<br><br>
acrylate or glycidyl methacrylate are examples.  The free radical initiator   used can     be  any  azo  initiator,  example   azobis isobutyronitrile  or  azobiscyanocycloheaxane or it  can  be  any peroxide  initiator such as benzoyl peroxide or ditertiary  butyl peroxide.   The  polymerisation  is done in  an  organic  solvent selected among tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, methylethy1 ketone (MEK),  methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), dimethyl formamide  (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) , N-methy 1 pyrrol idone (MNP)   or dimethyl sulfoxide  (DliSO)  or a mixture of two or more of  any  of  these solvents  in any proportion.  The preferred solvent is DMF.   The polymerisation is performed at temperatures between 6O-80°C.  The reaction is carried out for 5-10 hours and the resultant  polymer is isolated by pouring the resinous solution to any non  solvent. The  nonsolvent can be chosen  from among hydrocarbons,  such  as hexane,  heptane, octane, cyclohexane or  their mixtures  in  any combination  and  proportion.   The nonsolvents can  also  be  an alcohols  such as ethanol, methanol, propanol, ispropanol, or   a mixtures  of  these  in any combination  and  proportion  in  the presence  or  absence  of added water.    The  preferred  one  is methanol.<br>
In such systems, the alkyl acrylate or methacrylate imparts the required flexibility whereas the polar nitrile component contributes to enhanced wetting, adhesion and cohesive strength of the polymers. The epoxy groups incorporated through suitable monomer serves as the functional group for curing of the film adhesive.  The polymer is blended with a filler,  preferably<br><br>
silica  powder  of particle  size below 10 micron,  an  aliphatic diamine     for curing part of the epoxy groups at room  temperature and an aromatic diamine to  induce curing of the remaining  epoxy groups   at  higher  temperature.   The  part  curing   at   room temperature by the aliphatic amine prevents the melt-flow of  the resin on heating«  The aliphatic diamine can be chosen from among piperazine  or  substituted  piperazine or  N,N'  dialkyl  alkane diamine where the alkane moiety can range from ethane to dodecane and  the alkyl part from methyl to hexyl•  The preferred  diamine compound  is 'piperAzine'      The aromatic diamine is  chosen  among 3,3'- diamino  diphenyl sulfone, 4,4-'diamino  diphenyl  sulfone, 3,3 -diamino  diphenyl ketone, 4,4'-diamino diphenyl ketone or  a mixture  of  these in any proportion, pr&amp;f&amp;renc&amp;  being  given  to 4,4'- diamino diphenyl sulfone.<br>
In such a copolymer formulation, the alkyl aerylate part can vary from 55-65X by weight, the nitrile monomer can vary between 20-35X by weight and the epoxy monomer-content is varied such that the polymer has an epoxy functionality in the range 0.15-0.3 equivalents/kg. The free radical initiator is taken at a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 percent by weight of the total monomer. The si 1ica fi1ler in the polymer formulation is varied in the range 10-20% by weight of the polymer. The aliphatic and aromatic diamines are added such that each accounts for 50X of the epoxy groups on an equivalent basis.   In<br><br>
this calculation, the aliphatic diamine and aromatic diamine are both considered to possess two functional groups each for reaction with epoxy groups of the polymer on a 1:1 equivalent basis.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for producing tack-free non-melting acrylic adhesives comprising the steps of blending an acrylic copolymer with pendant epoxy groups obtained by copolymerising a mixture of an alky 1 aerylate, an alkenyl cyanide and a glyeidyl ester of an unsaturated organic acid with a mixture of an aliphatic diamine and an aromatic diamine to produce said adhesive and if desired adding known fillers such as silica powder in a solvent medium and casting said composition as a film on a support-<br>
The  following  examples  illustrate  the  details   of synthesis  of  the  copolymer and  the  fomulated  film  adhesive derived from it. Example 1, Synthesis of epoxy-functional acrylic polymer (EFAP)<br>
A mixture containing 39 parts of butyl aerylate, 21 parts of acrylonitrile, 1 part of glyeidyl methacrylate and 39 parts of freshly disti1 led dimethyl formamide containing 0.1%.(with respect to the three monomers) of azo-bis-iso-butyronitrile, all taken in a 500 ml round bottomed flask fitted with a vacuum adaptor. The solution is cooled to -50°C or preferably -70°C and evacuated using a vacuum pump and then closed  under vaccum.  The solution is then kept in a water  bath<br><br>
heated  to 70°C and maintained at this temperature for  6  hours-The  viscous solution is then  poured drop-wise to 10  times  its volume  of methyl alcohol under agitation.  The resinous  polymer formed  is  separated by decanting the supernatant  liquid.   The precipitate  is then dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF)  to  make approximately    10X    (weight/weight)   solution    and    then reprecipitated into methanol as described above.  The polymer  is then  dried  at 40 to 60°C under vacuum for 3 to  7  hours.   The polymer  is formed in 80-90% yield•  It is characterised  by  Gel Permeation  Chromatography (GPC) to determine the number  average molecular  weight (Mn) which is in the range 45000-55000  with  a poly  dispersity of 1.7 to 2.0.  The IR spectrum of  the  polymer shows  an  absorption at 1740 cm"  characteristic  of  the  ester carbonyl  groups and a strong absorption at 2150 cm"  due to  the nitrile  group derived from acrylonitrile.  The weak peak at  910 cm"  is indicative of the epoxy groups.<br>
Example 2, Preparation of film adhesive<br>
100 parts of the above dried polymer (EFAP) is dissolved in 280 parts of methyl ethyl ketone and is then mixed with 10-20 parts of fine silica filler. The mixture is transferred to a jar mill and mixed for 10-20 hours. The viscous fine dispersion is diluted with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) containing equimolar mixture of piperazine and 4,4'-diamine diphenyl sulfone together equivalent to the epoxy-content of the polymer,  so  as  to form a 10% (weight/weigh t)  solution.   For<br><br>
calculating  the  composition  of  the  polymer  and the        epoxy equivalent,  the  formed  polymer is supposed to  have  the  same composition as the feed of three monomers which is correct  since the conversion is near quantitative.  The solution is then poured in to a rectangular metallic mould containing polypropylene IPP) sheet  of around 200 micron thickness fixed on its  bottom.   The solvent is allowed to evaporate at room temperature for 24 hours. The quantity of solution poured in to the mould is regulated such that  the final film has a thickness of 50-100 micron.  The  film with the PP   sheet support is taken out and can be served directly as  adhesive  after releasing the back-up PP sheet.  It  is  non-tacky  and  it  doesn't  melt on heating  but  only  softens  and consolidates.<br>
Example 3, Application of film  adhesive for bonding<br>
The  following  procedure  is  typical  for  evaluation   of adhesive  properties  of  the film adhesive of  example  2  using polyimide  film.  Thus, adhesive properties. Lap  Shear  Strength (LSS)  and T-peel strength (TPS ) are   determined with  aluminised KAPTON  film (procured from M/s. Dupont, USA) as per ASTM- D 1002 and  ASTM-D 872 methods respectively.  The film adhesive  is  cut and  interposed  between the polyimide adherends which are     then bonded  by  heating them in an air  oven to preferably  180°C  and optionally  150°C for half an hour. A contact pressure of  SO-100 psi  and optionally 50 psi is applied while curing.   The  bonded specimens are tested in an IBSTRON UTM as per ASTM procedures for lap shear strength (LSS)_ and T-peel strength (TPS).<br><br>
Table 1 gives the typical characteristics of the polymer obtained from the above exmaple 1.<br>
Table 2 gives typical characteristics of the formulated resin described in example 2 for use in the production of film adhesive as described in the same example.<br>
Table 3 gives typical lap shear strength and T-peel strength of the film adhesive using aluminised KAPTON polyimide film as adherend as described in example 3 under different test conditions.<br>
Scheme  1  depicts  the synthesis  and  curing  of  the<br>
polymer adhesives as described in examples 1 and 3 respectively.<br>
» The  film adhesive disclosed here is advantageous  over<br>
the conventional ones in the following respects.<br>
1.	It is easily synthesised;<br>
2.	The formulated resin can be easily cast into film;<br>
3.	The film is partly B-staged, non tacky at ambient<br>
conditions and it does not flow while curing at<br>
high temperature;<br>
4.	No volatile by-products are generated on curing,<br>
thus eliminating the possibility for generation<br>
of microvoids between adherends;<br>
5. The film adhesive can be potentially served for other substrates as well. This includes the following adherends such as metals, rubbers, plastics and wood in any combination.<br><br>
