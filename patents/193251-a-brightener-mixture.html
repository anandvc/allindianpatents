with the proviso that the stated weight percentages are each based on the total weight of the bisstyryl compounds of the formulae I to V, the percentages of the bisstyryl compounds of the formulae I to V adding up to 100% by weight, and the brightener mixtures comprising from 75 to 100% by weight, based on the weight of the brightener mixture, of the bisstyryl compounds of the formulae I to V, formulations comprising the novel mixtures, and their use for optically brightening synthetic or natural polymer materials.<br>
GB-A-2 200 660, EP-A-238 446, EP-A-321 393, DE-A-4 219 772 and PCT/EP 94/02914 already disclose mixtures of optical brighteners based on bisstyryl compounds.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide novel brightener mixtures based on bisstyryl compounds which shall be simple  to obtain and have advantageous application properties, in particular a high degree of whiteness.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the brightener mixtures more particularly described at the beginning.<br>
The novel brightener mixtures, in each case based on the weight of the mixture, comprise from 75 to 100% by weight, preferably 80 to 100% by weight, in particular from 85 to 100% by weight, of the bisstyryl compounds of the formulae I to V.<br>
of particular industrial interest are brightener mixtures comprising, based on the weight of the mixture, from 85 to 90% by weight of the bisstyryl compounds of the formulae I to V.<br>
As remainder the brightener mixtures of the present invention may typically additionally contain for example the compound of the formula VI<br><br><br>
and salts.<br>
The brightener mixtures of the present invention preferably comprise, based on the total weight of bisstyryl compounds I to V, from 30 to 45% by weight of the bisstyryl compound of the formula I, from 40 to 50% by weight of the bisstyryl compound of the formula II and from 0.5 to 5% by weight, in  particular from 1 to 3.5% by weight, of the bisstyryl compound of the formula III, and additionally from 1 to 15% by weight, in particular from 5 to 15% by weight, of bisstyryl compound of the formula IV and/or from 1 to 15% by weight, in particular from 5 to 15% by weight, of the bisstytyl compound of the formula V.<br>
The novel brightener mixtures can be prepared for example by mixing the individual components in the appropriate weight ratio. The individual components can be obtained in a conventional manner, for example by reacting terephthalaldehyde with alkyl cyanophosphonates in a basic medium in an inert organic diluent.<br>
The present invention further provides brightener formulations comprising water and, in each case based on the weight of the formulation, from 3 to 25% by weight, preferably from 5 to 15% by weight, of the above-defined brightener mixture and also from 5 to 60% by weight, preferably from 5 to 52% by weight, of auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable auxiliaries include for example anionic or nonionic dispersants from the class of the ethylene oxide adducts with fatty alcohols, higher fatty acids or alkylphenols or ethylenediamine-ethylene oxide-propylene oxide adducts, or dispersants as described in DE-A-2 745 449, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone with 3-vinylpropionic acid, water retention aids, such as ethylene glycol, glycerol or sorbitol, or biocides.<br>
A preferred brightener formulation, in addition to water, contains, in each case based on the weight of the formulation, from 3 to 25% by weight, preferably from 5 to 15% by weight, of the above-defined brightener mixture, from 3 to 12% by weight of anionic or nonionic dispersant. from 1 to 15% by weight of copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone with 3-vinylpropionic acid and from 1 to 25% by weight of further auxiliaries (eg. water retention aids or biocides).<br>
The br-ightener mixtures of the present invention are advantageously useful for optically brightening synthetic or natural polymer materials, preferably polyester. The polyesters are present in textile form. This is to be understood as meaning<br><br>
in particular as fibers, yarns, threads, knits, wovens or ponwovens. The novel brightener mixtures combine a low fixing or exhaust temperature with advantageous application properties, rhey are also high yielding. A further advantage of the novel prightener mixtures is that they can be successfully used at elevated temperatures, in particular at from 200 to 220'c.<br>
The Examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br>
Preparation of brightener mixture<br>
a)  To a mixture in 1100 ml of N,N-diinethylformamide of 201 g<br>

This was followed by stirring at 30'C for 1 h and thereafter the addition of 434.9 g (1.54 mol) of diethyl 4-cyanobenzylphosphonate, followed by a further 279.8 g (1.54 mol) of 30% by weight methanolic sodium methoxide solution. After the reaction solution had subsequently been stirred at 30*C for 1 h, it was cooled down to 25'c, and the resulting precipitate was filtered off with suction, washed three times with 500 ml of methanol each time and once with 1650 ml of water and dried to leave 337 g of a solid (hereinafter referred to as component 2) containing 279 g of the compound of the formula<br><br><br>
  To a mixture in 1100 ml of N,N-dimet:hylformamide of 201 g (1.47 mol) of terephthalaldehyde (98.45% by weight pure) and 831 g (3.09 mol) of diethyl 2-cyanobenzylphosphonate (94% by weight pure) were added over 3 h at 30'c 559.6 g (3.O8 mol) of 30% by weight methanolic sodium methoxide solution. This was followed by stirring at 30*C for 2 h.
