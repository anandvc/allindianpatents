				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an inline permanent magnetic filter for<br>
removal  of  weakly  magnetic  impurities  from  slurry  such  as<br>
ilmenite, iron oxide and similar substances from wet slurries.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It  is  very common to use normal permanent magnet  based  traps.<br>
Alnico  magnet elements are used for such permanent magnet  based<br>
traps.<br>
The low intensity separators are also being used for a very  long<br>
time in many process industries.<br>
Electro magnetic high intensity separators are used when reliable<br>
and high efficiency is to be ensured.<br>
With  the advent of raw earth permanent magnets, the  application<br>
range of low intensity magnetic filters has dramatically improved. It has become an economic alternative in medium<br>
intensity range. The advantages of such permanent magnet based systems are that it does not require any maintenance and has no operating cost component. The system is also flexible so that it can be designed for wide range of flow conditions.<br>
However, there are 'several disadvantages associated with the present system of permanent magnet traps using Alnico magnet elements is that the trapping efficiency is limited due to the basic magnetic strength of 4000 gaus.<br>
The disadvantages associated with low intensity separator used in process industries is that their efficiency is very low. Further disadvantages with the present system of electro-magnetic high intensity separators is that they are very costly.<br>
Finally, the disadvantages associated with the present system of low intensity rare earth permanent magnet separators and all other existing system is that their utility is restricted to only ferrous impurities and not useful for weakly magnetic materials.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a simple and effective means of removal of weakly magnetic impurities from wet slurries.<br>
Another objective is to extend the range of applicability of permanent magnet filters from removal of ferrous impurities to weakly magnetic impurities.<br>
Yet  another  objective  is  to  take  advantage  of  economically flexible design over wide range of flow conditions. This ensures that  number of systems can be installed in many flow lines instead of single bulky electro magnet high intensity separator.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to eliminate the high cost bulky electromagnets.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an in line permanent magnetic filter - for removal of weakly magnetic impurities from slurry comprising a non-magnetic stainless steel housing with inlet and outlet pipes with flanges and 3-way valves said housing is provided with a top plate to which plurality of brass tube  are fixed and said brass tubes are packed with filter matrix and forms a well for sliding and location of permanent magnetic elements which are fixed to a moving lid the 'said lid is actuated by an actuator.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing  in  the  same, will  be  apparent  from  the  following<br>
description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1 :  Sectional view of the arrangement of<br>
the permanent magnet filter; Figure 2 :  View of the magnet element arrangement.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The system consists of a non-magnetic housing SS 304 (1) with inlet and outlet pipes with flanges (2). This is for easy installation in a liquid flow line. Three way valve (5) is interfaced at the inlet and outlet ends for diverting the flow of slurry and water during filtration and flush cycle. The housing has a top plate (3) to which brass tubes (6) are fixed. These tubes are specifically arranged so as to ensure proper and uniform distribution of slurry around these wells. This will facilitate effective interaction of magnetic impurities with the magnet elements. These tubes form a well for sliding and location of permanent magnetic elements (A) which are fixed to a moving plate (7). The magnetic elements (4) are high strength rare earth magnets specifically arranged for effective magnetic interaction with slurry flow and to provide background field to the matrix as well as magnetize ferrous impurities in slurry. The magnetic elements are provided with a brass sleeve for protection and cleaning. The moving plate is for withdrawing the magnetic elements from the well so that the filter region is free from magnetic field during flush cycle. This is facilitated by guide bars and has a fixed stroke length which is in excess of magnetic element length. This ensures complete removal of magnetic element from the filter volume and hence absence of background magnetic field for the filter matrix (8) packed inside the filter volume. The matrix is SS430 steel wool of 40 um diameter and it is loosely packed to a density of 1-2% for providing localized field gradients which enable the weakly magnetic material to get polarized and cling to the matrix<br>
In the presence of permanent magnets(4), the steel wool of the filter matrix (8) gets magnetized and a field gradient is established in the gap between wool surfaces. When paramagnetic impurities pass through these gaps, they experience a magnetic polarization and cling to steel wool of the filter matrix (8) surface and hence trapping. On withdrawing the magnet element (4) full above the top plate (7), the wool looses back ground magnetic field and hence looses magnetism. Hence the field gradient in the gap is lost. The paramagnetic impurities are no longer held to the wool surface of the filter matrix (8) and hence easily flushed out. The permanent magnet filter device can easily be installed and operate unattended with low cost programmable logic controllers for sequentially operating slurry and water flow valves and actuators.<br>
The dimensions of the system developed for	illustration is as<br>
follows<br>
Housing  SS 304,130 mm outer diameter, 160 mm	long<br>
Brass well : 28 mm ID, 0.7 mm wall thickness,	134 mm long<br>
5 nos distributed at 75 mm pcd	as shown in Figure<br>
Inlet/outlet pipes     2"<br>
Valve : 3 way SS Ball valve for slurry/water flow<br>
Magnet element:  25 mm dia,Nd Fe B magnets housed in a brass<br>
sleeve, 5 Nos<br>
Actuator: Stroke length : 150 mm Filter matrix  : 2% packing, SS 430 steel wool.<br>
The separation performance of the system is illustrated by the<br>
typical result as given below.<br>
Typical Experimental trials :<br>
Test sample: Calcite ore sample with CaCO3 - 83% and traces<br>
of iron impurities, Fe 1.14%<br>
Test procedure:Calcite sample with an average particle size of 75 was prepared in the form of 10% slurry. This was pumped through the permanent magnetic filter using a peristaltic pump. The flow rate was maintained at 3.5 Ipm. The feed cycle was fixed at 10 minutes. This was followed by a rinse cycle with water at a flow rate of 3 Ipm for 10 minutes.Then the top plate<br>
with "magnet elements was with drawn from the filter housing to ensure no magnetic field present in the processing area. This was followed by a wash cycle with high pressure water where by the trapped magnetic materials were removed. The table shows the impurity levels of calcite before and after filtration.<br>
TABLE 1  (Table Removed)<br>
The iron oxide level could be substantially removed from 1.14% to 0.61% indicating that the present invention is capable of removing paramagnetic impurities.<br>
The foregoing description shows that the present invention is a simple and highly efficient method of removing paramagnetic impurities at medium intensity range. This allows for adaptation in automated mode by incorporating pneumatic actuator for the movement of magnet elements in and out of the well and solenoid valves for controlling the flow of slurryand water and the entire cycle sequentially operated using low cost programable controllers.<br>
