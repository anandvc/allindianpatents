				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   an   apparatus   and   a   method   of distributing video data from a distribution end.<br>
1.        Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a video distribution playback method by which a distributor on the distribution end of the operation duplicates a video product, such as a movie, distributes the duplicate to theaters on the playback end of the operation, and the thus-distributed video product is played back at the theaters. The present invention also relates to an apparatus to be disposed on a video distribution end, an apparatus to be disposed on a video playback end, and a recording medium (such as a computer readable medium), which are to be employed for implementing the method.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2000-059358 and 2000-224390, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
2.        Description of the Related Art<br>
Fig. 19 shows the overall configuration of a related -art motion picture distribution/screening system.<br><br>
As shown in the drawing, a motion-picture distributor on the distribution end receives a master film of a motion picture produced by a moviemaker. Thr? thus-received master film is then duplicated, as distribution films, equal in number to movie-theaters, which are owned by business partners of the distributor, in which the movie is to be screened (more correctly, equal in the number of screens on which the motion picture is to be screened). The distribution films are distributed to the respective movie theaters. Movie theaters on the playback end play back the thus-distributed distribution films using equipment such as motion-picture projectors. Here, the term "film" signifies a 35mm optical film (hereinafter simply called a "35mm film").<br>
Production of a distribution film to be used in the foregoing related-art motion picture distribution/screening system costs 220,000 yen (about US$2,000)/film or thereabouts. For instance, distribution of a single movie to 500 screens costs 110,000,000 yen (about US $1,000,000) or thereabouts. For instance, a movie theater that numbers 100 seats and operates in compliance with the related-art system incurs spending of about 11,000,000 yen (about US $100,000) for equipment costs. Thus, the related-art system imposes a considerably heavy harden on the motion-picture<br><br>
distributor and the movie theaters. This problem remains unavoidable so long as a 35mm film is used for distributing and screening a movie.<br>
A motion picture distribution/screening system —which uses digital media for producing a movie in place of a 35mm film—has recently been proposed. The system of this type has been put forward for the purpose of completely substituting digital media for a 35mm film. This system can provide far better screening quality than that yielded by the related-art system. However, ensuring high screening quality involves custom-designed facilities. Thus, a significant curtailment of costs required for distributing a film or costs incurred by facilities of a movie theater is impossible. For this reason, the system of this type has not yet become pervasive.<br>
If general-purpose facilities are used for a motion picture distribution-and-screening system using digital media, significant cost reductions can be expected. However, since general-purpose facilities are used, the chance of third parties being able to realize unauthorized duplication or appreciation of a film becomes higher. Prevention of unauthorized use of a film is indispensable for distributing and screening a film produced at the expense of enormous amounts of money. Particularly, when a movie is distributed and<br><br>
screened as digital data that can be duplicated without involvement of physical deterioration, a need exists for reliably preventing unauthorized use of a fi1m.<br>

In the following descriptions, a theater is denoted by 13 unless any one of the theaters 13-1, 13-2, ... is specified. The same applies to the other reference numerals . In the present embodiment, there is often employed a case where the distribution DVD-ROM 15 is comprised of three DVD-ROMs. However, the number of DVD-ROMs 15<br><br>
differs  from one movie to  another and is  not limited to the number 3.<br>
A-2: Configuration of Apparatus to be Disposed on the Distribution End<br>
The configuration of an apparatus 20 to be disposed on the part of the motion-picture distributor 12 will now be described with reference to Figs. 2 through 4.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the apparatus 20. As illustrated, the apparatus 20 comprises a film reader 21 and a computer system 22. The film reader 21 reads the master film 14 on a per-scene basis (i.e., a per-unit-video basis),, and for each scene outputs an analog video signal (24 frames/sec.) according to the master film 14. Through use of the video signal output from the film reader 21, the computer system 22 produces the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ....<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing the confiquration of the computer system 22. As illustrated, the computer system 22 comprises: a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 30 which performs various types of computations and controls individual sections; PAM (Random Access Memory) 31 to be used as work memory; ROM 32 which stores a cluster of programs to be read and executed by the CPU 30; a hard disk drive 33 which stores a cluster<br><br>
of programs to be read and executed by the CPU 30, such as an operating system and application programs; a display 34, such as a CRT (cathode ray tube), which displays an image to the user; a display interface 35 for displaying, on the display 34, an image corresponding to the data supplied from the CPU 30; an operation section 36, such as a keyboard or a mouse, by way of which the user enters an instruction; an operation-section interface 37 which supplies to the CPU 30 data representing the instruction entered by way of the operation section 36; a video-signal input interface 38 which digitizes a video signal output from the film reader 21 and supplies the thus-digitized video signal to the CPU 30;. and a DVD-ROM writer 39 which is controlled by the CPU 30 and writes the data onto a DVD-ROM loaded therein. The hard disk unit 33 is read and written by the CPU 30 and is used for storing various types of video data sets .<br>
As a result of turning on the power (unillustrated), or in accordance with the user instruction entered by way of the operation section 36, the CPU 30 executes a cluster of programs stored in the ROM 32 and the hard disk drive 33, thereby performing processing for producing DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, .... The function of the computer<br><br>
system  22  will  be  described  with  particular attention to the processing.<br>
Fig. 4 is a conceptual rendering showing processes of producing the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... in the computer system 22. As illustrated, the video signal input interface 38 of the computer system 22 produces serial video data 41 by means of digitizing an analog video signal output from the film reader 21. The thus-produced video signal is supplied to the CPU 30. The serial video data 41 is comprised of scene data sets 42-1, 42-2, ... which are video data pertaining to respective scenes in a movie and are arranged in the sequence of playback. The serial video data 41 comply with the DVD-Video standards (60 frames/sec.).<br>
The CPU 30 stores, in the hard disk drive 33, the serial video data 41 supplied from the video signal input interface 38, thereby producing non-serial video data 44 in which the scene data sets 42-1, 42-2, ... are randomly distributed to units 43-<br>
1,	43-2, ....   In this case, the CPU 30 assigns<br>
serial numbers to the respective units 43 (e.g., 1,<br>
2,	...  to  identify  the  units  43-1,  43-2,  ...).<br>
Further, the CPU 30 encrypts the non-serial video<br>
data 44 for each scene data set 42 by way of a<br>
contents scramble system (CSS) specified by the<br>
DVD-Video standards, thereby producing encrypted<br><br>
non-serial video data 45 comprised of encrypted scene data sets 46-1, 46-2, ....<br>
The CPU 30 displays, on the display 34 and by way of the display interface 35, an image for prompting insertion of a first DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM writer 39. When an appropriate DVD-ROK is inserted into the DVD-ROM writer 39, a plurality of units randomly extracted from all the units 43-1, 43-2, ... are written into the DVD-ROM. The CPU 30 subjects the second DVD-ROM, the third DVD-ROM, ... to the same processing as that to which the first DVD-ROM has been subjected, thereby producing the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, .... Here, the CPU 30 writes each of the units 43 into DVD-ROMs only once. In short, all the units 43-1, 43-2, ... are distributed and recorded into the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... without overlap. The CPU 30 has the function of repeatedly producing the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... in the number of sets specified by the user.<br>

As illustrated, the CPU 60 of the serialization apparatus 51 displays, on the display 64 and by way of the display interface 65, ar. image for prompting insertion of the first DVD-ROM 15-1 into the DVD-ROM drive 68. When the DVD-ROM 15-1 is inserted into the DVD-ROM drive 68, the units 43 stored in the DVD-ROM 15-1 (e.g., the units 43-1 and 43-2) are read, and the thus-read units are stored in the hard disk drive 63. The CPU 60 subjects the second DVD-ROM, the third DVD-ROM, ... to the same processing as that to which the first DVD-ROM 15 has been subjected, thereby storing all the units 43-1, 43-2, ... into the hard disk drive 63.<br>
For each of the scene data sets 46, the CPU 60 decrypts the encrypted non-serial video data 45 comprised of the scene: data 46-1, 46-2, ... belonging<br><br>
to all the units 43-1, 43-2, ..., by means of the CSS, thus producing the non-serial video data 44. The CPU 60 sorts the scene data 42-1, 42-2, provided in the non-serial video data 44 in the<br>
correct sequence in accordance with preset procedures. The CPU 60 encrypts the serial video data 41 for each of the scene data sets 42 by means of the CSS, thus producing encrypted serial video data 80. The thus-encrypted serial video data 80 are output to the motion picture projector 52 by way of the projector interface 69. Here, the encrypted serial video data 80 correspond to the scene data 46-1, 46-2, ..., sorted in the correct sequence of playback.<br>
Upon receipt of the encrypted serial video data 80 by way of the input interface 74, the CPU 70 of the motion picture projector 52 stores the video data 80 into the hard disk drive 73. The CPU 70 decrypts the scene data 46-1, 46-2, constituting the encrypted serial video data 80 stored in the hard disk drive 73, by means of the CSS, thus preparing the serial video data 41. The motion picture projector 52 is configured so as not to permit out.puttincr of video data . When the motion picture-' projector 52 is disassembled, the data stored in the hard disk drive 73 are erased.<br>
Upon recpipt of a predetermined instruction from the operation section 66, the CPU 60 of the<br><br>
serialization apparatus 51 outputs a screening start instruction to the motion picture projector 52 by way of the projector interface 69. Upon receipt of a screening start instruction by way of the input interface 74, the CPU 70 of the motion picture projector 52 activates the motion picture projection section 75 and the projection interface 76, thereby supplying the serial video data 41 to the projection interface 76. Taking the screening start instruction output from the serialization apparatus 51 as a trigger, the motion picture projector 52 starts playing back (i.e., screening) the serial video data 41 stored in the hard disk drive 7 3.<br>
A-4; Flow of Processes for Distributing and Screening a Movie<br>
Referring primarily to Figs. 9 and 10, next will be described the flow of processes for distributing and screening a movie on the motion picture distribution-and-screening system of the foregoing construction. The following descriptions are based on the assumption that the power of the film reader 21, that of the computer system 22, that of the serialization apparatus 51, and that of the motion picture projector 52 have already been turned on. Further, the following descriptions are based on the assumption that the serialization<br><br>
apparatus 51 has already sorted the scene data sets 46-1, 46-2, ... in the correct sequence of projection.<br>
Fig. 9 is a flowchart showing the flow of the distribution operation to be performed by the distribution end. As illustrated, upon receipt of the roaster film 14 from the movie producer 11, the operator of the motion-picture distributor 12 causes the film reader 21 to read the master film 14. As shown in Fig. 4, an analog video signal corresponding to the master film 14 is input to the computer system 22, where the video signal is converted into a digital signal (step SA1). The master film 14 is read on a per-scene basis. For this reason, the serial video data 41, formed by means of sequentially arranging the scene data 42-1, 42-2, ..., which data correspond to digital image signals pertaining to respective scenes in a movie, are stored in the hard disk 33 of the computer system 22 -<br>
The computer system 22 produces non-serial video data 44 comprised of the units 43-1, 43-2, ..., wherein all the scene data sets 42-1, 42-2, ... are stored randomly in the, units 43-1, 43-2, ... without overlap (step SA2). The computer system 22 encrypts the scene data 42-1, 42-2, ... included in the non-serial video data 44, by way of the CSS<br><br>
thereby producing encrypted non-serial video data 45 (step SA3).<br>
The thus-prepared non-serial video data 45 are<br>
randomly written into a DVD-ROM for each unit 43. Only one set of the DVD-ROMs (15-1, 15-2, ...) is prepared (step SA4). Processing pertaining to step SA4 is repeated by the number of theaters 13 on which a movie is to be screened (step SA5). When setting of the number of theaters 13 on which a movie is to be screened is completed, the user delivers the DVD-ROM sets to the respective theaters 13 (step SA6).<br>
Fig. 10 is a flowchart showing the flow of playback operation to be performed by the playback end of the operation. As illustrated, when the theater 13 has received the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... from the motion-picture distributor 12 (step SB1), the operator of the theater 13 causes the serialization apparatus 51 to read the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ..., by way of actuation of the serialization apparatus 51 (step SB2). The encrypted non-serial video data 45 are stored in the hard disk 63 provided in the serialization apparatus 51.<br>
In the serialization apparatus 51, all the scene data sets 46-1, 46-2, ... constituting the encrypted non-serial video data 45 stored in the hard disk drive 63 are decrypted, thereby producing<br><br>
the non-serial video data 44 . Further, all the scene data sets 42-1, 42-2, ... constituting the non-serial video data 44 are sorted into an appropriate sequence in accordance with preset procedures, thus producing the serial video data 41. The serial video data 41 are encrypted for each of the scene data sets 42-1, 42-2, ..., whereby the encrypted serial video data 80 are produced (step SB3). The encrypted serial video data 80 are supplied to the motion picture projector 52.<br>
In the motion picture projector 52, all the scene data sets 46-1, 46-2, ... constituting the encrypted serial video data 80 are decrypted, whereby the serial video data 41 are prepared (step SB4). When the user enters a screening start instruction by way of the serialization apparatus 51, the motion picture projector 52 plays back the serial video data 41 (step SB5) . Consequently,<br>
video	corresponding to the serial video data 41<br>
output from the motion picture projection section<br>
of the motion picture projector 52	is projected,<br>
whereby a movie is screened.<br>
A-5: Supplement<br>
As mentioned above, according to the present embodiment, the video data, which are stored in the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2,... to be delivered to the theater 13 from the motion-picture distributor 12,<br><br>
are sorted randomly on a per-scene basis and also are encrypted on a per-scene basis. Even if a portion of the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... or all the DVD-ROMs are stolen by third parties, the third parties who do not have the authorized apparatus 50 cannot play back data properly. In other words, unauthorized viewing of a movie can be prevented.<br>
In the present embodiment, the serialization apparatus 51 does not output decrypted video data. Hence, even if the third parties own the authorized apparatus 50, they cannot duplicate the serial video data 41. In other words, unauthorized duplication of a movie can be prevented. In the present embodiment, the serialization apparatus 51 is separated from the motion picture projector 52. As shown in Fig. 11, however, they may be integrated into a single unit. Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing the configuration of an apparatus 110 to be disposed on the playback end of the operation. The apparatus 110 is formed by way of integrating the serialization apparatus 51 and the motion picture projector 52. In Fig. 11, those elements which are identical with the elements shown in Figs. 6 and 7 are assigned the same reference numerals. In the drawing, ROM 111 is the only newly provided element, wherein ROM 111 stores the programs that were stored in the ROM 62 and the programs that were stored in the ROM 72 . As is<br><br>
evident from the foregoing description, the apparatus HO functions as both the serialization apparatus 51 and the motion picture projector 52. The apparatus 110 is configured so as to prevent outputting of video data to the outside, as in the case of the motion picture projector 52. As mentioned above, so long as the serialization apparatus 51 and the motion picture projector 52 are integrated together, unauthorized duplication of a movie can be prevented more reliably.<br>
In the present embodiment, one set of DVD-ROMs 15 (i.e., one or more DVD-ROMs) is distributed. Hence, even if a portion of the DVD-ROMs is stolen by third parties, they cannot view a movie. Unauthorized viewing of a movie thus can be prevented more reliably. If the DVD-ROMs 15 constituting a set are delivered separately from each other, unauthorized viewing of the movie can be prevented more reliably. The foregoing embodiment has illustrated an example in which the movie producer 11 passes the master film 14 to the motion-picture distributor 12. However, it goes without saying that the movie producer 11 may pass the serial video data 41 to the motion-picture distributor 12.<br>
In this embodiment, a single encryption method using the CSS has been applied to the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... to be delivered to the theaters 13. The<br><br>
theaters 13 can employ a common encryption method. Hence, costs for manufacturing the serialization apparatus 51 and the motion picture projector 52 can be reduced. Conversely, another conceivable method is to change a method of encrypting the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... from one theater to another. For instance, an encryption key used by the CSS may differ from one theater to another, and each theater 13 decrypts data through use of a unique decryption key. In this embodiment, if third parties have acquired the encryption key of the theater 13-1, have also acquired all the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, ... to be delivered to the theater 13-2, and all the scene data sets have been sorted correctly by coincidence, the encryption key of the theater 13-2 differs from that of the theater 13-1. Hence, the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2 cannot be decrypted. By and large, prevention of unauthorized viewing or duplication of a movie can be ensured more reliably. As is evident from the foregoing description, in an embodiment also in which a different key is assigned to each of the motion-picture distributors, prevention of unauthorized viewing or duplication of a movie can be ensured by and large more reliably.<br>
The present embodiment has described an example in which the serialization apparatus 51 has set a sorting sequence beforehand. The sorting<br><br>
sequence may be reported to the theaters 13 from the motion-picture distributor 12. For instance, the motion-picture distributor 12 may report information representing a sorting sequence to the theaters 13 through use of communications means such as a facsimile. The operator in the theater 13 may set appropriate sorting procedures by means of actuating the serialization apparatus 51. Alternatively, an algorithm to be used for sorting scene data randomly in the computer system 22 may be correlated with an algorithm to be used for determining sorting procedures employed by the serialization apparatus 51, wherein the first day at which a movie is to be screened is taken as a key factor. The serialization apparatus 51 can acquire appropriate procedures only on or after the first day. In a case where different encryption keys are assigned to the respective theaters 13, an algorithm for sorting scene data randomly in the computer system 22 may be correlated with an algorithm to be used for determining sorting procedures employed by the serialization apparatus 51, wherein the encryption keys are taken as keys. The length of a scene corresponding to the scene data 42 shown in Fig. 4 can be set. For instance, when data compression rate is a priority, a certain length of time is assigned to respective scenes, thereby improving a compression rate.<br><br>
The previous embodiment has described that the apparatus 20 encrypts the serial video data 41 after having made the data 41 non-serial. However, the apparatus 20 may render the serial video data 41 non-serial after having encrypted the video data 41, and the apparatus 50 may decrypt the video data 41 after having serialized the non-serial video data 41. In this case, decryption and re-encryption operations to be performed by the serialization apparatus 51 become unnecessary.<br>
The apparatus 50 to be disposed on the playback end of the operation may be provided with a video buffer. Video data may then be read in a correct sequence (or a serial manner) from a plurality of DVD-ROMs while being decrypted, thus producing the serial video data 41.<br>
B:   Second Embodiment<br>
A motion picture distribution-and-screening system according to a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 12 through 18. Throughout the drawings, those elements which are the same as the elements shown in Figs. 1 through 11 are assigned the same reference numerals, and repetition of their explanations is omitted.<br>
B-l: Overall Configuration<br><br>
Fig. 12 shows the overall configuration of the motion picture distribution-and-screening system according to the second embodiment. The system shown in Fig. 12 differs from that shown in Fig. 1 in the following three points. First, encrypted non-serial video data 45 are output from a motion-picture distributor 120 with regard to the master film 14 produced by the movie producer 11. Second, a data distributor 121 having satellite distribution equipment receives the encrypted non-serial video data 45, and the distributor 121 distributes the data via satellite. Third, theaters 122-1, 122-2, ..., on which a movie of interest is to be screened, receive the thus-distributed encrypted non-serial video data 45 and screen the movie through use of the thus-received video data. In the present embodiment, the data distributor 121 is classified into the group located on the distribution end of the operation.<br>
B-2: Configuration of an Apparatus to be Disposed on the Distribution End of the Operation<br>
Referring to Figs. 13 and 14, next will be described the configuration of an apparatus to be disposed at the motion-picture distributor 120 and at the data distributor 121, which are on the distribution end of the operation.<br><br>
Fig. 13 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the apparatus 130. As illustrated, the apparatus 130 comprises: a film reader 21; a computer system 131, which produces encrypted non-serial video data 45 through use of a video signal output from the film reader 21, and which transmits the thus-produced video data; and satellite distribution equipment 132, which further encrypts the encrypted non-serial video data 45 transmitted from the computer system 131, and which distributes the thus-encrypted data to the satellites 122-1, 122-2, ....<br>
Fig. 14 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the computer system 131. The computer system shown in Fig. 14 differs in configuration from that shown in Fig. 3 in the following three points. First, a communications section 140 is provided in place of the DVD-ROM writer 39, the ROM 32, and the hard disk drive 33, for transmitting the encrypted non-serial video data 45 to the satellite distribution equipment 132. Second, the program to be used for controlling the DVD-ROM writer 39 is deleted from the ROM 32 and the hard disk drive 33. Third, the computer system 131 is provided with ROM 141 and a hard disk drive 142 to which a program to be used for controlling the communications section 140 is added.<br><br>
In the apparatus 130, as a result of turning on the power (unillustrated) , or in accordance with the user instruction entered by way of the operation section 36, the CPU 30 executes a cluster of programs stored in the ROM 141 and on the hard disk drive 142, thereby performing various types of processing. In connection with details of the processing, the apparatus 130 differs from the apparatus 20 in that the encrypted non-serial video data 45 are transmitted to the satellite distribution equipment 132 by way of the communications section 140 without being written into a DVD-ROM. In the present embodiment, the video data assumes, as the final form, the encrypted non-serial video data 45 rather than the DVD-ROMs 15-1, 15-2, .. shown in Fig. 4.<br>
B-3: Configuration of an Apparatus to be Disposed on the Playback End of the Operation<br>
Referring to Figs. 15 and 16, next will be described the configuration of an apparatus 150 disposed at the theaters 122 on the playback end of the operation.<br>
Fig. 15 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the apparatus 150. As illustrated, the apparatus 150 comprises: a satellite receiver 151, which receives the data distributed by the satellite distribution equipment<br><br>
132, and which outputs the thus-received data; a serialization apparatus 152 which receives the data output from the satellite receiver 151, produces encrypted serial video data 80 from the thus-received data, and outputs the thus-produced encrypted serial video data 80; and a motion picture projector 52 for playing back the encrypted serial video data 80.<br>
Fig. 16 is a block diagram showing the configuration of the serialization apparatus 152. The serialization apparatus shown in Fig. 16 differs in configuration from that shown in Fig. 6 in the following three points. First, an encrypted non-serial video data input section 160, provided in place of the DVD-ROM drive 68 and the ROM 62, receives the data output from the satellite receiver 151. Second, the program for controlling the DVD-ROM driver 68 is deleted from the ROM 62. Third, the serialization apparatus 152 is provided with ROM 161 to which is added a program for controlling the satellite receiver 151.<br>
In the serialization apparatus 152, as a result of turning on the power (unillustrated), or in accordance with a user instruction entered by way of the operation section 66 or with the data input by way of the satellite receiver 151, the CPU 50 executes a program stored in the ROM 161, thereby performing various types of processing. In<br><br>
connection with details of the processing, the serialization apparatus 152 differs from the serialization apparatus 51 in that the encrypted non-serial video data 45 are input by way of the encrypted non-serial video data input section 160 without reading the data from a DVD-ROM. In the present embodiment, processing of the encrypted non-serial video data 45 and subsequent processing shown in Fig. 8 are effected.<br>
B-4: Flow of Processes for Distributing and Screening a Movie<br>
Referring primarily to Figs. 17 and 18, next will be described the flow of a processes for distributing and screening a movie on the motion picture distribution-and-screening system of the foregoing construction. The following descriptions are based on the assumption that the power of the film reader 21, that of the computer system 131, that of the satellite distribution equipment 132, that of the motion picture projector 52, that of the satellite receiver 151, and that of the serialization apparatus 152 have already been turned on  Further, the following descriptions are based on the assumption that the serialization apparatus 152 has already sorted the scene data sets 46-1, 46-2, ... in the correct sequence of projection. Moreover, the satellite receiver 151<br><br>
—of the theater 122 on which a movie is to be<br>
screened	has already completed a preparation for<br>
performing a decrypting operation through use of the satellite distribution equipment 132.<br>
Fig. 17 is a flowchart showing the flow of a distributing operation to be effected on the distribution end of the operation. The flow of the distribution operation to be effected in the present embodiment is identical with processing pertaining to steps Al through A3 to be effected by the movie distribution-and-screening system according to the first embodiment. The encrypted non-serial video data 45 which have been prepared in the computer system 131 by step SA3 are transmitted to the satellite distribution equipment 132 in a random sequence for each unit 43. The data are further distributed to the theaters 122-1, 122-2, ... from the satellite distribution equipment 132 (step SCI).<br>
Fig. 18 is a flowchart showing the flow of a playback operation to be effected on the playback end of the operation. As illustrated, the encrypted non-serial video data 45 are input to the serialization apparatus 152 by way of the satellite receiver 151, which is disposed in the theater 122 (step SD1). The encrypted non-serial video data 45 are stored in the hard disk 63 of the serialization apparatus 152. Subsequently, processing,<br><br>
pertaining to steps SB2 through SB4, is carried out in the same manner as in the movie distribution-and-screening system according to the first embodiment. Consequently, a video corresponding to the serial video data 41 is projected from the motion picture projection section 75 of the motion picture projector 52, whereby a movie is screened.<br>
B-5: Supplement<br>
The second embodiment set forth can yield the same advantage as that: yielded by the first embodiment. The second embodiment eliminates a necessity for the motion-picture distributor 120 to duplicate media for distribution purposes. Hence, there can be greatly diminished efforts, which would otherwise be required, by the motion-picture distributor 120.<br>
Also, the modifications described in connection with the first embodiment may be applied to the second embodiment. Here, in the second embodiment, the motion picture projector 52 may be integrated with the satellite receiver 151 as well as with the serialization apparatus 152.<br>
The second embodiment has described an example in which the satellite receiver 151 disposed on the playback end has already completed preparations for decrypting data through use of the satellite distribution equipment 132. A decryption key may<br>
be reported to the theaters 122 from the motion-picture distributor 120. For instance, the motion-picture distributor 120 reports information representing a decryption key to the theaters 122 by way of communications devices such as a telephone. The operator in each of the theaters 122 may operate the satellite.receiver 151 through use of the information, thereby causing the satellite distribution equipment 132 to decrypt the encrypted data.<br>
C:   Overall Supplement<br>
As has been described, in the respective embodiments, safe distribution and screening of a movie using digital media can be effected.<br>
In addition, in each of the embodiments, costs incurred by distribution and screening facilities are diminished by adoption of standard specifications such as a DVD-VIDEO (e.g., distribution costs were diminished to about one-hundredth that incurred by the related-art system, and screening facility costs were diminished to about a quarter of that required by the related-art system). Thus, the present invention is not merely a simple replacement of the related-art system using a 35mm film with a new system. The present invention is expected to create new business models.<br><br>
For example, related-art movie theaters require a large audience in order to recoup investment for distributing a movie and for screening facilities. Hence, theaters are located on busy streets where large audiences can be expected. In other words, people who do not visit a busy street may be said to be distanced from movies. According to the embodiments of the present invention, costs required for distributing a movie, and those required by screening facilities, can be diminished greatly. Hence, a movie theater can be located in a district other than on a busy street. The system according to the present invention can give people who have been shunned by the related-art system a chance of appreciating a movie in the theater.<br>
A significant curtailment of costs required for distributing a film, or costs incurred by facilities of a movie theater, may promote diversification of the form of a theater. For example, there may b« prepared a private-style movie theater numbering 20 to 50 seats, and a waiting service may be offered. Viewing a movie in such a theater may attract people who avoid visiting movie theaters because they cannot feel relaxed in an ordinary movie theater. If such a movie theater is embodied by way of a related-art system, costs which users must bear become<br><br>
unreasonably high. However, the embodiments of the present invention enable realization of such a movie theater.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention are effective for improving profitability of existing movie theaters as well as for creating new business models- For example, in a cinema complex comprised of a large-size theater numbering 200 to 500 seats, and a plurality of small-size theaters each numbering 50 to 100 seats, the movie distribution-and-screening system described in connection with the above embodiments is employed for the small-size theaters, whereas a related-art system using a 35mm film is employed for the large-size theater. As a result, improvements in the profitability of the overall cinema complex can be expected.<br>
Although the embodiments have described a case in which the present invention is applied to distribution and screening of a movie, the present invention is not limited to such a case. The present invention can be applied to various systems which distribute and play back videos that are protected.<br>
D:   Advantageous effects of the Invention<br>
As has been described above, according to the present invention, there are distributed video data in which a plurality of unit video data sets are<br><br>
not arranged in time series. Even if the video data are stolen by third parties during distribution, unauthorized duplication or playback of the video data can be prevented. In other words, safe distribution and playback of video data (e.g., movie data), which must be distributed safely, can be effected.<br>
In a case where video data are distributed and delivered in the form of a plurality of computer readable media, if any one of the computer readable media is stolen by third parties, unauthorized playback and duplication of video data can be prevented. Thus, safety of video data can be improved.<br>
Further, so long as video data are distributed in an encrypted form, safety of the video data can be improved further.<br>
In a case where video data to be distributed to the playback end of the operation are distributed while being encrypted according to an encryption method assigned to the playback end, if any one of the video data sets is used illegally by third parties, safety of the remaining video data sets supplied to the playback end can be ensured.<br>
Further, if outputting of decrypted video data to the outside is prohibited on the playback end, safety of the video data can be improved to a much greater extent.<br><br>
Finally, as has been described, the present invention enables safe and low-cost distribution of movie data.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the specific above-described embodiments.
