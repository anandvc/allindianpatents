DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Now referring to figure 1, a fifth wheel coupling (1) is mounted on mounting fixture (3), which is bolted to the base to take the load during testing and avoid abnormal movement of test fifth wheel. A first pneumatic cylinder (5) for hitching and un-hitching is mounted on the cylinder-mounting bracket fixture (4), which is bolted to the base. The piston rod end of said first pneumatic cylinder (5) for hitching and un-hitching is connected to a push-pull member (6). The said push-pull member (6) is connected to the trailer pin (7). The said push-pull member (6) is supported by the guide member (9) which is mounted on support fixture member (8). The said guide members (9) are provided to facilitate the linear movement. The said guide members (9) are supported on the mounting fixture member (8) which is bolted to the base. The first pneumatic cylinder (5) for hitching and un-hitching is used to push or pullout the said trailer pin (7) into the said fifth wheel coupling by giving push -pull load through push-pull member (6). A said second pneumatic cylinder (11) for unlocking said trailer pin (7) is mounted on a mounting fixture (10) which is bolted to the base. The piston rod end of said second pneumatic cylinder (11) for unlocking said trailer pin (7) is connected to the hook member (15). The said hook member (15) is connected to lock-unlock lever member (2) of said fifth wheel coupling (1). The said second pneumatic cylinder (11) is used to unlock the said trailer pin (7) from said fifth wheel coupling by pulling said<br><br>
lock-unlock lever member (2) of said fifth wheel coupling (1). A third pneumatic cylinder (13) is mounted on a panel mounting fixture (12) which is bolted to the base. The piston rod end of said third pneumatic cylinder (13) is connected to a plate member (16). The said third pneumatic cylinder (13) is used to release said lock- unlock lever member (2) of the said fifth wheel coupling (1) from unlock notch on said fifth wheel coupling (1). A test rig control panel (14) is mounted on the top of the panel mounting fixture (12). The said test rig control panel (14) is used to mount a micro PLC (40) that is used to actuate the said pneumatic solenoid valves by sending electrical signal.<br>
In Figure2 of section- I and Figure -3, an air compressor's air reservoir (17) supplies air to the test rig and the shut-off valve (19) is for emergency air supply cut off. Connection line (18) is connected between said air reservoir (17) and said pneumatic shut-off valve (19). The connection line (20) is connected between the delivery port of said shut off valve (19) and the inlet port of the air pressure regulator (21), which is used to supply regulated air to the said test rig. A regulated air supply line (22) is connected between the input port (SI) of said first pneumatic solenoid valve (23) and the delivery port of said air pressure regulator (21). The said regulated air supply line (22) supplies air to the said first pneumatic solenoid valve (23), which is actuated by electrical signal (41) through electrical line (39), received from said micro PLC (40). A regulated air supply line (26) is connected between the input port (S2) of said second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) and the delivery port of said air pressure regulator (21). The said regulated air supply line (26) supplies air to the second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) which is actuated by electrical signal (42) through electrical line (38), received from said micro PLC (40). A regulated air supply line (31) is connected between the input port (S3) of third pneumatic solenoid valve (32) and the delivery port of said air pressure regulator (21). The said regulated air supply line (31) supplies air to the said third pneumatic solenoid valve (32) which is actuated by electrical signal (43)<br><br><br>
through electrical line(37), received from said micro PLC (40). A connection line (24) is connected between normally open delivery port (PI) of said first pneumatic solenoid valve (23) and the hitching and un-hitching port of said first pneumatic cylinder (5). The connection line (24) supplies air to said first pneumatic cylinder (5) for unhitching operation. A connection line (25) is connected between normally closed delivery port (P2) of said first pneumatic solenoid valve (23) and the hitching port of said first pneumatic cylinder (5). The said connection line (25) supplies air to said first pneumatic cylinder (5) for hitching operation when activated by said electrical signal (39) of said micro PLC (40). A connection line (28) is connected between normally closed delivery port (P3) of said second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) and the port of said second pneumatic cylinder (11) for trailer pin unlocking. The said connection line (28) supplies air to the said second pneumatic cylinder (11) for trailer pin (7) unlocking operation when activated by electrical signal (42) through electrical line(38), received from said micro PLC (40). The unused delivery port (29) of said second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) is plugged. The port (30) of said second pneumatic cylinder (11) for trailer pin unlocking is open to atmosphere. This is to allow the unlocked lever to move freely along with linkages for locking the said trailer pin during hitching operation. The connection line (33) is connected between normally open delivery port (P5) of said third pneumatic solenoid valve (32) and the third pneumatic cylinder (13) port. The said connection line (33) supplies air to the said third pneumatic cylinder (13) for retracting the said plate member (16). The piston rod with plate member retraction avoids the said lock-unlock lever member (2) fouling with plate member during said trailer pin (7) locking operation. A connection line (34) is connected between normally closed delivery port (P6) of said third pneumatic solenoid valve (32) and the said third pneumatic cylinder (13) port. The said connection line (34) supplies air to the said third pneumatic cylinder (13) for releasing lock-unlock lever member (2) of the said fifth wheel coupling<br><br><br>
from unlock notch for next cycle when activated by electrical signal (43) through electrical line(37), received from said micro PLC (40).<br>
Now referring to Figure -2 of section- II and Figure -3, an electrical power supply (35) is drawn by micro PLC (40) through electrical line (36). First output electrical signal (41) from said micro PLC (40) is going to the said first pneumatic solenoid valve (23) through electrical line (39) for hitching operation. Second output electrical signal (42) from said micro PLC (40) is going to the second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) through electrical line (38) for fifth wheel lever (2) unlocking. Third output electrical signal (43) from said micro PLC (40) is going to the said third pneumatic solenoid valve (32) through electrical line (37) for releasing the fifth wheel lever (2) from unlocking notch.<br>
Giving electrical power supply to said Micro PLC (40) starts the fifth wheel test rig. The first output electrical signal (41) from said micro PLC (40) triggers the said first pneumatic solenoid valve (23) for supplying the air to said first pneumatic cylinder (5) for hitching operation for the predetermined duration as given in Figure-4. The second output electrical signal (42) from said micro PLC (40) triggers the said second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) for supplying the air to said second pneumatic cylinder (11) for unlocking operation for the predetermined duration. The said micro PLC (40) stops the second output electrical signal(42) goes to the said second pneumatic solenoid valve (27) and then stops the first output electrical signal (41) which stops the air supply for hitching and gives air supply to said first pneumatic cylinder (5) for un hitching operation. The third output electrical signal (43) from micro PLC (40) triggers the said third pneumatic solenoid valve (32) for supplying the air to said pneumatic cylinder(13) for releasing the fifth wheel coupling lever from unlock notch just after the start of unhitching operation. The said micro PLC (40) stops the third output electrical signal (43) goes to the said<br><br><br>
third solenoid valve (32) before the next cycle starts, which completes one cycle. Likewise the test cycle continues till the test target cycle completes.<br>
