Thermotropic liquid crystalline homopolyesters obtained from rigid monomers such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid are intractable, insoluble and not processable because they decompose prior to melting and their transition temperatures are too high for the existing equipments to process them.

There has been a large number of attempts to bring down the transition temperatures to a processable range (J-I.Jin, C-S. Kang, Prog.Polym.Sci. vol.22,937(1997), H.Han, P.K.Bhowmik Prog.

33,  3968 (1992)).   A number of chemical approaches have been devised to arrive at structures that have lower tansition temperatures and lower symmetries.     These approaches involve disrupting the ordered structures of the homopolyesters by introducing chain disrupters such as flexible unit,  a kink structure, or crank shaft srtucture etc. or by copolymerising with suitable comonomers that bring down the transition temperatures by inducing frustrated packing of the molecules by randomisation. A number of copolyesters have thus been prepared out of which a few commercial polymers such  as Vectra*, and Xydar*, are well known. It is, however, now realised that these copolyesters are still having a processing temperature above 300°C and hence requires newer methods or structures to overcome this problem. In this situation 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, the monomer that possesses a -CH2- unit between the carboxyl and the rigid phenyl unit and hence expected to bring down the transition temperature when copolymerised stands a significant chance for contributing to solving this problem. The drawbacks of the currently marketed liquid crystalline polyesters are that, polyesters of 4-hydroxy benzoic acid do not form a melt below its decompositon temperature and liquid crystalline copolyesters like 4-hydroxy benzoic acid / polyethylene terepthalate system (Eastman X7G) has several short comings in that the heat distortion temp is low (300°C) processing is rather difficult. We have<br><br>
already shown that the homopolyester of 4-hydroxyphenyacetic acid is a melt processable liquid crystalline polymer exhibiting a clear nematic phase through, Indian patent application number NF 204/97 dated 6.8.1997.<br>
So a copolymer of    4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is expected to give   copolyesters of  better   melt   processability and thermal stability with the expected nematic meso phase. Although this is the easiest route to achieve melt processability, there is no publication or patent  on the preparation of the  liquid  crystalline  copolyester.  Though homopolymerisation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid is well studied, only a few reports are available on the polymerisation and characterisation of 4- hydroxybenzoic acid containing methylene units between aromatic ring and the carboxyl groups such as    4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid    and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic    acid.    There   is    one   report    on    the       preparation   of poly(4-hydroxyphenylacetate)   (H-G. Elias, R.J.Warner, Makromol. Chem. 182, 681-686 (1981). However, the molecular weight of the polymer is low and the mesqphase behaviour was not studied.     The preparation  of the copolyester of       4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid  and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid would be advantageous when the cost of the final product is compared with the commercial products such as Vectra* and Xydar*. These commercial copolyesters use comonomers such as    2-hydroxy,6-naphthoic acid • and 4,4'-biphenol, which are extremely expensive and therefore, the commercial liquid crystalline polymers are   costly. In contrast, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid is comparatively cheap and hence, it is possible to achieve a cost effective process for the production of liquid crystalline copolyesters through this route. Moreover it contains aliphatic carbonyl group which is far more electrophilic than the carbonyl group of entirely aromatic hydroxyacids , and therefore more sensitive to hydrolytic degradation .<br><br>
A characteristic advantage of such polyesters is their higher heat distortion temperature and<br>
higher Tg compared to aliphatic polyesters. These monomers are nontoxic at low levels and<br>
naturally occuring. So these copolyesters will be of application as    biodegradable plastics.<br>
(H.R.Kricheldorf, T.Stukenbrock, MacromoI.Chem.Phy. 198, 3753, 1997). In these copolyesters<br>
by controlling the amount of 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid the<br>
crystallinity and thus the degradability can be tailor- made or controlled.   There are only a few<br>
reports on the copolymerisation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid with other hydroxyacids.<br>
(K.Imasaka, T.Nagai, MYoshida, H.Fukuzaki, M.Asano, M.Kumakura Jrfakromol.Chem.Wl,<br>
2077, 1990; ). But to our knowledge there is no report on the synthesis of liquid crystalline<br>
polyesters from 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process of preparation of liquid crystalline polyesters. Another object of the invention is , therefore, to provide a process for the preparation of liquid crystalline copolyester having transition temperature lower than that of poly (4- oxybenzoate) and in  the processable range below 300°C and having nematic mesophase from 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.<br>
The   main   finding   underlying   the   present   invention   is   our   observation   that<br>
•«<br>
poly(4-oxyphenylacetate) obtained by the acidolysis polycondensation of 4-acetoxyphenyl acetic acid, prepared by acetylation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid using acetylating agents in presence of catalysts like acetates of sodium, potassium etc., has been found to give mesophase transition at 240°C and isotropises at 260°C. Above 240°C it flows like a liquid with textures correspond to nematic thread. This homopolyester is a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer having thermal<br><br>
Stability above 340 degree C and better melt processability art 240 degree C. The other main finding underlying the present invention is our observation is that poly(4-oxyphenylacetate-co-4-oxybenzoate) obtained by the acidolysis melt polycondensation of 4-acetoxyphenylacetic acid and 4-acetoxybenzoic acid at 240-260 degree C has been found to give nematic mesophase transition above 260 degree C with textures corresponding to nematic thread. This copolyester is a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer having thermal stability value of Tj (Temperature at which thermal decomposition is initiated) 400 degree C and better melt processability at 260 degree C.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of liquid<br>
crystalline	polyesters	of	formula<br>

The process of the present invention has essentially the following steps: acetylation of the monomer 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid at 60-90°C for 1-2 hr in presence of acetylating agents, in presence of a catalyst , and acetylation of the second monomer 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in presence of acetylating agents and sodium hydroxide'at ambient conditions; polymerisation of the prepared acetoxyderivatives by acidolysis polycondensation in melt under inert atmosphere , optionally in presence of catalyststs, or high temperature solvent at 240-260°C temperature for 4-6h. Polymerisation was further continued under reduced pressure at a temperature in the range of 260-280°C for a period of 1-2 hr. This was followed by a post-polymerisation step,<br>
optionally carried out at a temperature in the range of 240-250°C under inert atmosphere for 6-12 hr , optionally a precipitation step involving trifluoroacetic acid- dichloromethane mixture and methanol, and a purification step involving soxhlet extraction using solvent mixtures such as acetone-alcohol, acetone -methylethyl ketone etc.<br>

Allowed to settle and filtered, dried and taken in a 60ml polymerisation tube with 0.01% lead acetate and placed in a salt bath heated to 200 °C under slow nitrogen purge. Then temperature is raised to 240°C and kept under stirring for Ihr. Then 5ml of dicyclohexylbiphenyl were added and the reaction was continued at 250°C for Ihr and then raised the temperature to 260°C for 2hr more. Then continued the reaction under vacuum for Ihr. The tube was cooled to 200°C and removed from the bath and allowed to cool to<br>
room temperature    and the product was chipped out of the tube. Dissolved in 20ml of trifluoroacetic acid :dichloromethane 1:4 mixture and precipitated by adding in 50ml methanol, washed free of acid , filtered, dried.   Further purified by extracting for 24 hrs in a soxhlet extractor using acetone-isopropyl alcohol mixture. It was then further dried under reduced pressure in an air oven at 65°C forlh. The polymer was further heated under nitrogen atmosphere at 240°C for 12h . The advantages of the present invention are the following:<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of melt processabe liquid crystalline polyesters from 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. The liquid crystalline polyester obtained from 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid of formula  shown in formula 1   of the drawing  acccompanying this specification where R = nil or -0-C6H4-CO-  has a transition temperature at 240-260°C which is lower than those (300°C) of the commercial liquid crystalline copolyesters such as Vectra* and Xydar*. Hence, the liquid crystalline polyester obtained by the process of the present invention can be melt processed at a temperature of 240-260°C which is lower than that of Vectra* and Xydar* and this may solve many ofcthe processing problem s associated with the existing commercial liquid crystalline polymers. The liquid crystalline polyester obtained by the process of the present invention does not decompose before isotropisation whereas poly(4-oxybenzoate) decomposes prior to melting. As the present invention described by the present process of preparation of liquid crystalline polyester from 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid does not use a comonomer which is expensive, the cost of the liquid crystalline polyester obtained by the present process is rather low when compared to those of Vectra* and Xydar*. Commercial copolyesters use comonomers such as derivatives of hydroxynaphthoic acid and<br>
biphenol which are expensive and therefore, the commercial liquid crystalline polymers are costly.<br>
In contrast, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid , the    comonomer used in the preparation of the<br>
copolyester prepared by the process of the present invention,     is comparatively cheap. The<br>
process of the present invention has a step of post-polymerisation optionally whereby a higher<br>
molecular weight is obtained so that the properties of the polymer are better. This copolyester has<br>
got comparatively higher decomposition temperature, Ti of 400°C which is higher compared to<br>
poly(4-hydroxyphenylacetate). It shows drastic reduction in viscosity due to nematic mesophase<br>
which is required for the further processing by injection molding. Moreover these copolyesters are<br>
biodegradable.<br><br><br><br><br>
