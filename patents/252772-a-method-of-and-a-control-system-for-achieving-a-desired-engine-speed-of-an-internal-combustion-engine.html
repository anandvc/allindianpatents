TORQUE BASED ENGINE SPEED CONTROL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
60/861,493, filed November 28, 2006, entitled, "Engine Torque Control. This<br>
application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/861,492, filed<br>
on November 28, 2006. The disclosures of the above applications are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to engines, and more particularly<br>
to torque-based speed control of an engine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines combust an air and fuel mixture<br>
within cylinders to drive pistons, which produces drive torque. Air flow into the<br>
engine is regulated via a throttle. More specifically, the throttle adjusts throttle<br>
area, which increases or decreases air flow into the engine. As the throttle area<br>
increases, the air flow into the engine increases. A fuel control system adjusts<br>
the rate that fuel is injected to provide a desired air/fuel mixture to the cylinders.<br>
As can be appreciated, increasing the air and fuel to the cylinders increases the<br>
torque output of the engine.<br>
[0004] Engine control systems have been developed to accurately<br>
control engine speed output to achieve a desired engine speed. Traditional<br>
engine control systems, however, do not control the engine speed as accurately<br>
as desired. Further, traditional engine control systems do not provide as rapid of<br>
a response to control signals as is desired or coordinate engine torque control<br>
among various devices that affect engine torque output.<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
achieving a desired engine speed of an internal combustion engine. The method<br>
includes determining the desired engine speed, calculating a slow response<br>
torque value based on the desired engine speed and calculating a fast response<br>
torque value based on the desired engine speed. A slow response actuator<br>
command and a fast response actuator command are generated based on the<br>
slow response torque value and the fast response torque value, respectively.<br>
Operation of the engine is regulated based on the slow response actuator<br>
command and the fast response actuator command to achieve the desired<br>
engine speed.<br>
[0006] In other features, the slow response actuator command is a<br>
desired throttle area. The method further includes determining a desired air per<br>
cylinder (APC) value based on the slow response torque value and determining<br>
the desired throttle area based on the desired APC and a manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP) of the engine.<br>
[0007] In other features, the fast response actuator command is a<br>
desired spark timing. The method further includes determining the desired spark<br>
timing based on the fast response torque value and a measured APC of the<br>
engine.<br>
[0008] In other features, the method further includes determining a<br>
minimum torque value based on the desired engine speed and a transmission<br>
gear ratio. The slow response torque value is determined based on the minimum<br>
torque value. The method further includes determining at least one of a reserve<br>
torque value, a feed-forward torque value and a proportional-integral torque<br>
value. The slow response torque is further based on the at least one of a reserve<br>
torque value, a feed-forward torque value and a proportional-integral torque<br>
value. The method further includes calculating an engine speed error based on a<br>
measured engine speed and the desired engine speed. The proportional-integral<br>
torque value is determined based on the engine speed error.<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
3<br>
[0009] In still other features, the method further includes determining at<br>
least one of a reserve torque value, a run torque value and a proportional torque<br>
value. The fast response torque is further based on the at least one of a reserve<br>
torque value, a run torque value and a proportional torque value. The method<br>
further includes calculating an engine speed error based on a measured engine<br>
speed and the desired engine speed. The proportional torque value is<br>
determined based on the engine speed error.<br>
[0010] In yet another feature, the method further includes limiting each<br>
of the slow response torque value and the fast response torque value between<br>
respective minimum and maximum values.<br>
[0011] The present disclosure provides a torque-based engine speed<br>
control that improves the overall flexibility of the engine control system, simplifies<br>
the software requirements for implementing such cpntrol and provides for an<br>
automated calibration process. In this manner, overall implementation and<br>
development costs for an engine system can be reduced.<br>
[0012] Further advantages and areas of applicability of the present<br>
disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description provided<br>
hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific<br>
examples, while indicating an embodiment of the disclosure, are intended for<br>
purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide<br>
the described functionality.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake manifold 14 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 18. Although a single cylinder 18 is illustrated, it can be<br>
appreciated that the coordinated torque control system of the present invention<br>
can be implemented in engines having a plurality of cylinders including, but not<br>
limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 cylinders.<br>
[0019] A fuel injector (not shown) injects fuel that is combined with the<br>
air as it is drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. The fuel injector may<br>
be an injector associated with an electronic or mechanical fuel injection system<br>
20, a jet or port of a carburetor or another system for mixing fuel with intake air.<br>
The fuel injector is controlled to provide a desired air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio within<br>
each cylinder 18.<br>
[0020] An intake valve 22 selectively opens and closes to enable the<br>
air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 18. The intake valve position is regulated by<br>
an intake cam shaft 24. A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture<br>
within the cylinder 18. A spark plug 26 initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture,<br>
which drives the piston in the cylinder 18. The piston, in turn, drives a crankshaft<br>
(not shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 18<br>
is forced out an exhaust port when an exhaust valve 28 is in an open position.<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
The exhaust valve position is regulated by an exhaust cam shaft 30. The<br>
exhaust is treated in an exhaust system and is released to atmosphere. Although<br>
single intake and exhaust valves 22, 28 are illustrated, it can be appreciated that<br>
the engine 12 can include multiple intake and exhaust valves 22, 28 per cylinder<br>
18.<br>
[0021] The engine system 10 can include an intake cam phaser 32 and<br>
an exhaust cam phaser 34 that respectively regulate the rotational timing of the<br>
intake and exhaust cam shafts 24, 30. More specifically, the timing or phase<br>
angle of the respective intake and exhaust cam shafts 24, 30 can be retarded or<br>
advanced with respect to each other or with respect to a location of the piston<br>
within the cylinder 18 or crankshaft position. In this manner, the position of the<br>
intake and exhaust valves 22, 28 can be regulated with respect to each other or<br>
with respect to a location of the piston within the cylinder 18. By regulating the<br>
position of the intake valve 22 and the exhaust valve 28, the quantity of air/fuel<br>
mixture ingested into the cylinder 18 and therefore the engine torque is regulated.<br>
[0022] The engine system 10 can also include an exhaust gas<br>
recirculation (EGR) system 36. The EGR system 36 includes an EGR valve 38<br>
that regulates exhaust flow back into the intake manifold 14. The EGR system is<br>
generally implemented to regulate emissions. However, the mass of exhaust air<br>
that is recirculated back into the intake manifold 14 also affects engine torque<br>
output.<br>
[0023] A control module 40 operates the engine based on the torque-<br>
based engine speed control of the present disclosure. More specifically, the<br>
control module 40 generates a throttle control signal and a spark advance control<br>
signal based on a desired engine speed (RPMDES). A throttle position signal<br>
generated by a throttle position sensor (TPS) 42. An operator input 43, such as<br>
an accelerator pedal, generates an operator input signal. The control module 40<br>
commands the throttle 16 to a steady-state position to achieve a desired throttle<br>
area (ATHRDES) and commands the spark timing to achieve a desired spark timing<br>
(SDES). A throttle actuator (not shown) adjusts the throttle position based on the<br>
throttle control signal.<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0024] An intake air temperature (IAT) sensor 44 is responsive to a<br>
temperature of the intake air flow and generates an intake air temperature (IAT)<br>
signal. A mass airflow (MAF) sensor 46 is responsive to the mass of the intake<br>
air flow and generates a MAF signal. A manifold absolute pressure (MAP)<br>
sensor 48 is responsive to the pressure within the intake manifold 14 and<br>
generates a MAP signal. An engine coolant temperature sensor 50 is responsive<br>
to a coolant temperature and generates an engine temperature signal. An engine<br>
speed sensor 52 is responsive to a rotational speed (i.e., RPM) of the engine 12<br>
and generates in an engine speed signal. Each of the signals generated by the<br>
sensors is received by the control module 40. The engine system 10 can also<br>
include a turbo or supercharger 54 that is driven by the engine 12 or engine<br>
exhaust.<br>
[0025] The torque-based engine speed (RPM) control of the present<br>
disclosure achieves RPMDES based on ATHRDES and SDES- More specifically, the<br>
torque-based engine speed control regulates transitions between engine speed<br>
and torque control and engine speed control. As explained in further detail<br>
below, this is achieved through the application of open-loop torque control to<br>
transform an engine RPM command into different engine actuator commands<br>
including, but not limited to, spark timing (S), throttle position (ATHR) and cam<br>
phaser positions. This is further achieved through application of RPM feedback<br>
to maintain RPMDES under coast down, transition to engine RPM control and idle<br>
speed control conditions, as well as through calculating a minimum torque (TMIN)<br>
required to maintain RPMDES-<br>
[0026] The torque-based engine RPM control determines a slow<br>
response requested torque value (TREQSL) and a fast response requested torque<br>
value (TREQFS)- TREQSL is determined based on the following relationship:<br>
where:	TRES is a reserve torque;<br>
TFF is a feed-forward torque;<br>
TMIN is the minimum torque required to maintain RPMDES; and<br>
TP1 is a proportional-integral torque term.<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
TRES is an additional amount of torque that is incorporated to compensate for<br>
unknown loads that can suddenly load the engine. TFF is a feed-forward torque<br>
amount that indicates the additional amount of torque required as a result of a<br>
transmission range change (e.g., a change from neutral (N) to drive (D)). TP1 is<br>
determined in accordance with the following relationship:<br><br>
where:	RPMERR is an RPM error;<br>
kp is a proportional constant; and<br>
k1 is an integral constant.<br>
RPMERR is determined as the difference between RPMDES and an actual RPM<br>
(RPMACT) measured by the engine RPM sensor 52. TREQSL is limited between<br>
minimum and maximum values based on the following relationship:<br><br>
[0027] TREQSL is used to determine a slow response term using an<br>
inverse torque module. More specifically, a desired air per cylinder (APCDES)<br>
value is determined by processing TREQSL through the inverse torque model, as is<br>
represented in the following relationship:<br><br>
where:	SUM is an un-managed spark timing term;<br>
I is the intake cam phase angle; and<br>
E is the exhaust cam phase angle.<br>
To improve the stability of the control, APCDES is filtered using a low-pass filter to<br>
provide a filtered APCDES.<br>
[0028] The filtered APCDES is processed using a compressed flow (CF)<br>
model to provide a desired throttle area (ATHRDES)- More specifically, a desired<br>
mass air flow (MAFDES) is determined based on the following relationship:<br><br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
where KCYL is a cylinder constant. For example, kCYL is equal to 15 for an 8-<br>
cylinder engine, 20 for a 6-cylinder engine and 15 for a 4-cylinder engine.<br>
ATHRDES is determined based on the following relationship:<br><br>
where B is the measured barometric pressure, TAMB is the ambient air<br>
temperature and O is based on a pressure ratio (PR) according to the following<br>
relationships:<br><br>
PR is the ratio of MAP to the ambient pressure (PAMB) and PCRITICAL- PCRITICAL is<br>
defined as the pressure ratio at which the velocity of the air flowing past the<br>
throttle equals the velocity of sound. This condition is called choked or critical<br>
flow. The critical pressure ratio is determined by:<br><br>
where y is equal to the ratio of specific heats for air and range from about 1.3 to<br>
about 1.4.<br>
[0029]      The torque-based engine RPM control determines TREQFS based<br>
on the following relationship:<br><br>
where:	TRUN is a run torque value; and<br>
TP is a proportional torque value.<br>
TRUN is determined based on the following relationship:<br><br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
9<br>
where APCACT is that actual air per cylinder value and is determined based on the<br>
MAF signal. TP is determined based on the following relationship:<br><br>
where kFp is a proportional constant for the fast term. TREQFS is limited between<br>
minimum and maximum values based on the following relationships:<br><br>
[0030] The desired spark timing (SDEs) is determined based on the<br>
following relationship:<br><br>
where APCDES is filtered using a low-pass filter to provide a filtered APCDES(FILT).<br>
In this manner, the stability of the control is improved. SDES is limited based on<br>
the following relationships:<br><br>
The torque-based engine RPM control subsequently regulates engine operation<br>
based on ATHRDES and SDES to achieve RPMDES.<br>
[0031] Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps executed by the<br>
torque-based engine speed control will be discussed in further detail. In step<br>
200, control determines whether the engine is on (i.e., running). If the engine is<br>
not one, control ends. If the engine is on, control generates RPMDES in step 202.<br>
In step 204, control determines TREQSL and TREQFS based on RPMDES, as<br>
described in detail above. ATHRDES is determined based on TREQSL in step 206, as<br>
described in detail above. In step 208, control determines SDES based on TREQFS,<br>
as described in detail above. Control operates the engine based on ATHRDES and<br>
SDES to achieve RPMDEs in step 210 and control loops back to step 200.<br>
[0032] Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
torque-based engine speed control will be discussed. The exemplary modules<br>
include an RPMDES module 300, a TM!N module 302, a proportional-integral (PI)<br>
module 304, a proportional (P) module 306, limiting modules 308a, 308b, 308c,<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
10<br>
inverse torque model (ITM) modules 310a, 310b, low-pass filter (LPF) modules<br>
312a, 312b, a compressed flow (CF) module 314 and an engine control module<br>
(ECM)316.<br>
[0033] The RPMDES module 300 generates RPMDES based on a<br>
standard block of RPM control described in detail in commonly assigned U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,405,581 B1, issued on June 18, 2002 and entitled System and Method<br>
of Controlling the Coastdown of a Vehicle, the disclosure of which is expressly<br>
incorporated herein by reference. RPMDES is output to the TMIN module 302 and a<br>
summer module 318. The TMIN 302 module determines TDES, for example, from a<br>
look-up table, based on RPMDES and a current transmission gear ratio. TMIN is<br>
output to a summer module 320.<br>
[0034] The summer module 318 determines an RPM error (RPMERR) as<br>
the difference between RPMDES and an actual RPM (RPMACT). RPMACT is<br>
determined using the engine RPM sensor 52. RPMERR is output to the PI module<br>
304 and the P module 306. The PI module 304 determines TP1 and the P module<br>
determines Tp, as described above. Tp1 is output to the summer module 320 and<br>
Tp is output to a summer module 322. A summer module 324 determines a base<br>
torque (TBASE) as the difference between an unmanaged-filtered torque (TUMF)<br>
and TRES. TBASE is output to the summer module 322.<br>
[0035] The summer module 320 determines TREQSL as the sum of TREs,<br>
TFF, TMIN and Tp1. TREQSL is output to the limiting module 308a, which limits the<br>
value of TREQSL between minimum and maximum values, as described in detail<br>
above. The limited TREQSL is output to the ITM module 310a, which determines<br>
APCDES based on TREQSL, SUM and other parameters, as discussed in detail<br>
above. APCDES is filtered in the LPF module 312a and is output to the CF<br>
module 314. The CF module 314 determines ATHRDES based on the filtered<br>
APCDES and MAP, as described above. ATHRDES is output to the ECM 316.<br>
[0036] The summer module 322 determines TREQFS as the sum of TP<br>
and TERR. TREQFS is output to the limiting module 308b. The limiting module 308b<br>
limits the value of TREQFS between minimum and maximum values, as described<br>
in detail above.   The LPF module 312b filters APCACT and outputs the filtered<br><br>
GP-308405-PTE-CD<br>
11<br>
APCACT to the ITM module 310b. The limited TREQFs is output to the ITM module<br>
310b, which determines SDES based on TREQFSL, the filtered APCACT and other<br>
parameters, as discussed in detail above. The limiting module 308c limits the<br>
value of SDES between minimum and maximum values, as described in detail<br>
above. The limited SDES is output to the ECM 316. The ECM 316 generates<br>
control signals based on ATHRDES and SDDES to achieve RPMDES.<br>
[0037] The torque-based engine speed control of the present<br>
disclosure improves the overall flexibility of the engine control system, simplifies<br>
the software requirements for implementing such control and provides for an<br>
automated calibration process. In this manner, overall implementation and<br>
development costs for an engine system can be reduced.<br>
[0038] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification<br>
and the following claims.<br><br>
