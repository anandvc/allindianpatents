THEREFROM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	Among other things, this invention relates to water-soluble and non-<br>
peptidic polymers, and conjugates made therefrom, each having linear, branched, or multiarm configurations, and characterized by one or more degradable linkages. Upon administration, a conjugate described herein degrades at one or more degradable linkages to thereby result in smaller species that can be eliminated more efficiently than the corresponding non-degraded conjugate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Covalent attachment of the hydrophilic polymer, poly(ethylene glycol),<br>
abbreviated "PEG," to molecules and surfaces is of considerable utility in areas such<br>
as biotechnology and medicine. PEG is a polymer that possesses many beneficial<br>
properties. For instance, PEG is soluble in water and in many organic solvents, is<br>
non-toxic and non-immunogenic, and when attached to a surface, PEG provides a<br>
biocompatible, protective coating. Common applications or uses of PEG include (i)<br>
covalent attachment to proteins to, for example, extend plasma half-life and reduce<br>
clearance through the kidney, (ii) attachment to surfaces such as in arterial<br>
replacements, blood contacting devices, and biosensors, (iii) use as a soluble carrier<br>
for biopolymer synthesis, and (iv) use as a reagent in the preparation of hydrogels.<br>
[0003]	In many if not all of the uses noted above, it is necessary to first<br>
activate the PEG by converting its hydroxyl terminus to a functional group capable of readily reacting with a functional group found within a desired target molecule or surface, such as a functional group found on the surface of a protein. For proteins, typical functional groups include functional groups associated with the side chains of lysine, cysteine, histidine, arginine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, threonine, and tyrosine, as well as the the N-terminal amino functional group and the C-terminal carboxylic acid functional group.<br>
[0004]	The PEG used as a starting material for most PEG activation reactions<br>
is typically an end-capped PEG.   An end-capped PEG is one where one or more of<br>
the hydroxyl groups, typically located at a terminus of the polymer, is converted into a non-reactive group, such as a methoxy, ethoxy, or benzyloxy group. Most commonly used is methoxyPEG, abbreviated as mPEG. End-capped PEGs such as mPEG are generally preferred, since such end-capped PEGs are typically more resistant to cross-linking and aggregation.   The structures of two commonly employed end-capped PEG alcohols, mPEG and monobenzyl PEG (otherwise known as bPEG), are shown below, <br>
wherein n typically ranges from about 10 to about 2,000.<br>
[0005]	Despite many successes, conjugation of a polymer to an active agent is<br>
often challenging. For example, it is known that attaching a relatively long poly(ethylene glycol) molecule to an active agent typically imparts greater water solubility than attaching a shorter poly(ethylene glycol) molecule. One of the drawbacks of some conjugates bearing such long poly(ethylene glycol) moieties, however, is the possibility that such conjugates may be substantially inactive in vivo. It has been hypothesized that these conjugates are substantially inactive due to the length of the poly(ethylene glycol) chain, which effectively "wraps" itself around the entire active agent, thereby limiting access to ligands required for pharmacologic activity.<br>
[0006]	The challenge associated with relatively inactive conjugates bearing<br>
relatively large poly(ethylene glycol) moieties has been solved, in part, by using "branched" forms of a polymer conjugated to the active agent. Examples of a branched version of a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative are conventionally referred to as "mPEG2-N-hydroxysuccinimide" and "mPEG2-aldehyde" as shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein n represents the number of repeating ethylene oxide monomer units. Other branched polymer structures comprise a polyol core, such as a glycerol oligomer, having multiple polymer arms covalently attached thereto at the sites of the hydroxyl groups. Exemplary branched polymer structures having a polyol core are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,730,334.<br>
[0007]	Another reason for using branched structures like those above in the<br>
synthesis of a conjugate relates to the desire to increase the in vivo circulation time of the drug. Larger polymers are known to have longer circulation times than smaller polymers. Hence, drugs attached to higher molecular weight polymers have longer circulation times, thus reducing the dosing frequency of the drug, which must often be injected.<br>
[0008]	Although addressing some of the shortcomings associated with<br>
relatively large polymer sizes, branched polymer structures have been associated with drawbacks of their own. For example, although a branched polymer attached to an active agent may have satisfactory pharmacologic activity, a branched polymer can still suffer from insufficient clearance from the body. Thus, while it is desirable to increase the circulation time of a drug by forming a drug-polymer conjugate, there is a competing desire to ensure that the conjugate remains susceptible to elimination from the body.<br>
[0009]	As a result, there is an ongoing need in the art for linear, branched, or<br>
multiarm polymer derivatives that have the molecular weight necessary to provide a for a conjugate that has the desirable in vivo circulation time, but which also exhibits timely clearance from the body. The present invention addresses this and other needs in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]	The present invention provides segmented, degradable polymeric<br>
reagents suitable for reaction with biologically active agents to form conjugates, the polymeric reagents comprising one or more polymer chains divided or separated by<br>

The polymeric reagents of the invention can have a substantially linear structure, although branched or multiarm structures are contemplated as well.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017]	Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood<br>
that this invention is not limited to the particular polymers, synthetic techniques, active agents, and the like as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
[0018]	It must be noted that, as used in this specification, the singular forms<br>
"a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a "polymer" includes a single polymer as well as two or more of the same or different polymers, reference to a "conjugate" refers to a single conjugate as well as two or more of the same or different conjugates, reference to an "excipient" includes a single excipient as well as two or more of the same or different excipients, and the like. I. Definitions<br>
[0019]	In describing and claiming the present invention, the following<br>
terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions described below.<br>
[0020]	"PEG," "polyethylene glycol" and "poly(ethylene glycol)" are used<br>
herein to mean any water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typically, PEGs for use in the present invention will comprise one of the two following structures: "-O(CH2CH2O)n-" or "-CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-," where n is 3 to 3000, and the terminal groups and architecture of the overall PEG may vary. "PEG" means a polymer that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of subunits that are -CH2CH2O-.<br>
[0021]	One commonly employed PEG is end-capped PEG. When PEG is<br>
defined as "-O(CH2CH2O)n-," the end-capping group is generally a carbon-containing group typically comprised of 1-20 carbons and is preferably alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl or benzyl) although saturated and unsaturated forms thereof, as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and substituted forms of any of the foregoing are also envisioned. When PEG is defined as "-CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)„-CH2CH2-," the end-capping group is generally a carbon-containing group typically comprised of 1-20 carbon atoms and an oxygen atom that is covalently bonded to the group and is available for covalently bonding to one terminus of the PEG. In this case, the group is typically, alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy or benzyloxy) and with respect to the carbon-<br>
containing group can optionally be saturated and unsaturated, as well as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and substituted forms of any of the foregoing. The other ("non-end-capped") terminus is a typically hydroxyl, amine or an activated group that can be subjected to further chemical modification when PEG is defined as "-CH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)„-CH2CH2-." In addition, the end-capping group can also be a silane.<br>
[0022]	Specific PEG forms for use in the invention include PEGs having a<br>
variety of molecular weights, structures or geometries (e.g., branched, linear,<br>
multiarm, and the like), to be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0023]	The end-capping group can also advantageously comprise a detectable<br>
label. When the polymer has an end-capping group comprising a detectable label, the amount or location of the polymer and/or the moiety (e.g., active agent) of interest to which the polymer is coupled can be determined by using a suitable detector. Such labels include, without limitation, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, colorimetric (e.g., dyes), metal ions, radioactive moieties, and the like.<br>
[0024]	The polymers used in the methods described herein are typically<br>
polydisperse (i.e., number average molecular weight and weight average molecular<br>
weight of the polymers are not equal). The polymers prepared in accordance with the<br>
methods described herein, however, possess low polydispersity values -- expressed as<br>
a ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight<br>
(Mn), (Mw/Mn) — of generally less than about 1.2, preferably less than about 1.15,<br>
more preferably less than about 1.10, still more preferably less than about 1.05, yet<br>
still most preferably less than about 1.03, and most preferably less than about 1.025.<br>
[0025]	As used herein, the term "ionizable functional group" and variations<br>
thereof is a functional group that may gain or lose a proton by interaction with another ionizable species of functional group in aqueous or other polar media. Ionizable functional groups include, but are not limited to, amine, carboxylic acids, aldehyde hydrates, ketone hydrates, amides, hydrazines, thiols, phenols, oximes,<br>
dithiopyridines, and vinylpyridines.<br>
[0026]	As used herein, the term "carboxylic acid" is a moiety having a — C-OH<br>
functional group [also represented as a "-COOH" or -C(O)OH], as well as moieties that are derivatives of a carboxylic acid, such derivatives including, for example,<br>
protected carboxylic acids. Thus, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, the<br>
term carboxylic acid includes not only the acid form, but corresponding esters and<br>
protected forms as well. Reference is made to Greene et al, "PROTECTIVE GROUPS IN<br>
ORGANIC SYNTHESIS" 3rd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1999.<br>
[0027]	"Activated carboxylic acid" means a functional derivative of a<br>
carboxylic acid that is more reactive than the parent carboxylic acid, in particular,<br>
with respect to nucleophilic acyl substitution. Activated carboxylic acids include but<br>
are not limited to acid halides (such as acid chlorides), anhydrides, amides and esters.<br>
[0028]	The term "reactive" or "activated", when used in conjunction with a<br>
particular functional group, refers to a reactive functional group that reacts readily with an electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e., a "nonreactive" or "inert" group).<br>
[0029]	The terms "protected" or "protecting group" or "protective group" refer<br>
to the presence of a moiety (i.e., the protecting group) that prevents or blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending upon the type of chemically reactive group being protected as well as the reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule, if any. Protecting groups known in the art can be found in Greene et al., supra.<br>
[0030]	As used herein, the term "functional group" or any synonym thereof is<br>
meant to encompass protected forms thereof.<br>
[0031]	The term "spacer" or "spacer moiety" is used herein to refer to an atom<br>
or a collection of atoms optionally used to link interconnecting moieties such as a terminus of a water-soluble polymer and a functional group. The spacer moieties of the invention may be hydrolytically stable or may include a physiologically hydrolyzable or enzymatically degradable linkage.<br>
[0032]	"Alkyl" refers to a hydrocarbon chain, typically ranging from about 1<br>
to 20 atoms in length. Such hydrocarbon chains are preferably but not necessarily saturated and may be branched or straight chain, although typically straight chain is preferred. Exemplary alkyl groups include ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 1-methylbutyl,<br>
1-ethylpropyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like. As used herein, "alkyl" includes<br>
cycloalkyl when alkyl can include three or more carbon atoms .<br>
[0033]	"Lower alkyl" refers to an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms, and may be straight chain or branched, as exemplified by methyl, ethyl, n-<br>
butyl, iso-butyl, tert-buty\.<br>
[0034]	"Cycloalkyl" refers to a saturated or unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon<br>
chain, including bridged, fused, or spiro cyclic compounds, preferably made up of 3<br>
to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 3 to about 8.<br>
[0035]	"Non-interfering substituents" are those groups that, when present in a<br>
molecule, are typically non-reactive with other functional groups contained within the<br>
molecule.<br>
[0036]	The term "substituted" as in, for example, "substituted alkyl," refers to<br>
a moiety (e.g., an alkyl group) substituted with one or more non-interfering<br>
substituents, such as, but not limited to: C3-C8 cycloalkyl, e.g., cyclopropyl,<br>
cyclobutyl, and the like; halo, e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo; cyano; alkoxy,<br>
lower phenyl (e.g., 0-2 substituted phenyl); substituted phenyl; and the like.<br>
[0037]	"Substituted aryl" is aryl having one or more non-interfering groups as<br>
a substituent. For substitutions on a phenyl ring, the substituents may be in any<br>
orientation (i.e., ortho, meta, or para).<br>
[0038]	"Alkoxy" refers to an -O-R group, wherein R is alkyl or substituted<br>
alkyl, preferably C1-C20 alkyl (e.g., mefhoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, benzyloxy, etc.),<br>
more preferably C1-C8 alkyl.<br>
[0039]	"Aryl" means one or more aromatic rings, each of 5 or 6 core carbon<br>
atoms. Aryl includes multiple aryl rings that may be fused, as in naphthyl or unfused,<br>
as in biphenyl. Aryl rings may also be fused or unfused with one or more cyclic<br>
hydrocarbon, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic rings. As used herein, "aryl" includes<br>
heteroaryl.<br>
[0040]	"Heteroaryl" is an aryl. group containing from one to four heteroatoms,<br>
preferably N, O, or S, or a combination thereof. Heteroaryl rings may also be fused<br>
with one or more cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic, aryl, or heteroaryl rings.<br>
[0041]	"Electrophile" refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms, that may<br>
be ionic, having an electrophilic center, i.e., a center that is electron seeking or<br>
capable of reacting with a nucleophile.<br>
 [0042]	"Nucleophile" refers to an ion or atom or collection of atoms, that may<br>
be ionic, having a nucleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an electrophilic center or capable of reacting with an electrophile.<br>
[0043]	A linkage that is "cleavable in vivo" refers to linkages capable of being<br>
cleaved while in circulation in vivo by a hydrolytic process, an enzymatic process, a<br>
chemical process, or a combination of such processes. In other words, linkages that<br>
are cleavable in vivo are those linkages that can break apart under physiological<br>
conditions (i.e., at about pH 7 to 7.5 and temperature of about 37°C in the presence of<br>
serum or other body fluids). The degradation half-life of the linkage can vary, but is<br>
typically in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 days under physiologic conditions.<br>
[0044]	A "hydrolytically cleavable" or "hydrolyzable" or "hydrolytically<br>
degradable" bond is a relatively weak bond that reacts with water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under physiological conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water will depend not only on the general type of linkage connecting two central atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central atoms. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable or weak linkages include, but are not limited to, carboxylate ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxyalkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, and oligonucleotides.<br>
[0045]	An "enzymatically degradable linkage" means a linkage that is subject<br>
to degradation by one or more enzymes under physiological conditions. The enzymatic degradation process may also include a hydrolysis reaction. Enzymatically degradable linkages can include certain amide (-C(O)-NH-) and urethane (-O-C(O)-NH-) linkages, especially when in a proximate arrangement with other groups of atoms that may provide either activation for degradation or additional sites needed for attraction of an enzyme. For example, a urethane in proximate location with certain amides, e.g. -O-C(O)-NH-CHY-C(O)-NH-Y', where Y is H, alkyl, substituted alkyl (e.g., arylalkyl, hydroxylalkyl, thioalkyl, etc.), or aryl, and Y' is alkyl or substituted alkyl, are enzymatically degradable. As defined herein, "urethane" linkages are inclusive of linkages having the above structure.<br>
[0046]	A "chemically degradable" linkage as used herein is a linkage that<br>
degrades through chemical reaction under physiologic conditions in vivo. For example, disulfide (-S-S-) bonds can be degraded in vivo through chemical reaction with glutathione.<br>
 [0047]	A "hydrolytically stable" or "non-degradable" linkage or bond refers to<br>
a chemical bond, typically a covalent bond, that is substantially stable in water,<br>
meaning it does not undergo hydrolytic or enzymatic cleavage under physiological<br>
conditions to any appreciable extent over an extended period of time. Examples of<br>
hydrolytically stable linkages include but are not limited to the following: carbon-<br>
carbon bonds (e.g., in aliphatic chains), ethers, and the like. Generally, a<br>
hydrolytically stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of hydrolysis of less than about<br>
1-2% per day under physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative<br>
chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry textbooks.<br>
[0048]	"Multifunctional" or "multisubstituted" in the context of a polymer or<br>
polyol means a polymer or polyol having 2 or more functional groups contained therein, where the functional groups may be the same or different. Multifunctional polymers or polyols of the invention will typically contain a number of functional groups satisfying one or more of the following ranges: from about 2-100 functional groups, from 2-50 functional groups, from 2-25 functional groups, from 2-15 functional groups, from 3 to 10 functional groups. Thus, the number of functional groups in the polymer backbone or polyol can be any one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 functional groups.<br>
[0049]	A "difunctional" or "disubstituted" polymer or polyol means a polymer<br>
or polyol having two functional groups contained therein, either the same (i.e., homodifunctional) or different (i.e., heterodifunctional).<br>
[0050]	A "monofunctional" or "monosubstituted" polymer means a polymer<br>
having a single functional group contained therein (e.g., an mPEG based polymer).<br>
[0051]	A basic or acidic reactant described herein includes neutral, charged,<br>
and any corresponding salt forms thereof.<br>
[0052]	The term "patient," refers to a living organism suffering from or prone<br>
to a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of a conjugate, and<br>
includes both humans and animals.<br>
[0053]	"Optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described<br>
circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where<br>
the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.<br>
 [0054]	Unless otherwise noted, molecular weight is expressed herein as<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
number average molecular weight (Mn), which is defined aswherein Ni is<br>
the number of polymer molecules (or the number of moles of those molecules) having molecular weight Mi.<br>
[0055]	Each of the terms "drug," "biologically active molecule," "biologically<br>
active moiety," "active agent" and "biologically active agent", when used herein, means any substance which can affect any physical or biochemical property of a biological organism, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, and humans. In particular, as used herein, biologically active molecules include any substance intended for diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals, or to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being of humans or animals. Examples of biologically active molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, proteins, enzymes, small molecule drugs, dyes, lipids, nucleosides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, nucleic acids, cells, viruses, liposomes, microparticles and micelles. Classes of biologically active agents that are suitable for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, antibiotics, fungicides, anti-viral agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-tumor agents, cardiovascular agents, anti-anxiety agents, hormones, growth factors, steroidal agents, and the like.<br>
[0056]	As used herein, "non-peptidic" refers to a polymer backbone<br>
substantially free of peptide linkages. However, the polymer backbone may include a<br>
minor number of peptide linkages spaced along the length of the backbone, such as,<br>
for example, no more than about 1 peptide linkage per about 50 monomer units.<br>
[0057]	The term "conjugate" is intended to refer to the entity formed as a<br>
result of covalent attachment of a molecule, e.g., a biologically active molecule, to a reactive polymer molecule, preferably a poly(ethylene glycol) bearing one or more reactive groups.<br>
II. Segmented. Degradable Polymers and Conjugates Made Therefrom<br>
[0058]	In one aspect, the present invention provides a polymeric reagent, and<br>
conjugates with biologically active agents made using the polymeric reagent, characterized by the presence of one or more cleavable or degradable linkages that degrade in vivo. The degradable linkage or linkages are spaced along the polymer<br>
chain or within a central core molecule such that each segment of polymeric reagent<br>
that is released upon degradation of the linkage in vivo has a molecular weight that<br>
does not impede renal clearance of the segment. The polymeric reagents of the<br>
present invention are particularly advantageous in that they can be used to prepare<br>
conjugates where both a relatively high polymer molecular weight is desired along<br>
with substantially complete elimination of the polymer from the body. For example,<br>
the total polymer number average molecular weight for the polymeric reagent (and the<br>
conjugate prepared therefrom) is typically at least about 30,000 Da, such as a<br>
molecular weight of about 30,000 to about 150,000 Da (e.g., total molecular weights<br>
of about 30,000 Da, 35,000 Da, 40,000 Da, 45,000 Da, 50,000 Da, 55,000 Da, 60,000<br>
Da, 65,000 Da, 70,000 Da, and the like). The number average molecular weight of<br>
each polymer segment released upon degradation of the degradable linkages is<br>
preferably less than or equal to about 22,000 Da, more preferably less than or equal to<br>
about 20,000 Da, even more preferably less than or equal to about 15,000 Da, and<br>
most preferably less than or equal to about 8,000 Da. In some embodiments, the<br>
polymer segments have a molecular weight of no more than about 5,000 Da, or no<br>
more than about 2,500 Da. The number of polymer segments resulting from cleavage<br>
of the degradable linkages can vary from 2 to about 40, but is generally in the range of<br>
2 to about 10 (e.g., 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 polymer segments).<br>
[0059]	The structural configuration of the polymeric reagents (and the<br>
conjugates prepared therefrom) of the invention can vary. The polymeric reagents can have a substantially linear form. The polymer can also have a branched structure characterized by a single reactive site for conjugation to an active agent and two polymer arms covalently attached to the reactive site through a linking group. In yet another embodiment of a branched polymer form, the polymeric reagent of the invention can have a "multiarm" configuration comprising two or more (preferably three or more) polymer arms extending from a common multifunctional core molecule, such as a polyol or dipeptide. Preferred embodiments of the polymers of the invention are not in the form of a hydrogel, meaning the polymeric reagents (and the conjugates prepared therefrom) are not crosslinked to a substantial degree with other polymers in a water-swellable matrix.<br>
[0060]	The degradable linkages within the polymeric reagents (and the<br>
conjugates prepared therefrom) can vary. It is preferable to use degradable linkages<br>
cleavable in vivo, and having a half-life of between about 0.1 and about 10 days under physiological conditions (i.e., at a pH of 7-7.5 and a temperature of about 37°C). The rate of degradation of a linkage can be measured by analytical determination of liberated polymer segments using gas permeation chromatography ("GPC"). Although the polymeric reagents of the invention can include one or more carbonate groups as a degradable linkage, it is preferable for the polymeric reagents to comprise at least one degradable linkage that does not include a carbonate group, and polymeric reagents without any carbonate groups are contemplated.<br>
[0061]	Exemplary degradable linkages include, but are not limited to, ester<br>
linkages; carbonate linkages; carbamates; imides; disulfides; di-, tri-, or tetrapeptides; imine linkages resulting, for example, from reaction, of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e.g., Ouchi et al., Polymer Preprints, 38(l):582-3 (1997), which is incorporated herein by reference.); phosphate ester linkages formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are typically formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are typically formed by reaction between an aldehyde and an alcohol; ortho ester linkages that are, for example, formed by reaction between a formate and an alcohol; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by, for example, a phosphoramidite group, e.g., at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.<br>
[0062]	Amide or urethane bonds are generally considered stable groups for<br>
binding PEGs to proteins such as interferon, e.g., K. R. Reddy, M. W. Modi and S. Pedder, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 54 (2002) 571-586. Some cleavage of these stable groups, however, may occur in vivo. For example, in a PEG interferon (marketed under the "PEGASYS®" brand), up to 30% of the PEG associated with the conjugate is cleared by cleavage of a urethane bond (see M. W. Modi, J. S. Fulton, D. K. Buckmann, T. L. Wright, D. J. Moore, "Clearance of pegylated (40kDa) interferon alpha-2a (PEGASYS) is primarily hepatic, Hepatology, 32 (2000) 371A). The mechanism for the overall clearance of the conjugate is fairly slow and takes several days.<br>
[0063]	With respect to amide bounds, there are special cases where amide<br>
bonds, such as those found in peptide linkages, are susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. Suzawa et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 8 (8) 2000, 2175-84) found that a polyethylene glycol) bound L-alanine-valine di-peptide linkage cleaved in the presence of the<br>
model enzyme thermolysin. Additional examples of peptide linkages (e.g., di-peptide<br>
or tri-peptide linkages) that may find use in the present invention can be found in U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 5,286,637 and 6,103,236; Goff and Carroll (Bioconjugate Chem. 1990, 1,<br>
381-386); and Huang et al. (Bioconjugate Chem. 1998, 9, 612-617). Thus, in certain<br>
embodiments, the degradable linkage(s) contained within the polymeric reagents (and<br>
the conjugates formed therefrom) can include amide or urethane linkages.<br>
[0064]	Esters, though more susceptible than amides and urethanes to<br>
hydrolytic cleavage, are also readily cleaved by enzymatic processes, thus making esters especially labile linkages in vivo. Esters are more resistant to enzymatic cleavage if they have groups in the vicinity of the functional group that sterically block the approach of an enzyme. Hence, including this type of sterically hindered ester function may cause an ester group to be an attractive linker for applications where it is desirable for the polymer to break down hydrolytically or enzymatically in a few hours to a few days.<br>
[0065]	The groups that best facilitate stability through steric hindrance are<br>
groups (e.g., alkyl groups) located at the position alpha to the carbonyl carbon of the ester, as is the case with the two ester-containing polymers below (wherein "POLY" is a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer). In selecting a structure to present a steric hindrance to enzymatic cleavage, it is preferred to not include a group that has an electron withdrawing effect on the carbonyl group. While not wishing to be bound by theory, such electron withdrawing groups would tend to accelerate acid- or base-catalyzed hydrolysis.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0066]	Steric hindrance in the alkyl portion (e.g., the portion or atoms<br>
proximal to the oxygen atom, which, in turn, is attached to the carbonyl carbon) of the ester may also slow enzymatic cleavage of esters. Thus, when steric hindrance is desired to influence the rate of enzymatic cleavage, it is contemplated to add steric<br>
hindrance at the alpha and/or beta positions relative to the carbonyl carbon and/or the oxygen atom, which, in turn, is attached to the carbonyl carbon of the ester group. It is important, however, to add a combination of steric crowding and electron donation so as to facilitate electrophilic cleavage of the ester by a SN1 pathway. Further, it is important to not make the alkyl portion such a good leaving group, by substitution of electron withdrawing groups, that base catalyzed hydrolysis is favorable. A balance can be achieved by the introduction of mild steric retardation at the alpha and beta positions of the oxygen atom, which, in turn, is attached to the carbonyl carbon of the ester group, as shown in the structure below.<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein L is a spacer moiety or a linkage resulting from reaction of POLY .with an<br>
ester-containing moiety and POLY is a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymer.<br>
[0067]	Thus, preferred steric hindering groups include alkyl groups (e.g., Cl-<br>
C10 alkyl groups) or aryl groups (e.g., C6-C10 aryl groups) positioned adjacent to the carbonyl carbon and/or adjacent to the oxygen atom attached to the carbonyl group of the ester (i.e., at the alpha or beta positions), and most preferably adjacent to the carbonyl carbon.<br>
[0068]	It is possible to determine whether any given proposed group is suited<br>
for providing the desired steric hindrance by preparing the polymeric reagent with the proposed group. Following formation of the conjugate from the proposed polymeric reagent, the conjugate is subsequently administered the conjugate to a patient or added to a suitable model. Following administration to the patient (or addition to the suitable model), the degradative rate for each degradable linkage within the conjugate can be determined by, for example, taking a blood sample (or aliquot of liquid from the suitable model) and identifying degradative components of the conjugate through chromatographic techniques. The proposed group is suited for providing the desired steric hindrance if the overall degradation rate falls within a desired range and/or is improved over a control polymeric reagent tested under the same conditions.<br>
 [0069]	The water-soluble and non-peptidic polymers (e.g., POLY1, POLY2,<br>
and so forth) that make up part of the polymeric reagents of the present invention should be non-toxic and biocompatible, meaning that the polymer is capable of coexistence with living tissues or organisms without causing harm. It is to be understood that the polymer can be any of a number of water-soluble and non-peptidic polymers. Preferably, poly(ethylene glycol) (i.e., PEG) is the polymer used to form the polymeric reagents described herein. Examples of other suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, other poly(alkylene glycols), copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, poly(olefinic alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(a-hydroxy acid), poly(acrylic acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, polyoxazoline, poly(N-acryloylmorpholine), such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,629,384, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and copolymers, terpolymers, and mixtures thereof. Different polymers can be incorporated into the same polymer backbone. Any combination of water soluble and non-peptidic polymers is encompassed within the present invention. Each polymer segment (e.g., each POLY1 or POLY2) can also comprise two or more polymer segments connected by cleavable or stable linkages.<br>
[0070]	The polymers can be in substantially linear form or a multiarm or<br>
branched form, such as the branched PEG molecules set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,932,462, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Generally speaking, a multiarmed or branched polymer possesses two or more polymer "arms" extending from a central branch point. For example, an exemplary branched PEG polymer has the structure: <br>
wherein PEG1 and PEG2 are PEG polymers in any of the forms or geometries described herein, and which can be the same or different, and L' is a hydrolytically stable linkage. An exemplary branched PEG of Formula I has the structure:<br>
wherein: polya and polyb are PEG backbones, such as methoxy poly(ethylene glycol); R" is a nonreactive moiety, such as H, methyl or a PEG backbone; and P and Q are nonreactive linkages. In a preferred embodiment, the branched PEG polymer is methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) disubstituted lysine.<br>
[0071]	The branched PEG structure of Formula IV can be attached to a third<br>
oligomer or polymer chain as shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0072]	wherein PEG3 is a third PEG oligomer or polymer chain, which can be<br>
the same or different from PEG] and PEG2.<br>
[0073]	In another embodiment, the branched PEG used in the invention has<br>
the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein each POLY is a water-soluble and non-peptidic polymeric or oligomeric<br>
segment (e.g., a PEG segment), and each Z is a capping group or a functional group.<br>
[0074]	As evidenced in the exemplary polymeric structures below, the<br>
polymeric reagents of the invention will typically include one or more functional groups suitable for reaction with a complementary functional group on a biologically active agent in order to form a covalent linkage (which can optionally be cleavable in vivo) between the polymeric reagent and the active agent. Examples of suitable functional groups include hydroxyl, active ester (e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester and 1-benzotriazolyl ester), active carbonate (e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbonate, 1-benzotriazolyl carbonate, and p-nitrophenyl carbonate), acetal, aldehyde having a<br>
carbon length of 1 to 25 carbons (e.g., acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and butyraldehyde), aldehyde hydrate, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, amine, hydrazide, thiol, alkanoic acids having a carbon length (including the carbonyl carbon) of 1 to about 25 carbon atoms (e.g., carboxylic acid, carboxymethyl, propanoic acid, andbutanoic acid), acid halide, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxal, dione, mesylate, tosylate, and tresylate.

The spacer moiety may also comprise an ethylene oxide oligomer/polymer chain comprising 1 to 25 ethylene oxide monomer units [i.e., -(CH2CH2O)1-25], either in addition to the above-described spacer moieties or in lieu thereof. When used in addition to another spacer moiety, the ethylene oxide oligomer chain can occur before or after the spacer moiety, and optionally in between any two atoms of a spacer moiety comprised of two or more atoms.<br>

The reactive sites comprise terminal functional groups available for reaction with functionalized polymeric segments, and may include more than one type of functional group. For instance, certain di- or tri-peptide core molecules will comprise both one or more carboxylic acid groups and one or more amine groups. As noted above, the R core molecule can be a combination of a polypeptide (e.g., di- or tri-peptide) or disulfide with a polyol to form a multiarm core molecule to which polymer arms can be attached at the site of the hydroxyl groups of the polyol and/or at the site of any free reactive groups on the polypeptide or disulfide. A core molecule of this type is set forth in Reaction Scheme VII below. Note that the R core molecule does not have to be preformed prior to attachment of the polymer arms. Instead, the core molecule<br>
can be created after polymer arms have been attached to one of the components that<br>
will form the ultimate core molecule. For example, as set forth in Reaction Scheme<br>
VII, polymer arms can be attached to a polyol molecule prior to attachment of two<br>
polymer-modified polyol molecules together through a disulfide or di-peptide linker.<br>
[0099]	A polyol used as the core molecule comprises a plurality of available<br>
hydroxyl groups. Depending on the desired number of polymer arms, the polyol will<br>
typically comprise 3 to about 25 hydroxyl groups, preferably about 3 to about 22<br>
hydroxyl groups, most preferably about 5 to about 12 hydroxyl groups. Although the<br>
spacing between hydroxyl groups will vary from polyol to polyol, there are typically 1<br>
to about 20 atoms, such as carbon atoms, between each hydroxyl group, preferably 1<br>
to about 5. The particular polyol chosen will depend on the desired number of<br>
hydroxyl groups needed as attachment sites for the polymer arms. The weight<br>
average molecular weight of the polyol starting material is typically between about<br>
100 to about 2,000 Da. The polyol typically has a branched structure, meaning one or<br>
more carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon core structure of the polyol are covalently<br>
attached to three or four atoms selected from carbon atoms and ether-linked oxygen<br>
atoms (i.e., oxygen atoms attached to two carbon atoms).<br>
[00100]	Preferred polyols for use as the core molecule include glycerol<br>
oligomers or polymers such as hexaglycerol, pentaerythritol and oligomers or polymers thereof (e.g., dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, and tetrapentaerythritol), and sugar-derived alcohols such as sorbitol, arabanitol, and mannitol. Also, many commercially available polyols containing ionizable groups, such as 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (TRIS), 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3 -propanediol, {[2-hydroxy-1,1-<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}acetic acid (Tricine), 2-[(3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}propyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, 2-{[2-hydroxy-l,l-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid (TES), 4-{[2-hydroxy-l,l-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethy]]amino}-l-butanesulfonic acid, and 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l ,3-propanediol hydrochloride are appropriate starting materials. Typically, polymeric polyols used in the present invention will comprise no more than about 25 monomer units. The structures of dipentaerythritol and tripentaerythritol are provided below along with one of the structures possible for hexaglycerol.<br>

 [00101]	Hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin, which has 21 available hydroxyl<br>
groups, is another exemplary polyol. Yet another exemplary polyol is a hyperbranched polyglycerol available from Hyperpolymers GmbH of Freiburg, Germany, which is shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00102]	The polyol may include PEG oligomer or polymer segments attached<br>
to the polyol core. The polyol starting material is typically in the form of a mixture of products, such as a mixture of polyol oligomers or polymers of different molecular<br>
weights or a mixture of ethoxylated polyol structures of different molecule weight, possibly further comprising a residual amount of the original polyol monomeric unit, such as glycerol. However, at least one of the polyols in the starting mixture is typically a branched polyol having at least three available hydroxyl groups according to the formula R(OH)p, wherein R is a branched hydrocarbon, optionally including one or more ether linkages, and p is at least 3, typically 3 to about 25, and preferably 3 to about 10.<br>
[00103]	Polyols having closely-spaced hydroxyl groups are particularly<br>
preferred in certain embodiments of the invention, which facilitate use of cyclic acetal or ketal groups as hydroxyl-protecting groups. A spacing of two or three carbon atoms between hydroxyl groups within the polyol structure enables the formation of certain preferred heterocyclic protecting groups. For example, the close spacing between hydroxyl groups of pentaerythritol oligomers or polymers enable the formation of cyclic acetal or ketal groups using techniques known in the art. The cyclic acetal or ketal groups can be formed by reacting the polyol with an aldehyde reagent, such as a reagent having the formula R'-CHO, wherein R' is alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, or substituted aryl, or a ketone reagent (e.g., cyclohexanone). An exemplary aldehyde reagent is benzaldehyde. Using a pentaerythritol oligomer or polymer core as an example, the structure resulting from the reaction with an aldehyde reagent is shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00104]	By placing a majority of the hydroxyl groups of the polyol in a<br>
protected form, the polyol core can be reacted with a reagent comprising the ionizable functional group, Z3, to produce a plurality of products differentiated by the number of Z3 groups present therein. Typically, the reaction will produce a<br>
monofunctionalized product, a difunctionalized product, and residual unreacted<br>
polyol. An ion exchange chromatography system can be used to separate each<br>
product fraction based on difference in charge, thereby allowing purification of the<br>
desired monofunctional product. A process for purifying PEG polymer species based<br>
on charge differences is set forth in U.S. Patent Application Publication No.<br>

[00107]	In certain embodiments of Formula (IIIa), each POLY1 is a<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) polymer, and R is a disulfide linker, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, or<br>
a tetrapeptide, which means the R moiety will include at least one disulfide bond<br>
(from the disulfide linker) or amide bond (e.g., the linkage between peptide residues).<br>
Preferred R groups include those comprising at least one lysine residue. Suitable<br>
disulfide linkers include various linkers comprising an -S-S- bond and a total of 4-25<br>
atoms in chain length, and preferred disulfide molecules have 4-8 functional groups<br>
available for attachment of polymer segments.<br>
[00108]	In certain embodiments of Formula (IIIa), each POLY1 and POLY2 is a<br>
branched poly(ethylene glycol) polymer.<br>
[00109]	Polymeric reagent of Formula (IIIa) can comprise R moeities derived<br>
from a disulfide molecule having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
 [00110]	In certain embodiments of Formula (IIIa), each POLY1 comprises two<br>
or more poly(ethylene glycol) segments linked by a linkage that is cleavable in vivo (e.g., amide linkages, urethane linkages, disulfide linkages, dipeptide linkages, tripeptide linkages, and tetrapeptide linkages), A is -(X8)h-(L6)j-(X9)i-POLY2-Z3, POLY2 is a poly(ethylene glycol) polymer, and R is derived from a polyol.<br>
 [00111]	In further embodiments of Formula (IIIa), each POLY1 comprises a<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) polymer, A is absent, and R is comprises at least one peptide residue.   The R moiety may further comprise a disulfide bond. In certain embodiments, R comprises at least two lysine residues linked by amide linkages to a linker selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic carbon chain, an aliphatic carbon chain comprising a disulfide bond, and a poly(ethylene glycol) oligomer (e.g., an oligomer having from 1-25 monomer units).<br>
[00112]	In still further embodiments of Formula (IIIa), each POLY1 comprises<br>
a poly(ethylene glycol) polymer, A is absent, and R comprises a non-peptidic moiety<br>
comprising at least one disulfide bond and at least two amide bonds. By "non-<br>
peptidic" is meant that the R molecule does not include a peptide residue (i.e., the<br>
amide and disulfide bonds are not part of a peptide molecule). In this manner, R core<br>
molecules can be used that mimic peptidic molecules in structure due to inclusion of<br>
amide linkages, but which are not technically peptidic in nature.<br>
[00113]	Two examples of multiarm polymers of the invention that include core<br>
molecules having portions that are non-peptidic in nature, but which include amide linkages in a particular proximity to a urethane linkage, are shown below. As illustrated in these exemplary structures, the central portion of the core molecule includes amide linkages in a particular proximity to a urethane linkage. The outer branched portion of the core molecules shown below can be derived from peptidic molecules, such as lysine residues. Polyl and Poly2 below can have the same definition as set forth for POLY1 in Formula (IIIa). L1 and L2 in these exemplary structures can represent spacer moieties, such as X2 in Formula (IIIa). The value of n will depend on the desired molecular weight of the PEG segment, but typically ranges from 1-25. Such core molecules can be prepared by reacting a diamine linker, such as H2N-(CH2)4-NH2 or H2N-(OCH2CH2)n-NH2, with two lysine residues. The available functional groups of the lysine residues can then be reacted with polymer reagents to form the final polymer molecule.<br>

[00116]	One exemplary multiarm polymeric reagent of the invention has the<br>
structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
which corresponds to a polymeric reagent of Formula (IIIa) wherein p is 2 and each<br>
POLY1 is a multiarm polymer. The terminal hydroxyl groups could be replaced with<br>
other functional groups without departing from the invention.<br>
[00117]	Another multiarm polymeric reagent of the invention is exemplified<br>
below. The multiarm reagent shown has a di-lysine core and three polymer arms. The peptide linkage in the molecule is susceptible to cleavage by some enzymes known to those of ordinary skill in the art (such as mammalian subtilisin-like serine endoproteasePC2, see Eskeland et al. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 98(1):148-156), thus making it labile under certain in vivo conditions. In Reaction Scheme I below, mPEG-BTC is reacted with the dipeptide to form a polymer with an active carboxylic acid unit that can be used to purify the polymer by ion exchange chromatography.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [00118]	A similar example where a branched or multiarm polymer replaces the<br>
linear polymers utilized above is set forth below as Reaction Scheme II. Again, cleavage of the degradable dipeptide linkage would yield two fragments that could be,<br>
 <br>
depending on the size of the active (drug) component, about half the size of the original conjugate.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [00119]	Using methods similar to those described above, a disulfide linker can<br>
be used instead of the dipeptide linker. The disulfide bond is labile in the presence of certain enzymes and hence provides a degradable bond that can assist drug and/or polymer clearance. A method of synthesis of such a molecule is shown below in Reaction Scheme III below.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [00120]	Conjugates of the above-described multiarm polymers are also<br>
provided by the invention, such as conjugates having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein:<br>
B is A, -(XV(L6)j-(X9)i-POLY2-L9-Drug or -(X8)h-(L7)j-(X9)i-L9-Drug;<br>
each D, which may be the same or different, is Z1 or L8-Drug;<br>
L8 and L9, which can be the same or different, are linkages wherein the linkages are optionally cleavable in vivo;<br>
Drug is a residue of a biologically active agent;<br>
each X1, X2, X3, X8, X9, L3, L6, L7, A, Z1, a, b, c, h, i, j and p is as previously defined with respect to Formula (IIIa). Typically, L8 and L9 are formed<br>
from the reaction of a functional group (Z1 and Z3, respectively) of a polymer of Formula (IIIa) with a biologically active agent..<br>
[00121]	An exemplary conjugate of the invention is shown below, the<br>
conjugate resulting from reaction of a polypeptide active agent with an exemplary polymeric reagent comprising a degradable amide bond. The polymeric reagent conjugated to a drug molecule. The significance of the degradable amide linker becomes clear when the molecular weight of the PEG units is relatively high. If the molecular weight of each PEG segment is 20,000 Daltons, then the polymer would have a molecular weight slightly over 60,000 Daltons. If a polypeptide having a molecular weight of 8,000 Daltons is added to make the conjugate (shown below to be conjugate through a thiol group to a maleimide of the polymer), the final molecular weight of the polymer is now over 68,000 Daltons. Clearance of a molecule of this size is very problematic and would typically not be administered. By way of one embodiment described herein, however, it is possible to demonstrate an advantage of the present invention.<br>
[00122]	For example, a conjugate as shown below (as prepared from a<br>
polymeric reagent as described herein), can cleave at the peptide bond in the center of the dipeptide (as shown below with the dotted line), fragments of the conjugate having molecular weights of about 40,000 Daltons and 28,000 Daltons would result. Thus, the clearance of this drug product is enhanced by the presence of the degradable linkage.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00123]	Another exemplary reaction scheme to produce a multiarm conjugate<br>
of the invention is set forth below as Reaction Scheme IV. As shown, a drug<br>
molecule with an available amine group is reacted with a multiarm polymeric reagent featuring a labile disulfide linkage in the core molecule.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [00124]	The following reaction scheme, designated Reaction Scheme V,<br>
provides an additional example of a manner in which the present invention can provide a degradable conjugate structure. An active polymer group comprising a protected ester group is added to one of the arms of the core polymeric molecule. Thereafter, a degradable linker, in this case a dipeptide linker, is added to three of the polymer arms of the multiarm core. Then, ester hydrolysis frees the carboxylic acid groups for purification by chromatography. Subsequently, processes are carried out to allow activation of all four arms by addition of functional groups to which the drug molecule can be attached (e.g., NHS esters), which can also be further functionalized<br>
Reaction Scheme V<br>
[00125]	The molecular weights of the various polymeric segments could be<br>
variable to make construction of the molecule practical, while at the same time giving<br>
a final overall molecular weight practical for drug delivery. Thus, the smaller PEG<br>
linkers of the core molecule (i.e., represented by n in Reaction Scheme V) are<br>
typically short linkers. The main chain PEG linker (i.e., represented by m in Reaction<br>
Scheme V) is generally a large polymer chain by comparison.<br>
[00126]	Following reaction with a drug molecule at each terminus of the<br>
polymeric reagent above, the resulting conjugate can be represented as the following generic structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
where POLY1 - POLY3 are water-soluble and non-peptidic polymers as described above, L1, L2, and L3 are stable linkers, L4 is preferably a degradable linker that can release a drug molecule, and L5 is a hydrolytically or enzymatically degradable linkage that allows molecular breakdown of the conjugate into smaller polymeric segments.<br>
[00127]	Thus the overall process would ultimately lead to the following<br>
components remaining for clearance according to the cleavage reaction shown below as Reaction Scheme VI. The new groups, G1, G2, and G3, are new end groups resulting from cleavage of the degradable linkers.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00128]	The overall result of the above reaction is to provide a multiarm<br>
polymer that breaks down following drug delivery into components that include the multiarm core and several smaller polymeric units that are substantially linear. Thus, this method avoids clearance of a highly globular multiarm polymer that may resist renal clearance.<br>
 [00129]	In another exemplary embodiment of a multiarm polymer, a four-arm<br>
reagent useful for drug delivery is described below in Reaction Scheme VII. The synthesis has several points where intermediates may be purified using ion exchange chromatography.   In a first step, a commercially available branched polyol featuring an ester group is reacted with disuccinimidyl carbonate to convert the hydroxyl groups to succinimidyl carbonate groups. In an optional second step, a relatively small PEG linker, which may be a commercially available mono-protected diamine, is reacted with the core molecule to form a core having two ethylene glycol oligomer/polymer spacers attached thereto with terminal protected amine groups (see Reaction Scheme VTf(a) below).<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
 [00130]	Deprotection of the BOC protecting groups and reaction with a mono-<br>
protected PEG-BTC leads to the formation of a branched PEG structure with urethane linkages between the PEG arms and the branching carbon atom (see Reaction Scheme VII(b) below). The polymer derivative can be purified by ion exchange chromatography either before or after attachment of the PEG-BTC molecules. Note that the branched PEG structures in VII(b) are encompassed by the branched polymer structures of Formula IIa. The number of ethylene glycol monomers, ml and m2, may vary. However, the ethylene glycol chain from the mono-protected diamine molecule typically has between about 2 and about 80 monomer units (i.e., ml is between about 2 and about 80), more preferably about 40 to about 80 monomer units.<br>
The second polymer chains attached in VII(b) below are typically longer, such as polymer chains comprising between about 100 and about 450 monomer units (i.e., m2 is about 100 to about 450), more preferably about 150 to about 250 monomer units.<br>
[00131]	Conversion of the acid to the N-hydroxysuccinimide active ester and<br>
coupling of the active ester to an aminoalkyl disulfide leads to a disulfide that has a four-arm structure, as shown below in Reaction Scheme VII(c). The R groups, which may be on any carbon of the linker containing the disulfide, can vary, but exemplary R groups include carboxylic acid and lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, and the like. Also, for purposes of enhanced purification, a carboxylic acid group can be removed from the linker by a spacer group, which serves to space the acid group from the core of the linker to allow for better binding to the chromatographic column. Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl groups to form hydroxyl groups occurs without reduction of the disulfide linkage.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
[00132]	Activation of the terminal hydroxyl groups of the product of VII(c)<br>
with disuccinimidyl carbonate forms active succinimidyl esters at the four termini of the polymer chains. The hydroxyl groups could also be converted to other functional groups known in the art. Thereafter, the activated multiarm polymer can be conjugated to drug molecules at the termini of each polymer chain. The resulting conjugate would be expected to undergo enzymatic disulfide cleavage over time to allow clearance of two molecules, each being essentially a branched PEG molecule with two PEG chains. An exemplary drug conjugate structure is shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[00133]	If a higher molecular weight of the final conjugate is desired, it may be<br>
necessary to provide sites for polymer cleavage in addition to the disulfide linkage of the above structure. For example, if one utilizes a PEG diamine of molecular weight 3,400 Daltons in the first reaction sequence above, the product diamine (still BOC protected) has a molecular weight of about 6,800 Daltons. If this is made into the same final structure shown above as a drug conjugate using a PEG-BTC fragment having a molecular weight of 10,000 Daltons, the final polymer would have a molecular weight exceeding 53,600 Daltons.<br>
[00134]	It may be beneficial to provide such a highly branched structure with<br>
additional points of degradation to allow clearance of the molecule during a reasonable timeframe. This could be achieved by adding a second enzymatically cleavable segment in the linking point of the two PEG segments of each arm. This is illustrated below in Reaction Scheme VIII using a dipeptide linker that is pre-attached to the PEG-BTC component before reaction to the diamine linker. Following the final steps of the synthesis, the reagent is obtained. The five points of ultimate polymer degradation are shown with dotted lines. Thus, if all of the enzymatic processes occurred prior to clearance, polymer segments of no larger than about 7,000 Daltons would clear. The R2 and R3 groups set forth below can be, for example, carboxy alkyl, alkyl, and the like.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00135]	As an option, the disulfide can contain an acid group for purification.<br>
For example, the di-peptide, cystine, can be used, which would provide two<br>
carboxylic acid groups for purification of the polymer at a later stage. Then the acid<br>
groups could optionally be activated to make a six-arm polymer.<br>
[00136]	Also, a di-, tri-, or tetrapeptide, optionally having a free carboxylic<br>
acid group, can be used instead of the disulfide for the main linker in the multiarm structure of Reaction Scheme VII and VIIL For example, an exemplary di-peptide linker could incorporate a glutamic acid residue and another amino acid (e.g., alanine shown below) that is further terminated with an amine group (e.g., tetraethylene diamine added to form amide with free amine group of alanine as shown below). An exemplary di-peptide (Glu-Ala coupled to tetraethylene diamine) is shown below.<br>
