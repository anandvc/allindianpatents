RADIALLY STACKED DUAL DRY CLUTCH CONFIGURATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention is drawn to a radially stacked dual dry clutch<br>
apparatus for a dual clutch transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	A dual clutch transmission, or DCT, generally implements one clutch for<br>
the odd numbered gear ratios, and a second clutch for the even numbered gear ratios such that there is no torque interruption during a ratio change. A "torque interruption" refers to a period during a ratio change wherein the engine is decoupled from the drivetrain so that there is no torque being transferred to the wheels.<br>
[0003]	The two clutches in a dual clutch transmission are typically either wet or<br>
dry clutches, and may be either axially stacked or radially stacked. Dry clutches may be more efficient and less expensive in some applications than a wet clutch. Radially stacked dual clutch transmissions offer packaging advantages over axially stacked dual clutch transmissions. As an example, vehicles requiring a short transmission, such as front wheel drive vehicles, cannot practically package an axially stacked dual clutch configuration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	The present invention provides a radially stacked dual dry clutch apparatus<br>
for a dual clutch transmission. The apparatus includes a housing, an outer clutch<br>
mounted to the housing, and an inner clutch mounted to the housing.<br>
[0005]	The outer clutch includes a first plurality of engageable clutch plates. A<br>
first return spring is operatively connected to one of the first plurality of clutch plates,<br>
and a hub is attached to another of the first plurality of clutch plates. The hub preferably<br>
defines a plurality of access ports. A first output shaft is configured to transfer the<br>
rotation of the hub to a first power path.<br><br>
2<br>
[00061	The inner clutch includes a second plurality of engageable clutch plates.<br>
A second return spring is operatively connected to one of the second plurality of clutch<br>
plates. The inner clutch also includes an apply member configured to selectively actuate<br>
the second plurality of clutch plates. At least a portion of the apply member is adapted to<br>
pass through the access ports of the hub. A second output shaft is configured to<br>
selectively transfer the rotation of the second plurality of clutch plates to a second power<br>
flow path.<br>
[0007]	According to one aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes a first<br>
thrust bearing operatively connected to the first apply spring, wherein the first thrust<br>
bearing is configured to facilitate the transfer of an axially applied force between<br>
components rotating at different rates.<br>
10008]	According to another aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes a<br>
first actuator adapted to apply an axial force to the first apply spring such that the first<br>
plurality of clutch plates are engaged.<br>
[0009]	According to yet another aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes a<br>
second actuator adapted to apply an axial force to the second apply spring such that the<br>
second plurality of clutch plates are engaged.<br>
[0010]	According to still another aspect of the invention, the apparatus includes a<br>
second thrust bearing disposed between the apply member and the second apply spring,<br>
and a third thrust bearing disposed between the apply member and the second actuator,<br>
wherein the second and third thrust bearings are configured to facilitate the transfer of an<br>
axially applied force between components rotating at different rates.<br>
[0011]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
10012]	Figure 1 is a schematic depiction of a vehicle having a radially stacked<br>
dual dry clutch apparatus in accordance with the present invention;<br><br>
3<br>
|0013]	Figure 2 is a partial sectional view of the radially stacked dual dry clutch<br>
apparatus of Figure 1; and<br>
(0014)	Figure 3 is a schematic isometric view of an apply member and a clutch<br>
hub.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015J	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 shows a schematic depiction of a vehicle 10 in accordance with the present invention. The vehicle 10 includes an engine 12; a radially stacked dual dry clutch apparatus 14: and a dual clutch transmission 16, or DCT 16. The radially stacked dual dry clutch apparatus 14 includes an outer clutch 22 and an inner clutch 24 as will be described in more detail hereinafter. The DCT 16 includes a first power flow path 26 and a second power flow path 28. According to a preferred embodiment, the power flow path 26 is associated with even gear ratios and the power flow path 28 is associated with odd gear ratios.<br>
[0016]	The radially stacked dual dry clutch apparatus 14 is configured to receive<br>
input torque from the engine 12 and selectively transfer output torque to the DCT 16 via output shaft 30 and/or output shaft 32. More precisely, engine torque is selectively transmitted through clutch 22 via output shaft 30 while one of the even gear ratios is engaged, and engine torque is selectively transmitted through clutch 24 via output shaft 32 while one of the odd gear ratios is engaged. It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that engine torque may be briefly transmitted to the DCT 16 via both of the output shafts 30, 32 during a ratio change.<br>
[0017]	Referring to Figure 2, the upper half of the radially stacked dual dry clutch<br>
apparatus 14 is shown in more detail. It should be appreciated that the dual dry clutch 14<br>
is generally symmetrical about the center line CL such that the bottom half of the dual<br>
dry clutch (not shown) is similar to that of the upper half shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0018]	The outer clutch 22 is preferably a single plate design, whereas the inner<br>
clutch 24 is preferably a dual plate design. While other clutch plate configurations may be envisioned, the dual plate design of the inner clutch 24 is preferred because the outer diameter of the clutch 24 is relatively smaller than that of the clutch 22, and the inner<br><br>
4<br>
clutch 24 therefore has a smaller engagement radius which limits holding capacity. By<br>
implementing a dual plate design, the torque capacity of the inner clutch 24 is doubled as<br>
compared to a single plate design, and the heat capacity is correspondingly increased.<br>
[0019]	The radially stacked dual dry clutch 14 includes a housing 40 that is<br>
rigidly connected to the engine 12 (shown in Figure 1) such that the housing 40 rotates at engine speed.<br>
10020]	The outer clutch 22 includes a first clutch plate 42 attached to the housing<br>
40 such that the first clutch plate 42 rotates at engine speed. The outer clutch 22 also includes a second clutch plate 44 mounted to a clutch hub 46. The clutch plate 44 and clutch hub 46 are configured to rotate at a plurality of different speeds depending on the currently selected gear speed ratio. The clutch plate 44 includes clutch pads 48, 50. An apply spring 52 operatively connected to the clutch plate 42 is adapted to bias the clutch plate 42 out of engagement with the clutch plate 44. An actuator 54 is adapted to selectively actuate the outer clutch 22 by compressing the apply spring 52 such that the clutch plates 42, 44 engage and rotate as a single member. The actuator 54 is preferably a stationary piston type actuator, however, it should be appreciated that other types of actuators may be implemented as well.<br>
[0021]	According to a preferred embodiment, a thrust bearing 56 is disposed<br>
between the actuator 54 and the apply spring 52. The thrust bearing 56 is implemented to<br>
accommodate a speed differential thereacross while transferring force from the actuator<br>
54 to the apply spring 52. In other words, the thrust bearing 56 is implemented to<br>
transfer force from the actuator 54, which is preferably stationary (i.e., grounded), to the<br>
apply spring 52, which is rotating at engine speed, in order to engage the outer clutch 22.<br>
[0022]	The clutch hub 46 is operatively connected to one or more damper springs<br>
58. The damper springs 58 are adapted to dampen, or absorb, at least a portion of the torque spike generated during engagement of the clutch 22 and to absorb engine torque pulsations thereby producing smoother vehicle operation. The clutch hub 46 is also operatively connected through the damper springs 58 to the output shaft 30. Accordingly, the rotation of the clutch hub 46 is transferable to the DCT 16 (shown in Figure 1) via the output shaft 30.<br><br>
5<br>
(0023 ]	The inner clutch 24 includes a housing member 60 attached to the housing<br>
40 such that the housing member 60 rotates at engine speed. A first pair of clutch plates 62. 64 are rigidly mounted to the housing member 60. The inner clutch 24 also includes a second pair of clutch plates 66. 68 respectively mounted to a pair of clutch hubs 70, 72. The clutch plates 66. 68 and clutch hubs 70, 72 are configured to rotate at a plurality of different speeds depending on the currently selected gear speed ratio. The clutch plate 66 includes clutch pads 74, 76, and the clutch plate 68 includes clutch pads 78, 80. An apply spring 82 operatively connected to the clutch plate 62 is adapted to bias the clutch plates 62. 64 out of engagement with the clutch plates 66, 68. An actuator 84 is adapted to selectively actuate the inner clutch 24 by compressing the apply spring 82 such that the clutch plates 62, 64 engage the clutch plates 66, 68. The actuator 84 is preferably a stationary piston type actuator, however, it should be appreciated that other types of actuators may be implemented as well.<br>
[0024]	An apply member 86 is preferably disposed through the hub 46 between<br>
the actuator 84 and the apply spring 82 to facilitate the transfer of force therebetween.<br>
The apply member 86 includes an end portion 88 near the actuator 84 and an opposite<br>
end portion 90 near the apply spring 82. A thrust bearing 92 is disposed between the<br>
actuator 84 and the end portion 88 of the apply member 86. A thrust bearing 94 is<br>
disposed between the apply spring 82 and the end portion 90 of the apply member 86.<br>
[0025]	The thrust bearings 92, 94 are adapted to accommodate a speed<br>
differential thereacross while facilitating the transfer of force from the actuator 84 to the apply spring 82. In other words, the thrust bearing 92 is implemented to transfer force from the actuator 84, which is stationary (i.e., grounded), to the apply member 86, which may be rotating at an intermediate speed between zero and engine speed depending on the currently selected gear ratio. Similarly, the thrust bearing 94 is implemented to transfer force from the apply member 86, which may be rotating at an intermediate speed, to the apply spring 82, which is rotating at engine speed. Therefore, by implementing the thrust bearings 92, 94, force is transferable from the actuator 84, through the apply member 86, and to the apply spring 82, despite the fact that the respective components through which force is transferred are not rotating at a common speed.<br><br>
6<br>
[0026]	The clutch hub 70 is operatively connected to one or more damper springs<br>
100, and the clutch hub 72 is operatively connected to one or more damper springs 102. The damper springs 100. 102 are adapted to dampen, or absorb, at least a portion of the torque spike generated during engagement of the clutch 24 and absorb engine torque pulsations thereby providing smoother vehicle operation. The clutch hubs 70, 72 are both operatively connected through the damper spring 100, 102 to the output shaft 32. Accordingly, the rotation of the clutch hubs 70, 72 is transferable to the DCT 16 (shown in Figure 1) via the output shaft 32.<br>
[0027]	The manner in which force is transferable by the apply member 86 and<br>
through the clutch hub 46 is shown more clearly in Figure 3. The apply member 86 includes the end portion 88. the end portion 90 and a middle portion 110 located generally halfway therebetween. The apply member 86 is composed of two distinct portions, a first portion 112 defined between the end portion 88 and the middle portion 110, and a second portion 114 defined between the middle portion 110 and the end portion 90. The first portion 112 of the apply member 86 is generally a hollow cylindrical design. The second portion 114 of the apply member 86 is composed of a plurality of fingers 116 axially extending from the middle portion 110 and forming a castellated type design.<br>
[0028]	The hub 46 defines a plurality of access ports 120 adapted to<br>
accommodate the fingers 116 of the apply member 86. The fingers 116 of the apply member 86 are each inserted through one of the access ports 120 of the hub 46. In this manner, the apply member 86 and the hub 46 rotate together, but the apply member 86 is axially translatable relative to the hub 46 by varying the degree of insertion of the fingers 116 through the access ports 120. Force applied by the actuator 84 (shown in Figure 2) may induce this axial translation. The axial translation of the apply member 86 relative to the hub 46 transfers the force applied by the actuator 84 by pushing the thrust bearing 94 into engagement with the apply spring 82. In this manner, a force applied by the actuator 84 is transferable through the clutch hub 46 to the apply spring 82 (shown in Figure 2) in order to engage the clutch 24, and this force is transferable even if the actuator 84, the clutch hub 46 and the apply spring 82 are rotating at different rates.<br><br>
