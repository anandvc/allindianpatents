Specification DISMANTLING SYSTEM FOR PRODUCT AND ITS METHOD<br>
Background Art Utilization Field of Industry<br>
The present invention relates to a dismantling system for a product of plural kinds and its method, and particularly relates to the dismantling system and its method for improving dismantling working efficiency. Prior Art<br>
Used products are rapidly increased as products such as automobiles, home electric products, etc. spread. These used products are collected from end users, and are mainly shredded, and are classified into metals and others (resin, rubber, etc.). After the classification, the metals are practically used as raw materials of the products, and the others are reclaimed and burned up, and burned-up ashes are reclaimed. As a result, environmental problems are caused around a reclaimed land and a burning-up factory.<br>
In recent years, recycling of the used products is advanced in consideration of such environmental problems and resource problems. Namely, the used products are dismantled of their respective constructional parts, and thermoplastic constructional parts are utilized as recycle       materials for producing regenerative parts. Reusable<br><br>
constructional parts are practically used as used parts. Therefore, the used products are collected and are then dismantled of the respective constructional parts by a dismantling line, and are further classified.<br>
A recycle processing method of each product is prescribed to dismantle and recycle the product.  For example, Japanese Laid-Open (Kokai) Patent No. 7-334583 discloses a recycle system of the product for recycling a disused product on the basis of a database in which a recycle rule of each product is set.  In this recycle system of the product, a recycle processing method is constructed as a database every constructional part, and a classification procedure and a disassembly work procedure (dismantlement work procedure) of each constructional part, etc. are also set as databases. The disused product is conveyed to each line of a recycle factory, and is disassembled in accordance with this disassembly work<br>
procedure, and is further classified and recycled in<br><br>
accordance with the classification procedure.<br>
However, when products having plural product kinds are recycled, the disused products of different kinds are mixed and conveyed to the dismantling line in the conventional product recycle system so that working efficiency of the disassembly (dismantlement) is reduced. Namely, when the product kinds are different from each<br><br>
other, the number of constructional parts, their kinds, and shapes, attaching positions and attaching methods of the respective constructional parts, etc. are different from each other. Therefore, the disassembly work procedure (dismantling work procedure) is different every disused product. For example, when an automobile is dismantled, a shape, a driving system, a passenger number limit of the automobile, etc. are different in accordance with car kinds and grades. Accordingly, the number of constructional parts and their kinds are different, and the individual constructional parts of an engine, etc. are also different. Therefore, when the engine is detached from a car body, the dismantling work procedure is different in accordance with the car kinds and grades since a shape of the engine, an engine storing shape on a car body side, a fixing method of the engine to the car body, etc. are different in accordance with the car kinds, etc. More concretely, a frame for fixing the engine to the car body and a shape and an attaching position of an engine mount device, etc. are different in accordance with the car kinds.  Therefore, bolts, etc. used for fixture between the engine and the engine mount device, and between the engine mount device and the frame, etc. are also different from each other. Further, a working order for detaching the engine from the engine mount device, a working order for detaching the<br><br><br>
engine mount device from the frame, etc. are also different. Accordingly, when the product kinds such as car kinds, etc. are different, a dismantling worker must pass a using tool from one hand to the other in the dismantling work, and change the working order even when the constructional parts of the same kind of the engine, etc. are detached.<br>
Further, constructions on the dismantling line must be changed is accordance with the dismantling work proceduee and a dismantled product. As a result, the number of works is increased every time the products of different kinds are dismantled, thereby reducing working efficiency.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a dismantling system of a product for improving the efficiency of a dismantling work and its method.<br>

The kind information of the product is classification information of the product able to specify that the product is a product having the same instructional parts or a product having almost the same constructional parts.  For example, this-kind information is a maker, a car kind, a grade, etc. in the case of the automobile. Accordingly, the product of the same kind or the approximately same kind has the same constructional parts or almost has the same constructional parts, and is assembled by the same procedure or is almost assembled by the same procedure. Therefore, a dismantling work procedure is the same or is almost the same. The predetermined number is an optimum dismantling number when the products of the same kind or the approximately same kind are continuously dismantled, and is set by a space for stocking the dismantled products, dismantling ability of a dismantling line, etc. The recycle information is information with respect to recycle of each constructional parts of the product. The recycle information is information of the constructional parts able to be used as<br><br><br>
a recycle material and/or information of reusable constructional parts (able to be used as used parts), etc. For example, the information with respect to the recycle material is whether it is usable or not as the recycle material, a raw material, the number of recycle times, etc. The information with respect to the reusable parts is whether parts are reusable or not, a type of the parts, a reusable limit, etc.  Further, the past collecting situation statistically shows a past collecting number of r  the products collected for dismantlement.  For example, the past collecting situation is a monthly collecting number for the past several years, etc.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiment modes of a dismantling system of a product and its method in the present invention will next be explained with reference to the drawings.<br><br>
In the dismantling system of a product and its method in the present invention, a predetermined number of products of the same kind or the approximately same kind are collected and form a lot. The products are dismantled every lot so that the products can be continuously dismantled by the same dismantling work procedure. Therefore, a product information database for setting product kind information corresponding to product identification information is arranged so that the products of plural kinds are classified into products of the same kind or the approximately same kind. Further, in this dismantling method and its method, recycle information of each constructional part of a product is set in the product information database in accordance with the product identification information and/or product kind information so that each constructional part after the dismantlement can be efficiently classified. Further, it is possible to specify an insufficient recycle material and the kind of a product having used parts. Furthermore, a past collecting information database for setting a past collecting situation of the product in accordance with the product kind is arranged in this dismantling system and its method. Accordingly, a collecting pace of products is estimated in accordance with each product kind, and the entire system can be efficiently practically used by hastening<br><br><br>
dismantling start.<br>
In this embodiment mode, the dismantling system of a product and its method in the present invention are applied to an automobile. Accordingly, in this embodiment mode, a frame number as a unique number given to each automobile is used as identification information of the product in the present invention, and a car kind and a grade every car kind are used as kind information of the product in the -present invention.  In this automobile dismantling system,  the automobile (disused car) dismantled by a dealer, a collecting trader, etc. is collected, and is temporarily stored to a stockyard.  Further, in the automobile dismantling system, after the disused car is dismantled in a dismantling factory every lot, constructional parts of the dismantled automobile are used as a recycle material in a regenerative parts factory, and are practically used as used parts in an automobile repairing factory, a used parts sales trader, etc. The automobile dismantling system has a host computer for generalizing the entire system. Each terminal arranged in the dealer, the collecting trader, the stockyard, the dismantling factory, the regenerative parts factory, the automobile repairing factory, the used parts sales trader, etc. is connected to this host computer. The host computer may be arranged in an automobile maker, and may be also arranged in a special company for generalizing<br><br>
the automobile dismantling system.<br>
First, with reference to Fig. 1, the entire construction of the automobile dismantling system 1 will be explained. The automobile dismantling system 1 is<br>
constructed by a host computer 2, dealers 3a, 3b, 	,<br>
collecting traders 4a, 4b,	, stockyards 5,	,<br>
dismantling factories 6, 	, regenerative parts factories<br>
7, 	, automobile repairing factories 8, 	, used parts<br>
sales traders 9,	, et- Terminals 30a, 30b, 40a, 40b,<br>
50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 	 connected to the host computer 2<br>
are respectively arranged in the dealers 3a, 3b, 	, the<br>
collecting traders 4a, 4b,	, the stockyards 5,	, the<br>
dismantling factories 6,	, the regenerative parts<br>
factories 7, 	, the automobile repairing factories 8, 	,<br>
the used parts sales traders 9, 	, etc. The automobile<br>
dismantling system 1 is formed in an area unit able to smoothly collect an automobile as a dismantling object and smoothly supply dismantled parts. The construction of the automobile dismantling system 1 includes the dealers 3a, 3b,<br>
	, the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	, the stockyards 5,<br>
	, the dismantling factories 6, 	, the regenerative<br>
parts factories 7, 	, the automobile repairing factories<br>
8,	, the used parts sales traders 9,	, etc. located<br>
within this area.<br>
In this embodiment mode, the dealers 3a, 3b,	, and<br><br>
the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 correspond to collecting<br>
means described in the claims. The regenerative parts<br>
factories 7,	, the automobile repairing factories 8,	<br>
and the used parts sales traders 9, 	 correspond to<br>
dismantling parts treating means described in the claims. The collecting means may be also set to another means such as an end user, a used automobile sales company, etc. in<br>
addition to the dealers 3a, 3b, 	 and the collecting<br>
traders   4a,   4b.-	.     The  dismantling parts   treating means<br>
may be also set to.another means such as a material factory, a dealer, etc. in addition to the regenerative parts<br>
factories 7,	, the automobile repairing factories 8,	,<br>
and the used parts sales traders 9, 	.<br>
The host computer 2 and the terminals 30a, 30b, 40a,<br>
40b, SO, 60, 70, 80, 90, 	 are connected to each other<br>
through a dedicated line using WAN (Wide Area Network) .  In Fig. 1, connection is made only between the host computer 2<br>
and each terminal 30a, 	, but may be also made between<br>
the respective terminals 30a, 	.<br>
The host computer 2 generalizes the automobile<br>
dismantling system 1, and performs all managements with<br>
respect to collection, storage and dismantlement of the<br>
automobile, processing of the dismantled parts and supply<br>
of insufficient parts, etc. Therefore, the host computer 2<br>
collects information from each terminal 30a, 	 and<br><br>
provides information to each terminal 30a,	.  Further,.<br>
the host computer 2 stores the collected information, and generates providing information from the collected information and the stored information. As mentioned above, the host computer 2 may be arranged in an automobile maker, and may be also arranged in a special company of the automobile dismantlement. When the host computer 2 is arranged in the special company of the automobile dismantlement, an unillustrated terminal of  each automobile maker is.connected to the host computer 2, and the host computer 2 is constructed such that information such as the automobile maker, a car kind, a grade, registration year and month, parts construction, raw materials of respective constructional parts, a type, the number of recycle times, a reusable limit, a utilization use, etc. with respect to a frame number of each automobile is provided from each automobile maker. The construction of the host computer 2 will be explained later in detail.<br>
The dealers 3a, 3b, 	 trade-in the automobile from<br>
a user replacing the automobile with a new one, and the<br>
traded-in automobile is supplied to each stockyard 5, 	<br>
as a disused car. The dealers 3a, 3b,	collect the<br>
automobile as a disused object in addition to the<br>
replacement.  In the dealers 3a, 3b,	, terminals 30a,<br>
30b, 	 are respectively arranged, and transmit and<br><br>
receive information with respect to the traded-in automobile, etc, between these terminals and the host<br>
computer 2.  The collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 collect the<br>
automobile as a disused object from the user, and supply<br>
the collected automobile to each stockyard 5, 	 as a<br>
disused car.  In the collecting traders 4a, 4b,	,<br>
terminals 40a, 40b, 	 are respectively arranged, and<br>
transmit and receive information with respect to the<br>
collected automobile, etc. between these terminals and the<br>
host computer 2.	<br>
The stockyards 5, 	 temporarily store the<br>
automobile (disused car) supplied from the dealers 3a, 3b,<br>
	 and the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	, and supply the<br>
automobile (disused car) to the dismantling factories 6, —<br>
-	every lot.  In each stockyard 5,	, the automobile is<br>
stocked every the same car kind and the same grade. In the<br>
stockyards 5,	, terminals 50,	are respectively<br>
arranged, and transmit and receive information with respect to the stocked automobile and a stocking situation, etc. between these terminals and the host computer 2.<br>
The dismantling factories 6, 	 dismantle the<br>
automobile (disused car) supplied from the stockyards 5, —<br>
-	on automobile dismantling lines 61, 	 every lot, and<br>
supply dismantled parts to the regenerative parts factories<br>
7, 	, the"automobile repairing factories 8, 	, the used<br><br>
parts sales traders 9 	, etc. On each automobile<br>
dismantling line 61,	, the automobile of the same car<br>
kind and the same grade (namely, the automobile having the same constructional parts) is continuously dismantled so that the automobile is continuously dismantled in the same dismantling work procedure. On each automobile dismantling<br>
line 61, 	, a dismantled parts classification document is<br>
stuck to each automobile, and dismantled parts are classified on the basic of this dismantled parts classification document-. .Concretely, a PP box 62, an ABS box 63, a rubber box 64, etc. for stocking a recycle material, an engine box 65, a transmission box 66, etc. for stocking used parts, and an unillustrated box for stocking disused parts are arranged on each automobile dismantling<br>
line 61,	. The dismantled parts are classified into<br>
these boxes (see Fig. 4).  In particular, in the case of<br>
the recycle material, a virgin material, a first recycle<br>
material and a second recycle material are classified in<br>
accordance with the number of recycle times.  Information<br>
(raw material or type, the number of recycle times or<br>
reusable limit, utilization use) of all constructional<br>
parts of the automobile of each lot is described in the<br>
dismantled parts classification document, and this document<br>
is made on the basis of dismantling information (see Fig.<br>
4) . In the dismantling factories 6,	, terminals 60	<br><br>
are respectively arranged, and transmit and receive information with respect to the dismantled automobile and a dismantling situation, etc. between these terminals and the host computer 2.<br>
In this embodiment mode, the automobile dismantling<br>
lines 61, 	 (dismantling factories 6, 	) correspond to<br>
dismantling means described in the claims. The dismantled<br>
parts are supplied from the dismantling factories 6, 	 to<br>
the re genetative parts factories 7,	, and ar^".,utilized<br>
as a recycle material and automobile parts are regenerated on a recycle line 71.  The recycle material is generally reduced in strength as the number of recycle times is increased. Accordingly, performance of the recycle material as a raw material is maintained on the recycle line 71 by blending the recycle material and the virgin material (a raw material never used as a recycle material), and adding a reinforcing material (see Fig. 4) .  For example, with respect to resin parts regenerated on the recycle line 71, the virgin material is injected as an outer cover, and the raw material having the blended recycle material therein is then injected and molded. As the number of recycle times is increased, a blending ratio of the virgin material is increased and an adding amount of the reinforcing material is increased. No recycle material having the number of recycle times equal to or greater than<br><br>
a predetermined number (e.g., three times or more) is used as the raw material of the regenerative parts.  In the<br>

Each database will next be explained with reference to Figs. 5 to 11.<br>
First, the automobile constructional parts information database 21a will be explained with reference to Fig. 5.  Information with respect to all automobiles registered at present on the basis of information from an automobile maker is set to the automobile constructional parts information database 21a.  Information able to specify an automobile kind in accordance with information able to discriminate each automobile, and information of constructional parts of the automobile are also set to this automobile constructional parts information database 21a. Information with respect to the automobile deleted in registration is erased from the automobile constructional parts information database 21a. This automobile constructional parts information database 21a has setting items of "frame number", "automobile maker", "car kind", "grade", "registration year and month", "constructional parts", "raw material or type", "the number of recycle times or reusable limit" and "utilization use". The "frame number" is a unique number given to each of all manufactured automobiles so that each automobile can be specified by this frame number. Therefore, other setting items are set in accordance with the "frame number", in the automobile constructional parts information database 21a.<br><br>
The "automobile maker", "car kind" and "grade" are information for specifying a kind (product kind) of each automobile. Accordingly, if the automobile has the same automobile maker, the same car kind and the same grade, all the constructional parts are the same or approximately the same, and are assembled in the same procedure or the approximately same procedure. Since an optional product is mounted to the automobile in accordance with a user and the automobile is remodeled, etc., all the constructional parts are not necessarily the same even when the automobile^ maker, the car kind and the grade are the same.  Further, if the automobile has the same automobile maker and the same car kind (this case corresponds to a case in which the kind of the automobile is approximately the same), all the constructional parts are approximately the same and are assembled approximately by the same procedure. The "registration year and month" are registered year and month of each automobile. The "constructional parts" are all constructional parts of each automobile. The "raw material or type", the "the number of recycle times or reusable limit" and the "utilization use" are set in accordance with each constructional part of the "constructional parts". The "raw material or type" is a raw material of each constructional part when the constructional part can be used as a recycle material, and a type of each<br><br>
constructional part when the constructional part can be used as used parts.  "The number of recycle times or reusable limit" is the number of using times as a recycle material when the constructional part can be used as the recycle material, and is the number of years or a running distance of a reusable limit when the constructional part can be used as used parts. With respect to the number of recycle times, the constructional part is set to a virgin material when no constructional part is hever used as a recycle- material. When the number of recycle times is set to three times or more, no constructional part is used as the recycle material in consideration of strength as a raw material, etc.  The reusable limit year number or running distance is a reference value for unusing the constructional part as used parts if the dismantled automobile (disused car) exceeds a value of the reusable limit year number or the running distance. The "utilization use" is utilization use of each constructional part after the dismantlement, and one of the recycle material, the used parts and disuse is set. When the number of recycle times is three times or more, the disuse is set even when the constructional part can be used as the recycle material. Further, the disuse is also set when the constructional part can be used as the used parts but exceeds the reusable limit (for example, 7 years or 70,000<br><br>
km) .  In setting of the disuse, reclamation, reclamation after crush, and reclamation after burning-up may be also set in more detail. Further, a dismantling work procedure may be also set in accordance with each constructional part although this procedure is set in the automobile constructional parts information database 21a.<br>
In this embodiment mode, the frame number corresponds to identification number described in the claims, and the car kind (accordingly, automobile maker) and the grade correspond to product kind information described in the claims.<br>

data of the disused car information database 21b, etc., and<br>
also transmits stock information to terminals 50, 	 of<br>
the stockyards 5,	(see Fig.4).  The vacant information<br>
is each occupying area occupied by the automobile of the same car kind and the same grade at present in each<br>
stockyard 5, 	, and the present vacant area of each<br>
stockyard 5, 	.  First, the stockyard information<br>
managing section 20d sets the "stockyard" and the "stock area" of the stockyard information database 21d every time a new stockyard 5 is arranged (see Fig. 8). The stockyard information managing section 20d specifies the car kind and the grade from the frame number of an automobile (disused car) newly collected on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a every time data of this automobile (disused car) is set to the disused car information database 21b.  If the car kind is different, the automobile maker is also different. Accordingly, if the car kind is specified, the automobile maker is also<br><br>
specified. Further, the stockyard information managing<br>
section 20d specifies the stockyard 5, 	 stocking the<br>
automobile of the specified car kind and grade, and adds one to the column of the "car number" of the stockyard information database 21d. When no automobile of the specified car kind and grade is stocked to all the<br>
stockyards 5, 	, the stockyard information managing<br>
section 20d determines the stockyard 5, 	 stocking this<br>
automobile of the ear kind and the grade in consideration of a vacant area, and newly sets the columns of "car kind "grade" and "car number" of the stockyard information database 21d (see Fig. 8).  Further, the stockyard information managing section 20d updates the data of "occupying area" and "vacant area" of the stockyard information database 21d every time vacant information is transmitted (see Fig. 8). The stockyard information managing section 20d also sets "lot number" and "dismantling start day" of the stockyard information database 21d every time the lot is determined in the lot determining section 20h (see Fig. 8).

The dismantling factory information managing section 20e sets "dismantling start schedule day" of the "processing schedule lot" in consideration of the processing ability of<br>
each dismantling factory 6,	, the dismantling processing<br>
 situation information, the other lots scheduled to be processed, etc.  Further, the dismantling factory information managing section 20e determines the next lot to be dismantled by the dismantling processing situation information every time the dismantlement of all automobiles of lots being dismantled is terminated, and updates each data of "lot being processed" of the dismantling factory information database 21e to data of the next dismantling lot (see Fig. 9) . The dismantling factory information managing section 20e sets "dismantling termination schedule day" of the "lot being processed" in consideration of the<br>
processing ability of each dismantling factory 6, 	, etc.<br>
The dismantling factory information managing section 2 0e preferentially determinedly sets the lot of the automobile having insufficient recycle material and used parts as constructional parts to the next dismantling lot on the basis of information of the insufficient recycle material<br><br><br>
managing section 20i and the insufficient used parts managing section 20j . Further, the dismantling factory information managing section 20e transmits pertinent data of the dismantling factory information database 21e to a pertinent dismantling factory 6 as dismantling information every time data of the dismantling factory information database 21e are updated. The dismantling factory information managing section 20e adds information (raw material or type, the number of recycle times or reusable limit and utilization use) of all constructional parts of the automobile of each lot, and a dismantling work procedure as the dismantling information on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database<br>
21a. Each dismantling factory 6, 	 obtains information<br>
of the dismantled lot on the basis of the dismantling information, and makes a dismantling schedule, and finely classifies dismantled parts.<br>
The recycle material information managing section 20J is a processing section in which a recycle material information program stored to the memory device 21 is loaded onto the RAM of the computer main body 20, and is executed by the CPU so that each processing is performed. The recycle material information managing section 20f makes changes and erases data of the recycle material informatior database 21f, etc. on the basis of recycle material<br><br>
information from the dismantling factories 6, 	, data of<br>
the automobile constructional parts information database 21a and the stockyard information database 21d, etc. (see Fig. 4).  The recycle material information is information such as the number of recycle times, an amount, etc. of PP, ABS, etc. as a recycle material stocked at present to each<br>
dismantling factory 6, 	, and also includes information<br>
of the recycle material obtained from the lot dismantled at present.  First the recycle material information managing section 20f sets the "recycle material" of the recycle material information database 21f on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a, and also sets the "dismantling factory or stockyard" every time a new stockyard 5 or dismantling factory 6 is arranged (see Fig. 10). The recycle material information managing section 20f updates "the number of recycle times" and the "amount" in accordance with the recycle material of a pertinent dismantling factory 6 of the recycle material information database 21f every time the recycle material information is transmitted (see Fig. 10). The recycle material information managing section 20f also specifies the recycle material obtained from the constructional parts of an automobile newly stocked, and the number of recycle times and the amount of the recycle material on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database<br><br><br>
21a every time the stockyard information database 21d is updated. Further, the recycle material information managing section 20f updates "the number of recycle times" and the "amount" in accordance with the recycle material of a pertinent stockyard 5 of the recycle material information database 21f (see Fig. 10). With respect to the recycle material having the number of recycle times equal to or greater than three times, no recycle material information managing section 20f sets the number of recycle times and the amount to the recycle material information database 21f in consideration of strength as a raw material.<br>
The used parts information managing section 20g is a processing section in which a used parts information managing program stored to the memory device 21 is loaded onto the RAM of the computer main body 20, and is executed by the CPU so that each processing is performed. The used parts information managing section 20g makes, changes and erases data of the used parts information database 21g, etc. on the basis of used parts information from the dismantling<br>
factories 6, 	, data of the automobile constructional<br>
parts information database 21a and the stockyard<br>
information database 21d, etc. (see Fig. 4) . The used<br>
parts information is information of a type, a using year<br>
number and a running distance of the used parts stocked at<br>
present to each dismantling factory 6, 	, and also<br><br>
includes information of the used parts obtained from a lot<br>
being dismantled at present. First, the used parts<br>
information managing section 20e sets "used parts" of the<br>
used parts information database 21g on the basis of the<br>
automobile constructional parts information database 21a,<br>
and also sets the "dismantling factory or stockyard" every<br>
time a new stockyard 5 or dismantling factory 6 is arranged<br>
(see Fig. 11) . The used parts information managing section<br>
20g updates the "type", the "using year number" and the<br>
"running distance" in accordance with the used parts of a<br>
pertinent dismantling factory 6 of the used parts<br>
information database 21g every time the used parts<br>
information is transmitted (see Fig. 11) . The used parts<br>
information managing section 20g specifies the used parts<br>
obtained from the constructional parts of an automobile<br>
newly stocked, and the type of the used parts on the basis<br>
of the automobile constructional parts information database<br>
21a every time the stockyard information database 21d is<br>
updated.  Further, the used parts information managing<br>
section 20g specifies the using year number and the running<br>
distance on the basis of the disused car information<br>
database 21b, and updates the "type", the "using year<br>
number" and the "running distance" in accordance with the<br>
used parts of a pertinent stockyard 5 of the used parts<br>
information database 21g (see Fig. 11). When the using<br><br><br>
year number or the running distance of the constructional<br>
parts of the dismantled automobile exceeds the year number<br>
or the running distance of a reusable limit of the<br>
"reusable limit" of the automobile constructional parts<br>
information database 21a (see Fig. 5), no used parts<br>
information managing section 20g sets the using year number<br>
or the running distance to the used parts information<br>
database 21g in consideration of durability as the used<br>
parts.<br>
The lot determining section 20h is a processing<br>
section in which a lot determining program stored to the<br>
memory device 21 is loaded onto the RAM of the computer<br>
main body 20, and is executed by the CPU so that each<br>
processing is performed. When the number of automobiles<br>
(disused cars) of the same car kind (therefore, the same<br>
automobile maker) and the same grade reaches a lot car<br>
number the lot determining section 20h determines the lot<br>
car number of automobiles of the same car kind and the same<br><br>
grade as a lot as a dismantling unit on the basis of data<br>
of the stockyard information database 21d, and gives the<br>
lot number. Namely, in the case of the automobiles of the<br>
same car kind and the same grade, the same constructional<br>
parts are arranged and assembled in the same assembly<br>
procedure. Therefore, since a dismantling work procedure<br>
is the same and dismantled parts are also the same, the lot<br><br>
car number of automobiles of the same car kind and the same grade is set to the dismantling unit. The lot car number is an optimum dismantled car number when the automobiles of the same car kind and the same grade are continuously dismantled. The lot car number is set by each stock area<br>
of the stockyards 5, 	 for stocking the dismantled<br>
automobiles, dismantling ability of each automobile<br>
dismantling line 61, 	 of the dismantling factories 6, —<br>
-, etc. As the lot car number is increased, dismantling<br>
efficiency on each automobile dismantling line 61, 	 is<br>
improved, but a time and a stock space for collecting a lot car number of automobiles are required. Further, when the number of automobiles (disused cars) of the same car kind and the same grade does not reach the lot car number, but can be estimated to reach the lot car number during several days on the basis of data of the past collecting information database 21c, the lot determining section^ 20h determines the number of automobiles of the same car kind and the same grade smaller than the lot car number as a lot as the dismantling unit, and gives the lot number. Namely, since a past collected car number every the same car kind and the same grade is monthly recorded to the past collecting information database 21c, a collected car number in an arbitrary month can be estimated on the basis of this information. Estimation probability can be further<br><br>
improved if a past monthly registered car number every the same car kind and the same grade is recorded in addition to a past collected car number.  Further, when the lot determining section 20h determines the lot, the lot determining section 20h determines one of the dismantling<br>
factories 6, 	 for dismantling the automobile of this lot.<br>
This dismantling factory is determined in consideration of<br>
position relations of the stockyards 5, 	 and the<br>
dismantling factories 6, 	, the situation of a processing<br>
schedule lot in each dismantling factory 6, 	, etc. The<br>
lot determining section 20h preferentially determinedly sets the automobile having insufficient recycle material and used parts as constructional parts to the lot on the basis of information of the insufficient recycle material managing section 20i and the insufficient used parts managing section 20j.  In this case, there is also a case in which the lot car number is set to be smaller than a normal lot car number so as to early supply the insufficient recycle material and used parts.<br>
The insufficient recycle material managing section 20i is a processing section in which an insufficient recycle material managing program stored to the memory device 21 is loaded onto the RAM of the computer main body 20, and is executed by the CPU so that each processing is performed. The insufficient recycle material managing<br><br>
section 20i transmits recycle material supply information to the regenerative parts factory 7 every time recycle material insufficient information is transmitted from the regenerative parts factory 7 (see Fig. 4). The recycle material insufficient information is information such as the kind of an insufficient recycle material, its amount, etc. in each regenerative parts factory 7. The recycle material supply information is information of the insufficient recycle material in the recycle material information database 21f. The regenerative parts factory 7 obtains information of the insufficient recycle material on the basis of the recycle material supply information. When the insufficient recycle material is in store, the regenerative parts factory 7 preengages the insufficient recycle material to the host computer 2 or the dismantling<br>
factories 6,	, and the stockyards 5,	. When there is<br>
no insufficient recycle material in_the dismantling<br>
factories 6, 	 and the stockyards 5, 	, the<br>
insufficient recycle material managing section 20i specifies the kind and the grade of an automobile having the insufficient recycle material as constructional parts on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a. The insufficient recycle material managing section 20i then transmits information of these specified car kind and grade to the dealers 3a, 3b, -<br><br>
— and the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 as insufficient<br>
car kind information (see Fig. 3) . The dealers 3a, 3b,	<br>
and the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 present trading-in<br>
and collecting prices higher than normal trading-in and collecting prices to a user so as to rapidly collect the automobile of these specified car kind and grade, and early collect the automobile (therefore, the insufficient recycle material) of these specified car kind and grade. Namely, there is no cost loss even when the automobile is collected at a slightly high price since dismantled parts are utilized as a recycle material without storing the dismantled parts as stock. This is because there is no storing cost and the recycle material can be purchased at a higher price in the regenerative parts factory 7.<br>
The insufficient used parts managing section 20j is a processing section in which an insufficient used parts managing program stored to the memory device 2_1 is loaded onto the RAM of the computer main body 20, and is executed by the CPU so that each processing is performed.  The insufficient used parts managing section 20j transmits used parts supply information to an automobile repairing factory 8 or a used parts sales trader 9 every time used parts insufficient information is transmitted from the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 (see Fig. 4). The used parts insufficient information is<br><br>
information such as the type of used parts, etc. insufficient in the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9. The used parts supply information is information of the used parts insufficient within the used parts information database 21g. The automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 obtains information of the insufficient used parts on the basis of the used parts supply information, and preengages the insufficient used parts to the host computer<br>
2 or the dismantling factories 6, 	 and the stockyards 5,<br>
	 when the insufficient used parts are in stock. When<br>
there are no insufficient used parts in the dismantling<br>
factories 6, 	 and the stockyards 5, 	, the<br>
insufficient used parts managing section 20j specifies the kind and the grade of an automobile having the insufficient used parts as constructional parts on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a.<br>
The insufficient used parts managing section 20j then<br><br>
transmits information of these specified car kind and grade<br>
to the dealers 3a, 3b, 	 and the collecting traders 4a,<br>
4b, 	 as insufficient car kind information (see Fig. 3).<br>
The dealers 3a, 3b, 	 and the collecting traders 4a, 4b,<br>
	 present trading-in and collecting prices higher than<br>
normal trading-in and collecting prices to a user so as to rapidly collect the automobile of these specified car kind<br><br>
and grade, and early collect the automobile (therefore, the insufficient used parts) of these specified car kind and grade. Namely, there is no cost loss even when the automobile is collected at a slightly high price since dismantled parts are utilized as used parts without storing the dismantled parts as stock. This is because there is no storing cost and the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 purchases the used parts at a higher price.<br>
In accordance with this automobile dismantling system 1, the automobile of the same automobile maker, the same car kind and the same grade is continuously dismantled every lot car number so that a dismantling work can be made in the same dismantling work procedure. Therefore, it is not necessary for a worker to pass a tool from one hand to the other, change a working order, and change the construction of the automobile dismantling line 61 so that dismantling work efficiency is improved.  Furthermore, the automobile dismantling system 1 can also start the dismantlement when the car number is smaller than the lot car number, but is expected to reach the lot car number in a few days. Accordingly, stocking time can be shortened in<br>
the stockyards 5, 	 so that stock area can be reduced in<br>
the stockyards 5, 	.  The automobile dismantling system 1<br>
can early supply the insufficient recycle material or used<br><br><br>
parts in accordance with wishes of the regenerative parts<br>
factory 7, the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used<br>
parts sales trader 9, etc.  Further, when there is no<br>
insufficient recycle material or used parts, the automobile<br>
dismantling system 1 preferentially collects the automobile<br>
having this recycle material and the used parts.<br>
Accordingly, the recycle material and the used parts do not<br>
almost become insufficient in the regenerative parts<br>
factory 7, the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used<br>
parts sales trader 9, etc. Therefore, the entire<br>
automobile dismantling system 1 is efficiently operated,<br>
and the recycle material and the used parts are not stored<br>
as stock for a long period. Further, in the automobile<br>
dismantling system 1, dismantled parts are finely<br>
classified on the automobile dismantling line 61 on the<br>
basis of data of the automobile dismantled parts<br>
information database 21a so that the dismantled parts can<br>
be effectively practically used at its maximum, and can be<br>
" V	V<br>
efficiently supplied to the regenerative parts factory 7,<br>
the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales<br>
trader 9. An automobile dismantling method using the<br>
automobile dismantling system 1 will next be explained with<br>
reference to Figs. 12 to 14.  Figs. 1 to 11 are referred in<br>
accordance with the explanation at any time.  Here, a<br>
method for determining a lot, a managing method with<br><br>
respect to an insufficient recycle material, and a managing method with respect to insufficient used parts will be explained here as the automobile dismantling method.<br>
First, the lot determining method will be explained along the flow chart of Fig. 12. The dealers 3a, 3b, ——<br>
and the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 transmit trading-in<br>
information or collecting information to the host computer 2 every time a disused automobile is collected. Thus, The host computer 2 receives this trading-in information or collecting information, and sets a frame number of the dismantled automobile (disused car), etc. to the disused car information database 21b (S10) .<br>
Further, the host computer 2 specifies the car kind and the grade from the frame number set to the disused car information database 21b on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a (Sll). Subsequently,^ the host computer 2 retrieves a stockyard 5 stocking the automobile of the specified car kind and grade on the basis of the stockyard information database 21d. When there is a stockyard 5 stocking this automobile, the host computer 2 adds one to a car number in a pertinent column of the stockyard information database 21d, and updates the car number (S12) .  In contrast to this, when there is no stockyard 5 stocking the automobile of the specified car kind and grade, the host computer 2<br><br>
determines the stockyard 5 in consideration of a vacant<br>
area of each stockyard 5, 	, etc., and newly sets the car<br>
kind and the grade to the stockyard information database 21d, and sets one to the car number (S12). Namely, the automobile of the same car kind and the same grade is classified, and is temporarily stocked to each stockyard 5,<br>
Further, the host computer 2 judges whether the updated car number reaches a lot car number or not (S13). When the updated car number reaches the lot car number, the host computer 2 determines this lot car number of automobiles (disused cars) of the same car kind and the same grade as a lot, and gives a lot number, and determines a dismantling factory 6 (S15).<br>
On the other hand, when the updated car number is smaller than the lot car number, the host computer 2 calculates a past collecting pace (a collected car number per one day) of the automobiles of the specified car kind and grade on the basis of the past collecting information database 21c, and estimates the number of automobiles able to be collected in a few days.  The host computer 2 then judges whether or not the car number is expected to reach the lot car number during the dismantlement (S14). When there is no expectation, the host computer 2 waits for a signal of trading-in information or collecting information.<br><br>
In contrast to this, when there is such expectation, the host computer 2 determines the number of automobiles (disused cars) of the same car kind and the same grade smaller than this lot car number as a lot, and gives a lot number, and determines a dismantling factory 6 (S15).<br>
After the host computer 2 gives the lot number, the host computer 2 sets the lot number, etc. to the disused car information database 21b, the stockyard information database 21d and the dismantling factory information database 21e, and transmits stock information to a pertinent stockyard 5 and also transmits dismantling information to a pertinent dismantling factory 6 (S16). Then, automobiles are supplied to the dismantling factory 6 every lot on the basis of the stock information in the stockyard 5, and are dismantled every lot on the basis of the dismantling information in the dismantling factory 6.<br>
In this embodiment mode, processings from Sll to S15<br>
in the flow chart of Fig. 12 correspond to a lot<br>
-it-determining process described in the claims.  In particular,<br>
in this embodiment mode, the processing of S14 in the flow<br>
chart of Fig. 12 corresponds to the lot determining process<br>
described in claim 10.<br>
The insufficient recycle material managing method<br>
will next be explained along the flow chart of Fig. 13.<br>
When there is an insufficient recycle material or a recycle<br><br>
material estimated to be insufficient on the basis of a product plan of regenerative parts, recycle material insufficient information is transmitted from the regenerative parts factory 7 to the host computer 2. Then, the host computer 2 receives this recycle material insufficient information, and specifies the insufficient recycle material (S20).<br>
After the reception, on the basis of the recycle material information database 21f, the host computer 2 judges whether or not the insufficient recycle material<br>
exists in the dismantling factories 6, 	, or whether or<br>
not an automobile having the insufficient recycle material<br>
as constructional parts is stocked to the stockyards 5, 	<br>
(S21) . When the insufficient recycle material exists (or the automobile is stocked), the host computer 2 transmits information with respect to the insufficient recycle material set to the recycle material information database 21f to the regenerative parts factory 7 as recycle material supply information (S24) .  Thus, the regenerative parts factory 7 preengages the insufficient recycle material to the host computer 2, etc. on the basis of the recycle material supply information. The host computer 2 preferentially determines the lot of the automobile of these car kind and grade, a dismantling order, etc. to supply the insufficient recycle material to the<br><br>
regenerative parts factory 7 as soon as possible such that the automobile of the car kind and the grade having the insufficient recycle material is early dismantled.<br>
On the other hand, when there is no insufficient recycle material (or no automobile is stocked), the host computer 2 specifies the car kind and the grade of the automobile having the insufficient recycle material as constructional parts on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a (S22)„<br>
The host computer 2 transmits information of the<br>
specified car kind and grade to the dealers 3a, 3b, 	 and<br>
the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 as insufficient car kind<br>
information (S23).  Further, the host computer 2 transmits information of nonexistence of the insufficient recycle<br>
material at present in the dismantling factories 6, 	 and<br>
the stockyards 5, 	 to the regenerative parts factory 7<br>
as   recycle material supply information (S24) .       <br>
In the dealers 3a, 3b, 	 and the collecting traders<br><br>
4a, 4b,	, trading-m and collecting prices are set to be<br>
higher than normal trading-in and collecting prices to early collect the automobile of the car kind and the grade set to insufficient car kind information. Therefore, when no recycle material insufficient in the regenerative parts<br>
factories 7, 	 exists within the automobile dismantling<br>
system 1, this insufficient recycle material can be rapidly<br><br>
collected in the automobile dismantling system 1.<br>
In this embodiment mode, processings from S21 to S23 in the flow chart of Fig. 13 correspond to an insufficient recycle parts managing process described in the claims.<br>
An insufficient used parts managing method will next be explained along the flow chart of Fig. 14, When there are insufficient used parts or used parts estimated to be insufficient, the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 transmits used parts insufficient information to the host computer 2. The host computer 2 receives this used parts insufficient information, and specifies the insufficient used parts (S30).<br>
After the reception, on the basis of the used parts information database 21g, the host computer 2 judges whether or not the insufficient used parts exist in the<br>
dismantling factories 6, 	, or whether or not an<br>
automobile having the insufficient used parts as<br>
constructional parts is stocked to the stockyards 5, 	<br>
(S31) , When the insufficient used parts exists (or the automobile is stocked), the host computer 2 transmits information with respect to the insufficient used parts set to the used parts information database 21g to the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 as used parts supply information (S34).<br>
The automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts<br><br>
sales trader 9 then preengages the insufficient used parts to the host computer 2, etc. on the basis of the used parts supply information. The host computer 2 preferentially determines a lot of the automobile of the car kind and the grade having the insufficient used parts, a dismantling order, etc. so as to early dismantle this automobile such that the insufficient used parts are supplied to the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 as soon as possible.<br>
On the other hand, when no insufficient used parts exist (or no automobile is stocked), the host computer 2 specifies the car kind and the grade of the automobile having the insufficient used parts as constructional parts on the basis of the automobile constructional parts information database 21a (S32).<br>
Then, the host computer 2 transmits information of<br>
_the specified car kind and grade to the dealers 3a, 3b, 	<br>
and the collecting traders 4a, 4b, 	 as insufficient car<br>
kind information (S33) .  Further, the host computer 2 transmits information of nonexistence of the insufficient<br>
used parts at present in the dismantling factories 6, 	<br>
and the stockyards 5, 	 to the automobile repairing<br>
factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 as used parts supply information (S34).<br>
In the dealers 3a, 3b, 	 and the collecting traders<br><br><br>
4a, 4b, 	, trading-in and collecting prices are set to be<br>
higher than normal trading-in and collecting prices to early collect the automobile of the car kind and the grade set to the insufficient car kind information. Therefore, when no used parts insufficient in the automobile repairing factory 8 or the used parts sales trader 9 exist within the automobile dismantling system 1, these insufficient used parts can be rapidly collected to the automobile dismantling system 1.<br>
In this embodiment mode, processings from S31 to S33 in the flow chart of Fig. 14 correspond to an insufficient recycle parts managing process described in the claims.<br>
In accordance with this automobile dismantling method, a lot number of automobiles of the same car kind and the same grade are set to a lot in a dismantling unit, and dismantling work efficiency is improved.  Further, in the automobile dismantling method, dismantlement can be started when the number of automobiles is smaller than the lot car number, but there is a prospect of reaching the lot car number in a few days. Accordingly, a time until the reaching of the lot car number is shortened.  Further, in the automobile dismantling method, when there is no insufficient recycle material or used parts, the insufficient recycle material or used parts can be rapidly collected so that the required recycle material and used<br><br>
parts can be early supplied.<br>
As mentioned above, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment modes, but can be embodied in various modes.<br>
For example, the dismantling system of a product and its method in the present invention are applied to the automobile dismantling system and its method. However, the present invention can be also applied to a dismantling system of a home electric product, a motor-bicycle, an airplane, etc. and its method.<br>
Information with respect to an automobile (product) to be dismantled and/or information with respect to an insufficient recycle material and used parts can be transmitted from an end user unconnected by WAN, other traders, etc. to the host computer through the Internet, electronic mail, etc.<br>
Further, a frame number (identification information) is inputted from a terminal (input means), but product kind information such as a car kind, a grade, etc. may be inputted from the input means. Industrial Applicability<br>
(1) In accordance with the dismantling system of a product in the present invention, a predetermined number of products of the same kind or the approximately same kind are collected as a lot in a dismantling unit. Accordingly,<br><br><br>
all constructional parts of a dismantled product are set to be the same or almost the same, and can be continuously dismantled in the same or almost same dismantling work procedure. Therefore, the number of works of a worker is reduced, and it is not necessary to change the construction of a dismantling means so that dismantling work efficiency is improved.<br>
(2)	Since the product kind can be specified from<br>
identification information of the product on the basis of a<br>
product information database, the products of plural kinds<br>
can be simply classified into products of the same kind or<br>
.the approximately same kind.<br>
(3)	The respective constructional parts can be classified into recycle material parts, used parts, disused parts, etc. in detail on the basis of the product information database so that the dismantled parts can be effectively used practically. <br>
(4)	Since the kind of the product having insufficient recycle material and used parts is specified and the product of this kind is preferentially collected, the required recycle material and used parts can be rapidly supplied.  Therefore, operating efficiency of the entire dismantling system is improved, and a stocking space of the recycle material, the used parts, etc. can be reduced.<br>
(5)	When the number of products of the same kind or<br><br><br>
the approximately same kind is smaller than a predetermined number, but there is a prospect of reaching the predetermined number, dismantlement can be started with this product number as a lot. Therefore, the operating efficiency of the entire dismantling system is further improved, and the stocking space of a collected product can be reduced.<br>
(6) Further, in the dismantling method of a product in the present invention, a predetermined number of products of the same kind or the approximately same kind are collected as a lot in a dismantling unit. Accordingly, all constructional parts of a dismantled product are set to be the same or almost the same, and can be continuously dismantled in the same or almost same dismantling work procedure. Therefore, the number of works of a worker is reduced so that dismantling work efficiency is improved.<br>
  (7) Since the product kind can be specified from identification information of the product on the basis of a product information database, the products of plural kinds can be simply classified into products of the same kind or the approximately same kind.<br>
(8) The respective constructional parts can be classified into recycle material parts, used parts, disused parts, etc. in detail on the basis of the product information database so that the dismantled parts can be<br><br>
effectively used practically.<br>
(9)	Since the kind of the product having insufficient<br>
recycle material and used parts is specified and the<br>
product of this kind is preferentially collected, the<br>
required recycle material and used parts can be rapidly<br>
supplied. Therefore, it is possible to shorten a time from<br>
the collection of the product to the supply of the<br>
dismantled parts, and a stocking space of the recycle<br>
material, the used parts, etc. can be reduced.<br>
(10)	When the number of products of the same kind or<br>
the approximately same kind is smaller than a predetermined<br>
number, but there is a prospect of reaching the<br>
predetermined number, dismantlement can be started with<br>
this product number as a lot. Therefore, a time from the<br>
collection of the product to the dismantlement can be<br>
shortened, and the stocking space of a collected product<br>
can be reduced.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.        A dismantling system for a product of plural kinds comprising:<br>
