Process for preparing pyridine-substituted amino ketal derivatives<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing pyridinyl-substituted dialkoxyaminoethane derivatives of the formula (I) and intermediates in the process according to the invention.<br><br><br>
where R" is H, SH.<br>
Derivatives of the pyridinoimidazole of the formula (III) were used In turn for preparing novel macrolide antibiotics, for example teHthromycin (US 5,635,485).<br>
Known processes for preparing compounds of the formula (I) are based on the action of alkali metal alkoxides on p-toluenesutfonic esters of ketoximes in alcoholic solution, for example amino ketal derivatives of the formula (I) occur as an intermediate in the preparation of cyclic amino ketones (F. Mollen Amine durch Umlagerungsreaktionen (Neber-Umlagerung) [Amines by rearrangement reactions (Neber rearrangement)], Houben-Weyl 11/1: Stickstoffverbindungen II [Nitrogen compounds II] (1957), p. 903-905).<br>
The preparation of l-(pyridinyf)-1,1-dialkoxy-2-aminoethane derivatives of the formula (I) is described in the US patent 5,792,871 using the example of the 1-(3-pyridinyl)-1,1-diethoxy-2-aminoethane dihydrochloride of the formula (IV) by the following three-stage process:<br><br>
J<br><br><br>
The resulting tosyl oxime of the formula (VIII) is subsequently reacted with potassium ethoxide in ethanol in a Neber rearrangement to give the amino ketal. The resulting p-toluenesulfonic acid potassium salt is filtered after dilution with methyl tert-butyl ether and the filtered solution is admixed with hydrogen chloride dissolved in ether. This precipitates the 1-(3-pyridinyl)-1,1-diethoxy-2-aminoethane dihydrochloride of the formula (IV) as an orange-colored solid.<br>
According to US 5,792,871, the purity of the isolated product could only be estimated<br>
1	13<br>
with the aid of  H and    C NMR data to &gt; 95% as a consequence of unknown impurities. For the further reaction, the amino ketal dihydrochbride (IV) is suspended<br>
it<br><br>
in water and admixed with sodium hydroxide solution, in order to prepare the amino ketal as the free base which is required for the further coupling reaction.<br>
The above-described process has some disadvantages for the scale-up to the industrial scale: first, the intermediates obtained each have to be dried by distillation procedures. Second, the 3-acetylpyridine tosyl oxime intermediate of the formula (VIII) decomposes very easily in the event of prolonged storage above room temperature to release large amounts of energy (decomposition energy for 3-acetylpyridine tosyl oxime approx. 1000 J/g, see also warning with regard to the storage of a toluene-sulfonic ketoxime ester in F. M&amp;ller: Amine durch Umlagerungsreaktionen (Neber-Umlagerung), Houben-Weyl 11/1: Stickstoffverbindungen II (1957), p. 903-905). Third, the 1-(3-pyridinyl)-1,1-diethoxy-2-aminoethane dihydrochloride (IV) prepared in this way is contaminated by by-products, which is confirmed by the strong coloration. Fourth, in order to obtain the free 1-(3-pyridinyI)-1,1-diethoxy-2-aminoethane, the isolated salt (IV) has to be released with an auxiliary base in an additional step. Fifth, there are frequent solvent changes during the process. The solvent mixtures then have to be worked up again very expensively, which leads to environmental pollution.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to find a more efficient and safe process for synthesizing the compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The present invention therefore provides a process for preparing 1-pyridinyl-<br>
1	2<br>
1,1-dia!koxy-2-aminoethane derivatives of the formula (!) where R  and R  are each<br>
independently (Ci-C6)-alkyl, where the alkyl group may be straight-chain or branched,<br>
12	1<br>
or where R  and R  together with the oxygen atoms form a cyclic ketal in which R<br>
2 and R together are a (C2-C4)-alkylidene group, and where the pyridine radical is<br>
substituted in the 2-, 3- or 4-position, preferably in the 3-position, which comprises, in process step (a), converting acetylpyridine of the formula (V) using an aqueous<br>
ar\\i itirin nf a hwHrrwv/lommnnii im fnmnra inH   fnr ovamnlo hwrirrwv/lsmmrinii im fHlnriHo<br><br>
or hydroxylammonium sulfate, or an aqueous solution of hydroxylamine, with the simultaneous or later addition of an inorganic base comprising Mn+, to the acetylpyridine oxime metal salt of the formula (IX) where n is 1 or 2 and Mn+ is an alkali metal metal ion where n=1 or alkaline earth metal ion where n=2, preferably Li+, Na+,K+orCa2+.<br><br>
The cyclic ketal containing a (C2-C4)-alkylidene group is, foi example, a [1,3]dioxolane or a [1,3]dioxane radical.<br>

Also suitable are mixtures of the suitable solvents mentioned.<br>
For 1 mol of p-toluenesulfonic acid derivative (X), preference is given to using from 0.6 1 o 1.1 kg of suitable soivent. Jn the reaction of 100 mol of acetylpyridine oxime salt of the formula (IX), preference is given to using 99-150 mol, more preferably 100-110 mol, of p-toluenesulfonic acid derivative (X).<br>
The term biphasic mixture refers to the mixture of two liquid phases - aqueous phase which comprises the acetylpyridine oxime salt (IX) and the solvent phase which comprises the p-toluenesulfonic acid derivative (X). When a phase transfer catalyst is<br><br>
used, It may be present either m the aqueous phase or m the solvent phase, or be divided between the phases. The biphasic mixture is stirred and/or mixed by customary methods of batchwise or continuous process operation, so that good distribution of the phases is ensured.<br>
The temperature for the reaction in process step (b) in a batchwise procedure is preferably 0-50°C, more preferably 5-30°C, and in a continuous procedure 0-60°C, more preferably 5-40°C.<br>
In process step (c), the solvent phase comprising the acetylpyridine tosyl oxime of the formula (XI), after drying or without preceding drying, is metered into a mixture of alkali<br>
metal alkoxide, alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal alkoxide or alkafine earth<br>
1   -	2  -<br>
metal hydroxide and an alcohol, where "alkoxide" means R O and/or R O and where<br>
12	12<br>
alcohol means R OH and/or R OH, and R  and R  are as defined in the compound of the formula (I), and converted to the 1-(pyridinyl)-1,1-diatkoxy-2-aminoethane derivative of the formula (I).<br>
In process step (c), for 100 mol of the acetylpyridine tosyl oxime of the formula (XI), preference is given to using 99-500 mol of an alkali metal alkoxide, more preferably 100-200 mol; or 99-500 mol of an alkali metal hydroxide, more preferably 100-300 mol; or 50-250 mol of an alkaline earth metal alkoxide, more preferably 50-100 mol, or 50-250 mol of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, more preferably 50-150 mol.<br>
In process step (c), preference is given to using alkali metal hydroxides or alkoxides, particularly lithium hydroxide, lithium methoxide, lithium ethoxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, cesium hydroxide, cesium methoxide or cesium ethoxide.<br>
The choice of the alkoxide and/or of the alcohol depends on the introduction of the<br><br>
2-aminoethane, a mixture is used of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal methoxide in methanol or an alkali metal hydroxide in methanol. For the preparation of the compound 1 -(pyridinyl)-l -([1,3]dioxoiane)-2-aminoethane in which R1 and R2 together with the oxygen atoms form a cyclic ketal, an alkali metal hydroxide in glycol, for example, is used.<br>
For 1 mol of acetylpyridine oxime tosylate of the formula (XI), preference is given to using 0.3-3 kg, preferably 0.5-1.5 kg, of the corresponding alcohol. The conversion is effected, for example, within a temperature range of 0-90°C, more preferably at 10-60°C.<br>
After the reaction, a portion of the solvent is initially distilled off, so that the p-toluenesulfonic acid salt by-product precipitates out at room temperature. The distillation is effected by customary methods. The solvent mixture which has been distilled off (distillate) can be reused directly for process step (c).<br>
The p-toluenesulfonic acid alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt is removed by customary filtration methods. The remaining solvent fractions are removed by distillation under atmospheric pressure or preferably under reduced pressure, by customary methods.<br>
The amino ketal derivative of the formula (I) is subsequently optionally isolated in highly pure form either by vacuum distillation or rectification, or by crystallization from the distillation residue obtained in the preceding distillation. For example, a compound of the formula (I) in which Ri and R2 are each methyl can be purified by distillation.<br>
The yield in the vacuum distillation or rectification can optionally be improved by adding a flux to the distillation residue. The term flux refers to a liquid or a waxy solid whose viscosity reduces on heating, thus improving the flow properties of the residue to be distilled, but at the same time has a considerably higher boiling point than the<br><br>
product to be distilled. The flux used is, for example, polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight greater than 400 (for example polyethylene glycol 600 or polyethylene glycol 1000), paraffins (CnH2n+2 where n &gt; 15), polyhydric alcohols (alcohols having more than one OH group, for example glycerol) or esters, for example bis-2-ethyl sebacate.<br>
The crystallization can be effected by customary methods, with or without use of organic solvents. Melt or solvent processes may be used.<br>
The advantages of the process according to the invention are, first, the direct isolation of the compounds of the formula (I) as a free base in high purity and very good yield; second, that the selected reaction conditions allow the oximation and the tosylation reaction to be carried out in a continuous procedure, which always generates only small amounts of the intermediate of the formula (XI) which is relevant from a safety point of view, without isolating the acetylpyridine tosyl oximes which are critical from a safety point of view as a solid, since, after a short delay time, they are converted directly in a continuous apparatus to the amino ketal of the formula (I) which is uncritical from a safety point of view;<br>
the preparation of the compounds of the formula (I) in high purity (greater than 97%) and yield (greater than 75% based on the acetylpyridine used) in the form of the free base in a manner which is suitable for the industrial scale; and fourth, the use of solvent which can be reused directly in the process in pure form or in the form of mixtures, so that the environmental implications are kept very small.<br>

salt solution of 3-acetylpyridine oxime is reacted with 2 g of methyltributylammonium chloride.<br>
1(b) Subsequently, this solution is reacted in a continuous process (recycle method via static mixers with partial withdrawal) with a solution of 193 g of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and 655 g of toluene, up to an internal temperature of 35 - 38°C. The resulting biphasic mixture is then passed through a separating zone and the solvent phase is separated from the aqueous phase.<br>
1(c) The solvent phase is allowed to run directly into an initially charged solution of 940 g of methanol (or methanol/toluene mixture from the 1st solvent distillation, see below) and 216 g of 30% sodium methoxide solution. The temperature is kept within a range of 20 - 40°C. The reaction solution is allowed to continue to react for another 5 -10 hours. The methanol was distilled out of the reaction mixture as an azeotropic mixture together with toluene (1st solvent distillation) at 70 - 90°C and atmospheric pressure. The azeotropic solvent mixture can be reused in the above-described reaction (see above). After the distillation, the distillation residue is cooled to 25°C and the p-toluenesulfonic acid sodium salt is subsequently filtered off and washed with 85 g of toluene. The filtrate is subsequently concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure (approx. 100 - 200 mbar) up to an internal temperature of approx. 120 ■ 130DC. Subsequently, 10 - 20 g of polyethylene glycol 600 are added to the distillation residue and the 1-(3-pyridinyi)-1,1-dimethoxy-2-aminoethane is disttlled off via a short column as a water-clear liquid at 1 -10 mbar at an internal evaporator temperature of 100- 160°C. 157.3 g of 1-(3-pyridinyI)-1,1-dimetho&gt;y-2-amtnoethane are obtained having a purity of 98 - 99% (determined in comparison to a reference standard by means of titration, HPLC-MS and NMR). This corresponds to a yield of 85% of theory, based on the 3-acetylpyridine used.<br>
