A belt spooler<br>
The invention relates to a winding apparatus for producing a lap in which the lap sheet is wound up on a tube which is driven by a revolving endless belt which for this purpose can be inserted into a belt which is formed between two deflection rollers, increases in size with the increasing lap and can be tensioned by a tensioning device, with at least one of the deflection rollers being adjustable in a working position to form the loop and an ejection position into which said deflection roller can be transferred in order to eject the lap by tensioning the belt by removing the loop.<br>
In a winding apparatus known from DE-PS 910 754 of the kind mentioned above, where the tube is loosely inserted into the belt loop for forming the lap, it is necessary that during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller from the working to the ejection position and the changes in the belt length displacements which occur by the tensioning of the belt in sections by removing the loop must be offset by the tensioning device. The tensioning device is primarily designed for a compensation of the belt length displacements which occur in sections during the winding process as a result of the loop which increases in size owing to the increasing lap. This winding apparatus is therefore provided with the particular disadvantage that among other things the speed with which a respective lap can be ejected or with which the lap can be exchanged against a new tube is limited by the speed with which the tensioning device can follow the respective belt length displacements.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved winding apparatus of the kind mentioned above which in combination with a simple and compact design<br><br>
allows the easiest possible and most rapid ejection of the lap and thus allows in particular the quickest exchange of the finished lap against a new tube -<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in that at least one compensating element is provided in addition to the tensioning element, as a result of which at least the largest part of the belt length displacements is compensated which occur in sections during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller from the working to the ejection position and the tensioning of the belt with the removal of the loop, whereas belt length displacements which occur in sections during the winding process as a result of the loop which increases in size owing to the increasing lap are predominantly compensated by the tensioning device.<br>
As the tensioning device is at least predominantly only provided mainly for a compensation of belt length displacements which occur during the winding process as a result of the loop which increases in size owing to the increasing lap, it can be dimensioned in a respective manner without having to take into account any limitations with respect to the fastest possible ejection of the lap. Conversely, as a result of a respective arrangement of the compensating element to be provided in addition it is possible to increase said ejection speed easily and independent from the respective dimensioning of the tensioning device in the desired manner. This also leads in particular to a faster exchange of the finished lap against a new core which is formed by a tube or the like for example. The additional compensating element can thus be designed in particular for a rapid compensation of usually small belt length displacements, whereas the tensioning device can be provided for the slower compensation of<br><br>
larger belt length displacements in larger forces to be exercised. In accordance with the invention it is thus possible to have both a relatively rapid opening of the belt loop as well as an accelerated lap ejection irrespective of the respective tensioning device.<br>
This advantage of a compensation during the opening of the belt loop and the ejection of the lap which is substantially independent of the tensioning device comes to bear in particular in an embodiment which is preferable in practice, in which the tube is rotatable about a fixed axis during the winding process and the belt tension can be predefined at least substantially by the tensioning device during the winding process. In this case the forces which have to be produced during the winding process in particular may also be higher than the weight of the lap. As the additional compensating element can be designed independent from the tensioning device which must be designed with a sufficient size, it is still possible to have a rapid opening of the belt loop as well as a rapid ejection of the lap.<br>
The compensating element can be charged in particular, or only subjected to the influence of gravity. In the first case the compensating element can be charged preferably independent from the tensioning device to produce the respective compensating forces -<br>
Accordingly, pursuant to a preferred practical embodiment the deflection roller which is adjustable between a working and an ejection position is adjustable independent from the tensioning device, which is enabled in particular by a separate drive.<br>
Preferably, at least the largest part of the belt length displacements which occur in sections during the<br><br>
return of the adjustable deflection roller into the working position and/or during the new formation of the loop occurring preferably with the introduction of a new tube are also compensated by the compensating element. In this way it is possible to speed up the entire procedure of the exchange of a lap against a new tube irrespective of the respective dimensioning of the tensioning device-<br>
The loop can extend downwardly in the perpendicular direction for example,which enables an ejection of the lap which is at least mainly horizontal - The loop can also extend in the horizontal direction or be inclined towards the perpendicular.<br>
A particularly simple and sturdy arrangement is obtained when the deflection roller which is adjustable between a working and an ejection position is swivellable about a defined axis by way of a pivoting<br>
lever.<br>
A particularly compact arrangement which even with the swivelled-out pivoting lever requires only a minimum of space is achieved in such a way that the deflection roller which can be pivoted between a working position and an ejection position can be pivoted together with a further deflection roller and that the two deflection rollers are arranged on the pivoting lever at a fixed distance from one another. Accordingly, a compensating element can be formed for example by the further deflection roller which is arranged on the pivoting lever. The two deflection rollers are preferably swivellable in such a way that with the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller into the ejection position and the tensioning of the belt a rolling-off surface for the lap to be ejected is produced which is downwardly inclined towards the horizontal and the<br><br>
further deflection roller is preferably released from the belt in the course of the further pivoting movement.<br>
The defined pivoting axis can be arranged close to and preferably below the zone of the initially fixed rotational axis of the tube - It is principally also possible, however, that the defined pivoting axis is arranged in the zone of the initially fixed rotational axis of the tube or coincides with the same.<br>
In another preferable embodiment of the winding apparatus in accordance with the invention the defined pivoting axis is arranged at a distance from the zone of the initially fixed rotational axis of the tube and the adjustable deflection roller is swivellable over a part of the circumference of the lap in such a way that with its transfer into the ejection position and the tensioning of the belt a rolling-off surface for the lap to be ejected is produced which preferably extends downwardly towards the horizontal and the adjustable deflection roller comes to lie at the end of the pivoting movement in a zone close to a further stationary, horizontally outside deflection roller on its inner side facing the lap to be ejected. Accordingly, not more space is claimed for the pivoting lever and the deflection roller which can be adjusted with the same than has already been provided for the further deflection rollers.<br>
Principally, at least one of the deflection rollers in particular can be arranged displaceably and/or swivellably in order to form a respective compensating element, as a result of which the additional expenditure for the compensating element(s) is reduced to a minimum.<br><br>
Pursuant to an embodiment which is preferred in practice the tensioning of the belt during the winding process, the belt drive, the adjustment of the respective deflection roller between the working position and the ejection position, optionally the charging of the compensating element and/or the discharge of the lap to a conveying device or the like are at least partly automated and controlled by a control device.<br>
In accordance with the invention the aforementioned object is further achieved in such a way that a further deflection roller is held rotatably on a passive swivelling arm by means of which it is downwardly swivellable during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller from the working into the ejection position owing to its own weight and the weight of the passive swivelling arm so as to maintain the respective belt tension or to compensate, as a compensating element, at least a part of the belt length displacements occurring in sections during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller from the working into the ejection position.<br>
Preferably, between the deflection roller which is held on the passive swivelling arm and a further deflection roller which is held rotatably about a fixed axis there is provided a passive deflection roller which is rot a table about a fixed axis and with which the belt comes into contact in particular only during the course of the downwardly facing swivelling movement of the passive swivelling arm.<br>
Favourably, the deflection roller which is held on the passive swivelling arm and forms a compensating element ensures that at least the largest part of belt length displacements are compensated which occur in sections<br><br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a winding apparatus for producing a lap in which the lap sheet is wound up on a tube which is driven by a revolving endless belt which for this purpose can be inserted into a loop of the belt which can be tensioned by a tensioning device, which loop is formed between two deflection rollers and increases in size with increasing lap, with at least one of the deflection rollers being adjustable between a working position provided for the formation of the loop and an ejection position to which said deflection roller can be transferred in order to eject the lap by tensioning the belt with removal of the loop, characterized in that at least one compensating element is provided in addition to the tensioning element, as a result of which at least the largest part of the belt length displacements is compensated which occur in sections during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller from the working to the ejection position and the tensioning of the belt with the removal of the loop, whereas belt length displacements which occur in sections as a result of the loop which increases in size owing to the increasing lap are predominantly compensated by the tensioning device.<br><br><br>
The invention is now explained in closer detail on the basis of embodiments by reference to the drawing, wherein:<br>

Fig. 6 shows a schematic representation of the winding apparatus as shown in fig. 4 in the phase of the insertion of a new tube and<br>
Fig. 7 shows a schematic representation of the basic arrangement of a further embodiment of a winding apparatus in the phase at the beginning of the winding process,<br><br>
Figs - 1 to 3 show in a merely schematic representation a winding apparatus 10 for producing a lap 12. Principally, such a winding apparatus 10 can be used to wind up a fleece, a nonwoven or a lap sheet of fibre material into a lap before the fibre material is subjected to further treatment. Accordingly, the winding apparatus can be used in a combing room, for example, to receive a fleece delivered from a drafting arrangement by way of reversing plates, calender rollers and/or the like, with the produced lap then being supplied to a combing machine. Below reference shall be made for the sake of simplicity to a lap sheet only. This, however, shall not be understood in any limiting sense.<br>
The lap sheet 14 is supplied to the winding apparatus 10 by means of a lap sheet supply means 16 which is formed in the present case by a plate which is bent at the outlet end.<br>
The lap sheet 14 is wound up on a tube H acting as a core, which in the present example is rotatably held about a fixed axis A. Said tube H is driven by a revolving endless belt 18. A loop 20 is formed by the same between two deflection rollers Rl and R2 in which the tube H is received during the winding process.<br>
In the present case the tube H and the formed lap 12 are driven by the belt 18 counter-clockwise, as is indicated by arrow F. The loop 20 of belt 18 which envelopes the tube H and the thus forming lap 12 increases in size with the increasing lap 12, with the belt 18 being tensioned by a tensioning device 22 during the entire winding process. Said tensioning device 22 comprises a belt tensioning roller R4 with associated linear guide means 24.<br><br>
The belt 18 is guided by way of further deflection rollers R3, R5 and R6 and the belt tensioning roller R4, which can be tensioned along the linear guide means 24, in such a way that it is tensioned by way of the belt tensioning roller R4 in one plane which is perpendicular to the plane which comprises the axes of the two deflection rollers Rl and R2. Principally, however, any other guidance of the belts is possible in which the belt is tensioned by way of the belt tensioning roller R4 in a plane for example which is parallel to the plane comprising the axes of the two deflection rollers Rl and R2.<br>
Of the two deflection rollers Rl, R2 which form the loop 20 between themselves the right deflection roller Rl is adjustable between a working position which is provided for forming a loop 20 (cf, fig. 1) and an ejection position (cf. figs. 2 and 3) where the deflection roller Rl can be transferred so as to eject the lap 12 by tensioning the belt 18 under the removal of the loop 20.<br>
As can be seen in figs. 1 to 3, the deflection roller Rl which can be adjusted between a working and an ejection position can be pivoted about a defined or fixed axis B by way of a swivelling lever 26. The other deflection roller R6 is also swivellable together with the deflection roller Rl, which roller R6 is also arranged for this purpose on the swivelling lever 2 6 at a fixed distance from deflection roller Rl. This swivelling lever 2 6 comprises a first lever element 28 which is held at one end swivellable about the axis B and whose other end is connected to a further lever element 30 which is perpendicular to the lever element 28 and on whose two ends the deflection roller Rl and R6, respectively, are arranged. The lever element 28 is connected at one location with the lever element 30<br><br>
which is offset with respect to its centre towards the deflec tion roller R6.<br>
The defined swivelling axis B is provided immediately below the tube H which is arranged in loop 20, and close to and below the zone of the fixed rotational axis A of tube H which is fixed during the winding process.<br>
In accordance with fig. 1 the loop 20 which is produced for forming the loop between the deflection rollers Rl, R2 extends downwardly in the perpendicular direction. The subsequent ejection of the lap 12 occurs at least substantially horizontally (cf. figs. 1 and 2)-<br>
The swivelling lever 26 as arranged and held in the described manner ensures that the two deflection rollers Rl, R6 which are arranged on the same at a fixed distance from one another can be pivoted in such a way that with the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller Rl into the ejection position (cf. figs. 2 and 3) and the tensioning of the belt 18 a downwardly inclined roll-off surface for the finished lap 12 to be ejected is produced towards the horizontal and the further deflection roller R6 is released from the belt 18 in the course of the swivelling movement.<br>
The relevant fact is that in addition to the tensioning device 22 at least one compensating element Ri is provided which is formed for example by at least one of the deflection rollers R2 to R5 and by which the largest part of the belt length displacements occurring in sections during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller Rl from the working to the ejection position and the tensioning of the belt 18 with the removal of the belt 20. Conversely, belt length displacements  which  occur  in  sections  during  the<br><br>
winding process owing to the loop 20 which increases in size as a result of the increasing lap 12 are compensated at least predominantly by the tensioning device 22.<br>
In the present case the further deflection roller R6 which is arranged on the swivelling lever 2 6 forms such a compensating element. Principally, at least one of the deflection rollers R2, R3, R5, R6 can be arranged displaceably and/or swivellably in a respective manner so as to form at least one such compensating element. Preferably, also the largest part of the belt length displacements which occur during the return of the adjustable deflection roller Rl to the working position are compensated by the respective compensating element. Moreover, a compensation of the belt length displacement can advantageously also be effected by means of such a compensating element, as can occur during the new formation of the loop 20 on introducing a new tube H for example.<br>
The respective compensating element can be charged independent of the tensioning device 22 so as to produce the respective compensating forces. Moreover, the deflection roller Rl which can be adjusted between a working and an ejection position is adjustable independently from this tensioning device 22. A separate drive can be provided for this purpose.<br>
As can be seen from figs. 1 to 3, the swivelling lever 2 6 carrying the two deflection rollers Rl and R6 is pivoted downwardly to eject the lap 12. This pivoting into the ejection position as shown in figs. 2 and 3 is thus supported, among other things, by the weight of the swivelling lever arrangement which carries the weight of the deflection rollers Rl, R6. As soon as the lap 12 has been delivered, for example, to a conveying<br><br>
device 40 (cf. figs. 2 and 3) the deflection roller Rl is guided back to the working position as shown in fig. 1 by a return swivel of the swivelling lever 26. A drive which is associated with this swivelling lever arrangement and is independent from the tensioning device 22 can usually be dimensioned smaller, like the means for charging the compensating element, than the tensioning device 22. Considerably higher forces are to be exerted by the same during the winding process, which in the case of a tube H which is rot at able about a fixed axis A during this winding process can in particular be higher than the weight of the lap 12. Moreover, larger belt length displacements usually have to be compensated by this tensioning device 22 during the winding process as is the case by the additional compensating element, of which there is at least one. This element is effective particularly during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller Rl from the working to the ejection position, the tensioning of the belt 18 with the simultaneous removal of the loop 20 and the return of the deflection roller Rl into the working position. The respective compensation by the additional compensating element (at least one) can occur considerably faster than would be possible with the larger dimensioned compensating device 22.<br>
The deflection rollers Rl, R2, R3, R5 and R6 as well as the compensating roller R4 substantially have the same diameter as the respective tube H. The axes of the rollers as well as the tube H inserted into loop 20 are mutually parallel. The belt 18 is driven by the deflection roller R5 which is arranged in the same perpendicular plane as the tensioning device 22 and below the same.<br>
In fig. 1 the belt tensioning roller R4 assumes its upper end position from where it is transferred during<br><br>
the winding process to the lower end position shown in fig. 2, The further deflection roller R3, which is downwardly slightly offset with respect to belt tensioning roller R4 and is disposed between the same and deflection roller R2, is arranged in such a way that the belt 18 always encloses the belt tensioning roller R4 with an angle of belt wrap of 180o, irrespective of its position.<br>
In the present case the tensioning device 22 comprises a cylinder/piston unit which charges the belt tensioning roller R4, by way of which the tensioning roller R4 is adjustable in the perpendicular direction and by means of which the tensioning forces desired during the winding process can be produced.<br>
The lap sheet 14 is supplied by way of a lap sheet feed 16, which is formed in the present case by a plate bent on the outlet side, with the help of calender rollers 34 whose axes are disposed in a curved plane. A gripper arm 36 is held swivellably about an axis D above the deflection roller R2, A new tube H is taken from the upper tube magazine 38 by the arm in the manner as is shown in figs. 1 to 3 and is brought to the position required for the winding process.<br>
During the winding process (cf. fig. 1) the tube H forming the core is then rotated about a fixed axis A as a result of the drive by the belt 18, with the desired belt tension during this winding process being predetermined at least substantially by the tensioning device 22.<br>
The lap sheet is separated after the end of the winding process and prior to the ejection process. This ensures in particular that the lap does not unwind prior to the roll-off process. A possible variant of a separation is<br><br>
that on reaching a predetermined wound-up lap sheet length the supply of lap sheet by the calender rollers is interrupted whereas the belt continues to move for a period of time. This leads to a lap sheet detachment in the zone of the forward calender roller. As a result of a predetermined period in which the completely lap is still rotated by the belt, with the calender rollers being at a standstill, the detachment end can be positioned on a predefined position on the lap.<br>
Thereafter the lever arrangement comprising the swivelling lever 28 as well as the deflection rollers Rl and R6 which are attached to the same are swivelled downwardly in the manner as is shown in fig. 2, whereupon the lap 12 is ejected towards the right substantially in a horizontal manner and is transferred to the conveying device 40. Then a new tube H is inserted in the manner as is shown in fig. 3. At the beginning of the winding process the deflection roller Rl again assumes the upper working position as shown in fig. 1. Moreover, at the beginning of this winding process the belt tensioning roller R4 must again assume its upper end position as shown in fig. 1. The tensioning device 24 is provided at least substantially only for the compensation of belt length displacements which occur in sections during the winding process and which are caused by the loop 20 which increases in size with the increasing lap 12. This tensioning apparatus 22 can thus be dimensioned with a respectively large size. Conversely, the compensation of the usually smaller belt length displacements during the pivoting of the deflection roller Rl and the tensioning of the belt 18 to be made for the ejection of the lap 12 is effected by at least one compensating element Ri which is provided in addition to the tensioning device 22. It ensures in particular a more rapid compensation during<br><br>
the delivery of the lap and/or the insertion of a new tube H.<br>
Also in the further embodiment of a winding apparatus 10 as shown in the figs. 4 to 6 the deflection roller Rl which is adjustable between a working and an ejection position can be pivoted by way of a swivelling lever 32 about a defined axis C.<br>
In contrast to the preceding embodiment, however, the defined swivelling axis C is arranged at a clear distance from the zone of the initially fixed rotational axis A of tube H. Moreover, this swivelling lever 32 only carries the deflection roller Rl which is arranged at the free end of this swivelling lever 32 which at the other end is held swivellably about a defined (i•e, fixed) axis C. This defined swivelling axis C is arranged in the shown roller arrangement pursuant to fig. 5 in the zone of the circumference of the deflection roller R3.<br>
The adjustable deflection roller Rl is swivellable over a part of the circumference of the lap 12 in such a way that with its transfer to the ejection position and the tensioning of the belt 18 a slightly downwardly inclined roll-off surface for the finished lap 12 to be ejected is produced towards the horizontal and the adjustable deflection roller Rl comes to lie at the end of the swivelling movement in a zone close to a further, horizontally outer deflection roller R6' on its inner side facing the lap 12 to be ejected. Instead of the deflection roller R6 in the preceding embodiment which can be swivelled jointly with the deflection roller Rl, a deflection roller R6* is provided in the present case which can also be stationary for example. In any case, this deflection roller R6' need no longer be pivoted in a respective manner together with the<br><br>
deflection roller R1 in order to open loop 20. At least one of the deflection rollers R2, R3, R5, R6 and R6' and/or at least one further deflection roller or the like can be used again as a compensating element and can be displaceable and/or swivellable in a respective manner. Thus it is principally also possible to arrange the deflection roller R6' displaceably and/or swivellably in order to form at least one compensating element. In addition or alternatively to said deflection roller RG' it is also possible that at least one further deflection roller forms such a compensating element Ri. After pivoting the swivelling lever 32 downwardly, the deflection roller Rl is arranged to the left next to the deflection roller R6' and slightly above the same (cf. figs. 5 and 6). A highly compact arrangement is achieved despite the swivellable arrangement of the deflection roller Rl.<br>
As can be recognized on the basis of figs, 4 to 6, the calender rollers 34, by way of which the lap sheet 14 is supplied to the lap sheet feeding means 16 formed by a bent plate, lie in a common plane.<br>
Moreover, the embodiment shown in figs, 4 to 6 has at least substantially the same arrangement as the winding apparatus described above in connection with figs. 1 to 3, with the same parts being assigned the same reference numerals.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the winding apparatus 10 again in the phase at the beginning of the winding process when the loop 20 is formed and the deflection roller Rl is swivelled upward in a respective manner.<br>

A deflection roller R6", which is held rotatably on a passive swivelling arm 44, is provided in this winding apparatus 10 instead of the deflection roller R6 or R6' used in the aforementioned embodiments. The deflection roller R6" is downwardly swivellable by means of this passive swivelling arm 4 4 during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller Rl from the working to the ejection position as a result of its own weight and the<br><br>
weight of the passive swivelling arm 44. It is thus used as a compensating element by which the required belt tension is maintained or at least a part of the belt length displacements which occur in sections during the transfer of the adjustable deflection roller Rl from the working to the ejection position is compensated,<br>
A passive deflection roller R7 which is rotatable about a fixed axis G and with which the belt 18 comes into contact in the course of the downwardly facing swivelling movement of the passive swivelling arm is provided between deflection roller R6" held on the passive swivelling arm 44 and the further deflection roller R3 which is rotatably held about a fixed axis E.<br>
As a result of the deflection roller R6" which is held on the passive swivelling arm 4 4 and forms the compensating element, at least the largest part of the belt length displacements are compensated which occur in sections during the return of the adjustable deflection roller Rl into the working position and/or during the new formation of the loop 20 which preferably occurs with the insertion of a new tube H.<br>
The passive swivelling arm 44 is rotatably held at one end about a fixed axis E of the further deflection roller R3. It carries the deflection roller R6" at the free end, which deflection roller is used in the present case as a compensating element.<br>
The deflection roller Rl which is adjustable between a working and an ejection position is swivellable about a defined axis by way of a swivelling lever 42 with associated drive 4 6, which axis coincides in the present case with the initially fixed rotational axis A of tube H. The deflection roller Rl can be pivoted<br><br>
downwardly as soon as a lock 56 blocking the swivelling lever 42 is deactivated- In the present case the lock 56 is acuated by a cylinder/piston unit 56. The drive associated with the swivelling lever 42 can comprise at least one cylinder/piston unit for example.<br>
The lap sheet feed is made by way of several calender rollers 34, with at least one calender roller 34^ being preferably adjustable from its working position, in particular being swivellable- A piston/cylinder unit 48 is provided in the present case to swivel the respective calender roller 342- Adjustable or swivellable calender rollers can principally also be provided in the embodiments described above.<br>
In the present case the belt tensioning device 22 comprises a tensioning roller R4' which can be swivelled by a swivelling arm 50- The swivelling arm 50 is adjustable by means of a drive 52 which can comprise again at least one cylinder/piston unit for example.<br>
The deflection roller R2 and the calender rollers 34 are driven by a main motor 54 and an associated gear-<br>
In the aforementioned embodiments the loop 20 extends downwardly in the perpendicular direction. Principally, however, a loop extending in the horizontal direction or a vertically inclined loop are possible.<br><br>
