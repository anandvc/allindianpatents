TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"Improved Ceramic Proppant. System for Production and Process<br>
thereof"<br>
(a) Ajay Kumar Dasgupta<br>
(b) residing at L 4 SHIVNAGRI, KOTHRUD, PUNE 411038 State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the ceramic proppants. In particular the invention relates to an energy efficient system and process of manufacturing the same using Raw/ naturally occurring / as mined / uncalcined Bauxite as a raw material.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the productivity of gas wells in low permeability reservoirs by creating deeply penetrating fractures in the producing formation surrounding the well. The fracture is created by pumping a viscous fluid through perforations in the well casing or in the uncased section of the well. In this process a fluid with sand in suspension is pumped under high pressure into the producing zone of an oil or natural gas well in order to stimulate and enhance recovery. This suspension serves to enlarge existing openings and create new voids through which the oil or gas can move freely towards the producing well. When the fluid is withdrawn the silica sand remains to hold the fractures open, thereby acting as a Proppant.<br>
The major requirement of Proppant is that it should be well rounded with a high degree of sphericity, to allow ease of placement in the formation and provide maximum permeability. The proppant should also be uniform in size, having a high compressive strength, be dry, non-agglomerated, unfractured, clean and free of contaminant minerals such as feldspar, clay and calcite. In order to ensure these properties, specification usually demand a hydrochloric acid solubility of less than 3% and a withstanding elevated temperature in the well. Thus most desirable properties for propping agents in the hydraulic fracturing of subterranean formations at considerable depth are: high permeability at high formation pressures, high compressive strength, high acid resistance, low specific gravity. The two most desirable properties of a proppant are very high strength and low specific gravity.<br>
In view of this constitutes of the proppant such as Bauxite and clay are of paramount importance. Bauxite is the most important aluminium ore. It consists largely of the<br><br><br>
minerals gibbsite AI(OH)3, boehmite Y-AIO(OH), and diaspore a-AIO(OH), together with the iron oxides goethite and hematite, the clay mineral kaolinite and small amounts of anatase TiO2.<br>
It is to be noted that the cost of production of the ceramic proppant depends on selection of the raw material and the process for preparation of the same, in particular the process of calcination. It is always desirable to select locally available raw material. Further as the processes involved in the production of proppant are energy intensive, it is desirable to judiciously use the energy and achieve energy efficiency so as to reduce cost of production.<br>
Various attempts are reported in literature regarding proppants and method of manufacturing the same. It is as follows:<br>
United States Patent 4713203 discloses a superior proppant having very high permeability at formation pressures up to 20,000 psi, very high compressive strength, low specific gravity, and good acid resistance, is produced by a process comprising: (a) separating a fine fraction from a naturally occurring bauxite containing same; (b) pelletizing the separated fine fraction in the presence of water; (c) treating the pellets produced in step (b) to remove water therefrom; and (d) sintering the product of step (c) to produce a low density material suitable for use as a proppant.<br>

United States Patent 4547468 discloses an invention in respect of hollow, fine-grained ceramic proppants are less expensive and improve fracture control when compared to conventional proppants (dense alumina, mullite, bauxite, zirconia, etc.). Hollow proppants of the present invention have been fabricated by spray drying, followed by<br><br><br>
sintering in order to obtain a dense case and a hollow core. These proppants generally have high sphericity and roundness (Krumbein sphericity and roundness greater than 0.8), have diameters on average between 2250 and 125 urn, depending on proppant size required, and have strength equal to or greater than that of sand. The hollow core, the size of which can be controlled, permits better fracture control in hydraulic fracturing treatments since the proppant can be transported in lower viscosity fluids. Hollow proppants produced at the same cost/weight as conventional proppants also provide for lower costs, since less weight is required to fill the same volume. The fine-grained (preferably less than 5 urn in diameter) ceramic case provides the strength necessary to withstand closure stresses and prevent crushing.<br>

temporarily stopping the material to increase residence time in a particular temperature zone of the kiln; lifter in the form of projections provided along the axis of the said kiln at particular temperature zone for soaking as well as for dispersing the partially sintered material for proper heat transfer. It is to be noted that to achieve energy efficiency, the air provided to the said cooler which in turn gets heated while passing through the cooler is provided as secondary air for kiln firing, thereby providing pre-heated air rather ambient temperature air resulting in better energy efficiency.<br>
Thus it is evident from the present invention that the stages or pre-calcination and the judiciouscombination of various system components such as noduliser, rounting of the kiln exhaust to double drum dryer, novel use of cooler air in the kiln and the use of adjustable rings and lifters in the rotary kiln results in a system and energy efficient process to produce the ceramic proppant utilizing the available abandoned quantity of locally available raw bauxite in particular in India terrain by providing process that overcomes the problems related to the fine dispersion of iron oxides, kaolinitic clay, calcium and titanium mineral in the crystal lattice which makes the impurity liberation a very difficult process; blend the bauxite from various mines suitably to get the exact raw mix for ceramic proppant obviating the use of calcined bauxite as a raw material.<br><br><br><br></td>
