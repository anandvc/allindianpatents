				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to water-soluble carboxymethylcelluloses<br>
(CMCs) that exhibit unique and highly desirable rheology and performance in<br>
end use systems and to a process for the preparation thereof. The CMCs of the<br>
present invention exhibit associative behavior both in neat solutions and in filled<br>
systems. The association is shear reversible, which enhances utility.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is one of the most versatile and widely<br>
used cellulose ethers as a component for aqueous systems. It may act as a<br>
suspending agent, thickening agent, protective colloid, humectant, and for the<br>
control of crystallization of some other components. CMC is physiologically inert<br>
and is an anionic polyelectrolyte. The above noted characteristics makes CMC<br>
suitable for use in a wide spectrum of applications in the food, pharmaceutical,<br>
personal care; paper, building materials and construction, oilfield, and other<br>
industries.<br>
There are many types of commercial CMCs available varying with respect<br>
to average degree of polymerization and substitution. The chemical and<br>
physical properties of the CMCs depend not only on the average degree of<br>
polymerization and substitution, but also on the overall solubility of the CMC as<br>
well as the distribution of carbomethoxy substituents along the cellulose chains.<br>
Both smoothly and blocky substituted CMCs are well known in the art. Blocky<br>
CMCs can be produced by lowering DS and/or changing the manufacturing<br>
process. However, processes that target a blocky CMC produce CMCs with<br>
limited solubility. In many cases a substantial portion of the CMC forms a<br>
swollen gel in aqueous applications. Such gels are undesirable in many<br>
applications, such as toothpaste, where the gel structure imparts an undesirable<br>
gel appearance in the toothpaste.<br>
US Patent Re 32,976 discloses a smoothly substituted, enzyme and salt<br>
resistant CMC which is prepared using an etherification agent which comprises<br>
at least 50% isopropyl monochloroacetate. Smoothly substituted CMCs will not<br>
provide the associative properties of the current invention. The CMCs of the<br>
present invention are prepared from monochloroacetic acid or sodium<br>
chloroacetate, not isopropyl monochloroacetate.<br>
US Patent No. 4,579,943 discloses a CMC that has high liquid absorbing<br>
property that is derived from regenerated cellulose, having cellulose II form. The<br>
CMCs are of relatively low DS (0.1-0.64) and are substantially insoluble in water.<br>
The CMCs of the current invention are derived from cellulose I, not cellulose II or<br>
regenerated cellulose.<br>
Publication WO 99/20657 discloses a CMC that has a tan delta of less<br>
than 1.0 at a concentration of 0.5 % under specific testing conditions. The CMC<br>
of the current invention do not have a tan delta less than 1.0 at 0.5%<br>
concentration.<br>
The publication by G. Mann, J. Kunze, F. Loth and H-P fink of Fraunhofer<br>
Institutfur Angewandte Polymerforschung entitled "Cellulose ethers with a Blocklike<br>
Distribution of the Substituents by Structure-selective Derivatization of<br>
Cellulose", Polymer, vol. 39, No. 14, pp. 3155-3165, Published 1998, discloses<br>
the preparation and testing of block-like distribution of CMC. The CMC is<br>
prepared by a step-by-step etherification reaction where a systematic<br>
carboxymethylation in alcohol-water medium is conducted while maintaining a<br>
low NaOH concentration (NaOH/AGU molar ratio 
formed at elevated temperatures (50 - 70° C). It is reported that this process<br>
produces block-like cellulose ethers, including CMC, or cellulose etheresters with<br>
alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic as well as various ionic chain segments.<br>
The CMCs are swollen particles in water and are not substantially soluble. The<br>
CMCs of the present invention are produced at higher NaOH/AGU ratios (about<br>
1.1 to about 1.9) and low alkali cellulose temperatures (20 - 30° C), and are<br>
substantially soluble in water.<br>
There is still a need for an associative, thixotropic CMC that exhibits<br>
associative behavior both in neat solutions and in filled systems. The<br>
association would be shear reversible, which would enhance utility. Such<br>
rheology would provide high thickening efficiency, and stabilize emulsions and<br>
suspensions, yet allow processing advantages such as ease of pumping or<br>
spreading, due to the reversible shear thinning characteristics of the associative<br>
network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a composition comprising CMC having<br>
a relative urea/water ratio of less than about 0.9. The relative urea ratio is<br>
defined as:<br>
Relative Viscosity in 6M Urea = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in 6M = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in<br>
urea 6M urea<br>
6M urea viscosity 1.4 cP<br>
Relative Viscosity in Water = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in<br>
Water 6M urea<br>
Water viscosity 0.89 cP<br>
Relative Urea/Water Ratio = Relative Viscosity in 6M Urea<br>
Relative Viscosity in Water<br>
This invention is also directed to a process for making a CMC comprising<br>
a) reacting in an aqueous slurry of isopropyl alcohol, a source of cellulose, and<br>
about 50 - 80% of the stoichiometric level of alkali for a sufficient time and at a<br>
sufficient temperature to form an alkali cellulose b) adding sufficient alkali to<br>
bring the total alkali concentration to stoichiometric levels, followed by addition of<br>
the requisite amount of etherification agent, c) completing the etherification<br>
reaction and optionally, d) adjusting final molecular weight/viscosity by addition<br>
of oxidizing agents capable of degrading cellulosic chains.<br>
This invention also comprehends the use of the CMC of the present<br>
invention in an aqueous rheology modifier system as a vehicle component of a<br>
personal care, household care, plaint, building material, construction,<br>
pharmaceutical, oilfield, food, paper making or paper coating composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A CMC has been surprisingly discovered that exhibits unique and highly<br>
desirable rheology and performance properties in end use systems.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the viscosity builds up not only<br>
by means conventional to CMC, but also is boosted significantly by molecular<br>
association. The association leads to network formation and gel-like rheological<br>
properties. The fact that the association is shear reversible enhances utility.<br>
The CMCs of the present invention have been shown to lower the CMC<br>
use level needed and to provide rheology attributes unique from other CMCs<br>
available today. The unique rheology provides high thickening efficiency, and<br>
stabilizes emulsions and suspensions. The CMCs of the present invention<br>
provide significantly enhanced performance over known CMCs in aqueous<br>
systems including personal care formulations (e.g., toothpaste, skin care, and<br>
hair care), medical care (e.g., wound care and ostomy,), food applications (i.e.,<br>
tortillas, cake mixes, bread mixes, bread, ice cream, sour cream, pasteurized<br>
processed cheese spreads, and cheese foods), beverages (i.e., instant cold/hot<br>
drinks, ready to drink beverages, and fruit flavored drinks), paint systems,<br>
building and construction materials (such as joint formulations), mineral<br>
processing, oil field formulations (e.g., drilling fluids), paper making and paper<br>
coating formulations, household formulations (e.g., laundry detergents, fabric<br>
softeners), and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, when the composition is a<br>
personal care composition, it includes (a) from about 0.1 % to about 99.0 % by<br>
weight of the vehicle component and (b) at least one active personal care<br>
ingredient. Examples of the at least one active personal care ingredient are<br>
deodorant, skin coolants, emollients, antiperspirant actives, moisturizing agents,<br>
cleansing agents, sunscreen actives, hair treatment agents, oral care agents,<br>
tissue paper products, and beauty aids.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the composition is a household<br>
care composition, it includes (a) from about 0.1 % to about 99.0 % by weight of<br>
the vehicle component and (b) at least one active household care ingredient.<br>
Examples of the at least one active household care ingredient are industrial<br>
grade bar, gel and liquid soap actives, all purpose cleaning agents, disinfecting<br>
ingredient, rug and upholstery cleaning actives, laundry softeners actives,<br>
laundry detergent ingredients, dishwashing detergents, toilet bowl cleaning<br>
agents and fabric sizing agents.<br>
In addition to the ingredients conventionally used in the personal care and<br>
household care, the composition according to the present invention can<br>
optionally also include ingredients such as a colorant, preservative, antioxidant,<br>
nutritional supplements, activity enhancer, emulsifiers, viscosifying agents (such<br>
as salts, i.e., NaCI, NHUCI &amp; KCI, water-soluble polymers, i.e.,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, and fatty alcohols, i.e., cetyl alcohol), alcohols having 1-6<br>
carbons, and fats and oils.<br>
The CMCs may also be used in combination with other known rheology<br>
modifiers including, but not limited to, polysaccharides (e.g., carrageenan, guar,<br>
hyaluronicacid, glucosaminoglycan, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydrophobically<br>
modified hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose, cationic guar,<br>
carbomer), biopolymers (e.g., xanthan), synthetic polymers (polyethylene glycol,<br>
polyvinylacetate, chlorohexidiene), and thickening silicas.<br>
The use of CMC in toothpaste formulations is well known in the<br>
toothpaste industry as a binder system for toothpaste that gives the toothpaste a<br>
desirable high structure. The binder system includes CMC types with other<br>
polysaccharides, inorganic salts, chelating agents and combinations thereof.<br>
Commercially available CMC types vary in the degree of structure they<br>
provide to the toothpaste. Highly thixotropic grades of CMC tend to render<br>
toothpaste of higher structure. These thixotropic CMC types also tend to<br>
contribute to greater post-thickening.<br>
Cellulose gum (CMC) alone has been a traditional binder for toothpaste.<br>
In toothpaste, CMC provides viscosity, stand-up or structure, and syneresis<br>
control. Toothpaste made with CMC is also known to have a slow rate in<br>
viscosity build up over the shelf life of the toothpaste thus not reaching a stable<br>
viscosity until after first 30 days or more. This is also called "post-thickening".<br>
Other binders commonly used in toothpaste are carrageenan or<br>
carrageenan and xanthan together. Carrageenan and xanthan provide good<br>
stand-up, viscosity and syneresis control; however, they tend to be more<br>
expensive alternatives as compared to CMC. Toothpaste made with<br>
carrageenan and xanthan tend to exhibit a stable viscosity rather quickly after<br>
processing and little post-thickening.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the CMC of the present<br>
invention can be use either alone or in combination with other polysaccharides,<br>
synthetic polymers and or salts and provide high efficiencies and enhanced<br>
performance. See the toothpaste Examples hereinafter for the demonstration of<br>
the unexpected results of the present invention.<br>
Use of the CMCs of the present invention have allowed a use level<br>
reduction of about 40% while maintaining critical toothpaste properties such as<br>
stand-up, gloss and syneresis control. The lower use levels and/or shear<br>
thinning behavior of the CMCs may offer additional advantages to toothpaste<br>
properties such as improved flavor release, improved actives delivery, improved<br>
fluoride delivery, higher gloss, improved extrudability from the tube, and<br>
improved anti-microbial effectiveness. Potential improvements to the toothpaste<br>
manufacturing process include, but are not limited to, reduction of entrapped air<br>
during manufacturing process, improvements in mixing operations, and<br>
improvements in extrusion into tubes.<br>
Water-based protective coating compositions (commonly referred to as<br>
paints) in which cellulose ether derivatives are conventionally used include latex<br>
paints or dispersion paints, of which the principal ingredients are film-forming<br>
lattices such as styrenebutadiene copolymers, vinyl acetate polymers and<br>
copolymers, and acrylic polymers and copolymers. Typically, they also contain<br>
opacifying pigments, dispersing agents and water-soluble protective colloids, the<br>
proportions being, by weight of the total composition, about 10 parts to about 50<br>
parts of a latex, about 10 parts to about 50 parts of an opacifying pigment, about<br>
0.1 part to about 2 parts of a dispersing agent, and about 0.1 part to about 2<br>
parts of a water-soluble protective colloid.<br>
Water soluble protective colloids conventionally used in the manufacture<br>
of latex paints (to stabilize the lattices and maintain the wet edge of a painted<br>
area longer in use) include casein, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose<br>
(HEC), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinyl alcohol, starch, and<br>
sodium polyacrylate. The disadvantages of the natural based cellulose ethers<br>
are that they may be susceptible to biological degradation and frequently impart<br>
poor flow and leveling properties, while the synthetic materials such as polyvinyl<br>
alcohol often lack enough thickening efficiency to maintain sag resistance. The<br>
thickening efficiency of the cellulose ethers is usually improved by increasing<br>
their molecular weight which normally is more expensive.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the CMC of the present<br>
invention can be used in lower amounts in paints and provide unexpected high<br>
quality results. This is illustrated in the working Examples hereinafter.<br>
The CMCs of the present invention are prepared using conventional slurry<br>
process methods. For example, isopropyl alcohol, water, and about 50 -80% of<br>
the stoichiometric amount of NaOH are reacted with cellulose at a temperature<br>
of about 20°C for a sufficient time to produce alkali cellulose, about 1.5 hours.<br>
Sufficient NaOH is added to bring the total NaOH level to or slightly above<br>
stoichiometric levels and monochloroacetic acid is added shortly after the<br>
second NaOH addition. The reaction conditions are normally to raise the<br>
temperature to about 70°C for about one to two hours to effect etherification.<br>
The molecular weight and viscosity of the CMC can be adjusted (reduced) by<br>
addition of an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, subsequent to<br>
etherification. The reaction mass is then optionally cooled, excess base<br>
neutralized, if necessary, and the product is washed. This product can then be<br>
dried and ground. The critical feature of this invention is that the amount of alkali<br>
utilized to effect etherification is less than stoichiometric and that the remaining<br>
alkali is added just prior to the etherification agent. The degree of substitution of<br>
the CMC is about 0.6 to about 1.2.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the CMC can be differentiated<br>
from prior art CMCs by their being substantially soluble in aqueous media<br>
environments and their behavior in environments that do not favor association. It<br>
is a known fact that urea breaks up association by breaking hydrogen bonds.<br>
The subject CMCs exhibit a viscosity decrease in the presence of urea, as<br>
determined by the relative urea ratio. The relative urea ratio is defined as:<br>
Relative Viscosity in 6M Urea = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in 6M = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in<br>
urea 6M urea<br>
6M urea viscosity 1.4 cP<br>
Relative Viscosity in Water = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in = Dynamic Viscosity of 1 % CMC in<br>
Water 6M urea<br>
Water viscosity 0.89 cP<br>
Relative Urea/Water Ratio = Relative Viscosity in 6M Urea<br>
Relative Viscosity in Water<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are merely set forth for illustrative purposes, but it<br>
is to be understood that other modifications of the present invention within the<br>
skill of an artisan in the related industry can be made without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. All percentages and parts are by weight unless<br>
specifically stated otherwise.<br>
Example 1<br>
Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 696.67g) and deionized (Dl) water (76.945g) were<br>
charged into a jacketed resin kettle reactor equipped with an air driven stirrer,<br>
stainless steel agitator, a pressure equalizing addition funnel, a reflux condenser,<br>
vacuum, nitrogen inlet and a thermocouple. A cellulose pulp (65.0g, 6.4%<br>

adjusted to obtain good mixing. The reactor was inerted and the mixture was<br>
cooled to 20°C.<br>
Aqueous NaOH (50%, 60.92g) was slowly added to the reactor through<br>
the addition funnel, maintaining the mixture slurry temperature at 20°C. The<br>
reaction mixture was held for 1 hour at 20°C after the caustic addition was<br>
completed.<br>
Aqueous NaOH (50%, 16.02g) was slowly added to the reactor through<br>
the addition funnel, maintaining the mixture slurry temperature at 20°C. The<br>

After MCA addition was completed, the reaction slurry was heated to 70°C and<br>
held for 1.5 hours. The reaction slurry was filtered and the resulting wet cake<br>
was washed three times with 565g of 80% aqueous methanol and one time with<br>
1000g of pure methanol. The resulting wet cake was broken into small particles<br>
and dried in a fluidized bed dryer for 35 minutes. (Air-dry for 5 minutes, heat-dry<br>

After MCA addition was completed, the reaction slurry was heated to 70°C and<br>
held for 1.5 hours. 1.6 ml of 6% H202 was added to the reactor and the slurry<br>
was heated at 70°C for 30 minutes. The reaction slurry was filtered and the<br>
resulting wet cake was washed three times with 565g of 80% aqueous methanol<br>
and one time with 1000g of pure methanol. The resulting wet cake was broken<br>

Example 3<br>
Isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 123.4 gallons), water (130.3 Ibs), methanol (6.36<br>
gallons), and NaOH (flake, 35.4 Ibs.) were charged into the reactor. The reactor<br>
was inerted and the caustic/solvent mix was cooled to about 20°C, at which time<br>
a cellulose pulp (108lbs, 4% moisture) was added to the reactor. The agitation<br>
was adjusted to give good mixing in the slurry and the slurry was recooled to<br>
about 20°C. The reaction slurry was held for 1 hour at 20°C.<br>
Aqueous NaOH (50%, 58.7 Ibs.) was added to the reactor and the<br>
reaction mixture was held for 15 minutes at 20°C after the caustic addition was<br>

Example 11<br>
This Example illustrates the behavior of the preparations of a 1.0% CMC<br>
samples of the present invention in a 6.0 M urea solution.<br>
The 1 % CMC solution was prepared in the following equipment:<br>
Caframo RZR1 overhead stirrer, 8-oz. glass jars, stainless steel<br>
stirring shaft with two 3-blade propellers (1.5 inch diameter),<br>
Parafilm®, deionized (Dl) water, Germaben II.<br>
A 0.50% Germaben solution was prepared by adding the Germaben II to<br>
Dl water. This solution was then weighed into an 8-oz. glass jar. The solution<br>
was then stirred with an overhead stirrer, while the CMC was quickly added to<br>
the solution. The CMC level is 1.0% of the final sample weight. CMC weight is<br>
corrected for moisture content. As the viscosity begins to increase, the speed of<br>
the stirrer was increased to the maximum rate that does not cause splashing out<br>
of the sample. The jar is covered with Parafilm while mixing to prevent<br>
evaporation of water and loss from splashing. The sample is stirred for one<br>
hour. After one hour of stirring at the highest rate, the stirring speed was<br>
decreased to a setting of 4 for one additional hour. The sample was centrifuged<br>
for approximately 5 minutes to remove trapped air.<br>
The behavior of the samples were studied in the following equipment:<br>

The flavor was mixed in the same way. After all formula components were<br>
together, the mixture was mixed under vacuum for 15 minutes at high speed.<br>
The batch was then packed into 2-oz. jars and 6-oz. toothpaste tubes.<br>
Toothpaste samples were stored for 30 days at room temperature.<br>
Samples were equilibrated in a 25°C water bath for 4 hours prior to any tests<br>
conducted.<br>
Viscosity was measured using a Brookfield DV-I fitted with a T-bar style<br>
spindle. A helipath stand was used to allow the spindle to sweep downward<br>
through the sample to prevent the effects of shear. Viscosity was taken every 30<br>
seconds over 2 minutes and values were averaged.<br>
Toothpaste consistency was measured using a rack test. The rack<br>
designed with cross bars of increasing distance apart left to right. The<br>
toothpaste tube containing the sample to be measured is fitted with a stainless<br>
orifice fitting to eliminate differences in orifice size that may occur. The tube is<br>
squeezed in a uniform manner across the rack, extruding the paste onto the rack<br>
in a ribbon. After 15 seconds it is recorded at which opening the ribbon has<br>
fallen through the opening and broken. The opening number from left to right is<br>
the value recorded as a "Cuban" value.<br>
The toothpaste data are summarized in Table 2.<br>

Example 14<br>
The CMC's of the present invention in combination with other polymers<br>
exhibit decreased post thickening and structure build and enhanced initial<br>
structure in toothpaste formulations.<br>
Viscosity is one measure of post-thickening in toothpaste. Toothpaste<br>
samples were packed into vials and the viscosity was measured using a<br>
Brookfield DV-I fitted with a T-bar style spindle. A helipath stand was used to<br>
allow the spindle to sweep downward through the sample to prevent the effects<br>
of shear. Viscosity was taken every 30 seconds over 2 minutes and values were<br>
averaged<br>
It can be seen from the data in the graph (Figure 1) that most samples<br>
exhibited a change in viscosity from the first day after processing through 30<br>
days. When the data are normalized to the initial viscosity as 100%, the change<br>
over time is more apparent (Figure 2). Toothpaste made with combinations of<br>
Example 7 CMC with other polysaccharides or inorganic salts exhibited lower<br>
post-thickening compared to toothpaste made with Example 7 alone.<br>
Toothpaste structure is also an important aspect. This property may be<br>
measured by force required for compression using a MTS Servo Hydraulic test<br>
system from MTS Systems Corporation, Minneapolis, MN. The instrument was<br>
fitted with a half-inch acrylic cylinder probe, toothpaste samples were packed<br>
into vials after processing and measured directly without disturbance.<br>
It can be seen below in Table 3 that the Example 7 CMC alone or with<br>
other polysaccharides or inorganic salt produced toothpaste of similar or greater<br>
initial structure compared to toothpaste made with carrageenan and xanthan and<br>
much greater initial structure than toothpaste made with commercial CMC<br>
9M31F.<br>
Peak force of compression was monitored over 30 days. It was found that<br>
most samples changed in values (Figure 3). The comparison can be made more<br>
Example 12<br>
Dynamic viscosities were measured using at 25°C using an RFS III<br>
strained controlled rheometer by Rheometrics using a 40 mm parallel tool<br>
geometry with the gap set at 2 mm. The samples were pre-sheared at 100s"1 for<br>
60 second upon loading to erase the loading history. The pre-shearing was<br>
followed by the steady shear experiment between 0.01 and 100s"1. Each point<br>
data is the average of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations each with the<br>
duration of 20 sec. All samples exhibited a low shear Newtonian plateau, the<br>
average of which was used in the data analysis and further comparisons. The<br>
dynamic viscosities of the aqueous and 6M 1% CMC solutions are summarized<br>
in Table 1. The relative urea/water ratios are also summarized in Table 1,<br>
above.<br>

Standard laboratory toothpaste preparation was performed. Salts were<br>
first dissolved in part of the water and warmed for complete dissolution. The<br>
CMC was dispersed in the sorbitol, using an overhead mixer with a propeller<br>
attachment. After the CMC was well dispersed, the balance of the water was<br>
added with continued mixing until the CMC appeared dissolved. The warm salt<br>
solution was mixed into the CMC solution. This was then transferred to a 1-quart<br>
Ross double planetary mixer. The calcium carbonate was then stirred in the<br>
mixer, and after it was well dispersed, a vacuum was applied. After mixing under<br>
vacuum for 20 minutes, the sodium lauryl sulfate was mixed in without vacuum.<br>
easily if the data are normalized to the initial structure value as 100% as<br>
shown in Figure 4. From the normalized data of Figure 4, it can be seen that<br>
toothpaste samples made with combinations of CMC of Example 7 with other<br>
polysaccharides or inorganic salt have lower structure build over time.<br>
From the work outlined here, it can be concluded that toothpaste with high<br>
structure and low post-thickening can be made with CMCs of the present<br>
invention in combination with other polysaccharides, inorganic salts or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>

Experimental Procedures:<br>
All ingredients were sieved through a 20 mesh screen. All ingredients<br>
except magnesium were then dry blended in a 4 quart low shear Hobart mixer<br>
for 2 minutes. Thereafter water was added at a rate of 100 g/min while using<br>
low speed stirring. A total of 500ml per 1500 g of powder was added to the<br>
formulations containing Klucel. This was increased to 700g for Natrosol<br>
containing formulations. The wet masses were tray dried at 60°C down to less<br>
than 2 % moisture content. Following the drying step, the granulations were<br>
milled using the Fitzpatrick Comminutor Fitzmill at 2300 rpm, knives forward.<br>
The reduced granulation was then lubricated by addition of 0,5% magnesium<br>
stearate. This final mix was blended for 3 minutes in a V-blender.<br>
Compactibility:<br>
As shown in Figure 5 for both model formulations, the inclusion of<br>
Example 7 CMC in place of CMC 12M8 pH in the tablet matrix results in a<br>
significant increase in tablet crushing strength.<br>
Drug Release Kinetics<br>
While compactibility is improved, inclusion of Example 7 CMC does not<br>
manifest in significant differences in the release kinetics when compared to<br>
12M8 pH. This shown in figures 6 and 7 for both highly soluble drug<br>
(phenylpropanolamine) and a sparingly soluble drug (Theophylline). Additionally<br>
no differences were evident at pH 1.5 or 6.8 between the Example 7 CMC and<br>
CMC 12M8 containing formulations.<br>
Example 19<br>
The CMC's of the present invention exhibit enhanced thickening<br>
efficiency, enchanced high shear viscosity (ICI), improved spatter resistance and<br>
improved water resistance in paint formulations.<br>

Spatter Resistance - Roller:<br>
The following equipment was used to evaluate the samples:<br>
paint roller with synthetic fibers e.g. verfroller 15 cm art.nr. 32913 ex Van<br>
Vliet Kwastenfabriek<br>
wall paper (woodchip quality) e.g. Erfurt Raufaser 52<br>
Procedure:<br>
About 200 grams of paint is taken up by the roller. Paint is applied on a<br>
woodchip wallpaper with dimensions 100 x 50 cm placed in vertical position.<br>
Paint is applied by ten- up and down strokes with the roller. A piece of black<br>
carch paper is placed horizontally 50 cm below the bottom line of the wallpaper.<br>
The amount of spatter that is intercepted on the black paper is compared to a<br>
series of reference charts rating from 1 to 10. A rating of 1 means severe spatter<br>
and a rating of 10 stands for completely spatter free.<br>
Water Retention (According GRIMSHAW)<br>
Equipment used in this part of the experment is:<br>
Substrate: Whatman No. 1 circular<br>
Filter paper (diameter 12.5 cm)<br>
Clamp ring inner diameter 7.7 cm<br>
outer diameter 12.6 cm<br>
Pasteur pipette (poly ethylene disposable)<br>
Colorant: Quink parket permanent block ink<br>
Balance<br>
Procedure<br>
1. Mix a blend of paint/colorant thoroughly in an aluminum cup.<br>
Depending on the viscosity the following ratio's can be chosen:<br>
Paint: colorant 50:50<br>
60:40<br>
75:25<br>
Total amount 4-5 grams<br>
2. Put the filter paper between two clamp rings and fix these with paper clips.<br>
3. Weigh the clamped filter paper and apply with a Pasteur pipette 0.5 or 1.0<br>
gram (depending the fluidity of the colored point blob) on the center of the<br>
filter paper.<br>
4. Allow an overnight drying at room temperature.<br>
5. Measure with a ruler the shaded stain round the paint center on 6 different<br>
spots.<br>
6. The average expressed in mm is a measure for the water retention. A low<br>
value means a good water retention.<br>
7. Report the used test conditions, ratio and amount of paint as well as the<br>
increase of the stain in mm.<br>
