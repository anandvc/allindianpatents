				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for outdoor cultivation of microalga Botryococcus species useful for its mass cultivation. In general, the present invention relates to microalga such as Botryococcus which also produces hydrocarbons and unsaturated fatty acids and other bioactive metabolites.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
The potential of micro algae for production of natural pigments and high value metabolites and fuels have been realized throughout the world and efforts are being focused on their culturing and cultivation systems. In this regard, the present invention is focused on a process for mass production of Botryococcus under out door conditions which is known for its high content of hydrocarbons.<br>
Botryococcus is a chlorophycean, colonial, slow growing fresh water microalga, which is characterized by unusually high hydrocarbon contents (Maxwell et al 1968, Phytochem. 7:2157-2171; Brown et al 1969, Phytochem, 8:543-547). This microalga is grouped under three different races A, B and L, based on the type of hydrocarbons synthesized (Metzger et al 1985, Phytochem, 24: 2305-2312 and J. Phycol 1990: 26:258).<br>
Race A produces C23 to C33 odd numbered n-alkadienes, mono-, tri-, tetra- and pentaenes and are derived from fatty acids. These linear olefins can constitute upto 61% of the dry cell mass of the green active state colonies (Glepi et al 1970, Phytochem, 9:603-612). The L race produces a single hydrocarbon C40-C78, a tetraterpene known as lycopadiene. This can constitute upto 2-8% of the dry biomass (Metzger et al J. Phycol 1990: 26:258).<br>
The B race produces polyunsaturated and branched C3o-C37 terpenoid hydrocarbons referred as polymethylated botryococcenes and are promising as a renewable energy source as they are known to be accumulated in very<br>
 <br>
high levels (30-40% of algal dry weight). Botryococcenes are extracted from the total lipids as the hexane-soluble component and can be converted into useful fuels such as gasoline by catalytic cracking (Hillen et al Biotechnol and Bioeng 1982, 24: 193-205), when hydrocracked, the distillate constituted of 67% gasoline, 15% aviation turbine fuel, 15% diesel fuel and 3% residual oil. In natural population, botryococcenes content varies from 27 to 86% of the dry cell mass (Brown et al 1969, Phytochem, 8:543-547). However, under controlled cultured conditions (in door) the hydrocarbon content varies with the species and physiological conditions from 15-80 %.<br>
In view of the changing energy scenario for renewable energy sources, Botryococcus sp. are being identified as an untapped resource for production of hydrocarbons. In light of this, the biotechnological exploitation of this potential microalga for hydrocarbons needs to be explored. Besides hydrocarbons the organism also produces extracellular polysaccharides with unique properties along with carotenoids. The organism is also reported to produce bioactive molecules such as plant growth regulators etc.<br>
Botryococcus is identified as the promising organism for production of hydrocarbons. However, till date its cultivation under out door conditions is not reported any where in the literature. Therefore, the present invention focuses on the development of a process for out door cultivation for mass production of microalga Botryococcus braunii species.<br>
Procedures currently reported for the production of microalgal biomass for value added compounds and hydrocarbons are as follows:<br>
Reference may be made to the method of US patent (US 5476787) 1995, wherein Botryococcus was cultivated in waste water for removing nitrogen impurities. The drawback in this method is that it was limited to the organism<br>
 <br>
growth in free form for removing impurities. The growth rates are very slow and also the hydrocarbon details are not mentioned.<br>
Reference may be made to another US patent (US 4689301), wherein transparent polyurethane foam which was one side permeable was used as lining of the fermentor for support of the microbial growth. The drawback is that the polyurethane foam used is permeable only on one side and thus the nutrients will not be available to the microalgae. Therefore, the technique remains limited to fermentor and not applicable for the outdoor / open system of cultivation.<br>
Reference may be made to another US patent (US 4235043), wherein a method for cultivating algae using a covering material was disclosed. The drawback is that the covering material limits the light intensity useful for growth of microalgae and further its effect on hydrocarbon production is not reported.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent (US 6602703), wherein a photo-bioreactor was used for cultivation of microalgae. The drawback is that the photo-bio reactor system is useful for the production of high value metabolites but not feasible for production of hydrocarbons which will be used as substitute for fuel. Also the process becomes very expensive.<br>
Reference may be made to Lee et al 1999, Korean Journal of Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 27: 166-171 wherein mass cultivation of Botryococcus braunii for the advanced treatment of swine wastewater and lipid production in a photo-bioreactor was reported. The drawback is that the system used is a closed photo-bioreactor under out door conditions for growing algae in wastewater. Therefore, it is not feasible for production of<br>
 <br>
hydrocarbons which will be used as substitute for fuel and the process becomes very expensive.<br>
Reference may also be made to Dayananda et al 2007. Biomass and Bioenergy, 31: 87-93, wherein autotrophic cultivation of B. braunii for production of hydrocarbons and exopolysaccharides in various media is reported. The drawback is that the report is limited to laboratory conditions, which are not applicable to mass cultivation under out door conditions.<br>
Therefore, keeping in view the lack of any available techniques in the hitherto known prior art for outdoor/ mass cultivation of Botryococcus braunii species the inventors of the present invention realized that there exists a dire need to develop a process for the outdoor cultivation of microalga Botryococcus braunii species useful for its mass cultivation. The said realization is coupled to the fact that Botryococcus braunii species is a potential source for the production of an alternative energy source in an era wherein we are facing severe depletion of the existing renewable sources of energy.<br>
The novelty of the invention is that the mass cultivation of Botryococcus braunii species which produces hydrocarbons is successfully achieved under out door culture conditions in an aqueous medium which is not reported till date in any part of the world.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is thus to provide a process for out<br>
door cultivation of microalga Botryococcus species which is useful for its mass<br>
production.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which does not<br>
favor  the  growth   of contaminants   such  as   protozoan,   fungal  and  other<br>
microalgae.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for out door cultivation for mass production of microalga Botryococcus species. Botryococcus belongs to chlorophyceae (a green alga). It is a colonial, slow growing alga known to accumulate hydrocarbons of unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons (20 to 50% w/w) in the range of carbon chain C20 to C37. In view of the changing energy scenario for renewable energy resources, Botryococcus sps are identified as a potential resource for production of hydrocarbons. However, there are no reports on its mass cultivation in any part of the world owing to its slow growth, low light and temperature requirements. Therefore, the present invention focused on developing a process for out door cultivation for mass production of microalga Botryococcus braunii species.

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The Botryococcus braunii strains were procured from different culture centres viz.,<br>
•	Botryococcus   braunii   (SAG   30.81)   from   Sammlung   von   Kulturen,<br>
Pflanzen   Physiologisches   Institut,   Universitat  Gottingen,   Gottingen,<br>
Germany,<br>
•	Botryococcus braunii (LB 572) from UTEX culture collection, USA and<br>
•	Botryococcus braunii (N-836) from NIES culture collection, Japan.<br>
•	Other Botryococcus species including the Indigenous strains collected<br>
from different water bodies and purified (which are under deposition)<br>
The said cultures were maintained in 2x concentration of Chul3 medium on slants and liquid medium under laboratory conditions such as light intensity of 1.5±0.2 klux light intensity and temperature of 25±1°C temperature.<br>
The constituents of chul3 medium are (g/1) potassium nitrate - 0.20, di potassium phosphate - 0.04, magnesium sulphate - 0.10, calcium chloride -0.08, ferric citrate - 0.01 and citric acid - 0.02 at pH 7.5. The cultures were evaluated for tolerance to different environmental conditions such as pH (6.0 to 9.5), temperature (20 to 35°C) and light dark cycle (8 to 16 hours) and light intensity (2 to 20klux) and later adopted to out door conditions in phases.<br>
Thereafter, the cultures were scaled up from slant to 150 ml Erlenmeyer flask to 500ml to 1L flask and to 5L carboy to 20L glass tank. Then the cultures<br>
 <br>
were scaled up to 100L circular and race way ponds to 500L and 1000L and finally to 3000L in complete out door conditions with manual controls for temperature and light intensity under extreme conditions. Different sources of carbon and nitrogen sources were used to simplify the cost and enhance the growth rates of the organism. This invention is the first report of its kind to develop an outdoor cultivation process for mass production of Botryococcus species in the world. The scope of this invention does not limit to the above mentioned species only and encompasses various species of Botryococcus including the indigenous ones.<br>
