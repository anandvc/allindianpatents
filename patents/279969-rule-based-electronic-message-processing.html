PRIORITY<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
Ser. No. 60/721,224, entitled RULE-BASED E-MAIL COMMUNICATION<br>
PROCESSING, filed on September 27, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is hereby<br>
expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to analyzing and processing<br>
electronic messages including, for example, e-mail communications.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
If an e-mail is sent to an incorrect recipient, it can cause severe<br>
consequences to a firm including lost business and increased exposure to legal liability.<br>
Mistakes are typically severe because e-mail communications often cross firm<br>
boundaries.<br>
Incorrect e-mail transmissions may occur for a number of reasons. For<br>
example, a high volume of e-mail communications may lead to shorter attention spans by<br>
personnel and less care being given to addressing e-mails. Further, e-mail applications,<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
such as Microsoft Outlook™, for example, provide features that allow for instant<br>
"pinpoint" access to a cache of recently used addresses which "auto-complete" the e-mail<br>
address as it is being typed; however, these features may result in the auto-completion of<br>
an incorrect e-mail address. In addition, many firms have integrated customer<br>
relationship management (CRM) systems into their e-mail addressing systems. CRM<br>
systems typically have larger contact lists than individual e-mail contact lists, and thus, a<br>
greater frequency of mistakes may occur when a CRM system is used. Further, there<br>
may be an overlap of names between the external and internal addressing systems of a<br>
firm's e-mail system, and, when both addressing systems are accessible to a user,<br>
additional mistakes can occur. In addition, as the number of a firm's clients increases,<br>
the possibility of having similar or identical names such as "John Smith", for example,<br>
likewise increases.<br>
In an attempt to reduce the frequency of the above-discussed mistakes,<br>
previous e-mail systems automatically reminded users that they should review the<br>
recipients of an e-mail before transmitting it However, these automatic warnings were<br>
often"spurious as most e-mails are actually correctly addressed. As a result, in many<br>
cases, users quickly became "trained" to click through and ignore these ineffective<br>
warnings when sending e-mails and thus became less attuned to the possibility of an<br>
incorrectly addressed e-mail. In view of the foregoing issues, what are needed are more<br>
effective systems and processes for processing e-mail communications.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In various embodiments, a computer-assisted method for processing an<br>
electronic message includes the steps of reviewing the recipients of the electronic<br>
message, evaluating whether any of the recipients of the electronic message are<br>
potentially incorrect, and prompting the sender of the electronic message to evaluate<br>
2<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
whether the potentially incorrect recipients are correct. This computer-assisted method,<br>
as it evaluates whether a recipient may be potentially incorrect, may provide an effective<br>
warning to the sender of the electronic message as opposed to previous systems which<br>
automatically, and often, spuriously, warned the sender that a recipient may be incorrect<br>
without ever evaluating the recipients.<br>
In various embodiments, a computer- readable medium for processing an<br>
electronic message comprises computer-executable instructions thereon for reviewing the<br>
recipients of the electronic message, evaluating whether any of the recipients of the<br>
electronic message are potentially incorrect, and prompting the sender of the electronic<br>
message to evaluate whether the potentially incorrect recipients are correct.<br>
In various embodiments, a computer-assisted system for processing an<br>
electronic message comprises an e-mail communication management module for<br>
reviewing the recipients of the electronic message, evaluating whether any of the<br>
recipients of the electronic message are potentially incorrect, and prompting the sender<br>
of the electronic message to evaluate whether the potentially incorrect recipients are<br>
correct<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, the present invention provides<br>
embodiments of an e-mail communication management module 102 that may reside<br>
within, or maybe operatively associated with, a conventional e-mail application 104,<br>
such as Microsoft Outlook™, for example, of a firm 106 or institution. The e-mail<br>
application 104 may be configured to facilitate, transmit, and/or receive e-mail<br>
communications through a variety of communication media 108, such as, for example,<br>
wirele'ss" data'networks, wireline networks, and/or networked media (such as Internet,<br>
intranet, or extranet), to and/or from various access devices 110 such as, for example,<br>
computer systems, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless phones.<br>
In operation, at step 202, the module 102 may be configured to detect<br>
events such as, for example, the sending of e-mail, and/or the transmission of electronic<br>
messages via instant-messaging windows and/or other electronic messaging software<br>
applications. When one or more of these events occur, at step 204, the module 102 may<br>
scan the electronic message generated by such electronic messaging software and review<br>
the recipients of the electronic message. At step 206, the module 102 may evaluate<br>
whether the recipients of the electronic message are potentially incorrect. To perform<br>
4<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
this evaluation, as discussed in further detail below, the module 102 may evaluate the<br>
recipients of the electronic message according to one or more predefined rules 112. To<br>
this end, in various embodiments, the module 102 may employ one or more rule modules<br>
that can be configured with a variety of heuristics to "guess" when an e-mail user has<br>
misaddressed an e-mail, for example, and may be configured to prompt the user, at step<br>
212, to evaluate, and possibly correct, the recipient list. In the event that the module 102<br>
determines that, in view of rules 112, the electronic message is properly addressed, the<br>
module 102 may permit the electronic message to be sent to the recipients.<br>
The above-described module 102 is an improvement over previous e-mail<br>
modules. Previous e-mail modules do not evaluate whether the recipients of the<br>
electronic message may be incorrect before prompting the sender to confirm that the<br>
recipients are correct Rather, these previous e-mail modules prompt the sender to<br>
confirm that the recipients are correct before transmitting every e-mail. As a result, users<br>
of these previous e-mail systems typically ignore these warnings as they do not assist the<br>
user in evaluating whether the recipients may be incorrect. The module 102 of the<br>
"present invention is an improvement over these previous modules as the module 102<br>
prompts the sender only when the module 102 has determined that the electronic<br>
message meets at least one of pre-defined rules 112. Accordingly, as the sender is<br>
warned only if one of rules 112 is met, the sender is more likely to evaluate the recipients<br>
of the electronic message after being prompted by the module. In various embodiments,<br>
to further facilitate the sender's review of the electronic message, the module 102 may<br>
prompt the sender in such a way that the sender has an opportunity to correct any<br>
mistakes in the recipient list without having to return to the e-mail composition window<br>
in the e-mail application 104.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
VO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
After the sender has been prompted to evaluate the recipients of the<br>
electronic message at step 212, the sender, at step 214, may respond to the prompt by<br>
affirming that the recipients of the electronic message are correct. In this event, the<br>
module 102 may permit the electronic message to be sent to the recipients at step 210.<br>
However, in the event that the sender determines that one or more recipients are<br>
incorrect, the sender may correct the recipients at step 216. The module 102 may then<br>
allow the message to be sent to the recipients at step 210, or, in various embodiments, the<br>
module 102 may re-evaluate the recipients of the electronic message in the manner<br>
described above. The module 102 may re-evaluate all of the recipients or only the<br>
corrected recipients.<br>
In various embodiments, the above-described actions of the sender can be<br>
recorded and reviewed by a supervisor and/or auditor, for example. In view of this<br>
potential supervisory review, it is believed that the senders of the electronic messages<br>
will diligently consider any warnings or prompts from the rule module. For example, in<br>
the event that an electronic message is misaddressed, the actions of the sender can be<br>
reviewed to determine whether the sender was warned about the misaddressed electronic<br>
message before it was sent.<br>
The e-mail communication management module 102 may employ a rules<br>
engine configured to apply one or more of the rules 112. One rule may involve issuing a<br>
warning to a sender when the recipient, or recipients, of the message are not included in<br>
the sender's contact list stored in the e-mail application. Other rules may involve issuing<br>
a warning when a recipient of the electronic message is not included in the customer<br>
relationship management (CRM) system 114, where the CRM system 114 includes a<br>
database of contacts from more than one user. Another rule may involve issuing a<br>
6<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
warning when a recipient's name is identical to or substantially similar to at least two<br>
names in the sender's e-mail list and/or CRM system 114.<br>
Another rule may involve issuing a warning when the e-mail domain<br>
name, i.e., the right-hand side portion of an e-mail address after the "@" sign, of the<br>
recipient, or recipients, does not match or substantially correspond to information<br>
associated with existing relationships in the firm's CRM system and/or existing e-mail<br>
contacts of the user stored in the e-mail application. Another rule may involve issuing a<br>
warning to a sender based on the ratio of internal to external recipients of the e-mail<br>
message, and/or a ratio of the occurrences of different e-mail domain names. When<br>
applying these rules, the module 102 may count the recipients having the same domain<br>
name as the sender and the recipients having a different domain name than the sender,<br>
and notify the sender when the ratio of these addresses exceeds a predetermined value,<br>
for example.<br>
Another rule may involve issuing a warning when predefined key words<br>
or phrases in the e-mail body, subject, and/or attachments are found in the message.<br>
When applying this rule, the module 102 may scan the message for these words or<br>
phrases which, if found, indicate that the e-mail may not be appropriately addressed to<br>
recipients outside of firm 106, for example. Another rule may involve issuing a warning<br>
when predefined key words or phrases are found in e-mail attachment metadata. The<br>
metadata may identify, for example, the type of document being attached, an intended<br>
audience of the document, or a customer to whom the document pertains. When<br>
applying this rule, the characteristics of the e-mail recipient list, including, but not<br>
limited to, e-mail domain names, full e-mail addresses, ratio of internal to external<br>
addresses, prior contact history, and other characteristics, may be compared with the<br>
metadata to decide the likelihood of an addressing mistake. In addition, this rule may be<br>
7<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
associated with prompting the user for document metadata as part of the document<br>
creation process such as, e.g., within word processing or spreadsheet software<br>
applications, or other document creation applications, such that the supplied metadata<br>
can be used for comparison purposes as described above.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, in various embodiments, after a sender has instructed<br>
the module 102 that the recipients of the electronic message are correct, module 102 may<br>
use the sender's input to learn new rules, or exceptions to existing rules, that may reduce<br>
incorrect warnings when evaluating subsequent electronic messages. In various<br>
embodiments, the module 102 may also permit the sender to revise the rules 112. In<br>
these embodiments, the sender can "notify" module 102 about a new relationship or<br>
contact, for example, and "instruct" the module 102 to transmit future electronic<br>
messages without warning the sender that the new contact may be incorrect. Such<br>
instructions may involve adding an e-mail address to the user's set of known e-mail<br>
contacts or CRM system 114, for example. This learned information may then be used<br>
to define one or more rules 112 that can suppress the above-discussed warning prompt.<br>
The benefits of the e-mail communication management modules<br>
described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Embodiments of the<br>
invention provide a rich and diverse set of heuristics which can be integrated into a<br>
firm's CRM systems. The invention also provides e-mail communication management<br>
modules with the capability to leam to avoid unnecessary future warnings. Application<br>
of embodiments of the invention may also reduce the business and legal risks associated<br>
with e-mail communications.<br>
The examples presented herein are intended to illustrate potential and<br>
specific implementations of the present invention. It can be appreciated that the<br>
examples are intended primarily for purposes of illustration of the invention for those<br>
8<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/038583	PCT/US2006/037653<br>
skilled in the art. No particular aspect or aspects of the examples is/are intended to limit<br>

<br>
In various embodiments, a computer-assisted method for processing an electronic message includes the steps of<br>
reviewing the recipients of the electronic message, evaluating whether any of the recipients of the electronic message are potentially<br>
incorrect, and prompting the sender of the electronic message to evaluate whether the potentially incorrect recipients are correct.<br>
This computer-assisted method, as it evaluates whether a recipient may be potentially incorrect, may provide an effective warning to<br>
the sender of the electronic message as opposed to previous systems which automatically, and often, spuriously, warned the sender<br>
that a recipient may be incorrect without ever evaluating the recipients.<br>
