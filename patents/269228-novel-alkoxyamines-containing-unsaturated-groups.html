In the context of this invention, the term "polymer" refers to a polymer of any type including homopolymers and copolymers. The term "copolymer" is meant to include polymers containing groups or units derived from two or more monomers with random, diblock, and multi-block microstructures. The copolymer can be block(co)polymers, comb(co)polymers, star(co)polymers, dendritic(co)polymers or hyperbranched(co)polymers. Block structures such as diblock, triblock are preferred.<br>
In other words, after completing the polymerization of a first monomer to the extent desired to form a first polymer "block", a second monomer is introduced into the reaction mass to effect polymerization of the second monomer to form a second polymer "block" that is attached to the end of the first block. Using this sequential addition process, a broad range of diblock, triblock, etc. copolymers can be prepared.<br><br>
The term "copolymer" also includes gradient copolymers or tapered copolymers which are copolymers composed for example of two monomers or monomer mixtures A and B in whose individual chains there is a gradient in the distribution of the monomer units along the chains. One end of the chain is rich in A units and the other in B units. Such copolymers show a continuous transition of one monomer or monomer mixture A into another monomer of monomer mixture B along the polymer chain.<br>

One, but not the only one, possibility is the reaction of the nitroxides A* with the following halogen derivatives transition metal such as for example Cu or Cu(l) salt, for example CuCI or CuBr, and optionally suitable ligand, for example 2,2' bipyridyl or pentamethyldiethylenetriamine. See K. Matyjaszewski, B. E. Woodworth, X. Zhang, Scott G. Gaynor, Z. Metzner.: Macromolecules 31, 5955-5957 (1998).<br><br>
The above halogen derivatives can be easily prepared by well-known organic reactions, for example acylation of the corresponding alcohols or amines with suitable haloacid derivatives.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of a,o-Poly-(n-butyl acrylate)-co-(polysiloxane) [A-B-A structure]<br>
 In a 100 ml three neck flask, equipped with thermometer, cooler and magnetic stirrer, 6,00 g (18,4 mmol) of regulator A* [structure see below], 13,0 g (18,2 mmol) of an a,o-dihydrogen dimethylpolysiloxane [Mn - 1428 g/mol; SiH = 1,4 mmol/g] and 20 g of xylene are mixed and degassed twice. The clear solution obtained is heated under nitrogen to 90 °C. At this temperature 20 mg of hexachloroplatinic acid solution [0,01  mmol Pt /g i-propanol] is<br><br>
