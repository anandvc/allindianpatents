				<td>It is known to improve the emergency running features (behaviour at dry condition) of heavily stressed parts by the use of solid lubricants, for example disclosed in the following publications <br>
-JP-OS 5-179522<br>
-JP-OSGM- 4-92567<br>
-US-PS- 5,086.615<br>
-JP-OS- 2-182926<br>
-JP-OSGM- 5-777<br>
- essay NI-P-BN Dispersion Coating for Cylinder from the<br>
publications of â€žPR7\XIS-FORUM" (authors, amongst others<br>
Suzuki Motor Company, Limited).<br>
Solid lubricants as described in the above mentioned publications are only to a certain extent suitable for textile machinery parts, as is stated with the preamble of the independent claim. The known solid lubricants such as for instance Teflon, molybdenum-disulphide etc. cannot resist high mechanical or thermal stress, which is one of the reasons for the negative experience that has been made with solid lubricants up to now.<br>
It is the task of the present invention to improve highly stressed parts of textile machines in such a way, that emergency running features (behaviour at dry condition) are obtained that lie above today's known degree. In particular a<br><br>
solid lubricant is to be defined, which owns a high temperature resistance.<br>
The task is solved by the object of the independent claim. The depending claims relate to preferred further embodiments.<br>
According to the invention on a textile machinery part, which, on its surface consists, either completely or only partly, of metal-phosphor and/or metal-boron, a solid lubricant in the form of a soft nitride is added to the metal-phosphor-matrix or to the metal-boron-matrix, whereby the nitride is softer than the matrix. The strength of the matrix can be increased considerably through suitable heat treatment. The increase in hardness is achieved by means of the formation of ceramic separation within a metallic matrix. Said matrix is therefore, in the following called a metal-ceramic-matrix. A hard nitride, for instance a cubic boron-nitride, known from the Japanese application disclosure 4-194031 and 2-182927 would not be suitable as a solid lubricant, could, however, be added to reinforce the matrix. The solid lubricant can be embedded as a dispersion into the metal-ceramic-matrix. In case of coating of the part, consisting of any kind of material, the part is being immersed into a bath. The part can partially or completely be sintered, for that reason the matrix, preferably consisting of steel alloy and the solid lubricant, in their initial state should be available in powder form, before it is being formed. As a soft nitride, which is used for the solid lubricant, for instance hexagonal boron-nitride or chromium-nitride or aluminium-nitride or iron-nitride is applied. If the surface of a part is to be coated, preferably a thickness of the layer of 5 to 100 mm is aimed at. As metals nickel, cobalt, iron or combinations of said metals can be considered, iron, however, is preferred. Besides the solid lubricant, reinforcing for instance fine ceramic grain, silicon carbide in particular can also be contained in the metal-ceramic-matrix. As carrier material for the metal-ceramic-matrix to be coated with the nitride, any kind of materials can be chosen, for instance<br><br>
alloys of aluminium, magnesium, zinc alloys or plastics, which can be reinforced with filling materials, preferably fibres. The base material of the textile machinery part can be formed by processes of machining, reforming or through moulding. Phosphor and boron are preferably added by 1 to 15 %, 0,5 to 5 % respectively as part of the composition of the metal-ceramic-matrix. Therefore, for the composition part of the phosphor, the boron respectively with 1 to 15 %, 0.5 to 5 % respectively, a respective greater range is specified, since, depending on the terminological main stress such as abrasion, triboxidation, erosion or fatigue, a certain percentage of the phosphor or boron within the specified range listed is optimal.<br>
Parts according to the above description are preferably manufactured as spinning rings or travelers for rotor spinning frames, rotors, rotor shafts, rotor covers or opening rollers of a rotor spinning frame or nozzles and rollers to guide fibres or yarns. Non lubricated sleeve bearings can also be manufactured of materials according to the invention.<br>
As indicated before, instead of applying a coating to a part, the entire part can be manufactured from an alloyed metal-matrix (steel) with the solid lubricant. Powder metallurgy processes that could be applicable are described in the Japanese patent application JP-OS-4-241125 or JP-OS-63-35832.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides A textile machinery part on which at least the area subjected to wear or at least the surface consists of a matrix of metal-phosphor and/or metal-boron or alloy metal, such as steel, characterized in that a solid lubricant in the form of a soft nitride which is softer than the matrix, is embedded in the matrix, and the surface of the part consists, either completely or partly, of the matrix with the lubricant; or the part is completely or partially sintered, whereby the matrix and the solid lubricant is available in powder form in their initial state before the part is formed.<br>
Preferably a nitride is used as solid lubricant with a grain size between 0.1 and   2  in particular. In order to obtain the effectiveness for the nitride as a solid lubricant, its hardness has to be determined in such a way that when the nitride becomes exposed due to operational stress, said nitride can become effective as stress-reducing lubricant, whereby the stress-reducing effect is aimed to be similar effective for the matrix as well as for the counter part. Preferably the nitride transforms into a protective lubricating film on the matrix, on the counter part body respectively when it becomes exposed to the surface.<br><br><br>
