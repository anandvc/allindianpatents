				<td>ENROBED CORE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an enrobed core, such as a tablet core,<br>
having a patterned coating formed by one or more patterned films.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various oral dosage forms have been developed over the years for<br>
Pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. Among the more popular oral dosage forms<br>
are tablets, capsules and, most recently, gelcaps. Tablets are compressed or molded<br>
solid dosage forms of any size or shape. Solid, generally oblong-shaped tablets may<br>
sometimes be referred to as caplets. Tablets remain popular with consumers, however<br>
uncoated tablets suffer from drawbacks such as medicinal taste, a tendency to powder<br>
or flake (i.e., physical disintegration) when packaged in bottles, and/or the perception by<br>
consumers that they are not easy to swallow. These limitations are eliminated by<br>
coating the tablets with a polymeric coating.<br>
During most of the 20th century, hard gelatin capsules were a popular<br>
dosage form for prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Capsules are hard<br>
shell compartments made of two halves, including a body and a cap, wherein the cap<br>
partially and snugly overlaps with the body to enclose a dosable drug ingredient therein.<br>
The enclosed dosable ingredient is most often is a powder, liquid, paste or similar non-<br>
solid form.<br>
Generally, empty hard shell capsules are produced by a conventional dip-<br>
molding process such as that which is described on page 182 of "Pharmaceutical<br><br>
Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7lh Ed.", (1999) by Howard C. Ansel, Loyd<br>
V. Allen Jr., and Nicholas G. Popovich, published by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins,<br>
Baltimore, MD. Consumers have found that such capsules are aesthetically pleasing,<br>
easy to swallow and mask the medicine taste of the drug contained therein. In addition,<br>
the bodies and caps of such capsules are often produced in different colors, resulting in<br>
a bi-colored capsule product having enhanced aesthetic appeal, as well as improved<br>
product identification and brand recognition by consumers. Many patients preferred<br>
capsules over coated or uncoated tablets, prompting pharmaceutical manufacturers to<br>
market certain products in capsule form even when they were also available in tablet<br>
form. However, due to potential tampering concerns, capsules are no longer a<br>
preferred delivery choice for consumer (i.e., over-the-counter) Pharmaceuticals.<br>
One alternative to capsule products are caplets, which are solid, oblong<br>
tablets that are often coated with various polymers such as cellulose ethers to improve<br>
their aesthetics, stability, and swallow ability. Typically, such polymers are applied to the<br>
tablets either from solution in organic solvents, or from aqueous dispersion via spraying.<br>
Still other methods involve spray coating tablets with a gelatin coating solution. See,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,973,480 and 6,113,945. However, such spray-coated tablets<br>
lack the glossy surface and elegance of the hard gelatin capsules. Additionally, it is not<br>
commercially feasible to spray-coat a tablet with a different color coating on each end.<br>
Another alternative to capsule products are "gelcaps," which are elegant,<br>
consumer-preferred dosage forms comprising solid tablets covered with a glossy<br>
gelatinous coating. Currently, gelcaps are among the most popular oral dosage forms.<br>
Several methods of producing gelcaps have been developed in an effort to provide<br><br>
tamper-proof capsule-like products. One category of such methods involve dipping<br>
tablets, one half at a time, into gelatin coating solutions, which can be of two different<br>
colors, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,820,524, or dipping tablets of a first color halfway<br>
into a into gelatin coating solution of a second color, see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,113,945. Another category of such methods involves shrink-fitting the capsule halves<br>
onto a tablet form. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,415,868, 6,126,767,<br>
5,464,631, 5,460,824, 5,317,849, 5,511,361, 5,609,010, 5,795,588 and 6,080,426, and<br>
International Patent Appln. Publication No. WO 97/37629. Another method involves<br>
sealing the body and cap of the capsule at the overlapping seam therebetween. See<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,824,338. Another method of producing gelcaps is via an enrobing<br>
process wherein two separate films made of gelatinous material are applied to opposite<br>
sides of a tablet by a pair of rotary dies. A detailed description of this process is<br>
provided, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983, and the entire<br>
contents and disclosures of both of these patents are hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Briefly, in the aforesaid rotary die process, two circular dies each having a<br>
circumferential surface are positioned such that the surfaces are in abutting relationship<br>
with one another, thereby forming a nip therebetween. Each of the dies have a series<br>
of matching recesses on their circumferential surfaces. As the dies rotate, the films are<br>
joined and fused together, at the nip between the dies where a pair of matching<br>
recesses form a pocket into which a tablet is dropped by a metered feed mechanism.<br>
As the dies continue to rotate, the tablet urges the films into the interior of the recesses<br>
in the dies, and the tablet is thereby securely enveloped and enrobed by the films, while<br><br>
the films continue to be joined and fused together about the tablet by the dies.<br>
Simultaneously with the fusing of the films about the tablet, the enrobed tablet is pinch-<br>
cut from the films by the rotary dies, whereupon it separates from the films in the form of<br>
an individual enrobed tablet. If the films used are of two different colors, the resulting<br>
enrobed tablets are bi-colored having a color transition line that is commensurate with<br>
the seam between the films. Thus, while foregoing process produces tamper-proof bi-<br>
colored enrobed tablets, the color transition of such products will always be<br>
commensurate with the seam between the films.<br>
Each of the foregoing methods for producing tamper-proof coated tablets<br>
suffer from several shortcomings, including uneven color of the capsule halves and/or<br>
coatings, uneven thickness of the capsule halves and/or coatings, and the creation of<br>
raised seams between capsule halves and/or coatings. In addition, the bi-colored<br>
products resulting from the aforesaid methods have a line defined by the color<br>
transition, which is always the same as the line defined by the seam between the<br>
capsule halves and/or coatings.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,672,300 discloses the production and use of striped and<br>
patterned films with the foregoing rotary die process to produce patterned enrobed<br>
tablets. The striped films disclosed therein are produced by depositing stock film<br>
forming material of a first color from a first spreader box to form a base film and then,<br>
using a second spreader box, adding stripes of a differently colored stock material onto<br>
the base film. Films having different patterns, including stripes and/or marbleized, are<br>
created by oscillating the second spreader box relative to the first spreader box. The<br>
gelcaps produced by this process have multiple stripes, or a marbleized pattern, rather<br><br>
than simply being bi-colored (i.e., one half being one color and the other half being a<br>
second color). Films prepared by this process suffer from the limitation of having<br>
multiple layers, with increased total film thickness in the area where the second film<br>
material is applied. The increased film thickness creates an uneven appearance and<br>
feel to the surface, and retards dissolution, which is undesirable for immediate release<br>
dosage forms. Thus, there is still a need to produce bi-colored enrobed tablets that are<br>
enrobed with films according to the rotary die process and that have color transitions<br>
that are not commensurate with the seam between the films.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an enrobed core, such as a tablet core,<br>
that has a coating made of a patterned film having portions that are visually distinct<br>
(e.g., differently colored) from one another and having a transition line segment<br>
between such visually distinct portions. More particularly, the film at least partially<br>
covers an outer surface of the core, such that the transition line segment forms a<br>
substantially continuous transition line on the coating and such that a film seam is<br>
formed which is different from the transition line. That is, the film seam lies substantially<br>
in a first reference plane that passes through the core, while the transition line segment<br>
lies substantially in a second reference plane that passes through the core and<br>
intersects the first reference plane.<br>
Alternatively, the coating is formed from two films, each of which has<br>
portions that are visually distinct from one another and a transition line segment<br>
between such visually distinct portions. The outer surface of the core is covered with<br><br>
the two films such that the two transition line segments cooperate to form a substantially<br>
continuous transition line on the coating and a film seam is formed on the coating which<br>
is different from the transition line. That is, the film seam lies substantially in the first<br>
reference plane that passes through the core, while the transition line segment lies<br>
substantially in the second reference plane that passes through the core and intersects<br>
the first reference plane.<br>
In addition, where the patterned films are bi-colored, the resulting enrobed<br>
core can be bi-colored with the film seam of the coating lying substantially in the first<br>
reference plane and the transition line between the two colors thereof lying substantially<br>
in the second reference plane. The resulting enrobed core may, instead, have four<br>
alternately arranged colored portions, two of which are of a first color and the other two<br>
of which are of a second color, thereby resulting in a "checkerboard" effect.<br>
Where the portions of each of the two patterned films are all visually<br>
distinct from one another, the resulting enrobed core can have a coating with at least<br>
four portions each having a different visual distinction (e.g., color). The film seam of the<br>
coating would still lie substantially in the first reference plane and the transition line<br>
would be different from the film seam and would still lie substantially in the second<br>
reference plane.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used hereinafter, "core" shall mean a solid dosage form of any size or<br>
shape. Suitable cores include compressed or molded tablets, hard and soft capsules,<br>
confectionery based forms such as for example lozenges, nougats, or fondants, and the<br>
like. Cores are available in various shapes and configurations. For example, FIGS. 1A,<br>
1B and 2 show an oblong convex core 10 which has an oblong shape and two rounded<br>
ends 12, 14, as viewed from the top, bottom or sides (see FIGS. 1A and 1B). The<br>
oblong convex core 10 may also have two oppositely positioned convex surfaces 15,<br>
15' and a raised portion therebetween, referred to as a land 20 (shown most clearly in<br>
FIGS. 1B and 2).<br>
It is noted that the length of the oblong core 10 is an imaginary line (not<br>
shown per se, but which is commensurate with a portion of the dotted line 16 that is<br>
within the core 10 shown in FIG. 1E) which extends the distance between the ends 12,<br>
14 of the oblong core 10. The height of the oblong core 10 is another imaginary line<br>
(not shown per se, but which is commensurate with a portion of the dotted line 18 that is<br>
within the core 10 shown in FIG. 1B) which extends the distance between the two<br>
opposite convex surfaces 15, 15' of the core 10, midway of the length. The width of the<br>
oblong core is a third imaginary line (not shown per se, but which is commensurate with<br><br>
a portion of the clotted line 16 that is within the core 10 shown in FIG. 2) which extends<br>
the distance between opposite sides of the core 10, perpendicular to and midway of the<br>
core's length and height (and which may intersect the land 20 of the core 10, if present).<br>
To facilitate discussion hereinafter of the position of the films and color<br>
transitions that are applied to the enrobed core products, certain reference planes will<br>
now be defined in relation to the core 10 and its length, height and width. It is noted that<br>
while a number of different references planes may be defined in relation to the oblong<br>
core 10, the methods, apparatus and products of the present invention will be discussed<br>
primarily in terms of certain orthogonal planes of symmetry, as follows.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 1B and 2, as used hereinafter, the "transverse", or<br>
"major", plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10 is the reference plane which includes the<br>
length and width of the core 10 anD which is perpendicular to and substantially bisects<br>
the height of the core 10. The land 20 of the core 10, if present, may be aligned with<br>
the transverse plane of symmetry 16 (see FIGS. 1B and 2) such that the land 20 is<br>
substantially bisected along its entire length. As shown in FIG. 1B, it is noted that a<br>
portion of the core 10 which lies on one side of the transverse plane of symmetry 16 is<br>
substantially a mirror image of the remaining portion of the core 10 which lies on the<br>
opposite side of the transverse piano of symmetry 16.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, as used hereinafter, the "conjugate",<br>
or "minor" plane of symmetry 18 of the oblong core 10 is the reference plane which<br>
includes the width and height of the core 10 and which is perpendicular to and<br>
substantially bisects the length of the core 10. As with the transverse plane of<br>
symmetry 16, a portion of the core 10 which lies on one side of the conjugate plane of<br><br>
symmetry 18 is substantially a mirror image of the other side of the core 10 which lies<br>
on the opposite side of the conjugate plane of symmetry 18.<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 1A and 2, a third plane of symmetry 17<br>
includes the length and height of this core 10 and is perpendicular to and substantially<br>
bisects the width of the core 10. As with the transverse and conjugate planes of<br>
symmetry 16, 18, respectively, a portion of the core 10 which lies on one side of the<br>
third plane of symmetry 17 is substantially a mirror image of the other side of the core<br>
10 which lies on the opposite side of the third plane of symmetry 17.<br>
It is noted that additional reference planes can be defined, including many<br>
which are not planes of symmetry. For example, a reference plane 19 (see FIG. 1B)<br>
may be defined that is parallel to the length and width of the core 10, but does not<br>
include the length or width and does not divide the core into mirror image portions. In<br>
addition, another reference plane 21 isee FIG. 2) could be defined such that it is parallel<br>
to the length of the core 10, perpendicular to both the width and height of the core 10,<br>
but does not include any of the length, width or height of the core and does not divide<br>
the core into mirror image portions. It will be understood by a person having ordinary<br>
skill in the art that many additional possibilities exist for defining reference planes in<br>
relation to the core 10. However, the remaining description of the method, apparatus<br>
and products of the present invention will be discussed using, primarily, the transverse<br>
and conjugate planes of symmetry 16 18, respectively.<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 3-8A, examples are provided of cores having<br>
shapes and configurations different from the oblong convex core 10 shown in FIGS. 1A,<br>
1B and 2. More particularly, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, an oblong convex core 10a<br><br>
may, alternatively, have a central cylindrical subsection 22 between the two rounded<br>
ends 12a, 14a (i.e., instead of a land 20). The core 10a shown in FIGS. 3 and 4<br>
includes a transverse plane of symmetry 16a and a conjugate plane of symmetry 18a,<br>
the orientation of which are defined in the same manner as provided above in<br>
connection with the oblong core 10 of FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2. As can be seen from FIGS.<br>
3 and 4, the rounded ends 12,' 14' of the caplet 10' are of slightly smaller diameter than<br>
the cylindrical subsection 20.<br>
FIGS. 5, 6, 7A and 7B provide examples of "round" cores, which are cores<br>
having a generally round or circular configuration when viewed from above (see the top<br>
views shown in FIGS. 5 and 7A). In addition, while round cores have a length, a width<br>
and a height, the length and width of each round core are dimensionally<br>
interchangeable due to the generally circular configuration of each round core.<br>
With reference in particular to FIGS. 5 and 6, a "round convex" core 24<br>
may have two oppositely positioned convex surfaces 25, 25' which are seen most<br>
clearly from a front, back or side elevational view, such as provided in FIG. 6. The<br>
round convex core 24 includes a transverse plane of symmetry 26 and a conjugate<br>
plane of symmetry 28, the orientation of which are defined in the same manner as<br>
provided above in connection with the oblong core 10 of FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2. As also<br>
seen most clearly in FIG. 6, the rour d convex core 24 may also have a raised portion,<br>
or land 20', similar to the land 20 of the oblong convex core 10 of FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2.<br>
With reference now to F:IGS. 7A and 7B, a "round flat" core 24a may have<br>
two oppositely positioned flat surfaces 25a, 25a' (i.e., rather than convex surfaces). The<br>
round flat core 24a may also have a beveled edge 27a positioned 27a proximate to one<br><br>
flat surface 25a (see FIGS. 7A and 7B) and another beveled edge 27a' positioned<br>
proximate to the other flat surface 25a' (see FIG. 7B) of the round flat core 24a. The<br>
round flat core 24a includes a transverse plane of symmetry 26a and a conjugate plane<br>
of symmetry 28a, the orientation of which are defined in the same manner as provided<br>
above in connection with the oblong core 10 of FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2.<br>
FIGS. 8A and 8B provide one example of a type of "oval" core 24b.<br>
Generally, "oval" cores are cores having have a generally oval configuration when<br>
viewed from above (see, for example, the top view shown in FIG. 8A). An "oval convex"<br>
core 24b, shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, may have two oppositely positioned convex<br>
surfaces 25b, 25b' which are seen most clearly from a front, back or side elevational<br>
view, such as provided in FIG. 8B. The oval convex core 24b includes a transverse<br>
plane of symmetry 26b and a conjugate plane of symmetry 28b, the orientation of which<br>
are defined in the same manner as provided above in connection with the oblong core<br>
10 of FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2. As seen most clearly in FIG. 8B, the oval convex core 24b<br>
may also have a raised portion, or land 20b', similar to the land 20 of the oblong convex<br>
core 10 of FIGS. 1 A, 1B and 2.<br>
It is noted that, while the present invention has applicability to core dosage<br>
forms of various shapes, including but not limited to the shapes shown in FIGS. 1A-8B,<br>
the remaining drawing figures and the detailed description provided hereinafter show<br>
and discuss the apparatus and methods of the present invention as applied to the<br>
oblong convex caplet 10 of the first configuration exemplified in FIGS. 1A, 1B and 2. It<br>
is understood, however, that the present invention may also be applied to differently<br><br>
shaped cores, including, but not limited to, the cores of other configurations, including<br>
oblong, round and oval cores, shown in FIGS. 3-8B.<br>
The product of the present invention, which is produced by the methods<br>
and apparatus of the present invention described hereinafter, is an enrobed substrate<br>
(also referred to herein as a "core"). Such enrobed products are often referred to as<br>
"geltabs" or "gelcaps". The terms "geltabs" and "gelcaps" shall mean a substrate having<br>
at least one, non-core layer, or film, made of a film forming or gel forming substance or<br>
substances. The substrate, or core may be a compressed tablet, or other non-liquid<br>
(e.g., solid or semi-solid) dosage form.<br>
More particularly, as will be described in further detail hereinafter, the<br>
enrobed core of the present invention is enrobed by at least one film having at least two<br>
visually distinct portions (i.e., at least two portions having different visual appearances)<br>
and at least one visual transition line between the visually distinct portions of the film. It<br>
is noted that, hereinafter, the apparatus and method of the present invention are<br>
discussed as producing enrobed cores that are substantially enrobed by the film or films<br>
and the term "substantially" shall be understood to mean that at least about 95% of the<br>
surface area of the core is covered by the film or films. Furthermore, it will be<br>
understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that the apparatus and method of the<br>
present invention may be adapted tc produce enrobed core products that are at least<br>
partially covered by the film or films. The term "at least partially covered" shall be<br>
understood to mean that at least about 25% to about 100% of the surface area of the<br>
core is covered by the film or films.<br><br>
It is further noted that the visually distinct portions of the patterned film or<br>
films may be of different colors, hues, glosses, reflective qualities, brightness, depth,<br>
shades, chroma, opacity, etc. Patterned films may also be embossed or etched with<br>
surface relief patterns for textural and visual effects, as in the case of a holographic<br>
image or pattern. For example, the patterned film could have at least two portions<br>
having different visual appearances as follows: a red portion and a yellow portion (such<br>
as red and yellow stripes, or a red background having yellow spots thereon), or a flat<br>
finish portion and a glossy portion, or an opaque portion and a translucent portion.<br>
While the apparatus and methods of the present invention will be discussed hereinafter<br>
as employing films that have differently colored stripes (i.e., red and yellow stripes) with<br>
a color transition line therebetween, it will be understood that the patterned films may<br>
have any of the foregoing types of visually distinct portions, or combinations thereof,<br>
including visual distinctions not specifically mentioned herein.<br>
It is further noted that the films of the present invention may be made of<br>
any elastic, plastic material (i.e., stock film forming material) that is preferably<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and which is, or can be made, semi-liquid and flowable to<br>
facilitate the formation of a patterned seamless and continuous film that can be made<br>
formable and malleable and which has smooth and controllable transition lines between<br>
the visually distinct portions thereof. More particularly, the films of the present invention<br>
may be formed of various materials, including, but not limited to, compositions<br>
comprising, consisting of, and/or consisting essentially of a film former; optionally a<br>
thickener; optionally an extender, optionally a plasticizer, and optionally various<br>
adjuvants and excipients.<br><br>
Any film former known in the art is suitable for use in film composition of<br>
the present invention. Examples of suitable film forming materials include, but are not<br>
limited to, cellulosics such as methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC),<br>
hydroxyethylmethylcellulose (HEMC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC),<br>
hydroxybutylmethylcellulose (HBMC), hydroxyethylethylcellulose (HEEC), and<br>
hydroxyethylhydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HEMPMC); modified starches such as<br>
cross-linked starches, chemically modified starches including hydroxypropyl starch,<br>
hydroxyethyl starch, methylethyl starch, carboxymethyl starch; and physically modified<br>
starches including pre-gelatinized starches; proteins such as gelatin, whey protein, egg<br>
albumin, casein and casein isolates, soy protein and soy protein isolates; and other film-<br>
forming polymers such as polyvinylalcohol (PVA), methacrylic acid and methacrylate<br>
ester copolymers, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol copolymers, and derivatives<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
One suitable hydroxypropylmethylcellulose compound is "HPMC 2910",<br>
which is a cellulose ether having a degree of substitution of about 1.9 and a<br>
hydroxypropyl molar substitution of 0.23, and containing, based upon the total weight of<br>
the compound, from about 29% to about 30% methoxyl and from about 7% to about<br>
12% hydroxylpropyl groups. HPMC: 2910 is commercially available from the Dow<br>
Chemical Company under the tradename, "METHOCEL E." "METHOCEL E5," which is<br>
one grade of HPMC-2910 suitable for use in the present invention, has a viscosity of<br>
about 4 to 6 cps (4 to 6 millipascal-seconds) at 20 degrees Celsius in a 2% aqueous<br>
solution as determined by a Ubbelohcle viscometer. Similarly, "METHOCEL E6," which<br>
is another grade of HPMC-2910 suitable for use in the present invention, has a viscosity<br><br>
of about 5 to 7 cps (i.e., 5 to 7 millipascal-seconds) at 20 degrees Celsius in a 2%<br>
aqueous solution as determined by a Ubbelohde viscometer. "METHOCEL E15," which<br>
is another grade of HPMC-2910 suitable for use in the present invention, has a viscosity<br>
of about 15000 cps (15 millipascal-seconds) at 20 degrees Celsius in a 2% aqueous<br>
solution as determined by a Ubbelohde viscometer. As used herein, "degree of<br>
substitution" shall mean the average number of substituent groups attached to a<br>
anhydroglucose ring, and "hydroxypropyl molar substitution" shall mean the number of<br>
moles of hydroxypropyl per mole anhydroglucose.<br>
One suitable polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol copolymer is<br>
commercially available from BASF Corporation under the tradename "KOLLICOAT IR".<br>
As used herein, "modfied starches" include starches that have been<br>
modified by crosslinking, chemical y modified for improved stability or optimized<br>
performance, or physically modified for improved solubility properties or optimized<br>
performance. Chemically modified starches have typically been treated with chemicals<br>
so that some hydroxyl groups have been replaced by either ester or ether groups. Very<br>
low levels of chemical modification can significantly change the Theological, physical,<br>
and chemical properties of starch. Crosslinking, in which two hydroxyl groups on<br>
neighboring starch molecules are linked chemically is also a form of chemical<br>
modification. As used herein, "pre-gelatinized starches" or "instantized starches" refers<br>
to physically modified starches that have been pre-wetted, then dried to enhance their<br>
cold-water solubility. Acid-hydrolyzed starch is a term used for a starch suspension<br>
treated with dilute acid at a tempera ture below the gelatinization point. The granular<br>
form of the starch is maintained and the reaction is ended by neutralization, filtration<br><br>
and drying once the desired degree of conversion is reached. This results in a<br>
reduction in the average molecular size of the starch polymers. Acid-hydrolyzed<br>
starches tend to have a lower hot viscosity than native starch and a strong tendency to<br>
gel when cooled. Suitable modified starches are commercially available from several<br>
suppliers such as, for example, A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company, and National<br>
Starch &amp; Chemical Company.<br>
One suitable modified starch includes the pre-gelatinized waxy maize<br>
derivative starches that are commercially available from National Starch &amp; Chemical<br>
Company under the tradenames, "PURITY GUM" and "FILMSET", and derivatives,<br>
copolymers, and mixtures thereof. Such waxy maize starches typically contain, based<br>
upon the total weight of the starch, from about 0% to about 18% of amylose and from<br>
about 100% to about 88% of amylopectin.<br>
Another suitable modified starch includes the hydroxypropylated starches.<br>
These are starches in which some of the hydroxyl groups have been etherified with<br>
hydroxypropyl groups, usually by treatment with propylene oxide. These starches are<br>
characterized by having excellent refrigeration and freeze/thaw stability. Hydroxypropyl<br>
food starches are generally crosslinked in addition to the etherification. Hydroxypropyl<br>
distarch phosphate is a starch used widely in the food industry in which both<br>
monofunctional hydroxypropyl groups have been added in combination with phosphate<br>
crosslinking. One example of a suitable hydroxypropyl starch is commercially available<br>
from Grain Processing Company under the tradename, "PURE-COTE B790".<br>
Suitable tapioca dextrins include those available from National Starch &amp;<br>
Chemical Company under the tradenames "CRYSTAL GUM" or "K-4484", and<br><br>
derivatives thereof such as modified food stairch derived from tapioca, which is available<br>
from National Starch and Chemical Company under the tradename "PURITY GUM 40",<br>
and copolymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Any thickener known in the art is suitable for use in the film composition of<br>
the present invention. Examples of such thickeners include but are not limited to<br>
hydrocolloids such as alginates, agar, guar gum, locust bean gum, kappa carrageenan,<br>
iota carrageenan, tara, gum arabic, tragacanth, pectin, xanthan gum, gellan gum,<br>

pectin, whelan, rhamsan, zooglan, methylan, chitin, cyclodextrin, chitosan, clays, acid<br>
hydrolyzed starches and derivatives and mixtures thereof. Additional suitable<br>
thickeners include sucrose, dextrose, fructose, and the like, and derivatives and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable xanthan gums include those available from C.P. Kelco Company<br>
under the tradename, "KELTROL 1000," "XANTROL 180," or "K9B310."<br>
Suitable clays include smectites such as bentonite, kaolin, and laponite;<br>
magnesium trisilicate, magnesium aluminum silicate, and the like, and derivatives and<br>
mixtures thereof. The smectites are a group of minerals that swell as they absorb water<br>
or organic molecules within the structural layers; they also have considerable cationic<br>
exchange properties.<br>
Suitable acid hydrolyzed starches include that commercially available from<br>
Grain Processing Corporation under the tradename, "PURE-SET B950", and<br>
hydroxypropyl distarch phosphates such as that commercially available from Grain<br>
Processing Corporation under the tradename, "PURE-GEL B990".<br><br>

in an amount, based upon the total weight of the solution, from about 0% to about 40%.<br>
Other suitable film materials include the gelatin-based material disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983, as well as other materials discussed<br>

The first embodiment of the present invention is directed to a novel rotary<br>
die apparatus and a method of enrobing cores using same. Initially, it is noted that,<br><br>
while various types of stock film forming materials are suitable for use in the<br>
embodiments described herein, gelatin-based materials are preferred.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983 provide a complete and<br>
detailed description of the rotary die apparatus and method of enrobing cores to<br>
produce gelcaps suitable for use in the apparatus and method of the first embodiment.<br>
Accordingly, only those portions of the rotary die enrobing apparatus and process that<br>
are new and/or modified in accordance with the present invention will be described in<br>
full detail hereinafter.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 9-11, there are shown front (see FIG. 9), top (see<br>
FIG. 10) and side (see FIG. 11) representations of a film casting apparatus 30 used to<br>
produce a patterned film, more particularly a striped film 32, for enrobing cores 10 in<br>
accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention. More particularly, the<br>
film casting apparatus 30 includes film receiving means, such as a conventional casting<br>
drum 34 (see FIGS. 9 and 11), for receiving the film 32 cast thereon, as described in<br>
further detail hereinafter. The casting drum 34 rotates at a controllable rate in the<br>
direction indicated by the arrow B in FIG. 11. The casting drum 34 has an exterior<br>
surface 36, which may be polished and which may be cooled by conventional cooling<br>
means, such as circulating cooled water within the drum (not shown), for reasons<br>
discussed hereinafter.<br>
With reference now, h particular, to FIGS. 10 and 11, the film casting<br>
apparatus 30 further includes film depositing means, such as a multi-chamber slit<br>
extruder 38, for depositing the film 32 (see FIGS. 9-11) onto the casting drum 34. The<br>
film 32 is made of any stock film forming materials 40, 42 that are suitable for use in<br><br>
conjunction with the multi-chamber slit extruder 38. It is noted that FIG. 10 shows the<br>
film casting apparatus 30 as viewed from the top; and, therefore, it shows the interior 44<br>
of the multi-chamber slit extruder 38. FIG. 11 shows the film casting apparatus 30 from<br>
the left side (i.e., looking in the direction of arrow A in FIG. 9), with the slit extruder 38 in<br>
partial cross section, such that the interior 44 thereof is partially visible. As shown in<br>
these figures, the slit extruder 38 has, generally, a floor panel 46 and four exterior walls<br>
48, 50, 52, 54 (see FIG. 10), which define the interior 44 of the slit extruder 38. The slit<br>
extruder 38 also includes flow control means, such as a slidable gate 56 (see FIG. 11),<br>
for a purpose to be described hereinafter. Three partitions 58, 60, 62 divide the interior<br>
44 of the slit extruder 38 into four chambers 64, 66, 68, 70. In this regard, it is noted<br>
that the slit extruder 38 may include more or fewer partitions than are shown in the<br>
present embodiment resulting in more or fewer chambers, respectively, than are shown<br>
in the present embodiment. The film casting apparatus 30 also includes supply means,<br>
such as feeder pipes 72, 74 (shown in partial cross section in FIGS. 9-11 to reveal the<br>
stock film forming materials 40, 42 flowing therethrough) for supplying stock film forming<br>
materials 40, 42 to the chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 in a manner to be described hereinafter.<br>
As can be seen best in FIG. 11, one of the exterior walls 48 of the slit<br>
extruder 38 may have an inner surface 76 that is sloped toward the floor panel 46 and<br>
terminates proximate thereto, thus forming an open slit 78 between the bottom-most<br>
portion of the wall 48 and the floor panel 46. The open slit 78 communicates with each<br>
of the chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 of the slit extruder 38 to allow passage therethrough of<br>
the stock film forming materials 40, 42. The slit extruder 38 is heated by conventional<br>
heating means, such as electric coils, or coils with hot water circulating therein (not<br><br>
shown), for the purpose of heating the stock film forming materials 40, 42 to (or<br>
maintaining the stock film forming materials 40, 42 at) a flowable liquid state, such that<br>
the stock film forming materials 40, 42 will flow through the slit 78 and out of the<br>
chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 in a manner to be described hereinafter. The width of the slit<br>
78, and, hence, the thickness of the resulting film 32, is adjusted by moving the slidable<br>
gate 56 in the directions indicated by arrow C in FIG. 11.<br>
The slit extruder 38 may also include a top cover 80 (see FIGS. 9 and 11)<br>
to facilitate pressurizing the interior 44 of the slit extruder 38 by conventional<br>
pressurizing means (not shown), which will encourage the stock film forming materials<br>
40, 42 to flow out of the chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 in a manner to be described<br>
hereinafter. As a further optional feature, the slit extruder 38 may include an interior<br>
roller 82 (see FIG. 11), which is adapted to rotate in the direction indicated by the arrow<br>
D so as to encourage the stock film forming materials 40, 42 to flow out of the chambers<br>
64, 66, 68, 70 in a manner to be described hereinafter.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 9-11, when the chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 of the slit<br>
extruder 38 contain differently colored stock film forming materials 40, 42 in alternating<br>
chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 (e.g., "red" stock material 40 in the chambers 64, 68 and<br>
"yellow" stock material 42 in the chambers 66, 70), the resulting film 32 will have<br>
differently colored stripes (i.e., red stripes 84, 88 and yellow stripes 86, 90). In addition,<br>
where the slit extruder 38 includes more or fewer chambers than are shown in FIGS. 9-<br>
11, the resulting striped film 32 will have more or fewer stripes, respectively, than the<br>
film 32 shown in the present embodiment.<br><br>
It is noted that, of course, the stock film forming materials 40, 42 need not<br>
be of different colors, but rather, they can be visually distinct from one another by<br>
having, for example, different colors, hues, glosses, reflective qualities, brightness,<br>
depth, shades, chroma, opacity, etc. Red and yellow stock film forming materials 40,<br>
42, respectively, are discussed herein merely by way of example and, it should be<br>
understood that stock film forming materials that are visually distinct from one another in<br>
other ways, as mentioned above, are also suitable for use with the apparatus and<br>
method of the present invention. Furthermore, stock film forming materials 40, 42 of<br>
more than two different colors (for example, four stock materials of four different colors),<br>
or other visual distinctions (such as, for example, a first flat stock material, a second<br>
glossy stock material and a third stock material having reflective qualities), may also be<br>
used. It is further noted that the stock film forming materials 40, 42 may be of different<br>
chemical compositions (i.e., they need not both be made of polymer or starch-based<br>
materials, or even of the same polymer or starch-based formulation) and still be suitable<br>
for use with the apparatus and methods of the present invention as long as the stock<br>
film-forming materials are sufficiently compatible with one another such that they will<br>
form a continuous patterned film by the methods described hereinafter.<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 12 and 13, to ensure that the color transitions<br>
92a, 92b, 92c between stripes 84, 86, 88, 90 of different colors (or visual distinction) in<br>
the film 32 are straight and consistent (see, e.g., FIG. 9), the slit extruder 38 includes a<br>
stripe control means, such as a tapered blade edge 94, 96, 98 on each partition 58, 60,<br>
62, respectively, to control the flow of the stock film forming materials 40, 42 as they exit<br>
the chambers 64, 66, 68, 70. FIG. 12 shows a single isolated partition 58, removed<br><br><br>
from the slit extruder 38 and having a tapered blade edge 94, as well as a hole 100 that<br>
is sized and shaped to rotatably receive the interior roller 82 therethrough. As shown in<br>
FIG. 13, when the partitions 58, 62, 62 and the interior roller 82 are properly installed<br>
within the slit extruder 38, the tapered edge 94, 96, 98 of each partition 58, 60, 62,<br>
respectively, rests upon the floor panel 46 and extends across the slit 78.<br>
The operation of the film casting apparatus 38, by which striped film 32 is<br>
produced, will now be described in detail using FIGS. 9-13 as references. Initially, one<br>
feeder pipe 72 supplies the stock film forming material 40 of one color (or visual<br>
distinction), such as red, to two alternate chambers 64, 68 of the slit extruder 38, while<br>
the other feeder pipe 74 supplies stock film forming material 42 of another color (or<br>
visual distinction), such as yellow, to the remaining two chambers 66, 70. The stock film<br>
forming materials 40, 42 may be provided to the extruder 38 in the form of liquid, a solid,<br>
or a semi-solid, and may be at any desired temperature. A conventional heating means<br>
(not shown) of the slit extruder 38 may be activated, thereby heating the stock film<br>
forming materials 40, 42 within the chambers 64, 66, 68, 70 to a predetermined<br>
temperature (or maintaining the stock film forming materials 40, 42 at such a<br>
temperature), at which the stock film forming materials 40, 42 become liquid and<br>
flowable or may be maintained in a liquid and flowable state. Depending upon the type<br>
and composition of the stock film forming materials 40, 42, it may be exposed to a<br>
temperature between about 40 degrees Celsius and about 250 degrees Celsius. For<br>
example, where the stock film forming materials 40, 42 are gelatin based or<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose based, then the appropriate temperature range for<br>
heating within the slit extruder 38 would be between about 40 degrees Celsius and<br><br><br>
bout 190 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, where the stock film forming materials 40, 42<br>
are starch based, then the appropriate temperature range for heating within the slit<br>
extruder 38 would be between about 80 degrees Celsius and about 240 degrees<br>
Celsius.<br>
According to known, conventional processes, the rotation of the casting<br>
drum 34 is commenced and the exter or surface 36 of the casting drum 34 is cooled by<br>
conventional cooling means (not shown) to a predetermined temperature that will, at<br>
least partially, solidify the stock film forming materials 40, 42 upon their physical contact<br>
with the surface 36 of the drum 34 to form the striped film 32, as described in further<br>
detail hereinafter. One skilled in the art would readily appreciate, without undue<br>
experimentation, the proper predetermined temperature for the exterior surface 36 of<br>
the drum 34 will depend upon several factors such as, for example, the type and<br>
composition of the stock film forming materials 40, 42 and the desired thickness of the<br>
resulting film 32. For example, where the stock film forming materials 40, 42 are gelatin<br>
based or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose based, and the desired film thickness is about<br>
0.1 millimeters to about 2.0 millimeters, then the appropriate temperature range for<br>
cooling the exterior surface 36 of the casting drum 34 would be between about 2<br>
degrees Celsius and about 50 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, where the stock film<br>
forming materials 40, 42 are thermoplastic starch based, and the desired film thickness<br>
is about 0.1 millimeters and about 2.0 millimeters, then the appropriate temperature<br>
range for cooling the surface 36 of the drum 34 would be between about 20 degrees<br>
Celsius and about 100 degrees Celsius.<br><br><br>
After the stock film forming materials 40, 42 are heated to, or maintained<br>
at, the appropriate predetermined temperature and the exterior surface 36 of the casting<br>
drum 34 is cooled to the appropriate predetermined temperature, the slidable gate 56 of<br>
the slit extruder 38 is moved to a position which opens the slit 78 to the thickness that is<br>
desired for the film 32. The stock film forming materials 40, 42 then flow out of their<br>
respective chambers 64, 66, 68, 70, along the tapered blade edges 94, 96, 98, through<br>
the slit 78, and onto the casting drum 34, in a controlled manner, in the direction of the<br>
arrow E in FIG. 9. The aforesaid apparatus and procedure result in the production of a<br>
continuous ribbon of striped film 32, having alternating red stripes 84, 88 and yellow<br>
stripes 86, 90, with straight and consistent color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c therebetween.<br>
The film 32 is continuously removed From the casting drum 34 by a scraper or similar<br>
device (not shown).<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 14-16, a summary of the enrobing apparatus<br>
102 (see FIG. 14) in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention will<br>
now be provided. Reference is also made to U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and<br>
5,459,983, which both provide a detailed description of the enrobing apparatus 102.<br>
With reference in particular to FIG. 14, it is noted that the enrobing<br>
apparatus 102 has a central plane of symmetry 104 about which the various equipment<br>
that comprises the enrobing apparatus 102 are arranged. As depicted schematically in<br>
FIG. 14, it can be seen that the equipment of the enrobing apparatus 102 on one side of<br>
the central plane of symmetry 104 is basically the same type as the equipment on the<br>
other side of the central plane of symmetry 104 and is arranged, generally, in a mirror<br>
image thereof. More particularly, a film casting apparatus 30, 30' is positioned at each<br><br><br>
of the opposite ends of the enrobing apparatus 102 and each film casting apparatus 30,<br>
30' produces a striped film 32, 32, respectively. Each film 32, 32' is moved in a<br>
continuous manner, by a series of rollers 106, 108, 110, and 106', 108', 110',<br>
respectively, toward a pair of coacting rotary dies 112, 112', which are positioned<br>
symmetrically on either side of the central plane of symmetry 104. The rotary dies 112,<br>
112' rotate on their axes of rotation AR, AR', respectively, in the directions of arrows F,<br>
F', respectively, thereby forming a nip therebetween. The nip between the rotary dies<br>
112, 112' lies in the aforesaid central plane of symmetry 104 and the striped films 32,<br>
32' are passed therethrough.<br>
Each film 32, 32' includes a top or contact surface 32a, 32a' and a reverse<br>
surface 32b, 32b', respectively (see: FIG. 14). Shortly after the striped films 32, 32' are<br>
cast and removed from the cooled casting drums 34, 34', as described earlier<br>
hereinabove, the reverse surface 32b, 32b' of each film 32, 32' may be lubricated in a<br>
lubricant bath 114, 114' to facilitate their movement over the rollers 106, 108, 110, 106',<br>
108', 110'. Suitable lubricants include any fats or oils, which are well-known in the art<br>
for such use. Just prior to the passage of the films 32, 32' into the nip between the<br>
rotary dies 112, 112', the contact surface 32a, 32a' of each of the films 32, 32' may be<br>
heated by conventional heating means 116, 116' to facilitate their bonding to one<br>
another as they pass between the rotary dies 112, 112'.<br>
The enrobing apparatus 102 also includes a core dispensing means 118,<br>
which holds a supply of cores 10 and dispenses them to the nip between the rotary dies<br>
112, 112' in a timed manner. Although this embodiment is illustrated as enrobing cores,<br>
it is within the scope of the present invention to alternatively enrobe any substrate with a<br><br><br>
desired film coating, including but not limited to a hard or soft capsules, gels, lozenges,<br>
nougats, fondants, etc., or other confectionery. The core dispensing means 118 is<br>
aligned with the central plane of symmetry 104 and the nip formed between the rotary<br>
dies 112, 112'. The core dispensing means 118 orients and dispenses each core 10<br>
such that the core 10 simultaneously contacts the contact surfaces 32a, 32a' of the<br>
converging striped films 32, 32' as the core 10 enters the nip between the dies 112,<br>
112', with its transverse plane of symmetry 16 lying in the central plane of symmetry<br>
104 of the enrobing apparatus 102, and the color transitions 92a, 92a' of the films 32,<br>
32', respectively, lying in the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10. The films<br>
32, 32' are then stretched around the opposite sides of each core 10 symmetrically,<br>
relative to the central plane of symmetry 104 of the enrobing apparatus 102.<br>
FIG. 15 shows the proper positioning of the cores 10 in between the<br>
striped films 32, 32' as they enter the nip between the dies 112, 112' and relative to the<br>
color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c" of each film 32, 32'. In FIG. 15, the first<br>
film 32 is partially cut away to show the cores 10 placed on the second film 32'. The<br>
cores 10 that are shown in phantom in FIG. 15 are sandwiched in between the films 32,<br>
32', thereby showing how the color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c of the first film 32 align with<br>
the color transitions 92a', 92b', 92c' of the second film 32', respectively, and how all of<br>
the color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c' are aligned with the conjugate plane<br>
 of symmetry 16 (not shown on the phantom cores 10) of a corresponding core 10.<br>
Furthermore, the enrobing apparatus 102 preferably includes registering<br>
means 120 (shown only schematically in FIG. 14) for ensuring that the colored stripes<br>
(not shown) of the films 32, 32' are properly aligned with one another prior to passage<br><br><br>
between the rotary dies 112, 112'. The registering means 120 also ensures that the<br>
positions of the dispensed cores 10 are appropriate relative to the color transitions 92a,<br>
92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c' of the films 32, 32', respectively, such that the color transition<br>
between the colors on the resulting gelcap products 122 are properly matched with one<br>
another and the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of each core 10. More particularly, the<br>
registering means 120 (shown schematically only in FIG. 14) may include any one of<br>
many any other conventional, known types of optical sensory and control devices<br>
(commercially available from Contrex, Inc. of Maple Grove, Minnesota and Ormec<br>
Systems Corp. of Rochester, New York), as well as any other conventional, known<br>
mechanical adjusting means for adjusting the position of one or both of the films 32, 32',<br>
as necessary.<br>
With reference now to FIG. 16, an enlarged schematic perspective view of<br>
the drum-like rotary dies 112, 112' is provided. As shown, the rotary dies 112, 112' are<br>
substantially identical to one another, each having an exterior circumferential surface<br>
124, 124' with a series of recesses 126, 126' thereon. The recesses 126, 126' are<br>
arranged in rows, which extend circumferentially around each rotary die 112, 112'.<br>
Furthermore, each recess 126, 126' has a raised rim 128, 128' about its periphery for a<br>
purpose to be described hereinafter. It is noted that, as shown in FIG. 16, each recess<br>
126, 126' is shaped to conform to the shape of the cores 10 being enrobed. More<br>
particularly, for purposes of the present illustration wherein oblong cores 10 are being<br>
enrobed, each recess 126, 126' has a length 130, 130' and a width 132, 132' and each<br>
is arranged such that its length 130, 130' is aligned parallel to the axis of rotation AR,<br>
AR' of its respective rotary die 112, 112'. In addition, it is contemplated that each die<br><br><br>
112, 112' may have a different number of rows of recesses 126, 126' than are shown in<br>
the present embodiment, as long as there are the same number of rows on each die<br>
112, 112' so that each recess 126 on one die 112 can cooperate with a corresponding<br>
recess 126' on the other die 112', as described in further detail hereinafter. In addition,<br>
the number of rows of recesses 126, 126' should correspond to the number of color<br>
transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c' between the stripes 84, 86, 88, 90, 84', 86',<br>
88', 90' on the striped films 32, 32', respectively, that pass between the dies 112, 112',<br>
for reasons which will be apparent based upon the operation of the enrobing apparatus<br>
102 described hereinafter. The dies 112, 112' should be at or below room temperature<br>
and may be brought to, or maintained at, such temperature by any suitable<br>
conventional, known temperature control means (not shown). In addition, if desired, the<br>
exterior circumferential surfaces 124,124', including the recesses 126,126', of each die<br>
112, 112', respectively, may be treated so as to reduce the tendency of the films 32, 32'<br>
to stick thereto, such as, for example, applying a suitable conventional lubricant thereto,<br>
or coating the surfaces 124, 124' with TEFLON® or anodizing the surfaces 124, 124'.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 16, the orientation of the striped films 32, 32' as<br>
they pass between the rotary dies 112, 112' is such that the red stripes 84, 88 of one<br>
film 32 are matched with the red stripes 84', 88' of the other film 32' and the yellow<br>
stripes 86, 90, 86', 90' of each film 32, 32', respectively, are similarly matched with one<br>
another. The registering means 120 of the enrobing apparatus 102 may be used to<br>
facilitate the orientation of the films 32, 32' such that the matching and alignment of the<br>
color transitions 92a, 92b, 92c, 92a', 92b', 92c' of each film 32, 32', respectively, are<br>
improved.<br><br><br>
As the dies 112, 112 rotate, each recess 126 of one rotary die 112<br>
cooperates with a corresponding recess 126' on the other rotary die 112' at the nip<br>
between the dies 112, 112' to form a cavity therebetween. The recesses 126, 126' are<br>
sized and shaped such that the cavities formed therebetween are slightly larger than the<br>
enrobed core 10, thereby preventing unnecessary contact between the films 32, 32' and<br>
the interior surfaces of the recesses 126, 126'. As the rotary dies 112, 112' rotate, the<br>
cores 10 are dispensed to the nip between the dies 112, 112' such that they are<br>
oriented with their lengths aligned parallel to the axes of rotation AR, AR' of the dies<br>
112, 112' and each core 10 is thereby properly aligned to be received between a pair of<br>
coacting recesses 126, 126'. The rotary dies 112, 112' continue to rotate and the films<br>
32, 32' are sealed to each other by the raised rims 128, 128' of the coacting recesses<br>
126, 126', around the core 10 thereby forming a film seam 134, which lies in the<br>
transverse plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10. The raised rims 128, 128' also cut<br>
through the bonded films 32, 32', at the film seam 134 around each enrobed core 10,<br>
thereby releasing the enrobed core products, or gelcaps 122, from the bonded films 32,<br>
32'.<br>
With reference to the film seam 134 of the gelcaps 122, it is noted that in<br>
addition to the configuration described above wherein the films 32, 32' are sealed<br>
together and cut by the raised rims 128, 128' of the coacting recesses 126, 126' thereby<br>
resulting in abutting film edges that form the film seam 134, it is also possible to have a<br>
film seam 134 wherein the cut edge of one film 32 slightly overlaps the cut edge of the<br>
other film 32' by an amount approximately equal to the thickness of the films 32, 32'.<br>
Alternatively, the film seam 134 could be formed such that the cut edges of the films 32,<br><br><br>
32' are aligned with one another about the core 10, but are spaced apart slightly by a<br>
distance that is approximately equal to the thickness of the films 32, 32'. Regardless of<br>
which of the foregoing types of film seams 134 (i.e., abutting, overlapping or spaced<br>
apart) that is formed on the gelcap product 122, the film seam 134 lies substantially in<br>
the transverse plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10. It should be understood that the<br>
foregoing discussion of the possible types of film seams also applies to all embodiments<br>
of the present invention discussed hereinafter.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14 and 16, the film coatings of the resulting gelcaps 122<br>
conform tightly and snugly to the cores 10, thereby resulting in tamper-proof gelcap<br>
products 122. In addition, the resulting gelcap product 122 is bi-colored, the film seam<br>
134 lying in the transverse plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10 and the color transition<br>
136 lying in the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10. As a result, the color<br>
transition 136 of each of the gelcaps 122 may be flush and seamless (i.e., without any<br>
raised portion which generally characterizes the film seam 134). In addition, the<br>
is foregoing process may result in gelcap products 122 having a film coating of uniform<br>
color quality and thickness over their entire surface.<br>
If aesthetically desired, the films 32, 32' may be aligned such that the<br>
resulting gelcaps 122 have a film seam 134 wherein a stripe of one color (for example,<br>
a red stripe 84) (or visual distinction) of one film 32 abuts or overlaps a stripe of another<br>
color (for example, a yellow stripe 90' I (or visual distinction) of the other film 32' to form<br>
a gelcap 122 having a "checkerboard pattern", i.e., having four quadrants of alternating<br>
red and yellow colors (or other visual distinctions) (not shown).<br><br><br>
After being cut and released from the bonded films 32, 32' in a manner<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983, the gelcaps 122 may be<br>
collected in collecting chutes and/or conveyors (not shown) and transported to further<br>
processing equipment (not shown) for further process steps in which the lubricants may<br>
be removed, the gelcaps 122 may be dried and/or, if desired, additional coatings or<br>
identifying markings may be added.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 17-21, the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention is directed to an alternative method for producing striped film having<br>
transversely oriented stripes, using rotary die apparatus and process that are nearly<br>
identical to those described above.<br>
With reference particularly, to FIGS. 17-19, a simplified, schematic<br>
representation is provided of an alternative film casting apparatus 136, which produces<br>
the aforesaid transversely striped film 138 for enrobing cores 10 in accordance with the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. More particularly, FIG. 17 shows an<br>
elevated side view of the alternative film casting apparatus 136, while FIG. 18 shows a<br>
top plan view thereof. FIG. 19 shows an elevated front view of the alternative film<br>
casting apparatus 136, as viewed from the position of line G-G in FIG. 18 and looking in<br>
the direction of the arrows.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 17, the alternative film casting apparatus 136<br>
includes film receiving means, such as a conventional metal casting belt 140 that is<br>
mounted onto two rotating drums 142, 144 for receiving the film 138 being cast<br>
thereon, as described in further detail hereinafter. The rotating drums 142, 144 rotate at<br>
a controllable rate in the directions indicated by the arrows H and I respectively, in FIG.<br><br><br>
17, thereby causing the casting belt 140 to move in the directions indicated by the<br>
arrows J and K. While the casting belt 140 can be made of suitable materials other than<br>
metal that will removably receive the film 138 thereon, such as carbon steel or stainless<br>
steel available from Belt Technology of Agawam, Massachusetts, metal is the preferred<br>
material. The surface of the casting belt 140 may be polished to reduce the tendency of<br>
the film 138 to stick thereon. In addition, a warming plate 148 may be positioned<br>
adjacent to the casting belt 140 to warm the casting belt 140 prior to casting film<br>
thereon, for a purpose discussed hereinafter. A cooling plate 150 is positioned adjacent<br>
to the casting belt 140 to cool the casting belt 140 after film is cast thereon, for a<br>
purpose that is also discussed hereinafter.<br>
As shown in each of FIGS. 17-19, the alternative film casting apparatus<br>
136 further includes film depositing means, such as a reciprocating multi-chamber slit<br>
extruder 146, for depositing the film 138, in a semi-continuous manner, as described<br>
hereinafter, onto the casting belt 138. Such extruders are conventional and well known<br>
to persons having ordinary skill in the art and are available commercially from various<br>
sources, including, but not limited to, Wenger Manufacturing of Kansas City, Missouri<br>
and Coperion Corporation of Ramsey, New Jersey. The configuration and operation of<br>
the slit extruder 146 are nearly identical to those of the slit extruder 38 of the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. More particularly, as with the slit extruder 38<br>
previously discussed hereinabove, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 includes interior<br>
partitions 152, 154, 156 that form interior chambers 158, 160, 162, 164 for holding<br>
visually distinct stock film forming material 166, 168 therein. As shown in FIG. 18, red<br>
stock film forming material 166 is held in chambers 158, 162 and yellow stock film<br><br><br>
forming material 168 is held in chambers 160, 164. A slit 170 is also provided, through<br>
which the stock film forming materials 166, 168 flow out of the chambers 158, 160, 162,<br>
164 and onto the casting belt 140, thereby creating a striped film 138 as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The reciprocating slit extruder 146 also includes supply means, such as<br>
feeder pipes 182, 184 for supplying the stock film forming materials 166, 168 to each of<br>
the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164 and flow control means, such as a slidable gate 180<br>
(see FIG. 19), for controlling the flow of the stock film forming materials 166, 168 from<br>
the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164. The width of the slit 170, and, thereby, the thickness<br>
of the resulting film 138, is adjusted by moving the slidable gate 180 in the directions<br>
indicated by arrow L in FIG. 19. In addition, as with the slit extruder 38 previously<br>
discussed hereinabove, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 of the second embodiment<br>
may be heated by conventional heating means, such as electric coils, or coils with hot<br>
water circulating therein (not shown), for the purpose of heating the stock film forming<br>
materials 166,168 to a flowable liquid state, (or maintaining the stock film forming<br>
materials 166, 168 at such state), such that the stock film forming materials 166, 168<br>
will flow easily out of each chamber 158, 160, 162, 164 and through the slit 170.<br>
Each of the interior partitions 152, 154, 156 of the reciprocating slit<br>
extruder 146 has stripe control means, such as a tapered blade edge (not shown, but<br>
similar to the tapered blade edges 94, 96, 98 of the partitions 58, 60, 62 shown in FIG.<br>
13 in connection with the first embodiment), to control the flow of the stock film forming<br>
materials 166, 168 exiting the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164. As with the slit extruder 38<br>
of the first embodiment, the taperec blade edges (not shown) of the interior partitions<br><br><br>
152, 154, 156 of the reciprocating slite extruder 146 ensure the formation of straight and<br>
consistent color transitions 186, 188, 190 between the stripes of the film 138 as the film<br>
138 is cast onto the casting belt 140.<br>
Also similar to the slit extruder 38 of the first embodiment, the<br>
reciprocating slit extruder 146 may include a top cover 192 to facilitate pressurizing its<br>
interior, by conventional pressurizing means (not shown), thereby promoting the flow of<br>
the stock film forming materials 166, 168 out of the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164.<br>
Alternatively, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 may include a rotatable interior roller<br>
(not shown) positioned therein (see FIG. 11), which would also promote the flow of the<br>
stock film forming materials 166, 168 out of the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164.<br>
With reference, in particular, to FIGS. 18 and 19, one notable difference<br>
between the slit extruder 38 of the first embodiment and the reciprocating slit extruder<br>
146 of the second embodiment is that the reciprocating slit extruder 146 is connected to<br>
a conventional motor (not shown), in a manner that is known and familiar to those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art, such that it moves reciprocatingly in the directions<br>
indicated by arrow M in FIG. 18. For example, suitable reciprocating mechanisms are<br>
discussed in the following two books: Sclater and Chironis, Mechanisms and<br>
Mechanical Devices Sourcebook, Oh. 4 Reciprocating Mechanisms, McGraw-Hill<br>
Professional, June 2001 and Jones, et al., Ingenious Mechanism, Vol. 1 Driving<br>
Mechanisms for Reciprocating Parts, Industrial Press, Nov. 1990, both of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
More particularly, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 is movable between a<br>
first position 194 (shown in phantom in FIG. 19) and a second position 196 (also shown<br><br><br>
in phantom in FIG. 19), for a purpose described in detail hereinafter. Such movement of<br>
the reciprocating slit extruder 146 occurs at a constant speed and at timed intervals that<br>
are controlled and regulated by a combination of conventional motors (not shown) and<br>
registering means (not shown), such as those mentioned above in connection with the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Other notable differences between the slit extruder 38 of the first<br>
embodiment and the reciprocating slit extruder 146 relate to the operation of the<br>
reciprocating slit extruder 146 and will become apparent from the following description.<br>
The operation of the alternative film casting apparatus 136, by which the transversely<br>
striped film 138 is produced, will now be described in detail, using FIGS. 17-19 as<br>
references.<br>
Initially, the feeder pipes 182, 184 supply stock film forming materials 166,<br>
168 of two colors, such as red and yellow, respectively, to alternate chambers 158, 160,<br>
162, 164, respectively, of the reciprocating slit extruder 146. The conventional heating<br>
means (not shown) of the reciprocating slit extruder 146 is activated, thereby heating or<br>
maintaining the stock film forming materials 166, 168 within the chambers 158, 160,<br>
162, 164 to a predetermined temperature, at which the stock film forming materials 166,<br>
168 becomes or is maintained as liquid and flowable. The warming plate 148 may also<br>
be warmed to a predetermined temperature that is sufficient to maintain the aforesaid<br>
liquid and flowable characteristics of the stock material 166, 168 for a brief amount of<br>
time. The preferred temperatures for the stock material 166, 168 and the warming plate<br>
148 are determined, based upon the type of stock material 166, 168 being used, in the<br><br><br>
same manner as described hereinabove in connection with the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The cooling plate 150 is cooled by conventional cooling means (not<br>
shown) to a predetermined temperature that will, at least partially, solidify the stock<br>
material 166, 168 upon physical contact with the surface of the casting belt 140 to form<br>
the transversely striped film 138, as described in further detail hereinafter. One skilled<br>
in the art would readily appreciate, without undue experimentation, that the proper<br>
predetermined cooled temperature for the cooling plate 150 will depend upon a number<br>
of factors, including the type and composition of the stock film forming materials 166,<br>
168 and the desired thickness of the transversely striped film 138, and may be<br>
determined in the same manner as described earlier hereinabove in connection with<br>
preferred temperature for the casting drum 34 of the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
After the stock film forming materials 166, 168, the warming plate 148 and<br>
the cooling plate 150 have attained their desired temperatures, a portion 198 of the<br>
casting belt 140 is warmed by the warming plate 148 and is then advanced by the<br>
rotating drums 142, 144 to a position underneath the reciprocating slit extruder 146.<br>
The slidable gate 180 is then moved to a position which opens the slit 170 to the<br>
thickness that is desired for the striped film 138. While the rotating drums 142, 144 and<br>
the casting belt 140 remain stationary, the stock film forming materials 166, 168 flow out<br>
of the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164, along the tapered blade edges (not shown),<br>
through the slit 170 and onto the warmed portion 198 of the casting belt 140, which<br>
briefly maintains the stock material 166, 168 in a substantially liquid, flowable state.<br><br><br>
Simultaneously with the flow of the stock film forming materials 166, 168<br>
onto the casting belt 140, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 is moved from its first<br>
position 194, at a constant predetermined speed, in the direction indicated by the arrow<br>
N in FIG. 19, to its second position 196, where it is temporarily halted. As soon as the<br>
reciprocating slit extruder 146 reaches its second position 196, the slidable gate 180 is<br>
moved to a closed position, thereby blocking the slit 170 and temporarily halting the flow<br>
of stock film forming materials 166, 168, which results in the formation of a film segment<br>
200. As seen in FIG. 18, the film segment 200 has alternating, transversely oriented<br>
red stripes 172, 176 and yellow stripes 174, 178 with straight and consistent color<br>
transitions 186, 188, 190 therebetween. The film segment 200 also has a first edge<br>
202, a second edge 204 and a width 206, which equals the sum of the widths of the<br>
stripes 172, 174, 176, 178.<br>
Next, the casting belt 140 is moved by the rotating drums 142, 144 in the<br>
direction shown by arrows J and K in FIG. 17, such that the film segment 200 is moved<br>
in the direction of the arrow J and a newly warmed portion of the casting belt 140 is<br>
positioned beneath the reciprocating slit extruder 140. More particularly, the casting<br>
belt 140 is moved until the first and second edges 202, 204 of the film segment 200 are<br>
each advanced by a distance that is equal to the width 206 of the film segment 200, in<br>
order to make room for the casting of a second film segment that will be contiguous with<br>
the first film segment 200. It is noted that the cooling plate 150 is preferably positioned<br>
adjacent and beneath the casting belt 140 at the location to which the first film segment<br>
200 is moved. Thus, the first film segment 200 is cooled while the second film segment<br>
is cast onto the casting belt 140. It will be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in<br><br><br>
the art, that the movements of the rotating drums 142, 144 and the casting belt 140<br>
described above can be readily maneuvered and controlled by motors (not shown) and<br>
registration devices (not shown) that are well known and conventional, as discussed<br>
hereinabove.<br>
When it is desired to cast a subsequent film segment, with the<br>
reciprocating slit extruder 146 now in its second position 196 and the casting belt 140<br>
held stationary, the slidable gate 180 is again moved to a position which opens the slit<br>
170 by an amount that is equal to the thickness desired for the striped film 138. As the<br>
stock film forming materials 166, 168 flow out of the chambers 158, 160, 162, 164 and<br>
onto the casting belt 140, the reciprocating slit extruder 146 is moved from its second<br>
position 196, at a constant predetermined speed, back to its first position 194, where it<br>
is again temporarily halted. As the stock film forming materials 166, 168 are being cast<br>
onto the casting belt 140, the first edge of the new film segment will meet and bond with<br>
the second edge 204 of the first film segment 200. After the reciprocating slit extruder<br>
146 returns to its first position 194, the slidable gate 180 is again moved to its closed<br>
position, thereby blocking the slit 170 and temporarily halting the flow of stock film<br>
forming materials 166, 168, which results in the creation of a new film segment that is<br>
bonded to the first film segment 200.<br>
The foregoing process steps are repeated continuously, resulting in a film<br>
casting process that is semi-continuous and which produces a continuous ribbon of<br>
transversely striped film 138. The transversely striped film 138 is continuously removed<br>
from the casting belt 140 by a scraper or similar, known device (not shown) and<br>
advanced in the direction of arrow J in FIG. 17. The transversely striped film 138 is then<br><br><br>
fed into the rotary die enrobing apparatus 102 for enrobing cores 10 as described above<br>
in connection with the first embodiment of the present invention. It is noted that, as<br>
shown in FIG. 20, except for the orientation of the recesses 210, 210' on the rotary dies<br>
208, 208' (see FIG. 20) and the orientation of the cores 10 that are dispensed to nip<br>
between the rotary dies 208, 208' (see FIG. 20) by the core dispensing means 118, the<br>
enrobing apparatus 102 and its method of operation remain substantially unchanged.<br>
More particularly, as can be seen in FIG. 20, because the alternative film<br>
casting apparatus 136 produces film 138 having stripes 172, 174, 176, 178 that are<br>
transversely oriented, the rotary dies 208, 208' of the second embodiment must have<br>
recesses 210, 210' which are oriented such that their lengths 212, 212' are aligned<br>
perpendicularly to the axes of rotation AR, AR' of their respective rotary dies 208, 208'.<br>
In addition, in accordance with the second embodiment, the core dispensing means (not<br>
shown) must orient and dispense each core 10 to the nip between the dies 208, 208'<br>
end-first, i.e., such that one of the ends 12, 14 of each caplet 10 simultaneously<br>
contacts the converging films 138, 138' as the core 10 enters the nip. In such an<br>
orientation of the cores 10, the color transitions 186, 188, 190, 186', 188', 190' of the<br>
films 138, 138', respectively, lie in the conjugate planes of symmetry 18 of their<br>
corresponding cores 10 as the cores 10 ent€sr the nip and are enrobed between the<br>
rotary dies 208, 208'. In this regard, FIG. 21 (which is similar to FIG. 15) provides a<br>
visual example of the proper positioning of the cores 10, at the nip between the dies<br>
208, 208', in between the transversely striped films 138, 138' and relative to the color<br>
transitions 186, 188, 190, 186', 188', 190' thereof, respectively.<br><br><br>
As shown in FIG. 20, the resulting gelcap products 214 are bi-colored,<br>
having a film seam 216 that lies in the transverse plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10,<br>
and having a color transition 218 that lies in the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the<br>
core 10. The color transition 218 of the gelcap 214 may be flush and seamless, i.e.,<br>
without any raised portion, and the film coating may be of uniform thickness and color<br>
quality over the entire surface of the gelcap 214. If aesthetically desired, the films 138,<br>
138' may be aligned such that the resulting gelcaps 214 have a film seam 216 wherein<br>
a stripe of one color or visual distinct on (for example, a red stripe 172) of one film 138<br>
abuts or overlaps a stripe of anothei color or visual distinction (for example, a yellow<br>
stripe 178') of the other film 138' to form a gelcap 214 having a "checkerboard pattern"<br>
(not shown), i.e., having four quadrants of alternating red and yellow colors or other<br>
visual distinctions.<br>
After being cut and released from the bonded films 138, 138' in the same<br>
manner as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,730 and 5,459,983, the gelcaps 214<br>
may be collected in collecting chutes and/or conveyors (not shown) and transported to<br>
further processing equipment (not shown) for further process steps in which the<br>
lubricants may be removed, the gelcaps 214 may be dried and/or, if desired, additional<br>
coatings or identifying markings may be added.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS 22-30, the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention is directed to an alternative enrobing apparatus (see, especially, FIGS. 22 and<br>
26), which includes the alternative film casting apparatus 136 of the second<br>
embodiment and the transversely striped film 138 produced thereby. In a process<br>
described in detail hereinafter, the transversely striped film 138 is fed, along with the<br><br><br>
cores 10, into the alternative enrobing apparatus to produce bi-colored gelcap products,<br>
each having a film seam that only partially circumscribes the gelcap and which lies in a<br>
reference plane that is different from the reference plane in which the color transition of<br>
the gelcap lies.<br>
With reference initially to FIGS. 22, 23 and 26-30, the alternative enrobing<br>
apparatus in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention includes a<br>
conveyor system 220 (see FIG. 22) that comprises a series of horizontally-oriented<br>
rollers 222 and pairs of rollers, 224, 226, 228 (see FIGS. 26-30), for supporting and<br>
conveying the transversely striped film 138. The conveyor system 220 will be described<br>
in greater detail hereinafter in connection with FIG. 26.<br>
It will be recalled that the film 138 has alternate transversely-oriented red<br>
stripes 172, 176 and yellow stripes 174, 178 with color transitions 186, 188, 190<br>
therebetween (see, e.g., FIGS. 18 and 20), although, as set forth above, any stock film<br>
forming materials having other colors or other visual distinctions or appearances are<br>
suitable. A core dispensing means 230 is positioned above the conveyor system 220<br>
and the film 138 for the purpose of dispensing the cores 10 onto the film 138 in the<br>
required orientation with respect to the color transitions 186, 188, 190 (see, e.g., FIGS.<br>
25A-25C).<br>
The core dispensing means 230 includes a core hopper 232 for holding<br>
the cores 10 to be enrobed prior to their entry into a series of slat feeders 234, 236,<br>
which are of a well-known type and are commercially available from DT Lasko Merrill of<br>
Leominster, Massachusetts, as well as from Aylward Enterprises, Inc. of New Bern,<br>
North Carolina and Integrated Packaging Systems, Inc. of Parsippany, New Jersey.<br><br><br>
The slat feeders 234, 236 typically include a series of internal brushes and wheels (not<br>
shown) that orient the cores as required for proper positioning onto the film 138.<br>
The core dispensing means 230 further includes a core positioning slat<br>
238 and a core plunger 240, which is positioned above the positioning slat 238 and is<br>
moved reciprocatingly in the directions shown by the arrow P in FIG.22 by a<br>
conventional motor (not shown), such as a hydraulic motor (not shown), in a well-known<br>
manner. A registering means 242 (shown schematically only in FIG. 22) is also<br>
included to assist in the proper positioning of the caplets 10 onto the film 138, as<br>
described hereinafter. The registering means 242 includes any one of many<br>
conventional, known types of optical sensory and control devices (not shown, but<br>
discussed above in connection with the first embodiment). The registering means 242<br>
also includes conventional, known mechanical adjusting means (not shown), such as a<br>
stepper motor (not shown), for adjusting the speed and position of the advancing film<br>
138 on the conveyor system 220, as necessary. Such stepper motors are commercially<br>
available from various sources includ ng, but not limited to, Bayside of Port Washington,<br>
New York, and are well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The positioning slat 238, more particularly, has a pair of external walls<br>
244, 246, each with a core support rail 248, 250, respectively, one of which is shown in<br>
phantom in FIG. 22 and the other of which is partially visible in FIG. 23. The walls 244,<br>
246 are sized and shaped so as to receive therebetween caplets 10 having their<br>
transverse planes of symmetry 16 aligned with the length of the walls 244, 246, as can<br>
best be seen in FIGS. 25A-25C. The support rails 248, 250 are each attached to the<br>
inner surfaces 252, 254, respectively, of the walls 244, 246, and are sized and shaped<br><br><br>
such that each core 10 within the positioning slat 238 is slideably supported<br>
simultaneously by each support rail 248, 250. Moreover, the walls 244, 246 are spaced<br>
apart from one another a sufficient distance such that the cores 10 are in frictional, but<br>
movable, contact with the inner surfaces 252, 254 of the walls 244, 246. Thus, when<br>
the cores 10 are no longer supported by the support rails 248, 250, as described<br>
hereinafter, they are temporarily held suspended above the conveyor system 220 and<br>
the film 138.<br>
In FIGS. 23 and 24A, it can be seen that the inner corners 256, 258 of the<br>
support rails 248, 250 may be rounded to prevent gouging or other physical damage to<br>
the cores 10 as they slide therealong. It is noted that, depending upon the configuration<br>
of the cores 10, the shape of the inner corners 256, 258 of the support rails 248, 250<br>
can be modified. For example, where the cores 10 have a land 22, the inner corners<br>
need not be rounded, but rather, they may be 90-degree corners 256', 258' (as shown<br>
in FIG. 24D).<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 24A-24C and 25A-25C, the operation of the<br>
core dispensing apparatus 230, and especially the positioning slat 238 and plunger 240,<br>
will now be described. It is noted that FIGS. 24A-24C show the positioning slat 238, the<br>
plunger 240, the film 138 and cores 10', 10", as viewed from the position of line Q-Q in<br>
FIG. 22 and looking in the direction of the arrov/s. FIGS. 25A-25C show side views of a<br>
portion of the positioning slat 238, as well as the plunger 240, the film 138, and cores<br>
10', 10", as seen from within the positioning slat 238 (i.e., as if the nearest wall 244 and<br>
corresponding support rail 248 were eliminated).<br><br><br>
During continuous operation, which is the preferred mode of operation in<br>
accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention, the cores 10 are fed<br>
from the hopper 232, through the slat feeders 234, 236, to the positioning slat 238, in a<br>
known manner. As they are fed into the positioning slat 238, the cores 10', 10", 10'" are<br>
lined up, end 12 to end 14, as shown in FIGS. 25A-25C and 26, and, thereby, each core<br>
10', 10", 10'" is moved along the positioning slat 238 in a substantially continuous<br>
manner by the core behind it.<br>
When a core 10' is pushed beyond the support rails 248, 250 and is no<br>
longer supported thereby, and when the position of a color transition 186 of the film 138<br>
lies in the conjugate plane of symmetry 18' of the core 10', the registering means 242<br>
signals the motor (not shown), which the moves the plunger 240 in the direction shown<br>
by the arrows R, R' in FIGS. 24A and 25A, respectively. The plunger 240 moves in the<br>
direction of the arrows R, R' until the core 10' contacts and rests upon the film 138 (see<br>
FIGS. 24B and 25B), whereupon the plunger 240 momentarily stops its descent and is<br>
then moved in the opposite direction, shown by the arrows S, S' in FIGS. 24B and 25B,<br>
respectively. When the plunger 240 reaches its upmost position, as shown in FIGS.<br>
24C, 25C, it momentarily stops, until the next core 10" is moved beyond the support<br>
rails 248, 250. The foregoing events are repeated continuously as long as cores 10 are<br>
fed and moved through the positioning slat 238<br>
With reference now, in particular, to FIGS. 26-30, the remaining<br>
components of the alternative enrobing apparatus of the third embodiment, as well as<br>
their operation, will now be described. More particularly, FIG. 26 shows a schematic<br>
perspective view of the positioning) slat 238, the conveyor system 220 having<br><br><br>
specialized rollers 222 and pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228 and a pair of rotary dies 260,<br>
262. It is noted that the rotary dies 260, 262 are similar, but not identical, to the rotary<br>
dies 112, 112', 208, 208' of the first and second embodiments discussed earlier<br>
hereinabove. As seen in FIG. 26, the rollers 222 and the pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228<br>
of the conveyor system 220 are arranged side-by-side.<br>
More particularly, the beginning portion of the conveyor system 220, i.e.,<br>
the portion that is located between the alternative film casting apparatus 136 (shown<br>
only partially in FIG. 22, see FIG. 17 for full view) and a short distance on the opposite<br>
side of the core positioning slat 238 (see FIG. 26), is comprised of horizontally-oriented<br>
rollers 222. FIG. 27 shows an elevational end view of a core 10, the film 138 and a<br>
horizontally-oriented roller 222, in their relative positions to one another, as seen from<br>
the position of line T-T in FIG. 26 and looking in the direction of the arrows.<br>
The film 138 is moved by the horizontally-oriented rollers 222 (see FIG.<br>
22), from the alternative film casting apparatus 136 to a short distance past the<br>
positioning slat 238 and plunger 240, by which cores 10 have already been deposited<br>
onto the film 138, as described hereinabove. It is noted that the horizontally oriented<br>
rollers 222 should be at least as long as the width of the film 138, to ensure sufficient<br>
support for the film 138. The horizontally-oriented rollers 222 may spin about their<br>
longitudinal axes 264 in the direction shown by the arrow U in FIG. 27.<br>
As shown in FIG. 26, the remaining portion of the conveyor system 220,<br>
which is located between a short distance past the positioning slat 238 and the rotary<br>
dies 260, 262, is comprised of pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228, rather than the horizontally-<br>
oriented rollers 222. As shown schematically in FIG. 26, the individual rollers of<br><br><br>
sequential pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228 are gradually and sequentially pivoted upward<br>
from the horizontal plane, in increments of about 10 degrees for each successive pair of<br>
rollers 224, 226, 228, starting proximate to the positioning slat 238, such that, as the film<br>
138 approaches the rotary dies 260, 262, the film 138 is folded longitudinally about the<br>
cores 10.<br>
More particularly, the individual rollers 224a, 224b of the pairs of rollers<br>
224 that are located proximately to the positioning slat 238 are pivoted upward a small<br>
amount, i.e., about 30 degrees (see HG. 28 showing the degree to which the individual<br>
rollers 224a, 224b at this location are pivoted, as seen approximately from the position<br>
of line V-V in FIG. 26 and looking in the direction of the arrows). As shown in FIG. 28,<br>
the individual rollers 224a, 224b h these pairs 224 may each spin about their<br>
longitudinal axes 266a, 266b in the directions indicated by the arrows Wa, Wb.<br>
By comparison, the individual rollers 226a, 226b of the pairs of rollers 226<br>
that are located further from the positioning slat 238 are pivoted upward by a greater<br>
amount, i.e., about 70 degrees (see FIG. 29 showing the degree to which the individual<br>
rollers 226a, 226b at this location are pivoted, as seen from the position of line X-X in<br>
FIG.26 and looking in the direction of the arrows). As shown in FIG. 29, the individual<br>
rollers 226a, 226b in these pairs 226 each spin about their longitudinal axes 268a, 268b<br>
in the directions indicated by the arrows Ya, Yb.<br>
Lastly, as shown in FIGS. 26 and 30, the individual rollers 228a, 228b of<br>
the pairs of rollers 228 which are proximate to the rotary dies 260, 262 are configured<br>
differently from the other individual rollers 224a, 224b, 226a, 226b. More particularly,<br>
the individual rollers 228a, 228b of these pairs of rollers 228 each have a concave<br><br><br>
central portion 270a, 270b which cooperate to form an opening 272 therebetween that<br>
is sized and shaped to allow the film 138 and cores 10 to pass snugly therethrough.<br>
Each individual roller 228a, 228b also has a cylindrical upper portion 274a, 274b which<br>
cooperate with one another to press the longitudinal edges 276, 278 of the film 138<br>
against one another (see FIG. 30), thereby bonding the longitudinal edges 276, 278 of<br>
the film 138 to one another prior to passing through the rotary dies 260, 262. FIG. 30<br>
shows that the individual rollers 228a, 228b of the pairs of rollers 228 at this location are<br>
oriented substantially vertically, as seen from the position of line Z-Z in FIG. 26 and<br>
looking in the direction of the arrows. As also shown in FIG. 30, the individual rollers<br>
228a, 228b of these pairs of rollers 228 may each rotate about their longitudinal axes<br>
280a, 280b in the directions indicated by the arrows AAa, AAb.<br>
It is noted that different configurations are possible for the individual rollers<br>
224a, 224b, 226a, 226b, 228a, 228b and the pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228, for example,<br>
one roller 224a, 226a, 228a in each pair could be horizontally positioned and remain<br>
stationary, while the other roller 224b, 226b, 228b in each pair is pivoted. In addition,<br>
depending upon the support requirements of the film 138, greater or fewer numbers of<br>
horizontally-oriented rollers 222 and pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228 may be used for the<br>
conveyor system 220 and they may be spaced more closely or further apart than shown<br>
in the accompanying figures.<br>
The rotary dies 260, 262 of the third embodiment of the present invention,<br>
shown in FIG. 26, are similar to the rotary dies 112, 112', 208, 208' of the first and<br>
second embodiments in that they rotate in the directions indicated by the arrows BB and<br>
CC, respectively, in FIG. 26, thereby cooperating with one another to form a nip<br><br><br>
therebetween, into which the cores 10 and the film 138 are fed. Likewise, each of the<br>
dies 260, 262 have recesses 282, 284, arranged circumferentially in a row on the<br>
surface of each die 260, 262. The recesses 282, 284 each have raised rims (not<br>
shown) for sealing and cutting the bonded film 138 about the cores 10, thereby enrobing<br>
the cores 10 to form gelcap products 286.<br>
The rotary dies 260, 262 of the third embodiment, however, are oriented<br>
such that they rotate in the horizontal plane, rather than in the vertical plane as do the<br>
previously discussed rotary dies 112, 112', 208, 208'. Furthermore, when the cores 10<br>
are fed into the nip between the dies 260, 262 of the third embodiment, the film 138 is<br>
folded and partially bonded about them. Furthermore, the partially enrobed caplets 10<br>
are fed successively, i.e., one-by-one, into the nip between the dies 260, 262.<br>
The gelcap products 286 of the third embodiment are similar to the<br>
gelcaps 122, 214 of the previous embodiments, in that they are gelcaps 286 having at<br>
least two visually distinct, or differently colored, portions and having film seams 288<br>
which are transversely oriented relative to the color transitions 290 (or other visual<br>
distinction transitions) of the gelcaps 286. More particularly, the film seam 288 lies in<br>
the transverse plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10 and the color transition 290 lies in<br>
the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10. In addition, in contrast to gelcaps<br>
produced by apparatus and methods of the prior art, the color transition 290 of the<br>
gelcap 286 of the third embodiment may be flush and seamless, i.e., without any raised<br>
portion which generally characterizes the film seam 288 of gelcaps. Moreover, the<br>
gelcaps 286 may have a film coating of uniform color quality and thickness over their<br>
entire surface. It is noted, however, that unlike the gelcaps 122, 214 of the previously<br><br><br>
described embodiments, the film seams 288 of the gelcaps 286 that are produced by<br>
the apparatus and process of the third embodiment extend only partially about the cores<br>
10. If aesthetically desired, the film 138 may overlap slightly at its edges along the film<br>
seam 288.<br>
As will be appreciated by those persons with ordinary skill and experience<br>
in the present field, it is possible to substitute other known, conventional cutting devices<br>
in place of the rotary dies 260, 262 shown in FIG. 26. For example, die punches (not<br>
shown), or reciprocating uniplasts (iot shown), having recesses or cutouts that are<br>
sized and shaped to receive therein the partially enrobed caplets 10 could be used.<br>
Such devices are commercially available from various sources, including, but not limited<br>
to, The Irwin-Hodson Company of Portland Oregon, and are well-known to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art. In addition, alternative reciprocating cutting apparatus which<br>
relates to producing enrobed capsule products is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,352,719, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
With reference to the movement of the transversely striped film 138 along<br>
the conveyor system 220 of horizontally-oriented rollers 222 and pairs of rollers 224,<br>
226, 228, it is noted that the film 138 is encouraged to move, continuously and at a<br>
substantially constant speed, in the direction of the arrow DD in FIG. 26, by the nip<br>
between the rotary dies 260, 262 and the momentum of the horizontally-oriented rollers<br>
222 and the pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228 as they spin about their axes. Alternatively, or<br>
in addition thereto, one or more of the horizonl:ally-oriented rollers 222 and the pairs of<br>
rollers 224, 226, 228 could be mechanized by conventional motors (not shown) to spin<br><br><br>
autonomously, thereby encouraging the film 138 to move along the conveyor system<br>
220 toward the rotary dies 260, 262.<br>
With reference to the stack film forming material that is used in connection<br>
with the foregoing alternative core er robing apparatus of the third embodiment, when it<br>
is either thermoplastic starch-based material or cellulose-based material, as suggested<br>
hereinabove, the transversely striped film 138 must be heated prior to being advanced<br>
along the portion of the conveyor system 220 that is comprised of pivoted pairs of rollers<br>
224, 226, 228 to ensure that the film 138 is sufficiently formable and malleable to be<br>
folded about the caplets 10 by the pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228, while maintaining its<br>
physical integrity. In such circumstances, the film 138 can be heated by conventional<br>
heating means, such as, for example, a resistive heating device (not shown) which<br>
would heat the film 138 indirectly by heating selected horizontally-oriented rollers 222<br>
and pairs of rollers 224, 226, 228, or hot air blowers (not shown) which could heat the<br>
film 138 directly by blowing hot air thereon. Suitable heaters are commercially<br>
available, for example, from Chrorrolox, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Watlow<br>
Electric Manufacturing Company of St. Louis, Missouri. Suitable hot air blowers are<br>
commercially available, for example, from New York Blower Company of Willowbrook,<br>
Illinois and Niagara Blower Company of Buffalo, New York.<br>
More particularly, where the film 138 is made of starch-based material, the<br>
film 138 should be heated to between about 50 degrees Celsius and about 150 degrees<br>
Celsius and where the film 138 is made of cellulose-based material, the film 138 should<br>
be heated to between about 80 degrees Celsius and about 120 degrees Celsius.<br><br><br>
The fourth embodiment of the present invention, which relates to a<br>
vacuum forming apparatus and method of enrobing cores is generally illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 31-43. It is noted that, while various types of thermal formable films, including<br>
films made of the previously discussed gelatin-, starch- and polymer-based materials,<br>
may be used in connection with the fourth embodiment of the present invention, films<br>
made of cellulose ether-based materials, e.g. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, are the<br>
preferred films to be used in connection with the apparatus and method described<br>
hereinafter. However, while the composition of the film may be the same or similar to<br>
that of the films discussed hereinabove, the film that is used in connection with the<br>
apparatus of the fourth embodiment is pre-manufactured as a dry film, rather than the<br>
wet films that were described previously in connection with the first, second and third<br>
embodiments.<br>
More particularly, to produce films that are suitable for use with the<br>
vacuum forming apparatus of the fourth embodiment, the wet films of the previous<br>
embodiments are subjected to a further drying step, which involves heating the film, in a<br>
manner that is well-known to the ar of film forming, to a temperature such that the film<br>
remains pliable, but no longer automatically bonds to itself upon contact. The dried film<br>
is then mounted onto rollers, as shown and described hereinafter in connection with<br>
FIG. 31. In addition, the dry films used in this fourth embodiment may also be subjected<br>
to further processing steps, including, but not limited to, the addition of humectants or<br>
plasticizers, such as glycerin or sorbitol, for the purpose of enhancing the elasticity and<br>
formability of the dry films. For example, from 0.1 to 10 weight percent of humectants,<br>
based upon the total weight of the dry film material, could be added to the dry films. In<br><br><br>
addition, from 5 to 50 weight percent of plasticizers, based upon the total weight of the<br>
dry film material, could be added to the dry films. It is also noted that, as discussed<br>
hereinafter, striped films having stripes that are either longitudinally or transversely<br>
oriented may be used in connection with the apparatus and method of the fourth<br>
embodiment, which will now be described in detail. Films having a thickness of<br>
between about 0.01 millimeters and about 0.5millimeters are most suitable for use in<br>
connection with this fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
With reference, in particular, to FIG. 31, a schematic elevational side view<br>
is provided of the vacuum forming apparatus 292 of the fourth embodiment. More<br>
particularly, the vacuum forming apparatus 292 includes a first plurality of individual<br>
porous platens 294, as well as a first conveyor system 296 and a second conveyor<br>
system 298. As shown schematically in FIG. 31, the first and second conveyor systems<br>
296, 298 are arranged in series with one another, thereby creating a single path,<br>
indicated by the arrows EE, FF, along which the first and second conveyor systems<br>
296, 298 move each of the porous platens 294 in semi-continuous fashion. For<br>
purposes of illustration only, the first and second conveyor systems 296, 298 are shown<br>
schematically in FIG. 31 mounted on tables 296', 298'. In addition, the first and second<br>
conveyer systems 296, 298 are provided with conventional vacuum sources 300, 302,<br>
respectively, (shown only schematically in FIG. 31) that apply a vacuum to each of the<br>
porous platens 294 while they are moved in the direction shown by the arrow EE, for a<br>
purpose to be discussed hereinafter. Suitable conventional vacuum sources, such as<br>
vacuum pumps, would be commercially available from, for example, The Nash<br><br><br>
Company of Trumbull, Connecticut and Gast Manufacturing of Benton Harbor,<br>
Michigan.<br>
It is noted that the first and second conveyor systems 296, 298 each<br>
include a conveyor mechanism, such as a conventional chain track (not shown) or other<br>
conventional mechanism of a type that is known in the art. More particularly, conveyor<br>
systems suitable for use in connection with the vacuum forming apparatus 292 of the<br>
present invention are typically custom manufactured and persons having ordinary skill in<br>
the art will be familiar with the basic configuration and operation of such devices.<br>
Suitable conveyor systems are currently commercially available from, for example,<br>
Dorner of Hartland, Wisconsin.<br>
With reference still to FIG. 31, the vacuum forming apparatus 292 further<br>
includes a second plurality of individual porous platens 304 and a third conveyor system<br>
306 that moves these porous platens 304 along a second path, which is shown by the<br>
arrow GG in FIG. 31. It is noted that the third conveyor system 306 is positioned<br>
between the first and second conveyor systems 296, 298 for a purpose that is clarified<br>
hereinafter.<br>
A rotating mechanism 308 (shown only schematically in FIG. 31) is<br>
positioned between the first and second conveyor systems 296, 298. The rotating<br>
mechanism 308 is a conventional device and well known to persons having ordinary<br>
skill in the art. The rotating mechanism 308 is designed to simultaneously hold together<br>
two of the platens, i.e., one platen 294 and a corresponding platen 304, and rotate them<br>
together, such that the platen 304 that is first on top is inverted and then positioned on<br><br><br>
the bottom after the rotation is completed. The aforesaid rotation will be described in<br>
further detail hereinafter.<br>
Except for their opposite orientations, the porous platens 294, 304 are<br>
essentially identical to one another. More particularly, as shown in phantom in certain<br>
of the porous platens 294, 304 in FIG. 31, each porous platen 294, 304 has at least one<br>
recess 310, 312, respectively, on a working surface 314, 316, respectively, thereof.<br>
Each recess 310, 312 is sized and shaped to temporarily but snugly receive therein a<br>
caplet 10 to be enrobed. With reference to FIGS. 33 and 35, it is noted that, although<br>
the porous platens 294, 304 are shown in FIG. 31 as each having a single longitudinally<br>
oriented recess 310, 312, it is noted that the porous platens 294, 304 may be configured<br>
to each have a plurality of recesses 310, 312. For example, the platens 294, 304 could<br>
each be long enough to include a single row of recesses 310, 312, or, as shown in<br>
FIGS. 33 and 35, each platen 294a, 294b could be long and wide enough to have<br>
multiple rows of recesses 310a, 310 D.<br>
In addition, it is noted that, if the orientation of the recesses 310a, 310b of<br>
the platens 294a, 294b is varied, the use of differently striped films can be<br>
accommodated, as follows. With reference to FIGS. 32 and 33, where the recesses<br>
310a are oriented longitudinally on the working surface 314a of the porous platen 294a<br>
(see FIG. 33) it is possible to use a striped film 318 having alternating colors or visual<br>
distinctions, e.g., red and yellow transverse stripes 320, 322 (see FIG. 32), to produce<br>
gelcap products having a color transition (or other visual distinction transition) that lies in<br>
the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10. The resulting product would<br>
resemble gelpcaps 122, 214, 286 produced in connection with the previously discussed<br><br><br>
embodiments of the present invention. In FIGS. 32 and 33, the transversely striped film<br>
318 is shown suspended above the platen 294a in the proper position relative to the<br>
recesses 310a, such that the color transitions 324, 326 between the transverse stripes<br>
320, 322 are properly aligned with the recesses 310a to result in the production of the<br>
aforesaid bi-colored enrobed core products.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 34 and 35, on the other hand, it is possible for the<br>
recesses 310b to be oriented transversely on the working surface 314b of the porous<br>
platen 294b (see FIG. 35) to accommodate the use of a striped film 328 having<br>
alternating colors or visual distinctions, e.g., red and yellow longitudinal stripes 330, 332<br>
(shown in FIG. 34), to produce gelcap products having a color transition lying in the<br>
conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10. In FIGS. 34 and 35, the longitudinally<br>
striped film 328 is shown suspended above the platen 294b in the proper position<br>
relative to the recesses 310b, such that the color transitions 334, 336 between the<br>
longitudinal stripes 330, 332 are properly aligned with the recesses 310b to result in the<br>
production of the aforesaid bi-colored caplet products.<br>
It is of course possible to achieve multi-colored gelcap products having<br>
color transitions oriented in a variety of different ways using different combinations of<br>
the platens 294a, 294b shown in FIGS. 33 and 35, with transversely and longitudinally<br>
striped films 318, 328, shown in FIGS. 32 and 34. In this regard, however, it is noted<br>
that, within a particular vacuum forming apparatus, the orientation of the recesses 310,<br>
312 in all of the platens 294, 304 must be longitudinal, or, alternatively, the orientation of<br>
the recesses 310, 312 in all of the platens 294, 304 must be transverse (or otherwise<br>
aligned with the orientation of the stripes on the films).<br><br><br>
With reference again to FIG. 31, the vacuum forming apparatus 292<br>
further includes a first pair of rollers 338, 340 having a first striped film 342 mounted<br>
thereon. As shown in FIG. 31, the first pair of rollers 338, 340 is positioned proximate to<br>
the first conveyor system 296 such that the first striped film 342 is suspended above the<br>
first plurality of porous platens 294 which are being moved thereon along the path<br>
shown by the arrow EE. A second pair of rollers 344, 346 having a second striped film<br>
348 mounted thereon is also provided. Like the first pair of rollers 338, 340, the second<br>
pair of rollers 344, 346 is positioned proximate to the second conveyor system 298 such<br>
that the second striped film 348 is also suspended above the first plurality of porous<br>
platens 294, which are being moved thereon along the path shown by the arrow EE.<br>
It is noted that, in order to produce gelcaps having a color transition, or<br>
transition between other visually distinct portions of the enrobed core 10, that lies in the<br>
conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10 using platens 294a like those of FIG. 33<br>
(i.e., all having longitudinally oriented recesses 310a), both the first and second striped<br>
films 342, 348 must have transversely oriented stripes 320, 322, as shown in FIG. 32.<br>
Similarly, in order to produce bi-colored gelcaps still having a color transition that lies in<br>
the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the caplet 10 using platens 294b like those of<br>
FIG. 35 (i.e., all having transversely oriented recesses 310b), it would be necessary for<br>
both the first and second striped films 342, 348 to have longitudinally oriented stripes,<br>
as shown in FIG. 34.<br>
The above-described variations concerning the orientation of the recesses<br>
310, 312 on the platens 294, 304 and the orientation of the stripes on the first and<br>
second films 342, 348 are all equally valid. However, for purposes of illustrating the<br><br><br>
fourth embodiment of the present invention in as simple and clear a manner as<br>
possible, henceforth, it will be understood that the platens 294, 304 of the vacuum<br>
forming apparatus 292 each have a single longitudinally oriented recess 310, 312<br>
thereon. Furthermore, it will henceforth also be understood that the first and second<br>
striped films 342, 348 both have alternating red and yellow stripes that are transversely<br>
oriented.<br>
As shown in FIG. 31 and discussed in further detail hereinafter, the<br>
vacuum forming apparatus 292 also includes a first registering device 350 positioned<br>
proximate to the first conveyor system 296 for properly positioning the first transversely<br>
striped film 342 relative to a core 10 that is positioned within the recess 310 of the<br>
porous platen 294, as will be described hereinafter. A second registering device 352 is<br>
positioned proximate to the second conveyor system 298 for properly positioning the<br>
second transversely striped film 348 relative to a partially enrobed caplet 10 that is<br>
positioned within the recess 310 of another of the porous platens 294, as will be<br>
described hereinafter. The registering devices 350, 352 are of the same commercially<br>
available type as were described previously above in connection with the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 31, 36-38 and 41-43, the vacuum forming apparatus<br>
292 of the fourth embodiment also includes a first ring press 354 and a first film cutter<br>
356 that are positioned proximate to the first conveyor system 296, for purposes that will<br>
be clarified hereinafter. Additionally, a second ring press 358 and a second film cutter<br>
360 are positioned proximate to the second conveyor system 298, also for purposes<br>
that will be clarified hereinafter. More particularly, with reference to FIGS. 36-37 and<br><br><br>
41-42, the first and second ring presses 354, 358 are virtually identical to one another,<br>
each having an open configuration, such as an O-shape or an oval shape, as viewed<br>
from above, such that there is formed a passageway 362, 364, respectively,<br>
therethrough. Each of the ring presses 354, 358 also has a contacting edge 366, 368,<br>
respectively, that is configured to contact the first and second films 342, 348,<br>
respectively, without damaging them. Each of the ring presses 354, 358 is sized and<br>
shaped such that the contacting edges 366, 368 circumscribe a core 10 therein. The<br>
first and second ring presses 354, 358 move reciprocatingly in the directions shown by<br>
the arrows HH, II, respectively, in FIG. 31.<br>
With reference, in particular, to FIGS. 38 and 43, the first and second film<br>
cutters 356, 360 are virtually identical to one another, each having a recess 370, 372,<br>
respectively, that is sized and shaped to receive therein a portion of a partially enrobed<br>
core 10 which already has a film coating applied thereto. Each recess 370, 372 is<br>
circumscribed by a tapered cutting edge 374, 376 that is sized and shaped to closely<br>
circumscribe the periphery of the aforesaid partially enrobed core 10 and is capable of<br>
cutting neatly and cleanly through the first and second transversely striped films 342,<br>
348, respectively. The first film cutler 356 is oriented such that its recess 370 and<br>
cutting edge 374 both face the porous platen 294 positioned thereunder. Similarly, the<br>
second film cutter 360 is oriented such that its recess 372 and cutting edge 376 also<br>
both face the porous platen 304 positioned thereunder. Also, like the ring presses 354,<br>
358, the first and second film cutters 356, 360 move reciprocatingly in the directions<br>
shown by the arrows HH, II in FIG. 31<br><br><br>
With reference still to FIG. 31, it is noted that the first transversely striped<br>
film 342 is mounted onto a first pair of rollers 338, 340 and stretched therebetween,<br>
such that the first film 342 is positioned between the first conveyor system 296 and the<br>
first plurality of porous platens 294 on one side, and the first ring press 354 and the first<br>
film cutter 356 on the other side. Similarly, the second transversely striped film 348 is<br>
mounted onto a second pair of rollers 344, 346 and stretched therebetween, such that<br>
the second film 348 is positioned between the second conveyor system 298 and the first<br>
plurality porous platens 294 on one side, and the second ring press 360 and the second<br>
film cutter 362 on the other side.<br>
As will be referred to subsequently herein, in connection with the<br>
description of the method of the fourth embodiment, the vacuum forming apparatus 292<br>
shown in FIG. 31 includes at least seven stations 378, 380, 382, 384, 386, 388, 390<br>
(shown in dotted lines in FIG. 31), each of which is shown in further detail in FIGS. 36-<br>
43. The aforesaid stations 378, 380, 382, 384, 386, 388, 390 show the general<br>
locations of the ring presses 354, 358, and the film cutters 356, 360, relative to the other<br>
components of the vacuum forming apparatus 292. The stations 378, 380, 382, 384,<br>
386, 388, 390 also provide a conceptual representation of the seven basic steps of the<br>
method of the fourth embodiment.<br>
The operation of the vacuum forming apparatus 292 and the method of<br>
the fourth embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail, with<br>
reference to FIGS. 31 and 36-44. In this regard, it is noted that FIGS. 36-44 show<br>
elevational cross-sectional views of certain components of the vacuum forming<br>
apparatus 292. More particularly, the cross-sections of the platens 294, the first ring<br><br><br>
press 354 and the first film cutter 356 shown in FIGS. 36-39 are taken along cross-<br>
section line JJ-JJ of FIG. 31 and are viewed from the same direction as when viewing<br>
the vacuum forming apparatus 292 shown in FIG. 31. The cross-sections of the platens<br>
304, the second ring press 358 and the second film cutter 360 shown in FIGS. 40-43<br>
are taken along cross-section line KK-KK of FIG. 31 and are also viewed from the same<br>
direction as when viewing the vacuum forming apparatus 292 shown in FIG. 31. It is<br>
further noted that the conveyor systems 296, 298, the registering devices 350, 352 and<br>
the vacuum sources 300, 302 are omitted from FIGS. 36-43 to simplify the description<br>
of the operation of the vacuum forming apparatus 292, by which cores 10 are enrobed<br>
with the first and second transversely striped films 342, 348.<br>
Initially, the first, second and third conveyor systems 296, 298, 306 are set<br>
into motion, thereby moving the porous platens 294, 304 in the directions indicated by<br>
the arrows EE, FF, GG, respectively, in FIG. 31. The vacuum sources 300, 302 are<br>
also activated, thereby applying vacuums, in the range of about 0.005 Torr to about 700<br>
Torr, to the first and second conveyor systems 296, 298, and, thereby in turn, to each of<br>
the first plurality of porous platens 294 that is being moved in the direction of the arrow<br>
EE.<br>
More specifically, with reference initially to FIG. 31, the first conveyor<br>
system 296 moves one of the porous platens 294 to a position that is immediately prior<br>
to the first station 378. A core 10 is placed into the recess 310 of this porous platen 294<br>
by a core dispensing mechanism (not shown). It is noted that the core dispensing<br>
mechanism of this fourth embodiment can be any one of conventional, well-known core<br>
dispensing mechanisms, such as those described previously in connection with the first,<br><br><br>
second and third embodiments. The core 10 is held firmly in the recess 310 by the<br>
aforementioned vacuum, which is continuously applied to the platen 294 and all others<br>
on the conveyor 298, by the first vacuum source 300.<br>
With reference now to both of FIGS. 31 and 36, the platen 294 is next<br>
moved by the first conveyor system 296 to the first station 378. Movement of the platen<br>
294 ceases temporarily when the first registering device 350 (see FIG. 31) confirms that<br>
the core 10 is properly positioned relative to the first striped film 342, i.e., such that the<br>
color transition 392 of the first striped film 342 (see FIG. 36) lies in the conjugate plane<br>
of symmetry 18 of the core 10.<br>
While the platen 294 is momentarily stationary, hot air is blown, by<br>
conventional, well-known means, such as a combined coil heater and fan device (not<br>
shown), through the passageway 362 of the first ring press 354, in the direction shown<br>
by the arrows LL in FIG. 36, thereby softening 1:he first film 342 to a formable state. The<br>
hot air should, preferably, be in the range of between about 50 degrees Celsius and<br>
about 300 degrees Celsius, depending upon the type of film used. The first ring press<br>
354 is then moved in the direction shown by the arrow MM in FIG. 36, such that the<br>
contacting edge 366 of the first ring press 354 presses the first film 342 onto the<br>
working surface 314 of the platen 294 and into contact with the top half of the core 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 37, the heated first film 342 is simultaneously pulled<br>
onto the core 10 and thereby made to conform to the shape of the top half of the core<br>
10 by the aforementioned vacuum that is applied to the platen 294 by the first vacuum<br>
source 300. The vacuum applied by the first vacuum source is in the aforesaid range of<br>
about 0.005 Torr to about 700 Torr. Thereafter, the first ring press 354 is moved away<br><br><br>
from the platen 294, in the direction shown by the arrow NN in FIG. 37, while the heated<br>
first film 342 is held onto the core 10 by the aforesaid vacuum.<br>
With continued reference to F:IG. 37, after the first ring press 354 is<br>
retracted, the platen 294, having the partially enrobed core 10 held in its recess 310 by<br>
the vacuum, is moved to the second station 380 of the vacuum forming apparatus 292,<br>
where it is temporarily stopped. While the platen 294 and the core 10 are temporarily<br>
stationary, cold air is blown onto the first film 342 and core 10 in the direction shown by<br>
the arrows LL in FIG. 37, thereby cooling and molding the first film 342 into conformity<br>
with the top half of the core 10. The cold air should be at a temperature that is<br>
sufficiently cool to stiffen the film 342 such that it retains its shape in conformity with the<br>
shape of the core 10, more particularly between about -10 degrees Celsius and about<br>
25 degrees Celsius.<br>
With reference now to FIG. 38, after sufficient time has passed to cool and<br>
mold the first film 342 onto the core 10, the platen 294 and partially enrobed core 10 are<br>
moved a predetermined distance by the first conveyor system 296 to the third station<br>
382 of the vacuum forming apparatus 292 and temporarily halted there such that the<br>
partially enrobed core 10 is aligned with the recess 370 and the cutting edge 374 of the<br>
first film cutter 356. As shown in FIG. 38, the first film cutter 356 is moved in the<br>
direction of the arrow OO until the partially enrobed core 10 is received snugly within the<br>
recess 370 and the tapered cutting edge 374 contacts and cuts through the first film 342<br>
closely around the perimeter of the partially enrobed core 10. The first film cutter 356 is<br>
then moved away from the platen 294 in a direction opposite the direction indicated by<br><br><br>
the arrow OO and scrap portions 394, 396 of the first film 342 are removed from the<br>
platen 294.<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 39 and 40, the platen 294 and partially<br>
enrobed core 10 are next moved to the fourth, or rotating, station 384 of the vacuum<br>
forming apparatus 292 and, agan, temporarily stopped, whereupon the partially<br>
enrobed core 10 is transferred to one of the platens 304, as follows. As shown in FIG.<br>
39, the third conveyor system 306 moves one of the platens 304 into position at the<br>
rotating station 384, such that it 304 is inverted relative to the platen 294 carrying the<br>
partially enrobed core 10 thereon. It is noted that the working surfaces 314, 316 of the<br>
platens 294, 304 are facing one another (see FIGS. 31, 39 and 40). After the platen<br>
294 is moved a predetermined distance, such that the partially enrobed core 10 is<br>
aligned with the recess 312 of the inverted platen 304, the first conveyor system 296<br>
holds the platen 294 and partially enrobed core 10 temporarily stationary at the rotating<br>
station 384. The platen 304 is then moved toward the partially enrobed core 10 (i.e., in<br>
the direction shown by the arrow PP in FIG. 39) until the partially enrobed core 10 is<br>
held within the recesses 310, 312 of both of the platens 294, 304 (as shown in FIGS. 31<br>
and 40). The vacuum being applied to the porous platen 294 is discontinued and the<br>
rotating mechanism 308 (shown schematically in FIG. 31) rotates the platens 294, 304,<br>
with the partially enrobed core 10 therebetween, in the direction shown by the arrows<br>
QQ, QQ' in FIGS. 31 and 40, whereupon the platen 294 holding the core 10 is inverted,<br>
and the platen 304 is moved into a right-side-up position. The now inverted platen 294<br>
is now moved away from the right-side-up platen 304 and becomes one of the platens<br>
304 moving along the path shown by the arrow GG in FIG. 31. The right-side-up platen<br><br><br>
304 is next moved onto the second conveyor system 298 and becomes one of the<br>
platens 294 moving along the path shown by the arrows EE, FF in FIG. 31. Next, the<br>
second vacuum source 302 applies a vacuum, in the aforesaid range of about 0.005<br>
Torr to about 700 Torr, to the partially enrobed core 10, thereby holding the partially<br>
enrobed core 10 within the recess 310 of the platen 294, which is now moving on the<br>
second conveyor system 298, such that the uncovered portion of the partially enrobed<br>
core 10 is exposed.<br>
FIGS. 41-43 show, schematically, the method by which the uncovered<br>
portion of the core 10 is covered by the second transversely striped film 248. More<br>
particularly, with reference in particular to FIGi. 41, the platen 294 and partially enrobed<br>
core 10 are moved by the second conveyor system 298 to the fifth station 386 of the<br>
vacuum forming apparatus 292. Movement of the platen 294 ceases temporarily when<br>
the second registering device 352 (see FIG. 31) confirms that the partially enrobed core<br>
10 is properly positioned relative to tie second striped film 248, i.e., such that the color<br>
transition 398 of the second striped film 348 (see FIG. 41) lies in the conjugate plane of<br>
symmetry 18 of the partially enrobed core 10.<br>
While the platen 294 is momentarily stationary, hot air is blown, by<br>
conventional, well-known means, such as a combined coil heater and fan device (not<br>
shown), through the passageway 364 of the second ring press 358, in the direction<br>
shown by the arrows RR in FIG. 41, which softens the second film 348 to a formable<br>
state. The hot air is preferably in the aforesaid range of about 50 degrees Celsius to<br>
about 300 degrees Celsius. The second ring press 358 is then moved in the direction<br>
shown by the arrow SS in FIG. 41, such that the contacting edge 368 of the second ring<br><br><br>
press 358 contacts and presses the second film 348 onto the working surface 314 of the<br>
platen 294 and into contact with the uncovered portion of the partially enrobed core 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 42, the heated second film 248 is then pulled onto the<br>
core 10 by the vacuum that is applied by the second vacuum source 302 (see FIG. 31),<br>
in the aforesaid range of about 0.005 Torr to about 700 Torr, to the platen 294, thereby<br>
conforming the second film 248 to the shape of the uncovered portion of the core 10.<br>
Thereafter, the second ring press 358 is moved away from the platen 294, in the<br>
direction shown by the arrow TT in FIG. 42, while the heated second film 248 is held<br>
onto the core by the aforesaid vacuum applied by the second vacuum source 302.<br>
With continued reference to FIG. 42, after the second ring press 358 is<br>
retracted, the platen 294, having the enrobed core 10 held in its recess 310 by the<br>
vacuum, is now moved to the sixth station 388 of the vacuum forming apparatus 292<br>
and temporarily stopped there. It is noted that, as shown in FIG. 42, the second film<br>
348 partially overlaps the cut edge of the first film 342 that has already been applied to<br>
the core 10. While the platen 294 and the core 10 are temporarily stationary, cold air, in<br>
the aforesaid range of about -10 degrees Celsius to about 25 degrees Celsius, is now<br>
blown onto the second film 248 and core 10 in the direction shown by the arrows RR in<br>
FIG. 42, thereby cooling and molding the second film 348 into conformity with the core<br>
10.<br>
With reference now to FIG. 43, after sufficient time has passed to cool and<br>
mold the second film 348 onto the core 10, the platen 294 and the enrobed core 10 are<br>
moved a predetermined distance by the second conveyor system 298 to the seventh<br>
station 390 of the vacuum forming apparatus 292 and temporarily halted there such that<br><br><br>
the enrobed core 10 is aligned with the recess 372 and the cutting edge 376 of the<br>
second film cutter 360. As shown in FIG. 43, the second film cutter 360 is moved in the<br>
direction of the arrow UU until the enrobed core 10 is received snugly within the recess<br>
372 and the cutting edge 376 contacts and cuts through the second film 248 closely<br>
around the perimeter of the enrobed core 10. The second film cutter 360 is then moved<br>
away from the platen 294 in a direction opposite the direction indicated by the arrow UU<br>
in FIG. 43.<br>
As shown in FIG. 44, scrap portions 400, 402 of the second film 344 are<br>
removed from the platen 294. The paten 294 and fully enrobed core 10 are moved by<br>
the second conveyer system 298 away from the seventh station 390. After the platen<br>
294 and enrobed core 10 are past the seventh station 390, the vacuum being applied to<br>
the platen 294 is ceased, thereby releasing the enrobed caplet product, or gelcap 404<br>
from the recess 310.<br>
As shown in FIG. 44, the resulting gelcaps 404 have film coatings that<br>
conform tightly and snugly to the cores 10. It is noted that, in order to form a tamper-<br>
proof seal between the first and second films 342, 348 and the core 10, an adhesive,<br>
such as a liquid form of the stock material, can be applied to the surfaces 406, 408 (see,<br>
e.g., FIGS. 36 and 41) of each of the first and second films 342, 348 that will contact the<br>
caplet 10. In addition, like the gelcaps 122, 214, 286 produced by the first, second and<br>
third embodiments of the present invention, the gelcaps 404 produced by the vacuum<br>
forming apparatus 292 and method of the fourth embodiment are bi-colored, or have at<br>
least two visually distinct regions, having a film seam 410 between the film coatings that<br>
lies substantially in the transverse plane of symmetry 16 of the core 10, and a color<br><br><br>
transition 412 between the colors, or other visually distinct regions, that lies substantially<br>
in the conjugate plane of symmetry 18 of the core 10. In addition, the color transition<br>
412 of the gelcap 404 may be flush and seamless, i.e., without any raised portion which<br>
generally characterizes the film seam 410. In addition, the foregoing process results in<br>
gelcap products 404 having a film coating of uniform color quality and thickness over<br>
their entire surface. If aesthetically desired, the first and second films 342, 348 may be<br>
applied to the core 10 such that the resulting gelcaps 404 have a film seam 410 wherein<br>
a stripe of one color or visual distinction (for example, a red stripe) of one film 342 abuts<br>
or overlaps a stripe of another color or visual distinction (for example, a yellow stripe) of<br>
the other film 348 to form a gelcap 404 having a "checkerboard pattern" (not shown),<br>
i.e., having four quadrants of alternating red and yellow colors or other visual<br>
distinctions.<br>
Although not shown in figures, an alternative to the apparatus and method<br>
of the fourth embodiment will now be described. The alternative apparatus would<br>
include platens having recesses that are each be circumscribed by a raised cutting<br>
ridge capable of cleanly cutting the first and second films 342, 348. In a further<br>
alternative method that may be practiced with the aforesaid apparatus, instead of first<br>
placing the caplet 10 into the recess 310 of the first platen 294, the first film 342 would<br>
be laid across a first platen and then warm air would be blown onto the first film 342 to<br>
soften it to a formable state. Then, a vacuum would be applied through the platen to<br>
pull the first film 342 into the recess and conform it thereto. Thereafter, the core 10<br>
would be placed into the recess 310 and cool air blown onto the platen 294, first film<br>
342 and core, to mold the first film 342 into conformity with the core 10. The second<br><br><br>
film 348 would then be placed onto the platen, on top of the core 10, and warm air<br>
blown onto the second film 348 to soften it to a formable state. Another platen (not<br>
shown) would then be moved into contact with the second film 348, pressing the second<br>
film 348 against the core 10 and the first platen 294, thereby, conforming the second<br>
film 348 to the contour of the caplet 10. Cool air is then blown onto the second film 348,<br>
thereby molding the second film 348 onto the caplet 10. It is noted that the hot and cold<br>
air temperature ranges, as well as the vacuum pressure range, are the same as<br>
previously stated hereinabove in connection with the description of the fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention Lastly, the raised cutting edges of the recesses<br>
cut through both of the first and second films 342, 348, thereby releasing enrobed<br>
gelcap products each of which have a film seam that is transverse to the color transition<br>
(or visual distinction transition) of the gelcaps.<br>
