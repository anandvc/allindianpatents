S-TRIAZOLYL a-MERCAPTOACETANILIDES AS INHIBITORS OF HIV REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority of US provisional applications 60/604,219, filed August 25, 2004, 60/6045220, filed August 25, 2004, and 60/686,351, filed May 31, 2005, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The field of the invention is enzyme inhibitors and the use of enzyme inhibitors for treatment of disease. More particularly, the invention deals with the in vitro and in vivo inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase as a method of treating HIV infection.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Numerous treatments for HIV are known in the art, and among other pharmaceutical^ active compounds, reverse transcriptase inhibitors have provided significant therapeutic effect to many HIV infected patients. For example, lamivudine (3TC) or zidovudine (AZT) are relatively well tolerated antiretroviral drugs. However, numerous viral strains have recently emerged with marked resistance against these compounds. To overcome resistance to at least some degree, new nucleoside-type inhibitors may be administered (alone or in combination with other nucleoside-type inhibitors), and exemplary alternative drugs include stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddl), Combivir™ (brand for a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine), and Trizivir™ (brand for a combination of 3TC, AZT, and abacavir).<br>
Unfortunately, development of resistance to one nucleoside-type inhibitor is often accompanied by the development of a degree of resistance to another nucleoside-type inhibitor, frequently necessitating a switch to a different class of drug.   In such cases, a patient may receive a protease inhibitor (e.g., saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, etc.), typically in combination with other anti retroviral agents. However, the relatively<br><br>
complex administration regimen of such combinations often proves an organizational and financial challenge to many patients, and compliance is frequently less than desirable.<br>
More recently, HIV treatment has focused on combination therapies that involve the administration of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with protease inhibitors and with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and triple combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Unfortunately, combination therapies of protease inhibitors with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are often poorly tolerated and frequently lead to premature termination of the therapy. Therefore, most current combination treatments include a. combination of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
Non-nucleoside-type inhibitors {e.g., nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz) are a structurally inhomogeneous group of compounds that are thought to bind in a non-nucleoside pocket of the reverse transcriptases. They significantly increase antiviral efficacy when co-administered with nucleoside-type inhibitors. While the non-nucleoside-type inhibitors seem to provide a promising new class of antiviral drugs, several disadvantages still remain. The cost of currently-known non-nucleoside-type inhibitors is relatively high, and a single mutation in the viral reverse transcriptases can induce a cross resistance against a wide class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Therefore, there is an urgent to provide new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that have potent antiviral effects, particularly against HIV mutant strains that exhibit resistance against currently-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
The HIV virus has a relatively high frequency of mutation,, which often leads to drug resistance to current treatments. Studies have been carried out to identify the mutation spectrum in the RT proteins of viruses isolated from patients who had failed therapies involving at least one NNRTI, and the results showed that the mutant K103N was the most predominant for patients taking efavirenz, while Y181C was predominant for patients taking nevirapine. Other single mutations included K101E, G190S/A/E and Y188L/C. Some of the most prevalent double mutations in patients failing efavirenz include K103N-P225H, K103N-V108I, K103N-K101Q, K103N-L100I, K103N-F227L,<br><br>
V106I-Y188L, K103N-Y188L and K103N-G190A. There is a need to provide new compositions and methods for the inhibition of these and other mutant reverse transcriptases.<br>
The present application is related to work previously disclosed in commonly owned applications PCT/US02/26186, filed August 23, 2002, unpublished, and PCT/US03/27433, filed August 22, 2003, which was published as WO 2004/030611 on April 15, 2004.

Synthesis of compounds<br>
Synthesis of the compounds of the invention may be performed following procedures substantially as described in WO 2004/030611, WO 2004/050643, and US 5,939,462. It should be recognized, however, that numerous alternative synthetic routes for the compounds of the invention are possible. The following exemplary routes are provided by way of example, for the guidance of practitioners skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry.<br><br>
In one synthetic route, a suitably substituted aniline is amidated with an activated carboxylic acid compound (preferably a carbonyl halide). wherein the activated carboxylic acid compound further includes a leaving group L2 (preferably bromine). After formation of the anilide, the reaction product is reacted with a mercaptotriazole (Het-SH), displacing the leaving group to form the desired compound as depicted in Scheme la below.<br><br>
This scheme is advantageous where the mercaptotriazole "Het-SH" is valuable relative to the aniline, since the triazole is not used until the last step and is not subjected to the inevitable losses that occur during the synthetic manipulation of intermediates. The choice of leaving groups L and L will depend to some extent on the particular choice of amine and to a lesser degree on the particular mercaptotriazole. It is particularly preferred that L and L are halide, most preferably chloride or bromide. Suitable solvents for the amidation reaction include ethers, alcohols, and hydrocarbons (preferably halogenated) and the choice of suitable solvents will at least in part depend on the chemical nature of the reactants. With respect to the solvents, catalysts and/or bases employed in the above reaction, the considerations described by Connell et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5.939,462) will generally apply.<br>
An alternative general strategy is shown in Scheme lb below. This approach involves the acylation of anilines with S-triazoly mercaptoacetic acids, which are readily prepared by alkylation of mercaptotriazoles with an a-haloacetic acid or ester.<br><br><br>
Suitable reagents include but are not limited to iodoacetic acid and methyl bromoacetate, and ethyl a-bromopropionate when it is desired that R3 be methyl. If an ester is used, it is hydrolyzed after the S-alkylation to provide a free carboxylic acid. The acid and the aniline may be coupled with any of the usual carboxyl activating reagents or reagent mixtures, for example a carbodiimide in the presence of a tertiary amine base, optionally withN-hydroxybenzotriazole as catalyst, or thionyl or oxalyl chloride, with dimethylaminopyridine as catalyst. This scheme is advantageous when the aniline is valuable relative to the triazole.<br>
An example of Scheme la is the synthesis outlined in Scheme 2, in which a compound of the invention is prepared from Wo separately-prepared precursors. The first precursor? comprising a substituted triazine, and the second precursor, comprising a substituted aniline, may be prepared following the protocols given below in the section entitled "Examples".   Reaction of the precursors is typically carried out in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMF, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Where compounds of the invention are administered as part of a pharmacological composition, it is contemplated that suitable compounds can be formulated in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, and other additives. It is particularly preferred that the compounds of the .invention are included in a pharmaceutical composition that is formulated with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection, or for rectal administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectaily, parenteral^ intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically, bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. The term "parenteral" administration as used herein refers to modes of administration which include but are not limited to intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intra-articular injection and infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection preferably comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents and vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
Compositions may also contain additives such as preservatives, wetting agents, . emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br><br>
In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the invention, it may be desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally- administered compound of the invention may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming unitary or microparticulate matrices of a compound of the invention in biodegradable polymers, including but not limited to polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters), and poly (anhydrides. The rate of drug release can be controlled by varying the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed. Depot injectable formulations may also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include but are not limited to capsules, tablets, pills, powders, dragees, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or (a) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, (b) binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia, (c) humectants, such as glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, (e) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin, (f) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds, (g) wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate. (h) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and (i) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. Solid dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical<br><br>
formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally in a delayed manner. The active compounds may also be in micro-encapsulated form<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutical^ acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol. isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate. propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and ferry acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Oral liquid compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, coloring, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or other suppository waxes which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are typically formed from mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable lipid capable of forming liposomes may be used. Compositions in liposome form may contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, membrane stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XTV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. By "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is meant those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.

Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition, and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the dosing schedule/the severity of the condition being treated, and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. Dose-ranging studies are routine, and it is within the ability of those skilled in the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. Generally, dosage levels of about 0.1 to about 100, more preferably about 5 to about 50 mg of an active compound per kilogram of body weight per day are administered orally to a mammalian patient. If desired, the effective daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration, e.g., two to four separate doses per day.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other agents for the treatment of HIV. Particularly contemplated additional compounds include nucleoside-type reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., lamivudine, zidovudine, stavudine, abacavir, tenofovir or didanosine ), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir), fusion inhibitors (e.g., enfuvirtide), CCR5 antagonists, immunotherapeutic agents (e.g.. ribavirin, IL-2), and active, passive, and/or therapeutic vaccines. Combination therapies according to the present invention comprise the administration of at least one compound of the present invention or a functional derivative thereof and at least one other pharmaceutically active ingredient. The active ingredient(s) and pharmaceutically active agents may be administered separately or together and when administered separately this may occur simultaneously or separately in any order. The amounts of the active ingredient(s) and pharmaceutically active agent(s)<br><br>

Inhibition of HTV-1 Reverse Transcriptase<br>
Compounds were screened for inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using a high throughput cell-based assay using HIV-1 expressing firefly luciferase as a reporter gene and pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G). Experimental procedures were essentially as described by Connor et al. in Journal of Virology (1996), 70: 5306-5311 (Characterization of the functional properties of ertv genes from long-term survivors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection), and Popik et al. in Journal of Virology (2002), 76: 4709-4722 (Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 uses lipid raft&gt;colocalized CD4 and chemokine receptors for productive entry into CD4+ T cells). It should be particularly appreciated that the virus contains two introduced mutations in the RT gene (K103N and Yl 81C, created by<br><br>
PCR mutagenesis) that render the virus highly resistant to current non-nucleoside HIV-1 drugs. Virus stocks were generated by cotransfection of plasmid DNA encoding VSV-G with vector pNL4-3Env(-)Luc(+) into 293T cells. Sixty-four hours after transfection, virus-containing medium was collected by centrifagation and stored frozen at -80° C.<br>
HeLa cells were infected with the VSV-G pseudotyped virus in the presence of screening compounds in a 384-well microtiter plate format. Forty-eight hours after initial infection, lysis buffer and Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) was added TO the cells and luciferase activity was determined by counting the resultant luminescence using a LJL luminometer. Since the luciferase gene is carried in the virus genome, its expression level directly reflects the virus replication level in the presence of a compound.<br>
To evaluate the activity of the compounds against wild type HTV-1, a HeLa-JC53 cell line that expresses high levels of CD4 and CCR5 was employed (Piatt et al., Journal of Virology (1998), 72: 2855-2864: Effect of CCR5 and CD4 cell surface concentrations on infection by macrophagetropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1). The cell line was modified by isolation of a stable cell line that expresses luciferase under the control of the HTV-1 promoter (long terminal repeat, i.e., LTR). HTV-1 infection of this cell line stimulates the transcription of luciferase from the HIV-1 promoter and the luciferase gene expression level is proportional to the level of virus replication (Harrington et al. in Journal of Virology Methods (2000), 88: 111-115: Direct detection of infection of HTV-1 in blood using a centrifugation-indicator cell assay; and Roos et al. in Virology (2000), 273: 307-315: LuSTV cells: a reporter cell line for the detection and quantitation of a single cycle of HTV and STV replication). Procedures for virus infection, compound testing and luciferase activity determination were the same as for the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1.<br>
Two approaches were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the positive compounds discovered in the HIV-1 virus assays. The first approach employed another modified HeLa-JC53 cell line that constitutively expresses high level of luciferase without virus infection. The level of luciferase expression in these cells served as an indicator for cell replication in the presence of the compounds. Procedures for compound testing and luciferase activity determination were the same as for the virus infection tests. The other<br><br>
toxicity assay utilized HeLe-JC53 cells and a commercially available MTS assay kit (Promega) that measures the mitochondria function of the cells.<br>
Using similar methods as described above, 2-[5-bromo-4-(4-cyclopropylnaphthalen-l-yl)-4H-[L254]triazol-3-ylsulfanyl]-N-(2-meihyl-4-sulfamoylphenyl)acetamide and2-[5-bromo-4-(4-ethylnaphthalen-l-yi)-4H-[1,2343triazol-3-ylsulfanyl]-N-(2-cUoro-4-sulfamoylphenyl)-acetarnide were synthesized. as were the N-4-carbamyl analog, 2-[5-bromo-4~(4-ethyl-naphthalen-l-y])-4H-[l,2J4]triazol-3-ylsulfanyl]-N-(2-chloro-4-carbamoylphenyl)-acetamide and the N-4-carboxyl analog. Each of the compounds was tested against a panel of mutant HIV reverse transcriptases, including 20 of the 22 of the mutants that are found in about 2% or more of the patient samples that are resistant to the most widely used non-nucleoside HTV-RT inhibitor efavirenz ((4S)-6-chloro-4-(cyclopropyletiiyTiyl}-l)4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,l~benzoxazin-2-one). For each of the 20 high-prevalence mutants tested, at least one of these compounds was more than 20 fold more potent than efavirenz or showed EC50 of less than 1 nM. In most cases both criteria were met. In the majority of cases all three compounds were more potent than efavirenz. Compounds were compared for activity on wild type, Y181C and Y188L mutant reverse transcriptases. Both amides were significantly superior to the carboxylic acid on all three enzymes.<br>
Results<br>
