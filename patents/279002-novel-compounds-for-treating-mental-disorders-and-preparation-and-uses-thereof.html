				<td>NOVEL COMPOUNDS FOR TREATING MENTAL DISORDERS.<br>
AND PREPARATION AND USES THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a compound of formula (I) and salts thereof,<br>
a process for preparing the same, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
same, and their use for the treatment or auxiliary treatment of mental disorders.<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been reported that the compound [formula (II)]<br>
[3-{2-[4-(6-fluoro-benzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-<br>
6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one; or IUPAC name:<br>
3-[2-[4-(6-fluorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-7-hydroxy-4-methyl-1,5-<br>
diazabicyclo[4.4.0]deca-3,5-dien-2-one; CAS Nr. 144598-75-4; MW 426.48;<br>
Paliperidone or 9-OH risperidone or 9-hydroxy risperidone] is a benzoisoxazole<br>
derivative and one of new generation antipsychotics. The compound [formula (II)]<br>
is a selective monoaminergic antagonist having unique properties, and has a high<br>
affinity to serotoninergic 5-HT2 receptor and dopamine D2 receptor. The<br>
compound [formula (II)] can also binds to a1-adrenergic receptor, and binds to<br>
histaminergic H1 receptor and a2-adrenoceptor with a relatively low affinity. The<br>
compound [formula (II)] does not bind to a cholinergic receptor. The compound<br>
[formula (II)] is a potent D2 antagonist and can improve positive symptoms of<br>
schizophrenia, but it may cause less motor function inhibition and catalepsy than<br>
classic antipsychotics. Its balanced antagonistic effects on serotonin and<br>
dopamine of central nervous system may reduce the posibility of occurence of<br>
extrapyramidal side effects, and its therapeutic effects may be extended to<br>
negative symptoms and emotional symptoms of schizophrenia.<br>
The compound [formula (II)] is a new generation of psychotropic relative to<br>
Risperidone. U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of an<br>
oral sustained release formulation of the compound [formula (II)] (Invega)<br>
developed by JANSSEN Pharmaceuticals, Inc in December 2006 for the<br>
treatment of mental disorders. Since the hydroxyl group of the compound results<br>
in an increased hydrophilicity, the absorption rate via oral administration is<br>
reduced, and the absolute bioavailability of the compound is only 28%, which is<br>
far lower than that of Risperidone (at least 70%), so that the daily dosage of the<br>
compound increased significantly, which in turn lead to increase in the pre-system<br>
side effects of the possible unabsorbed drug. The long-chain fatty acid ester of<br>
the compound [formula (II)] was reported in W099/25354, but it is metabolized<br>
very slowly to form the compound [formula (II)] in vivo and cannot rapidly achieve<br>
the effective therapeutic effects. In order to overcome the above drawbacks<br>
associated with the compound [formula (II)] and fatty acid esters thereof, a series<br>
of derivatives of the compound [formula (II)] (the compounds of formula (I)) were<br>
synthesized, used as prodrugs of the compound [formula (II)] and reduced by<br>
rapid metabolism in vivo to form the compound [formula (II)] upon being taken,<br>
thereby achieving therapeutic effects.<br>
<br>
CONTENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to develop a new compound, which is a<br>
prodrug for the treatment of mental disorders. The below compounds of formula (I)<br>
obtained thus by the inventors have an advantage of being rapidly metabolized in<br>
vivo to form the compound [formula (II)], thereby having an increased<br>
bioavailability and reduced pre-system side effects caused by the possible<br>
unabsorbed drug, facilitating the regulation of dosage and therapeutic effects,<br>
reducing side effects and the risk of interaction with other drugs.<br>
The present invention relates to a compound represented by formula (I), an<br>
optical isomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which is a prodrug<br>
for the treatment of mental disorders,<br>

being construded to restrict the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
A. Synthesis of the compound [formula (II)]<br>
1. Preparation of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-9-benzyloxy-6,7,8,9-<br>
tetrahydropyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one<br>
Toluene 1500ml, 2-amino-3-benzyloxy-pyridine 120g (0.65mole), 2-acetyl<br>
Y-butyrolactone 114ml (1.05mole) were added to a reaction bottle, and<br>
phosphorus oxychloride 300ml (3.21 mole) was added dropwise. The reaction was<br>
conducted at 90-93°C for 5 hours. The soluvent was distilled out at a reduced<br>
pressure, the residue was poured into brash ice, adjusted to a pH 9 with 25%<br>
ammonia, extracted with chloroform for three times (100ml per time), washed with<br>
water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was distilled out at a<br>
reduced pressure, the residue while hot was dissolved in 100ml isopropanol, and<br>
stood overnight. The precipitated crystal was filtered out, washed with<br>
isopropanol, and dried to obtain 65.0g of light pink crystal (yield 31%). Mp:<br>
139.9-140.9°C.<br>
2. Preparation of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-9-hydroxy-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-<br>
pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one<br>
At room temperature, 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-9-benzyloxy-6,7,8,9-<br>
tetrahydro-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one 4.0g (0.0122mole) was charged into a<br>
250 mL three-necked bottle, 80 mL methanol was added, and then concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid (about 25 drops) was added dropwise with stirring to adjust pH<br>
to 3.0. After the dissolution was completed, 1.8g of wet 5% Pd-C (water content:<br>
56%) (W/W: 10/1) was added, argon gas was fed to exchange atmosphere for<br>
three times, hydrogen gas was fed to exchange atmosphere for three times, the<br>
reaction was conducted at 27°C for about 36 hours, and TLC (ethyl ether :<br>
n-hexane : methanol : triethylamine = 2mL : 0.5mL : 6 drops : 6 drops) was used<br>
to detect the debenzylated product. The reaction was stopped after all starting<br>
materials were consumed.<br>
A light green liquid was obtained by sucking filtration, and distilled at a<br>
reduced pressure to remove solvent to obtain a dark green viscous liquid. About<br>
16mL distilled water was added, dissolution was conducted under ultrasound, the<br>
temperature was decreased to 5°C by using an icewater bath, and the pH was<br>
adjusted to 10-11 by adding 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide so as to precipitate a<br>
large amount of white solid when the pH was close to its end. The white solid was<br>
filtered out at a reduced pressure. The filtrate was extracted with 2x20mL of<br>
dichloromethane. The organic layers were combined and washed with saturated<br>
aqueous NaCI solution for twice (10mL per time), dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate. Light yellow solids were obtained after the solvent was<br>
distilled out. The resulting solids were combined and dried to obain 2.14g product<br>
(yield: 72.6%). Mp: 100.8-102.7°C.<br>

To 10ml anhydrous dichloromethane and 1ml anhydrous pyridine, 2.0g<br>
(4.69mmol) of the compound [formula (II)] was added, dissolved under stirring at<br>
room temperature, then 1.91g (9.38mmol) p-nitrophenyl chloroformate was added<br>
dropwise, and reacted until starting materials spots disappeared on TLC. The<br>
reaction was extracted with dichloromethane for three times (15ml per time). The<br>
extracts were washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and<br>
distilled at a reduced pressure to remove solvent. The residue was dissoved in<br>
2ml anhydrous ethanol, then 3ml of anhydrous ethanol-HCI saturated solution<br>
was added dropwise. After standing overnight, the precipitated solid was filtered<br>
out, washed with ethyl acetate, and dried to obtain 1.69g of 3-{2-[4-(6-fluoro-<br>

Example 3: Tests of the compounds being metabolized to form the active<br>
component, 3-{2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzoisoxazol-3-yl)-1 -piperidinyl]ethyl}-9-<br>
hydroxy-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one, (the<br>
compound [formula (II)]) in liver cells<br>
40 µg of the Compound 1 of Example 1 (or Compound 2 or Compound 3 or<br>
Compound 5 or Compound 6 or Compound 7 or Compound 8 or Compound 9)<br>
was dissolved in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (containing 1mM<br>
NADPH), mixed with 25 uL of human liver cells S9 (20mg protein/mL, H961),<br>
cultured at 37°C for 2 hours, and then the mixture was quenched with<br>
concentrated perchloric acid. After the precipitated proteins were removed by<br>
centrifugation, the obtained supernatant solution was adjusted to pH of 3 with<br>
concentrated potassium phosphate solution, and centrifuged again. The obtained<br>
supernatant was directly injected into HPLC for analysis.<br>
The metabolism results were shown in Table 1. The metabolic rates of the<br>
compounds being metabolized in liver cells for 2 hours to form the active<br>
component 3-{2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzoisoxazol-3-yl)-1 -piperidinyl]ethyl}-9-<br>
hydroxy-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (the compound<br>
[formula (II)]) ranged from 70% to 95%, depending on the different ester groups.<br>
<br>
Example 4: Measurement of the absolute bioavailability - Beagle tests of<br>
the compound [formula (II)] and its prodrugs, the compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8<br>
Twenty one beagles weighing about 10kg were divided into 7 groups, and<br>
intragastrically administered the compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 at a dosage of<br>
9.4 µmol/beagle, respectively. Blood samples were taken at the predetermined<br>
time points, and the concentrations of the active metabolite (the compound<br>
[formula (II)]) and prodrugs in blood were measured. In the meantime, three<br>
beagles weighing about 10kg were intravenously administered with the<br>
compound [formula (II)] at a dosage equimolar to the prodrug, as the control<br>
group, and the concentrations of the compound [formula (II)] in blood were<br>
measured.<br>
The results were shown in Fig.1 and Table 2. The prodrugs were immediately<br>
metabolized almost completely to form the active metabolite in beagle body, the<br>
compound [formula (II)] upon being administrated parenterally, and the<br>
concentrations of the original compounds were very low (see: Fig.lC). The results<br>
also indicateed that the bioavailability of the prodrugs of the compound [formula<br>
(II)] were significantly higher than that of Invega (28%). Particularity, the prodrugs<br>
of carbonate type had a very remarkable improvement of bioavailability.<br>
