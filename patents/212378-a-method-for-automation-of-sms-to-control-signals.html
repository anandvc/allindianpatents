FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention in general relates to the filed of mobile communication devices. Further this invention relates to short messaging services in mobile communication devices. More particularly this invention relates to a method for automation of SMS to control signals.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In the present scenario, the user receives messages, data, fax and voice calls on his mobile communication device. Such calls are almost always manually answered by the user.<br>
The other option presently available to the user is to record and keep available a standard voice response and divert incoming calls to a voice mail box where the caller hears the said standard voice response.<br>
Therefore, in the present scenario, all calls are manually answered by the user or in the alternative the voice mail service communicates the same message irrespective of the caller.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
As explained above, the present system necessitates the manual answering of calls by the user himself and the only other alternative is the voice mail service.<br>
In the voice mail service, the user is not permitted to set different messages for different callers and is forced to make the same message available for all callers.<br><br>
Also the existing system will not provide a mechanism to convey a pre-composed or user defined message automatically since no trigger mechanism based on the calls received and the profiles of the callers is available at the option of the user.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method for automation of SMS to control signals, which is novel and unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method where devices will give user more flexibility with pre-defined or composed SMS automation triggers.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method wherein a user can trigger a common message or specific current status to intended users.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes a method for automating the messages delivery to specific network control signals. In the present invention, the mobile devices can send the current user status (Meeting, Drive mode, Busy, Switched Off) to specific users. Also the invention provides for the user to compose specific messages which are to be triggered on some control signals.<br>
The invention describes a method for automation of SMS to control signals wherein the said method comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	sending the current user status to specific users by the mobile devices;<br>
(b)	providing   the user with the facility to compose specific messages which are to be triggered on control signals;<br>
(c)	triggering a common message or specific current status to intended users; and<br><br>
(d) generating a log in the device once the automated SMS is triggered.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention and claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 shows the Dataflow for Automated SMS response.<br>
Figure 2 shows the Flow Chart for design implementation.<br>
Figure 3 shows the Automated SMS response to incoming voice calls,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art on how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
In the present invention, the term 'Control Signals' means either Voice call paging or SMS notification. This invention can be applied to any device, which supports basic SMS MO feature.<br><br>
Once the automated SMS is triggered, a log is generated in the device and is updated from time to time.<br>
The automated triggered SMS feature is a non-guaranteed feature as SMS is not a guaranteed delivery service. This idea can be a Value Added Feature in any device which supports basic SMS message capabilities.<br>
When the user is in different profile modes, the user can respond to some Voice calls or SMS messages using automated triggered SMS feature.<br>
Automation can be enabled to be able to trigger to some specific intended users since user has to pay for SMS and this is more advantageous to the user where free SMS subscription is given by some carriers.<br>
The mobile service providers can also make use of this feature to unload the network due to IVR Voice calls. Network can send User status using automated triggered SMS feature to respond with Terminating End user status.<br>
Automated triggered SMS feature makes devices more intelligent and gives the user more flexibility in different profile modes.<br>
1.	The existing auto-email response does not provide any alternative mechanism to response to the incoming control signals on the already existing mode communication. Using this automated SMS mechanism, we can use an alternate and effective way to communicate if user wants to automate the process of responding to voice calls, SMS or data calls.<br>
2.	Actually we can extend the scope of this feature to be implemented in all the mobile devices to use alternate path to automatically respond to the incoming messages or control signals.<br>
3.	This also gives a mechanism for the use not to establish traffic channel for longer time, which in turn gives networks to offload some of the network load due<br><br>
to unsuccessful voice mail recording process. This is not present in legacy automated email response systems.<br>
4.	Automated SMS response feature also provides customized and give a mechanism to respond to intended recipients.<br>
5.	Network also makes use of this automates SMS response to make subsystems more intelligent and deploy valued added services.<br>
IMPLEMENTATION SCHEME AND METHODOLOGY<br>
The figure 1 shows all the Mobile devices involved in realizing the SMS Automation to Control signals feature. Following are the different modules which are involved in SMS automation feature.<br>
1.	Call Control Module (CC)<br>
2.	SMS Module (SMS)<br>
3.	Ul Module (Ul)<br>
4.	Automation Log Module (AL)<br>
Different control signals are triggered from underlying network protocol stack(L1, L2 and L3 Layers ) to notify the incoming SMS, Voice, Data or Media Call. Call control(CC) module received the incoming trigger and process the message accordingly, If Incoming control message is a voice call or Data or Media Call, then Call Control(CC) module will process the message and notify to User Interface Module(UI) for the end user to respond. If Incoming message is a incoming message SMS/EMS/MMS then it will be routed through the SMS module for processing to retrieve the actual message transmitted. If User enabled the SMS Automation feature to specific incoming number or all incoming messages, then Call Control(CC) will not intimate the notification to the user for appropriate action, instead Call Control(CC) module will process the incoming messages and responds to them automatically using the pre-composed or stored message to incoming control signals. To achieve this functionality. Call Control(CC) will intimate SMS module to process the automated the SMS message to the corresponding incoming control messages. After transmission of the automated<br><br>
SMS message, SMS module(SMS) will log the SMS transmission details with status(either successful or failed) in the Automation Logging Module(AL) for the end user reference.<br>
The Figure 2 shows Data Flow chart for SMS automation feature functionality in mobile devices. Following the detailed description of the flow chart which can be taken as input while designing and implementing the SMS automations feature in mobile devices.<br>
The Incoming controls signals for Voice Call/SMS/EMS/MMS/Data Call/Fax CallA/ideo Call will be notified with respective control singes from underlying protocol stack. For simplicity, we will describe the flow chart diagram in the context of Voice call. Whenever there is an incoming voice call, mobile device will receive the notification through the control signal messages AWIM/SETUP Messages in CDMA and GSM networks respectively. The Incoming Control Message is given as input the Call Control(CC) module. The CC module will process and decides whether the Incoming message is a Voice Call Voice Call/SMS/EMS/MMS/Data Call/Fax CallA/ideo Call. If Incoming message is a Voice call, then Call Manager will retrieve the incoming number and will check to see if any automated SMS triggers are enabled for this incoming message. If decision block output is "Yes" then Call Control Module(CC) will notify the SMS Module(SMS) to process the Automated SMS to the incoming control message. In this case, Call Control Module(CC) will not notify the User Interface module for any Manual interactions to handle this incoming call. If decision block output is "NO" then incoming Call will be handled normally i.e there are no automated SMS triggers are enabled for this incoming message. SMS module(SMS) will take "Caller Number" as input and process the MO SMS. If the SMS MO transmission is successful then SMS Module(SMS) will notify the Automated Logging Module(AL) to record the transmitted SMS message details for user reference. If the SMS MO transmission is unsuccessful then SMS Module(SMS) will schedule the SMS MO message for retransmission based on the user settings.<br><br>
The figure 3 shows the message exchange sequence between the mobile device and the network when Automated SMS feature is enabled in the mobile device. Again for simplicity, we explain the scenario in the incoming voice call scenario. The same functional logic will be applicable to the other incoming SMS/EMS/MMS/Data Call/Fax CallA/ideo Call. When Network sends the Paging Message to inform the mobile device about the incoming voice call. Mobile device will respond back to the paging message with the Page Response message. Network will send the control signal messages AWIM/SETUP Messages in CDMA and GSM networks respectively. Mobile device will retrieve the incoming caller number at this stage, Call Control Manager will check to see if there any automated SMS messages are enabled for this incoming call, if enabled, then Call Control Module(CC) will communicate to the SMS module(SMS) to initiate the automated SMS MO message to the incoming voice call. In this scenario, User will not be notified about the incoming voice call as it is done in conventional incoming call notification. If there are no automated SMS trigger is not enabled for the incoming voice call, incoming voice call will be handled in a conventional way for user interaction. SMS Module(SMS) will initiate a pre-composed or common SMS message to the incoming voice call or control signals. Once automated SMS MO is transmitted from the mobile device, it will follow the conventional method of SMS transmission through the   provider SMS canter. The Called party will be notified with the pre-composed or common message. Based on different underlying network technology, we may need to modify the Call Control Module(CC) and SMS module(SMS) accordingly to customize this automation SMS feature for realization on different wireless networks.<br>
The Mobile device software needs modifications to incorporate the proposed SMS automation functionality in mobile devices. The modifications are mainly mobile device software modules such as the 1) Call Control Module (CC) 2) SMS module and 3) Ul Module (Ul). A new logging module (AL) need to integration to convey the automated messaged delivered for user references and take appropriate actions if some automated trigger messages failed in some due some network<br><br>
problems. If implemented in network framework, respective network elements software needs to be modified or an independent element can be added to implement this automation feature.<br>
The following are the software modules will be impacted to enable or implement the SMS automation feature.<br>
1.	Call Control Module (CC)<br>
2.	SMS Module (SMS)<br>
3.	Ul Module (Ul)<br>
New module needs to be incorporated to have the logging mechanism for each of the automated SMS sent and user can track the same for reference.<br>
1. Automation Log Module (AL)<br>
This implementation needs to be customized based on the underlying wireless network technology used, like the feature working in CDMA has to be adapted if mobile devices supports other wireless technologies like GSM/GPRS, EVDO, UMTS, etc.<br>
Except the call control modules and SMS, other modules are independent of underlying network bearer services.<br>
To realize this feature in mobile devices, implementation is given w. r. t. CDMA and GSM networks.<br>
Following are the procedures need to be followed to implement this feature.<br>
User will be provided with an option in the mobile device menu through which user would be able to enable this automation feature by putting it into "ON" or "OFF" state. - This user selected option could be stored in mobile device Non-volatile memory.<br><br>
Once User enables this SMS Automation to "ON" state, user will be provided with the options to compose new message or user can select from preloaded messages. User experience with SMS application is same here except that numbers enter will be matched with the incoming call or SMS number to deliver the pre-composed message.<br>
Entire existing SMS module can be reused with minor interface changes to communicate with the Automation Logging (AL) Module In SMS module, once we receive the acknowledgement for successful transmission of SMS message over the network. The Automatic Logging API need to be called in existing SMS status update procedure calls. The Automatic Logging API will log the information with fields such as the SMS 'sent to' field, Time stamp' and 'status of the message'. The logged information will be presented to the user for reference. This will tell whether the automated triggered SMS is successful or not. The automation Logging module will collect all the SMS triggered details and will display to the user with above mentioned fields. Since SMS is not a guaranteed service, if logging feature is enabled, user can take corrective actions if the intended message is not conveyed automatically.<br>
The Underlying protocol layers - L2, L3 will notify the Gail Control module when an incoming call is received by the mobile devices through AWIM message in CDMA or Setup Message in GSM terminology.<br>
Call Control modules receives the call incoming messages (AWIM or Setup) through call notification events from underlying modules, Call control module will be modified to make decision based on SMS Automation settings.<br>
If Automation is ON, then once CC module retrieves the Caller number, CC will compare with the existing numbers for which the SMS automation feature is enabled. If there is match, then SMS module will notified to process and send the pre-composed SMS already stored in mobile device.<br>
Automated SMS can be triggered in response to incoming call or SMS.<br><br>
Basically we can extend this automation feature to make mobile device respond to some control signals automatically instead of some manual intervention by the user.<br>
When Automated SMS is sent in response to either incoming call or MT SMS, then SMS will notify the Automation Logging module to insert the details of the SMS sent through this feature. This logging mechanism will be useful for user reference.<br>
This automation can be enabled either to some specific incoming number or broadcast a single status message to all the incoming calls and SMS. When single status is enabled to broadcast in response to all incoming call and SMS then Call control module will skip the number matching logic and divert all the incoming call to SMS module based on the user settings.<br>
User will not be disturbed or presented with alerting unless the incoming calling numbers does not exists in automation number list. Here we can extend the scope of automation list to use as a filter for the mobile phone to accept and take the necessary actions. Interesting feature will be to provide all the possible actions possible for user when any particular user calls the mobile device.<br>
Network subsystems can also be enabled with this feature to deliver some carrier customization messages or billing information as soon as network finds the user got registered with network. The scope of the feature is to give some provision to user and network systems to communicate and convey the customized information in better and cost efficient manner.<br>
With this automation feature, we can make mobiles to have an automated assistant in place to respond and handle the calls, SMS, emails when mobile user based on the user profiles.<br><br>
The motivation behind this feature is also to reduce the network load and use the efficient and automated way to convey the pre-composed status to all the incoming control signals to the mobile devices.<br>
