BORON NITMDE/YTTRIA COMPOSITE COMPONENTS<br>
OF SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT<br>
AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to semiconductor processing equipment and a method of improving corrosion resistance of such components.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In the field of semiconductor processing, vacuum processing chambers are generally used for etching and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of materials on substrates by supplying an etching or deposition gas to the vacuum chamber and application of an RF field to the gas to energize the gas into a plasma state. Examples of parallel plate, transformer coupled plasma (TCPâ„¢) which is also called inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) reactors and components thereof are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,340,462; 4,948,458; 5,200,232 and 5,820,723. Because of the corrosive nature of the plasma environment in such reactors and the requirement for minimizing particle and/or heavy metal contamination, it is highly desirable for the components of such equipment to exhibit high corrosion resistance.<br>
During processing of semiconductor substrates, the substrates are typically held in place within the vacuum chamber by substrate holders such as mechanical clamps and electrostatic clamps (ESC). Examples of such clamping systems and components thereof can be found in commonly owned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,262,029 and 5,838,529* Process gas can be supplied to the chamber in various ways such<br><br>
as by gas nozzles, gas rings, gas distribution plates, etc. An example of a temperature controlled gas distribution plate for an inductively coupled plasma reactor and components thereof can be found in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 5,863,376. In addition to the plasma chamber equipment, other equipment used in processing semiconductor substrates include transport mechanisms, gas supply systems, liners, lift mechanisms, load locks, door mechanisms, robotic arms, fasteners, and the like. The components of such equipment are subject to a variety of corrosive conditions associated with semiconductor processing. Further, in view of the high purity requirements for processing semiconductor substrates such as silicon wafers and dielectric materials such as the glass substrates used for flat panel displays, components having improved corrosion resistance are highly desirable in such environments.<br>
Aluminum and aluminum alloys are commonly used for walls, electrodes, substrate supports, fasteners and other components of plasma reactors. In order to prevent corrosion of the such metal components, various techniques have been proposed for coating the aluminum surface with various coatings. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 5,641,375 discloses that aluminum chamber walls have been anodized to reduce plasma erosion and wear of the walls. The '375 patent states that eventually the anodized layer is sputtered or etched off and the chamber must be replaced. U.S. Patent No. 5,895,586 states that a technique for forming an erosion resistant film of A1203, A1C, TiN, TiC, A1N or the like on aluminum material can be found in Japanese Application Laid-Open No. 62-103379.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,680,013 states that a technique for flame spraying A1203 on metal surfaces of an etching chamber is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,491,496. The '013 patent states that the differences in thermal expansion coefficients between aluminum and ceramic coatings such as aluminum oxide leads to cracking of the coatings due to thermal cycling and eventual failure of the coatings in corrosive environments. In order to protect the chamber walls, U.S.<br><br>
Patent Nos. 5,366,585; 5,798,016; and 5,885,356 propose liner arrangements. For instance, the '016 patent discloses a liner of ceramics, aluminum, steel and/oi quartz with aluminum being preferred for its ease of machinability and having a coating of aluminum oxide, SC2O3 or Y203, with A1203 being preferred for coating aluminum to provide protection of the aluminum from plasma. The '585 patent discloses a free standing ceramic liner having a thickness of at least 0.005 inches and machined from solid alumina. The '585 patent also mentions use of ceramic layers which are deposited without consuming the underlying aluminum can be provided by flame sprayed or plasma sprayed aluminum oxide. The '356 patent discloses a ceramic liner of alumina and a ceramic shield of aluminum nitride for the wafer pedestal. U.S. Patent No. 5,885,356 discloses ceramic liner materials for use in CVD chambers.<br>
Various coatings have been proposed for metal components of semiconductor processing equipment. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 5,879,523 discloses a sputtering chamber wherein a thermally sprayed coating of A1203 is applied to a metal such as stainless steel or aluminum with an optional NiAlx bond coating therebetween. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,522,932 and 5,891,53 disclose a rhodium coating for metal components of an apparatus used for plasma processing of substrates with an optional nickel coating therebetween. U.S. Patent No. 5,680,013 discloses non-bonded ceramic protection for metal surfaces in a plasma processing chamber, the preferred ceramic material being sintered A1N with less preferred materials including aluminum oxide, magnesium fluoride, and magnesium oxide. U.S. Patent No. 5,904,778 discloses a SiC CVD coating on free standing SiC for use as a chamber wall, chamber roof, or collar around the wafer.<br>
With regard to plasma reactor components such as showerhead gas distribution systems, various proposals have been made with respect to the materials of the showerheads. For instance, commonly owned U.S. Patent<br><br>
No. 5,569,356 discloses a showerhead of silicon, graphite, or silicon carbide. U.S. Patent No. 5,494,713 discloses forming an alumite film on an aluminum electrode and a silicon coating film such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride over the alumite film. The '713 patent states that the thickness of the silicon coating film should be 10 /xm or less, preferably about 5 /xm, since the aluminum coating film, the alumite coating film and the silicon coating film have different coefficients of linear expansion and cracks are easily generated when the thickness of the silicon coating film is too thick. A thickness below 5 /im, however, is stated to be unfavorable since the protection of the aluminum substrate is insufficient. U.S. Patent No. 4,534,516 discloses an upper showerhead electrode of stainless steel, aluminum, copper or the like. U.S. Patent No. 4,612,077 discloses a showerhead electrode of magnesium. U.S. Patent No. 5,888,907 discloses a showerhead electrode of amorphous carbon, SiC or Al. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,006,220 and 5,022,979 disclose a showerhead electrode either made entirely of SiC or a base of carbon coated, with SiC deposited by CVD to provide a surface layer of highly pure SiC.<br>
In view of the need for high purity and corrosion resistance for components of semiconductor processing equipment, there is a need in the art for improvements in materials and/or coatings used for such components. Moreover, with regard to the chamber materials, any materials which can increase the service life of a plasma reactor chamber and thus reduce the down time of the apparatus, would be beneficial in reducing the cost of processing the semiconductor wafers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the invention a process for providing an erosion resistant boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating on a surface of a semiconductor processing equipment component is provided. The process includes depositing a boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating on a surface of a<br><br>
processing equipment component so as to form an outer erosion resistant surface. By erosion resistant surface, it is meant a surface coating that protects underlying materials from the corrosive effects of plasma chamber gases, while resisting erosion of the coating by the plasma chamber gases.  The underlying surface of the process equipment component to be coated can comprise a metal, ceramic or polymer material with a preferable material being anodized aluminum.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, one or more intermediate metal, ceramic or polymer coatings may be used between the surface of the semiconductor processing equipment and the boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating. Metal surfaces that may be coated include anodized or unanodized aluminum, stainless steel, a refractory metal such as molybdenum or other metal or alloy used in plasma chambers. Ceramic surfaces that may be coated include alumina, SiC, A1N, Si3N4, BC or other plasma compatible ceramic material. Polymeric surfaces that may be coated include fluoropolymers such as TeflonÂ®, polyimides such as VespelÂ®, and other polymeric materials useful in a plasma chamber at temperatures up to 200Â°C.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, a metal component is provided. The component includes: (a) a metal surface; (b) an optional first intermediate coating on the metal surface; (c) an optional second intermediate coating on the first intermediate coating or on the metal surface; and a boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating on said component which provides a corrosion resistant outer surface. Each of the first and second intermediate coatings may be a metal or alloy thereof, ceramic, polymer or mixture or composite of materials used in plasma chamber reactors.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor processing equipment component made of a boron nitride/yttria composite containing material. The component may include any one or more coatings employed in such equipment.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof in connection with the accompanying drawing, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a plasma reactor chamber having a component coated with a corrosion resistant coating in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows details of the corrosion resistant coating in detail A of Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides an effective way to provide corrosion resistance to metal, ceramic and polymer surfaces of components of semiconductor processing apparatus such as parts of a plasma processing reactor chamber by utilizing an erosion resistant coating. Such components include chamber walls, substrate supports, gas distribution systems including showerheads, baffles, rings, nozzles, etc., fasteners, heating elements, plasma screens, liners, transport module components, such as robotic arms, fasteners, inner and outer chamber walls, etc., and the like.<br>
Although the invention is applicable to any type of component having a metal, ceramic or polymer surface, for ease of illustration, the invention will be described in more detail with reference to the apparatus described in U.S. Patent No. 5,820,723 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a vacuum processing reactor chamber 10 that includes a substrate holder 70 providing an electrostatic clamping force to a substrate 60 as well as providing an RF bias to the substrate while it is He backcooled. A focus ring 72 confines plasma in an area above the substrate. A source of energy for<br><br>
maintaining a high density (e.g., 10Il-1012 ions/cm3) plasma in the chamber such as an antenna 40 powered by a suitable RF source to provide a high density plasma is disposed at the top of reactor chamber 10. The chamber includes suitable vacuum pumping apparatus for maintaining the interior 30 of the chamber at a desired pressure (e.g., below 50 mTorr, typically 1-20 mTorr) by evacuating the chamber through the centrally located vacuum port 20 at the bottom of the chamber.<br>
A substantially planar dielectric window 50 of uniform thickness provided between the antenna 40 and the interior of the processing chamber 10 forms the vacuum wall at the top of the processing chamber 10. A gas distribution plate 52 is provided beneath window 20 and includes openings such as circular holes for delivering process gas from a gas supply to the chamber 10. A conical liner 54 extends from the gas distribution plate and surrounds the substrate holder 70.<br>
In operation, a semiconductor substrate such as a silicon wafer 60 is positioned on the substrate holder 70 and is typically held in place by an electrostatic clamp 74 while He backcooling is employed. Process gas is then supplied to the vacuum processing chamber 10 by passing the process gas through a gap between the window 50 and the gas distribution plate 52. Suitable gas distribution plate arrangements (i.e., showerhead) are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,824,605; 6,048,798; and 5,863,376, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. For instance, while the window and gas distribution plate arrangement in Figure 1 are planar and of uniform thickness, non-planar and/or non-uniform thickness geometries can be used for the window and/or gas distribution plate. A high density plasma is ignited in the space between the substrate and the window by supplying suitable RF power to the antenna 40.<br>
Chamber walls 28 such as anodized or unanodized aluminum walls and metal, ceramic or polymer components such as the substrate holder 70, fasteners 56, liners 54, etc., that are exposed to plasma and show signs of corrosion are<br><br>
candidates for coating according to the invention, thus avoiding the need to mask them during operation of the plasma chamber. Examples of metals and/or alloys that may be coated include anodized or unanodized aluminum and alloys thereof, stainless steel, refractory metals such as W and Mo and alloys thereof, copper and alloys thereof, etc. Examples of ceramic surfaces that may be coated include alumina, SiC, A1N, Si3N4, BC and Ti02. Examples of commercially available polymer materials that may be coated include fluoropolymers such as TeflonÂ®, polyimides such as VespelÂ®, and other polymeric materials useful in a plasma chamber at temperatures up to 200Â°C. In a preferred embodiment, the component to be coated is a chamber wall 28 having an anodized or unanodized aluminum surface 29. The coating according to the invention permits use of aluminum alloys without regard as to its composition (thus allowing use of more economical aluminum alloys in addition to highly pure aluminum), grain structure or surface conditions. In the following discussion, an example of a component to be coated is an aluminum chamber wall 28 having a first optional intermediate coating 80, a second optional intermediate coating 90 and a boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100, as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
In order to ensure good adhesion of the coated material, the surface of the aluminum substrate 28 is preferably thoroughly cleaned to remove surface material such as oxides or grease prior to coating. In addition, it is particularly desirable to roughen the substrate surface, anodize the substrate surface and again roughen the anodized substrate surface prior to application of any of the desired coatings.<br>
According to the invention, a first intermediate coating 80 is optionally coated on the aluminum sidewall 28 by a conventional technique. The optional first intermediate coating 80 is sufficiently thick to adhere to the substrate and to further allow it to be processed prior to forming the optional second intermediate coating 90 or the diamond containing coating described below. The first intermediate coating 80 can have any suitable thickness such as a thickness of at<br><br>
least about 0.001 inches, preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.25 inches, more preferably between 0.001 and 0.1 inches and most preferably from 0.001 inches to 0.05 inches.<br>
After depositing the optional first intermediate coating 80 onto aluminum substrate 28, the plating can be blasted or roughened by any suitable technique, and then overcoated with the second optional coating 90 or the boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100. A roughened layer 80 provides a particularly good bond. Desirably, the second intermediate coating 90 imparts a high mechanical compression strength to the coating 80 and minimizes formation of fissures in the coating 90.<br>
The optional second intermediate coating 90 is sufficiently thick to adhere to the first intermediate coating 80 and to further allow it to be processed prior to forming any additional intermediate coatings or the outer boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100 described below. The second intermediate coating 90 can have any suitable thickness such as a thickness of at least about 0.001 inches, preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.25 inches, more preferably between 0.001 and 0.1 inches and most preferably between 0.001 inches and 0.05 inches.<br>
The first and second intermediate coating may be made of any one or more materials employed in conventional plasma processing chambers. Examples of such materials include metals, ceramics and polymers. Particularly desirable metals include any one or more refractory metals, composites or alloys containing such metals. Particularly desirable ceramics include A1203, SiC, Si3N4, BC, A1N, Ti02, etc. Particularly desirable polymers include fluoropolymers such as TeflonÂ®, polyimides such as VespelÂ®, and other polymeric materials useful in a plasma chamber at temperatures up to 200Â°C. Specific materials contemplated for the intermediate layers also include fullerene containing materials; other hard carbon containing materials such as diamond and diamond-like materials; carbides,<br><br>
borides, nitrides and/or carbonitrides of, for example, hafnium, tantalum, titanium and/or silicon; boron carbides; boron nitrides; boron carbonitrides; zirconia; yttria or mixtures of any of the above-mentioned materials.<br>
It is contemplated that the first and second intermediate layers 80 and 90, which are optional may be any one of the above-mentioned materials such that the coatings are the same or different depending on the desired properties.  It is also anticipated that additional intermediate coatings such as a third, fourth or fifth intermediate coating of the same or different materials may be employed.<br>
The boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100 is deposited on the optional second intermediate coating 90, or on the optional first intermediate coating 80, or on the aluminum substrate 28. The thickness of the boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating is desirably at least 0.001 inches; preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.25 inches, more preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.1 inches and most preferably from 0.001 to 0.05 inches. The thickness of the boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100 can be selected to be compatible with the plasma environment to be encountered in the reactor (e.g., etching, CVD, etc.). This layer of boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating may be coated on all or part of the reactor chamber and components as discussed above. Most desirably, the boron nitride/yttria composite coatings are of a thickness useful to provide erosion and/or corrosion protection to the underlying layers, and particularly the substrate, for a significant period of exposure to the corrosive chamber gases.<br>
The boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100 of the present invention contains both boron nitride and yttria. The boron nitride component of the composite may be any one of hexagonal, cubic or mixture thereof. Most desirably the boron nitride component is 100% cubic phase or contains proportions of cubic phase exceeding 60% by weight, preferably exceeding 80% by weight and most preferably exceeding 90% by weight. The cubic form of boron nitride<br><br>
has a much higher density, is very hard and may be produced from the hexagonal form at high temperature and pressure. Alternatively, the boron nitride may be 100% hexagonal phase.<br>
The yttria component of the composite may be present in an amount between about one percent and 99 percent, more desirably between about 40 and 99 percent and even more desirably between about 60 and 80 percent of the total composite. The boron nitride component may be present in an amount between about one percent and 99 percent, more desirably between about one and 60 percent and even more desirably between about 20 and 40 percent of the total composite.<br>
The composite may include other protective materials in amounts up to about fifty percent of the total composite or greater. Desirably, boron nitride, yttria or zirconia form a continuous matrix phase in such composites. More desirably, the composites of the present invention include between about one and 40 percent by weight additional material, and more preferably between about one and 20 percent by weight additional material and even more preferably between about one and 10 percent by weight additional material based upon the composite.<br>
Such materials may include any one or more materials employed in plasma processing chambers. Examples of such materials include any one or more metals, ceramics or polymers. Particularly desirable metals include any one or more refractory metals, composites or alloys containing such metals. Particularly desirable ceramics include A1203, SiC, Si3N4, BC, A1N, Ti02, etc. Particularly desirable polymers include fluoropolymers such as TeflonÂ®, polyimides such as VespelÂ® and other polymeric materials useful in a plasma chamber at temperatures up to 200Â°C. It is believed that the most desirable materials would include a boron nitride/yttria composite alone or in combination with carbides, borides, nitrides and/or carbonitrides of, for example, hafnium, tantalum, titanium and/or<br><br>
silicon; boron carbides; boron nitrides; boron carbonitrides; zirconia; yttria or mixtures of the above-mentioned materials.<br>
The boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating 100 of the present invention may be deposited onto the desired surface by any known coating technique such as thermal spraying, plasma spraying, chemical vapor deposition, sublimation, laser vaporization, sputtering, sputter deposition, ion beam coating, spray coating, dip coating, evaporation, roll-on coating brush coating, etc. It is also contemplated that multiple boron nitride/yttria composite containing coatings with or without intermediate layers of other materials may be deposited onto the desired surface using any suitable technique.<br>
In an alternative aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor processing equipment component made of a boron nitride/yttria composite containing material. The component may include any one or more coatings conventionally employed in such equipment.<br>
By use of the boron nitride/yttria composite containing coatings or components of the present invention, it is preferred to obtain an ultrahard, erosion resistant surface. Such coating or component is desirably free of materials that react with processing chamber gases and are chemically inert such that there is low or no particle contamination, little or no corrosion, little or no metal contamination and/or little or no volatile etch products.<br>
It is preferred that boron nitride/yttria composite containing coating or component be placed in the regions that may or may not be exposed to the plasma environment such as parts in direct contact with the plasma or parts behind chamber components such as liners, etc., to prevent metal contamination of the semiconductor substrates processed in the reactor chamber. It is particularly preferred to limit or exclude transition metal dust; e.g., any one or more of elements 21 through 29 (scandium through copper), 39 through 47 (yttbrium through silver), 57 through 79 (lanthanum through gold) and all known elements<br><br><br><br><br>
