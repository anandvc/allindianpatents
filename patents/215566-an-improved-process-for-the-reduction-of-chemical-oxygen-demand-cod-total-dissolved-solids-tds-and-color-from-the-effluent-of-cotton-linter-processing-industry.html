				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and color from the effluent of cotton linter processing industry.<br>
According to literature COD, TDS and color of effluents from cotton linter processing industry may be attributed to the presence of lignin, hemicellulose, monosaccharides, amino acids, proteins, straight chain compounds like furfural and phenolics from the raw material like different varieties of cotton e.g. Gossypium hirsutum, G. arborium, G. herbaceum, G. thurberi, G. raimondi, G. tricuspidatum etc. which are generally used for making pulp for production of alpha cellulose. The presence of above mentioned impurities can affect pulp properties like color, strength of fiber etc. The raw material of the said process is the cotton linter, which are small fibers left out after removing the staple fiber from the seed coat. The cotton linters contain about 70-75% of alpha cellulose, 25 - 30% are the other impurities such as hemicellulose, fatty matter, proteins, pectins, amino acids, charred sugars, wax, lignin &amp; other organic &amp; inorganic impurities. Thus processed alpha cellulose is used as a starting material in the manufacture of nitrocellulose, an explosive used in defense. The cellulosic manmade fibers have acquired leading position in certain applications like clothing, home textiles, polyesters, bed linen, viscose rayons. Cellulose finds applications in the following areas such as films, cellophane, sausage casings, artificial kidneys, gums, thickeners, foods and Pharmaceuticals, cosmetics &amp; a derivative of cellulose viz. cellulose acetate in reverse osmosis. The cotton linter pulp is digested with dilute alkali under pressure to obtain high quality pulp of alpha cellulose, and during this treatment the impurities are leached out in<br>
the Black Liquor imparting deep color, high COD &amp; TDS. The alkali digested pulp is<br>
washed thoroughly and the effluent thus generated is known as Black Wash water<br>
having high COD &amp; TDS also color. The digested linters are further treated with<br>
bleaching agent and the discharge of this process is known as Wash Water which mainly<br>
contains carbonyl and carboxylic groups .<br>
Until past 2-3 decades or so large amount of colored effluents containing waxes, pectins,<br>
aminoacids, proteins, fatty matter, charred sugars, hemicellulose, lignin and other<br>
organics imparting high COD, TDS and color were discarded into natural stream and<br>
waterways as dilute aqueous solutions which is not tolerated now.<br>
In order to conform to environmental quality guidelines a number of primary and<br>
secondary treatment systems are installed. The treatment systems comprise clarifiers to<br>
remove 85  wt.% of suspended solids, aerated lagoons, trickling filters, modified<br>
biological systems to remove most of the solids and toxicity with reduction of COD but,<br>
very little removal of color &amp; TDS. Ultrafiltration has also been tried and found futile to<br>
remove TDS as well as color completely.<br>
In the prior art following methods are used to treat wastewater generated from processing<br>
plant of cotton linter. A few methods hitherto practiced are described in brief herein<br>

Wyatt et al. observed that aqueous medium enzyme compns. are provided which are suitable for degrading natural fibers inclusive of cellulose-based and protein-based fibers resulting in release of adsorbed, absorbed and/or entrained petroleum products and radioactive contaminants. A method is presented for releasing petroleum and hydrocarbon products sorbed onto or entrained by natural fibers in an aq. medium through the use of enzymes to degrade the natural fiber sorbents utilized for oil spill cleanup, the method provides an opportunity for achieving responsible sepn. of oil from oil spill sorbent materials. A method is also presented for prepg. cellulosic linter fibers by controlled enzyme biodegrdn. of cellulosic fibers by mixing the cellulosic fibers in an aq. medium with cellulases to degrade the natural fibers under controlled conditions for a sufficient period of shorten the cellulosic fiber source materials to linter lengths. The aq. medium enzyme compns. are also suitable for degrading protein-based fibers in an aq. medium enzyme compn. resulting in the prodn. of protein food supplements of the various amino acids which constitute the protein-based fibers.<br>

Abbot et al have studied Bleaching of cotton linters pulps with alk. H2O2 at 65°. Addn.<br>
of commonly used stabilizers, such as magnesium salts, DTPA, and silicate, did not<br>
enhance the bleaching response.    However, the presence of low concns. of certain<br>
transition metals, esp. Cu and Co, can enhance peroxide bleaching of cotton linters. This<br>
effect was correlated with the generation of hydroxyl radicals.   The cotton pulp could<br>
also be effectively bleached at low pulp concns. by exposure to UV radiation, both in the<br>
presence and absence of alk. peroxide.   The obsd. bleaching characteristics of cotton<br>
linters showed greater similarity to delignification of kraft pulps than to conventional<br>
peroxide bleaching of mech. pulps.<br>

Upadhyay et al have written a review, with 12 refs., on environmental aspects of the<br>
cotton textile industry in India, including manufg. processes and sources of effluent,<br>
including sizing, desizing, kiering, bleaching, mercerization, and dyeing; vols. of effluents; characteristics of effluents from different sections; water pollution; and pollution control, including good housekeeping, process control, redn. in chem. usage, recovery and reuse of chems., flow or vol. redn., process chem. substitution, and chem. and biol. treatment of waste-waters.<br>
Use of polyelectrolytes in the treatment of cotton textile waste. Sihorwala, T. A.; Reddy, K. G. (Dep. Civ. Eng., Shri G. S. Inst. Technol. Sci., Indore 452 003, India).  Indian J. Environ. Prot., 9(7), 513-15 (English) 1989.   CODEN: IJEPDH. ISSN: 0253-7141.  DOCUMENT TYPE: Journal CA Section: 60 (Waste Treatment and Disposal) Section cross-reference(s): 40, CA 113:157985<br>
Sihorwala et al have reported that the textile plant under study discharges its waste through 2 channels (channel-1 and channel-2). Channel-1 gets its waste from desizing, mercerizing and kiering sections whereas channel-2 gets its waste from dyeing, printing and finishing sections. The treatability of waste by coagulation was studied sep. and also by combining the 2 channel wastes in a ratio of 1:1. Channel-1 waste was less amenable to coagulation than channel-2 waste and the combined waste was intermediately amenable to coagulation treatment. The coagulants tested were alum, FeC13 and Catfloc-T, and APH-35. Catfloc-T is effective in removal of color, COD, and total solids from cotton textile waste. It is effective at pH &gt;10.0. The removal also occurred with anionic polyelectrolyte but to a less extent. Catfloc-T is more economic than alum and FeC13 as this did not involve the redn. of pH as required in the case of alum and FeC13.<br>

Simpson et al have reported that NaOH is recovered from cotton fiber scouring effluents by neutralization with C12 or CO2 (the latter is preferred), cross-flow microfiltration, charged-membrane ultrafiltration, and electrolysis in a cell with a Nafion 324 membrane. The COD and Ca and Mg contents were decreased by 90, 70, and 70% in the CO2 neutralization stage. The current efficiency of NaOH electrowinning was 80% and energy consumption 4000 kWh/ton 100% NaOH. The recovered NaOH and the depleted brine soln. with total solid content 500 mg/L are suitable for reuse.

DOCUMENT TYPE: Journal CA Section: 60 (Waste Treatment and Disposal) Section cross-reference(s): 40, CA 107:160784 Boehnke has observed that complete or nearly complete decolorization of cotton dyeing wastewater  is  only possible  with  advanced  physico-chem.,  post-activated  sludge treatment.   Dual media filtration and activated C filtration following A-B activated-sludge,   2-stage   treatment   can   give   completely   decolorized   effluents.      Partial decolorization is obtainable with post-pptn. and dual media filtration after the biol. step. Desorption and regeneration of dye colors from low-cost materials.

McKay et al have used low cost materials such as bentonite clay, among the 6 low-cost<br>
sorbents studied for the removal of 8 selected dyes, and shown that it could sorb all dyes<br>
with the exception of the acid dyes.   The regeneration of clay is not possible in the<br>
sorption of dyes, since strong chem. bonding occurs between it and the sorbed dyes. Rice<br>
husk, bark, cotton waste, and hair could sorb only the red and blue basic dyes and a<br>
combination of ion-exchange and chem. bonding occurs in the sorption process.<br>

Saccharification was 
In hitherto known processes main drawbacks are the use of acidic media which results into corrosion problems, use of enzymes which is economically not feasible, use of hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet rays which are hazardous during handling.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and color from the effluent of cotton linter processing industry which obviate the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
There is continued interest on development of new improved process for removal of color and other organic &amp; inorganic impurities produced during the pulping process of cotton linter. It is a well known fact that organics, inorganics as well as color in such type of effluents are not easily biodegradable and hence, have disposal problems in the natural environment.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (IDS) and color from the effluent of cotton linter processing industry which comprises; mixing the effluent characterized in that with a flocculating agent for a period of 1-10 minutes at a temperature ranging from 20 to 40°C, allowing the effluent to settle fro a period ranging from 30-120 minutes to obtain the desired treated effluent.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the effluent used for the treatment is selected from whe Black liquor, Black wash water and the mixture thereof along with wash water in black liquor: black wash water: wash water ratio of 8-9 : 95-110: 180-195.<br>
In an another embodiment the flocculating agent used is a mixture of three components wherein the first component being a sulphate, chloride, nitrate of transition metals preferably sulphate of iron and sulphate, chloride, nitrate of Group III metals preferably sulphate of aluminum and the second component being oxide of alkali or alkaline earth metals, of Group I or II such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, preferably an oxide of calcium and the third component being natural earth namely fullers earth, bentonite, dolomite, sand, garden soil, preferably dolomite and bentonite.<br>
In yet another embodiment the flocculating agent used is comprising a mixture of sulphate of aluminum &amp; iron and the mixture of natural earths such as dolomite and bentonite and an oxide of alkali or alkaline earth metal in the ratio of 35-45: 45-55: 4-6 : 4-6 : 190-210.<br>
In still another embodiment the mixing time of flocculation agent with the effluent is preferably 2 minutes.<br>
In the feature of the present invention after the flocculation treatment of the individual Black liquor as well as Black wash water sample and mixture of black liquor, black wash water and wash water, significant reduction of color, and COD was observed for all the three effluent samples tested.<br>
The process of the present invention reduces COD, color and to some extent TDS simultaneously at 20 to 40°C temperature from cotton linter processing effluent, thus saving energy cost, the operation does not involve any use of mineral acid, thus avoiding corrosion problems. The novelty of the process lies in the use of flocculating agent comprising of a mixture of transition metal salts and the oxide of alkaline earth metal and a mixture of natural earths.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein bellow with reference to the examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to the limit of scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example -1<br>
200 ml Black Liquor generated from the cotton linter processing plant was diluted with tap water to 1 lit. ( COD - 1 l,936ppm and TDS 25,770ppm of pH- 10.0) was taken in 2 Lit. beaker to which flocculent comprising of mixture of aluminum sulphate, ferrous sulphate, dolomite and bentonite (200mg) in 40:50:5:5 proportion and calcium oxide 20g<br>
was added and mixed thoroughly and poured in a 1 Lit. measuring cylinder for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The supernate thus obtained was analyzed for it's COD, IDS, BOD and color reduction using spectrophotometer at 480 nm after adjusting the pH of the sample to ~ 8. The treated sample of the Black Liquor showed COD as 1818 ppm, TDS 4160 ppm and color reduction was found to be 88%.<br>
Example- 2<br>
200 ml Black wash water ( COD -849ppm and TDS 840ppm of pH- 8.8) generated from the cotton linter processing plant was diluted with tap water to 1 lit. and was taken in a 2 Lit. beaker to which flocculent comprising of mixture of aluminum sulphate, ferrous sulphate, dolomite and bentonite (200mg) in 40:50:5:5 proportion and calcium oxide 400mg was added and mixed thoroughly and poured in a 1 Lit. measuring cylinder for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The supernate thus obtained was analyzed for it's COD, TDS, BOD and color reduction using spectrophotometer at 480 nm after adjusting the pH of the sample to ~ 8. The treated sample of the Black Liquor showed COD as 80 ppm, TDS 440 ppm and color reduction was found to be 35%.<br>
Example -3<br>
1000 ml of the mixture of the effluent containing 30ml of Black Liquor, 334ml of Black wash water and 636ml of Wash water generated from the cotton linter processing plant having COD -513 ppm and TDS 2310 ppm of pH- 7.2, was taken in a 2 Lit. beaker to which flocculent comprising of mixture of aluminum sulphate, ferrous sulphate, dolomite and bentonite (l.Og) in 40:50:5:5 proportion and calcium oxide 2.0g was added and mixed thoroughly and poured in a 1 Lit. measuring cylinder for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The supernate thus obtained was analyzed for it's COD, TDS, BOD and<br>
color reduction using spectrophotometer at 480 nm after adjusting the pH of the sample to ~ 8. The treated sample of the Black Liquor showed COD as 102.7 ppm, TDS 2370 ppm and color reduction was found to be 95%.<br>
Example - 4<br>
100 m3 of the mixture of the effluent containing 3m3 of Black Liquor, 33.4m3 of Black wash water and 63.6m3 of Wash water generated from the cotton linter processing plant having COD - 727 ppm and TDS 2310ppm of pH- 7.2 was taken in 210m3 capacity rectangular setteling tank to which flocculent comprising of mixture of aluminum sulphate, ferrous sulphate, dolomite and bentonite (100kg) in 40:50:5:5 proportion and calcium oxide 200kg was added and mixed thoroughly with a movable floating mixer and allowed to settle at ambient temperature. The supernate thus obtained was analyzed for it's COD, TDS, BOD and color reduction using spectrophotometer at 480 nm after adjusting the pH of the sample to ~ 8. The treated sample of the Black Liquor showed COD as 241 ppm, TDS 2390 ppm and color reduction was found to be 95%. Advantages of the invention :<br>
The present process has following advantages such as it reduces COD, TDS and color simultaneously at ambient temperature from cotton linter pulp effluents, thus saving energy cost, the operation does not involve any use of mineral acid thus, avoiding corrosion problems , thus the process is eco-friendly. The process does not involve any hazardous chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and expensive reactants like enzymes for the treatment. Thus the process is easy to operate as well as cost effective.<br><br><br>
