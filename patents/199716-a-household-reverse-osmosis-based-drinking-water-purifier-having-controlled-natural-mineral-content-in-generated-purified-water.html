				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a water purifier and, in particular, to a household reverse osmosis based drinking water purifier adapted for controlled natural mineral content in generated purified water. The reverse osmosis based water purifier adapted for delivery of purified water with controlled natural mineral content is simple and cost effective and serves to provide safe and healthy drinking water suitable for household purposes. The water purifier of the invention is adapted compact and user-friendly configuration of reverse osmosis based purifier so as to facilitate its ready and wide application even in remote locations.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Drinking water contamination is a serious health concern and with the water resources being polluted gradually with various sources of contamination, provision of pure and safe drinking water has been a continuing concern in the related field. While variety of drinking water purifier means/system have been developed and provided from time to time, the complexities of contamination and removal of harmful contaminants and yet providing for a safe and healthy drinking water is found to be extremely challenging.<br>
Over the years various means to purify drinking water have been provided in the art ranging from activated carbon purifier, membrane filtration, sediment filters, ultra violet lamp as filtration means as well as reverse osmosis to provide for purified drinking water.<br>
US 5,928,503 disclose a desktop drinking water machine and include a reverse osmosis mechanism consisting of a reverse osmosis filter and a pair of active carbon filters. The reverse osmosis mechanism is linked to a pump through an inlet pipe, a pure water pipe connected to a reservoir and an outlet pipe connected to the original reservoir where both pipes link the original reservoir to the pump. A water level sensor in the reservoir is linked with the pump through a processor to control a water pumping operation. When the water level rises above the water level sensor, the pump is initiated and delivers water from the reservoir into the reverse osmosis<br>
mechanism. Pure water then flows into the storage tank and wastewater flows to the reservoir. When the volume of the water in the reservoir is approximately one-third of the volume of the original water maintained in the reservoir, the pump is deactivated. At this time, the purified water contained in the storage tank approximates two-thirds of the volume of the water in the reservoir, which provides for an increased purifying rate.<br>
US 6,383,384 is directed to An apparatus for purifying water that uses a synchronous combination of a worm gear and spring assembly that delivers constant mechanical energy for sustaining continuous filtration operations without the concomitant repetitious cranking that has been commonly prerequisite in the art. A simple means for storing energy as a ready reservoir for pressure-driving an aqueous solution through semi permeable membranes to produce purified water. An electric motor may be provided particularly to support mass production of fresh water from salt water. The electric motor is preferably applied intermittently to engender sufficient energy storage to sustain continuous filtration.<br>
US 6,579,451 teaches a water desalting installation which comprises at least an auxiliary pump and another high pressure pump in parallel with an internal circulation pump, and at least one pair of feed chamber which are pressurized alternatively, each of them forming a closed circuit, preferably toroidal, so that the water circulates always in the same direction and continuously, taking advantage of its kinetic energy in the valve actuation; it may have separation means to separate the water masses of different salinity, said separation means being comprised of pistons having a spherical shape and of which the apparent density is similar to that of the water, said pistons being retained briefly during the cycle change by baskets or equivalent devices, while the water circulates to the expense of its kinetic energy, the cycle changes being controlled by approximation and housing sensors, or by flow meters or by salinity measures when such separation means are not available.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that the provision of reverse osmosis based water purifiers is well known and commonly in use. Importantly however such reverse osmosis based water purifiers are basically used for purifying water having high salt content. Moreover, also such reverse osmosis based purifiers are found to provide excellent result in removing bacteria, viruses and apart from salts from tabs/tube well water.<br>
While the above state of the art to go to reveal the provision gadget/means to purify drinking water especially by way of removal of bacteria, viruses and salts, it is found that the desired removal of salt which is mostly attended involving the reverse osmosis means is accompanied with problem of unwanted removal of natural health ingredients/contents from drinking water. Importantly, it is found by way of the present invention that the use of reverse osmosis based purifiers to purify water having high salt content is essentially accompanied with removal of essential minerals from raw water, which are required by human body from drinking water. Thus while reverse osmosis means for purification of water can provide for excellent results in removing bacteria, viruses as well as salts from tap/tube well water, it is found that such purification or purified water obtained through such reverse osmosis system was highly deficient in as far as the requirement of essential natural minerals from raw water required by the human body.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a reverse osmosis based water purifier which would be capable of generating pure drinking water with desired controlled natural mineral content to make the purified water safe and healthy to drink.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to reverse osmosis based water purifier which would not only enable removal of salts from tap/tube well water or other water sources having high salt content but would also be capable of removing harmful bacteria/viruses and finally provide for purified water which would contain essential minerals required by the human body.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a reverse osmosis based water purifier, which would take care of the above, identified problem of demineralization of water treated through reverse osmosis.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a reverse osmosis based water purifier adapted to deliver purified water with controlled and desired natural mineral content to provide for safe and healthy purified drinking water.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a selective combination in reverse osmosis based water purifier system adapted to remove sediment/particulate contaminants, harmful bacteria/virus, removal of excess salts and provide for good quality drinking water having safe and desired levels of health beneficial mineral content. Present reverse osmosis water purifiers remove even the desired level of mineral content from water; however the present invention provides a controlled addition of minerals in the purified water.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a reverse osmosis based purifier which would be adapted to remove undissolved impurities like sediments, bacteria, viruses as well as dissolved impurities like salts, minerals etc. and yet provide for purified water with controlled natural mineral content, as the same is required in minimum quantity for good health.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantageous are explained here under in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the water purifier involving reverse osmosis means/membrane in accordance with the invention adapted to generate purified drinking water with controlled mineral content as per the accompany figures wherein:<br>
Fig 1 is schematic illustration of an embodiment of the water purifier of the invention involving reverse osmosis membrane and UF membrane in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig 2 is schematic illustration of another embodiment of the water purifier of the invention involving reverse osmosis membrane and UF membrane;<br>
Fig 3 is yet another schematic illustration of an embodiment of the water purifier of the invention involving reverse osmosis membrane and UV lamp;<br>
Fig 4 is yet further schematic illustration of another embodiment of the water purifier of the invention involving reverse osmosis membrane and UV lamp;<br>
Reference is first invited to accompany Fig 1, which illustrates the first embodiment of the invention in particular the water purifier adapted for pre-mixing and involving ultra fine membrane as secondary purification means. As illustrated in said figure the water purifier is adapted and selectively disposed with reverse osmosis and filtration means such that water reach in salt content and contaminated with bacteria, viruses and organic compounds is first allowed traverse through a sediment filter (l){preferably 5.00 micron} to remove suspended particulates from raw water. Thereafter the water in the device is allowed to pass through an activated carbon filter (2) adapted to remove any organic compounds. Next the water is pressurized involving pump means (3) and the output is bifurcated such that one channel is fed into a reverse osmosis membrane (4) and the other channel goes into a flow control valve (5). Some of the water entering the reverse osmosis membrane is rejected as it is used for washing away excessive salts and impurities from the membrane via the flow restricted tube (6). The purified water coming out of the reverse osmosis<br>
membrane (4) is the demineralised water which is then mixed with pressurized water (partially purified) using flow control valve (5) to obtain mixed water having controlled natural minerals. Importantly the water purifier of the invention not only provides for adding the much required natural mineral in reverse osmosis purified water but also provides for flexibility in controlling through control valve (5) the amount of mineral content in the purified water generated by the purifier. In particular the pressurized water flow can be regulated to increase or decrease the amount of mineral in the mixed water. The final form of the purified water generated by the purifier controls natural mineral contents, which is required for adding health benefits to such purified drinking water. Moreover the purifier before its discharge outlet provides for traversal of the water through a hollow UF membrane element (7) of about 0.001 Micron pores for removing all bacteria/viruses from it and to produce purified water free of impurities and controlled natural mineral content.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying in Fig 2, which illustrates a second embodiment of the water purifier of the invention. As illustrated in said figure the purifier of this embodiment is having a selective different combination of features from that of the first embodiment so as to provide for a post mixing provision instead of pre-mixing provision as that of the first embodiment. In this embodiment the raw water is first allowed to pass through a sediment filter (1) {preferably 5.00 micron} and then through an activated carbon filter (2). Water is thereafter allowed to pressurized using pump means (3) and the output is bifurcated such that one channel is fed into a reverse osmosis membrane (4) and the other into UF membrane (7). The purified water passing though the reverse osmosis membrane (4) is demineralised and thereafter mixed with purified water coming out of the UF membrane (7). Some of the water entering the reverse osmosis membrane is rejected as it is used for washing away excessive salts and impurities from the membrane via the flow restricted tube (6). Likewise the embodiment of figure 1, a flow valve (5) is provided to selectively deliver purified water with desired controlled natural minerals.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 3, which illustrates another embodiment of the water purifier in accordance with the present invention. As would be apparent from the schematic illustration of this embodiment the same is basically in line with the arrangement as per first embodiment except that instead of the<br>
provision of UF membrane (7 in figure 1), this embodiment after the mixing and adjustment of natural mineral content the mixed water is processed through a UV lamp (8) adapted to deactivate bacteria and viruses and provide purified water with controlled minerals.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 4, which illustrates another embodiment of the water purifier in accordance with the present invention. As would be apparent from the schematic illustration of this embodiment the same is basically in line with the arrangement as per third embodiment except that the pressurized water generated by the pump means (3) is bifurcated into a reverse osmosis membrane (4) and a UV lamp (8) instead of a UF membrane. Some of the water entering the reverse osmosis membrane is rejected as it is used for washing away excessive salts and impurities from the membrane via the flow restricted tube (6). Importantly likewise the other embodiments the output of reverse osmosis membrane (4) and UV lamp (8) are selectively combined using flow control valve (5) to obtain purified water with controlled minerals.<br>
It is thus possible by way of above disclosed water purifier in particular reverse osmosis based drinking water purifier which would enable providing purified water with controlled natural minerals for safe and healthy consumption especially for household purposes. The purifier of the invention provides for a selective reverse osmosis and UF and/or UV purification means which enable simple, cost effective and user-friendly compact purifier device for household purposes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
