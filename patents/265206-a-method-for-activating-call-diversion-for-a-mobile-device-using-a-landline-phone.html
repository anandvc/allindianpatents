FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of telecommunication technology and in particular relates to activation of incoming call diversion using PSTN as an access network especially when the user is not in the coverage area of mobile network. The invention includes Mobile network PSTN network architecture.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Mobile network supports call diversion/call forwarding based on various conditions and circumstances. The activation of call diversion/forwarding is done from user equipment (mobile handset) when user is in the coverage area. In the present scenario the activation of call diversion/forwarding is only possible if subscriber is within the mobile network coverage area. Currently if user moves to non coverage area and if the particular area is connected through PSTN network (or any other N/W) there is no provision to use the PSTN network to activate the call diversion/ forwarding and get all incoming calls diverted to particular landline or any other mobile number.<br>
The US Patent number 5839065 describes a method for validation of a forward-to-number by a mobile station wherein the call forwarding activation request is transmitted from a mobile station to the serving mobile switching center (MSC) over a data channel incapable of carrying voice data. However, mobile subscribers and mobile service providers would like to establish a speech connection between the mobile station and the forward-to-number to ensure that the forward-to-number has been dialed correctly and that desired parties are at the other end. Accordingly, whenever a call forwarding activation request is received by the mobile station, the mobile station itself initiates an outgoing call setup toward the forward-to-number. The connection-less signal encapsulating the activation request is transmitted to the serving MSC only after the successful completion of<br><br>
such call setup. After receiving the transmitted connection-less signal, the serving HLR alters the call forwarding feature status to active.<br>
Another US Patent number 6611682 describes a telephone apparatus in a mobile telephone system providing a conditional call divert service causing an incoming call to proceed as a normal call or be redirected to a different number. The telephone apparatus has memory means for storing coded telephone number entries. Each telephone number entry includes a group identification field for storing a value identifying its telephone number group, and the telephone apparatus further has control circuit means enabling optional operation modes of the telephone. One mode causes an incoming call from a telephone having a subscriber number which is a member of a telephone number group associated with the mode to proceed as a normal call, and an incoming call from another telephone having a subscriber number which is not a member of the group to be redirected to a preset number. However, none of the Patents relates to activation of incoming call diversion using PSTN as an access network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to call diversion activation from landline. The mobile user shall be able to activate the call diversion using the PSTN network as an access network. Once the diversion is activated to any phone number user will be able to receive all his/her incoming calls to that phone number. The following conditions should be matched to activate the diversion from PSTN<br>
1.	The mobile network should support the call diversion/call-forwarding feature.<br>
2.	There should be some inter working between PSTN and Mobile N/Ws.<br>
Mobile network is referred herein as a network based on any mobile technology/standard e.g. GSM, UMTS, CDMA 2000 etc. and PSTN is referred herein as fix network, wire lined or wireless.<br><br>
Using this method the mobile subscriber will be able to activate his/her incoming call diversion even if he/she is not in the coverage area of mobile network. The said access network can be extended to any network other than PSTN like internet, ISDN etc.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for call diversion activation from landline wherein one inter working gateway functionality is used for inter working between PSTN and Mobile Network where implementation of such functionality is done by using separate gateway or on GMSC .<br>
A inter working node is adapted to play the IVRS options for call forwarding<br>
activation/deactivation/interrogation    and    authenticating    the    user.	The<br>
authentication is done using a MSISDN number and the PIN where the PIN is assigned to each subscriber uniquely. When a mobile is currently outside the coverage area of its mobile network and wishes to activate the call diversion to any other number then the mobile subscriber dials access code from a PSTN landline phone. A Local Exchange routes the call towards gateway of mobile network where the Gateways plays IVRS option for mobile subscriber over a switched voice path. Using in-band DTMF signaling subscriber chooses his option which is identified by gateway and further gateway prepares messages and forward to last/currently serving MSC. The MSC registers the diversion info at VLR and HLR and after receiving acknowledgement from MSC gateway informs the subscriber on existing voice call using IVRS. After successful completion of diversion activation/deactivation/interrogation the voice call gets disconnected and all resources used are released. Call diversion is done for different call forwarding scenarios such as Call forward Unconditional, Call forward on subscriber busy, Call forward on No Reply and Call forward on subscriber is not reachable. For Call forward Unconditional all incoming calls for the subscriber is diverted to a user specified number and the details about call forwarding to GMSC is made available by home network's HLR in the response of INFO_REQUEST by GMSC at the time of initial call setup for incoming call where GMSC further routes the call to<br><br>
forwarded number. On Call forward on subscriber busy the serving VLR is responsible for providing the forwarding information to switching unit and depends upon the forwarded number that which switching entity switches the call further. If forwarded number is under the same MSCA/LR serving area then the same MSC switches the call to forwarded number. On Call forward on No Reply the answer from mobile station is monitored with a timer and on expiry of timer the call is dropped and further forwarding is done . On Call forward on subscriber is not reachable condition the status of subscriber is determined by MSC and further forwarding is done.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be<br><br>
embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the system including the embodiments of the invention used to provide the incoming call diversion using PSTN as an access network especially when the user is not in the coverage area of mobile network. MS denotes the Mobile Station. The radio area coverage of a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) usually forms a cell. Several BTSs together are controlled by one Base Station Controller (BSC). The combined traffic of the mobile station in their respective cells is routed through the Mobile Switching Center (MSC). The Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) handles all the connections originating from or terminating in the fixed network and here it particularly connects the mobile network to the external network.<br>
The Home Location Register (HLR), the Visited Location Register (VLR) and the Authentication Center (AUC) together avail the several data bases for call control and network management. HLR stores the permanent data (users' profile) as well as the temporary data (users' current location) for all users registered with a network operator. In case a call to a user is initiated, the HLR is first queried to determine the users current location. A VLR is responsible for a group of location areas and stores the data of those users who are currently in its area of responsibility. This includes parts of the permanent user data that have been transmitted from HLR to the VLR for faster access. But VLR may also assign and store local data such as a temporary identification.<br>
AUC generates and stores security related data such as keys used for authentication and encryption. LE denotes the local exchange which switches all<br><br>
the incoming/outgoing calls for landline subscribers under the Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN). The Inter Working Gateway (IWG) is responsible for the data transfer between the PSTN and mobile network.<br>
(A) call forwarding scenarios:<br>
1.	Call forward Unconditional<br>
All incoming calls for the subscriber will be diverted to some user specified number. The details about call forwarding to GMSC will be made available by home network's HLR in the response of INFO_REQUEST by GMSC at the time of initial call setup for incoming call. GMSC will further route the call to forwarded number.<br>
2.	Call forward on subscriber busy<br>
The serving VLR is responsible for providing the forwarding information to switching unit. It's depends upon the forwarded number that which switching entity will switch the call further.<br>
If forwarded number is under the same MSCA/LR serving area then the same MSC will switch the call to forwarded number and if it is some other number then gateway will be responsible for further routing and switching but the VLR of subscriber (whom the original call was made) will be responsible for providing the forwarding information.<br>
3.	Call forward on No Reply<br>
This condition is almost same as CFB only the difference is that the answer from mobile station is monitored with a timer. On expiry of timer the call will be dropped and further forwarding is done in same way as in CFB.<br>
4.	Call forward on subscriber is not reachable<br>
This condition is same as CFB the non reachable status of subscriber will be<br><br>
determined by MSC and further handling is same as CFB.<br>
(B)	Basic procedures involved in call forward supplementary services are:<br>
1.	Registration<br>
The call forwarding supplementary service has to be registered by user to avail this facility with network this is can be done using subscribers mobile handset and SIM.<br>
2.	Erasure<br>
Any registered supplementary service can be erased in different ways by subscriber.<br>
3.	Activation<br>
The call forwarding facility can be activated by user using different option available on handset if he/she is connected to mobile network i.e. within the mobile network coverage area. Here this section describer how activation can be done even if user is outside the coverage area of mobile network using PSTN as an access network.<br>
4.	Deactivation<br>
The call forwarding to any number for specific circumstance can be deactivated by user when the facility is no longer required to user.<br>
5.	Interrogation<br>
At any point of time user may require to know the status (active/de active) of any<br>
particular call forwarding<br>
Condition and few details like for which number it is active.<br>
(C)	Method for accessing the call forwarding supplementary service of mobile<br>
network using PSTN as   an access network:<br><br>
One inter working gateway functionality is required for inter working between PSTN and Mobile Network. Implementation of such functionality can be done by using separate gateway or on GMSC itself.<br>
This inter working node should be able to play the IVRS options for call forwarding activation/deactivation/interrogation and authenticating the user. The authentication can be done using the MSISDN number and the PIN (personal identification number). The PIN can be assigned to each subscriber uniquely at the time of subscription or provision can be made to change this PIN by subscriber of his choice.<br>
A mobile subscriber is currently outside the coverage area of his mobile network wishes to activate his call diversion to any other number. The mobile subscriber has to dial access code (An IN number) from a PSTN landline phone. LE (Local Exchange) will route the call towards gateway of mobile network. Gateways suppose to play IVRS option for mobile subscriber over the switched voice path.<br>
Using in-band DTMF signaling subscriber will choose his option which will be identified by gateway. Further gateway will prepare messages and forward to last/currently serving MSC. The MSC is responsible for registering the diversion info at VLR and HLR. After receiving acknowledgement from MSC gateway will inform the subscriber on existing voice call using IVRS. After successful completion of diversion activation/deactivation/interrogation the voice call can be disconnected either by subscriber of gateway and all resources used will be released.<br>
Figure 2 shows the call forward unconditional activation involving the various message sequence between the entities. Once the subscriber dials the access code from his/her telephone, LE will route the call towards gateway of mobile network. The gateway plays the IVRS option for mobile subscriber over the<br><br>
switched voice path. The subscriber selects the option for call forward unconditional activation and the gateway sends the message to the currently serving MSC which register the diversion information at VLR and HLR. After receiving the acknowledgement from MSC the gate way informs the subscriber that the feature has been activated using IVRS. After successful completion of the activation, the voice call can be disconnected either by subscriber or the gateway and as a result all the resources will be released.<br>
Figure 3 to figure 13 follow the same procedure except that the subscriber goes for the various IVRS options. In figure 3 the subscriber selects call forward unconditional de-activation, in figure 4 the subscriber selects the call forward unconditional interrogation, in figure 5 he goes for the call forward on busy activation, in figure 6 he goes for the call forward on busy de-activation, in figure 7 he goes for the call forward busy interrogation, in figure 8 he goes for the call forward on no-reply activation, in figure 9 he goes for the call forward on no reply de-activation, in figure 10 he goes for call forward on no reply interrogation, in figure 11 he goes for call forward on not reachable activation, in figure 12 he goes for not reachable de-activation and in figure 13 for not reachable interrogation.<br>
(D) Changes Required:<br>
•	Mobile Handset Side<br>
No changes are required at mobile handset.<br>
•	PSTN Network Side<br>
No changes are required at PSTN network except inter working with mobile network.<br>
•	Mobile Network Side<br>
New node functionality is to be developed. Physically it can be done on GMSC or some other node. The IVRS is already implemented on MSC/GMSC so minor changes are required. No changes are required in message format as all call<br><br>
diversion related message to be prepared at gateway or MSC only. (E) Enhancements:<br>
•	Accessing mobile network features using other network as an access network can be extended to other similar supplementary services.<br>
•	The access network could be extended to any network like ISDN, INTERNET and Other mobile networks.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>
