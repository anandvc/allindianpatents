				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valve. Particularly the EGR valve is the main emissions control component in the exhaust gas recirculation system. The EGR valve is opened by the application of vacuum/ pressure to its control diaphragm. The opening and closing of the EGR valve and the amount of recirculation of exhaust gas depends on the engine design.<br>
Background<br>
Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is a NOx (nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide) reduction technique used in most gasoline and diesel engines.<br>
EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders. Mixing the incoming air with recirculated exhaust gas dilutes the mix with inert gas, lowering the adiabatic flame temperature and (in diesel engines) reducing the amount of excess oxygen. The exhaust gas also increases the specific heat capacity of the mix lowering the peak combustion temperature. Because NOx formation progresses much faster at high temperatures, EGR serves to limit the generation of NOx. NOx is primarily formed when a mix of nitrogen and oxygen is subjected to high temperatures.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the invention provides for an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve for recirculating engine's exhaust gases comprises an actuator having top cover (15), compression spring (14), diaphragm (3); wherein gasket diaphragm (12) placed below the top portion of the diaphragm (3) acts as temperature seal, a steel washer-big (8) is placed in between two gasket-big (11) to avoid temperature being conducted to the diaphragm (3), and a combination of gasket-small (10), cup-washer (13), steel washer-small (9) are placed on the either sides of the diaphragm (3) for supporting the diaphragm (3); wherein the gasket small acts as a temperature seal, a body having inlet hole for receiving exhaust gases and outlet hole for delivering the exhaust gases; and a valve mechanism comprising a valve (6) that is positionable along an axis relative to valve seat (2) to control the flow of the exhaust gases from the inlet hole to the outlet hole, a valve body (1) to mount the annular bush (4) along the axis relative to valve seat<br><br>
(2)	to guide a shaft (7) movement, wherein the shaft (7) is connected to the diaphragm<br>
(3)	of the actuator by means of a nut (17) at one end and passed through the annular bush (4) and orbital riveted to the valve (6) at other end; a gasket seal (18) placed in between the shaft (7) and steel washer-small (9) acts as a temperature seal.<br>
A method of recirculating engine's exhaust gases using an exhaust gas recirculation valve, wherein said method comprises applying vacuum pressure through the vacuum port of the top cover (15) to move diaphragm (3) upwards which in turn lifts up the shaft (7) attached to it; and actuates the valve (6) to open for allowing the exhaust gases to pass through the valve (6) from inlet hole to outlet hole.<br>
A method of assembling an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve comprising steps of connecting the shaft (7) to the diaphragm (3) of the actuator at one end by means of a nut (17) and passing through the annular bush (4) and orbital riveting to the valve (6) at other end.<br>

Industrial Applicability:<br>
The disclosed exhaust gas recirculation valve potential application in any exhaust gas recirculation system. The disclosed exhaust gas recirculation valve finds particular applicability in automotives, especially in most gasoline and diesel engines.<br>
The exhaust gas recirculation valve is the main emission control component in the exhaust gas recirculation system. The valve is located near the intake manifold, and opens a small passageway between the exhaust manifold and intake manifold to allow a metered amount of exhaust gases to flow back into the engine. This reduces combustion temperatures and helps to controlling the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).<br>
Referring Fig.2, the exhaust gas recirculation valve is opened by the application of vacuum to its control diaphragm. The opening and closing of the exhaust gas recirculation valve and the amount of recirculation of exhaust gas depends on the engine design.<br>
