As described above, the mobile PG center 300 and the micropayment SMS server 400 analyze the virtual caller ID such that the charge, charge cancellation, deposit presentation requested by the user may be performed. The user stores the virtual caller ID as described with reference to FIG. 5 in the phone number storage unit <br>
5 	of own mobile communication terminal in order to simply charge a deposit to his own deposit account, canceling charge, and presenting a deposit to another user via transmitting a short message to the virtual caller ID.<br>
On the other hand, a mobile micropayment service process with respect to deposit charge of the mobile micropayment service system using the virtual caller ID of<br>
10     the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7 as following.<br>
In the present invention, a user transmits a short message using a virtual caller ID, thereby charging a deposit. A process of charging a deposit may be divided into a first deposit charge process of FIG. 6, in which a user initially charges a deposit via a certain member company server when the user initially uses a mobile micropayment<br>
15 	service in the member company server, and a second deposit charge process of FIG. 7, in which the user directly transmits a short message to the virtual caller ID acquired by performing the first deposit charge process, thereby charging a deposit.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flow chart sequentially illustrating the first deposit charge process of a mobile micropayment service method according to an embodiment of the present<br>
20 	invention. In the flow chart, a user initially uses mobile micropayment via the member company server 200. Though a process in which a deposit is charged to the deposit account of the user is shown in FIG. 6, charge cancellation or deposit presentation is described with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, when a mobile communication terminal 20 of a user<br>
25 	connected to the member company server 200 via Internet 310 transmits mobile communication terminal number information of the user and requested charge amount information to the member company server 200 to request mobile micropayment (SI01), a deposit account of the user is opened (SI 02) and the information is stored in a deposit account database 210.<br>
30	The process of opening the deposit account (S102) may be performed after the<br>
member company server 200 checks whether the deposit account of the user exists in the deposit account database 210 and the existence of the deposit account is ascertained.<br><br>
WO 2006/004277<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000907<br><br>
18<br>
Next, the member company server 200 transmits the mobile communication<br>
terminal   number  information  of the  user,  the  member  company  identification<br>
information, and requested charge amount information to the mobile PG center 300 to<br>
request payment (SI03).<br>
5	If the user want to charge a deposit in a deposit account of another user instead<br>
of own deposit account, the member company server 200 must receive mobile communication terminal number information of the another user receiving a deposit from the user, check the deposit account of the another user, and transmit the mobile communication terminal number information of the user, the requested charge amount<br>
10	 information, and the mobile communication terminal number information of the another user that receives deposit present to the mobile PG center 300 in case of requesting payment.<br>
Also, when the user want to cancel the deposit previously charged in the deposit account of his own, the member company server 200 may transmit the mobile<br>
15     communication terminal number, the charge amount information, and information of a<br>
charge cancellation identifier indicating charge cancellation to the mobile PG center 300.<br>
On the other hand, when the information of mobile communication terminal<br>
number of the user and the charge amount is transmitted from the member company<br>
server 200 to request payment, the mobile PG center 300 checks whether charge<br>
20	 information including the member company identification information, the mobile communication terminal number, information of the user, and the charge amount information exists in the charge information database. When the charge information does not exist, the mobile PG center generates charge information including the member company identification information, the mobile communication  terminal number<br>
25 	information of the user, and the charge amount information and stores the charge information in the charge information database 320 (SI04).<br>
Next, the mobile PG center 300 transmits the mobile communication terminal number information, the member company identification information,, for example, ID or identification number, and the charge amount information to the micropayment SMS<br>
30     server 400 (SI05).<br>
The micropayment SMS server 400 generates a virtual caller ID 070-1234-3000 including the member company identification information 1234 and the charge amount<br><br>
WO 2006/004277	PCT/KR2005/000907<br>
information 3000 received from the mobile PG center 300 (SI06) and transmits a short payment request message using the generated virtual caller ID to the mobile communication terminal (SI07).<br>
On the other hand, in case of canceling charge, the mobile PG center 300 <br>
5 	further transmits a charge cancellation identifier information * to the micropayment SMS server 400, and the micropayment SMS server 400 generates a virtual caller ID 070-1234-3000* including the charge cancellation identifier information. In case of deposit presentation, the mobile PG center further transmits the mobile communication terminal number information of the user receiving a deposit, 0177890414, and the<br>
10 	micropayment SMS server 400 generates a virtual caller ID 070-1234-3000-0177890414'including the number.<br>
In the above embodiment, though the micropayment SMS server 400 generates a virtual caller ID, the mobile PG center 300 may generate the virtual caller ID. That is, the mobile PG center 300 generates a virtual caller ID including the member<br>
15	 company identification information and the charge amount information and transmits the generated virtual caller ID information and the mobile communication terminal number information received from the member company server 200 to the micropayment SMS server 400 to request transmitting/receiving an SMS.<br>
When an authentication procedure with respect to mobile micropayment is<br>
20 	required, the micropayment SMS server 400 must request a reply including authentication information of the user via a short payment request message transmitted to the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user.<br>
Next, when a short payment acknowledgment message using the virtual caller ID including the member company identification information and the charge amount<br>
25 	information as a called number is received from the mobile communication terminal 10 (SI08), the micropayment SMS server 400 acquires the member company identification information and the charge amount information from the virtual caller ID that is the called number of the short payment acknowledgment message and transmits an SMS reception acknowledgment message including the acquired information and number<br>
30 	information of the mobile communication terminal transmitting the message to the mobile PG center 300 (SI 10).<br>
If the charge cancellation identifier information or the mobile communication<br><br>
WO 2006/004277<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000907<br><br><br>
 	terminal number of the user receiving the deposit is included in the virtual caller ID, the<br>
SMS reception acknowledgment message further includes the charge cancellation<br>
identifier information or the mobile communication terminal number information of the<br>
user receiving the deposit.<br>
	5	In the above description, the micropayment SMS server 400 acquires the<br>
member company identification information and the charge amount information from the virtual caller ID that is the called number of the short payment acknowledgment message and transmits the acquired member company identification information and the charge amount information to the mobile PG center 300.    However, the micropayment<br>
10     		SMS server 400 may transmit the virtual caller ID as it is to the mobile PG center 300.<br>
Also, when the authentication procedure is required, the micropayment SMS<br>
server  400  receives  a  short  payment  request  message  including  authentication<br>
information from the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user and compares the<br>
authentication information included in the received message with authentication<br>
15 	information of the user stored in the user information database 410 to perform authentication (SI09). When the authentication is successively performed, the micropayment SMS server 400 transmits an SMS reception acknowledgment message to the mobile PG center 300 (SI 10).<br>
If the authentication fails, the micropayment SMS server 400 transmits an<br>
20 	authentication failure message to the mobile PG center 300 (SI 10-1) such that the authentication failure message can be transmitted to the user terminal 20 via the mobile PG center 300 and the member company server 200. However, the authentication failure message may be directly transmitted to the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user.<br>
25		The authentication process is identically applied to the charge cancellation or<br>
the deposit presentation regardless of the charge cancellation identifier information or the mobile communication terminal number information of the user receiving the deposit.<br>
On the other hand, the mobile PG center receiving the SMS reception<br>
30 	acknowledgment message from the micropayment SMS server 400 checks whether the charge information including the mobile communication terminal number information of the user requesting payment and the member company identification information<br><br>
WO 2006/004277	PCT/KR2005/000907<br>
exist in the charge information database 320 (S1ll).    When the charge information<br>
exists in the charge information database 320, the mobile PG center 300 transmits an<br>
approval message including the mobile communication terminal number information of<br>
the user and the charge amount information to the member company server 200 (SI 12).<br>
5	The member company server 200 receiving the approval message charges a<br>
requested deposit to the deposit account of the user (SI 13), transmits charge result to the user terminal 20 (SI 14), and transmits charge result information ACK to the mobile PG center 300. The mobile PG center 300 transmits the charge result information ACK to the micropayment SMS server 400 (SI 15).<br>
10	The approval message transmitted from the mobile PG center 300 to the<br>
member company server 200 further includes charge cancellation identifier information in case of charge cancellation or mobile communication terminal number information of a user receiving a deposit in case of deposit presentation. The member company server 200 distinguishes the received information and performs the processes of charge,<br>
15     charge cancellation, deposit presentation, respectively.<br>
Next, the micropayment SMS server 400 receiving the charge result information stores the received charge result information in the micropayment particulars database 420 for later bill (SI 16). According to case, the mobile PG center 300 may store the charge result information in the micropayment particulars database<br>
20     330 of the same to manage.<br>
Also, the micropayment SMS server 400 may transmit a short message including the charge result information to the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user for acknowledgment of the user.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flow chart sequentially illustrating the second deposit charge process<br>
25 	of the mobile micropayment service method according to an embodiment of the present invention, in which the user directly transmits a short message to the micropayment SMS server 400 to request deposit charge after deposit charge is performed via the process of FIG. 6.<br>
As illustrated, when a short message whose called number is a certain virtual<br>
30 	caller ID including member company identification information and charge amount information is received from the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user (S201), the micropayment SMS server 400 transmits an SMS reception acknowledgment<br><br>

message including information of the virtual caller ID that is the called number of the short message and number information of the mobile communication terminal 10 transmitting the message to the mobile PG center 300 (S203).<br>
As described above with reference to FIG. 6, in case that predetermined <br>
5      authentication information is included in the short message received from the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user, the micropayment SMS sewer 400 performs authentication process with reference to the user information database 410 (S202), transmits the SMS reception acknowledgment message to the mobile PG center 300 when the authentication is successively performed (S203), and transmits an 10 authentication failure message to the mobile communication terminal <br>
10	 of the user when the authentication fails (S203-1).<br>
Next, the mobile PG center 300 receiving the SMS reception acknowledgment message checks whether the charge information of the member company of the user exists in the charge information database 320 based on the information received from<br>
15	 the micropayment SMS server 400 (S204) and transmits an approval message requesting charging the amount requested by the user to the member company server 200 (S205).<br>
If the charge information of the user does not exist in the charge information<br>
database 320, the mobile PG center 300 transmits an error message including error<br>
20       cause   information   to   the   micropayment   SMS   server   400   (S205-1),   and   the<br>
micropayment SMS server 400 transmits a short failure message including the error<br>
causer information to the mobile communication terminal 10 (S205-2).<br>
Next, the member company server 200 receiving the approval message from the<br>
mobile PG center 300 charges the deposit requested by the user in the deposit account<br>
25       (S206) and transmits charge result information to the mobile PG center 300 (S207).<br>
          The mobile PG center 300 transmits the charge result information received from the<br>
 member company server 200 to the micropayment SMS server 400 (S207).<br>
The   micropayment   SMS   server   400   stores   micropayment   particulars information in the micropayment particulars database 420 according to the charge result <br>
30     	 information (S208)  and  transmits  a  short message  including the  charge  result information to the mobile communication terminal 10 (S209).<br>
On the other hand, in the embodiment, the virtual caller ID is generated by the<br><br>
WO 2006/004277	PCT/KR2005/000907<br>
micropayment SMS server 400.   However, the virtual caller ID may be generated by<br>
the member company server 200 or the mobile PG center 300, and information<br>
transmitted and received between the components may be changed, according to the<br>
generator of the virtual caller ID within the essential points of the present invention.<br>
5	In the embodiment, the process in which a deposit is charged to the deposit<br>
account of the user himself is explained as an example of the mobile micropayment service process. However, the charge cancellation process and the process of presenting a deposit to the deposit account of another user may be simply embodied by changing the information transmitted and received between the each component and the<br>
10 	virtual caller ID. Hereinafter, the processes of charge cancellation and deposit presentation are described with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9 as following.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flow chart sequentially illustrating a process of charge cancellation of the mobile micropayment service method according to an embodiment of the present invention.    A process in which a user directly transmits a short message for charge<br>
15     cancellation to the micropayment SMS server 400 is illustrated as FIG. 7.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 8, when a user transmits a short message using a virtual caller ID including a predetermined identifier, for example, "070" or "*", member company identification information, charge cancellation amount information, and an identifier "*" indicating charge cancellation via the mobile communication terminal 10<br>
20	 of the user (S301), the micropayment SMS server 400 analyzes the viitual caller ID and transmits an SMS reception acknowledgment message including mobile communication terminal number information, the member company identification information, the charge cancellation amount information, and the identifier information to the mobile PG center 300 (S302).<br>
25	In case that predetermined authentication information is included in the short<br>
message received from the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user, as described in the description of FIG. 6, the micropayment SMS server 400 may perform authentication process based on the user information database 410 before the SMS reception acknowledgment message is transmitted to the mobile PG center 300.   The<br>
30     authentication process is not illustrated.<br>
Next, the mobile PG center300 receiving the SMS reception acknowledgment message checks whether charge information with respect to the member company of the<br><br>
WO 2006/004277<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000907<br><br>
28-<br>
user exists in the charge information database 320 based on the information received<br>
from the micropayment SMS server 400 (S303) and transmits an approval message,<br>
requesting charge cancellation with respect to the amount requested by the user,<br>
including the mobile communication terminal number information, the charge<br>
5	 cancellation amount information, and the identifier information indicating the charge<br>
cancellation to the member company server 200 (S304).	'<br>
In this case, the checked charge information includes the mobile communication terminal number information, the member company identification information,  and  the  charge  cancellation information without the  identifier  "'",<br>
10 	indicating the charge cancellation. If the charge information stored in the charge information database 320 of the mobile PG center 300 according to the charge request of the user exists, the charge cancellation may be performed. According to case, as described in the description of FIG. 6, the charge cancellation via transmitting a short message may be performed only when the user requests charge cancellation via the<br>
15 	member company server 200 and information with respect to the charge cancellation is stored in the charge information database 320 of the mobile PG center 300.<br>
On the other hand, when the charge information of the user does not exist in the charge information database 320, the mobile PG center 300 transmits an error message including error causer information to the micropayment SMS server 400 (S304-1).<br>
20 	The micropayment SMS server 400 transmits a short failure message including the error cause information to the mobile communication terminal 10 (S304-2).<br>
Next, the member company server 200 receiving the approval message from the mobile PG center 300 checks a deposit account of the user according to the information included in the approval message and checks whether deposit charge cancellation is<br>
25 	possible based on the balance of the deposit and the term with respect to deposit charge cancellation (S305).<br>
After the checking, in case that the cancellation of the charge of the deposit is possible, the member company server 200 performs the charge cancellation of the deposit charged in the deposit account of the user (S306) and transmits charge<br>
30 	cancellation result information to the mobile PG center 300. The mobile PG center 300 transmits the charge cancellation result information received from the member company server 200 to the micropayment SMS server 400 (S307).<br><br>
WO 2006/004277	PCT/KR2005/000907<br>
		If the deposit whose charge cancellation is requested by the user is already used<br>
or the charge cancellation term expires, the member company server 200 transmits a<br>
deposit charge cancellation failure message including the failure cause information to<br>
the micropayment SMS server 400 via the mobile PG center 300 (S306-1).<br>
5	Next, the micropayment SMS server 400 corrects or deletes the micropayment<br>
particulars information stored in the micropayment particulars database 420 according to the charge cancellation result information (S308) and transmits a short message including the charge cancellation result information that is micropayment cancellation particulars information to the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user (S309).<br>
10	Finally, FIG. 9 is a flow chart sequentially illustrating a deposit presentation<br>
charge process of the mobile micropayment service method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the process, a user presents a deposit to the deposit account of another user by transmitting a short message.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 9, when a user transmits a short message using a virtual<br>
15	 caller ID including predetermined identifier "070" or "*", member company identification information, information of charge amount for present, and mobile communication terminal number information of another user receiving a deposit (charge MIN), via the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user (S401), the micropayment SMS server 400 analyzes the virtual caller ID and transmits an SMS reception<br>
20	acknowledgment message including number information of the mobile communication terminal transmitting the message, the member company identification information, the information of the charge amount for present, and the mobile communication terminal number information of the another user receiving the deposit to the mobile PG center 300 (S402).<br>
25	When predetermined  authentication information  is  included  in the short<br>
message received from the mobile communication terminal 10 of the user, as described in the description of FIG. 6, the micropayment SMS server 400 may perform an authentication process based on the user information database 410 before the SMS reception acknowledgment message is transmitted to the mobile PG center 300.   The<br>
30     authentication process is not illustrated.<br>
Next, the mobile PG center300 receiving the SMS reception acknowledgment message checks whether charge information with respect to the member company of the<br><br>
WO 2006/004277<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000907<br><br>
user exists in the charge information database 320 based on the information received from the micropayment SMS server 400 (S403) and transmits an approval message, requesting that the amount requested by the user is charged in the deposit account of the another user, including the mobile communication terminal number information, the<br>
 5 	information of the charge amount for present, and the mobile communication terminal number information of the user receiving the deposit to the member company server 200 (S404).<br>
In this case, since the mobile communication terminal number information of the user receiving the deposit is not concerned with the payment process, the checked<br>
10 	charge information includes the number information of the mobile communication terminal transmitting the message, that is, requesting payment, the member company identification information, and the information of the charge amount for present except the mobile communication terminal number information of the another user receiving the deposit.    In case that the charge information including the mobile communication<br>
15	 terminal number information of the user, the member company identification information, and the charge amount information stored in the charge information database 320 of the mobile PG center 300 exists, the deposit may be charged as a present regardless of the information of the user receiving the deposit.<br>
In case that the charge information of the user does not exist in the charge<br>
20	 information database 320, the mobile PG center 300 transmits an error message including error cause information to the micropayment SMS server 400 (S404-1). The micropayment SMS server 400 transmits a short failure message including the error cause information to the mobile communication terminal 10 (S404-2).<br>
Next, the member company server 200 receiving the approval message from the<br>
25	 mobile PG center 300 charges the deposit to the deposit account of the user receiving the deposit according to the information included in the approval message, in which the number information of the mobile communication terminal requesting the payment, the information of the charge amount for present, and the mobile communication terminal number information of the user receiving the deposit are included (S405).<br>
30	Next, the member company server 200 transmits the present charge result<br>
information to the mobile PG center 300, and the mobile PG center 300 transmits the charge result information received from the member company server 200 to the<br><br>
WO 2006/004277<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000907<br><br><br>
micropayment SMS server 400 (S406).<br>
The   micropayment   SMS   server   400   stores   micropayment   particulars<br>
information in the micropayment particulars database 420 according to the charge result<br>
information (S407) and transmits a short message including the present charge result<br>
5  	information,   that   is,   micropayment   particulars    information,   to   the   mobile<br>
        communication terminal 10 of the user (S408).<br>
On the other hand, in the embodiment of the present invention, a virtual caller ID is generated by a micropayment SMS server. However, a member company server or a mobile PG center may directly generates the virtual caller ID.    When the virtual<br>
10 	caller ID is generated by the member company server, the member company server generates the virtual caller ID and notifies a user and the mobile PG center, thereby mobile micropayment is started to perform. The process of the mobile micropayment may be changed according to generator of the virtual caller ID therein without departing from the essential points of the present invention<br>
15	The identifier information composing the virtual caller ID in the embodiment<br>
such as "070" or "*" may be replaced by various numbers or letters. The form of the virtual caller ID may be variously changed therein including the information for the mobile micropayment, in addition to a simple combination of identification information, member company identification information, and charge amount information.<br>
20	Also, in the embodiment, when micropayment is requested by a user, a mobile<br>
PG center checks charge information including member company identification information, mobile communication terminal number information of the user, and charge amount information and performs the micropayment. However, the mobile communication terminal number information of the user and the member company<br>
25 	identification information are checked, thereby performing the charge: in case that past charge amount is not the same as the amount that is presently charged.<br>
In this case, a user may transmit a short message using a virtual caller ID 070-1234-5000 in which a number indicating charge amount is corrected from a virtual caller ID 070-1234-3000 previously acquired to charge desired amount.    When a<br>
30 	deposit is presented to another user, a short message is transmitted using a virtual caller ID 070-1234-3000-0177890414 in which mobile communication terminal number information of the another user is added or corrected, to present the deposit.<br><br>
WO 2006/004277	PCT/KR2005/000907<br>
