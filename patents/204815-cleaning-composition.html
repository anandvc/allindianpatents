COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
 CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following specification  particularly describes  the  nature  of the invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
20-1-2004<br><br>
Technical field:<br>
T"he invention relates to a cleaning/washing composition comprising a non-toxic and safe system of immiscible liquids with high interfacial tension which does not require the use of additional detergency benefit agents, and to an improved process/method of cleaning/washing fabric using the same.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Conventionally, fabric is cleaned using water and a detergent surfactant system which is known as wet cleaning. Surfactants adsorb on both fabric and soil and thereby reduce the respective interfacial energies and this facilitates removal of soil from the fabric. Alternatively, it is done by a process called dry cleaning where in organic solvents such as perchloroethylene (PCE), petroleum based or Stoddard solvents, chlorofluoro carbon (CFC)-113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane are used, all of which are generally aided by a surfactant. The organic solvent helps in the removal of oily soil in the presence of detergents. Soil removal can be achieved by a small reduction in interfacial tension. The particulate soil is largely removed by providing agitation.<br>
The organic solvents used for cleaning are generally toxic and also pose a problem as they are inflammable, creating potential fire hazards. Another major concern in solvent cleaning is the tendency of vapour loss from the cleaning system into the atmosphere especially when they are used at elevated temperatures. Solvent cleaning processes generally employ chlorinated solvents that are linked to ozone depletion. Several attempts have been made to avoid these problems and to find suitable substitutes.<br>
WO-A-0036206 (3M) discloses dry cleaning compositions comprising hydrofluoroethers along with other co-solvents, and water present in an amount of less than 1% by weight of the composition. Hydrofluoroethers are relatively safe and less aggressive towards fabric.<br>
2<br><br>
US-A-6228826 (MiCell Tech.Inc.,) discloses the use of end-functionalized polysiloxane surfactants to enhance the dry-cleaning aspects of carbon dioxide which was earlier considered as an alternative to the potentially toxic halocarbon solvents.<br>
Regardless of the type of solvent used, which may be water or organic, agitation of garments in the cleaning medium is essential to accelerate the removal of the soluble soil or the insoluble, particulate soil. During dry cleaning when a surfactant is used, a maximum of about 10% of water is also used along with the solvent system in order to facilitate the removal of water soluble stains.<br>
Our earlier-filed co-pending application 469/mum/2000 dated 23/5/2000, equivalent to WO-A-01/90474, published on 29 November 2001, discloses a process of cleaning fabric using the liquid-liquid interface of at least two immiscible liquid phases with an interfacial tension greater than 5mN/m, under agitation. Even in this method of cleaning the solvents "used could be toxic, inflammable and have an impact on the environment. In our co-pending application No.1000/MUM/2001 dated 12/10/2001 it is described and claimed that a cleaning composition comprising an immiscible liquid system having at least one liquid-liquid interface with an interfacial tension greater than 5mN/m, the less polar solvent in the system being a silicon with more than 3 SiO units, characterized in that the composition comprises from 0.001-20% of one or more benefit agents which are soluble in at least one of the phases of the liquid system.<br>
In our co-pending application No. 1001/MUM/2001 dated 12/10/2001 it is described and claimed that a cleaning composition comprising an immiscible liquid system having at least one liquid-liquid interface with an interfacial tension greater than 5 mN/m, characterised in that the composition has a pH of above 7.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
It has now been found that if in the above-mentioned immiscible liquid phase the less polar solvent has a carbon chain length of at least 4 or is a silicone with more than 3 SiO units the above mentioned problems of toxicity, flammability and environmental impact<br>
3<br><br>
can be circumvented whilst retaining superior cleaning of fabric. The system comprising the immiscible liquid phase is superior to pure solvent cleaning in terms of the detergency benefit.especially for particulate soil. Preferably the carbon chain length is greater than 6.<br>
Brief description of the invention :<br>
The applicants have found that efficient removal of both soluble and insoluble soils may be achieved by the cleaning of fabric under agitation using a washing/cleaning system comprising a liquid liquid interface of at least two immiscible liquid phases with an interfacial tension greater than 5mN/m, wherein the less polar solvent has a carbon<br>
4<br><br>
chain length of at least 4 is a silicone with more than 3_SiO units. It is also found that superior cleaning may be achieved economically by the use of water as a major component along with the organic solvent with the use of little or no surfactant contrary to prior art which teaches use of water at levels not exceeding 10% together with the use of surfactants.<br>
The applicants have developed a system with at least one immiscible phase and with high interfacial tension which provides superior cleaning.<br>

The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to immiscible liquid compositions for cleaning fabric.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
Carbon soot N220, Carbot, (15 mg) was added to a 5 mg solution of sodium dodecyl sulphate in 100 ml of de-ionised water and the mixture dispersed evenly by     sonication in arTultra-sound bath for a minimum of 1.5 hoursTjA swatch of plain white cotton fabric 10cm xlOcm (Poplin~weave, ex Hindustan Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills, Mumbai) was then dipped into this mixture by hand until the cotton was observed visibly to be wetted completely - (10-20)s. The swatch was then withdrawn from the suspension, allowed to drain naturally and air dry overnight. This process was repeated with a further 2 swatches. The initial reflectance at 460nm (R460*), with contribution from ultra-violet radiation removed, was measured using a Macbeth Colour-eye 7000A reflectometer. The three swatches were placed into a 500 ml conical flask to which 300 ml of water + 0.75grams of detergent (Surf Excel ex-Hindustan Lever Ltd) had been added (2.5 grams per litre as per current consumer habit). The conical flask was agitated at 120rpm for 30 mins at ambient temperature<br>
8<br><br>
using a reciprocating agitator, which facilitates efficient mixing of the liquids. Following washing, the individual swatches were air-dried and the final reflectance values for the swatches at 460nm with contribution from ultra-violet radiation removed, were determined. The change in reflectance AR is determined by subtracting the initial reflectance from the final reflectance and the average change in detergency, together with the standard deviation is presented in Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with the water + detergent wash medium replaced with 300 ml of methoxy nonafluorobutane (tradename HFE 7100, ex-3M). The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with the water + detergent wash medium replaced with 300 ml synthetic aliphatic hydrocarbon (DF-2000, ex-Exxon). The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
Example 4<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with the water + detergent wash medium replaced with 60ml of petroleum ether (from MERC chemicals) + 240 ml of deionised water. The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table!<br>
Example 5<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with the water + detergent wash medium replaced with 60 ml mixture of methoxy nonafluorobutane (tradename HFE 7100, ex-3M) + 240ml of deionised water. The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
9<br><br>
Example 11<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with water + detergent wash medium replaced with 60ml of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester CE12lS'(a mixture of methyl laurate, methyl myristate &amp; methyl stearate, ex-P&amp;G, Malaysia, CA.-84-8) and 240 ml of water. The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
Example 12<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with water + detergent wash medium replaced with 60ml of Fatty Acid Methyl Ester C2170 (a mixture of methyl laurate, &amp; methyl myristate, ex P &amp; G Malaysia, CAS#67762-40-7) and 240 ml of water. The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
Example 13<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with water + detergent wash medium replaced with 60ml of Soya methyl ester (a mainly C18 unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester ex Columbus Foods, USA) and 240 ml of water. The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
Example 14<br>
The procedure outlined in Example 1 was repeated but with water + detergent wash medium replaced with 60ml Palm methyl ester (a methyl laurate; tradename Exceparl ML85 ex-Kao, Japan) and 240 ml of water. The average change in reflectance values for this system is reported in Table 1.<br>
10<br><br><br>
The use of water alone as control gave a AR460* of 4.5.<br>
The data presented in table 1 show that solvents like methoxy nonafluorobutane , synthetic aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acid methyl esters, that are safe, possess low flammability, low environmental toxicity, both in terms of biodegrability and ozone depletion potential, when used in combination with a high polar solvent such as water, gave a significantly higher detergency benefit in comparison to a regular detergent wash or the solvent alone. The benefit was comparable to the solvent: water system consisting of petroleum ether and water where petroleum ether, however, has the disadvantage of being inflammable(flash point 13°C). The combination of these solvents and water are capable of cleaning both particulate and oily soil from the fabric.<br>
