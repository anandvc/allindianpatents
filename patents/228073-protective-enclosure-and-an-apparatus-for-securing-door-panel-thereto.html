PANEL THERETO<br>
Field<br>
The present invention relates to a protective enclosure<br>
and, more particularly, to an enclosure that prevents an<br>
unauthorized operator from prying open the door. This<br>
invention also relates to an apparatus for securing a door<br>
panel thereto.<br>
Background<br>
Enclosures, such as automated teller machines, are well<br>
known in the prior art for protecting valuable items stored<br>
within the interior. The valuable items may include, cash,<br>
checks, jewelry or the like. Unauthorized operators sometimes<br>
attack these enclosures by prying around the enclosure door.<br>
Hence, passive locking mechanisms are used with the<br>
enclosures. Passive locking mechanisms rely on the strength<br>
of the steel or other material to prevent distortion to the<br>
enclosure in the event of prying by the unauthorized operator.<br>
Due to the increased thickness of the steel or other material<br>
used to construct these enclosures, the enclosures are heavier<br>
and have higher associated costs.<br>
A need exists, however, for an enclosure having one or<br>
more active anti-pry apparatuses that prevent an unauthorized<br>
operator from prying open the door panel and thereby obtaining<br>
access to the interior.<br><br>
An aspect of the present application provides for an<br>
apparatus for securing a door panel to a protective enclosure<br>
during prying by an unauthorized operator. The apparatus<br>

used as an automatic teller machine ("ATM") or the like.<br>
Protective enclosure 100 may also be operable to automatically<br>
dispense its contents, such as with an ATM. The exemplary<br>
embodiments described herein secure the contents of protective<br>
enclosure 100, for instance, by preventing an unauthorized<br>
operator from prying open door panel 150. The size and shape<br>
of protective enclosure 100, and the proportions of its<br><br>
respective components, depicted in Fig. 1 are merely<br>
illustrative.<br>
Protective enclosure 100 includes housing structure 190<br>
having back wall panel 110, bottom panel 115, top panel 198<br>
and surrounding sidewall panels 105a, 105b to define an<br>
interior. As can be seen in Fig. 1, housing structure 190 has<br>
an open front area for allowing access into the interior.<br>
Protective enclosure 100 also includes door panel 150 operable<br>
for enclosing the interior of housing structure 190 by being<br>
positioned across the front area to define a closed position.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates door panel 150 in an open position. Door<br>
panel 150 is pivotally attached to housing structure 190 by<br>
hinge member 195. Housing structure 190 and door panel 150 are<br>
not limited to any particular size or shape.<br>
Protective enclosure 100 includes an anti-pry<br>
apparatus along the top and/or bottom of door panel 150<br>
and housing structure 190. In particular, protective<br>
enclosure 100, includes upper horizontal security member 145<br>
and lower horizontal security member 147. Alternatively,<br>
protective enclosure 100 includes either upper horizontal<br>
security member 145 or lower horizontal security<br>
member 147. Upper horizontal security member 145 and<br>
lower horizontal security member 147 can be attached to top<br>
panel 198 and bottom panel 115, respectively, or<br>
top panel 198 and bottom panel 115, and upper horizontal<br>
security member 145 and lower horizontal security<br>
8<br><br>
member 147, respectively, can be constructed as single<br>
components.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, upper horizontal security<br>
member 145 and lower horizontal security member 14 7 include at<br>
least one slot. Figure 1, for instance, illustrates five<br>
slots 140a...l40e in upper horizontal security member 145 and<br>
five slots 185a...l85e in lower horizontal security member 147.<br>
Door panel 150 includes a plurality of corresponding upper<br>
tabs 135a...l35e and a plurality of corresponding lower tabs<br>
180a...l80e. Each of the plurality of upper tabs 135a...135e and<br>
each of the plurality of lower tabs 180a...l80e are operable for<br>
engaging each of the respective upper slots 140a...l40e and each<br>
of the respective lower slots 185a...l85e only when the top and<br>
the bottom of door panel 150 are pried with a prying device.<br>
In normal operation, however, the plurality of upper tabs<br>
135a...l35e and the plurality of lower tabs 180a...l80e are not<br>
engaged with the respective slots. Similar to the upper<br>
horizontal security member 145 and lower horizontal security<br>
member 147, the plurality of upper tabs 135a...l35e and the<br>
plurality of lower tabs 180a...l80e can be attached to door<br>
panel 150 or integrated into door panel 150. The functioning<br>
of the plurality of upper slots 140a...l40e and the plurality of<br>
lower slots 185a...l85e, and the corresponding upper tabs<br>
135a...l35e and corresponding lower tabs 180a...l80e, are<br><br>
described below in more detail with reference, for example, to<br>
Figs. 2 and 6.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present application,<br>
housing structure 190 includes the plurality of upper tabs<br>
135a...l35e and/or the plurality of lower tabs 180a...l80e and<br>
door panel 150 includes the plurality of corresponding upper<br>
slots 140a...l40e and/or the plurality of corresponding lower<br>
slots 185a...l85e, respectively.<br>
Further, the anti-pry apparatus can be located on at<br>
least one side of protective enclosure 100 so that the anti-<br>
pry apparatus prevents door panel 150 from being pried open<br>
from at least one of the sides of door panel 150.<br>
Accordingly, the anti-pry apparatus can be used for preventing<br>
prying attempts at any of four sides of door panel 150.<br>
Protective enclosure 100 also includes an anti-pry<br>
apparatus along the corner where side panel 10 5a meets door<br>
panel 150. Protective enclosure 100 includes inner flange 127<br>
along side wall panel 105a. Inner flange 127 has a plurality<br>
of slots 130a...l30e, each of the plurality of slots 130a...l30e<br>
including an anti-pry notch portion 405 shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Inner flange 127 can be attached to side wall panel 105a or<br>
integrated into side wall panel 105a.<br>
A side portion of door panel 150 has attached thereto<br>
lock bar 155. Lock bar 155 includes a plurality of fingers<br>
120a...l20e, each of the plurality of fingers 120a...l20e operable<br>
10<br><br>
for engaging each of the respective plurality of slots<br>
130a...l30e. Lock bar 155 is movably connected to the side<br>
portion of door panel 150, as shown in Fig. 8. Specifically,<br>
lock bar 155 is operable for sliding up and down the side<br>
portion within the interior of housing structure 190, in<br>
normal operation. The functioning of the plurality of slots<br>
130a...l30e and the plurality of corresponding fingers 120a...l20e<br>
are described below in detail with reference to, for example,<br>
Figs. 3, 4 and 7.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present application,<br>
housing structure 190 includes the plurality of fingers<br>
120a...l20e and lock bar 155 movably attached to door panel 150<br>
includes the plurality of slots 130a...l30e.<br>
Further, the anti-pry apparatus can be located on the<br>
top, the bottom and/or the other side of housing structure 190<br>
and door panel 150 so that the anti-pry apparatus prevents<br>
door panel 150 from being pried open. Accordingly, the anti-<br>
pry apparatus can be used for preventing prying attempts at<br>
any of four sides of door panel 150.<br>
Additionally, protective enclosure includes an anti-pry<br>
apparatus along the corner where door panel 150 meets side<br>
panel 105b, that is, the hinged corner of protective enclosure<br>
100. Door panel 150 includes lock bar 505 having a plurality<br>
of 1-shaped slots 165a...l65d. Lock bar 505 is movably attached<br>
to vertical member 170, vertical member 170 being firmly<br><br>
attached to the side of door panel 150 adjacent hinge member<br>
195. Lock bar 505 is operable for sliding up and down within<br>
the interior of housing structure 190. Housing structure 190<br>
includes a plurality of bolts 160a...l60d protruding from a<br>
front portion of side wall panel 105b into the interior, each<br>
of the plurality of bolts 160a...l60d aligning with the<br>
plurality of respective 1-shaped slots 165a...l65d. The<br>
functioning of the plurality of 1-shaped slots 165a...l65d and<br>
the plurality of corresponding bolts 160a...l60d are described<br>
below in detail with reference to, for example, Figs. 2 and 5.<br>
Lock bar 155 and lock bar 505 are connected to each other<br>
by cross member 175, and latch knob 205 is connected to cross<br>
member 175, as shown in Figs. 1, 8 and 9. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, a portion of latch knob 205 protrudes through door<br>
panel 150. An authorized operator can raise and lower lock<br>
bar 155 and lock bar 505 using latch knob 2 05 connected to<br>
cross member 175. Further, the activation of a door locking<br>
mechanism is controlled by latch knob 205. As described<br>
above, latch knob 2 05 is attached to sliding lock bars, 155,<br>
505 through cross member 175. A deadbolt combination lock is<br>
mounted to lock mounting plate 998 using, for instance, high<br>
strength bolts. To unlock door panel 150, the deadbolt<br>
combination lock is first opened by sliding a deadbolt out of<br>
deadbolt slot 999 located on lock bar 155. Latch knob 205 can<br>
then be lifted thereby lifting cross member 175 and lock bars<br><br>
155, 505. With latch knob 205 in the up position, door panel<br>
150 can be pulled open.<br>
The active anti-pry apparatuses described herein are<br>
operable so that any prying force is used against an<br>
unauthorized operator. When prying door panel 150, the<br>
unauthorized operator is hampered by door panel 150 distorting<br>
and interlocking with features around housing structure 190.<br>
The active anti-pry apparatuses prevent even the slightest<br>
prying attempt by causing the interlocking features between<br>
housing structure 190 and door panel 150 to mate and thereby<br>
preventing door panel 150 from opening.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, protective enclosure 100<br>
prevents an unauthorized operator from prying door panel 150<br>
open from the top edge and/or bottom edge of door panel 150.<br>
Figures 2, 3 and 6, for instance, illustrate the interaction<br>
between the plurality of upper slots 140a...l40e and the<br>
plurality of lower slots 185a...l85e, and the plurality of<br>
corresponding upper tabs 135a...l35e and the plurality of<br>
corresponding lower tabs 180a...l80e, respectively, when door<br>
panel 150 is in the closed position. Figure 6 actually<br>
depicts the interaction between one of the plurality of upper<br>
slots 14Oe and one of the corresponding tabs 135a. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, tab 135 is integrated into door panel<br>
150, as shown in Fig. 6. Alternatively, the plurality of<br>
upper tabs 135a...l35e and/or the plurality of lower tabs<br><br>
180a...l80e can be associated with members, not shown in the<br>
drawings, that are securely attached to door panel 150. Since<br>
each of the slots and respective tabs operate in the same<br>
manner, only one tab and corresponding slot are described<br>
herein.<br>
In normal operation, tab 135a resides above slot 140e by<br>
a distance x so that door panel 150 can be opened and closed<br>
upon demand using latch knob 205 to raise and lower,<br>
respectively, cross member 175. Distance x is not meant to be<br>
limited to any particular distance.<br>
Tab 135a engages slot 140e only when an unauthorized<br>
operator inserts and uses a prying device in spacing 610,<br>
shown in Figs. 2 and 6. Figure 2 also illustrates spacing 210<br>
between the plurality of lower slots 185a...l85e and the<br>
plurality of corresponding lower tabs 180a...l80e.<br>
Specifically, when the unauthorised operator attempts to pry<br>
open door panel 150 above tab 135a or in close proximity to<br>
tab 135a, at least tab 135a is forced downward and makes<br>
contact with elbow 605. Depending on the location of the<br>
prying device along spacing 610, one or more other tabs may<br>
also be engaged with the respective slot(s). As a result of<br>
making contact with elbow 605 and the continuing force applied<br>
by the prying device, tab 135a continues downward and engages<br>
slot 140e. Alternatively, tab 135a resides directly above<br>
slot 140e so that elbow 605 is not included. Thus, door panel<br><br>
150 cannot be pried open since tab 135a engages slot 140e. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the present application, once the<br>
prying attempt is ceased, tab 135a again clears the top of<br>
slot 140e so that door panel 150 can be opened in the proper<br>
manner, for example, by using latch knob 205. Alternatively,<br>
tab 135a remains lodged in slot 140e even after the prying<br>
attempt is ceased.<br>
Similarly, if a prying device is inserted in another<br>
location along spacing 610, or spacing 210, at least one of<br>
the other upper tabs 135a...l35e, or at least one of the other<br>
lower tabs 180a...l80e, engage with the respective one or more<br>
of the upper slots 140a...140e and lower slots 185a...l85e,<br>
respectively. As described above, the tab(s) below or above<br>
the prying device or in close proximity to the prying device<br>
engage with the respective slot(s).<br>
Protective enclosure 100 also prevents an unauthorized<br>
operator from prying open door panel 150 along its side<br>
opposite hinge member 195. This anti-pry apparatus is<br>
described below with reference to, for example, Figs. 3, 4 and<br>
7. Figures 4 and 7, however, depict only one of the plurality<br>
of fingers 120a...l20e, that is, finger 120b, and only one of<br>
the plurality of slots 130a...l30e, that is, corresponding slot<br>
130b. Each of the other fingers 120a...l20e and each of the<br>
other corresponding slots 130a...l30e operate in the same manner<br>
and therefore are not described herein.<br><br>
In normal operation, the plurality of fingers 120a...l20e<br>
engage and disengage the corresponding plurality of slots<br>
130a...l30e to prevent and allow, respectively, entry into the<br>
interior of housing structure 190. In order to prevent entry<br>
into the interior, finger 12 0b of lock bar 155 engages slot<br>
130b along inner flange 127, as shown in Fig. 7. When<br>
engaged, the bottom 710 of finger 120b is lower than the<br>
bottom of slot 130b. Further, lip 705 of finger 120b rests on<br>
the bottom, right side portion of slot 130b. Figure 4<br>
illustrates that finger 120b resides in the bottom, right side<br>
portion of slot 13 0b adjacent anti-pry notch portion 4 05.<br>
Accordingly, door panel 150 cannot be opened due to the bottom<br>
710 of finger 120b being lower than the bottom of slot 130b.<br>
Lock bar 155 having fingers 120a...l20e is operable for<br>
sliding up and down within the interior of housing structure<br>
190, in normal operation, for instance, by using latch knob<br>
205, a portion of which protrudes through door panel 150.<br>
Level 205 is operable for raising and lowering cross member<br>
175 and lock bar 155 attached thereto thereby also raising and<br>
lowering finger 120b. As described herein, latch knob 205 is<br>
also operable for raising and lowering lock bar 505 in<br>
conjunction with lock bar 155 due to the two lock bars being<br>
connected by cross member 175.<br>
In order to open door panel 150, finger 12 0b has to be<br>
disengaged. In particular, latch knob 20 5 is operable so that<br><br>
cross member 175 causes lock bar 155 to raise within the<br>
interior. When the bottom 710 of finger 12 0b clears the<br>
bottom of slot 13 0b, door panel 150 can be opened by the<br>
authorized operator. Conversely, in order to close door panel<br>
150, while finger 120b is in the raised position, door panel<br>
150 is closed so that finger 12 0b is inserted into slot 13 0b.<br>
Thereafter, level 2 05 is operated so to lower finger 120b in<br>
order to engage finger 120b and slot 130b. Lip 705 of finger<br>
120b rests on the bottom, right side portion of slot 13 0b. As<br>
a result, door panel 150 is securely closed.<br>
The anti-pry apparatus including finger 120b operates as<br>
follows when an unauthorized operator attempts to pry open<br>
door panel 150 along that side. The unauthorized operator<br>
inserts a prying device in spacing 1005 between a side of door<br>
panel 15 0 and side panel 105a. Spacing 10 05, and spacings<br>
210, 610, 1010 are illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11. When the<br>
prying device is used, at least one of the plurality of<br>
fingers 120a...l20e is forced into the respective anti-pry notch<br>
portion(s) 405 due to the force of the prying device. For<br>
instance, finger 120b is forced into anti-pry portion 405 of<br>
slot 130b, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. As can be seen in Figs.<br>
4a, 4b and 7, the length (a+b) of anti-pry notch portion 405<br>
is larger than the length (a) of finger 120b by length (b).<br>
Length (b) is less than length (c) of finger 120b.<br>
Alternatively, the length of anti-pry notch portion 405 is the<br><br>
same as length (a) of finger 120b. Due to these dimensions,<br>
finger 120b cannot be disengaged from slot 130b while finger<br>
120b resides in anti-pry notch portion 405. Specifically,<br>
bottom 710 of finger 120b cannot clear the bottom of slot<br>
13 0b. In an exemplary embodiment, when the prying attempt has<br>
ceased, finger 12 0b returns to the bottom right portion of<br>
slot 130b so that door panel 150 can be opened according to<br>
the normal manner of operation, described above.<br>
Alternatively, when the prying attempt has ceased, finger 120b<br>
remains in anti-pry notch portion 405.<br>
Similarly, if an unauthorized operator uses a prying<br>
device in another location along the side of door panel 150<br>
opposite hinge member 195, at least one of the plurality of<br>
other fingers 130a...130b is forced into the respective anti-pry<br>
notch portion(s) 405 of the other slots 130a.,.130e.<br>
Protective enclosure 100 also prevents an unauthorised<br>
operator from prying open door panel 150 along its hinged<br>
side. Door panel 150 includes lock bar 505 having at least<br>
one 1-shaped slot. For instance, a side of door panel 150<br>
includes four 1-shaped slots 165a...165d, as shown and described<br>
in the present application. Lock bar 505 is movably attached<br>
to vertical member 170 that is firmly attached to door panel<br>
150. Lock bar 505 is operable for sliding up and down within<br>
the interior of housing structure 190 in conjunction with lock<br>
bar 155 due to cross member 175 coupling the two lock bars,<br><br>
505, 155. Housing structure 190 includes a plurality of bolts<br>
160a...l60d protruding from a front portion of side wall panel<br>
105b into the interior, each of the plurality of bolts<br>
160a...l60d aligning with the plurality of respective 1-shaped<br>
slots 165a...l65d associated with door panel 150. The<br>
functioning of the plurality of 1-shaped slots 165a...l65d and<br>
the plurality of corresponding bolts 160a...l60d is described<br>
herein with reference to only one of the slots 165c and the<br>
corresponding bolt 160c since each slot and corresponding bolt<br>
operate in the same manner. /<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 1, bolt 160c protrudes into the<br>
interior of housing structure 190. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, bolt 160c has a head portion 510 and a shaft<br>
portion 515 protruding into the interior. The portion of bolt<br>
160c protruding into the interior is shown in Pig. 5b. The<br>
size, shape and type of bolt described and shown in the<br>
present application is merely illustrative. Bolt 160c mates<br>
with 1-shaped slot 165c located on movable lock bar 505.<br>
If door panel 150 is initially in an open position and an<br>
authorized operator wants to close door panel 150, latch knob<br>
2 05 is operated so that cross member 175 raises lock bar 505<br>
and lock bar 150, assuming lock bars 505, 150 are not already<br>
in the proper position. As a result of lock bar 505 raising,<br>
slot 165c also raises so that bolt 160c aligns with the<br>
horizontal portion of 1-shaped slot 165c. Fig. 5a, for<br><br>
example, illustrates 1-shaped slot 165c and, specifically,<br>
depicts that the horizontal portion is wider than the top<br>
vertical portion of 1-shaped slot 165c. The authorized<br>
operator thereafter closes door panel 150 and head portion 510<br>
of bolt 160c passes through slot 165c. In particular, head<br>
portion 510 resides, for instance, in the left side of the<br>
horizontal portion of slot 165c when door panel 150 is closed<br>
but not yet locked. As shown in Fig. 5b, the entire head<br>
portion 510 clears lock bar 505. The distance between the<br>
back of head portion 510 and lock bar 505 is not limited to a<br>
particular amount, for instance, the distance can be greater<br>
than or equal to zero.<br>
In order to lock door panel 150, latch knob 2 05 is<br>
operated so that cross member 175 lowers lock bar 505 and lock<br>
bar 155. As a result of lock bar 505 lowering, slot 165c also<br>
lowers so that shaft portion 515 of bolt 160c slides into the<br>
narrower top vertical portion of 1-shaped slot 165c. When<br>
bolt 160c resides in the narrower top vertical portion of 1-<br>
shaped slot 165c, door panel 150 cannot be opened since the<br>
back of head portion 510 makes contact with lock bar 505.<br>
Accordingly, an unauthorized operator cannot pry open door<br>
panel 150 along side panel 150b by, for instance, using a<br>
prying device in spacing 1010, shown in Fig. 11.<br>
The shape and size of the plurality of 1-shaped slots<br>
165a...l65d is merely exemplary. For example, the vertical<br><br>
portion can be located on the right side of the horizontal<br>
portion resembling a reversed 1-shape. Moreover, shapes other<br>
than 1-shapes can be used as long as such shapes include a<br>
narrower portion. Depending on the shape and location of the<br>
slot(s), the bolt(s) may be in the same location as shown in<br>
the figures or in different location(s) so that the bolt(s)<br>
engage the respective slot (s).<br>
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate exploded isometric views of<br>
door panel 150 of the protective enclosure according to the<br>
present application. In Figs. 8 and 9, the interaction<br>
between and connection of latch knob 205, cross member 175,<br>
lock arms 155, 505, vertical member 170, the plurality of<br>
slots 135a...l35e, 180a...l80e and the plurality of fingers<br>
120a...l20e are shown.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present application,<br>
latch knob 2 05 is operable for lowering lock bar 505 and lock<br>
bar 155 in order to disengage door panel 150 from housing<br>
enclosure 190 and is operable for raising lock bar 505 and<br>
lock bar 155 to engage door panel 150 with housing enclosure<br>
190. As a result, the orientation of the plurality of fingers<br>
120a...120e and the plurality of corresponding slots 130a...l30e,<br>
and the plurality of bolts 160a...l60e and the plurality of<br>
corresponding 1-shaped slots 165a...l65e, shown in the drawings<br>
of the present application are rotated 180 degrees. The anti-<br><br>
pry apparatuses, however, function the same as described<br>
herein.<br>
The embodiments described above are illustrative examples<br>
of the present application and it should not be construed that<br>
the present application is limited to these particular<br>
embodiments. Various changes and modifications may be<br>
effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the<br>
