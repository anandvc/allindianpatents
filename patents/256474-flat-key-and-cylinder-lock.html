				<td>FLAT KEY AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED CYLINDER LOCK<br>
The invention is with regard to a flat key for cylinder locks, whereby at least one of the two lateral surfaces has at least three control grooves and at least one of the control grooves is designed to be deeper than the other control grooves and the two shallow control grooves run approximately parallel and the flat key, if necessary, has other control elements such as notches at the teeth of the key for pin tumblers, control surfaces at the back of the key, longitudinal ribs and grooves in the direction of key insertion and milled slots at the lateral surfaces.<br>
Furthermore, the invention is with regard to a lock for the above-mentioned key, whereby at least one control element with one control that engages with the shallow control groove of the flat key and at least one control element with a control that engages with the deep control groove of the flat key are provided at at least one side of the key channel and approximately parallel to the same and that at least one locking element is provided that can be brought into a release position for rotating the cylindrical core opposite the cylinder casing during corresponding positioning of the control element.<br>
The present invention emanates from a key construction as well as from an associated cylinder lock such as is published in AT 389 559 B. The object of the invention is to increase variation possibilities in the key and to ensure greater locking security. The same effect should also be achieved with regard to the new design of the lock.<br>
The solution to this task is the flat key, in accordance with the invention, primarily characterised in that the two shallow grooves have a larger breadth than the further course of the shallow grooves, starting from the tip of the key up to at<br><br>
least the first control location. The number of variations of the flat key is, thereby, increased considerably.<br>
A feature of the invention is that the inner breadth of the partitions between the shallow grooves of the flat key is the same along the entire key length. The result is that the shallow grooves are broadened upwards and downwards at the control locations with broadened shallow grooves, whereas the distance i.e. the inner breadth of the partition, remains the same between the two shallow grooves.<br>
Mere broadening of the shallow grooves upwards and downwards allows the control elements of the lock with narrow controls to be directed over the partition with the same inner breadth which is necessary in order to be able to direct the narrow controls over the broadened groove away towards the control locations allocated to it while pushing in the key. Another result is that the key in accordance with the invention with broadened, shallow grooves at at least one control location can also be inserted into a lock with a previously established design with continuous narrow controls.<br>
In order to increase the number of variations, it is thus not desirable that the key in accordance with the invention be used to lock a lock whose design is in accordance with prior art. Another feature of the invention, therefore, is that the partition between the grooves with a greater breadth at the control locations is moved by a preferred Vz gradation compared to the design with narrow grooves. This ensures that when using the key in accordance with the invention in an “old” lock in accordance with prior art, the narrow controls at the corresponding control locations deliberately places itself erroneously due to the displaced partitions. Subsequent locking of an “old” lock with a duplicate key in which only the shallow grooves have been broadened in accordance with the invention is thereby rendered impossible.<br><br>
A further feature of the invention is to execute the partition flanks to be continuous at these locations in order to be able to safely guide the narrow controls in the region of the control location of the broader grooves.<br>
Furthermore, the invention is with regard to a lock for the key described above which is characterised in that at least the last of the control elements for gauging the broad grooves of the key, has broader controls whose inner width corresponds to the inner breadth of the partition and that the positioning of the two controls, each by a preferred Vz gradation, is moved in the same direction as that of the key channel's height.<br>
Other features and characteristics of the invention can be derived from the drawings, the description and the claims.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a side view of a section of the flat key in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 illustrates a cross-section of a flat key in accordance with the invention with arranged control and locking elements. Figure 3 illustrates another cross-section of a flat key in accordance with the invention with arranged control and locking elements. Figure 4 illustrates a cross-section of a lock in accordance with the invention, the arrangement of control and locking elements being equivalent to Figure 2. Figure 5 illustrates another cross-section of a lock in accordance with the invention with an arrangement of control and locking elements equivalent to that shown in Figure 3. Figure 6 illustrates a cross-section of a control element with a pin for gauging the deep groove. Figure 7 illustrates a cross-section of a control element with two narrow pins for gauging the shallow control grooves. Figure 8 illustrates a cross-section of a control element with two broad pins for gauging the shallow control grooves.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a side view of a section of the flat key 1 in accordance with the invention, whereby the right side surface 2 is shown in detail in the direction<br><br>
of insertion 5. The teeth of the key 3 as well as the back of the key 4 are provided in the usual manner with notches 6 that are to work together with the pin tumblers of the lock. The key 1 furthermore has another milled slot 22 at the side surface 2.<br>
Similarly, three curved control grooves 7, 8 and 9 are located at the side surfaces 2 of the key 1. Two control grooves 7 and 9 are designed to be relatively shallow whereas control groove 8 projects deeper into the key’s material than the other two. The two more shallow control grooves 7 and 9 essentially run parallel to one another and the deep control groove 8 is basically provided between the two shallow control grooves 7, 9. For a better view, the unobstructed progression of control groove 7 is drawn in with dashes as if control groove 8 were not present. The individual control locations 11, 23 show the position of the pins 21, 27 of the control element 17 when the key 1 is completely inserted. In the example shown here five control elements 17 with narrow pins 21 are provided as well as a control element 17 with broad pins 27 on the side of the key tip 10. The two control grooves 7, 9 of the flat key 1 are broadened corresponding to the control location 23, whereby the inner breadth 25 of the partition 24 remains the same over the entire length of the key.<br>
A flat key 1 that does not have any type of broadening whatsoever in the grooves 7, 9 at the control locations can not be inserted completely into a lock in accordance with the invention.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 each illustrate a cross-section of the flat key 1, in accordance with the invention, whereby the incision at a control location 23 has broadened shallow grooves 7, 9. The deep groove is not illustrated in the subsequent drawings in order to provide a better view. Shown at this point is a control element 17 as well as a locking element 15, both of which are located at the same side as that of the lock. Figure 2 exhibits the control element 17 broad pin<br><br>
27. When using the correct key, the guide grooves 7, 9 at the control location 23 bring the control element 17 to a final position in which the recesses 18, the projections 28 of the locking element 15 can be accepted, whereby the lock is released.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a situation in which the key 1, in accordance with the invention, is inserted into an “old” lock, in accordance with prior art, that has control elements 17 with narrow pins 21. The narrow pins 21 are guided through the partition flanks 26 of the partition 24. This guidance ensures that the control element 17 does not move freely in the broadened control grooves 7, 9. Furthermore, the partition 24 at the control location 23 for the broad pins 27 is designed in such a manner that the narrow pins 21 can be guided to move by 1&gt;4 a gradation. A gradation describes the distance between two neighbouring possible control heights of the pins 21 at a particular control location 11. Since the broad pins 27 are offset by 14 a step to the narrow pins 21, all narrow pins 21 that come to lie against the broad control location 23 for the broad pins 27 are deliberately placed in a wrong manner.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate cross-sections of the lock in accordance with the invention with arrangements that are equivalent to those in Figures 2 and 3. These figures show only one half of the key as well as that of the associated lock. The key 1 is completely inserted into the key channel 19. The control element 17 is moved up and down when inserting the key 1 due to guiding the control grooves 7, 9 in the recess 29 of the cylindrical core 13. The pins 27 of the control element 17 are at the allocated control location 23 when in the final position. If, in the case illustrated in Figure 4, the cylindrical core 13 is now rotated in the casing 12 of the lock, then the locking element 15 is moved out from the locking groove 14 found in the casing, whereby the projections 28 are accepted by the recesses 18 and the lock is thus released.<br><br>
In the case of the lock illustrated in Figure 5, the control element 17 with narrow pins 21 is at the control location 23 of the flat key 1. Through guiding by the partition 24, the control element 17 is placed in the wrong position by V2 a step as a result of which the projections 28 can not be accepted in the recesses 18 so that the locking element 15 projects into the locking groove 14 of the casing and the lock is thus not released.<br>
Figures 6 to 8 each illustrate a cross-section of the three variants of locking elements 16, 17 of the lock in accordance with the invention. The locking element 16 shown in Figure 6 has a pin 20 with which to gauge the deeper control groove 8, as well as recesses 18 for the projections 28 of the locking element 15.<br>
The control element 17 shown in Figure 7 exhibits narrow pins 21 apart from the recesses 18 and these pins 21 have an inner width 30 between one another that corresponds to the inner breadth 25 of the partition 24.<br>
The control element 17 illustrated in Figure 8 has broad pins 27 with which to gauge the shallow control grooves 7, 9 at the broadened control locations 23. With regard to this control element 17 too, the inner width 30 between the pins 27 corresponds to the inner breadth 25 of the partition 24.<br>
When one speaks of the inner breadth 25 of the partition 24 and of the inner width 30 between the pins 21 or 27, it expresses that both sizes change subject to the angle of the partition 24. The inner breadth 25 and width 30 remain the same even though the breadth of the partition 24, measured perpendicular to the partition flanks 26, must vary (refer Figure 1).<br><br>
Displacement of the arrangement of the broad pins 27 by V2 gradation when compared to the arrangement of the narrow pins 21 is preferred but can also be of another measurement.<br>
The present key and lock construction is preferred for a reversible key and the described locking parts for both sides of the key channel are located in the lock. From the above description, it is also understood that a key in accordance with prior art with control grooves that have a continuous, smaller breadth can not be completely inserted into a lock that is designed for a key in accordance with the invention. Thus an erroneous, mutual locking of the various key-lock combinations is rendered impossible.</td>
