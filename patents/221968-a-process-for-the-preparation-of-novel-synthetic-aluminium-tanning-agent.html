				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel synthetic aluminium tanning agent. More particularly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a synthetic organo-aluminum tanning agent without using formaldehyde, which forms an alternative to chrome tanning material. The compound has potential use as a self-tanning agent for hides and skins. It is envisaged to be able to produce fuller leathers with adequate shrinkage temperature for producing leathers with desirable properties. It is also visualized that the white base of the leathers enhances dyeability and acts as dye saver apart from ample production of white leathers.<br>
Conventionally skins/hides are stabilised against microbial degradation by tanning. Chrome tanning has been the most predominant method of tannage for the commercial purpose. The major limitation associated with this is that the chrome tanned leathers are empty in nature and hence need heavy retanning for its final performance. Unlike chamois leather, which is essentially of oil tanned, chrome tanned leather does not provide any lubrication among the fibres. Hence strong fatliquoring becomes mandatory for the desired level of softness. The conventional chrome tanning practices employ basic chromium sulphate salt, a progenitor of several chromium species, having various charges and degree of polymerisation. The kinetic inertness of certain chromium species lends itself to poor exhaustion (50-70%) of chrome tanning salt. Thus the commercial chrome tanning activities<br><br>
release chromium in the range of 2000-5000 ppm. As reported by Bellavere et al (Environmental Technology Letters, 2, 119, 1981), the environmental consequences arising from the discharge of industrial wastewater containing chromium into water bodies are enormous. While Tsou et al (Chemical Research in Toxicology, 10, 962, 1997) have proved that chromium has the ability to cause cancer, Blankenship et al (Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 126, 75, 1994) have even reported cell death as the ultimate result occurred by the influence of chromium. The wide ecological concern as well as economic loss has posed the researchers to look for suitable alternatives for chromium. Several methods have been evolved over the years for better management of chromium in leather industry, as reported by Chandrasekaran (Leather Science, 34, 91, 1987). Among them the development of mineral alternatives to chromium have been gaining momentum.<br>
Aluminum tanning is one of the oldest methods of tanning. An old name 'tawing' has been used for this process, which consists of treating the skin with potassium alum in the form of paste including sodium chloride, egg yolk, flour and water. Aluminum tanned leathers are sensitive to water and heat. Aluminum tanned leather has a shrinkage temperature in the range of 75 -82°C depending on the method of tanning used. Its water resistance is unsatisfactory, since even a wash with the cold water slowly removes aluminium   compounds  from   leather.   Aluminium   being   d°  element,   its<br><br>
complexes are much less stable than those of chromium; and thus their binding to collagen is much weaker. This is the reason why aluminium salts are used in contemporary tanning almost exclusively in combined tannage processes. Generally aluminium tanning is done in floats of zero basicity at high concentrations in the presence of sodium chloride to prevent swelling, because the pH of the float is as low as 2.5 - 3.5. No washing is employed after tanning.<br>
A detailed study of the masking action of organic acids on aluminium sulfate and chloride was done by Simoncini ef a/ (Cuoio Pelli Mat. Cone. 54, 439 &amp; 711, 1978). They have described a tanning method based on the use of aluminium complex containing citric acid or ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid as complexing agent, which gives good results. However, the process requires a pretanning and retanning with vegetable tannins and glutaraldehyde. In a detailed study by Williams-Wynn (Journal of the Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 53, 64, 1969) using various ligands such as formate, acetate, lactate, tartrate and citrate, most stable leathers are obtained with formate, acetate and lactate with shrinkage temperature in the range of 74 - 78°C. If the complexing agent is too strong it will not be displaced by protein carboxyl groups and the skin will remain untanned. Similar conclusions have been drawn by Kuntzel and Rizk (Leder, 13, 101, 1962).<br><br>
Mezey (PhD Thesis, Faculty of Science, Lyon, France, 1925) has studied the tanning effect of aluminum sulphate on unlimed skin at various basicities in the presence and absence of common salt. The absence of salt produces hard and horny translucent skin without leathery feel upon drying, which is due to swelling induced by absorption of sulphuric acid. The presence of a sufficient amount of common salt to repress the swelling effect produces supple and opaque leather. However, on washing it reverts to the swollen unlimed skin condition. Studies on tanning using previously adjusted basic solutions of aluminium sulphate by Chambard and Grall (Bull, assoc. franc, chimistes inds. cuir et doc. sci. et tech. ind. cuir, 10(3), 17, 28, 1948) and Mezey (PhD Thesis, Faculty of Science, Lyon, France, 1925) have proved that the tanning using various basic aluminum sulphate solutions without common salt results in hard and horny untanned skins in spite of higher absorption of tanning bath components. In the presence of salt, opaque and supple leather having better resistance to hydrolysis than the leather, which is obtained by tannage using zero basicity and shrinkage temperature being about 65 rather than 47°C.<br>
Aluminium based tanning agents like Lutan B and ATC - 21 have not found much commercial acceptability because of the ready reversal of aluminium as aluminium hydroxide at pH values in the range of 5.0-6.0. Lipowski (US Patent 4,443,382, 1984) has developed an aluminium salt of aromatic sulfonic acid condensate for retanning applications. However, the polymeric matrix is<br><br>
made using formaldehyde. The most commercial use of aluminium in leather industry until now has been as a dye adjunct. The high cationic potential of Al(lll) makes such salts useful for enhancing the color yield.<br>
It has been reported that polyhydroxy aluminium gels aid the exhaustion of chromium during tanning and function as chrome saver by Ramasami et al (Proceedings of the 22nd LERIG, Madras, 167, 1987). However, the reversibility in binding to leathers has limited the usage of Al(lll) salts as chrome saver. Alutan, an aluminium based synthetic tanning agent, has aluminium in the stabilized form and binds irreversibly to the substrate as reported by Kanthimathi et al (Leather Science, 32, 59, 1985). By using this aluminium syntan as chrome saver, the exhaustion level of chromium improves to about 90% as reported by Rao et al (Proceedings of the XXVth IULTCS congress, Chennai, 295, 1999). However, this syntan was used only as a co-tanning agent along with 4-6% chrome salt. Further, the syntan was based on formaldehyde condensates. Swarna et al (Proceedings of the XXVth IULTCS Congress, Chennai, 322, 1999) has reported about such formaldehyde condensates that the tanned leathers on aging may release free formaldehyde ranging from 1500 to 15000 ppm, which does not meet the tolerable limit of 5-10 ppm of free formaldehyde as accounted by Mark et al (Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Volume 13, John Wiley and Sons, New York:, 3rd Edition, 1978). The tanning potency of phenol-formaldehyde condensates has been reported by Gustavson (The Chemistry<br><br>
of Tanning Processes, Academic press, Volume 2, p. 4, 1956). But the major disadvantages of such polymeric condensates are<br>
a)	the tanned leathers show discoloration<br>
b)	the sulfonic acid groups introduced in the system to give soluble matrix would competitively inhibit the binding of anionic dyes<br>
c)	slow release of formaldehyde from the tanned leathers on aging may pose hazardous environment.<br>
The main pre-requisite for the conventional chrome tanning process, carried out by using either basic chromium sulphate (BCS) or high exhaust chrome tanning salt, has been to pickle the pelt by employing acid and salt in aqueous medium whereby the emanated liquor is loaded with dissolved solids, chlorides and sulphates, leading thereby to the environmental pollution.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel synthetic aluminium tanning agent, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of this present invention is to provide an organo aluminium complex for direct tanning of delimed pelts without the conventional pickling process thereby reducing the total dissolved solids in the effluent.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the preparation of Al(lll) tanning salt in homogenous chemical formulation in<br>
 which Al (iii) binds irreversibly with skin/hide matrix and resists washing even at apH7.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for the preparation of Al(III) tanning salt which when used in tanning gives leathers with shrinkage temperature more than 80°C unlike the conventional aluminum tanned leathers.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a product for the manufacture of white leathers through an eco-friendly application procedure.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a product, which serves as dye saver and efficient chrome saver.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an aluminum based suntan, which offers soft and fuller leathers unlike the conventional chrome tanned leather.<br>

In still another embodiment of the present investigation, the known method reaction mass may be dried using conventional methods such as drum drying and spray drying.<br><br>
The process of the present invention is described below in detail.<br>
An aromatic hydrocarbon having up to 14 carbon atoms, calculated as 0.5 -2.0 moles per mole of aluminium to be used, is sulfonated by known method using 1 to 5 moles sulphuric acid per mole of aluminium for a period of not less than 60 minutes at a temperature in the range 25 - 160°C. An aqueous mixture of 0.001 - 0.05 mole of organic ligand per mole of aluminium is then added to the sulfonated mass along with 0.0001 - 0.001 moles polyfunctional polymer per mole of aluminium at a temperature of 60 - 80°C with continuous stirring whereby the organic matrix is built up. Trivalent aluminium salt is then added to the resulting mixture along with 5-30 moles of water per mole of aluminium while maintaining the temperature in the range of 60 - 80°C. Al(lll) being a d° non-transition element, needs a critical additive that is capable of converting it to a pseudo-transition element by transferring the electrons to 3s, 3p and 3d orbitals. Hence, the reaction is continued for a period of 60 minutes. A critical additive in the range of 0.001 - 0.01 mole per mole of aluminium is sulfonated by known method using 0.001 - 0.01 moles sulphuric acid per mole of aluminium for a period of not less than 3 hours at a temperature in the range 25 - 28°C. The sulfonated critical additive is then added to the reaction mixture. The heating and stirring was continued for another 30 min. after which the completion of the reaction is confirmed by known solublization technique. The resulting mixture is then adjusted to a pH of 2.5 - 3.0 by conventional method. The slurry is dried conventionally at a<br><br>
temperature range of 130 - 260°C to obtain the organo aluminium complex as a white powder.<br>
The novelty and non obviousness of the present development lies in using polyfunctional polymer for providing a polymeric matrix without methylene bridge with suitable critical additive that is capable of anchoring a d° non-transition element, Al(lll), by charge transfer mixing of 3s, 3p and 3d orbitals. The irreversible binding of aluminium to the organic matrix is achieved by using organic ligands in combination with critical additive having ligating sites capable of anchoring trivalent aluminium ion.<br>

A mixture of 0.6 gm poly acrylic acid, 0.05 gm of phthalic acid in 2 ml water was added to the reactor through the dropping funnel. The mixture was stirred for 30 min. maintaining the temperature at 60°C. 136 gms of ammonium<br><br>
aluminium sulfate was added to the above mass along with 100 ml water with vigorous stirring. The temperature of the bath was gradually raised to 70°C and heating continued for 1 hr.<br>
The pre made sulfo salicylic acid was added to the reactor and the heating was continued for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was transferred to a bucket and the pH was adjusted to 3.0 using sodium bicarbonate. The solution was filtered and dried using a spray drier at a temperature of 260°C. The dried product was packed in a plastic container.<br>
This product was used for tanning the delimed goatskins at an offer of 1.5% as AI2O3 on pelt weight. The tanned leathers were aged for one day and the shrinkage temperature of the tanned leather was found to be 85°C, exhibiting 80% exhaustion of aluminium.<br>
The following are the advantages of the present invention:<br>
1.	Cheaper and  indigenously available raw materials are  used for the process of the present invention ensuring its cost effectiveness.<br>
