				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to white-light emitting organogel. Particularly the present invention relates to white-light emitting organogel comprising an oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) derivative of Formula 1 as the donor and a copolymer of phenylenevinylene and pyrrolylenevinylene as the acceptor of Formula 2.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Formula 2     Acceptor<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of white-light emitting organogel comprising an oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) derivative of Formula 1 and a copolymer of phenylenevinylene and pyrrolylenevinylene of Formula 2. Emissions coming from the monomer and aggregates of donor along with the acceptor emission due to the energy transfer from the donor on excitation with UV light cover the entire visible region to give bright white light emission.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
White organic light emitting materials have attracted much current interest because of their potential applications in full color displays with color filters, LEDs, as backlights for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and in various lighting applications. An important component of LCDs is the white light emitter that comprises the back light for the display since liquid crystals (LCs) do not generate light but they may only block it. Typically, LCDs allow 5-25% of the back light to pass through. As a result, LCD technology requires a significant amount of energy, and this is an important<br>
consideration in lightweight laptops or other display designs. An efficient and spectrally broad white light source would constitute an important contribution to LCD technology. Reference may be made to Kido, J. et al. Science 1995, 267, 1332; D'Andrade, B. D., et al. Adv. Mater. 2004, 16, 1585; Sun, Y., et al. Nature 2006, 440, 908. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4758818, 6828951, 6870584, 6876424, 6635903, 6774560.<br>
So far, a variety of strategies have been worked out to realize white light emission. The general approach is to blend two or three fluorescent or phosphorescent dyes into a blue-light emitting polymer or a non-active polymer matrix. Polymer blend systems, such as three-polymer blends containing red- green-, and blue-light-emitting polymers and two-polymer blends containing blue- and orange-light-emitting polymers, have also been demonstrated. Reference may be made to Kawamura, Y. et al. J. Appl. Phys. 2002, 92, 87; Gong, X. ef al. Adv. Mater. 2004, 16, 615; Al Atter, H. A. et al. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2005, 86, 121101; Berggren, M. Nature 1994, 372, 444; Xu, Y. H. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2005, 86, 163 502; Ho, G. K. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2004, 85, 4076. U.S. Pat No. 5966393.<br>
Metal complexes containing Eu, Ir are another class of molecules which are used for white light emission. Reference may be made to Kim, T.-H., et al. Adv. Fund Mater. 2006, 76, 611; Coppo, P., et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 1806.<br>
A few low molecular weight organic molecules emitting white-light is also reported. Reference may be made to Liu, Y., etal. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 5592; Mazzeo, M., et al. Adv. Mater. 2005, 77, 34.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4099089 discloses the use of terbium activated rare earth oxyhalide phosphor material alone or in combination with other suitable phosphor materials at the elevated operating temperatures to generate white light emitting composite materials.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6869695 discloses the fabrication of a white-light emitting OLED by using the combined monomer and aggregated emission. The device employs two emitters in a single emissive region to sufficiently cover the visible spectrum.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above-mentioned white light emitting materials, the process includes highly complicated methods resulting in very high cost.<br>
An alternative and easy method for the production efficient white light emission will be useful for the above-mentioned applications. White light emitting organogels are not reported in literature so far. Organogels are easy to process compared to other methods for the device manufacturing. Gelation allows greater flexibility for coating. U.S. Pat. No. 5415993 discloses the preparation of light-sensitive photo-thermographic emulsion layers containing a thermoreversible organogel based binder.<br>
Organogels are extensively used in the field of medicine and cosmetics. For example U.S. Pat. No. 6914051 discloses a penetrating antibiotic gel for treating pain, inflammation and other pathological conditions affecting musculoskeletal tissues and other soft tissues of the body. The composition includes an antibiotic compound and a mobilizing agent in an amount sufficient to enable the antimicrobial compound to penetrate into the sub-dermal soft tissues. The antimicrobial compound may be a macrolide antibiotic compound such as azithromycin, erythromycin or roxithromycin, and the mobilizing agent may be an organogel compound, such as pluronic lecithin liposomal organogel. U.S. Pat. No. 6687533 discloses a non-implantable CT and MRI marker composed of an organogel. U.S. Pat. No. 5411737 discloses a slow release drug delivery device for the prolonged administration of topically active medicines, which consists of a vehicle in which water is soluble and in which is dissolved the topically active drug which is formed into a stable organogel with a polymer matrix with a very low water absorbing capability. U.S. Pat. No. 6737394 discloses a detergent composition having a surfactant, a thickening agent and an organogel, which is used for cleansing the human body.<br>
Oligo (p-phenylenevinylene) derivatives are known to form self-assembled nanostructures, which results stable organogels in nonpolar solvents at ambient conditions. They are found to act as efficient donor scaffold for excitation energy transfer and light harvesting with suitable energy acceptors. Reference can be made to A. Ajayaghosh et a/., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 5148; A. Ajayaghosh et a/., Chem. Eur. J. 2005, 11, 3217; A. Ajayaghosh et a/., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 7174; A. Ajayaghosh et a/., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 7542.<br>
Formula 1 (R = Ci2H25, R = C16H33) and Formula 2 found to form stable<br>
organogels in aliphatic nonpolar hydrocarbon solvents like decane, hexane, Cyclohexane, methyl Cyclohexane, toluene etc. They emit in the blue region of the visible spectrum in the monomer state, whereas, green emission was observed for the self-assembled species. Reference may be made to A. Ajayaghosh et a/., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 456 and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 6260-6265).<br>
Until now, there has been no disclosure of white light emitting organogels. The challenge is to tailor the organogel in such a way to give broad emission covering the entire region from 400-700 nm with suitable chromaticity for white light emission when suitably excited.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In the present invention, there is provided a white light emitting organogel comprising donor acceptor type fluorescent organic molecules. Cholesterol appended oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) derivatives was used as the donor and a copolymer of<br>
phenylenevinylene and pyrrolylenevinylene with an average molecular weight (Mn) of ~ 4358 g/mol having a poly-dispersity index of 1.12 was the acceptor.<br>
The donor molecules when dissolved in a nonpolar solvent like decane form self-assembled nanostructures, which results the formation of a soft organogels at room temperature. These molecules emits at blue region in the monomer state, whereas it shows green emission in the self-assembled or aggregated state.<br>
Encapsulation of acceptor within the self-assembly of donor was done by adding small amounts of the former in decane to the latter and followed by heating and cooling to form a coassembled self-supporting soft organogel. This coassembly on excitation with 380 nm light results white light emission.<br>
White light emission with CIE co-ordinates of 0.31, 0.35 was observed for the organogel containing 3.2 x 10-4 M of donor and 2.1 mol% of acceptor<br>
This donor-acceptor system is selected in view of their favorable self-assembly; stable Coassembly and suitable absorption and emission properties. The emission of the self-assembled donor is significantly shifted towards the long wavelength side when compared to that of the individual donors. In the self-assembled state, the emission of the donor shows considerable overlap with the absorption of the acceptor (FIG 2) making it suitable for energy transfer. The spectral overlap integral, J(.) for this donor-acceptor system was found to be 4.66 x 1015 M" 1cm~1nm4. At the excitation wavelength of the donor, the acceptor has minimum absorption thus avoiding direct excitation. Encapsulation of acceptor within the self-assembly of donor is achieved by adding small amounts of the former in decane to the latter and followed by heating and cooling to form a coassembled self-supporting soft organogel.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of Formula 1 was achieved as per Scheme 1. It was prepared by refluxing OPV alcohol (1 equivalent) with cholesteryl chloroformate (2.2 equivalents)<br>
in benzene (dry, 20 equivalents) in the presence of pyridine (dry) as the catalyst at 80 °C for 8h. Evaporation of the solvent results in Formula 1 with yield of 86%. The residue was then dissolved in chloroform. It was then precipitated by the addition of methanol and filtered. The crude mixture was then purified to 100% by eluting through a silica column using chloroform-hexane (1:2) mixture and characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.<br>
This fluorophore emits blue light in the monomer state on excitation with UV light. It emits green light in the aggregated or self-assembled or gel state in nonpolar solvent medium, preferably decane, dodecane, hexane, cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane and specifically decane at room temperature, neutral pH and atmospheric pressure.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis of Formula 2 was achieved as per Scheme 2. It was prepared by refluxing a solution of bisaldehyde derivative (1 equivalent) with bisphosphonate (1 equivalent) in presence of NaH (6 equivalents) in THF (Dry, 15 equivalents). After refluxing at 80 °C for 26h, the reaction mixture was cooled and THF was removed under reduced pressure. The resultant residue was then extracted with dichloromethane and washed several times with saturated brine and water. The organic layer dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed. The<br>
product thus obtained purified by repeated precipitation by adding methanol to a dichloromethane solution gave the Formula 2 as dark red solid.<br>
This fluorophore emits red light in decane at room temperature, neutral pH and atmospheric pressure when suitably excited.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 2<br>
Example 3<br>
A coassembled gel was prepared by the encapsulation of 2.1 mol% of acceptor (Formula 2) in 97.9 mol% of the donor (Formula 1) in decane (neutral pH) and followed by heating (60 °C) and cooling (room temperature) at atmospheric pressure. On excitation of the gel with UV light (380 nm), broad emission was seen in the range of 400-700 nm (FIG 3) which contain red, green and blue colors to give bright white light emission (FIG 4). The white light obtained here is a combination of emissions coming from the monomer and aggregates of donor along with the acceptor emission due to the energy transfer from the donor. The chromaticity diagram at this particular composition reveals CIE co-ordinates of 0.31, 0.35 (FIG 5) which are ideal for white light emission.<br>
