				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a neuroprotective pharmaceutical composition. This composition is particularly but not exclusively useful in the treatment of the following diseased conditions.<br>
1.	Primary generalised epilepsy<br>
2.	Schizophrenia<br>
3.	Parkinson"s disease<br>
4.	Multiple sclerosis<br>
5.	Refractory CNS glioblastoma<br>
6.	Syndrome X with vascular disease<br>
7.	Neuronal aging and Dementia of the Alzheimer"s type<br>
8.	Down"s syndrome<br>
9.	Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.<br>
Modem medicines for treatment of these disorders are not satisfactory and are often found to produce undesirable side effects.<br>
Object of this invention is to develop a safe and effective medicine which can be effectively used to ameliorate these disorders with minimum or negligible side effects.<br>
Research work carried by us over a period of years has shown that patients of the disorders/conditions mentioned above show:-<br><br>
1.	Decrease in the activity of a cell membrane bound enzyme known as Na+-K+ ATPase which plays an important role in the transport of cations in and out of cells.<br>
2.	There is increase in the concentration of digoxin in the serum. Digoxin is a sterodial glycoiside, now known to be synthesised by the hypothalamus whose main physiological action is inhibition of Na+-K+<br>
ATPase activity.<br>
3.	The increase in the concentration of digoxin in the serum is associated with decrease in the activity of Na+-K+ ATPase and therefore increased digoxin in these disorders is the cause of the inhibition of this enzyme.<br>
4.	Digoxin is synthesised in the hypothalamus by what is known as the mevalonate or isoprenoid pathway which starts from acetyl CoA and this pathways synthesises a number of substances which include cholesterol, coenzyme Q10 and dolichol in addition to digoxin. A major controlling factor in the operation of this pathway is the activity of an enzyme known as HMG CoA reductase.<br>
5.	An inhibition of cell membrance Na+-K+ ATPase results in an increase in intracellular calcium levels and a decrease in intracellular magneisum concentration.<br><br>
6.	A decrease in serum magnesium has been observed by us in all these disorders.<br>
7.	Various reports suggest that increase in intracellular calcium and decrease in intracellular magnesium are involved in the pathogenesis of the disorders/conditions mentioned above.<br>
We therefore felt that if the digoxin level can be kept low so that the enzyme Na -K ATPase exerts its normal action, it can go a long way in the treatment of these disorders.<br>
Attention was therefore focussed to find agents which can act in this direction. We screened a large number of medicinal plant extracts and various others substances for their effect on-<br>
1.	activity ofmembrane Na+-K+ ATPase.<br>
2.	Activity of HMG CoA reductase, an inhibition of which would decrease digoxin level.<br>
These studies were carried out in experimental animals like rats and those which were found to be effective in stimulating the activity of membrane Na+-K+ ATPase and decreasing the activity of HMG CoA reductase were tested in detail for their systemic toxicity. The following were found to be effective in stimulating Na+-K+ ATPase and inhibiting HMG CoA reductase and which were without any toxic effects even at high doses.<br><br>
1.	Extract/whole powder of curcuma longa rhizomes (Haldi or turmeric).<br>
2.	Extracy/whole power of Azaradicta Indica leaves (neem).<br>
3.	Extract/whole powder of Emblica Officinalis (Amla fruit).<br>
4.	Extract/whole powder of the stem of Tinospora Cordifolia baric (Amruta).<br>
5.	Magnesium oxide.<br>
6.	Taurine.<br>
7.	Tyrosine.<br>
8.	Laurie acid.<br>
Each of these substances has a stimulatory effect on Na+-K+ ATpase and a inhibitory effect on HMG CoA reductase.   However these effects<br>
vere significantly more when all of these were used in combination.<br>
Method of preparation of dried solvent extract for formulation:<br>
Fresh or dry material in each case was extracted with 90% methanol and the extract was concentrated in vacuum to remove mose of the methanol. The concentrate was then extracted with n-hexane and the aqueous layer was concentrated and dried at low temperature in a lyopbiliser to obtain a powder.<br>
Preparation of the powder of the whole material:<br>
The material was sun dried and powdered to get powder of 100-200 micron size.<br><br>
Preparation of the fonnulation:<br>
The following formulation in the	concentration mentioned was<br>
made.<br>
Cone.<br>
1.	dry extract of Curcuma Longa - A	250 mg<br>
2.	dry extract of Azardicta Indica - B	250 mg<br>
3.	dry extract of Emblica Officinalis - C	250 mg<br>
4.	dry extract of Tinospora Cordifoiia - D	250 mg<br>
5.	Magnesium oxide (IP grade )-E	1000 mg<br>
6.	Tyrosine (LP. grade )- F	500 mg<br>
7.	Taurine (IP - grade) - G	100 gm<br>
8.	Laurie acid (IP grade)-H.	250 mg<br>
Components A, B,C &amp; D (1 to 4) were mixed to form part I and components E,F,G &amp; H ( 5 to 8) were mixed separately to form Part II.<br>
The clinical trials, details below in example I were carried out with this fonnulation.<br>
However the range of concentration of the various components   which showed effect is given below.<br>
50 mg to lOOOmg in the case of dry extracts of A, B, C and D.<br>
250 mg to 2gm of Magnesium oxide.<br>
100 mg to 10(X)mg of tyrosine<br>
25 mg to 500 mg of taurine.<br>
25 mg to 1 gm of lauric acid.<br><br>
It is to be noted that at least one of the extracts selected from Curcuma Longa and Azaridicta Indica must be present in combination with the substances of non-plant origin. A combination of components represented under 1 to 8 or A to H is found to exhibit maximum potency whereas a combination of 1,3 and 4 or 2,3 and 4 with components of 5-8 also are found efifective. A combination of either 1(A) alone with 5-8 or 2 (B) alone with components 5-8 is also effective. Significant effect is also observed for a combination of 1 to 4 with 5 alone. A combination 1 and 5 or 2 and 5 is also effective.<br>
This invention relates to a neuroprotective pharmaceutical composition comprising Curcuma Longa rhizomes, and/or Azardicta Indica leaves and/or at least one plant material selected from Emblica Officinalis fruits and Tinospora cordifolia bark in combination with Magnesium oxide, and/or Taurine, Tyrosine and lauric acid.<br>
The extracts of the plant material may be prepared with methanol or any other polar solvent and apart from hexane, any other non-polar solvent can also be used for the extraction of the concentrate. The extracts can also be aqueous extracts of the plant material, made by boiling with water and concentration of the extract to dryness.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1 Clinical Trials:<br>
We carried out clinical trials with this formulation in patients with 1. Primary generalised epilelsy<br>
2.	Schizophrenia<br>
