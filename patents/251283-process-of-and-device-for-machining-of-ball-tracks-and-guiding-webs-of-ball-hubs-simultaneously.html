Process of and device for machining ball hubs<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to processes of and devices for machin-<br>
ing the inner joint parts of constant velocity universal ball<br>
joints, which inner joint parts are also referred to as ball<br>
hubs. Such inner joint parts have a longitudinal axis A and<br>
comprise at least one guiding face by means of which the inner<br>
joint part is continuously angularly movably guided relative<br>
to the ball cage. On said guiding face there is positioned a<br>
plurality of circumferentially distributed ball tracks which<br>
divide the guiding face into a corresponding plurality of<br>
guiding webs. Torque transmitting balls of the constant veloc-<br>
ity universal ball joint can be longitudinally displaceably<br>
held in the ball tracks. As is generally known, constant ve-<br>
locity universal ball joints of this type comprise an outer<br>
joint part with first ball tracks, a ball cage holding a plu-<br>
rality of balls, as well as the inner joint part which is re-<br>
ferred to here and which has second ball tracks (not explained<br>
in greater detail below). More particularly, but not exclu-<br>
sively, the inner joint parts of the above-described type are<br>
suitable for constant velocity universal ball joints which<br>
are referred to by the applicant as AC (angular contact), UF<br>
(undercut free), DO (double offset), HAI (high angle inboard)<br>
and TBJ (twin ball joint) joints. These designations have<br>
largely developed into standard terms referring to species.<br><br>
2<br>
When producing prior art inner joint parts it is already known<br>
to subject the workpieces in a common clamping device first to<br>
machining operations on the individual ball tracks and subse-<br>
quently to machining operations on the guiding webs. When ma-<br>
chining the ball tracks, the ball hub is held in position and<br>
by means of rotating tools, the ball tracks are machined track<br>
by track in a chip-forming way. More particularly, the already<br>
hardened tracks are ground. Thereafter, the ball hub, in a ro-<br>
tatingly driven condition, is finish-turned (on outer diame-<br>
ter) and then form-ground.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to further rational-<br>
ise the process of producing ball hubs of said type and to<br>
provide devices for carrying out said process.<br>
A first solution consists in providing a process of machining<br>
the inner joint parts of constant velocity universal joints,<br>
which inner joint parts have a longitudinal axis A and com-<br>
prise at least one guiding face by means of which the inner<br>
joint part is continuously angularly movably guided in a the<br>
ball cage, and which comprises a plurality of ball tracks<br>
which are distributed around the circumference of the guiding<br>
face, which divide the guiding face into a corresponding plu-<br>
rality of guiding webs and in which the torque transmitting<br>
balls can be held so as to be longitudinally displaceable,<br>
which inner joint part is characterised in that at least one<br>
ball track and at least one guiding web are machined in a<br>
chip-forming way simultaneously.<br>
With set-up times which are as advantageous as those used so<br>
far, i.e. by using a clamping device, the inventive process is<br>
suitable for shortening the machining times and for considera-<br>
bly reducing the down-times of the individual tools. Said<br>
chip-forming machining operation can comprise both milling<br><br>
3<br>
processes and grinding processes as well a combination of the<br>
two. With a given output the investment costs are reduced con-<br>
siderably by the inventive process.<br>
More particularly while adhering to the further embodiments<br>
mentioned below, it is possible to achieve quality improve-<br>
ments, i.e. that in the case of uneven numbers of ball tracks<br>
and guiding webs, one ball track and one radially opposed gui-<br>
ding web are machined simultaneously and that in the case of<br>
even numbers of ball tracks and guiding webs, one ball track<br>
and one guiding web adjoining the radially opposed ball track<br>
are machined simultaneously. In this way, either no<br>
transverse forces or only low transverse forces are applied to<br>
the clamping device for the workpiece, so that the tracks and<br>
guiding webs can be produced with a higher degree of preci-<br>
sion. Because the rotating tools used are form tools, tracks<br>
of any cross-section can be produced.<br>
Production can be increased further in that two ball tracks<br>
and two faces are machined simultaneously or that at least two<br>
- more particularly two ball tracks positioned in planes ex-<br>
tending parallel relative to one another - are simultaneously<br>
machined in the longitudinal direction synchronously and,<br>
with one or two guiding webs being machined at least par-<br>
tially simultaneously thereto.<br>
According to a second solution which substantially has the<br>
same advantages as the above-described solution, there is pro-<br>
posed a process of machining inner joint parts of constant<br>
velocity universal ball joints , which inner joint parts have<br>
a longitudinal axis and comprise at least one guiding face by<br>
means of which the inner joint part is continuously angularly<br>
movably guided in a the ball cage, and which comprises a plu-<br>
rality of ball tracks which are distributed around the circum-<br><br>
4<br>
ference of the guiding face, which divide the guiding face in-<br>
to a corresponding plurality of guiding webs and in which the<br>
torque transmitting balls can be held so as to be longitu-<br>
dinally displaceable, wherein at least two ball tracks are ma-<br>
chined simultaneously in a chip-forming way in the longitudi-<br>
nal direction.<br>
Finally, according to a third solution which also has the same<br>
advantages as described above, there is proposed a process of<br>
machining inner joint parts of constant velocity universal<br>
ball joints , which inner joint parts have a longitudinal axis<br>
and comprise at least one guiding face by means of which the<br>
inner joint part is continuously angularly movably guided in a<br>
ball cage, and which comprises a plurality of ball tracks<br>
which are distributed around the circumference of the guiding<br>
face, which divide the guiding face into a corresponding plu-<br>
rality of guiding webs and in which the torque transmitting<br>
balls can be held so as to be longitudinally displaceable,<br>
wherein at least two guiding tracks are machined simultane-<br>
ously in a chip-forming way in the longitudinal direction.<br>
With the processes mentioned here it is also possible to<br>
achieve an improvement in quality in that with uneven numbers<br>
of ball tracks and guiding webs, a first ball track or web<br>
face and the second ball track or guiding web adjoining the<br>
radially opposed partial face or ball track are machined si-<br>
multaneously and that with even numbers of ball tracks and<br>
guiding webs, two radially opposed ball tracks or guiding webs<br>
are machined simultaneously. In this case, too, the forces<br>
acting on the workpiece can be largely balanced, so that the<br>
transverse forces and bearing load at the clamping device are<br>
reduced, with the production accuracy being increased.<br><br>
5<br>
According to a preferred process which will be explained in<br>
more detail with reference to the drawings, the ball tracks<br>
are machined by rotating tools whose axes of rotation inter-<br>
sect the longitudinal axis of the inner joint part perpendicu-<br>
larly and whose centre is guided in radial planes which, rela-<br>
tive to the inner joint part, extend through the longitudinal<br>
axis.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible for the ball tracks to be ma-<br>
chined by rotating tools whose axes of rotation are aligned<br>
substantially radially relative to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the inner joint part, wherein the axis of rotation, rela-<br>
tively, is guided in radial planes extending through the lon-<br>
gitudinal axis of the inner joint part.<br>
With reference to the production of the guiding webs it is<br>
proposed that the guiding webs are machined by rotating tools<br>
whose axis of rotation intersects the longitudinal axis of the<br>
inner joint part perpendicularly and whose centre, relative to<br>
the inner joint part, is guided in radial planes which extend<br>
through the longitudinal axis of the inner joint part because<br>
in view of the hollow shape of the tool face, only disc tools<br>
can be used and not finger tools. In order to make it possible<br>
for several guiding webs to be machined by one tool without<br>
having to rotate the clamped-in workpiece, it is proposed ac-<br>
cording to a further supplementary process that the guiding<br>
webs are machined by rotating tools, whose centre, relative to<br>
the inner joint part, additionally carries out pivot movements<br>
around its longitudinal axis.<br>
In accordance with the initially mentioned objective, the in-<br>
vention furthermore, according to a first proposal, comprises<br>
a device for machining inner joint parts of constant velocity<br>
universal ball joints , which inner joint parts have a longi-<br><br>
6<br>
tudinal axis and comprise at least one guiding face by means<br>
of which the inner joint part is continuously angularly mova-<br>
bly guided in a ball cage, and which comprises a plurality of<br>
ball tracks which are distributed around the circumference of<br>
the guiding face, which divide the guiding face into a corre-<br>
sponding plurality of guiding webs and in which the torque<br>
transmitting balls can be held so as to be longitudinally dis-<br>
placeable, wherein said device comprises a clamping device for<br>
the inner joint part and at least two rotating tools for si-<br>
multaneously machining at least one ball track and at least<br>
one guiding web in the longitudinal direction.<br>
According to a second solution variant which substantially<br>
leads to the same results, the invention comprises a device of<br>
the above-mentioned species which is characterised in that it<br>
comprises a clamping device for an inner joint part and at le-<br>
ast two rotating tools for simultaneously machining at least<br>
two ball tracks in the longitudinal direction.<br>
According to a further solution variant which also leads to<br>
said advantageous results, there is proposed a device which is<br>
characterised in that it comprises a clamping device for an<br>
inner joint part and at least two rotating tools for simulta-<br>
neously machining at least two guiding webs in the longitudi-<br>
nal direction.<br>
Due to the fact that it is possible to machine simultaneously<br>
a plurality of functional faces of the inventive inner joint<br>
part, productivity is improved with existing investment costs.<br>
The device can be particularly simple in design and cost-<br>
effective if the clamping device for an inner joint part com-<br>
prises feeding means at least for feeding the workpiece in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the inner joint part and if the at<br>
least two rotating tools comprise feeding means to ensure<br><br>
7<br>
feeding in the radial direction only relative to the longitu-<br>
dinal axis of the inner joint part. In addition it is proposed<br>
that the clamping device additionally comprises adjusting<br>
means for rotatingly adjusting the clamping device around the<br>
longitudinal axis of the inner joint part. More particularly,<br>
the clamping device is able to clamp in the inner joint part<br>
axially.<br>
After the rotating tools have been returned radially out-<br>
wardly, the workpiece can be rotated in its clamping device by<br>
the pitch angle of the ball tracks and the next synchronous<br>
machining operation for two functional faces can be repeated<br>
with the workpiece being fed in entirely axially and with the<br>
rotating tools being moved forward entirely radially. It is<br>
also possible to provide alternative adjusting means for ro-<br>
tatingly adjusting the rotating tools around the longitudinal<br>
axis of the inner joint part.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the axes of rotation of all rotat-<br>
ing tools participating simultaneously in the machining opera-<br>
tion are positioned in one plane.<br>
According to a further embodiment it is proposed that the axes<br>
of rotation of the rotating tools are positioned in at least<br>
two planes extending parallel relative to one another, wherein<br>
especially the tools for dressing the guiding webs are posi-<br>
tioned in a second common plane. In this way, it is possible,<br>
with simple means, to use further tools, with the clamping de-<br>
vice remaining unchanged. It would not be possible for such<br>
further tools to be accommodated in an annular assembly in one<br>
plane with reference to the longitudinal axis of the work-<br>
piece .<br><br>
8<br>
As already indicated, the rotating tools for the ball tracks<br>
can be disc tools whose axes of rotation intersect the longi-<br>
tudinal axis of the inner joint part at a distance. However,<br>
the rotating tools for the ball tracks can also be finger<br>
tools which axes of rotation are arranged substantially ra-<br>
dially relative to the longitudinal axis of the inner joint<br>
part. As far as the rotating tools for the web faces are con-<br>
cerned, these have to be provided in the form of disc tools.<br>

ventive devices are contained in the drawings and will be de-<br>

Figure la shows the inventive process of machining an inner<br>
joint part 11 of a constant velocity universal joint according<br>
to a first solution. The inner joint parts of constant veloc-<br>
ity universal joints are often also referred to as ball hubs.<br>
The longitudinal axis of the inner joint part 11 has been gi-<br>
ven the reference symbol A and, below, will repeatedly be used<br>
with reference to the arrangement and to the movements of the<br>
tools used. The inner joint part 11 is shown to comprise six<br>
circumferentially distributed ball tracks 12 which, in the<br>
longitudinal direction, comprise a substantially uniform<br>
cross-section and which are shown here as approximately semi-<br>
circular round tracks. The ball tracks 12 are separated from<br>
one another by web faces 13 which are partial faces of an ima-<br>
ginary partially spherical guiding face of the inner joint<br>
part by means of which the inner joint part 11 is guided so as<br>
to be articulatable relative to a ball cage. It is common<br>
practice for said guiding face to be a disc portion of a ball.<br>
However, the guiding face can also be interrupted by a central<br>
over-turning, so that, as an imaginary guiding face, it forms<br>
two axially spaced ball discs between which there is posi-<br>
tioned a non-guiding intermediate portion. At the guiding webs<br>
13 and at the delimiting edges of the ball tracks 12 it is<br>
possible to identify chamfers 14, 15 which are irrelevant for<br>
the inventive production process. The inner joint part 11 com-<br>
prises a through-aperture 16 which extends coaxially relative<br>
to the longitudinal axis A and comprises inner shaft teeth 17<br><br>
10<br>
which are provided for inserting a drive shaft journal. There<br>
are provided a first rotating tool 21 constituting a form tool<br>
for rotatingly machining the ball tracks 12 as well as a sec-<br>
ond rotating tool 31 constituting a rotating form tool for ma-<br>
chining the guiding webs 13, which rotating tools 21, 31, in<br>
accordance with the invention, engage the inner joint part si-<br>
multaneously. The axis of rotation of the tools 21 has been<br>
given the reference symbol R21 and the axis of rotation of the<br>
tool 31 has been given the reference symbol R31. The two axes<br>
X21 and X31 which intersect the longitudinal axis A in the same<br>
point and whose significance will be referred to in connection<br>
with the following figure each extend perpendicularly relative<br>
to the direction of the longitudinal axis A. An arch-shaped<br>
arrow P shown in dash-dotted lines indicates the possibility<br>
of adjusting the tools 21, 31 relative to the inner joint part<br>
11, with the centre of movement being positioned on the longi-<br>
tudinal axis A. However, said possibility of movement consti-<br>
tutes one option only. Alternatively, a holding element for<br>
the inner joint part 11 can be designed so as to be rotatingly<br>
adjustable.<br>
Figures lb, lc show the process and the device according to<br>
Figure la in an angled longitudinal section through the axis A<br>
and the axes X21, X31. The inner joint part 11 is shown to com-<br>
prise an aperture 16 which extends coaxially relative to the<br>
longitudinal axis A and comprises inner teeth 17. One of the<br>
ball tracks 12 is shown to engage the rotating tool 21. One of<br>
the web faces 13 is shown to engage the rotating tool 31. The<br>
movement of the tools 21, 31 relative to the inner joint part<br>
11 is such that the inner joint part 11 is moved entirely axi-<br>
ally on the clamping axis Z in the direction of the double ar-<br>
row Z11, whereas the rotating tools 21, 31 are each moved en-<br>
tirely in the direction of the double arrows X12, X113 along the<br>
axes X21, X31. The axes X21, X31 are positioned in a common plane<br><br>
11<br>
which extends radially relative to the clamping axis Z; ac-<br>
cording to Figure lb they coincide and according to Figure lc<br>
they are offset in parallel relative to one another. In order<br>
to change over to machining a further ball track and a further<br>
web face after a ball track 12 and a web face 13 have been<br>
fully machined simultaneously, the tools 21, 31 can be moved<br>
out of the engagement with the inner joint part 11 radially<br>
relative to the clamping axis Z, and the inner joint part 11<br>
can be rotated around the clamping axis Z by a pitch angle of<br>
the ball tracks 12. The necessary types of movement and con-<br>
trol of the device are thus the rotation of the clamping de-<br>
vice and the displacement of the clamping device in direction<br>
Z as well as an entirely axial displacement of the axes of<br>
rotation  R21, R31 along the radial axes X21, X31.<br>
Figure 1d shows a process and a device similar to those shown<br>
in Figure la for a deviating inner joint part 11 in an angled<br>
longitudinal section through the axis A and the axes X21, X31.<br>
The inner joint part 11 is axially clamped into a two-part<br>
clamping device 18. The inner joint part 11 can be seen to<br>
comprise a through-aperture 16 extending coaxially relative to<br>
the longitudinal axis A. One of the straight ball tracks 12<br>
engages the rotating tool 21. One of the web faces 13 engages<br>
the rotating tool 31. The path of the tools 21, 13 relative to<br>
the inner joint part 11 has been indicated by dash-dotted li-<br>
nes. The actual movement, however, is such that the inner<br>
joint part 11 is moved on the clamping axis Z entirely axially<br>
in the direction of the double arrow Z11 whereas the rotational<br>
tools 21, 13 are moved entirely in the direction of the double<br>
arrows X12, X13 along the axes X21, X31, the former operation be-<br>
ing only for setting purposes and the latter operation taking<br>
place during the entire process. The axes X21, X31 are posi-<br>
tioned in a common plane extending radially relative to the<br>
clamping axis Z. In order to change over to machining a fur-<br><br>
12<br>
ther ball track and a further web face after a ball track 12<br>
and a web face 13 have been fully machined simultaneously, the<br>
tools 21, 31 can be moved out of the engagement with the inner<br>
joint part 11 radially relative to the clamping axis Z, and<br>
the inner joint part 11 can be rotated around the clamping<br>
axis Z by a pitch angle of the ball tracks 12. The necessary<br>
types of movement and control of the device are thus the rota-<br>
tion of the clamping device 18 and the displacement of the<br>
clamping device 18 in direction Z as well as an entirely ra-<br>
dial displacement of the axes of rotation R21, R31 along the<br>
radial axes X21, X31.<br>
As can be seen in Figure la, it is advantageous if, for the<br>
purpose of balancing the forces, the two tools 21, 31 are ar-<br>
ranged largely radially opposite one another. With the even<br>
number of ball tracks 12 shown here, it is necessary to devi-<br>
ate from said ideal by half a pitch angle of the ball tracks.<br>
If the chip-forming machining process requires several succes-<br>
sive stages such as milling and grinding, further sets of<br>
pairs of tools can be arranged in planes extending parallel to<br>
the drawing plane of Figure la, so that the inner joint part<br>
11, without having to be re-clamped and while using the en-<br>
tirely axial feeding facilities can be fed to the further<br>
set(s) of tools. These sets of tools, too, require only one<br>
axial feeding facility in the radial direction with reference<br>
to the clamping axis Z.<br>
Figure 2 shows a modified and further embodiment of the proc-<br>
ess illustrated in Figure 1, again in an axial view of the<br>
longitudinal axis A of the inner joint part 11 analogously to<br>
Figure la. Identical details have been given the same refer-<br>
ence numbers as in Figure 1, so that reference is made to the<br>
description of same. In addition to the rotating tool 21 for<br><br>
13<br>
the ball track 12, there is shown a deviating second tool 22<br>
for a ball track 12' positioned radially opposite. Further-<br>
more, in addition to the tool 31 for the web region 13, there<br>
is illustrated a further identical tool 32 for a web 13' posi-<br>
tioned radially opposite. The axes X21, X31 form a 90° angle, so<br>
that at the inner joint part 11, during the chip-forming ma-<br>
chining operation, the forces are largely balanced with refer-<br>
ence to the clamping axis Z, i.e. in contrast to the embodi-<br>
ment according to Figure 1, no resulting forces act on the<br>
clamping axis Z. In this case, the device is preferably de-<br>
signed in such a way that the inner joint part 11 is displace-<br>
able along the clamping axis Z and, for the purpose of chang-<br>
ing between the individual machining operations, it can be ro-<br>
tated around the clamping axis, whereas the tools 21, 22, 31,<br>
32 can only be moved in the direction of the individual axes<br>
X21, X22, X31, X32.<br>
Figure 3 shows the inventive machining process according to a<br>
third solution, again illustrating an inner joint part 11 in<br>
an axial view of the longitudinal axis A. Identical details<br>
have been given the same reference numbers as in the preceding<br>
figures, so that reference is made to the description of same.<br>
In accordance with the invention, two ball tracks 12, 12' are<br>
subjected to a chip-forming machining operation simultaneously<br>
by two rotating tools 21, 22 which correspond to those shown<br>
in Figure 2 and, in the same way, engage radially opposed ball<br>
tracks. In this case, too, an axial feeding operation takes<br>
place along the longitudinal axis A of the inner joint part 11<br>
along the clamping axis Z and, in addition, the inner joint<br>
part 11 is rotatable around the axis Z by the track pitch an-<br>
gle (a). In contrast hereto, the axes of the rotatingly driven<br>
tools 21, 22 can move in the direction of the double arrows<br>
X12, X12' in the radial direction relative to the clamping axis<br>
Z. Their axes of movement X21, X22 are positioned in a common<br><br>
14<br>
plane, i.e. more particularly on a common straight line. In<br>
accordance with the arrow P' shown in dash-dotted lines, it is<br>
possible, in this case, too, to allow the tools 21, 22 to be<br>
adjustable relative to the inner joint part 11 around the cen-<br>
tre of movement A.<br>
Figure 4 shows an inventive machining process according to a<br>
fourth solution, again showing the inner joint part 11 in an<br>
axial view of the longitudinal axis. Identical details have<br>
been given the same reference numbers as the preceding fig-<br>
ures, so that reference is made to the description of same. In<br>
accordance with the invention, two web regions 13, 13' are ma-<br>
chined simultaneously by two rotating tools 31', 32 which cor-<br>
respond to those shown in Figure 2 and which, in the same way,<br>
engage radially opposed ball tracks. In this case, too, the<br>
longitudinal axis A of the inner joint part is fed forward<br>
along the clamping axis Z, and, in addition, the inner joint<br>
part is rotatable around the axis Z by the track pitch angle<br>
(a). On the other hand, the rotatingly driven tools 31', 32<br>
can move their axes only in the direction of the double arrows<br>
X13, X13' in the radial direction relative to the clamping axis<br>
Z. Their axes of movement X32', X32 are positioned in a common<br>
plane, i.e. more particularly on a common straight line. In<br>
accordance with the dash-dotted arrow P", this case, too, al-<br>
lows the tools 31', 32 to be adjustable relative to the inner<br>
joint part 11 around the centre of movement A.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further embodiment of an inventive process,<br>
wherein the inner joint part 11 comprises ball tracks 12]., 122<br>
which extend in pairs arranged in parallel relative to one an-<br>
other and which form first wider web regions 131 positioned be-<br>
tween two pairs and second narrower web regions 132 positioned<br>
between the two tracks 121, 122 of a pair. In this case, the<br>
tracks 121, 122 of a pair are machined by two rotating tools 23,<br><br>
15<br>
24 which comprise a common axis of rotation R23 and are rotat-<br>
ingly drivably held in a common holding device 25. The holding<br>
device 25 and thus the tools 23, 24 move radially relative to<br>
the longitudinal axis A of the inner joint part and to the<br>
clamping axis Z in the direction of the radial ray X23. The web<br>
regions 131, 132 are each machined by a rotating tool 33 which<br>
comprises an axis of rotation R33 and is rotatingly drivably<br>
received in a holding device 34. The holding device 34 and<br>
thus also the tool 33 again move radially relative to the lon-<br>
gitudinal axis A of the inner joint part 11 and thus to the<br>
clamping axis in the direction of the radial ray X33. In this<br>
case, too, the axes R32, R33 are preferably positioned in a com-<br>
mon plane. A dash-dotted arrow P"' indicates that the holding<br>
device 34 is additionally adjustable relative to the holding<br>
device 25 so that the holding device 34 can be adjusted from<br>
machining the web region 131 (as illustrated) to machining the<br>
web region 132 around the centre of movement A without there<br>
being a need to rotate the workpiece around the clamping axis.<br>
Only after the operation of machining two web regions 131, 132,<br>
which takes place at least partially simultaneously with the<br>
machining of the tracks 121, 122, has been completed, is the<br>
workpiece 11 rotated around its clamping axis by the pitch an-<br>
gle between the pairs of tracks, i.e. in this case by 90°. The<br>
holding device 34 is pivoted back into its starting position.<br>
Alternatively, with the workpiece 11 being held in a fixed po-<br>
sition, it is possible for both holding devices 25, 34 to be<br>
adjusted jointly relative to the fixed workpiece 11 around the<br>
centre of movement A.<br>
Modifications of the above-described process are possible, for<br>
example by additionally providing two tools for simultaneously<br>
machining two web regions, but which two tools have to com-<br>
prise different axes of rotation.<br><br>
