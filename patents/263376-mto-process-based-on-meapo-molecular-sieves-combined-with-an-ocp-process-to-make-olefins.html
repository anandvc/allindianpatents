				<td>MTO PROCESS BASED ON MEAPO MOLECULAR SIEVES COMBINED<br>
WITH AN OCP PROCESS TO MAKE OLEFINS<br>
[Field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an MTO (methanol to olefins) process<br>
based on MeAPO molecular sieves combined with an OCP (olefins cracking<br>
process) process to make olefins. More precisely the MTO process is based on<br>
a metalloaluminophosphate (MeAPO) molecular sieve catalyst with lamellar<br>
crystal morphology. The limited supply and increasing cost of crude oil has<br>
prompted the search for alternative processes for producing hydrocarbon<br>
products. One such process is the conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons and<br>
especially light olefins. The interest in the methanol to olefin (MTO) process is<br>
based on the fact that methanol can be obtained from coal or natural gas by the<br>
production of synthesis gas which is then processed to produce methanol. The<br>
MTO process produces light olefins such as ethylene and propylene as well as<br>
heavy hydrocarbons such as butenes and above. These heavy hydrocarbons<br>
are cracked in an OCP process to give mainly ethylene and propylene.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
The MTO process has been described in US 2006 0235251, WO 2005<br>
016856, US 2006 0063956, US 2006 0161035, US 6207872, US 2005<br>
0096214, US 6953767 and US 7067095.<br>
Ethylene and propylene are particularly desirable olefins but it has been<br>
found that their yields in the MTO process are reduced by the production of<br>
medium weight hydrocarbons such as C4, C5 and C6 olefins, as well as some<br>
heavier components. Methods are needed to alter the product distribution in the<br>
MTO process for making light olefins to provide processing flexibility. Methods<br>
are sought to reduce the production of C4, C5 and higher olefins from the MTO<br>
process relative to the production of ethylene and propylene. Therefore an OCP<br>
process is combined with the MTO process to crack the C4, C5 and higher<br>
olefins from the MTO process. Such yield improvements of ethylene and<br>
propylene significantly improve the economies of the methanol to olefins<br>
process.<br>
W01999 018055 relates to a method for increasing light olefin yield<br>
during conversion of oxygenates to olefins comprising: contacting an oxygenate<br>
feed in a first reactor (MTO reactor) with a non-zeolitic molecular sieve catalyst<br>
under first conditions effective to produce a first product comprising light olefins<br>
and a heavy hydrocarbon fraction; separating said light olefins from said heavy<br>
hydrocarbon fraction; feeding said heavy hydrocarbon fraction to a second<br>
reactor; and subjecting said heavy hydrocarbon fraction in said second reactor<br>
to second conditions effective to convert at least a portion of said heavy<br>
hydrocarbons to light olefins. Suitable SAPO's for use in the MTO reactor<br>
include SAPO-11, SAPO-44, SAPO-34, SAPO-17, and SAPO-18. A preferred<br>
zeolite for the auxiliary reactor is ZSM-5.<br>
US 2004 0102667 relates to a process for the production of light olefins<br>
from an oxygenate-containing feed stream. This invention more particularly<br>
refers to a process for increasing yields of light olefins through cracking of<br>
heavier olefins produced in a methanol to olefins process.<br>
It has been discovered that, in a combined MTO OCP process, the use<br>
of a specific catalyst in the MTO reactor leads to very high yields in propylene.<br>

In a third preferred embodiment TEMP/AI2O3 = 0.7-2 ; MeO2/Al2O3 =<br>
0.05-0.6; P2O5/AI2O3= 0.8-1.2 and TIA/AI2O3= 6-20.<br>
With regards to the TIA, mention may be made, by way of example, of<br>
1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol,<br>
butanol, glycerol or ethylene glycol.<br>
With regards to the organic templating agent, it can be any of those<br>
heretofore proposed for use in the synthesis of conventional zeolitic<br>
aluminosilicates and microporous aluminophosphates. In general these<br>
compounds contain elements of Group VA of the Periodic Table of Elements,<br>
particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, preferably N or P and<br>
most preferably N, which compounds also contain at least one alkyl or aryl<br>
group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred nitrogen-<br>
containing compounds for use as templating agents are the amines and<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, the latter being represented generally by<br>
the formula R4N+ wherein each R is an alkyl or aryl group containing from 1 to 8<br>
carbon atoms. Polymeric quaternary ammonium salts such as<br>
[(C14H32N2)(OH)2]x wherein "x" has a value of at least 2 are also suitably<br>
employed. Both mono-, di and tri-amines are advantageously utilized, either<br>
alone or in combination with a quaternary ammonium compound or other<br>
templating compound. Representative templating agents include<br>
tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, tetrapropylammonium or<br>
tetrabutylammonium cations; di-n-propylamine, tripropylamine, triethylamine;<br>
diethylamine, triethanolamine; piperidine; morpholine; cyclohexylamine; 2-<br>
methylpyridine;           N.N-dimethylbenzylamine;           N,N-diethylethanolamine;<br>
dicyclohexylamine;            N,N-dimethylethanolamine;           choline;           N,N'-<br>
dimethylpiperazine; 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane; N-methyldiethanolamine, N-<br>
methylethanolamine;          N-methylpiperidine;          3-methylpiperidine;          N-<br>
methylcyclohexylamine; 3-methylpyridine; 4-methylpyridine; quinuclidine; N,N'-<br>
dimethyl-1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane ion; di-n-butylamine, neopentylamine; di-<br>
n-pentylamine; isopropylamine; t-butylamine; ethylenediamine; pyrrolidine; and<br>
2-imidazolidone. Advantageously organic templating agent is selected among<br>
tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH), diisopropylethylamine (DPEA),<br>
tetraethyl ammonium salts, cyclopentylamine, aminomethyl cyclohexane,<br>
piperidine, triethylamine, diethylamine, cyclohexylamine, triethyl<br>
hydroxyethylamine, morpholine, dipropylamine, pyridine, isopropylamine di-n-<br>
propylamine, tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide, diisopropylamine, di-n-<br>
propylamine, n- butylethylamine, di-n-butylamine, and di-n-pentylamine and<br>
combinations thereof. Preferably the template, is a tetraethyl ammonium<br>
compound selected from the group of tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide<br>
(TEAOH), tetraethyl ammonium phosphate, tetraethyl ammonium fluoride,<br>
tetraethyl ammonium bromide, tetraethyl ammonium chloride, tetraethyl<br>
ammonium acetate. Most preferably, the template is tetraethyl ammonium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
With regards to the reactive inorganic source of MeO2 essentially<br>
insoluble in the TIA and relating to silicon, non-limiting examples of useful<br>
inorganic silicon source materials non-soluble in alcohols include, fumed silica,<br>
aerosol, pyrogenic silica, precipitated silica and silica gel.<br>
With regards to the reactive sources of AI2O3 , it can be any aluminum<br>
species capable of being dispersed or dissolved in an aqueous synthesis<br>
solution. Useful sources of alumina are one or more sources selected from the<br>
group consisting of the following: hydrated alumina, organo alumina, in<br>
particularly AI(OiPr)3, pseudo-boehmite, aluminum hydroxide, colloidal alumina,<br>
aluminium halides, aluminium carboxylates, aluminium sulfates and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
With regards to the reactive sources of P2O5 , it can be one or more<br>
sources selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid; organic<br>
phosphates, such as triethyl phosphate, tetraethyl-ammonium phosphate;<br>
aluminophosphates; and mixtures thereof. The phosphorous source should also<br>
be capable of being dispersed or dissolved in an alcohol synthesis solution.<br>
These MeAPO can be prepared by the usual methods of the molecular<br>
sieves synthesis technology provided it is in accordance with  the above cited<br>
ratios. The reaction mixture is in the form of a gel. The ratios MeO2/Al2O3 and<br>
P2O5/AI2O3 are selected among the above described advantageous and<br>
preferred ratios and are in accordance with the advantageous and preferred y, z<br>
and k described above. By way of example to make a MeAPO having the y, z<br>
and k according to the second preferred embodiment one has to use the ratios<br>
of the ingredients according to the second preferred embodiment of the method<br>
to make said MeAPO.<br>
With regards to the step b), the reaction mixture obtained by mixing the<br>
reactive sources of alumina, MeO2, phosphorus, organic templating agent and<br>
TIA is submitted to autogenous pressure and elevated temperature. The<br>
reaction mixture is heated up to the crystallization temperature that may range<br>
from about 120°C. to 250°C., preferably from 130°C. to 225°C, most preferably<br>
from 150°C. to 200°C. Heating up to the crystallization temperature is typically<br>
carried for a period of time ranging from about 0.5 to about 16 hours, preferably<br>
from about 1 to 12 hours, most preferably from about 2 to 9 hours. The<br>
temperature may be increased stepwise or continuously. However, continuous<br>
heating is preferred. The reaction mixture may be kept static or agitated by<br>
means of tumbling or stirring the reaction vessel during hydrothermal treatment.<br>
Preferably, the reaction mixture is tumbled or stirred, most preferably stirred.<br>
The temperature is then maintained at the crystallization temperature for a<br>
period of time ranging from 2 to 200 hours. Heat and agitation is applied for a<br>
period of time effective to form crystalline product. In a specific embodiment, the<br>
reaction mixture is kept at the crystallization temperature for a period of from 16<br>
to 96 hours.<br>
With regards to the step c), the usual means can be used. Typically, the<br>
crystalline molecular sieve product is formed as a slurry and can be recovered<br>
by standard means, such as by sedimentation, centrifugation or filtration.<br>
With regards to the step d), the separated molecular sieve product is<br>
washed, recovered by sedimentation, centrifugation or filtration and dried.<br>
With regards to the step e), calcination of molecular sieves is known per<br>
se. As a result of the molecular sieve crystallization process, the recovered<br>
molecular sieve contains within its pores at least a portion of the template used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, activation is performed in such a manner that the<br>
template is removed from the molecular sieve, leaving active catalytic sites with<br>
the microporous channels of the molecular sieve open for contact with a<br>
feedstock. The activation process is typically accomplished by calcining, or<br>
essentially heating the molecular sieve comprising the template at a<br>
temperature of from 200 to 800° C in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas.<br>
In some cases, it may be desirable to heat the molecular sieve in an<br>
environment having a low oxygen concentration. This type of process can be<br>
used for partial or complete removal of the template from the intracrystalline<br>
pore system.<br>
Additionally, if during the synthesis alkaline or alkaline earth metals have<br>
been used, the molecular sieve might be subjected to an ion-exchange step.<br>
Conventionally, ion-exchange is done in aqueous solutions using ammonium<br>
salts or inorganic acids.<br>
With regards to the MTO process in the primary reactor, typically, the<br>
oxygenate feedstock is contacted with the catalyst when the oxygenate is in<br>
vapor phase. Alternately, the process may be carried out in a liquid or a mixed<br>
vapor/liquid phase. In this oxygenate conversion process, olefins can generally<br>
be produced at a wide range of temperatures. An effective operating<br>
temperature range can be from about 200° C. to 700° C. At the lower end of the<br>
temperature range, the formation of the desired olefin products may become<br>
markedly slow. At the upper end of the temperature range, the process may not<br>
form an optimum amount of product. An operating temperature of at least 300°<br>
C, and up to 575° C. is preferred.<br>
The pressure also may vary over a wide range. Preferred pressures are<br>
in the range of about 5 kPa to about 5 MPa, with the most preferred range being<br>
of from about 50 kPa to about 0.5 MPa. The foregoing pressures refer to the<br>
partial pressure of the oxygenate compounds and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
The process can be carried out any system using a variety of transport<br>
beds, although a fixed bed or moving bed system could be used.<br>
Advantageously a fluidized bed is used. It is particularly desirable to operate the<br>
reaction process at high space velocities. The process can be conducted in a<br>
single reaction zone or a number of reaction zones arranged in series or in<br>
parallel. Any standard commercial scale reactor system can be used, for<br>
example fixed bed, fluidised bed or moving bed systems. The commercial scale<br>
reactor systems can be operated at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of<br>
from 0.1 hr-1to1000hr-1.<br>
One or more inert diluents may be present in the feedstock, for example,<br>
in an amount of from 1 to 95 molar percent, based on the total number of moles<br>
of all feed and diluent components fed to the reaction zone. Typical diluents<br>
include, but are not necessarily limited to helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, paraffins, alkanes (especially<br>
methane, ethane, and propane), aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The preferred diluents are water and nitrogen. Water can be injected in either<br>
liquid or vapour form.<br>
The oxygenate feedstock is any feedstock containing a molecule or any<br>
chemical having at least an oxygen atom and capable, in the presence of the<br>
above MeAPO catalyst, to be converted to olefin products. The oxygenate<br>
feedstock comprises at least one organic compound which contains at least one<br>
oxygen atom, such as aliphatic alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds<br>
(aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonates, esters and the like).<br>
Representative oxygenates include but are not necessarily limited to lower<br>
straight and branched chain aliphatic alcohols and their unsaturated<br>
counterparts. Examples of suitable oxygenate compounds include, but are not<br>
limited to: methanol; ethanol; n-propanol; isopropanol; C4-C20 alcohols; methyl<br>
ethyl ether; dimethyl ether; diethyl ether; di-isopropyl ether; formaldehyde;<br>
dimethyl carbonate; dimethyl ketone; acetic acid; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Representative oxygenates include lower straight chain or branched aliphatic<br>
alcohols, their unsaturated counterparts. Analogously to these oxygenates,<br>
compounds containing sulphur or halides may be used. Examples of suitable<br>
compounds include methyl mercaptan; dimethyl sulfide;; ethyl mercaptan; di-<br>
ethyl sulfide; ethyl monochloride; methyl monochloride, methyl dichloriden-alkyl<br>
halides, n-alkyl sulfides having n-alkyl groups of comprising the range of from<br>
about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof. Preferred oxygenate<br>
compounds are methanol, dimethyl ether, or a mixture thereof. The most<br>
preferred oxygenate compound is methanol.<br>
With regards to the primary reactor effluent, "light olefins" means<br>
ethylene and propylene and the "heavy hydrocarbon fraction" is defined herein<br>
as the fraction containing hydrocarbons having a molecular weight greater than<br>
propane, which means hydrocarbons having 4 carbon atoms or more and<br>
written as C4+. It is desirable to have a 100% conversion of the oxygenate in the<br>
primary reactor.  This  conversion  rate is adjusted  by optimization  of the<br>
regeneration of the catalyst. Typically in the effluent, and not taking account of<br>
the diluent or the unconverted oxygenate, composition by weight % (the total<br>
being 100%) on carbon basis is as follows :<br>
olefins range from 80 to 98,<br>
paraffins (comprising methane) range from 2 to 20,<br>
dienes range from 0.1 to 0.5,<br>
aromatics are less than 0.5.<br>
Among the olefins, on a 100% basis, the light olefins are from 60 to 95%<br>
for respectively 5 to 40% of olefins with 4 carbon atoms or more. Among the<br>
light olefins the weight ratio propylene/ethylene is higher than 1.1 and<br>
advantageously around 1.1-1.3.<br>
Among the olefins having 4 carbon atoms or more there are 65 to 85<br>
weight % of butenes. More than 85% by weight and advantageously more than<br>
95% of the hydrocarbons having 4 carbon atoms or more are C4 to C8 olefins.<br>
With regards to the OCP process in the second reactor, said process<br>
is known per se. It has been described in EP 1036133, EP 1035915, EP<br>
1036134, EP 1036135, EP 1036136, EP 1036138, EP 1036137, EP 1036139,<br>
EP 1194502, EP 1190015, EP 1194500 and EP 1363983 the content of which<br>
are incorporated in the present invention.<br>
The heavy hydrocarbon fraction produced in the primary reactor (MTO) is<br>
converted in the second reactor, also called an "olefin cracking reactor" or OCP<br>
herein, to produce additional amounts of ethylene and propylene.<br>
Advantageously the catalysts found to produce this conversion comprise a<br>
crystalline silicate of the MFI family which may be a zeolite, a silicalite or any<br>
other silicate in that family or the MEL family which may be a zeolite or any<br>
other silicate in that family. Examples of MFI silicates are ZSM-5 and silicalite.<br>
An example of an MEL zeolite is ZSM-11 which is known in the art. Other<br>
examples are Boralite D and silicalite-2 as described by the International Zeolite<br>
Association ( Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types, 1987, Butterworths). The<br>
preferred crystalline silicates have pores or channels defined by ten oxygen<br>
rings and a high silicon/aluminum atomic ratio.<br>
Crystalline silicates are microporous crystalline inorganic polymers based<br>
on a framework of XO4 tetrahydra linked to each other by sharing of oxygen<br>
ions, where X may be trivalent (e.g. Al, B,. ..) or tetravalent (e.g. Ge, Si, . . .).<br>
The crystal structure of a crystalline silicate is defined by the specific order in<br>
which a network of tetrahedral units are linked together. The size of the<br>
crystalline silicate pore openings is determined by the number of tetrahedral<br>
units, or, alternatively, oxygen atoms, required to form the pores and the nature<br>
of the cations that are present in the pores. They possess a unique combination<br>
of the following properties: high internal surface area; uniform pores with one or<br>
more discrete sizes; ion exchangeability; good thermal stability; and ability to<br>
adsorb organic compounds. Since the pores of these crystalline silicates are<br>
similar in size to many organic molecules of practical interest, they control the<br>
ingress and egress of reactants and products, resulting in particular selectivity<br>
in catalytic reactions. Crystalline silicates with the MFI structure possess a bi-<br>
directional intersecting pore system with the following pore diameters: a straight<br>
channel along [010]: 0.53-0.56 nm and a sinusoidal channel along [100]: 0.51-<br>
0.55 nm. Crystalline silicates with the MEL structure possess a bi-directional<br>
intersecting straight pore system with straight channels along [100] having pore<br>
diameters of 0.53-0.54 nm.<br>
The crystalline silicate catalyst has structural and chemical properties<br>
and is employed under particular reaction conditions whereby the catalytic<br>
cracking of the C4+ olefins readily proceeds. Different reaction pathways can<br>
occur on the catalyst. Under the process conditions, having an inlet temperature<br>
of around 400° to 600°C, preferably from 520° to 600°C, yet more preferably<br>
540° to 580°C, and an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2 bars, most<br>
preferably around atmospheric pressure. Olefinic catalytic cracking may be<br>
understood to comprise a process yielding shorter molecules via bond<br>
breakage. With such high silicon/aluminum ratio in the crystalline silicate<br>
catalyst, a stable olefin conversion can be achieved with a high propylene yield<br>
on an olefin basis.<br>
The MFI catalyst having a high silicon/aluminum atomic ratio for use in<br>
the second reactor of the present invention may be manufactured by removing<br>
aluminum from a commercially available crystalline silicate. A typical<br>
commercially available silicalite has a silicon/aluminum atomic ratio of around<br>
120. The commercially available MFI crystalline silicate may be modified by a<br>
steaming process which reduces the tetrahedral aluminum in the crystalline<br>
silicate framework and converts the aluminum atoms into octahedral aluminum<br>
in the form of amorphous alumina. Although in the steaming step aluminum<br>
atoms are chemically removed from the crystalline silicate framework structure<br>
to form alumina particles, those particles cause partial obstruction of the pores<br>
or channels in the framework. This inhibits the olefinic cracking processes of the<br>
present invention. Accordingly, following the steaming step, the crystalline<br>
silicate is subjected to an extraction step wherein amorphous alumina is<br>
removed from the pores and the micropore volume is, at least partially,<br>
recovered. The physical removal, by a leaching step, of the amorphous alumina<br>
from the pores by the formation of a water-soluble aluminum complex yields the<br>
overall effect of de-alumination of the MFI crystalline silicate. In this way by<br>
removing aluminum from the MFI crystalline silicate framework and then<br>
removing alumina formed therefrom from the pores, the process aims at<br>
achieving a substantially homogeneous de-alumination throughout the whole<br>
pore surfaces of the catalyst. This reduces the acidity of the catalyst and<br>
thereby reduces the occurrence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the cracking<br>
process. The reduction of acidity ideally occurs substantially homogeneously<br>
throughout the pores defined in the crystalline silicate framework. This is<br>
because in the olefin-cracking process hydrocarbon species can enter deeply<br>
into the pores. Accordingly, the reduction of acidity and thus the reduction in<br>
hydrogen transfer reactions which would reduce the stability of the MFI catalyst<br>
are pursued throughout the whole pore structure in the framework. The<br>
framework silicon/aluminum ratio may be increased by this process to a value of<br>
at least about 180, preferably from about 180 to 1000, more preferably at least<br>
200, yet more preferably at least 300 and most preferably around 480.<br>
The MEL or MFI crystalline silicate catalyst may be mixed with a binder,<br>
preferably an inorganic binder, and shaped to a desired shape, e. g. extruded<br>
pellets. The binder is selected so as to be resistant to the temperature and other<br>
conditions employed in the catalyst manufacturing process and in the<br>
subsequent catalytic cracking process for the olefins. The binder is an inorganic<br>
material selected from clays, silica, metal oxides such as Zr02 and/or metals, or<br>
gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The binder is preferably<br>
alumina-free, although aluminum in certain chemical compounds as in AlPOVs<br>
may be used as the latter are quite inert and not acidic in nature. If the binder<br>
which is used in conjunction with the crystalline silicate is itself catalytically<br>
active, this may alter the conversion and/or the selectivity of the catalyst.<br>
Inactive materials for the binder may suitably serve as diluents to control the<br>
amount of conversion so that products can be obtained economically and<br>
orderly without employing other means for controlling the reaction rate. It is<br>
desirable to provide a catalyst having a good crush strength. This is because in<br>
commercial use, it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into<br>
powder-like materials. Such clay or oxide binders have been employed normally<br>
only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst. A<br>
particularly preferred binder for the catalyst of the present invention comprises<br>
silica or AIPO4.<br>
The relative proportions of the finely divided crystalline silicate material<br>
and the inorganic oxide matrix of the binder can vary widely. Typically, the<br>
binder content ranges from 5 to 95% by weight, more typically from 20 to 50%<br>
by weight, based on the weight of the composite catalyst. Such a mixture of<br>
crystalline silicate and an inorganic oxide binder is referred to as a formulated<br>
crystalline silicate.<br>
In mixing the catalyst with a binder, the catalyst may be formulated into<br>
pellets, spheres, extruded into other shapes, or formed into a spray-dried<br>
powder. In the catalytic cracking process of the second reactor, the process<br>
conditions are selected in order to provide high selectivity towards propylene or<br>
ethylene, as desired, a stable olefin conversion over time, and a stable olefinic<br>
product distribution in the effluent. Such objectives are favored by the use of a<br>
low acid density in the catalyst (i.e. a high Si/AI atomic ratio) in conjunction with<br>
a low pressure, a high inlet temperature and a short contact time, all of which<br>
process parameters are interrelated and provide an overall cumulative effect.<br>
The process conditions are selected to disfavour hydrogen transfer reactions<br>
leading to the formation of paraffins, aromatics and coke precursors. The<br>
process operating conditions thus employ a high space velocity, a low pressure<br>
and a high reaction temperature. The LHSV ranges from 5 to 30 hr-1 preferably<br>
from 10 to 30 hr-1. The olefin partial pressure ranges from 0.1 to 2 bars,<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 1.5 bars (absolute pressures referred to herein). A<br>
particularly preferred olefin partial pressure is atmospheric pressure (i.e. 1 bar).<br>
The heavy hydrocarbon fraction feedstock is preferably fed at a total inlet<br>
pressure sufficient to convey the feedstocks through the reactor. Said feedstock<br>
may be fed undiluted or diluted in an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen or steam.<br>
Preferably, the total absolute pressure in the second reactor ranges from 0.5 to<br>
10 bars. The use of a low olefin partial pressure, for example atmospheric<br>
pressure, tends to lower the incidence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the<br>
cracking process, which in turn reduces the potential for coke formation which<br>
tends to reduce catalyst stability. The cracking of the olefins is preferably<br>
performed at an inlet temperature of the feedstock of from 400° to 650°C, more<br>
preferably from 450° to 600°C, yet more preferably from 540°C to 590°C,<br>
typically around 560° to 585°C.<br>
In order to maximize the amount of ethylene and propylene and to<br>
minimize the production of methane, aromatics and coke, it is desired to<br>
minimize the presence of diolefins in the feed. Diolefin conversion to monoolefin<br>
hydrocarbons may be accomplished with a conventional selective<br>
hy'drogenation process such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,695,560 hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
The second reactor can be a fixed bed reactor, a moving bed reactor or a<br>
fluidized bed reactor. A typical fluid bed reactor is one of the FCC type used for<br>
fluidized-bed catalytic cracking in the oil refinery. A typical moving bed reactor is<br>
of the continuous catalytic reforming type. As described above, the process may<br>
be performed continuously using a pair of parallel "swing" reactors. The heavy<br>
hydrocarbon fraction cracking process is endothermic; therefore, the reactor<br>
should be adapted to supply heat as necessary to maintain a suitable reaction<br>
temperature. Online or periodic regeneration of the catalyst may be provided by<br>
any suitable means known in the art.<br>
The various preferred catalysts of the second reactor have been found to<br>
exhibit high stability, in particular being capable of giving a stable propylene yield<br>
over several days, e.g. up to ten days. This enables the olefin cracking process to<br>
be performed continuously in two parallel "swing" reactors wherein when one<br>
reactor is operating, the other reactor is undergoing catalyst regeneration. The<br>
catalyst can be regenerated several times.<br>
The second reactor effluent comprises methane, light olefins and<br>
hydrocarbons having 4 carbon atoms or more. Advantageously said second<br>
reactor effluent is sent to a fractionator and the light olefins are recovered.<br>
Advantageously the hydrocarbons having 4 carbon atoms or more are recycled at<br>
the inlet of the second reactor, optionally mixed with the heavy hydrocarbon<br>
recovered from the effluent of the first reactor. Advantageously, before recycling<br>
said hydrocarbons having 4 carbon atoms or more at the inlet of the second<br>
reactor, said hydrocarbons having 4 carbon atoms or more are sent to a second<br>
fractionator to purge the heavies. In a preferred embodiment the light olefins<br>
recovered from the effluent of the first reactor and the light olefins recovered from<br>
the fractionator following the second reactor are treated in a common recovery<br>
section.<br>
Optionally, in order to adjust the propylene to ethylene ratio of the whole<br>
complex, ethylene in whole or in part can be recycled over the second reactor<br>
and advantageously converted into more propylene. This ethylene can either<br>
come from the fractionation section of the first reactor or from the second<br>
reactor.<br>
Optionally, the ethylene in whole or in part coming from either the first or<br>
the second reactor can be recycled over the first reactor where it combines with<br>
methanol to form more propylene. These ways of operation allow to respond<br>
with the same equipment and catalyst to market propylene to ethylene demand.<br>
With regards to another embodiment of the invention, said<br>
embodiment relates to a process to make light olefins from an oxygen-<br>
containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic feedstock<br>
comprising :<br>
contacting said oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing<br>
organic   feedstock   in   a   primary   reactor   with   a   catalyst   made   of   a<br>
metalloaluminophosphate (MeAPO) molecular sieve at conditions effective to<br>
convert at least a portion of the feedstock to form a first reactor effluent<br>
comprising light olefins and a heavy hydrocarbon fraction;<br>
separating said light olefins from said heavy hydrocarbon fraction;<br>
contacting said heavy hydrocarbon fraction in a second reactor at conditions<br>
effective to convert at least a portion of said heavy hydrocarbon fraction to light<br>
olefins;<br>
wherein said MeAPO has been prepared by a method comprising :<br>
a)        forming a reaction mixture containing a texture influencing agent (TIA),<br>
an organic templating agent (TEMP), at least a reactive inorganic source of<br>
MeO2 essentially insoluble in the TIA, reactive sources of Al2 O3 and P2 O5,<br>
b)        crystallizing the above reaction mixture thus formed until crystals of the<br>
metalloaluminophosphate are formed,<br>
c)        recovering a solid reaction product,<br>
d)        washing it with water to remove the TIA and<br>
e)        calcinating it to remove the organic template.<br>
In  a  usual  embodiment  said   reaction   mixture  has  a  composition<br>
expressed in terms of molar oxide ratios of:<br>
TEMP/AI2O3 = 0.3-5 , more desirable 0.5-2<br>
MeO2/Al2O3 = 0.005-2.0, more desirable 0.022-0.8<br>
P2O5/AI2O3 =0.5-2, more desirable 0.8-1.2<br>
TIA/AI2O3 = 3-30, more desirable 6-20<br>
In an advantageous embodiment TEMP/AI2O3 = 0.5-2 ; MeO2/AI2O3 =<br>
0.022-0.8; P2O5/AI2O3 = 0.8-1.2 and TIA/AI2O3 = 6-20.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment TEMP/AI2O3 = 0.5-2 ; MeO2/Al2O3 =<br>
0.022-0.7; P2O5/AI2O3 = 0.8-1.2 and TIA/AI2O3= 6-20.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment TEMP/AI2O3 = 0.7-2 ; MeO2/AI2O3 =<br>

The method of making the olefin products from an oxygenate feedstock<br>
can include the additional step of making the oxygenate feedstock from<br>
hydrocarbons such as oil, coal, tar sand, shale, biomass and natural gas.<br>
Methods for making oxygenate feedstocks are known in the art. These methods<br>
include fermentation to alcohol or ether, making synthesis gas, then converting<br>
the synthesis gas to alcohol or ether. Synthesis gas can be produced by known<br>
processes such as steam reforming, autothermal reforming and partial<br>
oxidization in case of gas feedstocks or by reforming or gasification using<br>
oxygen and steam in case of solid (coal, organic waste) or liquid feedstocks.<br>
Methanol, methylsulfide and methylhalides can be produced by oxidation of<br>
methane with the help of dioxygen, sulphur or halides in the corresponding<br>
oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic<br>
compound.<br>
One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the olefin products made by<br>
the oxygenate-to-olefin conversion reaction using the molecular sieve of the<br>
present invention can be polymerized to form polyolefins, particularly<br>
polyethylenes and polypropylenes.<br>

Catalyst tests were performed on 2g catalyst samples with a pure<br>
methanol feed at 450°C, pressure of 0,5 barg, and WHSV=1.6h-1in a fixed-<br>
bed, down flow stainless-steel reactor. Catalyst powders was pressed into<br>
wafers and crushed to 35-45 mesh particles. Prior to catalytic run all catalysts<br>
were heated in flowing N2 (5 Nl/h) up to the reaction temperature. Analysis of<br>
the products has been performed on-line by a gas chromatograph equipped<br>
with a capillary column. Catalytic performances of MeAPOs molecular sieves<br>
were compared at 100% of methanol conversion and maximum of catalyst<br>
activity just before appearance of DME in the effluent.<br>
The feedstock which contains substantially non cyclic olefins C4+ (the<br>
heavy hydrocarbon fraction) was subjected to catalytic cracking (the second<br>
reactor) in the presence of an aluminosilicate catalyst in a fixed bed reactor at<br>
575°C, LHSV=10h-1, P=1,5 bara. This catalyst comprises a commercially<br>
available silicalite which had been subjected to a dealumination treatment by<br>
combination of steaming with acid treatment so as provide Si/AI ratio -250. A<br>
detailed procedure of catalyst preparation is described in above cited<br>
EP1194502 B1.<br>
The OCP performance has been simulated using a mathematic model<br>
employing conversion factors deduced from numerous testing of different<br>
feedstocks. Based on the stream composition going to the OCP reactor and on<br>
the required purges an optimum stream of C4 and heaviers are recycled around<br>
the OCP reactor. The lines under "OCP feed non cyclic olefins C4+" display the<br>
