				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for protein based fatless fat substitute and a process for the preparation thereof. More particularly, the present invention provides a cost efficient process for preparing a protein based fatless fat substitute which is suitable for use as a supplement to or substitute for a variety of food preparations.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Fat plays a key role in majority of food products. Fat provides a creamy texture and a flowing mouthfeel to foods. It contributes to the food, various organoleptic and rheological characteristics such as flavour, mouthfeel, body texture, etc. These attributes contribute to the richness of the food product, resulting in better market value and consumer acceptability with regard to high cholesterol content and energy levels. Fat has been implicated in various health disorders, in particular, the cardiovascular ailments and obesity.<br>
Concern over the intake of dietary fat has triggered consumer demand with low or no fat foods. By the removal of fat in food, many of the physico-chemical properties get altered. In view of this, a low consumer response is observed towards these products. The demand carries formulation challenges for food technologists to compensate for the loss of body and mouthfeel, opacity, slip, mouth coating, flavour masking, fatty flavour and a variety of other functional properties. To reaccomplish<br><br>
this, there is a need for suitable ingredients, which is/are non-toxic, cost effective and able to mimic the fat without increasing the calorie intake.<br>
Protein concentrates/isolates have long been recognized as an important component of processed foods. The need for protein is becoming more important as a basic nutritional requirement. New sources of protein concentrate are being sought to supplement the usual protein material such as milk proteins. These protein concentrates are used in diet supplements and commercially prepared foods. Protein concentrates have been much in demand particularly as fat substitutes. Natural fats have 9 Kcal (kilo calories) per gram, and proteins have 4 Kcal per gram, thus, replacing fats in foods with proteins results in a significant calorie savings. In addition, a diet high in fats has been linked with health disorders such as obesity, heart disease and atherosclerosis. Therefore, replacing the fats in fats with proteins has the desirable effect of improving the nutritional quality of the food, as well as reducing its caloric content. Soybean proteins have been used in this regard based on their availability, relatively low cost, protein content and compatibility with other food materials. Utilization of whey proteins for foods has been studied in view of their properties, such as solubility, emulsifiability, gelling ability, etc.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a protein based fatless fat substitute using whey protein concentrate and soy protein isolate with an appealing color, texture and mouthfeel and imitating butter spreads.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 3,852,503, (P.J. Magnino et al, 1974) which describes a method for preparing an acid-stable soy protein product. The protein product is an aqueous slurry of soy protein which can be used directly as a component in processed foods (e.g., puddings), and can be dried to an acid-soluble powder. The present invention describes the use of a mixture of proteins (whey protein and soybean protein).<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No.5,145,702 (Stark, et a/., 1992) which describes a process for the preparation of water dispersible microparticles proteins based on Zein protein. The water insoluble proteins used in the process is chemically or enzymatic ally modified to enhance the properties of the microparticles. Draw back of the above said invention is the usage of non-aqueous solvents in the process.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No.5,147,677 (Zeigler, 1992) which describes a process for the preparation of microparticulated protein from egg white and gelatin protein phases which can be used as a fat replacer in formulated edible foods. The present invention describes about the usage of a plant protein (soybean) along with milk protein to produce a fatless fat substitute.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US patent No.6,673,384 (Villagran et al. 2004) which describes a process for the preparation of a creamy mouthfeel agent for food and beverage products. The drawback is the use of additional fat.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No.5,458,904 (Zolper, 1995) which describes a process for the preparation of low fat or fat-free substances which can be used as a fat substitute. The product is based on a gel system produced form undenatured whole milk protein and carrageenan. The present invention describes the use of whey protein and sobean protein to produce a fatless fat substitute.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No.6,051,271 (Yamamoto et al., 2000) which describes a process for the preparation of a proteinaceous microparticles obtained by lowering pH of a liquid mixture which contains whey protein and a metal element. The microparticles are used as a fat substitute. Draw back of the invention is use of organic solvent in the process.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No.4,734,287 (N.S. Singer, er al., 1988) which describes a protein product based on dairy whey proteins which can be used as a fat substitute. The product produced by their method is composed of heat-labile particles of denatured dairy whey protein. In this process, whey proteins are heat-denatured under high shear conditions, and at low pH, to produce finely divided particles of denatured whey protein.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US patent No.6,335,048 (Swarvar et al., 2002) which describes interconvertible solid and liquid states of olestra, which is a mixture of octa-, hepta- and hexaesters formed by the reaction of sucrose with long chain fatty acids. Drawback of this product is it cannot be digested and it passes through the body without providing any calories. The present invention describes the preparation of a high protein (64%) fatless fat substitute having a digestibility of 97% and Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score [PDCAAS] value of 0.93 and mimics butter spreads.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a high quality protein based fatless fat substitute which is suitable for use as a supplement to or substitute for a variety of food preparations.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to produce a protein based fatless fat substitute having an acceptable colour, taste, texture and mouthfeel.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a cost efficient process for preparing a protein based fatless fat substitute which is suitable for use as a supplement to or substitute for a variety of food preparations.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a fatless fat substitute having a particle size of about 3-20 micron and having a fat like organoleptic character. The process comprises initially dispersing soy protein isolate and whey protein concentrate in water to make slurry having 5 - 12% solids. After keeping the slurry in boiling water bath for a particular time, it is cooled immediately. To this cooled slurry, the thickening agent is added and homogenized at high speed and then spray dried.<br>
The properties of the micro particles can be controlled by varying the process parameters, such as the concentration of the starting protein solution, the rate of agitation, temperature and other variables.<br>
The creamy mouth feel agent of the present invention can be used in food and beverage products where a rich creamy mouth feel is desired.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition for protein based fatless fat substitute comprising of soy protein isolate and whey protein concentrate.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of the said protein based fatless fat substitute, wherein the steps comprises:<br>
[a]	dispersing a protein isolate in water in a ratio of 0.5 to 2.0 : 8.0 to<br>
15.0% w/v to obtain a suspension;<br>
[b]	adding whey protein concentrate to the suspension as obtained in step [a] in the range of 5 to 50 % w/v to obtain a slurry;<br><br>
[c]	keeping the slurry as obtained in step [b] in boiling water bath for 2 to 20 minutes followed by immediate cooling;<br>
[d]	adding 0.01 to 1% of a thickening agent to the boiled and cooled slurry as obtained in step [c] to obtain a gel;<br>
[e]	homogenizing the gel as obtained in step [d] at a speed of 5,000 to 50,000 rpm followed by spray drying to obtain the desired protein based fatless fat substitute.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention Materials used<br>
Commercially available soy protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and food grade xanthan were used.<br>
Preparation of protein based fatless fat substitute<br>
Soy protein isolate was made into a slurry with 10% solid content. Based on the nitrogen content of the protein isolate, it is blended with whey protein concentrate to give a ratio of whey protein nitrogen to soy protein nitrogen as 1:1. The slurry was kept in boiling water bath for 2-20 minutes and cooled immediately at 4 degree C. Xanthan (0.01-1.0% w/w) was added and homogenized at a speed of 5,000-50,000 rpm. The slurry was spray dried to get protein based fatless fat substitute. Protein content of the fatless fat substitute was determined by the micro-kjeldahl procedure (AOAC, 2000).    Particle size analysis of the product carried out by SEM method.<br><br>
PDCAAS value was determined as per the method of Sarwar and McDonough (JOAC,  1990, 73, 347-355).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the protein material selected may be consisting of plant proteins, dairy protein and mixtures, thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the solid content of the soy protein isolate slurry may range from 5-12%.<br>
