IMMERCIBLE MOTOR<br>
An enviable type of lmmercible motor is hereby introduced, MIR hitherto not seen in the market.  This is based on the simple magnetic principle. The salient features are that it is less heavy, very economical yet superbly effective.<br>
Unlike the other motors it is operated at a low voltage of current.  There is no question of polluting the atmosphere by an irritant sound when operated.  The utility stands unchallenged. For all Irrigational purposes it is highly advantageous for the farmers.<br>
Cost of Productiont-<br>
Produced at a considerable low cost.  On a large scale it will com.e to lower than Rs 1500/-.<br>
Description of the mechanism;-<br>
A single layer winding is used.  The A C Voltage is<br>
converted into +ve voltage and -ve voltage.  Which is<br>
sine wave frequency.  In this single layer windings when<br>
the 230 V AC Is applied the soft iron core is changed Into<br>
electromagnet.  Only laminated soft iron core is used In<br>
this winding coil.  The permeability Increase safeguards<br>
the motor from getting over heated or burned up.  The<br>
electromagnet is regulated which in turn regulates the level of water.  That is as the magnetic power increses an equa.l<br>
Increase in the level or force of the water is effected.<br>
The permeability is of utmost inportance, A low permeability might cause the burning up of the motor. The result Is the bent loss, power loss and efficiency loss. A laminated soft iron core used in the system, protects the motor.  This quarantees greater permeability than any other mot t-.  Such a machine can be operated at will far any length of tlm.p without any loss of heat or efficiency, '  the same time a free, non_ stop flow of water la pumped<br><br>
through outlet pipe of the motor.<br>
The larrinated soft core attracts the other laminated soft iron cores. To this coil the 230V Ac is applied to produce the dectromagnetlc power. Thus the electromagnets and the laminated soft iron core creat the vibration. At once the rubber sheets or the vibrator plates alao get Vibrated, Pulling and pushing the steel plates or the steel cases.  Thereby the air is pushed into the outlet pipe which then escapes through the socket and adopter. An inlet valve serves the purpose and saves an outlet valve, A foot valve device is also out of place. The parts and the handle of the motor are fitted by means of 4 or 6 screws.  The handle is fitted on inlet valve of the steel plates. This being an Immercible type, leek proof and water proof are tested.  Otherwise the case of the motor causes a shock, cutting off the electric circuit in the phase wire and the neutral wire. An electronic automatic cutt off circute fitted inV" the motor, prevents such a shock.<br>
Working principle in brief;<br>
The ir,otor working is based upon the principle of the changes in electro magnets. The channle is effected by means of a coil applied to the 230V Ac, Thus the electro¬magnets and the laminated soft iron core get mutually attracted. At once the laminated soft iron core is vibrated leading to the same in the vibrator plates as well. Ulimately this causes the pumping of water through the . outlet pipe, threded socket and the adopter.<br><br><br><br><br>
Inductor  is another basic Conponent conrronly used  in Electronic  &amp; electrical circuita.     It Is  nothing else but a  coll would on a  soft  Iron core or former of  soir.e sultabe taterials.     Iron core  inductor  in which a coil of wire  is wound over a  solid or  laminated eoft  iron core.     Putting   iron inside on  inductor has the effect of  increasl IKI   its  inductence as many times as the  relatieve  permiability   (u )  of iron. In order to avoid eddely current  loss,   iron core is  laminated i  e  It  is  made up of thin  iron laminations pressed together but   insulated  from each other,     Som.e times,   such an  inductor is  also calleddchoke.     The  iron core  has  been found to  work m.ore efficiently particularly at low frequecles  If  it  is in the form  of  a closed core     i.e  if     the core  not only goes through the center of  the coil but  also    socround.s  if  on  Its two  sides.<br>
Incuctance of  a  inductor is  found that  whenever current through an  inductor chanqes   (  ie  Increases or decreases) ?  counter em.f  if induced  in  it which tends to  oppose this<br><br><br><br>
which  is  Teala   (T),     Mangetlc  flux reaerrbles current  in an electric circuit,     it conHlnta of niaynetic  foice  resenblps voltage or eir. f  In an electric circuit &amp; it  is  responsible for producing magnetic  flux in a magnetic circuit,     it's value is given by  the product of current through the coil &amp; its number of t turns  i e  N.I.     It's unit  is ampare-trns,<br>
r     Magnetic  field  strength is also in density of magnetic field or   (more comronly)  magnefising  force.    As we know,   each magnet has   its own magnetic  field consi£?ing of  lines of force which  start  from  itp  N Pole,   pass  through the sorrounding medium., re-enter the S pole  &amp; complete their path  from.'s to'N pole through the body of  the magnet.    When a magnetic m.aterials is placed  in the magnetlc  field,   it  becor.es  magnetised whereas non-k1 m.agnetic  matprinle  remain uneffected.     The   strength of  a  m.agnetic field  at  any point  is measured by the  force experienced by a  N N  poles of   1 wb place  theie.     A uniform, magntic  field  is one<br><br><br>
Permiability 1P the ability of a magnetic rr.aterials to conduct magnetic flux through It.  If It allows the flux to pass through move easily or readly It Is said to have greater permlability.  The permlabillty of a substance is measured both in absolute terrs &amp; in relative terns with respect to vacum (or approxinntely air).  suppose there is a uniform magnetic field of strength 'K' established in air.  Further suppose that a bar of .1 magnetic m.aterinli; of the core, The  iron bar gets magnetised by induction.  suppose it developed by it is also m. Weber,  The lines of induction flux ellmate from, its 'N' pole, go round &amp; Re-enter it Is 'S' pole &amp; ten continue from, 'S' to 'N* polf,within m.agnets,. These lines are seen to be In opposition to the lines of force of the main field 'H' outside the magnet but in the sam.e direction within It.  If  is the flux passing through the bar &amp; 'A is its pole area, then flux density within<br><br><br>
I  claim that;-<br>
(1)	The folowing materi als/components are not necessary<br>
as used in  other type of  water  pump set;-<br>
(a)	Armature<br>
(b)	Foot valve<br>
(c)	Impiller<br>
(d)	copasitor<br>
(e)	Sectional pipe<br><br>
(2)	in  other type cf  Water pumpa    two types of coils  are used. One for  starting and other for running coils.     But in immercible    pumpset,   I used only  single layer winding.<br>
(3)	other  types of motor required to rotate,  but in the motor inventend me does not rotate.<br>
(4)	This immercible pump makes very  little noise,<br>
(5)	This subject pumpset  works on   low voltage  at 50 VAC but other pumpsets require 230 V Ac,<br>
(6)	The permeability increases safe guards the motor from getting over heated or burned up,<br>
(7)	In the case of  the motor   causes a shock,   cutting off  the electric circuit in  the phase wire and neutral wire,<br>
(8)	An electronic automatic cut  off  circuit fitted in the mctor, prevents  such a shock,<br>
(9)	Other type of normal motor weighs about 15 Kgs and above, but in the case of my pump set  weights on  3 kgs,<br>
do)   In  the open market  1.5 HP motor pumpset  costs  about<br>
Rs. 7,000/-    but my pumpset  costs about RS.   l,500/- only. It's capacity is 1.5 H.P,<br>
(11)	In my pumpset  there is no need to pour water to keep the water in motor  level because it  lays bottom of the water  level,<br>
(12)	Altogether, This new motor pumpset require a very few materials/components and can easily carry one place to another place even for repair.<br><br></td>
