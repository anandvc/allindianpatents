SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR FLEXIBLY CONFIGURING LENGTH OF<br>
NEIGHBOR BASE STATION INFORMATION IN BROADBAND<br>
WIRELESS ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
5	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   broadband   wireless   access<br>
communication system, and more particularly to a system and a method for<br>
10        configuring a neighbor base station advertisement (hereinafter referred to as<br>
'MOB_NBR-ADV') message including neighbor base station information.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a next generation communication system, that is, a 4th generation<br>
15 (hereinafter referred to as '4G') communication system, much research has been<br>
undertaken to provide users with services which have various qualities of service<br>
(hereinafter referred to as 'QoS') and to support a transmission speed of about<br>
100 Mbps. Particularly, in the current 4G communication system, research is<br>
being vigorously pursued to support high-speed services to broadband wireless<br>
20 access (hereinafter referred to as 'BWA') communication systems such as<br>
wireless local area network (hereinafter referred to as 'WLAN') communication<br>
systems and wireless metropolitan area network (hereinafter referred to as<br>
'WMAN') communication systems by ensuring both mobility and various QoSs.<br>
A typical communication system for this purpose is an IEEE (Institute of<br>
25        Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.16 communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16 communication system is a communication system<br>
which applies an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (hereinafter referred<br>
to as 'OFDM')/orthogonal frequency division multiple access (hereinafter<br>
referred to as 'OFDMA') scheme in order to support a broadband transmission<br>
30        network to a physical channel of the WMAN system.<br>
A structure of an IEEE 802.16 communication system will now be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1, which schematically illustrates the common<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802/16e communication system has a<br>
35 multiple cell structure, for example, it has cells 100 and 150. The IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system also includes a base station (hereinafter referred to as<br>
'BS') 110 controlling the cell 100, a BS 140 controlling the cell 150, and a<br>
plurality of mobile stations (hereinafter referred to as 'MS') 111, 113, 130, 151,<br><br>
-2-<br>
and 153.    Signal transmission/reception between the BSs 110, 140 and the MSs<br>
111, 113, 130, 151, and 153 is implemented using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br>
In addition, from among the MSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153, the MS 130 exists<br>
in a boundary area between the cells 100 and 150, that is, a handover area.    Thus,<br>
5        the BS 100 or the BS 150 must be capable of supporting handover of the MS 130.<br>
For example, when the MS 130 moves to an area covered by the cell 150<br>
while it communicates with the BS 110 in the cell 100, and the MS 130 undergoes<br>
handover to the BS 140, the MS 130 must conduct a network re-entry procedure<br>
with the BS 140.    This is because the BS 110 and the BS 140 have different<br>
10        physical layers and different medium access control (hereinafter referred to as<br>
'MAC') layer structures.<br>
If an MS conducts a network re-entry procedure during handover from a<br>
serving BS, in which the MS is currently located, to a neighbor BS as stated<br>
above, a data service in transmission/reception is interrupted and must newly be<br>
15        started after the MS completes the handover to the neighbor BS.    In order to<br>
handover to the neighbor BS in this way, the MS must be capable of recognizing<br>
neighbor BS information.    The neighbor BS information may be recognized by<br>
receiving an MOB_NBR-ADV message which each BS periodically broadcasts.<br>
Hereinafter, an MOB-NBR-ADV message format will be described with<br>
20        reference  to  FIGs.   2A  and  2D,  which  illustrate   a   format  of a  common<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2A and 2D, the MOB_NBR-ADV message is<br>
configured of a plurality of information elements (hereinafter referred to as 'IE'),<br>
and the IEs are as follows:<br>
25	- Management Message Type:  represents the type of a transmitted<br>
message:<br>
-	Operator ID: represents an unique identifier assigned to a operator,<br>
-	Configuration Change Count: each time message configuration changes,<br>
increases by 1 to indicate whether a corresponding message has changed;<br>
30	- Fragmentation Index: represents the number of times that a message is<br>
transmitted   when   the   MOB_NBR-ADV   message   is   fragmented   and   the<br>
fragmented messages are separately transmitted;<br>
-	Total  Fragmentation:  represents  the  total  number  of fragmented<br>
messages;<br>
35	- Skip-Optional-Fields Flag: indicates a BS-ID when the BS-ID is<br>
omitted in a corresponding message;<br>
-	N-NEIGHBORS: represents information on how many neighbor BSs<br>
are included in a current message; that is, it represents the number of neighbor<br><br>
-3-<br>
BSs;<br>
-	Length: represents information field length according to BS~Ids;<br>
-	PHY Profile ID: indicates an information ID of a radio channel used in a<br>
corresponding BS;<br>
5	- FA Index: indicates an inherent ID representing a frequency allocated to<br>
a corresponding BS;<br>
-	BS EIRP: represents transmission power intensity of a corresponding<br>
BS;<br>
-	Neighbor BS-ID: indicates IDs of neighbor BSs;<br>
10	- Preamble Index: indicates an ID of a preamble to be used in a<br>
corresponding sector of a corresponding BS;<br>
-	HO   Process   Optimization:   dividedly  indicates   information   about<br>
indispensable procedures and information about omissible procedures during<br>
handover to a corresponding BS;<br>
15	- Scheduling Service Supported: indicates QoS classes supportable by a<br>
corresponding BS, from among various QoS classes predefined between BSs;<br>
-	Available Radio Resource: indicates the degree of availability of radio<br>
channel resources of a corresponding BS;<br>
-	Handoff Neighbor Preference: defines the degree of logical preference<br>
20        when a serving BS controls an MS to handover to a neighbor BS;<br>
-	DCD Configuration Change Count: indicates the DCD (Downlink<br>
Channel Descriptor) information serial number of a corresponding neighbor BS;<br>
-	UCD Configuration Change Count: indicates the UCD (Uplink Channel<br>
Descriptor) information serial number of a corresponding neighbor BS;<br>
25	-   Other   neighbor   information   (hereinafter   referred   to   as    "TLV<br>
(Type/Length/Value) Encoded Neighbor Information'): represents all information<br>
related to a neighbor BS other than the aforementioned information.<br>
Now, the MOB_NBR-ADV message will be described in more detail.<br>
The MS, having received the MOB_NBR-ADV message periodically<br>
30        broadcasted from the serving BS, can acquire scanning information for measuring<br>
signal intensities of neighbor BSs. The MS can identify neighbor BSs by using<br>
Neighbor BS-ID information included in the MOBNBR-ADV message, and thus<br>
comes  to  recognize  physical  frequency band  search information,  which is<br>
necessary for scanning the neighbor BSs, through the Physical Frequency field.<br>
35         In  this  way,  the  serving  BS  periodically broadcasts  the  MOB NBR-ADV<br>
message to provide information which the MS requires for handover.<br>
Therefore, the conventional MOB_NBR-ADV message includes a lot of<br>
information, and its large size is problematic.<br><br>
-4-<br>
Here, the MS may require, or may not necessarily require, the<br>
information included in the MOB_NBR-ADV depending on the present<br>
circumstances. Also, the MOB_NBR-ADV message is not a message which is<br>
transmitted to a specific MS, but is a broadcast message which is repeatedly<br>
5 transmitted to many unspecified MSs in very short cycles. On account of this,<br>
bandwidth consumption in a radio channel section is very large. In the end,<br>
there is a problem in that radio channel resources are wasted because a network<br>
operator must include unnecessary information in the MOBNBR-ADV message.<br>
10	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve at least the<br>
above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a system and a method for configuring an MOBNBR-<br>
15 ADV message in a broadband wireless access communication system, which can<br>
reduce the size of the MOB_NBR-ADV message.<br>

in the MOB_NBR-ADV message; and determining a bit value of the specific field<br>

field when the MOB NBR-ADV message is configured in accordance with a<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
20<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that<br>
similar components are designated by similar reference numerals although they<br>
are illustrated in different drawings.    Also, in the following description, a<br>
25        detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention proposes a method for newly configuring an<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message in a broadband wireless access communication<br>
system.<br>
30	To be specific, whenever a BS periodically broadcasts the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message, it determines what information fields are to be included in the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message, and adds to a new field information about whether<br>
the information fields exist in order to clarify the information according to the<br>
above determination.<br>
35	Referring again to the conventional MOB_NBR-ADV message of FIGs.<br>
2A and 2 B, prior to a description of the present invention, an Operator ID field is<br>
a field indicating an inherent ID of a BS which transmits the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message.    However, the Operator ID is information which an MS has already<br><br>
-6-<br>
recognized through a network entry procedure previously conducted with a<br>
serving BS in which the MS is currently located. Thus, the Operator ID is not<br>
information which the serving BS must periodically transmit to the MS.<br>
Also, in the conventional MOB_NBR-ADV message, the Neighbor BS-<br>
5 ID field is included in the message while a bit value of the Skip-Optional-Fields<br>
Flag is set to '0' only when a physical layer scheme of a network is an OFDMA<br>
scheme. Thus, a broadband wireless access communication system employing<br>
an OFDM or single carrier scheme does not include the Neighbor BS-ID field<br>
while the bit value of the Skip-Optional-Fields Flag is set to '1'.<br>
10	Moreover,  in the  conventional  MOB_NBR-ADV message,  the  HO<br>
Process Optimization field need not be nessarily included in the message because<br>
there may be a case in which a serving BS cannot support handover to some<br>
neighbor BSs.<br>
Furthermore,  in the  conventional  MOB_NBR-ADV message,  fields<br>
15 related to QoS (Quality of Service)s (i.e., Scheduling Service Supported,<br>
Available Radio Resource and Handover neighbor Preference fields) are not<br>
supportable by all BSs. Even if any BS is capable of supporting the QoS relation<br>
information, it cannot always provide the information in a case where it is<br>
impossible for the BS to collect neighbor BS information in real-time.<br>
20	In  conclusion,  the  aforementioned  fields  can be  omitted  from  the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message, and each BS, that is, each network operator, can<br>
reduce the length of the MOB_NBR-ADV message by properly inserting or<br>
omitting the omissible fields into or from the MOB_NBR-ADV message<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
25	An MOB_NBR-ADV message format newly proposed in the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIGs. 3A to 3D, which illustrate the<br>
new MOB_NBR-ADV message format in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 3A to 3D, first, the new MOB_NBR-ADV message<br>
30 includes an NBR-FLAG field which is added to the conventional MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message. Although the size of the NBR_FLAG field is specified by 8 bits<br>
in this embodiment of the present invention, it should be noted that a network<br>
operator may appropriately change the size according to system situations. In<br>
the following description, it is assumed that the NBR_FLAG field has a size of 8<br>
35        bits.<br>
In the added NBR_FLAG field of 8 bits, its first 4 bits are used for<br>
clarifying whether specific fields exist in the MOB_NBR-ADV message, and its<br>
last 4 bits are reserved bits available for future function extension.<br><br>
-7-<br>
The 4 bits in the NBR_FLAG, which are used for clarifying whether<br>
specific fields exist in the MOB_NBR-ADV message, may be configured as<br>
follows:<br>
Bit [0]: is located in the first place of the 8 bits in the NBR_FLAG field,<br>
5 and informs whether the Operator ID field is included in the MOB NBR-ADV<br>
message. For example, if a value of bit [0] is '0', this means that the Operator<br>
ID field is included in the MOB_NBR-ADV message. Otherwise, if a value of<br>
bit [0] is '1', this means that the Operator ID field is not included in the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message.<br>
10	Bit [1]: is located in the second place of the 8 bits in the NBR_FLAG<br>
field, and informs whether the Neighbor BS-ID field is included in the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message. For example, if a value of bit [1] is '0', this means<br>
that the Neighbor BS-ID field is included in the MOBNBR-ADV message.<br>
Otherwise, if a value of bit [1] is '1', this means that the Neighbor BS-ID field is<br>
15        not included in the MOBNBR-ADV message.<br>
Bit [2]: is located in the third place of the 8 bits in the NBR_FLAG field,<br>
and informs whether the HO Process Optimization field is included in the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message. For example, if a value of bit [2] is '0', this means<br>
that the HO Process Optimization field is included in the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
20 message. Otherwise, if a value of bit [2] is '1', this means that the HO Process<br>
Optimization field is not included in the MOB_NBR-ADV message.<br>
Bit [3]: is located in the fourth place of the 8 bits in the NBR_FLAG field,<br>
and informs whether QoS related fields are included in the MOBNBR-ADV<br>
message. For example, if a value of bit [3] is '0', this means that the QoS<br>
25 related fields are included in the MOB_NBR-ADV message. Otherwise, if a<br>
value of bit [3] is T, this means that the QoS related fields are not included in<br>
the MOB_NBR-ADV message.<br>
Here, the QoS related fields included in the MOB_NBR-ADV message<br>
refer to the Scheduling Service Supported field, the Available Radio resource field<br>
30         and the Handover Neighbor Preference field.<br>
Besides the aforementioned bits, bits [4] to [7] are reserved bits.<br>
For example, if the NBR_FLAG field has a value of '1001 0000', this<br>
means that the Operator ID field and the QoS related fields do not exist, but the<br>
Neighbor BS-ID field and the HO Process Optimization field exist in the<br>
35        MOB_NBR-AD V message.<br>
As stated above, by removing unnecessary fields from the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message and clarifying the presence/absence of the fields in the<br>
NBR_FALG field, the size of the MOBNBR-ADV message can be reduced.<br><br>
-8-<br>
That is, it is possible to configure an MOB_NBR-ADV message having flexibility<br>
in size (length).    In addition, a serving BS may configure and transmit the new<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message according to the present invention every single period<br>
or every several periods.    That is, when information fields constituting an<br>
5        MOBNBR-ADV message  to be  transmitted in  a  current period must be<br>
configured differently from those transmitted in a previous period, the serving BS<br>
can newly configure and transmit the MOB_NBR-ADV message according to the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Now, a process of setting up the NBRFLAG field of the MOBNBR-<br>
10        ADV message will be described with reference to FIG. 4, which is a flowchart<br>
illustrating the process of setting up the NBRFLAG field when the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message is configured in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a serving BS must configure first the MOB_NBR-<br>
15        ADV message according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention in<br>
order to periodically transmit the MOB NBR-ADV message.    Thus, in step 402,<br>
the serving BS begins to set up an NBR_FLAG field in the MOB NBR-ADV<br>
message, and proceeds to step 404. In step 404, the serving BS determines if an<br>
Operator ID field is inserted into the MOB_NBR-ADV message.    According to<br>
20        is the determination made in step-404, the serving BS proceeds to step 406 when<br>
the Operator ID field is inserted into the MOB_NBR-ADV message, or proceeds<br>
to step 408 when the Operator ID field is not inserted.<br>
In step 406, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [0] = 0', which means<br>
that the MOB_NBR-ADV message includes the Operator ID field, and proceeds<br>
25        to step 410.    In step 408, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [0] = 1', which<br>
means that the MOB_NBR-ADV message does not include the Operator ID field,<br>
and proceeds to step 410.<br>
In step 410, the serving BS determines if a Neighbor BS-ID field is<br>
inserted into the MOB_NBR-ADV message.    According to is the determination<br>
30        made in step 410, the serving BS proceeds to step 412 when the Neighbor BS-ID<br>
field is inserted into the MOB_NBR-ADV message, and proceeds to step 414<br>
when the Neighbor BS-ID field is not inserted.<br>
In step 412, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [1] = 0', which means<br>
that the MOB_NBR-ADV message includes the Neighbor BS-ID field, and<br>
35        proceeds to step 416.    In step 414, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [1] = 1',<br>
which means that the MOB_NBR-ADV message does not include the Neighbor<br>
BS-ID field, and proceeds to step 416.<br>
In step 416, the serving BS determines if an HO Process Optimization<br><br>
-9-<br>
field  is   inserted   into   the   MOBNBR-ADV  message.      According   to   the<br>
determination made in step 416, the serving BS proceeds to step 418 when the<br>
HO Process Optimization field is inserted into the MOB_NBR-ADV message,<br>
and proceeds to step 420 when the HO Process Optimization field is not inserted.<br>
5	In step 418, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [2] = 0', which means<br>
that the MOB_NBR-ADV message includes the HO Process Optimization field,<br>
and proceeds to step 422. In step 420, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [2] =<br>
1', which means that the MOB_NBR-ADV message does not include the HO<br>
Process Optimization field, and proceeds to step 422.<br>
10	In step 422, the serving BS determines if QoS related fields are inserted<br>
into the MOB_NBR-ADV message. According to is the determination made in<br>
step 422, the serving BS proceeds to step 424 when the QoS related fields are<br>
inserted into the MOB_NBR-ADV message, and proceeds to step 426 when the<br>
QoS related fields are not inserted.<br>
15	In step 424, the serving BS sets to 'NBR_FLAG [3] = 0', which means<br>
that the MOBNBR-ADV message includes the QoS related fields or, in step 426,<br>
the serving BS sets to 'NBRFLAG [3] = 1', which means that the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message does not include the QoS related fields, and completes the setup of<br>
the NBRFLAG field.<br>
20	Although   information   fields,   which   may   not   be   included   in   the<br>
MOB_NBR-ADV message, are limited to the Operator ID field, the Neighbor<br>
BS-ID field, the HO Process Optimization field and the QoS related fields in the<br>
description of FIG. 4, these are merely one example. That is, it should be<br>
understood that a network operator may configure the new MOBNBR-ADV<br>
25 message by using other information fields in combination with those stated above.<br>
It should be also noted that new information fields constituting the MOBNBR-<br>
ADV message may be added and extended.<br>
As described above, since a field, which informs whether specific<br>
information fields are included in neighbor BS information broadcast message,<br>
30 that is, an MOB_NBR-ADV message, is newly added to the message, and<br>
omissible information fields are omitted according to the circumstances of a BS<br>
in the present invention, the MOB_NBR-ADV message can be flexibly<br>
configured. Therefore, there is an advantage in that the size of the MOB_NBR-<br>
ADV message is reduced as compared with that of the existing MOB NBR-ADV<br>
35        message and thus radio channel resources can be efficiently utilized.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br><br>
