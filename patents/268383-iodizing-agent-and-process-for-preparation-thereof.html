				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of stable iodizing agent. The present invention also relates to a novel process for the preparation of the iodizing agent from Pharma grade hydrotalcite and water soluble alkali lodate by intercalating lodate anion in the interlayer space. The iodizing agent so prepared is stable and can be effectively used in the formulation of iodized salt, wherein it offers stability to iodine. Background of the invention<br>
Iodine is a very important trace element necessary in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine is required for developing and maintaining healthy body. There are well known Iodine Deficiency Disorders like 'Goiter and Cretinism. The edible salt is chosen as a vehicle in the provision of iodine because of its uniform consumption and availability to all segments of population independent of social or economic status. During the past twenty years, there has been a strong effort, lead by the United Nations, to iodize all salt for human consumption. Potassium lodate and potassium iodide are most often used in iodizing the edible salt. The Food and Nutrition Board of National Research Council of the USA placed the optimum requirement of iodine at 150-300µg per day, and considering 10 gm of salt consumption per day, the iodisation level of salt could be around 15-30 mg per kg of salt. The impurities present in edible salt, moisture and temperature are some of the main factors that induce loss of iodine from iodized salt. In order to deliver adequate amount of iodine to the consumer while avoiding the unnecessary excess addition of iodizing agent in salt that is normally done to compensate for losses, it is of paramount importance that an ultrastable iodizing agent should be developed. This would allow a simultaneous benefit in as much as it may not be necessary to purify salt excessively as is the practice at present to minimize iodine loss apart from imparting a superior aesthetic effect such as free flow nature. The latter is especially important, as it is well known that impurities such as magnesium are required as micronutrient and can also enhance the saltiness of salt.<br>
Reference may be made to a paper entitled "Stability of iodine in iodized salt" by L.L.Diosady and Venkatesh Mannar, published in The Proceedings of 81 World Salt Symposium, 2000, Volume 2, pp 977-982, wherein it is stated in the abstract that, "since iodine readily sublimes at ambient temperature, the effectiveness of salt iodisation programs depends on the stability of the iodine carrier, typically potassium lodate."<br>
The authors further state that they examined the stability of iodine in typical salts available in 12 countries in a controlled laboratory setting, at 40°C and controlled humidity (60 or 100 %) for periods up to 12 months. Iodine was rapidly lost in most unrefined salt samples. Further, the presence of moisture due to hygroscopic impurities, and metal ion impurities, such as iron accelerated the loss of iodine.<br>
Reference may be made to a paper entitled "Stability of iodized salt with respect to iodine content" by S.A.Chauhan et al. in Research and industry, March 1992, Vol 37, pp 38-41 wherein stability of iodine in iodized salt prepared by submersion method using solution of potassium iodate was studied for iodized salt packed in HDPE bags, for iodized salt exposed to atmosphere, iodized salt solution on boiling and iodized salt under heating up to 120°C. The draw back associated with this work evinces that there is considerable loss of iodine during storage in bags or in open atmosphere. Moreover, significant loss of iodine is observed on boiling the salt solution or heating the iodised salt.<br>
Reference may be made to a paper entitled "The stability of potassium iodate in crude table salt", by Arroyave,G. et. al., in Bull. World Health Organisation, 1956, 14, ppl83-155, wherein potassium iodate was stabilized by calcium carbonate in crude sea salt stored in hemp fiber sacks for up to eight months at ambient temperatures and relative humidity between 70 and 84%. Only some 3.5% of added iodine was reported to be lost. The main draw back is that the stability of iodine under exposure to atmosphere and under variable temperature has not been studied. However, as is well known to practitioners in this field, this is not the approach followed in practice for stabilization, presumably because the results are not as encouraging as that indicated m the above report.<br>
Reference may be made to a paper entitled "Micro encapsulation for iodine stability in salt fortified with ferrous fumarate and potassium iodide" by Diosady L.L. et. al., in Food Research International, 2002, Volume 35, Issue 7, pp 635-642 wherein potassium iodide and potassium iodate were encapsulated in modified starches, gelatin, sodium hexametaphosphate and purified sodium chloride by spray drying and fluidized bed drying to produce microcapsules containing 0.3 to 2% iodine. The most stable combination, containing 50 mg iodine and 1000 mg iron per kg salt, retained more than 75% of the added iodine for a year at 40°C, 100% RH. The authors have not given data<br>
on stability of iodine for singly fortified salt but even if it were very stable, the process of micro encapsulation is expensive.<br>
Reference may be made to the paper entitled "Synthesis, thermal investigations and solubility of a new double salt K2Mg(I03)4.2H20" by D. Rabadjieva and M. Maneva in Thermochimica Acta, 1997, Vol 293, pp 117-123, which describe the thermal properties of the new IO3-containing double salt. There is no mention of its suitability, if any, as an iodizing agent. Moreover, the high local concentration of iodine would make it difficult to guarantee uniform distribution in the product while ensuring a total iodine not exceeding 30 ppm.<br>
Reference may be made to the paper entitled "The properties of salt-filled sodahtes. Part 4. Synthesis and heterogeneous reactions of lodate-enclathrated sodahte." By Joseph Christian Buhl, in "Thermochimica Acta, 1996, Vol 286, pp 251-262, where in sodalite solid solution NagtAlSiO4](IO3).2-x(OH2O); (0.7 <x is produced from the system na2o-2sio2-al2o3-naio3-h2o under hydrothermal conditions. mam disadvantage of this kind compound for its use as iodising agent in preparation iodised salt high alkalinity that would make it unsuitable pharmaceutical or food application. further concentration lodate too even distribution edible salt.></x>
Reference may be made to the paper entitled " Anionic clay minerals" by W.T.Reichle, in Chemtech, January 1986, pp58-63 which descnbes the structure and properties of hydrotalcites which are layered anionic clays bearing the chemical composition [Mg6Al2(OH)i6CO3.4H.20]. These materials are used widely in antacid formulations as well as other applications such as halogen scavenger, adsorbent for wastewater treatment, stabilizer in poly-vinyl chloride and fire-retardant. There is no report however of the use of such materials for the preparation of iodizing agent.<br>
Reference may be made to the paper entitled " Adsorption behavior of IO3" by CO32" and NO32" - hydrotalcite" by Takashi Toraishi et. al. in Applied Clay Science, 2002, 22, pp 17-23, wherein the adsorption behavior of lodate by hydrotalcite type compounds with CO3 (HTCO3) and NO3 (HTNO3) was studied for their application in removal of lodate from radioactive waste for disposal. The authors found that HTNO3 can adsorb iodate but no mention is made of the possible use of such methodology for preparation of iodizing agent. Moreover, HTNO3 is not recommended for edible purpose.<br>
Reference may be made to P.M.Oza et. al. in Indian patent application No. 1053/DEL/2000, where in an improved process for the preparation of Hydrotalcite from bittern-mother liquor left after separation of salt- has been disclosed. The hydrotalcite contains carbonate anion and no attempt was made to substitute the carbonate with other anions.<br>
Reference may be made to the paper entitled "The use of Hydrotalcite as an anion adsorbent" by Linda M. Parker et. al. in Ind. Eng. Chem Res. 1995, 34, ppll96-1202 where in use of fired and non fired HTCO3 for adsorption of anions like CI", Br", NO3", HPO4", SO4" and borate was studied carried out.

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the iodine content of the iodised salt using novel iodizing agent subjected to stability studies was 30ppm. Detailed description of the invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a modified hydrotalcite composition containing iodate anion is prepared and utilised for the preparation of iodized salt having greater stability of iodine Hydrotalcite (Mg6Al2(OH)16CO3.4H2O) is a naturally occurring mineral known for its antacid properties. However, natural form is not pure enough and occurs in small deposits. So, proprietary processes have developed synthetic hydrotalcite for pharmaceutical industry as antacid. Synthetic hydrotalcite is anionic clay. Here cationic layer is crystalline magnesium hydroxide (brucite) in which aluminium cation partially substitutes for magnesium cation. This substitution gives rise to a positive charge which is neutralised by exchangeable carbonate   and /or sulphate<br>
anion in the anionic layer for synthetic hydrotalcite and magaldrate, respectively for their use in antacid formulations.<br>
The hydrotalcite (HTCO3) is prepared from magnesium rich bittern—the mother liquor left out after separation of salt from the bnne by solar evaporation—by known technique in the prior art and grinding to pass through 60 BSS mesh. The synthetic hydrotalcite suitable for pharmaceutical application and having molar ratio of MgO: AI2O3 in the range of 7.7 to 4.6, XRD pattern having intensity peaks (A0) 7.77, 3.87, 2.57, 1.53, 1.50, 1.42 and sharp IR absorption peak of interlayer carbonate ions ca. 1360cm"1 was used for the preparation of stable iodizing agent.<br>
The hydrotalcite powder is calcined at 450-550°C for 30-75 minutes in a furnace to decompose the carbonate and drive off carbon dioxide. The calcined hydrotalcite is cooled to 60-80°C. A solution of potassium lodate having concentration<br>
in the range of 0.005-0.022M is prepared in distilled water and heated to 60°C-80°C to<br>
expel dissolved carbon dioxide. The calcined and cooled hydrotalcite is added to this solution at 60-80°C and stirred for five minutes maintaining the said temperature. The stirring is given for one minute at an interval of 30 minute. After one hour, the slurry is filtered. The solid is washed with distilled water to make it free from adhering electrolytes. The solid is dried at 80-110°C. The dried solid is ground and passed through 60 BSS mesh.. The prepared hydrotalcite is mixed with solar salt to contain 30ppm of iodine in the resultant salt.<br>
The iodine estimation was carried out using classical method of lodometry The analysis of magnesium content was carried out using EDTA compleximetry titration. Aluminium was estimated employing gravimetric method by precipitating as aluminum hydroxide and weighing the fired precipitates as AI2O3. Powder XRD pattern was taken in the range of 29 = 5-70°. IR spectra were taken using KBr pellets in the frequency range of 4000-400 cm"1. Potassium ions were estimated using flame photometnc technique.<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of a novel and stable iodizing agent suitable for iodine stability in iodised salt. This iodizing agent was prepared by intercalation of lodate ions, available from aqueous solution of alkali metal salt, in the interlayer space of synthetic pharma grade hydrotalcite. The method of the present invention does not require any special device and the use of spray technique, conventionally used for direct lodization of common salt dispensed with.   The lodate<br>
ions in the interlayer space impart enhanced stability to iodine. In the present invention, the absorption of lodate ions, in the interlayer space of synthetic hydrotalcite, for enhanced stability, is not reported in the prior art. Besides, no reference is cited of the use of calcined hydrotalcite for preparing iodine stable iodizing agent. The inventive steps adopted in the present invention are (1) intercalation of lodate anions (85%) in the interlayer space of hydrotalcite obviates the need of direct lodization by conventional agent viz potassium lodate; (n) the stability of iodine is maintained and it prevents the loss of iodine due to moisture, temperature and metal salt; (in) absorption of iodate ions in the interlayer space of calcined hydrotalcite dispenses the use of micro-encapsulation of potassium iodide and potassium iodate in modified starch, gelatin , sodium hexa meta phosphate and purified sodium chloride; (IV) preparing iodizing agent in aqueous solution kept at 70°C and at atmosphenc pressure, dispenses with the need of hydrothermal treatment; (v) the iodizing agent can be dried at 80 to 100 °C and obviates the need of spray dying or fluidized bed drying.<br>

1.43 gm of iodate containing hydrotalcite prepared in Example-1 was mixed thoroughly and uniformly with 1 kg of solar salt, which is ground and sieved to obtain fraction of-32+70 BSS mesh. The salt used was having impurity of Ca-0.09% (w/w), Mg-0.065%(w/w), SO4-0.15%(w/w), Insoluble- 0.05%(w/w), Moisture- 0.53%(w/w) The iodized salt so prepared contains 30 ppm of iodine. One of the best brand iodized salt was obtained from the market and used as control salt sample, which was analyzed for its iodine content and found to contain 39ppm of iodine. 50 gm of salt samples prepared from above were kept in oven at 100°C for 96 hours and iodine content was measured every 24 hours. The salt containing iodine in the form of hydrotalcite equivalent to 30 ppm of iodine retained all the iodine without any loss. The branded salt, which contained 39 ppm of iodine, found to contain 31 ppm of iodine at the end of 96 hours incurring loss of iodine of 21%. The advantages of the present invention are :<br>
