				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for coding a binary shape signal; and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for adaptive coding a binary shape signal.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In digital video systems such as video-telephone and teleconference systems, a large amount of digital data is needed to define each video frame signal since the video frame signal comprises a sequence of digital data referred to as pixel values.<br>
Since, however, the available frequency bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited, in order to transmit the substantial amount of digital data therethrough, it is necessary to compress or reduce the volume of the data through the use of various data compression techniques, especially, in the case of such low bit-rate video signal encoders as video-telephone and teleconference systems.<br>
One of such techniques for encoding video signals for a low bit-rate encoding system is an object-oriented analysis-synthesis coding technique, wherein an input video image is<br>
- 1A-<br><br>
divided into objects; and three sets of parameters for defining the motion, contour and pixel data of each object are processed through different encoding channels.<br>
One example of such object-oriented coding scheme is the so-called MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) phase 4 (MPEG-4), which is designed to provide an audio-visual coding standard for allowing content-based interactivity, improved coding efficiency and/or universal accessibility in such applications as low-bit rate communication, interactive multimedia (e.g., games, interactive TV, etc.) and area surveillance.<br>
According to MPEG-4, an input video image is divided into a plurality of video object planes (VOP's), which correspond to entities in a bitstream that a user can access and manipulate. A VOP can be referred to as an object and represented by a bounding rectangle whose width and height may be a smallest multiples of 16 pixels (a macroblock size) surrounding each object so that the encoder may process the input video image on a VOP-by-VOP basis.<br>
A VOP described in MPEG-4 includes shape information and color information consisting of luminance and chrominance data, wherein the shape information is represented by, e.g., a binary mask and related to the luminance data. In the binary mask, a designated binary value, -,e.g., 0, is used to represent a pixel, i.e., a background pixel, located outside the object in the VOP and another binary value, e.g., 255, is<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
used to indicate a pixel, i.e., an object pixel inside the object. A binary shape signal, representing the location and shape of the objects, can be expressed by a binary alpha block (BAB) within a frame or a VOP, e.g., a block of 16x16 binary pixels, wherein each binary pixel has a binary value, e.g., 0 representing a background pixel or 255 representing an object pixel.<br>
A BAB can be encoded by using a conventional bit-map-based shape coding method such as a context-based arithmetic encoding (CAE) method. In detail, in an intra mode, a BAB in a current frame (or VOP) is encoded by using an intra CAE method to thereby generate an encoded BAB, wherein in the intra CAE method, a context value of a binary pixel in the BAB within the current frame is obtained by using context values of binary pixels surrounding the binary pixel of the BAB in the current frame (or VOP).<br>
And in an inter mode, a BAB in a current frame (or VOP) is encoded by using a predetermined one of an intra CAE method and an inter CAE method to thereby generate an encoded BAB, wherein in the inter CAE method, a context value of a binary . pixel of the BAB in the current frame is obtained by using context values of binary pixels surrounding the binary pixel in the current frame (or VOP) and context values of binary pixels within a previous frame (or VOP) (see MPEG-4 Video Verification Model Version 7.0, International Organization for Standardization, Coding of Moving and Associated Audio<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
Information, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG97/N1642, Bristol, April 1997, pp 28-30). Meanwhile, in the conventional binary shape encoding method, instead of encoding all of the binary pixel values to generate encoded binary pixel values to be transmitted, a mode signal representing or characterizing a corresponding encoding condition for the BAB is encoded to improve the coding efficiency, thereby generating and then transmitting a corresponding encoded mode signal.<br>
In this respect, according to a conventional mode coding method, in encoding a BAB, one mode signal representing one of 7 number of modes as listed in the following [TABLE. 1] is given to the BAB and then encoded as a corresponding encoded mode signal to be transmitted.<br>
Referring to [TABLE.1], there are 7 number of mode signals. Namely, there are a first mode signal representing that a motion vector difference for shape (MVDs) of the BAB is defined as zero and the binary pixel values within the BAB have not been coded, wherein the MVDs is a difference between a motion vector (MV) of the BAB and a motion vector predictor for shape (MVPs) for the BAB; a second mode signal representing that the MVDs is not defined as zero and the binary pixel values within the BAB have not been coded; a third mode signal representing that all of the binary pixels within the BAB are defined as background pixels; a fourth mode signal representing that all of the binary pixels within the BAB are defined as object pixels; a fifth mode signal<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
representing that the binary pixel values within the BAB have been intra CAE coded; a sixth mode signal representing that the MVDs is defined as zero and the binary pixel values within the BAB have been inter CAE coded; and a seventh mode signal representing that the MVDs is not defined as zero and the binary pixel values within the BAB have been inter CAE coded (see MPEG-4 Video Verification Model Version 7.0, International Organization for Standardization, Coding of Moving And Associated Audio Information, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG97/N1642, Bristol, April 1997, pp 20-22).<br>

Conventional binary shape signal encoding methods employing the conventional mode coding method described above are basically progressive coding methods. Namely, in the conventional binary shape encoding methods, an interlaced coding technique performed by using field-by-field basis motion estimation method has not been used. Hence, even if spatial and/or temporal correlation between frames is lower<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
than that between fields, the interlaced coding technique has not been employed, thereby limiting the enhancing capability of the coding efficiency thereof.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for adaptive coding a binary shape signal by performing progressive coding and interlaced coding on the binary shape signal adaptively.<br>

A current frame 320 including a top field 325 and a bottom field 330 and a previous frame 300 including a previous top field 305 and a previous bottom field 310 are shown in Fig. 3 for use in explaining an apparatus for adaptive coding a binary shape<br>
-8-<br><br>
signal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus 100 for adaptive coding a binary alpha block (BAB) of MxN binary pixels within a current frame based on the current frame and a previous frame including a plurality of BAB's, M and N being positive integers, typically 16's, respectively, wherein each frame has a top field and a bottom field, each BAB has a top BAB-field and a bottom BAB-field and each binary pixel has a binary value representing either an object pixel or a background pixel. It should be noticed here that the top field represents an even field including only even lines of the frame and the bottom field represents an odd field including only odd lines of the frame or vice versa, wherein each line of the frame has a sequence of pixel values.<br>
The apparatus 100 comprises a first decision circuit 110, a first BAB-field motion estimation (ME) circuit 120, a second decision circuit 130, a second BAB-field ME circuit 140, a third decision circuit 160, a BAB-field coding circuit 170, a BAB-frame coding circuit 180, a fourth decision circuit 190 and a multiplxer (MUX) 196. The first BAB-field ME circuit 120 includes a first top BAB-field ME circuit 121 and a first bottom BAB-field ME circuit 122. The second BAB-field ME circuit 140 includes a second top BAB-field ME circuit 141 and a second bottom BAB-field ME circuit 142. And the fourth decision circuit 190 includes a BAB-field coding circuit 192,<br>
-9 -<br><br>
a data bit calculating circuit 193, a comparator 194 and a<br>
selector 195 as shown in Fig. 2.	<br>
It should be noticed here that the current frame and the previous frame may be replaced by a current video object plane (VOP) and a previous VOP, respectively. For simplicity, referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the apparatus 100 for adaptive coding a BAB within a current frame will be described herein only based on the current frame and a previous frame.<br>
First, in an inter mode, a BAB within the current frame, e.g., 320, is inputted to the first decision circuit 110 via a line L5. And at the same time, a previous top field, e.g., 305, of the previous frame, e.g., 300, is coupled to the first top BAB-field ME circuit 121 and the second bottom BAB-field ME circuit 142 through a line L1 and a previous bottom field, e.g., 310, of the previous frame, e.g., 300, is coupled to the first bottom BAB-field ME circuit 122 and the second top BAB-field ME circuit 141 through a line L2. <br>
The first decision circuit 110 decides to encode a BAB within the current frame on a BAB-frame by BAB-frame basis, i.e., on a BAB-by-BAB basis under a first condition that all of the binary pixels within the BAB are defined either as background pixels or as object pixels and decides to encode the BAB on a BAB-field by BAB-field basis under a second condition that all of the binary pixels within one of the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field are defined either as background pixels or as object pixels when the first condition<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
is not satisfied. And the first decision circuit 110 provides the lop BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field under a third condition that neither the first nor the second conditions is satisfied. In detail, the first decision circuit 110 for decoding to encode a BAB within the current frame on a BAB-by-BAB basis. if nil of the binary pixels within the BAB are defined either as background pixels (in this case, the BAB is characterized as ALL_0) or as object pixels (in this case, the BAB is characterized as ALL_255), decides to encode the BAB on a BAB-by-BAB basis to thereby generate either a mode signal FR-3 if the BAB is characterized as ALL_0 or a mode signal FR-4 if BAB is characterized as ALL_255. And then, the first decision circuit 110 provides either the mode signal FR-3 or FR-4 to the BAB-frame coding circuit ISO via a line L10.<br>
From now on, for simplicity, it is assumed that it all of the binary pixels within a BAB-field, i.e., cither a top BAB-field or a bottom BAB-field are defined as background pixels, the BAB-field is characterized as ALLJ) and if all of binary pixels within a BAB-field are defined as object pixels the BAB-field is characterized as ALL 255. And it should be noticed here that a conventional method which is well known in the art is used to determine whether all of the binary pixels within (or a BAB-field) can be defined as either background pixels or object pixels.<br>
If the BAB is characterized neither as ALL_0 nor ALL_255, the first decision circuit 110 divides the BAB into a top BAB-<br>
-11-<br><br>
Filed and a bottom BAB-field of the BAB. And then the first decision circuit 110, if the top BAB-field is characterized either as ALL.0 or as ALL.255, decides to encode the BAB on a BAB-field by BAB-field basis to thereby generate either a mode signal T-3 if the top BAB-field is characterized as ALL.O or a mode signal T-4 if the top BAB-field is characterized as ALL 255. And then, the first decision circuit 110 provides either the mode signal T-3 or T-4 to the BAB-field coding circuit 170 via a line L7.<br>
And at the same time, the first decision circuit 110, if the bottom BAB-field is characterized either as ALL0 or as ALL.255, decides to encode the BAB on a BAB-field by BAB-field basis to thereby generate either a mode signal B-3 if the bottom BAB-field is characterized as ALL.O or a mode signal B-4 if the bottom BAB field is characterized as ALL.255. And then, the first decision circuit 110 provides either the mode signal B-3 or B-4 lo the BAB-field coding circuit 170 via the line L7.<br>
Meanwhile, the fist decision circuit 110, if none of the mode signals FR-3, FR-4, T-3, T-4, B-3 and B-4 is generated therein, provide?  the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field to the first top BAB-field ME circuit 121 and the first bottom BAB-field ME circuit 122 via a line L11 and a line L12, respectively.<br>
The first top BAB-field ME circuit 121 and then if a top BAB-field identical to a top BAB-field among top BAB-field s providing first top BAB-field motion vectior (MV) representing a displacement between the first predicted BAB-field and top BAB-field transmits the top BAB-field to the second decision circuit 130 and the third<br>
-12-<br><br>
decision circuit 160 via a line L13 and then performs a first top BAB-field ME on a top BAB-field within the top field, e.g., 325, based on a previous top field, e.g., 305, through a path TT as shown in Fig. 3. And the first bottom BAB-field ME circuit 122 transmits the bottom BAB-field to the second decision circuit 130 and the third decision circuit 160 via a line L14 and then performs a first bottom BAB-field ME for a bottom BAB-field within the bottom field, e.g., 330, based on a previous bottom field, e.g., 310, through a path BB as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In detail, if a top BAB-field identical to the top BAB-field inputted thereto via the line L11 is detected among the top BAB-field's in a previous top field (in this case, the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE) as a first predicted top BAB-field, the first top BAB-field ME circuit 121 provides a first top BAB-field motion vector (MV) representing the displacement between the first predicted top BAB-field and the top BAB-field to the second decision circuit 130 and the third decision circuit 160 through the line L13.<br>
And, if a bottom BAB-field identical to the bottom BAB-field inputted thereto via the line L12 is detected among the bottom BAB-field's in a previous bottom field (in this case, the bottom BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE) as a first predicted bottom BAB-field, the first bottom BAB-field ME circuit 122 provides a first bottom BAB-field MV representing the displacement between the first predicted bottom BAB-field<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
and the bottom BAB-field to the second decision circuit 130 and the third decision circuit 170 through the line L14.<br>
The second decision circuit 130 decides to encode the top BAB-field and the' bottom BAB-field on a BAB-by-BAB basis if there exists a first predicted top BAB-field MV which is identical to a first bottom BAB-field MY (in this case, each of the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field is characterized as MV_IDENTICAL).<br>
In detail in the case that the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE and as MV_IDENT1CAL, the second decision circuit 130 provides the first predicted top BAB-field which is identical to the first bottom BAB-field MV as a first MV. And at the same time the second decision circuit 130 generates a mode signal FR-N1 informing that the first MV exists. And then the second decision circuit 130 provides the first MV and the mode signal FR-N1 to the BAB-frame coding circuit 180 via a line L15.<br>
But, if there does not exist a first MV, the second decision circuit 130 if there exists a first predicted top BAB-filed MY which is identical to bottom BAB-field MV provides the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field of the BAB within the current frame to the second top BAB-field ME circuit 141 and the second bottom BAB-field ME circuit 142 in the second BAB-field ME circuit 140 via a line L17 and a line L18, respectively.<br>
The second top BAB-field ME circuit 141 performs ME on the top BAB-field within the top filed, e.g., 325, based on the previous bottom filed, e.g., 310, through a path BT as<br>
-14-<br><br>
shown in Fig. 3. And the second bottom BAB-field ME circuit 142 performs ME on the bottom BAB-field within the bottom field, e.g., 330, based on the previous top filed, e.g., 330, based on the previous top field, e.g.. 305, through a path TB as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In detail, if a bottom BAB-field identical to the top BAB-field inputted thereto through the line L17 is detected among the bottom BAB-fields in the previous bottom field (in this case, the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE) as a second predicted top BAB-field, the second top BAB-field ME circuit 141 provides a second top BAB-field MV representing the displacement between the second predicted top BAB-field and the top BAB-field to the third decision circuit, 160 via a line 1,19.<br>
And if a top BAB-field identical to the bottom BAB-filed inputted thereto through the line L18 is detected among the top BAB-field's m the previous top field (in this case, the bottom BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE) as a second predicted bottom BAB-field, the second bottom BAB-field MB circuit 142 provides a second bottom BAB-field MV representing the displacement between the second predicted bottom BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field to the third decision circuit 160 through a line L20.<br>
The third decision circuit 160 checks whether there exist a first and a second top BAB-field MV's and a first and a second bottom BAB-field MV's inputted thereto decides to encode the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field on a BAB-BAB basis if there exists a second top BAB-field MV which is identical to a second bottom BAB-field MV (in this case, each of the top BAB-<br>
-15-<br><br>
field and the bottom BAB-field is characterized as MV_IDENTICAL).<br>
In detail, in the case that the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE and as MV_IDENTICAL, the third decision circuit 160 provides the second top BAB-field MV which is identical to the second bottom BAB-field MV as a second MV and generates a mode signal FR-N2 informing that the second MV exists. And then the third decision circuit 160 provides the second MV and the mode signal FR-N2 to the BAB-frame coding circuit 180 via a line L21.<br>
But, if there does not exist a second MV, the third decision circuit 160 checks whether there exist a first and a second top BAB-field MV's and a first and a second bottom BAB-field MV's inputted thereto. And then, the third decision circuit 160 decides to encode the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field on a BAB-by-BAB basis by using a conventional BAB-frame coding method or BAB coding method performed by employing frame-by-frame basis ME technique if there exists neither a first predicted top BAB-field MV nor a second top BAB-field MV inputted thereto (in this case, the top BAB-field is characterized as UPDATE) and at the same time there exists neither a first bottom BAB-field MV nor a second bottom BAB-field MV inputted thereto (in this case, the bottom BAB-field is characterized as UPDATE). In this case, the third decision circuit 160 combines the top BAB-field with the bottom BAB-field to thereby provide the BAB to the BAB-frame coding<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
circuit 180 via a line L22.<br>
And if there exists at least one of the first and the second top BAB-field MV's and the first and the second bottom BAB-field MV's when there is no second MV inputted thereto, the third decision circuit 160 decides to encode the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field on a BAB-field by BAB-field basis by using a BAB-field coding method performed by using field-by-field basis ME technique to thereby provide the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field of the BAB within the current frame to the BAB-field coding circuit 170 via a line L23.<br>
Further, if either the first and the second top BAB-field MV's are inputted thereto or only the first top BAB-field MV thereof is inputted thereto, the third decision circuit 160 provides the first top BAB-field MV to the BAB-field coding circuit 170 and generates a control signal CT1 to be transmitted to the BAB-field coding circuit 170.

And the BAB-field coding circuit 170, if none of the mode signal T-3, the mode signal, the control signal CT1 and the control signal CT2 is generated, encodes the top BAB-field by using a predetermined one of an intra context based arithmetic encoding (CAE) method and an inter CAE method to thereby generate encoded top BAB-field binary pixel data and at the same time generates a mode signal to the top BAB-field and then encodes the mode signal as an encoded mode signal. And then, the BAB-field coding circuit 170 combines the encoded top BAB-field binary pixel data with the encoded mode signal corresponding thereto to thereby produce an encoded top BAB-field to be transmitted to the MUX 196 through the line L24. And the BAB-field coding circuit 170, if none of the mode signal B-3, the mode signal B-4, the control CB1 and the control signal CB2 is generated, encodes the bottom BAB-field by using the predetermined one of the intra CAE method and the inter CAE method to thereby generate encoded bottom BAB-field binary pixel data and at the same time generates a mode signal to the bottom BAB-field and then encodes the mode signal as an encoded mode signal. And then, the BAB-field coding circuit 170 combines the encoded bottom BAB-field binary pixel data with the encoded mode signal corresponding thereto to thereby produce an encoded bottom BAB-field to be transmitted<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
to the MUX 196 through the line L24.<br>
Meanwhile, the BAB-frame coding circuit 180, if the mode signals FR-3 and FR-4 are inputted thereto through the line L10, encodes the mode signals FR-3 and FR-4 to thereby provide encoded mode signals [FR-3] and [FR-4] as encoded BAB's, respectively, to the MUX 196 via a line L25.<br>
And the BAB-frame coding circuit 180, if the mode signal FR-N1 is inputted thereto via the line L15, checks by using the conventional checking method based on a predetermined MVPs corresponding thereto and the first MV inputted thereto whether the MVDs corresponding thereto is 0 or not and then generates a mode signal FR-1 if the MVDs is 0 and a mode signal FR-2 if the MVDs is not 0.<br>

L25.<br>
And the BAB-frame coding circuit 180, if the mode signal FR-N2 is inputted thereto via the line L21, checks by using the conventional checking method based on a predetermined MVPs corresponding thereto and the second MV inputted thereto<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
whether the MVDs corresponding thereto is 0 or not and then generates a mode signal FR-1' if the MVDs is 0 and a mode signal FR-2' if the MVDs is not 0.<br>

Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a detailed block diagram of the fourth decision circuit 190 shown in Fig. 1. The BAB-field coding circuit 192 in the fourth decision circuit 190 encodes the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB field by using the BAB-field coding method in a same manner as that performed at the BAB-field coding circuit 170 to thereby produce an encoded top BAB-field and an encoded bottom BAB-field and then generate a formatted encoded BAB obtained by combining the encoded top BAB-field with the encoded bottom BAB-field. Then the BAB-field coding circuit 192 provides the formatted encoded BAB to the data bit calculating circuit 193 and the selector 195 via a line L28.<br>
Meanwhile, the encoded BAB is transmitted to the data bit calculating circuit 193 and the selector 195 via the line L26.

In the above, the apparatus 100 for adaptive coding a binary shape signal in accordance with the present invention is described for the case of the inter mode. In case of an intra mode, only the first decision circuit 110, the BAB-frame coding circuit 180, a fourth decision circuit 190 and the MUX 196 in the apparatus 100 perform their functions described<br>
- 25 -<br><br>
above except for the followings described below.<br>
Namely, the first decision circuit 110 provides a BAB inputted thereto via the line L5 to the BAB-frame coding circuit 180 through the line L10 if neither a mode signal FR-3 nor a mode signal FR-4 is generated therein and then the BAB-frame coding circuit 180 encodes the BAB by using the intra CAE method to thereby provide an encoded BAB to the MUX 196 via the line L25.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4A and 4B, there are depicted flow charts for use in describing a method for adaptive coding a binary shape signal in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. From now on, referring to Figs. 4A and 4B, a method or a process for adaptive coding a binary signal in accordance with the present invention will be briefly described by using the terms has been defined in the description of the apparatus 100.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for adaptive coding a BAB of MxN binary pixels within a current frame based on the current frame and a previous frame, M and N being positive integers, respectively, wherein each of the current and the previous frames includes a plurality of BAB's, each frame has a top field and a bottom field, each BAB has a top BAB-field and a bottom BAB-field and each binary pixel has a binary value representing either an object pixel or a background pixel<br>
First, in an inter mode, at step ST1, if a BAB within the<br>
- 26 -<br><br>
current frame is characterized as either A11_0 or All_255, the process proceeds to step ST13. But, at step ST1, if the BAB is characterized as neither All__0 nor All_255, the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field of the BAB are generated. And then, the process flows to step ST2.<br>
At step ST2, if either the top BAB-field or the bottom BAB-field is characterized as either All_0 or All_255, the process proceeds to step ST15. But, at step ST2, if none of the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field is characterized as either All_0 or All_255, the process flows to step ST3.<br>
At step ST3, a first BAB-field ME including a first top BAB-field ME and a first bottom BAB-field ME is performed. In the first BAB-field ME, if the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE, a first top BAB-field MV is generated. And in the first bottom BAB-field ME, if the bottom BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE, a first bottom BAB-field MV is generated. Then the process goes to step ST5.<br>
At step ST5, in case that the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE together with as MV_IDENTICAL, a first MV is generated and at the same time a mode signal FR-N1 is generated. And then the process proceeds to step ST13. But, at step ST5, if a first MV is not generated, the process goes to step ST7.<br>
At step ST7, a second BAB-field ME including a second top BAB-field ME and a second bottom BAB-field ME is performed. In the second top BAB-field ME, if the top BAB-field is<br>
- 27 -<br><br>
characterized as NO_UPDATE, a second top BAB-field MV is generated. And in the second bottom BAB-field ME, if the bottom BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE, a second bottom BAB-field MV is produced. Thereafter, the process goes to step ST9.<br>
At step ST9, in case that the top BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE together with as MV_IDENTICAL, a second MV is generated and at the same time a mode signal FR-N2 is generated. And then the process proceeds to step ST13. But, at step ST9, if a second MV is not generated, the process flows to step ST11.<br>
At step ST11, it is checked that whether there exists a first and a second top BAB-field MV's and a first and a second bottom BAB-field MV's and then it is decided to encode the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field by using the BAB-frame coding method if none of a first and a second top BAB-field MV's and a first and a second bottom BAB-field MV's exists, i.e., both of the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field are characterized as UPDATE. In this case, the top BAB-field is combined with the bottom BAB-field to thereby provide the BAB and then the process goes to step ST13.<br>
But, at step ST11, it is decided to encode the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field by using the BAB-field coding method to thereby provide the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field of the BAB within the current frame if at least one of the first and the second top BAB-field MV's and the first<br>
- 28 -<br><br>
and the second bottom BAB-field MV's exist, i.e., at least one of the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field is characterized as NO_UPDATE. Then, the process flows to step ST15.<br>
At step ST15, BAB-field coding on the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB-field is performed. Then the process is ended. Here, the detailed description for the BAB-field coding is omitted since it has been fully described in the description for the BAB-field coding circuit 170 in the apparatus 100.<br>
Meanwhile, at step ST13, BAB-frame coding on the BAB is performed. Then the process proceeds to step ST17 through a tap A. Here, the detailed description for the BAB-field coding is also omitted since it has been fully described in the description for the BAB-frame coding circuit 180 in the apparatus 100.<br>
At step ST17, if the BAB is characterized as either INTRA CAE or INTER CAE, the process proceeds to step ST19 and if otherwise, the process is ended.<br>
At step ST19, the BAB is divided into a top BAB-field and a bottom BAB field and then the top BAB-field and the bottom BAB field are encoded by using BAB-field coding method in a same manner as that performed at step ST15 to thereby produce an encoded top BAB-field and an encoded bottom BAB-field, respectively. Then the process flows to step ST21.<br>
At step ST21, first, a formatted encoded BAB is produced by combining the encoded top BAB-field with the encoded bottom BAB-field. And then, first data bit and second data bit for<br>
- 29 -<br><br>
the encoded BAB and the formatted encoded BAB are calculated to thereby generate a first number of data bit and a second number of data bit, respectively. Thereafter, the process goes to step ST23.<br>
At step ST23, the first number of data bit is compared with the second number of data bit. The encoded BAB is selected as a selected encoded BAB if the first number of data bit is less than the second number of data bit, and if otherwise, the formatted encoded BAB is selected as a selected encoded BAB. Then the process is ended.<br>
As described above, in the apparatus and the method for adaptive coding a binary shape signal in accordance with the present invention, a BAB within a frame (or a VOP) is coded by using BAB-by-BAB basis coding (progressive coding) technique if the correlation between BAB's is higher than the correlation between BAB-field's and if otherwise, the BAB is coded by using BAB-field by BAB-field basis coding (interlaced coding) technique to thereby enhance the coding efficiency thereof.<br>

signal TT-2 if the MVDs is not 0; thereafter encoding the mode signal TT-1 to thereby provide an encoded mode signal as the encoded top BAB-field and encoding the MVDs for the top BAB-field and the mode signal TT-2 to generate an encoded MVDs for the top BAB-field and an encoded mode signal TT-2, respectively, and then combining the encoded MVDs with the encoded mode signal TT-2 to thereby provide the encoded top BAB-filed; and checking, in response to the control signal CT2, by using the conventional checking method based on the predetermined MVPs for the top BAB-filed and the second top BAB-field MV inputted thereto whether the MVDs for the top BAB-field is 0 or not and then generating a mode signal BT-1 if the MVDs is 0 and a mode signal BT-2 if the MVDs is not 0 and then encoding the mode signal BT-1 to thereby provide an encoded mode signal BT-1 as the encoded top BAB-field and encoding the MVDs for the top BAB-field and the<br>
-43-<br><br>
mode signal BT-2 to generate an encoded MVDs for the top BAB-field and an encoded made signal BT-2, respectively, and then combining the encoded MVDs with the encoded mode signal BT-2 to thereby provide the encoded top BAB-field.<br>
3.	The BAB-field coding circuit (170) as claimed in claim 2, performs<br>
checking, in response to the control signal CB1, by using the conventional checking method based on a predetermined MVPs for the bottom BAB-filed and the first bottom BAB-field MV inputted thereto whether the MVDs for the bottom BAB-field is 0 or not and then generating a mode signal BB-1 if the MVDs is 0 and a mode signal BB-2 if the MVDs is not 0; encoding the mode signal BB-1 to thereby provide an encoded mode signal BB-1 as the encoded bottom BAB-field and encoding the MVDs<br>
-44-<br><br>
for the bottom BAB-field and the mode signal BB-2 to generate an encoded MVDs for the bottom BAB-field and an encoded mode signal BB-2, respectively, and then combining the encoded MVDs with the encoded mode signal BB-2 to thereby provide the encoded bottom BAB-field; and checking, in response to the control signal CB2, by using the conventional checking method based on the predetermined MVPs for the bottom BAB-field an the second bottom BAB-field MV inputted thereto whether the MVDs for the bottom BAB-field is 0 or not and then generating a mode signal TB-1 if the MVDs is 0 and a mode signal TB-2 if the MVDs is not 0; thereafter encoding the mode signal TB-1 to thereby provide an encoded mode signal TB-1 as the encoded bottom BAB-field and encoding the MVDs for the bottom BAB-field and the mode signal TB-2 to generate an encoded MVDs for the bottom BAB-field and an encoded mode signal TB-2, respectively; and then combining the encoded MVDs with the<br>
-45-<br><br>
encoded mode signal TB-2 to thereby provide the encode bottom BAB-field.<br>
4.	The BAB-frame coding circuit (180) as claimed in claim 3 checks, if the<br>
mode signal FR-N1 is inputted thereto, whether the MVDs corresponding thereto is 0 or not based on a predetermined MVPs corresponding thereto and the first MV inputted thereto and then generates a mode signal FR-1 if the MVDs corresponding thereto is 0 and a mode signal FR-2 if the MVDs is not 0 and then encodes the mode signal FR-1 to provide an encoded mode signal FR-1 as an encoded BAB and thereafter encodes the MVDs corresponding thereto and the mode signal FR-2 to generate an encoded MVDs and an encoded mode signal FR-2, respectively, and then combines the encoded MVDs with the encoded mode signal FR-2 to thereby provide an encoded BAB; and checks, if the mode signal FR-N2 is inputted thereto, whether the MVDs corresponding thereto is 0 or not based on a predetermined MVPs<br>
-46-<br><br>
corresponding thereto and the second MV inputted thereto and then generates a mode signal FR-1' if the MVDs corresponding thereto is 0 and a mode signal FR-2' if the MVDs is not 0 and then encodes the mode signal FR-1' to provide an encoded mode signal FR-1' as an encoded BAB and thereafter encodes the MVDs corresponding thereto and the mode signal FR-2' to generate an encoded MVDs and an encoded mode signal FR-2, respectively, and then combines the encoded MVDs with the encoded mode signal FR-2 to thereby provide the encoded BAB.<br>
5.	The current and the previous frames as claimed in claim 4 are replaced<br>
