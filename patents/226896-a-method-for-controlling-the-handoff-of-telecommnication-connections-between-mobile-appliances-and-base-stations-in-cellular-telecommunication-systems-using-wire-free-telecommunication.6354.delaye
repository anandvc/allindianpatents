Telecommunications systems using wire-free telecommunication between mobile and/or stationary tranmitting/receiving appliances are specific message systems with a message transmission path between a message source and a message sink, in which, for example, base stations and mobile parts are used as transmitting and receiving appliances for processing and transmitting messages, and in which<br>
1)	the message processing and message transmission can be carried out in a preferred transmission direction (simplex operation) or in both transmission directions (duplex operation),<br>

Message is a generic term which covers not only the information content but also the physical representation of its signal. Despite a message having the same information content, different signal forms may occur. Thus, for example, a message relating to one item can be transmitted<br>
(1)	in the form of an image,<br>
(2)	as the spoken word,<br>
(3)	as the written word<br>
(4)	as an encrypted word or image.<br>
Transmission types (1) ... (3) are in this case normally characterized by continuous (analog) signals, while discontinuous signals (for example pulses, digital signals) normally occur in transmission type (4) .<br>
In telecommunications systems of the type mentioned above, the handover and handoff of an ongoing call or connection is a highly time-critical process, since the continuity of ongoing connections must be ensured. Particularly in telecommunications systems using wire-free telecommunication, various situations or cases occur in which a handover or a handoff is possible, or even necessary. Corresponding to these situations a distinction is drawn, for example, between an intracell handover, an intercell handover and an external handover etc.<br>
In order to carry out a handover, for example, a mobile transmitting/receiving appliance, for example a mobile station or a mobile part which is connected to a stationary transmitting/receiving appliance, for example a base station or a fixed part in a cell, requires cell-specific information about the adjacent cell, or about a number of adjacent cells. The method used to receive this information is referred to as monitoring, that is to say the mobile station monitors, for example, a control channel, the so-called Broadcast<br><br>
Control CHannel (BCCH) on which the cell-specific information mentioned above is broadcast by the base station.<br>
One problem relates to how the mobile station obtains the required cell-specific information and the current parameters, that is to say frequency, timeslot, code of the adjacent base station to which the connection is intended to be transferred by the handover procedure and to which the handover is then intended to be made, when the mobile station is in an uncoordinated, unlicensed scenario - for example in an arrangement where there are a large number of unsynchronized residential base stations - or in a purely coordinated, licensed cellular scenario - for example as in the TDD-UMTS system - and, due to a high data rate, virtually all the physical channels are occupied by data traffic and it is thus impossible to receive the Broadcast Control CHannel of the adjacent base stations.<br>
Figure 1 shows one possible UMTS scenario (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) with a naulticell universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS which operates using both the uncoordinated, unlicensed system mode and the coordinated, licensed system mode and includes both the scenarios mentioned above. The illustrated UMTS system has a first telecommunications subsystem TKTS1 which operates in first radio cells FZ1 using wire-free telecommunication between a first base station BS1, which is in the form of an indoor base station, and n (nN) first mobile stations, MSl....MSn, which are preferably in the form of indoor/outdoor mobile stations, and which system is operating in the uncoordinated, unlicensed system mode. Furthermore, the UMTS system has a second telecommunications subsystem TKST2, which operates in second radio cells FZ2, using wire-free telecommunication between a second base station BS2, which is in the form of an outdoor base station, and m<br><br>
(meN) second mobile stations MSn+1. . .MSn+m, which are preferably in the form of indoor/outdoor<br><br>
mobile stations, and which system is operating in the coordinated, licensed system mode.<br>
A further problem is how the monitoring for a handover from uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation to coordinated licensed system operation must appear.<br>
A mobile assisted handover is carried out in the known GSM scenario. The monitoring is in this case carried out by the mobile station during the free timeslots, that is to say the mobile station autonomously receives the Broadcast Control CHannels of the adjacent base stations, selects that base station whose reception quality is the best, and signals this to its own base station. The handover is in this case initiated by the mobile station and is controlled by the base station; this is therefore referred to as a mobile assisted handover. A factor which is of critical importance in this case is for the mobile station to have already received advance information from the network operator, on its active Broadcast Control CHannel on the frequencies to be searched for the Broadcast Control CHannels of the adjacent base stations.<br>
In contrast to the GSM scenario, a mobile initiated and mobile controlled handover is carried out in the known DECT scenario. The monitoring is in this case carried out by the mobile station, and the handover is likewise controlled by the mobile station. The mobile station in this case has no advance information about which channels - that is to say which frequencies/timeslots - must be looked for during monitoring for the Broadcast Control CHannels of the adjacent cells. The Broadcast Control CHannels, according to the DECT terminology, correspond to the channels in which the dummy bearer information is transmitted.<br><br>
A mobile assisted handover is likewise planned, as for the GMS scenario, for the cellular UMTS scenario, which is<br><br>
currently subject to standardization. The monitoring is carried out by the mobile part, and the handover is initiated by the mobile station and is controlled by the base station. It is highly probable that advance information from the network operator will also be required in this case about which channels [lacuna] (these are essentially the codes, since the frequency reuse is unity).<br>
In all the scenarios mentioned above, the monitoring is carried out by means of the mobile station.<br>
The problem of initial monitoring (information about channels on which the Broadcast Control CHannel of the adjacent cells can be received) has until now been solved in the cellular field by means of advance information provided in advance by the network operator and intended for the respective mobile station, with this advance information having been transmitted to the relevant mobile station by the active base station using the Broadcast Control CHannel. The only exception is the DECT scenario, since, in this case, there is no need for initial monitoring for the coordinated, licensed mode. It is thus necessary during cellular DECT operation for the mobile station to continuously scan adjacent frequencies looking for the Broadcast Control CHannel for an intercell handover. However, with respect to standby times, this is not an optimum solution [lacuna] asymmetric data services (allocation of a number of timeslots). In uncoordinated DECT operation, only an intracell handover is possible, so that there is no need for initial monitoring.<br>
In the past, no handover has existed from uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation to coordinated, licensed system operation (for example residential TDD-UMTS system to the public FDD-UMTS or public TDD-UMTS system.<br>
The object on which the invention based, in a cellular telecommunications system using wire-free<br><br>
telecommunication between mobile parts and base stations, is to provide for telecommunications connections to be handed off from<br><br>
uncoordinated, unlicensed operation of the telecommunications system (residential operation or private operation) to coordinated, licensed operation of the telecommunications system (public operation) and vice versa, with little energy being consumed in the mobile part and with little circuitry complexity in the mobile part.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of patent claim 1.<br>
The idea on which the invention is based is to carry out the initial monitoring problem, mentioned initially, in the base station (first base station) which supports uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation.<br>
This method offers the advantage that the Broadcast Control CHannel search by the first base station, which supports uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation and has no a priori knowledge about the conditions in the adjacent cells, need be carried out only once by base stations arranged in the adjacent cells, when the appliance is switched on, and then may be carried out once again only at relatively long periodic intervals (see the advantageous development as claimed in claim 2). This information is then signalled (for example using the Broadcast Control Channel) to the mobile part or to the mobile station.<br>
Fundamentally, the advantages for the mobile station are the reduced power consumption, the increase in the standby time, the fact that the initial monitoring is carried out by the first base station, and the reduced complexity in the case of pure residential mobile stations or indoor terminals (the complexity is integrated in the first base station).<br>
Since the first base station receives cell-specific information about the adjacent public cells only as a result of the initial monitoring (and, particularly for UMTS, a highly time-consuming computation process is required in order to detect<br><br>
a cell-specific scrambling code without advance information) a dual mode mobile station designed for indoor/outdoor purposes is for the first time able to carry out a particularly time-critical handover from indoor to outdoor.<br>
In the developments of the invention as claimed in claims 3 and 4, the essential idea is for the monitoring to be carried out in the outdoor and indoor base station. Where high asymmetric data rates are used (possible only in the TDD mode) , this procedure offers advantages both for the indoor to outdoor handover and for the intracell handover. The monitoring in the first base station can thus be used to provide an asymmetric service with a high downlink data rate and a low uplink data rate, and vice versa, as well as interference measurement on another carrier frequency and, if vrequired, to hand over the entire asymmetric connection to the other carrier frequency (interfrequency handover). An indoor to outdoor handover while maintaining the high data rate is likewise possible.<br>
If the monitoring functionality is integrated not only in the base station but also in the mobile station, then an asymmetric service with a low downlink data rate and a high uplink data rate can be handed over from one carrier frequency to a carrier (interfrequency handover). In this situation, the monitoring cannot be carried out by the base station since virtually all the timeslots are used for reception in this case - and the monitoring is in this case carried out by the mobile station.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention will be explained with reference to Figures 2 to 7, in which:<br>
Based on the UMTS scenario with the detail from a universal mobile telecommunications network and a<br><br>
universal mobile telecommunications system, as shown in Figure 1, which operates both in the uncoordinated, unlicensed system mode and in the coordinated, licensed system mode, Figure 2 shows a modified UMTS scenario with initial monitoring,<br>
Figures 3 to 7 show timeslot illustrations for the monitoring by the base stations BS1, BS2 and the mobile stations MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m.<br>
Based on the UMTS scenario with the detail from a universal mobile telecommunications network and a universal mobile telecommunications system, as shown in Figure 1, which operates both in the uncoordinated, unlicensed system mode and in the coordinated, licensed system mode, Figure 2 shows a modified UMTS scenario with initial monitoring,<br>
In the modified UMTS scenario, universal mobile telecommunications system, as shown in Figure 1, which operates both in the uncoordinated, unlicensed system mode and in the coordinated, licensed system mode, Figure 2 shows a modified UMTS scenario with initial monitoring, the first base station BS1 and the first mobile stations MSl...MSn - as in the UMTS scenario in Figure 1 - are located in the first radio cell FZ1. Adjacent to this first base station BS1 - in which case, for example, adjacency occurs, by definition, when the associated radio cells, the first radio cell FZ1 and the second radio cell FZ2, are adjacent to one another or overlap - there are, firstly, the second base station BS2, which is located in the second radio cell FZ2, which completely covers the first radio cell FZ1 with the first base station BS1, and, secondly, further second base stations BS1.1...BS1.6 which, although they are in the form of first base stations BS1 are referred to as further second base stations BS2 owing to their adjacency to the first base station BS1 in the first radio cell FZ1, and which second base stations BS1.1...BS1.6 are arranged in further second radio cells FZ1.1...FZ1.6, which are immediately<br><br>
adjacent to the first radio cell FZ1 with the first base station BS1 and are admittedly in the form of a first radio cell FZ1 but are referred to as further second radio cells FZ2 owing to the adjacency to the first radio cell FZ1 with the first base station BS1.<br><br>
For the initial monitoring, the first base station BS1, which supports uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation and is associated with the first cell, FZl, in a first monitoring mode receives messages which are relevant for handing off telecommunications connections and which are transmitted by at least one of the second base stations BS2, BS1.1...BSl.6 which are adjacent to the first base station BSl, support coordinated, licensed system operation or uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation and are each associated with the second cell FZ2, FZl.1...FZl.6, on in each case one first telecommunications channel which is in the form of the Broadcast Control CHannel BCCH.<br>
After this, the first base station BSl assesses the information content and reception quality of the received messages and transmits a list, organized on the basis of the reception quality, of parameters which are required for handing over the telecommunications connection and are each associated with one of the second base stations BS2, BSl.1...BSl.6, on a second telecommunications channel which is in the form of the Broadcast Control CHannel BCCH, to the first mobile stations MSl...MSn which are located in the first cell FZl.<br>
Figures 3 to 7 each use a timeslot representation with eight timeslots ZS1...ZS8 to show the monitoring scenario for the base stations BSl, BS2, BSl.1...BSl.6 and the mobile stations MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m. Common features of all the figures 3 to 7 are that the base stations BSl, BS2, BSl. 1. . .BSl. 6 use a first timeslot ZS1 as the Broadcast Control Channel BCCH, and that there is a bidirectional, asymmetric data link at a first frequency fl in each case between the base stations BSl, BS2 , BSl.1...BSl.6 and the mobile stations MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m, said data link in each case having a number of reception timeslots Rxl and transmission timeslots Txl and in each case extending over at least the timeslots<br><br>
ZS2...ZS6. Furthermore, for example, the expression M(f2), M(f3) in each case indicates that the base stations BS1, BS2,<br><br>
BS1.1...BS1.6 and/or the mobile stations MSl...MSn, MSn+1. . .MSn+m carry out monitoring M on a second frequency f2 or on a third frequency f3.<br>
In detail, said figures show the following information:<br>
Figure 3 shows that the mobile station MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m maintains a bidirectional, asymmetric data link with the reception timeslots Rxl and transmission timeslots Txl in the timeslots ZS1...ZS6 with the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1. . .BS1.6, that the base station BS1, BS2, BSl.1...BS1.6 maintains a further bidirectional data link to another mobile station in the timeslots ZS7, ZS8, and that the mobile station MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m initiates a second monitoring mode, for handing off information which is relevant to telecommunications networks, by monitoring M, for example, on the second frequency f2 in the timeslots ZS7, ZS8, in order to transmit the asymmetric data link at a maximum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the downlink direction and at a minimum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the uplink direction via the base stations BSl.1...BSl.6.<br>
Figure 4 shows that the mobile station MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m maintains a bidirectional, asymmetric data link with the reception timeslots Rxl and transmission timeslots Txl in the timeslots ZS1...ZS6 with the base station BSl, BS2, BSl.1...BSl.6, that the mobile station MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m initiates the second monitoring mode for handing off information which is relevant for telecommunications connections by monitoring M, for example, on the third frequency f3 in the timeslots ZS7, ZS8, in order to transmit the asymmetric data link at a maximum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the downlink direction and at a minimum data transmission rate, which can be<br><br>
predetermined, in the uplink direction via the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6, and that the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6 initiates the second monitoring mode for handing off information which is relevant for telecommunications connections by monintoring M<br><br>
for example, on the second frequency f2 in the timeslots ZS7, ZS8, in order to transmit the asymmetric data link at a maximum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the downlink direction and at a minimum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the uplink direction via the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6.<br>
Figure 5 shows that the mobile station MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m maintains a bidirectional asymmetric data link with the reception timeslots Rxl and transmission timeslots Txl in the timeslots ZS1...ZS7 with the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6, and that the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6 initiates the second monitoring mode for handing off information which is relevant to telecommunications connections by monitoring M, for example, on the second frequency f2 in the timeslot ZS8, in order to transmit the asymmetric data link at a maximum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the downlink direction and at a minimum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the uplink direction via the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6.<br>
Figure 6 shows that the mobile station MSl...MSn, MSn+1...MSn+m maintains a bidirectional asymmetric data link with the reception timeslots Rxl and transmission timeslots Txl in the timeslots ZS1...ZS7 with the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6, and that the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6 initiates the second monitoring mode for handing off information which is relevant to telecommunications connections by monitoring M, for example, on the second frequency f2 in the timeslot ZS8, in order to transmit the asymmetric data link at a minimum data transmission rate, which can be predetermined, in the downlink direction and at a maximum data transmission rate, which can be<br><br>
predetermined, in the uplink direction via the base station BS1, BS2, BS1.1...BS1.6.<br><br>

telecommunication system (UMTS) and in coordination, licensed operation of the telecommunication system (UMTS);<br>
-	receiving messages which are relevant in a first monitoring mode for handing off telecommunication connections by a first base station (BS1) which supports uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation and is associated with a first cell (FZ1);<br>
-	sending in each case the received messages by at least one second base station (Bs, BS1.1....BS1.6), which is adjacent to the first base station (BS1) on a first telecommunication channel which is in the form of a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), the second base station (BS, BS1.1 ...BS1.6) supporting coordinated, licensed system operation or uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation and is in each case associated with a second cell;<br>
-	assessing the information content and reception quality of the received messages, by the first base station (BS1); and<br>
• transmitting on a second telecommunication channel, being in the form of a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) to first mobile appliances (MSl....MSn) located in the first cell (FZ1) a list<br><br>
generated on the basis of the reception quality of parameters required for handing over the telecommunication connection and each being associatable with one of the second base stations (BS2, BS1.1....BS1.6).<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first monitoring mode is switched on at predetermined periodic time intervals, starting when the first base station (BS1) is switched on.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a second monitoring mode for handing off information relevant to telecommunication connections is initiated in one of the mobile appliance (MSL.MSn, MSn+l....MSn+m) and the base station (BS1, BS2, BS1.1....BS1.6) in order to transmit asymmetric data links, the asymmetric data link being transmitted at a maximum data transmission rate predeterminable in the downlink direction and at a minimum data transmission rate predeterminable in the uplink direction via the base station (BS1, BS2, BS1.1....BS1.6).<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein a second monitoring mode for handing off information relevant for telecommunication connections is initiated in the base station (BS1, BS2, BS1.1....BS1.6) in order to transmit asymmetric data links at a minimum data transmission rate predeterminable in the downlink direction, and at a maximum data transmission rate predeterminable in the uplink direction via the base station (BS1, BS2, BS1.1....BS1.6).<br>
5.	The method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein wire-free telecommunication is carried out using the CDMA, FDMA and /or TDMA access methods, and usinq the TDD and /or FDD principle<br><br>
This invention relates to a aim of the invention is to prepare the handover of telecommunication connections in a cellular telecommunications system having wireless telecommunication between mobile parts and base stations out of an uncoordinated unlicensed operation of the telecommunications system into a coordinated licensed operation of the telecommunications system and vice versa using low energy consumption of the mobile part and using a mobile part having less complex circuit engineering. To this end, an 'Initial Monitoring' is carried out in the base station which supports the uncoordinated, unlicensed system operation.</td>
