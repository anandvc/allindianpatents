NEW TOMAYMYCIN DERIVATIVES AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel cytotoxic agents and their<br>
therapeutic use. More specifically, the invention relates to novel cytotoxic<br>
agents comprising tomaymycin derivatives and their therapeutic use. These<br>
novel cytotoxic agents have therapeutic use as a result of delivering the<br>
tomaymycin derivatives to a specific cell population in a targeted fashion by<br>
chemically linking the tomaymycin derivative to a cell binding agent.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many reports have appeared on the attempted specific targeting of tumor<br>
cells with monoclonal antibody-drug conjugates (Sela et al, in Immuno-<br>
conjugates, 189-216 (C. Vogel, ed. 1987); Ghose et al, in Targeted Drugs 1-22<br>
(E. Goldberg, ed. 1983); Diener et al, in Antibody mediated delivery systems,<br>

systems, 25-53 (J. Rodwell, ed. 1988); Bumol et al, in Antibody mediated<br>
delivery systems, 55-79 (J. Rodwell, ed. 1988); G.A. Pietersz &amp; K. Krauer, 2,<br>

89-104 (1998); W.A. Blattler &amp; R.V.J. Chari, in Anticancer Agents, Frontiers in<br>
Cancer Chemotherapy, 317-338, ACS Symposium Series 796; and I. Ojima et<br>
al eds, American Chemical Society 2001}. All references and patents cited<br>

Cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin,<br>
vincristine, vinblastine, melphalan, mitomycin C, and chlorambucil have been<br>
conjugated to a variety of murine monoclonal antibodies. In some cases, the<br>
drug molecules were linked to the antibody molecules through an intermediary<br>
carrier molecule such as serum albumin (Garnett et al, 46, Cancer Res. 2407-<br>
2412 (1986); Ohkawa et al 23, Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 81-86 (1986);<br>
Endo et al, 47 Cancer Res. 1076-1080 (1980)), dextran (Hurwitz et al, 2 Appl.<br>
Biochem. 25-35 (1980); Manabi et al, 34 Biochem. Pharmacol. 289-291 (1985);<br><br>
Dillman et al, 46 Cancer Res., 4886-4891 (1986); Shoval et al , 85, Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci., 8276-8280 (1988)), or polyglutamic acid (Tsukada et al, 73, J. Natl.<br>
Canc. Inst., 721-729 (1984); Kato et al 27 J. Med. Chem., 1602-1607 (1984);<br>
Tsukada et al, 52, Br. J. Cancer, 111-116 (1985)).<br>
A wide array of linker technologies has been employed for the<br>
preparation of such immunoconjugates and both cleavable and non-cleavable<br>
linkers have been investigated. In most cases, the full cytotoxic potential of the<br>
drugs could only be observed, however, if the drug molecules could be released<br>
from the conjugates in unmodified form at the target site.<br>
One of the cleavable linkers that has been employed for the preparation<br>
of antibody-drug conjugates is an acid-labile linker based on cis-aconitic acid<br>
that takes advantage of the acidic environment of different intracellular<br>
compartments such as the endosomes encountered during receptor mediated<br>
endocytosis and the lysosomes. Shen and Ryser introduced this method for the<br>
preparation of conjugates of daunorubicin with macromolecular carriers (102<br>
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1048-1054 (1981)). Yang and Reisfeld used<br>
the same technique to conjugate daunorubicin to an anti-melanoma antibody<br>
(80 J. Natl. Canc. Inst. 1154-1159 (1988)). Dillman et al. also used an acid-<br>
labile linker in a similar fashion to prepare conjugates of daunorubicin with an<br>
anti-T cell antibody (48 Cancer Res. 6097-6102 (1988)).<br>
An alternative approach, explored by Trouet et al, involved linking<br>
daunorubicin to an antibody via a peptide spacer arm (79 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
626-629 (1982)). This was done under the premise that free drug could be<br>
released from such a conjugate by the action of lysosomal peptidases.<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity tests, however, have revealed that antibody-drug<br>
conjugates rarely achieved the same cytotoxic potency as the free<br>
unconjugated drugs. This suggested that mechanisms by which drug molecules<br>
are released from the antibodies could be very inefficient. In the area of<br>
immunotoxins, conjugates formed via disulfide bridges between monoclonal<br>
antibodies and catalytically active protein toxins were shown to be more<br>
cytotoxic than conjugates containing other linkers. See, Lambert et al, 260 J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 12035-12041 (1985); Lambert et al, in Immunotoxins 175-209 (A.<br><br>
Frankel, ed. 1988); Ghetie et al, 48, Cancer Res. 2610-2617 (1988). This was<br>
attributed to the high intracellular concentration of glutathione contributing to the<br>
efficient cleavage of the disulfide bond between an antibody molecule and a<br>
toxin. Despite this, there are only a few reported examples of the use of<br>
disulfide bridges for the preparation of conjugates between drugs and<br>
macromolecules. Shen et al (260, J. Biol. Chem. 10905-10908 (1985))<br>
described the conversion of methotrexate into a mercaptoethylamide derivative<br>
followed by conjugation with poly-D-lysine via a disulfide bond. Another report<br>
described the preparation of a conjugate of the trisulfide containing toxic drug<br>
calicheamycin with an antibody (Hinman et al., 53 Cancer Res. 3336-3342<br>
(1993)).<br>
One reason for the lack of disulfide linked antibody-drug conjugates is<br>
the unavailability of cytotoxic drugs possessing a sulfur atom containing moiety<br>
that can be readily used to link the drug to an antibody via a disulfide bridge.<br>
Furthermore, chemical modification of existing drugs is difficult without<br>
diminishing their cytotoxic potential.<br>
Another major drawback with existing antibody-drug conjugates is their<br>
inability to deliver a sufficient concentration of drug to the target site because of<br>
the limited number of targeted antigens and the relatively moderate cytotoxicity<br>
of cancerostatic drugs like methotrexate, daunorubicin, and vincristine. In order<br>
to achieve significant cytotoxicity, linkage of a large number of drug molecules,<br>
either directly to the antibody or through a polymeric carrier molecule, becomes<br>
necessary. However, such heavily modified antibodies often display impaired<br>
binding to the target antigen and fast in vivo clearance from the blood stream.<br>
In spite of the above-described difficulties, useful cytotoxic agents<br>
comprising cell binding moieties and the group of cytotoxic drugs known as<br>
maytansinoids have been reported (USP 5,208,020, USP 5,416,064, and R. V.<br>
J. Chari, 31 Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 89-104 (1998)). Similarly, useful<br>
cytotoxic agents comprising cell binding moieties and analogues and derivatives<br>
of the potent antitumor antibotic CC-1065 have also been reported<br>
(USP 5,475,092, USP 5,585,499 and USP 6,756,397).<br><br>
Tomaymycin derivatives are pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs), a<br>
known class of compounds exerting their biological properties by covalently<br>
binding to the N2 of guanine in the minor groove of DNA. PBDs include a<br>
number of minor groove binders such as anthramycin, neothramycin and DC-<br>
81. Tomaymycin antitumor activity is however limited because of its non-specific<br>
toxicity towards normal cells. Thus there is a need to increase the therapeutic<br>
activity, and diminish the non-specific toxic effects of tomaymycin compounds.<br>
The present inventors have shown that this need can be met by targeted<br>
delivery of tomaymcin compounds by linking them to cell binding agents.<br>
Additionally, there is a need to develop tomaymycin derivatives that are soluble<br>
and stable in aqueous solutions. Further, tomaymycin is not sufficiently potent<br>
to be used in conjugates of cell binding agents.<br>
Recently, a few new PBD derivatives and their anti-tumour activity in<br>
preclinical models have been disclosed (WO 00/12508 and WO2005/085260).<br>
However, initial clinical trials in humans indicate that compounds of this class<br>
are severely toxic, based on the very low dose that can be administered to<br>
humans (I. Puzanov, Proc. AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference,<br>
Philadelphia, USA 2005, Abstract #B117). Thus, it is desired to provide<br>
alternative derivatives that are more potent and/or may be bonded to cell<br>
binding agents.<br>
Accordingly, a method of treating diseases with tomaymycin derivatives<br>
wherein their side effects are reduced without compromising their cytotoxicity is<br>
greatly needed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As disclosed in a first embodiment, one object of the present invention is<br>
to provide tomaymycin derivatives that are highly toxic and that can still be<br>
effectively used in the treatment of many diseases.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide novel tomaymycin<br>
derivatives, optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding agent.<br>
In a second embodiment, the present invention provides a therapeutic<br>
composition comprising:<br><br>
(A)	an effective amount of one or more tomaymycin derivatives<br>
optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding agent, and<br>
(B)	a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient<br>
In a third embodiment, the present invention provides a method of killing<br>
selected cell populations comprising contacting target cells or tissue containing<br>
target cells, with a cytotoxic amount of a cytotoxic agent comprising one or<br>
more tomaymycin derivatives, optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding<br>
agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is based on the synthesis of novel tomaymycin derivatives<br>
that retain high cytotoxicity and that can be effectively linked to cell binding<br>
agents. It has previously been shown that the linkage of highly cytotoxic drugs<br>
to antibodies using a cleavable link, such as a disulfide bond, ensures the<br>
release of fully active drugs inside the cell, and such conjugates are cytotoxic in<br>
an antigen specific manner (US 6,340,701; US 6,372,738; US 6,436,931).<br>
However, the art reveals that it is extremely difficult to modify existing drugs<br>
without diminishing their cytotoxic potential. The disclosed invention overcomes<br>
this problem by modifying the disclosed tomaymycin derivatives with chemical<br>
moieties. As a result, the disclosed novel tomaymycin derivatives preserve, and<br>
in some cases could even enhance the cytotoxic potency of tomaymycin<br>
derivatives. The cell binding agent-tomaymycin derivative complexes permit the<br>
full measure of the cytotoxic action of the tomaymycin derivatives to be applied<br>
in a targeted fashion against unwanted cells only, therefore, avoiding side<br>
effects due to damage to non-targeted healthy cells. Thus, the invention<br>
provides useful agents for the elimination of diseased or abnormal cells that are<br>
to be killed or lysed such as tumor cells (particularly solid tumor cells).<br>
The cytotoxic agent according to the present invention comprises one or<br>
more tomaymycin derivatives, optionally linkable or linked to a cell binding<br>
agent via a linking group. The linking group is part of a chemical moiety that is<br>
covalently bound to a tomaymycin derivative through conventional methods. In<br><br>
a preferred embodiment, the chemical moiety can be covalently bound to the<br>
tomaymycin derivative via a disulfide bond.<br>

Compounds of formula (II) may thus be considered as solvates, including<br>
water when the solvent is water; these solvates can be particularly useful.<br>
According to a still further object, the present invention is also concerned<br>
with the process of preparation of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The compounds and process of the present invention may be prepared in a<br>
number of ways well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds can be<br>
synthesized, for example, by application or adaptation of the methods described<br>
below, or variations thereon as appreciated by the skilled artisan. The appropriate<br>
modifications and substitutions will be readily apparent and well known or readily<br>
obtainable from the scientific literature to those skilled in the art.<br>
In particular, such methods can be found in R.C. Larock, Comprehensive<br>
Organic Transformations, Wiley-VCH Publishers, 1999.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the present invention may<br>
contain one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated<br>
in optically active or racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms<br>
and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific<br>
stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. It is well known in the art<br>
how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. For example, mixtures of<br>
stereoisomers may be separated by standard techniques including, but not limited<br>
to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography,<br>
preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by chiral synthesis<br><br>
either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral<br>
centers.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be prepared by a variety of<br>
synthetic routes. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or<br>
readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All<br>
substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br>
In the reactions described hereinafter, it may be necessary to protect reactive<br>
functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups,<br>
where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in<br>
the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with<br>
standard practice, for examples see T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed., John Wiley and Sons, 1999; J. F. W.<br>
McOmie in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, 1973.<br>
Some reactions may be carried out in the presence of a base. There is no<br>
particular restriction on the nature of the base to be used in this reaction, and any<br>
base conventionally used in reactions of this type may equally be used here,<br>
provided that it has no adverse effect on other parts of the molecule. Examples of<br>
suitable bases include: sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine,<br>
alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; alkyllithium<br>
compounds, such as methyllithium and butyllithium; and alkali metal alkoxides,<br>
such as sodium methoxide and sodium ethoxide.<br>
Usually, reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent. A variety of solvents<br>
may be used, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the<br>
reagents involved. Examples of suitable solvents include: hydrocarbons, which<br>
may be aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane,<br>
cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene; amides, such as dimethylformamide;<br>
alcohols such as ethanol and methanol and ethers, such as diethyl ether and<br>
tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reactions can take place over a wide range of temperatures. In general,<br>
we find it convenient to carry out the reaction at a temperature of from -20°C to<br>
150°C (more preferably from about room temperature to 100°C). The time required<br>
for the reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the<br><br>
reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents. However, provided that the<br>
reaction is effected under the preferred conditions outlined above, a period of from<br>
3 hours to 20 hours will usually suffice.<br>
The compound thus prepared may be recovered from the reaction mixture by<br>
conventional means. For example, the compounds may be recovered by distilling<br>
off the solvent from the reaction mixture or, if necessary after distilling off the<br>
solvent from the reaction mixture, pouring the residue into water followed by<br>
extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent and distilling off the solvent from<br>
the extract. Additionally, the product can, if desired, be further purified by various<br>
well known techniques, such as recrystallization, reprecipitation or the various<br>
chromatography techniques, notably column chromatography or preparative thin<br>
layer chromatography.<br>
The process of preparation of a compound of formula (I) of the invention is<br>
a further object of the present invention.<br>
According to a first aspect, the process of preparation of the compounds of<br>

Preferably, the SH function is protected and preferably the protecting<br>
group is acetyl, benzoyl, methanesulfonyl, methylthio, pyridylthio,<br>
nitropyridylthio, triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). Generally, the deprotection step is<br>
carried out using classical conditions such a base to remove the acetyl, benzoyl<br>
and methanesulfonyl protective groups, a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol<br>
or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to cleave a methylthio protective group<br>

TIPS.<br><br><br>

as well as the corresponding mercapto derivatives,<br><br>
or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, or hydrated salts, or the<br>
polymorphic crystalline structures of these compounds or their optical isomers,<br>

Cell binding agents may be of any kind and include peptides and non-<br>
peptides. Generally, these can be antibodies (especially monoclonal antibodies)<br>
or a fragment of an antibody that contains at least one binding site,<br>
lymphokines, hormones, growth factors, nutrient-transport molecules (such as<br>
transferrin), or any other cell binding molecule or substance. More specific<br>
examples of cell binding agents that can be used include: monoclonal<br>
antibodies; chimeric antibodies; humanized antibodies; fully human antibodies;<br>
single chain antibodies; fragments of antibodies such as Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2 and<br>
Fv{Parham, 131 J. Immunol. 2895-2902 (1983); Spring et al, 113 J. Immunol.<br>
470-478 (1974); Nisonoff et al, 89 Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 230-244 (1960)};<br>
interferons; peptides; lymphokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6; hormones such<br>
as insulin, TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormones), MSH (melanocyte-stimulating<br>
hormone), steroid hormones, such as androgens and estrogens; growth factors<br>
and colony-stimulating factors such as EGF, TGFa, insulin like growth factor<br>
(IGF-I, IGF-II) G-CSF, M-CSF and GM-CSF {Burgess, 5 Immunology Today<br>
155-158 (1984)}; vitamins, such as folate and transferrin {O'Keefe et al, 260 J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 932-937 (1985)}.<br>
The expression "cell binding agent" included herein also includes<br>
modified cell binding agents, wherein said cell binding agent is modified by a<br>
modifying agent to improve the reactivity of said cell binding agent towards the<br>
linking group of the linker of the tomaymycin derivative. Said modifying agents<br>
include N-sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(5-nitro-2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SSNPB),<br>
Succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC), 4-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio)butanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDB), and so on as<br>
discussed below.<br>
Monoclonal antibody technology permits the production of extremely<br>
selective cell binding agents in the form of specific monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Particularly well known in the art are techniques for creating monoclonal<br>
antibodies produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal<br><br>
with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from<br>
the target cell, whole virus, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins such as<br>
viral coat proteins.<br>
Selection of the appropriate cell binding agent is a matter of choice that<br>
depends upon the particular cell population that is to be targeted, but in general<br>
monoclonal antibodies are preferred if an appropriate one is available.<br>
For example, the monoclonal antibody MY9 is a murine IgG1 antibody<br>
that binds specifically to the CD33 Antigen {J.D. Griffin et al 8 Leukemia Res.,<br>
521 (1984)} and can be used if the target cells express CD33 as in the disease<br>
of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Similarly, the monoclonal antibody anti-<br>
B4 is a murine IgG1, that binds to the CD19 antigen on B cells {Nadler et al, 131<br>
J. Immunol. 244-250 (1983)} and can be used if the target cells are B cells or<br>
diseased cells that express this antigen such as in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or<br>
chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. As stated above, the MY9 and anti-B4<br>
antibodies may be murine, chimeric, humanized or fully human.<br>
Additionally, GM-CSF which binds to myeloid cells can be used as a cell<br>
binding agent to diseased cells from acute myelogenous leukemia. IL-2, which<br>
binds to activated T-cells, can be used for prevention of transplant graft<br>
rejection, for therapy and prevention of graft-versus-host disease, and for the<br>
treatment of acute T-cell leukemia. MSH, which binds to melanocytes, can be<br>
used for the treatment of melanoma.<br>
The conjugate molecules of the invention may be formed using any<br>
techniques. The tomaymycin derivatives of the invention may be linked to an<br>
antibody or other cell binding agent via an acid labile linker, or by a photolabile<br>
linker. The derivatives can be condensed with a peptide having a suitable<br>
sequence and subsequently linked to a cell binding agent to produce a<br>
peptidase labile linker. The conjugates can be prepared to contain a primary<br>
hydroxyl group, which can be succinylated and linked to a cell binding agent to<br>
produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by intracellular esterases to liberate<br>
free derivative. Preferably, the derivatives are synthesized to contain a free or<br>
protected thiol group, and then one or more disulfide or thiol-containing<br><br>
derivatives are each covalently linked to the cell binding agent via a disulfide<br>
bond or a thioether link.<br>
Numerous methods of conjugation are taught in USP 5,416,064 and USP<br>
5,475,092. The tomaymycin derivatives can be modified to yield a free amino<br>
group and then linked to an antibody or other cell binding agent via an acid labile<br>
linker or a photolabile linker. The tomaymycin derivatives with a free amino or<br>
carboxyl group can be condensed with a peptide and subsequently linked to a cell<br>
binding agent to produce a peptidase labile linker. The tomaymycin derivatives<br>
with a free hydroxyl group on the linker can be succinylated and linked to a cell<br>
binding agent to produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by intracellular<br>
esterases to liberate free drug. Most preferably, the tomaymycin derivatives are<br>
treated to create a free or protected thiol group, and then the disulfide- or<br>
thiol-containing tomaymycin dimers are linked to the cell binding agent via<br>
disulfide bonds.<br>
Representative conjugates of the invention are antibody-tomaymycin<br>
derivative, antibody fragment-tomaymycin derivative epidermal growth factor<br>
(EGF)-tomaymycin derivative, melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH)-<br>
tomaymycin derivative, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-tomaymycin derivative,<br>
estrogen-tomaymycin derivative, estrogen analogue-tomaymycin derivative,<br>
androgen-tomaymycin derivative, androgen analogue-tomaymycin derivative, and<br>
folate-tomaymycin derivative.<br>
Tomaymycin derivative conjugates of antibodies, antibody fragments,<br>
protein or peptide hormones, protein or peptide growth factors and other proteins<br>
are made in the same way by known methods. For example, peptides and<br>
antibodies can be modified with cross linking reagents such as N-succinimidyl<br>
3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate, N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP),<br>
4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-a-methyl--(2-pyridyl dithio)-toluene (SMPT), N-<br>
succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) butyrate (SDPB), succinimidyl pyridyl-<br>
dithiopropionate (SPDP), 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoic acid N-hydrosuccinimide<br>
ester (SPDB), succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-caboxylate<br>
(SMCC), N-sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(2-(5-nitro-pyridyldithio) butyrate (SSNPB),<br>
2-iminothiolane, or S-acetylsuccirrtc anhydride by known methods. See, Carlsson<br><br>
et al, 173 Biochem. J. 723-737 (1978); Blattler et al, 24 Biochem. 1517-1524<br>
(1985); Lambert et al, 22 Biochem. 3913-3920 (1983); Klotz et al, 96 Arch.<br>
Biochem. Biophys. 605 (1962); and Liu et al, 18 Biochem. 690 (1979), Blakey and<br>
Thorpe, 1 Antibody, Immunoconjugates &amp; Radio-pharmaceuticals, 1-16 (1988),<br>
Worrell et al 1 Anti-Cancer Drug Design 179-184 (1986). The free or protected<br>
thiol-containing cell binding agent thus derived is then reacted with a disulfide- or<br>
thiol-containing tomaymycin derivative to produce conjugates. The conjugates can<br>
be purified by HPLC or by gel filtration.<br>
Preferably, monoclonal antibody- or cell binding agent-tomaymycin<br>
derivative conjugates are those that are joined via a disulfide bond, as discussed<br>
above, that are capable of delivering tomaymycin derivatives. Such cell binding<br>
conjugates are prepared by known methods such as by modifying monoclonal<br>
antibodies with succinimidyl pyridyi-dithiopropionate (SPDP) (Carlsson et al, 173<br>
Biochem. J. 723-737 (1978)). The resulting thiopyridyl group is then displaced by<br>
treatment with thiol-containing tomaymycin derivatives to produce disulfide linked<br>
conjugates. Alternatively, in the case of the aryldithio- tomaymycin derivatives, the<br>
formation of the cell binding conjugate is effected by direct displacement of the<br>
aryl-thiol of the tomaymycin derivative by sulfhydryl groups previously introduced<br>
into antibody molecules. Conjugates containing 1 to 10 tomaymycin derivative<br>
drugs linked via a disulfide bridge are readily prepared by either method.<br>
More specifically, a solution of the dithio-nitropyridyl modified antibody at a<br>
concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, at pH 7.5<br>
containing 2 mM EDTA is treated with the thiol-containing tomaymycin derivative<br>
(1.3 molar eq./dithiopyridyl group). The release of thio-nitropyridine from the<br>
modified antibody is monitored spectrophotometrically at 325 nm and is complete<br>
in about 16 hours. The antibody-tomayrnycin derivative conjugate is purified and<br>
freed of unreacted drug and other low molecular weight material by gel filtration<br>
through a column of Sephadex G-25 or Sephacryl S300. The number of<br>
tomaymycin derivative moieties bound per antibody molecule can be determined<br>
by measuring the ratio of the absorbance at 230 nm and 275 nm. An average of 1-<br><br>
10 tomaymycin derivative molecules/antibody molecule can be linked via disulfide<br>
bonds by this method.<br>
The effect of conjugation on binding affinity towards the antigen-expressing<br>
cells can be determined using the methods previously described by Liu et al., 93<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 8618-8623 (1996). Cytotoxicity of the tomaymycin<br>
derivatives and their antibody conjugates to cell lines can be measured by back-<br>
extrapolation of cell proliferation curves as described in Goldmacher et al, 135 J.<br>
Immunol. 3648-3651 (1985). Cytotoxicity of these compounds to adherent cell<br>
lines can be determined by clonogenic assays as described in Goldmacher et al,<br>
102 J. Cell Biol. 1312-1319(1986).<br>
Representative conjugates of the invention are conjugates of tomaymycin<br>
derivatives with antibodies, antibody fragments, epidermal growth factor (EGF),<br>
melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),<br>
estrogen, estrogen analogs, androgen, and androgen analogs.<br>
Representative examples of the preparation of various conjugates of<br>
derivatives and cell binding agents are described below.<br>
Disulfide linkers: For example, the monoclonal antibody MY9 is a murine<br>
IgG1 antibody that binds specifically to the CD33 Antigen {J.D. Griffin et al 8<br>
Leukemia Res., 521 (1984)} and can be used if the target cells express CD33<br>
as in the disease of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Similarly, the<br>
monoclonal antibody anti-B4 is a murine IgG1 that binds to the CD19 antigen<br>
on B cells {Nadler et al, 131 J. Immunol. 244-250 (1983)} and can be used if the<br>
target cells are B cells or diseased cells that express this antigen such as in<br>
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphoblastic leukemia.<br>
Additionally, GM-CSF which binds to myeloid cells can be used as a cell<br>
binding agent to diseased cells from acute myelogenous leukemia. IL-2, which<br>
binds to activated T-cells, can be used for prevention of transplant graft<br>
rejection, for therapy and prevention of graft-versus-host disease, and for the<br>
treatment of acute T-cell leukemia. MSH, which binds to melanocytes, can be<br>
used for the treatment of melanoma.<br><br>
The antibody or other cell binding agent is modified with<br>
N-succinimidyl-3-pyridyldithio propionate as previously described {J. Carlsson,<br>
H. Drevin &amp; R. Axen, Biochem. J., 173:723 (1978)} to introduce, on the average,<br>
4 pyridyldithio groups per antibody molecule. The modified antibody is reacted<br>
with the thiol-containing derivative to produce a disulfide-linked conjugate.<br>
Alternatively, the conjugates may be prepared by application and/or<br>
adaptation of the method disclosed in WO2004/103272, whose teaching is<br>
included herein by reference.<br>
Thioether linkers: Thiol-containing derivatives of the present invention<br>
can be linked to antibodies and other cell binding agents via a thioether link as<br>
previously described (U.S. Pat No. 5,208,020). The antibody or other cell<br>
binding agent can be modified with the commercially available compound such<br>
as N-succinimidyl 4-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylate (SMCC),<br>
N-succinimidyl-4-(/\/-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxy-(6-amido-<br>
caproate), which is a "long chain" analog of SMCC (LC-SMCC), These<br>
crosslinking reagents form non-cleavable linkers derived from maleimido-based<br>
moieties.<br>
Crosslinking reagents comprising a haloacetyl-based moiety include N-<br>
succinimidyl-4-(iodoacetyl)-aminobenzoate (SIAB), /V-succinimidyl iodoacetate<br>
(SIA), /V-succinimidyl bromoacetate (SBA) and /V-succinimidyl 3-(bromo-<br>
acetamido)propionate (SBAP). These crosslinking reagents form non-cleavable<br>
linkers derived from haloacetyl-based moieties.<br>
Acid-Labile Linkers: Amino group-containing derivatives of the present<br>
invention can be linked to antibodies and other cell binding agents via an acid<br>
labile linker as previously described {W. A. Blattler et al, Biochemistry 24, 1517-<br>
1524 (1985); U.S. Pat. N° 4,542,225, 4,569,789, 4,618,492, 4,764,368}.<br>
Similarly, an hydrazido group-containing derivative of the present<br>
invention can be linked to the carbohydrate portion of antibodies and other cell<br>
binding agents via an acid labile hydrazone linker {for examples of hydrazone<br><br>
linkers see B. C. Laguzza et al, J. Med. Chem., 32, 548-555 (1989); R. S.<br>
Greenfield et al, Cancer Res., 50, 6600-6607 (1990)}.<br>
Photo-Labile Linkers: Amine group containing derivatives of the present<br>
invention may be linked to antibodies and other cell binding agents via a<br>
photolabile linker as previously described {P. Senter et al, Photochemistry and<br>
Photobiology, 42, 231-237 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,014}.<br>
Peptidase-Labile Linkers: Amine group containing derivatives of the<br>
present invention may also be linked to cell binding agents via peptide spacers.<br>
It has been previously shown that short peptide spacers between drugs and<br>
macromolecular protein carriers are stable in serum but are readily hydrolyzed<br>
by intracellular peptidases {A. Trouet et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 79, 626-629<br>
(1982)}. The amino group containing containing derivatives may be condensed<br>
with peptides using condensing agents such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-<br>
propyl)carbodiimide-HCI (EDC-HCI) to give a peptide derivative that can be<br>
linked to cell binding agents.<br>
Esterase-Labile Linkers: Derivatives of the present invention bearing a<br>
hydroxy alkyl group may be succinylated with succinic anhydride and then<br>
linked to a cell binding agent to produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by<br>
intracellular esterases to liberate free drug. {For examples see E. Aboud-Pirak<br>
et al, Biochem Pharmacol., 38, 641-648 (1989)}.<br>
The conjugates made by the above methods can be purified by standard<br>
chromatography techniques such as size-exclusion, adsorption chromatography<br>
including, but not limited to, ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction<br>
chromatography, affinity chromatography, chromatography on ceramic<br>
hydroxyapatite or on Porapak, or by HPLC. Purification by dialysis or<br>
diafiltration may also be used.<br>
Preferably, conjugates between monoclonal antibodies or cell binding<br>
agents and derivatives of the present invention are those that are joined via a<br>
disulfide bond, as discussed above. Such cell binding conjugates are prepared<br><br>
by known methods such as modifying monoclonal antibodies with succinimidyl<br>
pyridyl-dithiopropionate (SPDP) {Carisson et al, 173 Biochem. J. 723-737<br>
(1978)}. The resulting thiopyridyl group is then displaced by treatment with thiol<br>
containing derivative to produce disulfide linked conjugates. Conjugates<br>
containing 1 to 10 derivatives linked via a disulfide bridge are readily prepared<br>
by this method. Conjugation by this method is fully described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,585,499, which is incorporated by reference.<br>
According to a preferred aspect, the cell binding agent is an antibody, in<br>
particular a monoclonal antibody.<br>
According to another preferred aspect, the cell binding agent is an<br>
antigen specific antibody fragment, such as sFV, Fab, Fab', or F(ab')2.<br>
According to a further object, the present invention also concerns<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising a conjugate molecule of the invention<br>
or a compound of formula (I) as defined above together with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
According to a further object, the present invention also concerns a<br>
method of killing or inhibiting growth of cells, preferably selected cell<br>
populations comprising contacting target cells or tissue containing target cells<br>
with an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The selected cell population are those cancerous and/or proliferative<br>
cells.<br>
According to a further object, the present invention also concerns a<br>
method for treatment, preferably selective treatment, of cancer comprising<br>
administering an effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition according<br>
to the invention to a patient in need thereof.<br>
According to the present invention, "selective treatment of cancer" refers<br>
to killing cancerous and/or proliverative cells substantially without killing normal<br>
and/or non-proliferative cells.<br>
According to a further object, the present invention also concerns the use<br>
of a conjugate molecule of the invention or a compound of formula (I) as defined<br>
above for the preparation of a medicament for treating cancer.<br><br>
The method for inhibiting the growth of selected cell populations can be<br>
practiced in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo.<br>
Examples of in vitro uses include treatments of cell cultures in order to<br>
kill all cells except for desired variants that do not express the target antigen; or<br>
to kill variants that express undesired antigen.<br>
The conditions of non-clinical in vitro use are readily determined by the<br>
skilled artisan.<br>
Examples of ex vivo uses include treatments of autologous bone marrow<br>
prior to their transplant into the same patient in order to kill diseased or<br>
malignant cells: treatments of bone marrow prior to their transplantation in order<br>
to kill competent T cells and prevent graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD).<br>
Clinical ex vivo treatment to remove tumor cells or lymphoid cells from<br>
bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation in cancer treatment or in<br>
treatment of autoimmune disease, or to remove T cells and other lymphoid cells<br>
from allogeneic bone marrow or tissue prior to transplant in order to prevent<br>
GVHD, can be carried out as follows. Bone marrow is harvested from the<br>
patient or other individual and then incubated in medium containing serum to<br>
which is added the cytotoxic agent of the invention, concentrations range from<br>
about 10 M to 1 pM, for about 30 minutes to about 48 hours at about 37 °C.<br>
The exact conditions of concentration and time of incubation (=dose) are readily<br>
determined by the skilled artisan. After incubation the bone marrow cells are<br>
washed with medium containing serum and returned to the patient by i.v.<br>
infusion according to known methods. In circumstances where the patient<br>
receives other treatment such as a course of ablative chemotherapy or total-<br>
body irradiation between the time of harvest of the marrow and reinfusion of the<br>
treated cells, the treated marrow cells are stored frozen in liquid nitrogen using<br>
standard medical equipment.<br>
For clinical in vivo use, the cytotoxic agent of the invention will be<br>
supplied as solutions that are tested for sterility and for endotoxin levels or as a<br>
lyophilized solid that can be redisolved in sterile water for injection. Examples of<br>
suitable protocols of conjugate administration are as follows. Conjugates are<br>
given weekly for 6 weeks as an i.v. bolus. Bolus doses are given in 50 to 400 ml<br><br>
of normal saline to which human serum albumin (e.g. 0.5 to 1 mL of a<br>
concentrated solution of human serum albumin, 100 mg/mL) can be added.<br>
Dosages will be about 50 g to 10 mg/kg of body weight per week, i.v. (range of<br>
10 g to 100 mg/kg per injection). Six weeks after treatment, the patient may<br>
receive a second course of treatment. Specific clinical protocols with regard to<br>
route of administration, excipients, diluents, dosages, times, etc., can be<br>
determined by the skilled artisan as the clinical situation warrants.<br>
Examples of medical conditions that can be treated according to the in<br>
vivo or ex vivo methods of killing selected cell populations include malignancy of<br>
any type including, for example, cancer of the lung, breast, colon, prostate,<br>
kidney, pancreas, ovary, and lymphatic organs; melanomas; autoimmune<br>
diseases, such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis;<br>
graft rejections, such as renal transplant rejection, liver transplant rejection, lung<br>
transplant rejection, cardiac transplant rejection, and bone marrow transplant<br>
rejection; graft versus host disease; viral infections, such as CMV infection, HIV<br>
infection, AIDS, etc.; bacterial infection; and parasite infections, such as<br>
giardiasis, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, and others as determined by one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The identification of those subjects who are in need of treatment of herein-<br>
described diseases and conditions is well within the ability and knowledge of one<br>
skilled in the art. A veterinarian or a physician skilled in the art can readily identify,<br>
by the use of clinical tests, physical examination, medical/family history or<br>
biological and diagnostic tests, those subjects who are in need of such treatment.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending<br>
diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and<br>
by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the<br>
therapeutically effective amount, a number of factors are considered by the<br>
attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of subject; its size,<br>
age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of involvement<br>
or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual subject; the particular<br>
compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability<br><br>
characteristic of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use<br>
of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances.<br>
The amount of a compound of formula (I) or conjugate, which is required to<br>
achieve the desired biological effect, will vary depending upon a number of factors,<br>
including the chemical characteristics (e.g. hydrophobicity) of the compounds<br>
employed, the potency of the compounds, the type of disease, the species to<br>
which the patient belongs, the diseased state of the patient, the route of<br>
administration, the bioavailability of the compound by the chosen route, all factors<br>
which dictate the required dose amounts, delivery and regimen to be administered.<br>
"Pharmaceutically" or "pharmaceutically acceptable" refer to molecular<br>
entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other<br>
untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" includes any<br>
carriers, diluents, adjuvants, or vehicles, such as preserving or antioxidant<br>
agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents,<br>
suspending agents, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use<br>
of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in<br>
the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with<br>
the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated.<br>
Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the<br>
compositions as suitable therapeutic combinations.<br>
In the context of the invention, the term "treating" or "treatment", as used<br>
herein, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the<br>
disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of<br>
such disorder or condition.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound/<br>
medicament according to the present invention effective in preventing or<br>
treating the herein referred pathological condition.<br>
According to the invention, the term "patient", or "patient in need thereof",<br>
is intended for an animal or a human being affected or likely to be affected with<br>
the herein referred pathological condition. Preferably, the patient is human.<br><br>
In general terms, the compounds of this invention may be provided in an<br>
aqueous physiological buffer solution containing 0.1 to 10% w/v compound for<br>
parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from 1 g/kg to 0.1 g/kg of body<br>
weight per day; a preferred dose range is from 0.01 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day or an equivalent dose in a human child. The preferred dosage of<br>
drug to be administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and<br>
extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the<br>
particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the<br>
formulation of the compound, the route of administration (intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, or other), the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound by the<br>
chosen delivery route, and the speed (bolus or continuous infusion) and schedule<br>
of administrations (number of repetitions in a given period of time).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also capable of being<br>
administered in unit dose forms, wherein the term "unit dose" means a single dose<br>
which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which can be readily<br>
handled and packaged, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose<br>
comprising either the active compound itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition, as described hereinafter. As such, typical total daily dose ranges are<br>
from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of body weight. By way of general guidance, unit doses for<br>
humans range from 1 mg to 3000 mg per day. Preferably the unit dose range is<br>
from 1 to 500 mg administered one to six times a day, and even more preferably<br>
from 10 mg to 500 mg, once a day. Compounds provided herein can be formulated<br>
into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients. Such unit dose compositions may be prepared for use by<br>
oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, simple capsules or soft gel<br>
capsules; or intranasally, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or<br>
aerosols; or dermally, for example, topically in ointments, creams, lotions, gels or<br>
sprays, or via trans-dermal patches.<br>
The compositions may conveniently be administered in unit dosage form and<br>
may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, for<br>
example, as described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th<br>
ed.; Gennaro, A. R., Ed.; Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins: Philadelphia, PA, 2000.<br><br>

similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, or gum tragacanth; a<br>
diluent such as starch or lactose; a disintegrant such as starch and cellulose<br>
derivatives; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal<br>
silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring<br>
agent such as peppermint, or methyl salicylate. Capsules can be in the form of a<br>
hard capsule or soft capsule, which are generally made from gelatin blends<br>
optionally blended with plasticizers, as well as a starch capsule. In addition, dosage<br>
unit forms can contain various other materials that modify the physical form of the<br>
dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or enteric agents. Other oral<br>
dosage forms syrup or elixir may contain sweetening agents, preservatives, dyes,<br>
colorings, and flavorings. In addition, the active compounds may be incorporated<br>
into fast dissolve, modified-release or sustained-release preparations and<br>
formulations, and wherein such sustained-release formulations are preferably bi-<br>
modal. Preferred tablets contain lactose, cornstarch, magnesium silicate,<br>
croscarmellose sodium, povidone, magnesium stearate, or talc in any<br>
combination.<br>
Liquid preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. The liquid compositions may<br>
also include binders, buffers, preservatives, chelating agents, sweetening, flavoring<br>
and coloring agents, and the like. Non-aqueous solvents include alcohols,<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and organic<br>
esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include mixtures of alcohols and<br>
water, buffered media, and saline. In particular, biocompatible, biodegradable<br>
lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene<br>
copolymers may be useful excipients to control the release of the active<br>
compounds. Intravenous vehicles can include fluid and nutrient replenishers,<br>
electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like.<br><br>
Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for these active compounds<br>

Example A : General procedure for conjugate preparation:<br>
Anti-B4 antibody that binds to the CD19 antigen preferentially expressed<br>
on the surface of human lymphoma cells is selected for conjugation of<br>
tomaymycin derivatives.<br>
In the first step, the antibody is reacted with the modifying agent N-<br>
sulfosuccinimidyl 5-nitro-2-pyridyldithiobutanoate (SSNPB) to introduce<br>
nitropyridyldithio groups. A solution of huC242 antibody at a concentration of 8<br>
mg/mL in an aqueous buffer containing 0.05 M potassium phosphate, 0.05 M<br><br>
sodium chloride and 2 mM ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), pH 6.5<br>
(65.6 mL) is treated with a 8-fold molar excess of a solution of SSNPB in<br>
dimethylacetamide (DMA). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature<br>
for 90 min. and then loaded on to a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column (50 mm<br>
x 35.5 mm, column) that has been previously equilibrated into an aqueous<br>
buffer containing 0.05 M potassium phosphate, 0.05 M sodium chloride and 2<br>
mM EDTA, pH 7.5.The modified antibody-containing fractions are collected and<br>
pooled to yield product. A small aliquot of the modified antibody is treated with<br>
dithiothreitol to cleave the nitro-pyridyl disulfide and the released nitro-pyridine-<br>
2-thione is assayed spectrophotometrically ( = 4,299 M-1cm-1, = 565<br>
M-1cm-1 for the compound, and = 217,560 M-1cm-1 for the antibody). An<br>
average of 4 to 6 nitro-pyridyldisulfide molecules are typically linked per<br>
molecule of antibody.<br>
The modified antibody is diluted to 2.5 mg/mL in the above buffer at pH 7.5<br>
and then treated with a solution of the tomaymycin derivative in DMA, such that<br>
the final concentration of DMA in the buffer is 20%. The conjugation mixture is<br>
stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture is purified by passage<br>
through a Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column (50 mm x 42 cm, column that<br>
has been previously equilibrated in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at<br>
pH 6.5. Fractions containing monomeric antibody-tomaymycin derivative<br>
conjugate are pooled and dialyzed into the PBS buffer. The final conjugate is<br>
assayed spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients that are<br>
determined separately for each tomaymycin derivative.<br>

The antibody was first modified with 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoic acid N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDB) to introduce pyridyidithio groups. A 4.5-fold<br>
molar excess of SPDB (0.25 umol, 81.1 ug,) in dimethylacetamide (DMA)<br>
(50 L) was added to a solution of huB4 (8 mg, 0.055 umol) in aqueous buffer<br>
containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride and 2 mM<br>
ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA), pH 6.5 (0.95 mL). The final protein<br>
concentration was 8 mg/mL with 5% DMA in buffer. The modification was<br>
allowed to rotate at room temperature for 90 minutes, and was then purified on<br>
a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in an aqueous buffer<br>
containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride and 2 mM<br>
EDTA, pH 7.5. A small aliquot of the modified antibody was treated with<br>
dithiothreitol (DTT) to cleave the pyridyldisulfide groups. The modified antibody<br>
and released pyridine thiol were assayed spectrophotometrically (ε343 = 8,080<br>
M-1cm-1 for the released pyridine thiol, ε280 = 5100 M-1cm-1 for the modified<br>
pyridyidithio groups and Ε280 = 222,960 M-1cm-1 for antibody). An average of<br>
3.36 pyridyldisulfide molecules per molecule of antibody were linked.<br>

(0.157 umol, 0.12 mg) in DMA (91.6 l, 10% v/v). The final protein<br>
concentration was 2.5 mg/mL with 20% DMA in buffer. The conjugation was<br>
allowed to rotate at room temperature overnight and then clarified by<br>
sedimentation (13,200 RPM for 4 min). The supernatant was then purified on a<br>
Sephadex G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in a phosphate-buffered saline<br>

buffer (~1:650 dilution) with four buffer exchanges. The conjugate was clarified<br>
through a 0.22 urn syringe filter and assayed spectrophotometrically (Ε280 =<br>
7743 M-1cm-1, Ε318 = 9137 M-1cm-1 for the PBD, and Ε280 = 222,960 M-1cm-1 for<br><br>

(Compound of example 17) per molecule of antibody were linked.<br><br>
huMy9-6-SPDB - Compound of example 16<br>
Example A5 : The antibody was first modified with 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoic<br>
acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDB) to introduce pyridyldithio groups. A<br>
4.5-fold molar excess SPDB (0.246 mol, 80.1 g,) in DMA (50 L) was added<br>
to solution of huMy9-6 (8 mg, 0.055 mol) in aqueous buffer containing 50 mM<br>
potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride and 2 mM EDTA, pH 6.5 (0.950<br>
mL). The final protein concentration was 8 mg/mL with 5% DMA in buffer. The<br>
modification was allowed to rotate at room temperature for 90 minutes, and then<br>
purified on a Sephadex G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in an aqueous<br>
buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, 50 mM sodium chloride and<br>
2 mM EDTA, pH 8.5. A small aliquot of the modified antibody was treated with<br>
DTT to cleave the pyridyldisulfide groups. The modified antibody and released<br>
pyridine thiol were assayed spectrophotometrically (ε343 = 8,080 M-1cm-1 for the<br>
released pyridine thiol, ε280 - 5100 M-1cm-1 for the modified pyridyldithio groups<br>
and ε80 = 206,460 M-1cm-1 for antibody). An average of 3.32 pyridyldisulfide<br>
molecules per molecule of antibody were linked.<br>
The modified antibody (3.05 mg, 0.0208 umol) was diluted in the above<br>
buffer at pH 8.5 (976 L) and DMA (122 L, 10% v/v) and then treated with a<br>
solution of 8,8'-[5-(N-4-mercapto-4,4-dimethylbutanoyl)amino-1,3-benzene-<br>
iylbis (methyleneoxy)]-bis[7-methoxy-2-methylene-1,2,3,11a-tetrahydro-5H-<br>
pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepin-5-one] (Compound of example 16)<br>
(0.207 mol, 0.158 mg) in DMA (122 l, 10% v/v). The final protein<br>
concentration was 2.5 mg/mL with 20% DMA in buffer. The conjugation was<br>
allowed to rotate at room temperature overnight and then clarified by<br>
sedimentation (13,200 RPM for 4 min). The supernatant was then purified on a<br>
Sephadex G25 gel filtration column equilibrated in a PBS buffer at pH 6.5. The<br>
purified conjugate was dialyzed into PBS pH 6.5 buffer (~1:600 dilution) with<br>
three buffer exchanges. The conjugate was clarified through a 0.22 urn syringe<br>
filter and assayed spectrophotometrically (ε280 = 7743 M-1cm-1, ε= = 9137 M-<br>
1cm-1 for the PBD, and ε280 = 206,460 M-1cm-1 for antibody). An average of 2.58<br><br>
PBD molecules (Compound of example 16) per molecule of antibody were<br>
linked.<br>
Exemple B : Binding Assay<br>
The relative binding affinities of the anti-B4 antibody and its tomaymycin<br>
conjugate on antigen-expressing Ramos cells is determined using a<br>
fluorescence-based assay. The antibody-tomaymycin conjugate and naked<br>
antibody at starting concentrations of 1 a 10-7 M are added to 96-well round<br>
bottom plates and titrated using 3-fold serial dilutions so that there are<br>
duplicates for each concentration. Ramos cells are added at 50,000 cells per<br>
well to each well containing various concentrations of the antibody or conjugate,<br>
as well as to control wells. The plates are incubated on ice for 3 hours. After the<br>
incubation period, the cells in the plate are washed, and a fluorescence labeled<br>
secondary antibody that binds to a humanized IgG, like anti-B4, is added, and<br>
the plates are incubated for 1 hour on ice. The plates are washed again after<br>
the incubation period, and the cells are fixed with 1% formaldehyde/PBS<br>
solution. The fluorescence in each well of the plates is read using a Becton<br>
Dickinson FACSCalibur fluorescence analyzer. Data are plotted as a percent of<br>
the maximum fluorescence obtained at the highest concentration of antibody or<br>
conjugate.<br>
Example C: In vitro potency and specificity of tomaymycin derivative or<br>
tomaymycin derivative conjugates. General protocol to be used:<br>
Samples of free tomaymycin derivative or tomaymycin derivative conjugate<br>
are added to a 96-well flat bottomed tissue culture plate and titrated using serial<br>
dilutions ranging from 1 x 10-12 M to 3 x 10-7 M.. Antigen positive tumor cells or<br>
antigen negative tumor cells are added to the wells in such a way that there are<br>
triplicate samples for each drug concentration for each cell line. The plates are<br>
incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2 for 4 days.<br>
At the end of the incubation period, 20 l of the tetrazolium reagent WST-8<br>
(2-(2-methoxy-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2-tetrazolium,<br><br>
monosodium salt) is added to each well, and the plates are returned to the<br>
incubator for 2 hours. The absorbance in each well of the plates is then<br>
measured using the Molecular Devices plate reader at 450 nm. Surviving<br>
fraction of cells at each concentration of tomaymycin derivative or conjugate are<br>
plotted.<br><br>
