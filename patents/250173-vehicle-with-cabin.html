VEHICLE WITH CABIN BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle with a cabin.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Known in the art are a vehicle with a cabin as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2000-233688/ for example, in which the cabin is supported via a vibration isolation member on the upper surface side of a cabin bracket that is extended in the left and right directions from a transmission case, and a vehicle with a cabin as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2001-163267, for example, in which the cabin is supported via a vibration isolation member on the upper surface side of a cabin bracket that is extended in the left and right directions from a clutch housing.<br>
In the conventional vehicle with a cabin disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2000-233688, the generation of a muffled noise is prevented by a configuration in which a damping mass is provided, and the resonance frequency of air inside the cabin and the oscillation frequency of the vibrations transmitted to the cabin via the vibration isolation member and the cabin bracket are not liable to match, even if resonance or the like occurs within the cabin. In the conventional vehicle with a cabin disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2001-163267, the generation of a muffled noise is prevented by a configuration in which a weight for vibration isolation is provided, and the resonance frequency of air inside the cabin and the oscillation frequency of the vibrations transmitted to the cabin via the vibration isolation member and the cabin bracket are not liable to match, even if resonance or the like occurs within the cabin.<br><br>
t<br>
However, in the conventional vehicles with a cabin disclosed in the documents described above, the cabin bracket is configured so as to have a substantially uniform high rigidity from the fixed member of the cabin bracket to the distal end portion of the cabin bracket, and the characteristic frequency of the cabin brackets has a substantially uniform high value from the fixed member to the distal end portion. For this reason, the characteristic vibration of the cabin bracket as such does not vary even if a damping mass or a weight for vibration isolation is provided. There is therefore a problem in that it is difficult to have configuration in which the resonance frequency of air inside the cabin and the oscillation frequency of the vibrations transmitted to the cabin via the vibration isolation member and the cabin bracket are not liable to match. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle with a cabin in which a configuration is easily achieved wherein the resonance frequency of air inside the cabin and the oscillation frequency of the vibrations transmitted to the cabin via the vibration isolation member and the cabin bracket are not liable to match.<br>
The vehicle with a cabin of the present invention comprises:<br>
a vehicle body supported by a plurality of wheels;<br>
a cabin bracket supported by said vehicle body; and<br>
an elastic member disposed between said cabin bracket and said cabin, wherein<br>
said cabin bracket comprises:<br>
a fixed member fixed to said vehicle body,<br>
a higher rigidity portion extended laterally outwardly of said body from said fixed member, and<br>
a lower rigidity portion that extends laterally outwardly from a lateral outward end portion of said higher<br><br>
J<br>
rigidity portion,  and that is lower in rigidity in the vertical direction than said higher rigidity portion; and<br>
a vibration suppressing weight disposed at a lateral outward end portion of said cabin bracket.<br>
With the above-described configuration, vibrations produced by the engine or by movement can be transmitted to the cabin via a lower rigidity portion that has low rigidity and a low characteristic frequency while retaining the strength of the cabin bracket with the aid of the higher rigidity portion, and the characteristic frequency of the cabin bracket can be kept at a low frequency. Also, the characteristic frequency of the cabin bracket can be adjusted by a vibration suppressing weight. As a result, the oscillation frequency of the vibrations transmitted to the cabin via the cabin bracket and the vibration isolation member can be adjusted to a low value.

The cabin frame 20 is composed of a support frame 21 that supports the cabin 8, a lower frame 22 connected to the support frame 21, and other components. Extending above the front end portion, rear portion, and rear end portion of the lower frame 22 are a left/right pair of front vertical frames 23, a left/right pair of middle vertical frames 24, and a left/right pair of rear vertical frames 25; and the front vertical frames 23, middle vertical frames 24, and rear vertical frames 25 are connected to the upper frame 2 6. The various types of frames constituting the cabin frame 20 are formed by welding and molding pipe material or the like.<br>
The upper portion of the cabin frame 20 is covered from above by a resin roof panel 27 that has been made hollow by blow molding, and the roof panel 27 is fixed to the upper frame 26 via a seal member (not shown) . A floor panel 28 that forms the floor of the cabin 8 is connected to the lower surface side of the cabin frame 20, and a rear wheel fender 2 9 is connected to the two sides of the rearward lower portion of the cabin frame 20. The steering wheel 6 or the like is connected to the front portion of the cabin frame 20, and the driver's seat 7 is supported by the rear portion of the cabin frame 20.<br><br>

The left and right sides of the front end of the cabin 8 configured in the manner described above are supported by a cabin bracket 30 extending in the left and right directions from the clutch housing 11 via a vibration isolation rubber 36, which is an example of an elastic member, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3; and a support bracket 44 fixed to the lower end portion of the support frame 21 positioned in the left and right sides of the rear end of the cabin is supported by a rear cabin bracket 45 extending from a rear axle shaft case 47 via a vibration isolation rubber 46.<br>
(Detailed structure  of the  cabin bracket and vibration suppressing weight)<br>
The structure of the cabin bracket 30 and the vibration suppressing weight 40 according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4 is a longitudinal rear sectional view of the vicinity of the cabin bracket 30, and FIG. 5 is a bottom view of the vicinity of the cabin bracket 30. In FIGS. 4 and 5, the cabin bracket 30 of the front left side portion of the cabin bracket 30 and other components of the cabin 8 is shown as an example, but the front right side portion of the cabin<br><br>
bracket 30 and other components of the cabin 8 have the same configuration other than the differences attributable to the left/right layout.<br>
The cabin bracket 30 is composed of a fixed member 31 that is fixed to the clutch housing 11, a support member 32 that supports the cabin 8 via the vibration isolation rubber 36, a reinforcement member 33 disposed at the base of the cabin bracket 30, and an adjustment member 34 disposed at the distal end of the cabin bracket 30, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, and these members are integrally formed by welding.<br>
A mounting hole 31a for tightening and fixing the cabin bracket 30 to a nut 11a disposed in the clutch housing 11 is machined into the fixed member 31 to allow the cabin bracket 30 to be fixed to the clutch housing 11 by bringing the fixed member 31 into contact with the cabin bracket 30 and tightening a bolt 35.<br>
Machined into the support member 32 are a rubber insertion hole 32a for mounting the vibration isolation rubber 36, a nut 32b for tightening and fixing the vibration isolation rubber 36 to the cabin bracket 30, a positioning pin mounting hole 32c, and a vibration suppressing weight mounting hole 32d.<br>
The vibration isolation rubber 36 is composed of a cylindrical member 36a that is inserted into a connecting bolt 38, a rubber vibration isolation body 36b, and a ring-shaped mounting bracket 36c into which a mounting hole has been machined. The lower portion of the cylindrically formed vibration isolation body 36b is inserted into the rubber insertion hole 32a of the support member 32, the mounting bracket 36c is brought into contact with the upper surface of the support member 32, and a bolt 39 is threaded into the nut 32b of the support member 32 and tightened and fixed in place, whereby the vibration isolation rubber 36 can be fixed to the cabin bracket 30.<br>
The vibration suppressing weight 40 is a lead material having a high specific gravity and is molded into the form<br><br>
of a plate provided with a mounting hole 4 0a. The vibration suppressing weight 40 is configured so as to be brought from below into contact with the support member 32 and tightened and fixed in place using a bolt 41, whereby the vibration suppressing weight 40 can be fixed to the cabin bracket 30.<br>
The vibration suppressing weight 4 0 is composed of a variably adjustable weight at the distal end of the cabin bracket 30 by changing the number of weights. For this reason, the number of vibration suppressing weights 40 can be used to modify and adjust the vibration characteristics in small increments even if used in tractors having different vibration characteristics according to the specifications of the cabin 8, engine 4, and other components.<br>
The reinforcement member 33 is formed in the shape of a flat plate and is affixed in two locations in the front and rear across the fixed member 31 and the support member 32. The shape of the reinforcement member 33 and the length by which the member is extended outward from the fixed member 31 are set with consideration for the weight of the cabin 8, the driver, and other elements supported by the cabin bracket 30, i.e., the load supported by the cabin bracket 30, as well as the vibration isolation characteristics and the like of the vibration isolation rubber 36.<br>
The adjustment member 34 is formed in the shape of a flat plate and is affixed in two locations in the front and rear of the lower surface side of the support member 32. The length and mounting position in the horizontal direction of the adjustment member 34 is set based on the characteristics and the like of the vibrations transmitted from the engine 4 and other components to the clutch housing 11, and the weight of the cabin 8, the driver, and the like supported by the cabin bracket 30. An advantageous cabin support structure that corresponds to different vibration characteristics can be achieved by modifying the shape and<br><br>
length of the adjustment member 34, even in tractors having, e.g., different cabin 8 and engine 4 specifications.<br>
As described above, a higher rigidity portion A may include a reinforcement member 33 extending laterally outwardly of the vehicle body from said fixed member 31 of the cabin bracket 30, and a support member 32 in the position in which the reinforcement member 33 is disposed, and a lower rigidity portion B may include a support member 32 which supports the vibration isolation rubber 36 and which extends laterally outwardly from an end portion of the higher rigidity portion A. An auxiliary higher rigidity portion C may include an adjustment member 34 and a support member 32 in the position in which the adjustment member 34 is disposed; and the vibration suppressing weight 40 is mounted without a gap on the end surface of the outward side of the auxiliary higher rigidity portion C. The support member 32, reinforcement member 33, and adjustment member 34 are preferably plate-shaped bodies made of steel or another metal. The reinforcement member 33 and adjustment member 34 extend in the vertical direction, and the side surfaces of these members contact the support member 32, whereby the support member 32 is supported in the vertical direction.<br>
A plate-shaped linkage member 37 is fixed to the lower surface side of the floor panel 28 that forms the lower end surface of the cabin frame 20, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, and the linkage member 37 is brought into contact with the upper surface of the vibration isolation rubber 36, and the connecting bolt 38 is inserted into the cylindrical member 36a of the vibration isolation rubber 36 and tightened and fixed in place, whereby the configuration allows the cabin 8 and the vibration isolation rubber 36 to be connected and the cabin 8 to be supported by the cabin bracket 30 via the vibration isolation rubber 36.<br>
The cabin bracket 30 is configured and the cabin 8 is supported in the manner described above, whereby the bending strength can be assured in the vertical direction of the<br><br>
cabin bracket 30 against the bending moment that acts on the cabin bracket 30 by supporting the cabin 8 with the reinforcement member 33 of the cabin bracket 30, and the lower rigidity portion B that has lower rigidity in the vertical direction can thus be configured.<br>
A positioning hole 28a provided to the floor panel 28 is aligned with the distal end of a positioning pin 42, and the cabin 8 is mounted on the cabin bracket 30 in a state in which the positioning pin 42 is fixed in the positioning pin mounting hole 32c of the support member 32, whereby the positioning of the cabin 8 with respect to the cabin bracket 30 in the forward, rearward, left, and right directions can be rapidly carried out in a simple manner. [ State of vibration transmission]<br>
An  example  of  the  vibration  transmission  ratio<br>
(transmissibility) for each frequency of the tractor on which the cabin bracket 30 according to the present invention is mounted will be described with reference to FIGS. 6 and 7. The frequency, vibration transmission ratio, resonance frequency region, and other numerical values described below will differ according to the structure of the cabin 8 and the vibration characteristics and other parameters of the vibration isolation rubber 36, and the numerical values are shown as examples.<br>
The horizontal axis of FIG. 6 represents the magnitude<br>
(Hz) of the frequency, and the vertical axis of FIG. 6 represents the vibration transmission ratio (dimensionless value also referred to as transmissibility) of the cabin bracket 30 from the clutch housing 11 to the vibration isolation rubber 36, i.e., a value obtained by dividing the input vibration (vibrations transmitted from the cabin bracket 30 to the mounting bracket 36c of the vibration isolation rubber 36) of the vibration isolation rubber 36 by the output vibration (vibrations transmitted from the engine 4 or the like to the fixed member 31 of the cabin bracket 30 via the clutch housing 11) of the clutch housing 11.  The<br><br>
units  of  the  input  and  output  vibrations  represent acceleration or the magnitude of force.<br>
For example, when the vibration transmission ratio is 1, the output vibrations of the clutch housing 11 are transmitted to the vibration isolation rubber 36 without being reduced in magnitude. In other words, when a comparison is made using the same frequency, fewer vibrations are transmitted to the vibration isolation rubber 36 as the vibration transmission ratio is reduced, and the vibrations from the engine 4 or the like transmitted to the cabin 8 via the vibration isolation rubber 36 are reduced.<br>
The horizontal axis of FIG. 7 represents the magnitude (Hz) of the frequency, and the vertical axis of FIG. 7 represents the vibration transmission ratio (dimensionless value) of the cabin bracket 30 from the clutch housing 11 to the linkage member 37, i.e., a value obtained by dividing the input vibration (vibrations transmitted from the cabin bracket 30 to the linkage member 37 via the vibration isolation rubber 36) of the linkage member 37 by the output vibration (vibrations transmitted from the engine 4 or the like to the fixed member 31 of the cabin bracket 30 via the clutch housing 11) of the clutch housing 11. Unlike FIG. 6, FIG. 7 shows the vibration transmission ratio obtained via a vibration isolation rubber 36 having a lower characteristic frequency, and the value of the vibration transmission ratio is therefore lower than that in FIG. 6.<br>
The thick lines shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 are curved lines resulting from plotting the measured values of the vibration transmission ratio at each frequency in a tractor in which the cabin bracket 30 described above has been adopted. The thin lines shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 are curved lines resulting from plotting the measured values of the vibration transmission ratio at each frequency in a tractor in which a conventional cabin bracket 50 (see FIG. 10) has been adopted. The dotted lines shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 are curved lines resulting from plotting the measured values of the<br><br>
vibration transmission ratio at each frequency in a tractor in which a cabin bracket 30 (see FIG. 8 and 9) is adopted without mounting an adjustment member 34,<br>
In a conventional cabin bracket 50, since the rigidity of the cabin bracket 50 is high and the characteristic vibration is considerable, the vibration transmission ratio increases together with the increase in frequency and exhibits a characteristic in which a first peak value (I) is reached at a frequency of about 250 Hz and a second peak value (II) reached at a frequency of about 1,000 Hz, as shown by the thin lines in FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
When the cabin bracket 30 according to the present invention is adopted, the characteristic frequency of the cabin bracket 30 is low because the rigidity of the cabin bracket 30 is kept low, as shown by the thick lines in FIGS. 6 and 7. For this reason, the vibration transmission ratio increases together with the increase in frequency, reaches a first peak value (I-B) at a frequency of about 90 Hz, decreases thereafter, and then gradually increases and reaches a second peak value (II-B) at a frequency of about 600 Hz.<br>
In other words, the first peak value (I) and the second peak value (II) of the vibration transmission ratio in a conventional cabin bracket 50 can be moved to a first peak value (I-B) and a second peak value (II-B) that have a lower frequency by keeping the rigidity of the cabin bracket 30 low and mounting a vibration suppressing weight 40.<br>
When a cabin bracket 30 in which an adjustment member 34 is not mounted is adopted, the characteristic frequency of the cabin bracket 30 is low because the rigidity of the cabin bracket 30 is kept low, as shown by the dotted lines FIGS. 6 and 7. For this reason, the vibration transmission ratio reaches a first peak value (I-A) at a frequency of about 90 Hz. The vibration transmission ratio then decreases and then gradually increases to reach a second peak value (II-A) at a frequency of about 350 Hz.<br><br>
In other words, since the adjustment member 34 is not mounted, the vibration transmission ratio is considerable in an area in which the frequency is low (in the vicinity 100 Hz to 400 Hz) in comparison with the cabin bracket 30 shown by the thick lines of FIGS. 6 and 7, and the vibration transmission ratio reaches a second peak value (II-A) at a frequency of about 350 Hz. Specifically, the second peak value can be moved from II-A to II-B without moving the first peak values (I-A and I-B) by providing an adjustment member 34.<br>
For example, in a tractor, experimental data (not shown) has been obtained that indicates that vibrations in a frequency range of 100 to 500 Hz (hereinafter defined as the resonance frequency range) selected from the vibrations transmitted from the engine 4 and the like to the cabin 8 via the cabin bracket 30 readily resonate with the resonance frequency of the cabin space, which is a frequency that creates a cacophony for a driver or others in the cabin, and readily cause the driving environment to worsen. For this reason, the first peak value (I) can be moved to 100 Hz or less (I-B) due to the presence of the low-rigidity cabin bracket 30 and the vibration suppressing weight 40, the second peak value (II) can be moved to 500 Hz or higher (II-B) using the adjustment member 34, and a configuration can be achieved in which the first and second peak values of the vibration transmission ratio do not enter into a resonance frequency area that creates a cacophony for the driver and others in the cabin.<br>
In accordance with the above, the area of frequency in which the vibration transmission ratio is high, such as the first peak value (I) of a conventional cabin bracket 50 and the second peak value (II-A) of a cabin bracket 30 in which an adjustment member 34 is not mounted, as shown in FIG. 7, is reduced in a range in which the resonance frequency area that forms a cacophony for the driver and others in the cabin, and the vibration transmission ratio in this range<br><br>
can be averaged to a lower frequency. As a result, a configuration can be achieved in which the resonance frequency of air in the cabin does not readily match the characteristic frequency transmitted to the cabin 8 via the cabin bracket 30 and the vibration isolation rubber 36. (Structure of a convention cabin bracket)<br>
FIG. 10 is a schematic diagram showing the structure of a conventional cabin bracket 50. FIG. 10A shows a rear view of the vicinity of the cabin bracket 50, and FIG. 10B shows a side view of the vicinity of the cabin bracket 50.<br>
The conventional cabin bracket 50 is molded in the form of an inverted letter 'C! whose cross-sectional shape faces downward, as shown in FIG. 10, and a highly rigid structure is adopted across the distal end of the cabin bracket 50 from the portion fixed to the clutch housing 11. The structure of the conventional cabin bracket 50 shown in FIG. 10 is the structure of the conventional cabin bracket 50 used in the graphs of FIGS. 6 and 7, which are shown for comparison in the description of the present invention. (First modified embodiment of the invention)<br>
In the embodiment described above, an example was described in which the cabin bracket 30 is provided with a fixed member 31, a support member 32, a reinforcement member 33, and an adjustment member 34, but a cabin bracket 30 such as that shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 may be adopted. The configuration other than that described above is the same as the embodiment described above.<br>
FIG. 8 is a longitudinal rear sectional view of the vicinity of the cabin bracket 30; and FIG 9 is a bottom view of the vicinity of the cabin bracket 30. FIGS. 8 and 9 show an example of the cabin bracket 30 and other components of the front left portion of the cabin 8, but the front right side portion of the cabin bracket 30 and other components of the front left portion of the cabin 8 have the same configuration other than the differences attributable to the left/right layout.<br><br>
The cabin bracket 30 is composed of a fixed member 31 that is fixed to the clutch housing 11, a support member 32 that supports the cabin 8 via the vibration isolation rubber 36, and a reinforcement member 33 disposed at the base of the cabin bracket 30, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, and these members are integrally formed by welding.<br>
The reinforcement member 33 is molded into the form of a slightly curved longitudinal flat tie plate that extends from the fixed member 31 to the vicinity of the center line of the rubber insertion hole 32a of the support member 32, and is affixed at two locations in the front and rear of the fixed member 31 and support member 32.<br>
The vibration suppressing weight mounting hole 32d is machined as a long hole in the left/right direction, and is configured so that the position of the vibration suppressing weight 4 0 in the left/right direction can be variably adjusted. With such a configuration, the vibration characteristics can be adjusted in small increments, and vibrations transmitted from the vehicle body 3 to the cabin 8 can be reduced even if used in tractors having different vibration characteristics according to the specifications of the cabin 8, engine 4, and other components.<br>
As described above, the higher rigidity portion A is composed of a reinforcement member 33 extended to the outward side from the fixed member 31 of the cabin bracket 30, and a support member 32 in a position in which the reinforcement member 33 is disposed; and the lower rigidity portion B is composed of a support member 32 extended to the outward side from the end portion of the outward side of the higher rigidity portion A.<br>
For example, the structure of the cabin bracket 30 can be simplified and manufacturing costs can be reduced while averaging the frequencies in the range of the resonance frequency area to a lower frequency by adopting a cabin bracket 30 without an adjustment member 34 in a vehicle with a cabin having a low resonance frequency area.<br><br><br><br>
the same manner to aitterent vehicles as long as the vehicle is a vehicle with a cabin. For example, application can also be made in a similar manner to a combine or another agricultural vehicle, a civil engineering vehicle, a construction vehicle, or other vehicles with a cabin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
