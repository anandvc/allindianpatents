				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention refers to a circuit arrangement comprising<br>
an input section for receiving a band of digital<br>
television channels, a signal processing section, a power<br>
supply, and an output section for supplying a television<br>
receiver with a selected television program. Circuit<br>
arrangements of this kind are known for example as<br>
digital satellite receivers or settop boxes in consumer<br>
electronics which receive a plurality of television<br>
channels allowing a user to select a certain program for<br>
viewing with a television set. As a television receiver<br>
for receiving a television channel in this sense also<br>
video recorders, camcorders or personal computers (PCs)<br>
are understood.<br>
Conventional satellite receiving stations for homes as<br>
known from prior art use a satellite antenna and a low<br>
noise converter (LNB), which converts the received band<br>
of satellite channels to an intermediate frequency, and a<br>
satellite receiver which is controlled by a user for<br>
selecting the wanted television program. If a satellite<br>
installation for a multi-user system is required, a<br>
multi-switch behind the low noise converter is used for<br>
supplying several satellite receivers, being connected<br>
each to a television set, with the band of television<br>
channels. With this arrangement several rooms of a home<br>
or several apartments within a building are supplied with<br>
television programs and a user can select a preferred<br>
television program independently of the other users.<br>
Digital set-top boxes as known up to now provide a<br>
television receiver with only one television channel, as<br>
selected by a user.<br>
For digital consumer electronics devices and computers a<br>
new bus standard, IEEE 1394, has been established for<br>
linking several devices, known for example also as<br>
"i.LINK" or HPSB (High Performance Serial Bus), or<br>
"FireWire". This bus allows the transmission of digital<br>
audio and video data in real time with high data rates in<br>
both directions. Information about the IEEE 1394 bus is<br>
provided by computer literature, for example PC Magazin<br>
June 2000, pages 180ff., or from the 1394 Trade<br>
Association (www.1394ta.org). The 1394 bus is already<br>
widely used in computer products as for example in<br>
personal computers or note books, or in digital<br>
camcorders. IEEE 1394 is an international standard with a<br>
low cost digital interface that will integrate<br>
entertainment, communication and computing electronics<br>
into consumer multimedia.<br>
There are two types of IEEE 13 94 data transfer:<br>
asynchronous and isochronous data transfer. The<br>
asynchronous data transfer is a traditional computer<br>
memory mapped, load and store interface. Data requests<br>
are sent to a specific address and an acknowledgement is<br>
returned. Isochronous data channels provide a data<br>
transport at a predetermined rate in a streaming mode,<br>
using an isochronous channel identification number (ID).<br>
The protocol for the IEEE 13 94 bus is arranged in three<br>
layers: the transaction layer converts the data of the<br>
IEEE 13 94 bus to a parallel bus of the corresponding<br>
device using a control and status register set (CSR)<br>
according to IEEE 1212, and is arranged as a software or<br>
firmware. The transaction layer is coupled to the link<br>
layer, which generates the data packages for the<br>
asynchronous and synchronous modes according to the<br>
specification of the IEEE 1394 bus, and which provides<br>
the error correction and the addressing to a certain<br>
device. The link layer provides also the data<br>
transmission for the isochronous channel.<br>
The link layer is coupled to the physical layer, which<br>
comprises the line drivers and initialization,<br>
arbitration and plug-and-play logic. It recognizes new<br>
installed devices and provides an identification address<br>
for the data transmission between the devices of the bus.<br>
The physical layer is coupled to the transaction layer<br>
via the link layer, and is coupled to the input/output<br>
port of the device for providing the data transmission.<br>
As the cable connections twisted pair lines with four<br>
wires are used for the data transmission, optionally six<br>
wires are also possible, when a supply voltage is<br>
required. For longer line connections a transmission via<br>
Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) or multi mode optical glass<br>
fiber is possible. The voltage supply is provided via the<br>
separate cable pair and provides 8 to 33 V with a maximum<br>
of 1,5 A for one port.<br>
The physical layer provides one or more output ports for<br>
a connection to other devices, and up to 63 devices can<br>
be coupled to one IEEE 13 94 bus, arranged in parallel and<br>
in series, the series connections being restricted to a<br>
maximum of 16. The IEEE 1394 bus can be used also with<br>
high frequency transceivers for working as a wireless<br>
network. As a new standard for wireless transmission of<br>
consumer electronics devices via the IEEE 1394 bus the<br>
so-called "COMMEND" standard is being established.<br>
For providing an inter brand operability of consumer<br>
electronics devices for a transmission of data via IEEE<br>
1394, the device specification HAVi (Home Audio Video<br>
Interoperability) is known, which allows a user-friendly<br>
control of these devices in homes (www.havi.org). It<br>
allows a control of a digital home-network with audio and<br>
video devices via the IEEE 13 94 bus, for example by using<br>
an on-screen display of a television receiver.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
circuit arrangement for receiving a band of television<br>
channels as described above, which provides a high<br>
versatility and an economic power consumption.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the features of the<br>
invention as specified in claim 1. Advantageous<br>
developments of the invention are specified in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The circuit arrangement according to the invention<br>
comprises an input section for receiving a band of<br>
digital television channels, a signal processing section,<br>
a power supply, and an output section for supplying one<br>
or several television receivers with a television<br>
channel. The output section of the circuit arrangement<br>
comprises an IEEE 1394 port for a connection to the<br>
television receivers for providing digital data<br>
transmissions in both directions, and the power supply<br>
comprises a power down mode in which at least parts of<br>
the input section and the signal processing section are<br>
switched off, when none of the television receivers are<br>
active. Because of the bus management of the IEEE 1394<br>
bus the circuit arrangement knows always the<br>
configuration of the bus and especially which television<br>
receiver is active and in an on-mode. When none of the<br>
television receivers is active, the circuit arrangement<br>
switches off internal parts, especially the input section<br>
and digital signal processing circuitry, including the<br>
transaction layer and the link layer.<br>
The circuit arrangement may be a digital satellite<br>
receiver with an input section for coupling to a<br>
satellite antenna for receiving a band of television<br>
channels via a satellite, or a digital settop box for<br>
receiving a band of television channels via cable.<br>
Because of the high data transmission of the IEEE 1394<br>
bus, the circuit arrangement is able to provide several<br>
television receivers at the same time with a requested<br>
television program, and therefore one circuit arrangement<br>
is sufficient for example for a home or even a building<br>
with several apartments. Because in a home usually only<br>
for a few hours of the day a television receiver is<br>
switched on, the circuit arrangement can switch off<br>
automatically essential electronic circuit parts<br>
consuming the main part of power of the circuit<br>
arrangement.<br>
Because the bus management is provided by the physical<br>
layer of the IEEE 1394 bus, the circuit arrangement<br>
switches to a power down mode, in which advantageously<br>
only the physical layer and the power supply are on. The<br>
power supply has to be able to provide a low power<br>
standby mode and therefore the total power consumption in<br>
the power down mode can be below 5 Watts. When compared<br>
with the power consumption in on-mode, which may be in<br>
the range of 30 to 50 Watts, the power down mode of the<br>
circuit arrangement leads to a considerable cost<br>
reduction for a user. When a six-wire IEEE 1394 cable is<br>
used for connecting the circuit arrangement to the<br>
television receivers, the physical layer of the circuit<br>
arrangement can be powered also by one of the television<br>
receivers being in on-mode. Then the power supply of the<br>
circuit arrangement can be switched off also. When a user<br>
switches on one of the television receivers and requests<br>
a respective television program, the physical layer<br>
switches on the circuit arrangement.<br>
In case of a digital satellite receiver, the low noise<br>
converter of the satellite antenna can be switched off<br>
also in the power down mode. The satellite receiver may<br>
be arranged also close to the satellite antenna, because<br>
a complete remote operation is performed by using the<br>
television receivers via the IEEE 1394 bus. Only one<br>
output cable from the satellite receiver to the<br>
television receivers is sufficient because IEEE 1394<br>
satellite receivers can be arranged chain like and in<br>
parallel.<br>
The invention is further explained by way of a preferred<br>
embodiment with reference to the accompanying figure which show:<br>
Fig. 1 The arrangement of a digital satellite receiver<br>
being coupled with television receivers, and<br>
Fig. 2 a digital satellite receiver coupled to a<br>
television receiver.<br>
The house H with two floors shown in fig. 1 comprises a<br>
satellite antenna A on the roof for receiving a band of<br>
television channels via satellite. A digital satellite<br>
receiver SAR is arranged close to the satellite antenna A<br>
below the roof and connected via a coaxial cable HF to<br>
the low noise converter LNB of the satellite antenna A.<br>
The power for the LNB is supplied via the cable HF by the<br>
satellite receiver SAR.<br>
Several rooms of the house are equipped with television<br>
receivers TV1, TV2 and TV3, and one of the rooms also<br>
with a personal computer PC. In this special arrangement<br>
the television receivers TV1 and TV2 are connected<br>
directly via IEEE 1394 cables FF1, FF2 to the satellite<br>
receiver SAR, being arranged in parallel. The personal<br>
computer PC is connected via an IEEE 1394 cable FF3 to<br>
the television receiver TV1, and the television receiver<br>
TV3 is connected via a further IEEE 1394 cable FF4 to the<br>
personal computer PC.<br>
The television receivers TV1 - TV3 and the personal<br>
computer PC are therefore all coupled to one output<br>
section of the satellite receiver SAR, the physical layer<br>
(PHY) of the IEEE 1394 bus, for digital data transmission<br>
in both directions. When a user requests a wanted<br>
television program with one of the television receivers<br>
TV1 - TV3, or the PC, the selected television receiver<br>
demands via an asynchronous data set from the satellite<br>
receiver SAR the requested television channel. This<br>
channel is provided then by the satellite receiver SAR<br>
via an isochronous transport mode, in which the data<br>
blocks are equipped with a so called isochronous channel<br>
identification number for device allocation. The further<br>
television receivers can receive a television channel in<br>
the same way in parallel from the satellite receiver SAR.<br>
Therefore all the television receivers can be supplied<br>
with an individual television channel at the same time by<br>
only one digital satellite receiver SAR with one output<br>
section. Limitations are only data rates, because for one<br>
television channel a data rate of about 7 or 15 MHz is<br>
required and via an electrical IEEE 1394 connection a<br>
maximum data rate of 100 or 200 MHz is possible, and<br>
further, that only 63 devices can be coupled together via<br>
the IEEE 1394 bus. For the cable connections, thin and<br>
inexpensive cables are used. Via a copper cable for<br>
example , a data rate of 100 MHz can be provided with a<br>
cable length up to 25 m. For longer IEEE 1394<br>
connections, or for connections from room to room, also<br>
wireless transmissions may be used.<br>
Because of the IEEE 1394 bus management, the satellite<br>
receiver SAR can switch to a power down mode when no<br>
television channel is required by a television receiver,<br>
to save energy. In this power down mode the essential<br>
parts for providing the isochronous data transmission to<br>
the television receivers can be switched off, as further<br>
explained according to Fig. 2. Also the power supply to<br>
the low noise converter LNB can be switched off.<br>
Essential is only, that the physical layer (PHY) of the<br>
IEEE 1394 bus inside the satellite receiver SAR is active<br>
for receiving asynchronous data from the television<br>
receivers. In case of a demand from a television<br>
receiver, the physical layer switches the satellite<br>
receiver SAR from the power down mode to the normal mode,<br>
in which all circuits of the satellite receiver are<br>
active.<br>
As a further embodiment the circuit arrangement of the<br>
invention may represent a digital settop box, which is<br>
linked via cable to a television channel provider. The<br>
settop box can provide then also several television<br>
receivers at the same time with a certain television<br>
programs via an IEEE 13 94 port in the same way as the<br>
satellite receiver SAR. The settop box is then also able<br>
to switch to a power down mode when no television channel<br>
is required by a television receiver for saving energy.<br>
The digital satellite receiver SAR is explained in more<br>
detail now according to Fig. 2. It comprises an input<br>
section IS having amplifiers and/or filters for receiving<br>
the high frequency signal of the low noise converter LNB<br>
via the cable HF, usually a coaxial cable. The output<br>
signal of the LNB, which is in the range of 1 - 2 GHz, is<br>
then down converted by a down-converter DC into a base<br>
band, in which the digital data of the television<br>
channels can be processed and separated by a signal<br>
processing circuit, for example in a microprocessor µP.<br>
The circuit part of the IEEE 13 94 bus within the<br>
satellite receiver SAR consists of the physical layer<br>
PHY, the link layer controller TLC and the transaction<br>
layer controller LLC. Via the transaction layer<br>
controller TLC and the link layer controller LLC an<br>
isochronous transport mode is established, with which a<br>
requested television channel is provided via the physical<br>
layer PHY and the cable FF1 to the television receiver<br>
TV1, or to another television receiver.<br>
All circuit parts of the satellite receiver SAR are<br>
supplied with power via lines 1, 2, and 3 by a power<br>
supply PS, for example a switched mode power supply<br>
(SMPS). With the physical layer PHY and line 1 a control<br>
of the power supply PS is possible for switching off of<br>
the respective circuit parts in the power down mode, or<br>
switching the power supply to a standby mode in which<br>
these circuit parts are off. In the power down mode also<br>
the microprocessor (µP) of the circuit arrangement can by<br>
switched off completely, or is in a low power mode.<br>
The physical layer PHY can be implemented within one<br>
integrated circuit, for example the TSB21LV03C from Texas<br>
Instruments. This integrated circuit provides all the<br>
analog and digital physical layer functions needed to<br>
implement a three-port node in a cable-based IEEE 1394 -<br>
1995 network. It provides a power down function, with<br>
which the power supply PS of the satellite receiver SAR<br>
can be switched to a low power standby mode as described<br>
before, and in which all the other circuit parts,<br>
transaction layer converter TLC, link layer converter<br>
LLC, input section IS, and down converter DC can be<br>
switched off, and in which then only the physical layer<br>
PHY is active. When the physical layer PHY receives a<br>
standardized link-on packet, the power supply PS and the<br>
link layer converter LLC is activated. When the link<br>
layer converter LLC and the digital signal processing<br>
part is powered up, the LLC communicates this to the<br>
physical layer PHY and then the 13 94 port of the<br>
satellite receiver SAR is enabled.<br>
