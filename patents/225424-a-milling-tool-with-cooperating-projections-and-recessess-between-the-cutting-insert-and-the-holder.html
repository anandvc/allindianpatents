				<td>Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an indexable cutting insert for an end mill for<br>
the machining of contours in a workpiece and to a milling tool according to the preambles<br>
of the independent claims, which correspond to EP-A1-842 723.<br>
An end mill is used under complicated and severe conditions with intensely<br>
fluctuating cutting forces under heavy demands regarding the machining precision. If<br>
indexable cutting inserts are used for an end mill, it is important to place such indexable<br>
cutting inserts precisely in relation to the tool body and to clamp the cutting insert rigidly<br>
on the tool body.<br>
A conventional indexable cutting insert for an end mill, see, for instance, US-<br>
A-6,149,355 and US-A-5,951,213, has two cutting edges, each comprising a curved edge<br>
and a substantially straight edge connecting to one end thereof, In its entirety, the cutting<br>
insert has an oval shape as seen in top view. Thus, if the cutting insert is a positive cutting<br>
insert, i.e. a cutting insert having a leaning side, it is very difficult to precisely position the<br>
cutting insert on a tool body and clamp the same rigidly. Other documents of interest are<br>
EP 0842723 Al, EP 1252955 Al and US 6,149,355.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a milling tool for precise<br>
positioning of the cutting insert.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a milling tool wherein<br>
the cutting insert may be clamped rigidly.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a cutting insert that<br>
enables rigidly clamping in the tool body.<br>
These and other objects have been attained by a tool and a cutting insert such<br>
as these are defined in the appended claims, reference being made to the drawings.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In Figs. 1A-1E, a milling tool 10 is shown according to the present<br>
invention, intended to machine foremost moulding tools for the moulding industry. The<br>
milling tool has a holder having a shaft 11 and a front chip-removing end 12. The end 12<br>
has two cutting insert pockets 13, 14, each carrying a cutting insert 30, preferably made<br>
from sintered cemented carbide. A clamping means or a screw 15 holds the cutting insert<br>
in the cutting insert pocket. The cutting inserts 30A, 3 OB are so placed that one of the<br>
cutting inserts or the interior cutting insert 30A in the interior cutting insert pocket 13<br>
extends in to and preferably past the centre line CL of the tool. This means that the tool<br>
can bore in the workpiece. The second cutting insert or the exterior cutting insert 30B in<br>
the exterior cutting insert pocket 14 is arranged somewhat at the side of the centre line CL.<br>
The active cutting edges of the cutting inserts are arranged so that they form a perfect<br>
semi-sphere upon rotation.<br>
Each cutting insert pocket 13,14 comprises a base surface 16, which has a<br>
central threaded boring 21 in order to receive the screw 15. Furthermore, the cutting insert<br>
pocket has a front 17 and a rear shoulder 18, with the positions being related to the axial<br>
direction of the tool. The base surface 16 comprises two projections 19, 20, arranged on<br>
both sides of and at different distances from the boring 21. The axially front projection 19<br>
connects radially outwardly to the envelope surface of the tool and has an extension<br>
radially inwardly, approximately halfway towards the front shoulder 17. The axially rear<br>
projection 20 connects radially inwardly to the area of the rear shoulder 18 and has an<br>
extension radially outwardly, approximately halfway in the direction towards the envelope<br>
surface. In the interior cutting insert pocket 13, an extension of each projection 19, 20<br>
forms an acute angle a to the centre line CL, see Fig. IF. In the exterior cutting insert<br>
pocket 14, an extension of each projection 19, 20 forms an acute angle 13 to the centre line<br>
CL, see Fig. 1G. The angle a is smaller than the angle B. Each projection 19, 20 has a<br>
substantially rectangular cross-section with a somewhat chamfered top side.<br>
The cutting insert 30 that is shown in Figs. 2A-2F fits, as has been said<br>
above, in both the insert pockets 13, 14. The cutting insert is asymmetrical in respect of a<br>
line through a hole 31 of the cutting insert. The cutting insert has in planar view a so-called<br>
eye-shape or leaf-shape and comprises two cutting edge portions, each cutting edge portion<br>
consisting of a substantially straight cutting edge 32, 33 and a cutting edge 38, 39 curved<br>
in planar view along respective intersecting lines between a clearance surface 34A and a<br>
chip surface 35. The curved cutting edges 38, 39 have different lengths. The straight<br>
cutting edges 32, 33 are not parallel but form an angle to each other, conveniently between<br>
4 and 20°, preferably between 6 and 15°. The straight cutting edges connect in the<br>
direction towards opposite cutting corners 36, 37 to curved cutting edges 38, 39. The<br>
curved cutting edges 38, 39 are both defined by radii, e.g., between 5 and 25 mm. The<br>
curved cutting edge 38 coincides with a circular sector of about 85 to 97° while the curved<br>
cutting edge 39 coincides with a circular sector of about 95 to 107°. The curved edges 38,<br>
39 have radii that in a mounted state are substantially identical. The curved cutting edge<br>
constitutes at least 40 % of the extension of the cutting portion. The curved cutting edges<br>
38, 39 are convex in a side view according to Fig. 2C. The lower part 34B of the clearance<br>
surface 34 forms an obtuse angle to the bottom side 40 of the cutting insert. The upper part<br>
34A of the clearance surface 34 is substantially perpendicular in relation to the bottom side<br>
40 of the cutting insert. The upper part 34A ensures that associated cutting edge gets a<br>
relatively good strength.<br>
The bottom side 40 is provided with two recesses or grooves 41, 42. Each<br>
groove 41, 42 intersects solely one of the clearance surfaces 34 under the curved cutting<br>
edge 38, 39. Thus, the groove has a limited extension transverse to the longitudinal<br>
direction of the cutting insert and is limited by an end wall 43. Said extension of the<br>
groove is greater than 50 % of the width of the base surface 40 where the recess has been<br>
arranged. An area of the bottom side 40 remains accordingly unaffected by the groove and<br>
therefore a feasible support surface for the cutting insert is retained. The groove has in<br>
cross-section the shape of a truncated triangle. The groove 41 is by comparison with the<br>
groove 42 arranged closer the hole 31, and therefore the cutting insert can only be placed<br>
in one way in the cutting insert pocket.<br>
The curved cutting edge gives a positive and constantly axial cutting process<br>
along the entire edge.<br>
The cutting corners may be divided in to a sharp corner 36 and an obtuse<br>
corner 37. The obtuse corner has a double function to protect the cutting insert in the<br>
centre upon machining in solid material, such as upon drilling, as well as when the cutting<br>
insert has been arranged in the exterior cutting insert pocket, the corner 37 will generate a<br>
progressive curve, which enables variable machining of deep shoulders. The sharp corner<br>
36 will only be of use in the exterior cutting insert pocket 14. The obtuse corner 37 is<br>
defined in planar view according to Fig. 2A by a radius R1, which is at least twice as great<br>
as the radius R2 for the sharp corner 36. The obtuse corner 37 has a negative chip angle,<br>
and slopes in the direction towards the bottom side 40 from the chip surface 35. The sharp<br>
corner 36 has a positive chip angle and comprises a continuous extension of the chip<br>
surface 35. The cutting insert has an elevated central portion 44 around the hole 31. The<br>
portion 44 may act as a chip breaker. The portion 44 comprises markings, where one knob<br>
relates to peripheral mounting and two knobs means central mounting. The corresponding<br>
markings exist at the insert pockets 13 and 14.<br>
Figs. 3 A-3F show an alternative embodiment of a cutting insert 30'<br>
according to the present invention. What distinguishes the cutting insert 30' from the<br>
previously described cutting insert 30 is that the cutting insert 30' is formed with chip<br>
breakers optimised for machining of work materials being difficult to turn. Equal details<br>
have been provided with equal reference numerals. The chip breakers consist of recesses<br>
51, 52, 53 and 54 in the cutting edges 32, 33, 38 and 39, respectively. Each recess extends<br>
down into the upper part 34A of the clearance surface as well as also a distance into the<br>
chip surface 35. As may be seen from the planar view according to Fig. 3A, the recesses<br>
51, 54 and 52, 53 are arranged substantially in level with the grooves 41 and 42,<br>
respectively.<br>
The cutting insert 30, 30' may have a chamfer along the periphery of the<br>
bottom side 40 allowing the cutting insert pocket to be formed with relatively great radii.<br>
The cutting insert 30, 30' is mounted in the following way. The cutting insert<br>
30A is brought towards the exterior cutting insert pocket 13 so that the recesses 41, 42 are<br>
aligned with the projections 19, 20. In the correct position, the screw 15 can be inserted<br>
through the hole 31 and tightened in the boring 21. Thereby, the bottom side 40 of the<br>
cutting insert is pressed against the base surface 16 while three parts of the clearance<br>
surface 34B separated from each other will come to abutment against the shoulders 17, 18<br>
in the cutting insert pocket 13. The flanks of the projections will come to abutment against<br>
the recesses 41, 42 not until upon machining provided that the cutting insert on that<br>
occasion is allowed to move somewhat. Upon mounting of the cutting insert 30B in the<br>
interior cutting insert pocket 14, the bottom side 40 of the cutting insert is pressed against<br>
the base surface 16 while two parts of the clearance surface 34B separated from each other<br>
will come to abutment against the shoulders 17, 18 in the cutting insert pocket 13. As at<br>
the exterior cutting insert pocket, the projections and the recesses co-operate only under<br>
load of the cutting insert 30B. Because the recess 41 intersects the clearance surface only<br>
on one side, the axially front projection 19 will, upon a possible deflection of the screw,<br>
abut against the end wall 43, and thereby additionally secure the cutting insert against<br>
loosening.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a milling tool and a cutting insert,<br>
which enable precise positioning of the cutting insert, wherein the cutting insert can be<br>
clamped rigidly. The cutting insert is supported in a well-defined and optimised way. No<br>
undesired motions of the cutting insert arise.<br>
