				<td>MOBILE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE WITH REDUCED<br>
INTERFERING ENERGY FROM THE DISPLAY AND RELATED METHODS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
communications devices, and more particularly, to mobile<br>
wireless communications devices and related methods.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cellular communication systems continue to grow in<br>
popularity and have become an integral part of both personal<br>
and business communications. Cellular telephones allow<br>
users to place and receive phone calls most anywhere they<br>
travel. Moreover, as cellular telephone technology is<br>
increased, so too has the functionality of cellular devices.<br>
For example, many cellular devices now incorporate Personal<br>
Digital Assistant (PDA) features such as calendars, address<br>
books, task lists, calculators, memo and writing programs,<br>
etc. These multi-function devices usually allow users to<br>
wirelessly send and receive electronic mail (email) messages<br>
and access the internet via a cellular network and/or a<br>
wireless local area network (WLAN), for example.<br>
As the functionality of cellular communications devices<br>
continues to increase, so too does demand for smaller<br>
devices that are easier and more convenient for users to<br>
carry. As any circuit boards and electronic components<br>
thereon are reduced in size and placed closer together,<br>
including antenna and microphone components, various<br>
electronic components can pick up conductive energy and<br>
create interference within the system. For example, an<br>
internal surface mounted microphone could pick up conducted<br>
energy directly from a power amplifier or from the radiated<br>
energy emitted by an antenna. This unwanted reception of<br>
conducted/near field radiated energy from power amplifiers<br>
and antennae is particularly problematic in a packet burst<br>
transmission as part of a Global System for Mobile<br>
communications (GSM) system, including the 450 MHz, 900 MHz,<br>
1800 MHz and 1900 MHz frequency bands.<br>
Other interfering signals can be generated when the<br>
liquid crystal display (LCD) in some mobile wireless<br>
communications devices radiates radio frequency (RF)<br>
interfering energy and degrades receiver sensitivity. This<br>
is problematic where the interfering energy is generated by<br>
the microprocessor or central processing unit (CPU) of a<br>
wireless mobile communications device and fed into the LCD<br>
lines, along with interfering energy generated by the LCD<br>
itself. Other problems occur when the conducted and<br>
radiated interfering radio.frequency (RF) energy is .coupled<br>
to the mobile wireless communications device causing audio<br>
break through tests to fail for both the uplink and<br>
downlink. Even the keyboard circuits can create unwanted<br>
interference., problems. For example, the radio frequency<br>
receiver sensitivity is often degraded by the<br>
electromagnetic interference (EMF) of digital harmonics from<br>
the microprocessor or CPU via the keyboard because of the<br>
resulting loop formed by any keyboard circuits. In some<br>
instances, strong RF energy, for example, the transmitted<br>
power from the radio via the antenna interferes with or<br>
couples to the microprocessor or CPU input/output (I/O)<br>
lines of a mobile wireless communications.device through the<br>
keyboard Key-In and Key-Out lines and causes a reset of the<br>
microprocessor or CPU.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
reduce interfering energy from a processor and display into<br>
display connection lines operatively connected between a<br>
display connector and processor on a circuit board within a<br>
mobile wireless communications device.<br>
A mobile wireless communications device includes a<br>
housing and a circuit board carried by the housing and<br>
including radio frequency (RF) circuitry and a processor<br>
carried by the circuit board and operative with each other.<br>
A. display connector is mounted on the circuit board and<br>
adapted to be connected to a display. The display can be<br>
carried by the housing and formed as a liquid crystal<br>
display (LCD) and the display connector would be a LCD<br>
connector.<br>
Display connection lines are carried by the circuit<br>
board and interconnect the display connector and processor<br>
for carrying .signals from the processor for display on any<br>
display connected to the display connector. Filters, such<br>
as electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters are carried by<br>
the circuit board and connected into the display connection<br>
lines for reducing any interfering energy from the processor<br>
in a display into the display connection lines.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a bypass capacitor is<br>
connected to ground and into each respective display<br>
connection line. The filters can be serially connected into<br>
each display connection line. Each filter could be formed<br>
as a ferrite inductor or an LC filter serially connected<br>
into each display connection line.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the housing is<br>
configured for handheld operation. The RF circuitry and<br>
processor can be operative as a cellular communications<br>
device. The filters could also be formed as a plurality of<br>
arrays of LC filters serially connected into each display<br>
connection line. A voltage regulator circuit could be<br>
operatively connected to the filters wherein the RF<br>
circuitry and processor are operative as a Wireless Local<br>
Area Network (WLAN) device. A second filter element could<br>
be connected into each display connection line and serially<br>
connected to each other filter that is connected within each<br>
display connection line and serially connected to each other<br>
filter that is connected within said display connection<br>
lines. Each second filter element could be formed as an<br>
inductor. An antenna could also be mounted within the<br>
housing and operative with the RF circuitry. The connection<br>
lines could be formed as LCD connection lines and formed<br>
parallel to each other. A method is also set forth.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully<br>
hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in<br>
which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
This invention may, however, be embodied in many different<br>
forms and should not be construed as limited to the<br>
embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are<br>
provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and<br>
complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention<br>
to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like<br>
elements throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate<br>
similar elements in alternative embodiments.<br>
The interference problems created when an internal<br>
microphone, for example, a surface-mounted technology (SMT)<br>
microphone "picks-up" or receives conducted energy directly<br>
from a power amplifier and/or from an antenna during a GSM<br>
transmitter packet burst are overcome with the present<br>
invention. The use of an appropriate RF shielding and<br>
filters in one non-limiting example reduces the audible buzz<br>
in an audio circuit, for example, as used in the mobile<br>
wireless communications device of FIGS. 1-3. In one nonlimiting<br>
example, a separately isolated radio frequency (RF)<br>
shield covers the internal microphone and its associated<br>
circuitry to prevent conducted and near field radiated<br>
energy emitted by a power amplifier from interfering with<br>
the microphone operation. The RF shield also provides<br>
adequate isolation from the radiated energy emitted by the<br>
antenna during a GSM packet burst. This RF shield is<br>
operative in conjunction with an acoustic seal to ensure a<br>
good acoustic frequency response.<br>
The different non-limiting embodiments and examples of<br>
the present invention described throughout the following<br>
description offers several advantages over prior art mobile<br>
wireless communications devices, systems and associated<br>
methods. By adding electromagnetic interference (EMI)<br>
filters to liquid crystal display (LCD) connection lines,<br>
the central processing unit (CPU) or microprocessor noise is<br>
prevented from reaching the LCD. As a result, the prior art<br>
problems associated with an LCD radiating radio frequency<br>
(RF) interfering energy and causing degradation of receiver<br>
sensitivity, or the microprocessor or CPU generating any<br>
interfering energy, is overcome. These prior art<br>
disadvantages have been overcome in one particular<br>
embodiment of the invention by adding filter components to<br>
the LCD circuitry and eliminating any noise before it can be<br>
radiated by the LCD and interfere with a received signal.<br>
The prior art problems associated with the<br>
electromagnetic interference (EMI) in an audio break-through<br>
test for communications devices such as shown in FIGS. 1-3<br>
is also overcome by reducing the conducted and radiated<br>
interfering RF energy that is coupled to the mobile wireless<br>
communications device, which could create an audible noise<br>
and cause RF immunity failure in both the uplink and<br>
downlink communications. An EMI filter can be added to the<br>
microphone, a USB connector, speaker audio circuits and<br>
headset connector at desired circuit points to eliminate the<br>
conducted interfering RF energy from the coupling to the<br>
audio circuits via a USB charging cable and the radiated,<br>
interfering RF energy that is coupled to any audio circuits<br>
resulting from the pick-up on a headset cable or other<br>
similar connector.<br>
The present invention also overcomes the prior art<br>
electromagnetic interference problems associated when the<br>
sensitivity of a radio frequency receiver such as the type<br>
shown in FIGS. 1-3 is degraded by any electromagnetic<br>
interference, for example, digital harmonics from the<br>
microprocessor or CPU via the keypad (keyboard) . It is<br>
known that the sensitivity of the RF receiver is<br>
significantly degraded by the digital noise generated from<br>
the microprocessor or other CPU through the Key_In/Key_Out<br>
lines and into the keyboard traces and picked-up by the<br>
antenna. By adding within the keyboard traces and<br>
Key_In/Key_Out lines, EMI filter circuit, for example,<br>
filter array such as formed from series resistors or<br>
inductors, shunt capacitors, series EMI ferrite beads or a<br>
combination of resistor, inductor and capacitor, and ferrite<br>
beads, the receiver sensitivity is improved.<br>
The present invention also overcomes the prior<br>
disadvantages when strong RF energy, for example, the<br>
transmitted power from a mobile wireless communications<br>
device such as shown in FIGS. 1-3 and its antenna interferes<br>
with or couples to the microprocessor or other CPU<br>
input/output lines through the keyboard Key_In and Key_0ut<br>
lines and causes the microprocessor or CPU to reset. In<br>
accordance with one non-limiting embodiment, series elements<br>
such as resistors can be applied to the keyboard Key_In and<br>
Key_Out lines to dampen the RF energy picked up by these<br>
lines from either the generated internal energy or external<br>
interfering signals. Specific resistor values are selected<br>
to eliminate the RF energy, but also ensure normal<br>
CPU/keyboard operation. Other elements can be used, for<br>
example, series inductors, inductor and capacitor, or<br>
ferrite beads.<br>
A brief description will-now proceed relative to FIGS.<br>
1-3, which disclose an example of a mobile wireless<br>
communications device, for example, a handheld portable<br>
cellular radio, which can incorporate the non-limiting<br>
examples of the various circuits of the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 1-3 are representative non-limiting examples of the<br>
many different types of functional circuit components and<br>
their interconnection, and operative for use with the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, an example of a<br>
mobile wireless communications device 20, such as a handheld<br>
portable cellular radio, which can be used with the present<br>
invention is first described. This device 20 illustratively<br>
includes a housing 21 having an upper portion 46 and a lower<br>
portion 47, and a dielectric substrate (i.e., circuit board)<br>
67, such as a conventional printed circuit board (PCB)<br>
substrate, for example, carried by the housing. A housing<br>
cover (not shown in detail) would typically cover the front<br>
portion of the housing. The term circuit board 67 as used<br>
hereinafter can refer to any dielectric substrate, PCB,<br>
ceramic substrate or other circuit carrying structure for<br>
carrying signal circuits and electronic components within<br>
the mobile wireless communications device 20. The<br>
illustrated housing 21 is a static housing, for example, as<br>
opposed to a flip or sliding housing which are used in many<br>
cellular telephones. However, these and other housing<br>
configurations may also be used.<br>
Circuitry 48 is carried by the circuit board 67, such<br>
as a microprocessor, memory, one or more wireless<br>
transceivers (e.g., cellular, WLAN, etc.), which includes RF<br>
circuitry, including audio and power circuitry, including<br>
any keyboard circuitry. It should be understood that<br>
keyboard circuitry could be on a separate keyboard, etc., as<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. A battery<br>
(not shown) is also preferably carried by the housing 21 for<br>
supplying power to the circuitry 48. The term RF circuitry<br>
could encompass the .interoperable RF transceiver circuitry,<br>
power circuitry and audio circuitry.<br>
Furthermore, an audio output transducer 49 (e.g., a<br>
speaker) is carried by an upper portion 46 of the housing 21<br>
and connected to the circuitry 48. One or more user input<br>
interface devices, such as a keypad (keyboard) 23 (FIG. 2),<br>
is also preferably carried by the housing 21 and connected<br>
to the circuitry 48. The term keypad as used herein also<br>
refers to the term keyboard, indicating the user input<br>
devices having lettered and/or numbered keys commonly known<br>
and other embodiments, including multi-top or predictive<br>
entry modes. Other examples of user input interface devices<br>
include a scroll wheel 37 and a back button 36. Of course,<br>
it will be appreciated that other user input interface<br>
devices (e.g., a stylus or touch screen interface) may be<br>
used in other embodiments.<br>
An antenna 45 is preferably positioned at the lower<br>
portion 47 in the housing and can be formed as a pattern of<br>
conductive traces that make an antenna circuit, which<br>
physically forms the antenna. It is connected to the<br>
circuitry 48 on the main circuit board 67. In one nonlimiting<br>
example, the antenna could be formed on an antenna<br>
circuit board section that extends from the circuit board at<br>
the lower portion of the housing. By placing the antenna 45<br>
adjacent the lower portion 47 of the housing 21, the<br>
distance is advantageously increased between the antenna and<br>
the user's head when the phone is in use to aid in complying<br>
with applicable SAR requirements. Also, a separate keyboard<br>
circuit board could be used.<br>
More particularly, a user will typically hold the upper<br>
portion of the housing 21 very close to his head so that the<br>
audio output transducer 49 is directly next to his' ear.<br>
Yet, the lower portion 47 of the housing 21 where an audio<br>
input transducer (i.e., microphone) is located need not be<br>
placed directly next to a user's mouth, and can be held away<br>
from the user's mouth. That is, holding the audio input<br>
transducer close to the user's mouth may not only be<br>
uncomfortable for the user, but it may also distort the<br>
user's voice in some circumstances. In addition, the<br>
placement of the antenna 45 adjacent the lower portion 47 of<br>
the housing 21 also advantageously spaces the antenna<br>
farther away from the user's brain.<br>
Another important benefit of placing the antenna 45<br>
adjacent the lower portion 47 of the housing 21 is that this<br>
may allow for less impact on antenna performance due to<br>
blockage by a user's hand. That is, users typically hold<br>
cellular phones toward the middle to upper portion of the<br>
phone housing, and are therefore more likely to put their<br>
hands over such an antenna than they are an antenna mounted<br>
adjacent the lower portion 47 of the housing 21.<br>
Accordingly, more reliable performance may be achieved from<br>
placing the antenna 45 adjacent the lower portion 47 of the<br>
housing 21.<br>
Still another benefit of this configuration is that it<br>
provides more room for one or more auxiliary input/output<br>
 (I/O) devices 50 to be carried at the upper portion 46 of<br>
the housing. Furthermore, by separating the antenna 45 from<br>
the auxiliary I/O device (s) 50, this may allow for reduced<br>
interference therebetween.<br>
Some examples of auxiliary I/O devices 50 include a<br>
WLAN (e.g., Bluetooth™, IEEE 802.11) antenna for providing<br>
WLAN communication capabilities, and/or a satellite<br>
positioning system (e.g., GPS, Galileo, etc.) antenna for<br>
providing position location capabilities, as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. Other examples of<br>
auxiliary I/O devices 50 include a second audio output<br>
transducer (e.g., a speaker for speaker phone operation),<br>
and a camera lens for providing digital camera capabilities,<br>
an electrical device connector (e.g., USB, headphone, secure<br>
digital (SD) or memory card, etc.).<br>
It should be noted that the term "input/output" as used<br>
herein for the auxiliary I/O device (s) 50 means that such<br>
devices may have input and/or output capabilities, and they<br>
need not provide both in all embodiments. That is, devices<br>
*•-<br>
such as camera lenses may only receive an optical input, for<br>
example, while a headphone jack may only provide an audio<br>
output.<br>
The device 20 further illustratively includes a display<br>
22, for example, a liquid crystal display (LCD) carried by<br>
the housing 21 and connected to the circuitry 48. A back<br>
button 36 and scroll wheel 37 can also be connected to the<br>
circuitry 48 for allowing a user to navigate menus, text,<br>
etc., as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The scroll wheel 37 may also be referred to as a "thumb<br>
wheel" or a "track wheel" in some instances. The keypad 23<br>
illustratively includes a plurality of multi-symbol keys 24<br>
each having indicia of a plurality of respective symbols<br>
thereon. The keypad 23 also illustratively includes an<br>
alternate function key 25, a next key 26, a space key 27, a<br>
shift key 28, a return (or enter) key 29, and a<br>
backspace/delete key 30.<br>
The next key 26 is also used to enter a "*" symbol upon<br>
first pressing or actuating the alternate function key 25.<br>
Similarly, the space key 27, shift key 28 and backspace key<br>
30 are used to enter a "0" and "#", respectively, upon first<br>
actuating the alternate function key 25. The keypad 23<br>
further illustratively includes a send key 31, an end key<br>
32, and a convenience (i.e., menu) key 39 for use in placing<br>
cellular telephone calls, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Moreover, the symbols on each key 24 are arranged in<br>
top and bottom rows. The symbols in the bottom rows are<br>
entered when a user presses a key 24 without first pressing<br>
the alternate function key 25, while the top row symbols are<br>
entered by first pressing the alternate function key. As<br>
seen in FIG. 2, the multi-symbol keys 24 are arranged in the<br>
first three rows on the keypad 23 below the send and end<br>
keys 31, 32. Furthermore, the letter symbols on each of the<br>
keys 24 are arranged to define a QWERTY layout. That is, the<br>
letters on the keypad 23 are presented in a three-row<br>
format, with the letters of each row being in the same order<br>
and relative position as in a standard QWERTY keypad.<br>
Each row of keys (including the fourth row of function<br>
keys 25-29) is arranged in five columns. The multi-symbol<br>
keys 24 in the second, third, and fourth columns of the<br>
first, second, and third rows have numeric indicia thereon<br>
(i.e., 1 through 9) accessible by first actuating the<br>
alternate function key 25. Coupled with the next, space, and<br>
shift keys 26, 27, 28, which respectively enter a "*", "0",<br>
and "#" upon first actuating the alternate function key 25,<br>
as noted above, this set of keys defines a standard<br>
13<br>
telephone keypad layout, as would be found on a traditional<br>
touch-tone telephone, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile wireless communications device<br>
20 as described may advantageously be used not only as a<br>
traditional cellular phone, but it may also be conveniently<br>
used for sending and/or receiving data over a cellular or<br>
other network, such as Internet and email data, for example.<br>
Of course, other keypad configurations may also be used in<br>
other embodiments. Multi-tap or predictive entry modes may<br>
be used for typing e-mails, etc. as will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
The antenna 45 is preferably formed as a multifrequency<br>
band antenna, which provides enhanced transmission<br>
and reception characteristics over multiple operating<br>
frequencies. More particularly, the antenna 45 is designed<br>
to provide high gain, desired impedance matching, and meet<br>
applicable SAR requirements over a relatively wide bandwidth<br>
and multiple cellular frequency bands. By way of example,<br>
the antenna 45 preferably operates over five bands, namely a<br>
850 MHz Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) band,<br>
a 900 MHz GSM band, a DCS band, a PCS band, and a WCDMA band<br>
(i.e., up to about 2100 MHz), although it may be used for<br>
other bands/frequencies as well. To conserve space, the<br>
antenna 45 nay advantageously be implemented in three<br>
dimensions although it may be implemented in two-dimensional<br>
or planar embodiments as well.<br>
The mobile wireless communications device shown in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 can incorporate e-mail and messaging accounts<br>
and provide different functions such as composing e-mail,<br>
PIN messages, and SMS messages. The device can manage<br>
messages through an appropriate menu that can be retrieved<br>
by choosing a messages icon. An address book function could<br>
add contacts, allow management of an address book, set<br>
address book options and manage SIM card phone books. A<br>
phone menu could allow for the making and answering of phone<br>
calls using different phone features, managing phone call<br>
logs, setting phone options, and viewing phone information.<br>
A browser application could permit the browsing of web<br>
pages, configuring a browser, adding bookmarks, and changing<br>
browser options. Other applications could include a task,<br>
memo pad, calculator, alarm and games, as well as handheld<br>
options with various references.<br>
A calendar icon can be chosen for entering a calendar<br>
program that can be used for establishing and managing<br>
events such as meetings or appointments. The calendar<br>
program could be any type of messaging or<br>
appointment/meeting program that allows an organizer to<br>
establish an event, for example, an appointment or meeting.<br>
A non-limiting example of various functional components<br>
that can be used in the exemplary mobile wireless<br>
communications device 20 of FIGS. 1 and 2 is further<br>
described in the example below with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
The device 20 illustratively includes a housing 120, a<br>
keypad 140 and an output device 160. The output device 160<br>
shown is preferably a display, which is preferably a full<br>
graphic LCD. Other types of output devices may<br>
alternatively be used. A processing device 180 is contained<br>
within the housing 120 and is coupled between the keypad 140<br>
and the display 160. The processing device 180 controls the<br>
operation of the display 160, as well as the overall<br>
operation of the mobile device 20, in response to actuation<br>
cf keys on the keypad 140 by the user.<br>
The housing 120 may be elongated vertically, or may<br>
take on other sizes and shapes (including clamshell housing<br>
structures). The keypad may include a mode selection key, or<br>
other hardware or software for switching between text entry<br>
and telephony entry.<br>
In addition to the processing device 180, other parts<br>
of the mobile device 20 are shown schematically in FIG. 3.<br>
These include a communications subsystem 101; a short-range<br>
communications subsystem 102; the keypad 140 and the display<br>
160, along with other input/output devices 106, 108, 110 and<br>
112; as well as memory devices 116, 118 and various other<br>
device subsystems 121. The mobile device 20 is preferably a<br>
two-way RF communications device having voice and data<br>
communications capabilities. In addition, the mobile device<br>
20 preferably. has the capability to communicate with other<br>
computer systems via the Internet.<br>
Operating system software executed by the processing<br>
device 180 is preferably stored in a persistent store, such<br>
as the flash memory 116, but may be stored in other types of<br>
memory devices, such as a read only memory (ROM) or similar<br>
storage element. In addition, system software, specific<br>
device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily<br>
*•--<br>
loaded into a volatile store, such as the random access<br>
memory (RAM) 118. Communications signals received by the<br>
mobile device may also be stored in the RAM 118.<br>
The processing device 180, in addition to its operating<br>
system functions, enables execution of software applications<br>
130A-130N on the device 20. A predetermined set of<br>
applications that control basic device operations, such as<br>
data and voice communications 13 OA and 13 OB, may be<br>
installed on the device 20 during manufacture. In addition,<br>
a personal information manager (PIM) application may be<br>
installed during manufacture. The PIM is preferably capable<br>
of organizing and managing data items, such as e-mail,<br>
calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items.<br>
The PIM application is also preferably capable of sending<br>
and receiving data items via a wireless network 141.<br>
Preferably, the PIM data items are seamlessly integrated,<br>
synchronized and updated via the wireless network 141 with<br>
the device user's corresponding data items stored or<br>
associated with a host computer system.<br>
Communication functions, including data and voice<br>
communications, are performed through the communications<br>
subsystem 101, and possibly through the short-range<br>
communications subsystem. The communications subsystem 101<br>
includes a receiver 150, a transmitter 152, and one or more<br>
antennae 154 and 156. In addition, the communications<br>
subsystem 101 also includes a processing module, such as a<br>
digital signal processor (D3?) 158, and local oscillators<br>
(LOs) 161. The specific design and implementation of the<br>
communications subsystem 101 is dependent upon the<br>
communications network in which the mobile device 20 is<br>
intended to operate. For example, the mobile device 20 may<br>
include a communications subsystem 101 designed to operate<br>
with the MobitexTV, DataTAC™ or General Packet Radio Service<br>
(GPRS) mobile data communications networks, and also<br>
designed to operate with any of a variety of voice<br>
communications networks, such as AMPS, TDKA, CDMA, PCS, GSM,<br>
etc. Other types of data and voice networks, both separate<br>
and integrated, may also be utilized with the mobile device<br>
20.<br>
Network access requirements vary depending upon the<br>
type of communication system. For example, in the Mobitex™<br>
and DataTAC™ networks, mobile devices are registered on the<br>
network using a unique personal identification number or PIN<br>
associated with each device. In GPRS networks, however,<br>
network access is associated with a subscriber or user of a<br>
device. A GPRS device therefore requires a subscriber<br>
identity moauxe, commonly referred to as a SIM card, in<br>
order to operate on a GPRS network.<br>
When required network registration or activation<br>
procedures have been completed, the mobile device 20 may<br>
send and receive communications signals over the<br>
communication network 141. Signals received from the<br>
communications network 141 by the antenna 154 are routed to<br>
the receiver 150, which provides for signal amplification,<br>
frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection,<br>
etc., and may also provide analog to digital- conversion.<br>
Analog-to-digital conversion of the received signal allows<br>
the DSP 158 to perform more complex communications<br>
functions, such as demodulation and decoding. In a similar<br>
manner, signals to be transmitted to the network 141 are<br>
processed (e.g., modulated and encoded) by the DSP 158 and<br>
are then provided to the transmitter 152 for digital to<br>
analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering,<br>
amplification and transmission to the communication network<br>
141 (or networks) via the antenna 156.<br>
In addition to processing communications signals, the<br>
DSP 158 provides for control of the receiver 150 and the<br>
transmitter 152. For example, gains applied to<br>
communications signals in the receiver 150 and transmitter<br>
152 may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain<br>
control algorithms implemented in the DSP 158.<br>
In a data communications mode, a received signal, such<br>
as a text message or web page download, is processed by the<br>
communications subsystem 101 and is input to the processing<br>
device 180. The received signal is then further processed by<br>
the processing device 180 for an output to the display 160,<br>
or alternatively to some other auxiliary I/O device 106. A<br>
device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail<br>
messages, using the keypad 140 and/or some other auxiliary<br>
I/O device 106, such as a touchpad, a rocker switch, , a<br>
thumb-wheel, or some other type of input device. The<br>
composed data items may then be transmitted over the<br>
communications network 141 via the communications subsystem<br>
101.<br>
In a voice communications mode, overall operation of<br>
the device is substantially similar to the data<br>
communications mode, except that received signals are output<br>
to a speaker 110, and signals for transmission are generated<br>
by a microphone 112. Alternative voice or audio I/O<br>
subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may<br>
also be implemented on the device 20. In addition, the<br>
display 160 may also be utilized in voice communications<br>
mode, for example to display the identity of a calling<br>
party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call<br>
related information.<br>
Any short-range communications subsystem enables<br>
communication between the mobile device 20 and other<br>
proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily be<br>
similar devices. For example, the short-range<br>
communications subsystem may include an infrared device and<br>
associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth™<br>
communications module to provide for communication with<br>
similarly-enabled systems and devices.<br>
In accordance with a non-limiting example of the<br>
present invention, FIG. 4 shows an example of a circuit<br>
layout on part of the circuit board 67 that can be included<br>
within the mobile wireless communications device 20 of FIGS.<br>
1-3, and showing a front cover removed from a housing to<br>
illustrate a surface mounted microphone 200 and its<br>
circuitry and associated noise isolation components as will<br>
be explained in greater detail below. The circuit board 67<br>
includes radio frequency (RF) circuitry, for example,<br>
cellular telephone conununications circuitry, which is<br>
mounted in first and second isolation shields or "cans"<br>
210,212, as often called 'by those skilled in the art,<br>
forming a compartment on the circuit board, each which<br>
receive the RF circuitry. Each can 210,212 forms a radio<br>
frequency isolation compartment and may include sides and a<br>
top. The first can 210 includes a transceiver chip set 220,<br>
for example, a transmitter chip, receiver chip, and local<br>
oscillator chip as non-limiting examples with those chips<br>
labeled A, B and C. Other illustrated components could<br>
include the various resistors, capacitors, amplifiers,<br>
regulators and other circuit components common to those'<br>
devices, but not explained in detail.<br>
Located outside first and second isolation cans<br>
210,212, but mounted on the circuit board 67, is a liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD) connector 230 and a keyboard connector<br>
232, as well as associated circuit components 234. These<br>
components 230, 232 and 234 can be configured in different<br>
configurations besides the configuration illustrated in the<br>
non-limiting example of FIG. 4. The compartment within the<br>
second isolation can 212 includes a power amplifier 236 and<br>
switch diplexer 238. Other components 240 are mounted<br>
within the compartment and form the resistors, capacitors,<br>
transistors, and inductors necessary to drive the audio and<br>
power circuits for the microphone, power amplifier and other<br>
circuits.<br>
To provide microphone isolation, a radio frequency<br>
isolation shield 250, formed in the illustrated non-limiting<br>
example as a third isolation "can" 250, is positioned at a<br>
corner of the second "can" 212, and forms another isolation<br>
compartment at this corner. The shield is formed as a<br>
separate metallic housing secured to the circuit board and<br>
surrounding the microphone, effectively covering, i.e.,<br>
shielding the entire microphone. Although a "can"<br>
configuration formed as a metallic housing with top and<br>
sides and is used for the RF shield, other configurations<br>
could be used. The compartment formed by the isolation<br>
shield 250 receives a microphone 200 formed preferably as a<br>
surface mounted microphone integrated circuit chip 200 on<br>
the circuit board 67. As illustrated in this non-limiting<br>
configuration, this places the microphone chip adjacent to<br>
the bottom center of the device 20 where the sound hole is<br>
typically located in the cover of a cellular phone or<br>
similar mobile wireless communications device. The present<br>
invention overcomes the drawback when the microphone 200 is<br>
in relatively close proximity to the RF circuitry such ~hat<br>
the microphone picks-up unwanted noise. This is<br>
particularly problematic _ when the RF circuitry is<br>
transmitting Global Systems for Mobile communications (GSM)<br>
transmission packet bursts, for example, but not limited to<br>
GSM. This type of noise often results in an audible buzz<br>
during operation. Furthermore, the noise problem can be<br>
further compounded by increases in diameter of any sound<br>
hole in the housing cover, even small diameter holes. This<br>
problem worsens as the diameter of the acoustical tube that<br>
connects the sound hole to the microphone increases.<br>
To reduce this noise resulting from the RF circuitry,<br>
the metallic shield or "can" forming an isolation shield<br>
includes a side and top metal wall, i.e., forming a complete<br>
isolation shield surrounding, i.e., covering the microphone<br>
200 and its associated circuitry to provide isolation from<br>
the RF circuitry. This isolation shield provides the<br>
necessary isolation from the RF amplifiers and from any<br>
energy radiated from the antenna.<br>
FIG. 5 shows an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view<br>
of the microphone 200 of FIG. 4 when the communications<br>
device 20 is assembled and a housing cover, such as<br>
including keyboard plastics, is positioned over the housing<br>
and circuit board. The microphone 200 has an associated<br>
assembly that includes a rubber or other polymer acoustical<br>
tube 252 that connects a sound hole 254 in the housing cover<br>
256 forming part of keyboard plastics with the microphone<br>
200, which extends through a hole 258 in the top of the<br>
microphone isolation shield 250. It should be understood<br>
that other suitable materials could also be used for the<br>
acoustical tube 252. The housing cover 256 could be formed<br>
from plastic or similar material and have access holes (not<br>
shown) for -corresponding keys of a telephone keypad, or in<br>
the case of a cellular phone with a personal digital<br>
assistant (PDA) or e-mail/Internet capabilities, an<br>
alphanumeric keypad, as appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art and shown in FIG. 2 as a non-limiting example.<br>
The keyboard plastics, such as shown in FIG. 5, are<br>
preferably formed as a separate keyboard positioned over the<br>
circuit board 67. This separate keyboard includes a<br>
keyboard, i.e., keypad connector, which engages the keyboard<br>
connector 232. Mounted on the keyboard are a keypad array<br>
circuit, the keypad or keyboard connector that engages the<br>
keyboard connector on the main circuit board 67, and Key_In<br>
and KeyJDut lines that connect the keypad connector and the<br>
keypad array. These lines could be formed as signal traces.<br>
Examples of these components on a keyboard are shown in FIG.<br>
12. This keyboard could be part of the housing cover 256 or<br>
separate from the housing cover. Thus, throughout this<br>
description, the term housing cover is broad enough to<br>
encompass the keyboard as a separate plastic or similarly<br>
configured keyboard or other support that covers all or a<br>
portion of the circuit board 67 and contains the keypad<br>
connector, Key_In/Key_Out lines and keypad array circuit,<br>
such as shown in FIG. 12, as a non-limiting example.<br>
In addition, an isolation ring 260 is positioned<br>
between the microphone isolation shield 250 and the housing<br>
cover 256. This ring 260 surrounds the acoustical tube 252.<br>
When the communications device 20 is assembled and the front<br>
housing cover 256 is installed, the downward force on the<br>
ring 260 causes it to contact both the microphone isolation<br>
shield 250 and the housing cover 256 to provide RF and<br>
acoustic sealing, as will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art. The ring 260 is preferably formed from a metal<br>
material. The isolation shield 250 and its associated ring<br>
260 could be configured and dimensioned to provide a desired<br>
acoustic frequency response, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Representative distances as non-limiting examples for<br>
the configuration shown in FIG. 5 are now set forth. It<br>
should be understood that these non-limiting examples of<br>
dimensions can vary depending on the design, configuration,<br>
and frequencies used.<br>
The distance between the housing cover 256 and the top<br>
surface isolation of microphone isolation shield 250 could<br>
be about 0.1 mm, for example, as indicated by dimension "A"<br>
and the sound hole 254 in the housing cover 256 could be<br>
about 2.0 mm or less as represented by the dimension "B" .<br>
The acoustical tube 252 may have a diameter of about 5.0 mm<br>
as represented by the dimension "C" and the diameter of the<br>
isolation ring 260 can be about 10.0 mm as represented by<br>
the dimension "D" , as non-limiting examples. Additional<br>
filters, such as ferrite choke filters, for example, can be<br>
used inside the microphone isolation shield 250 to reduce<br>
conducted interference to a greater extent, as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. Furthermore, the<br>
microphone isolation shield 250 can be implemented with<br>
devices other than cellular telephones. For example, a<br>
portable, wireless local area network (WLAN) communications<br>
device may transmit voice/sound data over a WLAN device and<br>
thus include a microphone positioned in a similar manner to<br>
that discussed above. Similar noise reduction components<br>
could be used as non-limiting examples.<br>
It should be understood that the acoustic channel<br>
formed within the acoustic tube 252 allows ~he<br>
communications device 20 to pass a specific acoustical mark<br>
for certification ar.d allows a certain frequency response<br>
out of the cavity and. its microphone isolation shield 250,<br>
i.e., for network certification.<br>
As noted before, the LCD in certain examples of rhe<br>
communications device 20 can radiate RF interfering energy<br>
and degrade receiver sensitivity. Interfering energy can<br>
also be generated by the CPU of the communications device<br>
20. This energy car. be fed into the LCD lines, along with<br>
interfering energy generated by the LCD. ^ FIG. 6 is a<br>
schematic circuit diagram showing a portion of a LCD circuit<br>
290 having an LCD connector 300 and. its filter components<br>
associated therewith that can be used with the mobile<br>
wireless communications device of FIGS. 1-3. FIG. 7 shows a<br>
LCD display circuit 350, LCD connector 400 and filzer<br>
components operative with a wireless local area network<br>
(WLAN) communications device using similar features<br>
explained with reference to The mobile wireless<br>
communications device of FIGS. 1-3. The dashed line portion<br>
shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 indicates the. general layout of LCD<br>
circuit components that could be included on a circuit<br>
board, including associated filter components and LCD<br>
connection lines.<br>
The LCD 160, such as shown in FIG. 3, has a<br>
microprocessor (or CPU) 180 connection to the display 160<br>
via an LCD connector 300 such as shown in FIG. 6. This<br>
connection is sometimes problematic because the LCD<br>
generates relatively high quality visual outputs but also<br>
generates radio frequency (RF) energy. When used in a<br>
mobile wireless communications device 20 such as a mobile<br>
handheld cellular phone, a PDA or a wireless local area<br>
network (WLAN) device, for example, the RF energy from the<br>
LCD can cause interference with the RF components of the<br>
device because they are typically in relatively close<br>
proximity to each other. This is particularly true with<br>
devices that use internal antennas, for example antennas<br>
positioned within a housing on a printed circuit board (PCB)<br>
or other similar antenna.<br>
These microprocessors or CPUs generally operate at<br>
fairly high clock speeds, for example, based upon a 30 MHz<br>
clock signal which could be increased to three or four times<br>
that speed for internal use by the microprocessor. Thus,<br>
the microprocessor 180 may introduce harmonics into the<br>
connection lines to the LCD, which may in turn create<br>
further RF interference, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, electromagnetic interference (EMI)<br>
filters 310 are advantageously connected to the connection<br>
lines 312 extending between the microprocessor 180 and the<br>
LCD connector 300 to reduce the interference caused by<br>
harmonics from the microprocessor 180. The dashed line 314<br>
in FIG. 6 indicates a functional area on the circuit board<br>
67 which would include the various components, including the<br>
LCD connector 300 and the EMI filters 310 associated with<br>
the LCD connector 300.<br>
By way of example, EMI filters can include respective<br>
bypass capacitors 320 connected between the LCD connection<br>
lines 312 and ground 322 as illustrated. The capacitors 320<br>
that are shown in FIG. 6 can have a value of about 68 pF.<br>
In association with the capacitors 320 and the LCD<br>
connection lines 312 are EMI filters connected to the LCD<br>
circuitry to reduce the RF energy before it can be radiated<br>
by the LCD and interfere with the RF components. For<br>
example, the EMI filters can be EMI filters 324 such as KNA<br>
series EMI filters manufactured by AVX Corp. Examples of<br>
such filters include those sold under the designation as KNA<br>
32200 and sirr.ilar, KNA 32XXX series filters that are<br>
illustrated in the embodiments shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. Of<br>
course, other suitable EMI filters can also be used.<br>
The LCD connector 300 typically includes a mounting<br>
plate-to-ground pin, and in the illustrated example, two<br>
such mounting plate-to-ground pins are labeled MP1 and MP2.<br>
The filters 324 are typically LC filters that give an<br>
excellent frequency response with respect to any attenuating<br>
noise coming from the microprocessor 180 to the LCD 160.<br>
These filters 324 are particularly adequate with respect to<br>
different frequency bands, e.g., the GSM 900 MHz and PCS<br>
1900 MHz. These filters give about 30 to 40 decibel (dB)<br>
attenuation on these bands. Each filter 324 can be formed<br>
as a filter array as illustrated, for example, as an array<br>
of inductors 324a as illustrated.<br>
The described LCD circuit can also include an L3AT<br>
terminal 330 and VBAT terminal 332, each having an<br>
appropriate filter 325 as illustrated in FIG. 6, using a pie<br>
configuration of capacitors 326 and inductors 328 for<br>
filtering.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a LCD display circuit 350 that could be<br>
used with a mobile wireless communications device 20 such as<br>
26<br>
a WLAN device and having a somewhat different circuit<br>
footprint configuration as compared to the circuit footprint<br>
configuration shown in FIG. 6. Similar functional<br>
components in this embodiment are given reference numerals<br>
starting in the 400 series. This circuit 350 uses 12 pF<br>
capacitors 420 connected to ground 422, the LCD connector<br>
400, and into the LCD connection lines 412, which in turn,<br>
connect into the filter 424, formed as a filter array as<br>
illustrated and similar to that shown in FIG. 6. In this<br>
particular embodiment, however, ferrite beads 460 or similar<br>
inductor components are connected between the LCD connection<br>
lines 412 and the filter arrays 424, as illustrated. The<br>
circuit configuration in FIG. 7 is somewhat different than<br>
the circuit illustrated in FIG. 6 because a WLAN<br>
communications device would work at about 2.4 GHz. The<br>
ferrite beads 460 in combination with the capacitors 420 and<br>
filter arrays 424 are found to enhance performance. A<br>
voltage regulator circuit 470 can be operatively connected<br>
to the filter array 424, lines 412 and capacitors 420 as<br>
illustrated, and include appropriate ground, enable, Vin and<br>
Vout terminals.<br>
The KNA series of filters 324, 424 are a distributed<br>
constant type LC filter that prevents ringing caused by<br>
circuit impedance. These types of filters are suitable for<br>
digital circuits and visual line circuits. They have an<br>
excellent noise attenuation over wide frequency ranges and<br>
is a low profile of about H=1.0 mm thickness that is<br>
suitable for small electronic devices. They can have a<br>
cutoff frequency at above 200 MHz and 100 milliamp rated<br>
current with 25 volts DC.<br>
Referring once again to FIG. 3, the wireless mobile<br>
communications device 20 such as a handheld cellular<br>
communications device, includes a microprocessor (or CPU)<br>
180, microphone 112, speaker 110, and serial communications<br>
port 108, such as an RS-232 or universal serial bus (USB)<br>
port, for example. The microphone 112 and speaker 110 are<br>
used for audio (i.e., voice) input and output during<br>
cellular telephone calls, for example, as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. The device can<br>
also include auxiliary input/output (I/O) connectors 106,<br>
such as a headset connector, for example.<br>
The serial port 108 can be used by the microprocessor<br>
180 to communicate with a host computer, for example. In<br>
particular, in certain embodiments, the device 20 can<br>
provide personal digital assistant (PDA) features, as well<br>
as e-mail/Inter-net capabilities. In this case, any<br>
calendar, contacts, e-mails and similar functions can be<br>
synchronized between the device 20 and a host computer by<br>
the microprocessor 180, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art. Moreover, the serial port 108 can be<br>
used for charging a battery of the device 20, e.g., by<br>
connecting the serial port to an AC/DC converter.<br>
While the serial port 108 provides a relatively easy<br>
and convenient way for users to charge this device 20, a<br>
drawback of this approach is the interference that can be<br>
introduced onto the serial bus from an AC power source.<br>
Also, various audio components of the device 20 (e.g., the<br>
microphone 112, the speaker 110, headset connector, etc.)<br>
can be susceptible to interference from external RF sources,<br>
such as AM/FM or short wave radio and similar transmissions.<br>
This is particularly true in the 80 MHz to the 2 GHz<br>
frequency range, for example.<br>
The susceptibility of the communications device 20 to<br>
interference over a. serial bus during charging and/or from<br>
RF transmissions interfering with the audio components<br>
decreases the overall interference immunity of the device.<br>
28<br>
Some regulating bodies are now requiring wireless<br>
communications devices to comply not only with interference<br>
guidelines (i.e., to not cause excessive interference), but<br>
also have a certain level of immunity to interference from<br>
other RF sources. By way of an example, RnTte immunity<br>
testing is now required for many RF communications devices<br>
in Europe. Unfortunately, the test can be subject to<br>
interference.<br>
FIGS. 8A and 8B show a basic audio circuit 500,<br>
including serial bus connections that can be used for mobile<br>
wireless communications device 20 shown in FIGS. 1-3. This<br>
circuit 500 now has certain types of values of filters<br>
placed around the device to reduce immunity. Basic audio<br>
components are shown in the dashed rectangular box and<br>
include two microphone audio switches 502, which include a<br>
headset detect circuit 504 that is triggered when the<br>
headset jack has an external speaker microphone connected<br>
thereto. It detects the microphone and switches the lines<br>
over. At the receiver speaker 506 are two speaker audio<br>
switches 510, each with a detect circuit 512 that detects<br>
when the earphone is connected and switches the line over,<br>
and inductor component 514 operative with the receiver<br>
speaker 506 and the audio switches 510. A physical jack is<br>
indicated at 520 and receives a jack input and connects to<br>
headset detect line and terminal 521, which also includes a<br>
serially connected inductor 522. The described components<br>
are connected together and operative with the microprocessor<br>
and other components, for example, various inductors,<br>
diodes, capacitors, resistors, and associated circuit<br>
components.<br>
To increase the immunity (i.e., reduce the<br>
susceptibility) of the device 20 to electromagnetic<br>
interference (EMI), a plurality of EMI filters are added to<br>
the audio and/or serial bus circuit 500 of the<br>
communications device 20. As shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, for<br>
example, choke filters (i.e., inductors) can include<br>
respective individual inductors for this purpose. A choke<br>
filter 540 is operatively connected into connection line 542<br>
between the physical jack 520 and the microprocessor 180.<br>
This connection line 542 includes a capacitor circuit 544.<br>
Another choke filter 550 is operatively connected to the<br>
microphone audio switches 502. Yet another choke filter 560<br>
is operatively connected to -he physical jack 520 and the<br>
microprocessor 180 on a connection line 562. Although the<br>
inductor or choke filters as illustrated and positioned in<br>
the respective selected circuit positions, it should be<br>
understood that other filters can be used for the present<br>
invention.<br>
The choke filter 540 also can interconnect to a<br>
resistor divider circuit 541 that includes resistors 541a,<br>
541b for changing the bias on the choke filter 540 as shown<br>
in FIG. 8B. This particular circuit layout using the<br>
resistor divider 541 shown in. FIG. 8B is more sensitive to<br>
differential AC and DC lines. The resistor divider circuit<br>
541 allows a different bias, canceling some noise.<br>
Other basic components included in FIGS. 8A and 8B<br>
include the test points 570 near the receiver speaker. Some<br>
proposed components and circuit designs were removed. For<br>
example, a resistor circuit indicated by the dashed X at 572<br>
near the physical jack 520 and a transistor circuit<br>
indicated by the dashed X at 574 were initially included in<br>
a circuit design and operatively connected to the ground<br>
connection of the physical jack and the microprocessor.<br>
These circuits 572, 574 were removed as indicated by the<br>
dashed-out box.<br>
30<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic circuit diagram for an audio<br>
circuit 580 that includes serial bus connections and having<br>
another circuit footprint, such as for a mobile wireless<br>
communications device 20, and showing similar components in<br>
a different configuration. Any similar components have been<br>
given the same reference numeral. This circuit 580 also<br>
includes an operational amplifier circuit 581 operatively<br>
connected to the microprocessor 180 and operative as a<br>
filter or buffer. FIG. 9 also shows a microphone circuit<br>
582, which would be operative with microphone audio switches<br>
502, even though in this fragmentary schematic circuit<br>
diagram it is shown separate. Choke filter 583 is<br>
operatively connected to the microphone circuit 582. A<br>
choke filter 584 is operatively connected to the physical<br>
jack 520 and the operational amplifier circuit 581. Another<br>
choke filter 585 is operatively connected to a microphone<br>
audio switch 502. Other circuit components can be connected<br>
as illustrated in this non-limiting example.<br>
A previously designed inductor RL filter as indicated<br>
by the dashed lines and crossed out "X" at 590 was found not<br>
to be as operative as the choke filters as described and<br>
removed from the circuit design. The choke filters are<br>
advantageous at the frequency band about 40 MHz, which has a<br>
strong impact on the immunity performance of the radio.<br>
Critical spots are selectively chosen for these ESP filters<br>
designed in these examples of choke filters. A capacitor<br>
circuit 586 is connected between operational amplifier 581<br>
and input jack 520 for determining connection. A transistor<br>
circuit 586a is included in this design and operatively<br>
connected between the operational amplifier circuit 581 and<br>
into connection lines for the filter 584 and input jack 520.<br>
The circuit 580 includes other components that are connected<br>
as illustrated in this non-limiting example.<br>
By way of example, the choke filters as described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 8A, 8B and 9 could be ferrite filters,<br>
for example, although other suitable filter components<br>
and/or materials may also be used, as will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art. In addition to positioning the<br>
EMI filters to reduce unwanted interference, other<br>
components connected to the audio and/or serial bus<br>
circuitry can be scrutinized to determine if interference<br>
susceptibility effects.<br>
The use of the added choke filters advantageously<br>
reduces conducted interfering energy introduced to the audio<br>
components via a serial (i.e., USB) charging cable and other<br>
sources. This further reduces radiated interfering RF<br>
energy introduced to the audio components via the microphone<br>
112 (FIG. 3) or the microphone of a connected headset, for<br>
example.<br>
As noted before, the keypad (keyboard) and its<br>
associated circuitry connected to other components can<br>
create interference. This can be especially true when the<br>
keypad (keyboard) is in close proximity. FIGS. IDA and 10B<br>
show a respective keyboard connector 600 that can be used in<br>
the mobile wireless communications device shown in FIGS. 1-3<br>
and have EMI filtering components connected thereto. This<br>
keyboard connector 600 includes appropriate LED pins and<br>
lines that connect to serial elements as filtering<br>
components 602 and Key-Out and Key-In lines as shown in FIG.<br>
10B. In the illustrated embodiment, the keyboard connector<br>
600 is a female connector and receives a male plug extending<br>
from the separate keypad connector positioned on a separate<br>
keyboard and connects thereto.<br>
FIG. 10B is a schematic circuit diagram of an example<br>
of EMI filtering components 602 that can be connected to the<br>
keyboard connector 600 shown in FIG. 10A and used in the<br>
mobile wireless communications device of FIGS. 1-3 and<br>
operative for filtering when receiving signals.<br>
FIG. 11A is a schematic circuit diagram of a key array<br>
circuit 650 for a keypad, which can be used in a mobile<br>
wireless communications device 20 such as a local area<br>
network (WLAN) communications device. This key array<br>
circuit 650 could be on a separate keyboard. FIG. 11B is a<br>
schematic circuit diagram of an example of the filtering<br>
components 652 that can be connected either to the Key_In or<br>
Key_Out lines and used in a mobile wireless local area<br>
network (WLAN) communications device and operative when<br>
receiving signals. It should be understood that the key<br>
array circuit 650 includes various Key_In and Key_Out and<br>
other lines and terminals as illustrated.<br>
It should be understood that the microprocessor (or<br>
CPU) 180 as shown in FIG. 3 has a keypad (keyboard) 140<br>
coupled to the microprocessor, and the cellular<br>
communication subsystem 101. The cellular communication<br>
subsystem 101 includes a cellular receiver 150 and cellular<br>
transmitter 152, and their respective associated antennas<br>
154 and 156. Of course, it should be noted that a single<br>
antenna can be used in certain embodiments.<br>
The keypad 140 may be a numeric keypad for use in<br>
placing cellular telephone calls, as will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art. Moreover, in certain embodiments<br>
in which the device 20 advantageously provides personal<br>
digital assistant (PDA) and/or email/Internet functionality,<br>
the keypad 140 may include alphanumeric keys and other<br>
function keys, as will also be appreciated by those skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
The microprocessor 180 may operate at clock speed of<br>
tens or even hundreds of megahertz (or higher) in a typical<br>
cellular device performing PDA operations, for example. Yet,<br>
such relatively high clock speeds can introduce digital<br>
harmonics in the lines connecting the microprocessor 180<br>
with the keypad 140. This may result in RF interference<br>
energy, which reduces the sensitivity of the receiver 150.<br>
That is, the sensitivity of the RF receiver 150 may be<br>
significantly degraded by the digital noise generated by the<br>
microprocessor 180 on the Key-Out and Key-In lines, which is<br>
radiated from the keyboard traces and picked up by the<br>
antenna 154.<br>
In 'accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, and another embodiment<br>
shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B, electromagnetic interference<br>
(EMI) filters 602, 652 are advantageously coupled to the<br>
Key_In and Key_Out lines to reduce the RF interference<br>
picked up by the antenna 154. An exemplary EMI filter array<br>
602 is illustrated in FIG. 10B. The EMI filter array 602<br>
illustratively includes series elements formed as resistors<br>
R1001 through R1006 respectively coupled to Key_Out lines<br>
KEY_OUT_0 through KEY_OUT_5, and resistors RIO07 through<br>
R1011 respectively coupled to key in lines KEY_IN_0 through<br>
KEY_IN_4. The values of the resistors R1001-R1011 are<br>
selected based upon the parasitic capacitance and/or<br>
inductance of the Key_0ut and Key_In lines to provide an RC,<br>
RL, or RLC filter with desired filtering characteristics.<br>
Yet, these values should also be selected so as not to cause<br>
undue signal degradation over the Key_0ut and Key_In lines.<br>
By way of example, IK Ohm resistors were used in the<br>
illustrated example, although other values may be used in<br>
other embodiments. These series elements formed as<br>
resistors and connected between the microprocessor or ether<br>
CPU circuit and keyboard connector has been found<br>
advantageous when high Q values are involved. The resistors<br>
could be surface mount resistors on the circuit board 67.<br>
The resistors can be connected in-line with the printed<br>
conductive traces used for Key_Out and Key_In lines. Other<br>
configurations are possible, of course.<br>
Moreover, other types of EMI filtering components may<br>
be used in addition to, or instead of, those noted above.<br>
For example, resistors, inductors, shunt capacitors, EMI<br>
ferrite beads, or a combination thereof may be used in<br>
different embodiments, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of a portion of a circuit for a<br>
wireless local area network (WLAN) device with a similar EMI<br>
filter array is illustrated in FIGS. 11A and 11B. The<br>
filter array 652 connects to the key array circuit 650 via<br>
the Key_0ut and Key_In lines (FIG. 11A) . The EMI filter<br>
array 652 illustratively includes series elements formed as<br>
resistors R1001-R1006 and R1020 respectively connected to<br>
Key_Out lines KEY_OUT_0 through KEY_OUT_6, and resistors<br>
R1007-R1011 respectively connected to Key_In lines KEY_IN_0<br>
through KEY_IN_4. Here again, other series elements or<br>
other filtering arrangements may be used as well.<br>
As noted before with reference to FIG. 3, the keypad<br>
140 may be a numeric keypad array for use in placing<br>
cellular telephone calls, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG.<br>
3, the device 20 advantageously provides personal digital<br>
assistant (PDA) and/or email/Internet functionality. As<br>
such, the keypad 140 illustratively includes alphanumeric<br>
keys and other function keys, to allow text typing as well<br>
as number entry for placing phone calls.<br>
During transmission, radio frequency (RF) energy from<br>
the transmitter 152 and its associated antenna 156 can<br>
interfere with or couple to the input/output (I/O) lines of<br>
the microprocessor 180 through the KEY_IN and KEY_OUT lines<br>
connecting the microprocessor and the keypad 140. This<br>
interference may cause a variety of problems, potentially as<br>
severe as resetting the microprocessor. This is especially<br>
problematic with the higher power GSM cellular phones and<br>
assorted communications devices that operate with about two<br>
(2) watts and higher output power. This, in turn, could<br>
cause a user to lose a message or other document in<br>
progress, or to be cut off during a phone call, for example.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention shown in FIG. 12, a keypad connector 700 is<br>
positioned on a separate keyboard and is operatively<br>
connected to a keypad array circuit 720 shown in schematic<br>
circuit diagram. This keypad connector operates as a<br>
keyboard connector that connects to the keyboard connector<br>
on the circuit board. Various light emitting diodes (LED's)<br>
730 are connected to the keypad connector. Test points 732<br>
are illustrated as operatively connected to the keypad array<br>
circuit. The keypad connector 700 can be similar in design<br>
as the keyboard connector 600 except with a reverse<br>
configuration to allow the connectors to clip or connect<br>
together. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, a plurality<br>
of series connected elements, e.g., resistors R1-R8, are<br>
advantageously coupled to the KEY_IN and KEY_OUT lines on<br>
the separate keyboard to dampen RF energy picked up by these<br>
lines, either from the antenna 156 or from external<br>
interference. The values of the resistors R1-R8 are<br>
carefully chosen based upon the parasitic capacitance and/or<br>
inductance of the Key-Out and Key-In lines to provide an RC,<br>
RL, or RLC filter with desired filtering characteristics.<br>
However, it is important that these values not be so large<br>
that they effect the normal operation of the microprocessor<br>
180 and/or the keyboard 140.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 12, the resistors<br>
R1-R8 are all 500 Ohm resistors, although other resistor<br>
values may be used in different embodiments. The series<br>
elements, e.g., resistors R1-R8, are preferably positioned<br>
on the keyboard itself adjacent the keys. For example, the<br>
resistors R1-R8 may be surface mount resistors on a keyboard<br>
printed circuit board (PCB) or other board, such as a main<br>
board 67, and the resistors may be connected in line with<br>
the printed conductive traces used for the Key_Out and<br>
Key_In lines. Of course, other configurations known to<br>
those skilled in the art are also possible.<br>
In addition, other types of EMI filtering components<br>
may be used in addition to, or instead of, those ncred<br>
above. For example, resistors, inductors, shunt capacitors,<br>
EMI ferrite heads, or a combination thereof may be used in<br>
different err_Dodiments, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art. It should also be noted that the abovedescribed<br>
SMI filtering components may be used in devices<br>
other than cellular devices, such as mobile handheld<br>
wireless local area network (WLAN) devices, for example, as<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Operative<br>
with the keyboard connection are Light Emitting Diodes<br>
(LED's), which emit light therefrom.<br>
