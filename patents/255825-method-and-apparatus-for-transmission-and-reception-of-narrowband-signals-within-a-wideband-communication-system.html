Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to communication systems, and in<br>
particular, to a method and apparatus for transmission and reception of<br>
narrowband signals within a wideband communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Future communication systems are generally wideband in nature. Such<br>
communication systems will transmit and receive utilizing large bandwidths (e.g.,<br>
20 - 100' MHz). One of the key advantages of having large bandwidth systems is<br>
the possibility to transmit at high data rates. However, there are many challenges<br>
in building broadband remote, or mobile units, clue to issues such as power<br>
consumption, signal processing complexity, size limitations, etc. Many of these<br>
issues are more easily addressed in a base station. Furthermore, different regions<br>
or markets may have different amounts of spectrum available for deploying next-<br>
generation systems. For example, an operator may lave 100 MHz in one market<br>
(used to deploy a 100 MHz system), and only 20 MHz in another market, and may<br>
want to support both a 100 MHz remote unit and a 20 MHz remote unit<br>
simultaneously in the 100 MHz system. Additionally, an operator may want to<br>
enable both narrowband and wideband remote units to operate within a wideband<br>
system so that both low-cost (narrowband) and high capability (wideband) remote<br>
units can be offered to customers with the same infrastructure. Because of these<br>
issues, a need exists for a method and apparatus for transmission and reception of<br>
narrowband signals within a wideband communication system so that both<br>
narrowband and wideband units can share the same wideband spectrum.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
To address the above-mentioned need a method and apparatus for<br>
transmission and reception of narrowband signals within a wideband<br>
communication system is provided herein. Narrowband remote units will scan<br>
over frequencies within a wideband channel spectrum, evaluating frequency-<br><br>
selective channel characteristics. The best sub-channel(s) for communication will<br>
be determined and reported back to a base station via a channel-quality report<br>
message. The base station will then utilize only a narrowband portion (e.g., one<br>
sub-channel comprised of a plurality of OFDM subcarriers) of the wideband<br>
channel for transmitting data to the narrowband unit.<br>
The present invention encompasses a method for a narrowband mobile unit<br>
to receive data in a wideband communication system. The method comprises the<br>
steps of evaluating frequency-selective channel characteristics for the wideband<br>
channel and sending a channel-quality report to a base station, wherein the<br>
channel-quality report is based on the frequency-selective channel characteristics<br>
for the wideband channel. A channel assignment is received from the base station<br>
and data is received over a portion of the wideband channel based on the<br>
frequency-selective channel characteristics, wherein a data rate for the data is<br>
based predominantly on the frequency-selective channel characteristics for the<br>
wideband channel. <br>
The present invention additionally encompasses a method comprising the<br>
steps of receiving a channel-quality report from a narrowband remote unit,<br>
determining a portion of a wideband channel to utilize for narrowband<br>
transmissions based on the channel-quality report, determining a modulation and<br>
coding for the narrowband transmissions based on the channel-quality report, and<br>
transmitting a channel assignment to the narrowband remote unit assigning the<br>
narrowband remote unit the portion of the wideband channel. Data is transmitted<br>
to the narrowband remote unit over a narrowband channel comprising the portion<br>
of the wideband channel.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising<br>
channel scanning circuitry for scanning a wideband channel, logic circuitry for<br>
evaluating frequency-selective channel characteristics for the wideband channel, a<br>
transmitter for sending a channel-quality report to a base station, and a receiver<br>
receiving a channel assignment from the base station and receiving data over a<br>
portion of the wideband channel based on the channel-quality report, wherein the<br>
data rate for the data is based predominantly on the frequency-selective channel<br>
characteristics for the wideband channel.<br>
The present invention additionally encompasses an apparatus comprising<br>
receiving circuitry receiving a channel-quality report from a narrowband remote<br>
unit, logic circuitry for determining a portion of a wideband channel to utilize for<br><br>
narrowband transmissions based on the channel-quality report, the logic circuitry<br>
additionally determining a modulation and coding for the narrowband<br>
transmissions based on the channel-quality report, modulation and coding<br>
circuitry for modulating and coding the data to be transmitted to the narrowband<br>
remote unit, and-transmitting circuitry for transmitting data to the narrowband<br>
remote unit over the portion of the wideband channel, the data having a<br>
modulation and coding based on the channel-quality report.<br>
Turning now to the drawings, wherein like numerals designate like<br>
components, FIG. 1 is. a block diagram of communication system 100.<br>
Communication system 100 comprises a plurality of cells 105 (only one shown)<br>
each having a base transceiver station (BTS, or base station) 104 in<br>
communication with a plurality of remote, or mobile units 101-103. In the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, communication system 100<br>
utilizes a next generation Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) or<br>
multicarrier based architecture including Adaptive Modulation and Coding<br>
 (AMC). The architecture may also include the use of spreading techniques such as<br>
multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-<br>
 DS-CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency and Code Division Multiplexing (OFCDM)<br>
with one or two dimensional spreading, or may be based on simpler time and/or<br>
frequency division multiplexing/multiple access techniques, or a combination of<br>
 these various techniques. However, in alternate embodiments communication<br>
system 100 may utilize other wideband cellular communication system protocols<br>
such as, but not limited to, TDMA or direct sequence CDMA.<br>
As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, during operation of an<br>
OFDM system, multiple subcarriers (e.g., 768 subcarriers) are utilized to transmit<br>
wideband data. This is illustrated in FIG. 2. As shown in FIG. 2 the wideband<br>
channel is divided into many narrow frequency bands (subcarriers) 201, with data<br>
being transmitted in parallel on subcarriers 201. In addition to OFDM,<br>
communication system 100 utilizes Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC).<br>
With AMC, the modulation and coding format of a transmitted data stream for a<br>
particular receiver is changed to predominantly match a current received signal<br>
quality (at the receiver) for the particular frame being transmitted. The modulation<br>
and coding scheme may change on a frame-by-frame basis in order to track the<br>
channel quality variations that occur in mobile communication systems. Thus,<br>
streams with high quality are typically assigned higher order modulations rates<br><br>
and/or higher channel coding rates with the modulation order and/or the code rate<br>
decreasing as quality decreases. For those receivers experiencing high quality,<br>
modulation schemes such as 16 QAM, 64 QAM or 256 QAM are utilized, while<br>
for those experiencing low quality, modulation schemes such as BPSK or QPSK<br>
are utilized. The selected modulation and coding may only predominantly match<br>
the current received signal quality for reasons such as channel quality<br>
measurement delay or errors, channel quality reporting delay or errors, efforts to <br>
measure or predict current and future interference, and efforts to measure or<br>
predict the future channel.<br>
Multiple coding rates may be available for each modulation scheme to<br>
provide finer AMC granularity, to enable a closer match between the quality and <br>
the transmitted signal characteristics (e.g.,:R=1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 for QPSK; R=1/2<br>
and R=2/3 for 16 QAM, etc.). Note that AMC can be performed in the time<br>
dimension (e.g., updating the modulation/coding every Nt OFDM symbol periods)<br>
or in the frequency dimension (e.g., updating the modulation/coding every Nsc<br>
 subcarriers) or a combination of both.<br>
Consider a system that uses asymmetric frequency division duplexing<br>
(FDD), as illustrated in FIG. 3. In asymmetric FDD, the downlink and uplink<br>
bandwidths are different in order to match the expected downlink and uplink<br>
traffic characteristics, and typically have a frequency gap existing between them.<br>
For an OFDM system, the downlink frame comprises all of the available<br>
subcarriers 201 which form the wideband channel. As discussed above, there exist<br>
situations where certain remote units are incapable of utilizing the total available<br>
spectrum of the wideband channel. For example, remote unit 101 may be able to<br>
simultaneously receive all available subcarriers 201, but remote unit 102 may be-<br>
able to receive only a portion of the wideband channel spectrum (e.g., a sub-<br>
channel comprising, for example 16 adjacent OFDM subcarriers 201) at any given<br>
time. These different remote unit bandwidth capabilities are illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
As is evident in FIG. 4, the downlink capability for remote unit 101 far<br>
exceeds that of remote unit 102. As discussed, an operator may want to enable<br>
both narrowband and wideband remote units to operate within a wideband system<br>
so that both low-cost (narrowband) and high capability (wideband) remote units<br>
can be offered to customers with the same infrastructure. In order to address this<br>
issue, narrowband remote units will scan over frequencies within the wideband<br>
channel spectrum, evaluating frequency-selective channel characteristics. The best<br><br>
sub-channel(s) for communication will be determined and reported back to base<br>
station 104 via a channel-quality report message. Base station 104 will then utilize<br>
only a narrowband portion (e.g., one sub-channel comprised of a plurality of<br>
OFDM subcarriers) of the wideband channel for transmitting data to the<br>
narrowband unit.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention the narrowband remote unit<br>
will send to base station 104 a list of preferred sub-channels based on the channel<br>
characteristics of the scanned sub-channels. Depending on the particular system<br>
implementation and overhead constraints, the length of the list may vary. For<br>
example, the list may contain only the single best sub-channel index, or a quality-<br>
ordered list of the best N sub-channels. Alternatively, the narrowband unit may<br>
send back a list of the sub-channels that should be avoided, due to poor quality.<br>
Base station 104 then chooses an'appropriate sub-channel for transmitting data to<br>
the narrowband remote unit. In this case, the data rate could be a function (such as<br>
twice) of the data rate the poor channel could support. If a preferred channel and a<br>
channel to avoid are sent back, and a channel other than the preferred channel is<br>
used for data transmission, the data rate could be a function (e.g., 75% of the data<br>
rate supported by the preferred channel). However, in an alternate embodiment of <br>
the present invention, base station 104 is simply provided with the channel<br>
characteristics evaluated by the narrowband remote unit. Base station 104 will<br>
then determine the best sub-channel to utilize for narrowband transmission.<br>
Regardless of which technique is utilized to determine the sub-channel for<br>
narrowband transmission, base station 104 will provide the narrowband remote<br>
unit a message indicating the sub-channel to be utilized, and narrowband data<br>
transmission takes place utilizing that sub-channel. The message is typically .<br>
contained in an explicit control/signaling/assignment (C/S/A) message field, but<br>
all or part of the message may be implicitly communicated in conjunction with the<br>
narrowband transmission. For example, the message could comprise a remote unit<br>
specific cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code that protects a data transmission.<br>
As discussed above, when determining the sub-channel for narrowband<br>
communication, the spectrum within the wideband channel is scanned to<br>
determine quality information for particular sub-channels within the wideband<br>
channel. FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of a scanning procedure. As shown in<br>
FIG. 5, on each sub-channel bandwidth, pilot signals are provided at various times<br>
in order to perform the channel measurement operations. The pilot signals are<br><br>
offset in time so that a narrowband remote unit can sequentially scan all the sub-<br>
channel pilots. Thus, the scanning procedure comprises receiving a plurality of<br>
pilot channels on various sub-channels, and analyzing the quality of the pilot<br>
channels. Thus, at a first time period, a remote unit will scan and receive a first<br>
pilot channel on a first subcarrier, while at a second time period, the remote unit<br>
will scan and receive a second pilot channel on a second subcarrier. This<br>
procedure continues until all pilot channels on all subcarriers are received and<br>
scanned for quality information. Note that the scanning can be performed over the,<br>
entire wideband channel as describe above, or only a portion of the wideband<br>
channel, in order to reduce the scanning burden on the remote unit.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the pilot signals for scanning<br>
are embedded within data transmitted to the remote; units. The data transmission<br>
scheme is illustrated in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7. Although not shown, the pilots for<br>
scanning may be included within, the data for remote unit 102 or the data for<br>
remote unit 101 or in the multiplexed data for both remote units 101 and 102. The<br>
pilots for scanning may also be pilots normally used for data reception which are<br>
 used for scanning when the unit is not actively receiving data. The pilots can<br>
either occupy the whole frequency range or be specific for a given sub-channel.<br>
They can be signals solely used for the purpose of selecting a sub-channel or can<br>
serve other purpose as well, such as, e.g., assisting in the wideband channel<br>
estimation process. Based on the pilot signal, the narrowband remote units.<br>
determine channel quality information in a sub-channel. In a first embodiment of<br>
the present invention the channel quality information comprises a measurement of<br>
the frequency response of the channel on a sub-channel. More particularly, the<br>
quality information can be the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) averaged<br>
over the sub-channel, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the pilot<br>
averaged over the sub-channel, the received earner over noise (C/N) ratio<br>
averaged over the sub-channel, the received carrier over interference (C/I)<br>
averaged over the sub-channel or the received carrier over noise plus interference<br>
(C/(I+N)) averaged over the sub-channel. In this case, the quality metrics consist<br>
of at least a single value for the sub-channel. The measurement/estimation may be<br>
performed for some and preferably all sub-channels. In this case, the channel<br>
metrics consists of a set of several values. The scanning may be one additional<br>
sub-channel per frame other than the sub-channel the remote unit is actively<br>
receiving data on.<br><br>
FIG. 8 illustrates how the quality of the signal can change based on<br>
frequency. More particularly, FIG. 8 shows how quality 801 of a signal may vary<br>
over frequency, or the channel bandwidth. As is evident, quality 801 is relatively<br>
high for the First four subcarriers, and relatively low for 7th through 9th subcarriers.<br>
With this type of information available to a narrowband remote unit based on<br>
scanning within the wideband channel, the remote unit can either determine the<br>
best sub-channel for narrowband transmission, or may simply provide sub-channel<br>
quality information for one or more sub-channels to base station 104, letting base<br>
station 104 determine the best sub-channel for narrowband transmission.<br>
If quality information can be measured and reported on a frame-by-frame<br>
basis, then AMC can be performed on a frame-by-frame basis as well, with the<br>
particular modulation/coding utilized being based on the channel quality of the<br>
particular sub-channel. More particularly, base station 104 will determine the<br>
modulation/coding scheme utilized for a particular sub-channel based on its<br>
particular channel quality. In general, the channel quality information is. valid only<br>
 for a time on the order of the channel coherence time so that the determination of<br>
the modulation/coding scheme needs to be performed with a fine time granularity.<br>
The coherence time of the channel is related to the remote unit speed; channel<br>
quality information gets more outdated the faster the: remote unit is moving, or the<br>
faster the environment surrounding the remote unit changes. This time granularity<br>
is typically every frame or once every few (two or three) frames if a single time<br>
granularity is selected for all remote units based on a largest speed of a reasonable<br>
range of speed. The time granularity may be longer for a remote unit that is<br>
moving slower than other remote units. If quality information is available for<br>
multiple subcarriers within the sub-channel, then AMC can optionally be applied<br>
in the frequency dimension as well (e.g., over the subcarriers within the sub-<br>
channel).<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram of narrowband remote unit 900. As shown, unit<br>
900 comprises channel transceiver 901, logic circuitry 902, and channel scanning<br>
circuitry 903. transceiver 901 serves as both a transmitter for sending a channel-<br>
quality report to a base station, where the channel-quality report is based on the<br>
frequency-selective channel characteristics for the wideband channel, and a<br>
receiver receiving a channel assignment from the base station and receiving data<br>
over a portion of the wideband channel based on the channel-quality report.<br>
Channel scanning circuitry 903 serves as means for scanning within a wideband<br><br>
channel bandwidth to determine the best sub-channel for narrowband<br>
transmission/reception. More particularly, during operation, logic circuitry 902<br>
directs channel scanning circuitry 903 to periodically scan within the wideband<br>
channel spectrum to determine a channel quality metric for various frequency<br>
bands or sub-channels within the wideband channel frequency range. The channel<br>
quality is reported back to logic circuitry 902. Circuitry 902 serves as means for<br>
preparing a channel-quality report. As discussed above, this report may simply<br>
comprise a list of preferred sub-channels based on the frequency-selective channel<br>
characteristics, or in the alternative may comprise a list of sub-channels along<br>
with their perceived quality, or quality information, or a list of subcarriers along<br>
with their perceived quality. This list is passed to transceiver 901 where it is<br>
transmitted to base station 104. In response, transceiver 901 receives a message<br>
from base station 104, indicating the sub-channel utilized for narrowband<br>
communication with remote unit 900. Data is then transmitted to remote unit 900<br>
utilizing a subset consisting of a group of. subcarriers of the spectrum in the<br>
wideband channel (e.g., a sub-channel). The data is received and output by<br>
transceiver 901. Note that this scanning process should be performed with a fine<br>
time granularity (e.g., every frame or every other frame, or related to the<br>
coherence time of the remote unit).<br>
FIG. 10 is a flow chart showing the operation of narrowband remote unit<br>
900. The logic flow begins at step 1001 where channel scanning circuitry 903<br>
scans within the wideband channel frequency range and determines a channel<br>
quality for various frequency ranges (e.g., sub-channels) within the wideband<br>
frequency range. As discussed above, this scanning procedure preferably takes<br>
place on a frame-by-frame basis. In other words, the wideband channel is<br>
preferably scanned during each frame. At step 1003, this information is provided<br>
to logic circuitry 902, and is utilized to prepare a channel-quality report message<br>
(step 1005), which is transmitted to base station 104 (step 1007). At step 1009, a<br>
channel-assignment message is received from base station 104 indicating the sub-<br>
channel to be utilized for data transmission, and at step 1011, data is received over<br>
the sub-channel. As discussed above, the sub-channel comprises a narrowband<br>
channel that occupies a portion of the wideband channel. As shown in FIG. 6 and<br>
FIG. 7, the channel-assignment message can be received over the same portion of<br>
the wideband channel utilized for narrowband transmissions. Alternatively, the<br>
channel-assignment message can be received over a different portion of the<br><br>
wideband channel. Finally, it should be noted that the modulation and coding rate<br>
(and hence the data rate) is based on the channel-quality report, and in the<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention changes on a frame-by-frame<br>
basis.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram of base station 104. As shown, base station 104<br>
comprises transceiver 1101, logic circuitry 1102, and AMC circuitry 1103. During<br>
operation transceiver 1101 (acting as a receiver) receives a channel-quality report<br>
from a narrowband remote unit and passes the report to logic circuitry 1102. Logic<br>
circuitry 1102 serves as means for determining a sub-channel to utilize from those <br>
available to the wideband system. As discussed above, this may be accomplished<br>
by simply choosing a sub-channel already provided within the channel-quality<br>
report, or alternatively, this may be accomplished by analyzing the channel-<br>
quality report to determine a sub-channel having a best quality. Finally, AMC<br>
circuitry 1103 serves as means for modulating data transmitted to the narrowband<br>
remote unit. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention this sub-channel<br>
assignment process is performed with a fine time granularity (e.g., every frame or<br>
every other frame), however, in alternate embodiments of the present invention<br>
the sub-channel assignment process can be performed over varying time periods.<br>
Transceiver 1101, acting as a transmitter, transmits data to the narrowband remote<br>
unit over a portion of the wideband channel, the data having a modulation and<br>
coding based on the channel-quality report.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flow chart showing operation of base station 104. The logic<br>
flow begins at step 1201 where a channel-quality report is received by transceiver<br>
1101 and passed to logic circuitry 1102. At step 1203 logic circuitry 1102<br>
determines a sub-channel to utilize for narrowband transmission, along with a<br>
modulation/coding scheme for the sub-channel. The base station 104 may decide<br>
to not transmit to the remote unit, or to transmit to the remote unit in a future<br>
frame. At step 1205, logic circuitry 1102 prepares a channel-assignment message<br>
to transmit to remote unit 900, and at step 1207 the message is transmitted to<br>
remote unit 900. At step 1209, logic circuitry 1102 instructs AMC circuitry to<br>
utilize a particular data rate (i.e., modulation/coding scheme) for the sub-channel<br>
utilized for narrowband transmission, and at step 1211 the data is properly coded<br>
and transmitted over the narrowband sub-channel. As discussed above, a subset of<br>
the frequency band is utilized, and is modulated/coded based on the perceived<br>
quality of the channel reported to base station 104 as part of the channel-quality<br><br>
report. Because the modulation/coding is directly related to the data transmission<br>
rate, the particular data rate is predominantly based on the frequency-selective<br>
channel characteristics reported by the remote unit in its channel-quality report.<br>
The above-described procedure for transmitting to both wideband and<br>
narrowband units also allows the ability to transmit to both a narrowband remote<br>
unit and a wideband remote unit within the same time interval, within the same<br>
downlink frame. This is illustrated with reference to FIG. 6 which shows<br>
transmissions to wideband remote unit 101 and inarrowband remote unit 102<br>
within the same frame. In this example, the data transmission to remote unit 102 is<br>
on a particular sub-channel. (frequency range) within the wideband channel, and<br>
data transmission to remote unit 101 occurs in the remainder of the wideband<br>
channel. Also, the data transmission to remote unit 102 ends before the end of the<br>
frame, allowing time for remote unit 102 to perform scanning. Additionally, the<br>
assignment message for remote unit 102 is contained in a<br>
control/signaling/assignment message (C/S/A) field for remote unit 102, which in<br>
this example is transmitted on the same sub-channel as the data for remote unit<br>
102.<br>
FIG. 7 also shows transmissions to wideband remote unit 101 and<br>
narrowband remote unit 102 within the same frame. In this example, the data<br>
transmission to remote unit .102 is on a particular sub-channel within the wideband<br>
channel, and data transmission to remote unit 101 occurs over the entire wideband<br>
channel, including the sub-channel used for data transmission to remote unit 102.<br>
In this case, the sub-channel for remote unit 102 is shared with the transmissions<br>
to remote unit 101 by a predetermined multiplexing scheme. Data transmissions to<br>
two or more narrowband remote units (not shown) may also occur on the same<br>
sub-channel by sharing the sub-channel according to a predetermined<br>
multiplexing scheme. Although not shown in FIG. 7, the C/S/A field for remote<br>
unit 102 could also be shared with the C/S/A field for remote unit 101 (or other<br>
remote units in the system) by a predetermined multiplexing scheme.<br>
FIG. 13 and FIG. 14 show multiplexing schemes for an example sub-<br>
channel structure shown in FIG. 15. In FIG. 15, each row represents a single<br>
subcarrier of an OFDM signal, each column represents an OFDM symbol period,<br>
and the sub-channel comprises a block of eight adjacent subcarriers within the<br>
wideband channel. As illustrated, a sub-channel may include both data symbols<br>
and pilot symbols to support channel estimation and coherent detection. FIG. 13<br><br>
illustrates time multiplexing, frequency multiplexing, and time-frequency<br>
multiplexing data for remote unit 101, remote unit 102, and remote unit 103<br>
within a single sub-channel. <br>
FIG. 14 illustrates code multiplexing within a sub-channel for a system<br>
based on OFDM with spreading and code multiplexing (OFCDM). In this<br>
example, the spreading factor in the frequency (subcarrier) dimension is SF_freq,<br>
and the spreading factor in the time dimension (OFDM symbol periods) is<br>
SF_time, where SF_freq is preferably less than or equal to the number of<br>
subcarriers in the sub-channel. Code 1 is used as a pilot and the remaining codes<br>
may be divided among one or more remote units.<br>
When the system has multiple active narrowband remote units, there is a<br>
possibility that two or more narrowband remote units will request the same sub-<br>
channel. This is referred to as sub-channel contention. In the sub-channel<br>
contention resolution, the base station (BS) arbitrates which remote unit/remote<br>
units will be assigned a particular sub-channel. The arbitration method may be<br>
based on various factors such as the channel-quality reports, or quality of service,<br>
constraints, or fairness criteria. FIG. 16 shows various flow charts illustrating sub-<br>
channel contention resolution for the downlink (DL).<br>
In each example, multiple remote unit's directly (e.g., based on a preferred<br>
sub-channel index from the remote units) or indirectly (e.g., based on analysis by<br>
the base station of frequency-selective channel characteristics of the remote units)<br>
identify the same preferred sub-channel number j1 for the same frame number k1.<br>
In a first embodiment, the base station multiplexes data transmissions to a<br>
plurality of remote unit's within the same sub-channel #j1 in the same frame. In a<br>
second embodiment, the BS performs data transmission to one remote unit on sub-<br>
channel #j1, and to a second remote unit on sub-channel #j2 in the same frame. In<br>
a third embodiment, the BS performs data transmission to one remote unit on sub-<br>
channel #j 1 in frame #k1, and to a second remote unit on sub-channel #j 1 in frame<br>
#k2. Thus, in the third embodiment, transmissions to the narrowband remote units<br>
take place on differing frames of the narrowband channel.<br>
As indicated earlier, a sub-channel assignment message for a remote unit<br>
may be transmitted in a C/S/A field. In a first embodiment, the C/S/A field for a<br>
remote unit is transmitted on a fixed or well known sub-channel. This enables a<br>
narrowband remote unit to know which sub-channel to tune its receiver to within<br>
the wideband channel to detect its C/S/A. The C/S/A may then direct the remote<br><br>
unit to a different sub-channel for its data assignment. As an enhancement to this<br>
method, the C/S/A information for a remote unit may be transmitted on multiple<br>
well-known sub-channels so that a remote unit can tune to the C/S/A sub-channel<br>
that has the highest quality (e.g., based on scanning in a previous frame). In an<br>
alternate embodiment, a C/S/A for a future frame may be embedded in the data<br>
transmission to a remote unit in the current frame. In another alternate<br>
embodiment, the C/S/A may be divided into two segments, as shown in FIG. 17.<br>
The first segment, referred to as a basic C/S/A, is transmitted on a well known<br>
sub-channel (or optionally repeated on multiple well-known sub-channels as<br>
described above and as shown in FIG. 17). The first segment may contain basic<br>
broadcast information, a number of assignment messages for remote units, and<br>
pointers to the locations of second segment C/S/As for some remote units. The<br>
second segment C/S/A for a remote unit, referred to as a supplemental C/S/A,<br>
contains a specific assignment message for the remote unit. In another alternate<br>
embodiment, the C/S/A for a particular remote unit is transmitted on the same<br>
sub-channel as the sub-channel assignment contained within the assignment<br>
message. This enables a remote unit to tune to its preferred sub-channel and it will<br>
then be able to receive the C/S/A and data on the same sub-channel. If the base<br>
station chooses not to assign the preferred sub-channel, then the remote unit will<br>
not detect an assignment in the current frame.<br>
FIG. 18 shows that a plurality of sub-channel bandwidths can be used in a<br>
system in order to support different types of narrowband remote units with<br>
different bandwidth capabilities. For instance, a system with a total bandwidth of<br>
20 MHz could simultaneously serve wideband 20 MHz remote units, a first type<br>
of narrowband units having a bandwidth of 10 MHz, a second type of narrowband<br>
units having a bandwidth of 5 MHz, and a third type of narrowband units having a<br>
bandwidth of 1.25 MHz.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to a particular embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the above<br>
description was given with respect to an OFDM communication system having<br>
many subcarriers; however, one of ordinary sill in the art will recognize that the<br>
present invention may be applicable to wideband systems having no subcarriers.<br>
In this case, the continuous wideband frequency range is utilized for wideband<br><br>
transmission, while only a portion of the frequency band is utilized for<br>
narrowband transmissions. The best frequency range for communication will be<br>
chosen by the narrowband unit, and reported back to the base station via a<br>
channel-quality report message. Narrowband communication will then take place<br>
over the reported best frequency range. Additionally, while the above-description<br>
was given with respect to downlink transmission, it will be understood by those<br>
skilled in the art that the above description is applicable to uplink transmissions as<br>
well. It is intended that such changes come within the scope of the following<br>
