The invention relates to a system for joining non-transparent parts by means of<br>
an electromagnetic radiation curable adhesive as it reads from the preamble of<br>
claim 1, it also relating to a method for joining non-transparent parts by means<br>
of a radiation curable adhesive as it reads from the preamble of claim 16.<br>
When parts are to be joined by means of a face coating of an electromagnetic<br>
radiation curable adhesive, at least one of the two parts needs to be transparent<br>
for the radiation initiating curing so that the adhesive can be activated and cured<br>
by the radiation.<br>
Known from DE 10 2005 002 076 A1 is a method for producing a metal-framed<br>
glass pane component in which a pane of glass is cemented to a frame element<br>
by means of a UV curable adhesive. Disposed between the glass pane and the<br>
frame element is a bevelled gap which is filled with the adhesive utilizing the<br>
capillary effect. Once the gap is filled the adhesive is cured by means of UV<br>
irradiation.<br>
The invention has the object of proposing a system and method for joining non-<br>
transparent parts by means of an electromagnetic radiation curable adhesive<br>
achieving fast curing of the adhesive by irradiation even when the adhesive is<br>
face coated between the non-transparent parts.<br>
For this purpose a system and a method in accordance with the invention are<br>
made available as it reads from claim 1 and claim 16 respectively.<br>
The gist of the invention is that an at least partly transparent element is inserted<br>
between the non-transparent parts to be joined together, by means of which the<br>
radiation initiating curing of the adhesive can now be introduced into a layer of<br>
the adhesive face coated between the non-transparent parts so that fast curing<br>
is now possible when needed. The at least partly transparent element in this<br>
arrangement may be configured both as a joining part by it being inserted as a<br><br>
-2-<br>
kind of connector between the parts to be joined together and cemented on<br>
both sides with each part. In this case such an element must be able to receive<br>
the forces to be communicated to the other part. As an alternative, the at least<br>
partly transparent element may be configured simply as a kind of radiation<br>
distributor which directs the radiation initiating curing of the adhesive to the<br>
wanted locations. This system is particularly suitably for fast and durable joining<br>
non-transparent parts by means of the cited adhesive once they have been<br>
accurately positioned.<br>
An example embodiment of the invention will now be detained with reference to<br>
the attached drawings in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is an exploded view of the components forming the system for joining two<br>
non-transparent parts;<br>
FIG. 2 is a magnified view of some of the components of the system, and<br>
FIG. 3 is a longitudinal section through two components of the system.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1 there are illustrated some of the components of the<br>
system for joining two non-transparent parts together. In the present example<br>
the parts to be joined together consist of a pallet 1 and a ram 2 made of metal<br>
and thus non-transparent to visible or UV light. A salient component of the<br>
system is a transparent element 3 in the form of a round disk. This element 3<br>
comprises two planoparallel surfaces and is inserted as a joining element<br>
between the two parts to be joined together. Further components of the system<br>
are a centering element 4 for centering the ram 2 relative to the pallet 1, as well<br>
as an irradiation source 7 which emits light in a wavelength range adapted to an<br>
adhesive for photoinitiated curing, for example UV light. The irradiation source 7<br>
depicted in this case simply diagrammatically by two LEDs serves to initiate<br>
curing of a coated film of adhesive to cement the parts at the locations intended.<br>
The irradiation source 7 is preferably configured such that the emitted<br>
electromagnetic radiation is beamed distributed to several locations in the<br>
element 3. For example, the irradiation source 7 may comprise a plurality of<br><br>
-3-<br>
LEDs preferably arranged in a circle so that the radiation is beamed into the<br>
element 3 optimally evenly. The adhesive used is preferably a photoinitiated<br>
curing acrylate cement which attains its final strength in just a few seconds by<br>
irradiation with UV or visible light.<br>
Also evident is an upper and a lower chuck 5, 6. The upper chuck 5 serves to<br>
locate accurately positioned the centering element 4 configured as an anvil<br>
whilst the lower chuck 6 serves to locate accurately positioned the pallet 1.<br>
Preferably both chucks 5, 6 are secured to a frame or, for example, in a press<br>
so that at least the one chuck 5 is axially movable relative to the other chuck 6.<br>
In the present example it is the upper chuck 5 that is arranged axially movable<br>
relative to the lower chuck 6, the means for this purpose not being shown. All<br>
that is indicated diagrammatically is the frame 8 serving to support both chucks<br>
5,6.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2 there are illustrated the pallet 1, the ram 2 and the<br>
transparent element 3 on a magnified scale, showing how the transparent<br>
element 3 is provided with a plurality of through-holes 9 for receiving<br>
protuberances 10 applied to the pallet 1. The protuberances 10 feature a flat top<br>
surface forming together a surface for mounting the ram 2. But in any case the<br>
protuberances 10 are configured somewhat higher than the transparent element<br>
3 so that they protrude from the transparent element 3 when it is cemented to<br>
the pallet 1. To secure the ram 2 to the pallet 1 a film of adhesive is applied<br>
between the pallet 1 and the transparent element 3 and between the ram 2 and<br>
the transparent element 3 each as is detained further on. The final thickness of<br>
this film of adhesive is determined by the difference between the height of the<br>
protuberances 10 and the height or thickness of the transparent element 3. To<br>
achieve an optimum thickness of the adhesive film the protuberances 10 are<br>
higher than the transparent element 3 by roughly twice the thickness of the film<br>
of adhesive in each case. Preferably the protuberances 10 are approximately<br>
0.1 to 0.5 mm higher than the transparent element 3 so that between the pallet<br>
1 and the flat bottom side of the transparent element 3 and between the ram 2<br>
and the flat top side of the transparent element 3 a film of adhesive in the<br>
thickness range of 0.05 to 0.25 mm is applied or can remain in each case.<br><br>
-4-<br>
It is furthermore evident that the foot of each protuberance 10 features slanted<br>
surfaces 11. These surfaces 11 serves in the present case to deflect part of the<br>
light introduced sideways into the transparent element 3 upwards so that the<br>
film of adhesive applied between the top side of the transparent element 3 and<br>
the bottom side of the ram 2 cures fast when necessary. Instead of, or in<br>
addition to, these surfaces 11 the transparent element 3 itself may be<br>
configured such that at least part of the UV light beamed thereinto sideways is<br>
deflected or dispersed. This may be done either by suitably selecting the<br>
material or inclusions may be provided in the materia! which cause the light to<br>
be deflected or dispersed. The material eiigibie for this is, for example,<br>
polycarbonate (PC), especially makrolon® or polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA).<br>
To secure the ram 2 to the pallet 1, preferably the transparent element 3 is first<br>
joined to the pallet 1. For this purpose a film of adhesive is applied to the pallet<br>
1, the adhesive preferably being applied only to the flat surfaces 11 of the pallet<br>
1 and/or the bottom side of the transparent element 3 but not to the<br>
protuberances 10. Then, the transparent element 3 is located on the pallet 1<br>
such that the protuberances 10 extend into the through-holes 9 of the<br>
transparent element 3, after which the adhesive is cured by exposing the film of<br>
adhesive via the transparent element 3 to the light initiating curing. If the ram 2<br>
is still to be located on the pallet 1 the light can be beamed into the transparent<br>
element 3 top down facewise.<br>
Positioning the transparent element 3 on the pallet 1 can be done anywhere,<br>
but in any case without the pallet 1 needing to be clamped in the chuck. Prior to<br>
positioning the ram 2 on the transparent element 3 the pallet 1 is positioned on<br>
the chuck 6 (FIG. 1), however, after which adhesive is applied to the flat top<br>
side of the transparent element 3 and/or the bottom side of the ram 2 and the<br>
ram 2 placed on the transparent element 3. Because the protuberances 10<br>
protrude slightly beyond the top side of the transparent element 3, the bottom<br>
side of the ram 2 comes to rest only on the protuberances 10, but not on the<br>
transparent element 3, the ram 2 thereby being precisely positioned relative to<br>
the pallet 1 in the Z direction, i.e. in the direction of the longitudinal centerline L.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Before curing the adhesive the ram 2 is also aligned accurately positioned in the<br>
X and Y direction relative to the pallet 1. For this purpose the centering element<br>
4 is travelled down so that the cylindrically shaped front part 2a of the ram 2<br>
enters into the central anvil opening 4a (FIG. 1) in thereby orienting the ram 2 in<br>
the X and Y direction. The adhesive is then cured by beaming the radiation<br>
initiating curing sideways into the transparent element 3.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3 there is illustrated a longitudinal section through the<br>
pallet 1 and the transparent element 3 cemented thereto. What is particularly<br>
evident from this FIG. is how groove-shaped recesses 13 are formed between<br>
the protuberances 10 of the pailet 1 and the through-holes 9 in the transparent<br>
element 3, each of which surrounds the corresponding through-holes 9 in<br>
serving to receive excess adhesive. Such recesses 13 may also be provided,<br>
where necessary, on the bottom side of the transparent element 3.<br>
Providing a transparent element 3 in this way has the advantage that non-<br>
transparent parts can now be joined to each other face coated by means of an<br>
adhesive cured by radiation which in being beamed into the transparent<br>
element needs to be deflected or dispersed at least partly in the direction of the<br>
applied adhesive.<br>
But in any case, the radiation achieving or initiating curing can be directed by<br>
means of the transparent element to locations which otherwise would not be<br>
accessible to the light.<br>
Instead of proceeding stepwise as described above in which first the<br>
transparent element 3 is cemented to the pallet 1 and then the ram 2 to the<br>
transparent element 3, the pallet 1 as well as the ram 2 could also be cemented<br>
simultaneously to the transparent element 3. For this purpose the cited three<br>
parts - pallet 1, transparent element 3 and ram 2 - would need to be joined<br>
together in application of the corresponding films of adhesive and the ram 2<br>
aligned relative to the pallet 1, after which the two films of adhesive, namely the<br>
film between pallet 1 and transparent element 3 and the film between the<br>
transparent element 3 and ram 2 are cured simultaneously by beaming the light<br><br>
-6-<br>
initiating curing into the transparent element 3. In this case all that would need<br>
to be assured is that the light beamed sideways into the transparent element 3<br>
is deflected or dispersed to both sides, i.e. in the direction of the pallet 1 as well<br>
as in the direction of the ram 2.<br>
In speaking of said element being transparent it is to be appreciated that each<br>
element is at least partly transparent to the light initiating curing of the adhesive<br>
so that the radiation beamed into the transparent element can be supplied via<br>
this element to the corresponding film of adhesive, whereas non-transparent<br>
parts in this case are to be appreciated as not being so transparent to the<br>
radiation initiating curing of the adhesive that the light can be introduced into the<br>
coated film of adhesive facewise. In no case is this to be appreciated only as<br>
parts absolutely non-transparent to light.<br>
Several possibilities exist for deflecting the radiation beamed into the<br>
transparent element 3 sideways in the direction of the applied adhesive. One<br>
way to achieve this is by a suitable selection of material of the transparent<br>
element. Another way is to provide deflecting surfaces as described above on at<br>
least one of the two parts to be joined together.<br>
Unlike conventional systems in which the ram 2 is secured to the pallet 1<br>
mechanically, the system in accordance with the invention has the salient<br>
advantage that locating the ram 2 on the pallet 1 is now very fast and very<br>
precise. Contrary to mechnical positioning, cementing now makes it possible to<br>
secure the ram 2 practically with no force so that it can now be secured to the<br>
pallet 1 fast and with high absolute accuracy. Palletizing the ram 2 in this way<br>
now makes it possible to replace it simply and quickly where necessary and<br>
located accurately positioned in a press.<br><br>
