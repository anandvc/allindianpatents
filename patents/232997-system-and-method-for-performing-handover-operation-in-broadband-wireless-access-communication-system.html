				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband wireless access<br>
communication system, and more particularly to a system and method for<br>
performing a handover operation upon receipt of an SS (Subscriber Station)<br>
request in a BWA (Broadband Wireless Access) communication system using an<br>
OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Intensive research is being conducted into the 4G (4th Generation)<br>
communication system, one of the next generation communication systems, to<br>
provide a plurality of users with specific services having a variety of QoSs<br>
(Quality of Services) at a transfer rate of about 100 Mbps. Presently, the 3G (3rd<br>
Generation) communication system provides a transfer rate of about 384kbps in<br>
an outdoor channel environment having a relatively poor channel environment,<br>
and provides a maximum transfer rate of about 2Mbps in an indoor channel<br>
environment having a relatively good channel environment. A wireless Local<br>
Area Network (LAN) system and a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)<br>
system have been designed to provide a transfer rate of 20~50 Mbps. The 4G<br>
communication system provides the wireless LAN and MAN systems a<br>
relatively high transfer rate with mobility and QoS, and many secondory<br>
developers are conducting intensive research into high-speed services to be<br>
provided from the 4G communication system.<br>
However, the wireless MAN system is suitable for a high-speed<br>
communication service in that it has a wide coverage area and supports a<br>
high-speed transfer rate, but it does not consider the mobility of a subscriber<br>
station (SS) at all, so that there is no consideration of the need for a handover<br>
operation (i.e., a cell selection operation) caused by the movement of the SS.<br>
The communication system currently considered in IEEE (Institute of Electrical<br>
and Electronics Engineers) 802.16a specification acts as a specific communication<br>
system for performing a ranging operation between the SS and a base station (BS).<br>
The communication system considered in the IEEE 802.16a specification will<br>
hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a BWA communication system using<br>
an OFDM/OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing / Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access) scheme. In more detail, Fig. 1 depicts the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system.<br>
The wireless MAN system acting as a BWA communication system has a<br>
much wider coverage area and a much higher transfer rate than the wireless LAN<br>
system. In case of adapting the OFDM scheme and the OFDMA scheme to a<br>
physical channel of the wireless MAN system to provide the wireless MAN<br>
system with a broadband transmission network, this application system is referred<br>
to as an IEEE 802.16a communication system. The IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system applies the OFDM/OFDMA scheme to the wireless MAN<br>
system, such that it transmits a physical channel signal using a plurality of<br>
sub-carriers, resulting in high-speed data transmission. The IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system has been designed to consider the mobility of an SS in the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system. There is no detailed specification for the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the IEEE 802.16a communication system has a single<br>
cell structure, and is composed of a BS 100 and a plurality of SSs 110, 120, and<br>
130 managed by the BS 100. Signal transmission/reception among the BS 100<br>
and the SSs 110, 120, and 130 can be established using the OFDM/OFDMA<br>
scheme. A downlink frame structure for use in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system will hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 2 is a conceptual diagram illustrating the downlink frame structure for<br>
use in the BWA communication system using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme. In<br>
more detail, Fig. 2 depicts a downlink frame structure for use in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the downlink frame includes a preamble field 200, a<br>
broadcast control field 210, and a plurality of TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)<br>
fields 220 and 230. A synchronous signal (i.e., a preamble sequence) for<br>
acquiring synchronization between the BS and the SSs is transmitted via the<br>
preamble field 200. The broadcast control field 210 is composed of a<br>
DL(DownLink)_MAP field 211 and a UL(UpLink)_MAP field 213. The<br>
DL MAP field 211 is adapted to transmit the DL MAP message, and a plurality<br>
of IEs (Information Elements) contained in the DL MAP message are shown in<br>
the following Table 1:<br><br>
With reference to the above Table 1, the DL MAP message includes a<br>
Management Message Type field indicative of a plurality of IEs (i.e., transmission<br>
message type information); a PHY (PHYsical) Synchronization field established<br>
in response to a modulation or demodulation scheme applied to a physical channel<br>
in order to perform synchronization acquisition; a DCD count field indicative of<br>
count information in response to a DCD (Downlink Channel Descriptor) message<br>
configuration variation containing a downlink burst profile; a Base Station ID<br>
field indicative of a Base Station Identifier; and a Number of DL MAP Element n<br>
field indicative of the number of elements found after the Base Station ID.<br>
Particularly, the DL MAP message (not shown in Table 1) includes information<br>
associated with ranging codes allocated to individual ranging processes to be<br>
described later.<br>
The UL MAP field 213 is adapted to transmit the UL MAP message, and<br>
a plurality of IEs contained in the UL MAP message are shown in the following<br>
Table 2:<br><br>
With reference to Table 2, the UL MAP message includes a Management<br>
Message Type field indicative of a plurality of IEs (i.e., transmission message type<br>
information); an Uplink Channel ID field indicative of a used Uplink Channel ID;<br>
a UCD (Uplink Channel Descriptor) count field indicative of count information in<br>
response to a UCD message configuration variation containing an uplink burst<br>
profile; and a Number of UL MAP Element n field indicative of the number of<br>
elements found after the UCD count field. In this case, the uplink channel ID<br>
can only be allocated to a Media Access Control (MAC) sub-layer.<br>
The UIUC (Uplink Interval Usage Code) area records information<br>
indicative of the usage of offsets recorded in the offset area. For example,<br>
provided that 2 is recorded in the UIUC area, a starting offset for use in the initial<br>
ranging process is recorded in the offset area. Provided that 3 is recorded in the<br>
UIUC area, a starting offset for use in either the bandwidth request ranging or the<br>
maintenance ranging process is recorded in the offset area. The offset area<br>
records a starting offset value for use in either the initial ranging process or the<br>
maintenance ranging process according to the information recorded in the UIUC<br>
area. Physical channel characteristic information to be transferred from the UIUC<br>
area is recorded in the UCD.<br>
Provided that the SS results in a ranging failure, a predetermined backoff<br>
value is set up to increase the probability of success in the next trial, and the<br>
ranging process is re-performed after the lapse of a predetermined time<br>
corresponding to the backoff time. In this case, information needed for<br>
determining the backoff value is contained in the UCD message. The<br>
aforementioned UCD message configuration is shown in the following Table 3:<br><br>
With reference to the Table 3, the UCD message includes a Management<br>
Message Type field indicative of a plurality of IEs (i.e., transmission message type<br>
information); an Uplink Channel ID field indicative of a used Uplink Channel<br>
Identifier; a Configuration Change Count field counted by the BS; a mini-slot size<br>
field indicative of the number of mini-slots of the uplink physical channel; a<br>
Ranging Backoff Start field indicative of a backoff start point for an initial<br>
ranging process, i.e., an initial backoff window size for the initial ranging process;<br>
a Ranging Backoff End field indicative of a backoff end point for the initial<br>
ranging process, i.e., a final backoff window size; a Request Backoff Start field<br>
indicative of a backoff start point for establishing contention data and requests,<br>
i.e., an initial backoff window size; and a Request Backoff End field indicative of<br>
a backoff end point for establishing contention data and requests, i.e., a final<br>
backoff window size. In this case, the backoff value indicates a kind of standby<br>
time which is a duration time between the start of SS's access failure and the start<br>
of SS's re-access time. If the SS fails to execute an initial ranging process, the<br>
BS must transmit the backoff values indicative of standby time information for<br>
which the SS must wait for the next ranging process to the SS. For example,<br>
provided that a specific number of 10 is determined by the "Ranging Backoff<br>
Start" and "Ranging Backoff End" fields shown in Table 3, the SS must pass over<br>
210 access executable chances (i.e., 1024 access executable chances) and then<br>
execute the next ranging process according to a Truncated Binary Exponential<br>
Backoff Algorithm.<br>
The TDM fields 220 and 230 indicate fields corresponding to timeslots<br>
allocated using a TDM/TDMA (Time Division Multiplexing / Time Division<br>
Multiple Access) scheme. The BS transmits broadcast information to be<br>
broadcast to SSs managed by the BS over the DL MAP field 211 using a<br>
predetermined center carrier. The SSs monitor all the frequency bands having<br>
been previously allocated to individual SSs upon receipt of a power-on signal,<br>
such that they detect a pilot channel signal having the highest signal intensity, i.e.,<br>
the highest pilot CINR (Carrier to Interference and Noise Ratio). It is<br>
determined that the SS belongs to a specific BS which has transmitted the pilot<br>
channel signal with the highest pilot CINR. The SSs check the DL MAP field<br>
211 and the UL MAP field 213 of the downlink frame having been transmitted<br>
from the BS, such that they recognize their own uplink and downlink control<br>
information and specific information indicative of a real data<br>
transmission/reception position.<br>
The downlink frame structure for use in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system has been disclosed with reference to Fig. 2. An uplink<br>
frame structure for use in the IEEE 802.16a communication system will<br>
hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating an uplink frame structure for use<br>
in a BWA communication system using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme. In more<br>
detail, Fig. 3 depicts an uplink frame structure for use in the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system.<br>
Prior to describing the uplink frame structure shown in Fig. 3, three<br>
ranging processes for use in the IEEE 802.16a communication system, i.e., an<br>
initial ranging process, a maintenance ranging process (also called a period<br>
ranging process), and a bandwidth request ranging process will hereinafter be<br>
described in detail.<br>
First, the initial ranging process will be described in detail.<br>
The initial ranging process for establishing synchronization acquisition<br>
between the BS and the SS establishes a correct time offset between the SS and<br>
the BS, and is adapted to control a transmission power (also called a transmit<br>
power). In more detail, the SS is powered on, and receives the DL MAP<br>
message, the UL MAP message, and the UCD message to establish<br>
synchronization with the BS in such a way that it performs the initial ranging<br>
process to control the transmission power between the BS and the time offset. In<br>
this case, the IEEE 802.16a communication system uses the OFDM/OFDMA<br>
scheme, such that the ranging procedure requires a plurality of ranging<br>
sub-channels and a plurality of ranging codes. The BS allocates available<br>
ranging codes to the SS according to objectives of the ranging processes (i.e., the<br>
ranging process type information). This operation will hereinafter be described<br>
in detail.<br>
The ranging codes are created by segmenting a PN (Pseudorandom Noise)<br>
sequence having a length of 215-1 bits into predetermined units. Typically, one<br>
ranging channel is composed of two ranging sub-channels each having a length of<br>
53 bits, PN code segmentation is executed over the ranging channel having the<br>
length of 106 bits, resulting in the creation of a ranging code. A maximum of 48<br>
ranging codes RC#1~RC#48 can be assigned to the SS. More than two ranging<br>
codes for every SS are applied as a default value to the three ranging processes<br>
having different objectives, i.e., an initial ranging process, a period ranging<br>
process, and a bandwidth request ranging process. In this way, a ranging code is<br>
differently assigned to the SS according to each objective of the three ranging<br>
processes. For example, N ranging codes are assigned to the SS for the initial<br>
ranging process as denoted by a prescribed term of "N RC (Ranging Codes) for<br>
Initial Ranging", M ranging codes are assigned to the SS for the periodic ranging<br>
process as denoted by a prescribed term of "M RCs for maintenance ranging", and<br>
L ranging codes are assigned to the SS for the bandwidth request ranging process<br>
as denoted by a prescribed term of "L RCs for BW-request ranging". The<br>
assigned ranging codes are transmitted to the SSs using the DL MAP message,<br>
and the SSs perform necessary ranging procedures using the ranging codes<br>
contained in the DL MAP message.<br>
Second, the period ranging process will be described in detail.<br>
The period ranging process is periodically executed such that an SS which<br>
has controlled a time offset between the SS and the BS, and a transmission power<br>
in the initial ranging process can control a channel state associated with the BS.<br>
The SS performs the period ranging process using the ranging codes assigned for<br>
the period ranging process.<br>
Third, the bandwidth request ranging process will be described.<br>
The bandwidth request ranging process is adapted to enable the SS, which<br>
has controlled a time offset between the SS and the BS, and a transmission power<br>
in the initial ranging process, to request a bandwidth allocation from the BS in<br>
such a way that the SS can communicate with the BS.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the uplink frame includes an initial maintenance<br>
opportunity field 300 using the initial and period ranging processes, a request<br>
contention opportunity field 310 using the bandwidth request ranging process, and<br>
an SS scheduled data field 320 composed of uplink data of a plurality of SSs.<br>
The initial maintenance opportunity field 300 includes a plurality of access burst<br>
fields each having real initial and period ranging processes, and a collision field in<br>
which there is a collision between the access burst fields. The request contention<br>
opportunity field 310 includes a plurality of bandwidth request fields each having<br>
a real bandwidth request ranging process, and a collision field in which there is a<br>
collision between the bandwidth request ranging fields. The SS scheduled data<br>
fields 320 are each composed of a plurality of SS scheduled data fields (i.e., SS 1<br>
scheduled data field ~ SS N scheduled data field). The SS transition gap is<br>
positioned between the SS scheduled data fields (i.e., SS 1 scheduled data field ~<br>
SS N scheduled data field).<br>
Fig. 3 has disclosed the uplink frame structure for the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system. A ranging procedure for the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system using an OFDM scheme will hereinafter be described with<br>
reference to Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow chart illustrating the ranging procedure between the SS and<br>
the BS in a BWA communication system using the OFDM scheme.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the SS 400 monitors all of its own predetermined<br>
frequencies upon receipt of a power-on signal, such that it detects a pilot channel<br>
signal having the highest signal intensity, i.e., the highest pilot CINR (Carrier to<br>
Interference and Noise Ratio). It is determined that SS 400 belongs to a specific<br>
BS 420 which has transmitted the pilot channel signal with the highest pilot CINR.<br>
The SS 400 receives a downlink frame preamble from the BS 420, such that it<br>
acquires system synchronization with the BS 420.<br>
Upon establishing synchronization between the SS 400 and the BS 420, the<br>
BS 420 transmits the DL MAP message and the UL MAP message to the SS 400<br>
at steps 411 and 413, respectively. As previously shown in Table 1, the<br>
DL MAP message includes a variety of information, for example, requisite<br>
information for establishing synchronization between the SS 400 and the BS 420<br>
in a downlink direction and configuration information of a physical channel<br>
capable of receiving a variety of messages transmitted to a plurality of SSs 400<br>
over a downlink channel. As previously shown in Table 2, the UL MAP<br>
message informs the SS 400 of SS scheduling interval information and physical<br>
channel configuration information, etc.<br>
The DL MAP message is periodically broadcast from the BS to all the SSs.<br>
In the case where the SS 400 can continuously receive the periodically-broadcast<br>
DLMAP message, it is assumed that the SS is synchronized with the BS. The<br>
SSs receiving the DL MAP message can receive all the messages transmitted<br>
over a downlink channel.<br>
As stated above in Table 3, if the SS results in an access failure, the BS<br>
transmits the UCD message containing available backoff value indication<br>
information to the SS.<br>
In case of performing the above ranging process, the SS 400 transmits an<br>
RNG_REQ (Ranging Request) message to the BS 420 at step 415. The BS 420<br>
receiving the RNG REQ message transmits an RNG RSP (Ranging Response)<br>
message containing information for controlling a variety of factors (e.g.,<br>
frequency, time, and transmission power) to the SS 400 at step 417.<br>
The RNG REQ message configuration is shown in the following Table 4:<br><br>
With reference to Table 4, the Downlink Channel ID field indicates a<br>
downlink channel ID contained in the RNG-REQ message received in the SS via<br>
the UCD. The Pending Until Complete field indicates priority information of a<br>
transmission ranging response. In more detail, if the Pending Until Complete<br>
field is set to "0", a previous ranging response has priority. Otherwise, if the<br>
Pending Until Complete field is not set to "0", a current transmission ranging<br>
response has priority.<br>
A detailed configuration of the RNG RSP message to the RNG REQ<br>
message shown in Table 4 is shown in Table 5:<br><br>
With reference to Table 5, the Uplink Channel ID field indicates an uplink<br>
channel ID contained in the RNG REQ message.<br>
Fig. 4 has disclosed the ranging process when the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system uses the OFDM scheme. A ranging procedure for the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system using the OFDMA scheme will hereinafter<br>
be described with reference to Fig. 5. In this case, the IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system contains a dedicated ranging interval in order to enable the<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system to more effectively perform the ranging<br>
process using the OFDMA scheme, so that it may transmit the Ranging-Code<br>
instead of the RNG REQ message according to a ranging code transmission<br>
scheme in the dedicated ranging interval.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the BS 520 transmits the DL MAP message and the<br>
UL MAP message to the SS 500 at steps 511 and 513, respectively. Detailed<br>
operations of steps 511 and 513 are equal to those of steps 411 and 413. The<br>
communication system using the OFDMA scheme of Fig. 5 transmits a ranging<br>
code instead of the RNG-REQ message having been described in Fig. 4 at step<br>
515. The BS 520 receiving the ranging code transmits the RNG RSP message<br>
to the SS 500 at step 517.<br>
New information must be added to the RNG RSP message such that<br>
information corresponding to the ranging code transmitted to the BS can be<br>
recorded in the RNG RSP message. The aforementioned new information to be<br>
added to the RNG RSP message is composed of a ranging code (i.e., a received<br>
ranging CDMA code), a ranging symbol (i.e., an OFDM symbol in the received<br>
ranging CDMA code), a ranging sub-channel (i.e., a ranging sub-channel in the<br>
received ranging CDMA code), and a ranging frame number (i.e., a frame number<br>
in the received ranging CDMA code).<br>
As described above, the IEEE 802.16a communication system operates on<br>
the basis of a fixed state of a current SS (i.e., there is no consideration given to the<br>
mobility of the SS) and a single cell structure. However, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system has been defined as a system for considering the SS's<br>
mobility in the IEEE 802.16a communication system, such that the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system must consider the SS's mobility in a multi-cell<br>
environment. In order to provide the SS's mobility in the multi-cell environment,<br>
individual operating modes of the SS and the BS must be converted . However,<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system has not proposed a new method for the<br>
SS's mobility in the multi-cell environment. In conclusion, a handover system<br>
considering both an idle state and a communication service execution mode must<br>
be developed to provide mobility to an SS in a IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above<br>
problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and<br>
method for performing a handover operation in a BWA communication system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method<br>
for performing a handover operation upon receipt of an SS request signal in a<br>
BWA communication system.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the above and other<br>
objects can be accomplished by the provision of a subscriber station (SS)<br>
handover method upon receiving a handover request from the SS in a BWA<br>
(Broadband Wireless Access) communication system comprised of a serving BS<br>
(Base Station) and a plurality of neighbor BSs adjacent to the serving BS,<br>
comprising the steps of: a) receiving from the serving BS information relating to<br>
the plurality of neighbor BSs; b) measuring CINRs (Carrier to Interference and<br>
Noise Ratios) of pilot signals transferred from the neighbor BSs upon receipt of<br>
the information relating to the neighbor BSs; c) transmitting a handover request<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or<br>
similar elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are<br>
depicted in different drawings. In the following description, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be<br>
omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a BWA communication system using<br>
an OFDM/OFDMA scheme to perform a variety of functions in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Prior to describing the BWA communication system shown in Fig. 6, it is<br>
noted that the present invention adapts the IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
using an OFDM/OFDMA scheme as a representative example. It is also noted<br>
that an IEEE 802.16e communication system acting as a communication system<br>
for considering the mobility of an SS in the IEEE 802.16a communication system<br>
has not been developed yet. Provided that the SS's mobility is considered in<br>
the IEEE 802.16a communication system, it is possible to consider the multi-cell<br>
structure and an SS's handover operation (i.e., a cell selection operation) between<br>
the multi-cells. Therefore, the present invention provides the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, the IEEE 802.16e communication system includes a<br>
multi-cell structure, i.e., a plurality of cells 600 and 650. In more detail, the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system includes a first BS 610 for managing the<br>
cell 600, a second BS 640 for managing the cell 650, and a plurality of SSs 611,<br>
613, 630, 651, and 653. Signal transmission/reception among the BSs 610 and<br>
640 and the SSs 611, 613, 630, 651, and 653 is established using the<br>
OFDM/OFDMA scheme. Among the subscriber stations 611,613,630,651,and 653,<br>
the subscriber station 630 is located in a boundary region, or a handover region,<br>
between the cell 600 and the cell 650. Therefore, it is necessary to support a<br>
handover of the subscriber station 630 in order to support mobility of the<br>
subscriber station 630 .<br>
In general, and according to an embodiment of the present invention an SS<br>
for use in the BWA communication system receives a plurality of signals from a<br>
plurality of BSs. The SS detects individual CINRs (Carrier to interference and<br>
Noise Ratios) of the received pilot signals. The SS selects a specific BS, which<br>
has transmitted a pilot channel having the highest CINR from among CINRs of<br>
the pilot signals, and determines the selected BS to be a serving BS (i.e., an active<br>
BS) to which the SS belongs. In more detail, the SS selects a BS having the best<br>
reception state from among a plurality of BSs transmitting the pilot signals, and<br>
recognizes the selected BS as its own serving BS. For the convenience of<br>
description, the term "Active BS" or "Serving BS" may be employed in the<br>
present invention for illustrative purposes.<br>
The SS which has selected the active BS receives a downlink frame and a<br>
uplink frame from the active BS. The detailed configurations of the downlink<br>
frame and the uplink frame received from the active BS have been disclosed in<br>
the prior art, so that they will herein be omitted for the convenience of description.<br>
The present invention must add new IEs (Information Elements) to the DL MAP<br>
message provided from the IEEE 802.16a / IEEE 802.16e communication system<br>
in such a way that it can support a handover operation upon receiving a request<br>
from the SS. A detailed configuration of the DL MAP message for supporting<br>
the handover operation upon receipt of the SS's request is shown in the following<br>
Table 6:<br><br>
With reference to the above Table 6, the number of neighbor BSs (denoted<br>
by "Neighbor list BS Num") indicates the number of neighbor BSs contained in<br>
the neighbor list. The neighbor list field indicates the list of neighbor BSs of the<br>
active BS. The Neighbor list Info field indicates neighbor BSs contained in the<br>
neighbor list, i.e., a plurality of neighbor BSs from a first neighbor BS to the last<br>
neighbor BS. The neighbor list information denoted by "Neighbor list Info"<br>
includes a Neighbor list BS ID field, a Neighbor Frequency field, a Neighbor<br>
Frequency Offset field, and a Neighbor Frame Offset field. The Neighbor list<br>
BS ID field indicates IDs of individual BSs contained in the neighbor list. The<br>
Neighbor Frequency field indicates a center frequency of a corresponding<br>
neighbor BS. The Neighbor Frequency Offset field indicates a frequency offset<br>
of a corresponding neighbor BS. The neighbor frame offset field indicates a<br>
frame offset of a corresponding neighbor BS. The Measurement Info field<br>
includes a minimum pilot signal CINR (Pilot min CINR) field, a maximum time<br>
(MAXJT) field and a minimum time (MIN_T) field. The Pilot min CINR field<br>
is adapted as a reference for selecting neighbor BSs containable in the Neighbor<br>
list Info field from among a plurality of BSs of the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system. In more detail, only BSs transmitting pilot signals each higher than the<br>
Pilot min CINR can be adapted as neighbor BSs contained in the neighbor list.<br>
The MAXJT field indicates a maximum time for enabling each neighbor BS to<br>
have a pilot signal CINR of less than the Pilot min CINR. In more detail, the<br>
neighbor BSs must transmit pilot signals higher than the Pilot min CINR. If the<br>
pilot signal less than the Pilot min CINR is transmitted during the MAXJT time, a<br>
corresponding neighbor BS is removed from the neighbor list. In this way, if the<br>
neighbor BS capable of transmitting the pilot signal having the Pilot min CINR<br>
during the MAXJT time has been removed from the neighbor list, there is no need<br>
for the SS to measure an unnecessary pilot CINR. The MINT time indicates a<br>
minimum time during which the highest pilot CINR from among a plurality of<br>
pilot CINRs of the neighbor BSs must be higher than a pilot CINR of the active<br>
BS. In more detail, in order to control the SS to be handed over from the active<br>
BS to a specific neighbor BS (i.e., a target BS), a CINR of a pilot signal<br>
transmitted from the target BS must be higher than that of the other pilot signal<br>
transmitted from the active BS during more than the MINT time.The MINT is<br>
set in order to prevent a ping-pong phenomenon in which the subscriber station<br>
sends a handover request to the base station each time a CINR of a received pilot<br>
channel is higher than a CINR of the active base station. In this case, it should<br>
be noted that the MAXJT time and the MINT time may be differently<br>
determined according to state and channel condition information of individual<br>
BSs in the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
A ranging request step during which the SS having received the DL MAP<br>
message and the UL MAP message requests the ranging process from the active<br>
BS and a ranging response step during which a response signal to the ranging<br>
request is transmitted to the SS which has transmitted the ranging request are<br>
equal to those of the prior art, such that their detailed description will herein<br>
omitted for the convenience of description. The SS having successfully<br>
established the ranging process wirelessly communicates with the active BS.<br>
The handover process in response to the SS request signal during the wireless<br>
access communication time between the SS and the active BS will hereinafter be<br>
described with reference to Fig. 7.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flow chart illustrating the handover procedure upon receiving a<br>
handover request from the SS in the IEEE 802.16e communication system using<br>
the OFDM scheme in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, upon establishing system synchronization between an<br>
SS 701 and a serving BS (also called an active BS) 702, the serving BS 702<br>
transmits the DL MAP message and the UL MAP message to the SS 701 at steps<br>
711 and 712, respectively. The DL MAP message format and the UL MAP<br>
message format have been disclosed in Table 6 and Table 2, respectively, such that<br>
their detailed description will herein be omitted. The SS 701 receives the<br>
DLMAP message to detect information of neighbor BSs of the SS 701, such that<br>
the SS 701 measures CINRs of the pilot signals received from the neighbor BSs at<br>
step 731.<br>
The SS 701 temporarily stops receiving transmission data of the serving<br>
BS 702. In more detail, the SS 701 measures CINRs of the pilot signals received<br>
from the neighbor BSs during a reception interrupt time of the transmission data<br>
of the serving BS 702. In this case, the SS 701 does not measure individual<br>
CINRs of the pilot signals received from all the neighbor BSs contained in the<br>
neighbor list contained in the DL MAP message, and is adapted to measure only<br>
CINRs of pilot channel signals received from the neighbor BSs excluded by the<br>
MINT time. The method for measuring the CINRs of the pilot signals received<br>
from the neighbor BSs will be described in detail.<br>
The SS 701 establishes synchronization with individual neighbor BSs<br>
using a variety of information of neighbor BSs contained in the neighbor list of<br>
the DL MAP message. Upon establishing synchronization with the neighbor<br>
BSs, the SS 701 measures CINRs of pilot signals received from the neighbor BSs.<br>
The SS 701 having measured the CINRs of the pilot signals received from<br>
the neighbor BSs determines whether it is handed over to another BS instead of<br>
the serving BS 702. The handover determination step of the SS 701 will be<br>
described in detail. At least one of the CINRs of pilot signals received from the<br>
neighbor BSs must satisfy the MAX T condition. Provided that the CINRs of<br>
the pilot signals received from the neighbor BSs contained in the neighbor list are<br>
less than the minimum pilot CINR denoted by "Pilot min CINR" during more than<br>
the MAX T time, corresponding pilot signals are removed from the neighbor list,<br>
such that the MAX T condition must be satisfied. In this case, the neighbor BSs<br>
which have satisfied the MAX T condition are each called a candidate BS (i.e., a<br>
target BS). If the MAX T condition has been satisfied, the SS 701 determines<br>
whether CINRs of pilot signals transmitted from the neighbor BSs are greater than<br>
a CINR of a pilot signal received from the serving BS 702. If it is determined<br>
that the pilot signal CINR received from the serving BS 702 is greater than<br>
individual CINRs of the pilot signals received from the neighbor BSs, the SS 702<br>
does not request the handover operation from the serving BS 702. Otherwise, if<br>
it is determined that the pilot signal CINR received from the serving BS 702 is<br>
less than CINRs of the pilot signals received from the neighbor BSs, the SS 701<br>
requests the handover operation from the serving BS 702. Needless to say, the<br>
SS 701 requests the handover operation from the serving BS 702 on the condition<br>
that a neighbor BS satisfying the MIN T condition is found. The reason why the<br>
SS 701 requests the handover operation from the serving BS 702 on the condition<br>
that the MIN T time condition has been satisfied is to prevent the aforementioned<br>
pingpong phenomenon from being generated.<br>
If the handover operation has been determined, the SS 701 transmits a<br>
handover request (HOREQ) message to the serving BS 702 at step 713. The<br>
HOREQ message format is shown in Table 7:<br><br><br>
Prior to describing Table 7, it should be noted that neighbor BSs act as<br>
target BSs after receiving a handover request from the SS 701, such that they are<br>
the same as the target BSs after the SS has generated the handover request.<br>
Referring to Table 7, the Neighbor list BS carrier frequency field indicates carrier<br>
frequencies of neighbor BSs (i.e., target BSs) which have received the handover<br>
request from the SS 701. The CINR of neighbor list BS field indicates CINRs of<br>
pilot signals transmitted from the neighbor BSs. The QoS field indicates a<br>
quality of service (QoS) desired by the SS 701. The BW request field indicates a<br>
bandwidth requested in response to the QoS desired by the SS 701. In this case,<br>
the QoS is composed of a variety of service grades, i.e., an Unsolicited Grant<br>
Service (UGS), a Real-Time Polling Service (rtPS), a Non-Real-Time Polling<br>
Service (nrtPS), and a Best Effort Service (BE). The serving BS 702 having<br>
received the handover request message from the SS 701 arranges neighbor BSs<br>
contained in the handover request message. There are a variety of possible<br>
methods for arranging the neighbor BSs. As stated above, the CINR of the<br>
neighbor BS which stops measuring the CINR of the pilot signal using the SS 701<br>
is set to "0". The serving BS 702 may configure information of the arranged<br>
neighbor BSs in the form of a list, and may store the list-formatted information.<br>
The serving BS 702 arranging the neighbor BSs sequentially transmits an<br>
HO_CONNECTION_REQ (Handover Connection Request) message to<br>
corresponding neighbor BSs (i.e., target BSs) according to the arranged order of<br>
the neighbor BSs at steps 714 and 716. The HO_CONNECTION_REQ message<br>
format is shown in the following Table 8:<br><br><br>
With reference to Table 8, the Target BS ID indicates ID information of the<br>
target BS. The CID (Connection ID) is a connection CID assigned from the<br>
serving BS 702 to the SS 701. The QoS field indicates a quality of service<br>
(QoS) desired by the SS 701. The BW request field indicates a bandwidth<br>
requested in response to the QoS desired by the SS 701. The reason why the<br>
serving BS 702 transmits the HO_CONNECTION_REQ message to the target<br>
BSs (i.e., a target BS1 703 and a target BS2 704) is to determine whether or not a<br>
QoS and a bandwidth associated with the service desired by the SS 701 can be<br>
satisfied.<br>
If the target BSs 703 and 704 receive the HO_CONNECTION_REQ<br>
message, they transmit the HO_CONNECTION_RSP (Handover Connection<br>
Response) message to the serving BS 702 at steps 715 and 717. A representative<br>
example of the HO CONNECTION RSP message format is shown in the<br>
following Table 9:<br><br>
With reference to Table 9, the Target BS ID field indicates ID information<br>
of the target BS transmitting the HO_CONNECTION_RSP, the CID is a<br>
connection ID used for the serving BS 702 of the SS 701. The ACK/NACK<br>
field indicates HO (handover) approval or disapproval information of the SS 701.<br>
In more detail, in the case where the ACK message is contained in the<br>
HO CONNECTION RSP message, a corresponding target BS is able to provide<br>
the SS 701 with a handover function. In the case where the NACK message is<br>
contained in the HO CONNECTION RSP message, a corresponding target BS is<br>
unable to provide the SS 701 with the handover function. As shown in Fig. 7,<br>
the target BS1 703 transmits the HO CONNECTION RES message containing<br>
the NACK field indicative of an handover support disable state for the SS 701.<br>
It is assumed that the target BS2 704 transmits the HO_CONNECTION_RSP<br>
message containing the ACK field indicative of a handover support enable state<br>
for the SS 701.<br>
The HO_CONNECTION_REQ message and the<br>
HO CONNECTION RSP message are sequentially transmitted as shown in Fig.<br>
7, but they may also be transmitted simultaneously if needed.<br>
Upon receiving the HO CONNECTION RSP message from the target<br>
BSs, the serving BS 702 detects the ACK/NACK field contained in the received<br>
HO_CONNECTION_RSP message, such that it sets the target BS (i.e., the target<br>
BS2 704) which has transmitted the HO_CONNECTION_RSP message<br>
containing the ACK field to a last target BS to which the SS 701 is handed over.<br>
Thereafter, the serving BS 702 transmits the HO RSP (Handover Response)<br>
message containing the last target BS information to the SS 701 at step 718. The<br>
HO RSP message includes information of the last target BS to which the SS 701<br>
is handed over. A representative example of the HO RSP message is shown in<br>
Table 10:<br><br>
With reference to Table 10, the Target BS ID field indicates ID information<br>
of the last target BS to which the SS 701 is handed over. The Target BS carrier<br>
frequency field indicates a carrier frequency of the last target BS. The serving<br>
BS 702 having transmitted the HORSP message transmits an<br>
HO CONNECTION CFM (Handover Connection Confirmation) message to the<br>
last target BS (i.e., the target BS2 704) at step 719. In this case, the<br>
HO_CONNECTION_CFM message indicating that the SS 701 will be handed<br>
over to the last target BS 704 is transmitted. A representative example of the<br>
HO_CONNECTION_CFM message is shown in Table 11:<br>
[Table 11]<br><br>
With reference to Table. 11, the Target BS ID field indicates ID<br>
information of a neighbor BS (i.e., the last target BS) receiving the<br>
HO_CONNECTION_CFM message. The CID indicates a connection ID<br>
assigned from the serving BS 702 to the SS 701. The serving BS 702 having<br>
transmitted the HO_CONNECTIN_CFM message to the target BS2 704 releases a<br>
link connected to the SS 701 at step 734.<br>
The target BS2 704 transmits the DL MAP message and the UL MAP<br>
message to the SS 701 at steps 720 and 721, respectively. The DL MAP<br>
message and the UL MAP message include updated information of the SS 701.<br>
The SS 701 having received the DL MAP message and the UL MAP message<br>
transmits an RNG REQ (Ranging Request) message to the target BS2 704 at step<br>
722. The target BS2 704 having received the RNG REQ message transmits the<br>
RNG RSP message acting as a response message associated with the RNG REQ<br>
message to the SS 701 at step 723.A detailed process performed in the steps 720<br>
to 723 is identical to the process performed in the steps 411 to 417 illustrated in<br>
Fig. 4. Therefore, a detailed description of these steps will not be given again<br>
herein.<br>
Fig. 7 has disclosed the handover procedure upon receiving a handover<br>
request from the SS in the IEEE 802.16e communication system using the OFDM<br>
scheme. Fig. 8 is a flow chart illustrating a handover procedure upon receiving a<br>
handover request from the SS in the IEEE 802.16e communication system using<br>
the OFDMA scheme in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Prior to describing Fig. 8 in detail, it should be noted that steps 811 to 821<br>
and steps 831 to 834 shown in Fig. 8 are equal to steps 711 to 721 and steps 731<br>
to 734 shown in Fig. 7, respectively, such that their detailed description will<br>
herein be omitted. Because the OFDMA scheme is applied to Fig. 8, the SS 801<br>
transmits a ranging code instead of the RNG REQ message to the last target BS<br>
(i.e., the target BS2 804) at step 822. The target BS2 804 having received the<br>
ranging code transmits the RNG RSP message acting as a response associated<br>
with the ranging code to the SS 801 at step 823. In more detail, the handover<br>
procedure of Fig. 7 is substantially equal to that of Fig. 8, however, the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system transmits the RNG REQ message according to<br>
the OFDM scheme in Fig. 7 scheme whereas it transmits the ranging code<br>
according to the OFDMA scheme in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 has disclosed the handover<br>
procedure upon receipt of a handover request from the SS in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system using the OFDMA scheme. The SS internal<br>
configuration for performing inventive functions will hereinafter be described<br>
with reference to Fig. 9.<br>
Fig. 9 is a block diagram illustrating the SS internal configuration for<br>
performing inventive functions in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to Fig. 9, the SS internal configuration includes a<br>
matched filter 900, a reception power measurement unit 910, a reception power<br>
comparator 920, a controller 930, and a transmitter 940. The matched filter 900<br>
determines whether a PN (Pseudo Noise) code for synchronization detection is<br>
synchronized or not, and outputs a predetermined energy value according to the<br>
determined result. In this case, the correlator may also be adapted as the<br>
matched filter 900. The matched filter 900 compares the received<br>
synchronization detection PN code with a unique PN code of the SS, and outputs<br>
the energy value in association with the same PN code. In more detail, the<br>
matched filter 900 sequentially enters a reception signal of the SS in a<br>
predetermined window, and performs a predetermined bit operation in parallel to<br>
the unique PN code value, resulting in the sum of the bit-operation values.<br>
Therefore, if the reception signal of the SS is equal to the unique PN code value<br>
stored in the SS, this condition is called an auto-correlation state, such that a<br>
maximum energy value is generated. If the SS reception signal is different from<br>
the unique PN code value, this condition is called an inconsistent synchronization<br>
state, such that a relatively low energy value is generated. Typically, the output<br>
energy values are compared with a predetermined threshold value so that it is<br>
determined whether the auto-correlation state is established. In conclusion, the<br>
output value of the matched filter 900 is compared with the predetermined<br>
threshold value so that the presence or absence of the auto-correlation state can be<br>
determined.<br>
If the reception power measurement unit 910 is synchronized with a pilot<br>
signal received from each neighbor BS via the matched filter, the reception power<br>
measurement Unit 910 measures the reception power of the received pilot signal.<br>
The reception power measurement unit 910 measures the CINR of the received<br>
pilot signal, and transmits the measured CINR of the pilot signal to the reception<br>
power comparator 920. Upon receiving CINRs of the pilot signals from the<br>
reception power measurement unit 910, the reception power comparator 920<br>
compares the received pilot signal CINRs of the neighbor BSs with a<br>
predetermined threshold value (i.e., a Pilot min CINR). If at least one pilot<br>
signal CINR from among pilot signal CINRs transmitted from the neighbor BSs is<br>
greater than the threshold value, the reception power comparator 920 goes to the<br>
next step. In more detail, it is determined whether at least one pilot signal CINR<br>
from among the neighbor BSs' pilot signal CINRs is greater than a pilot signal<br>
CINR of the serving BS. If it is determined that a neighbor BS having a pilot<br>
signal CINR greater than that of the serving BS is found, information of a<br>
neighbor BS having the pilot signal CINR greater than that of the serving BS is<br>
transmitted to the controller 930. The controller 930 determines whether the SS<br>
transmits its own handover request to the serving BS according to information<br>
received from the reception power comparator 920.<br>
In more detail, if the CINRs of the pilot signals transmitted from the<br>
neighbor BSs are greater than that of the other pilot signal transmitted from the<br>
serving BS, the controller 930 generates a handover request signal of the SS. In<br>
this case, although there is no description in the drawings, it should be noted that<br>
the MAX T and MIN T conditions must be satisfied in the handover request<br>
process. The controller 930 generates a handover request (HO_REQ) message<br>
by controlling the transmitter 940, and transmits the generated handover request<br>
message to the serving BS. The transmitter 940 generates the HO REQ message<br>
upon receiving a control command from the controller 930, and transmits the<br>
HO REQ message to the serving BS.<br>
Fig. 9 has disclosed the SS internal configuration according to the present<br>
invention. Operations of the SS will hereinafter be described with reference to<br>
Fig. 10. Fig. 10 is a flow chart illustrating operations of the SS in accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 10, the<br>
SS reads the DL MAP message received from the serving BS at step 1000, reads<br>
the UL MAP message received from the serving BS at step 1002, and reads the<br>
neighbor BS list information contained in the DL MAP message at step 1004. If<br>
the SS reads the neighbor BSs information at step 1004, it sets an ID "i"<br>
indicative of the number of the neighbor BSs to "0" (i.e., i=0) at step 1004.<br>
The SS adds a number of 1 to a variable "i" (i.e., i = i+1), measures a<br>
CINR of a pilot signal transmitted from the i-th neighbor BS at step 1006, and<br>
goes to step 1008. In this case, it is assumed that the neighbor BSs' number<br>
transmitted from the serving BS is in the range from "BS 1" to<br>
"MAX BS NUM". Therefore, the SS measures a pilot signal CINR for the<br>
neighbor BSs' number "BS_1" at step 1006, and determines whether the number<br>
of the neighbor BS having measured the pilot signal CINR is equal to or greater<br>
than "MAX BS NUM" at step 1008. If it is determined the number of the<br>
measured neighbor BS is equal to or greater than "MAX BS NUM" at step 1008,<br>
the SS goes to step 1010. Otherwise, if it is determined that the number of the<br>
measured neighbor BS is less than "MAX_BS_NUM" at step 1008, the SS returns<br>
to step 1006.<br>
If it is determined that the value of MAX Neighbor BS CINR is equal to<br>
or less than the pilot signal CINR of the serving BS, the SS returns to step 1000.<br>
Otherwise, if it is determined that the value of MAX Neighbor BS CINR is<br>
greater than the pilot signal CINR of the serving BS, the SS determines its own<br>
handover request, and goes to step 1012.<br>
The SS transmits the HO REQ message to the serving BS at step 1012.<br>
The detailed configuration of the HO REQ message has been disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned Table 7. The SS receives the HO RSP message associated with<br>
the HO REQ message from the serving BS at step 1014, and goes to step 1016.<br>
The detailed configuration of the HO RSP message has been disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned Table 10. The SS reads ID and carrier frequency information of<br>
the last target BS from among the HO RSP message at step 1016, and goes to<br>
step 1018. In this case, the last target BS acts as a specific BS to which the SS is<br>
handed over.<br>
The SS converts an SS frequency into a target BS frequency, and goes to<br>
step 1020, such that data transmission/reception between the SS and the serving<br>
BS is interrupted and the SS can communicate with the last target BS. The SS<br>
reads the DL MAP message received from the last target BS at step 1020, and<br>
goes to step 1022. The SS reads the UL MAP message received from the last<br>
target BS, and goes to step 1024. The SS communicates with the last target BS<br>
at step 1024, and terminates its handover operation.<br>
Fig. 10 has disclosed operations of the SS according to the present<br>
invention. Operations of the serving BS will hereinafter be described with<br>
reference to Fig. 11. Fig. 11 is a flow chart illustrating operations of a serving<br>
BS in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
serving BS transmits the DL MAP message to the SS at step 1100, and transmits<br>
the UL MAP message to the SS at step 1102.<br>
The serving BS receives the HO_REQ message from the SS at step 1104,<br>
and goes to step 1106. The detailed configuration of the HO REQ message has<br>
been disclosed in the aforementioned Table 7. The serving BS arranges CINRs<br>
of the pilot signals of the neighbor BSs in other of descending magnitude, and<br>
goes to step 1108. In this case, the CINRs of the pilot signals of the neighbor<br>
BSs are contained in the HO REQ message. As stated above, the neighbor BSs<br>
for commanding the SS to measure the pilot signal CINR act as candidate BSs<br>
which satisfy the MAX T and MIN T conditions, such that each candidate BS<br>
has a signal greater than a Pilot min CINR (i.e., a minimum pilot signal CINR).<br>
As previously stated in Fig. 10, it is assumed that the number of neighbor BSs of<br>
the SS is in the range from BS_1 to MAX_BS_NUM. In addition, the ID "i"<br>
indicative of the number of the neighbor BSs is set to "0" (i.e., i=0) at step 1106.<br>
The ID indicative of the number "i" of the neighbor BSs is determined in the<br>
order of the pilot CINRs.<br>
The serving BS transmits the HO_CONNECTION_REQ message to the<br>
neighbor BS having the greatest pilot CINR from among the arranged neighbor<br>
BSs at step 1108. The detailed configuration of the HO_CONNECTION_REQ<br>
message has been shown in the aforementioned Table 8.<br>
The serving BS receives the HO_CONNECTION_RSP message indicative<br>
of a response to the HO_CONNECTION_REQ message from the neighbor BS<br>
which have transmitted the HO_CONNECTION_REQ message at step 1110, and<br>
goes to step 1112. The detailed configuration of the HO_CONNECTION_RSP<br>
message has been disclosed in the aforementioned Table 9. The serving BS<br>
determines whether there is a neighbor BS capable of supporting a handover<br>
function of the SS in a plurality of neighbor BSs transmitting the SS handover<br>
request signals. In more detail, the serving BS determines whether the ACK<br>
message is contained in the HO_CONNECTION_RSP message. If it is<br>
determined that a specific neighbor BS from among the neighbor BSs can support<br>
the handover service for the SS, the serving BS goes to step 1116. Otherwise, if<br>
it is determined that none of the neighbor BSs is able to support the handover<br>
service for the SS, the serving BS goes to step 1114. The serving BS selects a<br>
neighbor BS with the second greatest pilot CINR from among the neighbor BSs<br>
and increases the variable "i" by one (i.e., i = i + 1) at step 1114, and returns to<br>
step 1108.<br>
The serving BS transmits the HO_RSP message to the SS at step 1116, and<br>
goes to step 1118. The detailed configuration of the HORSP message has been<br>
disclosed in the aforementioned Table 10. The serving BS transmits the<br>
HO_CONNECTION_CFM message to a neighbor BS (i.e., the last target BS)<br>
capable of supporting the handover function at step 1118, and returns to step 1120.<br>
The detailed configuration of the HO CONNECTION CFM message has been<br>
disclosed in the aforementioned Table 11. Needless to say, the serving BS may<br>
first transmit the HO_CONNECTION_CFM message to the last target BS, or may<br>
transmit the HO RSP message to the SS. The serving BS releases the link<br>
connected to the SS at step 1120, and terminates its handover operation.<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present invention enables the<br>
SS based on a multi-cell structure to perform the handover operation, resulting in<br>
a guarantee of the SS's mobility. In more detail, the conventional SS performs a<br>
communication function in a single cell, such that it must cancel the link<br>
connected to a BS currently communicating with the SS when the SS moves to the<br>
other cell. Furthermore, the conventional SS must newly set up a<br>
communication mode with a new BS, such that it must newly perform the initial<br>
ranging process. However, in order to solve the aforementioned problems of the<br>
conventional SS, the present invention performs the handover process without<br>
performing the initial ranging process with the new BS, resulting in reduction of a<br>
data communication interruption time.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been<br>

various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing<br>
