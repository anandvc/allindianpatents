FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to cytotoxic peptide hormone conjugates.<br>
This invention is in the field of the chemistry of targeting anticancer anthracycline derivatives. More particularly, it concerns doxorubicin (DOX) or its daunosamine modified derivatives (DM-DOX) finked covatently to analogs of peptide hormones such as Lh-RH, bombesin and somatostatin. These covalent conjugates!, are^jtargeted to various tumors bearing receptors for the peptide "hormone analogs.<br>
Discussion of the Prior Art<br>
LH-RH Analogs which have cytotoxic moieties at the sixth position are shown tn Schally, Janaky and Bajusz, EP 0 450 461 61, grant publication September 6, 1995.<br>
GnRH(lH-RH) analogs for destroying gonadofrops are described in Nett and Glode, WO 90/09799, published on September 7, 1990. This application describes toxins, tike rtein, linked to analogs of LH-RH for destroying gonadotrophs and thus curing sex hormone dependent cancers. LH-RH doxorubicin derivative is aiso mentioned without specification of the chemistry of linking.<br><br>
Cytotoxic somatostatin analogs are described by Schally et al. in U.S. Pal. application filed on April 6, 199G and refiled in July 15, 1993 under Serial No. 08/076,846<br>
 A review by A. V. Schally in Anti-Cancer Drugs 5, 115-130 (1994) gives details about the presence of receptors on the cell membranes of a wide variety of tumors for analogs of LH-RH, bombesin or somatostatin.<br>
G. Weckbecker lists several references that show the presence of receptors    and receptor subtypes for somatostatin analogs on several normal and tumorous tissues in his review in Farmac. Ther. 60, 245-264 (1993).<br>
Bombesin-like peptides and the presence of bombesin/GRP receptors on various normal and tumorous tissues are discussed in the review by N.     Bunnett in Gut Peptides: Biochemistry and Physiology 423-445 (1994) Ed.: J. Walsh and G. J. Dbckray, Raven Press, New York and by E. Spindell in Recent Progress in Hormone Research 48, (1993) (Academic Press)<br>
Doxorubicin (DOX) is, at this time, the most widely used, and very potent   anticancer agent. However, certain tumors do not respond to it at alt and its use is also limited by multidrug resistance (MDR) and cardiotoxicity as well as neutropenia, which are the results of chronic treatment. In order to overcome these drawbacks and to further exploit the enormous tumoricida! potential inherent in the structure of anthracycline antibiotics, thousands of  synthetic derivatives have been described, including their targeted analogs linked to various carrier macromolecules.<br>
Most of the history of DOX and its analogs is described in "Adriamycin", David W. Henry, ACS Symposium Series, No. 30, Cancer Chemotherapy,  American Chemical Society, pp. 15-57 (1976) and in the book Doxorubicin. Federico Arcamone, Academic Press, (1981).<br><br>

Highly active, alkylating, non-cross resistant 3'-deamino-3'-(3"-cyano-4"-morpholinyO-DOX and derivatives thereof which have antitumor activity are described in Mosher, et al., U.S. Pat. 4,464,529, August 7, 1984. The   synthesis and biological evaluation of these "Intensely Potent Morpholinyl Anthracyclines" are also described in J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 638-645.<br>
In Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 88, pp. 4845-4849, June 199). Gao et al. describe formaldehyde-mediated alkylation of a DNA sequence by a   daunorubicin derivative.<br>
Ari'thracycline analogues bearing latent alkylating substituents are described in J. Med. Chem. 35, 3208-3214 (1992).<br>
  The use of an d.oi-diiodo compound for the alkylation of the daunosamine, nrtrogen of DOX and thus the formation of a new morpholinyl DOX derivative is described in European Patent EP 434 960, filed by Pharmacia Carlo Erba on December 12, 1989.<br>
  N-Trifluoroacetyladriamycin14-0-hemiglutarate and -hemiadipate are disclosed as analogs of N-trifluoroacetyladriamicyn14-0-valerate (AD-32) with improved water solubility in Israel, et al., U.S. Patent 4,299,822, November. 10, 1981.<br>
   Horton and Priebe (J. Antibiotics, XXXVI, 1211-1215.) describe several 14-O-esters of different anthracycline analogs with no dramatic changes in anticancer activity as compared to the 14-OH parent analogs.<br>
In the art of designing targeted chemotherapeutic agents, the following  objectives are sought:<br><br>
4<br>
1.	Stable linkage between the carrier molecule and the chemo therapeutic agent until the target is reached,<br>
2.	Retained biological characteristics of the carrier molecule within the conjugate, such as retained binding properties.<br>
  3.        Retained pharmacological activity of the chemotherapeutic agent within the conjugate, such as retained cytotoxic activity. 4.        As a result of conjugation, the production of analogs of more intense activity and/or lower peripheral toxicity relative to the unconjugated moieties.<br>
  Conjugation of DOX by Nal04 oxidation of the daunosamine moiety of DOX followed by reductive alkylation involving a primary amine of a carrier molecule is described in Seta, et at., U.S. Patent 4,263,279, April 21, 198.1,<br>
A cis-acbnttic acid spacer was used to link the daunosamine nitrogen to   macromolecular carriers with a pH-sensitive bond, as described in Biocherni Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981 102, 1048-1054.<br>
The formation of ester bonds and C-N linkages between 14-bromodauhorubicin and proteins or poty-L-amino acids is described by  Zunino et.al. (1981) Tumori 67, 521-524 and (1984) Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 20, 421-425.<br>
MorphoIino-DOX (a highly active, daunosamine modified analog of DOX) was conjugated to antibody via a hydrolyzable (lysosomotrop, pH sensitive)   hydrazone linkage, involving the C-13 oxo function of the cytotoxic agent, as described in Bioconjugate Chemistry 1990 1(5), 325-330<br>
Sensitivity of the carboxamide bond of a leucine residue to enzymatic degradation was used successfully in conjugates of DOX containing a  "spacer arm" peptide, preferentially Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu, where the carboxy terminal Leu acylates the daunosamine nitrogen in DOX and the amino<br><br>
5<br>
terminal Ala is linked to the carrier through dicarboxylic acid spacer as described in Proc. Natf. Acad. Sci USA 1982 79, 626-629.<br>
The daunosamine nitrogen of DOX was acylated by a glutaric acid spacer   and linked to LH-RH analogs with a severe loss of cytotoxic activity as described in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992 89, 972-976.<br>

	Summary of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the invention are novel, targeted cytotoxic peptide hormones comprising an anthracycline cytotoxic agent, such as DOX or DM-DOX, conjugated to a peptide hormone, such as analogs of LH-RH,<br>
  bombesin, and somatostatin. These cytotoxic peptide hormone conjugates are designed for the treatment of tumors bearing specific receptorsToT the conjugate, such as breast cancer, ovarian, cancer, endometfiaTcancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer. Certain of these (unconjugated) anthracycline cytotoxic agents<br>
 utilized herein are per se novel, and are highly potent, their level of toxicity however is too high for them to be used in unconjugated form.<br><br>
-7-<br>
Daunosamine modified DOX analogs presented in this invention were developed during a search for new, highly active, non-cross resistant analogs of DOX suitable for the formation of covalent conjugates with peptide carriers.<br>
The formation of stable, covalently jinked conjugates with fully retained biological activities of their components was achieved by using a dicarboxylic acid spacer, like glutaric acid. One carboxyl group of the spacer forms an ester bond with the 14-OH group of DOX or DM-OOX and the other carboxyl group of tfie spacer forms a carboxmide bond with a well chosen free amino group of the peptide carrier.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a cytotoxic peptide hormone conjugates of the formula<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein Q has the detailed chemical structure:<br><br>
where<br><br>
-8-<br>
R is a single bond or -C(0)-(CH2)n-C(0)- and n = 0-7,<br>
Rf is NH2 or an aromatic, saturated or partially saturated 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic compounds having at least one ring nitrogen and optionally having a butadiene moiety bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of said ring to form a bicydie system,<br>
P is H or a peptide moiety, suitably an LHRH, somatostatin bombesin analog, but<br>
not excluding other physiologically active peptides. Particularly desirble are those<br>
LHRH analogs having affinity for neoplastic cell receptors, expecially those<br>
analogs having a D-Lys moiety at the 6 position, as well as shortened<br>
somatostatin and bombesin analogs. Nevertheless where R' is NH2 then R-P is<br>
other than H. When R-P is H, then R' is other than NH2.<br>
A novel synthetic reaction has been discovered in the course of this work.<br>
Not only was it found that doxorubicin and its derivatives can be coupled via a<br>
dicarboxylic moiety at the 14 position to yield novel pharmacologically effective<br>
conjugates but a novel way was provided to form partially saturated heterocyclic<br>
moieties from vicinal and disjunct i.e,Cr:.p- or CF/y-hydroxy primary amines. The<br>
particular application in the present invention was the formation of 2*-pyrrolinyl<br>
and l"3*-tetrahydropyridinyl moieties on the daunosamine sugar. However, this<br>
reaction has broader applicability. 5 and 6 membered partially saturated<br>
heterocyclic moieties may be formed when a vicinal or disjunct hydroxy amine is<br>
reacted with a halo-substituted aldehyde having 2 or 3 moieties between the<br>
aldehyde carbon and the carbon atoms having the halo group. These moieties<br>
may all be methylene, or a hetero atom such as oxygen may be involved. The<br>
reaction takes place in three stages. A very large excess of the haioaldehyde is<br>
reacted with the acid salt of the hydroxy amine, suitably in a polar inert<br>
anhydrous organic solvent. There is thus formed a five membered oxsxolidine<br>
ring (or a six-membered 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring) by condensation of the<br>
aldehyde group with the hydroxy! and the amine groups. This product is treated<br>
with an organic base,   	-. -..	<br><br>
s<br>
suitably a tertiary amine, whereby (he elements of hydro-halic acid are eliminated between the halo moiety of the former halo aldehyde and the secondary amino group of the oxazolidine or 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring to form a fused ring structure by the addition of a 5 or 6 membered ring The<br>
  base is then neutralized with a weak acid suitably an organic acid such as glacial acetic acid. Treatment with aqueous acid, suitably an organic acid opens the oxazolidine or 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine portion of the fused ring. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that depending on {he starting aldehyde, the final nitrogen containg ring may contain at least one additional<br>
 hetero atom as mentioned above. The general reaction may be illustrated as follows:<br><br><br>
(III)<br>
(large Excess) in Solvent, anhydrous aprotic solvent <br><br><br>
(IV)<br>
Base (tertiary anhydrous amine) <br><br><br><br>
10<br><br>
10<br>
Wherein X' is halo, suitably bromo or iodo, preferably iodo, Y is CH2, OCH2l CH2-CH2, 2 is nil or CH2<br>
  When 21s nil, the aldehyde moiety forms a 5-membered oxazolidine ring as the first'step of the reaction. When 2 is CH2, the aldehyde moiety forms a 6-membered'1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring. While such ring formations are well known, in combination with the ring closure effected by the haloalkane side chain in a basic medium such as a tertiary amine in an anhydrous medium,<br>
 the reaction is new and surprising.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The;moiety Q, when substituted at R' by certain preferred groups, has  submoiety designations of Q, through Q8l of which Q2 through Q8 are novel cytotoxic moieties.<br>
R' has the preferred values, leading to the desired Qx moieties listed in parentheses as follows: NH2 (Qi), pyrrolidine-1-yl (Q2), isoindoline-2-yl (Q3),   3-pyrroline-1-yl (Q4), 3-pyrrolidone-1-yl (Qs), 2-pyrroline-1-yl (Q6), 3-piperidone-1-yl (Q7), or 1,3-tetrahydropyridine-1-yl(Qa).<br>
Thus if R-P is H and -R' is -NH2, Qi is DOX, if R-P is H and -R' is pyrrolidine-<br>
1-yl, Q2 is 3'-deamino-3'-(pyrrolidine-1"-yl)-doxorubicin (Q2); if R-P is H and -<br>
 R* is isoindotine-2-yi, Q3 is S'-deamino-SXisoindoiine-Z'-yO-doxorubicin (Q3);<br>
if R-P is H and -R' is 3-pyrroline-1-yl. Q
 <br>
-12-doxorub/rin (Q*); if R-P is H and -R' is 3-pyrrolidone-l-yl, Q5 is 3'-deamino-3'-(S'pyrrolidone-l'-ylJ-doxorubicin (Q5; if R-P is H and R'is 2-pyrroline-i-yi, Q6 is 3,-deamino-3'-(2"-pyrroline-lff-yl)-doxorubicin (Q6); if R-P is H and -R' is 3-piperidone-1-yl, Q7 is r'<teamino-3 r-p is h and r q8></teamino-3>
The compounds incorporating the daunosamine nitrogen in a five membered ring with alkylating function are 10-50 times more active in vitro than their homolog counterparts,incorporating the daunosamine nitrogen in a six membered ring. (Such pairs are Q5 and Q7 as well as Q6 and Q$).<br>
In the present embodiments of the present invention, in the substance of formula QM-O-R-P, R-P is other than hydrogen. Where P is other than hydrogen, that is whwQ it is PA, P2 and P3, suitab}y where Pi is an LH-RH agonist carrier, an LH-RH antagonist carrier or a shortened LH-RH analog carrier, P2 is a shortened somafcostain analog and P3 is a bombesin antagonist.<br>
Suitably, Pi is Aaa-Bbb-Cee-Ser-Tyr-D-Lys (Xxx)-Leu-Arg-Pro-Ddd, wherein (Xxx) is hydrogen or a diamino substituted such as A2Bu or A2Pr wherein where: Aaa is Glp, then Bbb is His, Ccc is Trp, and Odd is G!y-NH2, Aaa is Ac-D-Nal(2),Ac-D-Phe or AcD-Phe(4Cl), then Bbb is D-Phe(4Cl) or D-Phe, Ccc is D-Pal(3) and D-Trp and Odd is D-Ala—NH2; andf where Aaa-Bbb-Ccc is Ac, then Ddd is -NH-CH2~CH3;<br>
P2 is Aaa-Cys-Bbb-D-Trp-Lys-Cec-Cys-Ddd-NH2<br>
wherein:<br>
where Aaa is D-Phe, then Bbb is Tyr, Ccc is Val and Ddd is Thr or Trp; and<br><br>
13<br>
where Aaa is D-Trp, then Bbb is Phe, and Ccc and Ddd are Thr; and<br>
P3 is Aaa-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-G!y-His-Leu Bbb-NH2<br>

In the novel process of forming a partially saturated heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen of a vicinal or disjunct i.e., a,|3~ or a,y-hydroxy amine the first step of the reaction is carried out in an anhydrous inert organic polar non-hydroxylic  (aprotic) solvent, suitably dimethyl formamide using substantial excess, suitably a 30 fold excess of the halo aldehyde, 4-iodobutyraldehyde and 5-iodovaleraldehyde are especially effective, The Invention is not limited to these however, bromo may be used in place of iodo. This reaction as well as the subsequent steps may be carried out at ambient temperature.<br>
The basification step is carried out with an excess, suitably a 2-4 fold excess of an organic base. Tertiary amines such as trialkylamines are suitable for this purpose.<br>
 The thus formed bicyclic ring is opened to release the vicinal or disjunct hydroxy! group by treatment with an organic acid in the presence of water. Dilute aqueous trifuoracetic acid, suitably in an inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile may be used. The product is purified by removal ofthe volatiles under reduced pressure, excess halo compound extracted with hexane. and<br>
  the residue purified on HPLC.<br>

Synthesis of peptide carriers<br>
The peptides of the invention are often administered in the form of    pharmaceutical acceptable, nontoxic salts, such as acid additional salts. Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, fumarate, glyconate, (annate, maleate, acetate, tri-fluoroacetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, alginate, pamoate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate, and the like.  If the active ingredient is to be administered   in tablet form, the tablet may contain a pharmaceutical^ acceptable diluent whicn includes a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin, a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate.<br>
 If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and/or flavoring may be used as part of the pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, an intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected,<br>
  The pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Usually, the dosage will be from about 1 to about 100 micrograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host when given intravenously; oral dosages will be much higher. Overall, treatment of subjects with these<br>
   peptides is generally carried out in the same manner as the clinical treatment using other analogs of LHRH, somatostatin and analogs of doxorubicin.<br>
These peptides can be administered to mammals intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, orally, intranasally or intravaginally to   achieve biological hormonal effects through binding to specific receptors.  In the case of LHRH analogs, these effects may include reversible suppression<br><br>
19<br>
of gonadal activity, and in (he case of somatostatin analogs inhibition of gastrointentinal function.   Effective dosages will vary with the form of administration and the particular species of mammal being treated   An example of one typical dosage form is a physiological saline solution   containing the peptide which solution is administered to provide a dose in the range of about 0.1 to 2 5 mg/kg of body weight. Oral administration of the peptide may be given in either solid form or liquid form<br>

Determination of in vitro cytotoxic activity<br>
MXTestrogen-independent mouse mammary carcinoma cell line was  obtained from Dr. Gunter Berndhardt, University of Regensburg, Germany. All the other cell lines used in the determination of the antiproliferative activity'of the compounds of this invention were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).<br>
 For the evaluation of the activity of the analogs, a colorimetric cytotoxicity assay in microtitration plates was used based on quantification of biomass by staining cells with crystal violet, which correlates very well with determination of cell numbers. (Reileeta!.; Anal. Biochem. 187, 262-267, 1990; Bernhardt G. et al, J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. (1992), 118, 35-43; Spruss Th. et al, J<br>

Assay Protocol<br>
 One to two days after seeding cells in 96-well plates the culture medium is exchanged with fresh medium containing the compounds to be tested and<br><br>
31<br>
fresh medium only for the control cultures. After varying time of incubation, cells are fixed with glutaric dialdehyde and stored under fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 4oC until the end of the experiment. Cells are stained with crystal violet and bound stain is extracted with 70% aqueous EtOH   Optical denstiy<br>
  is measured with EIA Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) or Biomek 1000 (Beckman) at 590 nm or 600 nm, respectively.  Each data point represents the mean value of eight culture wells. T/C values are calculated as T/C= (T-C0)/(C-C0) where T= optical density of treated cultures, C= optical density of control (untreated) cultures, C0= optical density of cultures at the start of<br>
 incubation (t=0).<br>

the crystal violet staining method and was expressed as T/C vaiues where T/C=(T-Cc/C-Co) x 100 [T= absorbance of treated cultures, O absorbance c-control cultures, C0= absorbance of cultures at the start of incubation (t=0). The measured absorbance is proportionate to the cell number]   Lower T/C values indicate a decrease in the survival of cancerous cells due to treatment. That is to say, 75 would indicate 75% survival of cells as compared to 100% for control or 25% inhibition.<br>

Treatment with 2-pyrrotino-DOX (Q6), cytotoxic LH-RH agonist analog Q614gL ([D-Lys6]LH-RH linked to Q614-0-hemiglutarate) and (DOX) on estrogen    independent MXT mouse mammary cancers (KS-49)<br>
In order to compare the tumor inhibitory activity of cytotoxic doxorubicin derivative! Q6 and its targeted cytotoxic peptide conjugate, Q614gl- as well as the well known antineoplastic agent, DOX and to determine the optimal way<br>
 of administration and the nontoxic doses, LH-RH receptor positive MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mm3) were implanted s. c. in female BQD2F1 mice. One day after-transplantation the mice were randomly divided intogrpups of five animals and the treatment started. The compounds were dissolved in 0:1 % -(flcioroacetie'acid (pH 2) and given intraperitoneal^. Groups, treatment<br>
 schedules and doses as well as average survival times are shown in Table 24-1  Results are summarized in Table 24-2 and Figure 1.<br>
Table 24-2 shows the effect of treatment with Q6 and cytotoxic LH-RH analog Q614gL on tumor volumes and survival of mice with estrogen-independent<br>
 breast cancers. As is shown in Table 24-2, 1.25 nmol Q6 administered on day 1, 2, 7,8,14 and 15, (Group 2) exerted strong toxicity characterized with an average survival of 17.4 days, which is significantly shorter than that of the untreated control group.  In comparison, the same dosage of G614gL (Group 6) resulted in an average survival of 30.8 days, which is significantly longer<br>
  than that of the untreated control group. Higher efficacy of Q6MgL over Q6 can also be demonstrated by comparing the average final tumor volumes in Group 2 (1065 mm3 at day 16) and in Group 6 (863 mm3 at day 31).<br>
Similar conclusions can be demonstrated by comparing Q6 and Q614gL in a   different treatment schedule where 0.5 nmol of the drugs were administered five days a week for three consecutive weeks.<br><br>
43<br>
Doxorubicin at a toxic dose (total amount: 1560 nmol, average survival: 20 days) could not eradicate the tumor, while treatment with Q614gL at nontoxic dose (total amount: 7 nmol, average survival: &gt;31 days) led to the survival of 2 out of 5 animals, without development of the tumor.<br>

The assays were run as follows:<br>
In order to determine the maximum tolerated doses and compare the effeqts,<br>
MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mrr&gt;3) were implanted s.c in female 86D2F1<br>
 mice. One day after transplantation the mice were randomly divided into groups of five animals and they were treated with a single injection i.p. The groups and doses are shown in the Table 25-1. The table also shows the numbers of mice that had tumors when volume was measured and the average survival times for groups. Tumor volume changes are .shown in<br>
 Figure 2. The compounds were dissolved in 0.1% TFA (pH: 2.0). Tumor volume was measured on days 10, 13, 17, and 20.<br>
As shown in Table 25-1 and Figure 2, T-107, ([D-Lys6]LH-RH linked to N-glutaryl-DOX) is completely ineffective in inhibiting the growth of this turner at  a dose of 850 nmo!/20 g mouse. In contrast, Qi,4gL, ([D-Lys6]LH-RH linkec to 14-O-glutaryl-DOX) exerted strong suppression of tumor growth (Figure) ai a nontoxic dose of 650 nmol/20 g mouse.  DOX alone was highly toxic (average survival time: 13.6 days) at a single dose of 650 nmol/20 g mcuse and signrficantly less effective, than Qi14gL (Figure 2)<br><br>

Effect of cytotoxic LH-RH analogs on estrogen independent MXT mouse mammary cancers (KS-47)<br><br>
Substances used for treatment<br>
In an earlier experiment, Q2 at 20 nmol daily dose for 17 days had only a moderate inhibitory effect on tumor growth, and it was toxic at 4D nmol dose (mean survival was 14.6 days). A daily dose of 30 nmol was chosen for the  present experiment, which compared the efficacy and toxicity of Q214gL <q2 coupled to q2 and></q2>
MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mm3) were transplanted in female B6D2F1  mice. The treatment started one day after transplantation and was continued for 12 days by i.p. injections once a day. All groups received equimolar amounts fbY'thecompounds as shown in Table 26-1. Tumors were measured on days i0, 14 and 18, and tumor votume was calculated. The data are shown in Table 26-1 and in Figure 3.<br><br>
Treatment with a daily dose of 30 nmol of daunosamine modified doxorubicin analog Q2 (pyrrolidino-DOX) resulted in strong inhibitory effect on tumor growth (tumor volume: 144 mm3 at day 14 vs. 1391 mm3 for the control group), but exerted severe toxicity killing all the animals before the end of the<br>
  experiment (mean survival 17.9 days). Similarly, Q2 combined (mixture) with [D-Lys^LH-RH resulted in strong tumor inhibitory effect (tumor volume: 80 mm3 at day 14) but the mean survival (18.5 days) was significantly shorter than that of the untreated control group (23.1 days). As a result of the treatment with Q214gL, (Q2 covalently linked to [D-Lys6]LH-RH) two animals<br>
 died, one at day 16 and another at day 26. From the 8 surviving animals only one developed tumors at the last measurement at day 18 and they all looked<br><br>
48<br>
healthy, but later on all of them started to develop the tumors The mean survival for this group was significantly longer (28.3 days), than that of the control group. Treatment with [D-Lys6]LH-RH aione did not affect tumor growth.<br>
This experiment demonstrates that the higher efficacy and the lower peripheral toxicity of Q214gL over the cytotoxic radical Q2 is attributable to the covalent conjugation of the cytotoxic radical to the targeting carrier LH-RH analog.<br>

EXAMPLE 27<br>
Effects of 2-pyrrolino-DOX (Q6) and cytotoxic LH-RH agonist analog Q614gL   ([D-Lys6]LH-RH linked to Q614-0-hemiglutarate) on the growth of androgen dependent rat Dunning R-3327-H prostate carcinomas<br>
Male Copenhagen rats bearing hormone-dependent Dunning R-3327-H prostate carcinomas were treated with Qe14gL, a new cytotoxic analog of<br>
 luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) consisting of the agonist fD-Lys6]LH-RH linked to 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin. In the first experiment, 2-pyrroiihodoxorubicin was administered at a concentration of 50 nmol/kg. "as a single drug:(Q6) and as an unconjugated mixture with [D-Lys6]LH-RH or Conjugated to the carrier [D-Lys6]LH-RH (Q614gL). Following the second<br>
 administration of 50 nmol/kg of radical Q6 alone or mixed with [D-Lys^LH-RH,  all rats died with signs of general toxicity, whereas all animals, treated with the cytotoxic LH-RH conjugate Q614gL, survived. After 5 weeks of treatment with a total dose of 150 nmol/kg G614gL, the tumors regressed from an originalvolume of 8.35 ±1.7 cm3 at the beginning of the experiment to 4.47 ±<br>
 0.8 cm3, while tumors in the control group continued to grow and measured 17.84 ± 2.2 cm3. The therapy with G614gL also significantly reduced tumor weight and tumor burden. In the second experiment, designed for comparing the efficacy and toxicity of Q6 and Q614gL the therapeutic regimen consisted of 3 applications of 25 nmol/kg Q6 or 25 nmol/kg and 50 nmol/kg Q614gL.<br>
 When the treatment was started, tumor volume in all groups was between 3.9 and 4.5 cm3. After 5 weeks of therapy, the tumors in rats treated with 50 nmol/kg Q614gL regressed to 2.3 ±0.51 cm3, whereas 25 nmol/kg Q6 was still toxic and could only produce a reduction in final tumor volume to 6.76 ± 1.4 cm3, similar to that obtained with 25 nmol/kg Q614gL (6.74 ± 1 cm3), as<br>
  compared to 15.6 ± 2.2 cm3 for untreated animals. Histological evaluation of the specimens showed a significant decrease of mitotic cells in the Q; ~cL<br><br>
50<br>
treated groups only. LH-RH receptors with high binding capacity were detected in the membranes of untreated Dunning tumor specimens, but after treatment with Q6,4gL, no binding sites for LH-RH coutd be found. Inhibition of tumor growth by AN-201 and Q614gL was also associated with a significant<br>
 decrease in binding capacity of EGF receptors. As is demonstrated by Figures 4-6, targeted cytotoxic LH-RH analog Q614gL is an effective antitumor agent causing regression of rat Dunning R-3327-H prostate carcinomas. Our studies also show that the cytotoxic LH-RH analog GV4gL is mdch less toxic than the antineoplastic radical (Q6) incorporated, and significantly more<br>
 active in inhibiting tumor growth<br>

EXAMPLE 28<br>
 Comparative study on the effects of doxorubicin (DOX) and targeted<br>
cytotoxic LH-RH agonist analog Q,14gL ([D-Lys^LH-RH finked to D0X14-O-hemiglutarate) oh the growth of OV-1063 human* ovarian carcinoma in nude mice<br>
  Human epithelial oyarian cancer cell line OV-1063 originated from a<br>
metastatic papillan/'cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary of a 57-year old womarj ( Horowitz et.al. (1985) Oncology 42, 332-337). Ten million cells of OV-1063 were injected subcutaneously into three nude mice to grow tumors Pieces of 1 mm3 of these tumors were transplanted into sixty animals for in vivo growth<br>
  inhibition studies. The aim of the experiment was to demonstrate that, as a result of the presence of receptors for LH-RH on OV-1063, the cytotoxic conjugate of LH-RH was more effective and less toxic, than DOX, the cytotoxic radical it contained. Thus, the effects of cytotoxic LH-RH conjugate was compared to those of DOX, the mixture of DOX with the carrier molecule,<br>
  the carrier alone and the untreated control groups. All injections were administered intra peritoneally The compounds were dissolved in 0.9 % sodium chloride in water (saline).<br>
Mice with an average tumor size of about 15 mm3 were divided into six   groups of nine animals and received the following treatment seven days after tumor transplantation: group 1, saline; group 2. Qi14gL at a dose of 700<br><br>
52<br>
nmol/20g animal; group 3, Q^gL at a dose of 413 nmol/20g animal (maximum tolerated dose, MTD for DOX); group 4, DOX at 413 nmoi/20g animal (MTD); group 5, mixture of 700 nmol/20g of DOX and 700 nmol/20g of [D-Lys6]LH-RH; group 6, carrier agonist analog [D-Lys6]LH-RH at a dose of   700 nmol/20g animal.<br>
Receptor analysis of OV-1063 showed the presence of high affinity binding sites for LH-RH.<br>
  Results: as shown on Fig. 7, strong inhibition of tumor growth was achieved by treatment with Q,14gL at 413nmol/20g dose (group 3). The animals did not show'signs of severe toxicity In comparison, treatment with DOX. administered at the same dose of 413 nmol/20g (12 mg/kg, MTD, group 4) did riot result in significant inhibition of tumor growth in the three animals<br>
  surviving at the end of the expriment. Three animals died by dav five .and six animsrts were dead by day nine due to toxicity. At a higher dose, (7.00 nmo(/20g, group 2), Qi14gL showed very strong inhibition of tumor growth (Fig. 7). Two out of nine animals died due to toxicity and one animal died accidentaly. The six surviving animals were recovering from a weight loss of<br>
  about 20%at the end of the experiment. In group 6, the same high dose (700 nmol/20g) DOX was mixed with 700 nmol of [D-Lys6]LH-RH. By day 5, all animals died in this group as a result of severe toxicity. Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that due to the presence of receptors for LH-RH on the cells of epithelial ovarian cancer OV-1063,<br>
   targeted cytotoxic LH-RH conjugate Qi14gL shows lower toxicity and higher antitumoral activity than doxorubicin (Q,), the cytotoxic radical it contains.<br><br>
