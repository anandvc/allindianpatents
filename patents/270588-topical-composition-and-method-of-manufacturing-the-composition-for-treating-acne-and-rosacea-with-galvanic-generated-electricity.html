DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is believed that, one skilled in the art can, based<br>
upon the description herein, utilize the present invention<br>
to its fullest extent . The following specific embodiments<br>
are to be construed as metely illustrative, and; not<br>
limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way<br>
whatsoever.<br>

by weight (i.e. (W/W)<br>
What is meant by a "product" is a product containing<br>
the device in finished packaged form. In one embodiment,<br>
the product contains instruct ions directing the user to<br>
apply the device to the barrier membrane [e.g., to treat a<br>
akin condition) . Such instructions may be printed put the<br>
device, label insert, or on any additional packaging.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention features<br>
promoting a device of the present invention for its<br>
intended. use What is meant by "promoting" is promoting,<br>
advertising or marketing. Examples of promoting include,<br>
but are not limited to, written, visual, or verbal<br>
statements made on the product or in stores, magazines,<br>
newspaper, radio, television, internet, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically-acceptable" means<br>
that the ingredients which the terra describes are suitable<br>
for use in contact with the barrier membrane (e.g., the<br>
6<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
skin or mucosa) without undue toxicity, incompatibility,<br>
instability, irtitation, allergic- response, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "safe and effective amount" meanc an<br>
amount of the ingredient or of the composition sufficient<br>
to provide nhe desired benefit at a desired level, but low<br>
enough to avoid serious side effects. The safe and<br>
effective amount of the ingredient or composition will<br>
vary with the area being treated, the age and skin type of<br>
the end user, the duration and nature of the treatment,<br>
the specific ingredient or composition employed, the<br>
particular pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier utilized,<br>
ana like lactors.<br>
As used herein. The term "treatment" means the<br>
treatment (e.g., alleviation or elimination of symptoms<br>
and/or cure) and/or prevention or inhibition of the<br>
condition (e.g., a skin condition} . What is meant by a<br>
"skin condition" is a derntatological disease or disorder<br>
Concluding, but not limited, acne, rosaces, or skin<br>
infections} or skin characteristic [including, but not<br>
limited to, pigmentation, hair growth regulation, skin<br>
teixture, skin tirtmess, skin elasticity, akin vasculature,<br>
dark circles, cellulite, sebum regulation, and skin<br>
shine) . Examples of skin infections include, but are not<br>
limited to, those due to susceptible pathogens such, as<br>
acne, rosaces, impetigo, folliculitia, funmculosis,<br>
ecthyma, eczema, psoriasis, atopia dermatitis, harper,<br>
epldermolysis bulloss, icthyosie, and infected traumatic<br>
lesions (e.g., ulcers, minor burns, truts, airafiiona,<br>
lacerations, wounds, biopsy sites, surgical incisions and<br>
insect bites).<br>
The present invention relates to a device for the<br>
delivery of electricity (e.g., to induce a desirable<br>
7<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
biological response) and/or an active agenx into a barrier<br>
membrane. In one embodiment, the device of the present<br>
indention is a self-contained device containing at least a<br>
pair of two dissimilar conductive electrodes in electric<br>
communication as a power source. By "electric<br>
communication" is meant that electrons can directly pass<br>
between the clements of the device (e.g., between the<br>
conductive electrode of the device). In one embodiment,<br>
the two conductive electrodes are in electric<br>
communication via direct contact with each other.<br>
By "ionic communication" it meant that electrons can<br>
pass between the elements (e.g., the conductive electrode,<br>
the carrier and/or the conductive electrode and the skin)<br>
through the migration of ions as "electron inovers" in<br>
contact with such elements (e.g., electrons pass between<br>
the conductive electrode and the akin via ionic transport<br>
of electrolytes (e.g., in the carrier) in contact with the<br>
cobductive elect.rode and the akin).<br>
In one embodiment, the two conductive electrodes are<br>
in ionic communication with the carrier containing an<br>
elsctrolyte (e.g., ions of one or more electrolytes in the<br>
carrier are in contact with the conductive electrode) and<br>
the carrier is in ionic communication with the skin. This<br>
electrode configuration differs from those in conventional<br>
iontophoresis devices in which each conductive electrode<br>
is in contact with a separate carrier (e.g., each<br>
electrodc is contained in a separate compartment and<br>
affixed to the skin with electric insulation between them<br>
in order that all the electric current travels through the<br>
skin to complete the electric circuit). An advantage of<br>
such an embodiment of the present invention, includes the<br>
capability of delivering simultaneously active agents of<br>
8<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
opposite charges from the same carrier into substantially<br>
the same skin site under the conductive electrodes.<br>
Another advantage is that the devices of the present<br>
invention are much easier to manufacture than conventional<br>
iontophoreais devices, and therefore, are enable<br>
substantial cost-savings.<br>
The device contains a. barrier membrane contacting<br>
surface (e.g., a skin contacting surface) that is applied,<br>
to the membrane {e.g., applied by the user to the user's<br>
skin) . Ths device ia arranged such that carrier is in<br>
communication with the barrier membrane contacting surface<br>
{e.g., such that electricity and/or the active agent may<br>
be administered from the carrier into the barrier<br>
membrane). In one embodiment, the carrier is the barrier<br>
membrane contacting surface (e.g., the carrier is a<br>
hydrogel) . In one embodiment, the device contains a light<br>
etritting diode such that light from the light emitting<br>
diode is in communication with the barrier membrane<br>
contacting surface {e.g., such that the light may be<br>
administered to the barrier membrane .<br>
In one embodiment, the device of the present<br>
invention delivers an active agent into the barrier<br>
membrane. The active agents to be delivered by the device<br>
of the present invention include active agents either<br>
initially incorporated in the carrier or electirochemically<br>
generated by the elect tic current passing from a<br>
conductive electrode through the carrier during use. What<br>
is meant by "electrochemically generated" is that the<br>
chemical specie is created as a result of an<br>
e lectrochemical reaction resulting from electric current<br>
flowing through an electrode, such a chemica1 specie<br>
released from a reactive electrode (e.g., an<br>
9<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
electrochemically generated zinc ion) , a chemical specie<br>
electrochemically generated on the surface of an inert<br>
electrode, or a chemical specie that is a subsequent<br>
reaction product of such eletrochemically generabed<br>
spiscie.<br>
Galvanic Couple<br>
The device/composition of the present invention has<br>
a galvanic couple as its power source, wherein the<br>
electrons that pass between the first conductive electrode<br>
and the second conductive electrode are generated as a<br>
result of the difference of the standard potentials<br>
between the electrodes (e.g., the ele-ctriclty is not<br>
generated by an external battery or other power source<br>
such as an AC power source}. Examples of such galvanic<br>
couples include, but are not limited to, zinc-copper,<br>
zinc-copoer/copcer halide, zinc-copper/copper oxide,<br>
magnesium- copper, magnesium-copper/copper ha.lide, zinc-<br>

whih serve to make up the galvanic couple may also serve<br>
as the conductive electrodes of the device,e.g.zinc as<br>
the conductive anode and silver/silver chloride as the<br>
conductive cathode or zinc as the conductive anode and<br>
copper as the conductive cathode. The metals serve as the<br>
galvanic couple and conductive electrodes may also be<br>
allays. Non-limiting examples of the alloys include alloys<br>
of zinc, copper, a1uminum, magnesium as anode materials,<br>
and alloys of silver, copper, gold as cathode materials.<br>
In one embodiment, the materials that make up the<br>
galvanic couple have a standard potential difference equal<br>
to or greater than about 0.1 volts, such as gireater than<br>
about 0.2 voltg such as greater than about 0.5 volts. In<br>
one embodiment, the materials that make up the galvanic<br>
couple have a standard potential difference equal to or<br>
less than about 3 volts.<br>
In one embodiment, the device or composition of the<br>
present invention generates and/or is capable of<br>
generating current into the barrier membrane of from about<br>
1 nano-A/cm2 to about 4OO micro-A/cm2 of electricity such<br>
as from about 100 A./cm2 to about 50 micro A/cm2 .<br>
In one embodiment, one of the conductive electrodes<br>
is in the form of a metal sheet, a metal wire, or a metal<br>
11<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
coated on a aubscrate, and the other conduceive electrode<br>
is attached or deposited to the first conductive<br>
electrode. In a further embodiment, the metal sheet is<br>
perforated. In one embodiment, such perroraced metal<br>

magnesium, aluminum, copper, or their alloys thereof. In<br>
one embodiment, the second conductive electsrode is in the<br>
form a fabric coated with a metal, and its oxide, halide,<br>
and sulfide, such as a fabric coated with silver,<br>
silver/silver oxide, silver/silver halide, zinc,<br>
magnesium, copper, copper/copper halide, copper/copper<br>
oxide. In another embodiment, the second conductive<br>
electrode is deposited to the first conductive electrode<br>
by chemical or electrochemical deposition such as<br>
electrodes plating for chemical deposition and<br>

the art, In a further embodiment, the second conductive<br>
electrode is deposited to the first conductive electrode<br>
by physical deposition, such as spray coating, plasma<br>
coating, conductive ink coating, screen printing dip<br>
coating or vacuum deposition.<br>
In one embodiment, the device is a single compartment<br>
treatment device. What is meant by a "single compartment<br>
treatment device" is a device in which both conductive<br>
electrodes of the device; are in contact with the same<br>
carrier, Examples of; such devices are shown in Figures 1-<br>

Electrodes<br>
The conductive electrodes of the present invention<br>
may be a reactive conductive electrodes or inert<br>
18<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
conductive electrodes. What is meant by a "reactive<br>
conductive electrode" is that the conductive electrode<br>
itself goes through a change in its chemical composition<br>
during the electrode chemical reactions occurring with the<br>
electric current passing through the electrode during the<br>
process, In one embodiment, the reactive conductive<br>
electrade is an anode made of reaqtivs materials such as a<br>
pure metal or a metal alloy including, but not limited to,<br>
zinc, aluminum, copper, magnesium, manganese, silver,<br>
titanium,, tin, iron, and alloys thereof. The materials<br>
which serve to make up the galvanic couple described<br>
earlier may also serve as the reactive conductive<br>
electrode. Upon passage of an electric current, metal ions<br>
such as zinc, copper, magnesium, manganese and/or aluminum<br>
cations are released from the anode into the carrier and<br>
delivered into the barrier membrane. Such ions may serve<br>
therapeutic benefits such as anti-microbial effects,<br>
immunologic modulation, enzymatic regulation, and/or anti-<br>
inflammatory effects.<br>
In one embodiment, the reactive conductive electrode<br>
is made of reactive materials such as metal halides (e.g.,<br>
silver-silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), silver-silver bromide,<br>
and silver-silver iodide). In this case, the primary<br>
electrochemical reaction at the cathode surface is<br>
conversion of solid silver halide to metallic silver with<br>
little unwanted consumption of the oxidising agents<br>
generated by the anode. The released halide ions may be<br>
subsequently oxidised to oxizing agsnts, such as<br>
chloride ions to chlorine (Cl2) , hypoctiloroua acid (HC1O),<br>
and hypochlorite ions {C1CT} , and iodide ions to iodine.<br>
What is meant by an "inert conductive electrode" is<br>
that the conductive electrode itself does not go through a<br>
19<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
change in its chemical composition. In one embodiment,<br>
the anode is made of an inert conductive electrode, so<br>
that the electrochemical croceas al the surface of the<br>
anode generates oxidizing agents such as rscent oxygen<br>
(e.g., by electrolysis of water) and/or chlorine-<br>
containing oxidizing agents such as chloride,<br>
hypochlorite, chlorate and perchlorate, and chlorine<br>
dioxide. Nascent oxygen is an oxidizing agent thau is<br>
inhibitive to P. acnes, and chlorine-containing oxidizing<br>
agents are patent antimicrobial agent with bacteriocidal<br>
activity.<br>
In one embodiment.,the conductive electrode is made<br>
of, or coated on the surface with, an inert materials such<br>
as noble metals {e.g., gold, platinum, or gold-coated<br>
conductive metals), conductive carbon (e.g., glassy carbon<br>
or graphite), carbon-enibedded polymers (e.g., carbon<br>
silicons rubbers) conductive carbon polymree form or<br>
sponge, silver halide-coated silver (e.g., silver<br>
chloride-coated silver, silver bromide-ceased silver, and<br>
silver iodide-coacad silver), and crortosive resistant<br>
alloys.<br>
In one embodiment, the anode of the device, serving<br>
as the conductive electrode as well as a part of the<br>
galvanic couple power source, is made of aforementioned<br>
reactivs conduotivs oxidisable metala such as sine,<br>
calcium, magnesium, aluminium, iron, tin, copper, or alloys<br>
thereof, while the cathode, also serving as the conductive<br>
Slectrodte as well as a part of the galvanic couple power<br>
source, is made of the aforementioned reactive reducible<br>
Conductive materials each as a more chemically stable<br>
metal and its metal halides, oxidet, sulfide or other<br>
metal salts, such as silver and silver halides (e.g.,<br>
20<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodide, silver,<br>
fluoride) , silver oxide, silver sulfitife. in one<br>
embodiment, the reducible conductive material is in direct<br>
contact; with a good electric conductor, such as a thin<br>
layer of silver chloride, silver oxide, or silver sulfide<br>
over metallic silver; silver chloride powder with a binder<br>
(e.g., silver cihloxide ink) ; and/or silver chloride powder<br>
mixed, with silver or conductive carbon powder held<br>
together by a binder in a matrix form (e.g. , silver-silver<br>
chloride ink and silver chloride-carbon ink) .<br>
In another embodiment, the anode of the device in the<br>
present invention is made of aforementioned reactive<br>
Conductive oxidizeble metals while the cathode is made of<br>
aforementioned more chemically stable electrode materials<br>
such as conductive carbon, metallic silver, gold or<br>
platinum, or a powder mixture of conductive carbon and the<br>
noble metal in a rastrix fount as disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,l62,043.<br>
In one embodiment, the device of the present<br>
invention enables the targeted delivery of beneficial sine<br>
through hair follicles to the piloscbacaous unit {i.e. a<br>
sebaceous gland and the associated hair follicle} to treat<br>
acne or rosacea. Zinc is an essential metal to the human<br>
body because it participates in various biological<br>
actrities in the body (a.g.,the body of 3. 70-Kg person<br>
contains about 2.3 grams of sine). It is known that the<br>
lack of zinc in the body may lead to skin diseases such as<br>
acne.<br>
In another embodiment, the deviee of the present<br>
invention enables the targeted delivery of other<br>
beneficial metals into the hair follicles and the<br>
piloseboaceous glands by using an anode made of sine alloy<br>
21<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
containing small quantities of other beneficial metals.<br>
Such beneficial metals includes, without limitation,<br>
certain metals essential to the human body such asiron,<br>
copper, magnesium, manganese, calcium, potatssium,<br>
aluminum, and selenium. As the zinc alloy anode oxidizes,<br>
it releases into the carrier zine ions and other<br>
beneficial metala in the sine alloy, which ingredients<br>
subsequently migrate into the hair follicles under the<br>
applied electric potential over the skin. In one<br>
embodiment, the content of the sine alloy in the anode in<br>
greater than about 50% by weight, such, as greater than 90%<br>
by weight.<br>
In one embodiment, the ratio of the conductance<br>
measured between the first conductive and second<br>
conductive electrode of (i) the carrier and (ii) the skin<br>
hydrated with such carrier (wherein substantially all of<br>
the cuurrent passes between the electrodes through the<br>
skin) is in a range from about 10 000:1 to about 1:100. In<br>
other words, the electric current distribution between<br>
Icarrier and Iskin is such that the value of Icarrier/Iskin is<br>
between about 10,000 and about 0.01. Icarrier is the portion<br>
of the total current going through the device (Itotal) that<br>
only passes through the carrier layer between the anode<br>
and cathode without traveling through the skin, whereas<br>
Iskin is the portion of Itotal that passes through the skin,<br>
namely, Itotal = Icarrier + Iskin.<br>
Decreasing the ratio of the conductance of the<br>
carrier to the conductance of the skin will result in a<br>
greater percentage of current passags through the skin,<br>
thereby enhancing iontophoretic delivery of any active<br>
agents being so delivered into the skin. Decreasing the<br>
conductivity of the carrier can nonexclusively be<br>
22<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
accomplished by adding less condvctive materials to the<br>
carrier. Examples of such less conductive materials<br>
include, but are not limited to, oils such as silicons or<br>
hydrocarbon oils, air pockets such as air bubbles or air<br>
pockets in a serai-solid carrier, or polymer or clay beads.<br>
In one embodiment where the primary intention is to<br>
electroeheinieally generate species in the carrier, the<br>
value of Icarrier / Iskin is between about 10,000 and about 1.<br>
in another embodiment where the primary intention is to<br>
deliver electricity and/or active agents into the skin,<br>
the value of Icarrier/ Iskin is between about 10 and about<br>
1.01. Adjustmnent of the value of Icarrier / Iskin for a<br>
particular application can also be achieved by changing<br>
the distance between the first and the second electrode,<br>
or the distance between the two conductive electrode and<br>
the skin. For example, as the distance between the two<br>
conductive electrode decreases, the conductance measured<br>
between the two electrode increases and so is the Icareer.<br>
leading to a increased value of lcarrier / Iskin. On the other<br>
hand, if the distance between the two conductive<br>
electreaties and the skin increases the Iskin increases,<br>
leading to decreased value of Icarrier / Iskin.<br>
Active Agents<br>
In out embodiment, the carrier contains one or mote<br>
active agents. What is meant by an "active agent" is a<br>
compound (e.g., a synthetic compound or a compound<br>
isolated from a natural source) that has a cosmetic or<br>
therapeutic; effect on the barrier membrane and the<br>
surrouitdina, tissues (e.g., a material capable of exerting<br>
a biological effect on a human body) such as therapeutic<br>

in one embodiment, the carrier contains metals such<br>
as metal ions, metal salts, metal complexes, fine metal<br>
pawdexs, fine metal coated fibera and fabrics of synthetic<br>
or natural origin, or fine metal fibers. Examples of such<br>
metals include, but are not limited to, zinc, copper,<br>
aluminum, gold, silver, titanium. The metal ions provide<br>
benefits such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and/or<br>
sebum-reduction effects. The beneficial metal ions may be<br>
released from the metal anode as the result of an<br>
electrochemical oxidation reaction concurrent with<br>
electric current passage (e.g., zinc ions<br>
electrochsmieally- generated from a zine anode).<br>
In another embodiment, the beneficial ions may be<br>
generated indirectly from the electrochemical reactions at<br>
the electrode surface, sucn as the generation of hydrogen<br>
or hydroxyl ions at an inert electrode, which subsequently<br>
leads to a process to generate beneficial ions. For<br>
example, a device of the present invention may contain a<br>
power source, an inert anode (e.g., platinum, platinum<br>
27<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
coated conductive electrode, gold, or gold-coated<br>
conductive electrods) , a reactive cathode (e,g.,<br>
silver/silver chloride electrode) , and an aqueous carrier<br>
composition containing an oxide (e.g., zinc oxide<br>
particles) among other active agents. During application<br>
to the skin, the electrolysis of water at the inert anode<br>
produces excess hydrogen ions which acidify the carrier<br>
toward a lower pH value, while the electrochemical<br>
reaction at the reactive cathode (e.g., the conversion of<br>
silver chloride to silver ions) does not affectthe pH. As<br>
the solution becomes more acidic, the oxide starts to<br>
dissolve to release ions (e.g., zinc ions) for their<br>
beneficial effects to the barrier membrane.<br>
Other active agent a include those commonly used as<br>
for topical treatment and in cosmetic treatment of skin<br>
tissues, such, as topical antibiotics for wounds, topical<br>
antifungal drugs to treat fungal infections of the skin<br>
and nails, and antipsorianic drugs to treat psoriatic<br>
lesions of the skin and paoriatic nails.<br>
Examples of antifunctal drugs include but are not<br>
limited to miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole,<br>

Light Emitting Diode<br>
In one embodiment, the device contains one or more<br>
light emitting diodes. "Light emitting diodes (LEDS) of<br>
certain spectrum may be incorporated into the device to<br>
emit light to the-barrier membrane (e.g., to treat skin<br>
conditions such as acne and rosacea) , The light emitting<br>
diode may also provide a signal to the user indicating<br>
that the device is operating properly.<br>
In one embodiment,the LED is one that emits light<br>
periodically (i.e., a blinking LED) , In a further<br>
embodiment, such LED also modulates the current passing<br>
chrough the barrier membrane to form a pulsatile DC<br>
current. Such pulsatile DC current can enhance delivery of<br>
active agents into the barrier membrane, stimulate<br>
biological responses in the barrier membrane such a.s<br>
enhancing wound healing (e.g,, in acne lesions), and/or<br>
enhanced skin in sensation which serves a signal to a user<br>
chat the device is working. Another potential advantage of<br>
using a blinking LED is to produce pulsatile DC current<br>
without the nsed of a complex electric circuit.<br>
The spectrum of the LED's according to the current<br>
invention may range front about 300 nm to about 150 um,<br>
such as from about 350 nm to about 1000 mn. In one<br>
embodiment, the range of the LED includes violet-blue,<br>
green, red and infrared ranges, e.g., from about 400 nm<br>
to about 450 nm such as from about 407 ran to about 420 nm<br>
from about 510 nm to about 55 0 nm; from about 600 nm to<br>
about 700 nm; and from about 1300 nm to about 1500 nm. In<br>
one embodiment, the device contains two LEDB, one that<br>
32<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
emits light, having a wavelength of from about 400 nu to<br>
about 500 nm and one "which emits light from about. 700 nm<br>
to about 1000 nm.Photoseneitizer agents, such as 5-<br>
aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) , hypericin, Se John's wort<br>
powder or extract, or other synthetic or natural<br>
photosnsitisier agents, may toe incorporated into the<br>
carrier as active agents to be delivered and irradiated by<br>
the device with LED's of the present invention. The light<br>
irradiation from the LED's, together with the<br>
photoeenaitiaer agent(s) and other aforementioned active<br>
agents, electrochemically generated oxidizing agents<br>
(e.g., peroxides, nascent oxygen, chlorine dioxide, and<br>
chlorine) , and/or electric stimulation of the barrier<br>
membrane may work synergistically to achieve an improved<br>
efficacy in treating membrane disorders such as acne and<br>
rosacea.<br>

nticrabisl infections of the ntucosa.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the<br>
device induces certain desirable biological responses that<br>
facilitate the treatment of the barrier membrane<br>
conditions. These desirable biological responses may be<br>
induced by the electric current passage through the<br>
barrier membrane, and/or the electrochemically generated<br>
oxidising materials, together with the active agents<br>
delivered by iontophoresis from the carrier, in treating<br>
the barrier conditions. Examplea of the desirable<br>
responses of the barrier membrane may include, but are not<br>
limited to, xxx regulation (e.g., reduction of sebaceous<br>
gland activity), inhibition of anaerobotic microbial<br>
growth, and establishment of a healthier membrane<br>
microflora or (e.g, reduction of p. acne growth and of<br>
production of irritating fatty acids), blood<br>
vasoconstriction (thus promoting local accumulation of<br>
active agents or removal of dark circle under the eye due<br>
to deoxyhernoglobina) , enhanced tissue nnmunological<br>

activity (e.g, increased elimination of pathogenic<br>
microbes on tissue's own defense ayatetns) , iinproved tissue<br>
repairing (e.g., enhanced healing and reduced scarring of<br>
lesions such as acne lesions}, and improved keratolytic<br>
activity or the carrier (e.g., softening of keratin plugs<br>
of comedos in whiteheada and blackheads of acne, and<br>
Facilitating their removal).<br>
In another aspect, the invention also features the<br>
method of converting an active agent from a less active<br>
form to a more active form via oxidation or reduction, via<br>
an inert eleccrade (e.g., cystine to cyeteine, diaulfide<br>
acetyl-Cygteine to acetyl-cysteine, and retinol to<br>
retinoic acid). Thue, an unstable agent can be stored in<br>
a more stable form and converted to its active form prior<br>
to administration. In a further aspect, the generation of<br>
reducing agents by the device of the present invention can<br>
be used to stabilise oxygen-labile active agents.<br>
Examples of such oxygen-labile active agents include, but<br>
are not limited to, retinoids, ascorbic acid, and oenzoyl<br>
peroxide.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention also features the<br>
method of converting an active agent from a leas active<br>
form to a more active form via. oxidation at an reactive<br>
anode, such as an anode made of zinc, magnesium, copper,<br>
aluminum, slloy or mixture of these metals for example,<br>
an anode made of sine releases zinc ions with the passage<br>
of an electric current through the electroda. The zinc<br>
ions generated by such an electrochemical reactions are<br>
then subsequently delivered by the electric repulsion of<br>
the positively charged anode into the barrier membrane.<br>
In one embodiment, such ions are deposited into the hair<br>
follicles and/or sebaceous glands to inhibit p. acnes<br>

WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
growth arid/or suppress skin tissue inflamnation resulted<br>
from p. acnes ovsr growth before the treatment Similarly,<br>
a sine-copper alloy anode or another zinc-beneficial metal<br>
alloy releases both zinc ions and copper ions or the other<br>
beneficial ions, respecytively, into the hair follicles<br>
and sebaceous glands for acne treatment and prevention.<br>
Skin Conditions<br>
In one embodiment, the device of the present<br>
invention is used to treat skin conditions such as: acne<br>
and acne (e,g. , blscklieads and whiteheads} and acne-<br>
related skin conditions such as roeacea and nodule-cystic;<br>
hypeirpigmentation such as freckles, tnelasttta, actinic and<br>
senile lentigines, age-spcts, post-inflammatory<br>
hypetmnelanoaia, Becker's naevus, datk circles under the<br>
eye, ersd facial melanoais; stretch marks; and skin aging<br>
effects on the skin (such as those caused by photodamage)<br>
including wrinkling, roughness, pigmentary alterations,<br>
sallovnesa, fine lines, and laxity, by delivering active<br>
agents that including pra-formulated active agentig in the<br>
carrier and electrochemically generated active agents<br>
(e.g., beneficial metal ions) by the electrodes, and/or by<br>
providing electric stimulation to the skin tissues.<br>
In one embodiment, the device of the present<br>
invention provide multiple mechanism of actions to treat<br>
such conditions: namely, (a) target- delivering pre-<br>
foxraulated. active agents into the piloaebaceous unit by<br>
iontcsphoresia and electro-oamosis; {b) electro chemically<br>
generating new active agents (e.g, the beneficial metal<br>
ions from a reactive anode) and targeted delivery of the<br>
freshly generated active agents to the pilosebaceous unit<br>
(e.g., beneficial iona such as sine and copper have known.<br>
36<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
to enhance skin's own immune system) ; and/or (c) providing<br>
electric stimulation to the pilosebaceous unit and its<br>
surrounding skin tissues to increase blood circulation,<br>
and to treat the skin by reducing inflammation, enhancing<br>
wound healing, and/or increasing skin exfoliation.<br>
Mounds and Sears<br>
In one embodiment, the device of the present<br>
invention can be incorporated into wound dressings and<br>
bandages to provide electric therapy for healing<br>
enhancement and scar prenvetion. In one embodiment, the<br>
wound exudation fluid and/or wound cleansing solution<br>
serves tts activate a galvanic wound dressing /bandage to<br>
deliver active agents pre-incorporated in the wound<br>
dress ing/bandage and/or to generate clectrochemically<br>
beneficial metal ions followed with delivery of the<br>
beneficial metal ions into the wound. The device also<br>
treats the wound with therapeutic electric current which<br>
may increase blood circulation, stimulate tissue immune<br>
response, and/or suppress tissue inflammation, which may<br>
lead, to accelerated healing and reduced scarring.<br>
Enhanced Chemical Peel<br>
chemical peel treatments are an in-office procedure<br>
that involves the application of a chemical agent to the<br>
skin to induce controlled destruction or exfoliation of<br>
old skin and stimulation of new epidermal growth with more<br>
evenly distributed melanin. When peel agents reach the<br>
dermal layer, important wound-healing activities occur<br>
that cause skin remodeling and skin smoothing, both are<br>
anti-agins benefits. Delivery of chemical peel agents<br>

WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
idoensyma, or zymogen form. Examples include pepsin,<br>
Bromelain, papaya, and cathepain- Further examples<br>
include natural extract chemical peeling agents such as<br>
fruit extracts, muattrooni extract, and other plant<br>
esnrarts.<br>
In one embodiment, the duration of the application of<br>
the device to the skin is froin about 2 to about 10 minutes<br>
depending on the individual skin, conditions. In one<br>
embodimerit, the carrier contains from about 0.1% to about<br>
70% by weight of such chemical peel agent, such as from<br>
about 0.5% to about 20% such as from about 3% to about<br>
103.<br>
Shape<br>
The device includes a housing that may be fabricated<br>
into various shapes and sizes to fit the contoura of<br>
various anatomical surfaces of the barrier membranes. For<br>
examples, the housing may be a substrate made in the shape<br>
of a whole facial mask with openings/holes to expose the<br>
eyes, eye bows, nose, and mouth; a partial facial mask<br>
covering only the upper or lower half of the face; or a<br>
patch coveting only the forehead, or the under eye region,<br>
the chin and jaw region, the neck, the back, wound, acne<br>
lesion or pimple, or other specific area of a barrier<br>
membrane in need of treatment.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
housing is a water-insoluble substtate containing a<br>
galvanic couple, for example, a tine sine wire or a fine<br>
zinc-coated fiber {e.g., zine-coated polymer fiber)<br>
connected to a fine copper wire or a fine copper-coated<br>
fiber (e.g., copper-coated polymer fiber). One or more<br>
such fine galvanic couple wire(s) or fiber (a) may be<br>
39<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
incorporated into the substrate to create a dsvics which,<br>
when, in contact with the carrier (such as tap water or a<br>
liquid or semi-liquid composition including active agents)<br>
generates an electric current. In one embodiment, a<br>
galvanic couple-containing suistiate may be made of<br>
multiple layer, for exampla, a layer of the zinc<br>
containing subscracs (e.g., a fine zinc wire- or a fine<br>
zine-coated fiber in a woven or non-woven fabric) over a<br>
layer of copper-containing substrate (e.g., a fins copper<br>
wire- or a fine copper-coated fiber in a woven, or non-<br>
woven fabric). During use, the layers contact each other<br>
to form the galvanic couple. In a further embodiment, the<br>
device releases beneficial ions (e.g., zinc ions or<br>
aluminum ions) that are delivered to the barrier membrane<br>
(e.g., the skin) when such a substrate is applied by the<br>
user (e.g., used as a wipe for cleaning the skin or a<br>
facial patch or mask to treat the skin) . Active agents may<br>
also be incorporated into the substrate during<br>
manufacturing processes or be subsequently applied to the<br>
substarts prior to the application to the barrier membrane<br>
(e,g. , in the fornt of an electrolyte or active agent<br>
containing liquid, apray to wet the substrate}. In one<br>
embodiment the fabric is used as a dry wipe or a dry full<br>
or partial facial mask, to be wetted immediately before<br>
use, by applying water to the dry wipe or facial mask to<br>
pre-moisturised skin {e.g, by washing with tap water).<br>
By "water insoluble" is meant that the substrate,<br>
upon immersion in distilled water at 25oC, does not<br>
readily diasolve in or readily break apart. The water-<br>
insoluble substrate may, however, be disintegrated and/or<br>
dissolved slowly, i.e., over a period of several hours up<br>
to several days. A wide variety of materials can be used<br>
40<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
as the water-insoluble subserve. Examples of suitable<br>
substrates include, but are not limited, to, non-woven<br>
substarates, woven substrates, hydno-entarigleid substrates,<br>
air entangled substrates, natural sponges, synthetic<br>
aponges, and polymeric netted meshes.<br>
The Water insoluble substrates may be fluehable. As<br>
used bereia, by "flutshable" is meant that the substrate<br>
will pass through at least l0 foat of waste pipe in two<br>
toilet flushes. The material may also be biodegradable.<br>
In one enibodiment, the substrates contain a non-woven<br>
material. By "non-woven" is meant that the substrate, or<br>
a layer of the substrate, is comprised of fibers that are<br>
not woven into a fabric but rather are formed into a<br>
sheet, mat, or pad layer. The fibers can either be random<br>
i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e.,<br>
combed to be oriented in primarily one direction.<br>
Purthermore, the non-woven substrate can be composed of a<br>
combination of layers of random and carded fibers). <br>
Non-woven substrates may be comprised of a variety of<br>
natural and/or synthetic materials. By "natural" is meant<br>
that the materials are derived from plants, animals,<br>
insects, or byproducts of plants, animals, and insects. By<br>
"synthetic" is meant that the materiala are obtained<br>
primarily from various man-made materials or from natural<br>
materials, which havs been further altered.<br>
Nan-limiting exemples of natural materials useful in the<br>
present invention are silk fibers, Keratin fibers (such as<br>
wool fibers, camel hair fibers) and cellulesic fibers<br>
(such as wool pulp fibers, cotton fibers, hemp fibers,<br>
jute fibers, and flax fibers}.<br>
Examples of synthetic materials include, but are not<br>
limited to, those selected from the group containing<br>
41<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
attetace fibers, acrylic fibers, cellulose eater fibers,<br>
ctrtton fibers, raodacryl ic fibers, polyaniide fibers,<br>
pclyoster fibers, polyolefixi fibers, polyvinyl alcohol<br>
fibers, rayon fibers, polyurethane foam, and mixtures<br>
thereol .<br>
Substrates made from one ore more of the natural and<br>
synthetic naterials useful in the present invention can be<br>
obtained from a wide variety of connnercial sources such as<br>
Freudenberg &amp; Co. (Durham, NC USA), BBA Nonwovens<br>
(Nashville, TN USA) , PGI Nonwovena (North Charleston, SC<br>
USA), Buckeye Technologies/Walkisoft (Mamphis, TN USA),<br>
and Fort James Corporation (Deerfield, IL USA} .<br>
Methods of making non-woven substrates are also well<br>
known in the art. Such, methods include, but are not<br>
limited to, air-laying, water-laying, melt-blowing, spin-<br>
bonding, or carding processes, The resulting substrate,<br>
regardless of its method of production or composition, is<br>
then subjected to at least one of several types of bonding<br>
operations to anchor the individual fibers together to<br>
from a self-sustaining web. The non-woven substrate can be<br>
prepared by a variety of processes including hydro-<br>
entanglement, thermally boudirtig, and combinations of these<br>
processes. Moreover, the substrates can have a single<br>
layer or multiple layers. In addition, a multi-layered<br>
substrate can include film layer (s) (e.g., aperture or<br>
non-aperture film laysrs) and other non-fibrous materials.<br>
Strength or firmness of the non-woven material may be<br>
a desirable attribute. This can be achieved, for example,<br>
by the addition of binding materials, such as wet strength<br>
reiains, or the material may be made of polymer binder<br>
coatings, stable fibres, e.g. based on cotton, wool, linen<br>
and the like. Examples of wet strength resins include, but<br>
42<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
are not limited to, vinyl acretate-ethylene (VAE) and<br>
athylene-vinyl. chloride (EVCL) Airflex emulsions (Air<br>
Products, Lehigh, PA), Flextaond. acrylic polymers (Air<br>
Ptoducrs, Lehigh, PA) , Rhoplex ST-954 acrylic binder (Rohm<br>
and Haas. Philadelphia, PA) , and Ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
(EVA) emulsion (DUR-O-SET* by National Starch Chemicals,<br>
Bridgewater, NJ} . The amount of binding material in the<br>
substrate may range from about 5% to about 20%, by weight,<br>
of the substrate.<br>
Non-woven materials Of increased strength can also be<br>
obtained by using the so-called spunlace or hydxro-<br>
sntanglement technique. In this technique, the indivictual<br>
fibers are twisted together so that an acceptable strength<br>
if firmness is obtained without the need to use binding<br>
naterials. The advantage of the latter technique is the<br>
lesteclient softness of the non-woven material.<br>
In one embodiment, the non-woven material is made of<br>
a super absorbent polymer. For the purposes of the present<br>
invention, the term " superabsorbant polymer" refers to<br>
materials which are capable of absorbing and retaining" at<br>
least about 10 times their weight in body fluids under a<br>
0.5 pai pressure. The superabsorbent polymer particles of<br>
the invention may be inorganic or organic crosslinked<br>
hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
polyethylene oxides, cross linked starches, guar gum,<br>
xanthan gum, and other material known to the art of<br>
absorbent article manufacture,<br>
Additives may also be added in order to increase the<br>
softness of the substrates. Examples of such additives<br>
include, but are not limited to, polyols such as glycerol,<br>
propylene glyeol and polyethylene glycol, phthalate<br>
43<br><br>

contains a removable release liner 100, a carrier layer<br>
120, a First conductive electrode 140, a second conductive<br>
clectrude 240, electric lead wires 110 and 210 connecting<br>
the two ends of an elecirrically insulated connecting wire<br>
350 to the two dissimilar conductive electrodes, an<br>
optional electric powsr switch 330 located on the lead<br>
wire 210, a backing layer 160, and a cover layer 340.<br>
The gap "b" depicts the distance between two<br>
conductive electrodes 140 and 240 to the release liner (or<br>
the membrane following application of the device) , and the<br>
gap "a" represents the distance between two oppositely<br>
charged conductive electrodes. In one embodiment, gap "a"<br>
is between 0 to about 20 centimeter. and gap "b" is<br>
between 0 and to about 1 centimeters. In another<br>
embodiment, the ratio of gap "a" to gap "b" is from about<br>
0	to about 20.<br>
The backing layer 160 may be impermeable to the<br>
active agent contained within the carrier layer 120, and<br>
is preferably not permeable to water or other solvents in<br>
the carrier layer 120. The backing layer 160 and cover<br>
layer 340 may be made of flexible material that is<br>
impermeable to water and electrically insulating, e.g.,<br>
polymers suah as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyurethane, silicone rubber, or polyvinyl<br>
ahloride.<br>
In a further embodiment the backing layer 160 is<br>
permeable to electrocherically generated gases (e.g.,<br>
oxygen, chlorine, and hyirogen) in order to limit excess<br>
accumulation of the gases in the carrier which can cause<br>
tissue irritation and/or undesirable deformation of the<br>
device. Examples of such "breathabl backing" material<br>
include, but are not lited to, a cotton or synthetic<br>

The carrier layer 120 is an adhesive hydrogel<br>
containing the active agent. The active agent may be<br>
incorporated into the carrier layer 120 as dissolved<br>
molecules and ions, dispersed solid particles, or liquid<br>
droplets such as creats, lotion, emulsion, multi-emuision,<br>
microemulsion, and/or liposome compositions. The carrier<br>
layer 320 may also contain a, solid supporting matrix<br>
(e.g., a gauze, non-woven or sponoe-like material) .<br>
A removable liner sheet 100 covers the carrier layer<br>
120, The selection of the removable release-liner 100 is<br>
dependent on the type of the adhesive hydxogel used in<br>
carrier layer 120. The release liner sheet 10 0 is<br>
typicslly a polymer sheet or a paper or fabric coated with<br>
a polymer, which has weak adhesion toward the adhesive<br>
hydrogel layer 120, thereby allowing it to be easily<br>
removed from the carrier layer 120 prior to use without<br>
damaging the carrier layer 120. Examples of the polymere<br>
typically used for the release liner 100 are silicones and<br>
polyethylenes. Alternatively a wax may be used in the<br>
place of the polyrner to coat the release liner 100.<br>
In addition to, or in lieu of, the use of an adhesive<br>
in the carrier layer 120, the device 500 may be .fastened<br>
to the barrier membrane with an adhesive tape, an elastic<br>
band, a band with a buckle (similar to a leather watch<br>
band) or a velcro hand.<br>
In order to use device 500, the renovahle release<br>
liner sheet 100 is peoled off, and the carrier hydrogel<br>
layer 120 of the device 500 is affixed, to a barrier<br>
membrane, such, as the skin of mucosal membranes each as<br>
vaginal, oral, buccal, nasal, gastrointestinal or rectal<br>

WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
each other through direct connect ion, naraely, the gap "a"<br>
(the distance between, two oppositely charged conductive<br>
electrodes) is equal to zero. Two conductive electrodes<br>
forms a galvanic couple which is contact the carrier layer<br>
120 enclosed in backing layer 160 with an opening affixed<br>
to the release liner 100 with an adhesive layer 130. One<br>
major advantage of this configuration is its simplicity<br>
and easiness to manufacture.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is<br>
represented achematically in FIG. 5. The electrotransport<br>
device 800 containes two electrode assemblies 200 and 600,<br>
reeptccive adhesive layers 230 and 630, respective carrier<br>
layete 220 and 620, respective conductive electrodes 240<br>
and 640, respective backing layers 270 and 670, respective<br>
eiectric leads 210 and 610, electrically insulated<br>
connecting wire 350 and optional electric switch 330.<br>
Similar to the aforementioned typical iontophoresis<br>
device, the two electrode assemblies 200 and 600 are to be<br>
affixed to the barrier membrane apart from each other,<br>
after the release liner 100 is removed prior to use.<br>
In one embodiment, the carrier layer 120 contains at<br>
least two active agents carrying opposite electric<br>
charges. One example of such a composition is a<br>
composition containing from about 0.5 to about 2% of<br>
salicylic acid. and from about 0.01 to about 0,2% of a<br>
cationic quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents (such as<br>
benzalKonium chloride, benzechoium chloride, methyl<br>
benzetlionium chloride, and cetylpyridirsium chloride),<br>
phenol, and/or chloarhexidine gluconate. The device 500 of<br>
the present invention can simultaneously deliver both<br>
active agents of opposite charges into the membrane.<br>

WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
Fig’s 5 and 7 show two examples of different<br>
configurations of dissimilar conductive electrodes 140<br>
(shown by a double line) and 240 (shown by a single line)<br>
in carrier layer 120, connected by electrically insulated<br>
wires 350 (shown by a triple line) to form a galvanic<br>
couple power source. FIG. 6 shows that the conductive<br>
electrodes 140 and 240 are arranged in an inter-digitated<br>
configuration. FIG, 7 shows the conductive electrodes in a<br>
concentric configuration.<br>
FIG's 8 and 9 show two examples of other<br>
configurations of dissimilar conductive electrodes 140 and<br>
240 in carrier layer 120, connected to each other either;<br>
connective wire 350 as in FIG 8 or by a direct physical<br>
contact at each intersection 370 as in FIG 9 to form a<br>
plural of galvanic; couple power sources, which are in<br>
contact with the carrier layer 120. The conductive<br>
electrodes 140 and 240 in FIG'a 8 and 9 are arranged in<br>
parallel and perpendicular configurations, respectively.<br>
The alternating parallel arrangement of the<br>
conductive electrodes 140 and 240 in FIG. 8 provides a<br>
more uniform electric current distribution throughout the<br>
carrier layer 120 and the underlying skin tissue, and<br>
consequently, assist in enabling a more uniform delivery<br>
of active agents into the skin. One exemplifying<br>
fabrication method for the galvanic device shown in FIG. 8<br>
is by weaving a silver-coated polymer fabric and zinc-<br>
coated polymer Cabrie (or zinc wire} into a liquid-<br>
absorbant fabric layer according to the parallel electrode<br>
pattern, then connecting zinc and silver electrodes by<br>
printing over the silver and sine regions with an electric<br>
conductive ink (e.g., conductive silver or carbon ink).<br>
Covering another layer of an electric insulating ink over<br>
50<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
the electric; conductive ink will produce the electrically<br>
insulaLed connecting wire 350.<br>
Another fabrication method for the device of FIG 8 is<br>
via printing; to prinL onto a non-conductivs polymeric<br>
substrate layer (e.g. the polymer material made of the<br>
bicking layer 160) using a conductive silver or silver-<br>
silvear chloride ink to produce the first conductive<br>
electrode; and to print the second conductive electrode<br>
using a conductive sine ink. The two dissimilar<br>
conductive electrodes are then connected by printing cross<br>
them with either the conductive Silver or zinc ink (or a<br>
different conductive ink such as carbon ink). A covering<br>
ink may then optionally be printed over the connecting<br>
wire to produce an electric insulating polymer layer over<br>
it. If the device is made without insulating with an<br>
electrically insulating coverying layer, the resulting<br>
device is a variation of that depicted in FIG. 9.<br>
FIG 9 is a top view of one embodiment in accordance<br>
with the invention showing the conductive electrodes 140<br>
and 240 connected to each other by direct physical contact<br>
at the intersections 370 to form a galvanic couple power<br>
source, which is in contact with the carrier layer 120.<br>
The conductive electrodes 140 and 240 are arranged in a<br>
Perpendicular configuration. The aforementioned<br>
fabrication methods for the device in FIG. 8 is also<br>
suitable to produce this device.<br>
FIG. 10 is a top view of one embodiment in accordance<br>
with the invention showing a device made of a zinc meth<br>
having conductive electrodes 140 (shown in bold lines) and<br>
electrodes 240 (shown in double lines) connected by<br>
ilcctrically insulated connecting wires 350 (shown in<br>
single lines') embedded in the carrier layer 120. The<br>
51<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
sbrsductive electrodes 140 are uncoated regions of the zinc<br>
mesh. The conductive elefctrodis 240 is prepared by coating<br>
the designated portion of the zinc mesh with a silver-<br>
silver chloride ink. The electrically insulated coiinecting<br>
wire 350 is prepared by coating th^ designated portion of<br>
the zinc mesh with an electrically insulating paint, ink.,<br>
or polymer solution.<br>
FIG, 11 is a top view of one embodiment in accordance<br>
with the invent ion showing the conductive electrodes 140<br>
and 240 embedded in the carriex layer 120. The conductive<br>
electrodes 140 are made of a piece of zinc mesh. The<br>
conductive electrodes 240 are prepared by costing the<br>
designated portion of the zinc mesh with a silver-silver<br>
chloride or silver ink, or by other silver seposifcing<br>
methods such as electroless deposition (chemical reduction<br>
ieposition), electroplating, plasma spray, or vacuum<br>
deposition. Elimination of the electrically insulated<br>
connecting wire 350 in this design would simplify the<br>
manufacturing process. The location, pattern, shape, and<br>
size of the electrode of metallic silver, silver-silver<br>
chloride or silver-silver oxide may vary depending on the<br>
need, of a particular products.<br>
zine mesh, (or expended zinc" as common called in<br>
battery and anti-corrosion fields) may be prepared from a<br>
thin zinc fol] with mechanical perforation and subsequent<br>
expansion into net-like patterns. The major advantages of<br>
a zine mesh enode in the galvanic device of the present<br>
invention are its ability of forming and retaining the<br>
desirable mask/patch shape by a uaer,stretching by a user<br>
toward any directions to form mask/patch of desirable<br>
size, and being breathable.<br>
52<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
It should be noted although the use of zinc mesh is<br>
described here as an example of electrode designs, other<br>
aforement ioned materials suitable for galvanic couple<br>
formulation and for conductive electrodes can also be made<br>
into a mesh or an expanded form to provide the same<br>
function.<br>
Zinc mesh also has the ability to conform to the<br>
shape of the membrans surface (e.g. the shape of an<br>
individual's face} by gently pressuring it, and to retain<br>
this shape. This capability makes it uniquely suitable for<br>
a facial mask, or certain skin patches to better fit the<br>
contours of certain anatomic features of the face (e.g., a<br>
NOse patch) or body areas. This unique feature also<br>
ansists in better electric contact and may also reduce<br>
dependence on using adhesives to affix the device to the<br>
skin.<br>
It is also highly convenient and desirable to a<br>
consumer if a facial mask or patch can be stretched to<br>
different sizes in order to cover a particular skin area<br>
without compromising its electric performance. A zinc mesh<br>
aiode tor other mesh conductive electrode) is uniquely<br>
Cipable to fulfill this consumer need. In another<br>
e nbodiment the mesh is not expanded before use so that<br>
the device is smaller and more compact for easy storage<br>
and jsnymg. Rather it is stretched open to a desired<br>
size during application by a consumer.<br>
Good breatliability is important for a facial mask or<br>
a patch ox relatively large sise, especially if the device<br>
is designed to be worn by a user for an extended period of<br>
time (e.g., longer than one half hour such as overnight).<br>
In order Co make aforementioned device etretchable and/or<br>
breathable, the carrier layer 120 and backing layer 160<br>
53<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
should also be stretchable and breathable, such as<br>
stretchable woven and nonwaven fabric teaheriala.<br>
In anothe embodiment, the baking layer 160 in FIG'S<br>
3-5, can be pert orated or eliminatetd entirely for a mask<br>
or patch device, which is especially suitable for the<br>
application of short duration, e.g., from about 5 to about<br>
30 minutes. As water in the carrier composition<br>
evaporates, the electric conductance and the electric<br>
current decrease. Eventually, the electric current will<br>
significantly diminish, providing in essence a self-<br>
terminating device to serve as a safety measure for the<br>
user to prevent any unintentional over-exposure of the<br>
skin to the electric current and potential resulting skin<br>
damage.<br>
One example of such a self-terminating device is a<br>
galvanic cloth facial mask made with a sine mesh partially<br>
coated with silver-silver chloride ink, which is placed in<br>
between a backing film/housing (e.g., a perforated or<br>
nonperforated polyethylene film) and a nonwoven fabric<br>
(e.g., a polyester and/or rayon nonwoven sheet) using a<br>
binding process based on heating, ultrasound or other<br>
mechanism Prior to application, a liquid or semisolid<br>
earner composition containing ionic and non-ionc active<br>
agents and other optional electrolytes is applied to the<br>
non-woven AND OF the device to activate the galvanic power<br>
source. The galvanic device is then pressed onto the<br>
light's face with the nonwoven side in direct contact with<br>
the skin. Alternatively, the active agents and other<br>
optional electrolyte may be incorporated in nonwovan layer<br>
during manufacturing process in an anhydrous stats. In<br>
use, the device can be applied to water-wetted face, and<br>
the water will dissolve the active agents and electrolytes<br>
54<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
to activate the galvanic current. The anhydrous active<br>
agenta may be in the form of dry powder immobilized onto<br>
the inhers or the nonwoen, or dissolved firgt in an<br>
organic solvent (e.g., polyethylene glycol, propylcne<br>
glycol, glycerin, and/or alcohol) to form a non-conductive<br>
or very law conductive solution, which is absorbed in the<br>
ion woven layer .<br>
The zinc anode materials may be manufactured with a<br>
wide variety of manufacturing process, including, but not<br>
limited to, metal processing, electroless deposition,<br>
electroplating, plasma spray, vacuum deposition, print<br>
processes such as screen, printing using a zinc conductive<br>
ink, textile or nonwoven technologies. Similarly, other<br>
conductive metal materials, such as silver-silver<br>
chloride, silver-silver oxide, copper, magnesium, aluminum<br>
alloys Of sine, magnesium, copper and aluminum, may be<br>
manufactured into the aforementioned electrode forms uaing<br>
the manufacturing processes disclosed above.<br>
Topical Compositions Containing Galvanic Pairs<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention features a<br>
topical composition containing a first conductive metal<br>
particulates such as fine flakes, wires/fibers or metal-<br>
coated fibers) selected from zinc, aluminum, copper, and<br>
their alloys; and a second conductive metal particulates<br>
(such as fine flakes, wires/fibers or metal-coated fibers)<br>
selected from silver, copper, gold, and their alloys. The<br>
first and second metal particulates can be selected from<br>
aforementioned electrode materials to form galvanic<br>
couples. Upon contact, the first conductive metal and the<br>
second conductive metal form a galvanic pair, generates<br>
electric current, and electrochemicaliy generates ions.<br>
55<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
In a further embodiment, the difisrence of the standard<br>
potentials ef the first conductive metal end the second<br>
conductivs metal is at least about 0.lv, such as at least<br>
abput 0.5 V. For example., upon contact with a first<br>
conductive metal that contains sine (such as fine zinc<br>
wires, sine flakes or polymer fibers coated with sine) and<br>
a second conductive metal that contains silver (such as a<br>
fine silver wires/fibers, silver flakes, or polymer fibers<br>
coated with silver), the cortpositien. generates electric<br>
current and zinc ions within the topical composition.<br>
The composition may additionally contain an active<br>
agent, such as an anti-acne agent (such as ealicylic acid,<br>
benzoyl peroxide, retinoic acid and/or retinol). The<br>
topical composition containing the first mecal and the<br>
second metal is preferably a semi-solid dosage form (such<br>
as a gel, a hydragel, a water-in-oil emulsion, an oil-in-<br>
water emulsion, a cream, a lotion, an ointment, a multi-<br>
emiilsion, a liposome, and/or a microcapsule formulation),<br>
and may contain the aforementioned fluid suspending or<br>
fluid absorbing materials. The topical composition may be<br>
prepaired as such that one of the conductive metal is<br>
formulated in a. separate phase from other conductive<br>
metal, for example, the first conductive metal (e.g., zinc<br>
flakes) is formulated in the discontinuous oil phase of an<br>
oil-in-water emilsian (e.g., a creem), while the secornd<br>
conductive metal (e.g, silver flakes) is formulated in<br>
the continuous aqueous phase of the emulsion. The topical<br>
composition of the present invention may also further<br>
contain a humectant (such as glycerin, propylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, aotbitol and/or urea) and<br>
aforementioned electrolytes to maintain certain moisture<br>
level and conductivity of the skin.<br>
56<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
In one embodiment, during storage of such a topical<br>
composition, the first conductive metal and the second<br>
conduct metal are suspended substantially apart, in a semi—<br>
solid composition (e.g., are not in contact with each<br>
other) . Upon application to the membrane (such as the skin<br>
or mucose) and partial drying of the liquid carrier, the<br>
contact of the first conductive metal and the second<br>
conductive metals results in galvanic couple fonraatioin and<br>
generation of electric current and metal ions of the first<br>
conductive metal, which provides benefits to the membrane<br>
such as antimicrobial, antiinflammation, wound healing,<br>
iontophoretic delivery of active agents, tissue<br>
stimulation, and/or sebum reduction.<br>
In one embodiment, the wires/fibers, flakea of<br>
conductive metals, or polymer fibers coated With the<br>
conductive metals are fine enough that they can be<br>
isuspended in the semi-aolid composations during storage.<br>
In a further embodiment, they are in elongated shapes. The<br>
advantages of elongrated shapes of the conductive metals<br>
(e.g., fine wires/fibets, flakes and polymer fibers coated<br>
with the conductive metals) include a lovrer apparent<br>
density and, therefore, a better floating/snapending<br>
capability in the topical composition; a higher<br>
probability at connected with each other when low<br>
concentrations of the conductive metals are used; and a<br>
wider and deeper range of the membrane tissue (e.g, the<br>
skin) that the galvanic current travels through and<br>
provides the benefits to.<br>
In one embodiment, the first and second conductive<br>
metal particles are formulated into different compositions<br>
and are stored in separate compartments of a, dual chamber<br>
dispensing package. For example, the less chemically<br>
57<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
stable (e.g., more oxidizable)zinc or its alloy<br>
particulates may be formulated in an anhydrous,<br>
essentially non-conductive composition with organic<br>
solvents; such as polyethylene giycols, gropyletie glycol,<br>
glycerin, liquid siliane and/or alcohol, or other<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable organic solvents. The more<br>
chemically Stable (e.g., less oxidxzable) silver and<br>
silver chloride; particulates may be formulated in an<br>
aqueous compositon. The active agents may be formulated<br>
into either composition depending on their chemical<br>
stability and solubility. In use, the compositions are<br>
dispensed from dual chamber package (e.g., dual chamber<br>
pump, tube, pouch, bottle, etc.) and mixed prior or during<br>
application to the skin to form galvanic couples in situ<br>
to generate galvanic current and to treat the skin<br>
conditions.<br>
In another embodiment, the aforementioned, galvanic<br>
couples are manufactured as particuIatee to be<br>
incorporated into topical compositions. The particulates<br>
may be of any shape, including but not limited to,<br>
Spherical or non-spherical particles or elongeted or<br>
flattened shapea (e.g., metal or metal-coated spheres,<br>
hollow metal or metal-coated epheres, short metal-coated<br>
fibere or fabrics, and flakes), regular shapes (e.g.,<br>
metal crystals), and irregular shapes (e.g., aggtegsued<br>
Spheres). In one embodiment, the parciculates have an<br>
average particle size of from about 1 micrometer to about<br>
5 centimeters. What is meant by the particle size the<br>
maximum dimension in at least one direction. In one<br>
embodiment, the particulates have an average particle size<br>
of from about 1 micrometer to about 2 millimsters for non-<br>
elongated shapes. In another embodiment, the particulates<br>
58<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
with elongated shapes have an average particle size from<br>
about 10 micrometers to about 2 centimeters such as from<br>
about 100 micrometerg to about 50 millimeters. For<br>
example, a polymer fiber of about 100 micrometers to about<br>
10 millimeters in length may be coated partially with<br>
silver or silver-silver chloride on one end (or only on<br>
certain portions of the fiber),and zinc on the other end<br>
(or on the remaining portions). In another example, the<br>
polymer fiber is coated completely with the first<br>
conductive metal (e.g., silver-silver oxide or silver-<br>
silver chloride), and one end {or certain portions of the<br>
fiber) is coated with the second conductive metal (e.g.,<br>
zinc or magnesium) .<br>
In practice, silver-coated, polymer fibers<br>
mnufactured by Noble Fiber Technologies, Inc. [Clarks<br>
Summit, PA.) may be coated with zinc using methods such as<br>
conductive sine ink printing, electroplating, electroless<br>
depositior, vacum deposition, and spray coating.<br>
Alternatively, a metallic sine or magnesium particulate<br>
(e.g., bead or thin wire) may be coated at one end or at<br>
certain portions) with silver-silver oxide or silver-<br>
silver chloride. Spherical or non-spherical particles<br>
with an average particle size ranging from about one<br>
micrometer to about 5 millimeters may be partially covered<br>
with the first and second conductive metal coatings in a<br>
similar fashion.<br>
The coating methods for such first and second<br>
conductive metals in preparing the galvanic couples may be<br>
electroless deposition, electric plating, vacuum vapor<br>
deposition, arc spray, conductive metal ink, and other<br>
known metal coating methods commonly used in electronic<br>
and medical device manufacturing processes. The galvanic<br>
59<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
couple particulates ate preferably stored in<br>
aforementioned anhydrous forms, e.g., as a dry powder or<br>
immobilized in a fabric with binding agents, or as at<br>
essentially anhydrous non-conducting origanic solvent<br>
composition (e.g., dissolved in polyethylene ctlycols,<br>
prupylene glycol, glycerin., liquid gilicone, and/or<br>
alcohol) . The galvanic particulstas have great versatility<br>
in applications, and can be used in many consumer and<br>
medical products such as patches, bandages, masks,<br>
garments, cloths, socks, bed sheets (e.g., by immobilized<br>
into the carrier or fabric) , spread -on facial mask<br>
composition (such as a paste, cream or gel), creams,<br>
lotions, gels, shampoos, cleansers, powders, or<br>
incorporated into personal and medical products such as<br>
toothbrushes, dental flosses, wound dressings, diapers,<br>
sanitary napkins, dry wipes, pre-moistured wipes (with<br>
aforementioned anhydrous solvents), tampons, and rclal<br>
and vaginal suppositories. The galvanic particulares may<br>
also be incorporated into transdermal drug delivery<br>
patches to enhance drug penetration into the skin by<br>
iontophoresis and to reduce skin irritation by electrie<br>
stimulation and electrically generated beneficial ions<br>
such as zinc ions.<br>
Example 1: Carriers<br>
Examples of several carriers, including the weight<br>
percentage range of the ingredients of such, carriers, are<br>
set forth in Table 1.<br><br><br>

WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
In order to evaluate the proposed mechanism of action<br>
for the electrochemically generated beneficial agents, an<br>
in vitro inicrobiologic study was conducted to investigabe<br>
effect of electrolysis on p. acne inhibition in certain<br>
electrochemical systems; and an in vivo study was<br>
conducted in human volunteers using e commercial<br>
iontophoresis device,<br>
EXAMPLE 2. In. vitro Inhibition of P. acnes by<br>
Electrolysis<br>
A BacT/ALERT system (BioMerieux, Inc., Durham, Nc)<br>
was used in the P. acnes inhibition experiment. Briefly,<br>
40 ml of an anaerobic casein and soy based broth culture<br>
medium in a bottle (BacT/ALERT SN, Organon Tekniks Corp.,<br>
Durham, NC) was inoculated with P. acnes. The fully<br>
automated BacT/ALERT system was used to detect P. acnes<br>
growth over a 14-day study at 35°C by continuous monitoring<br>
of CO2 production using an optical colorimetric sensory<br>
system. A selected pair of the electrodes (Table 2,<br>
Columns 2 and 3) was disinfected with 70% isopropyl<br>
alcohol, and inserted through the rubber stopper into the<br>
culture medium in a nitrogen glove box. Some electrodes<br>
were connected to the poles of a battery (either 1.5 or 3v<br>
as indicated in Table 2, Column 3) for 30 minutes. The<br>
electrodes more then immediately removed from the<br>
BacT/ALERT bottle, which was then placed into the<br>
automated incubation and monitoring system for two weeks.<br>
Other elscrodes (i.e., Nos. 3 &amp; 5 in Table 2), were not<br>
connected to an external battery, but rather were directly<br>
connected, to each other at their ends outside the<br>
BacT/ALERT bottle to form galvanic couple. The electrodes<br>
of these galvanic couples (i.e., NON. 3 &amp; 5) remained in<br>
62<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
contact with the culture medium in the bottle during the<br>
14-day study.<br>
Zinc as the positive electrode (anode), with various<br>
materials as the negative electrode (cathode) , was<br>
evaluated through the test conditions 1 to 7 (No.l-7 in<br>
Column 1). Column 4 shows the voltage applied to the<br>
conductive electrode by the external battery. However, by<br>
simply connecting two conductive electrode materials, a<br>
voltage was also generated just from the galvanic pair.<br>
For example, zinc-silver/silver chloride galvanic couple<br>
has a voltage of 0.9849V or about IV (zn2+ + 2e- = Zn,<br>
standard potential: -0.7626V, and AgCl + e- = Ag + Cl-,<br>
standard potential: 0.2223V} and zinc-copper- galvanic<br>
couple has a voltage of about 1.1-1.3V (Cu2 +2e- = Cu,<br>
standard potential: 0.340V, and Cu+ + e- = Cu, standard<br>
potential: 0.520V} Reference; Electrochemistry Handbook,<br>
1995, Table 14.1, McGraw-Hill, Inc. New York, NY).<br>
In the test condition No. 7, the electrodes {i.e.,<br>
zinc-silver/silver chloride galvanic couple) were taken<br>
from a commercial iontophoresis device (lontoPatch, Sp,<br>
Birch Point Medical, Inc., Oakdale, MN) . The lontoPatch is<br>
an iontophoresis device powered by a galvanic couple<br>
battery strip made of zinc and silver/silver chloride in<br>
a bandage-like device. In this experiment, the "battery<br>
strip" in the Iontopatch was taken out of the bandage-like<br>
device, and placed into the BacT/ALERT bottle. The<br>
electrodes of the commercial zinc-silver/silver chloride<br>
galvanic couple (NO- 7) remained in the BacT/ALERT bottle<br>
through out the entire two-week experiments. Test<br>
conditions of Noa. 15-27 were positive controls (i.e.,<br>
without electrodes) : Test condition No.15 used a<br>
concentrated P. acne culture that was used to inoculate<br>
63<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
the rast of the culture medium in each EaeT/ALERT bottle<br>
to P. acmes counts of 106 per ml and Test conditions No. 16<br>
and No.17 used, the inoculated culture mediura of P. acnes<br>
counts or 105 per ml (with the rubbed stoppers of No.16<br>
additionally being punctured in a way similar to the rest<br>
of electrode-tested conditions in order to eliminate any<br>
false p.acnes inhibition results due to potential<br>
enviromental oxygen entry into the test bottle and<br>
affecting anaerobic P. acnes growth).<br><br>

WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
positive P. acnes growth probably due bacterial <br>
centamination, see Note C of Table 2) . The copper anode<br>
was also found to significantly inhibit P acnes growth<br>
(Nos, 8-9) . Under Lhese experimental conditions, the<br>
platinum anode shewed little P. acne inhibition affect and<br>
the silver or silver/silver chloride anodes provided only<br>
a weak P, acne inhibition. Since all the positive control<br>
(renditions (N0s. 15-17) showed positive P. acnes growth<br>
less than two days after the beginning of the study, the<br>
negative F. acnes growth can be attributed, to the<br>
inhibition effect of the electracheraically generated<br>
species or electric current passage through, the culture<br>
medium. Because electric current passage in NOS. 10-14<br>
failed to show strong P. acnes inhibition as those in Nos.<br>
1-9, the observed bacterial inhibition in Nos. 1-9 were<br>
likely due to certain electrochemical reactions occurred<br>
at the anode, namely, when zinc and copper were used as<br>
the anode. It was also unexpected that the silver ions<br>
released; from silver or silver/silver chloride anode under<br>
these expearimental conditions failed to show the same P,<br>
acnes inhibition (Nos. 12-14) , since silver ion is well-<br>
known anti-microbial agent. See. e.g., Spacciapoli et<br>
al. ("Antimicrobia) activity of silver nitrate againts<br>
periodontal pathogens.", J Periodontal RSE 36: 2, 103-13,<br>
Apr, 2001) . It was surprising that, in the absence or<br>
external battery {Nos. 3, 5 and 7), a pair of electrodes<br>
of galvanic couple with sine as anode were sufficient to<br>
inhibit P-acnes growth during the entire two week Study •<br>
EXAMPLE 3- In vitro Electrode-salicyljc acid compatibility<br>
The following experiment was conducted to determine<br>
the compatibility of electrodes with salicylic acid. A<br>
66<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
pair of test electrodes was immersed in 5 ml oE 1.5%<br>
salicylic acid solution (solvent 50% ethanol/ 50% water).<br>
A pre-determined voltage was applied to the electrodes (by<br>
connecting the electrodes to a battery or batteries) for<br>
certain length of time as indicated in Table 3.<br>
Observations were made on color change of the test<br>
solution.<br>
The solution with the sine anode showed no<br>
discoloration, indicating good compatibility with<br>
salicylic acid during the passage of electric current.<br>
Use of the platinum anode unexpectedly resulted in<br>
discoloration, indicating incompatibility with salicylic<br>
acid under this experimental condition.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4: In vivo human iontophoresis stuudy<br>
An in vivo study was conducted in human volunteers<br>
using a commercial iontophoresis device (IontoPatch*,<br>
Model: SP, Birch Point Medical Inc., North Oakdale, MN).<br>
The study recruilted the healthy female volunteers with<br>
67<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
oily skin, aged from 20-45 years. The sebumeter reading<br>
from each subject's forehead was at least greater than 150<br>
mg/cm2/hr . The study was blind and controlled. Briefly,<br>
an iontoPatch® with a voltage of 1 volt , an operating<br>
current of 0.06 mA; and an active treatment area of 1.25<br>
in2, was applied to the treatment site of the human subject<br>
(e.g. fotehead}. The positive electrode and negative<br>
consisted of zinc and silver/silver chloride<br>
(Ag/AgCl) material, respectively. Both, electrodes were<br>
filled with saline (0.9% NaCl). As soon as the saline<br>
solution was added into the different electrodes, the<br>
electric patch begin to function. The patch was left on<br>
the treatment area overnight {e.g., approximately 8<br>
hours).<br>
The following evaluations were conducted: (i) the<br>
effects of electrolysis on the skin condition were<br>
monitored using a normal photography and (ii) The change<br>
in p. acnes counts was determined through analyzing the<br>
cup wash solution for the treatment site before and after<br>
wearing the patch overnight.The cup wash micro sampling<br>
procedure was performed as follows; a cylindrical cup (2.1<br>
cm diameter and 2.5 cm height) having two open ends was<br>
fastened onto the treatment area. The treatment area<br>
inside the cylinder was then washed with 3 ml of cleansing<br>
buffer (eterile 0.075M Phosphate Buffer containing 0.1%<br>
Triton X-ioo) while the same area with a sterile polished<br>
glass. The wash solution was then collected. This<br>
washing procedure was then repeated. The two collected<br>
samples were pooled and used in the P-acnes aanalysis<br>
The p. acnes counts were determined by Spiral Plating<br>
the scrub samples anaerohically in Actinomyces Agar for 5<br>
days, and the predominant contaminants on the spiral<br>
68<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
plates were Gram stained and identified using the VITEK<br>
system Using an automated colnny counter, the P-acne<br>
count per mL of each sample Durtsr was determined.<br>
After only one overnight patch application, P. acne<br>
quantification measurment an the treatment area shows a<br>
45% p, acne reduction relative to the baseline under the<br>
sine anode and 30% under the Ag/AgCl cathode. After four<br>
consecutive overnight patch applications, photo images<br>
displayed the clear evidences of significant reduction in<br>
the color and size of post-acne hyperpigmentation apot<br>
under the zinc electrode. This test subject had a post-<br>
ache hypeipigmentation spot at the test akin site. The<br>
sppeaiance of the hypexpigmented spot was improved from a<br>
very dark color to a lighter color.<br>
Also, after four consecutive overnight patch<br>
applications, photo images also displayed the evidence of<br>
significant reduction in the color and size of an acne<br>
pimple under the Ag/AgCl electrode. This test subject had<br>
an acne pimple at the test skin site. The redness of the<br>
pimple was rapidly reduced from very red color to became<br>
almost invisible while the pimples at the non-treated skin<br>
area remained largely unchanged.<br>
EXAMPLE 5:In vivo human iontophoresis study using<br>
histamine hidrochloride as marker<br>
An in vivo study was conducted in three human<br>
volunteers using a galvanic sine-silver/silver oxide<br>
device to deliver histamine hydrocholoride as a marker into<br>
the skin. Histamine-induced skin erythema and itchinees<br>
were recorded during and after- the study. The study<br>
recruited two healthy male and one female volunteers with<br>
ages ranging 41 to 49 years. The galvanic devices were<br>
69<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
prepared by cutting a thin Zinc foil (0.25mm thick, Alfa<br>
Aesar, word Hill, MA) into rectangular piece (2.5cm wide &amp;<br>
3cm long) - A silver ink {Silver Print, M.G- Chemicals,<br>
Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was painted onto one side of the<br>
sine foil as a 0.5cm wide stripe along the long-axis at<br>
the center. The ink Was air-dried to produce the silver<br>
eletyode stripe on the zinc foil. Two rectangular<br>
adhesive Scotch® tape stripes of 0.5cm wide and 3cm long<br>
were placed on the both sides of the silver electrode<br>
stripe creating an electric insulating gap on the surface<br>
(electrode gap = 0.5cm). A rectangular piece of nonwoven<br>
fabric (50% Rayon/50% PET, 75 gsm, PGI Polymer Group Inc. ,<br>
Landisville, NJ) of 3cm wide and 3.5cm long was placed<br>
over the zinc-silver electrode side of the zinc foil. A<br>
rectangular adhesive backing film of 4cm wide and 5cm long<br>
was affixed to the opposite side of the zinc foil to<br>
complete the zinc-silver galvanic device.<br>
A second type of the zinc-silver galvanic device<br>
without and electric insulating gap on the<br>
surface (electrode gap = 0cm) was prepared by simply<br>
omitting the addition of the adhesive Scotch® tape. A<br>
third type (control) patch was prepared by using only the<br>
zinc foil, the nonwoven pad, and the adhesive backing film<br>
to construct the device.<br>
To begin histamine iontohorasis, o.8ml aquepua<br>
solution of 0.1% histamine hydrochloride (sigma-Aldrich,<br>
St. Louis, Mo) was added to each device, which was then<br>
affixed to the forearm skin of each volunteer for 30<br>
minutes.<br>
At the end of the study, red spots (histamine induced<br>
erythema) appeared under both zinc-silver galvanic patch<br>
devices, which disappeared within about one half hour. A<br>
70<br><br>
WO2005/004982	PCT/US2004/020271<br>
close examination showed the red spots around the hair<br>
follicles. There was also itchiness reported at the<br>
galvanic patch sites reported during the patch<br>
application. In contrast, there were no change in skin<br>
color under, nor any itchiness reported with, the control<br>
patch devices.<br>
EXAMPLE 6: In vivo human iontophoresis study using<br>
histamine_hydrochloride with a galvanic nose patch<br>
comprising zinc mesh<br>
As a continuation of the human in vivo study in the<br>
previotis example, a galvanic patch device (designated here<br>
as "Test Device D" ) comprising a zinc mesh (diamond<br>
openings of lcm long &amp; 0.4cm wide, Exmet Corporation,<br>
Naug attick, CT) instead of sine foil was prepared with the<br>
same dimension and procedure as the galvanic device (gap<br>
electrode = 0) in EXAMPLE 5. The device thus prepared<br>
Resembled to the design shown in FIG. 11 with three<br>
parallel electrodes the silver electrode in the center<br>
and sine electrodes on both sides. Two male volunteers<br>
participated this study using a similar test conditions as<br>
in EXAMPE 5. One Test Device containing 0.8 ml of 0.1%<br>
histamine hydrochloride was applied to the nose of each<br>
volmitee for 30 minutes. It chiness was reported within 5<br>
minutes of the nose patch application, indicating rapid<br>
delivery of histamine into the relatively larger skin<br>
pores on the nose. For both test subjects, pronounced<br>
erythema was observed at the akin site under the nose<br>
patch after patch removal at the end of the study, in<br>
comparison to the study conducted on the forearm skin.<br>
