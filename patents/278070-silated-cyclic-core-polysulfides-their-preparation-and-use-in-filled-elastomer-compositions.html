FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to silated cyclic core polysulfides compositions, process for their preparation, and rubber compositions comprising same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sulfur-containing coupling agents used for mineral-filled elastomers involve silanes in which two alkoxysilylalkyl groups are bound, each to one end of a chain of sulfur atoms. The two alkoxysilyl groups are bonded to the chain of sulfur atoms by two similar, and in most cases, identical, hydrocarbon fragments. The general silane structures just described, hereinafter referred to as "simple bis polysulfide silanes," usually contain a chain of three methylene groups as the two mediating hydrocarbon units. In some cases, the methylene chain is shorter, containing only one or two methylenes per chain. The use of these compounds is primarily as coupling agents for mineral-filled elastomers. These coupling agents function by chemically bonding silica or other mineral fillers to polymer when used in rubber applications. Coupling is accomplished by chemical bond formation between the silane sulfur and the polymer and by hydrolysis of the alkoxysilyl groups and subsequent condensation with silica hydroxyl groups. The reaction of the silane sulfur with the polymer occurs when the S-S bonds are broken and the resulting fragment adds to the polymer. A single linkage to the polymer occurs for each silyl group bonded to the silica. This linkage contains a single, relatively weak C-S and/or S-S bond(s) that forms the weak link between the polymer and the silica. Under high stress, this single C-S and/or S-S linkages may break and therefore contribute to wear of the filled elastomer.<br>
The use of polysulfide silanes coupling agents in the preparation of rubber is well known. These silanes contain two silicon atoms, each of which is bound to a<br>
3<br>
<br>
 <br>
disubstituted hydrocarbon group, and three other groups of which at least one is removable from silicon by hydrolysis. Two such hydrocarbon groups, each with their bound silyl group, are further bound to each end of a chain of at least two sulfur atoms. These structures thus contain two silicon atoms and a single, continuous chain of sulfur atoms of variable length.<br>
Hydrocarbon core polysulfide silanes that feature a central molecular core isolated from the silicon in the molecule by sulfur-sulfur bonds are known in the art. Polysufide silanes containing a core that is an aminoalkyl group separated from the silicon atom by a single sulfur and a polysulfide group and where the polysulfide group is bonded to the core at a secondary carbon atom are also know in the art. As well as core fragments in which only two polysulfide groups are attached to the core.<br>
When the polysulfide groups are attached directly to an aromatic core, the reactivity with the polymer (rubber) is reduced. The aromatic core is sterically bulky which inhibits the reaction. Compositions in which the polysulfides are attached directly to cyclic aliphatic fragments derived by vinyl cyclohexene contain more than one silated core and form large rings. The cyclohexyl core is sterically more hindered than the aromatic core and is less reactive. Although these compositions can form more than one sulfur linkage to the polymer rubber for each attachment of the coupling agent to the silica through the silyl group, their effectiveness is low due to the low reactivity.<br>
The low reactivity is due to the attachment of the polysulfide to the secondary carbon of cyclic core structure. The positioning of the polysulfide group is not optimal for reaction with the accelerators and reaction with the polymer.<br>
The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the aforementioned compositions involving silane coupling agents in several ways. The silanes of the present invention described herein are not limited to two silyl groups nor to one chain of sulfur atoms. In fact the molecular architecture in which multiple polysulfide chains are oriented in a noncollinear configuration (i.e. branched, in the sense that the branch points occur within the carbon backbone interconnecting the polysulfide chains) is novel.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
The silanes of the present invention have advantages over that in the prior art by providing a means to multiple points of sulfur attachment to polymer per point of silicon attachment to filler. The silanes described herein may be asymmetric with regard to the groups on the two ends of the sulfur chains. The silyl groups, rather than occurring at the ends of the molecule, tend to occur more centrally and are chemically bonded to the cyclic core through carbon-carbon, carbon-sulfur and carbon-silicon bonds. The carbon-sulfur bonds of the thio ester linkages (sulfide) are more stable than the sulfur- sulfur bonds of the disulfide or polysulfide functional groups- These thio ether groups are therefore less likely to react with the accelerators and curing agents or to decompose when subjected to high shear or temperatures normally associated with the mixing and curing of rubber compounds. The thio ether linkage also provides a convenient synthetic route for making the silanes of the present invention. The cyclic core also contains multiple polysulfide groups that are attached to ring by means of a divalent, straight chain alkylene group. The attachment of the polysulfide group to the primary carbon of the alkylene group decreases significantly the steric hinderance of the core, and increases the reactivity of the polysulfides with the polymer. In addition, the cyclic core orients these alkylene chains containing the polysulfide groups away from each other to further reduce the steric hindrance near the polysulfide groups. This distinction is what allows silica to become and remain bonded (through the intermediacy of a sequence of covalent chemical bonds) to polymer at multiple points using the silanes of the present invention.<br>
The examples presented herein demonstrate that the silanes of the present invention impart a desirable balance of physical properties (performance to mineral-filled elastomer compositions) and better wear characteristics to articles manufactured from these elastomers. Improvements in rolling resistance are also apparent for elastomers used in tire applications.<br>

In another embodiment, 30 to 99 weight percent of the silated cyclic core polysulfide of the present invention is blended with 70 to 1 weight percent of another silane, including silanes of the structure represented in Formula (4)<br>

 <br>
group having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and includes branched or straight chain alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or aralkyl group and X2 and X3 is chosen independently taken from the group consisting of hydrogen, the members listed above for R6, the members listed above for X1 and -OSi containing groups that result from the condensation of silanols. Representative examples of the silane described by Formula 4 are listed in U. S. Patent 3,842,111 and include bis- (3-triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide; bis-(3-triethoxysilyIpropyl) trisulfide; bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide, bis-(3-triethoxysilyIpropyI) pentasulfide; bis-(3-diethoxymethylsilylpropyl) disulfide; bis-(3-ethoxydimethylsilylpropyl) disulfide; bis- (triethoxysilylmethyl) disulfide; bis-(4-triethoxysiIylbenzyl) disulfide; bis-(3-triethoxysilylphenyl) disulfide and the like.<br>
The bonding of sulfur to a methylene group on R4 and R5 is required because the methylene group mitigates excessive steric interactions between the silane and the filler and polymer. Two successive methylene groups mitigate steric interactions even further and also add flexibility to the chemical structure of the silane, thereby enhancing its ability to accommodate the positional and orientational constraints imposed by the morphologies of the surfaces of both the rubber and filler at the interphase, at the molecular level. The silane flexibility becomes increasingly important as the total number of silicon and sulfur atoms bound to G1 and G2 increases from 3 to 4 and beyond. Structures in which the polysulfide group is bonded directly to secondary and tertiary carbon atoms, ring structures, especially aromatic structures, are rigid and sterically hindered. The accelerators and curatives cannot readily orient themselves with the polysulfide group to affect reaction and the silated cyclic core polysulfide cannot readily orient itself to meet available binding sites on silica and polymer. This would tend to leave sulfur groups unbound to polymer, thereby reducing the efficiency by which the principle of multiple bonding of silane to polymer via multiple sulfur groups on silane, is realized.<br>
The use of a sulfide group to attach the silyl group to the core, -S-R2SiX1X2X3, provides a convenient and cost effective way to bond the silyl group to the core. The sulfide group is less reactive than the polysulfide groups of the present invention and therefore is less likely to be broken during the curing of the rubbers containing the silated cyclic core polysulfides. The sulfide linkage of the silyl group to the core also makes it easier synthesize molecules with different lengths of the R2 relative to R1 and R3 and therefore to optimize the chemical structure of the silated cyclic core polysulfides to achieve bonding between the inorganic filler, such as silica, and the rubber.<br>
15<br>
 <br>
The function of the other silanes in the blend are to occupy sites on the surface of the silica which aid in dispersing the silica and coupling with the polymer.<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARING SILATED CYCLIC CORE POLYSULFIDES<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the silated cyclic core polysulfides are prepared by (a) reacting a thioacid with the structure, R6C(=O)SH with a hydrocarbon containing reactive double bonds; (b) deblocking the mercapto group using a proton donator; (c) reacting the intermediate mercaptan in step b with a base and then a halo containing hydrocarbon silane; (d) reacting the intermediate mercapto silane from step c with a base and sulfur; (e) reacting the imtermediate in step d with a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon containing a leaving group selected from chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>

In one embodiment of the present invention, a rubber composition comprising:<br>
(a)	the silated cyclic core polysulfide of the present invention (Formula 1);<br>
(b)	inorganic filler; and,<br>
(c)	rubber.<br>

The rubbers useful with the coupling agents described herein include sulfur vulcanizable rubbers including conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers, and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound. Suitable organic polymers for preparation of rubber compositions are well known in the art and are described in various textbooks including The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook, Ohm, R.F., R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc., 1990 and in the Manual for the Rubber Industry, Kemperman, T and Koch, S. Jr., Bayer AG, LeverKusen, 1993.<br>
One example of a suitable polymer for use herein is solution-prepared styrene-butadiene rubber (sSBR). In one embodiment of the invention, the solution prepared sSBR has a bound styrene content in a range of about 5 to about 50 weight percent. In another embodiment of the invention, the solution prepared sSBR has a bound styrene content in a range of about 9 to about 36 weight percent. Other useful polymers include emulsion-prepared styrene-butadiene rubber (eSBR), natural rubber (NR), ethylene-propylene copolymers and terpolymers (EP, EPDM), acrylonitrile- butadiene rubber (NBR), polybutadiene (BR); and so forth.<br>
In another embodiment, the rubber composition is comprised of at least one diene-based elastomer, or rubber. Suitable conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, isoprene and 1,3-butadiene and suitable vinyl aromatic compounds include, but are not limited to, styrene and alpha methyl styrene. Polybutadiene may be characterized as existing primarily, typically about 90% by weight, in the cis-1,4-butadiene form, but other compositions may also be used for the purposes described herein.<br>
Thus, the rubber is a sulfur curable rubber. Such diene based elastomer, or rubber,<br>
may be selected, for example, from at least one of cis-l,4-po!yisoprene rubber<br>
(natural and/or synthetic), emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene<br>
copolymer rubber, organic solution polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene<br>
rubber,	3,4-polyisoprene	rubber,	isoprene/butadiene	rubber,<br>
styrene/isoprene/butadiene  terpolymer   rubber,   cis-l,4-polybutadiene,   medium<br>

 <br>
vinyl polybutadiene rubber (35-50 percent vinyl), high vinyl polybutadiene rubber<br>
(50-75 percent vinyl), styrene/isoprene copolymers, emulsion polymerization<br>
prepared	styrene/ butadiene/ acrylonitrile	terpolymer	rubber	and<br>
butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubber. In one embodiment of the invention, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (eSBR) having a relatively conventional styrene content of about 20 to about 28 percent bound styrene is used. In another embodiment, an eSBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content of about 30 to about 45 percent may be used.<br>
Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile terpolymer rubbers containing from about 2 to about 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this invention.<br>
A particulate filler may also be added to the crosslinkable elastomer compositions of the present invention including siliceous fillers, carbon black, and so forth. The filler materials useful herein include, but are not limited to, metal oxides such as silica (pyrogenic and/or precipitated), titanium dioxide, aluminosilicate and alumina, clays and talc, carbon black, and so forth.<br>
Particulate, precipitated silica is also sometimes used for such purpose, particularly when the silica is used in conjunction with a silane. hi some cases, a combination of silica and carbon black is utilized for reinforcing fillers for various rubber products, including treads for tires. Alumina can be used either alone or in combination with silica. The term, alumina, can be described herein as aluminum oxide, or A12O3he fillers may be hydrated or in anhydrous form.<br>
The silated cyclic core polysulfide silane(s) may be premixed or pre-reacted with the filler particles, or added to the rubber mix during the rubber and filler processing, or mixing stages. If the silated cyclic core polysulfide silanes and filler are added separately to the rubber mix during the rubber and filler mixing, or processing stage, it is considered that the silated cyclic core polysulfide silane(s) then combine(s) in an in-situ fashion with the filler.<br>
The vulcanized rubber composition should contain a sufficient amount of filler to contribute a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. In one embodiment of the present invention, the combined weight of the filler may be as<br>
19<br>
 <br>
low as about 5 to about 100 parts by weight per hundred parts rubber (phr). In another embodiment, the combined weight of the filler is from about 25 to about 85 phr and at least one precipitated silica is utilized as a filler. The silica may be characterized by having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, in the range of about 40 to about 600 m2/g. In another embodiment of the invention, the silica has a BET surface area in a range of about 50 to about 300 m2/g. The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the Tournal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930). The silica typically may also be characterized by having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of about 100 to about 350, and more usually about 150 to about 300. Further, the silica, as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate, may be expected to have a CTAB surface area in a range of about 100 to about 220. The CTAB surface area is the external surface area as evaluated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of about 9. The method is described in ASTM D 3849.<br>
Mercury porosity surface area is the specific surface area determined by mercury porosimetry. Using this method, mercury is penetrated into the pores of the sample after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. Set up conditions may be suitably described as using a 100 mg sample; removing volatiles during 2 hours at 105 ยฐC and ambient atmospheric pressure; ambient to 2000 bars pressure measuring range. Such evaluation may be performed according to the method described in Winslow, Shapiro in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DDSf 66133. For such an evaluation, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 might be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the silica should be in a range of 100 to 300 m2/g.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a suitable pore size distribution for the silica, alumina and aluminosilicate according to such mercury porosity evaluation is considered herein to be such that five percent or less of its pores have a diameter of less than about 10 ran, about 60 to about 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 10 to about 100 run, about 10 to about 30 percent of its pores have a diameter at about 100 to about 1,000nm, and about 5 to about 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than about 1,000 nm.<br>
In another embodiment, the silica might be expected to have an average ultimate particle size, for example, in the range of about 10 to about 50 nm as determined by the electron microscope, although the silica particles may be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas may be considered for use in this invention such as, from PPG Industries under the HI-SIL trademark with designations HI-SIL 210, 243, etc.; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for<br>
20<br>
<br>
 <br>
example, designation of ZEOSIL 1165MP; silicas available from Degussa with, for example, designations VN2 and VN3, etc. and silicas commercially available from Huber having, for example, a designation of HUBERSEL7 8745.<br>
In still another embodiment, the compositions may utilize siliceous fillers such as silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicates in combination with carbon black reinforcing pigments. The compositions may comprise a filler mix of about 15 to about 95 weight percent of the siliceous filler, and about 5 to about 85 weight percent carbon black, wherein the carbon black has a CTAB value in a range of 80 to 150. More typically, it is desirable to use a weight ratio of siliceous fillers to carbon black of at least about 3/1, and preferably at least about 10/1. The weight ratio may range from about 3/1 to about 30/1 for siliceous fillers to carbon black.<br>
In another embodiment, the filler can be comprised of about 60 to about 95 weight percent of said silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicate and, correspondingly, about 40 to about 5 weight percent carbon black. The siliceous filler and carbon black may be pre-blended or blended together in the manufacture of the vulcanized rubber.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the rubber compositions of the present invention are prepared by mixing one or more of the silated cyclic core polysulfide silanes with the organic polymer before, during or after the compounding of the filler into the organic polymer. In another embodiment, the silated cyclic core polysulfide silanes are added before or during the compounding of the filler into the organic polymer, because these silanes facilitate and improve the dispersion of the filler. In another embodiment, the total amount of silated cyclic core polysulfide silane present in the resulting combination should be about 0.05 to about 25 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of rubber (phr); and 1 to 10 phr in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, fillers can be used in quantities ranging from about 5 to about 100 phr, and still in another embodiment from about 25 to about 80 phr.<br>
In practice, sulfur vulcanized rubber products typically are prepared by thermomechanically mixing rubber and various ingredients in a sequentially stepยฌwise manner followed by shaping and curing the compounded rubber to form a vulcanized product. First, for the aforesaid mixing of the rubber and various ingredients, typically exclusive of sulfur and sulfur vulcanization accelerators (collectively, curing agents), the rubber(s) and various rubber compounding ingredients typically are blended in at least one, and often (in the case of silica filled<br>
21<br>
 <br>
low rolling resistance tires) two or more, preparatory thermomechanical mixing stage(s) in suitable mixers. Such preparatory mixing is referred to as nonproductive mixing or non-productive mixing steps or stages. Such preparatory mixing usually is conducted at temperatures of about 140ยฐC to 200ยฐC, and for some compositions, about 150ยฐC to 180ยฐC Subsequent to such preparatory mixing stages, in a final mixing stage, sometimes referred to as a productive mixing stage, curing agents, and possibly one or more additional ingredients, are mixed with the rubber compound or composition, at lower temperatures of typically about 50ยฐC to 130ยฐC in order to prevent or retard premature curing of the sulfur curable rubber, sometimes referred to as scorching. The rubber mixture, also referred to as a rubber compound or composition, typically is allowed to cool, sometimes after or during a process intermediate mill mixing, between the aforesaid various mixing steps, for example, to a temperature of about 50ยฐC or lower. When it is desired to mold and to cure the rubber, the rubber is placed into the appropriate mold at a temperature of at least about 130ยฐC and up to about 200ยฐC which will cause the vulcanization of the rubber by the S-S bond- containing groups (i.e., disulfide, trisulfide, tetrasulfide, etc.; polysulfide) on the silated cyclic core polysulfide silanes and any other free sulfur sources in the rubber mixture.<br>
Thermomechanical mixing refers to the phenomenon whereby under the high shear conditions in a rubber mixer, the shear forces and associated friction occurring as a result of mixing the rubber compound, or some blend of the rubber compound itself and rubber compounding ingredients in the high shear mixer, the temperature autogeneously increases, i.e. it "heats up". Several chemical reactions may occur at various steps in the mixing and curing processes.<br>
The first reaction is a relatively fast reaction and is considered herein to take place between the filler and the silicon alkoxide group of the silated cyclic core polysulfides. Such reaction may occur at a relatively low temperature such as, for example, at about 120ยฐC. The second reaction is considered herein to be the reaction which takes place between the sulfur-containing portion of the silated cyclic core polysulfide silane, and the sulfur vulcanizable rubber at a higher temperature; for example, above about 140ยฐC.<br>
Another sulfur source may be used, for example, in the form of elemental sulfur, such as but not limited to S8 A sulfur donor is considered herein as a sulfur containing compound which liberates free, or elemental sulfur, at a temperature in a range of 140ยฐC to 190ยฐC. Such sulfur donors may be, for example, although are not limited to, polysulfide vulcanization accelerators and organosilane polysulfides with<br>
22<br>
<br>
 <br>
at least two connecting sulfur atoms in its polysulfide bridge. The amount of free sulfur source addition to the mixture can be controlled or manipulated as a matter of choice relatively independently from the addition of the aforesaid silated cyclic core polysulfide silane. Thus, for example, the independent addition of a sulfur source may be manipulated by the amount of addition thereof and by the sequence of addition relative to the addition of other ingredients to the rubber mixture.<br>
In one embodimentof the invention, the rubber composition may therefore comprise about 100 parts by weight of at least one sulfur vulcanizable rubber selected from the group consisting of conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers, and copolymers of at. least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound, about 5 to about 100 parts, preferably about 25 to about 80 parts per hundred parts by weight per 100 parts by weight rubber of at least one particulate filler, up to about 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight rubber of a curing agent, and about 0.05 to about 25 parts per hundred parts of polymer of at least one silated cyclic core polysulfide silane as described in the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the filler comprises from about 1 to about 85 weight percent carbon black based on the total weight of the filler and 0 to about 20 parts by weight of at least one silated cyclic core polysulfide silane based on the total weight of the filler.<br>
In still another embodiment, the rubber composition is prepared by first blending rubber, filler and silated cyclic core polysulfide silane, or rubber, filler pretreated with all or a portion of the silated cyclic core polysulfide silane and any remaining silated cyclic core polysulfide silane, in a first thermomechanical mixing step to a temperature of about 140ยฐC to about 200ยฐC for about 2 to about 20 minutes. In another embodiment, filler prerreated with all or a portion of the silated cyclic core polysulfide silane and any remaining silated cyclic core polysulfide silane, in a first thermomechanical mixing step to a temperature of about 140ยฐC to about 200ยฐC for about 4 to 15 minutes. Optionally, the curing agent is then added in another thermomechanical mixing step at a temperature of about 50 ยฐC and mixed for about 1 to about 30 minutes. The temperature is then heated again to between about 130ยฐC and about 20QยฐC and curing is accomplished in about 5 to about 60 minutes.<br>
In another embodiment, the process may also comprise the additional steps of preparing an assembly of a tire or sulfur vulcanizable rubber with a tread comprised<br>
23<br>
 <br>
of the rubber composition prepared according to this invention and vulcanizing the assembly at a temperature in a range of 130ยฐC to 200ยฐC<br>

In another embodiment, the silated cyclic core polysulfide of the present invention may be loaded on a carrier, or filler, such as, for example, a porous polymer, carbon black, silica or the like, so that they are in a dry free flowing form for convenient delivery to rubber, hi one embodiment, the carrier would be part of the inorganic filler to be used in the rubber.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a dry free flowing composition comprises the silated cyclic core polysulfides in accordance with this invention in admixture with one or more of the aforesaid carrier materials, e.g., in a weight ratio of from about 0.1 to about 60 weight percent. The BET surface area of such carriers as silica can vary widely and in one embodiment can vary from about 100m2/g to about 300m2/g. Another property of such carriers is their DOP adsorption, an oil adsorption index. In the case of nonporous carriers such as silica, the DOP adsorption can range from about l00ml/100gm about 400ml/100gm. Porous carriers such as foamed polyolefins can advantageously absorb from about 10ml to about 250ml/100gm(from about 9 to about 70 weight percent) of the silane of the present invention.<br>
The filler can be essentially inert to the silane with which it is admixed as is the case with carbon black or organic polymers, or it can be reactive therewith, e.g., the case with carriers possessing metal hydroxyl surface functionality, e.g., silicas and other silaceous particulates which possess surface silanol functionality.<br>
