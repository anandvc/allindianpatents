Book-type document, in particular an identification<br>
document<br>
The invention relates. to a bock-type document, in<br>
particular an identification document or document of<br>
value, such as passports, book-type personal<br>
identification papers, drivers' licenses, provisional<br>
personal documents, security documents, access<br>
authorizations or the like, comprising a book binding<br>
and paper and/or plastic internal pages accommodated<br>
therein.<br>
The internal pages are fixed to the end paper or to the<br>
inner cover page by means of a seam. The end paper or<br>
the inner cover page is joined to the book binding. In<br>
the case of identification documents, the internal.<br>
pages comprise at least one personalization data page,<br>
on which the most important personal data and the image<br>
of the holder are arranged for identification. Further<br>
data can contain entries relating to the holder or free<br>
regions for subsequent entries. These personalization<br>
data pages are provided with a laminate layer on a<br>
front side and a rear side in order to form a laminate<br>
layer covering.<br>
<br>
The further internal pages are normally formed of paper<br>
and are used for the application of stamps and visas.<br>
The personalization data pages are stitched together<br>
with the further internal pages and adhesively bonded<br>
to the book binding as the book content. This<br>
embodiment has the disadvantage that, in terms of<br>
fabrication, a large number of operations are necessary<br>
in order to apply the laminate layers and to form a<br>
completely enclosed laminate layer covering.<br>
Furthermore, the formation of the fold region of such a<br>
laminate layer covering in the seam area of the book<br>
content is threatened by cracking or fracture by the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273		PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 2 -<br>
flexible stressing and is relatively rigid in the fold<br>
region.<br>
There is in principle considerable interest in<br>
protecting book-type documents, in particular<br>
identification documents, against forgeries and in<br>
making the production of forgeries technically<br>
impossible or at least unprofitable. At the same time,<br>
there is considerable interest in carrying out the<br>
production of documents of value inexpensively.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of<br>
providing a book-type document, in particular an<br>
identification document, in which a high degree of<br>
security against forgery is provided with low<br>
production costs.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
a book-type document, in particular an identification<br>
document, according to the features of the main claim.<br>
Further advantageous refinements and developments of<br>
the invention are specified in the further dependent<br>
claims.<br>
By means of the configuration according to the<br>
invention of a book-type document, in particular an<br>
identification document, in which the at least one<br>
carrier system is stitched to at least one data page<br>
and the carrier system is formed as a pre-laminate,<br>
which can be treated by printing on at least one side<br>
and is provided as a personalization data page or as an<br>
end paper for the book binding or book cover, a<br>
reduction in the production costs is achieved by the<br>
reduction in the production steps. By using a pre-<br>
laminate as end product which merely still has to be<br>
printed, further processing steps, such as the<br>
application of laminate layers, can be dispensed with<br>
and, at the same time, the security requirements for<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 3 -<br>
forestalling forgeries can be maintained. By means of<br>
the carrier system, which can be treated by printing on<br>
at least one side, the pre-laminate can be printed and<br>
personalized as a personalization data page or end<br>
paper. Thus, for example, document or passport blanks<br>
can be produced inexpensively in which, for the purpose<br>
of fabrication, the carrier system is treated by<br>
printing for the purpose of personalization as required<br>
and the transponder unit is stored a selected data set<br>
of holders of the document. The introduction of the<br>
carrier system into the book-type document as a pre-<br>
larinate can be provided both for a personalization<br>
data page and for an end paper for the book binding or<br>
book cover, which means that various structures are<br>
made possible in book-type documents whilst maintaining<br>
the security requirements and inexpensive production.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, provision is made for the carrier system<br>
provided as a pre-laminate to have a carrier layer to<br>
accommodate at least one transponder unit and at least<br>
one layer covering the transponder unit, which are non-<br>
detachably connected to each other. This ensures that<br>
manipulation by separating a top or carrier layer and<br>
removal or replacement of the transponder unit is<br>
prevented. The non-detachable connection can be made<br>
possible by means of cold or hot adhesive bonding,<br>
lamination, welding and/or a chemical reaction to form<br>
the at least partly material connection. Likewise, a<br>
non detachable connection consists in separation of the<br>
carrier layer or of the top layer causing fragmentation<br>
on account of the structuring of one layer, in the<br>
event that an attempt is made to separate the top layer<br>
from the carrier layer or vice versa.<br>
In order to form a seam area that can be folded well in<br>
the book-type document, provision is advantageously<br>
made for the carrier system provided as a pre-laminate<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 4 -<br>
to comprise a region having only one layer which, when<br>
the carrier system is introduced or arranged in the<br>
book-type document, is assigned to the seam area. As a<br>
result, the risk of fracture under bending can be<br>
5minimized considerably. In addition, a reduction of<br>
the thickness in the fold region can be achieved. The<br>
layer accommodating the transponder unit is preferably<br>
provided in the seam area, and the top layer is<br>
provided with a punched-out region or the top layer<br>
ends before the seam. area.<br>
The carrier system provided as a pre-laminate, which is<br>
used as a personalization data page, advantageously has<br>
a flap opposite the seam area or a complete data page.<br>
As a result of the at least one surface that can be<br>
treated by printing, the pre-laminate has the same<br>
function as a data page and can be used to accommodate<br>
stamps or visas.<br>
The carrier system provided as a pre-laminate which,<br>
according to an alternative refinement, is introduced<br>
into the book-type document of value as an end paper,<br>
can extend completely over both internal pages of the<br>
book binding or book cover or can be provided at least<br>
on one internal page and in the seam area of the book<br>
binding or book cover.<br>
The carrier system provided as a pre-laminate has at<br>
least one flexible and tear-resistant layer. As a<br>
result, removal or destruction of the layer can be<br>
carried out only with considerable force and damage.<br>
This flexible layer is advantageously difficult to<br>
tear. The at least one further layer which covers the<br>
at least one transponder unit is preferably likewise<br>
flexible, so that the pre-laminate is formed as an<br>
arrangement similar to paper or film, which has a layer<br>
thickness similar to a paper or film of the data page.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
-5-<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, provision is made for the carrier system to<br>
comprise at least one carrier layer and at least one<br>
top layer, at least one of the two layers being<br>
produced from thermoplastic material, such as<br>
polycarbonate, from thermoplastic elastomer, from<br>
thermosetting material, from paper, paper-nonwoven<br>
fibers, fibrous nonwoven, laminated and/or pressed<br>
paper and/or nonwoven material,. composite material,<br>
composite materials made of nonwoven substances and/or<br>
thermoplastic elastomers, rubber, latex and/or natural<br>
substances.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, provision is made for at least one layer of<br>
the carrier system formed as a pre-laminate to have a<br>
film-like, paper-like, fabric-like, nonwoven-like,<br>
smooth, embossed or structured surface. As a result,<br>
flexibility for different configurations can be made<br>
possible, the application of personalization data being<br>
provided.<br>
Provision is preferably made for the at least one layer<br>
to be capable of treatment by means of an offset, book,<br>
screen, pad, embossing, laser or inkjet printing<br>
process. By means of drying techniques following the<br>
printing process, the various printing processes can be<br>
selected and short production times can be achieved.<br>
The pre-laminate can preferably have further security<br>
features as a result of punched-out portions, kiss-cut<br>
portions, slits, perforations, embossments or a<br>
combination thereof. As a result, further security<br>
features can be added to the pre-laminate in a<br>
straightforward manner, which further increases the<br>
security against forgery.<br>
Furthermore, provision is made, according to the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 6 -<br>
invention, for a carrier system having at least one<br>
carrier layer and at least one top layer and having at<br>
least one transponder unit lying between them to be<br>
formed as a pre-laminate, which is provided as a<br>
personalized document or can be, introduced into or<br>
applied to a book-type document or a document of value<br>
as a personalization data page or as a sticker. This<br>
pre-laminate, which is an intermediate product, can<br>
thus be employed in an inexpensive way for further<br>
processing.<br>
Provision is advantageously made for it to be possible<br>
for the carrier system formed as a pre-laminate to be<br>
treated by printing on at least one side in order to<br>
produce a visa and to be positioned on a data page or<br>
internal page of a book-type document or document of<br>
value by means of a hot or cold adhesive bond. Thus,<br>
such pre-laminates can be used and employed not only<br>
for binding into a book-type document of value but also<br>
as a visa or sticker. As a result of the printability,<br>
this intermediate product can be completed in a<br>
straightforward manner as an end product. The above-<br>
described embodiments and variants of the pre-laminate<br>
are likewise possible for the configuration of a<br>
sticker.<br>
The pre-laminate, as intermediate product, is<br>
preferably processed by one or more processing steps,<br>
such as printing, labeling, pasting, perforating,<br>
embossing, punching, kiss-cutting or stamping, to form<br>
the end product and forms a personalized document.<br>
Further processing steps for finishing the pre-<br>
laminate, such as the application of a hologram film or<br>
further individualization constituents, are possible.<br>
A document to be personalized or the personalized<br>
document is preferably produced in an ID1 or ID2<br>
format.	Likewise, other formats or intermediate<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
_ 7 _<br>
formats can also be chosen. The above-described<br>
embodiments and alternatives of a carrier system in a<br>
book-type document can also be used for a personalized<br>
document.<br>
The invention and further advantageous refinements and<br>
developments of the same will be described and<br>
explained in more detail below by using the examples<br>
illustrated in the drawings. The features to be<br>
gathered from the description and the drawings can be<br>
used, according to the invention, on their own or in a<br>
plurality in any desired combination. In the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows a perspective illustration of a book-<br>
	type identification document according to the<br>
	invention,<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic sectional illustration of<br>
		the documents according to figure 1, and<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic sectional illustration of<br>
		an alternative configuration of a book-type<br>
		identification document.<br>
A book-type document 11 is illustrated in figure 1.<br>
This document 11 is, for example, an identification<br>
document such as a passport or a personal identity<br>
document. The document 11 comprises a book binding 12.<br>
Provided on an inner side of the book binding 12 is an<br>
end paper 14, which is fixed to the book binding 12.<br>
Via a common seam 16, a carrier system 17 having<br>
internal pages 18 is connected to one end paper 14.<br>
The internal pages 18 of the book-type document 11 are<br>
used to accommodate visas or stamps or other entries.<br>
A schematic sectional illustration of the book-type<br>
document 11 according to figure 1 is illustrated in<br>
figure 2.	The structure of the book binding 12<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	 PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 8 -<br>
illustrated in figure 2 is merely exemplary. The book<br>
binding 12 is formed by a front and rear side, which<br>
can be folded together by means of a crease in the seam<br>
area 21. The front: and rear side can be formed from a<br>
reinforced paper, a paperboard, a plastic film or a<br>
combination thereof- Alternatively, the book binding<br>
12 car comprise a multilayer structure, in which the<br>
front and rear sides are formed by a book cover<br>
binding, which can additionally be provided with a<br>
spine in the seam area. The end paper 14 is applied to<br>
the book cover.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in figure 2 constitutes an<br>
embodiment with reduced fabrication costs. To this<br>
end, the carrier system. 17 is formed from a pre-<br>
laminate. Such pre-laminates are intermediate products<br>
which are provided for further processing. For<br>
example, this pre-laminate is incorporated completely<br>
into a chip card by means of a pressure casting method<br>
or a laminating technique. A top layer applied to a<br>
carrier layer is used merely for protection against<br>
soiling Such intermediate products, which can be<br>
modified as required, are processed and used in<br>
accordance with the invention as. an end product in a<br>
book-type document. The carrier system 17 comprises a<br>
film-like carrier layer 23, to which at least one<br>
transponder unit 24 for reading data in and out without<br>
contact, such as document number, document holder,<br>
further person-specific data, is applied. At least one<br>
top layer 26 is applied to this carrier layer 23 such<br>
that it is difficult to detach from the carrier layer<br>
23. At least one outer side of the carrier system 17<br>
can be treated by printing. To the latter, according<br>
to the exemplary embodiment in figures 1 and 2, a<br>
decoration and/or personalization data is applied. The<br>
decoration is preferably applied first, if it is<br>
required, and then the personalization data. For<br>
example, offset, book, screen, pad, embossing, laser,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 9 -<br>
inkjet or security underprinting processes can be used.<br>
The introduction of the personalization data can be<br>
carried out before the introduction of the carrier<br>
system 17 into the book binding 12. Likewise, a blank<br>
of a book-type document can also be produced, in which<br>
the carrier system 17 is contained in the book-type<br>
document 11, so that subsequent personalization of the<br>
carrier system 17 and also of the at least one<br>
transponder unit 24 contained in the carrier system 17<br>
is made possible. In addition to the at least one<br>
transponder unit 24 arranged in the carrier system 17,<br>
at least one further transponder unit can be provided<br>
in the book binding 12. The personalization data or<br>
further data can be stored and deposited in the at<br>
1east two transponder units 24 in a redundant and/or<br>
distributed manner and linked with one other.<br>
The carrier system 17 is formed as an insert sheet.<br>
One side can be formed in accordance with the ICAO<br>
standard. A photograph of the document holder, an OCR<br>
machine-readable ICAO line 2 9 and further<br>
personalization data 28 can be applied. According to<br>
the exemplary embodiment, the carrier system 17 can<br>
comprise a flap 31 which extends beyond the seam area<br>
21. Alternatively, instead of the flap 31, a complete<br>
data page 18 can be provided. The transponder unit 24<br>
is arranged within one data page 18, for example.<br>
Alternatively, the transponder unit 24 can be provided<br>
in the edge region or else extend over the seam area<br>
21.	<br>
The carrier layer 23 consists for example of<br>
thermoplastic material such as polycarbonate or<br>
thermoplastic elastomer, of a thermoplastic or<br>
thermosetting material and is tear-resistant. In<br>
addition, fabrics or nonwovens can be provided in order<br>
to increase the tear resistance.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 10 -<br>
The at least one. transponder unit 24 is adhesively<br>
bonded, pressed or at least laid on the carrier layer<br>
23. The at least one top layer 26, which fixes at<br>
least one transponder unit 24 to the carrier layer 23<br>
and, if necessary, additionally positions the latter,<br>
can be produced from a material which is provided, at<br>
least in some sections, such that it is difficult to<br>
detach from the carrier layer 23. For example, the top<br>
layer 26 can be provided from the material of the<br>
carrier layer 23 for a structure that is the same on<br>
both sides.	Furthermore, the top layer 26 can be<br>
formed from a fibrous nonwoven, paper nonwoven,<br>
laminated and/or pressed paper and/or nonwoven<br>
material, composite materials made of nonwoven<br>
substances and/or thermoplastic elastomers. At least<br>
one surface of the carrier system 17 can be printed<br>
technically, so that the carrier system 17, as a<br>
personalization data page, can be completed with<br>
personalization data.<br>
A structure of a carrier system 17 that is the same on<br>
both sides can consist, for example, in a paper-like<br>
surface being applied to a PE layer or, respectively, a<br>
PE layer being coated with a paper-like surface. The<br>
transponder unit 24 is applied tc the PE layer. This<br>
is in turn covered by a PE layer which is provided or<br>
coated with a paper-like layer. Instead of a paper-<br>
like coating, a fabric-like, a film-like, a smooth,<br>
embossed or a structured coating or a surface of<br>
various materials can be provided. Alternatively, an<br>
uncoated carrier or top layer can be formed exclusively<br>
from the same or a different material.<br>
In the seam area 21, the carrier system 17 is<br>
preferably formed in one layer. The tear-resistant<br>
carrier layer 23 or top layer 26 extends along the seam<br>
area 21, so that the seam 16 is introduced therein.<br>
Alternatively, provision can also be made for the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/092273	PCT/EP2006/001833<br>
- 11 -<br>
carrier system 17, as a pre-laminate having a carrier<br>
layer 23 and at least one top layer 26, to extend<br>
completely over the seam area 16.<br>
An alternative embodiment is illustrated in figure 3 in<br>
a sectional illustration relating to figure 2. The<br>
carrier system 17 is connected to a book binding 12. A<br>
surface of the carrier. system 17 pointing towards the<br>
internal pages 18 is formed as an end paper 14, which<br>
at the same time can also comprise the personalization<br>
data page. Embodiments of this type can be used, for<br>
example, as a driver's license or access authorization<br>
and also as further personal documents. The carrier<br>
system 17 is preferably adhesively bonded on the book<br>
binding 12 together with the carrier layer 23<br>
accommodating the at least one transponder unit 24.<br>
The top layer 26 forms the end paper 14. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, the carrier system 17 extends<br>
completely over the book binding 12 and forms the end<br>
paper 14 for the inner front side and rear side of the<br>
book binding 12. Alternatively, the carrier system 17<br>
can also extend only over the inner front or inner rear<br>
side of the book binding 12 as far as the seam area 21,<br>
so that the carrier system 17 is connected to the<br>
internal pages 18 by the at least one seam 16.<br>
By means of the use according to the invention of a<br>
pre-laminate as carrier system 17, inexpensive<br>
production can be achieved in a cost-effective way,<br>
leaving out many production steps, such as the<br>
application of laminate layers ar.d the formation of a<br>
laminate layer covering. At the same time, it is made<br>
possible for blanks for book-type documents to be<br>
