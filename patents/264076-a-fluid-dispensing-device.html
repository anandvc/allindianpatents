				<td>A fluid dispensing device<br>
The present invention relates to a medicament dispenser and in particular to a fluid<br>
dispensing device for use as a nasal inhaler.<br>
It is known to provide a medicament dispenser, in which fluid spray is dispensed via<br>
a nozzle or orifice upon the application of a force by a user to an actuation lever or<br>
button. Such devices may be arranged to dispense a single dose or may<br>
alternatively be arranged with a reservoir containing several doses to be dispensed.<br>
It is a problem with such a prior art sprays that if the actuator is moved in a slow or<br>
unpredictable manner a strong and well defined spray may not be produced and so<br>
the medicament may not be effectively dispensed. This problem is particularly<br>
significant where an actuator (e.g. a lever) acts on a pump mechanism such as to<br>
pump the fluid to be sprayed from a container. In this case, slow or unpredictable<br>
actuation results in a slow or unpredictable actuation of the pump and hence, and<br>
unreliable spray characteristics. By way of a solution to this problem, the dispensing<br>
device herein includes a 'commitment' feature, which prevents actuation of the pump<br>
in the absence of the application of pre-determined force to a finger operable<br>
actuator.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a fluid dispensing device that is easier to<br>
use and in particular a device which provides a more efficient dispensing of fluid.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a fluid dispensing device<br>
for spraying a fluid into a body cavity comprising a housing, a nozzle for insertion into<br>
a body cavity, a fluid discharge device moveably housed within the housing, the fluid<br>
discharge device having a longitudinal axis and comprising a container for storing<br>
the fluid to be dispensed and a compression pump having a suction inlet located<br>
within the container and a discharge tube extending along the longitudinal axis for<br>
transferring fluid from the pump to the nozzle and finger operable means moveable<br>
transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the fluid discharge device to<br>
apply a force to the container to move the container along the longitudinal axis<br>
towards the nozzle so as to actuate the compression pump wherein a pre-load<br>
means is provided to prevent actuation of the compression pump until a pre-<br>
determined force is applied to the finger operable means.<br>
The term finger operable means is meant to encompass such means operable by<br>
action of the finger or thumb, or combinations thereof of a typical user (e.g. an adult<br>
or child patient).<br>
The finger operable means is moveable transversely with respect to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the fluid discharge device to apply a force directly or indirectly to the<br>
container. In alternative aspects, the finger operable means may therefore contact<br>
the container or be coupled thereto to enable the necessary transfer of force.<br>
Suitably, the finger operable means is arranged to apply mechanical advantage.<br>
That is to say, the finger operable means applies mechanical advantage to the user<br>
force to adjust (generally, to enhance or smooth) the force experienced by the<br>
container. The mechanical advantage may in one aspect, be provided in either a<br>
uniform manner such as by a constant mechanical advantage enhancement, for<br>
example by a ratio of from 1.5:1 to 10:1 (enhanced force: initial force), more typically<br>
from 2:1 to 5:1. In another aspect, the mechanical advantage is applied in a non-<br>
constant manner such as progressive increase or progressive decrease of<br>
mechanical advantage over the applied force cycle. The exact profile of mechanical<br>
advantage variation may be readily determined by reference to the desired spray<br>
profile and all relevant characteristics of the device and formulation to be sprayed<br>
(e.g. viscosity and density).<br>
Suitably, the finger operable means has a form, which naturally gives rise to<br>
mechanical advantage such as a lever, cam or screw form.<br>
The finger operable means may comprise of at least one lever pivotally connected to<br>
part of the housing and arranged to transfer force to the container (e.g. acting<br>
directly thereupon) so as to urge the container towards the nozzle when the or each<br>
lever is moved by a user.<br>
In one aspect, there are two opposing levers, each of which pivotally connect to part<br>
of the housing and may be arranged to act upon the container so as to urge the<br>
container towards the nozzle when the two levers are squeezed together by a user.<br>
Alternatively, the finger operable means may comprise of at least one lever to apply<br>
a force to an actuating means used to move the container towards the nozzle so as<br>
to actuate the pump.<br>
In which case the or each lever may be pivotally supported at a lower end within the<br>
housing and the actuating means may in aspects be connected to a neck of the<br>
container (e.g. formed as a collar thereto).<br>
Suitably, there may be two opposing levers, each of which is pivotally supported<br>
near a lower end of the housing and may be arranged to act upon the actuating<br>
means so as to urge the container towards the nozzle when the two levers are<br>
squeezed together by a user.<br>
Alternatively, the finger operable means may comprise of at least one lever slidably<br>
supported within the housing to apply a force to the container so as to move the<br>
container towards the nozzle and actuate the compression pump.<br>
The pre-load means acts such as to prevent actuation of the compression pump until<br>
a pre-determined force is applied to the finger operable means. The pre-determined<br>
force may thus, be thought of as a 'threshold' or 'barrier' force which must first be<br>
overcome before actuation of the compression pump can occur.<br>
The quantum of pre-determined force that is to be overcome before actuation of the<br>
compression pump is enabled is selected according to various factors including<br>
characteristics of the pump, typical user profile, nature of the fluid and the desired<br>
spray characteristics.<br>
Typically, the pre-determined force is in the range from 5 to 30N, more typically from<br>
10 to 25N. That is to say, typically from 5 to 30N, more typically from 10 to 25N of<br>
force must be applied to the finger operable means before actuation of the<br>
compression pump is enabled. Such values tend to correspond to a force which<br>
prevents a suitable 'barrier force' to a weak, nondescript or unintended finger<br>
movement whilst readily being overcome by the determined finger (or thumb) action<br>
of a user. It will be appreciated that if the device is designed for use by a child or<br>
elderly patient it may have a lower pre-determined force than that designed for adult<br>
usage.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the invention the pre-load means is<br>
physically interposed between the or each finger operable means (e.g. lever) and the<br>
container.<br>
In which case, the pre-load means may comprise of a step formed on the container<br>
which must be ridden over by the or each lever before the compression pump can be<br>
actuated wherein the step is over-ridden when the pre-determined force is applied to<br>
the or each lever.<br>
Alternatively, the pre-load means may comprise of a step formed on the or each<br>
finger operable means (e.g. lever) which must be ridden over by the container before<br>
the compression pump can be actuated wherein the step is over-ridden when the<br>
pre-determined force is applied to the or each lever.<br>
In yet a further alternative, the pre-load means may comprise of at least one detent<br>
formed on one of the container or the or each finger operable means (e.g. a lever)<br>
and a recess formed on the other of the container or the or each lever wherein the or<br>
each detent is able to ride out of the recess with which it is engaged when the pre-<br>
determined force is applied to the or each lever.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention the pre-load means is interposed<br>
between the housing and the container.<br>
In which case, the pre-load means may comprise of one or more detents formed on<br>
the container for engagement with part of the housing, the or all of the detents being<br>
disengageable from the housing when the pre-determined force is applied to the<br>
finger operable means so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Alternatively, the pre-load means may comprise of one or more detents formed on<br>
the housing for engagement with part of the container, the or all of the detents being<br>
disengageable from the container when the pre-determined force is applied to the<br>
finger operable means so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
According to a third embodiment of the invention the pre-load means is interposed<br>
between the container and the discharge tube.<br>
In which case, the pre-load means may comprises of a step formed on the discharge<br>
tube and at least one latching member attached to the container, the arrangement<br>
being such that, when the pre-determined force is applied to the finger operable<br>
means, the or each latching member is able to ride over the step so as to allow the<br>
compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Alternatively, the pre-load means may comprise of a recess formed on the discharge<br>
tube and at least one latching member attached to the container, the arrangement<br>
being such that, when the pre-determined force is applied to the finger operable<br>
means, the or each latching member is able to ride out of the recess so as to allow<br>
the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
According to a fourth embodiment of the invention the pre-load means is interposed<br>
between the housing and the or each finger operable means (e.g. lever).<br>
In which case, the pre-load means may comprise of at least one detent formed on<br>
the housing for engagement with each lever, the or all of the detents being<br>
disengageable from the respective lever when the pre-determined force is applied to<br>
the or each lever so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Alternatively, the pre-load means may comprise of at least one detent formed on<br>
each lever for engagement with part of the housing, the or all of the detents being<br>
disengageable from the housing when the pre-determined force is applied to the or<br>
each lever so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
According to a fifth embodiment of the invention the pre-load means is interposed<br>
between the actuating means and the housing.<br>
In which case, the pre-load means may comprise of at least one detent formed on<br>
part of the actuating means for engagement with part of the housing, the or all of the<br>
detents being disengageable from the housing when the pre-determined force is<br>
applied to the or each finger operable means (e.g. lever) so as to allow the<br>
compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Alternatively, the pre-load means may comprise of at least one detent formed on part<br>
of the housing each detent being arranged for engagement with a complementary<br>
recess formed on part of the actuating means, each detent being disengageable<br>
from its respective recess when the pre-determined force is applied to the or each<br>
finger operable means (e.g. lever) so as to allow the compression pump to be<br>
actuated.<br>
According to a sixth embodiment of the invention the pre-load means is interposed<br>
between the or each finger operable means (e.g. lever) and the respective actuating<br>
means.<br>
In which case, the pre-load means may comprise of at least one detent formed on<br>
the or each lever for engagement with a respective recess formed on part of the<br>
actuating means, each detent being disengageable from its respective<br>
complementary recess when the pre-determined force is applied to the lever so as to<br>
allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Alternatively, the pre-load means comprises of at least one detent formed on each<br>
actuating means for engagement with a recess formed on a respective lever, each<br>
detent being disengageable from its respective complementary recess when the pre-<br>
determined force is applied to the lever so as to allow the compression pump to be<br>
actuated.<br>
As yet a further alternative, the pre-load means may comprise of an actuating device<br>
having a variable mechanical ratio such that until the pre-determined force is applied<br>
to the or each finger operable means (e.g. a lever) no significant force is transferred<br>
to the container along the longitudinal axis.<br>
The fluid dispensing device may alternatively comprise of a finger operable means in<br>
the form of a single lever and the pre-load means may further comprise of a spring<br>
interposed between the lever and the container, the spring being used to urge the<br>
container towards the nozzle so as to actuate the compression pump.<br>
In which case the spring may be compressed by movement of the lever until the pre-<br>
determined force is applied (i.e. by a combination of user-applied force and stored<br>
spring force), at which point the threshold of the pre-load means used to prevent<br>
actuation of the compression pump is overcome by the force being applied to the<br>
container such that the container moves rapidly towards the nozzle so as to actuate<br>
the compression pump.<br>
Suitably, the fluid dispensing device is additionally provided with force modifying<br>
means for modifying the force applied to the container. That is to say, means for<br>
modifying the force applied to (and therefore, ultimately acting on) the container<br>
compared to that force directly applied to the finger operable means by the user.<br>
Suitably, the force modifying means acts such as to amplify the force applied (i.e. it<br>
comprises force amplifying means). The amplification may be provided in either a<br>
uniform manner such as by a constant amplification, for example by a ratio of from<br>
1.5:1 to 10:1 (amplified force : initial force; i.e. degree of amplification of from 1.5 to<br>
10), more typically from 2:1 to 5:1. In another aspect, the amplification is applied in a<br>
non-constant manner such as progressive increase or progressive decrease of<br>
mechanical advantage over the applied force cycle.<br>
The exact profile of force modification may be readily determined by reference to the<br>
desired spray profile and all relevant characteristics of the device and formulation to<br>
be sprayed (e.g. viscosity and density).<br>
The force modifying means may in one aspect, be integral with the finger operable<br>
means. In this aspect, the force modifying means may comprise an aspect of the<br>
finger operable means shaped to give rise to a mechanical advantage (e.g. a lever,<br>
cam or screw feature).<br>
In another aspect, the force modifying means is located non-integral with the finger<br>
operable means, and typically between the finger operable means and the container.<br>
Again this aspect, the force modifying means may comprise an aspect of the finger<br>
operable means shaped to give rise to a mechanical advantage (e.g. a lever, cam or<br>
screw feature).<br>
In one aspect, the force modifying means only acts (i.e. only acts to modify the user<br>
applied force) once the pre-determined force has been overcome. In preferred<br>
aspects, the modifying force acts such that once the pre-determined force has been<br>
overcome the force applied to the container is either relatively constant or increases<br>
on a relatively constant basis.<br>
In one particular aspect, the force modifying means additionally comprises a stop<br>
feature, which acts to stop force being applied to the container once either a<br>
particular maximum force is reached or more typically, once the container has been<br>
moved a particular distance. In one aspect, the stop functions to prevent excess<br>
force being applied to the compression pump.<br>
Embodiments are envisaged in which the fluid discharge device is reversibly<br>
removable from the housing of the fluid dispensing device. In such embodiments the<br>
fluid discharge device comprises a housing assembly and fluid discharge device<br>
receivable thereby.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is therefore provided a<br>
housing assembly for reversible receipt of a fluid discharge device for spraying a<br>
fluid into a body cavity, said fluid discharge device having a longitudinal axis and<br>
comprising a container for storing the fluid to be dispensed and a compression pump<br>
having a suction inlet located within the container and a discharge tube extending<br>
along the longitudinal axis for transferring fluid from the pump to the nozzle, the<br>
housing assembly comprising a housing, a nozzle for insertion into a body cavity and<br>
finger operable means moveable transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the fluid discharge device to apply a force to the container to move the container<br>
along the longitudinal axis towards the nozzle so as to actuate the compression<br>
pump wherein a pre-load means is provided to prevent actuation of the compression<br>
pump until a pre-determined force is applied to the finger operable means.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a kit of<br>
parts comprising a housing assembly as described above and a fluid discharge<br>
device receivable thereby. The fluid discharge device has a longitudinal axis and<br>
comprises a container for storing the fluid to be dispensed and a compression pump<br>
having a suction inlet located within the container and a discharge tube extending<br>
along the longitudinal axis for transferring fluid from the pump to the nozzle.<br>
Suitably, the fluid discharge device herein comprises a pre-compression pump, such<br>
as a VP3, VP7 or modifications, model manufactured by Valois SA. Typically, such<br>
pre-compression pumps are typically used with a bottle (glass or plastic) container<br>
capable of holding 8-50ml of a formulation. Each spray will typically deliver 50-1 OOpi<br>
of such a formulation and the device is therefore capable of providing at least 100<br>
metered doses.<br>
It is also envisaged that the housing assembly could be supplied as a separate item,<br>
into which a user or pharmacist later fits a suitable fluid discharge device.<br>

into a body cavity, a fluid discharge device 8 moveably housed within the housing 9,<br>
the fluid discharge device 9 having a longitudinal axis and comprising a container 30<br>
for storing the fluid to be dispensed and a compression pump having a suction inlet<br>
located within the container 30 and a discharge tube 31 extending along the<br>
longitudinal axis for transferring fluid from the compression pump to the nozzle 11<br>
and finger operable means 20, 21 moveable transversely with respect to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the fluid discharge device to apply a force to the container 30 to<br>
move the container 30 along the longitudinal axis towards the nozzle 11 so as to<br>
actuate the compression pump and a pre-load means 28 to prevent actuation of the<br>
compression pump until a pre-determined force is applied to the finger operable<br>
means 20, 21.<br>
The finger operable means is in the form of two opposing levers 20, 21 each of<br>
which is pivotally connected to part of the housing 9 and is arranged to act upon a<br>
base portion 35 of the container 30 so as to urge the container 30 towards the nozzle<br>
11 when the two levers 20, 21 are squeezed together by a user.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 5 comprises of a plastic moulded body 6 and the fluid<br>
discharge device 8 and further comprises of a protective end cap (not shown) having<br>
an inner surface for engagement with the body 6 to protect the dispensing nozzle 11.<br>
The body 6 is made from a plastic material such as polypropylene and defines the<br>
housing 9 and the dispensing nozzle 11 so that the housing 9 and the nozzle 11 are<br>
made as a single plastic component.<br>
The housing 9 defines a cavity 10 formed by a front wall, a rear wall and first and<br>
second end walls 14a, 14b. The dispensing nozzle 11 is connected to one end of<br>
the housing 9, extends away from the housing 9 and has an external tapering form.<br>
The discharge outlet from the compression pump is in the form of the tubular delivery<br>
tube 31 and a tubular guide in the form of an outlet tube 16 is formed within the<br>
nozzle 11 to align and locate the delivery tube 31 correctly with respect to the nozzle<br>
11.<br>
An annular abutment 17 is formed at the end of the outlet tube 16. The annular<br>
abutment 17 defines the entry to an orifice 15 through which fluid can flow in use and<br>
is arranged for abutment with an end of the delivery tube 31.<br>
The fluid discharge device 8 has a longitudinal axis X-X and each of the levers 20,<br>
21 has an abutment surface 22, 23 arranged at an angle 9 to the longitudinal axis X-<br>
X of the fluid discharge device 8 for abutment against the base portion 35 of the<br>
container so as to convert a force applied to the levers 20, 21 substantially<br>
transversely to the longitudinal axis X-X of the fluid discharge device 8 into a force<br>
along the longitudinal axis X-X of the fluid discharge device 8.<br>
The nozzle 11 has a longitudinal axis that is aligned with the longitudinal axis X-X of<br>
the fluid discharge device 8. This has the advantage that when the compression<br>
pump is actuated the force applied to the tubular delivery tube 31 is along the axis of<br>
the tubular delivery tube 31 and no bending or deflection of the delivery tube 31 will<br>
occur due to the applied force.<br>
At least part of the surface of the base portion 35 of the container 30 is inclined at an<br>
angle with respect to the longitudinal axis X-X of the fluid discharge device 8 so as to<br>
form an inclined surface, the or each inclined surface being arranged to be acted<br>
upon by the levers 20. 21 so as to convert a force applied to the levers 20, 21<br>
substantially transversely to the longitudinal axis X-X of the fluid discharge device 8<br>
into a force along the longitudinal axis X-X of the fluid discharge device 8.<br>
Although in the disclosed embodiment both the levers and the container have<br>
surfaces inclined to the longitudinal axis of the fluid discharge device this need not<br>
be the case. Only the container or the levers need have an inclined surface or some<br>
other arrangement to apply the force from the levers to the container could be used.<br>
The base portion 35 of the container 30 has two inclined surfaces 37, 38 each<br>
arranged for co-operation with a respective one of the levers 20, 21.<br>
However it will be appreciated that the inclined surface of the base portion of the<br>
container could be a conical, frusto-conical or part spherical surface.<br>
The inclined surface 37 is arranged to co-operate with the abutment surface 22 and<br>
the inclined surface 38 is arranged to co-operate with the abutment surface 23.<br>
The abutment surface 22 is formed by an edge of a web 24 formed as part of the<br>
lever 20 and the abutment surface 23 is formed by an edge of a web 25 formed as<br>
part of the lever 21.<br>
In the arrangement shown in Fig 2A, the pre-loading means is interposed between<br>
the levers 20, 21 and the container and as shown is in the form of small step 28<br>
formed near to the end of each abutment surface 22,23. In the ready for use<br>
position this lies against a side of the container 30 at the juncture of the side of the<br>
container with the base portion 35. The purpose of this step 28 is to prevent the<br>
levers 20,21 from moving the container 30 until more than a pre-determined force<br>
has been applied to the levers 20, 21.<br>
The step 28 formed on each lever 20,21 must be ridden over by the container 30<br>
before the compression pump can be actuated. The step 28 is over-ridden when the<br>
pre-determined force is applied to each lever 20,21 and once this pre-determined<br>
force is exceeded the pressure being applied to the levers 20, 21 is such that the<br>
container 30 is very rapidly moved towards the nozzle 11. This prevents the levers<br>
20,21 being slowly squeezed together which will not produce a uniform spray and if<br>
done very slowly will merely cause the fluid to dribble out of the nozzle 11.<br>
Fig. 2B shows an alternative arrangement in which the pre-load means comprises of<br>
a detent or protuberance 29 formed on the container 30 and complementary recess<br>
27 formed on each lever 20,21. The size of the detent 29 is such that they are able<br>
to ride out of the recess 27 when the pre-determined force is applied to each lever<br>
20,21. It will be appreciated that in other alternatives, the recess could be formed in<br>
the container and the detent could be formed on the levers.<br>
Each of the levers 20, 21 is pivotally connected to part of the housing 9 by a<br>
respective living hinge. In the embodiment shown each of the levers 20,21 is<br>
pivotally connected to a respective one of the two side walls 14a, 14b by a<br>
respective living hinge 26 although other means of pivotal connection could be used.<br>
The fluid discharge device 8 is in most respects conventional and will only be<br>
described briefly herein.<br>
The fluid discharge device 8 has a hollow container 30 defining a reservoir<br>
containing several doses of the fluid to be dispensed and the compression pump that<br>
is attached to a neck 34 of the container 30.<br>
The container 30 as shown is made from a translucent or transparent plastics<br>
material however it will be appreciate that it could be made from other translucent or<br>
transparent materials such as glass.<br>
The compression pump includes a plunger (not shown) slidingly engaged within a<br>
pump casing that defines a chamber (not shown) sized to accommodate a single<br>
dose of fluid. The plunger is attached to the tubular delivery tube 31 that is arranged<br>
to extend from one end of the pump for co-operation with the outlet tube 16 of the<br>
dispensing nozzle 11. The plunger includes a piston (not shown) slidably supported<br>
in the chamber formed in the pump casing.<br>
The fluid is discharged through a discharge channel defined by the tubular delivery<br>
tube 31 into the orifice 15 of the dispensing nozzle 11.<br>
The size of chamber is such that it accommodates a single dose of fluid, the<br>
diameter of the chamber and piston combined with the stroke of the plunger being<br>
such that a full stroke of the plunger in the chamber will produce a change in volume<br>
equal to a single dose of fluid.<br>
The pump casing is connected to the container 30 such that when the piston is<br>
moved by a return spring of the pump (not shown) into a start position a new dose of<br>
fluid is drawn into the cylinder via the suction inlet in the form of a pick-up tube from<br>
the container 30 ready for discharge.<br>
Operation of the fluid dispensing device is as follows.<br>
From the position shown in Fig. 1 in which the end portions of the abutment surfaces<br>
22, 23 abut gently against the inclined surfaces 37, 38 of the container 30 and the<br>
container 30 is abutting with the steps 28 a user first grasps the fluid dispensing<br>
device 5 by the two levers 20, 21. Provided that only a light pressure is applied to<br>
the levers 20, 21 no fluid will be discharged and the user is able to manoeuvre the<br>
dispensing nozzle 11 of the fluid dispensing device 5 into the body orifice into which<br>
fluid is required to be dispensed. This is because of the presence of the pre-loading<br>
means formed in alternative embodiments, by the steps 28 of Fig 2A or the<br>
detents/recesses 29,27 arrangement of Fig 2B.<br>
If the user then squeezes the two levers 20,21 together with increasing force the<br>
pre-determined force required to cause the container 30 to ride up over the steps 28<br>
(or detents/recesses 29, 27) will be attained and the interaction of the abutment<br>
surfaces 22, 23 with the inclined surfaces 37, 38 will then cause the container 30 to<br>
be moved rapidly towards the nozzle 11 as indicated by the arrow 'M' on Fig.3.<br>
However, the abutment between the end of the delivery tube 31 and the annular<br>
abutment 17 will prevent movement of the delivery tube 31 in the same direction.<br>
This effect of this is to cause the delivery tube 31 to push the plunger into the pump<br>
casing thereby moving the piston of the pump in the cylinder. This movement<br>
causes fluid to be expelled from the cylinder into the delivery tube 31. The fluid<br>
forced into the delivery tube is then transferred into the orifice 15 from where it is<br>
expelled as a fine spray into the body orifice.<br>
Upon releasing the pressure applied to the levers 20, 21 the delivery tube 31 is<br>
urged out of the pump casing by the internal return spring and causes fluid to be<br>
drawn up the pick-up tube to re-fill the cylinder. The container 30 will then be<br>
allowed to move back into engagement with the steps 28 formed in the levers 20, 21<br>
ready for the next actuation of the fluid dispensing device 5.<br>
The actuating procedure can then be repeated until all of the fluid in the container<br>
has been used. However, only one or two doses of fluid are normally administered<br>
at a time.<br>
When the container is empty a new fluid discharge device 8 is loaded into the<br>
housing 9 thereby restoring the fluid dispensing device 5 into a useable condition.<br>
With reference to Figs. 4 and 5 there is shown a fluid dispensing device that is in<br>
most respects identical to that previously described and for which the same<br>
reference numerals are used for like components.<br>
The primary difference between the fluid dispensing means shown in Figs. 1 to 3 and<br>
that shown in Figs. 4 and 5 is that the fluid dispensing device 5 in Figs. 4 and 5 uses<br>
a second embodiment of pre-load means in which the pre-load means 39, 40 is<br>
interposed between the housing 9 and the container 30.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of two detents 39,40 formed on the housing 9 for<br>
engagement with part of the container 30. The two detents 39, 40 are<br>
disengageable from the container 30 when the pre-determined force is applied to the<br>
finger operable means 20, 21 so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Each of the detents is in the form of an arm 39, which extends downwardly from the<br>
housing 9 for engagement with a corner of the neck 34 of the container 30. A free<br>
end of each arm 39 has a step 40 formed therein, which prior to actuation is in<br>
abutting contact with the neck 34 of the container 30.<br>
Operation of the fluid dispensing device is as follows.<br>
From the position shown in Fig. 4 in which the end portions of the abutment surfaces<br>
22, 23 abut gently against the inclined surfaces 37, 38 of the container 30 and the<br>
container 30 is abutting with the steps 40 a user first grasps the fluid dispensing<br>
device 5 by the two levers 20, 21. Provided that only a light pressure is applied to<br>
the levers 20, 21 no fluid will be discharged and the user is able to manoeuvre the<br>
dispensing nozzle 11 of the fluid dispensing device 5 into the body orifice into which<br>
fluid is required to be dispensed. This is because of the presence of the pre-loading<br>
means formed by the steps 40 and the arms 39 which prevent movement of the<br>
container towards the nozzle.<br>
If the user then squeezes the two levers 20, 21 together with increasing force the<br>
arms 39 will begin to bow outwardly until when the pre-determined force is reached<br>
the neck 34 of the container 30 is able to disengaged itself from the steps 40 and the<br>
interaction of the abutment surfaces 22,23 with the inclined surfaces 37, 38 will then<br>
cause the container 30 to be moved rapidly towards the nozzle 11.<br>
However, as previously described the abutment between the end of the delivery tube<br>
31 and the annular abutment 17 will prevent movement of the delivery tube 31 in the<br>
same direction thereby causing the compression pump to be actuated as the delivery<br>
tube 31 is pushed into the container 30. This movement causes fluid to be expelled<br>
from the container 30 into the delivery tube 31 and then into the orifice 15 from where<br>
it is expelled as a fine spray into the body orifice.<br>
Upon releasing the pressure applied to the levers 20,21 the delivery tube 31 is<br>
urged out of the container 30 causing fluid to re-fill the pump. The container 30 will<br>
then move back into engagement with the steps 40 formed in the arms 39 ready for<br>
the next actuation of the fluid dispensing device 5.<br>
The actuating procedure can then be repeated until all of the fluid in the container<br>
has been used. However, only one or two dose volumes of fluid are normally<br>
administered at a time.<br>
With reference to Figs. 6 to 8 there is shown a fluid dispensing device that is in most<br>
respects identical to that previously described with respect to Figs. 1 to 3 and for<br>
which the same reference numerals are used for like components.<br>
The primary difference between the fluid dispensing means shown in Figs. 1 to 3 and<br>
that shown in Figs. 6 to 8 is that the fluid dispensing device 5 in Figs. 6 to 8 uses a<br>
third embodiment of pre-load means in which the pre-load means 41, 42,43 is<br>
interposed between the container 30 and the discharge tube 31.<br>
This embodiment has the advantage that it can be used irrespective of the<br>
mechanism used to actuate the pump.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of a step 41 formed on the discharge tube 31 and<br>
two latching members in the form of arms 42 attached by a collar 43 to the neck 34<br>
of the container 30. The step 41 is formed by a rib 44 extending circumferentially<br>
around the discharge tube 31 and positioned such that when the pump is actuated<br>
the rib 44 does not prevent travel of the discharge tube 31 into the container 30.<br>
The arrangement is such that, when the pre-determined force is applied to the finger<br>
operable means in the form of the levers 20, 21, the latching members or arms 42<br>
are able to ride over the step 41 so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated<br>
but when a force below the pre-determined force is applied the interengagement of<br>
the arms 42 with the step 41 prevents the discharge tube 31 from moving into the<br>
container 30.<br>
Operation of the fluid dispensing device is as previously described and provided that<br>
only a light pressure is applied to the levers 20, 21 no fluid will be discharged and the<br>
user is able to manoeuvre the dispensing nozzle 11 of the fluid dispensing device 5<br>
into the body orifice into which fluid is required to be dispensed. This is because of<br>
the presence of the pre-loading means formed by the step 41 and the arms 42 which<br>
prevent movement of the container 30 towards the nozzle 11.<br>
If the user then squeezes the two levers 20, 21 together with increasing force the<br>
arms 42 will begin to bow until when the pre-determined force is reached the arms<br>
42 are able to disengage themselves from the step 41 and the interaction of the<br>
abutment surfaces 22, 23 with the inclined surfaces 37, 38 will then cause the<br>
container 30 to be moved rapidly towards the nozzle 11.<br>
This movement causes fluid to be expelled from the container 30 into the delivery<br>
tube 3land then into the orifice 15 from where it is expelled as a fine spray into the<br>
body orifice.<br>
Upon releasing the pressure applied to the levers 20, 21 the delivery tube 31 is<br>
urged out of the container 30 causing fluid to re-fill the pump. The container 30 will<br>
then move back allowing the arms 42 to re-engage with the step 41 ready for the<br>
next actuation of the fluid dispensing device 5.<br>
The actuating procedure can then be repeated until all of the fluid in the container<br>
has been used. However, only one or two doses of fluid are normally administered<br>
at a time.<br>
It will be appreciated that alternatively, the pre-load means may comprise of a recess<br>
formed on the discharge tube 31 and at least one latching member or arm attached<br>
to the container 30, the arrangement being such that, when the pre-determined force<br>
is applied to the finger operable means in the form of the levers 20,21 the or each<br>
latching member is able to ride out of the recess so as to allow the compression<br>
pump to be actuated.<br>
With reference to Figs. 9 and 10 there is shown a fluid dispensing device 105 which<br>
is in many respects similar to that previously described but instead of direct actuation<br>
of the fluid discharge device by the levers, the finger operable means in the form of<br>
two lever 120, 121 are used to apply a force to an actuating means 122a, 122b; 132,<br>
132a, 132b used to move a container 30 towards a nozzle 111 so as to actuate the<br>
pump. For similar parts the same reference numerals will be used to those<br>
previously used in respect of Figs. 1 to 3<br>
The actuating means 122a, 122b, 132,132a, 132b is connected to a neck 34 of the<br>
container 30.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 105 for spraying a fluid into a body cavity comprises a<br>
housing 9, a nozzle 11 for insertion into a body cavity and a fluid discharge device 8<br>
moveably housed within the housing 9. The fluid discharge device 8 comprises of a<br>
container 30 for storing the fluid to be dispensed and a compression pump having a<br>
suction inlet located within the container 30 and a discharge outlet 31 at one end of<br>
the container 30 for transferring fluid from the pump to the nozzle 11.<br>
A finger operable means in the form of the two levers 120, 121 is provided to apply a<br>
force to the container 30 to move the container 30 towards the nozzle 11 so as to<br>
actuate the pump.<br>
The two opposing levers 120,121 are pivotally supported within the housing 9 and<br>
are driveably connected to the container 30 by means of the actuating means so as<br>
to urge the container 30 towards the nozzle 11 when each lever 20, 21 is rotated by<br>
a user and in practice the two levers 120,121 are squeezed together by a user.<br>
That is to say, squeezing the two levers 120,121 together causes the container 30<br>
to be moved towards the nozzle 11.<br>
In more detail, the fluid dispensing device 5 comprises of a housing assembly and<br>
the fluid discharge device 8. The housing assembly comprises of the housing 9 for<br>
moveably supporting the fluid discharge device 8, a body 6 having the nozzle 11<br>
extending therefrom and the two levers 120,121 pivotally supported within the<br>
housing 9.<br>
The body 6 and the nozzle 11 are made as a single part from a plastic material such<br>
as polypropylene and the body 6 is adapted at a lower end for engagement with an<br>
upper end of the housing 9. The body 6 and the housing 9 are fixed together by any<br>
suitable means.<br>
The housing 9 defines a cavity 10 formed by a front wall, a rear wall and first and<br>
second end walls 14a, 14b.<br>
The discharge outlet from the pump is in the form of a tubular delivery tube 31 and a<br>
tubular guide in the form of an outlet tube 16 is formed within the nozzle 11 to align<br>
and locate the delivery tube 31 correctly with respect to the nozzle 11.<br>
An annular abutment 17 is formed at the end of the outlet tube 16. The annular<br>
abutment 17 defines the entry to an orifice 15 through which fluid can flow in use and<br>
is arranged for abutment with an end of the delivery tube 31.<br>
The fluid discharge device 8 has a longitudinal axis co-incident with a longitudinal<br>
axis of the container 30 and a longitudinal axis of the tubular delivery tube 31. The<br>
nozzle 11 has a longitudinal axis which is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the<br>
fluid discharge device 8 so that when the pump is actuated the force applied to the<br>
tubular delivery tube 31 is along the longitudinal axis of the tubular delivery tube 31<br>
and no bending or deflection of the delivery tube 31 will occur due to the applied<br>
force.<br>
Each of the first and second levers 120,121 is driveably connected to the container<br>
30 near to said one end of the container 30 where the container terminates in a neck<br>
34.<br>
To form the driveable connection each of the first and second levers 120,121 has a<br>
pair of toothed portions 122a, 122b for engagement with a respective toothed rack<br>
132 attached to the container 30 and in particular to the neck portion 34 of the<br>
container 30. Each of the racks 132 is arranged so as to extend parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the container 30.<br>
Each of toothed racks 132 has two sets of opposed teeth, a first set of teeth 132a for<br>
engagement with the first lever 120 and a second set of teeth 132b for engagement<br>
with the second lever 121.<br>
The neck portion 34 of the container 30 has a cylindrical outer surface and the two<br>
toothed racks 132 are arranged on opposite sides of the neck portion 34 so that the<br>
two toothed racks 132 are arranged diametrically opposite with respect to the neck<br>
portion 34.<br>
Each of the toothed racks 132 is connected to a collar 140 used to attach the toothed<br>
racks 132 to the neck portion 34 of the container 30.<br>
It will be appreciated that the levers 120, 121 can be pivotally attached to the<br>
housing 9 in any convenient manner or that each lever 120,121 could be pivotally<br>
supported within the housing 9 by a pivotal connection between each lever 120,121<br>
and the body member 6.<br>
The fluid discharge device 8 is as has previously been described and will not be<br>
described again other than to mention that actuation of the pump occurs when the<br>
discharge tube 31 is pushed into the container 30.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 105 is fitted with a pre-load means according to the<br>
second embodiment of the invention, that is to say, the pre-load means 144 is<br>
interposed between the housing 9 and the container 30.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of a detent in the form of a circumferentially<br>
extending rib 144 formed on the container 30 for engagement with part of the<br>
housing 9. The rib 144 is arranged for engagement with two inwardly extending<br>
fingers 147a, 147b formed in the side walls 14a, 14b of the housing 9. Each of the<br>
fingers 147a, 147b is attached to the respective side wall 14a, 14b be a living hinge<br>
such that movement of the fingers 147a, 147b towards the nozzle is prevented but<br>
pivoting of the fingers 147a, 147b relative to the housing 9 is possible when they are<br>
urged away from the nozzle 11. This provides a resistance to passage of the rib 144<br>
if the container 30 is moved towards the nozzle 11 but offers little to resistance to<br>
passage of the rib 144 if the container is moving away from the nozzle 11.<br>
Therefore, the detent or rib 144 is disengageable from the housing 9 or more<br>
specifically the fingers 147a, 147b when a pre-determined force is applied to the<br>
finger operable means 120,121 so as to allow the compression pump to be<br>
actuated.<br>
Operation of the fluid discharge device 105 is as follows.<br>
First, a user must grasp the fluid dispensing device 105 by the two levers 120,121,<br>
provided that only a light pressure is applied to the levers 120,121 no fluid will be<br>
discharged due to the interaction between the rib 144 and the two fingers 147a, 147b<br>
and the user is able to manoeuvre the dispensing nozzle 11 of the fluid dispensing<br>
device 5 into the body orifice into which fluid is required to be dispensed. If the user<br>
then squeezes the two levers 120,121 together with increasing force eventually a<br>
pre-determined force will be reached at which point the rib 144 is able to disengage<br>
with the housing 9 by riding over the fingers 147a, 147b and the interaction of the<br>
toothed portions 22a, 22b with the racks 32 will then cause the container 30 to be<br>
moved rapidly towards the nozzle 11.<br>
However, because the end of the delivery tube 31 is in abutting contact with the<br>
annular abutment 17, the delivery tube 31 cannot move in the same direction. The<br>
effect of this is to cause the delivery tube 31 to be pushed into the container causing<br>
fluid to be expelled from the delivery tube 31 into the orifice 15 from where it is<br>
expelled as a fine spray into the body orifice.<br>
At the end of the delivery stage when the fluid discharge device has been discharged<br>
the two levers 120, 121 have been rotated so that they lie close to or flush with the<br>
side walls 14a, 14b as shown in Fig.10.<br>
Upon releasing the pressure applied to the levers 120, 121 the delivery tube 31 is<br>
urged out of the pump casing by an internal return spring and causes fluid to be<br>
drawn up to re-fill the pump.<br>
The actuating procedure can then be repeated until all of the fluid in the container<br>
has been used. However, only one or two volumes of fluid are normally<br>
administered at a time.<br>
When the container is empty a new fluid discharge device 8 is loaded into the<br>
housing 9 thereby restoring the fluid dispensing device 105 into a useable condition.<br>
With reference to Figs. 11 and 12 there is shown a fluid dispensing device 165 which<br>
is in many respects similar to that shown in Figs.1 to 3 but in which a single lever<br>
170 is used to apply a force to an actuating means 176 used to move a container<br>
130 towards a nozzle 111 and actuate a compression pump. The lever 170 is<br>
pivotally supported at a lower end within a housing 109 and the actuating means 176<br>
is connected to a neck 129 of the container 130 by a collar 140.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 165 is fitted with a fourth embodiment of a pre-load<br>
means in which the pre-load means 150,152,153 is interposed between the<br>
housing 109 and the lever 170.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of a detent in the form of a tooth 150 formed on the<br>
housing 109 for engagement with the lever 170. The tooth 150 is formed at the end<br>
of an arm 152 formed as an integral part of the housing 109 and the lever 170 has a<br>
complementary rib 153 formed thereon for engagement with the tooth 150.<br>
The detent or tooth 150 is disengageable from the rib 153 on the lever 170 when a<br>
pre-determined force is applied to the lever 170 so as to allow the compression<br>
pump to be actuated.<br>
In more detail the fluid dispensing device 165 comprises of a body structure<br>
including the housing 109, the nozzle 111 extending out from an upper end of the<br>
housing 109 for insertion into a body cavity and a fluid discharge device 108<br>
moveably housed within the housing 109.<br>
The fluid discharge device 108 comprises of the container 130 for storing the fluid to<br>
be dispensed and the compression pump having a suction inlet located within the<br>
container 130 and a discharge outlet 131 for transferring fluid from the pump to the<br>
nozzle 111.<br>
The lever 170 is pivotally supported at a lower end within the housing 109 and the<br>
actuating means is connected to the neck 129 of the container 130 by a collar 140<br>
engaged with the neck 129 of the container 130.<br>
The body structure comprises of a two-part plastic housing 109 and a plastic body<br>
member 106 both of which are moulded from a suitable plastic material such as<br>
polypropylene. The nozzle 111 is formed as an integral part of the body member<br>
106 and the body member 106 is fastened to the housing 109 so that the nozzle 111<br>
projects from the upper end of the housing 109.<br>
The housing 109 has an aperture formed in a side wall 114 from which, in use, a part<br>
of the lever 170 projects. The part of the lever 170 that projects from the aperture is<br>
a ribbed finger grip 146.<br>
The discharge outlet from the pump is in the form of a tubular delivery tube 131 and<br>
a tubular guide in the form of an outlet tube 116 is formed within the nozzle 111 to<br>
align and locate the delivery tube 131 correctly with respect to the nozzle 111.<br>
An annular abutment 117 is formed at the end of the outlet tube 116. The annular<br>
abutment 117 defines the entry to an orifice 115 through which fluid can flow in use<br>
and is arranged for abutment with an end of the delivery tube 131.<br>
The fluid discharge device 108 is in most respects conventional and is as previously<br>
described herein.<br>
The collar 140 is connected to the neck 129 of the container 130 by a snap<br>
connection in which the neck 129 has a groove 141 into which the collar 140 is snap<br>
fitted. The collar 140 has a slit 142 in one side that allows it to be pushed onto the<br>
neck 129 and engage with the groove 141.<br>
The actuating means is a resilient flexible member in the form of a leaf spring 176<br>
connected to an upper end of the lever 170 so as to hold the resilient flexible<br>
member 176 in an upwardly bowed state. However, it will be appreciated that more<br>
than one resilient flexible member could be used if required.<br>
The lower end of the lever 170 is pivotally connected to the housing 109 by means of<br>
a pivot pin 123.<br>
The resilient flexible member 176 is operably connected to the neck 129 of the<br>
container 130 by abutment of an upper surface of the resilient flexible member 176<br>
against a lower surface 127 of the collar 140, which is attached to the neck 129 of<br>
the container 130.<br>
A stop means 125 is provided to limit rotational movement of the lever 170 away<br>
from the container 130 so as to maintain the resilient flexible member 176 in a<br>
bowed state. The stop means 125 takes the form of one edge of the aperture<br>
through which the lever 170 projects.<br>
The resilient flexible member 176 is connected at one end to the upper end of the<br>
lever 170 by engagement with a groove 134 formed in the lever 170 and is<br>
connected at an opposite end to part of the body structure of the fluid dispensing<br>
device 165 in the form of the housing 109 which has a groove 135 formed therein<br>
with which the resilient flexible member 124 is engaged.<br>
It will be appreciated that if removed from the fluid dispensing device 165 the<br>
resilient flexible member will return to a flat planar shape as it undergoes no plastic<br>
deformation during use but only elastic deformation.<br>
The stop 125 is positioned such that when the lever 120 is displaced fully from the<br>
container 130 so as to rest against the stop 125 the linear distance between the<br>
upper end of the lever 120 and the position of connection of the resilient flexible<br>
member 176 to the housing 109 is less than the un-bowed length of the resilient<br>
flexible member 176. This ensures that the flexible member never returns to a flat<br>
shape. This is important because the resilient flexible member must be bowed<br>
upwardly to function correctly and if it were to be fully released there is a possibility<br>
that upon re-applying a load to it would bow downwardly.<br>
When the lever 120 is moved towards the container 130 so as to cause the container<br>
130 to be moved towards the nozzle 111, the radius of curvature of the bowed<br>
resilient flexible member 176 is reduced and the collar 140 is moved upwardly<br>
thereby causing actuation of the pump.<br>
Operation of the fluid dispensing device 165 is as follows.<br>
After inserting a fluid discharge device 108 into the housing 109 the fluid dispensing<br>
device is ready for use and the lever 170 will be resting against the end stop 125.<br>
To use the fluid dispensing device 165 a user must first grasp the fluid dispensing<br>
device 165 so that contact is made with the lever 170 and in particular with the<br>
ribbed finger grip 146.<br>
Provided that only a light pressure is applied to the lever 170 no fluid will be<br>
discharged and the user is able to manoeuvre the dispensing nozzle 111 of the fluid<br>
dispensing device 165 into a body orifice such as a nasal cavity into which fluid is<br>
required to be dispensed. This is because of the presence of the pre-load means<br>
and in particular because the tooth 150 is abutting with the rib 153..<br>
If the user then exerts more force upon the lever 170 the arm 152 will begin to bend<br>
and when the force applied to the lever 170 reaches a predetermined magnitude the<br>
tooth 150 is able to ride over or become detached from the rib 153 allow the lever<br>
170 to move freely and the interaction of the resilient flexible member 176 upon the<br>
collar 140 will then cause the container 130 to be moved rapidly towards the nozzle<br>
111.<br>
This causes the delivery tube 131 to be pushed into the container thereby actuating<br>
the pump.<br>
Upon releasing the pressure applied to the lever 170, the resilient flexible member<br>
176 will try to assume is least deformed state and so will urge the lever 170 back<br>
upon its stop 125 as soon as the force is removed from the lever 170 allowing the<br>
tooth 150 to re-engage with the rib 153.<br>
The actuating procedure can then be repeated until all of the fluid in the container<br>
has been used. However, only one or two doses of fluid are normally administered at<br>
a time.<br>
When the container 130 is empty a new fluid discharge device 108 is loaded into the<br>
body member 106 thereby restoring the fluid dispensing device 165 into a useable<br>
condition.<br>
With particular reference to Fig.13 there is shown a fluid dispensing device 205<br>
which is in many respects similar to that described with respect to Fig.11 but in which<br>
two levers 220, 221 pivotally supported at their lower ends are used to move a<br>
container 230 forming part of a discharge device 208 housed within a housing 206<br>
by means of an actuating means in the form of a flexible member 241 which as<br>
shown is formed as a single part with the two levers 220, 221 but all three parts<br>
could be made as separate components.<br>
The flexible member 242 is arranged to act against a collar 240 connected to a neck<br>
229 of the container 230 so that when the two levers are squeezed together the<br>
flexible member 241 urges the container towards a nozzle 211 extending from one<br>
end of the housing 206. The movement of the container 230 towards the nozzle 211<br>
causes relative movement between the container 230 and a discharge tube 231<br>
connected to a pump housed within the container 230 thereby actuating the pump<br>
and causing fluid to be urged out through the discharge tube 231 into an orifice 215<br>
formed in the nozzle 211 from whence it is dispensed as fine spray.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 205 is fitted with a fifth embodiment of a pre-load means<br>
in which the pre-load means is interposed between the actuating means 241 and the<br>
housing 206.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of two detents 224, 227 formed on part of the<br>
actuating means and in this case on an upper surface of the flexible member 241 for<br>
engagement with part of the housing. As can be seen, each of the detents 224, 227<br>
is located such that when the levers 220, 221 are in a rest position they abut lightly<br>
against an adjacent outer surface of the housing 206.<br>
When a small force is applied to the two levers 220, 221 the pump is not actuated<br>
because the detents 224, 227 prevent the flexible member from moving but when a<br>
force of a predetermined magnitude is applied to the levers 220, 221 it is sufficient to<br>
cause the detents 224, 227 to disengage from the housing so as to allow the<br>
compression pump to be actuated. Because of the presence of the detents 224, 227<br>
it is ensured that the container 230 is not moved until sufficient force is applied to the<br>
levers 220, 221 to cause rapid movement of the container 230 towards the nozzle<br>
211 and guarantee that an effective spray is produced.<br>
It will be appreciated that alternatively, the pre-load means could comprise of at least<br>
one detent formed on part of the housing for engagement with a complementary<br>
recess formed on part of the actuating means. In which case, each detent would be<br>
disengageable from its respective recess when the pre-determined force is applied<br>
to each lever so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
With reference to Figs 14 to 17 there is shown a fluid dispensing device 305 that is in<br>
many respects similar to those previously described.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 305 comprises of a body 306 forming a nozzle 311 and a<br>
housing 309. A fluid discharge device 308 is housed within the housing 309. The<br>
fluid discharge device 308 comprises of a container 330 in which is fitted a<br>
compression pump (not shown) and a discharge tube 331 extending from one end of<br>
the container 330 for abutment against the nozzle 311. When the discharge tube<br>
331 is moved into the container 330 the pump is actuated and fluid is urged out of<br>
the discharge tube 331 into an orifice 315 in the nozzle from whence it is emitted as<br>
a fine spray.<br>
There is provided a finger operable means in the form of two opposing levers 320,<br>
321 each of which is pivotally supported near a lower end of the housing 309 and is<br>
arranged to act upon an actuating means 322 so as to urge the container 330<br>
towards the nozzle 311 when the two levers 320, 321 are squeezed together.<br>
The actuating means is in the form of two inclined ramps 322 each of which is<br>
arranged to cooperate with a complementary inclined surface 324a formed on a<br>
respective one of the two levers 320, 321. The two ramps 322 are connected to the<br>
container 330 by means of a collar 340 that is engaged with a neck 329 of the<br>
container.<br>
Movement of the two levers 320, 321 towards each other causes the inclined<br>
surfaces 324a to ride up the ramps 322 thereby urging the container towards the<br>
nozzle 311.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 305 is fitted with a pre-load means interposed between<br>
the housing 309 and the levers 320, 321.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of a detent or step 342 formed on each side of the<br>
housing 309 for engagement with an end face of each lever 320, 321.<br>
Movement of the levers 320, 321 is prevented by their engagement with the steps<br>
342 until a pre-determined force is applied to them at which point the force applied is<br>
sufficient to cause the ends of the levers 320, 321 to ride out of the steps 342 and<br>
permit free movement of the levers 320, 321 towards the container 330 thereby<br>
causing actuation of the pump. In this way it is guaranteed that the pump will not be<br>
actuated until sufficient force is being applied to cause a rapid movement of the<br>
discharge tube 331 into the container 330.<br>
With reference to Fig. 18 there is shown a fluid dispensing device 405 that is in many<br>
respects similar to that previously described with reference to Figs. 14 to 17 but in<br>
which the pre-load means is interposed between each lever 420,421 and the<br>
respective actuating means 422.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 405 comprises of a body 406 forming a nozzle 411 and a<br>
housing 409. A fluid discharge device 408 is housed within the housing 409. The<br>
fluid discharge device 408 comprises of a container 430 in which is fitted a<br>
compression pump (not shown) and a discharge tube 431 extending from one end of<br>
the container 430 for abutment against the nozzle 411. When the discharge tube<br>
431 is moved into the container 430 the pump is actuated and fluid is urged out of<br>
the discharge tube 431 into an orifice 415 in the nozzle from whence it is emitted as<br>
a fine spray.<br>
There is provided a finger operable means in the form of the two opposing levers<br>
420,421 each of which is pivotally supported near a lower end of the housing 409 by<br>
being connected together by a flexible strap 423 and is arranged to act upon the<br>
actuating means 422 so as to urge the container 430 towards the nozzle 411 when<br>
the two levers 420,421 are squeezed together.<br>
The actuating means is in the form of two inclined ramps 422 each of which is<br>
arranged to cooperate with a complementary curved surface formed on a respective<br>
one of the two levers 420, 421. The two ramps 422 are connected to the container<br>
430 by means of a collar 440, which is engaged with a neck 429 of the container<br>
430.<br>
Movement of the two levers 420, 421 towards each other causes the curved portions<br>
of the levers 420, 421 to ride up the ramps 422 thereby urging the container 430<br>
towards the nozzle 411.<br>
The fluid dispensing device 405 is fitted with a pre-load means interposed between<br>
the actuating device 422 and the levers 420,421.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of a detent 424a formed on each actuating means in<br>
the form of an inclined ramp 422 for engagement with a recess 446 formed in each<br>
lever 420,421.<br>
Each of the detents 424a is disengageable from its respective complementary<br>
recess 446 when a pre-determined force is applied to the respective lever 420, 421<br>
so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
Operation of the fluid dispensing device is as previously described when a user<br>
grasps the two levers 420,421 with less than the pre-determined force movement of<br>
the levers 420, 421 is prevented by the engagement of the detents 424a with the<br>
recesses 446 but as soon as a force equal to or greater than the pre-determined<br>
force is applied to the levers 420,421 then the detents 424a are able to disengage<br>
or ride out of the recesses 446 and the two levers 420,421 will move rapidly<br>
together thereby actuating the compression pump.<br>
This ensures that the pump is only actuated when sufficient force is being applied to<br>
guarantee the production of an effective spray.<br>
It will be appreciated that the pre-load means could alternatively comprises of at<br>
least one detent formed on each lever for engagement with a respective recess<br>
formed on part of the actuating means. In which case, each detent would be<br>
disengageable from its respective complementary recess when the pre-determined<br>
force is applied to the lever so as to allow the compression pump to be actuated.<br>
With reference to Fig. 19 there is shown a fluid dispensing device 405 that is in many<br>
respects similar to that previously described with reference to Fig 18 but in which an<br>
alternative form of pre-load means is interposed between each lever 420,421 and<br>
the respective actuating means 422. The same reference numerals are used for like<br>
parts and the construction of the fluid dispensing device 405 will not be described<br>
further except so far as it relates to the pre-load means.<br>
The features of the actuating device 422 may be better understood having regard to<br>
Figures 19A and 19B, which show side and perspective views thereof.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of an actuating device 441 having a collar 440 for<br>
receipt by neck 429 of the container 430. The actuating device 441 is provided on<br>
opposing sides with ramps 422, each having a variable mechanical ratio such that<br>
until a pre-determined force is applied to each lever 420,421 no significant force is<br>
transferred to the container 430.<br>
This is achieved by having a first portion 425a of each ramp 422 inclined at a lesser<br>
angle (e.g. approx 20°) to a longitudinal (i.e. vertical, as shown) axis of the fluid<br>
discharge device 408 than is the remaining length 425b (e.g. angle approx. 45°) of<br>
each ramp 422. Therefore when a force is initially applied to each lever 420, 421 it is<br>
applied substantially normal to the longitudinal axis of the fluid discharge device 408<br>
and virtually no force is converted into a force along the longitudinal axis of the fluid<br>
discharge device 408 and so the static friction between the first portion 425a of each<br>
ramp 422 and the cooperating lever 420,421 is sufficient to maintain the levers 420,<br>
421 stationary. However, when a pre-determined load is applied to each lever 420,<br>
421 the static friction is overcome and each lever 420, 421 is able to start moving<br>
along the first portion 425a of the cooperating ramp 422. When each lever 420,421<br>
reaches the end of the first portion 425a, the change in inclination of the surface with<br>
which the lever 420, 421 is cooperating in combination with the magnitude of the<br>
force being applied ensures that each lever 420, 421 suddenly slides rapidly along<br>
the second portion 425b of the cooperating ramp 422 causing the container 430 to<br>
be moved rapidly towards the nozzle 411 to actuate the compression pump.<br>
This ensures that the pump is only actuated when sufficient force is being applied to<br>
guarantee the production of an effective spray.<br>
As visible in Figs. 19A and 19B, the actuating device 441 is also provided on<br>
opposing sides of the collar 440 with guide rails 426a, each perpendicularly arranged<br>
with respective to both ramps 422. The guide rails 426a interact with mating guides<br>
(not visible) on the housing 409 to ensure uniform longitudinal movement of the<br>
container 430 during actuation.<br>
With reference to Figs. 20 and 21 there is shown a fluid dispensing means that is in<br>
most respects identical to that previously described with respect to Figs. 18 and 19<br>
and for which the same reference numerals are used for identical parts. The only<br>
difference between the fluid dispensing device 405 shown in Figs. 20 and 21 and<br>
those shown in Figs. 18 and 19 is the arrangement of the pre-load means, which in<br>
this case is interposed between each of the levers 420,421 and the housing 409. In<br>
addition, an end cap 407 is shown fitted in Figs. 20 and 21.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of two detents or protrusions 428 formed on each of<br>
the levers 420,421 for engagement with a bevelled surface 427 formed around the<br>
periphery of an aperture in the housing 409 through the respective lever 420,421<br>
projects.<br>
When a light force is applied to the two levers 420,421 they are prevented from<br>
moving into the housing by the abutment of the detents 428 with the bevelled<br>
surfaces 427. When the force applied to each lever 420,421 reaches a pre-<br>
determined magnitude it is sufficient to deflect the side walls of the levers 420, 421<br>
inwardly so allowing the detents 428 to ride across the bevelled surfaces 427 into the<br>
housing 409. A soon as the detents have passed over the bevelled surfaces 427 the<br>
levers 420,421 are free to move towards the container 430 housed within the<br>
housing 409 so as to actuate the pump. Once again, this ensures that a reliable<br>
spray is produced.<br>
When the force is released from the levers 420,421 they are moved back towards<br>
their start positions but require the application of a small outward force in order to re-<br>
engage the detents 428 with the bevelled surfaces 427.<br>
With particular reference to Figs. 22 to 24 there is shown a fluid dispensing device<br>
505 having a housing 509 for housing a fluid discharge device 508. The housing has<br>
a nozzle 511 extending out from one end for engagement with a body orifice such as<br>
a nasal cavity.<br>
The fluid discharge device is conventional in nature and as is previously described<br>
having a container 530 for the fluid to be dispensed, a compression pump fixed<br>
within the container 530 and a discharge tube 531 extending out from the pump to<br>
deliver fluid to an orifice 515 formed in the nozzle 511. As previously described the<br>
pump is actuated by pushing the discharge tube 531 into the pump, which is<br>
achieved by moving the container 530 towards the nozzle 511.<br>
A finger operable means is provided to move the container 530, the finger operable<br>
means is in the form of a lever 520 slidably supported within the housing 509 to<br>
apply a force to the container 530 so as to move the container 530 towards the<br>
nozzle 511 and actuate the compression pump.<br>
The lever 520 has two flanges each of which is slidably supported by means of rails<br>
555, 556 that are engaged with U-shaped guides 557 formed in the housing 509.<br>
A pre-load means is provided to prevent the pump being actuated before a pre-<br>
determined force is applied to the lever 520.<br>
The pre-load means comprises of a spring 558 interposed between the lever 520<br>
and the container 530 and a latching means 560, 561. The spring 558 is used to<br>
urge the container 530 towards the nozzle 511 so as to actuate the compression<br>
pump.<br>
The spring is interposed between a collar 540 connected to the container 530 and a<br>
base plate 541. A transfer rod 542 extends out from each side of the base plate for<br>
engagement with an inclined surface 543 formed on each flange of the lever 520.<br>
When the lever 520 is pushed or urged by a user towards the container 530 the<br>
transfer rods 542 move up the inclined surfaces 543 thereby compressing the spring<br>
558. However, the container 530 is not moved because the collar 540 is connected<br>
to the housing 509 by the latching means 560, 561.<br>
The latching means comprises of a rib 560 formed on an internal wall of the housing<br>
509 and two outwardly extending arm 561 connected to the collar 540.<br>
Each of the arms 561 is connected to the collar via a living hinge 563 so that when<br>
the collar 540 moves towards the nozzle 511 the arms 561 are able to abut against<br>
the collar 540 and so transfer load to the rib 560 but when the collar 540 is moving<br>
away from the nozzle 511 the arms 561 are able to flip up so as to allow them to<br>
pass freely over the rib 560. A return spring 565 is provided to return the lever 520<br>
to its normal rest position when no force is being applied to it.<br>
Operation of the fluid dispensing device is as follows.<br>
The application of an initial force to the lever 520 causes the spring 558 to be<br>
compressed by the movement of the lever 520 without any movement of the<br>
container 530 occurring due to the engagement of the arms 561 with the rib 560.<br>
This will continue until a pre-determined force is applied, at which point the means<br>
used to prevent actuation of the compression pump, that is to say the arms 561 and<br>
the rib 560, are overcome by the force being applied to the container 530 by the<br>
spring 558 and the container 530 moves rapidly towards the nozzle 511 so as to<br>
actuate the compression pump.<br>
Upon releasing the force from the lever 520 it is returned to its rest position by the<br>
return spring 565 and a spring within the pump returns the container back to its rest<br>
position so that the arms 561 re-engage with the rib 560.<br>
The use of a spring to move the container has the advantage that a known force is<br>
used to move the container and so a consistent spray can be produced.<br>
It will be appreciated that although the invention has been described with respect to<br>
several specific embodiments there are many alternative combinations and<br>
arrangements that could be used. The primary objective of the invention is to<br>
provide a fluid dispensing device that is operable by one or more levers applying a<br>
force to a container transversely with respect to a longitudinal axis of the container<br>
and which includes some pre-load mechanism or means to prevent the container<br>
from being significantly moved until the force being applied to it reaches a pre-<br>
determined magnitude known to produce a reliable high quality spray.<br>
Administration of medicament may be indicated for the treatment of mild, moderate<br>
or severe acute or chronic symptoms or for prophylactic treatment. It will be<br>
appreciated that the precise dose administered will depend on the age and condition<br>

(20, 21; 120, 121; 170; 220, 221; 320, 321; 420, 421; 520)<br>
so as to apply a force transversely to the fluid discharge device <br>
(8, 108, 208, 308, 408, 508) which is used to move a<br>
container (30, 130, 230, 330, 430, 530) forming part of the<br>
fluid discharge device (8, 108, 208, 308,408, 508) along a<br>
longitudinal axis of the fluid discharge device (8, 108, 208,<br>
308, 408, 508) to cause actuation of a pump forming part<br>
of the fluid discharge device (8, 108,208,308,408,508).A<br>
pre-load means (28; 27, 28; 39,40; 41,42,44; 144,47a, 47b;<br>
150, 152, 153; 224, 227; 342; 424x, 446; 425a; 427, 428;<br>
560, 561) is used to prevent actuation of the pump until a<br>
pre-determined force is applied to each lever (20, 21; 120,<br>
121; 170; 220, 221; 320, 321; 420, 421; 520) of sufficient<br>
magnitude to guarantee the production of a well developed<br>
efficient spray from the fluid dispensing device (5,105,205,<br>
305, 405, 505).</td>
