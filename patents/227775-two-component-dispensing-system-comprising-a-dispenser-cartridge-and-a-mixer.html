				<td>TWO-COMPONENT DISPENSING SYSTEM COMPRISING A DISPENSER<br>
CARTRIDGE AND A MIXER<br>
In most dispensing assemblies, the mixer is fastened<br>
to the cartridge and the assembly is used in this form.<br>
Often an accessory is attached to the mixer to influence the<br>
shape of the mixed components and to allow a targeted<br>
application of the material to the intended location in<br>
special situations. However, there are a number of<br>
applications, more particularly in medicine, where this<br>
simple assembly of dispensing cartridge, mixer, and<br>
accessory device is insufficient.<br>
In medicine, certain joinings are now being sealed<br>
rather than sutured, for which purpose a two-component<br>
sealant is used. Thus, for example, the application of<br>
dispensing assemblies in operations involving the use of an<br>
endoscope requires a long transfer portion between the<br>
cartridge and the mixer, particularly in the case of<br>
laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, relatively long tubes are<br>
introduced into the abdominal cavity, so that quite a long<br>
distance between the cartridge and the dispensing tip may<br>
result.<br>
WO-A2-03/039375 discloses a spraying device for<br>
laparoscopy according to the preamble of claim 1, comprising<br>
a tubular transfer portion adapted to be coupled with a<br>
dispensing device on its inlet side and with a spraying<br>
device on its outlet side, the spraying device including a<br>
mixing chamber with a flexible mixing member. The tubular<br>
transfer portion comprises two longitudinal bores. The<br>
manufacture of tubes having thin longitudinal bores may<br>
become problematic if longer tubes are required.<br><br>
WO-A1-99/32173 disclose an   applicator for spray<br>
dispensing biological liquids, corprising an elongated body<br>
adapted to be connected to a dispensing device on its inlet<br>
side and to a spraying head or its outlet side. This<br>
applicator is neither intenaec nor suitable for laparoscopy.<br>
WO-A-01/74253 discloses a   dispensing device comprising<br>
a dispensing tip having two rigid portions that are<br>
connected to each other by a flexible section. This device<br>
is not intended for laparoscopy.<br>
On the background of this prior art, it is the object<br>
of the present invention to provide a dispensing assembly<br>
where a dispensing cartridge on a dispensing appi iance can<br>
be connected by means of a transfer portion to a relatively<br>
remote mixer or another accessory, e.g. a spraying head, and<br>
that can be manufactured inexpensively. This is accomplished<br>
by the assembly as described in  hereinafter.<br>
THE BRFLEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINCE<br>
The invention will be explained in more detaij<br>
Hereinafter with reference to drawings of a.:) exempiary<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 1   shows an assembly of the invention with an<br>
attached compensating device in a longitudinal<br>
section;<br>
Figure 2   shows an enlarged detail of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3   shows a section according to line 111 - III in<br>
Figure 2;<br>
Figure 4   shows a dispensing assembly of the invention<br>
with the mixer attached;<br><br>
Figure 5   shows an enlarged detail of Figure 3; and<br>
Figure 6   shows a section according to line VI-VI in<br>
Figure 5.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a double cartridge 1 with a coupling ring<br>
2 for the attachment of a transfer portion 3 and a<br>
compensating device 4 fitted to the latter. The coupling<br>
ring and the cartridge comprise bayonet securing means that<br>
are known per se. Other securing means such as e.g. snap<br>
rings are also possible. The compensating device serves to<br>
mutually adjusting the component levels to ensure an<br>
accurate mixing ratio of the components from the beginning<br>
of the dispensing or mixing operation, respectively, and for<br>
a complete air evacuation of "he double cartridge to prevent<br>
any air inclusion therein. These two conditions are<br>
particularly important in the field of medicinal technique.<br>
For an application in endoscopy respectively<br>
laparoscopy, the transfer portion and the mixer may not<br>
exceed a certain small diameter and must be free of stepped<br>
portions. However, for economic reasons, commercially<br>
available cartridges are used which are also intended for<br>
other applications and whose adjacent or concentric outlets<br>
come to a total diameter that is substantially larger than<br>
the allowable diameter of the transfer portion, and<br>
therefore an adapter is required between the cartridge and<br>
the transfer portion to allow the passage of the material<br>
between the cartridge outlets and the channels of the<br>
transfer portion. Moreover, it is advisable also to provide<br>
an adapter between the transfer portion and the mixer or the<br>
compensating device.<br>
Each storage cylinder 11 and 12 of the double<br>
cartridge comprises an outlet 13 and 14 leading to<br><br>
respective channels 15 and 16' in entrance adapter 10. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment, the volumes resp. the cross-sectional<br>
areas and the outlets of the storage cylinders are different<br>
from each other, the ratio varying between 1:1 and 1:10<br>
according to the intended application and the composition.<br>
For reasons related to the production technique,<br>
entrance adapter 10 is made o::: two parts and composed of<br>
adapter body 35 with channels 15 and 16 and on the outlet<br>
side of a flange portion 36 on the tubular portion 37 of<br>
which the jacket 28 of transfer portion 3 is fitted.<br>
The transfer portion consists of a cylindrical bar 38<br>
surrounded by a jacket 28. Bar 38 is provided with two<br>
opposed grooves 39 and 40 forming two channels 17 and 18<br>
together with the jacket, see Figure 3. Care must be taken<br>
here that the two grooves or channels are tightly separated<br>
from each other to prevent that material may pass from one<br>
channel to the other. Tightness nay e.g. be achieved by<br>
press fitting the jacket onto the bar, but other sealing<br>
methods such as a sealing bead or cementing are also<br>
possible.<br>
In the present example, channels 17 and 18 are at a<br>
smaller mutual distance than the two outlets 13 and 14 of<br>
the cartridge, and channels 15 and 16 of the entrance<br>
adapter are shaped such that its outlets 19 and 20 match<br>
channels 17 and 18 of the transfer portion. On the cartridge<br>
side, the end of jacket 28 has a flanging 29 for being<br>
retained by the shoulder of the coupling ring, as appears in<br>
Figures 1 or 4.<br>
At the other end of the transfer portion, an exit<br>
adapter 21 is located with channels 22 that are arranged<br>
concentrically with respect to central channel 23 and whose<br><br>
outlets communicate either wi;h inlets 24 and 25 of the<br>
compensating device or with inlets 26 and 27 of the mixer.<br>
Jacket 2 8 extends beyond the exit adapter, thereby allowing<br>
either the correspondingly shaped inlet of the compensating<br>
device or the mixer inlet to be inserted in this tube<br>
section while additionally providing a stabilization of the<br>
mixer.<br>
As appears in Fig. 6, external channel 18 is connected<br>
to approximately centrally arranged channel 23 by a<br>
transversal channel 41. Channel 17 located at the left of<br>
the drawing ends in a rectangular channel 43 extending up to<br>
a surrounding shoulder 42 in the exit adapter, the shoulder<br>
having a smaller diameter than the jacket, thereby allowing<br>
the material to flow around it. On top of surrounding<br>
shoulder 42, channels 22 extend concentrically around<br>
channel 23. Furthermore, shoulder 42 serves as a rest for<br>
the mixer.<br>
Compensating device 4 conprises an enclosure 30 as<br>
well as two chambers 31 and 32, and it is terminated by a<br>
porous filter 33 that is essentially air permeable only but<br>
capable of retaining the material. It is also possible to<br>
provide a cap having one or a plurality of capillary<br>
opening(s) instead of a porous filter. The enclosure of the<br>
compensating device is preferably made of a transparent<br>
material, thereby allowing to visually ascertain whether the<br>
levels of the two storage cylinders are aligned and the<br>
transfer portion is completely filled with the components.<br>
It is important here that the components arrive in the mixer<br>
simultaneously so that a sealant mixture is achieved from<br>
the beginning of the dispensing operation in the abdominal<br>
cavity.<br><br>
In Figures 1 and 2, the compensating device is<br>
attached to the transfer portion und it appears that<br>
channels 22 and 23 of the exit: adapter communicate with<br>
inlets 24, 25 of the compensating device. After having<br>
pulled off the compensating device, the filling levels of<br>
the two components are at different heights, thereby<br>
ensuring that no reaction may take place at this time.<br>
In Figures 4 and 5, the same cartridge and the same<br>
coupling ring as well as the same transfer portion with exit<br>
adapter 21 are shown whereas a mixer 5 is attached to the<br>
transfer portion. The inlet of the mixer comprises a<br>
connecting portion 6 having elastic tongues 7 with shoulders<br>
8 which engage behind a corresponding stepped portion 9 in<br>
the exit adapter and prevent that the mixer may be pulled<br>
out after having been inserted in the tube of the transfer<br>
portion. The mixer comprises the known mixer elements 34.<br>
As appears in Figures 4 and 5, centrally arranged<br>
channel 23 of the exit adapter is concentrically surrounded<br>
by other channels 22 resp. by the tongues of the mixer<br>
inlet, the channels communicating with mixer inlets 26 and<br>
27.<br>
The sequence of operation.3 may be described as<br>
follows: After having removed the closure cap from the<br>
filled cartridge, the preassembied transfer portion with the<br>
entrance and exit adapters is secured to the cartridge by<br>
means of the coupling ring. Then the compensating device is<br>
introduced into the transfer portion as far as possible and<br>
the entire assembly is directed vertically upwards with the<br>
compensating device at the top to allow air evacuation.<br>
Subsequently, material is dispensed until both<br>
components are visible in the compensating device. It is<br><br>
thereby ensured that both components reach the mixer from<br>
the very beginning of the dispensing operation so that a<br>
sealant mixture is obtained from the beginning. Furthermore,<br>
it is achieved by these measures that also the two storage<br>
cylinders of the cartridge and the transfer portion are free<br>
of air.<br>
Then the compensating device is removed and disposed<br>
of, and the connecting portion of the mixer is introduced<br>
into the tube of the transfer portion and pushed in until it<br>
snaps in, whereby the mixer is operative.<br>
Due to the different design of the channels in the<br>
outlet portion and of those ir. the inlet portion of the<br>
compensating device or in the attached mixer, respectively,<br>
it is avoided that the two components may come into contact<br>
with each other.<br>
In the preceding exemplary embodiment, a cartridge<br>
having side-by-side outlets ar.d side-by-side inlets of the<br>
entrance adapter, as well as side-by-side channels of the<br>
transfer portion have been described which end in concentric<br>
channels of the exit adapter and lead to the concentric<br>
inlets of the mixer or of the compensating device. However,<br>
it is also possible to apply this system of cartridge,<br>
transfer portion, and compensating device or mixer in an<br>
arrangement where the two components are always or partly<br>
disposed concentrically while the adapters are<br>
correspondingly designed.<br>
Furthermore it is possible to extend the dispensing<br>
assembly to the application of three components.<br>
With regard to the application of the assembly of the<br>
invention in endoscopy it is understood that the dimensions<br><br>
and the configuration of the transfer portion and of the<br>
mixer must be adapted to the internal diameter of the<br>
endoscopic tubes while no part of the mixer may have a<br>
greater external diameter than that of the tube of the<br>
transfer portion but may be conically tapered toward the<br>
outlet. In other applications it is of course possible to<br>
choose different dimensions.<br><br>
