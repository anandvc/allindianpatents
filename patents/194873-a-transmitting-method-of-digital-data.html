The invention relates to a method of transmitting digital data in which digital data is retained in sectors each comprising a plurality of sync frames and sequentially transmitting it (including recording of the digital data). <br>
As an RLL (Run Length Limited) encoding method which is performed in order to transmit digital data indicative of information or record the digital data to a recording medium, an EFM (Eight to Fourteen Modulation) which is used for a CD (compact disc) or the like is known.<br>
In the EFM, digital data of eight bits (one byte) is converted to a run length limited code of 14 bits which satisfies run length limitations of:<br>
minimum run length d = 2T;<br>
maximum run length k = 10T, connection bits of three bits are added to intervals among the respective converted data, and the resultant data is formed as an EFM modulation signal. In a sequence of the EFM modulation signals as well, a bit train of the connection bits is set so as to satisfy the foregoing run length limitation.<br>
In the CD, a signal obtained by adding a sync signal<br><br>
to the EFM modulation signal has been recorded. The sequence by the EFM modulation signals is constructed in a manner such that a repetitive pattern of maximum interval which corresponds to the maximum run length k, namely, repetitive pattern such as llT - IIT doesn't exist in the sequence and the repetitive pattern of llT, is used as a sync signal.<br>
In a CD player, the sync signal is extracted by detecting the repetitive pattern of IIT from a signal read out from the CD.<br>
In a DVD (digital video disc) in which recording information has been recorded at a high density or a high-density data transmission, however, when reading the information, it is largely influenced by an inter-symbol interference. The repetitive pattern of IIT as a sync signal is, therefore, changed to a pattern such as IIT -lOT or lOT - IIT and is read out. On the contrary, a case where the data pattern such as lOT - IIT or IIT - lOT as an EFM modulation signal is changed to the repetitive pattern of IIT and is erroneously detected as a sync signal occurs.<br>
As mentioned above, in the high-density recording or high-density data transmission, a frequency of errors which occur in the detection of the sync signal increases and a burst error due to out-of-synchronism easily occurs. SUMMARY AND OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The invention is made to solve the problems mentioned above and it is an object of the invention to provide a transmitting method of digital data whereby the digital data can be reproduced at a high precision even at the time of a high-density recording or a high-density data transmission.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a transmitting method of digital data for retaining digital data in sectors each comprising a plurality of sync frames and sequentially transmitting, wherein the sync frame comprises a sync signal and a run length limited code which corresponds to the digital data and satisfies limitations of a minimum run length and a maximum run length, and the sync signal includes a sync pattern comprising a bit pattern having a run length which is longer than the maximum run length by 3T and addition bit patterns which are arranged before and after the bit pattern and each of which has a run length that is longer than the minimum run length.<br>
According to the invention, there is also provided a transmitting method of digital data for storing the digital data into sectors each comprising a plurality of sync frames and sequentially transmitting, wherein the sync frame comprises a sync signal and a run length limited code which corresponds to the digital data and satisfies limitations regarding a minimum run length and a maximum run length, and the sync signal includes a<br><br>
specific code which indicates a position in the sector and which enables a DC control to be performed.<br>

Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a construction of a transmission signal forming apparatus for forming a transmission signal by a transmitting method of digital data according to the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, an 8-16 (eight to sixteen) modulator 10 converts digital data to be transmitted to an 8-15 modulation signal (run length limited code) of 16 bits (one code word) such that run length limitations of the minimum run length d = 2T and the maximxuti run length k = lOT is satisfied every eight bits.<br>
All of code words obtained by the 8-16 modulator 10 have pattern forms which satisfy any one of the following conditions of Next_Statel to Next_State4. Next_Statel:   Code word in which the number of<br>
continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 0 or 1. Next_State2:  Code word in which the number of<br>
continuous 0 at the termination is equal<br><br>
to 2 to 5 and the first bit and 13th bit of the next code word are equal to 0. Next_State3:   Code word in which the number of<br>
continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 2 to 5 and at least either one of the first and 13th bits of the next code word is equal to 0. Next_State4:   Code word in which the number of<br>
continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 6 to 9. The modulating method has been published by the following paper.<br>
Kees A. Schouhamer Immink, "EFMPlus: The Coding format of the High-Density Compact Disc", IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics, WPM6.1, 1995.<br>
A sync signal generating circuit 20 generates 32 sync signals having different bit patterns as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and transmits them to a synthesizing circuit 30 which preferably includes a CPU and a memory as described later.<br>
Those 32 s^c signals are divided into eight groups of SYO to SY7 as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram showing a format of the sync signal.<br>
In Fig. 4, bits 1 to 3 of the sync signal denote connection bits provided so asto satisfy the foregoing<br><br>
limitations of the minimum run length d and the maximum run length k when the sync signal is connected to a code word just before it. A connection bit pattern by bits 1 to 3 indicate any one of {000}, {001}, and {100}.<br>
A sync pattern to identify the sync signal is allocated to bits 11 to 32 of the sync signal.<br>
The sync pattern is a bit pattern of an arrangement such as (4T or more - 14T - 4T) in which a pattern of 14T that is larger than the maximiom interval IIT in the 8-16 modulation signal by 3T is set to a nucleus and a pattern of a fixed length of 4T and a pattern of 4T or more are arranged after and before the pattern of 14T, respectively, namely, bit pattern of<br>
{0001000000000000010001}.<br>
In this instance, the sync pattern is a fixed pattern which is common to all sync signals as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
In the sync pattern, even when the IIT pattern in the 8-16 modulation signal is edge-shifted due to an influence by an inter-symbol interference and is changed to a pattern of 12T and, further, the sync pattern itself is edge-shifted and is shortened by only IT, in order enable both of them to be distinguished, the pattern of 14T that is larger than the maximum interval IIT in the 8-16 modulation signal by 3T is used. The 14T pattern denotes a shortest length which can be set when considering the edge-shift.<br>
I<br><br>
By arranging an addition bit pattern of a fixed length of 4T and an addition bit pattern of 4T or more after and before the 14T pattern, an interval that is larger than the shortest bits of 3T by at least IT is provided, thereby reducing an influence by the inter-symbol interference with a neighboring mark.<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram showing a transmission signal waveform by the sync pattern.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, if points of leading (trailing when the waveform is inverted) of the edges, namely, an interval between points A and B is detected by a slice level shown by an alternate long and short dash line, even when the slice level is not settled by a pull-in operation or the like, the edge interval can be stably detected. By detecting a 18T pattern in which the 14T pattern and the rear 4T pattern are combined and selecting the pattern in which the pattern of 14T exists, the selected pattern can be used as a signal for a speed detection of a spindle servo upon starting. By setting mark lengths before and after the 14T pattern to be equal to or larger than 4T in which an amplitude is larger than the shortest mark length, a permissible amplitude is increased for a fluctuation of the slice level. Although it is also possible to use the combination of marks of 5T or more, according to the embodiment, since an efficiency is preferentially considered, a rear mark length is set to 4T and a front mark length is set to 4T or more.<br><br>
The reason why the rear pattern of the 14T pattern is set to the fixed length of 4T and the front pattern is set to 4T or more is because when a specific code, which will be described hereinafter, is further set before the 14T pattern, a degree of freedom of the front pattern is increased and the number of patterns to be obtained as a specific code is sufficiently assured.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the specific code is allocated to bits 4 to 10 of the sync signal. Depending on the combination with the connection bits which exist just before the specific code, a position in one sector, which will be explained hereinafter, can be identified.<br>
The synthesizing circuit 30 in Fig. 1 selects any one of the sync signals generated by the sync signal generating circuit 20 every train of the 8-16 modulation signals which are sequentially supplied from the 8-16 modulator 10, namely, every 91 code words and generates a signal obtained by adding the selected sync signal to the head of the 91 code words as a transmission signal corresponding to one sync frame.<br>
Fig. 6 is a diagram showing a format of the transmission signal per one sector which is generated by the synthesizing circuit 30.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, one sector comprises 13 lines. Two sync frames are allocated to each line. The sync signal allocated to each sync frame is selected from the 32 kinds of sync signals shown in Figs. 2 and 3. For<br><br>
example, the sync signal allocated to a front sync frame of the first line corresponds to SYO selected from the 32 kinds of sync signals. Subsequent to the first line, the sync signal which is allocated to the front sync frame is cyclically repeated like SYl to SY4 in accordance with an increase in number of line. Differences among SYl to SY4 are decided by the specific code and connection bits.<br>
The operation of the synthesizing circuit 30 for forming the transmission signal of one sector will now be described with reference to a flow of Fig. 7.<br>
A CPU (central processing unit) and a memory (they are not shown) are included in the synthesizing circuit 30 and information as shown in Fig. 8 has previously been stored in the memory.<br>
In the flow of Fig. 7, the CPU in the synthesizing circuit 30 first sets 1 as an initial address into a built-in register n (step SI). The CPU reads out information corresponding to the address stored in the regis.ter n from the memory shown in Fig. 8, respectively and stores the information into registers X and Y (step S2). When 1 has been stored in the register n, for instance, SYO and SYS stored in address 1 in the memory in Fig. 8 are read out and stored into the registers X and Y, respectively.<br>
The CPU selects the sync signal corresponding to the storage contents in the register X from the 32 kinds of sync signals shown in Figs. 2 and 3 which are supplied<br><br>
from the sync signal generating circuit 20. When SYO has been stored in the register X, for example, the signal corresponding to SYO is selected from the 32 kinds of sync signals shown in Figs. 2 and 3. When the code word existing just before the sync signal is Next_Statel (the number of continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 1 or 0) or Next_State2 (the number of continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 2 to 5), the CPU selects the sync signal in which the connection bit pattern by bits 1 to 3 is set to {000} from SYO shown in Figs. 2 and 3. There are the following two kinds of sync signals SYO in which the connection bit pattern is equal to {000} in Fig. 2: {00010010010001000000000000010001} {00010010000001000000000000010001}<br>
That is, only the values of bit 10 in the specific codes differ with respect to the two sync signals SYO and the numbers of inverting times of them differ when they are NZI modulated. The CPU selects the pattern which is optimum for the DC suppression from the two kinds of patterns and sets the selected pattern to final SY0.<br>
The CPU selects the sync signal corresponding to the storage contents in the register Y. For example, when SYS has been stored in the register Y, the sync signal corresponding to SYS is selected from the 32 kinds of sync signals shown in Figs. 2 and 3. When the code word existing just before the sync signal is Next_State3 (the number of continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 2<br><br>
to 5) or Next_State4 (the number of continuous 0 at the termination is equal to 6 to 9), the CPU selects the sync signal in which the connection bit pattern by bits 1 to 3 is equal to {100} from SYS shown in Figs. 2 and 3. There are the following two kinds of sync signals in which the connection bit pattern is equal to {100} in Fig. 3: {10001001000001000000000000010001} {10000001000001000000000000010001}<br>
That is, only the values of bit 5 in the specific codes differ with respect to the both patterns. The CPU selects the pattern which is optimvim for the DC suppression from the two kinds of patterns and sets the selected pattern to final SYS (step S3).<br>
The CPU generates a pattern obtained by serially connecting the 8-16 modulation signal of 91 code words to each of the sync signals selected on the basis of the storage contents of the registers X and Y as mentioned above as a transmission signal of one line as shown in Fig. 6 (step S4).<br>
The CPU judges whether the contents in the register n are larger than 13 or not (step S5). In step S5, until it is decided that the contents in the register n are larger than 13, the CPU adds 1 to the contents in the register n (step S6) and, after that, repetitively executes the operations in step S2 and subsequent steps. The transmission signals of the first to 13th lines (of one sector) as shown in Fig. 6 are sequentially generated<br><br>
by the repetitive operation.<br>
For example, when it is assumed that 16 sectors are error-correction encoded as one error correction block and the resultant block is transmitted, a decoder side which receives the transmission signal with the structure executes an error correcting process by using the transmission signals each of which has the sector structure as shown in Fig. 6 and which are collected by the number as many as 16 sectors as one error-correction block. In the decoder, it is important that after completion of the reception of the transmission signal, the head of the sector is searched, an address recorded is subsequently immediately read out, and data of the error-correction block is collected. When the high-density transmission is executed, there is a case where the sync signal SYO as a head of the sector cannot be read out or a case where the other signal is erroneously read out as a sector head, so that a possibility such that a fatal error which cannot be corrected is caused occurs.<br>
In the transmission signal according to the invention, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the 32 kinds of sync signals having different bit patterns are prepared and, further, as shown in Fig. 6, the combination pattern of the sync signal to be allocated to each line in one sector is set to a unique pattern every line. As shown in Fig. 6, the sync signal in the front sync frame existing<br><br>
at the head of each line is cyclically repeated like SYl to SY4 in accordance with an increase in number of lines.<br>
On the decoder side which receives the transmission signal having the structure, the line in one sector can be specified by recognizing the combination pattern of the sync signals, so that the position of SYO at the sector head can be predicted. When the line is specified, a preventing function can be further raised for a read error of the sync signal by recognizing the repetitive patterns of SYl to SY4. Since the line is specified on the basis of the combination pattern of the two sync signals existing in one line, it is sufficient to use eight kinds of SYO to SY7 as kinds of sync signals in one sector.<br>
Even when the sync signal SYO as a head of the sector cannot be read out due to the influence by the high-density transmission, therefore, on the decoder side, the head position of the sector is recognized on the basis of the sync signal existing after SYO, thereby enabling a correct error-correction block to be recognized.<br>
As will be obviously understood by Figs. 2 and 3, further, SYO is selected in a manner such that an inter-code distance between SYO and the head syncs (SYl to SY4) of each of the other lines becomes maximum. The inter-code distance denotes a similarity between the sync signals. When there is a sync signal in which the number<br><br>
of 1 differs from that of the other signal, it is determined that the sync signal is a signal of the largest distance. In case of the sync signal in which the number of 1 is equal to that of the other sync signal, the number of shifting times of the position of 1 until the signal coincides with a sync signal is set to the distance with the sync signal. By determining SYO as mentioned above, a probability such that SYl to SY4 are erroneously read as SYO is reduced. In other words, the sync signal which is relatively similar to SYO is set to the intermediate sync signal (SYS to SY7) of each line, and a common sync signal is not used in the head and middle portions of each line. When the common sync signal is not used in the head and middle portions of the line, there is also an effect such that a probability such that the head and middle portions of each line is erroneously recognized by the read error is reduced.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, even when Next_State of the code word just before the sync signal indicates either one of a case of 1 or 2 and a case of 3 or 4, two kinds of 32-bit patterns in which the even and odd numbers of inverting times (the numbers of 1) and the signs of disparity (a difference between positive and negative bits of the waveform) are different respectively are allocated to SYO to SY7. That is, as compared with one pattern, since the polarities of the DC component of the other pattern itself and the signal waveform at the<br>
1<br><br>
termination of the other pattern are opposite to those of one pattern, the DC component of the signal can be reduced by selecting either one of them.<br>
As mentioned above, in the digital data transmitting method according to the invention, when the digital data is retained in the sectors each comprising a plurality of sync frames and is sequentially transmitted, the sync frame comprises the sync signal and the run length limited code which satisfies the limitations of the minimum run length and the maximum run length, and the sync signal includes the sync pattern comprised of the bit pattern of a run length which is longer than the maximum run length by 3T and the addition bit patterns which are arranged before and after the bit pattern and each of which has a run length that is longer than the minimum run length.<br>
According to the invention, therefore, even when the sync signal and signal by the run length limited code are edge-shifted by IT, respectively, due to the influence by the inter-symbol interference, they can be correctly distinguished and detected.<br>
In the digital data transmitting method according to the invention, the sync signal includes the specific code which indicates the position in the sector and which enables the DC control to be performed.<br>
With the construction, therefore, even when the sync signal at the head of thesectorcannot be read out or<br><br>
the other signal is erroneously read out as a sector head, a correct head of the sector can be predicted on the basis of other sync signals, so that digital data can be properly reproduced.<br>
The invention has been  described above with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof. It will be understood that many modifications and variations can be made by those skilled in the art. All of the modifications and variations are incorporated within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
