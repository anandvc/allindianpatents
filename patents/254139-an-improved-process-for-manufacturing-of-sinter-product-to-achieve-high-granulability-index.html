				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates an improved process for manufacturing of sinter product to achieve high granulability Index (GO of Base mix there by increasing productivity of SP#3.<br>
BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION:<br>
In Sinter Making process the primary raw material is the base mix which is fired by ignition furnace on a traveling rate, top sustain the process and combustion a fixed amount Solid fuel trimming is added, which is ignited under the Ignition Furnace. The base mix is pretreated in a equipment known as Mixing Nodulizing Drum (MND) where the main material Base mix is mixed uniformly with finely grinded flux, plant return fines and solid fuel. The primary aim of the MND is to give good permeability in the sinter bed for this the particle come out after treatment in MND must have a homogenous, uniform and granular shape. To achieve this we add calcined lime powder and water in graduated quantity as per the feed rate. World over this is the convention adopted in all Sinter plant and at our SFW3 we also follow the similar process. To check the efficiency of this<br><br>
2<br>
process there is a process parameter called as GI (Granulability Index). Since the commissioning of SP#3 this GI level were abnormally low compared to the standards of 60% as obtained in SP#1 and SP#3. Higher values of GI indicated that the base mix is of uniform and regular shape thus giving better permeability higher Sinter Productivity and quality. Further investigations revealed that there was basic difference in the input raw material characteristics at SP#1 and SP#2. There the base mix contains about 12% plant return sinter i.e., under size obtained from sinter screening at Steel house of F and G BF. There is no such provision at SP#3. Further in SP#1 and SP#2 there facility of Hot screening of sinter, where under size obtained as HRF (Hot return fines) are fed along with base mix in the MND. Theoretical studies so that return fines act as perfect nucleating particle for formation of good granules in MND which improves permeability.<br>
OBJECTS OP THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose an<br><br>
3<br>
improved process for Higher productivity of sinter by improving the GI which eliminates the disadvantages of prior Art<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved process of Sinter product manufacturing to achieve high GI, which improves in production.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose an improved process of Sinter product manufacturing to achieve high GI which utilizes the sensible heat from the plant which was otherwise getting lost<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose an improved process of Sinter product manufacturing to achieve high GI which saves heat energy in terms of no steam being which may have been used.<br>
An yet further object of the present invention is to propose an improved process of Sinter product manufacturing to achieve high GI which increases Sinter production without use additional expanses or resources.<br><br>
4<br>
A still another object of the present Invention is to propose an improved process of Sinter product manufacturing to achieve high GI which incurs low cost of maintenance.<br>
An yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improved process of Sinter product manufacturing to achieve high GI which helps environment Conservation and Ergonomically suitable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
With these above constraint identified we at SP#3 set about in improving the granulability index (GI) of SP#3 base mix coming out from the drum. For this we adopted a three-step strategy. In the First SO of Sep-06 the inner Tega liner which had become worn out were replaced. The lifters inside the drum for mixing was replaced and modified. In the Second along the circumference at the exit of the MND a retainer dam was fabricated for increasingly holding time of material in side the drum. In the third step which is the primary focus of our patient application a method was devises, fabricated and commissioned with entire inter locater and control for extracting<br><br>
5<br>
sensible heat from down coiners to waste Gas main and sinter cool by means of water as conveying medium. The extracted heat in hot water was then added the MND. The process of heat extraction involved laying of pipe lines from common clarifies water line header by means of water flow regulating manifolds as baffles on the hot surface Wind Box down comers. These baffles which has water flowing through extracted significant amount of heat A similar sensible heat extraction process was adopted for capturing radiation heat from circular sinter cooler. The extracted heat in terms of hot water makes its way in MND. A separate control system with pneumatic control valves and mag flow meters have installed, to control the hot water flow into MND as per the process requirement The cumulative increase in water temperature is above 70 deg C.<br>
This hot water acts as a source of heat for reactivity of lime with water for better binding. After two cycles of PDCA this process of Hot water is now fully operational from the first week of Dec-06. There has been increase in granulability sinter production by 100t/shift The most remarkable achievement has been steady<br><br>
6<br>
improvement in GI from a lower value of 25% to an average value of 35%+. The GI index 0.25 mm is also achieve an higher values of 50%+. So after implementation of this hot water addition system the benefit has been threefold: 1. Improve in Production. 2. Improvement 3. Utilization of sensible heat other wise getting lost from Sinter Cooler and Waste Gas main Down comers.<br>
Fig - 1. shows the improvement of GI at Sinter plant #3 with modification in MND and hot water addition.<br><br>
