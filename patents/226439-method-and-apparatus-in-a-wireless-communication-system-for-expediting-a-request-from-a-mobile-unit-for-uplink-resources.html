				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM FOR EXPEDITING A REQUEST FROM A MOBILE UNIT<br>
FOR UPLINK RESOURCES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to wireless communication systems, and more<br>
specifically to a method and apparatus in a wireless communication system for expediting a<br>
request from a mobile unit for uplink resources.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a wireless communication system, such as the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS),<br>
the Base Station System (BSS) can request a Packet Downlink Ack/Nack (PDAK) by polling<br>
on a downlink data block. The mobile can then request uplink resources, when needed, by<br>
sending a channel request in the PDAK. After sending a channel request, the mobile will start a<br>
first timer. The value for the duration of the first timer is set by the network in system<br>
information messages. In GPRS, it can range from a minimum of 500 ms to a maximum of 4<br>
seconds (e.g., for heavily congested systems). If the mobile does not receive a Packet Uplink<br>
Resource Assignment (PUA) after sending a channel request in the PDAK, the mobile will not<br>
send a new channel request in another PDAK until either the first timer expires or a Packet<br>
Access Reject message (PAR) is received. The reason for not allowing a new channel request<br>
before the first timer expires is to prevent the mobile unit from sending multiple channel<br>
requests in a rapid sequence before the base station has had time to respond to the original<br>
channel request, thereby potentially overloading the base station with the additional,<br>
unnecessary channel requests. In the prior-art GPRS, the Packet Access Reject message (PAR)<br>
is sent only when the system is congested and there are no more uplink resources available to<br>
allocate to a mobile that is requesting uplink access through a channel request in the PDAK.<br>
Upon receipt of the PAR, the mobile starts a second timer for a duration of a<br>
WAITJNDICATION value sent with the PAR by the network. The mobile is not allowed to<br>
make another attempt for packet access in the same cell until the second timer expires. It may<br>
attempt packet access in another cell after a successful cell reselection.<br><br>
Under certain circumstances, this can cause the following problem. If a PDAJC<br>
containing a channel request is missed at the network (e.g., due to uplink<br>
interference), a new channel request will not be initiated for the duration of the first<br>
timer (500 ms to 4 sec). Depending upon the value of the first timer, the delay<br>
between the network missing the PDAK containing the channel request and the arrival<br>
of a first uplink data block (upon a successful uplink resource allocation on a next<br>
subsequent channel request in a PDAK received from the same mobile) will be in the<br>
range of 680 to 4180 ms (for the GPRS system). This will substantially degrade the<br>
data transfer rate.<br>
Thus, what is needed is a method and apparatus in a wireless communication<br>
 system for expediting a request from a mobile unit for uplink resources. The method<br>
 and apparatus preferably will not require any modification to the protocol standards<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In overview, the present disclosure concerns communications systems that<br>
utilize base stations to provide service for mobile units or more specifically for users<br>
thereof operating therein. More particularly, various inventive concepts and principles<br>
embodied as a method and apparatus in a base station of a wireless communication<br>
system for expediting a request from a mobile unit for uplink resources for use in<br>
equipment with such communications systems will be discussed and disclosed. The<br>
communications systems of particular interest are those being deployed and<br>
developed such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS),<br>
and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) systems and evolutions<br>
thereof, although the concepts and principles have application in other systems and<br>
devices, as well.<br>
The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the<br>
best modes of making and using various embodiments in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and<br>
appreciation for the inventive principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in<br>
any manner the invention. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims<br>
including any amendments made during the pendency of this application and all<br>
equivalents of those claims as issued.<br>
It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any, such as first and<br>
second, top and bottom, and the like are used solely to distinguish one from another<br>
entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship<br>
or order between such entities or actions.<br>
Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles are<br>
best implemented with or in one or more conventional processors, or with integrated<br>
circuits (ICs) such as custom or application specific ICs. It is expected that one of<br>
ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices<br>
motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic<br>
considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be<br>
readily capable of programming such processors or generating such ICs with minimal<br><br>
experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of any risk of<br>
obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention, further<br>
discussion of such processors and ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials with<br>
respect to the principles and concepts employed by the preferred embodiments.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an example timing diagram 100 depicts an operational<br>
problem in a prior-art wireless communication system. The terminology and<br>
parameter values selected to explain the operational problem are those of the current<br>
General Packet Radio Service. It will be appreciated that other similar wireless data<br>
communication systems may exhibit a similar operational problem, but will likely use<br>
somewhat different terminology and parameter values.<br>
The timing diagram 100 begins with the Base Station System (BSS),<br>
hereinafter referred to as the base station, sending on a downlink to a mobile unit a<br>
Packet Downlink Ack/Nack (PDAK) poll 102 requesting an acknowledgment<br>
message from the mobile unit, the acknowledgment message able to include an uplink<br>
channel request when needed by the mobile unit. PDAK polls are sent periodically to<br>
the mobile, the periodicity dependent upon traffic conditions.<br>
In this example, the mobile unit needs uplink resources, so it responds to the<br>
PDAK poll 102 by transmitting on an uplink a channel request 104 in a PDAK.<br>
Concurrent with transmitting the channel request 104, the mobile unit starts a first<br>
timer having a duration value of 500 ms to 4 seconds, set by the communication<br>
system. The first timer will prevent the mobile unit from sending an additional<br>
channel request until the first timer expires, or until the mobile receives a packet<br>
access reject (PAR) indicating that there are currently no uplink resources available to<br>
assign to the mobile. When received, the PAR contains a WAIT_IDICATION<br>
value, which, in effect, stops the first timer and starts a second timer having a duration<br>
equal to the WAIT_ICATION value. The second timer also will prevent the<br>
mobile unit from sending an additional channel request until the second timer expires.<br>
Unfortunately, in the example timing diagram 100, the channel request 104 is<br>
not received by the base station (e.g., due to uplink interference). The base station<br>
thus does not send anything to the mobile unit until it is time for a next PDAK poll<br>
106. The mobile unit responds to the PDAK pole by sending a PDAK 108, but<br>
without a channel request, because the first timer has not expired. Again, the base<br><br>
station sends another PDAK pole 110 to the mobile unit, which again responds by<br>
sending a PDAK 112 without a channel request, because the first timer still has not<br>
expired. The base station sends yet another PDAK pole 114 to the mobile unit. At this<br>
point the first timer has expired, and the mobile unit responds to the PDAK poll 114<br>
by transmitting a channel request 116 in a PDAK. This time, the base station receives<br>
the channel request and returns a Packet Uplink Resource Assignment (PUA) 118 to<br>
the mobile. While it is true that the mobile finally managed to receive the desired<br>
PUA, the effect of the first timer has been to delay the PUA substantially, thereby<br>
substantially degrading the data rate.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a timing diagram 200 depicts a solution to the operational<br>
problem described herein above, in accordance with the present invention. The timing<br>
diagram 200 begins with the base station sending to a mobile unit a PDAK poll 202<br>
requesting an acknowledgment message from the mobile unit, the acknowledgment<br>
message able to include an uplink channel request when needed by the mobile unit.<br>
In this example, the mobile unit needs uplink resources, so it responds to the<br>
PDAK poll 202 by transmitting a channel request 204 in a PDAK. Concurrent with<br>
transmitting the channel request 204, the mobile unit starts a first timer having a<br>
duration value of 500 ms to 4 seconds, set by the communication system. The first<br>
timer will prevent the mobile unit from sending an additional channel request until the<br>
first timer expires, or until the mobile receives a packet access reject (PAR.) indicating<br>
that currently there are no uplink resources available to assign to the mobile. When<br>
received, the PAR contains a WAITJNDICATION value, which, in effect, stops the<br>
first timer and starts a second timer having a duration equal to the<br>
WAIT_INDICATION value. The second timer also will prevent the mobile unit from<br>
sending an additional channel request until the second timer expires.<br>
As in the previous example, the channel request 204 is not received by the<br>
base station (e.g., due to uplink interference). The base station, however, is aware that<br>
it has sent the PDAK poll to the mobile unit and can easily determine, through well-<br>
known techniques, an expected time by which the acknowledgment message from the<br>
mobile should be received at the base station, if all goes according to plan. When the<br>
acknowledgment message including the uplink channel request has not been received<br>
by the base station by the expected time, the base station responds by conditionally<br><br>
sending to the mobile unit a "speculative" Packet Access Reject (PAR) message 206,<br>
in accordance with the present invention. The conditions under which the base will<br>
send the speculative PAR will be disclosed further herein below.<br>
The speculative PAR 206 is preferably a normal PAR message in accordance<br>
with the protocol standards employed by the communication system, and is set by the<br>
system to have a very small WAIT_INDICATION value, e.g., a value of zero. It is<br>
important to emphasize that in the prior-art system, the PAR message is sent in<br>
response to a received uplink channel request and only when the system is congested<br>
and there are no more uplink resources available to allocate to the requesting mobile.<br>
In the situation described herein above, the uplink channel request sent by the mobile<br>
was not received by the base station, and the system is not congested, so the prior-art<br>
system would not send a PAR message under these conditions. One exemplary<br>
embodiment of the speculative PAR, in accordance with the present invention, will<br>
now be described further.<br>
First, an explanation of why the speculative PAR is called "speculative" is in<br>
order. This is because the base station is aware of the operational status of the mobile<br>
unit (more on this later). Furthermore, the base station is aware that it has not received<br>
the requested acknowledgment message from the mobile unit by the expected time.<br>
Given the operational status of the mobile unit, the base station is able to speculate<br>
about the likelihood that the missed PDAK included a channel request. If the<br>
likelihood is high, the base station will send the speculative PAR.<br>
When the mobile unit receives the speculative PAR, it will immediately stop<br>
the first timer and set the duration of the second timer to the WAIT_INDICATION<br>
value, preferably zero, sent in the speculative PAR. Voila! The mobile unit is now<br>
primed to send another uplink channel request as soon as it receives another PDAK<br>
poll from the base station.<br>
Referring again to the timing diagram 200, the base station next sends to the<br>
mobile a "bait" PDAK poll 208. The bait PDAK poll 208 preferably is a standard<br>
PDAK poll in accordance with the protocol employed by the communication system,<br>
and is sent in the next downlink timeslot available for communication with the mobile<br>
unit. The mobile unit responds to the bait PDAK poll 208 by sending a standard<br>
PDAK message 210 including when needed, the uplink channel request. The base<br><br>
station responds by sending a Packet Uplink Resource Assignment (PUA) 212 to the<br>
mobile.<br>
By sending the speculative PAR 206 and the bait PDAK poll 208 as just<br>
described, the base station in accordance with the present invention advantageously<br>
reduces the time required to establish uplink traffic flow (in GPRS) by at least 360 ms<br>
and potentially up to 3880 ms, depending upon the duration value of the first timer in<br>
the mobile unit, as set by the communication system. This can substantially increase<br>
the effective data rate of the communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a flow diagram 300 depicts an exemplary method for<br>
expediting a request from a mobile unit for uplink resources. The flow begins with the<br>
base station sending 302 a first request for an acknowledgment message from the<br>
mobile unit, the acknowledgment message comprising an uplink channel request<br>
when needed by the mobile unit. The base station next determines 304 an expected<br>
time for receiving the acknowledgment message. The expected time can, for example,<br>
be determined by adding a known round-trip delay time to the current time of day.<br>
The base station monitors the uplink to check 306 whether the acknowledgment<br>
message has been received by the expected time. If so, the base station proceeds<br>
normally 310, e.g., processing the acknowledgment message according to its contents.<br>
On the other hand, if the acknowledgment message has not been received by<br>
the expected time, the base station sends or preferably conditionally sends a<br>
speculative packet access reject message (PAR) to the mobile unit, followed by a<br>
second request for the acknowledgment message (bait poll). Here "conditionally<br>
sends" means "sends when certain specified conditions are met." In general, the base<br>
station conditionally sends the speculative packet access reject message only when the<br>
mobile unit is not actively transmitting uplink data, and no uplink channel request is<br>
queued for the mobile and waiting to be processed. In addition, the base station<br>
preferably conditionally sends the speculative packet access reject message only when<br>
the base station is not waiting for the mobile unit to retransmit the uplink channel<br>
request, in response to an earlier-sent speculative packet access reject message and<br>
second request. Here, "not waiting for" implies that the expected time for receiving<br>
the response to the second request has not yet arrived.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the system is programmed with a maximum number of<br>
sequential speculative packet access reject messages allowed during a predefined<br>
downlink data flow. In that embodiment, the base station sends the speculative packet<br>
access reject message only when the maximum number of sequential speculative<br>
packet access reject messages allowed during the predefined downlink data flow has<br>
not been reached. It will be appreciated that the maximum number can be a function<br>
of the number of mobile units doing active downlink data transfers on a given<br>
timeslot.<br>
In another embodiment, the base station sends the speculative packet access<br>
reject message only when a downlink temporary block flow (i.e., downlink data being<br>
sent to the mobile unit) is one of: (a) operating in a delayed downlink release mode,<br>
and (b) operating within a predetermined time of beginning the delayed downlink<br>
release mode. In the delayed downlink release mode, the base station has completed<br>
sending actual data and has begun sending dummy blocks for a predetermined<br>
duration. This keeps the downlink established long enough for the mobile to request<br>
new uplink resources for acknowledging the received downlink data.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the base station sends the speculative packet<br>
access reject message only when the mobile unit has subscribed to a Quality of<br>
Service (QoS) greater than a predetermined level. In other words, in this embodiment,<br>
the user of the mobile unit, perhaps in exchange for higher payments, can get the<br>
higher data rate provided in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, an electrical block diagram depicts an exemplary base<br>
station 400 in accordance with the present invention. The base station 400 comprises a<br>
conventional transmitter 402 that sends a first request for an acknowledgment<br>
message from a mobile unit, the acknowledgment message able to carry an uplink<br>
channel request when needed by the mobile unit. The base station 400 further<br>
comprises a conventional processor 404 coupled to the transmitter 402 for controlling<br>
the transmitter 402, and a conventional receiver 406 coupled to the processor 404 for<br>
attempting to receive the acknowledgment message. In addition, the base station<br>
preferably includes a real-time clock 420, e.g., a conventional Global Positioning<br>
System receiver, for accurately determining the current time of day. The base station<br>
400 also includes a conventional memory 408 that stores executable software<br><br>
programs for advantageously programming the processor 404 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The transmitter 402 and the receiver 406 are preferably similar to<br>
those utilized in the base stations of the GPRS communication systems available from<br>
Motorola, Inc. and others. The processor 404 is preferably a member of the MC68000<br>
family of processors available from Motorola, Inc. It will be appreciated that,<br>
alternatively, other similar types of receivers, transmitters, and processors can be<br>
utilized in the base station 400. It will be further appreciated that all or portions of the<br>
real-time clock 420, the processor 404, and the memory 408 can be fabricated as a<br>
custom integrated circuit.<br>
The memory 408 comprises a conventional communications program 410 for<br>
programming the processor 404 to communicate according to a desired<br>
communication protocol standard, e.g., the GPRS protocol standard or other protocols<br>
with similar functionality. The memory 408 further comprises a first acknowledgment<br>
requester program 412 for programming the processor 404 to control the transmitter<br>
402 to send the first request for the acknowledgment message. The memory 408 also<br>
includes an acknowledgment timer program 414 for programming the processor 404<br>
to determine an expected time for receiving the acknowledgment message. In<br>
addition, the memory 408 includes a speculative PAR sender 416 for programming<br>
the processor 404 to control the transmitter 402, in response to not receiving the<br>
acknowledgment message by the expected time, to conditionally send a speculative<br>
packet access reject message to the mobile unit. The conditions for sending the<br>
speculative PAR are those disclosed herein above in the description of the flow chart<br>
300. The memory 408 further includes a second acknowledgment requestor program<br>
418 for programming the processor 404 to send a second request for the<br>
acknowledgment message following the speculative PAR.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an electrical block diagram depicts an exemplary wireless<br>
communication system 500. The communication system 500 comprises a plurality of<br>
conventional mobile units 502, e.g., the mobile units employed in the GPRS<br>
communication systems available from Motorola, Inc. and others. The communication<br>
system 500 further comprises at least one of the base stations 400 coupled wirelessly<br>
to the plurality of mobile units 502. In addition, the communication system 500<br>
includes a conventional controller/switch 504 coupled to the at least one of the base<br><br>
stations 400. The controller/switch 504 is preferably similar to those utilized in the<br>
GPRS communication systems available from Motorola, Inc. and others. In addition,<br>
the communication system 500 can be optionally coupled to a network 506, e.g., a<br>
private data network or the Internet for communicating therewith. The<br>
communications system 500 can advantageously utilize the principles and concepts<br>
disclosed and discussed above to expedite services for the mobile units, provided the<br>
base stations 400 are constructed, arranged and configured to operate in accordance<br>
with these principles and concepts.<br>
Thus, it should be clear from the preceding disclosure that the present<br>
invention provides a method and apparatus in a base station of a wireless data<br>
communication system for expediting a request from a mobile unit for uplink<br>
resources. The method and apparatus advantageously does not require any<br>
modification to the protocol standards currently employed by the wireless data<br>
communication system.<br>
This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various<br>
embodiments in accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true, intended,<br>
and fair scope and spirit thereof. The foregoing description is not intended to be<br>
exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications or •<br>
variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen<br>
and described to provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its<br>
practical application, and to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the<br>
invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the<br>
particular use contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the<br>
scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims, as may be amended<br>
during the pendency of this application for patent, and all equivalents thereof, when<br>
interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly, legally, and<br>

followed by sending from the base station to the mobile unit a second request for the acknowledgment<br>
message.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sending from the base station to the mobile unit<br>
the speculative packet access reject message comprises conditionally sending the speculative packet<br>
access reject message only when at least one of:<br>
the mobile unit is not actively transmitting uplink data,<br>
no uplink channel request is queued for the mobile and waiting to be processed.<br>
the base station is not waiting for the mobile unit to retransmit the uplink channel request in<br>
response to an earlier-sent speculative packet access reject message and second request,<br>
a maximum number of sequential speculative packet access reject messages allowed during a<br>
predefined downlink data flow has not been reached, and<br>
the mobile unit has subscribed to a Quality of Service (QoS) greater than a predetermined level.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sending from the base station to the mobile unit<br>
the speculative packet access reject message comprises conditionally sending the speculative packet<br>
access reject message only when a downlink temporary block flow is one of : operating in a delayed<br>
downlink release mode, and operating within a predetermined time of beginning the delayed downlink<br>
release mode.<br><br>
4.	An apparatus for use in a base station of a wireless data communication system for expediting a<br>
request from a mobile unit for uplink resources, the apparatus comprising :<br>
a transmitter for sending from the base station to the mobile unit a first request for an<br>
acknowledgment message from the mobile unit, the acknowledgment message comprising an uplink<br>
channel request when needed by the mobile unit;<br>
a receiver for receiving the acknowledgment message, and<br>
a processor for controlling the transmitter and the receiver, wherein the processor is<br>
programmed to :<br>
determine an expected time for receiving the acknowledgment message ; and<br>

mobile unit, followed by a second request for the acknowledgment message.<br>
5.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the processor is programmed to send the<br>
speculative packet access reject message from the base station to the mobile unit only when at least one<br>
of:<br>
the mobile unit is not actively transmitting uplink data.<br>
no uplink channel request is queued for the mobile and waiting to be processed,<br>
the base station is not waiting for the mobile unit to retransmit the uplink channel request, in<br>
response to an earlier-sent speculative packet access reject message and second request,<br>
a maximum number of sequential speculative packet access reject messages allowed during a<br>
predefined downlink data flow has not been reached, and<br>
the mobile unit has subscribed to a Quality of Service (QoS) greater than a predetermined level.<br>
6.	The apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the processor is programmed to send the<br>
speculative packet access reject message from the base station to the mobile unit only when a downlink<br>
temporary block flow is one of:<br>
operating in a delayed downlink release mode, and<br>
operating within a predetermined time of beginning the delayed downlink release mode.<br><br>
7.	A base station in a wireless data communication system for expediting a request from a mobile<br>
unit for uplink resources, the base station comprising :<br>
a transmitter to send from the base station to the mobile unit a first request for an<br>
acknowledgment message from the mobile unit, the acknowledgment message able to carry an uplink<br>
channel request when needed by the mobile unit;<br>
a receiver to receive the acknowledgment message when provided, and<br>
a processor to control the transmitter and the receiver; wherein the processor is programmed to :<br>
determine an expected time for receiving the acknowledgment message ; and<br>
in response to not receiving the acknowledgment message by the expected time,<br>
conditionally send a speculative packet access reject message from the base station to the<br>
mobile unit, followed by a second request for the acknowledgment message.<br>
8.	The base station as claimed in claim 7, wherein the processor is programmed to send the<br>
speculative packet access reject message from the base station to the mobile unit only when at least one<br>
of:<br>
the mobile unit is not actively transmitting uplink data,<br>
no uplink channel request is queued for the mobile and waiting to be processed,<br>
the base station is not waiting for the mobile unit to retransmit the uplink channel request in<br>
response to an earlier-sent speculative packet access reject message and second request.<br>
a maximum number of sequential speculative packet access reject messages allowed during a<br>
predefined downlink data flow has not been reached, and<br>
the mobile unit has subscribed to a Quality of Service (QoS) greater than a predetermined level.<br>
9.	The base station as claimed in claim 7, wherein the processor is programmed to send the<br>
speculative packet access reject message from the base station to the mobile unit only when a downlink<br>
temporary block flow is one of:<br>
operating in a delayed downlink release mode, and<br>
operating within a predetermined time of beginning the delayed downlink release mode.<br><br>
A base station (400) and corresponding method (300) sends (302) a first request for an acknowledgment message<br>
from a mobile unit (502), the acknowledgment message including an uplink channel request when needed by the mobile unit. The<br>
base station determines (304) an expected time for receiving the acknowledgment message. In response to not receiving the acknowledgment<br>
message by the expected time, the base station conditionally sends (308) a speculative packet access reject message to the<br>
mobile unit, followed by a second request for the acknowledgment message.</td>
