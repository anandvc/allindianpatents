The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel pyrrolo [2.1-c][l,4]benzodiazepine hybrids useful as potential antitumour agents. This invention relates to a process for the preparation of new pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine hybrids as potential antitumour agents. More particularly, it provides a process for the preparation of 7-methoxy-8-[N-(1"-pyrenyl)-alkane-3'-carboxamide]-oxy-(11aS)-1,2,3,11a-tetraydro 5H-pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepin-5-one, with aliphatic chain length variation of these<br>
compounds and it also describes the DNA binding, anticancer (antitumour) activity. The<br>
structural formula of this novel pyrrolo[2.1-c] [ 1,4]benzodiazepine is given below:<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Background of the invention<br>
Pyrrolo[2,l-6'][l,4]benzodiazepine antitumour antibiotics are commonly known as anthramycin class of compounds. In the last few years, a growing interest has been show n in the development of new pyrrolo[2,l -c][ 1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs). These antibiotics react covalently with DNA to form an N2-guanine adduct that lies within the minol groove of duplex DNA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position (Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa. H.; Miyamoto, M.; Takeuchi, T.; and Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L. J. Mol. Biol, 1970, 57, 551.; Hurley, L. H.; Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley. L. 11. Biochmestry, 1981, 20, 7572). The molecules have a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DNA spanning three base pairs. Recently, PBD dimers have been developed that comprises two C2-exo-methylene substituted DC-81 subunits tethered through their C-8 position via an inert propanedioxy linker (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartely, J. A.; Brooks, N. A.. Adams, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E. J. Med. Clem. 2001. 44. 737). A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units through their C-8 positions to give bisfunctional<br><br>
alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DNA (Thurston, D. E.; Bose, D. S.; Thomson, A.<br>
S Howard, P, W.; Leoni, A., Croker, S. J.; Jenkins, T. C ; Neidle, S. and Hurley, L. H. J.<br>
Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 8141).<br>
Recently, a noncross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized<br>
that have significant DNA binding ability and potent anti tumour activitiy. (Kamal, A.;<br>
Ramesh, G., Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, O.; Neelima, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, <br>
Naturally occurring pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepines belong to a group of<br>
antitumour antibiotics derived from Streptomyces species. Recently, there is much impetus<br>
for the PBD systems as they can recognize and bind to specific sequence of DNA. Examples<br>
of naturally occurring PBD's include anthramycin, DC-81, tomaymycin, sibiromycin and<br>
neothramycin. However, the clinical efficacy for these antibiotics is hindered by several<br>
limitations, such as poor water solubility, cardiotoxicity, development of drug resistance and<br>
metaboi:. ;nactivation<br>

Cytotoxicity:<br>
Compounds Ve and Vg were evaluated the primary anti-cancer activity (Table 1) and<br>
further Ve have been evaluated in vitro against sixty human tumour cells derived from nine<br>
cancer types (leukemia, non-small-cell lung, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, and<br>
breast cancer). For each compound, dose response curves for each cell line were measured at<br>
a minimum of five concentrations at 10 fold dilutions. A protocol of 48 h continuous drug<br>
exposure was used and a sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein assay was used to estimate cell<br>
viability or growth. The concentration causing 50% cell growth inhibition (GI50), total cell<br>
growth inhibition (TGI 0% growth) and 50% cell death (LC50, -50% growth) compared with<br>
the control was calculated. The mean graph midpoint values of logioTGI and logioLC50 as<br>
well as logio GI50 for Ve are listed in Table 2. As demonstrated by mean graph pattern,<br>
compound Ve exhibits an interesting profile of activity and selectivity for various cell lines.<br>
The mean graph mid point of logio TGI and logio LC50 showed similar pattern to the logio<br>
