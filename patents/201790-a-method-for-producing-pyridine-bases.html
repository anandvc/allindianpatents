A METHOD FOR PRODUCING PYRIDINE BASES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing pyridine bases by reacting in a gas-phase an aliphatic baldheaded, aliphatic ketones or mixture thereof with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
A method for producing pyridine bases by reacting in a gas-phase an aliphatic baldheaded, aliphatic ketones or mixture thereof with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst is known. Various methods are reported, for example, a method in which an amorphous silica-lamina is used as a catalyst, a method in which zealots such as aluminosilicate and the like are used, as well as other methods. Among the catalysts, elite is suitable as a catalyst for producing pyridine bases in which a gas-phase reaction is conducted under high temperature condition, due to its excellent heat-resistance.<br>
As the zealots used as a catalyst for producing pyridine bases, for example, heterosilicates such as Ferro silicate, borosilicate and gall silicate, in addition to aluminosilicate, are known. These zealot’s are used singly as a catalyst. Alternatively, they are allowed to contain an ion and/or compound of various elements, such as copper, zinc, cadmium, bismuth, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, iridium and the like, to give a catalyst to be used.<br>
In the production of pyridine bases, it is known that main products, the pyridine bases, are determined by<br><br>
combination of the raw materials, an aliphatic baldheaded and an aliphatic ketones. Typical examples of them are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
As described above, various pyridine bases can be produced by reacting in a gas-phase an aliphatic baldheaded, aliphatic ketones or mixture thereof with ammonia in the presence of a elite as a catalyst. However, the yields of pyridine bases produced by conventional methods are yet low.<br>
For example, in the comparative examples described bellow, which were conducted by the present inventors and in which acetaldehyde is reacted with ammonia to produce (X -<br><br>
picoline and 7-picoline according to the above-described conventional methods, namely, by using aluminosilicate,<br>
ferrosilicate or the like as the catalyst, the yields of Ct<br>
-pickling and 7 -pickling were , respectively, 17 . 6% and 18 . 5% when aluminosilicate was used, 18.6% and 17.5% when<br>
f err silicate was used, and 17 . 3% and 19 . 3% when Gallo silicate<br>
was used.<br>
Thus, the yields of the intended pyridine bases in conventional methods are not yet satisfactory, and further improvements in the yield is desired<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied for finding a method that can produce pyridine bases in higher yield. As a result, the present inventors have found that, when pyridine bases are produced by reacting in a gas-phase an aliphatic baldheaded, aliphatic ketene or mixture thereof with ammonia in the presence of a zealots containing titanium and/or cobalt and silicon as zealots constituent elements in which the atomic ratio of silicon to titanium and/or cobalt is about 5 to about 1000, pyridine bases can be produced at higher yield as compared with the conventional case in which a zealots such as aluminosilicate, ferrosilicate or the like is used as the catalyst. Thus, the present invention has been completed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for producing pyridine bases which comprises reacting in a gas-phase an aliphatic baldheaded, aliphatic ketones or mixture thereof with<br><br>
ammonia in the presence of a eolith containing titanium and/or cobalt and silicon as solute constituent elements in which the atomic ratio of silicon to titanium and/or cobalt is about 5 to about 1000.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The production of pyridine bases according to the present invention is conducted by using an aliphatic baldheaded, aliphatic ketones or mixture thereof corresponding to the intended pyridine bases and allowing them to react in a gas-phase with ammonia in the presence of the specific zealots described above.<br>
The aliphatic baldheaded is preferably an aliphatic aldehyde having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples thereof include saturated aliphatic aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butylaldehyde and the like, and unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes such as acrolein, methacrolein, crotonaldehyde and the like.  The aliphatic ketone is preferably an aliphatic ketone having 3 to 5 carbon atoms . Examples thereof include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone and the like. Dime’s, timers, other legumes and polymers which generate an aliphatic aldehyde or aliphatic ketone can also be used as the raw material. Relation between the raw material, namely combinations of aliphatic aldehydes and aliphatic ketones, and the main product, namely the pyridine bases, are exemplified in the above-described Table 1.<br>
As described above, a zealots containing titanium and/or<br><br>
cobalt and silicon as zealots constituent elements in which the atomic ratio of silicon to titanium and/or cobalt is about 5 to about 1000 and the constraint index is about 0.8 to about 12 is used as the catalyst in the reaction of the present invention. Hereinafter, the above-described zeolite which is used as the catalyst in the present invention is referred to as titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite. Examples of the titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite include titan silicates containing titanium and silicon as zeolite constituent eremites, cobalt silicates containing cobalt and silicon as zeolite constituent elements, and zeolites containing titanium, cobalt and silicon as zeolite constituent elements. One or more of them can be used as the catalyst in the reaction of the present invention. The atomic ratio of silicon to titanium and/or cobalt in the titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite used in the present invention is preferably from about 10 to about 500.<br>
The catalyst used in the present invention can be prepared by a conventionally known method. Various titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolites, which are different from each other in the atomic ratio of silicon to titanium and/or cobalt, crystal structure or the like, can be obtained easily. For example, they can be prepared in the same manner as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos . 63-54358 , 60-12135, 56-96720 and 55-7598, Journal of Catalysis, 130, 440 (1991), Applied Catalysis A: General, 126, 51 (1995), Zeolite, 17(4), 354 (1996) and the like.<br>
The crystal structure of the catalyst used in the present<br><br>
invention is not particularly limited, although those having a pintail type crystal structure are preferable. Among others, those having a MFI type or MEL type crystal structure are more preferable.<br>
In the present invention, a titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite can be used as it is, although a titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite being allowed to further contain an ion and/or compound of one or more elements selected from group I to XVII elements is preferable, since when it is used, the yield of pyridine bases increases.<br>
The group I to XVII elements are elements listed in the 18-groups type periodic table of element.  Specific examples thereof include Li, K, Rob and Cs as group I elements, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba as group II elements, Sc, Y and lanthanides elements , La, Coe, Pr, Ned, Er and Yb, as group III elements, Ti, Zr and Hf as group IV elements, V, Nb and Ta as group V elements, Cr, Mo and W as group VI elements, Mn, Tc and Re as group VII elements, Fe, Ru and Os as group VIII elements, Co, Rh and Ir as group IX elements, Ni, Pd and Pt as group X elements, Cu and Ag as group XI elements, Zn and Cd as group XII elements, Al, Ga, In and Tl as group XIII, Get, Son and Pub as group XIV elements, Sb and Bi as group XV elements, Po as group XVI element, and F, CI as group XVII elements. Among others, Tl and Pb are preferable.<br>
As the ion and/or compound of group I to XVII elements, ions thereof, oxides, halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, hydroxides, sulfides, silicates, titivates, borates and carbonates thereof and the like can be exemplified.<br><br>
One or more of them can be contained in the titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite. Examples of the method for allowing a titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite to contain these ion and/or compound include an ion exchange method, kneading method, impregnation method, dipping method, deposition method, evaporation drying method and the like, although the method is not limited to these examples. Specific examples thereof are described below.<br>
(D An example of ion exchange method<br>
k water soluble salt of the above-described element, such as chloride, nitrate, acetate and the like, is dissolved in water in a concentration of 0.01 to 2 g ion/liter-<br>
Then, an alkali ion form, ammonium ion (NH4”) form or proton (H”) form titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite, preferably a NH4  form titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite, is added to the aqueous solution obtained above and stirred at a given temperature, then filtrated, and this procedure is repeated.<br>
Thereafter, the finally resulted filtrated residue is washed with water. Thus obtained titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite containing an ion of the above-described element is dried, and if necessary, acclaimed.<br>
An example of kneading method<br>
A compound of the above-described element is kneaded with a H” or NH4” form titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite, if necessary, together with water. Then, the kneaded<br><br>
product is dried, and, if necessary, calcite.<br>
An example of dipping method<br>
A water soluble salt of the above-described element<br>
is dissolved in water.<br>
Then, a NH4"' form or H"“" form titan and/or cobaltsilicate<br>
zeolite, preferably a NH4” form titan and/or<br>
cobaltsilicate zeolite is dipped in this solution.<br>
Thereafter, the dipped zeolite is dried, and if necessary,<br>
calcined.<br>
An example of deposition method<br>
A NH4” form or H” form titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite is dispersed in an aqueous solution of a water soluble salt of the above-described element.<br>
An aqueous ammonia solution is added to this mixture to allow a hydroxide of the above-described element to deposit on the surface of the NH4” form or H” form titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite, then filtered.<br>
Thereafter, the filtrated residue is washed with water and dried, and if necessary, calcined.<br>
An example of evaporation drying method<br>
A compound of the above-described element and a NH4” form or H” form titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite are stirred in water to mix them.<br>
Thereafter, an evaporation drying is conducted, then, if necessary, a calcinations is conducted.<br>
In any of the above-described methods, the calcinations<br>
is usually conducted at 350 to SOO'C for several hours under the atmosphere of air, nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide.<br><br>
However, since the catalyst is heated in a reactor during tine gas-phase contact reaction, the calcinations of the catalyst is not necessarily required.<br>
The preferable range of content of the ion and/or compound of one or more elements selected from group I to XVII elements varies depending on kind of the titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite or kind or form of the element contained therein. Usually, the preferable range is from 0.0005 to 10 mg eq., more preferably from 0.01 to 5, per 1 g of the zeolite containing titanium and/or cobalt and silicon as zeolite constituent elements.<br>
The titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite used in the present invention can be molded into a desired shape such as solid cylinder, hollow cylinder and the like by a tablet machine or extruder, as it is or after a binder such as silica, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, bentonite, alumina, silica alumina or the like, and water, polyvinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate is added thereto. The molded article is used as a fixed bed catalyst.<br>
Alternatively, a titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite is mixed with a binder such as silica, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, bentonite, alumina, silica alumina or the like, and water to give a slurry, and then the slurry is spray-dried to provide a spherical micro bead, which is used as a fluidized bed catalyst. For producing the titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite containing an ion and/or compound of one or more elements selected from group I to XVII elements, a titan and/or cobaltsilicate zeolite which has been molded into a desired<br><br>
shape as described above can be allowed to contain the ion and/or compound by the above-described ion exchange method, impregnation method, dipping method and the like. In any of the above-described methods, the obtained catalyst can be<br>
calcined at 350 to BOO'C for several hours under the atmosphere of air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like to give strength to the molded article and to remove volatile components contained in a binder and the like, although, since the catalyst is heated in a reaction vessel during the gas-phase contact reaction, the calcinations of catalyst is not necessarily required.<br>
The production of pyridine bases of the present invention can be conducted in a fixed bed reactor, fluidized bed reactor or moving bed reactor.<br>
An example of methods of the present invention using a fixed bed reactor will be described below.<br>
The catalyst according to the present invention is filled in a reaction tube. A mixed gas of an aliphatic aldehyde and/or aliphatic ketone and ammonia is introduced in this reaction tube, and subjected to a gas-phase reaction. The mixed gas of an aliphatic aldehyde and/or aliphatic ketone and ammonia can also be fed together with water, an inert gas such as nitrogen, and/or methanol.<br>
The combination of an aliphatic aldehyde and/or aliphatic ketone and the suitable use ratio of them to ammonia varies depending on the intended pyridine bases . For example,<br>
for producing pyridine and i3 -Pico line as the main products, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are used as the combination of<br><br>
an aliphatic aldehyde and/or aliphatic ketone, and the molar ratio of acetaldehyde : formaldehyde : ammonia is preferably 1: 0.3-3: 0.5-5. In this case, when methanol is used in addition, the amount of methanol is preferably 0.5 mol or less per 1 mol of acetaldehyde. Formaldehyde can be used in<br>
the form of a formal in. For producing QJ-cipolin and 7-picoline as the main products, acetaldehyde is used as the combination of an aliphatic aldehyde and/or aliphatic ketone, and the molar ratio of acetaldehyde : ammonia is preferably 1: 0.8  - 3. When acetaldehyde and ammonia are reacted according to the method of the present invention, the<br>
selectivity of a-nicotine is improved.<br>
A mixed gas of an aliphatic aldehyde, aliphatic ketone and ammonia and, if desired, water, an inert gas such as nitrogen and/or methanol is passed through the catalyst at<br>
a space velocity (SV) of 100 to 10000 hr"  preferably 300<br>
to 3000 hr" . The reaction temperature is from 300 to  <br>
preferably from 350 to SOO'C . The pressure of the reaction can be from sub-atmospheric pressure to several atoms,<br>
although, the reaction pressure from atmospheric pressure to<br>
2 atoms is usually preferable.<br>
After the reaction is conducted as described above,<br>
pyridine bases contained in the reaction gas flowing out of<br>
the reaction tube may be condensed. Alternatively, it is<br>
dissolved in a suitable solvent by allowing the solvent  :<br>
contact with the reaction gas containing pyridine bases. The<br>
resulted condensate or solution can be distilled to recover<br>
pyridines.<br><br>
When the catalyst deteriorates during a long period of the reaction, it can be regenerated according to a conventional catalyst regeneration method. That is, air is passed through the catalyst layer at a high temperature not exceeding the heat-resistant temperature of the catalyst,<br>
preferably at temperatures from 350 to 800t”, to burn carbon deposited on the catalyst.  If necessary, the air may be diluted with water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like.<br>
