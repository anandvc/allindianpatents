The present invention relates to the Railway safety system to avoid<br>
accidents when the trains move in the same track. The arrangement performed by the use of electrically conductive metal wires placed in track to indicate an alarm to prevent major accidents. Despite improvements in occupational safety over the last decade, around 5 500 people lose their lives each year through work-related accidents in the European Union. More than 75 000 are so severely disabled that they can no longer work. Moreover, major surveys have found that people experience more physical problems at work than before, dispelling the often-fashionable belief that new technology has eradicated difficulties such as manual lifting of heavy objects.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART:<br>
It is a basic human right to return home safely from work. This evidence, together with scores of other statistics and studies, firmly underlines the need for even more rigorous accident prevention regimes. It is a basic human right to return home safely from work; nobody should be killed or harmed in occupational accidents. Until we reach this position, there will still be work to be done in the field of accident prevention.<br>
Part of the problem is that people tend to underestimate long-established risks, such as falls, and overestimate the new, for example workplace violence. Both need to be recognized and controlled.<br>
Major socio-economic developments are also changing the scale and pattern of accidents and risks. Transportation, for instance, is expanding tremendously, conveying much larger volumes of people and goods. In addition, all systems are getting bigger and more complicated. Technological advances might have reduced the probability of accidents in these environments, but if one does occur, the potential scale of a catastrophe is markedly higher.<br>
High costs of accidents<br>
At an individual level, the personal costs of an accident, emotional and financial, can be high. As well as the pain and mental distress, it can cause a major life<br>
 <br>
change. Injury insurance systems aim to protect the injured and their dependants but compensation varies significantly from country to country. From a corporate perspective, accidents disrupt production, thus increasing costs and sometimes undermining the organization's reputation. Demands on public services, such as health care, also increase.<br>
The net effect of railroad accidents is a significant national economic loss. Depending on the country, costs vary from 1-3% of gross national income.<br>
These costs ultimately fall on all citizens, both taxpayers and consumers. The question is: Are we really willing to continue to pay this high price? This is essentially a question of political will, as the economics speak for themselves: more effective accident prevention would not only reduce costs but also boost productivity.<br>
Accident prevention and scientific research<br>
The science of accident prevention started during World War I, focusing both on human safety and the control of various harmful 'energies' in the workplace. In the late sixties, the emphasis was on the systematic interaction of people, machines and the work environment. This so-called 'systems approach' greatly advanced the understanding of effective prevention. Major accidents have shown that it is not enough to analyze a single person or machine in isolation from the rest of the working community and other elements in the workplace. More recently, researchers have turned their attention to organizational and cultural factors.<br>
"Accidents do not happen they are caused" is a well-known safety slogan. Even if a person or a machine has characteristics that make them more vulnerable to accidents, a variety of factors determine the probability of an accident. Accidents do not necessarily happen where expected. For example, people can walk safely on slippery surfaces, but slip on a small spot of oil on the floor. A false sense of security can prompt people to ignore risks. For example, a recent study showed that trains very often clash over on straight tracks even in good weather conditions and in broad daylight. Adverse weather conditions call<br>
 <br>
for better concentration and, consequently, do not produce as many accidents as one could expect.<br>
The  human  element  is  important  since  people  cannot  cope  with  some conditions, especially the unexpected. Accidents by definition are unexpected and most people find it hard to manage unexpected situations On the wrong track<br>
In a recent train accident, the driver did not slow down early enough while approaching a station. He was an experienced driver, who had driven passenger trains to this station countless times before. Passenger trains usually went to track number one, but this time his was deviated to track three. Unfortunately in this relatively unfamiliar and unexpected territory, he did not notice the signals and failed to slow down early enough, killing many people, including himself. The case of the train driver underlines how routines strongly influence the way people acquire information. We usually have too much information for a given situation and ignore those elements that do not normally affect the situation, based on previous experience. To avoid the risks of these presumptions, so clearly illustrated by the example of the train accident, we need to allow more time for decisions in situations that go against experience. A good safety culture is a work environment where all members of the organization share a high safety ethic. Another important factor is that people behave differently in different settings. One of the contributing factors is an organisation's culture, more specifically its safety culture. The members of an organisation are governed by a relatively similar set of values. This may be because organisations tend to recruit people who think in a similar way. It may also be a relatively conscious development. A good safety culture is a work environment where all members of the organisation share a high safety ethic. Either fatalism or 'production-first' thinking leads to a negligent attitude towards hazards in a bad safety culture. Top management commitment is essential to promote a safety culture.<br>
 <br>
New approaches to accident prevention<br>
Although significant progress has been made in accident prevention, our thinking needs to evolve to meet the demands of new work practices and settings. Three interesting new ideas are emerging which practitioners could use:<br>
Zero-accident vision: Eliminating all accidents is not the direct goal here; instead the aim is to encourage people to think that all accidents are preventable. Too often people tolerate hazards and accidents because they believe these are either non-preventable or that a certain number are inevitable. Higher safety goals in organisations are a step towards greater adoption of the zero-accident vision. Promoting this vision is an important weapon in the battle against all-too-common fatalism.<br>
Integrating safety measures across time segments and communities: Safety efforts in society are usually organised separately according to life's time segments, such as work, leisure, home and travel, with different government departments often covering different elements. Yet a safe person at work does not become unsafe in traffic. A more integrated approach to safety management would be more efficient and make better use of pooled information. The need for this is reinforced by the blurring of the traditional boundaries of where work is conducted, as more people 'telecommute' and work from home. The Safe Community Program, promoted by World Health Organisation is an interesting new approach to this issue. The programme, which has produced positive results, is designed to improve safety across all of a community's activities, from travel and leisure to work.<br>
Globalisation as a platform for accident prevention: Generally, people tend to expect higher safety and environmental standards from global corporations than from local enterprises. In fact, many have already achieved lower accident figures, conscious of the need to preserve their global brand reputations. In this context, multinationals could be a valuable channel for exporting good practices to operations in other countries, or for setting :ommon safety standards. They could also demand that their suppliers follow<br>
 <br>
equally rigorous standards. The rise of the Internet and Extranet facilities makes it easier than ever before to rapidly disseminate and update these standards globally.<br>
The FR2586391 patent defines the invention relating to a system for detecting obstacles in front of a train, triggering an alarm signal and stopping the train before it reaches the location of the obstacle. The system comprises a movable probe in the form of a small vehicle radio-guided from the driver's cab. It precedes the train at a constant long distance. It picks up information by means of: a camera, which sends the image to the driver by radio; a wave-type or ultrasonic obstacle detector; a collision detector by direct mechanical action. Also in KR20040088972, which describes an audio frequency track circuit receiving apparatus and a control method thereof are provided to simplify the configuration of the apparatus by detecting the existence of train and damages of rail through the use of a digital signal processing method. JP2005041284 describes an issue an alarm optimally about an approaching train by introducing such a structure that the GPS information is reflected on the track on an electronic map in which<br>
block sections are further subdivided.   DE4214580 by Deutsche Aerospace<br>
submits the approaching train is detected by acoustic sensors, where output signals are amplified and fed to an alarm system. The noise generated by an approaching train is detected by electro-acoustic transducers, mounted on the rails, whose outputs are linked via lines to an amplifier inputs.<br>
The said inventions describes the train tracking system by electro acoustical medium, in which the controller at the remote location should make necessary safety decisions to prevent accident, but in case of negligence or failure to note the alarm may lead to great disaster. Hence it is necessary for the system for a watching aid to be available at the remote end. In case of GPS system, the accuracy of the system may be lacking as it covers a wide range of locations. More over the communication system to be free of interruptions like weather conditions, fog, smog etc which will deprive the communication error.<br>
 <br>
The method of digital signal processing may also need a remote sensing aid to inform the driver of the vehicle about the incident. Also the signal processing being dependent on the system performance of the detecting media, but in case of the failure of the system will create accident.<br>
The present invention of train detection system for any obstacle or another train by electrical alarming system overcomes the above said drawbacks. The system keeps inform the primary personnel involved in the moving train system instead of informing a third remote personnel, which may necessarily initiate the driver or personnel handling the vehicle to react quickly to prevent the disaster.<br>
The accident preventing system essentially consists of an electrically conducting wire across the entire length of the track, an emf transmitter from the moving media, emf sensor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The Present invention of train safety system to detect/alarm the presence of another train in the same track comprising an electrically conducting metal wire across the entire length of the track system, an emf (voltage) transmitter and an emf (voltage) receiver placed in the control room of the train, a dynamo battery supplying 12V -110V DC supply to the metallic wire. In one of the embodiment, the train safety system to detect/alarm the presence of another train in the same track comprising an electrically conducting metal wire of fixed length of the track system, an emf (voltage) transmitter and an emf (voltage) receiver placed in the control room of the train, a dynamo battery supplying 12V - 110V DC supply to the metallic wire.<br>
