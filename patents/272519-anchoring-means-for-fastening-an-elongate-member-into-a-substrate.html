				<td>TITLE     ANCHORING SYSTEM FOR POSTS<br>
FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a re-usable support structure for a pole, post, maat or other elongate member; the basis of which is a reversibly lockable ground anchor to be inserted ia the ground or other substrate.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A wide variety of activities depend on the temporary placement of poles in the ground or in a flat floor, road or other substrate, lo serve a purpose for a defined period and then to be removed until needed again Applications include road signs and traffic control measures, advertising or information signs, fences for animal control or crowd control, posts for use when playing sports, tent poles, Christmas tree supports, poles/posts for carrying utility wires, and the like. The invention is more particularly applicable to those activities that require repeated placement, removal, and replacement of poles in or near the same place and where in the absence of the pole the area should be frce of obstruction.<br>
Past solutions to this need include: providing posts with heavy laterally spread-out bases that sit upon the ground, forcing posts into the ground so that they are held by fiiction against the ground around the lowest part of the post, embedding^ posts into concrete, ice, or some other material which can set around the base of the post, and/or making use of mechanical gripping devices such as keys, wedges, or collets.<br>
Despite the existence of prior art using collet/wedge devices for magnifying a gripping action, there are disadvantages such as the use of a separate tigtening collar to be placed around the pole, and operating along a helical screw thread (Partec) and the need in many cases for a part of the anchoring system which remains projecting from the ground even when the pole is mat installed.<br>
The inventors were surprised to leam that some expensive, stainless-steel pole assemblies such as flagpoles are sold yet no corresponding system for repeated removal and replacement is offered, apart from sawing off that part of the pole extending from Hat ground and leaving the remainder embedded in the coocFtfe base-<br>
The problem to be solved could be sumnarised as being to devise a single but effective pole-retaining apparatus capable of allowing the pole to be removed and replaced from time to time, and<br>
1<br><br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A survey of prior art reveals tliat many socksis ic bold poles, such as basketbell goal support poles or sign holders, bavebeea described, and many ot those include some form of taper look or collet. Few if any provide a so-ond support and/or teach particular insertion or removal tools so that rem.ovai is (a) limited to those authorised to do so, and (b) can be carried out reliably and without damage when required. US 5571229 to Fitzsimmons et al (dated 1996), (also US 5752349) teach an embedded shell, a coliet, and use of tapers. In rhis case, the shell around which the concrete or earth is to be moulded is siroplied is two halves which are locked together before insertion under the groupd surface. The resulting shell plus cap has a rectangular jwofile in vertical section, except for an inwardly taperei lower end and at iavardly tapsred appar opening, compriising a nylon, internally threaded cap that closes down ovei' a saies of short tabs, forcing them into the post just bslow where it emerges from the cap. This is in marked contrast tc the single-piece shell witb. apposed fulI-lH3gth collets and locking means ofthe present invention, as described below. The post must have a round cross-section. If 'the post moves upward, pnhaps becaiise of vibrations inducted by vigorous play or by wind) after being locked in place, the lower restricted area that makes conlaci between the post and the shell soon comes out of contact. The only tool used to clamp or release the post is hammer and wedge mcsms to tighten or loosen the nylon cap so that it screws up or down.<br>
Riker (US 7003919) teaches a straight-pipe shell to go in the groimd, usually into concrete, and a tapered collet surrounding a sbcrt portion of the post within the upper end of the shelL A^in, there is only a short length of the tapered outer surface of the collet in contact with an adjacent straight cylindrical section, even though the resilience of the prefwied plasties will encourage a little defonnation.<br>
Sofy (US5497972) teaches a support for a Christmas tree in whit* a one-piece moulded skirt with tapered petals serves as a surround of collets to hold a pole within a base. The skirt co-operates with, when insetted within, a uniformly tiered hole presented to an upper aspect of a base to provide a tapered clamping surround to ft cylindrical pole. Screws hold the skirt onto the base and when undone, allow tla pole to be removed.<br>

poles, or at least to provide the public with a usefiil choice-<br><br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
This invention relates to a system for reversibly anchoring a post (or pole, pipe, shaft, beam, mast, etc) in a substrate (2) such as the ground or a wall. The illustrations and the key to the part identification includes many details. In principle the invention employs two main components - the housing, pernnanenliy buried at a designated spot, and one, two, or more wedges of a type known as collets because they are shaped to wrap around a shaft together with anti-rotation means, locking means, and removal means.<br>
Post A: can be round (Figs 1- 8, 10-13) or polygonal in section, such as hexagonal, square (Fig 9). It may be a hollow conduit or pipe carrying fluids or protecting conductors such as copper wiring or fibre optic materials. Preferably the post A is made of a slightly defoimable material - as per Fig 1, wheire the key D that has been hammered into place has deformed the post A at a point of contact. This assists in prevenling movement of the post and helps to rctam the ki^. Deformable materials include most metals and some plastics but care must be taken that a selected plastic does not crack and fail on account of the defbrming pressure. Note that the post itself is not part of the anchoring invention, although the invention is  unlikely to be assonbled properly without including a post within.<br>
Housing B: This is a shell (hatched thick line B in the elevation section of Pig 1) that is preferably made of a strong and durable, non-corrodable material; in metal but also preferably made in plastics. The housing B will usually be embedded in concrete for use, so that an almost incompressible surrounding is provided around the exterior of the housing when in me. Steel reinforcing rings (3) may be embedded in the concrete to provide tensile strength. Fins or other protrusions may be used on the exterior sur&amp;ce of the housing in ord« to inq)rove attachment and to prevrait undesired rotation of the housing, such as caused by a wind blowing on an uusymmetrical sign. The inside of the housing is provided with tiered portions Tl and T2 corresponding closely with those on the outside of the collets C described below, and hence should be reasonably precisely shaped. If made in cast metal, the tapered area could usefully be finished with a cuttii^ or grinding operation One advantage of a taper is that there is some useful tolerance as to width. The inside surfce of the housing may be provided with two or more vertical ribs Y, which act to guide and hold the collets C against rotation within the housing. At the top end of the housing an outwardly projecting collar L is provided. The inside surface of fhe collar L is preferably provided with horizontal ribs 2, which in use mnintain a gap between fhe housing and the heads of the colt^ C, into which a removal tool can be introduced as descaibed below. At the foot or bottom end of the housing, a preferably knockout I     type of wiring aperture M may be provided, by which pipes or wiring can be introduced into the base<br>
7<br><br>
of the honsiag below the collet C. The dimensions of the housii^ are typically 30 cm deep by 12-15 cm in diameter, depending on application- The interior of the housing may also include key guides (see later).<br>
Collet C: is a shed wedge not unlike collets used in engineering to hold tools with a locking process effected by forcing the tapered collet into a tapered hole. The basic collet comprises perhaps a third or a half-circle around the post A, as seen in plan view, shaped so that the inward surface J generally conforms to the exterior of the post A, preferably with horizontal ribs G at upper and lower parts of the in-syard surfece J, to resihently deform against and/or press into the post A to grip it securely at an upper and a lower part of tiie collet. The outward surfeceH conforms to inner wall of the housing B, with attention given to the angles of die iqjper and lower tapra'ed areas Tl and T2. Specific collets may be provided for different sizes and sh^es of post and for a lesser variety of housings. A square peg can be fitted into a round hole with this system usii^ appropriately shaped collets, as stown in Fig Sd and 13d. The ttead K of a collet C coc^irises an outwardly projectiDg Qange, shaped and dimensioned to fit within the collar L of the housing B. "Hie iipper surfecc Kl of the head K is preferably sHghtly sloped downward towards the outer edge, and provides a surface which can be hammered to drive the collet C into place in use.<br>
The apposable tapered zones (Tl and T2) on the housii^ B and the collet C serve to wedge flic pole and the collet into place when downward pressure is Exiled to the collet. Use of an vjtptsr and a . lower taper both having a significant tapered area tends to make a more stable mount since the item held cannot rock to and fio against any high point or obstruction in the mid-het^ part of the anchor. Of course the inter-tapcr Iwigth has to be well controlled so that both tapeiis co-operate to hold the pole in place. TOth a continuous taper a similar pressure would be applied ri^ through the supported area, making tfw locking system of the invention susc^fibie to vibration and flexing by ■ rocking about the middle.<br>
Suitable materials for collets include metal which may be cast or milled, but more preferably arc a tou^ plastics material, including for exacqjle polyprDpyleoe and hig^-density polj'ethylcne, whidi may be made by injection runnlHitig, The slight fledbility of this material provides an advantage in combinatiou with tiae use of two tapped zones as described above. "Wheal removing the collet, the top tapered zone Tl can be puUcd free with leverage ^iplied to the tt^ of the collet, while the ottier zone T2 remains wedged. The intermediate area is sti^died out The pulling force then transfisrs to the second zone T2, to release it also. If the collet wra^ formed firan an inflexible material, or if the taper extended continuously along the entire leaigtb of the collet, a much greater pulling force would<br><br>
be required to free the whole wedged section of the collet at once.<br>
Each plastic material has its own shrinkage characteristics. Preferably collets are made in a single moulding operation but the known effects of plastics-dependent shrink^e such that which occurs after release from the die may necessitate subsequent finishing operations - although the cost of those is mitigated by the use of cheaper plastics. Cutting, grinding with NC machines and brief searing contact with very hot shapes are possible techniques for post-finishing- Preferably all parts of the finished item are made at the same thickness, to help in the cooling characteristics, as is known in the relevant arts.<br>
The collet C may be modified to accommodate locking devices, as described below, widi slots W or R as shown in Fig 3b and 3c,<br>
Key D: As shown particularly in Pig 4, Qie key C has a head Dl (adapted to allow the key to be hammered into place and thai levered out of place after use), and a blade D2 (adapted to bear t^hlly against the post A in order to retain it), which tapers towards the lower end so that the k^ is also wedge-shaped. It may be made of mild steel, perhaps stan:$)ed out or otherwise cut. The key is wedged b^ween the post A and the housmg B, passing down a groove W cut in a collet as seen in Fig 3a. The key should have a concave v-cut inner edge N for pressing against the post, so that it has two parallel sharp edges which can cut into and deform the pipe and provide a more secure holding action on the curve of a round post, as is shown particularly in Fig 4.<br>
The post should be prevented from rotating or from being rocked from side to side and then working its way out of the mount. Fig. 4b shows placement of the key D in a slot W in a collet C, to engage with both the post A inside and the housing B outside. A metal plate E is preferably provided in the housing B, against which the key D can bear. This may conqjrise a flat plate or may conprise a formed metal plate as shown in Fig 4, which is typically 50 x 75 mm and made of 1.2 mm thick galvamsed steel, and has beoi folded so that it is curved and includes two lidges £2 tiiat define the sides of a key-corr^iatible slot El Ihat the key D may shde down. The plate E is preferably mounted on the outer surface of the hoiising B, b^hiiid a sbt cut fljrou^ the housii^ B down which the key D is hammered, BO that the plate E bears against the concrete (2) suirDundii^ the housing. The concrete may preferably be iciiifbrced (such as by steel ring 3 in Fig 1) because this type of usage will inqwse tensile forces. By this means a firm bearing surface is provided outside the ke^ D as it is hammered down into the slot W, sudi that the inner edge N is pressed into and deforms or cuts into the material of the post A, to look it against rotational movement relative to the collet C or housing B.<br><br>
material, typically cast concrete. Fig 4c shows a view of a housing from above, with L iodicatiiig the expanded uppermost portion (seen also in elevation view in Fig 4d). Fig. 4e is a perspective view of a bent metal key which for exarr^le is about 50 mm wide and 50 mm deep, with a bent-over lip at one end that Ues inside the border of L as shown in Fig 4c. Housings are provided with a thin slot that retams a membrane of plastic unless an installer has burst the membrane by the act of inserting key E3, which is done before the concrete is poured around the housing so that the key E3 is suirounded on both sides by concrete. This anti-rotation key works by pressing Srmly, along its centre aKis, agaioet the outside of the vertical part of the housing (at Tl, with reference to Fig 1). The vertical edges of key E3 tend to cut mto the concrete if a turning action is forced onto the housmg L and so on to the key E3.<br>
Lock Fin P: A fiirtber means may be provided for prevraiting rotation and/or withdrawl of the post A from the anchoring means, as shown in Figs 6 and 7. A lock pin P is provided, extending transversely from or throu^ a mounting PI in the housing B into the intranal cavity. As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 3c, fl:e collet C is modified to provide a loi^tudioal slot R extending upwardly fixsm the bottom, wtdch can fit over the look pin P, so that it passes thiough the collet C into contect with the post A The post A is preferably also modified with an aperture P2 at flie ^)propriate height for the pin P to pass into. With the second collet C not yet in place, the post A can be tilted to allow it to slide past the lock pin P. Then when the pin P is located next to the aperture P2 the post A can be tipped upri^ to engage the pin in the aperture, and then the second collet (not shown) pressed in on the other side to hold the whole assembly in place. By this means ttie post A is prevented from rotating or sliding longitudinally relative to the housing B.<br>
Collet removal: Two configurations of lever for use in collet removal are shown in Fig 7 and Fig 8. It will be appreciated that this configuration is unctnnmon in ordinary tools. For exati^&gt;le a screwdriver would have no usefiil purchase under the head of the collet. The lever is a fonn of security in that persona without one would find it very difBcult to remove a post. This lever has a shaft of convenient length (30-50 cm) so that a user has a suitable amount of leverage, and a shaped head extended sideways fitnn one end. As shown in Fig 8, the head of the tool conqmsos a generally crescent-shaped head U and a fiilcrum X. !fa use the tips Ul of the head U are inserted under the head K of the collet, and levered with the Mcrum X bearing against the collar L of the housir^ B and/or on the sorrouDdJBg concrete substrate 2. Ridges Z on flifi imier surfece of the collar L msure tiiat a g^ rranains under the flange K for the purpose of inserting &amp;e head of the tool. The head U may incorporate a recess U3 to fit around the key D, so that the collet C can be removed<br><br>
Preferably, the tool V is formed and arranged so that the iulcnim X will bear against the substrate 2 in which the housing B is mounted, rather than the housing B itself. Often an air g^ may be cau^ above the poured concrete and under the collar L of the bousing B, and without the support of the substrate material the collar L may be too weak to bear the pressure of the fulcrtun X. Accordingly a separate bearing plate Y may be provided, to Ue between the fulcrum X and the collar L, and/or the head U may be pivotally mounted (U2 in Fig 7) relative to the fiilcrum X, and arranged to fit under the flange K in the collar L while the fulcrum rests on the appa surfece of the substrate (2) outside the housing B.<br>
It will be appreciated that the shape of the tool will be modified to suit the dimensions and shapr of the collets C used in a particular application H for example, if the system is applied in a square form for mounting square-sectioii posts (as descaibed below) then the collet removing tool V will have a straight or V-sh^cd head U, rather Qian the crescent-sh^ed head U described above.<br>
Other removal procednreg; It will be ^ipreciated that the same or a similar tool V2 may be used to extract the Icey D. It will also be appreciated that other means may be used to extract the collets &amp;om the housing, such as for exan^le a screw passing vertically down through a threaded aperture in the head K of the collet, and bearing against a plate on the collar L, which can raise the collet when turned, as shown in Fig 12- Fig 12 shows use of machine screws as hold-downs and as removing devices for a ooiiet-based post anchor. This is an altraiiative way of providing for insertion or removal including a mechaoical advantage. The post is A; the collet housing is B, and two collets are shown as C on each side of the post. L indicates the outer edge of the surfece eTqiansion of the housing. Bolt 1201 has a drivable head which may be engaged with a sodort spanner, or some "security head" may be used to prevent unauthorised removal. The bolt shaft includes a subsequently attadied fixed washer 1203 that can turn against washer 1202 that forms part of the collet. The shaft of the bolt includes a conventional thread 1205, which passes throuj^ c^ve nut 1204. The thread is otherwise fiee to turn in space 1206. When the bolt head is turned, the bolt is efther pulled down into the housing by oigagemest with the captive niit, or if rotated in the opposite direction, turns agatoat the collet washer 1202 and causes the bolt to rise out of ibe housing, so that the collet is forcibly withdrawn &amp;om the housing and the post is thereby freed from the anchor B. 1207 is a perspective view of a collet of this type, including a bolt 1201. The stretching effect previously described is stiU ai:^Uc^le.<br>
Caps and covers; An injection moulded cqi (F2 in Fig 2) is available as an optional accessory for<br><br>
use when the post is not in place. The surfecc may be flat rather than semiciroular, as shown in Fig 5a, The closely fitting cap may be placed over the hole to keep rubbish out and to avoid injury to people or animals. Resilient parts or a form of engageable catch (screw or bayonet fitting - not shown), or even a temporary glue (such as "hot glue" resin) may be used to retain the cap- We prefer to screw the cap in place using screw-type festencrs into holes in the housing. For removal of the closely fitting cap we advise (a) removing the fixing screws then (b) screwing larger screws into the corresponding holes in the cap, then (c) using those saews as purchase to pull on the cap with pUers or the like. The cap is also usefol to prevent accidental damage to the en^ty sleeve.<br>
Dlfferine sectjonal profiles; Fi^ 13 shows how this invention exploits a useful result of the use of collets, namdy that they can be shaped so as to pacl: a space and serve as an adapter between usually a cylindrical cavity (in cross-section, thou^ with more than one taper), and a pole having a non-circular cross-section In all cases the outer profile of the collets is as previously described and illustrated in for example Fig 3a..3d as tapers Tl (aniqipertaperof about 2.5 degrees slope) and T2; a lower taper of the same slope, s^arated by a parallel-wall sectioD mariced "H". Fig 13a shows how a hexagonal section pole can be accommodated. 1300 is the wall of the shell to be placed against soil or concrete or the like, when in use. 1301 is the outline of a hexagonal pole; commonly siqiplied made of rolled sheet metal with an overall taper for street lighting ^iplications, for exaniple. The hatched outline 1302 is an example of one balf-drcle collrt and the hatched outline 1303 is an exan^iie of a diffCTent coll^ outline. These two types could be used at the same time, or used orily as one (either) type at a time.<br>
Fig 13b also shows how a hexagonal section pole can be accommodated. 1300 is the wall of the shell placed against soil or concrete or the like. 1301 is the outline of a hexagonal pole; commonly si^phed in rolled sheet metal or the like with an overall t^er for stre^ lighting ^)plications, for example. The batched outline 1304 is an exan^jle of one 120 degree ooUet and the hatcied outlines 1304bl and 1304b2 are cxan^iles of yet another, 60 degree collet outline. These two types could be used at the same time, or used only as one (either) type at a time. Fig 13c shows a ten-sided pole outline as 1306.1307 is one of four 36-degree collets shown in outlme, and 1308 is an alternative; a 72-degree collet extending around two fecets on the outside of die pole. Fig I3d shows how a square pole may be fitted ti^y into a round aperture 1300 by means of at least two varieties of collet section, 1310andl311. Aconversearpangemeot isshowninFig Be, whereasquare-section outer pq)e 1312 is provided with collets 1313 or 1314 (two stylK are shown) that clan?) around a drcular-scction pole 1315. FmaJly, Fig 13e shows that collets are quite adaptable. A Jim-symmetniical "U"-sh8ped post is held in place with one irregular collet (1317) and two of outline<br><br>
1318 (not unlike 1310 or 1311). All these fU-iistrative cross-sections are rqiresentative and arc in no *ay liimtii^ of tiie possible variations that tnay be used.<br>
VARIATIONS<br>
Square fence posts<br>
Fig 9 iilustratK how the parts of the invention may be ad^rtcd for square-shaped posts that are commonly fevoured for use in fences where style is inqwrtant. Fig. 9a is a plan view and Fig. 9b is a sectioned Sront view, showing a sqiiared bousing B around a square post A. Two square collets C (see 9c for a pcrepective view) hold the post in place. Two collets are used on the same side of the post so that they are accessible from one side of the fence, whereas oflier positions would lie behind the fence material and may be difficult to access. Q is a screw hole used to secure a cover. Note that this system ensures that the post walls are orientated in line with the laigth of the fbice. In the coUct shown here, a lever slot K2 is provided in the head K of the collet, which can be access^ with an appropriately shaped tool in the collar L of the housing B.<br>
Frangible posts<br>
There are some qipUcations such as croffd control, where posts may be erected but if pressure becomes too great (such as during emergency enqjtying of a stadium) it is desirable that the posts give way in a safe mannCT. Posts can be provided for use with the above anchoring system that sn^ cleanly at ground level when over-stressed so that (for example) if a crowd in panic has trang)Ied down the posts, individuals are not injured on protruding stunq}s thereafter. Later, the broken-off base can be sxtiactei and the entire post can be replaced chetqily without having to pour new concrete, for example. Roadside signs should also break into a safe configuration if hit by a vehicle.<br>
Electrical routing<br>
Fig 1 illustrates how the parts of the invmtion may be adapted in order to carry electrical wiring into ttie interior of a hollow post for lighting, tdqjhooes, traffic Ughts, loudspeakers and the like. A cable (see also Fig 2) has been buried in the ground and feeds its wires through an ^&gt;erture M at the base of the post The aperture M may be pre-fonned in the housing B, or ahemarivdy may be provided as a frangible membrane with a guide rim, which can be easily perforated for the insertion of wires or connection of pq)es, but whi^ serves as a waterproof seal if not perforated.<br><br>
Support of pipes carrying water etc<br>
It will be appreciated that this invention provides apparatus and a method for ranovably fixing in place a pipe or other elongate member passing through or into a wall using anchoring means as described above, applied hoTizontall^ iBStcad of vraticaUy.<br>
Fig 10 illustrates how the parts of the invention may be adapted for canying a fluid such as a water pipe throng a wall. A large pipe is shown as A2. As it passes through a hole in the wall the pipe is surrounded by a housing B (either slipped over the pipe from a free raid or provided as a pair of shells) and the pipe is clanged in place by means of collets C. The upper part of Fig 10 shows a single-ended collet assembly and the lower part shows a double assembly around a smaller pipe such as a gas pipe or water pipe A3. We have found that this version offers, among other advantages, the benefit that sound travelhng along the pipe is deadened at tiie colics, at least partly owing to a property (also well-known in lead) of hysteresis and mass, hence absorption of sound. It may be set up with a level of tightness which can allow the pipe to slide widiin the collet should there be earth movement or an earthquake.<br>
Anchors for hand rails into wails.<br>
A process as above can be used to anchor an end of a hand rail into a wall made of such as brick or concrete.<br>
Watertight end-to-end joints between pipes.<br>
Fig 11 shows how the collefhousing assembly may be used in an only sU^Iy modified form as a junction hetweeai pipes. There is no requirement that the assembly be mounted in the ground or in a wall, for example; it may he free-standing. The lumen of the pipes is shown at A4. A modified housing B4 forms a con^lete ring around the approximately flush ends of the pipes. The housing includes an interior flange that makes an approjtimate contact with the pipe exteriors. Scaling is provided by means of the pressure apphed by the collet C bases q&gt;pUed against a prrasure-equalising ring CI that in turn presses against an O-ms C2 that is forced into a sealing contact. One such O-ring is used on each side. When Has collet assembly is put together and held in place by keys a ti^ seal is provided at the aids of the pipes without usii^ welding or flie like. The idea may be used to nmtch pipes haidng diffdtajt iameters, and may be used in re-erootible, tcnqwrary plumbing sudi as<br>
in military can^s and friirgrounds (fbr example).<br><br>
Farm fencing and yards.<br>
'Concrete floors and galvanised, iron pipework serving as fencing, bails, and races is widely used in New Zealand at least for the construction of animal yards, cowsheds, and ia other countries for bams to house animals. When the pipes are directly set into the concrete, corrosion in electrolytic cells may be set up for wet concrete is a reasonably good conductor, and the pipes oarmot be moved around. One application of the present invention is to provide non-conducting sockets for pipes which minimise corrosion, even if some pipes are of stainless steel and others are of galvanised iron, and which allow the layout of the pipework to be changed &amp;om time to time with no damage.<br>
