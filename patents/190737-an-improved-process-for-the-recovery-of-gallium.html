				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the recovery of gallium using chelating ion exchange resins. Particularly, the present invention provides a method of gallium recovery by using a chelate ion exchange resin as described and claimed in our copending patent application No.601/Del/95 based on acrylic copolymers containing divinylbenzene as comonomer repeat unit having hydroxyamic acid group as the ligand in the acrylic moiety of the copolymer unit which when brought into contact with gallium containing solution facilitates the adsorption of gallium selectively on the resin followed by elution of the adsorbed gallium.<br>
This method of invention is attractive with special reference to the extraction of gallium for which the demand is rapidly growing due to its increased use in electronic industries.This is further suitable to highly alkaline sodium aluminate liquor of the Bayer process of alumina production.<br>
The chelating ion exchange resin is known to be useful in metal recovery<br>
and is dependant upon the chelating ligand present in the resin. Among the<br>
commercially known resins, resins with ligands like amidoxime<br>
(Ref:Hydrometallurgy, 25, 1990,pp-1-18), carbamate (Ref: J.H. Hodgkin in<br>
Encyclopaedia of polymer science and engineering, vol.3, p-367) have been<br>
proved to be useful for uranium, mercury, cadmium, zinc, lead, copper and a<br>
great variety of ligands based on sulphur are known for chelation of heavy metal<br>
ions like mercury and lead. Commercially available resins having iminodiacetic<br>
acid or oxime or amidoxime group as ligand though<br>
suggested     for	gallium	recovery,	fail	in<br>
Selectivity, alkali and acid resistance, stability in repeated use. To overcome these difficulties, in a pending patent application no. 601/del/ 95, we have described and claimed a method of making a chelating ion exchange resin with hydroximic acid ligand attached to the acrylic - divinyl benzene copolymer for selective recovery of gallium.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the recovery of gallium using chelating ion exchange resin as described and claimed in our cop ending patent application no. 601/del/95.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the recovery of gallium which comprises soaking the chelating ion exchange resin such as herein described in pure 2 M NaOH solution for a period of 10-15 hours, decanting the supernatant alkali and packing the swollen resin in an ion exchange column, passing the gallium containing solution through the said column and eluting by known methods to recover gallium.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention consists of evaluation of the resin in synthetic sodium gallate solution containing either gallium alone or in presence of aluminum or/and vanadium in varying concentration of alkaline solution.<br>
The operation of the method due to the present invention involves adsorption of gallium onto the chelating ion exchange resin by bringing the gallium containing solutions as stated above in contact with the resin through a column method similar to the usual practice of ion exchange resin. Prior to the resin packing<br>
in the ion exchange column, the resin is soaked in pure 2M NaOH solution for 12-15 hours and the swollen resin after decantation of supernatant alkali is packed in the ion exchange column. The ion exchange column used in this invention has 250 mm height with an inner diameter of 10 mm. The height of swollen resin is maintained as 80 mm . when following this column method, the gallium containing solution is passed by down flow down the column at a flow rate ranging from 50-200 ml/h and at room temperature of 30+_2Â° C . The test solution contains (i) gallium whose concentration ranges from 100-500 mg/1, (ii) gallium and  1 minimum, in which gallium concentration ranees from 100-300 mg/1 and aluminium concentration 40-60 g/l,and (iii) gallium, aluminium and vanadium in which the concentration of gallium and aluminium ranges as stated in (i) and (ii) while vanadium concentration ranges from 50- 150 mg/1, all in alkaline solution where the concentration of alkali as NaOH ranges from 120-300g/l. The effluent alkaline solution is analysed for its gallium content to compute gallium adsorption on the resin.<br>
The stability of the resin in alkali/acid is evaluated by treating with alkali followed by acid after washing with water. The typical results are given in the table below . A known weight of the resin is treated with alkali under stirred condition using magnetic stirrer, washed and treated with acid of known strength under stirring condition. The resin is filtered, washed with water and dried in sunlight and weighed. The same resin is treated repeatedly.<br>

For eluting the adsorbed gallium, the chelated resin on which gallium is adsorbed is washed with water and eluted with 200 ml of 10% HCl (v/v) at a flow rate of about 30 ml/h. The adsorption of gallium in the chelating ion exchange resin is further illustrated with the examples given below which however should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
