WIRELESS SUBSCRIBER STATION FOR SHORT RANGE AD-HOC DATA COMMUNICATION<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[001]   This application claims the benefit of the provisional application, titled "IEEE 802.16 based wireless subscriber station for short range ad-hoc data communication", filed June 2, 2006, Serial Number 60/810,330.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002]   Embodiments of the invention relate generally to wireless communication systems. More particularly, the embodiments of the invention relate to wireless ad-hoc data communication.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART.<br>
[003]   The Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 standards describe air interfaces for fixed and mobile broadband wireless access systems, especially for Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). There are different standards for wireless Personal Area Network (PAN) and wireless Local Area Network (LAN) such as IEEE 802.11, known as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), and IEEE 802.15, known as Bluetooth to the public. Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi include ad-hoc network protocol so that a user terminal can connect to the other user terminal directly without an access point. The IEEE 802.16 subscriber station (SS) may communicate directly between the SSs using the mesh mode. However, the protocol is so complex that industrial standards such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Wireless Broadband (WiBro) have not adopted the mesh mode.<br>
[004]   Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi equipment generally cannot communicate if a SS is away more than a short distance (e.g., 300 feet) from the access point. The IEEE 802.16 protocol is designed to cover tens of miles. Therefore, IEEE 802.16 equipment may be substituted for the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi equipment theoretically but not vice versa.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
[0018] An embodiment of the present inventioti in «technique for short-range ad-hoc mode communication. An ad-hoc mode is configured for a first mobile station (MS) operating in an ad-hoc network imder a broadband wireless standard. An ad-hoc mode communication is acquired having a simplified communication protocol of the broadband wireless standard. A second MS is communicated with using the ad-hoc mode communication.<br>
[0019] In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures, and techniques have not been shown to avoid obscuring the understanding of this description.<br>
[0020] One embodiment of the invention may be described as a process which is usually depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re¬arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed. A process may correspond to a method, a program, a procedure, a method of manufacturing or fabrication,<br>
etc.<br>
I<br>
[0021] Embodiments of the invention include a technique to provide an ad-hoc mode communication for mobile stations in an ad-hoc network using a broadband wireless standard. The ad-hoc network includes fixed or mobile subscriber stations (SSs) which are closely located to each other. The short range ad-hoc network does not have a base station (BS).   Instead, it has a server mobile station (SMS). The SMS opens a wireless chaimel including continuous fixed time duration frames. These firames are started with long pre¬ambles followed by frame control headers (FCHs). Each of the FCHs contains a mark or identifier to represent the ad-hoc network so that the neighboring SSs may distinguish the ad-hoc network from the infirastructure network formed by a BS.<br>
[0022] The SMS in the ad-hoc network may be significantly simplified compared to the BS by performing the ad-hoc mode communication using a simplified communication protocol of the broadband wireless standard. By following a simplified communication protocol, the SMS may be designed with much less complexity than the BS, resulting in lower device costs and development time and human resources. The broadband wireless standard may be<br><br>
the IEEE 802.16. The SMS or the MSes in the ad-hoc network may also be compatible with WiMAX and/or WiBro specifications.<br>
[0023] The simplified communication protocol may include simplifications of the initial ranging and periodic ranging, the downlink broadcast management messages, the network entry procedures, and the bandwidth allocation and scheduling.<br>
[0024] Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating a system 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. The system 100 includes a base station 110, a network 115, N mobile stations 130i to 130N, and an ad-hoc network 140.<br>
[0025] The base station (BS) 110 is a radio frequency (RF) receiver and transmitter unit or system that serves as the hub of the network communication. It receives and transmits RF signals through the transmission station 120 which may include a high powered antenna.   It may have a wdred or wireless connection to the network 115. The network 115 may be any network such as the Internet, intranet, LAN, WAN, PAN, etc.<br>
[0026] The N mobile stations 130i to 130N may be any mobile devices that have wireless coimectivity such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook computers, laptop computers, hand-held computers, etc. When a mobile station 130j is registered to the BS 110, it may be connected to the network 115. The BS 110 may allocate wireless resources such as time and frequency so that the BS may transmit downlink (DL) data and the MSes may transmit uplink (UL) data without collision.<br>
[0027] The ad-hoc network 140 is a network that does not require any infrastructure to provide communication services. The ad-hoc network 140 includes N mobile stations (MS) 150i to 150N. The N mobile stations 150i to 150N may typically be located within a short distance. As soon as they come close to each other, they 4etect each other and start organizing themselves. The ad-hoc network 140 includes a serving MS (SMS) 155 that may exchange data packets with any one of the N mobile stations 150i to 150N. The SMS may also have a bridging function so that the N mobile stations 150i to 150N may communicate with one another through the SMS 155. The SMS 155 may be a MS that is set manually or automatically to act as the SMS in the ad-hoc network 140.<br>
[0028] All the MSes in the ad-hoc network 140 may operate under a broadband wireless standard. In one embodiment, the broadband wireless standard is the IEEE 802.16 standard. All the MSes in the ad-hoc network 140 may also have all the mandatory functions described in the WiMAX and/or Mobile WiMAX and/or WiBro specifications. Any one of<br><br>
the MSes in the ad-hoc network 140 may become an SMS. By employing the simplified communication protocol of the broadband wireless standard (e.g., the IEEE 802.16), the MSes, including the SMS, involving in the ad-hoc communication may have simplified design and complexity, resulting in low cost, high reliability, efficient communication, and convenience to the user or users.<br>
[0029] Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating the mobile station 150j/155 shown in Figure 1 according to one embodiment of the invention.   The J^S l^Oj/lSS includes an antenna 210, an RF transceiver 220, a physical layer (PHY) 230, a medium access control (MAC) processor 240, a processor 250, a memory 260, a mass storage device 270, and an input/output (I/O) device 280. It is noted that the mobile station 150j/155 may include more or less than the above components. The mobile station 150j/155 may represent any of the MSes, including the SMS, in the ad-hoc network 140.<br>
[0030] The antenna 210 is an antenna designed for wireless mobile device. It may operate in a frequency range suitable for the wireless conununication in the ad-hoc network 140. It may have non-direct line of sight (NDLOS). In one embodiment, the frequency range may be from 2.5 GHz to 3.5 GHz and compatible with IEEE 802.16 and 802.20 standards. The RF transceiver 220 is a unit that includes receiver and transmitter functionalities such as filters, modulator, demodulator, etc. to convert digital data to analog base-band signal and then to RF signal and to convert RF signal to analog base-band signal and then to digital data.<br>
[0031] The PHY 230 performs physical layer signal processing functions. In one embodiment, the signal processing functions are biased on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology used in the IEEE 802.16 standard. These functions may include channel coding, inverse Fasl Fourier Transform (IFFT) for the transmitter path, and synchronization, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), equalization, and channel decoding for the receiver path. It may be a specialized processor, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a programmable field gate array (FPGA), a digital signal processor (DSP), or any other device that may perform the required physical layer signal processing functions.<br>
[0032] The MAC processor 240 performs the MAC functions such as network entry, DL synchronization, initial ranging, registration, IP connectivity, protocol data unit (PDU) creation, scheduling, etc. It may be a programmable DSP, an ASIC, or any other suitable processor.<br><br>
[0033] The processor 250 may be a central processing unit of any type of architecture, such as processors using hyper threading, security, network, digital media technologies, single-core processors, multi-core processors, embedded processors, mobile processors, micro¬controllers, digital signal processors, superscalar computers, vector processors, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) computers, complex instruction set computers (CISC), reduced instruction set computers (RISC), very long instruction word (VLIW), or hybrid architecture.<br>
[0034] The memory 260 stores system code and data. The memory 260 is typically implemented with dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM)^ oriany other types of memories including those that do not need to be refreshed. The memory 260 may include multiple channels of memory devices such as DRAMs. The memory 260 may include an ad-hoc communication module 265. The ad-hoc communication module 265 includes program instructions and data to perform ad-hoc communication for the ad-hoc network 140 (Figure 1). It is noted that the functions of the ad-hoc communication module 265 may be performed by the MAC processor 240 in whole or in part. An ad-hoc communication processing unit therefore may include any one of the ad-hoc communication module 265, the MAC processor 240, a combination of the ad-hoc communication module 265 and the MAC processor 240. a dedicated processor, a specially programmed processor, or any processing unit that may perform the ad-hoc commvinication operations described below. In addition, the ad-hoc communication processing unit may be implemented in whole or in part by hardware, software/firmware, or any combination of hardware, software, and firmware.<br>
[0035] The interconnect or bus 255 provides interface to peripheral devices. The<br>
interconnect 255 may be point-to-point or connected to multiple devices. For clarity, not all<br>
interconnects are shown. It is contemplated that the interconnect 255 may include any<br>
interconnect or bus such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), PCI Express,<br>
Universal Serial Bus (USB), Small Computer System Interface (SCSI), serial SCSI, and<br>
Direct Media Interface (DMI), etc.;	;.   .     -<br>
[0036] The mass storage device 270 may store archive information such as code, programs, files, data, and applications. The mass storage device may include flash semiconductor memories, compact disk (CD) read-only memory (ROM), digital versatile disc (DVD), any other magnetic or optic storage devices. The mass storage device provides a mechanism to read machine-accessible media.<br><br>
[0037] The I/O device 280 may include any 1/0 dc\ ice to perform I/O functions.   The I/O device may interface with a display 282 and an input entry device 284 (e.g., keyboard, mouse) for user interface.<br>
[0038] Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating an ad-hoc communication module 265 according to one embodiment of the invention.   The ad-hoc communication module 265 includes a configuration module 310, an acquisition module 340, and a communication module 350. It is noted that the ad-hoc communication module 265 may mclude more or less than the above components. Furthermore, any of the above components may be implemented by a hardware circuit, a software/firmware module, or any combination of hardware, software, and firmware.<br>
[0039] The configuration module 310 configures an ad-hoc mod^ for a first mobile station (MS) operating in an ad-hoc network under a broadband wireless standard. In one embodiment the broadband wireless standard is the IEEE 802.16. The configuration module 310 configures ad-hoc mode parameters 320. These parameters include an MS name 322, an operational mode 324, encryptions keys 326, and frequency channels 328. The operational mode 324 includes an MS mode 332, and SMS mode 334, and an automatic mode 336. The MS name 322 may be used as the name of the MS unit and may be displayed by the SMS in the ad-hoc network 140.<br>
[0040] The acquisition module 340 acquires an ad-hoc mode communication having a simplified communication protocol of the broadband wireless standard.   The acquisition module 340 searches for an SMS during the initial phase of the ad-hoc communication. The acquisition module 340 may use a timer 345 to set a search period. The timer 345 may be initialized by a pre-determined time interval. When the timer times out, it indicates that the search period is completed. The timer 345 may then be re-initialized for the next search period if desired.<br>
[0041] The communication module 350 communicates with at least another MS using the ad-hoc mode communication. The communication module 350 uses the simplified communication protocol by perform a number of operations, actions, or tasks that simplify the commxmication protocol of the wireless standard (e.g., the IEEE 802.16).<br>
[0042] Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating a process 400 to perform ad-hoc communication according to one embodiment of the invention.   The process 400 may be performed by any one of the MSes in the ad-hoc network 140 (Figure 1).<br><br>
[0043] Upon START, the process 400 configures an ad-hoc mode for a first mobile station (MS) operating in an ad-hoc network under a broadband wireless standard (Block 410). The first MS may be the MS that executes the process 400. Then, the process 400 acquires an ad-hoc mode communication having a simplified communication protocol of the broadband wireless standard (Block 420). Next, the process 400 communicates with a second MS using the ad-hoc mode communication (Block 430). The process 400 is then terminated.<br>
[0044] Figure 5 is a flowchart illustrating the process 410 shown in Figure 4 to configure an ad-hoc mode according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0045] Upon START, the process 410 configures ad-hoc mode parameters (Block 510). The ad-hoc mode parameters include parameters that may be used for ad-hoc communication. These parameters may include a MS name, an operational mode, encryption keys, and frequency channels. The MS name is a user friendly name assigned to tlie MS unit and may be used by the SMS in (he aU-hoc network 140 to display to the user. The operational mode may be a manual mode or automatic mode. The manual mode allows the user to set the mode of the MS to be an MS or an SMS in the ad-hoc network. The automatic mode automatically searches for an SMS first. When there is no SMS found during a search period, the device sets itself to be the SMS. When there is at least an SMS found during the search period, the device allows the user to select the SMS. The process 510 is then terminated.<br>
[0046] Figure 6 is a flowchart illustrating the process 420 shown in Figure 4 to acquire an ad-hoc mode communication according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0047] Upon START, the process 420 determines the operational mode (Block 610). The operational mode may be any one of a manual mode and an automatic mode. The manual mode is the mode in which the operation mode is set manually either by the user or by default. The operational mode may be a MS mode, a SMS mode, or an automatic mode.<br>
[0048] If the operational mode is MS, the process 420 searches for one or more SMSes during a search period (Block 625). The search period may be set by default. Next, the process 420 determines if there are any SMS found (Block 630). If so, the process 420 displays all the found SMSes on the display to allow the user to select (Block 635). Otherwise, the process 420 goes to Block 640. At Block 640, the process 420 determines the user selection. If the user selects next search, the process 420 returns to Block 625 to<br><br>
continue searching for another SMS. If the user selects terminate, the process 420 is terminated. If the user selects an SMS, the process 420 goes to Block 660.<br>
[0049] If the operational mode is SMS, the process 420 searches for an available or empty frequency channel (Block 670). Then, the process 420 starts ad-hoc mode communication as an ad-hoc SMS (Block 675) and is then terminated.<br>
[0050] If the operational mode is automatic, the process 420 searches for an SMS during a search period (Block 645). The search period may be set by a timer.  Next, the process 420 determines if an SMS is found during the search period (Block 650). If not, the process 420 goes to Block 670. Otherwise, the process 420 displays all the found SMSes for user selection (Block 655). Next, the process 420 allows the user to select an SMS (Block 660). Then, the process 420 starts an ad-hoc mode communication with the selected SMS (Block 665). The process 420 is then terminated.<br>
[0051] Figure 7 is a dia.gram illustrating-a simplified frame structure 700 according to one embodiment of the invention.   The simplified frame structure 700 includes a DL PHY PDU 710, a transmit/receive transition gap (TTG) 715, an initial ranging interval IRNG 720, P UL PHY PDU messages 730i to 730?, and an receiver/transmit transition gap (RTG) 740.<br>
[0052] The DL PHY PDU message 710 includes a pre-amble 752, a frame control header (FCH) 754, and a DL burst 756. The FCH 754 may be used to describe the DL burst 756 and the number of MSes in the ad-hoc network 140. This information is used to calculate the time offset as described later. The FCH 754 may also be used to store the modulation type of each UL burst in place of the UCD message so that the UCD message may be omitted.   The FCH 754 may also be used to store the modulation type of the DL burst so that the DCD message may be omitted. The DL burst 756 includes a broadcast message 762, N MAC PDU 1 to MAC PDU N 764,,tQ 764N,;and a padding 766. The DL burst 756 packs all the DL MAC PDU messages. These message fields may be simplified for the ad-hoc mode communication as described later.<br>
[0053] The UL PHY PDU 730j includes a pre-amble 772, an UL burst 774, and an SS separation gap (SSSG) 776. The ranging process may be omitted by allocating the UL burst interval for the UL PHY PDU 73 Oj long enough to eliminate the propagation delay effect which may cause collision between the UL PHY PDU messages, each sent by a different MS.' The SMS PHY may synchronize the UL PHY PDUs even though they do not arrive at the exact boundary of each scheduled UL burst start time by pre-pending the pre-amble 772<br><br>
on the UL PHY PDU 73Oj. The pre-amble 772 is sufficiently long for the SMS to detect timing, frequency, power offset, etc., which is also needed for ranging process omission.<br>
[0054] Figure 8A is a flowchart illustrating the process 430 shown in Figure 4 to communicate with another MS according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0055] Upon START, the process 430 may perform at least one of several simplification tasks in blocks 820, 830, 840, or 850. These simplification tasks provide a simplified communication protocol of the broadband wireless standard (e.g., IEEE 802.16) employed by the MSes in the ad-hoc network 140. The process 430 may simplify initial ranging (Block 820), broadcast management messages (Block 830), network entry (840), or bandwidth allocation and scheduling (Block 850). The process 430 is then terminated.<br>
[0056] Figure 8B is a flowchart illustrating the process 820 shown in Figure 8A to simplify ranging according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0057] Upon START, the process 820 may perform at least one of the operations or actions in blocks 822 and 824. The process 820 may allocate the UL burst interval sufficiently long to prevent collision between the UL PHY PDUs, each of which is transmitted firom a different MS (Block 822). The process 820 may pre-pend a long preamble on an UL PHY PDU message to facilitate detecting and decoding the UL PHY PDU by an SMS (Block 824). The process 820 is then terminated.<br>
[0058] Figure 8C is a flowchart illustrating the process 830 shown in Figure 8A to simplify broadcast management messages according to one embodiment of the invention.   The IEEE 802.16 standards introduce DL Medium Access Protocol (DL MAP), UL MAP, Downlink Channel Descriptor (DCD) and Uplink Channel Descriptor (UCD) messages. The DL MAP includes encoding information of DL bursts and the UL MAP includes encoding information of UL bursts. The DCD and UCD include downlink and uplink, respectively, channel information. Transmitting those bi;oadcast management^messages is a BS's own functionality which may not be needed in the ad-hoc mode communication and may be simplified or omitted.<br>
[0059] Upon START, the process 830 may perform at least one of the operations or actions in blocks 832, 834, 836, and 838. The process 830 may omit DL MAP messages by packing all DL MAC PDU messages into a single DL burst (Block 832). This is shown in Figure 7. The single DL burst 756 (Figure 7) includes the broadcast message 762 and uni-cast messages for the MSes in the ad-hoc network 140 (Figure 1).<br><br>
[0060] The process 830 may omit UL MAP messages by calculating time offset of an UL burst using number of MSes in the ad-hoc network and a basic CID (Block 834).  The UL MAP specifies offsets and lengths of each UL burst as well as UL start time which tells the boundary of downlink and uplink. The UL start tinu^ information is not needed if it does not change frame by frame and is known to every station in the ad-hoc network 140. The SMS and all MSes running on the ad-hoc mode may have fixed default value of UL start time, TTG 715, IRNG 720, and RTG 740 as shown in Figure 7. A MS may calculate the time offset of the UL burst which is allocated for itself using the following parameters: (1) number of MSes in the ad-hoc network 140, which is set in the FCH 754 (Figure 7). The FCH 754 has space to describe up to 4 following DL bursts, one of which is used to describe DL burstl 756 and the other fields may be used for describing the number of MSes. The MS knows the time offset of each UL burst by dividing the whole UL burst portion into the number of MSes; (2) the basic CID which is included in the simplified IRNG-RSP (Initial Ranging Response) message sent by SMS. If the Basic CID of the MS is 1, it may use the first UL burst for transmission.<br>
[0061] The process 830 may omit an UCD message by including modulation information in a FCH (Block 836). A UCD message includes UL burst profile which is used for notifying the modulation type of each UL burst and some channel information. The SMS may include the modulation types of each or whole UL burst in the FCH 754 (Figure 7) so that the SMS does not need to broadcast UCD messages.<br>
[0062] The process 830 may simplify a DCD message by excluding DL burst profile, frame duration code, transmit/receive transition gap (TTG), and receive/transmit transition gap (RTG) (Block 838). A DCD message includes DL burst profile which is used for notifying the modulation type of each DL burst and some channel information. The SMS may exclude DL burst profile because the modulation type of DL burst is described in the FCH 754 (Figure 7). The SMS may exclude the frame duration code, the TTG 715, the RTG 740 because these values may be set as default values in the ad-hoc mode. The SMS may also exclude all other fields to simplify DCD message but may include the 'SMS name' field which is not defined in the IEEE 802.16 standards. The SMS name may be used for the MS to display the list of scanned SMS for user's convenience. The process 820 is then terminated.<br><br>
[0063] Figure 8D is a flowchart illustrating the process 840 shown in Figure 8A to simplify network entry according to one embodiment of the invention.   During the initialization process, there are many stages according to the IEEE 802.16 standards. The BS makes a decision and builds a response message and transmits it for each request. These tasks are not needed in ad ad-hoc mode communication and therefore may be simplified.<br>
[0064] Upon START, the process 840 may perform at least one of the operations or actions in blocks 841, 842, 843, 844, 845, 846, and 847. These operations simplify the network entry procedures for ad-hoc mode communication.<br>
[0065] The process 840 may use fixed default values of frame duration and cyclic prefix (CP) index (Block 841). By using fixed default values, an MS may significantly reduce the number of trial combinations during the search or scanning phase.<br>
[0066] The process 840 may exclude power, timing, and frequency offset information in an initial ranging response message (Block 842). As described earlier, these data may be excluded in the IRNG message although the basic CID may be included to identify a MS in the ad-hoc network 140 (Figure 1).<br>
[0067] The process 840 may include a basic connection identification (CID) to identify a MS in the ad-hoc network (Block 843). The IRNG may include a MS name which may be set by the user. The MS name is not defined in the IEEE 802.16 standard. It may be used for the SMS to display a list of communicating MSes for user's convenience.<br>
[0068] The process 840 may skip basic capability negotiation by using fixed default values of automatic repeat request (ARQ) mode, fragmentation mode, and packing mode (Block 844).<br>
[0069] The process 840 may skip subscriber station (SS) authorization and registration (Block 845). The SMS and all MSes in the ad-hoc network 140 (Figure 1) may not use private key management (PKM) protocol. The payload encryption key and encryption algorithm may be set by the user manually or the payload may not be encrypted unless the user turns on the payload encryption mode.<br>
[0070] The process 840 may skip an optional process as defined in the broadband wireless standard (Block 846). The optional process includes at least one of establishing Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, establishing time of day, and transferring operational parameters.<br><br>
The SMS and the MSes in the ad-hoc network may use a manually user set IP address or an automatically generated static IP address in which the least significant byte of the IP address may be derived from the Basic CID.<br>
[0071] The process 840 may establish a single connection numbered by basic CID (Block 847). Under the IEEE 802.16 standards, a MS has multiple logical connections to provide Quality of Service (QoS) which is described by many parameters and is used for the BS to schedule the network traffic. These may not be needed in an ad-hoc network. A MS operating on the ad-hoc mode may use only one connection. This single connection may be numbered by Basic CID. This connection may transmit and receive all types of data streams as well as management messages.<br>
[0072] The process 840 may perform one or more simplifications described above. The process 840 is then terminated.<br>
[0073] Figure 8E is a flowchart illustrating the process 850 shown in Figure 8A to simplify bandwidth allocation and scheduling according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
[0074] Upon START, the process 850 sets the scheduling type of connection to imsolicited grant service (UGS) by default (Block 852). The IEEE 802.16 standards define a few types of scheduling method such as unsolicited grant service (UGS), real-time polling service (rtPS), non-Real-time polling service (nrtPS), best efforts (BE), etc. The BS refers to the type of each connection to allocate UL subframe. In addition, the BS receives bandwidth request messages from the MSes, extracts requested amount, and decides how much bandwidth to be allocated to the connection by referring to the transmission history and the QoS parameters of the requested connection. These operations may not be needed in the ad-hoc mode communication. In the Ad-hoc network, the SMS and MSes may use only one basic connection as described above. The scheduling type of the connection may be set to UGS by default. The process 850 is then terminated.<br>
