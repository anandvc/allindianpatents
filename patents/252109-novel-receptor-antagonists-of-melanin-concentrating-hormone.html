				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention is in the field of medicine, particularly in the treatment of obesity<br>
and diseases caused by or exacerbated by obesity. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to antagonists of melanin concentrating hormone useful in the prevention and treatment of<br>
obesity and related diseases.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The affluence of the 1990's along with the exponential increase in food production<br>
particularly in Western and Asian economies has resulted in feeding patterns that lead to obesity.<br>
Obesity is defined as being excessively overweight. Excessive weight is generally characterized<br>
by excessive body fat, because unused energy is stored in the adipose tissues as fat.<br>
Obesity has associated with it, economic and social costs. Obese people, an increasing<br>
proportion of developed and developing societies, are regarded as having out of control feeding<br>
habits often associated with low self-esteem. Moreover, obese persons are more likely to have<br>
medical problems associated with or exacerbated by the excess body weight. Examples of<br>
medical conditions caused, exacerbated or triggered by excessive weight include bone fractures,<br>
pains in the knee joints, arthritis, increased risk of hypertension, atherosclerosis, stroke, diabetes,<br>
etc.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 amino acid neuropeptide produced in the<br>
lateral hypothalamic area and zona incerta, although MCH-expressing neurons project to<br>
numerous regions of the brain. MCH is processed from a larger pre-prohormone<br>
that also includes a second peptide, NEI, and possibly a third, NGE (Nahon, Crit Rev in<br>
Neurobiology, 8:221-262, 1994). MCH mediates its effects through at least two G protein-<br>
coupled receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2 (Saito et al. Nature 400: 265-269, 1999; Hill et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 276: 20125-20129, 2001). Both receptors are expressed in regions of the brain<br>
consistent with MCH neuronal projection and known MCH physiologic function (Hervieu et al.,<br>
Eur J Neuroscience 12: 1194-1216, 2000; Hill et al., J Biol Chem 276: 20125-20129, 2001; Sailer<br>
et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci 98: 7564-7569, 2001).<br>
Extensive evidence exists to support the orexigenic activity of MCH. MCH mRNA is<br>
elevated in rodent models of obesity and in the fasted state (Qu et al., Nature 380: 243-247,<br>
1996). Intra-cerebroventricularly administered MCH increases feeding and blocks the anorexic<br>
effect of a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Ludwig et al., Am J Physiol 274: E627-E633,<br>
1998). MCH knock-out mice (MCH-/- mice) are lean, hypophagic and hypometabolic (Shimada et<br>
al., Nature 396: 670-674,1998), while MCH over-expressing transgenic mice are obese and<br>
insulin resistant (Ludwig et al., J Clin Invest 107: 379-386,2001). MCHR1-/- mice have recently<br>
been reported to be lean and hypermetabolic, indicating that the Rl isoform mediates at least<br>
some of the metabolic effects of MCH (Marsh et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci 99: 3240-3245,2002).<br>
In addition to its effects on feeding, MCH has been implicated in regulation of the<br>
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through modulation of CRF and ACTH release (Bluet-Pajot<br>
et al., J Neuroendocrinol 7: 297-303,1995). MCH may also play a role in the modulation of<br>
reproductive function (Murray et al., J Neuroendocrinol 12: 217-223, 2000) and memory<br>
(Monzon et al., Peptides 20: 1517-1519,1999).<br>
The current preferred treatment for obesity as well as Type II non-insulin dependent<br>
diabetes is diet and exercise with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin<br>
sensitivity for diabetics. Patient compliance, however, is usually poor. The problem is<br>
compounded by the fact that there are currently only two medications approved for the treatment<br>
of obesity (sibutramine, or Meridia™ and orlistat, or Xenical™.<br>
PCT application number WO 01/87834, filed May 15, 2001, also discloses compounds<br>
reportedly useful as antagonists of the MCH receptor. In particular the WO 01/87834 application<br>
claims a compound of formula C.<br><br>
wherein;<br>
R represents hydrogen, halogen, or an optionally substituted cyclic group; X represents a bond or<br>
a spacer in which the main chain has one to ten atoms; Y represents a spacer in which the main<br>
chain has one to six atoms; ring A represents a benzene ring which may have other substituents;<br>
ring B represents a five- to nine-membered nitrogenous non-aromatic heterocycle which may<br>
have other substituents; and R1 and R2 are the same or different and each represents hydrogen, an<br>
optionally substituted hydrocarbon group, or an optionally substituted heterocyclic group, or R1<br>
and R2 may form an optionally substituted nitrogenous heterocycle in cooperation with the<br>
adjacent nitrogen atom and R2 may form an optionally substituted nitrogenous heterocycle in<br>
cooperation with the adjacent nitrogen atom and Y.<br>
PCT application WO 01/82925 Al relates to aromatic compounds of the formula<br><br>
Wherein Ar1 is an optionally substituted cyclic group, X is a spacer having a main chain of 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, Y is a bond or spacer having a main chain of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, Ar is a<br>
monocyclic aromatic ring which may be condensed with a 4 to 8 membered non-aromatic ring,<br>
and may have further substituents; R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group<br>
which may have substituents; R1 and R2 together with the adjacent nitrogen atom may form a<br>
nitrogen containing ring which may have substituents; R2 may form a spiro ring together with Ar;<br>
or R2 together with the adjacent nitrogen atom may form a nitrogen containing hetero ring which<br>
may have substituents; or a salt thereof, which compounds are antagonists of a melanin<br>
concentrating hormone suggested as being useful for preventing or treating obesity.<br>
PCT application WO 01/21577A2 (Takeda) relates to aromatic compounds of the<br>
formula<br><br>
or a salt thereof, which is useful as an agent for preventing or treating obesity; wherein the<br>
variables are as disclosed therein.<br>
PCT application WO 03/035624 discloses a compound of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein A represents an optionally substituted cyclic group; X represents a bond or a spacer<br>
having a C1-6 main chain, R1 and R2 are the same or different and each represents hydrogen or<br>
an optionally substituted hydrocarbon group (excluding CO); R3 represents hydrogen or an<br>
optionally substituted hydrocarbon group; and ring A and ring B each may have other<br>
substituent(s), and when ring B has another substituent, then this substituent may be bonded to<br>
Rl to form a ring; a salt of the compound; or a prodrug of any of these having antagonistic<br>
activity against melanin concentrating hormone and hence useful as an obesity<br>
preventive/remedy, etc.<br>
PCT application W095/32967 describes compounds of the formula<br><br>
wherein A is CONR, in which R is hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl; Q is an optionally substituted 5 to 7<br>
membered heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen, or<br>
sulfur; R4 is hydrogen, halogen, etc; R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen, halogen, etc.; R4<br>
and R5 are independently hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl; R6 is halogen, hydroxy, etc.; R7 and R8 are<br>
independently hydrogen; C1-6 alkyls, etc.; m is 0 to 4; n is 0.1 or 2; or its salt' which has 5HT1D<br>
antagonist activity and can be expected to ameliorate anorexia.<br>
PCT application 03/015769A1 relates to aminoalkyl-substituted aromatic compounds of<br>
the formula<br><br>
useful as anorexic drugs wherein the variables of the above formula are as described therein.<br>
Current treatments targeted at obesity have side effects. Examples of such treatments<br>
include effective over-the-counter appetite suppressants. These agents have not been proven<br>
effective for all patients and for sustainable periods of time. Similarly, the approved treatments,<br>
sibutramine (Meridia™) and orlistat (Xenical™) have been associated with side effects which<br>
may compromise compliance and may preclude long term use for sustained weight loss for<br>
certain patient populations.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for new and/or improved therapeutically effective agents useful<br>
as antagonists of melanocortin releasing hormone to better control the dietary habits, minimize<br>
the preponderance of obesity and treat, prevent and/or ameliorate the effects of obesity including<br>
for example diabetes.<br>

Preparing Compounds of the Invention<br>
The anti-obesity benzthiazoles of formula (I, X=S) are prepared by methods well known<br>
to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis from starting compounds alSo known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The explanation below is deemed helpful to those skilled in the art who desire<br>
to prepare the compounds of the present invention. Preferred methods include, but are not<br>
limited to those methods described below.<br>
SCHEME 1 sets forth a general method used in the present invention to prepare<br>
substituted benzthiazoles of formula (I, X=S).<br><br>
Commercially available 2-amino-6-nitrobenzthiazole (V) is readily converted to 2-chloro-<br>
or 2-bromo-6-nitrobenzthiazole (VI) by the well known Sandmeyer reaction. Diazotization may<br>
be accomplished with tert-butyl nitrite in acetonitrile followed by treatment with copper (H)<br>
chloride or copper (II) bromide. The reaction may be conducted from room temperature up to the<br>
boiling point of the acetonitrile. Preferably, the reaction mixture is heated to about 65°C for from<br>
1 to 16 hours as needed to ensure completion of the reaction. While the reaction and its<br>
derivations are well known to those skilled in the art, additional references and guidance may be<br>
obtained from "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry", Wiley-Interscience Publishers, 2001, p.<br>
935.<br>
Treatment of 2-halo-6-nitrobenzthiazole (VI) with a commercially available or easily<br>
preprared amine of formula H-N(R3)-L2-N(R4)(R5) affords substituted benzthiazoles (VH).<br>
Optimal conditions include performing the reaction in an inert Solvent, for example<br>
tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures ranging from room temperature up to the boiling point of the<br>
Solvent. More preferred is to conduct the substitution reaction at room temperature for a period<br>
of time ranging from 1 to 16 hours as needed to ensure completion of the reaction.<br>
Formation of 6-aminobenzthiazoles (VIII) is accomplished via reduction of the<br>
corresponding nitro compounds (VET). A vast array of methods are well known to those skilled in<br>
the art or the reader may consult the text of R.C. Larock in "Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations", VCH Publishers, 1989, p. 411. Preferred is reduction via hydrogenation (H2)<br>
with palladium (Pd, 5% on carbon) catalyst in ethanol at atmospheric pressure or elevated<br>
pressure as needed to ensure complete reduction. In a few instances, it was preferable to add<br>
K2CO3 and perfrom the reaction in tetrahydrofuran and water at a temperature up to 40 C.<br>
The amine (VIII) is reacted with an appropriately substituted amide forming agent of the.<br>
formula Ar1-L,-C(=O)-X2 to produce the target anti-obesity agents of formula I (X=S) by<br>
nitrogen-acylation conditions. X2 of the amide forming agent comprises -OH (carboxylic acid)<br>
or halide (acyl halide), preferably chlorine, or a suitable group to provide a mixed anhydride. The<br>
nitrogen-acylation of primary amines to produce secondary amides is one of the oldest known<br>
reactions, and nitrogen acylation conditions are abundantly known to those skilled in the art and<br>
may be found in R.C. Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers,<br>
1989, p. 972, 979, and 981.<br>
An alternative preparation of target compounds (I, X=S) can proceed via the<br>
intermediacy of protected amine (IX). It is preferred drat the N-protecting group be t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl (BOC) or benzyloxycarbony (CBZ). It is more preferred that the protecting<br>
group be t-butoxycarbonyl. One skilled in the art will understand the preferred methods of<br>
introducing a t-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group and may additionally<br>
consult T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Wiley-<br>
Interscience Publishers, 1991 for guidance.<br>
Amide formation to afford (X) proceeds as described above. The protected intermediate<br>
(X) is nitrogen-deprotected to the corresponding amine by means known to those skilled in the art<br>
for removal of amine protecting group. Suitable means for removal of the amine protecting group<br>
depends on the nature of the protecting group. Those skilled in the art, knowing the nature of a<br>
specific protecting group, know which reagent is preferable for its removal. For example, it is<br>
preferred to remove the protecting group, BOC, by disSolving the protected amine (X) in a<br>
trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane (1/1) mixture. When complete, the Solvents are removed<br>
under reduced pressure to give the corresponding amine (as the corresponding salt, i.e.<br>
trifluoroacetic acid salt) which is preferably used without further purification. However, if<br>
desired, the amine can be purified further by means well known to those skilled in the art, such as<br>
for example, recrystallization. Further, the non-salt form may be obtained, for example, by<br>
preparing the free base amine via treatment of the salt with mild basic conditions. Additional<br>
BOC deprotection conditions and deprotection conditions for other protecting groups can be<br>
found in T.W. Green and P.G.M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Wiley-<br>
Interscience Publishers, 1991, p. 309. A Sandmeyer reaction (see above) affords the 2-<br>
chlorobenzthiazole (XT) and amine substitution (see above) affords the desired targets (I, X=S).<br>
SCHEME 2 and SCHEME 3 demonstrate the flexibility of this chemistry.<br><br>
As referenced above, treatment of 2-chloro-6-nitrobenzthiazole (VI, Y=C1) with a<br>
commercially available or easily prepared amine of formula H-N(R3)-L2-N(R4)(R5) such as, for<br>
example, N,N,N'-trimethylethyldiamine (Aldrich Chemical Co.) or (3R)-(+)-3-(dimethylamino)<br>
pyrrolidine (TCI America Inc.), affords, respectively, the substituted benzthiazoles (XII) and<br>
(XIII). The respectively reduced amines (XIV) and (XV) may be acylated per the well-<br>
understood conditions of this invention with a commercially available amide forming reagent of<br>
the formula Ar'-L1-C(=O)-X2 such as, for example, trans-4-(trifluoromethyl) cinnamic acid<br>
(Aldrich Chemical Co.) or 4-(4-fluorophenyl)benzoic acid (Array Biopharma Inc.,), wherein<br>
X2=OH, to generate the target benzthiazoles such as for example, the target compounds shown<br>
including compound (XVI).<br><br>
Benzoxazole compounds (I, X=O) of the present invention may be prepared following<br>
the procedures of SCHEME 4 below or by using variations of SCHEME 4 or other methods well<br>
known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.<br><br>
SCHEME 4 sets forth a general method used to prepare substituted benzoxazoles of<br>
formula (I, X=O). Commercially available 2-amino-4-nitrophenol is cyclized to the thione<br>
(XVH) by precedent established by R. Lok, et al. (Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1996,61(10),<br>
3289-3297). Activation of the 2-position to a suitable leaving group may be accomplished via<br>
formation of the thiomethyl ether by treatment of thione (XVII) with an acceptable base<br>
(preferred is Sodium hydride) and quenching with methyl iodide.<br>
Subsequent treatment with a commercially available amine of formula H-N(R2)-L2-<br>
N(R3)(R4) affords substituted benzoxazoles (XIX). Optimal conditions include performing the<br>
reaction in an inert Solvent, for example toluene, at temperatures ranging from room temperature<br>
up to the boiling point of the Solvent. More preferred is to conduct the substitution reaction at<br>
about 70°C for about 10 - 20 hours or until the reaction is complete.<br>
Formation of 5-aminobenzoxazoles (XX) is accomplished via reduction of the<br>
corresponding nitro compounds. A vast array of methods are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art or the reader may consult the text of R.C. Larock in "Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations", VCH Publishers, 1989, p. 411. Preferred is reduction via hydrogenation (H2)<br>
with palladium (Pd, 5% on carbon) catalyst in ethanol at atmospheric pressure or elevated<br>
pressure as needed to ensure complete reduction. Alternatively the reduction may be<br>
accomplished using Pd(OH)2 in the presence of cyclohexene in refluxing ethanol, a procedure or<br>
known variations thereof that can readily be ascertained and/or performed by one of skill in the<br>
art.<br>
The amine (XX) is reacted with an appropriately substituted amide forming agent of the<br>
formula Ar1-L1-C(=O)-X2 to produce the target anti-obesity agents of formula (I, X=O) by<br>
nitrogen-acylation conditions. X2 of the amide forming agent comprises -OH (carboxylic acid)<br>
or halide (acyl halide), preferably chlorine, or a suitable group to provide a mixed anhydride. The<br>
nitrogen-acylation of primary amines to produce secondary amides is one of the oldest known<br>
reactions, and nitrogen acylarion conditions are abundantly known to those skilled in the art and<br>
can be found in R.C. Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, 1989,<br>
p. 972, 979, and 981. For example, amide coupling reagents, such as O-(7-azabenzo-triazol-l-yl)-<br>
N, N, N', N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N, N,<br>
N', N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) may by used to form amides from primary<br>
amines and carboxylic acids by one of ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively the amine (XX) is<br>
reacted with an ester of formula Ar1-L1-C(=O)-X2 wherein X2 comprises -OMe or -OEt. The<br>
acylation with the ester may be accomplished with Al(Me)3 (about 3 equivalents) in an inert<br>
Solvent, such as dichloromethane.<br>
SCHEME 5 further demonstrates the flexibility of this chemistry.<br>
As referenced above, treatment of 5-nitro-2-thiomethylbenzoxazole with a commercially<br>
available amine of formula H-N(R3)-L2-N(R4)(R5) such as, for example, (3R)-(+)-3-<br>
(dimethylamino) pyrrolidine (TCI America), affords the substituted benzthiazoles (XIX). The<br>
subsequently reduced amine (XX) may be acylated per the well-understood conditions of this<br>
invention with a commercially available amide forming reagent of the formula Ar1-L1-C(=O)-X2<br>
such as, for example, trans-4-(trifluoromethyl) cinnamic acid (Aldrich Chemical) or 4-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)benzoic acid (Array Biopharma), wherein X2=OH, to generate the target<br>
benzthiazoles such as for example, the target compounds shown.<br>
SCHEME 6 demonstrates the ability to introduce the substituent R5 as the last step in the<br>
reaction sequence. Compound XI (SCHEME 1) may be treated with a commercially available<br>
amine of formula H-N(R3)-LrN(R4)(PG), wherein R5 is a protecting group, to afford substituted<br>
benzthiazoles (XXI). Deprotection to afford (XXII) and acetylation yields the desired<br>
compounds (XXIII). Optimal conditions for the reactions set forth in SCHEME 6 are described<br>
as above for SCHEMES 1-5.<br><br>
Demonstration of Function<br>
In order to demonstrate that compounds of the present invention have the capacity to bind<br>
to and inhibit the function of MCHR1, binding and functional assays were established. All<br>
ligands, radioligands, Solvents and reagents employed in these assays are readily available from<br>
commercial Sources or can be readily prepared by those skilled in the art.<br>
The full-length cDNA for human MCHR1 was cloned from a human adult brain cDNA<br>
library (Edge Biosystems, Cat. 38356) by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
methodology employing the following primers: sense, 5'-GCCACCATGGACCT<br>
GGAAGCCTCGCTGC-3'; anti-sense, 5'-TGGTGCCCTGACTTGGAGGTGTGC-3'. The PCR<br>
reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 µl containing 5 µl of a 10x stock Solution of PCR<br>
buffer, 1 µl of 10 mM dNTP mixture (200 uM final), 2 µl of 50 mM Mg(SO4) (2 mM final), 0.5<br>
µl of 20 µM Solutions of each primer (0.2 µM final), 5 µl of template cDNA containing 0.5 ng<br>
DNA, 0.5 µl of Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Gibco Life Technologies) and 36<br>
µl of H2O. PCR amplification was performed on a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermocycler. After<br>
denaturation for 90 sec at 94°C, the amplification sequence consisting of 94 °C for25 sec, 55 °C<br>
for 25 sec and 72 °C for 2 min was repeated 30 times, followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C<br>
for 10 min. The desired PCR product (1.1 Kb) was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and<br>
the band was extracted from the gel by Geneclean (Bio101) following the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. Following extraction, the cDNA fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO plasmid<br>
(Invitrogen Corp) to confirm the identity and sequence.<br>
In order to generate cell lines stably expressing MCHR1, the insert was then subcloned<br>
into the Xba I and Not I sites of pcDNA(+)-3.1-neomycin (Invitrogen). After purification by<br>
Qiagen Maxi-prep kit (QIAGEN, Inc.), the plasmid was transfected by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied<br>
Science) into AV12 cells that had been previously transfected with the promiscuous G protein<br>
Gal5. The transfected cells were selected by G418 (800 µg/ml) for 10-14 days and single colonies<br>
were iSolated from culture plates. The G418-resistant colonies were further selected for MCHR1<br>
expression by measuring MCH-stimulated Ca2+ transients with a fluorometric imaging plate<br>
reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices).<br>
Typically, individual clones are plated out in 96-well plates at 60,000 cells per well in<br>
100 µl of growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 5% fetal bovine<br>
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mg/ml Zeocin, and 0.5<br>
mg/ml Geneticin). After 24 hrs at 37 °C, medium is removed and replaced with 50 µl of dye<br>
loading buffer (Hank's balanced salt Solution (HBSS) containing 25 mM HEPES, 0.04%<br>
Pluronate 127 and 8 µM Fluo3 Both from Molecular Probes)). After a 60 min loading period at<br>
room temperature, dye loading buffer is aspirated and replaced with 100 µl of HEPES/HBBS.<br>
Plate is placed in FLEPR and basal readings are taken for 10 sec, at which point 100 µl of buffer<br>
containing 2 µM MCH (1 µM final) is added and measurements are taken over 105 sec. To<br>
correct for variations between clones in numbers of cells per well, the MCH response is<br>
normalized to the response induced by epinephrine.<br>
Both the l25I-MCH binding and functional GTP?35S binding assays employed membranes<br>
iSolated from a clone designated as clone 43. Typically, cells from 20 confluent T225 flasks<br>
were processed by washing the monolayers in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraping the<br>
cells into same and re-suspending the cell pellet in 35 ml of 250 mM Sucrose, 50 mM HEPES,<br>
pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 24 µg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors (1 Complete® tablet, per 50 ml<br>
of buffer prepared, Roche Diagnostics). Alternatively, greater levels of cells could be generated<br>
by adapting cell growth to suspension culture in 20 L stirred vessel bioreactors. After incubation<br>
on ice for 5 min, cells were disrupted with 20-25 strokes of a Teflon/Glass homogenizer attached<br>
to an overhead motorized stirrer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in Beckman<br>
Type 70.1 Ti rotor. The pellets were re-suspended in 250 mM Sucrose, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,<br>
1.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4 and protease inhibitors by Teflon/Glass homogenization to achieve<br>
a protein concentration of ~3-5 mg/ml (Pierce BCA assay with Bovine serum albumin as<br>
standard). Aliquots were stored at -70 °C.<br>
Binding of compounds to MCHR1 was assessed in a competitive binding assay<br>
employing l25I-MCH, compound and clone 43 membranes. Briefly, assays are carried out in 96-<br>
well Costar 3632 white opaque plates in a total volume of 200 µl containing 25 mM HEPES, pH<br>
7.0,10 mM CaCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSo), 5 µg of<br>
clone 43 membranes, 200 pM 125I-MCH (NEN), 0.625 mg/ml of wheat germ agglutinin<br>
scintillation proximity assay beads (WGA-SPA beads, Amersham Inc., now GE Healthcare Inc.)<br>
and a graded dose of test compound. Non-specific binding is assessed in the presence of 0.1 µM<br>
unlabeled MCH. Bound !25I-MCH is determined by placing sealed plates in a Microbeta Trilux<br>
(Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc) and counting after a 12 hr delay.<br>
IC50 values (defined as the concentration of test compound required to reduce specific<br>
binding of 125I-MCH by 50%) are determined by fitting the concentration-response data to a 4-<br>
pararaeter model (max response, min response, Hill coefficient, IC50) using Excel® (MicroSoft<br>
Corp.). Ki values are calculated from IC50 values using the Cheng-PruSoff approximation as<br>
described by Cheng et al. ( Relationship between the inhibition constant (Ki) and the<br>
concentration of inhibitor which causes 50% inhibition (IC50) of an enzymatic reaction, Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol., 22:3099-3108 (1973)). The Kd for l25I-MCH is determined independently from a<br>
saturation binding iSotherm. Exemplified compounds showed a Ki of 
assay conditions. Specifically, a sample of observed Ki values is provided in Table 1 (below) for<br>
demonstration purposes only.<br><br>
Functional antagonism of MCH activity is assessed by measuring the ability of test<br>
compound to inhibit MCH-stimulated binding of GTP?35S to clone 43 membranes. Briefly,<br>
assays are carried out in Costar 3632 white opaque plates in a total volume of 200 µl containing<br>
50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 µg/ml saponin, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100<br>
mM NaCI, 3 µM GDP, 0.3 nM GTP?35S, 10 nM MCH (approximately equal to EC90), 20 µg of<br>
clone 43 membranes, 5.0 mg/ml of wheat germ agglutinin scintillation proximity assay beads<br>
(WGA-SPA beads, Amersham Inc., now GE Healthcare Inc.) and a graded dose of test<br>
compound. The plates are sealed and left for 16-18 hrs at 4°C. After a 1 hr delay to allow plates<br>
to equilibrate to ambient temperature, bound GTP?35S is determined by counting in a Microbeta<br>
Trilux (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc).<br>
IC50 values (defined as the concentration of test compound required to reduce MCH-<br>
stimulated GTP?35S binding by 50%) are determined by fitting the concentration-response data to<br>
a 4-parameter model (max response, min response, Hill coefficient, IC50) using Excel (MicroSoft).<br>
After verifying competitive antagonism by Schild analysis, Kb values are calculated from the IC50<br>
values for each antagonist and the EC50 for MCH (determined independently) using a<br>
modification of the Cheng-PruSoff approximation as described by Leff and Dougal (Trends<br>
Pharmacol. Sci. (1993) 14: 110-112).<br>
Exemplified compounds showed IC50 values of 
disclosed herein.<br>
In order to demonstrate in vivo efficacy, compounds of the invention were administered<br>
by oral gavage to diet-induced obese male Long-Evans rats (Harlan, IN) weighing 500-550g.<br>
Vehicle consisted of 1% CMC and 0.25% PS-80 in water.<br>
Animals were individually housed in a temperature regulated room (24°C) with a reverse<br>
12 hour light/dark cycle (dark 10:00/22:00). Water and food (Teklad 95217, Harlan, WI) were<br>
available ad libitum. Compounds were dosed orally once a day before onset of dark for 3 days.<br>
Daily food intake and body weight change were measured for the 3 day period. Exemplified<br>
compounds tested at 10 mg/kg showed reduction of 3 day cumulative body weight gain when<br>
compared with vehicle-treated controls. Specifically, a sample of observed 3 day cumulative<br>
body weight reduction, relative to control, is provided in Table 2 (below) for demonstration<br>
purposes only.<br><br>
Utility<br>
As antagonists of the MCHRlbinding, a compound of the present invention is useful in<br>
treating conditions in human and non-human animals (especially companion animals) in which<br>
the MCHRl receptor has been demonstrated to play a role. The diseases, diSorders or conditions<br>
for which compounds of the present invention are useful in treating or preventing include, but are<br>
not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, obesity, hyperiipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arteries,<br>
gastrointestinal diSorders including peptic ulcer, eSophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis, (including<br>
that induced by H. pylori), intestinal ulcerations (including inflammatory bowel disease,<br>
ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and proctitis) and gastrointestinal ulcerations, neurogenic<br>
inflammation of airways, including cough, asthma, depression, prostate diseases such as benign<br>
prostate hyperplasia, irritable bowel syndrome and other diSorders needing decreased gut<br>
motility, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathic bladder dysfunction, elevated intraocular pressure and<br>
glaucoma and non-specific diarrhea dumping syndrome. By inhibiting MCH activity the<br>
compounds of the present invention provide anorexic effects. That is, the compounds of the<br>
invention are useful as appetite suppressants and/or weightloss agents. The compounds of the<br>
invention may alSo be used for treating and/or preventing anxiety and other stress related<br>
diSorders, such as post-traumatic stress diSorder, substance abuse including alcohol abuse, and<br>
nonpharmacological addictions such as gambling, sex, internet, etc. The compounds of the<br>
invention may alSo be used in combination with other approved therapeutic agents for the<br>
treatment, prevention and/or amelioration of obesity and related diseases. In this format, the<br>
compounds of the present invention enhance the positive effects of such approved combination<br>
treatments while minimizing the side effects due to the potential requirement of lower doses of<br>
such combination compounds. Such combination therapies may be delivered individually or in a<br>
combined formulation. Examples of compounds useful in combination with a compound of<br>
formula I include weight loss agents (Meridia™, Xenical™), cholesterol lowering agents (such<br>
as for example lovastatin, simvastatin pravastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin), glucose level<br>
control or modulating agents, nerve growth factor agonists (such as for example, axokine),<br>
cannabinoid CB-1 antagonist compounds (such as for example rimonanbant) and the like.<br>
In treating non-human, non-companion animals, the compounds of the present invention<br>
are useful for reducing weight gain and/or improving the feed utilization efficiency and/or<br>
increasing lean body mass.<br>
Formulation<br>
A compound of formula I is preferably formulated in a unit dosage form prior to<br>
administration. Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutical carrier preferably in unit<br>
dosage packages, sachets, vials or other presentation/delivery devises known to one of skill in the<br>
art.<br>
The present pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by known procedures using well-known<br>
and readily available ingredients added to or admixed with the novel compound of formula I.. In<br>
making the formulations of the present invention, the active ingredient (formula I compound) will<br>
usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be<br>
in the form of a liquid, tablet, capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves<br>
as a diluent, it may be a Solid, semiSolid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or<br>
medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills,<br>
powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, Solutions, syrups, aeroSol (as<br>
a Solid or in a liquid medium), Soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable<br>
Solutions and sterile packaged powders. Examples of suitable carriers and procedures for<br>
preparing regular and common formulations are known to one of skill in the art and/or available<br>
to one of skill in the art upon minimal scientific inquiry.<br>
Dose<br>
The specific dose administered is determined by the particular circumstances surrounding<br>
each situation. These circumstances include, the route of administration, the prior medical<br>
history of the recipient, the pathological condition or symptom being treated, the severity of the<br>
condition/symptom being treated, and the age and sex of the recipient. However, it will be<br>
understood that the therapeutic dosage administered will be determined by the physician in the<br>
light of the relevant circumstances, or by the veterinarian for non-human recipients.<br>
Generally, an effective minimum daily dose of a compound of formula I is about 20 to<br>
200 mg. Typically, an effective maximum dose is about 200 to 2000 mg. The exact dose may<br>
be determined, in accordance with the standard practice in the medical arts of "dose titrating" the<br>
recipient; that is, initially administering a low dose of the compound, and gradually increasing the<br>
does until the desired therapeutic effect is observed.<br>
Route of Administration<br>
The compounds may be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal,<br>
transdermal, subcutaneous, topical, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. A preferred<br>
route of administration is oral.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
A compound of formula I may be used in combination with other drugs or therapies that<br>
are used in the treatment/prevention/suppression or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for<br>
which compounds of formula I are useful. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route<br>
and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound<br>
of formula I. When a compound of formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other<br>
drugs, a pharmaceutical unit dosage form containing such other drugs in addition to the<br>
compound of formula I is preferred. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention include those that alSo contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition<br>
