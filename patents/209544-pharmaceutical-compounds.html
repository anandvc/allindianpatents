The present invention relates to new drugs for systemic use and non-systemic use, and the composition thereof, to be used in oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfuntions cases.<br>
By oxidative stress it is meant the generation of free radicals or radicalic compounds, which causes injury both of the cell and that of the surrounding tissue (Pathophysiology: the biological basis for disease in adults and children, Mstance &amp; Huether 1998 pages 48-54).<br>
By endothelial dysfunctions it is meant those relating to the vasal endothelium. The damage of the vasal endotheliuun is known as one of those important events that can cause a series of pathological processes affecting various organs and body apparatuses, as described hereinafter (Pathophysiology: The biological basis for disease in adults and children, Mstance &amp; Huether 1998 page 1025).<br>
As known, the oxidative stress and/or the endothelial dysfunctions are associated to various pathologies as reported hereinafter. The oxidative stress can also be caused by toxicity of a great variety of drugs, which significantly affects their performances.<br>
Said pathological events are of a chronic, debilitating character and are very often typical of the elderly. As already<br><br>
said, in said pathological conditions the drugs used  show a remarkably worsened performance.<br>
Examples of pathological situations caused by the oxidative stress and/or by the endothelial dysfunctions, or present in elderly, are the following:<br>
For the cardiovascular system: myocardial and vascular ischaemia in general, hypertension, stroke, arteriosclerosis, etc.<br>
For the connective tissue: rheumatoid arthritis and connected inflammatory diseases, etc.<br>
For the pulmonary system: asthma and connected inflammatory diseases, etc.<br>
For the gastrointestinal system: ulcerative and non ulcerative dyspepsias, intestinal inflammatory diseases, etc.<br>
For the central nervous system: Alzheimer disease, etc. For the urogenital system: impotence, incontinence. For the cutaneous system: eczema, neurodermatitis, acne. The infective diseases in general (ref. : Schwarz-KB, Brady "Oxidative stress during viral infection: A review" Free radical Biol. Med. 21/5, 641-649 1996).<br>
Further the ageing process can be considered as a true pathologic condition {ref. Pathophysiology: the biological basis for disease 5-n adults and children, pages 71-77).<br>
The known drugs  when administered to patients having<br><br>
pathologies associated to oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, show a lower activity and/or higher toxicity.<br>
This happens for example for drugs such as the anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular drugs, respiratory apparatus drugs, central nervous sisters drugs, bone system drugs, antibiotics, urogenital, endocrine drugs, etc.<br>
Drug research is directed to find new molecules having an improved therapeutic index (off icily/toxicity ratio) or a lower risk/benefit ratio, also for pathological conditions as those above mentioned, wherein the therapeutic index of a great number of drugs results lowered. In fact in the above mentioned conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, many drugs show a lower activity and/or higher toxicity.<br>
For instance antiinflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs and anticolitic drugs, such as 5 - aminosalicylic acid and its derivatives, show the following drawbacks. NSAIDs result toxic particularly when the organism is debilitated or affected by morbid conditions associated to oxidative stress. Said conditions are for example the following: age, pre-existing ulcer, pre-existing gastric bleeding, debilitating chronic diseases such as in particular those affecting cardiovascular, renal apparatuses, the haematic crasis, etc. {"Misoprostol reduces serious gastrointestinal complications in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial."<br><br>
F.E. Silverstein et Al., Ann. Intern. Med. 123/4, 241-9, 1995; Martindale 31a ed. 1996, pag. 73, Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 1998, pages 431 and 794).<br>
The administration of anti-inflammatory drugs to patients in the above mentioned pathological conditions can be made only at doses lower than those used in therapy in order to avoid remarkable toxicity phenomena. Thus anti-inflammatory activity results poor.<br>
Beta-blockers, us ed for the angina, hyper ends ion and cardiac arrhythmia treatment, show side effects towards the respiratory apparatus (dyspnoea, bronchoconstriction), and therefore they can cause problems in patients affected by pathologies to said organs (asthma, bronchitis). Therefore beta-blockers further worsen respiratory diseases such as asthma. Therefore in asthmatic patients doses of said drugs must be used reduced in order not to jeopardize even more the respiratory functionality. Thus the efficacy of the beta-blockers results very reduced.<br>
Antithrombotics, such as for example dipyridamole, aspirin, etc., used for the prophylaxis of thrombotic phenomena, have the same drawbacks. In patients affected by pathologies connected to oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, the therapeutic action or the tolerability of these drugs, as in the case of aspirin, is greatly reduced.<br>
Bronchodilators for example salbutamol, etc., are used in<br><br>
the asthira and bronchitis treatment and drugs active on the cholinergic system are used in pathologies such as urinary incontinence. Their administration can produce similar side effects affecting the cardiovascular apparatus, causing problems both to cardiopathic and to hypertensive patients. Cardiopathies and hypertension are pathologies associated, as above said, to the oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions. Also these drugs show the same drawbacks as those above mentioned.<br>
Expectorant and mucolytic drugs, which are used in the therapy of inflammatory states of the respiratory organs, show drawbacks in patients affected by the above described conditions. Their administration can give rise to heartburn and gastric irritability, particularly in the elderly.<br>
Bone resorption inhibitors, such as diphosphonates (for example alendronate, etc.) are drugs showing high gastrointestinal toxicity. Therefore also these drugs can show the same drawbacks as those above mentioned.<br>
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as for example sildenafil, zaprinast, used in the cardiovascular and respiratory system diseases, are charaterized by similar problems as to tolerability and/or efficacy in the mentioned pathological conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions.<br>
Ant allergic drugs, for example satirizing, montelukast,<br><br>
etc. show similar problems in the mentioned pathological conditions, particularly for that it concerns their efficacy.<br>
Anti-angiotensin drugs , f . i . ACE-inhibitors , for example enalapril, captopril, etc,, and receptor inhibitors, for example losartan, etc., are used in the cardiovascular disease treatment. Their drawback is to give side effects to the respiratory apparatus (i,e. cough, etc.) in the above mentioned pathological conditions.<br>
Antidiabetic drugs, both of the insulin-sensitizing and of hypoglycaemizing type, such as for example, sulphonylureas, tolbutamide, glypiride, glyclazide, glyburide, nicotinamide etc. , are ineffective in the prophylaxis of diabetic complications. Their administration can give side effects, such as for example gastric lesions. These phenomena become more intense in the pathological conditions above mentioned.<br>
Antibiotics, for example ampicillin, clarihtromycin, etc., and antiviral drugs, cycloid, etc., show problems as regards their tolerability, for example they cause gastro-intestinal irritability.<br>
Antitumoral drugs, for example doxorubicine, daunorubicin, cisplatinum, etc., have high toxicity, towards different organs, among which are stomach and intestine. Said toxicity is further worsened in the above mentioned pathologies of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions.<br>
Ant dementia drugs for example nicotine and Colin-<br><br>
idiomatic, are characterized by a poor toierability especially in the above mentioned pathologies.<br>
The need was felt to have available drugs showing an improved therapeutic performance, i.e. endowed both of a lower toxicity and/or higher efficacy, so that they could be administered to patients in morbid conditions of oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, without showing the drawbacks of the drugs of the prior art.<br>
It has now surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the aforementioned problems evidenced the administration of drugs; to patients affected by oxidative stress and/or endothelial dysfunctions, or to the elderly in general, are solved by a novel class of drugs as described hereinafter.<br>

The tests carried out to identify the drug corresponding to the R radical of the formulas (I) and (II) are in detail the following;<br>
Test 1 (NEM): evaluation of the gastrointestinal damage from oxidative stress induced by free radicals formed following administration of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (H.G. Nutley, F. Behead,  . Huckstering "Effects of sulphydril reagents on per oxidation in microcosms" Archive. Biochem. Biophys. 118, 29-32 1967).<br>
The animals (rats) are distributed in the following groups (no. 10 animals for group): A) Control groups: 1° group: treatment:  only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v<br><br>
of carboxymethylcellulose; dose: 5 i.v/Kg when the drug is administered by so; or a physiologic solution when parenterally administered, i.e. by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous or intramuscularly route) / 2° group: treatment: carrier as above defined + NEM, B) Groups treated with the drug: group I:  treatment: carrier H- drug, grape II: treatment: carrier + drug + NEH.<br>
The administration routes are those known for the drug, and can be the oral or subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous or intramuscular route.<br>
The NEM dose is of 25 mg/kg in physiologic solution (sub cutaneous route) and the drug is administered one hour later, in suspension in the carrier, as a single dose which corresponds to the maximum one, or the highest still tolerated by the animals of the group of rats not pretreated with NEM, i.e. the highest administrable dose to said group at which there is no manifest toxicity in the animals, defined as a toxicity that is clearly recognizable for its symptoms. The animals are sacrificed after 24 hours and then one proceeds to the evaluation of the damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.<br>
The drug meets test 1, i.e. it can be used to prepare the compounds of general formula (I) and (II), when the group of rats treated with KEM + carrier + drug shows gastrointestinal damages, or in said group the gastrointestinal damages noticed<br><br>
are greater than those shove  by the group treated with the carrier alone, or the group treated with carrier + drug, or the group treated with carrier -j- NEM, even though the drug pharmacotherapeutic efficacy, assayed by using specific tests; is not significantly reduced.<br>
Test 2 (CIP); Protection perimeter of endothelial cell against the oxidative stress induced by coniine hydroperoxide (CIP).<br>
Human endothelial cells of the umbilical vein are prepared according to an usual standard procedure. Fresh umbilical veins are filled with a 0.1% by weight collagenase solution and incubated at 37'=C for 5 minutes.<br>
Afterwards the veins are perfused with medium M 199 (GIBCO; Grand Island; NY) pH 7.4 further added of other substances, as described in the examples» The cells are collected from the perforate by centrifugation and harvested in culture flasks T-75, pretreated with human fibronectin. The cells are then harvested in the same medium, further added with 10 nag/ml of bovine hypothalamic growth factor. When the cells of the primary cell culture (i.e. that directly obtained from ex-vivo) form a single layer of confluent cells (about 8,000,000 cells/flask), the culture is stopped and the layers washed and trypsinised. The cellular suspensions are transferred into the wells of a cell culture plate having 24 wells, half of which is then auditioned with the same culture medium containing the<br><br>
drug at a 10'^M concentration, and harvested in a thermostat at 37°C at a constant moisture. Only the cells coming from said first sub-cultures are used for the experiments with cumene hydroperoxide (CIP). The cells are identified as endothelial cells by morphological examination and by their specific immunological reaction towards factor VIII; said cultures did not show any contaminations from yachts or fibroblasts.<br>
Before starting the test, the cellular culture medium is removed and the cellular layers are carefully washed with a physiologic solution at a temperature of 37 . The wells of the culture plate are then incubated for one hour with CIP at a 5 Tim concentration in the culture medium. The evaluation of cellular damage (apoptosis) is carried out by determining the per cent variation of the DNA fragmentation with respect to the control group {treated with CIP alone), evaluating the fluorescence variation at the wave length of 405-450 nm. 5 replicates for each sample are carried out.<br>
The drug meets the test, i.e. it can be used for preparing the compounds of general formula (I) and (11)/ when a statistically significant inhibition of apoptosis (cellular damage) induced by CIP with respect to the group treated with CIP alone is not obtained at p 
Test 3 (L-NAME) : evaluation of the endothelial dysfunction induced by administration   L-NAME (N -nitro-L-argentine-methyl ester) J. Clint. Investigation 90, 278-281,1S92.<br><br>
The endothelial dysfunction is evaluated by determining the damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa, the hepatic damage and blood hypertension induced by administration of L-NAME.<br>
The animals (rats) are divided in groups as herein below shown. The group receiving L-NAME is treated for 4 weeks with said compound dissolved at a concentration of 400 mg/liter in drinking water. The following groups are constituted (No. 10 initials for group):<br>
A)	Control groups:<br>
1° group: only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v of carboxy-methyl cellulose, dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered by so, physiologic solution when administered parenterally),<br>
2° group: carrier -»- L-NAME,<br>
B)	Groups administered with the drug:<br>
3° group: carrier + drug,<br>
4° group: carrier + drug + L-NAME.<br>
The administration routes are those known for the drug, and can be the oral or subcutaneous, intraperiteneal, intravenous or intramuscular route. The drug is administered at that dose which results the highest still tolerated by the caimans of the group of rats not pretreated with L-NAME, i.e. the highest administrable dose at which there is no evident toxicity in the animals /  i. e a toxicity recognizable for its symptoms. The drug is administered once a<br><br>
day for 4 weeks.<br>
At the end of the four weeks treatment access to water is prevented and after 24 hours the animals are sacrificed.<br>
One hour before the sacrifice blood-pressure is determined, and a blood pressure increase is taken as an evaluation of the damage to vascular endothelium. The damage to the gastric narcosis is evaluated as illustrated in test 1 (see example Fl). The hepatic damage is determined by evaluation of the glutei - pyruvic trans a-;incase (GPT increase) after sacrifice.<br>
The drug meets test 3, i.e. it can be used for preparing the compounds of general f oriole (I) and (II) , when in the group of rats treated with L-N.-ides + drug + carrier it is found an higher hepatic damage (GPT) and/or an higher gastric damage and/or an higher cardiovascular (blood-pressure) damage in comparison to that of the group treated with the carrier alone, or of the group treated with carrier + drug, or of the group treated with carrier -i- L-NAME; even if the drug pharmacy-therapeutic efficacy, assayed by specific tests, is not significantly reduced.<br>
Under the conditions indicated in the above described in vivo tests 1 and 3 the therapeutic index of the drug is reduced since the usual doses at which the drug can be effective are no longer tolerated.<br>
It has been found by the Applicant that the precursors of<br><br>
3 or 3i do not meet test 4 reported hereinafter while they meet, as said, test 5.<br>
Test 4 is a colorimetric test which must not be satisfied by the precursor of B or B;^ (precursor of the X2 or X23 of the formulas (I) and (II) respectively). The ' inhibition of the production of radicals from DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-l-picr-yl-hyd-razyl) is described in M.S. Nester et Al. , Atherosclerosis. Thrombi. 15, 133S-1344, 1995. old uM solutions in methanol of the tested substances are prepared, and an aliquot of each of said solutions is added to a DPPH solution in methanol 0,1 M. After having stored the' solutions at room temperature away from light for 30 minutes, their absorbance’s are read at the wave length of 517 nm, together with that of the corresponding DPPH solution at the same concentration. The absorbance decrease with respect to that of the solution of DPPH at the same concentration  of  the  test  solutions  is  determined.  The effectiveness of the tested compound in inhibiting formation of radicals by DPPH is expressed by the following formula:<br>
(1 - As/Ac)X100 wherein Ag and A  are respectively the absorbance values of the solution containing the test compound together with DPPH and of the solution, containing only DPPH. Test 4 is satisfied when the inhibition is equal or greater than 50%.<br>
Test 5 is a colorimetric test wherein 0.1 ml aliquots of   solutions the tested products are added to<br><br>
test tubes containing a solution formed by 0.2 ml of 2 raM desoxyribose, 0.4 ml of phosphate buffer of 1 mM Fe-'MNHJ J (504)2 in 2mM KCl. The test tubes are then maintained at 37*C for one hour. Then in each test tube 0. 5 ml of a 2.8% solution in water of trichloroacetic acid and C.5 ml of an aqueous 0.1 M solution of thiobarbituric acid are added, in the crder. A reference blank is formed ' adding to a test tube containing only the above described aqueous solution of reactants of methanol.  The test tubes are closed and heated in an oil bath at 100°C for 15 minuets. A pink coloration is developed the intensity of which is proportional to the quantity of desoxyribose undergone to radical oxidative degradation. The solutions are cooled at room temperature and their absorbencies are read at 53 2 nm against the blank. The inhibition induced by the precursor of 3 or Boor C = -T-Y-H in the confront of radical production by Fe is determined by means of the following formula:<br>
(1 - A,/Ai)X100 wherein A and k are respectively the absorbance values of the solution containing the tested compound + the iron salt and that of the solution containing only the iron salt, the coir pound meets test 5 when the inhibition percentage of radical production as above defined from the precursor of 3 or 3^ or c = -T^-Y-K is higher than or equal to 50%.<br>
Unexpectedly the invention products of the formulas (I)<br><br>
and (II) have an improved therapeutic index, in oxidative stress conditions, compared with the precursor drugs.<br>
For illustrative purposes the above mentioned tests are referred to the following compounds (see the Examples):<br>
Test 1: precise drug: indomethacin<br>
Maximum administrable dose to rats: 7,5 mg/Kg p.o.  By<br>
administering a higher dose a toxicity is manifested,<br>
characterized by naturopathy, tremor, sedation until death<br>
(within 24 hours).<br>
The group of rats treated with NEK + indomethacin at the<br>
above mentioned dose shows gastrointestinal damages.<br>
Since indomethacin in the groups treated with NEM causes gastrointestinal * damages, it meets test 1. Indomethacin can therefore be used as a drug for preparing the compounds (I) and (11) of the present invention.<br>
rest 2: precursor drugs: indomethacin, paracetamol and mesala-nine<br>
Indomethacin and paracetamol meet test 2 since the cellular damage (apoptosis) inhibition induced by CIP is not significantly different with respect to that of the controls.<br>
Therefore the a-bone drugs can be used as drugs for preparing the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention.<br>
On the contrary me seal amine does not meet test 2, since it inhibits the apoptosis induced by CI?. Therefore mesa amine<br><br>
according to test 2 could not be used as a precursor to prepare the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention. It has been however found that mesalair.ine submitted to test 1 causes gastrointestinal drainages.<br>
Thus also mesa amine can be used as a precursor for preparing the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention. Test 3 precurosr drugs: paracetamol, simvastatin, omeprazole<br>
Paracetamol and simvastatin meet test 3 since they cause gastric and hepatic drainages greater than those induced both by L-NAME + carrier and by the drug + carrier.<br>
Therefore they can be used as precursors to prepare the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention.<br>
On the contrary it has been found that omeprazole neither causes gastric nor hepatic damages, nor influences blood-pressure. According to test 3 omeprazole could not be used as a precursor for preparing the compounds (I) and (II) of the present invention.<br>
Test 4 (test for the precursor of B and B^^): precursor compound: N-acetylcysteine and 4-thiazolidincarboxylic acid<br>
N-acetylcysteine in said test inhibits of 100% the production of radicals induced by DPPH. Since said percentage is higher than the limit of 50%, said drug cannot be used in the present invention as precursor of B or B-, .<br>
4-Thia20lidincarboxylic acid does not inhibit at any<br><br>
extent the production of radicals induced DPPK {Table V). Thus the drug does not meet test 4 as requested by the instant invention and it could be used as a precursor of B or B^ if it meets test 5,<br>
Test 5 (test for the precursor of B. B and C= -T-Y-H) : precursor compound: 4 - thiazolidincarboxylic acid<br>
Table III relating to this test shows that the 4-<br>
thiazolidincarbcxylic acid meets test 5 since the % inhibition<br>
is of 100%. Therefore the compound can be used as precursor of<br>
B or of B- .<br>
yin formula (III) is preferably selected from the<br>
following:<br><br>
The most preferred of Y is yi2 (pyridyl) substituted in positions 2 and 6. The bonds can also be in asymmetric position, for example Y12  can be substituted also in position 2 and 3; Yl (parasol) may be 3,5-disubstituted.<br>
The compounds according zoo the present invention of for-similar (I) and (II) can be transformed into the corresponding<br><br>
salts. For example one way to furor; salts is the following: when in the molecule one nitrogen atom sufficiently basic to be salaried, by reaction in organic solvent such as for example acetonitrile; tetrahydrofuran, is present; it is reacted with an equimolecular amount of the corresponding organic or inorganic acid. To form the salt, preferably in the formula of the invention compound Y or Y' of formula (III) is present.<br>
Examples of organic acids are: oxalic, tartaric, maleic, succinic; citric acids.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are: nitric, hydrochloric, sulphur Ic, phosphoric acids.<br>
The derivatives according to the invention can be used in the therapeutic indications of the precursor drug, allowing to obtain the advantages exemplified hereinafter for some groups of these drugs:<br>

Said drugs can be used also in those pathologies wherein inflammation plays a significant pathogenesis role, such as for instance, but not limited to, in cancer, asthma, monadic infarction. Adrenergic blockers, of a- or -blocker type: the action spectrum the compo’ rids of formula (I) results wider than that the starting drugs: to a direct action on the<br><br>
smooth musculature the inhibition of the nervous beta-adrenergic signals governing the contraction of the hematic vessels is associated. The side effects (dyspnoea, bronchoconstriction) affecting the respiratory apparatus are lower.<br>
Antithrombotic drugs: the antiplatelet activity is potentiated and in the case of the aspirin derivatives the gastric tolerability is improved.<br>
Bronchodilators and drugs active on the cholinergic system: the side effects affecting the cardio-vascular apparatus (tachycardia, hypertension) result lowered. Expectorants and mucolytic drugs: the gastrointestinal tolerability results improved.<br>
Diphosphonates: the toxicity relating to the gastrointestinal tract is drastically lowered.<br>
Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (bronchodilators): the therapeutic efficacy is improved, the dosage being actual; it is therefore possible, using the compounds of the invention to administer a lover dose of the drug and reduce the side effects.<br>
Anti leukotrienic drugs: better efficacy. ACE inhibitors: better therapeutic efficacy and lower side effects  (dyspnoea,  cough)  affecting the respiratory apparatus. Antidiabetic   drugs    (insulin-sensitizing   and<br><br>
hypoglycaeiTiizing) ,  antibiotic ,  antiviral,  antitumoral,<br>
anticolitic drugs, drugs for the dementia therapy: better<br>
efficacy and/or tolerability.<br>

Some synthesis schemes for obtaining the compounds of the<br>
invention are reported hereinafter:<br>
A) Synthesis of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
1.   Synthesis of the compound obtained by reaction between the precursor drug and the compound precursor of B.<br>
la. When the drug has general formula R-COOH and the functional group of the precursor compound of B which binds itself to the drug carboxylic function has the formula XZ, X being as above defined and Z = H, the reactions carried out depend on the nature of the second reactive group present in the precursor compound of B.<br>
la.l When the second reactive group present in the precursor compound of B is a carboxylic group, the synthesis general scheme expects the initial formation of the halide of the R-Coal acid (Hal = CI, Br) and the subsequent reaction with the HX group of the  precursor compound of B:<br>
RCOOH	Ronal + H-X-X2-COOH	 <br>
R-T;^-T3-X2'C00H      (lA.l) X2/ T  Tg being as above defined.<br>
When in the two reaction compounds other functional groups COOH and/or HX are present, they must be protected before the reaction according to the methods known in the art; for example as described in the volume by Th.

The Ronal acylhalide is prepared according to the methods known in the prior art, for example by thionyl or orally chloride, P  or P halides in inert solvents under the reaction conditions, such as for example toluene  chloroform, DMF, etc.<br>
Specifically, if the HX group of the precursor compound of B is NH2' °^ '^^ ^^ ^^'  ® precursor drug of formula R-COOH is first converted into the corresponding acyl halide RCOHal, as above mentioned, and then reacted with the HX group of the precursor compound of B in the presence of an organic base, such as triethylamine, pyridine, etc. using an inert solvent in the reaction conditions such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran urban, etc, at a temperature in the range 0°C-25°C.<br>
Alternatively to the previous synthesis, the precursor drug of formula R-COOH can be treated with an agent activating the carboxyl group selected from N,N' -carbonyldii-raidazol (CDI), N-hydroxybenzotriazol and dicyclohexylcar-bodiimide in solvent such as for example DMF, THF, chloroform etc. at a temperature in the range -5°C - 50®C and the obtained compound let react in situ with the reactive function of the precursor compound of B for obtaining the compound of formula (lA.1). la.2 When the precursor compound of 3 contains two fxmctional groups X2, cereal to or different from each other, X being<br><br>
as above defined and Z = H, the precursor drug having formula R-COOH is first treated with an agent activating the carboxyl group, as above described in all, and then with the precursor compound of B, after having protected one of the two reactive HX groups, for example by reaction with acetyl or ter-butyloxycarbonyl, restoring the initial function at the synthesis end. The scheme is the following:<br><br>
2 .  Nitroxyderivative synthesis.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL TESTS<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Acute Toxicity<br>
Acute toxicity has been evaluated by adminisL-ering to a group of 10 rats weighing 20 g a single dose of each of the tested compounds, by canola, by so in an ac--eons suspension of carboxymethylcellulose 2% w/v.<br>
The animals are kept under observation for 14 days. In no animal of the group toxic symptoms appeared even after administration of a 100 mg/Kg dose. EXAMPLE Fl<br>
Test 1 - experimental model in vivo with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM): study of the gastric tolerability of some drugs screened as precursors of the compounds of the invents-ion.<br>
The animals (rats, weight about 200 g) are distributed in the following groups (No. 10 animals for group): A) Control groups: 1  group: treatment: only carrier (caribous suspension 1% w/v<br><br>
of carboxyTT.ethylcellulose,  dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered by so, physiologic solution when by parenterally route), 2° group: treatment: carrier    N'EM, B) Groups administered with each drug: group I:  treatment: carrier  <br>
The drugs assayed in this experiment are the following (Table I): indomethacin, ambrcxcl, mesa amine, sodic alendronate ; terrine, omeprazole, misoprostol.<br>
Indomethacin, amoroso and alendronate are administered by OS, mesalamine by intracolonic (rectal) route and tacrine, ome-prazol, misoprostol by subcutaneous route.<br>
The maximum tolerated dose; determined by administering each substance by the above said routes to the animals not treated with NEM, is reported in Table I. With higher doses than those reported in the Table; neuropathy, diarrhea, depression, tremor and sedation have appeared in the animals.<br>
In this experimental model the animals are at first treated with NEM by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 25 mg/kg in physiologic solution. The drug is administered one hour later, in suspension in the carrier. Animals are sacrificed after 24 hours and evaluation of the damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa is made by counting the number of rats, inside each group, with lesions to the stomach at a visual<br><br>
inspection. The total number of said rats is then divided by the total number of rats of the group and multiplied by 100. The thus obtained percentages are reported in Table I. The Table shows that in the groups of rats treated with said drugs without NEM, no gastric lesions were detectable.<br>
All the rats of group II (treated with NEM) showed gastric lesions after adrrdnistration vita the following drugs: indo-methacin, amoroso; mesalairdne, sodic alendronate, tacrine. Said drugs therefore can be used in the synthesis of the products of the invention.<br>
Omeprazole and misoprostol cannot instead be used, on the basis of the results provided in test 1, for preparing the products of the invention. EXAMPLE F2<br>
Test 2 (in vitro): inhibition of apoptosis (DNA fragmentation) induced in the endothelial cells by CIP in the presence of some drugs screened as precursors of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The following precursor drugs (Table II): indomethacin, paracetamol; clopidogrel, salbutamol, amoroso, sodic alendronate , diphylline, satirizing; enalapril, nicotinamide, am-pickling, aciclovir, mesalairdne, tacrine, simvastine, OMe -pyrazol have been tested.<br>
Human endothelial cells of the umbilical vein are prepared according to a standard method, fresh umbilical veins are filled with a collagenase solution   0.1% by weight and<br><br>
incubated at 37'='C for 5 minuses.<br>
Subsequently the veins are perfused with the medium M 199 (GIBCO, Grand Island, MY) pH 7.4 vita 0.1% (weight/volume) of collagenase,   added with 10% of bovine fetus serum (10 mcg/ml),   sodium heparin (50   rr.cg/ml) ,   thiinidine   (2.4 mcg/ml) ,   glutamine  (230  mcg/ml) ,  penicillin (100 Ul/ml), streptomycin (100 mcg/ml) and streptomycin 5 (0.125 mcg/ml). The cells are collected from -he perforate by centrifugation at 800 rpm and harvested in culture flasks T-75, pretreated with human fibronectin. Cells are rhea harvested in the same medium, added with bovine hypothalamic growth factor (100 ni/ml). When the cells of the primary cell culture (the cells directly removed from ex-vivo umbilical vein) form a single layer of confluent cells (about 8,000,000 cells/flask); harvesting is stopped and the layers are washed and trypsinized. The cellular suspensions are transferred into wells of a culture plate having 24 wells, half of said wells being added with the same culture medium containing the drug at a 10*% concentration, and harvested in a thermostat at 37 at a constant moisture (90%), CO2 = 5%.  When the drug is not soluble in the culture medium, it is formerly dissolved in a small amount of di-methylsulphoxide. The maximum amount of dimethylsulphoxide which can be added to the culture medium is 0.5%. Only the cells coming from these first subcultures are used for the tests with cumene hydroperoxide (CI?). The cells are identified<br><br>
as endothelial cells ■ by morphological examination and by the specific immunological reaction towards factor VIII; these cultures did never show contaminations from yachts or fibroblasts.<br>
Before starting the test, the cellular culture medium is removed and the cellular layers are carefully washed with a standard physiologic solution buffered with phosphate 0.1 M pH 7.0. at the temperature of 37  . The content of each well is then incubated for one hour with a CI? suspension in the culture medium at a 5 mM concentration. Evaluation of the cellular damage (apoptosis) is carried out by determining the per cent variation of the DNA fragmentation in the cultures containing hue drug + CIP with respect to the controls treated with CIP only. Said % variation of DNA fragmentation is determined by evaluating the fluorescence variation by a BX60 Olympus microscope (Olympus Co, , Roma) set at the wave length of 405-450 nm, of the test samples with respect to the optical density of the controls. The fluorescence of each sample was determined on 5 replicates, Statistic evaluation has been made with t Student test (p 
Results are given in Table II skid show that indomethacin, paracetamol,. clopidogrel, salbutamol, sodic alendronate, diphylline, satirizing, enalapril, nicotinamide, ampicilline, aciclovir, tacrine, omeprazole do not significantly inhibit apoptosis; these drugs can therefore be used for preparing the<br><br>
products of the invention.<br>
On the contrary ainbrcxol, laesalanine and simvastatine inhibit apoptosis. Therefore on the basis of the results of test 2 these compounds could not be used for preparing the products of the invention, EXAMPLE F3<br>
Test 3 - experimental in vivo model with K"-nitro-L-argentine-methyl ester (L-NAME): gastric tolerability (gastrointestinal damage incidence), hepatic (GPT dosage, glutei - pyruvic transaminase) and cardiovascular {blood pressure) tolerability of some drugs screened as precursors of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The experimental model adopted is according to J. Clint. Investigation 90, 278-281,1532.<br>
The endothelial"dysf-unction is evaluated shy determining the damage induced by L-NAME administration to the gastrointestinal mucosa, the hepatic dirge (GPT increase) , and the vascular endothelium or cardiovascular damage as blood hypertension.<br>
The animals (rats, average weight 200 g) are divided in groups as herein below described. The group receiving L-NAME is treated for 4 weeks with said compound dissolved at the concentration of 400 mg/liter in drinking grater. The following groups (No. 10 animals for group) are constituted: A) Control groups:<br><br>
1° group: treatment: only carrier (aqueous suspension 1% w/v of carboxymethylcelluLose;  dose: 5 ml/Kg when the drug is administered tee so, physiologic solution when by parenterally roué), 2 group: treatment: carrier - L-NAME, B) Groups treated with the drug: 3° group: treatment: carrier -^ drug, 4° group: treatment: carrier  drug + L-NA2<br>
The drugs used in the test are paracetamol, doxorubicin, simvastatine, omeprazole and misoprostol. Each drug is administered once a day for 4 weeks.<br>
The maximum tolerated dose of the drug being administered to the animals is determined evaluating, in a separate dose scaling up experiment on untreated animals, the appearance in the animals of symptoms such as entreaty, diarrhea, depression, tremor, sedation,<br>
At the end of the four weeks access to water is prevented and after 24 hours the animals are sacrificed.<br>
One hour before the sacrifice blood pressure is determined and a blood pressure increase is taken as an indication of a damage being occurred to vascular endothelium.<br>
The damage to the gas :ric -mucosa is evaluated as previously mentioned in test '.. (ex. Fl). The hepatic damage is determined by evaluation after the sacrifice of the glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT increase).<br><br>
The drug meets test 3 and it can therefore be used for preparing the compounds of the invention, when in the group of rats treated with L-NAME + drug + carrier, an higher hepatic damage (higher GPT values) and/or higher gastric damage and/or higher cardiovascular damage (higher blood.pessure) are found in comparison with the group treated with the carrier only, or the group treated with carrier + drug, or the group treated with carrier + L-NAME.<br>
The test results are reported in Table IV, The % gastric<br>
lesions have been determined as in Test 1. The % GPT and % blood pressure values are referred to the corresponding value<br>
found in the animals of the 1st group of the control groups.<br>
The average value of the blood pressure in this group was of<br>
105 ± 8 mmHg.<br>
The results obtained show that paracetamol, doxorubicin<br>
and sirrrvastatine cause hepatic damage and gastroenteropathy<br>
(GPT values and the gastric lesions are % higher compared both<br>
with the corresponding groups treated with the drug, in the<br>
absence of L-NAME, and with the controls treated with L-NAME) . These drugs can therefore be used for preparing the<br>
products of the invention.<br>
Omeprazole and misoprostol should not instead be used, on<br>
the basis of this test, for preparing the products of the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE F4<br><br>
Test 4: inhibition of the radical production frown DPPH of some substances used as precursors of B or Bl (ref. Formulas I aid II of the invention)<br>
The method is based on a colorimetric test in which DPPH (2; 2-diphenyl-l-picryl-hydrazyl) is used as the compound-forming radicals (M.S. Nester et Al. , Atherosclerosis. Thrombus. 15, 1338-1344; 1995).<br>
Solutions in methanol of the tested substances at a final concentration 100 uM are initially prepared. 0,1 ml of each of these solutions are added to aliquots of 1 ml of a methanol solution 0.1 M of DPPH and then the final volume is brought to 1.5 ml. After having stored the solutions at room temperature away from light for 30 minutes, the absorbance at the wave length of 517 nm is read. It is determined the absorbance decrease with respect to the absorbance of a solution containing the same concentration of DPPH.<br>
The efficacy of the test compound to inhibit the production of radicals, or antiradical activity, is expressed by the following formula:<br>
{1 - As/A(.)X100 wherein Ag and A^ are, respectively, the absorbance values of the solution containing the test compound together + DPPH and of the solution containing only DPPH.<br>
The compound to be used according to the present invention does not meet test 4 if it inhibits radical production as ago-<br><br>
vet defined by a percentage of 50% or higher.<br>
In Table V the results obtained with the following substances are reported: N-acetylcisteine, cysteine, ferules acid, (L)-Caroline/ gent sic acid, 4-thiazolidin carboxylic acid and 2-OXO-4-thiazolidincarboxylic acid. Table V shows that:<br>
N-acetylciSteine, cysteine, ferule acid, (L)-Caroline, gneissic  acid .meet  test  4  since they inhibit  the production of  radicals induced by  DPPH in an extent higher than 50%,  therefore they cannot be used as precursors of B or B- of the compounds of the invention. 4-Thiazolidin   carboxylic   acid   and   2-oxo-4-thiazolidincarboxylic acid do not meet test 4 since they do not inhibit radical production from DPPH in an extent cereal or higher than 50%, and therefore they can be used as precursors of compounds B or B according to the present invention, provided they meet following test 5. EXAMPLE F5<br>
Test 5t inhibition of the radical production from Fe from compounds used as precursors of B, B or C = -T-Y-H<br>
0.1 ml aliquots of 10'- M ethanolic solutions of 4-thiazolidin carboxylic acid and 2-oxo-4-thia2olidin carboxylic acid are added to test tubes containing an aqueous solution formed by mixing 0»2 ml of 2 mM deoryribose, 0.4 rally of buffer phosphate pH 7.4 100 mM and 0.1 ml of 1 mM Fe^^ (KH4 &gt;2(S04)2 in<br><br>
2mM HCl. The test tubes are rhea kept at a temperature of 37<br>
for one hour. Then in each test tube are added in the order 0.5<br>
ml of. a 2.8% solution in trichloroacetic acid in water and 0.5<br>
ml of an aqueous solution 0.1 M  thio barbituric acid. A<br>
reference blank is constituted by substituting the above 0.1 ml<br>
aliquots of the test compound methanolic solutions with 0.1 ml<br>
of methanol.  The test tubes are closed and heated in an oil<br>
bath at 100°C for 15 minutes, A pink coloration develops the<br>
intensity of which is  proportional  to the quantity of<br>
deoxyribose undergone to radical oxidative degradation. The<br>
solutions are cooled at room temperature and their absorbance<br>
at 532 nm are read against the blank.<br>
The inhibition induced the precursor of B or B: or C = -T-Y-H (wherein the free valence is saturated as above defined) in the confront of radical production from Fe'- is determined as a percentage by means of the following formula:<br>
(1 - As/Ac)Clod wherein Ag and A are respectively the absorbance values of the solution containing the tested compound + the iron salt and that of the solution containing only the iron salt. The results are reported in Table III, from which it is drawn that both acids meet test 5, since they inhibit radical production from Fe in a percentage higher than 50%. Therefore both 4-thiasolidin carboxylic acid and 2-cxo-4-thiazolidin carboxylic acid can be used as precursors of 3, B;;_ or of C = -T-Y-H, for<br><br>
obtaining the compounds of chem. present invention,<br>
