BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present application is directed in general to systems<br>
and methods for communicating in telephone systems and in<br><br>
particular to systems and methods for using portable, wireless<br>
telephones integrated with a land-based wired telephone eyatem.<br>
The telephone industry has experienced tremendous growth in<br>
the last few years, driven in part by the availability of<br>
relatively inexpensive cellular telephone service.  In such<br>
service, telephone subscribers use portable, battery-powered,<br>
hand-held telephone instruments to communicate via RF links with<br>
a network of base stations which interface the signals on the RF<br>
links into the land-based public telephone network.  In such<br>
systems, a cellular configuration is generally used in which a<br>
particular base station uses certain frequencies to communicate<br>
with portable telephones within its "cell" and adjacent base<br>
stations use other f requencies _£© communicate with telephones<br>
within their cells.  If base stations are sufficiently distant<br>
from each other, the same frequencies may be used in both cells<br>
so long as neither the base station nor the telephones in one<br>
cell generate signals of sufficient power to carry into the other<br>
cell.  In this way, a limited number of frequencies can be re-<br>
used in a non-conflicting pattern which provides telephone<br>
service throughout a particular geographic area.  Of course, as a<br>
telephone leaves from one cell to another, the telephone may have<br>
to switch frequencies (or "hop" to a new channel) during the<br>
middle of an on-going call to avoid broadcasting into a non-<br>
adjacent cell which is using the same frequency for a different<br>
call.<br><br>
The use of cellular telephone technology has permitted broad<br>
geographic regions to be provided with the availability of many<br>
portable telephones.  As the popularity of portable telephones<br>
has expanded, however, the frequencies (or "channels") have<br>
become filled.  Within the limited R? bandwidth available for all<br>
the competing uses thereof, the solution to cellular overcrowding<br>
does not necessarily lie in merely adding additional frequencies<br>
or channels within each cell.<br>
It has been proposed in the prior art to utilize smaller<br>
cells and to reduce the power of the cellular equipment so that<br>
frequencies may be reused in greater proximity to one another.<br>
Such a solution is not entirely satisfactory, however, as with<br>
much reduced power levels, the signal to noise ratios of the<br>
communications may approach levels unacceptable in telephone<br>
communications.  Along these lines, -he prior art has proposed<br>
making an office building, a portion of an office building or an<br>
office complex a cell site or a small cellular system.  Given the<br>
crowding on the existing cellular systems, however, such proposed<br>
systems are generally limited in the number of portable<br>
telephones which they can accommodate.<br>
In many office situations, the persons working in the<br>
offices frequently are away from their assigned duty locations<br>
for extended periods of time and may even roam throughout the<br>
office as their business needs arise.  Providing telephone<br>
service to such roaming persons in the prior art often meant<br>
using call-forwarding schemes or the like to automatically route<br><br>
the call from one location to another.  Such systems usually<br>
required substantial user input to implement, a drawback in a<br>
typical office environment:."""" Thus, it is desirable to utilize<br>
portable or cellular technology for persons within an office.  In<br>
a typical office building, the addition of cellular telephones to<br>
the already-present land-based system, such as a Private Business<br>
Exchange (or "PBX1") provides some mobile communication but is<br>
insufficient for effective communication.  Generally, the<br>
portable telephones are tied to a base unit which integrates the<br>
RF communications of the cellular system with the public land-<br>
based telephone system and not directly with the business<br>
person's own PBX.  Effectively, such a solution in an office<br>
environment yields two independent telephone systems not well<br>
tied into each other or coordinated in any way.  Additionally,<br>
the external structure of the building housing the office may<br>
make impractical the transmission of typical cellular RF signals<br>
to and from conventional base stations.<br>
A solution to the desire to permit workers to roam within a<br>
particular geographic space, such as an office building or a<br>
portion of an office building, yet permit such workers to<br>
continue to be reachable by the telephone system and to permit<br>
the workers to utilize the advantages of the telephone system is<br>
to integrate a wireless system with a PBX.  With such an<br>
integration, incoming calls to workers can be directed by the<br>
wireless system to the worker wherever that person may be within<br>
the operating range of the system.  At: the same time, the roaming<br><br>
worker will be able to readily place telephone calls both within<br>
and without the office a(s readily as if sitting at his own desk<br>
on the hard-wired system.  The roaming worker would also have the<br>
benefit of all of the features of the PBX (such as a personalized<br>
repertory dialer, special access to restricted circuits, etc.) no<br>
matter where the worker may be located within the office.<br>
Desirably, a wireless-PBX system would include a portable<br>
telephone unit which is easy to use, lightweight and has an<br>
extended battery life.  The latter two desires are somewhat at<br>
odds with each other inasmuch as battery life often has a direct<br>
relation to the size (and weight) of a battery.  Accordingly, it<br>
is often important in the design of portable units that they be<br>
as power-efficient as possible.<br>
Within prior art cellular systems it is known for a<br>
particular base station to have associated therewith one or more<br>
control channels and several or numerous voice channels.  The<br>
control channels are used to communicate with the control<br>
portions of the portable units to coordinate the use of voice<br>
frequencies and to perform an analog of typical central office<br>
functions (e.g., dialing a number, ringing the portable unit,<br>
etc.).  When all of the voice channels within a base station are<br>
being utilized, there may no longer be a need for a control<br>
channel as there are no more control tasks to be performed until<br>
one of the voice channels again becomes available.  In such<br>
systems, it is desirable to not waste the non-functioning voice<br>
channel and an additional voice channel can be obtained to<br><br>
enlarge system capabilities over conventional systems with no<br>
additional hardware costs and no additional bandwidth being<br>
occupied by the system.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a novel system and method to integrate a wireless<br>
telephone system into a private branch exchange or similar office<br>
telephone system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
novel system and method to utilize every available channel of a<br>
wireless system for voice (or data) messages.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide<br>
a novel system and method for reducing power consumption within a<br>
portable unit without reducing capabilities of such a unit.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a novel system and method which can be installed in an<br>
office environment without extensive wiring and/or substantial<br>
programming.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
novel system and method of providing an integrated wireless-PBX<br>
telephone capability using housings which can be readily mounted<br>
on existing wall or ceiling surfaces of an office.<br>
It is yet a further object of the present invention to<br>
provide a novel system and method of: communicating in a wireless<br>
system in which base^st:at^ions_jnay readily be added to the system<br>
(or reset after a power outage) and brought on-line without<br>
extensive programming.<br><br>
It is still a further object of the present invention to<br>
provide a novel system and method for accurately and efficiently<br>
communicating between plural wireless telephones and plural base<br>
stations.<br>
These and many other objects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art to<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to Figure lj,_a telephone system using the<br>
it<br>
present invention may include a switch 10 which is connected to<br>
plural lines or trunks of a standard telephone network such as<br>
the public telephone network in the United States.  The switch 10<br>
is also connected to plural land-based telephones 14 via wires or<br>
t<br>
similar non-propagating media.  The switch 10 may also be<br>
connected through a Base Station Interface Unit ("BSIU") 16 to<br>
one or more base stations 18 through a base station connector 20.<br>
Each base station 18 includes means for wireless communications<br>
with plural portable telephones 22, as described further below.<br><br>
In operation, Che switch performs as a standard telephone<br>
switching unit such as a PBX, a PABX, key-system or the like and<br>
functionally interconnects telephones 14 with the public<br>
telephone network.  Such a switch 10 could be a switching unit<br>
such as the unit sold by Harris Corporation as the "Harris<br>
20/20".  Depending on the scope and complexity of the switch, it<br>
may have many features available to assist the telephone user<br>
with his calls including memory dialing, call forwarding, voice<br>
mail answering and delivery, and the many other features common<br>
on modern telephone switches.<br>
One of the tasks accomplished by the switch is the mapping<br>
of in-bound or intercom telephone calls to a desired telephone<br>
instrument and the provj^exonr- of- "outside lines" to system<br>
telephones upon request.  If an in-bound call is bound for one of<br>
the land-based telephones 14, the switch 10 conventionally rings<br>
the desired telephone through a wire connection and establishes a<br>
voice communicatipn path along the same or another wire<br>
connection between the desired telephone 14 and the outside line<br>
on which the call was received.<br>
Calls received by the switch 10 destined for portable<br>
telephones 22 are routed to the BSIU which sends the appropriate<br>
control information to the base station currently controlling the<br>
portable telephone 22 through methods described below.  When a<br>
call is to be connected between portable telephone 22 and another<br>
telephone, the switch 10 operates to direct the voice circuit to<br>
the BSIU 16, which in turn directs the voice circuit to a<br><br>
selected base station 18, which in turn sends information<br>
regarding the voice message on the voice circuit to the desired<br>
portable telephone 22 via a wireless link 24.<br>
As is well known, telephone voice circuits can be either<br>
analog or digital.  In one conventional system, the telephone<br>
lines arriving from the telephone network may be analog lines.<br>
Through conventional switch circuits, the switch 10 may route the<br>
analog voice circuits arriving from the telephone network to the<br>
land based telephones 14 in either analog or digital modes.  If a<br>
digital switch is being used, the switch 10 may first convert the<br>
voice information arriving from the analog telephone network to a<br>
series of digital bits and communicate those bits by conventional<br>
means to the land-based telephones 14.  Communications arriving<br>
from a digital land-based telephone 14 destined for the telephone<br>
network 12 may be transmitted from the telephone 14 to the switch<br>
10, converted to an equivalent analog signal and impressed on the<br>
lines from the telephone network 12.<br>
The present invention is not limited to use with only analog<br>
switches or only digital switches and the inventive concepts<br>
disclosed herein may readily be implemented in association with<br>
either analog or digital switches.  Nor is the present invention<br>
limited to use with a PBX or similar "stand-alone" equipment but<br>
may be applied to any telephone system or sub-system in which it<br>
is desired to integrate a wireless telephone with other<br>
telephones, wireless or landbased.  Thus, the switch 10 may<br>
itself communicate with the "external" telephone network 12<br>
10<br><br>
through any conventional means, not limited to wired systems,<br>
such as via microwave links.  Thus, while the descriptions of a<br>
preferred embodiment may describe a particular signal within a<br>
switch 10 as being a digital signal or an analog signal, the<br>
invention is not limited to systems having only such signals, the<br>
description being merely illustrative and not limiting.<br>
Analog telephone calls from the telephone network 12<br>
destined for one of the portable telephones 22 may be converted<br>
to a digital form within the switch 10 and are passed to the BSIU<br>
16.  At the BSIU, the digital information from the call may be<br>
combined with similar digital information from other calls and<br>
passed via the communication links 20 to the base station 18 then<br>
handling the call.  In turn, and in a method discussed below, the<br>
base station 18 may communicate the digital information from the<br>
telephone call to the desired portable telephone 22.  Note that<br>
as the present system is a telephone system, there exists a<br>
return path for the telephone call which simply reverses the flow<br>
described above to provide the digital form of the voice applied<br>
at the portable telephone 22 through the base station 18 and the<br>
BSIU 20 to the appropriate line from the telephone network 12.<br>
If the telephone network line is an analog line, the digital form<br>
of the return signal will be converted to the analog form for<br>
impression on the telephone network line 12.<br>
As is well known, evferT tHbugh a voice message may be thought<br>
of as continuous, the digital form o[ such a message does not<br>
need to be a continuous stream of digital bits.  Rather, if the<br>
11<br><br>
digital equipment is sufficiently fast, clusters of digital bits<br>
representing the voice signal may be transmitted together<br>
followed by a period of time before another cluster of bits must<br>
again be sent.  If the series of clusters of digital bits arrives<br>
within a certain latency period between clusters when the digital<br>
signal is converted bacft to analog, a user listening to the<br>
received analog signal cannot detect, the fact that the voice<br>
message was transmitted in separate portions.  The present<br>
invention utilizes this fact to permit multiple portable<br>
telephones to simultaneously time-share a single frequency or<br>
channel between a base station 18 and a portable telephone 22.<br>
With reference now to Figure 2, in a form of communication<br>
known as Time-Division-Multiple-Access, plural portable<br>
telephones may share a single frequency. As depicted in Figure 2,<br>
a particular frequency (or carrier) may be divided into plural<br>
slots, eight (8) in the system of Figure 2.  With proper<br>
coordination between a base station 19 and a portable telephone<br>
22, the portable telephone may expect: to receive its digital<br>
messages in slot 2, the slot repeatedly occurring as one of eight<br>
slots.  Thus, the portable telephone 22 receives the digital data<br>
in the slot 2 as shown in Figure 2.  Seven slots after the end of<br>
the first slot 2, a second slot 2 arrives, again bearing digital<br>
data for the specified portable telephone 22.  Each slot can<br>
deliver plural digital bits of data.  So long as the slots repeat<br>
with sufficient frequency, the portable telephone 22 will receive<br>
the digital form of the voice message at a sufficient rate that<br>
12<br><br>
the analog form of the message may be reconstructed accurately by<br>
a digital-to-analog conversion at the portable telephone 22.  The<br>
if<br>
length of time which may pass before consecutive slots must be<br>
received to avoid a loss of data depends upon how many bits are<br>
sent at one time and the frequencies of the sounds within the<br>
voice message in a well known relationship.  As noted previously,<br>
a typical telephone message is two-way and thus, two slots are<br>
needed for a telephone call, one for the passage of the digital<br>
signal to the portable telephone 22 and the other for the passage<br>
of the digital signal from the portable telephone 22.<br>
Because one telephone call occupies only two slots of the<br>
frame, the other slots are available for simultaneous usage by<br>
other portable telephones 22.   Generally, the base unit uses a<br>
particular protocol to inform the portable telephones 22 which<br>
slots are to be used for a particular telephone call and to<br>
ensure that all of the communicating portable telephones are<br>
synchronized (to avoid having two portable telephone transmitting<br>
at exactly the same time which would usually destroy the signals<br>
being transmitted by both.)<br>
In prior art systems, typically, the first slots of a frame<br>
are used for sending voice signals from the base station to the<br>
various portable telephones then being controlled by it.  For<br>
example, and with reference to Figure 3, an 9 slot frame of the<br>
prior art may use the first slot (CON) as a control slot (for<br>
sending control messages from the base unit to the stations,<br>
etc.), the next four slots for voice signals going from the base<br><br>
station to the portable telephone (Ti, T2, T3, T4) and the last<br>
four slots for voice signals going from the portable telephones<br>
to the base station (Rl, R2, R3, R4).<br>
In the system of the present invention, and as depicted in<br>
Figure 4, the first slot of a frame (CON) may be used as a<br>
control slot; however, in contrast to the prior art, the<br>
remaining slots are divided into two half-slots with the base<br>
station transmitting in the first half-slot and the base station<br>
receiving (portable telephone sending) in the second half-slot of<br>
each slot.<br>
Compared with the prior art, the use of the present<br>
invention is- particularly beneficial in reducing power<br>
consumption by a portable telephone..  It is known in the prior<br>
art to reduce the power supplied to the communication portions of<br>
a portable telephone when the communication portions are not<br>
expected to be needed.  Thus, for example that in the prior art<br>
system of Figure 3, a portable telephone could reduce the power<br>
to its communication portions in all but three slots, i...e. , the<br>
slots when it is scheduled to transmit, to receive and to<br>
communicate within the control slot..  In one aspect of the<br>
present invention, the communication portions of the portable<br>
telephone are required to be fully energized only during one slot<br>
(as explained below, the portable telephone of the present<br>
invention may not need to monitor the communication channel (or<br>
slot) while it is engaged in a telephone call.   Thus, the<br>
present invention reduces the relatively inefficient periods<br>
14<br><br>
during which power is being brought, up and reduced from the<br>
communications circuits in addition to reducing the need to power<br>
up such circuits at all during fewer slots per frame.<br>
As is known in prior art systems, the control channel can be<br>
used to establish timing for the frames of the communications<br>
system and for communicating control information between the base<br>
station and the portable telephones.  For example during the<br>
periods of the control channels, the; base station can transmit<br>
data informing particular portable telephones which slots and<br>
frequencies to use for their voice data or informing a particular<br>
telephone how to react to certain user entries of the telephones<br>
keypad.  Also during the control slot, the system may provide a<br>
period of time during which any portable telephone seeking a<br>
voice circuit may transmit its request for such a circuit and/or<br>
may transmit other administrative data or functional requests of<br>
the base station or PBX.<br>
With reference now to Figure 5, the ability of a system of<br>
the present invention to provide continuous coverage of an area<br>
may be illustrated on an outline of a typical floor of an office<br>
space 50.  Within the office space !50, a number of walls 52<br>
divide the space into individual rooms 54 and corridors 56.  Base<br>
Stations BS 1 and BS 2 can be placed within the office space 50<br>
to provide telephone coverage throughout.  The number and<br>
location of Base Stations depends upon the amount of telephone<br>
traffic expected and the configuration of the space to be<br>
covered.  The space may be a portion of a single floor of a<br>
15<br><br>
building, multiple floors of a building, multiple buildings,<br>
and/or external space associated with the buildings.  When a user<br>
desires to use his portable telephone within the space covered by<br>
the system of the present invention, he may enter a set of<br>
instructions onto his portable telephone.  By a process discussed<br>
below, the portable telephone selects a Base Station with which<br>
to communicate and sends the user's request for a voice circuit<br>
to the selected Base Station during one of the control slots<br>
associated with that Bas,p-Stat±on.  The Base Station determines<br>
which slots and frequencies are available and returns a message<br>
to the portable telephone identifying the slot and frequency to<br>
be used by the portable telephone as a voice channel.  Through<br>
standard signallipg techniques, the portable telephone may then<br>
transmit the subscriber number of the telephone to be dialed or<br>
request some other function of the telephone system.<br>
By way of example and with continued reference to Figure 5,<br>
each of the Base Stations within the system may have associated<br>
with it a frequency to be used for its control channel.   When<br>
the portable telephone seeks a voice circuit or other function<br>
from the telephone system, the portable telephone may scan those<br>
frequencies known to be assigned as control channels to determine<br>
which control channel signal is received with the highest signal<br>
strength, signal to noise ratio, and/or any other metric of<br>
signal quality.  The control channel signal with the best quality<br>
having been selected, the portable telephone will then initiate<br>
contact with the Base Station sending that signal via the control<br><br><br>
channel.  With respect to the office space of Figure 5, portable<br>
telephones PT1 and PT3 may be expected to communicate with Base<br>
Station 1, if that base station has an available channel, because<br>
that base station is closejr than any other, otherwise portable<br>
telephones PT1 and PT2 may be expected to communicate with Base<br>
Station 2.  Similarly, portable telephone PT4 may be expected<br>
to communicate with (and obtain a voice channel from) communicate<br>
with Base Station 2 for the same reasons.  The base station with<br>
which PT3 and PT5 would communicate cannot be readily determined<br>
from the outline of the space of Figure 5.  Note that portable<br>
telephone PT5 is physically closer to Base Station 2 than to Base<br>
Station 1; however, the direct path between the portable<br>
telephone PT5 and Base Station 2 is through a wall.  Depending<br>
upon a myriad of factors, including the thickness and composition<br>
of the wall and the size of the door opening to the corridor from<br>
the room in which portable telephone PT5 is located, either Base<br>
Stations 1 or Base Station 2 (if available) might be where<br>
portable telephone PT5 lands.<br>
Note that by the use of the selection scheme of the present<br>
invention, the assignment of portable telephones to particular<br>
base stations is dynamic and takes into account local variations<br>
in the signals communicated between the portable telephone and<br>
the base station.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, incoming and<br>
outgoing telephone calls can be handled with practically the same<br>
processes at the portable telephone, the difference being only<br><br><br>
that the incoming telephone calls are preceded by a "Ring"<br>
signal.  Upon the receipt of the "Ring" signal, the present<br>
invention may use the same protocol in the portable telephone for<br>
both incoming and outgoing calls.<br>
During a telephone call at a particular portable telephone,<br>
the user of the portable telephone may be moving about the<br>
office.  As the user moves, he will at some time move away from<br>
the base station controlling the call.  In the system of the<br>
present invention, the portable telephone monitors the quality of<br>
the communications between the portable telephone and the base<br>
station and, upon the degradation of the signal below<br>
predetermined criteria, reselects its base station and requests<br>
that the call be moved to a new channel (or slot/frequency<br>
combination, explained below) at the base station then having the<br>
best communications with the portable telephone.  For example,<br>
and with reference again to Figure 5, a portable telephone at the<br>
location designated PT1 within the space may be expected to<br>
initially use the nearest base station BS1 (assuming that BS1 has<br>
an available channel).  If the user of the portable telephone<br>
then moves during the call from PTl to PT4, the signal between<br>
the portable telephone and its controlling base station (BS1 in<br>
this example) may degrade sufficiently to cause the portable<br>
telephone to seek a new communication path.  At the position<br>
designated PT4, the portable telephone may be expected to select<br>
the nearest base station, now BS2, and obtain a voice channel<br>
from the newly selected base station.  Note that in the system of<br><br><br>
the present invention, the portable telephone need not switch<br>
base stations merely because the user moves his location and<br>
another base station becomes closer and/or more direct.  Rather,<br>
to avoid unnecessary hopping from one channel to another, the<br>
portable telephone of the present invention may continue to stay<br>
with its present base station so long as the quality of the voice<br>
communication remains acceptable.<br>
The portable telephone may evaluate any characteristic of<br>
the communications channel between the portable telephone and the<br>
base station.  It has been found efficient in the present<br>
invention to use the voice quality estimate typically provided by<br>
a vocoder in the transmission circuit: as an estimate of signal<br>
quality.  The use of this estimate for control of hopping is<br>
particularly efficient because most vocoder circuits already<br>
develop the estimate as part of their volume control operation<br>
and thus this use avoids the need for another circuit or<br>
processing function.<br>
In the standby mode (no on-gong voice communications), the<br>
portable telephone may estimate signal quality based on the<br>
quality of the control channel from the base station.  If the<br>
signal quality degrades to a predetermined criteria, the portable<br>
telephone may switch to the control channel of another base<br>
station.  This technique, sometimes called soft roaming, may<br>
prevent a transient effect which can occur when a call is<br>
initiated or received by a portable telephone just before the<br>
signal quality in fact degrades to below the level needed for<br><br><br>
seeking a hop.  In such a situation on a newly established call,<br>
the portable telephone may not have obtained sufficient useful<br>
call quality data on the communications channel to accurately<br>
initiate a base station/frequency-slot switch.  By using this<br>
technique during stand-by modes, the system of the present<br>
invention attempts to increase the probability that the portable<br>
telephone will use the best base station nearby.<br>
By remaining in a given voice channel so long as the channel<br>
has acceptable communications, the portable unit typically does<br>
not need to monitor the control channel during a telephone call.<br>
Because the assigned slot occurs at a known repetition rate,<br>
during a voice communication the portable unit may deenergize its<br>
communication circuits except during the slot in which it is<br>
communicating.  Upon the end of a slot, the portable unit can<br>
deenergize its communications circuits and set a timer to<br>
reenergize such circuits immediately before the next occurrence<br>
of the assigned slot.  In the time periods between the slots, the<br>
portable telephone continues to convert any digital voice data<br>
received from the forward channel (the channel from the base<br>
station to the portable telephone) from digital to analog form<br>
for application to the telephone's speaker (or earpiece) and to<br>
accumulate digital information corresponding to any audio inputs<br>
(or user keypad entries) received during the time period between<br>
slots.  When the next slot occurs, the portable telephone<br>
receives the next packet of forward channel voice data and<br>
transmits the next packet of voice data input from the user<br><br><br>
during the inter-slot periods.  So long as the clocking circuits<br>
within the portable telephone remain sufficiently synchronized to<br>
the clocking circuits of the base stations, the portable<br>
telephone will be fully able to jump directly from one slot to<br>
the same slot in the next frame by use of timing circuits and<br>
without need to consult with the control channel.<br>
With reference now to Figure 6, in a system of the present<br>
invention, a slot or channel may be considered to be a particular<br>
slot/frequency combination.  In a system having eights slots per<br>
frame, there are eight channels or communication opportunities<br>
available per frame, each "opportunity" including a forward<br>
communication and a reverse (from the portable telephone to the<br>
base unit) communication.  Within a slot, the forward and reverse<br>
communications are carried out at the same carrier frequency.<br>
Thus, each base station has eight slots under its control.  Each<br>
of the slots is independent of the other slots within a frame and<br>
each slot may be at. any-,of--fehe—channel frequencies used within<br>
the system.  Thus, for example for base station 2 in the system<br>
of Figure 6, slot 1 (generally the control channel, but see<br>
below) may be the control channel operating a particular<br>
frequency, f6.  ^t the time of the example of the system of<br>
Figure 6, base station B also had three voice communications on-<br>
going, one portable telephone using frequency fl3 on slot 3,<br>
another using frequency f2 on slot 6 and still another using<br>
frequency f3 on slot 7.  Each of the slots starts a predetermined<br>
time after the start of the frame.  Thus, when a portable<br><br><br>
telephone is instructed by the base station to "use slot 6,<br>
frequency f2", the portable unit knows that it will receive<br>
forward voice data on frequency f2 the predetermined period of<br>
time associated with slot 6 after the beginning of each frame and<br>
that it is to send its reverse data on frequency f2 during the<br>
appropriate time within slot 6.<br>
In the system of the present invention, any of the assigned<br>
frequencies may be used in any slot at any base station.<br>
Accordingly, there are no assignments of frequencies or sets of<br>
frequencies to particular base stations.  This feature of the<br>
present invention provides considerable ease in installing the<br>
system, a replacement base station or a new base station.  In<br>
addition, this feature of the present invention provides<br>
considerable flexibility of the system to respond to highly<br>
mobile users and shifting service demands through the geography<br>
of a given system.<br>
In operation, a base station scans the channels assigned to<br>
the system to determine available slot/frequency combinations.<br>
By tuning to each of the assigned frequencies during its non-used<br>
slots, the base station can determine which slot/frequency<br>
combinations are not being used within its range and can assign<br>
one of those available slot/frequency combinations when a new<br>
voice channel is requested by a portable telephone.<br>
Significantly, the available slot/frequency combination data is<br>
done by each base station on a local basis.  Because of the<br>
limited range of the base stations and the portable telephones,<br><br><br>
the fact that a particular slot/frequency combination is being<br>
used within the system does not necessarily mean that it cannot<br>
be used elsewhere in the system.  For example, with reference to<br>
the system of Figure 6, base station A can assign one of the<br>
portable telephones being controlled by it to use slot 5 and<br>
frequency f9 and the same slot and frequency can be used in a<br>
relatively remote base station area such as in base station N of<br>
the system of Figure 6.  As long as the base stations and their<br>
controlled portable telephones are sufficiently remote,<br>
frequency/slot combinations can be used and reused multiple times<br>
throughout the system of £h~e^present invention, providing<br>
substantial capability for a system to handle many simultaneous<br>
telephone calls.<br>
Generally, the system of the present invention may use the<br>
monitoring of the system during unused slots to determine whether<br>
a slot/frequency combination is available to it.  If the base<br>
station cannot detect the on-going use of a particular<br>
slot/frequency, that slot/frequency may be considered "available"<br>
despite the fact that a relatively remote portable telephone and<br>
base station are using the same slot/frequency combination.  In<br>
such a system, it is possible that even though a particular base<br>
station is sufficiently remote from a particular use of a<br>
slot/frequency.combination that it believes the combination to be<br>
available, the portable telephone being controlled by that base<br>
station may receive interference from the "remote" use of the<br>
same slot/frequency combination.  However, because, as noted<br><br><br>
previously, the portable telephone is monitoring the quality of<br>
the voice signal being communicated during its assigned slot,<br>
such interference if it occurred would cause the portable<br>
telephone to initiate a hop to another frequency/slot combination<br>
at the same or another base station.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the capacity<br>
of the system to carry telephone calls may be improved by the use<br>
of disappearing control channels at each of the base stations.<br>
When all of the non-control channels are being used for on-going<br>
telephone calls, the base station is free to assign its control<br>
channel as a voice channel.  As noted earlier, once a telephone<br>
call is established on one of the slots, the portable telephone<br>
with that call has no further need t_o use the control channel of<br>
the base station.  If all of the "normal" voice channels are<br>
filled and only the control channel remains at a base station,<br>
once the base station assigns that channel as a voice channel,<br>
there simply is no need for a control channel at that base<br>
station so long as all the channels remain occupied with voice<br>
communications.  Any portable telephones desiring a new voice<br>
channel within the geographic area serviced by a base station<br>
which has given up its control channel will automatically not<br>
detect the base station as being available and will select<br>
another base station with which to communicate on its control<br>
channel.<br>
As mentioned previously, power reduction is an important<br>
consideration in the design of the portable telephones.  In<br><br><br>
another aspect of the present invention,power is reduced when a<br>
portable telephone is in a "stand-by" mode.  In this mode, the<br>
portable telephone is energized but voice communications are not<br>
occurring, principally-while—awaiting a new telephone call or for<br>
if<br>
the user to place his next telephone call.  In the stand-by mode,<br>
a portable telephone in accordance with one aspect of the present<br>
invention does not monitor every frame of the communications but<br>
rather monitors every Nth frame and upon completion of the<br>
monitoring, reducing power to the communications circuits and<br>
setting a timer to re-power the communication circuits after the<br>
passage of N-l frames.  The series of N frames is called a<br>
"superframe".   In this way, communication power consumption is<br>
reduced substantially, yet the telephone remains available to<br>
"answer" calls and to readily place calls upon user request.<br>
In one known problem in the prior art in communications<br>
between plural remote devices and a base station, all or many of<br>
the remote devices attempt to communicate with the base station's<br>
control channel at approximately the same time, colliding with<br>
each other's messages and permitting few or none to successfully<br>
communicate with the base unit.  Recall that in a system of the<br>
present invention, the portable units attempt to communicate with<br>
the base station by transmitting during a particular time period<br>
during and timed from the beginning of the control channel slot.<br>
If more than one portable telephone attempts to transmit<br>
simultaneously, neither may be successful.  The problems<br>
associated with collisions on the control channel can be<br><br>
particularly troublesome immediately after system turn on or<br>
reset when all of the portable telephones may attempt to reestablish<br>
contact with the base stations.  To reduce the<br>
collision on the control channel, a portable telephone of the<br>
present invention uses a number assigned to it to determine in<br>
which frame of a superframe to attempt to contact the base<br>
station's control channel.  The number assigned to the portable<br>
telephone may be programmed into one of its memories or may be<br>
input by way of DIP switches which can be read by the<br>
microprocessor within the telephone or any similar semi-permanent<br>
(or permanent) method.  In the system of the present invention,<br>
the base station indicates in the control channel the position of<br>
each frame within the superframe.  For example, if a superframe<br>
consists of 32 frames in a particular system, the control channel<br>
communication would include an indication that the successive<br>
frames numbered from 1 to 32.  Portable telephones may divide the<br>
assigned number by a modulus number, usually the number of frames<br>
in a superframe, and attempt to access the control channel during<br>
the frame having the number equal to the modulus remainder.  For<br>
example if a portable telephone has been assigned the number 179<br>
in a system having 32 frames per superframe, that portable would<br>
attempt to communicate with a base unit during the 19th frame of<br>
the superframe (i.e., 179 modulus 32 leaves a remainder of 19).<br>
Note that there is no need for each portable telephone to have a<br>
unique number so long as the numbers are assigned in a fashion<br><br>
which spreads the attempted accesses to the control channel over<br>
the entirety of the superframe.<br>
In the event that collisions occur on the control channel<br>
even with the advantages of the present invention, a fallback<br>
contention scheme can be used such as the scheme used in "slotted<br>
aloha" systems in which each colliding portable telephone waits a<br>
random period of time before attempting to access the control<br>
channel in the expectation that the randomness of the period will<br>
eliminate or reduce further collisions.<br>
It is well known in telecommunications systems that<br>
electromagnetic signals transmitted from one device often do not<br>
travel directly to a receiver but follow various paths bouncing<br>
from one object or surface to another until received.  Multipath<br>
is a particularly significant problem inside a building where a<br>
signal will bounce off walls, penetrate through walls and bounce<br>
off other surfaces until received.  During the bouncing and at<br>
the receiving antenna, the various multipath signals combine and<br>
interfere with each other so that the received signal is usually<br>
plural copies of the original signal arriving at different phases<br>
with various cancellations within the waveform.  To reduce the<br>
effects of multipath, it is known in the prior art to use plural<br>
antennas at the receiver to provide both spatial and frequency<br>
diversity.  In many such systems, the receiver contains logic<br>
circuits which select the antenna having the best signal,<br>
accepting the signal from that antenna and rejecting the other<br>
signals.  In other antenna diversity systems in the prior art,<br><br><br>
the receiver's circuitry attempts to combine the signals<br>
appearing at the diverse antennas.  Usually in the prior art, the<br>
latter systems have provided better reception but at a cost of<br>
increased complexity and circuitry.<br>
The problems associated with multipath are often exacerbated<br>
in a portable system in which power levels are generally low (to<br>
conserve power and permit frequency reuse) and in which the<br>
portable telephone is not fixed in space.  It is a frequent<br>
occurrence that the user readjusts the position of the portable<br>
telephone during a conversation, each time realigning the antenna<br>
with respect to the base station (generally internal to the<br>
telephone or fixed externally in orientation to the telephone).<br>
In addition, the user is often moving which will cause coriolis<br>
effects in the transmitted signal.  Thus, it is particularly<br>
useful in portable systems to use a diversity of antennas at both<br>
the base station and the portable telephone.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the system of<br>
the preset invention uses "duality" to improve signal reception.<br>
With reference to Figure 7, each base station 70 may include<br>
plural antennas 72 associated therewith.  During each slot in<br>
which the base station is communicating with a portable<br>
telephone, the portable telephone first communicates with the<br>
base station.  During the preamble portion of the communication<br>
from the portable telephone to the base station, the portable<br>
telephone includes within the preamble a predetermined bit<br>
pattern which the base unit uses to test the reception on each of<br><br><br>
its antennas (four in the system of Figure 7).  The base station<br>
then uses the best antenna to receive the rest of the<br>
communication from the portable telephone.  During the same slot,<br>
the base station has an opportunity to communicate forward data<br>
to the portable station and will use the same antenna to transmit<br>
such data as it just used to receive data from the portable unit.<br>
Because the base station transmit portion of the communication to<br>
the portable telephone immediately follows the receipt of a<br>
communication from the portable telephone and an evaluation of<br>
the best antenna to be used, it is unlikely that the portable<br>
station has changed its position such that the previously<br>
selected antenna is no longer the best one to be used between the<br>
base station and the telephone.<br>
The base station can use the same antenna evaluation and<br>
selection for each of its slots during'a frame.  Thus, it" is<br>
; entirely possible that the base station would select a different<br>
antenna to be used for each successive slot.<br>
It has been found by the present inventors that during<br>
antenna selection, the antennas may be switched while still<br>
measuring their signal quality.  The delays inherent in the<br>
switching chain and the delays in th^ measurement of the received<br>
RF signal, permit testing to continue for some period of time<br>
after an antenna has been commanded t.o be switched out of the<br>
communication.  The advantage of such a technique is the ability<br>
to test more signal data without having to dedicate more of the<br>
preamble to antenna diversity functions.<br><br><br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the antenna<br>
selection system may select the two best antennas for a given<br>
slot, using the best antenna for transmission to the portable<br>
telephone later in the slot and evaluating the two best antenna<br>
for attenuation setting evaluation.  If the signals received at<br>
the two best antennas exceed a predetermined figure of merit, an<br>
antenna can be added to the signal path during the next frame.<br>
On the contrary, if the two best signals are weaker than a<br>
predetermined figure of merit, the attenuation may be removed in<br>
the next frame.  In this way, the dynamic range of the reception<br>
may be enhanced as the attenuation is selectively added or<br>
removed based on the strength of the two signals.  The use of the<br>
signals from two antennas is not meant to be limiting to the<br>
invention and more signals may be used if desired, at an<br>
'increased processing burden.  Similarly, the figure of merit may"<br>
be related to the strength of the two signals, individually or<br>
combined in a desired manner, or to any other characteristic of<br>
the received signals.<br>
With continued reference to Figure 7, a base station of the<br>
present invention may be housed in a housing 76 of any suitable<br><br>
configuration, and desirably of a configuration which blends<br>
well into typical office decor.  The base station 70 may include<br>
plural independently attached antennas 74 which can be pivotally<br>
moved from a position nestled along the side of the housing 76<br>
(as seen with respect to the antenna 72a) or perpendicular<br>
thereto (as seen with respect to the antenna 72).  The antenna 72<br><br><br>
may be attached to the housing through any conventional means<br>
which permits rotation about a pivot 74 while maintaining<br>
electrical contact between the antenna and the circuits within<br>
the housing 76.  Optionally, the antenna may be attached to the<br>
housing by other conventional means which permits individual<br>
alignment such as by a ball and socket arrangement (not shown)<br>
which would permit rotation about more than a single axis.<br>
Indeed, physical attachment of the antennas to the housing is not<br>
necessary so long as an electrical path is maintained between the<br>
antennas and the base station communication circuits.<br>
In operation, the antennas 72 of the base station 70 may be<br>
aligned in any manner which increases the ability of the base<br>
station 70 to communicate with the portable telephones.  For<br>
example, in a system of the present embodiment, the base station<br>
and the portable telephones may be designed to use vertical<br>
polarization.  If the base station is mounted on a ceiling, all<br>
of the antennas 72 may be swung down to the vertical to provide<br>
an orientation which matches the ssystem design.  If the base<br>
station is affixed to a vertical wall, the bottom set of antennas<br>
may be left alongside the housing 76 while the two top antennas<br>
may be swung out 'l80 degrees to a vertically-upward position.<br>
Similarly, the antennas may be placed independently in any<br>
position relative to the housing 76 which increases signal<br>
throughput to a portable telephone to adjust for anomalous RF<br>
propagation conditions in the geographic area near the base<br>
station 70.<br><br>
One means for implementing the signalling between a portable<br>
telephone and a base station of the present invention is<br>
illustrated in the timing diagram of Figure 8, which depicts the<br>
functional composition of one-half a slot of the present<br>
invention.  The time slot may include plural bits of information,<br>
240 bits are used in one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The first portion of the slot comprises a preamble, which may<br>
include sufficient synchronization bits to permit the receiver to<br>
acquire the signal before the data is received.  Following the<br>
preamble may be a "unique word", .i.e.., a predetermined set of<br>
bits which are always found at the same location in a slot.  By<br>
use of a unique word at a known position within the slot, the<br>
receiver is able to synchronize its frame clock to that of the<br>
transmitter.  Following the unique word may occur plural "data"<br>
bits.  The data bits, depending upon the type of message'arid the "<br>
on-going activity at the transmitter, may include digital voice<br>
data, control data, command data, or the like (generally referred<br>
to herein as "application" data).  Finally, some type of checksum<br>
or CRC may be included to assist the receiver in ascertaining<br>
that it has received the message correctly.  Generally, any type<br>
of known validation scheme may be used within the communications,<br>
including checksums, check bits, folding checksums, error<br>
correction bits, etc., realizing that there is a tradeoff between<br>
the number of bits dedicated to message validity versus the data<br>
throughput of the system.<br><br>
During the preamble of the message from the portable<br>
telephones to the base units, the four antenna selection fields<br>
are included.  Note that because the antenna selection bits<br>
occupy a portion of the message which is conventionally used for<br>
recovering symbol timing, symbol recovery by the base station may<br>
be degraded unless other measures are undertaken.  One such<br>
measure could be to increase the size of the preamble relative to<br>
the data portion of the message or to increase the overall length<br>
of the message.  Both these options entail a reduction in the<br>
data bandwidth of the___system_T.  In one aspect of the present<br>
invention, neither bandwidth reducing measure is taken but a<br>
novel method of recovering the symbol timing is used.  With<br>
reference to Figure 8, in one aspect of the present invention,<br>
the symbol timing can be obtained from the output of a correlator<br>
through which the signal is applied.  In general, the received "<br>
signal may be sampled to provide plural samples for each symbol;'^<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, each symbol of the<br>
input signal is sampled ten times at the output of the<br>
correlator.  The magnitude of the correlator output at any one<br>
time corresponds to probability t:hat the center of the received<br>
symbol is at that time.  For each ith sample within the symbol,<br>
the total of the samples is obtained and compared to the total of<br>
all the other samples, with the greatest total indicating the<br>
sample most likely to correspond with the center of the symbol.<br>
In other words, the receiver may calculate the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
where K equals the number of samples per symbol, and TOTAL equals<br>
the total number of samples per slot (all the symbols).  Note<br>
that this aspect of the_ present invention uses the entire slot to<br>
determine symbol timing and then uses that determination to<br>
extract each of the symbols.  To implement this aspect of the<br>
invention, the incoming message may be stored in dynamic memory<br>
while the symbol timing is being extracted; however, the symbol<br>
timing determination may begin upon initial receipt of the<br>
message and need not await receipt of the entire slot.<br>
Once the symbol timing has been obtained the receiver of the<br>
present invention may use a "moving window" correlator to find<br>
the unique word.  There is~~no need in the present inventionrfor" a<br>
threshold correlator.  Thus, the correlator examines finite   ""'<br>
portions of the incoming signal having a length of an entire slot<br>
to determine where the unique word is most likely to be.  Once<br>
the correlator has determined the most likely location, the<br>
processor of the receiver may make a bit for bit inspection to<br>
the recovered slot to determine whether each bit of the assumed<br>
unique word is present in the incoming message.  If the unique<br>
word is found, the receiver may then set up all of its framing<br>
around the unique word, as it is predetermined where the unique<br>
word appears within a frame.<br><br>
Once Che unique word has been successfully acquired, the<br>
unique word in subsequet frames may be used to measure the drift<br>
between the transmitter and receiver and to adjust the receiver<br>
for that drift.  The acquisition cf the unique word in subsequent<br>
frames does not need to examine the entire frame, however, as a<br>
small window around the expected time for the unique word to<br>
appear will usually suffice and reduce the processing burden on<br>
the receiver.<br>
To assist the base stations in maintaining synchronization<br>
with each other so that they can correctly examine slot/frequency<br>
combinations, a system of the present invention may include a<br>
common clock pulse which is sent periodically to all the base<br>
stations.  The clock pulse may be derived from any relatively<br>
stable source such as from typical.switch-used in association<br>
with the base stations.  For example, in a Pulse Coded Modulation<br>
("PCM") system such as is often used in digital telephony<br>
applications,  one of the PCM slots between the base station and<br>
the switch may be periodically programmed to carry a<br>
synchronization (or reset) pulse which is received by all base<br>
stations and used to synchronize its clock and the communication<br>
frames derived therefrom.<br>
The use of a single stable clock helps assure data alignment<br>
and reduces the hardware costs as the base stations may not need<br>
an expensive oscillator if provided with an accurate clock from<br>
the switch.  Still further, the portable telephones may use a<br>
relatively inexpensive, and relatively less accurate, on-board<br><br><br>
reference clock in the present invention by frequency correcting<br>
the reference clock using the received RF carrier from the base<br>
station (which, in turn, is locked onto the accurate clock, such<br>
as the PCM clock, from the switch).<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a system may<br>
include a protocol in which the remote unit, upon the initiation<br>
of the user, may invoke a bit-error-rate ("BER") test of the<br>
communications between the remote unit and a base station.  This<br>
BER test may include the transmission by the remote unit, the<br>
base station or both of pseudo-random sequences.  Both the base<br>
unit nd the remote may use the receipt of such sequences to<br>
determine the BER and (in the case of the base station) may<br>
report the BER to the remote unit: for display to the user.  The<br>
displayed BER information is very useful to...system inst.4Ue.rs.to. .-.<br>
determine and/or verify system coverage and performance."" This *"<br>
aspect of the present invention is not limited to BER<br>
measurements and a system of the present invention may send<br>
signals and take signal measurements of any predetermined<br>
characteristic of the RF signal, such as signal strength.<br>
In still another aspect of the present invention, messages<br>
between the base stations and the portable telephones may include<br>
a system identifier which has beer, programmed into the portable<br>
telephones.  The system identifier may then be placed in the<br>
messages, for example in the preamble.  Portable telephones and<br>
base stations may then examine the system identifier and if it<br>
does not match the system identifier associated with the receiver<br><br><br>
may ignore the message entirely.  Thus, two totally separate<br>
systems may exist side-by-side to each other covering portions of<br>
the same geographic areas.   Similarly, the portable telephones<br>
may be programmed to operate on more than one installed system<br>
and would thereby be free to roam from one system to another.<br>
Depending upon traffic and security considerations, persons may<br>
be provided with portable telephones which \4ried in their<br>
abilities to be accessed fj|jbm various geographic areas by<br>
changing the system identifications which are authorized for<br>
particular portable telephones.<br>
Similarly, the portable telephones of the present invention<br>
may be used on multiple wireless systems without requiring the<br>
user to initiate any action other than to energize his remote<br>
unit. (The administrator of each system providing access to the<br>
portable telephone must configure the system to accept the<br>
portable telephone.)  This feature is particularly useful in<br>
installations in which different systems operate in different<br>
locations within the same (or nearby) business campus.  In such<br>
an installation, the user may travel Erom one area of the<br>
location to another, in which a wholly different wireless system<br>
has been installed, and still have full use of his portable<br>
telephone, including the personal features associated with that<br>
user.  On the other hand, if two adjacent systems do not wish to<br>
authorize the users of one system to use the other, the wireless<br>
system of the present invention automatically ignores<br>
unauthorized portable telephones and the portable telephones do<br><br><br>
not attempt to use the base stations and communications channels<br>
being used by the "foreign" system.<br>
The system of the present invention may also be used<br>
simultaneously as a pager system and a telephone system.  In this<br>
aspect, the portable telephones may receive an alphanumeric<br>
message for their displays and the ringer can be energized to<br>
alert the user of the message.  When used as a pager, the mobile<br>
station does not complete a telephone call to the user at the<br>
portable telephone but merely uses the existing communication<br>
system to forward the pager message.  The remote units used in a<br>
combination pager/telephone wireless system may be the same for<br>
all users, or optionally, some of the units used exclusively for<br>
paging may be reduced-cost units lacking the voice communications<br>
capability.<br>
With reference again to Figure 1, installation of the<br>
system of the present invention may be made relatively easy by<br>
its architecture.  For example, the switch may be a digital<br>
switch having associated therewith a BSIU 16 capable of<br>
communicating with the base stations 18 through a communication<br>
means 20.  The communication means 20 may be as simple as two<br>
sets of twisted wires, two of the wires being used for<br>
transmission of data to the base station 16 and two of the wires<br>
being used for transmission of data to the BSIU 16.  The<br>
transmission of data on the four wires can be made using a<br>
protocol known as E-l to handle the plural digital messages which<br>
may be simultaneously occurring on each pair of wires.  In<br><br><br>
addition, the four wires could also carry power and ground<br>
references to the base stations so that integration of the base<br>
station into a buildings electrical wiring is not necessary.<br>
In operation, a base station 18 can be mounted on any<br>
convenient surface, such as a wall or ceiling, and four wires<br>
carried between the base station 18 and the BSIU 16.  By use of a<br>
generalized power-up Programmable Read Only Memory ("PROM")<br>
„-...-   .     .  " ■:'~~tf	....:_   	  . .;<br>
"associated with the base station 18, the base station 18 may boot<br>
itself using the PROM upon the application of power from the<br>
communication means 20 or from the available electrical wiring.<br>
Once the base station 18 has booted, it may then send a message<br>
to the BSIU requesting a download of the system unique data and<br>
configuration.  Because the base station 18 does not have<br>
frequencies assigned and operates primarily on an evaluation of<br>
signal strength rather than telephone location, no extensive<br>
programming of the base station is generally necessary. _This<br>
lack of programming necessity makes installation of the system<br>
easier and provides for automatic resumption of service after a<br>
power failure or surge.<br>
In still"another embodiment of the present invention as<br>
depicted in Figure 10 (using common reference numerals as used in<br>
Figure 1 for common elements), a switch 10 used in the present<br>
invention need not be a digital switch as described above but may<br>
be a conventional analog switch which interconnects the public<br>
telephone network 12 to the system.  In such a system, a Base<br>
Station Interface Apparatus ("BSIA") 90 may be used to interface<br><br><br>
between the digital wireless system and a conventional analog<br>
switch 10.  The BSIA provides the wireless system (the base<br>
stations 18 and portable telephones 22) with all of the functions<br>
of the BSIU described with respect to Figure 1.  Additionally,<br>
the BSIA of the alternative system of Figure 10, converts all of<br>
the digital: communications to and from the portable telephones to<br>
conventionajl analog communications and may convert function<br>
requests from the portable telephones 22 into standard switch<br>
(e.g., PBX) protocols and signalling.  Alternatively, the BSIA 90<br>
may cause some of the functions to be implemented directly by the<br>
portable telephones by appropriately programming the portable<br>
telephones 22 (as explained below) t:o take specific, PBX-related<br>
actions in response to specified user inputs.<br>
With continued reference to Figure 10, the BSIA may be<br>
configured and controlled through a standard personal computer 91<br>
or similar computing device which may be removably attached to<br>
the BSIA 90 when desired.  The personal computer could be<br>
connected, for example, when the system administrator wanted to<br>
make configuration changes, initiate tests or gather data<br>
regarding the system's performance.  Software within the personal<br>
computer 91 would typically include software for: System<br>
Configuration, Uploading, Analysis of Performance  Statistics and<br>
Alarms, and Downloading of New Programs to the BSIA and base<br>
stations.  New or updated programming for the base stations may<br>
readily and conveniently be implemented by downloading such<br>
programs into the BSIA for communication to the base stations (or<br><br>
through the BSIU in systems such as in Figure 1).  Thus,<br>
reprogramming of new and improved features does not require<br>
removal or access to the base stations, resulting in significant<br>
savings for personnel in maintaining installed systems.<br>
The BSIA (or the BSIU) may also include the capability for<br>
the portable telephone user to execute macro commands by simple,<br>
brief keying actions.  In the macro capability, the BSIA may<br>
provide signals necessary for the protocol to the switch to be<br>
readily implemented by a single keystroke on the portable<br>
telephone.  For example, if a certain function in the switch<br>
required the successive transmission of the DTMF signals for the<br>
numbers 1, 2 and 3, a single function key on the portable<br>
telephone could be used to signal c:he BSIA that the exemplary<br>
function was desired.  The BSIA, in turn, would cause the DTMF<br>
signals for the numbers 1, 2 and 3 to be successively transmitted<br>
to the switch.  The switch receives the DTMF signals, understands<br>
that the requested function is desired and performs the actions<br>
conventionally necessary to perform the requested function.  A<br>
set of macros may be programmed into the BSIA, some of which are<br>
portable telephone dependent, so that the same key on different<br>
telephones may cause different signals to be sent to the switch.<br>
Still further, differing sets of macros may be developed for<br>
different types of switches to accommodate the differences in the<br>
switch protocols and the appropriate set downloaded into the BSIA<br>
during installation.<br><br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the portable<br>
telephone may include a display which can be programmed from the<br>
switch (through the base station) to customize features for the<br>
various telephones within a system.  After the system has been<br>
installed and energized, message may be sent from the switch to<br>
the telephone to provide certain features within the telephone<br>
and may control the appearance of the display on the telephone.<br>
For example, the display of the telephone can be made to resemble<br>
l<br>
the keypad and switches of'a conventional land-based telephone.<br>
By specifying the functions available to the telephone user, the<br>
switch may make the switches of one telephone operate wholly<br>
different functions than the switches at other telephones and may<br>
cause the telephone displays to show different images indicative<br>
of the functions programmed.  For example, in a telephone display<br>
which had five virtual switches thereon, the top switch on one<br>
telephone could be used for a "hold" feature and on a different<br>
telephone could be used for a "transfer" feature.  Accordingly,<br>
the display on the first telephone could be commanded to display<br>
"hold" within or near the image of the switch on the telephone's<br>
display while the second telephone could be commanded to display<br>
"transfer" at the same location on the display.  Changes to the<br>
display and features of the various portable telephones used in<br>
the system can be readily made centrally using the switch and the<br>
command structure of the present invention.  In addition, if the<br>
portable telephone user is required to provide a user-related<br>
code, each telephone could change its appearance and functions<br><br>
responsively to the user code and the same telephone would have<br>
different features depending upon the security level or service<br>
level of the user.<br>
The display may use both the familiar alphanumeric messages<br>
of present cellular telephones and icons, i.e., graphical images<br>
which suggest and represent certain states and actions such as<br>
"e-mail waiting", battery strength, speaker volume level, line<br>
status, etc.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention may also be<br>
configured to utilize one or more user interface characteristics<br>
described below to make the remote units easier to use.  For<br>
example, an embodiment of the present invention may include a<br>
user protocol in which the user may either dial the digits of<br>
telephone number to be dialed and then press an action key (such<br>
as a "CALL" key) or may first press the action key followed by<br>
the digits of the telephone numbei to be dialed.  The first<br>
method resembles the user protocol currently common in cellular<br>
telephone systems and the second method resembles the protocol<br>
commonly used in present cordless telephones.  In the present<br>
invention, the user may be provided with the option of using<br>
either protocol.<br>
In another useful protocol which may be used in the present<br>
invention, the user may press an action key twice to redial the<br>
last telephone number dialed.  For example, the user may press a<br>
"CALL" key twice, the first time obtaining dial tone and the<br>
second time redialing the previously dialed number.  The use of a<br><br>
single key assists the user by not requiring  search on the<br>
keypad for different keys to indicate Call and Redial functions.<br>
In still another useful protocol, incoming telephone calls<br>
may be redirected on an ad hoc basis by the user of a remote<br>
unit.  In this protocol, upon the receipt of  telephone call at<br>
the remote unit, the remote unit may indicate the incoming call.<br>
by a standard method such as by ringing or vibrating.	;<br>
Optionally, the remote unit may display the telephone number or1<br>
extension of the calling party.  The user may respond to the   :<br>
incoming call by either: pressing a "Call" key to answer the<br>
call; pressing a "Clear" key to mute the ringing and leave the<br>
call unanswered; or, pressing an "End""key to have the call<br>
automatically redirected to another unit such as another<br>
telephone, a message recording system, or a voice mail system.<br>
In yet another protocol feature which may be used in the<br>
present invention, the keyboard of a remote unit may be<br>
electronically locked so that only a limited number of keys my be<br>
used.  For example, a user may input a predetermined key sequence<br>
to lock the telephone from all use (except the unlocking<br>
functions) or to lock the telephone to a restricted state.  In<br>
the restricted state, the user may be permitted to use three<br>
keys, an "Unlock" key which restores full functions, a "Power"<br>
key to turn the remote unit off, and a "Call" key to answer<br>
incoming telephone calls.  With the remote unit in the restricted<br>
state, the remote unit may be freely carried about without<br>
concerns for inadvertent or unauthorized depressions of the keys.<br><br><br><br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have<br>
been described, it is to be understood that the embodiments<br>
described are illustrative only and the scope of the invention is<br>
to be defined solely by the appended claims when accorded a full<br>
