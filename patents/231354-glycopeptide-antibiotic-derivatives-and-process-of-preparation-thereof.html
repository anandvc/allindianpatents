				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a glycopeptide derivative of the formula 1 and the<br>
process of preparation of the compound thereof. The present invention further relates to<br>
compounds possessing antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant isolates.<br><br><br>
New improved antibiotics are continually in demand, particularly for the treatment of<br>
human diseases. Increased potency, expanded spectrum of bacterial inhibition, increased<br>
in vivo efficacy, and improved pharmaceutical properties are some of the goals for<br>
improved antibiotics.<br>
In the search for new antibiotics, structural modification of known antibiotics is<br>
attempted whenever possible. The glycopeptide antibiotics have such complex structures<br>
that even small changes are difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the effect these<br>
changes will make in the antimicrobial and physiological properties. Processes for<br>
modifying known antibiotics and the new active derivatives made by such processes,<br>
therefore, continue to be of great importance.<br>
Previously, N-alkyl and N-acyl derivatives of the glycopeptides vancomycin,<br>
A51568A, A51568B, M43A and M43D have been prepared (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,639,433,<br>
4,643,987, and 4,698,327). Several of these compounds exhibited microbiological<br>
activity, including activity against vancomycin-resistant isolates. Nicas et. al..<br>
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 33(9): 1477-1481 (1989). In addition,<br>
European Patent Application Publication No.0435503, published July 3, 1993, describes<br>
certain N-alkyl and N-acyl derivatives of the A82846 glycopeptides, factors A, B, and C.<br>
The formula I compounds of this invention are new members of the glycopeptide<br>
group of antibiotics. These new compounds are derivatives of known glycopeptide<br>
antibiotics that include vancomycin (U.S. Patent 3,067,099); A82846A, A82846B and<br>
A82846C (U.S. Patent 5,312,738, European Patent Publication 256,071 Al); PA-42867<br>
factors A, C, and D (U.S. Patent No.5,187,082); avoparcin (U.S. Patent 3.338,786 and<br>
U.S. Patent No.4,322,343); actinoidin, also known as K288 (J. Antibiotics SAeries A<br>
14:141 (1961); helevecardin (Chem. Abstracts 110:17188 (1989) and Japanese Patent<br>
Application 86/157,397); galacardin (chem.. Abstracts 110:17188 (1989)_and<br>
Japanese Patent Application 89/221,320); and M47767 (European Patent Publication<br><br>
339,982). The references listed above which describe these<br>
glycopeptides are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Enterococci are important human pathogens. Infections<br>
caused by enterococci are generally difficult to treat.<br>
Glycopeptides, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin, have become<br>
important therapies in the treatment of infections due to<br>
enterococci. However, strains of Enterococcus faecium and E.<br>
faecalis have recently been isolated that are resistant to<br>
vancomycin and teicoplanin. Leclercq et al., "Plasmid Mediated<br>
Resistance to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin in Enterococcus<br>
Faecium." The New England Journal of Medicine. 319(3):157-161<br>
(1988), and Uttley et al., "Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci,"<br>
Lancet. 1:57-58 (1988). The isolates were also found to be<br>
resistant to other antibiotics. A recent survey found 7.9% of<br>
Enterococci in United States hospitals are now vancomycin<br>
resistant. "Nosocomial Enterococci Resistant to Vancomycin"<br>
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 42 (30):597-598 (1993).<br>
In addition to their broad activity against gram-positive<br>
organisms, many of the glycopeptide compounds of this invention<br>
also exhibit improved antimicrobial activity against vancomycin<br>
resistant isolates.<br>

Formula I compounds that are prepared from A83850A or<br>
A83850B can be prepared from the reduced forms of these<br>
compounds. The reduced forms of compounds A83850A or A83850B<br>
are produced according to the method described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,187,082, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of this invention are prepared by reacting a<br>
formula II compound with an aldehyde to form an intermediate<br>
Schiff's base, which is subsequently reduced with a metal<br>
borohydride to give the desired N-alkyl amine.<br>
In the first method of making the compounds of this<br>
invention, hereinafter Method A (described in Examples 1 and 2),<br>
the reaction for the formation of the Schiff's base is carried<br>
out under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, in a<br>
polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or methanol<br>
(MeOH), or a mixture of polar solvents, such as a mixture of<br>
o<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol, at a temperature of about 25 C<br>
to about 100 C. The reaction is preferably carried out at a<br><br>
temperature from about 60 ºC to about 70 ºC for 30 minutes to 2<br>
hours in a mixture of dimethylformamide and methanol, or in<br>
methanol. The intermediate Schiff's base is then reduced,<br>
preferably without isolation, to produce the corresponding N-<br>
alkyl derivative(s). The reduction of the Schiff's base can be<br>
effected using a chemical reducing agent such as a metal<br>
borohydride, for example, sodium borohydride or sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride. The reduction reaction can be carried out in<br>
a polar organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, methanol, or<br>
a mixture of polar solvents, such as a mixture of<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol. The reduction reaction can be<br><br>
carried out at a temperature of about 25 ºC to about 100 ºC for 1<br>
to 5 hours. The reduction reaction is preferably carried out<br>
using an excess of sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixture of<br><br>
dimethylformamide and methanol or in methanol at about 60 ºC to<br><br>
about 70 ºC for 1 to 2 hours. Method A is preferable for<br>
benzylic aldehydes.<br>
In a second method of making compounds of this invention,<br>
hereinafter Method B (described in Example 3), the formation of<br><br>
the Schiff's base is carried out under an inert atmosphere, such<br>
as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of the reducing agent,<br>
sodium cyanoborohydride, in a polar solvent, such as<br>
dimethylformamide, methanol, or a mixture of polar solvents,<br>
such as a mixture of dimethylformamide and methanol, at a<br>
temperature of about 25 ºC to about 100 ºC for 1 to 5 hours. The<br>
reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature from about<br><br>
60 ºC to about 70 ºC for 1 to 2 hours in a mixture of<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol. Method B is preferable for non-<br>
benzylic aldehydes.<br>
In a third method of making compounds of this invention,<br>
hereinafter Method C (described in Example 4), the formation of<br>
the Schiff's base is carried out a) under an inert atmosphere,<br>
such as nitrogen or argon, b) in the presence of the reducing<br>
agent, such as a metal borohydride, with sodium cyanoborohydride<br>
being most preferred, or a homogenous or heterogeneous catalytic<br>
hydrogenation agent(s), such as Crabtree's catalyst, Wilkinson's<br>
catalyst, palladium on carbon, platinum on carbon, or rhodium on<br>
carbon, c) in a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide,<br>
methanol, or a mixture of polar solvents, such as a mixture of<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol, and d) at a temperature of<br><br>
about 25 ºC to about 100 ºC. The reaction is preferably carried<br>
out at a temperature from about 60 C to about 70 C in methanol.<br>
The reaction is allowed to continue for about 20 to about 28<br>
hours, at which time the reaction mixture is adjusted to about<br>
pH 7.5 to about pH 10, with a pH of about 9.0 being preferred.<br>
The pH adjustment halts the reaction. Because the product is<br>
marginally soluble in polar solvents, the solvent of the<br>
reaction can be exchanged to an alcohol such as ethanol,<br>
butanol, or isopropanol, with isopropanol being preferred, to<br>
allow for precipitation of the product. Method C is a preferred<br>
method of this invention in view of the increased product yield<br>
provided by this method. Another advantage of this reaction<br>
scheme is the increased ratio of preferred product (products<br>
substituted at the amino group of the sugar denoted as R1 in<br>
Formula II compounds) to other products (products that are<br>
substituted at the amino groups of substitutents denoted as R<br>
and/or R3 of the Formula II compounds). By allowing the<br><br>
reaction to proceed for an extended period of time, such as 20<br>
to 28 hours, products that are monosubstituted at positions<br>
denoted as R and R3 in the Formula II compounds are converted to<br>
disubstituted forms, making the preferred monosubstituted<br>
derivative easier to isolate.<br>
The products of the reaction, obtained from either Method<br>
A, B, or C can be purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC<br>
utilizing Waters C18 Nova-Pak columns with ultraviolet light<br>
(UV; 235 nm or 280 nm) detection. A 30 minute gradient solvent<br>
system consisting of 95% aqueous buffer/5% CH3CN at time=0<br>
minutes to 20% aqueous buffer/80% CH3CN at time=30 minutes is<br>
typically used, where the aqueous buffer is either TEAP (0.5%<br>
aqueous triethylamine adjusted to pH=3 with phosphoric acid) or<br>
TFA (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid overall concentration).<br>
HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures and final purified<br>
products can be accomplished utilizing a Waters C18 MicroBonda-<br>
Pak column (typically 3.9 x 300 mm steel) or Waters Nova-pak C18<br>
RCM column (8 x 100 mm) with UV (235 nm or 280 nm) detection. A<br>
30 minute gradient solvent system consisting of 95% aqueous<br>
buffer/5% CH3CN at time=0 minute to 20% aqueous buffer/80% CH3CN<br>
at time=30 minutes is typically used, where the aqueous buffer<br>
is either TEAP (0.5% aqueous triethylamine adjusted to pH=3 with<br>
phosphoric acid) or TFA (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid overall<br>
concentration).<br>
The ratio of the aldehyde to the formula II compound and<br>
the reaction conditions determines the products of the reaction.<br>
The monosubstituted derivatives are those derivatives where a<br>
hydrogen atom of the amino group at position R1 in formula II is<br>
replaced by one of the substituents listed above for formula I.<br>
When using Methods A or B, described above, the formation of<br>
monosubstituted derivatives substituted at the amino group of<br>
the amino sugar at position R1 in the formula II compounds is<br>
favored by using a slight excess of aldehyde, a shorter reaction<br>
time, and a lower temperature. As noted above, Method C favors<br>
the formation of the monosubstituted derivative. The<br>
monosubstituted derivative is preferred. A large excess of the<br>
aldehyde favors the formation of disubstituted and<br>
trisubstituted derivatives of the formula II compounds. The<br><br>
disubstituted derivatives are the derivatives where a hydrogen<br>
atom at two of the locations selected from the amino group at<br>
position R3, and the amino group of the amino sugars designated<br>
as R or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the reduced aldehyde<br>
moiety. The trisubstituted derivatives are the derivatives<br>
where a hydrogen atom at three of the locations selected from<br>
the amino group at position R3, and the amino group of the amino<br>
sugars designated as R or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the<br>
reduced aldehyde moiety.<br>
Examples of compounds that have been prepared and are<br>
illustrative of the formula I compounds are listed in Tables 2A<br>
and 2B. Table 2A lists compounds prepared by reacting an<br>
aldehyde with the glycopeptide A82846B. Table 2A lists the<br>

disaccharide of the A82846B compound. All of the compounds<br>
listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br>

reacting an aldehyde with a variety of glycopeptide antibiotics<br>
other than A82846B. The compounds of Table 2B are<br>
monosubstituted at the amino group of the amino sugar designated<br>
as R1 in formula II with the sidechain listed. All of the<br>
compounds listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br><br>
iisubstituted derivatives are the derivatives where a hydrogen<br>
atom at two of the locations selected from the amino group at<br>
position R3 and the amino group of the amino sugars designated<br>
as R or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the reduced aldehyde<br>
moiety. The trisubstituted derivatives are the derivatives<br>
where a hydrogen atom at three cf the locations selected from<br>
the amino group at position R3, and the amino group of the amino<br>
sugars designated as P. or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the<br>
reduced aldehyde moiety.<br>

aldehyde with the glycopeptide A82846B. Table 2A lists the<br>
sidechain substitutions on the amino group of the 4-epi-<br>
vancosaminyl sugar of the 4-epi-vancosaminyl-O-giycosyi<br>
disaccharide of the A82846B compound. All of the compounds<br>
listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br>
Table 2B lists those compounds that were prepared by<br>
reacting an aldehyde with a variety of giycopeptide antibiotics<br>
other than A8284 6B. The compounds of Table 23 are<br>
monosubstituted at the amino group of the amino sugar designated<br>
as R1 in formula II with the sidechain listed. All of the<br>
compounds listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The formula X compounds have in vitro and in vivo activity<br>
against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. The minimal<br>
inhibitory concentrations (MIC) at which the formula I compounds<br>
inhibit certain bacteria are given in Table 3. The MIC's were<br>
determined using a standard broth micro-dilution assay.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The formula I compounds have also shown in vivo<br>
antimicrobial activity against experimentally-induced infections<br>
in laboratory animals. When two doses of test compound were<br>
administered to mice experimentally infected with the test<br>
organism, the activity observed was measured as an ED50 value<br>
(effective dose in mg/kg to protect 50% of the test animals: see<br>
W. Wick et al., J. Bacteriol. 81, 233-235 (1961)). ED50 values<br>
observed for illustrative compounds are given in Table 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
One important aspect of the antimicrobial activity of many<br>
of the formula I compounds is their activity against vancomycin-<br>
resistant enterococci. This activity is illustrated in Table 5,<br>
which summarizes a comparison of the activity of illustrative<br>
compounds against representative vancomycin-resistant and<br>
vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (Enterococcus faecium and<br>
Enterococcus faecalis, mean geometric MIC (mcg/mL)), as<br>
determined using the standard broth micro-dilution assay. End<br>
points were read after 24-hour incubation. Modification of the<br>
amino sugar of the disaccharide moiety provides improved<br>
activity against vancomycin-resistant strains over the parent<br>
glycopeptide antibiotic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A number of the lactic acid bacteria including all<br>
Leuconostocs, all Pediococci, and some Lactobacilli, are<br>
intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. With the increased use<br>
of vancomycin, infections due to these bacteria have been<br>
reported with increasing frequency in immunocompromised patients<br>
(Handwerger et al., Reviews of Infectious Disease 12:602-610<br>
(1990); Ruoff et al., Journal of Clinical Microbiology 26:2064-<br>
2068 (1988)). One important aspect of the antimicrobial<br>
activity of the formula I. compounds is their activity against<br>
the vancomycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria. The compounds of<br>
the present are useful in inhibiting the growth of vancomycin-<br>
resistant lactic bacteria such as Leuconostoc, Pedicocci, and<br>
Lactobacilli and thus, controlling opportunistic infections by<br>
this group of bacteria. This activity is illustrated in Table<br>
6, which summarizes a comparison of the activity of illustrative<br>
compounds against representative vancomycin-resistant lactic<br>
acid bacteria (Pedicoccus acidilacti Pedicoccus pentosaceus,<br>
Leuconostoc lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc<br>
pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, and Lactobacillus<br>
confusus, mean geometric MIC (mcg/mL)), as determined using a<br>
standard agar dilution assay on brain-heart infusion agar.<br><br><br><br><br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the formula I compounds are<br>
also part of this invention. Thus, the compound, preferably in<br>
the form of a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt, can be<br>
formulated for oral or parenteral administration for the<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of bacterial infections.<br>
For example, the compound can be admixed with conventional<br>
pharmaceutical carriers and excipients and used in the form of<br>
tablets, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the<br>
like. The compositions comprising a formula I compound will<br>
contain from about 0.1 to about 90% by weight of the active<br>
compound, and more generally from about 10 to about 3 0%. The<br>
compositions may contain common carriers and excipients, such as<br>
corn starch or gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium<br>
chloride, and alginic acid.<br>
Disintegrators commonly used in the formulations of this<br>
invention include croscarmellose, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
corn starch, sodium starch glycolate and alginic acid.<br>
Tablet binders that can be included are acacia,<br>
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, poly-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
sucrose, starch and ethylcellulose.<br>
Lubricants that can be used include magnesium stearate or<br>
other metallic stearates, stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc,<br>
waxes, oils and colloidal silica.<br>
Flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen,<br>
cherry flavoring or the like can also be used.<br>
It may be desirable to add a coloring agent to make the<br>
dosage form more attractive in appearance or to help identify<br>
the product.<br>
For intravenous (IV) use, a water soluble form of the<br>
antibiotic can be dissolved in one of the commonly used<br>
intravenous fluids and administered by infusion. Such fluids<br>
as, for example, physiological saline, Ringer's solution, or 5%<br>
dextrose solution can be used.<br>
For intramuscular preparations, a sterile formulation of a<br>
suitable soluble salt form of the compound, for example the<br>
hydrochloride salt, can be dissolved and administered in a<br><br>
pharmaceutical diluent such as pyrogen-free water (distilled),<br>
physiological saline or 5% glucose solution. A suitable<br>
insoluble form of the compound may be prepared and administered<br>
as a suspension in an aqueous base or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable oil base, for example, an ester of a long chain fatty<br>
acid such as ethyl oleate.<br>
For oral use, a sterile formulation of a suitable salt form<br>
of the antibiotic, for example, the hydrochloride salt,<br>
formulated in a diluent such as distilled or deionized water, is<br>
particularly useful.<br>
Alternatively, the unit dosage form of the antibiotic can<br>
be a solution of the antibiotic, preferably in its salt form, in<br>
a suitable diluent in sterile, hermetically sealed ampoules.<br>
The concentration of the antibiotic in the unit dosage may vary,<br>
for example, from about 1 percent to about 5 0 percent depending<br>
on the particular form of the antibiotic and its solubility and<br>
the dose desired by the physician.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention provides a method for<br>
treating infectious diseases, especially those caused by Gram-<br>
positive microorganisms, in animals. The compounds of this<br>
invention are particularly useful in treating infections caused<br>
by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Also, the compounds are<br>
useful in treating infection due to enterococci. Examples of<br>
such diseases are severe staphylococcal infections, for example,<br>
staphylococcal endocarditis and staphylococcal septicemia. The<br>
animal may be either susceptible to, or infected with, the<br>
microorganism. The method comprises administering to the animal<br>
an amount of a formula I. compound which is effective for this<br>
purpose. In general, an effective amount of a formula I.<br>
compound is a dose between about 0.5 and about 100 mg/kg. A<br>
preferred dose is from about 1 to about 60 mg/kg of active<br>
compound. A typical daily dose for an adult human is from about<br>
50 mg to about 5 g.<br>
In practicing this method, the antibiotic can be<br>
administered in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per<br>
day. The treatment regimen may require administration over<br>
extended periods of time, for example, for several days or for<br>
from one to six weeks. The amount per administered dose or the<br><br>
total amount administered will depend on such factors as the<br>
nature and severity of the infection, the age and general health<br>
of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the antibiotic<br>
and the microorganism or microorganisms involved in the<br>
infection.<br>
A convenient method of practicing the treatment method is<br>
to administer the antibiotic via intravenous infusion. In this<br>
procedure a sterile formulation of a suitable soluble salt of<br>
the antibiotic is incorporated in a physiological fluid, such as<br>
5% dextrose solution, and the resulting solution is infused<br>
slowly IV. Alternatively, the piggy-back method of IV infusion<br>
can also be used.<br>
In order to illustrate more fully the operation of this<br>
invention, the following examples are provided, but are not to<br>
be construed as a limitation on the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
METHOD A<br>
Preparation of Compound 2<br>
A mixture of A82846B•triacetate, (2.25 g, 1.27 mmol, 1.0<br>
equivalents (eq)) in 1:1 DMF/methanol (140 mL) under an<br>
atmosphere of argon was treated with 4-biphenylcarboxaldehyde<br>
(331 mg, 2.12 mmol, 1.7 eq). The resulting mixture was heated<br>
to 70°C and maintained as such for 1.75-2 hours. The solution<br>
was then treated with sodium cyanoborohydride (554 mg, 8.83<br>
mmol, 6.9 eq). Heating at 70°C was continued for an additional<br>
1.75-2 hours after which the reaction mixture was cooled to room<br>
temperature, concentrated in vacuo, diluted with water (150 mL),<br>
and lyophilized to give a solid.<br>
The solid was purified by preparative reverse-phase high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters 3 x (40<br>
x 100.mm) C18 Nova-Pak cartridge with Waters C18 Nova-pak guard<br>
insert and utilizing TEAP buffer system. The analytical method<br>
for analysis was: 0.2% TEA/phosphoric acid (TEAP), pH = 3, the<br><br>
gradient system at time 0 was 5% CH3CN/94.8% H2O with 0.2% TEAP<br>
held constant and at 20 minutes was 60% CH3CN/3 9.8% H2O with<br>
0.2% TEAP held constant. The UV wavelength used was 235 ran and<br>
the flow rate was 2 ml/minute. Analysis was done using a Waters<br>
Nova-pak C18 RCM column (8 X 100mm) with a Nova-pak C18 guard<br>
insert. It is necessary to desalt the product after reverse<br>
phase purification when this HPLC method is used.<br>
Desalting was accomplished by adding the purified product<br>
to 5-10 ml of H2O. 1 N HC1 was added dropwise with stirring to<br>
dissolve the sample. The pH at this point was approximately 1-<br>
3. The pH of the solution was then raised to 8.2 with 1 N NaOH.<br>
A white solid precipitated out of solution. The mixture was<br>
cooled, filtered, and dried under vacuum at room temperature for<br>
8-15 hours to give the zwitter ion (or neutral compound) of the<br>
desired product, compound 2 (p-phenylbenzyl•A82846B), (1.02 g,<br>
45%) .<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of Compound 4<br>
A mixture of A82846B-triacetate (1.5 g, 0.848 mmol, 1.0 eq)<br>
in methanol (100 mL) under an atmosphere of argon was treated<br>
with p-phenoxybenzaldehyde (298 mg, 1.51 mmol, 1.8 eq). The<br>
resulting mixture was heated to reflux and maintained as such<br>
for 2 hours. The solution was then treated with sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride (326 mg, 5.18 mmol, 6.1 eq). Heating at reflux<br>
was continued for an additional 2 hours after which the reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to room temperature and evaporated to dryness<br>
in vacuo.<br>
The product was purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a TFA<br>
buffer. The analytical method for analysis was accomplished by<br>
using a Waters Nova-pak C18 RCM column (8 x 100 mm) with a Nova-<br>
pak C18 guard insert, eluting with a 2.0 ml/minute linear<br>
gradient of 15% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA at time zero to 80%<br>
acetonitrile/0.1% TFA at 15 minutes. The fractions containing<br>
the products were detected by ultraviolet scan at 235 nm. The<br>
organic solvent of the desired fractions was removed and the<br><br>
mixture was lyophilized to a white solid to give 0.618 mg of p-<br>
phenoxybenzyl-A82846B compound 4•tris(trifluroacetate) salt (20%<br>
yield). No desalting or further purification was necessary.<br>
This method is also especially useful in the preparation of<br>
Compound 2 wherein phenylbenzaldehyde is one of the starting<br>
materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Method B<br>
Preparation of Compound 176<br>
A mixture of A82846B•triacetate (280 mg, 0.157 mmol, 1.0<br>
eq) in 1:1 DMF/methanol (30 mL) was treated with 8-phenyloctanal<br>
(59 mg, 0.2 9 mmol, 1.8 eq) and sodium cyanoborohydride (60 mg,<br>
0.95 mmol, 6.1 eq). The resulting mixture was heated, under an<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen, to 70°C and maintained as such for 1<br>
hour. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature<br>
and concentrated in vacuo to give a residue. Purification of<br>
the product was accomplished by reverse-phase preparative HPLC<br>
utilizing a Waters 2 x (40 x 100 mm) C18 Nova-Pak cartridge with<br>
Waters C18 Nova-Pak guard insert. Elution was accomplished with<br>
a 30 minute linear gradient (time=0 minutes 95% TEAP (0.5%<br>
aqueous triethylamine adjusted to pH=3 with phosphoric acid)/5%<br>
CH3CN to t = 30 minutes 20% TEAP/80% CH3CN) with a flow rate of<br>
40 mL/minute and UV detection at 280 nm. The desired fraction<br>
was concentrated in vacuo then desalted with a Waters Sep-Pak<br>
cartridge as described below. This afforded compound 176 in 22%<br>
yield (60 mg).<br>
The resulting compound was desalted as follows. A Waters<br>
Sep-Pak cartridge was pre-wet with methanol (2-3 column volumes)<br>
then conditioned with water (2-3 column volumes). The sample,<br>
dissolved in a minimum volume of water, was loaded onto the Sep-<br>
Pak column which was then washed with water (2-3 column volumes)<br>
to remove the unwanted salts. The product was then eluted with<br>
an appropriate solvent system, typically 1:1 CH3CN/H2O, CH3CN,<br>
and/or methanol. The organic solvent component was removed in<br><br>
vacuo and the resulting aqueous solution lyophilized to give the<br>
final product.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of Compound 229<br>
A three liter 3-necked flask was fitted with a condenser,<br>
nitrogen inlet and overhead mechanical stirring apparatus. The<br>
flask was charged with pulverized A82846B acetate salt (20.0 g,<br>
1.21 x 10-3 mol) and methanol (1000 mL) under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. 4'-chlorobiphenylcarboxaldehyde (2.88 g, 1.33 x 10-<br>
2 mol, 1.1 eq.) was added to this stirred mixture, followed by<br>
methanol (500 mL). Finally, sodium cyanoborohydride (0.84 g,<br>
1.33 x 10-2 mol, 1.1 eq.) was added followed by methanol (500<br>
mL). The resulting mixture was heated to reflux (about 65°C).<br>
After 1 hour at reflux, the reaction mixture attained<br>
homogeneity. After 25 hours at reflux, the heat source was<br>
removed and the clear reaction mixture was measured with a pH<br>
meter (6.97 at 58.0°C). 1 N NaOH (22.8 mL) was added dropwise<br>
to adjust the pH to 9.0 (at 54.7°C). The flask was equipped<br>
with a distillation head and the mixture was concentrated under<br>
partial vacuum to a weight of 322.3 grams while maintaining the<br>
pot temperature between 40-45°C.<br>
The distillation head was replaced with an addition funnel<br>
containing 500 mL of isopropanol (IPA). The IPA was added<br>
dropwise to the room temperature solution over 1 hour. After<br>
approximately 1/3 of the IPA was added, a granular precipitate<br>
formed. The remaining IPA was added at a faster rate after<br>
precipitation had commenced. The flask was weighed and found to<br>
hold 714.4 grams of the IPA/methanol slurry.<br>
The flask was re-equipped with a still-head and distilled<br>
under partial vacuum to remove the remaining methanol. The<br>
resulting slurry (377.8 g) was allowed to chill in the freezer<br>
overnight. The crude product was filtered through a<br>
polypropylene pad and rinsed twice with 25 mL of cold IPA.<br>
After pulling dry on the funnel for 5 minutes, the material was<br>
placed in the vacuum oven to dry at 40°C. A light pink solid<br><br>
(22.87 g (theory = 22.43 g)) was recovered. HPLC analysis<br>
versus a standard indicated 68.0% weight percent of Compound 229<br>
(4-[4-chlorophenyl]benzyl-A82846B] in the crude solid, which<br>
translated into a corrected crude yield of 69.3%.<br>
The products of the reaction were analyzed by reverse-phase<br>
HPLC utilizing a Zorbax SB-C18 column with ultraviolet light<br>
(UV; 230 nm) detection. A 20 minute gradient solvent system<br>
consisting of 95% aqueous buffer/5% CH3CN at time=0 minutes to<br>
40% aqueous buffer/60% CH3CN at time=20 minutes was used, where<br>
the aqueous buffer was TEAP (5 ml CH3CN, 3 ml phosphoric acid in<br>
1000 ml water).<br>

Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a glycopeptide derivative of the formula 1 and the<br>
process of preparation of the compound thereof. The present invention further relates to<br>
compounds possessing antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant isolates.<br><br><br>
New improved antibiotics are continually in demand, particularly for the treatment of<br>
human diseases. Increased potency, expanded spectrum of bacterial inhibition, increased<br>
in vivo efficacy, and improved pharmaceutical properties are some of the goals for<br>
improved antibiotics.<br>
In the search for new antibiotics, structural modification of known antibiotics is<br>
attempted whenever possible. The glycopeptide antibiotics have such complex structures<br>
that even small changes are difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the effect these<br>
changes will make in the antimicrobial and physiological properties. Processes for<br>
modifying known antibiotics and the new active derivatives made by such processes,<br>
therefore, continue to be of great importance.<br>
Previously, N-alkyl and N-acyl derivatives of the glycopeptides vancomycin,<br>
A51568A, A51568B, M43A and M43D have been prepared (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,639,433,<br>
4,643,987, and 4,698,327). Several of these compounds exhibited microbiological<br>
activity, including activity against vancomycin-resistant isolates. Nicas et. al..<br>
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 33(9): 1477-1481 (1989). In addition,<br>
European Patent Application Publication No.0435503, published July 3, 1993, describes<br>
certain N-alkyl and N-acyl derivatives of the A82846 glycopeptides, factors A, B, and C.<br>
The formula I compounds of this invention are new members of the glycopeptide<br>
group of antibiotics. These new compounds are derivatives of known glycopeptide<br>
antibiotics that include vancomycin (U.S. Patent 3,067,099); A82846A, A82846B and<br>
A82846C (U.S. Patent 5,312,738, European Patent Publication 256,071 Al); PA-42867<br>
factors A, C, and D (U.S. Patent No.5,187,082); avoparcin (U.S. Patent 3.338,786 and<br>
U.S. Patent No.4,322,343); actinoidin, also known as K288 (J. Antibiotics SAeries A<br>
14:141 (1961); helevecardin (Chem. Abstracts 110:17188 (1989) and Japanese Patent<br>
Application 86/157,397); galacardin (chem.. Abstracts 110:17188 (1989)_and<br>
Japanese Patent Application 89/221,320); and M47767 (European Patent Publication<br><br>
339,982). The references listed above which describe these<br>
glycopeptides are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Enterococci are important human pathogens. Infections<br>
caused by enterococci are generally difficult to treat.<br>
Glycopeptides, such as vancomycin and teicoplanin, have become<br>
important therapies in the treatment of infections due to<br>
enterococci. However, strains of Enterococcus faecium and E.<br>
faecalis have recently been isolated that are resistant to<br>
vancomycin and teicoplanin. Leclercq et al., "Plasmid Mediated<br>
Resistance to Vancomycin and Teicoplanin in Enterococcus<br>
Faecium." The New England Journal of Medicine. 319(3):157-161<br>
(1988), and Uttley et al., "Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci,"<br>
Lancet. 1:57-58 (1988). The isolates were also found to be<br>
resistant to other antibiotics. A recent survey found 7.9% of<br>
Enterococci in United States hospitals are now vancomycin<br>
resistant. "Nosocomial Enterococci Resistant to Vancomycin"<br>
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 42 (30):597-598 (1993).<br>
In addition to their broad activity against gram-positive<br>
organisms, many of the glycopeptide compounds of this invention<br>
also exhibit improved antimicrobial activity against vancomycin<br>
resistant isolates.<br>

Formula I compounds that are prepared from A83850A or<br>
A83850B can be prepared from the reduced forms of these<br>
compounds. The reduced forms of compounds A83850A or A83850B<br>
are produced according to the method described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,187,082, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of this invention are prepared by reacting a<br>
formula II compound with an aldehyde to form an intermediate<br>
Schiff's base, which is subsequently reduced with a metal<br>
borohydride to give the desired N-alkyl amine.<br>
In the first method of making the compounds of this<br>
invention, hereinafter Method A (described in Examples 1 and 2),<br>
the reaction for the formation of the Schiff's base is carried<br>
out under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, in a<br>
polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or methanol<br>
(MeOH), or a mixture of polar solvents, such as a mixture of<br>
o<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol, at a temperature of about 25 C<br>
to about 100 C. The reaction is preferably carried out at a<br><br>
temperature from about 60 ºC to about 70 ºC for 30 minutes to 2<br>
hours in a mixture of dimethylformamide and methanol, or in<br>
methanol. The intermediate Schiff's base is then reduced,<br>
preferably without isolation, to produce the corresponding N-<br>
alkyl derivative(s). The reduction of the Schiff's base can be<br>
effected using a chemical reducing agent such as a metal<br>
borohydride, for example, sodium borohydride or sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride. The reduction reaction can be carried out in<br>
a polar organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, methanol, or<br>
a mixture of polar solvents, such as a mixture of<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol. The reduction reaction can be<br><br>
carried out at a temperature of about 25 ºC to about 100 ºC for 1<br>
to 5 hours. The reduction reaction is preferably carried out<br>
using an excess of sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixture of<br><br>
dimethylformamide and methanol or in methanol at about 60 ºC to<br><br>
about 70 ºC for 1 to 2 hours. Method A is preferable for<br>
benzylic aldehydes.<br>
In a second method of making compounds of this invention,<br>
hereinafter Method B (described in Example 3), the formation of<br><br>
the Schiff's base is carried out under an inert atmosphere, such<br>
as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of the reducing agent,<br>
sodium cyanoborohydride, in a polar solvent, such as<br>
dimethylformamide, methanol, or a mixture of polar solvents,<br>
such as a mixture of dimethylformamide and methanol, at a<br>
temperature of about 25 ºC to about 100 ºC for 1 to 5 hours. The<br>
reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature from about<br><br>
60 ºC to about 70 ºC for 1 to 2 hours in a mixture of<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol. Method B is preferable for non-<br>
benzylic aldehydes.<br>
In a third method of making compounds of this invention,<br>
hereinafter Method C (described in Example 4), the formation of<br>
the Schiff's base is carried out a) under an inert atmosphere,<br>
such as nitrogen or argon, b) in the presence of the reducing<br>
agent, such as a metal borohydride, with sodium cyanoborohydride<br>
being most preferred, or a homogenous or heterogeneous catalytic<br>
hydrogenation agent(s), such as Crabtree's catalyst, Wilkinson's<br>
catalyst, palladium on carbon, platinum on carbon, or rhodium on<br>
carbon, c) in a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide,<br>
methanol, or a mixture of polar solvents, such as a mixture of<br>
dimethylformamide and methanol, and d) at a temperature of<br><br>
about 25 ºC to about 100 ºC. The reaction is preferably carried<br>
out at a temperature from about 60 C to about 70 C in methanol.<br>
The reaction is allowed to continue for about 20 to about 28<br>
hours, at which time the reaction mixture is adjusted to about<br>
pH 7.5 to about pH 10, with a pH of about 9.0 being preferred.<br>
The pH adjustment halts the reaction. Because the product is<br>
marginally soluble in polar solvents, the solvent of the<br>
reaction can be exchanged to an alcohol such as ethanol,<br>
butanol, or isopropanol, with isopropanol being preferred, to<br>
allow for precipitation of the product. Method C is a preferred<br>
method of this invention in view of the increased product yield<br>
provided by this method. Another advantage of this reaction<br>
scheme is the increased ratio of preferred product (products<br>
substituted at the amino group of the sugar denoted as R1 in<br>
Formula II compounds) to other products (products that are<br>
substituted at the amino groups of substitutents denoted as R<br>
and/or R3 of the Formula II compounds). By allowing the<br><br>
reaction to proceed for an extended period of time, such as 20<br>
to 28 hours, products that are monosubstituted at positions<br>
denoted as R and R3 in the Formula II compounds are converted to<br>
disubstituted forms, making the preferred monosubstituted<br>
derivative easier to isolate.<br>
The products of the reaction, obtained from either Method<br>
A, B, or C can be purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC<br>
utilizing Waters C18 Nova-Pak columns with ultraviolet light<br>
(UV; 235 nm or 280 nm) detection. A 30 minute gradient solvent<br>
system consisting of 95% aqueous buffer/5% CH3CN at time=0<br>
minutes to 20% aqueous buffer/80% CH3CN at time=30 minutes is<br>
typically used, where the aqueous buffer is either TEAP (0.5%<br>
aqueous triethylamine adjusted to pH=3 with phosphoric acid) or<br>
TFA (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid overall concentration).<br>
HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures and final purified<br>
products can be accomplished utilizing a Waters C18 MicroBonda-<br>
Pak column (typically 3.9 x 300 mm steel) or Waters Nova-pak C18<br>
RCM column (8 x 100 mm) with UV (235 nm or 280 nm) detection. A<br>
30 minute gradient solvent system consisting of 95% aqueous<br>
buffer/5% CH3CN at time=0 minute to 20% aqueous buffer/80% CH3CN<br>
at time=30 minutes is typically used, where the aqueous buffer<br>
is either TEAP (0.5% aqueous triethylamine adjusted to pH=3 with<br>
phosphoric acid) or TFA (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid overall<br>
concentration).<br>
The ratio of the aldehyde to the formula II compound and<br>
the reaction conditions determines the products of the reaction.<br>
The monosubstituted derivatives are those derivatives where a<br>
hydrogen atom of the amino group at position R1 in formula II is<br>
replaced by one of the substituents listed above for formula I.<br>
When using Methods A or B, described above, the formation of<br>
monosubstituted derivatives substituted at the amino group of<br>
the amino sugar at position R1 in the formula II compounds is<br>
favored by using a slight excess of aldehyde, a shorter reaction<br>
time, and a lower temperature. As noted above, Method C favors<br>
the formation of the monosubstituted derivative. The<br>
monosubstituted derivative is preferred. A large excess of the<br>
aldehyde favors the formation of disubstituted and<br>
trisubstituted derivatives of the formula II compounds. The<br><br>
disubstituted derivatives are the derivatives where a hydrogen<br>
atom at two of the locations selected from the amino group at<br>
position R3, and the amino group of the amino sugars designated<br>
as R or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the reduced aldehyde<br>
moiety. The trisubstituted derivatives are the derivatives<br>
where a hydrogen atom at three of the locations selected from<br>
the amino group at position R3, and the amino group of the amino<br>
sugars designated as R or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the<br>
reduced aldehyde moiety.<br>
Examples of compounds that have been prepared and are<br>
illustrative of the formula I compounds are listed in Tables 2A<br>
and 2B. Table 2A lists compounds prepared by reacting an<br>
aldehyde with the glycopeptide A82846B. Table 2A lists the<br>
sidechain substitutions on the amino group of the 4-epi-<br>
vancosaminyl sugar of the 4-epi-vancosaminyl-O-glycosyl<br>
disaccharide of the A82846B compound. All of the compounds<br>
listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br>
Table 2B lists those compounds that were prepared by<br>
reacting an aldehyde with a variety of glycopeptide antibiotics<br>
other than A82846B. The compounds of Table 2B are<br>
monosubstituted at the amino group of the amino sugar designated<br>
as R1 in formula II with the sidechain listed. All of the<br>
compounds listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br><br>
iisubstituted derivatives are the derivatives where a hydrogen<br>
atom at two of the locations selected from the amino group at<br>
position R3 and the amino group of the amino sugars designated<br>
as R or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the reduced aldehyde<br>
moiety. The trisubstituted derivatives are the derivatives<br>
where a hydrogen atom at three cf the locations selected from<br>
the amino group at position R3, and the amino group of the amino<br>
sugars designated as P. or R1 in formula II, are replaced by the<br>
reduced aldehyde moiety.<br>
Examples of compounds that have been prepared and are<br>
illustrative of the formula I compounds are listed in Tables 2A<br>
and 2B. Table 2A lists compounds prepared by reacting an<br>
aldehyde with the glycopeptide A82846B. Table 2A lists the<br>
sidechain substitutions on the amino group of the 4-epi-<br>
vancosaminyl sugar of the 4-epi-vancosaminyl-O-giycosyi<br>
disaccharide of the A82846B compound. All of the compounds<br>
listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br>
Table 2B lists those compounds that were prepared by<br>
reacting an aldehyde with a variety of giycopeptide antibiotics<br>
other than A8284 6B. The compounds of Table 23 are<br>
monosubstituted at the amino group of the amino sugar designated<br>
as R1 in formula II with the sidechain listed. All of the<br>
compounds listed are monosubstituted derivatives.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The formula X compounds have in vitro and in vivo activity<br>
against Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. The minimal<br>
inhibitory concentrations (MIC) at which the formula I compounds<br>
inhibit certain bacteria are given in Table 3. The MIC's were<br>
determined using a standard broth micro-dilution assay.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The formula I compounds have also shown in vivo<br>
antimicrobial activity against experimentally-induced infections<br>
in laboratory animals. When two doses of test compound were<br>
administered to mice experimentally infected with the test<br>
organism, the activity observed was measured as an ED50 value<br>
(effective dose in mg/kg to protect 50% of the test animals: see<br>
W. Wick et al., J. Bacteriol. 81, 233-235 (1961)). ED50 values<br>
observed for illustrative compounds are given in Table 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
One important aspect of the antimicrobial activity of many<br>
of the formula I compounds is their activity against vancomycin-<br>
resistant enterococci. This activity is illustrated in Table 5,<br>
which summarizes a comparison of the activity of illustrative<br>
compounds against representative vancomycin-resistant and<br>
vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (Enterococcus faecium and<br>
Enterococcus faecalis, mean geometric MIC (mcg/mL)), as<br>
determined using the standard broth micro-dilution assay. End<br>
points were read after 24-hour incubation. Modification of the<br>
amino sugar of the disaccharide moiety provides improved<br>
activity against vancomycin-resistant strains over the parent<br>
glycopeptide antibiotic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A number of the lactic acid bacteria including all<br>
Leuconostocs, all Pediococci, and some Lactobacilli, are<br>
intrinsically resistant to vancomycin. With the increased use<br>
of vancomycin, infections due to these bacteria have been<br>
reported with increasing frequency in immunocompromised patients<br>
(Handwerger et al., Reviews of Infectious Disease 12:602-610<br>
(1990); Ruoff et al., Journal of Clinical Microbiology 26:2064-<br>
2068 (1988)). One important aspect of the antimicrobial<br>
activity of the formula I. compounds is their activity against<br>
the vancomycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria. The compounds of<br>
the present are useful in inhibiting the growth of vancomycin-<br>
resistant lactic bacteria such as Leuconostoc, Pedicocci, and<br>
Lactobacilli and thus, controlling opportunistic infections by<br>
this group of bacteria. This activity is illustrated in Table<br>
6, which summarizes a comparison of the activity of illustrative<br>
compounds against representative vancomycin-resistant lactic<br>
acid bacteria (Pedicoccus acidilacti Pedicoccus pentosaceus,<br>
Leuconostoc lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc<br>
pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, and Lactobacillus<br>
confusus, mean geometric MIC (mcg/mL)), as determined using a<br>
standard agar dilution assay on brain-heart infusion agar.<br><br><br><br><br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the formula I compounds are<br>
also part of this invention. Thus, the compound, preferably in<br>
the form of a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt, can be<br>
formulated for oral or parenteral administration for the<br>
therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of bacterial infections.<br>
For example, the compound can be admixed with conventional<br>
pharmaceutical carriers and excipients and used in the form of<br>
tablets, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the<br>
like. The compositions comprising a formula I compound will<br>
contain from about 0.1 to about 90% by weight of the active<br>
compound, and more generally from about 10 to about 3 0%. The<br>
compositions may contain common carriers and excipients, such as<br>
corn starch or gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium<br>
chloride, and alginic acid.<br>
Disintegrators commonly used in the formulations of this<br>
invention include croscarmellose, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
corn starch, sodium starch glycolate and alginic acid.<br>
Tablet binders that can be included are acacia,<br>
methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, poly-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,<br>
sucrose, starch and ethylcellulose.<br>
Lubricants that can be used include magnesium stearate or<br>
other metallic stearates, stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc,<br>
waxes, oils and colloidal silica.<br>
Flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen,<br>
cherry flavoring or the like can also be used.<br>
It may be desirable to add a coloring agent to make the<br>
dosage form more attractive in appearance or to help identify<br>
the product.<br>
For intravenous (IV) use, a water soluble form of the<br>
antibiotic can be dissolved in one of the commonly used<br>
intravenous fluids and administered by infusion. Such fluids<br>
as, for example, physiological saline, Ringer's solution, or 5%<br>
dextrose solution can be used.<br>
For intramuscular preparations, a sterile formulation of a<br>
suitable soluble salt form of the compound, for example the<br>
hydrochloride salt, can be dissolved and administered in a<br><br>
pharmaceutical diluent such as pyrogen-free water (distilled),<br>
physiological saline or 5% glucose solution. A suitable<br>
insoluble form of the compound may be prepared and administered<br>
as a suspension in an aqueous base or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable oil base, for example, an ester of a long chain fatty<br>
acid such as ethyl oleate.<br>
For oral use, a sterile formulation of a suitable salt form<br>
of the antibiotic, for example, the hydrochloride salt,<br>
formulated in a diluent such as distilled or deionized water, is<br>
particularly useful.<br>
Alternatively, the unit dosage form of the antibiotic can<br>
be a solution of the antibiotic, preferably in its salt form, in<br>
a suitable diluent in sterile, hermetically sealed ampoules.<br>
The concentration of the antibiotic in the unit dosage may vary,<br>
for example, from about 1 percent to about 5 0 percent depending<br>
on the particular form of the antibiotic and its solubility and<br>
the dose desired by the physician.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention provides a method for<br>
treating infectious diseases, especially those caused by Gram-<br>
positive microorganisms, in animals. The compounds of this<br>
invention are particularly useful in treating infections caused<br>
by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Also, the compounds are<br>
useful in treating infection due to enterococci. Examples of<br>
such diseases are severe staphylococcal infections, for example,<br>
staphylococcal endocarditis and staphylococcal septicemia. The<br>
animal may be either susceptible to, or infected with, the<br>
microorganism. The method comprises administering to the animal<br>
an amount of a formula I. compound which is effective for this<br>
purpose. In general, an effective amount of a formula I.<br>
compound is a dose between about 0.5 and about 100 mg/kg. A<br>
preferred dose is from about 1 to about 60 mg/kg of active<br>
compound. A typical daily dose for an adult human is from about<br>
50 mg to about 5 g.<br>
In practicing this method, the antibiotic can be<br>
administered in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per<br>
day. The treatment regimen may require administration over<br>
extended periods of time, for example, for several days or for<br>
from one to six weeks. The amount per administered dose or the<br><br>
total amount administered will depend on such factors as the<br>
nature and severity of the infection, the age and general health<br>
of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the antibiotic<br>
and the microorganism or microorganisms involved in the<br>
infection.<br>
A convenient method of practicing the treatment method is<br>
to administer the antibiotic via intravenous infusion. In this<br>
procedure a sterile formulation of a suitable soluble salt of<br>
the antibiotic is incorporated in a physiological fluid, such as<br>
5% dextrose solution, and the resulting solution is infused<br>
slowly IV. Alternatively, the piggy-back method of IV infusion<br>
can also be used.<br>
In order to illustrate more fully the operation of this<br>
invention, the following examples are provided, but are not to<br>
be construed as a limitation on the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
METHOD A<br>
Preparation of Compound 2<br>
A mixture of A82846B•triacetate, (2.25 g, 1.27 mmol, 1.0<br>
equivalents (eq)) in 1:1 DMF/methanol (140 mL) under an<br>
atmosphere of argon was treated with 4-biphenylcarboxaldehyde<br>
(331 mg, 2.12 mmol, 1.7 eq). The resulting mixture was heated<br>
to 70°C and maintained as such for 1.75-2 hours. The solution<br>
was then treated with sodium cyanoborohydride (554 mg, 8.83<br>
mmol, 6.9 eq). Heating at 70°C was continued for an additional<br>
1.75-2 hours after which the reaction mixture was cooled to room<br>
temperature, concentrated in vacuo, diluted with water (150 mL),<br>
and lyophilized to give a solid.<br>
The solid was purified by preparative reverse-phase high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters 3 x (40<br>
x 100.mm) C18 Nova-Pak cartridge with Waters C18 Nova-pak guard<br>
insert and utilizing TEAP buffer system. The analytical method<br>
for analysis was: 0.2% TEA/phosphoric acid (TEAP), pH = 3, the<br><br>
gradient system at time 0 was 5% CH3CN/94.8% H2O with 0.2% TEAP<br>
held constant and at 20 minutes was 60% CH3CN/3 9.8% H2O with<br>
0.2% TEAP held constant. The UV wavelength used was 235 ran and<br>
the flow rate was 2 ml/minute. Analysis was done using a Waters<br>
Nova-pak C18 RCM column (8 X 100mm) with a Nova-pak C18 guard<br>
insert. It is necessary to desalt the product after reverse<br>
phase purification when this HPLC method is used.<br>
Desalting was accomplished by adding the purified product<br>
to 5-10 ml of H2O. 1 N HC1 was added dropwise with stirring to<br>
dissolve the sample. The pH at this point was approximately 1-<br>
3. The pH of the solution was then raised to 8.2 with 1 N NaOH.<br>
A white solid precipitated out of solution. The mixture was<br>
cooled, filtered, and dried under vacuum at room temperature for<br>
8-15 hours to give the zwitter ion (or neutral compound) of the<br>
desired product, compound 2 (p-phenylbenzyl•A82846B), (1.02 g,<br>
45%) .<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of Compound 4<br>
A mixture of A82846B-triacetate (1.5 g, 0.848 mmol, 1.0 eq)<br>
in methanol (100 mL) under an atmosphere of argon was treated<br>
with p-phenoxybenzaldehyde (298 mg, 1.51 mmol, 1.8 eq). The<br>
resulting mixture was heated to reflux and maintained as such<br>
for 2 hours. The solution was then treated with sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride (326 mg, 5.18 mmol, 6.1 eq). Heating at reflux<br>
was continued for an additional 2 hours after which the reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to room temperature and evaporated to dryness<br>
in vacuo.<br>
The product was purified by reverse-phase HPLC with a TFA<br>
buffer. The analytical method for analysis was accomplished by<br>
using a Waters Nova-pak C18 RCM column (8 x 100 mm) with a Nova-<br>
pak C18 guard insert, eluting with a 2.0 ml/minute linear<br>
gradient of 15% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA at time zero to 80%<br>
acetonitrile/0.1% TFA at 15 minutes. The fractions containing<br>
the products were detected by ultraviolet scan at 235 nm. The<br>
organic solvent of the desired fractions was removed and the<br><br>
mixture was lyophilized to a white solid to give 0.618 mg of p-<br>
phenoxybenzyl-A82846B compound 4•tris(trifluroacetate) salt (20%<br>
yield). No desalting or further purification was necessary.<br>
This method is also especially useful in the preparation of<br>
Compound 2 wherein phenylbenzaldehyde is one of the starting<br>
materials.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Method B<br>
Preparation of Compound 176<br>
A mixture of A82846B•triacetate (280 mg, 0.157 mmol, 1.0<br>
eq) in 1:1 DMF/methanol (30 mL) was treated with 8-phenyloctanal<br>
(59 mg, 0.2 9 mmol, 1.8 eq) and sodium cyanoborohydride (60 mg,<br>
0.95 mmol, 6.1 eq). The resulting mixture was heated, under an<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen, to 70°C and maintained as such for 1<br>
hour. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature<br>
and concentrated in vacuo to give a residue. Purification of<br>
the product was accomplished by reverse-phase preparative HPLC<br>
utilizing a Waters 2 x (40 x 100 mm) C18 Nova-Pak cartridge with<br>
Waters C18 Nova-Pak guard insert. Elution was accomplished with<br>
a 30 minute linear gradient (time=0 minutes 95% TEAP (0.5%<br>
aqueous triethylamine adjusted to pH=3 with phosphoric acid)/5%<br>
CH3CN to t = 30 minutes 20% TEAP/80% CH3CN) with a flow rate of<br>
40 mL/minute and UV detection at 280 nm. The desired fraction<br>
was concentrated in vacuo then desalted with a Waters Sep-Pak<br>
cartridge as described below. This afforded compound 176 in 22%<br>
yield (60 mg).<br>
The resulting compound was desalted as follows. A Waters<br>
Sep-Pak cartridge was pre-wet with methanol (2-3 column volumes)<br>
then conditioned with water (2-3 column volumes). The sample,<br>
dissolved in a minimum volume of water, was loaded onto the Sep-<br>
Pak column which was then washed with water (2-3 column volumes)<br>
to remove the unwanted salts. The product was then eluted with<br>
an appropriate solvent system, typically 1:1 CH3CN/H2O, CH3CN,<br>
and/or methanol. The organic solvent component was removed in<br><br>
vacuo and the resulting aqueous solution lyophilized to give the<br>
final product.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of Compound 229<br>
A three liter 3-necked flask was fitted with a condenser,<br>
nitrogen inlet and overhead mechanical stirring apparatus. The<br>
flask was charged with pulverized A82846B acetate salt (20.0 g,<br>
1.21 x 10-3 mol) and methanol (1000 mL) under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. 4'-chlorobiphenylcarboxaldehyde (2.88 g, 1.33 x 10-<br>
2 mol, 1.1 eq.) was added to this stirred mixture, followed by<br>
methanol (500 mL). Finally, sodium cyanoborohydride (0.84 g,<br>
1.33 x 10-2 mol, 1.1 eq.) was added followed by methanol (500<br>
mL). The resulting mixture was heated to reflux (about 65°C).<br>
After 1 hour at reflux, the reaction mixture attained<br>
homogeneity. After 25 hours at reflux, the heat source was<br>
removed and the clear reaction mixture was measured with a pH<br>
meter (6.97 at 58.0°C). 1 N NaOH (22.8 mL) was added dropwise<br>
to adjust the pH to 9.0 (at 54.7°C). The flask was equipped<br>
with a distillation head and the mixture was concentrated under<br>
partial vacuum to a weight of 322.3 grams while maintaining the<br>
pot temperature between 40-45°C.<br>
The distillation head was replaced with an addition funnel<br>
containing 500 mL of isopropanol (IPA). The IPA was added<br>
dropwise to the room temperature solution over 1 hour. After<br>
approximately 1/3 of the IPA was added, a granular precipitate<br>
formed. The remaining IPA was added at a faster rate after<br>
precipitation had commenced. The flask was weighed and found to<br>
hold 714.4 grams of the IPA/methanol slurry.<br>
The flask was re-equipped with a still-head and distilled<br>
under partial vacuum to remove the remaining methanol. The<br>
resulting slurry (377.8 g) was allowed to chill in the freezer<br>
overnight. The crude product was filtered through a<br>
polypropylene pad and rinsed twice with 25 mL of cold IPA.<br>
After pulling dry on the funnel for 5 minutes, the material was<br>
placed in the vacuum oven to dry at 40°C. A light pink solid<br><br>
(22.87 g (theory = 22.43 g)) was recovered. HPLC analysis<br>
versus a standard indicated 68.0% weight percent of Compound 229<br>
(4-[4-chlorophenyl]benzyl-A82846B] in the crude solid, which<br>
translated into a corrected crude yield of 69.3%.<br>
The products of the reaction were analyzed by reverse-phase<br>
HPLC utilizing a Zorbax SB-C18 column with ultraviolet light<br>
(UV; 230 nm) detection. A 20 minute gradient solvent system<br>
consisting of 95% aqueous buffer/5% CH3CN at time=0 minutes to<br>
40% aqueous buffer/60% CH3CN at time=20 minutes was used, where<br>
the aqueous buffer was TEAP (5 ml CH3CN, 3 ml phosphoric acid in<br>
1000 ml water).<br>
