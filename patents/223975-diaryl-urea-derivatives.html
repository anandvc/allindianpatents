Background of the Invention<br>
Protein kinases (PKs) are enzymes which catalyze the phosphorylation of specific serine, threonine or tyrosine residues in cellular proteins. These post-translational modifications o\ substrate proteins act as molecular switch regulating cell proliferation, activation and/or differentiation. Aberrant or excessive PK activity has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative disorders. In many cases, it has been possible to treat diseases in vitro and in many cases in vivo, such as proliferative disorders, by making use of PK inhibitors.<br>
In view of the large number of protein kinase inhibitors and the multitude of proliferative and other PK-related diseases, there is an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as PK inhibitors and thus in the treatment of these PTK related diseases. What is required are new classes of pharmaceutical^ advantageous PK inhibiting compounds.<br>
General Description of the Invention<br>
It has now been found that various compounds of the diaryi urea derivative class show inhibition of a number of protein tyrosine kinases. Among the advantages, a good bioavailability and, especially where substituents at the ring with A and A' in formula ! or I* given below are present, lower accessibility to metabolism are to be mentioned. The compounds of formula I or I*, described below in more detail, especially show inhibition of one or more of the<br><br>
following protein tyrosine kinases: c-Abl, Bcr-Abi, the receptor tyrosine kinases Fit3, VEGF-R or c-Kit, as we!! as combinations of tow or mora of these; in the case c" novel clian/i urea derivatives according to the invention, the compounds are appropriate *or the inhibition of these and'or other protein tyrosine kineses, especially those mentioned above and/or, in addition, the non-receptor tyros'ne kinase Rah and/or for the inhibition :f mutants of these enzymes, especially of Bcr-A::'. 'or example tne G!u255 -&gt; Lysine mutant, in view of these activities, the compounds can be used for the treatment of diseases re eted to esoeciaiiy aberrant or excessive activity o* such types of kinases, especially those mentioned.<br>

The general terms used hereinbefore and hereinafter preferably have, within this disclosure, the following meanings, unless otherwise indicated:<br>
The prefix "lower" denotes a radical having 1 up to and including a maximum of 7, especially 1 up to and including a maximum of 4 carbon atoms, the radicals in question being either linear or branched with single or multiple branching. Lower alkyl, for example, is methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, sec-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl or n-heptyl.<br>
Where the plural form is used for compounds, salts, pharmaceutical preparations, diseases and the like, this is intended to mean also a single compound, salt, or the like.<br>
Halo(geno) is preferably iodo, bromo, chloro or fluoro, especially fluoro, chloro or bromo.<br>
In view of the close relationship between the diaryl urea derivatives in free form and in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in<br><br>
the purification or identification of the novel compounds, tautomers or tautomeric mixtures and their salts, any reference hereinbefore and hereinafter to these compounds, especially the compounds of the formula I or I*, is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding tautomers of these compounds, especially of compounds of the formula I or 1*, tautomeric mixtures of these compounds, especially of compounds of the formula I or I*, or salts of any of these, as appropriate and expedient and if not mentioned otherwise. Tautomers can, e.g., be present in cases where amino or hydroxy, each with a least one bound hydrogen, are boundlo carbon atoms that are bound to adjacent atoms by double bonds (e.g. keto-enol or imine-enamine tautoemerism). Preferred tautomers are the pyridin-on-yl or pyrimidin-on-yl forms of compounds wherein R* is hydroxy and the other moieties are defined as for compounds of the formula I or I*, respectively.<br>
Where "a compound ..., a tautomer thereof; or a salt thereof or the like is mentioned, this means "a compound ..., a tautomer thereof, or a salt of the compound or the tautomer".<br>
Any asymmetric carbon atom may be present in the (R)-, (S)- or (Reconfiguration, preferably in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Substituents at a ring at atoms with saturated bonds may, if possible, be present in cis- (= Z-) or trans (= E-) form. The compounds may thus be present as mixtures of isomers or preferably as pure isomers, preferably as enantiomer-pure diastereomers or pure enantiomers.<br>
Salts are preferably the pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts of the diary! urea derivatives, especially of compounds of the formula I or I* if they are carrying salt-forming groups.<br>
Salt-forming groups are groups or radicals having basic or acidic properties. Compounds having at least one basic group or at least one basic radical, for example amino, a secondary amino group not forming a peptide bond or a pyridyl radical, may form acid addition salts, for example with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or a phosphoric acid, or with suitable organic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, for example aliphatic mono- or di-carbo-xylic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, hydroxymaleic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid or oxalic acid, or amino acids such as arginine or lysine, aromatic carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, 2-phenoxy-benzoic acid, 2-acetoxy-benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, aromatic-aliphatic carboxylic acids, such as mandelic acid or cinnamic acid, hetero-<br><br>
aromatic carboxylic acids, such as nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid, aliphatic sulfonic acids, such as methane-, ethane- or 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, or aromatic sulfonic acids, for example benzene-, p-toluene- or naphthaIene-2-sulfonic acid. When several basic groups are present mono- or poly-acid addition salts may be formed.<br>
Compounds having acidic groups, a carboxy group or a phenolic hydroxy group, may form metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, or ammonium salts with ammonia or suitable organic amines, such as tertiary monoamines, for example triethylamine or tri-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-amine, or heterocyclic bases, for example /V-ethyl-piperidine or A/t/V-dimethylpiper-azine. Mixtures of salts are possible.<br>
Compounds having both acidic and basic groups can form internal salts.<br>
For the purposes of isolation or purification, as well as in the case of compounds that are used further as intermediates, it is also possible to use pharmaceutical^ unacceptable salts, e.g. the picrates. Only pharmaceutical acceptable, non-toxic salts may be used for therapeutic purposes, however, and those salts are therefore preferred.<br>
An organic moiety R is preferably unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted alkenyl, unsubstituted or substituted aikynyl, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclyl, unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl or unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkenyl; preferred is unsubstituted alkyl.<br>
"Substituted", whereever used for a moiety, means that one or more hydrogen atoms in the respective moiety, especially up to 5, more especially up to three, of the hydrogen atoms are replaced independently of each other by the corresponding number of substituents which preferably are independently selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, for example methyl, ethyl or propyl, halo-lower alkyl, for example trifluoromethyl, C6-C16-aryl, especially phenyl or naphthyl (where C6-C16-aryl, especially phenyl or napthyl, is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, especially up to three moieties selected from halogen, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, phenyl-Iower alkoxy, lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkanoyl, amino, N-lower alkylamino, N,N-di-lower alkylamino, N-phenyl-lower alkylamino, N,N-bis(phenyl-lower alkyl)-amino, lower alkanoylamino, halo, halo-lower alkyl, e.g. trifluoro-<br><br>

The efficacy of the compounds cf the invention as inhibitors of c-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated as follows:<br>
An in vitro enzyme assay is performed in 96-well plates as a filter binding assay as described by Geissler et al. in Cancer Res. 1992; 52:4492-4498, with the following modifications. The His-tagged kinase domain of c-Abl is cloned and expressed in the bacu!oyirus/Sf9 system as described by Bhat et al. in J.Biol.Chem. 1997; 272:16170-16175. A protein of 37 kD (c-Abl kinase) is purified by a two-step procedure over a Cobalt metal chelate column followed by an anion exchange column with a yield of 1-2 mg/L of Sf9 cells (Bhat et a/., reference cited). The purity of the c-Abl kinase is &gt;90% as judged by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie blue staining. The assay contains (total volume of 30 pL): c-Abl kinase (50 ng), 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCI2&gt; 10 pM Na3V04, 1 mM DTT and 0.06 pCi/assay [y33 P]-ATP (5 pM ATP) using 30 pg/mL poly-A!a,Glu,Lys,Tyr-6:2:5:1 (Poly-AEKY, Sigma P1152) in the presence of 1 % DMSO. Reactions are terminated by adding 10 pL of 250 mM EDTA and 30 pL of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with water, then soaked for 5 min with 0.5 % H3PO4 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 pL 0.5 % H3PO4. Membranes are removed and washed on a shaker with 0.5 % H3PO4 (4 times) and once with ethanol. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-well frame, and addition of 10 pL/well of Microscint TM (Packard). Using this test system, compounds of the formula I or I* show IC50 values of inhibition in the range of 0.001 to 100 uM, usually between 0.05 and 5 ^M.<br><br>
The inhibition of VEGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation can be confirmed with a further in vitro experiments in ceils such as transfected CHO cells, which permanently express human VEGF-R2 receptor (KDR), are seeded in complete culture medium (with 10% fetal calf serum = FCS) in 6-well cell-culture plates and incubated at 37QC under 5% C02 until they show about 80% confluency. The compounds to be tested are then diluted in culture medium (without FCS, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and added to the cells. (Controls comprise medium without test compounds). After two hours of incubation at 37°C, recombinant VEGF is added; the final VEGF concentration is 20 ng/rnl. After a further five minutes incubation at 37°C, the cells are washed twice with ice-cold PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and immediately lysed in 100 pi lysis buffer per well. The lysates are then centrifuged to remove the cell nuclei, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants are determined using a commercial protein assay (BIORAD). The lysates can then either be immediately used or, if necessary, stored at -20°C.<br>
A sandwich ELISA is carried out to measure the VEGF-R2 phosphorylation: a monoclonal antibody to VEGF-R2 (for example Mab 1495.12.14; prepared by H. Towbin, Novartis or comparable monoclonal antibody) is immobilized on black ELISA plates (OptiPlate™ HTRF-96 from Packard). The plates are then washed and the remaining free protein-binding sites are saturated with 3% TopBlock® (Juro, Cat. # TB232010) in phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20® (polyoxyethylen(20)sorbitane monolaurate, ICI/Uniquema) (PBST). The cell lysates (20 pg protein per well) are then incubated in these plates overnight at 4°C together with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (PY20:AP from Zymed). The (plates are washed again and the) binding of the antiphosphotyrosine antibody to the captured phosphorylated receptor is then demonstrated using a luminescent AP substrate (CDP-Star, ready to use, with Emerald II; Applied Biosystems). The luminescence is measured in a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter. The difference between the signal of the positive control (stimulated with VEGF) and that of the negative control (not stimulated with VEGF) corresponds to VEGF-induced VEGF-R2 phosphorylation (= 100 %). The activity of the tested substances is calculated as percent inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGF-R2 phosphorylation, wherein the concentration of substance that induces half the maximum inhibition is defined as the IC50 (inhibitory dose for 50% inhibition). Compounds of the formula I or I* here show an IC5Q in the range of 0.0003 to 20 jiM, preferably between 0.001 and10 jiM.<br><br>
In analogy, VEGF-R1 inhibition can be shown as follows: The test is conducted using Flt-1 VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. The detailed procedure is as follows: 30 jJ kinase solution (10 ng of the kinase domain of Flt-1, Shibuya et al., Oncogene 5, 519-24 (1990)) in 20 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 3 mM manganese dichloride (MnCI2), 3 mM magnesium chloride (MgCI2), 10 mM sodium vanadate, 0.25 mg/ml polyethylenglycol (PEG) 20 000, 1 mM dithiothrettol and 3 ^g/ml poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 8 jaM [33P]-ATP (0.2 uCi), 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0 to 100 nM of the compound of formula I or I* to be tested are incubated together for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction is then terminated by the addition of 10 jJ 0.25 M ethyienediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) pH 7. Using a multichannel dispenser (LAB SYSTEMS, USA), an aliquot of 20 yi\ is applied to a PVDF (= polyvinyl difluoride) Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, USA), through a Millipore microtiter filter manifold and connected to a vacuum. Following complete elimination of the liquid, the membrane is washed 4 times successively in a bath containing 0.5 % phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and once with ethanol, incubated for 10 min each while shaking, then mounted in a Hewlett Packard TopCount Manifold and the radioactivity measured after the addition of 10 j.il Microscint® (p-scinitillation counter liquid). IC50 values are determined by linear regression analysis of the percentages of inhibition of each compound in three conditions (as a rule 0.01, 0.1 and 1 (amol). The IC50 values that can be found with compounds of the formula I or I* are in the range of 0.01 to 100 jiM, preferably in the range from 0.01 to 50 jiM.<br>
Flt3 kinase inhibition is determined as follows: The baculovirus donor vector pFbacGOl (GIBCO) is used to generate a recombinant baculovirus expressing the amino acid region amino acids 563-993 of the cytoplasmic kinase domain of human Flt-3. The coding sequence for the cytoplasmic domain of Flt-3 is amplified by PCR from human c-DNA libraries (Clontech). The amplified DNA fragments and the pFbacGOl vector are made compatible for ligation by digestion with BamH1 and Hindlll. Ligation of these DNA fragments results in the baculovirus donor plasmid Flt-3(1.1). The production of the viruses, the expression of proteins in Sf9 cells and the purification of the GST-fused proteins are performed as follows: Production of virus: Transfer vector (pFbacG01-Flt-3) containing the Flt-3 kinase domain is transfected into the DHIOBac cell line (GIBCO) and the transfected cells are plated on selective agar plates. Colonies without insertion of the fusion sequence into the viral genome (carried by the bacteria) are blue. Single white colonies are picked and viral DNA (bacmid) is isolated from the bacteria by standard plasmid purification procedures. Sf9 or Sf21 cells (Ameri-<br><br>
can Type Culture Collection) are then transfected in flasks with the viral DNA using Cellfectin reagent.<br>
Determination of small scale protein expression in Sf9 cells: Virus containing media is collected from the transfected cell culture and used for infection to increase its titre. Virus containing media obtained after two rounds of infection is used for large-scale protein expression. For large-scale protein expression 100 cm2 round tissue culture plates are seeded with 5 x 107 cells/plate and infected with 1 mL of virus-containing media (apprcx. 5 MOIs). After 3 days the cells are scraped off the plate and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets from 10-20, 100 cm2 plates, are resuspended in 50 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mMTris-HCI, pH 7.5, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). The cells are stirred on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 5000 rpms for 20 min.<br>
Purification of GST-tagged proteins: The centrifuged cell lysate is loaded onto a 2 mL gluta-thione-sepharose column (Pharmacia) and washed three times with 10 mL of 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 200 mM NaCI. The GST-tagged protein is then eluted by 10 applications (1 mL each) of 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM reduced-glutathione, 100 mM NaCI, 1 mM DTT, 10 % Glycerol and stored at -70°C.<br>
Measurement of enzyme activity. Tyrosine protein kinase assays with purified GST-Flt-3 are carried out in a final volume of 30 JIL containing 200-1800 ng of enzyme protein (depending on the specific activity), 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, 3 mM MnCI2l 3 mM MgCI2, 1 mM DTT, 10 HM Na3V04, 3 ^g/mL poly(Glu.Tyr) 4:1, 1 % DMSO, 8.0 yM ATP and 0.1 \xC\ [y33 P] ATP). The activity is assayed in the presence or absence of inhibitors, by measuring the incorporation of 33P from [y33P] ATP into the poly(Glu,Tyr) substrate. The assay (30 yL) is carried out in 96-well plates at ambient temperature for 20 min under conditions described below and terminated by the addition of 20 i± of 125 mM EDTA. Subsequently, 40 JIL of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with water, then soaked for 5 min with 0.5 % H3PO4 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 jiL 0.5 % H3P04. Membranes are removed and washed 4 x on a shaker with 1.0 % H3PO4, once with ethanol. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-well frame, and addition of 10 jiLVwell of Microscint TM (Packard). IC5o values are calculated by linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition of each compound in duplicate, at four concentrations (usually 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 JIM). One unit of protein kinase activity is defined as 1 nmole of 33P ATP transferred from [y33P] ATP to the substrate protein per minute<br><br>
per mg of protein at 37 °C. The compounds of the formula I or I* here show IC50 values in the range between 0.005 and 20 jiM, preferably between 0.01 and 10 j.iM.<br>
Bcr-Abl inhibition can be determined by a capture ELISA as follows: Tne murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3 transfected with the p210 Bcr-Abl expression vector pGDp210Bcr/AbI (32D-bcr/abl) is obtained from J Griffin (Bazzoni et alM J. Clin invest. 98, 521-8 (1996); Zhao et al., Blood 90, 4687-9 (1997)). The cells express the fusion bcr-abl protein with a constitutively active abl kinase and proliferate growth factor-independent. The cells are expanded in RPMI 1640 (AMIMED; cat# 1-41F01), 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine (Gibco) ("complete medium"), and a working stock is prepared by freezing aliquots of 2 x 106 cells per vial in freezing medium (95 % fetal calf serum, 5 % dimethylsulfoxide (SIGMA, D-2650). After thawing, the cells are used during maximally 10-12 passages for the experiments. The antibody anti-abl SH3 domain cat. # 06-466 from Upstate Biotechnology is used for the ELISA. For detection of bcr-abl phosphorylation, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody Ab PY20, labelled with alkaline phosphatase (PY10(AP)) from ZYMED (cat. # 03-7722) is used. As comparison and reference compound, (N-{5-[4-(4-methyl-piperazino-me-thyl)-benzoylamido]-2-methylpheny!}-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine-amine, in the form of the methane sulfonate (monomesylate) salt (STI571) (marketed as Gleevec® or Glivec®, Novartis), is used. A stock solution of 10 mM is prepared in DMSO and stored at -20 °C. For the cellular assays, the stock solution is diluted in complete medium in two steps (1 : 100 and 1 : 10) to yield a starting concentration of 10 ^M followed by preparation of serial threefold dilutions in complete medium. No solubility problems are encountered using this procedure. The test compounds of formula I or I* are treated analogously. For the assay, 200'000 32D-bcr/abl cells in 50 nl are seeded per well in 96 well round bottom tissue culture plates. 50 jal per well of serial threefold dilutions of the test compoun are added to the cells in triplicates. The final concentration of the test compound range e.g. from 5 |xM down to 0.01 jiM. Untreated cells are used as control. The compound is incubated together with the cells for 90 min at 37 °C, 5 % C02, followed by centrifugation of the tissue culture plates at 1300 rpm (Beckman GPR centrifuge) and removal of the supernatants by careful aspiration taking care not to remove any of the pelleted cells. The cell pellets are lysed by addition of 150 yd lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 % NP-40 (non-ionic detergent, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 2 mM sodium ortho-vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride, 50 jig/ml aprotinin and 80 jag/ml teupeptin) and either used immediately for the ELISA or stored frozen at -20 °C until usage.<br><br>
The anti-abl SH3 domain antibody is coated at 200 ng in 50 |J PBS per well to black ELISA plates (Packard HTRF-96 black plates; 6005207) overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3x with 200 jd/well PBS containing 0.05 % Tween 20 (PBST) and 0.5 % TopBlock (Juro, Cat. # TB 232010), residual protein binding sites are blocked with 200 |.i!/wei] PBST, 3 % TopBlock for 4 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 50 jil lysates of untreated or test compound-treated cells (20 jig total protein per well) for 3-4 h at 4 °C. After 3 x washing, 50 ji!/ well PY20(AP) (Zymed) diluted to 0.5 j.ig/ml in blocking buffer is added and incubated overnight (4 !C). For all incubation steps, the plates are covered with plate sealers (Costar, cat. # 3095). Finally, the plates are washed another three times with washing buffer and once with deionized water before addition of 90 jil/well of the AP substrate CPDStar RTU with Emerald II. The plates now sealed with Packard Top Seal™-A plate sealers (cat. # 6005185) are incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark and luminescence is quantified by measuring counts per second (CPS) with a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Top Count). For the final optimized version of the ELISA, 50 JA! of the lysates of the cells grown, treated and lysed in 96 well tissue culture plates, are transferred directyl from these plates to the ELISA plates that are precoated with 50 ng/well of the rabbit poylclonal ant-abl-SH3 domain AB 06-466 from Upstate. The concentration of the anti-phosphotyrosine AB PY20 (AP) can be reduced to 0.2 jag/ml. Washing, blocking and incubation with the luminescent substrate are as above. The quantification is achieved as follows: The difference between the ELISA readout (CPS) obtained for with the lysates of the untreated 32D-bcr/abI cells and the readout for the assay background (all components, but without cell lysate) is calculated and taken as 100 % reflecting the constitutively phosphorylated bcr-abl protein present in these cells. The activity of the compound in the bcr-abl kinase activity is expressed as percent reduction of the bcr-abl phosphorylation. The values for the IC50 are determined from the dose response curves by graphical inter- or extrapolation. The compounds of the formula I or I* here preferably show IC50 values in the range from 20 nM to 200 jaM.<br>
In addition to or instead of inhibiting the above-mentioned protein kinases, the compounds of formula I or I* also inhibit other tyrosine protein kinases that are involved in the signal transmission mediated by trophic factors, for example kinases of the src kinase family, such as especially the c-Src kinase, members of the PDGF receptor tyrosine protein kinase family, for example the PDGF receptor (PDGF-R), c-Kit, VEGF-R and/or FGF-R; all of which play a part in growth regulation and transformation in animal, especially mammal cells, including<br><br>
human cells. An appropriate assay is described in Andrejauskas-Buchdunger et al., Cancer Res. 52, 5353-8(1992).<br>
The diaryl urea derivatives useful according to the invention, especially compounds of formula I or r, that inhibit the protein kinase activities mentioned, especially tyrosine protein kinases mentioned above and below, can therefore be used in the treatment of protein kinase dependent diseases. Protein kinase dependent diseases are especially proliferative diseases, preferably benign or especially malignant tumours (for example carcinoma of the kidneys, liver, adrenal glands, bladder, breast, stomach, ovaries, colon, rectum, prostate, pancreas, bngs, vagina or thyroid, sarcoma, glioblastomas and numerous tumours of the neck and head, as well as leukemias). They are able to bring about the regression of tumours and to prevent the formation of tumour metastases and the growth of (also micro)-metastases. In addition they can be used in epidermal hyperproliferation (e.g. psoriasis), in prostate hyperplasia, and in the treatment of neoplasias, especially of epithelial character, for example mammary carcinoma. It is also possible to use the compounds of formula I or I* in the treatment of diseases of the immune system insofar as several or, especially, individual tyrosine protein kinases are involved; furthermore, the compounds of formula I or I* can be used also in the treatment of diseases of the central or peripheral nervous system where signal transmission by at least one tyrosine protein kinase, especially selected from those mentioned specifically, is involved.<br>
The p21ras oncogene is a major contributor to the development and progression of human solid cancers and is mutated in 30 % of all human cancers. The endogenous GTPase activity, if alleviated in ras mutated cancer cells, mediates constitutive growth signals to downstream effectors such as raf kinase. Inhibiting the raf kinase signalling pathway can therefore be used for inhibiting the effect of active ras. The diaryl urea derivatives useful according to the present invention, especially the compounds of formula I or I*, as ras inhibitors are thus especially appropriate for the therapy of diseases related to ras overexpression or overactivity.<br>
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2; KDR) is selectively expressed on the primary vascular endothelium and is essential for normal vascular development. In order to grow beyond minimal size, tumors must generate new vascular supply. Angiogenesis, or the sprouting of new blood vessels, is a central process in the growth of solid tumors. For<br><br>
many cancers, the extent of vascularization of a tumor is a negative prognostic indicator signifying aggressive disease and increased potential for metastasis. Recent efforts to understand the molecular basis of tumor-associated angiogenesis have identified several potential therapeutic targets, including the receptor tyrosine kinases for the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (see Zeng et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276(35), 32714-32719 (2001)). The diary! urea derivatives useful according to the present invention, especially the compounds of formula I or I*, as KDR inhibitors are thus especially appropriate for the therapy of diseases related to VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase overexpression. Among these diseases, especially retinopathies, age-related macula degeneration, psoriasis, haemangioblastoma, haemangioma, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid or rheumatic inflammatory diseases, especially arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic asthma, arterial or post-transplantational atherosclerosis, endometriosis, and especially neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumors (especially cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, the pancreas, breast, stomach, cervix, bladder, kidney, prostate, ovaries, endometrium, lung, brain, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma of heand and neck, malignant pleural mesotherioma, lymphoma or multiple myeloma) and liquid tumors (e.g. leukemias) are especially important.<br>
Flt3 (FMD-like tyrosine kinase) is especially expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and in progenitors of the lymphoid and myeloid series. Aberrant expression of the Flt3 gene has been documented in both adult and childhood leukemias including AML (acute myelogenous leukemia), AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AMUTMDS), ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia), CML (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which are therefore the preferred diseases to be treated with compounds of the formula I or l\ Activating mutations in Flt3 have been found in approximately 25 to 30 % of patients with AML. Thus there is accumulating evidence for the role of Flt3 in human leukemias, and the diaryl urea derivatives useful according to the invention, especially the compounds of the formula I or l*f as Flt3 inhibitors are especially of use in the therapy of this type of diseases (see Tse et al., Leukemia 15(7), 1001-1010 (2001); Tomoki et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 48 (Suppl. 1), S27-S30 (2001); Birkenkamp et al., Leukemia 15(12), 1923-1921 (2001); Kelly et al., Neoplasia 99(1), 310-318 (2002)).<br><br>
In chronic myelogeous leukemia (CML), a reciprocally balanced chromosomal translocation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produces the BCR-ABL hybrid gene. The latter encodes the oncogenic Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Whereas ABL encodes a tightly regulated protein tyrosine kinase, which plays a fundamental role in regulating cell proliferation, adherence and apoptosis, the BCR-ABL fusion gene encodes as constitutively activated kinase, which transforms HSCs to produce a phenotype exhibiting deregulated clonal proliferation, reduced capacity to adhere to the bone marrow stroma and a reduces apoptotic response to mutagenic stimuli, which enable it to accumulate progressively more malignant transformations. The resulting granulocytes fail to develop into mature lymphocytes and are released into the circulation, leading to a deficiency in the mature cells and increased susceptibility to infection. ATP-competitive inhibitors of Bcr-Abl have been described which prevent the kinase from activating mitogenic and anti-apoptotic pathways (e.g. P-3 kinase and STAT5), leading to the death of the BCR-ABL phenotype cells and thereby providing an effective therapy against CML. The diary! urea derivatives useful according to the present invention, especially the compounds of the formula I or I*, as Bcr-Abl inhibitors are thus especially appropriate for the therapy of diseases related to its overexpression, especially leukemias, such as leukemias, e.g. CML or ALL.<br>
Compounds of the formula I or I*, in view of their activity as PDGF receptor inhibitors, are also especially appropriate in the treatment of prolifeative diseases, especially small lung cancer, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, psoriasis, scleroderma or fibrosis.<br>
There are also experiments to demonstrate the antitumor activity of compounds of the formula i or I* in vivo: The in vivo antitumor activity is tested, for example, using breast carcinoma cell lines, such as the the human estrogen dependent breast carcinoma MCF-7 (ATCC: HTB22) or ZR-75-1 (ATCC: CRL1500), or the estrogen-independen breast carcinomas MDA-MB468 (ATCC: HTB132) or MDA-MB231 (ATCC: HTB26); colon carcinoma cell lines, such as the colon-carcinoma Colo 205 (ATCC: CCL222); glioblastoma cell lines, such as the glioblastomas U-87MG (ATCC: HTB14) or U-373MG (ATCC: HTB17); lung carcinoma cell lines, such as the "small cell lung carcinomas" NCI-H69 (ATCC: HTB119) or NCI-H209 (ATCC: HTB172), or the lung carcinoma NCI-H596 (ATCC: HTB178); skin tumor cell lines, such as the melanomas Hs294T (ATCC: HTB140) or A375 (ATCC: CRL1619); tumor cell lines from the genitourinry systems, such as the ovarial carcinoma NlH-Ovcar3 (ATCC: HTB161), as well as the prostate carzinomas DU145 (ATCC: HTB81) or<br><br>
PC-3 (ATCC: CRL1435), or the bladder carcinoma T24 (ATCC: HTB4); epithelial carcinomas, such as the epithelial carcinoma KB31; or (especially with regard to leukemias) K562 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Mannassas, VA) or human CFU-G cells (CFU-G stands for granulocyte colony forming unit, and it represents an early but commited granulocyte forming precursor cell that circulates in the blood stream or bone marrow) each of which is transplanted into female or male Balb/c nude mice. Other cell lines include leukemic cell lines such as K-562, SUPB15, MEG01, Ku812F, MOLM-13, BaF3, CEM/0, JURKAT/0 or U87MG.<br>
Tumors are obtained after subcutaneous injection of the respective cells (minimum 2 x 10s cells in 100 ml phosphate buffered physiological saline) into the carrier mice (e.g. 4-8 mice per cell line). The resulting tumors are passed serially through at least three subsequent transplantations before treatment is started. Tumor fragments (about 25 mg each) are injected s.c. into the left flank of the animals using a 13-gauge Trocar needle under Forene narcosis (Abbott, Switzerland) for implantation. Mice transplanted with estrogen-dependent tumor are, in addition, supplied with an estrogen pellet (1.0 cm of a tube with a quality appropriate for medical purposes, Dow Chemicals, with 5 mg estradiole, Sigma). The treatment is started routinely (that is at low or intermediate tumor burden), as soon as the tumor has reached an average size of 100 mm3. Tumor growth is determined once, twice or thrice weekly (depending on tumor growth of the cell line) and 24 h after the last treatment by measurement of the perpendicular diameter. In case of tumors, tumor volumes are determined according to the formula L x D x p/6 (see Evans, B.D., Smith, I.E., Shorthouse, A.J. and Millar, J.J., Brit J. Cancer, 45:466-468, 1982). The antitumor activity is expressed as T/C% (average increase of the tumor volume of treated animals divided by the average increase of tumor volume in control animals multiplied by 100). Tumor regression (%) represents the smallest mean tumor volume compared to the mean tumor volume at the beginning of the treatment. Each animal in which the tumor reaches a diameter of more than 1,5 to 2 cm3 is sacrificed. Leukemia burden is assessed by examining both peripheral white blood count and weight of spleen and thymus in animals tumored with leukemia cell lines.<br>
An exemplary (though not limiting) schedule for administration of a diaryl urea derivative, especially of formula I or I*, or a salt thereof, is daily administration, with preferably 1 to 3 daily dosages for a longer time, possibly until the disease is cured or, if only palliateive treatment is achieved, for as long as required; alternatively, treatment e.g. for 5 days, and/or admi-<br><br>
nistration at days 1, 4 and 9, with eventual repetition after a certain tine without treatment is possible. Alternatively, treatment several times a day (e.g. 2 to 5 times) or treatment by continuous administration (e.g. infusion), e.g. at the time points indicated in the last sentence, are possible. Generally, administration is orally or parenterally, preferably orally. The test compounds are preferably diluted in water or in sterile 0.9% saline.<br>
All human tumor cell lines are obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) if not indicated otherwise and are cultivated in the suggested media with the corresponding additives (ATCC culture conditions), if not mentioned otherwise. The c-sis- and v-sis- transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells are obtained from Dr. C, Stiles (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA). They are cultured in "Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium" (DMEM), that is supplemented with 10 % calf serum and Hygromycin B in a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml or G418 in a concentration of 0.5mg/ml.

The pharmacological activity of a diaryl urea derivative of the formula i or I* may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study or in a test procedure as essentially described hereinafter.<br>
Suitable clinical studies are, for example, open label non-randomized, dose escalation studies in patients with one of the tumor diseases mentioned above. The beneficial effects on proliferative diseases can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The efficacy of the treatment can be determined in such studies, e.g., in case of tumors after 18 or 24 weeks by radiologic evaluation of the tumors every 6 weeks, in case of a leukaemia e.g. by determination of the count of aberrant white blood cells, and by staining mononuclear cells and/or by means of determining minimum residual disease (MRD) e.g. by FACS-LPC MRD or PCR.<br>

where for all reactions mentioned functional groups in the starting materials that shall not take part in the reaction are, if required, present in protected form by readily removable protecting groups, and any protecting groups are subsequently removed.<br>
The following reaction conditions are preferred, respectively:<br>
Within the scope of this text, only a readily removable group that is not a constituent of the particular desired end product of formula I is designated a "protecting group", unless the context indicates otherwise. The protection of functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their cleavage reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third edition, Wiley, New York 1999, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Houben<br><br>
Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jeschkeit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" (Amino acids, Peptides, Proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate" {Chemistry of Carbohydrates: Monosaccharides and Derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974. A characteristic of protecting groups is that they can be removed readily (i.e. without the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions) for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or alternatively under physiological conditions (e.g. by enzymatic cleavage).<br>
A protecting group for an OH group, namely a tri-lower alkylsilyl group, such as tert-butyl-di-methylsilyl, can, for example, be removed in the presence of fluoride anions, e.g. by reaction with an appropriate ammonium fluoride, such as tert-butylammonium fluoride, or preferably with HF in the presence of a nitrogen base, especially pyridine, in an aprotic solvent, especially an ether, such as tetrahydrofurane, a nitrile, such as acetonitrile, or a mixture thereof, at temperatures between 0 and 50 °C, e.g. at room temperature.<br>
Reactions (a) and (d) preferably take place in an appropriate solvent, e.g. an ether, such as tetrahydrofurane (other solvents, such as toluene, may also be present, especially in low amounts), preferably at temperatures in the range from 0 to 50 °C, e.g. at room temperature.<br>
Reaction (b), that is, the formation of ethers, preferably takes place in the presence of a metal alcoholate, especially an alkali metal alcoholate, such as potassium tert-butylate, in an appropriate solvent, such as N,N'-dimethypropyIeneura or a di-Iower alkyl-lower alkanoyl-amide, such as dimethylformamide, or mixtures thereof, at preferred temperatures between 50 °C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, for example at 100 °C.<br>
The ether formation can also take place under the conditions of the Hartwig-Buchwald type etherification reactions (see e.g. Mann et a!., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121(13), 3224-5 (1999), or Aranyos et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 4369-78 (1999)).<br>
Reaction (c), that is, the formation of amide bonds, preferably takes place under standard conditions for the formation of peptide bonds (condensation reaction). In a reactive derivative of a compound of the formula I, the carboxyl group is either functionalized as activated ester (reactive form). The reactive carboxyl groups are, however, preferably synthesized in situ<br><br>
(for example making use of reagents customary in peptide chemistry, e.g. for the preparation of 1-hydroxybenzotriazoie, succinimide- or N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, or in situ deriva-tisation with condensing agents, e.g. with carbodiimides, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, with carbonylimidazole, with N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1f2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethy-lene]-N-methylmethanaminiumhexafluorophosphate-N-oxide (HATU); with 2-(1H-benzo-triazol-1-yl)-1 J,3(3-tetramethyluroniumtetrafluoroborat (HBTU), with 2-(pyridon-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetrame^.hyluroniumtetrafluoroborate (TPTU); or benzotriazol-l-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)-phosphoniumhexafluorophosphafe (BOP), or similar reagents). The condensation reaction preferably takes place in the presence of a condensing agent, especially HBTU, in an aprotic polar solvent, preferably a N,N-di-(lower alky!)-lower alkanoylamide, such as dimethylform-amide, at preferred temperatures in the range from 0 to 50 °C, e.g. at room temperature.<br>
Compounds of formula I can be transformed into different compounds of formula I.<br>
Especially, the following transformations are of interest:<br>
In compounds of the formula I wherein A and/or A' is N, a N may be oxidised to an N-»0 by oxidation in the presence of a peroxide, especially a peroxybenzoic acid derivative, such as 3-chioroperoxybenzoic acid, in the presence of a base, e.g. an alkali metal carbonate, such as sodium carbonate, and in an appropriate solvent, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as chloroform or methylene chloride.<br>
In compounds of the formula I where a lower alkoxy, especially methoxy, substituent R* is present, this substituent may be transformed into the corresponding hydroxy substituent R4, for example in an alcohol, such as ethanol, in the presence of an acid, such as HCI, preferably at elevated temperatures, e.g. under reflux, or in the presence of a tri-lower alkylsilane-iodide, especially Me3Si-l, in an appropriate solvent, e.g. a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as chloroform or methylene chloride, at elevated temperatures, for example at 40 to 60 °C. The corresponding hydroxy group may then, by way of tautomerism transferring the hydrogen to an adjacent carbon atom with a double bond, form an oxo group, thus leading, if only one of A and A' is N, to a pyridin-on-yl moeity, if both are N, to a pyrimidin-on-yl moiety.<br>
Salts of compounds of formula I having at least one salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known perse. For example, salts of compounds of formula I having acid groups may<br><br>
be formed, for example, by treating the compounds with metal compounds, such as alkali metal salts of suitable organic carboxylic acids, e.g. the sodium salt of 2-ethylhexanoic acid, with organic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compounds, such as the corresponding hydroxides, carbonates or hydrogen carbonates, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, with corresponding calcium compounds or with ammonia or a suitable organic amine, stoichiometric amounts or only a small excess of the salt-forming agent preferably being used. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I are obtained in customary manner, e.g. by treating the compounds with an acid or a suitable anion exchange reagent. Internal salts of compounds of formula I containing acid and basic salt-forming groups, e.g. a free carboxy group and a free amino group, may be formed, e.g. by the neutralisation of salts, such as acid addition salts, to the isoelectric point, e.g. with weak bases, or by treatment with ion exchangers.<br>
Salts can be converted in customary manner into the free compounds; metal and ammonium salts can be converted, for example, by treatment with suitable acids, and acid addition salts, for example, by treatment with a suitable basic agent.<br>
Mixtures of isomers obtainable according to the invention can be separated in a manner known per se into the individual isomers; diastereoisomers can be separated, for example, by partitioning between polyphasic solvent mixtures, recrystallisation and/or chromatographic separation, for example over silica gel or by e.g. medium pressure liquid chromatography over a reversed phase column, and racemates can be separated, for example, by the formation of salts with optically pure salt-forming reagents and separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers so obtainable, for example by means of fractional crystallisation, or by chromatography over optically active column materials.<br>
Intermediates and final products can be worked up and/or purified according to standard methods, e.g. using chromatographic methods, distribution methods, (re-)crystallization, and the like.<br>

Example 165: Pharmacokinetic data<br>
The compound of formula I or I* to be tested is formulated for administration to female MAG mice from BRL, Fuellinsdorf, Switzerland, by dissolving in DMSO/Tween 80 (90:10 v/v). The solution is diluted 1 :20 with distilled water and briefly sonicated to give a macroscopically homogenous suspension in 5 % v/v DMSO/0.5 % v/v Tween 80. Final concentrations of compound are 10, 3 and 1 mg/ml for dosed of 50 mg/kg, respectively. Each formulation is examined under a phase contrast microscope and particle form described and size are estimated.<br>
The formulated compound is administered by gavage to provide dosages of 50 mg/kg. At the alloted time points mice (4 at each time) are anesthesized with 3 % isoflurane in oxygen and heart blood is removed into heparinized tubes (ca. 30 lU/ml). The animals are subsequently<br><br>
killed without recovering from the anesthetic. Plasma is prepared from the blood by centrifu-gation (10,000 g, 5 min) and either analysed immediately or stored frozen at - 70 °C. The plasma samples are mixed with an equal volume of acetonitrile and allowed to stand at rt for 20-30 min. The protein precipitate is removed by centrifucation (10,000 x g) and a sample of the supernatant is analysed by reversed-phase HPLC on Merck-Hitachi LaChrom® equipment. The sample (100 ul) is injected onto a Nucleosil® 100-5 C18 column (Macherey &amp; Nagel, Dtiren, F.R.G.) (125 x 4 mm) with a guard column (8x4 mm) of the same material. The column is equilibrated e.g. with a 5 % v/v acetonitrile in water containing 0.05 % trifluo-roacetic acid (TFA). The sample is eluted e.g. with a gradient of 5 % v/v acetonitrile to 95 % v/v acetonitrile (in water with 0.05 % v/v TFA) over a period of 10 min. The column is then prepared for the next sample by holding the gradient at the final conditions for 5 min, then returning to the starting conditions and reequilibrating for 5 min. The compound is detected by absorbance, e.g. at 320 nm. The identity of the peak can be confirmed by retention time and UV absorption spectrum (diode array detector 205 - 400 nm) compared to controls. The amount of compound is quantified by the external standard method. A calibration curve is constructed with known amounts of compound in plasma which is processed as described above.<br>
