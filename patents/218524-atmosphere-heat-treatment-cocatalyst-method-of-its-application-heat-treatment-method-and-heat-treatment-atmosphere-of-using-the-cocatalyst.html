				<td>Technology Area<br>
The present invention involves in a kind of atmosphere heat treatment cocatalyst and its application. In heat treatment equipment or heat treatment gas-producing equipment the cocatalyst is dispersed into the atmosphere material or atmosphere in the form of a gas phase or finer dispersion (such as mote), or it can release out the substance with similar function of the cocatalyst. The present invention still involves various heat treatment methods using said cocatalyst and said method.<br>
Technology background<br>
Heat treatment atmosphere, generally refers to heat treatment protection atmosphere and chemical heat treatment atmosphere, consists of H2, N2, CO, a few of CH4, CO2, H20, NH3 as well as unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Almost all of carbon compounds can fission or react with water and air in high temperature to create heat treatment atmosphere. Those carbon compound can be heat treatment atmosphere materials such as Methanol, Ethanol, N-butyl Alcohol, Iopropylalcohol, Acetone, Ethyl acetate, Aniline, Toluene, Xylenes, Kerosene, charcoal, Active carbon, Dimethylmethane, Butane, Natural gas, Coal gas, etc.<br>
When carbon compound is used as heat treatment atmosphere material, their functions are accordant. When certain carbon are provided and fissioned in high temperature or react with water and air to create a heat treatment atmosphere with H2, N2, CO and a few of CH4, C02, H2O, NH3. Therefore, a kind of material can be replaced by another in practice.<br>
In existing technology, mostly employ to aerate atmosphere material with H20, air and Methanol into heat treatment equipment, make use of heat treatment process to create heat treatment atmosphere. Many international and Chinese heat treatment enterprises and heat treatment equipment manufacturers adopt this method.<br>
Said method has an advantage of lower investment of the equipment at first time, but as a result of the limitations of the workpiece and heat treatment equipment, higher processing temperatures may not be selected. People have not been discovering a kind of proper method of using catalyst in the equipment condition for long time. So said method exists widely insufficient of atmosphere material fission and more carbon soot because of lower temperature and a lack of cocatalyst, it brings much limitation and negative effect to production and processing control.<br>
To solve said problem, many international and Chinese heat treatment enterprises and heat treatment equipment manufacturers adopt a method of increasing a sort of special gas-producing facility outside heat treatment equipment. The special gas-producing<br><br>
facility is filled with a lot of various shapes cocatalysts (accelerant) many holes. The principle of the holes is material has greater contact with the gas so that the atmosphere material to contact with the surface of cocatalyst and be catalyzed in production.<br>
Because of the gas-producing facility can be used in the higher processing temperature plus the usage of the catalysis, the problem of carbon soot can be solved at certain degree.<br>
At present, some people try to coat the cocatalyst directly on the inside wall of heat treatment equipment contacting with atmosphere material, or to make fixture and inside of furnace in the material with catalyst effect and so on, expects to increase atmosphere fission and decrease carbon soot, however the result is not any better than using gas-producing equipment.<br>
No matter what kind of equipment is used or what form of atmosphere is employed, reducing carbon soot is always the dream of the heat treatment experts. Reducing carbon soot brings a great deal of advantage for the production and its processing control. Especially in chemical heat treatment carburizing and carbonitriding, people expect to accelerate carburizing speed and production efficiency or lower processing temperature to improve the quality of heat treatment production in high carbon potential control, but because of the effect of carbon soot, the expectation can be hardly realized (it is easy to create carbon soot in high carbon potential).<br>
It is inescapable to created carbon soot even if using of a gas-producing facility in existing technology. Once carbon soot is formed, it would attach on the surface of cocatalysts and obstructs the contact between the atmosphere material and cocatalyst, affects catalysis and makes cocatalysis harder to realize.<br>
In addition, cocatalyst (accelerant) has the property of poisoning and aging inescapably during the process;.<br>
Further catalyst aging, poisoning or carbon soot on its surface will affect the activation of catalyst, make carbon soot increase, further decrease the catalysis or lose the chance of contacting with atmosphere material as the effect of carbon soot, weaken the activation and the production. Therefore, it is necessary to find out a kind of cocatalyst without the effect of aging, poisoning and carbon soot for heat treatment atmosphere.<br>
Invention content<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to invent a kind of cocatalyst compound without the effect of aging, poisoning and carbon soot for heat treatment atmosphere and the operation method of cocatalyst so that the cocatalyst play a part of catalysis and activation in heat treatment atmosphere formed by atmosphere material, reduce carbon soot and fulfill protect atmosphere heating and chemical heat treatment carburizing,<br><br>
carbonitnding in higher carbon potential with few carbon soot as well as enhance the efficiency, quality and stability of heat treatment process, decrease process cost.<br>
A operation method of the present invention is that cocatalyst is dissolved or dispersed into heat treatment atmosphere material or heat treatment atmosphere, and cocatalyst keep up the form of gas phase or finer dispersion (such as mote) and diffused into atmosphere material and/or atmosphere in heat treatment equipment or heat treatment gas-producing equipment.

The cocatalysts in the present invention mean to be such compounds that have catalysis to heat treatment atmosphere formed by atmosphere material and activation to heat treatment atmosphere or release a kind of substance with the same function of said substance in the process condition of heat treatment.<br>

5.	In existing technology, the catalyst should be activated in heat treatment gas-producing<br>
generator in 30 days, and be changed in about a year, meanwhile it needs to stop the<br>
equipment. In the present invention, it should not need to spend extra time to specially<br>
activize and change cocatalyst. In original technology, the temperature of gas-producing<br>
equipment should be controlled at above 1000 ° C, gas-producing quality can be stable,<br>
eligible. Atmosphere keep at the scope CO2 
in present invention, the lowest heat treatment temperature can be decreased to about 800<br>
0 C, still gain the same gas-producing quality.<br>
a) Natural gas and air are aerated into heat treatment gas-producing equipment filled with Nickel catalyst at 1050 ° C, run successively heat treatment equipment for 35 days. CO2 is 0.43%, CH4 is 0.038% in the atmosphere through measure; run successively heat treatment equipment for 40 days, CO2 is 0.63%; CH4 is 0.1% in the atmosphere. It is shown that the catalyst to be poisoning severely. Taking out the catalyst, the catalyst has been surrounded almost completely.<br>
b). Natural gas, air and cocatalyst compound in present invention are aerated into heat treatment gas-producing generator without accelerant at 950 ° C together, and check atmosphere after run successively in 35 days, the C02of the atmosphere is 0.33%, CH4 is 0.03%, after run successively in 45days, the CO2 of the atmosphere is 0.35%, CH4 is 0.03%, after run successively in 60 days, the C02 of the atmosphere is 0.34%, CH4 is 0.03%.<br>
6.
