(Document] Specification<br>
[Title of Invention] VEHICLE STEERING STEM FASTENING<br>
STRUCTURE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001 ]<br>
The present invention relates to improving a vehicle steering stem fastening structure. [Background Art]<br>
[0002 ]<br>
Front forks, that support a front wheel of a motorcycle, that are fitted in a freely steerable manner via a steering stem to a head pipe provided at the front end of a vehicle frame, and where the upper end of the steering stem is then fastened to a top bridge coupling the left and right front forks, exis t .<br>
Structures where the upper end of the steering stem is fastened to the top bridge using a nut are well-known as this kind of related art steering stem fastening structure (for example, refer to patent document 1).<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Hei. 8-99675.<br>
[ 0003 ]<br>
A description is given in the following of FIG.<br><br>
3 and FIG. 4 of patent document 1.<br>
A steering stem 10 is supported in a freely rotatable manner at a head pipe 11 via a bearing (outer race 16, cylindrical roller 14 and inner race 17).<br>
[0004]<br>
A stem nut 21 is screwed in at an upper part of the steering stem 10 so as to confront the inner race 17. An upper bracket 12 is fitted so as to confront the stem nut 21. A washer 31 is fitted at the upper end of the steering stem 10 projecting further upwards than the upper bracket 12. An upper nut 30 is screwed in, and the steering stem 10 is fastened to the upper bracket 12.<br>
[0005]<br>
A pair of left and right handlebar holders 22, 22 are provided at the upper surface of the upper bracket 12. A handlebar (not shown) is then fitted to a handlebar holder 24 as a result of being fitted to the handlebar holders 22, 22 by two bolts 26.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems the invention sets out to solve]<br>
[0006]<br>
An insertion hole through which the steering stem 10 passes is provided at the upper bracket 12 between the left and right handlebar holders 22, 22. It is<br><br>
therefore difficult to screw in the upper nut 30 using a tool at the upper end of the steering stem 10 after fitting the handlebar to the upper bracket 12 even if the upper end of the steering stem 10 is inserted into the insertion hole for the upper bracket 12. In other words, the handlebar is fitted to the upper bracket 12 after fitting the steering stem 10 to the upper bracket 12 using the upper nut 30. This puts restrictions on the assembly procedure.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, when the steering stem 10 is fitted after fitting the handlebar to the upper bracket 12, it is necessary to change the position of the handlebar holders 22, 22 or change the shape of the handlebar so that the upper nut 30 can be screwed in at the steering stem 10 using a tool. This means that the degree of freedom of design with respect to the degree of freedom of the shape of and arrangement of parts about the periphery of the upper bracket 12 is limited and the order of assembly, i.e. the degree of freedom with respect to production, is limited.<br>
[0008 ]<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a steering stem fastening structure that increases the degree of design freedom with regards<br><br>
to the degree of freedom for the shape of parts located around a top bridge and the degree of freedom with regards to arrangement etc. and that increases the degree of production freedom.<br>
[Means for solving the problems]<br>
[0009 ]<br>
In an aspect of the invention of claim 1, in a vehicle steering stem fastening structure with a steering stem axially supported in a freely rotating manner at a head pipe, with a top bridge constructing a front fork fitted to an upper end of the steering stem, and with a handlebar fitted to the top bridge, the steering stem is fitted to the top bridge using a cap nut, and the cap nut comprises a cylindrical section and a cover section provided integrally with an end of the cylindrical section, an internal thread an external thread formed at an end of the steering stem threads into is formed at an inside surface of the cylindrical section, and a nut section is provided integrally at the cover section.<br>
[0010 ]<br>
Regarding  operation,  an  internal  thread for threading with an external thread of the steering stem is formed at an inside surface of the cylinder section. The external shape of the nut section formed at the<br><br>
cover section provided at an end of the cylindrical section can therefore be made small regardless of the outer diameter of the steering stem.<br>
[0011 ]<br>
If the external shape of the nut section is small, the outer diameter of a tool fitted to the nut section in order to turn the nut section can become small. This means that fastening of the cap nut to the steering stem is possible even when the handlebar fitted to the top bridge and the cap nut are in close proximity to each other.<br>
[ 0012 ]<br>
In an aspect of the invention of claim 2, the diameter of a circumscribed circle for the nut section is made smaller than the outer diameter of the steering stem.<br>
As an operation, for example, when a normal hexagonal nut is threaded onto the steering stem, the diameter of a circumscribed circle for the hexagonal nut is larger than the outer diameter of the steering stem. The outer diameter of a socket for turning the hexagonal nut therefore becomes larger but, in the present invention, the diameter of a subscribed circle for the nut section of the cap nut can be made smaller than the outer diameter of the steering stem.<br><br>
The nut section is then turned as a result of the fitting of a socket with a smaller outer diameter. The degree of freedom of the arrangement of the cap nut about the top bridge is therefore increased. Further, freedom of arrangement of a socket storage location for a production line can also be increased by using a small socket.<br>
[0013 ]<br>
In an aspect of the invention of claim 3, a stem insertion hole for passing through a steering stem is provided at the top bridge. A large diameter section where the cylindrical section of the cap nut is inserted when the cap nut is threaded onto the end of the steering stem is formed at this stem insertion hole, and an outer diameter of the cover section of the cap nut is larger than the outer diameter of the cylindrical section.<br>
The operation is then such that the cylindrical section of the cap nut is inserted into an annular recess, and the amount of projection of the cap nut from the upper surface of the top bridge is made small.<br>
[0014 ]<br>
In an aspect of claim 4 of the invention, part of the cover section overlaps with the handlebar when viewed in an axial direction of the steering stem.<br><br>
It is therefore possible to make the top bridge small because part of the cover section overlaps with the handlebar as viewed from an axial direction of the steering stem. It is possible to make the outer diameter of the nut section of the cap nut small even when part of the cover section overlaps with the handlebar. The outer diameter of the fastening tool fitted at the nut section therefore becomes small and fastening of the cap nut can be carried out without impediment.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0015]<br>
In an aspect of the invention of claim 1, in a vehicle steering stem fastening structure with a steering stem axially supported in a freely rotating manner at a head pipe, with a top bridge constructing a front fork fitted to an upper end of the steering stem, and with a handlebar fitted to the top bridge, the steering stem is fitted to the top bridge using a cap nut, and the cap nut comprises a cylindrical section and a cover section provided integrally with an end of this cylindrical section, an internal thread an external thread formed at an end of the steering stem threads into is formed at an inside surface of the cylindrical section, and a nut section is provided<br><br>
integrally at the cover section. For example, compared to fitting a steering stem to a top bridge by fastening an existing nut to an external thread formed at an end of the steering stem, it is possible to make the external shape of the nut section of the cap nut smaller than for an existing nut and a fastening operation can be carried out in a narrow space when the cap nut is fastened.<br>
[0016]<br>
It is therefore possible to increase the degree of freedom of design regarding the degree of freedom for the shape and arrangement of parts located about a top bridge. Even if other parts such as the handlebar are fitted before fitting of the steering stem to the top bridge, it is difficult for this to influence fastening of the steering stem and the degree of freedom of production can be increased.<br>
[0017]<br>
In an aspect of the invention of claim 2, a diameter of a circumscribed circle of the nut section is smaller than an outer diameter of the steering stem. It is therefore possible to make the outer diameter of the socket fitted to the nut section smaller and the degree of freedom of the cap nut surrounding the top bridge is increased.  Further,  the degree of<br><br>
freedom of arrangement of tools at a storage location for storing the socket on a production line can be increased.<br>
[0018 ]<br>
In an aspect of the invention of claim 3, a stem insertion hole for allowing the steering stem to pass is formed in the top bridge. A large diameter section where the cylindrical section of the cap nut is inserted when the cap nut is threaded onto the end of the steering stem is formed at this stem insertion hole, and an outer diameter of the cover section of the cap nut is larger than the outer diameter of the cylindrical section. It is therefore possible to lower the position of fastening the steering stem and the cap nut as a result of the large diameter section and the extent of projection of the cap nut from the upper surface of the top bridge can be suppressed. Fastening is therefore straightforward even in confined spaces.<br>
[0019 ]<br>
In the aspect of the invention of claim 4, part of the cover section overlaps with the handlebar as viewed in an axial direction of the steering stem. It is therefore possible to make the top bridge small and to make the front of the vehicle slim. Further,<br><br>
by making the nut section of the cap nut small, after assembling the handlebar to the top bridge, it is possible to fit the steering stem to the top bridge by rotating the cap nut and productivity can therefore be increased. [Embodiments]<br>

[ 0029]<br>
FIG. 2 is a cross - sectional view (first embodiment) showing a front part of the vehicle of the present invention. The steering stem 34 is supported in a freely rotatable manner at the head pipe 12 via stem bearings 101, 102. The bottom bridge 33 is fitted to the lower end of the steering stem 34. The top bridge 32 is then fitted to the upper end of the steering stem 34 so as to be sandwiched by the stem nut 103 and the cap nut 36. The shock absorber unit 31 is then fitted to the top bridge 32 and the bottom bridge 33.<br>
[0030 ]<br>
Here, at a handlebar bracket that fixes the handlebar 41, numeral 105 indicates a fork bolt that fits the shock absorber unit 31 to the top bridge 32,<br><br>
numeral 106 indicates a washer, numeral 107 indicates a bolt that fastens the shock absorber unit 31 to the bottom bridge 33, numeral 111 indicates a key cylinder fitted to the top bridge 32, numeral 112 indicates a key shutter that covers the upper part of the key cylinder 111, and numeral 113, 113 (only numeral 113 of the front side is shown) indicate a pair of left and right handlebar support units 114 (only numeral 114 of the front side is shown) provided integrally at the top bridge 32.<br>
[0031 ]<br>
The stem bearing 101 has an outer race 121 press-fitted to the head pipe 12, an inner race 122 fitted at the steering stem 34, and a number of steel balls 123 provided between the outer race 121 and the inner race 122. The stem bearing 102 has an inner race 125 press-fitted to the steering stem 34, an outer race 126 press-fitted to the head pipe 12, and a number of steel balls 127 provided between the inner race 125 and the outer race 126. Numeral 128 is a dust cover, and numeral 131 is a dust seal.<br>
[0032 ]<br>
Stem nut 103 is fastened by screwing into an external thread 34a formed on the steering stem 34, presses down on the inner race 122 of the stem bearing<br><br>
101, and supports the lower surface of the top bridge 32 .<br>
[0033 ]<br>
The top bridge 32 is formed with a steering stem insertion hole 32a for inserting the upper end of the steering stem 34 and a large diameter hole 32b of an internal diameter that is larger than the steering stem insertion hole 32a. At the cap nut 36, a cylindrical section 36a screwed into an external thread 34b formed at an upper end of the steering stem 34 is inserted into the large diameter hole 32b in the top bridge 32. Numeral 135 is a washer.<br>
[0034 ]<br>
FIG. 3 is a cross - sectional view (first embodiment) of a cap nut of the present invention. The cap nut 36 has a cylindrical section 36a formed with an internal thread 36b on the inside, and a cover section 36c formed integrally at an end of the cylindrical section 36a. The cover section 36c has a hexagonal column-shaped nut section 36e provided integrally at a tapered surface 36d. An outer diameter Dl of the cover section 36c is larger than an outer diameter D2 of the cylindrical section 36a.<br>
Further, an outer diameter D3 of a circumscribed circle circumscribed about the hexagon of the nut<br><br>
section 36e is smaller than an outer diameter DS (refer to FIG. 2) of the steering stem 34 (refer to FIG. 2 ) .<br>
[0035 ]<br>
The diameter D3 of a circumscribed circle for the nut section 36e is smaller than the outer diameter DS of the steering stem 34. It is therefore possible to make the outer diameter of a tool 140 (refer to FIG. 5B) such as a socket for fitting the nut section 36e small and the degree of freedom for locating the cap nut 36 around the top bridge 32 can be increased. Further, the degree of freedom for locating tools at a storage location for storing the tool 140 on a production line can therefore be increased.<br>
[ 0036]<br>
FIG. 4 is a view taken along arrow 4 (first embodiment) of FIG. 1 and is a view as viewed along an axial direction of the steering stem 34. Key cylinder 111 (refer to FIG. 2) and key shutter 112 (refer to FIG. 2) are omitted.<br>
The cover section 36c provided at the cap nut 36 partially overlaps with the handlebar 41 when viewed in an axial direction of the steering stem 34. However, the nut section 36e of the cap nut 36 does not overlap with the handlebar 41. It is therefore possible to<br><br>
turn and fasten the cap nut 36 using the cylindrical tool 140 at the nut section 36e.<br>
[0037]<br>
Further, part of the cover section 36c overlaps with the handlebar 41. It is therefore possible to make the extent of projection of the rear part of the top bridge 32 smaller. The width from front to rear of the top bridge 32 can then be made small and it is also possible to make the top bridge 32 small. It is therefore possible for the top bridge 32 to be made lightweight and for the front part of the vehicle to be made slim.<br>
[0038]<br>
Here, numeral 32d denotes a mounting seat provided at a front part of the top bridge 32 for fitting the key shutter 112, numeral 32e, 32e denote fitting holes formed at the top bridge 32 for inserting a bolt for fitting the key shutter 112, and numeral 32f denotes a key cylinder insertion hole made at the top bridge 32 through which the key cylinder 111 passes.<br>
[0039 ]<br>
The procedure for fastening the cap nut 36 to the steering stem 34 described above is described in the following. FIG. 5A and B are operation views (first<br><br>
embodiment) showing a procedure for fastening the cap nut of the present invention. In FIG. 5A, the cap nut 36 is moved up as far as an upper end of the large diameter hole 32b of the top bridge 32 and the steering stem 34 with the handlebar 41 fitted to the top bridge 32 and the cap nut 36 is turned so as to be screwed into the upper end of the steering stem 34.<br>
[ 0040 ]<br>
In FIG. 5B, if the cap nut 36 is partially-tightened at the steering stem 34, the tool 140 is fitted to the nut section 36e and the cap nut 36 is fastened tight using the tool 140. Fastening of the cap nut 36 is then complete.<br>
[0041 ]<br>
As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 above, the steering stem 34 is fitted to the top bridge 32 using the cap nut 36. The cap nut 36 is made of the cylindrical section 36a, and the cover section 36c provided integrally at an end of the cylindrical section 36a. The internal thread 36b threading into the external thread 34b formed at an end of the steering stem 34 at an inner surface of the cylindrical section 36a is formed and the nut section 36e is integrally provided at the cover section 36c. This means that the external shape of the nut section 36e of the cap<br><br>
nut 36 can be made smaller than an existing nut compared to fastening the steering stem to the top bridge by fastening an existing nut formed at an end section of the steering stem. The fastening operation can therefore be carried out in a narrower space when fastening the cap nut 36.<br>
[ 0042]<br>
It is therefore possible to increase the degree of freedom of design regarding the degree of freedom for the shape and arrangement of parts located about the top bridge 32. This means that even if other parts such as the handlebar 41 are fitted before fitting of the steering stem 34 to the top bridge 32, it is difficult for this to influence fastening of the steering stem 34 and the degree of freedom of production can be increased.<br>
[0043]<br>
Further, the steering stem insertion hole 32a for allowing the steering stem 34 to pass is formed at the top bridge 32. The large diameter section 32b enabling the cylindrical section 36a of the cap nut 36 to be inserted when the cap nut 36 is fastened to the end of the steering stem 34 is formed at the steering stem insertion hole 32a. The outer diameter Dl of the cover section 36c of the cap nut 36 is then<br><br>
made larger than the outer diameter D2 of the cylindrical section 36a. The fastening position of the steering stem 34 and the cap nut 36 can then be made lower as a result of the large diameter section 32b and the extent of projection of the cap nut 36 from the upper surface of the top bridge 32 can be suppressed. Fastening is therefore straightforward even in confined spaces.<br>
[0044 ]<br>
Moreover, as shown in FIG. 4, part of the cover section 36c of the cap nut 36 overlaps with the handlebar 41 when viewed in an axial direction of the steering stem 34. It is therefore possible to make the top bridge 32 small and to make the front part of the vehicle body slim. Further, by making the nut section 36e of the cap nut 36 small, after assembling the handlebar 41 to the top bridge 32, it is possible to fit the steering stem 34 to the top bridge 32 by rotating the cap nut 36 and productivity can therefore be increased.<br>
[0045]<br>
FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view showing the essential parts of a steering stem fastening structure (second embodiment) of the present invention. A bolt insertion hole 57a is formed at a<br><br>
top bridge 57. A steering stem 58 passes through the bolt insertion hole 57a. An internal thread 59a formed at a cap nut 59 then threads into an external thread 58a formed at an end section of the steering stem 58. The steering stem 58 is then shown to be fastened to the top bridge 57. Numeral 60 denotes a washer.<br>
[0046 ]<br>
The cap nut 59 has a cup section 59b formed with the internal thread 59a at an inner surface, and a hexagonal column-shaped nut section 59c formed integrally with the bottom of the cap section 59b. The shape is therefore simplified and costs can be reduced.<br>
[0047 ]<br>
FIG. 7 is a cross- sectional view showing a cap nut (third embodiment) of the present invention. Aspects of the structure that are the same as for the first embodiment shown in FIG. 3 are given the same numerals and their detailed description is omitted. A cap nut 69 has the cylindrical section 36a formed with the internal thread 36b at an inner surface, and a cover section 69c formed integrally at an end of the cylindrical section 36a. The cover section 69c is provided with a hexagonal hole 69d at a center. A tool is then inserted into the hexagonal hole 69d<br><br>
and the cap nut 69 is fastened by screwing into the steering stem 34 (refer to FIG. 2).<br>
[00 48]<br>
FIG. 8 is a plan view of a central part of a vehicle of the present invention. A fuel discharge outlet 72a is provided at a rear part of the fuel pump 72 provided within the fuel tank 67. A state where a joint section 73a of the first fuel supply pipe 73 is connected to the fuel discharge outlet 72a is shown.<br>
[0049]<br>
For example, a fuel discharge outlet is provided at a side (upper part and lower part of the drawing) of the fuel pump 72. When the joint section 73a is connected to the fuel discharge outlet, the joint section 73a projects further to the side than one main frame 21. It is therefore easier for external force to act on the joint section 73a from the vehicle side but at this vehicle the joint section 73a is located within the width of the main frame 21. It is therefore possible to safeguard the joint section 73a from external power acting from the vehicle side.<br>
[0050 ]<br>
FIG. 9 is an exploded view showing a rear body cover of a vehicle of the present invention. The rear body cover 83 has a left and right pair of a left cover<br><br>

The left cover 144 has a screw insertion hole 144d for inserting the screw 151 (refer to FIG. 9) for fitting to the main frame 21 (refer to FIG. 8), notches 144f, 144g for avoiding interference with the grab rail 84 (refer to FIG. 1),<br><br>
a screw insertion hole 144j where the screw 156 (refer to FIG. 9) is inserted, pawls 144b, 144b, and an inner projection 144m provided between the pawls 144b, 144b. The right cover 145 (refer to FIG. 9) has the same basic structure as the left cover 144 and a description thereof is omitted.<br>
[0053 ]<br>
FIG. 11 is a plan view of a rear body cover of the present invention and shows the rear body cover 83 slightly to the left from a vehicle center line 160 extending in a direction from the front to the rear of the vehicle passing through the center of the vehicle width.<br>
Stepped sections 146b are respectively formed at side walls 146a, 146a (only one symbol 146a is shown) of the center cover 146. Slits 146c to 146e for the pawls 144b, 144b and inner projection 144m to insert into are formed along the stepped sections 146b from the sidewalls 146a. Numeral 146g in the drawings is a center-side inner projection provided at the center cover 146 facing the inner projection 144m.<br>
[0054 ]<br>
FIG. 12A to C are views describing a clip for use with the rear body cover of the present invention. In FIG. 12A and B, the clip 157 is a steel spring that<br><br>
has a reverse-C-shaped section 157a formed by bending a plate over in the shape of a reverse C, and V-shaped curved sections 157b, 157b formed by bending the ends of the reverse -C-shaped sections 157a inwards in the shape of a V.<br>
[0055]<br>
FIG. 12C is a cross- sectional view showing the coupling state of the left cover 144 (refer to FIG. 9) (or the right cover 145 (refer to FIG. 9)) and the center cover 146 (refer to FIG. 9) and shows the inner projection 144m of the left cover 144 (or inner projection 145m of the right cover 145) and the center side inner projection 146g of the center cover 146 coupled by the clip 157.<br>
[0056 ]<br>
More specifically, the inner projection 144m of the left cover 144 (or the inner projection 145m of the right cover 145) and the center side inner projection 146g of the center cover 146 are aligned. The clip 157 is then fitted over the inner projection 144m (or the inner projection 145m) and the center side inner projection 146g, and the V-shaped curved sections 157b, 157b of the clip 157 act on the engaging slits 144r (or engaging slit 145r) and 146w formed at the inner projection 144m (or inner projection<br><br>
145m) and center side projection 146g, respectively.<br>
[0057 ]<br>
FIG. 13 is a view along arrow 13 of FIG. 9 and shows the right cover 145 of the rear body cover 83 and the center cover 146 in a coupled state. Namely, the inner projection 145j of the right cover 145 is fitted to the front part of the center cover 146 using the screw 156, and the pawls 145b, 145b of the right cover 145 are inserted into the slits 146c to 146e of the center cover 146 and engage with the side of the center cover 146. The inner projection 145m of the right cover 145 is aligned with the center side inner projection 146g of the center cover 146 and pinched by the clip 157 so as to be coupled.<br>
[ 0058]<br>
FIG. 14 is a view along arrow 14 of FIG. 13, where the pawl 145b of the right cover 145 is equipped with a groove 145n. The stepped section 146b of the center cover 146 engages with the groove 145n. A pawl body 145p provided at the tip of the pawl 145b engages with the sidewall 146a.<br>
[ 0059]<br>
The center side inner projection 146g of the center cover 146 has upright walls 146r, 146s extending from an inside surface 146q of the center<br><br>
cover 146 and a flat wall 146t the upright walls 146r, 146s hang from. This flat wall 146t is aligned with the inner projection 145m of the right cover 145 so as to couple with the clip 157.<br>
[0060 ]<br>
By coupling the flat wall 146t and the inner projection 145m using the clip 157, it is possible to suppress a fluttering sound occurring at the right cover 145 (and left cover 144) and the center cover 146 even in cases where coupling with the center cover 146 loosens as a result of deterioration in the pawl 145b with the passage of time. Further, it is possible to make the plate thickness of the right cover 145 (and the left cover 144) and the center cover 146 thinner because screws are not used.<br>
[0061 ]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8, the fuel discharge outlet 72a is provided within the width of the main frame 21 at a rear part of the fuel pump 72 but this is by no means limiting and the fuel discharge outlet 72a may also be provided within the width of the main frame 21 at the front part of the fuel pump 72 .
