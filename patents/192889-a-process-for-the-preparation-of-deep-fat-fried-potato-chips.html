				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of deep fried foods. With reduced oil absorption for example potato chips and tiles like food <br>
Deep fat frying of foods is well established method in India for cooking the foods. It provides ideal taste, crispness to the food and thus increases the acceptability of the food by everyone.<br>
According to the conventional process the foods for example potato chips are washed, peeled and subjected to the step of slicing. The sliced potato is washed with water and then dried. The dried sliced potato is then subjected to the process of deep fat frying. In this process the oil absorption by the product is around 40%.<br>
However, there are disadvantages associated with the conventional process. One of the main disadvantage is  that  the fried food has high oil/fat  contents  and<br>
therefore  it is harmful to the people specifically  old people.   Another  disadvantage is that the  fried  food causes  obesity,  arthristis, high  blood  pressure  and cardiac problems.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the high absorption oil/fat increases the cost of the product and also reduces the storage life of the product.<br><br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to propose a novel process for the preparation of freed food having reduced oil ateorption.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel process for the preparing of fried food which do not causes health hazard to any person.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to pro}X)se an improved fried food for example potato chips with reduced oil/fat contents.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of deep fried potetto chips comprising slicing of cleaned potatoes, blanching sliced potato in 2% calcium chloride solution and 0.5-1% sodium acid pyrophosphate for 3-5 mins., frying said blanched potato slices and then treating the same with a 5-6% solution of low methyl content pectin at room temperature, dipping/soaking said slices in 0.25-0.3% coax methyl cellulose (CMC), drying again tte treated slices of potatoes and then subjecting the same to the step of deep frit frying, adding known flavour material and spices to said slices during the step of deep fet frying in order to prepare the thin product.<br><br>
Subsequently according to this invention the sliced potato is subjected to blanchinq for 3-5 minutes with calcium chloride (CaCl^) 2X and then in sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) 0.52-iX. The blanched slices are dried and then sire treated with low metho&gt;!y content pectin (LMP) 5% solution for about 5-6 minutes at room temperature. The treated slices are then dipped (soaked) in carbo&gt;:y methyl cellulose (CMC) 0.25-0-3X. The slices so obtained mre dried by centrifugation and subsequently subjected to the step of deep fat frying. The flavor material and spices are added to the slices during the step of frying.<br>
The process for the preparation of deep fat fried food for example potato chips having reduced oil absorption according to a preferred embodiment is herein described in detail.<br>
The potatoes of the good quality Bre kept for 2-3 days at room temperature after taking out from the cold storttge to increase the starch content and to decrease the  sugar level and also to have better colour  in  the<br><br>
final product. Thesf potatoes are then subjected to the step of washing, peeling and slicing in a known manner. The sliced potatoes are blanched in calcium chloride (CaCl ) 2/. and in sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) 0.5~i% for 3-5 mins. in order to inacÂ¬tivate the enzymes. The blanched slices are dried and then treated with low methoxy content pectin (LliP) 5*/. solution by dipping the same for 5-6 mins. at room temperature. The treated slices are dipped/soaked in carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) 0.25-0.3*/. and then subjected to the step of drying by centrifugation. This treatment of slices helps in preventing oil getting rancid (hydraulic rancidity). The treatment with LMP acts as a barrier in the middle lamella of the cell wall of 1?he potato chips and prevents the middle lamellar space from getting filled up with the oil. The treatment with CMC will form a thin coating over the surface of the potato slices. This prevents the oil/fat from entering the deep layers of the tissues and thus reduces oil absorption upto 50% in final product without any change in the taste  and  quality. The treated slices are then dried  and  then<br>
subjected  to  the step of deep fat frying  at  high  temperature<br>
o preferably  176 C.  Flavor material and spices are added  to  the<br>
slices  during the step of frying to get the desired  flavor  and<br>
taste. The product so obtained is then packed into the packets in<br><br>
the presence of nitrogen to keep the product fresh. The other hydro colloids such as guargum (GG)j carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) ^ low metlioxy pectin (IMP) are natural products and can be used safely as they are recognized as safe (GRAB) internationally. The final moisture content after all the beatments and centrifugation is around 63-68% with an average moisture 70% while frying-<br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of deep fried potato chips comprising slicing of cleaned<br>
potatoes, blanching sliced potato in 2% calcium chloride solution and 0.5-1% sodium<br>
acid pyrophosphate for 3-5 mines frying said blanched potato slices and then treating the<br>
same with a 5-6% solution of low methyl content pectin at room temperature,<br>
dipping/soaking said slices in 0.25-0.3% carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC), drying again<br>
the treated slices of potatoes and then subjecting the same to the step of deep fet frying,<br>
adding known flavour material and spices to said slices during the step of deep fat frying<br>
in order to prepare the thin product.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step of deep fet frying is preferably carried<br>
out at a temperature of 176Â° C.<br>
3.	A process for the preparation of deep fried potato chips substantially as herein described<br>
and illustrated.<br><br></td>
