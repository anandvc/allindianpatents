The present invention provides certain 3-indazoyl-4-pyridylisothiazoles, particularly certain N acylated 5 amino-3 indazoyl-4-pyridylisothiazole derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of using the same, processes for preparing the same, and intermediates thereof.	<br>
	L-Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is referred to as an excitatory amino acid.  Glutamate receptors are composed of two major subtypes: the ligand-gated ion-channel ionotropic receptors, and the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane-domain metabotropic receptors (mGluRs).  The metabotropic family comprises eight members and is sub-divided into three groups based on sequence similarity, signal transduction, and pharmacology.  Group I receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5, and their splice variants) are positively coupled to inositol phosphate hydrolysis and the generation of an intracellular calcium signal.  Group II receptors (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group III receptors (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8) are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and regulate cyclic AMP levels by indirectly inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity.  The mGlu receptor subtypes have unique expression patterns in the central nervous system, which can be targeted with new and selective agents.  See, for example, Slassi, A. et. al., Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry (2005), 5, 897-911, in which mGluR5 antagonists are described as useful as (anti)anxiety agents in animal models related to stress.  Also, mGluR5 antagonists have been shown to be useful in models of substance dependence and withdrawal including alcohol self-administration, as well as models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.<br>
	The compounds of the present invention are selective antagonists of the Group I metabotropic receptors, particularly the mGluR5 receptor (mGluR5), especially with respect to mGluR2, mGluR3 and mGluR4; and they may be selective with respect to mGluR1.  As such they are believed to be useful for the treatment of conditions associated with those metabotropic glutamate receptors, such as anxiety including generalized anxiety disorder, depression including major depressive disorders, as well as anxiety co-morbid with depression (mixed anxiety depression disorder) including generalized anxiety disorder co-morbid with major depressive disorder.  <br>
	Thus, the present invention provides new compounds that are antagonists of mGluR5 and, as such, are believed to be useful in treatment of the disorders discussed above.  Such new compounds could address the need for safe and effective treatments of conditions associated with the above receptors without attending side effects.<br>

Accordingly, one particular aspect of the invention is treatment of mixed anxiety depression disorder including generalized anxiety disorder co-morbid with major depressive disorder. <br>
As used herein, the term “patient” refers to a warm blooded animal such as a mammal and includes a human. <br>
It is also recognized that one skilled in the art may affect an anxiety disorder by treating a patient presently displaying symptoms with an effective amount of the compound of formula I.  Thus, the terms “treatment” and “treating” are intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the disorder  and/or symptoms thereof, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms. <br>
It is also recognized that one skilled in the art may affect an anxiety disorder by treating a patient at risk of future symptoms with an effective amount of the compound of formula I and is intended to include prophylactic treatment of such. <br>
As used herein, the term “effective amount” of a compound of formula I refers to an amount, that is, the dosage which is effective in treating an anxiety disorder described herein.<br>
The attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, can readily determine an effective amount by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances.  In determining an effective amount, the dose of a compound of formula I, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to the compound of formula I to be administered; the co-administration of other agents, if used; the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the degree of involvement or the severity of anxiety; the response of the individual patient; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of other concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances. <br>
An effective amount of a compound of formula I is expected to vary from about 0.01 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 5 mg/kg/day. Preferred amounts may be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, that is, combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, the proportion and nature of which are determined by the solubility and chemical properties, including stability, of the compound selected, the chosen route of administration, and standard pharmaceutical practice.  The compounds of the present invention, while effective themselves, may be formulated and administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, for convenience of crystallization, increased solubility, and the like. <br>
Thus, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.<br>
One skilled in the art of preparing formulations can readily select the proper form and mode of administration depending upon the particular characteristics of the compound selected, the disorder or condition to be treated, the stage of the disorder or condition, and other relevant circumstances (REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, 19th Edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1995)).<br>
Example A<br>
Functional in vitro activity at human mGluR5 and mGluR1 receptors.<br>
	The activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are coupled to GTP-binding protein alpha q (Gq proteins) results in a change in intracellular calcium concentration.  This functional response can be measured in a kinetic assay using calcium-sensitive dyes and a fluorescent imaging plate reader using a standard technique known as FLIPR (MDS Analytical Technologies, Sunnyvale, CA).  Stable cell line preparation and assay techniques are adapted from Kingston, A. E., et. al.  (1995) Neuropharmacology 34: 887-894. <br>
Briefly, clonal cell lines expressing recombinant human mGluR5a and mGluR1a receptors are transfected into AV-12 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) containing the rat EAAT1 glutamate transporter.  Cells are grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 0.75 mg/ml geneticin, and 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin B at 37 ºC in an incubator with 95% relative humidity and 5% CO2.  Confluent cultures are passaged biweekly.  <br>
	For the functional assays, cells are seeded in growth medium lacking selection antibiotics at a density of 65K per well into 96-well, black/clear bottom, poly-D-lysine coated microplates and incubated for 18-20 hours prior to the experiment.  After removing the medium, cells are dye-loaded with 8 µM Fluo-3 in assay buffer consisting of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution supplemented with 20 mM HEPES for 1.5 hr at 25 ºC.  Compounds are serially diluted into DMSO and then diluted once into assay buffer; the final DMSO concentration in the assay is 0.625%.  A single-addition FLIPR assay generating an 11-point dose response curve for the agonist glutamate is conducted prior to each experiment to estimate the amount of agonist needed to induce an EC90 response.  The antagonist effects of compounds are quantified in the FLIPR instrument in 10-point dose curves by comparing the peak fluorescent responses to the agonist glutamate in the presence and absence of compound.  Specifically, the compound effect is measured as maximal minus minimal peak heights in relative fluorescent units corrected for basal fluorescence as measured in the absence of glutamate.  Activity data at the human mGluR5 and mGluR1 receptors are calculated as relative IC50 values using a four-parameter logistic curve fitting program (ActivityBase® v5.3.1.22).  <br>
	In the above assay, compounds exemplified herein exhibit an IC50 of less than 75 nM at mGluR5.  For example, the compound of Example 2 has an IC50 of 9.5 nM measured at mGluR5.  This demonstrates that compounds of the present invention are potent mGluR5 antagonists.<br>
Example B<br>
Attenuation of stress-induced hyperthermia in rats.<br>
	Hyperthermia, a rise in core body temperature, is a general phenomenon that has been reliably demonstrated in many mammals, including humans, in response to stress.  In many anxiety disorders, hyperthermia occurs as part of the pathology and is considered a symptom of the disease.  Compounds which attenuate stress-induced hyperthermia in animals are believed to be useful in treating anxiety disorders in humans.  <br>
The conventional and minimally-invasive method for analyzing stress-induced hyperthermia is by measuring body temperature, and stress-induced increases in body temperature, via rectal thermometer.  Male Fischer F-344 rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) weighing between 275 – 350 g are tested.  All animals are individually-housed with food and automated water available ad libitum, and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 06:00).  Animals are fasted for approximately 12-18 hours before the experiment, which is conducted during the light phase.  Rats are dosed p.o. in a dose volume of 1 mL/kg with test compounds in the range of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg (suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose, 0.25% polysorbate 80, 0.05% antifoam).  The mGluR5 antagonist MTEP (3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine), which has demonstrated robust anxiolytic-like activity in preclinical models, is used as a positive control (10 mg/kg, p.o., dissolved in water).  Immediately following dosing, rats are returned to their home cage, and the experimenter turns off the lights and leaves the room.  The dosing room is darkened for the remainder of the 60 min pretreatment period.<br>
After the pretreatment period, rats are taken individually to a brightly lit adjacent room where baseline body temperatures are determined by insertion of a rectal probe lubricated with mineral oil.  Body temperature is assessed using a PHYSITEMP BAT-12? Microprobe Thermometer with a PHYSITEMP RET-2? rat rectal probe (Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA).  The probe is inserted approximately 2 cm into the rectum, to measure the core body temperature (this is the baseline body temperature, T1, in degrees Celsius).  Ten minutes later a second body temperature measurement is recorded (T2).  The difference in body temperature (T2 – T1) is defined as the stress-induced hyperthermic response.  The dose at which a compound produces a 35% reduction in stress-induced hyperthermic response, relative to the vehicle response, is defined as the T35 dose.  In the above assay, the compound of Example 2 produces a reduction in stress-induced hyperthermia with a T35 dose = 3.0 mg/kg.  This demonstrates that compounds of the present invention are useful in an in vivo model of anxiety.<br>
	A compound of formula I may be prepared by processes which include processes known in the chemical art for the production of structurally analogous compounds or by a novel process described herein.  A novel process described herein provides another aspect of the invention.  A process for the preparation of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and novel intermediates for the manufacture of a compound of formula I provide further features of the invention and are illustrated by the following procedures in which the meaning of the generic radicals are as defined above, unless otherwise specified.  <br>
	Generally, a compound of formula I may be prepared from a compound of formula III (Scheme 1).  More specifically, a compound of formula II where R1 is C1-C3 alkyl is coupled with a 2-Q’-pyridyl where Q’ represents a suitable coupling group in the presence of a coupling catalyst to provide a compound of formula I where R1 is C1-C3 alkyl .  The suitability of the coupling group Q’ is guided by the reaction conditions employed.  For reactions employing Suzuki conditions, the values of Q’ include boronic ester and acid derivatives whereas employing Stille conditions, the values of Q’ include trialkylstannanyl derivatives.  Further coupling reactions include those employing Negishi conditions where the values of Q’ include zinc halides such as zinc bromide.  Coupling catalysts include transition metal agents such as palladium derivatives.  <br>

Example 23<br>
Synthesis of (1R,2R)-2-methyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid [4-(6-isopropyl-pyridin-2-yl)-3-(2-methyl-2H-indazol-5-yl)-isothiazol-5-yl]-amide.<br>
	Equip a 3 L 3-neck round bottom flask with overhead agitation, thermocouple, condenser, heating mantle, and nitrogen purge.  Charge the flask with (1R,2R)-2-methyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid [4-bromo-3-(2-methyl-2H-indazol-5-yl)-isothiazol-5-yl]-amide (96 g, 0.25 moles) and THF (1 L).  Add 2-isopropyl-6-(tributylstannyl)pyridine (182 g, 0.44 moles) and agitate.  Sparge with nitrogen at sub-surface for 20 minutes.  Add bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (II) chloride (8.62 g, 0.012 moles) and continue nitrogen sparge for 5 minutes.  Switch sparge to a nitrogen purge and heat the vessel contents to reflux.<br>
	Stir the reaction mixture for 3 days at reflux condition (ca. 37% starting material remaining by LCMS).  Cool the reaction mixture to 35 °C, degas for 15 min, and add additional palladium catalyst (1 mol %).  Stir the reaction for 2 days at reflux condition (22% starting material remaining by LC/MS).  Cool the reaction mixture to 35 °C, degas for 15 min, and add additional palladium catalyst (4 mol %).  Stir the reaction for 2 days at reflux (13% starting material remaining by LC/MS).  Cool the reaction mixture to 35 °C, degas for 15 min, and add additional palladium catalyst (5 mol %).  Stir the reaction for 4.5 hours at reflux (11% starting material remained by LC/MS).  Cool the reaction mixture to 35 °C, degas for 15 min, and add additional palladium catalyst (5 mol %).  Once again stir for 15 hours at reflux (ca. 6% starting material remaining by LC/MS).  Concentrate the solution in vacuo to remove solvent.  Treat the resulting slurry with toluene (2 L) and 1 N HCl (1 L).  Filter the biphasic mixture through Celite®.  Separate the layers and back-extract the organic layer with 1 N HCl (1 L X 3).  Combine the aqueous layers and extract with toluene (1 L).  Subsequently, treat the aqueous layer with toluene (2 L) and 5 N NaOH to pH=11.  Separate the layers and extract the aqueous layer with toluene (1 L X 2).  Wash the combined organic layers with brine (700 mL), dry over sodium sulfate, and filter.  Evaporate the filtrate in vacuo to afford the crude product as a yellow oil (78 g, 63% purity).  Purify the crude material by flash chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate/hexanes) to provide the title product.  Further purify by crystallization from ethyl acetate and hexanes.  Combine lots and treat with toluene (500 mL) and 1 N HCl (250 mL).  Separate the layers and back-extract with 1 N HCl (3 x 250 mL).  Combine the aqueous layers and extract with toluene (300 mL).  Treat the aqueous layer with toluene (500 mL) and 5 N NaOH to pH=11.  Separate the layers and extract the aqueous layer with toluene (2 x 500 mL).  Wash the combined organic layers with brine (200 mL), dry over sodium sulfate, and filter.  Concentrate the filtrate in vacuo.  Crystallize the resulting residue from ethyl acetate and hexanes to provide 40 g of the title compound as a white solid.  mp = 142°-144 °C.  MS (ES), m/z 432 (M+1). <br><br><br><br>
