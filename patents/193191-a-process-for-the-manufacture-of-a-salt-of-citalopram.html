The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a salt of citalopram.<br>
The present invention relates to the crystalline base of the well known antidepressant drug citalopram, 1 -[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]- l-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuran-carbonitrile, formulations of said base, a process for the preparation of purified salts of citalopram, such as the hydro bromide, using the base, the salts obtained by said process and formulations containing such salts.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. &amp; Biol. Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75 ,478-486. The compound has further been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A-474580.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,013, corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram by one method and outlines a further method, which may be used for preparing citalopram. The citalopram prepared was isolated as the oxalate, the hydrobromide and the hydrochloride salt, respectively. Furthermore, the citalopram base was obtained as an oil (B.P. 175 C/0.03 mmHg). Citalopram is marketed as the hydrobromide and the hydrochloride, respectively.<br>
A number of processes for the preparation of citalopram have been disclosed. In many of these, the last step of the process is a conversion of a group different from cyan in the 5 position of the direct analogue of citalopram to a 5-cyano group. So citalopram has been prepared by:<br><br>
Exchange of 5-halogen, or 5-CF3-(CF2)n-S02-0- with cyano (DE 2,657,013 and do-pending<br>
WO 0011926 and WO 0013648)<br>
Conversion of a 5-amido or 5-ester group to a 5-cyano group (WO 9819513)<br>
Conversion of a 5-amino group to a 5-cyano group (WO 9819512)<br>
Conversion of a 5-formyl group to a 5-cyano group (WO 9900548)<br>
Conversion of a 5-oxazolinyl or 5-thiazolinyl group to a 5-cyano group (WO 0023431)<br>
Other processes for the preparation of citalopram comprise exchange of the 5-bromo group of l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuranbromide with 5-cyano followed by alkylamino with a 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-halogenide (DE 2,657,013 and WO 9819511).<br>
Many of the processes mentioned above have the disadvantage that it is difficult to separate the intermediates formed during the process (the intermediates mentioned above or earlier intermediates) from the end product and, accordingly, extensive purification procedures involving loss of citalopram are required in order to obtain the necessary quality of the end product.<br>
It has now been found that the base of citalopram may be obtained as a very nice and pure crystalline product, which may easily be handled and conveniently be formulated into tablets and other pharmaceutical forms. Furthermore, it has surprisingly been found that a very good and efficient purification of citalopram may be obtained during manufacture of citalopram (e.g. of the hydrobromide or the hydrochloride salt) by crystallising the base, and thereafter optionally forming a salt from the base.<br>
This purification process is particularly useful for removing intermediates which are structurally closely related to citalopram, in particular compounds which only differ from citalopram by the subsistent situated in position 5 on the isobenzofurane ring, and intermediates which have physical/chemical properties which are close to those of citalopram, e.g. the l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuranes having halogen (in particular bromide and chloride), an amide or an ester in position 5 of the isobenzofurane ring, or 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-l ,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuranbromide, or -cloride.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a salt of citalopram comprising: (a) preparing a crude mixture or a crude salt of citalopram by subjecting substituted l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuran of the formula<br><br>
wherein Z is halogen, -O-S02-(CF2),.-CF3, wherein n is 0-8, -CHO, -NHR\ -COOR^ -CONR2R3 wherem R' and R^ is selected from hydrogen optionally substituted alkyl, a alkyl or aryl and R' is hydrogen or alkyl carbonyl, to a cyanide exchange reaction with a known cyanide source and optionally converting the crude mixture containing citalopram to a crude salt of citalopram in a known manner; (b) setting free the base of citalopram from the crude salt or the crude mixture of citalopram in a known manner; (c) dissolving said crude salt or the crude mixture of citalopram of step (b) in a polar protic or paretic solvent, precipitating and separating citalopram base therefrom, optionally re-crystallizing said base at least once; and (d) converting citalopram base into a salt thereof in known manner.<br>

citalopram, by precipitating citalopram base in crystalline form, optionally re-crystallising said base one or more times and/or transferring said base into a salt thereof<br>
The crude mixture of citalopram containing the compound of formula n as an impurity may be prepared by subjecting a compound of formula II to a cyanide exchange reaction with a cyanide source, or by subjecting l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuranhalogenide, in particular the bromide, to a cyanide exchange reaction followed by alkylation with a 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-halogenide.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, Z is halogen, in particular bromide or chloride.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the salt prepared is the hydrobromide or hydrochloride salt of citalopram.<br>
The crude salt may be any convenient salt, such as the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulphate, oxalate, phosphate, nitrate or any other convenient salt. Other salts are salts of organic acids.<br>

The terms "crude salt" and "crude mixture" refer to the fact that the salt and the mixture, respectively, comprise impurities, in particular impurities of formula II, which must be removed or which it is desired to remove.<br>
The crude salt may be a salt separated directly from the reaction mixture, or the crude reaction mixture may have been subjected to some initial purification, e.g. one re-crystallization, and /or treatment with activated carbon or silica gel, and the salt formed subsequently by treatment with an acid using methods known in the art. The salt may be isolated by precipitation or it may exist in a solvent, e.g. in the mixture resulting directly from the synthesis of the salt.<br>
Similarly, the crude mixture comprising citalopram may be obtained directly from the synthesis of the compound according to any of the above mentioned processes or it may have been subjected to some initial or simultaneous purification, e.g. one re-crystallisation, treatment with activated carbon or silica gel.<br>
The base of citalopram may be set free from the crude salt by dissolving the crude salt in a mixture of water and an organic solvent and then adding a base. The organic solvent may be toluene, ethyl acetate or any other suitable solvent and the base may be any convenient base, preferably NaOH or NH3. Likewise, the base of citalopram may, if necessary, be set free from a crude mixture containing citalopram by fragment with a base.<br>
Crude mixtures containing citalopram base may be subjected to further purification and extraction, before the base is precipitated in crystalline form. The base of citalopram may be isolated by separation of the organic phase, evaporation of the solvent in order to obtain the base most probably as an oil and then crystallisation of the base from an aprotic solvent, such as an alkane, including n-heptane’s, hexane and isooctane, and high and low boiling petroleum ethers and substituted aromates, inkle toluene and xylenes. Crystalline citalopram base may be re-crystallised from the same solvents.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salt of citalopram, such as the hydrobromide or hydrochloride, may be prepared by methods known in the art. So, the base may be reacted with either the calculated amount of acid in a water miscible solvent, such as acetone or ethanol, with subsequent isolation of the salt by concentration and cooling, or with an excess of the acid in a water immiscible solvent, such as cthylether, ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, with the salt separating spontaneously.

The temperature ranges are dependent upon the reaction type. If no catalyst is present, preferred temperatures are in the range of 100-200°C. However, when the reaction is conducted under the influence of microwaves, the temperature-e in the reaction mixture may raise to above 300 °C. More preferred temperature ranges are between 120-170°C. The most preferred range is 130-150°C. If catalyst is present, the preferred temperature range is between 0 and 100°C. More preferred are temperature ranges of 40-90°C. Most preferred temperature ranges are between 60-90°C.<br>
Other reaction conditions, solvents, etc. are conventional conditions for such reactions and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
When Z is CI or Br, the conversion to a cyano group may also be carried out by reaction with a cyanide source, for example KCN, Na2J, CuCN, Zn(CN)2 or (R'*)4NCN where (R'*)4 indicates four groups which may be the same or different and are selected from hydrogen and straight chain or branched alkyl, in the presence of a nickel catalyst.<br>

When Z is CHO, the conversion to a cyano group may be carried out by conversion of the formal group to an oxide or similar group by reaction with a reagent R6-V-NH2 wherein R6 is hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl and V is O, N or S, followed by dehydration with a common dehydrating agent, for example thionylchloride, acetic anhydride/pyridine, pyridine/HCl or phosphor pentachloride. Preferred reagents R*-V-NH2 are hydroxylamin and compounds wherein R6 is alkyl or aryl and V is N or O.<br>
When Z is -COOH, the conversion to a cyano group may be carried out via the corresponding acid chloride, ester or amide.<br>
The acid chloride is conveniently obtained by treatment of the acid with POCI3, PCI5 or SOCI2 neat or in a suitable solvent, such as toluene or toluene comprising a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide. The ester is obtained by treatment of the acid with an alcohol, in the presence of an acid, preferably a mineral acid or a Lewis acid, such as HCl, H2SO4, POCI3, PCI5 or SOCI2. Alternatively, the ester may be obtained from the acid chloride by reaction with an alcohol. The ester or the acid chloride is then converted to an amide or by amidation with ammonia or an alkylamine, preferably t-butyl amine.<br>
The conversion to amide may also be obtained by reaction of the ester with ammonia or an alkylamine under pressure and heating.<br>
The amide group is then converted to a cyano group by dehydration. The dehydrating agent may be any suitable dehydrating agent, and the optimal agent may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art. Examples of suitable dehydrating agents are SOCI2, POCI3 and PCI5, preferably SOCI2.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the carboxylic acid is reacted with an alcohol, preferably ethanol, in the presence of POCI3, in order to obtain the corresponding ester, which is then reacted with ammonia thereby giving the corresponding amide, which in turn is reacted with SOCI2 in toluene comprising a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Alternatively, a compound where Z is -COOH may be reacted with chlorosulfonyl isocyanides in order to form the nitrile, or treated with a dehydrating agent and a sulfonamide.<br>
When Z is -NHR', where R' is hydrogen, the conversion into cyano is preferably performed by diazotation and followed by reaction with OT. Most preferably NaN02 and CuCN and/or NaCN are used. When R' is alkylcarbonyl, it is initially subjected to hydrolysis thereby obtaining the corresponding compound wherein R' is H which is the converted as described above. The hydrolysis may be performed either in acidic or basic environment.<br>
The compounds of formula (H) may be prepared as described in DE 2,657,013, WO 0011926 and WO 0013648, WO 9819513, WO 9819512 and WO 9900548.<br>
Throughout this specification with claims halogen means chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>
The term alkyl refers to a branched or entrenched alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, and 2-methyl-l-propyl.<br>
The term aryl refers to a carbocyclic aromatic group, in particular phenyl. Aralkyl refers to an arylalkyl group wherein aryl and alkyl is as defined above. The aryl and aralkyl groups may optionally be substituted, e.g. with alkyl groups, forming for example tolyl.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in any suitable way and in any suitable form, for example orally in the form of tablets, capsules, powders or syrups, or parenterally in the form of usual sterile solutions for injection. Preferably the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered orally.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting machine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Com starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvant or additive colourings, aroma, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients.<br><br>
In particular, the formulations according to the invention may be prepared by direct compression of citalopram in admixture with conventional adjuvants or diluents. Alternatively, a wet granulate or a melt granulate of citalopram, optionally in admixture with conventional adjuvants or diluents may be used for compression of tablets.<br>
Solutions for injections may be prepared by solving the active ingredient and possible additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to the desired volume, sterilisation of the solution and filling in suitable ampoules or vials. Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity agents, preservatives, antioxidants, etc.<br>
According to the present invention, the base of citalopram has been found to be crystalline with stable and nice white crystals and it has been found that the base may easily be crystallised in a very pure form. So for example more than 99.8% w/w pure citalopram base was obtained by crystallisation from up to 95% pure hydrobromide without further purification. Accordingly, the process of the invention for preparing salts of citalopram has been found to give the salts as very pure products of pharmaceutically acceptable quality. Accordingly, the yield may be improved substantially during the manufacture of citalopram.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the crystalline citalopram base may be formulated into very good and stable solid formulations with good release properties.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>

NaOH (60 ml, 5 N (aq)) is added and the mixture (pH&gt;10) is stirred for 15 min. before the phases are separated. The organic phase is washed with water (2x100 ml) and filtered through a pad of filter help. The volatiles are removed in vacuo and the title compound is obtained as an oil. n-Heptane (400 ml) is added and the mixture is heated to 70 °C. On cooling, crystals form.

Example 3<br>
Wet granulation and preparation of tablets<br>
The batch size was 200 g and the granulation was performed in a small-scale laboratory high shear mixer (Micromixer).<br><br>
Citalopram base was sieved through a sieve aperture of 0.3 mm. The ingredients of the intragranular phase (1 - 4 in Table 1) were mixed at 600 rpm. 25 ml of purified water (5) was added in 30 sec and the granulation terminated after a total processing time of 3 min. The granulate was wet sieved through a 0.7 mm sieve aperture and dried at 40 °C in 30 minutes to equilibrium relative humidity of I     32 %. The dried granulate was finally sieved through a 0.7 mm sieve aperture.<br>
The dried granulate was mixed for 3 minutes with the extragranular phase (6 - 7) in a Turbula mixer and finally mixed with the lubricant (8) for 30 sec.<br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
Melt granulation<br>
The batch size was 200 g. Citalopram base was sieved through a sieve aperture of 0.3 mm. The granulation was performed in a small-scale laboratory high shear mixer (Micrometer)<br>
The ingredients of the intra-granular phase (1 - 3 in Table 3) were mixed at 1200 rpm. The jacket temperature was 80 °C. The granulation process was terminated after 3.5 min. The granulate was sieved through a sieve aperture of 1.0 mm and mixed with the extra-granular phase (4, 5) for 3 min. and with the lubricant (6) for 30 sec.<br><br><br><br>
