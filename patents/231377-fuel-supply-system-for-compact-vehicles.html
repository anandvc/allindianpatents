COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR COMPACT VEHICLES"<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the   nature   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be Derformed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a fuel supply system for compact vehicles.<br>
o —<br>
[Technical Field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a compact vehicle in<br>
which a power unit having an engine with the cylinder portion<br>
inclined toward the front is vertically swingably suspended<br>
on the body frame at the position rearwardly of the step floor,<br>
a rear wheel is rotatably supported at the rear end portion<br>
of the power unit so as to be driven thereby, a luggage box<br>
and a passenger seat are disposed upwardly of the power unit,<br>
and a fuel tank having a fuel port on the top wall thereof is<br>
disposed immediately below the step floor,  and more<br>
specifically to an improved fuel supply system for supplying<br>
fuel in a fuel tank to a fuel injection valve of the engine.<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
Such compact vehicle is already known as disclosed for example in JP-A-2001-138759.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the compact vehicle disclosed in the above described publication, an opening for inserting a fuel supply unit is provided on the rear end wall of the fuel tank, and an fuel distribution pipe to be disposed at the opening and the fuel injection valve of the engine are connected by a flexible fuel conduit. In such arrangement, since the distance between the fuel distribution pipe and the fuel injection valve is<br>
■3-2-<br><br>
relatively short, it is necessary to elongate the length of the fuel conduit and to provide a deflecting portion on the partway thereof in order to prevent the deflecting angle of the fuel conduit from being excessive when the power unit is swung in the vertical direction. In this case, however, when the radius of curvature of the deflecting portion is set to large values to minimize the resistance in the flow path of the fuel conduit, interference is apt to occur between the fuel conduit and the adjacent members. On the other hand, when the radius of curvature of the aforementioned deflecting portion is set to small values to avoid interference with the adjacent members, resistance in the flow path of the fuel conduit increases. Therefore, formation of the deflecting portion has been a great struggle. [0004]<br>
With such circumstances in view, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel supply system for compact vehicles in which the radius of curvature of the deflecting portion of the fuel conduit is set to a large value to reduce resistance in the flow path thereof, while avoiding interference with the adjacent members, so that a deflecting angle of the fuel conduit formed when the power unit swings in the vertical direction can be minimized. [0005] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
.4-3<br><br>
In order to achieve the object described above, according to the present invention, in a compact vehicle in which a power unit having an engine with the cylinder portion inclined toward the front is vertically swingably suspended on the body frame at the position rearwardly of the step floor, a rear wheel is rotatably supported at the rear end portion of the power unit so as to be driven thereby, a luggage box and a passenger seat are disposed upwardly of the power unit, and a fuel tank having a fuel port on the top wall thereof is disposed immediately below the step floor, the first characteristic is that a fuel exit cylinder of a fuel supply unit disposed in the fuel tank for supplying fuel to the outside is disposed in the fuel tank at the position forwardly of the fuel port, and the fuel exit cylinder and the fuel injection valve of the engine are connected by a flexible fuel conduit passing alongside the fuel port.<br>
[0006]<br>
According to the first characteristic, since the fuel conduit is passed from the fuel distribution pipe positioned forwardly of the fuel port through the side of the fuel port to the rear portion of the vehicle, and then curved toward the front while forming a deflecting portion having a large radius of curvature and extends to the fuel injection valve, resistance in the flow path may be lowered, interference with the adjacent members may be avoided, and the angle of deflection<br><br>
of the fuel conduit when the power unit swings in the vertical direction may be minimized.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition to the first characteristic, the second characteristic of the present invention is that the fuel injection valve is attached with a fuel connector to be registered and fixed on the engine, and the fuel conduit is connected to the connecting pipe that is fixed to the fuel connector and communicates with the fuel injection valve.<br>
[0008]<br>
According to the second characteristic, the direction of connection of the fuel conduit to the fuel connector attached to the fuel injection valve is unified and the piping of the fuel conduit can be made easily while preventing displacement of the fuel conduit.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the first and second characteristics, the third characteristic of the present invention is that the fuel supply unit in the fuel tank is provided with a fuel pump for pumping fuel toward the fuel exit cylinder, and a pressure regulator for relieving excessive discharge pressure.<br>
[0010]<br>
According to the third characteristic, since fuel discharged from the pressure regulator can be returned to the fuel tank as it is, a specific piping for returning fuel is<br>
*~5<br><br>
not necessary, thereby contributing to simplification of the structure.<br>
[0011]<br>
In addition to any one of the first to the third characteristics, the fourth characteristic of the present invention is that the fuel distribution pipe connected to the fuel conduit is detachably joined to the fuel exit cylinder of the fuel supply unit via a joint.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the fourth characteristic, by disengaging the fuel distribution pipe from the fuel exit cylinder of the fuel supply unit, connection and piping of the fuel conduit to the fuel injection valve can be performed easily and even maintenance of the fuel supply unit can be done easily without being interfered by the fuel conduit. In addition, connection of the fuel distribution pipe to the fuel supply unit can be made quickly and easily, thereby contributing to the improvement of assembling property.<br>
[0013]<br>
In addition to any one of the first to fourth characteristics, the fifth characteristic of the present invention is that the fuel supply unit is provided with a fuel filter for filtering discharged fuel from the fuel pump in the vicinity of the inner end of the fuel exit cylinder, and the fuel filter is formed with a recess to which the inner end of<br>
^ L<br><br>
the fuel distribution pipe faces on the upper end plate thereof.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the fifth characteristic, since the fuel distribution pipe can be disposed in the vicinity of the fuel filter, interference between the fuel conduit and the step floor can be avoided easily by reducing the amount of upward projection of the fuel distribution pipe from the fuel tank.<br>

In this case, the fuel supply unit 22 is disposed on the front portion of the fuel tank 18, that is, forwardly of the tank cap 21.<br>
[0022]<br>
*e- If<br><br>
The step floor 12 supported by the floor supporting portion 2c is disposed so as to cover the fuel tank 18, and portions of the tank cap 21 or fuel supply unit 22 projected from the upper surface of the fuel tank 18 is accommodated in the upwardly swelled portion 12a formed at the center thereof.<br>
[0023]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4 through Fig .9, the aforementioned fuel supply unit 22 will be described.<br>
[0024]<br>
The fuel supply unit 22 is constructed of an electric motor-driven type fuel pump 25 immersed in the fuel oil so as to pump fuel in the fuel tank 18, a fuel strainer 26 connected to the inlet port 25a of the fuel pump 25, a fuel filter 27 communicating with the discharge port 25b of the fuel pump 25, a pressure regulator 28 for adjusting discharge pressure of the fuel pump 25, a fuel level sensor 29, a pump holder 30 for storing and holding the fuel pump 25, a supporting bracket 31 mounted on the top wall 18b of the fuel tank 18 while supporting the pump holder 30, and a filer housing 32 held between the supporting bracket 31 and the pump holder 30 for storing the fuel filter 27. These components will be described sequentially in detail.<br>
[0025]<br>
In Fig. 4 to Fig. 7 and Fig. 9, the supporting bracket 31 includes a disc-shaped mounting flange 35 formed of<br>
■a*- CL<br><br>
synthetic resin, a fuel exit cylinder 36 formed integrally with the mounting flange 35 and projecting from the upper and lower surfaces thereof, a plurality (a pair in the figure) of first supporting arms 37, 37 projected integrally on the lower surface of the mounting flange 35, and a plurality (a pair in the figure) of second supporting arms 38, 38 formed of steel plate for being joined to the lower surface of the mounting flange 35 by molding, and the fuel exit cylinder 36 is detachably joined with a elbow-shaped fuel distribution pipe 39 from above via a joint 40. The lower surface of the mounting flange 35 is provided with an annular sealing groove 41 in the vicinity of the outer peripheral edge thereof, to which the sealing member 42 is fitted.<br>
[0026]<br>
On the other hand, the top wall 18b of the fuel tank 18 is formed with an opening 43 having smaller diameter than the aforementioned annular sealing groove 41 at the position offset from the longitudinal centerline Y of the fuel tank 18 to one of left and right sides by a prescribed distance A, and a shallow annular recess 44 is formed on the upper surface of the top wall 18b so as to surround the opening 43, and an annular body having a plurality of locking claws 45, 45...projecting radially inwardly from the peripheral edge of the recess 44 is welded on the top wall 18b. Therefore, by inserting and mounting the first and second supporting arms 37, 38 in the<br>
"-13<br><br>
opening 43, storing the mounting flange 35 in the recess 44, and rotating the lock ring 46 for pressing the upper surface of the mounting flange 35 by a prescribed angle, the locking claws 45, 45... engage the plurality of engaging portions 46a, 46a... of the lock ring 4 6, and the mounting flange 3 5 is secured at the fixed position on the fuel tank 18 while adhering the sealing member 42 to the top wall 18b thereof, whereby the opening 43 can be closed.<br>
[0027]<br>
As is clearly shown in Fig. 9, when the mounting flange 35 is fixed to the fixed position of the fuel tank 18, the fuel exit cylinder 36 is offset from the centerline of the flange 35 in the same direction as the offset direction of the opening 43 with respect to the aforementioned centerline Y of the fuel tank 18 by a prescribed distance B.<br>
[0028]<br>
The plurality of first supporting arms 37, 37 are disposed on a circle E surrounding the fuel exit cylinder 36 and being concentric thereto at regular intervals, and the plurality of second supporting arms 38, 38 are disposed on the circle F passing outside the first supporting arms 37, 37 and being concentric to the mounting flange 35 at a regular intervals. The first and second supporting arms 37, 38 are provided with locking holes 37a, 38a respectively.<br>
[0029]<br>
Jr3-)V<br><br>
The joint 40 includes, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, a resilient tubular portion 49 formed of synthetic resin for being locked to an annular projection 48 on the outer peripheral surface of the fuel distribution pipe 39, a pair of finger grip portions 50, 50 projecting from the upper end of the tubular portion 49, and locking claws 61, 61 projected from the outer peripheral surface of the tubular portion 49 in the vicinity of these finger grip portions 50, 50. On the other hand, a pair of locking holes 62, 62 corresponding to the locking claws 61, 61 are provided on the upper portion of the fuel exit cylinder 36, and an annular sealing member 63 is fitted on the inner periphery of the fuel exit cylinder 36. when the fuel distribution pipe 39 is inserted into the fuel exit cylinder 36 from above, the outer peripheral surface of the tip portion of the fuel distribution pipe 39 comes into close contact with the sealing member 63, and the locking claws 61, 61 of the joint 40 fitted into the fuel exit cylinder 36 resiliently engage the locking holes 62, 62 of the fuel exit cylinder 36, so that the fuel distribution pipe 39 is joined to the fuel exit cylinder 36. Since the locking claws 61, 61 come apart from the locking holes 62, 62 by pressing the finger grip portions 50, 50 radially inwardly, the fuel distribution pipe 39 can be pulled out from the fuel exit cylinder 36.<br>
[0030]<br>
In Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, a filter housing 32 for storing<br>
14- 15<br><br>
the fuel filter 27 includes a cylindrical upper housing half 32a having an upper communication tube 65 integrally formed on the upper end surface, and a lower housing half 32b having a lower communication tube 66 integrally formed on the lower end surface and being welded to the upper housing half 32a, and the outer peripheral surface of the upper housing half 32a is provided with a plurality of locking claws 67, 67 projected therefrom corresponding to the locking holes 37a, 37a of the aforementioned first supporting arms 37, 37. The upper communication tube 65 is fitted on the outer peripheral surface of the lower end portion of the aforementioned fuel exit cylinder 36 via a sealing member 71, and simultaneously, the locking claws 67, 67 resiliently engage the locking holes 37a, 37a of the first supporting arms 37, 37.<br>
[0031]<br>
The fuel filter 27 in the filter housing 32 is constructed by joining the upper and the lower end plates 69, 70 on the both end surfaces of the hollow cylindrical filter element 68. The upper and the lower end plates 69, 70 are formed of recesses 69a, 70a recessed toward the filter element 68 side, and the lower end plate 70 is formed with a through hole 73 communicating between the outside and the inside on the recess 70a. The fuel distribution pipe 39 connected to the aforementioned fuel exit cylinder 36 via the joint 40 is disposed in such a manner that the inner end thereof faces<br>
«• /£<br><br>
toward the recess 69a of the upper end plate 69.<br>
[0032]<br>
The fuel filter 27 is held between the bottom surface of the lower housing half 32b and a plurality of ribs 74, 74 — radially formed on the top surface of the upper housing half 32a, and fuel flown into the filter element 68 from the lower communication tube 66 through the through hole 73 passes radially outwardly through the filter element 68, then passes through the fuel passage defined between the plurality of ribs 74, 74..., and then transferred to the fuel distribution pipe 39. In this case, the presence of the recess 69a toward which the inner end of the fuel distribution pipe 39 joined to the fuel exit cylinder 36 faces on the upper end plate 69 enables the fuel distribution pipe 39 and the fuel filter 27 to be disposed close to each other without narrowing down the fuel passage therebetween.<br>
[0033]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, a pump holder 30 includes a cylindrical pump holding cylinder 75 for storing and holding a likewise cylindrical electric motor-driven fuel pump 25, a flange portion 76 continuing to an end of the pump holding cylinder 75, and a plurality (a pair in the example shown in the figure) of joining arms 77, 77 projecting from the flange portion 76 toward the aforementioned second supporting arms 38, 38. The supporting bracket 31 and the pump holder 30 are<br>
*-/?-<br><br>
joined with each other by resiliently engaging the locking claws 77a, 77a projecting from the outer side surface of the joining arms 77 with the locking holes 38a, 38a of the second supporting arms 38, 38 while inserting the joining arms 77, 77 into the inner side surfaces of the aforementioned second supporting arms 38, 38.<br>
[0034]<br>
On the upper surface of the flange portion 76 of the pump holder 30, there is formed an opening of a communication path 80 continuing into the discharge port 25b of the fuel pump 25, and the lower communication tube 66 of the filter housing 32 is fitted into the opening via the sealing member 72, so that fuel discharged from the fuel pump 25 is received. With such arrangement, the communication path 80 between the fuel pump 25 and the fuel filter 27 can be shortened and thus pressure loss can be reduced.<br>
[0035]<br>
The pump holding cylinder 75 is disposed so as to extend from one side of the flange portion 76 toward the rear of the vehicle substantially horizontally, and thus the electric motor-driven fuel pump 25 held thereby takes the same posture correspondingly. Therefore, the fuel supply unit 22 is configured in the shape of a letter L as a hole. The pump holding cylinder 75 is, as clearly shown in Fig. 4, disposed in such a manner that the axis thereof is offset toward either<br>
*T)S<br><br>
one of the left and the right sides of the longitudinal centerline Y of the fuel tank 18 by the distance B from the centerline of the mounting flange 35 in plan view as in the case of the fuel exit cylinder 36.<br>
[0036]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, the fuel strainer 26 is connected to the inlet port 25a opening at the rear end of the fuel pump 25. The fuel strainer 26 is stored in an anti-turbulence box 82 mounted on the outer periphery of the pump holding cylinder 75 and opened on the upper surface thereof. The anti-turbulence box 82 is to be disposed on the bottom portion of the fuel tank 18, and has an entrance 82a at the front portion opposite from the opening side of the inlet port 25a of the fuel pump 25, and a mazy wall 83 extending from one side of the entrance 82a to the position near the rear wall of the anti-turbulence box 82 is provided uprisingly on the bottom of the anti-turbulence box 82, so that fuel entered through the entrance 82a is damped and sucked by the fuel pump 25.<br>
[0037]<br>
In Fig. 2, Fig. 4 and Fig. 7, integrally formed on the bottom of the lower housing half 32b of the aforementioned filter housing 32 is an upper supporting tube 85 communicating with the interior thereof, and an lower supporting tube 86 to be fitted on the outer peripheral surface of the upper<br>

supporting tube 85 at the upper end portion is formed integrally with the pump holder 30. On these supporting tubes 85, 86, the cylindrical pressure regulator 28 is attached from below. In this case, both of the supporting tubes 85, 86 and the pressure regulator 28 are disposed in such a manner that the axis thereof is offset toward the opposite direction from the offset direction of the fuel exit cylinder 36 with respect to the center of the mounting flange 35 by a prescribed distance C. The pressure regulator 28 is constructed in such a manner that when the pressure in the filter housing 32, that is, the discharge pressure of the fuel pump 25 exceeds a prescribed value, the excessive fuel is discharged downward. The aforementioned fuel pump 25 disposed substantially horizontally is disposed in substantially flush with the pressure regulator 28.<br>
[0038]<br>
The fuel level sensor 29 includes a sensor housing 90 to be mounted on the wall on one side of the pump holding cylinder 75, a float supporting arm 91 swingably supported by the sensor housing 90 and extending toward the rear of the vehicle, a float 92 mounted on the tip portion 91a of the float supporting arm 91, and a potentiometer 93 stored in the sensor housing 90 for converting rotational angles of the float supporting arm 91 into the quantity of electricity as a fuel level in the fuel tank 18. In this case, the sensor housing<br>
-1-9- 20<br><br>
90 is mounted on the sidewall located on the opposite side from the offset direction of the pump holding cylinder 75 with respect to the center of the mounting flange 35. The float supporting arm 91 is bent and extends toward the rear from the position immediately out of the outer wall of the sensor housing 90, and the tip portion 91a thereof is bent into the shape of a letter L so as to extend away from the pump holding cylinder 75 in the lateral direction. On the tip portion 91a, a float 92 elongated in the bent direction thereof is mounted.<br>
[0039]<br>
Referring back to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 again, the mounting flange 35 is formed with a first and a second wiring couplers 95, 96 projected from both of the upper and lower surfaces of the flange 35 and disposed side by side at the position offset from the center line thereof toward the direction opposite from the fuel exit cylinder 36, and in addition, the inner end portions of both of the wiring couplers 95, 96 are disposed in the space upwardly of the aforementioned pressure regulator 28. Both of the wiring couplers 95, 96 are provided with connecting terminals 97, 98 passing therethrough in the vertical direction. Connectors (not shown) of leads to be connected to the above-described electric motor-driven fuel pump 25 and the fuel level sensor 29 are connected to the lower portions of the first and the second wiring couplers 95, 96, and the external wiring couplers (not shown) continuing to the<br><br>
power switch and/or the fuel level indicator are connected to the upper portions of these wiring couplers 95, 96.<br>
[0040]<br>
In the construction above, the fuel exit cylinder 36, the filter housing 32, and the upper and lower supporting tube 85, 86 are disposed in the range of the picture plane of the opening 43 to enable insertion thereof through the opening 43 of the fuel tank 18.<br>
[0041]<br>
In Fig. 2 and Fig. 10, an air intake path member 102 having an air intake path 101 continuing to the air intake port 100 is joined to the upper surface of the cylinder portion 9a of the aforementioned engine 9 with a bolt. The air intake path member 102 is attached with a fuel injection valve 103 for injecting fuel toward the downstream of the air intake port 100, and a cup-shaped fuel connector 105 is fitted on the upper end portion having an opening of the fuel inlet. The fuel connector 105 is secured at its stay 105a projecting from the rear wall thereof to the fixed position on the air intake path member 102 with a bolt 106. The fuel connector 105 is provided with a connecting pipe 105b projecting rearward or obliquely rearward of the vehicle, and the connecting pipe 105b and the fuel distribution pipe 39 of the aforementioned fuel supply unit 22 are fixedly connected to both ends of the flexible fuel conduit 107. In this way, the fuel conduit 107 is disposed<br>
#rxi-<br><br>
so as to extend from the fuel distribution pipe 39 though the side of the tank cap 21 toward the rear of the vehicle linearly lengthways, and makes a U-turn after passing once through the position of the fuel connector 105 rearwardly to reach the fuel distribution pipe 39.<br>
[0042]<br>
Subsequently, the operation of the embodiment will be described.<br>
[0043]<br>
When assembling the fuel supply unit 22, the fuel pump 25, the fuel strainer 26, the pressure regulator 28, and the fuel level sensor 29 are mounted on the pump holder 30, and on the other hand, a filter housing 32 is mounted between the pair of first supporting arms 37, 37 of the supporting bracket 31, and the pair of connecting arms 77, 77 of the pump holder 30 are inserted inside the pair of second supporting arms 38, 38. Then, the locking claws 77a, 77a of the connecting arms 77 engage the locking holes 38a, 38a of the second supporting arms 38, 38, so that the supporting bracket 31 and the pump holder 30 are joined together, and a filter housing 32 can be held therebetween. As described above, since a specific fixing member is not necessary for joining the supporting bracket 31 and the pump holder 30, the assembling property of the fuel supply unit 22 is quite preferable.<br>
[0044]<br>
^*"7.2&gt;<br><br>
The completely assembled fuel supply unit 22 is inserted into the opening 43 of the top wall 18b of the fuel tank 18 from the pump holding cylinder 75 side, and the fuel strainer 26 is installed on the bottom wall of the fuel tank 18 with the pump holding cylinder 75 faced toward the rear wall of the fuel tank 18. In this case, the mounting flange 35 of the supporting bracket 31 is adapted to be accommodated in the recess 44 on the upper surface of the fuel tank 18, and the lock ring 46 for holding the mounting flange 35 from above is engaged with the locking claws 45, 45..» to fix the supporting bracket 31 and the opening 43 is closed.<br>
[0045]<br>
On the other hand, the connecting pipe 105b and the fuel distribution pipe 39 of the fuel connector 105 are connected in advance to both ends of the fuel conduit 107 respectively. Then, the fuel connector 105 is fitted to the fuel injection valve 103 of the engine 9 and fixed to the air intake path member 102 at the fixed position with a bolt 106. when the fuel connector 105 is positioned by the bolt 106 in this manner, the connecting pipe 105b faces toward rear or obliquely toward the rear as prescribed. Therefore, by disposing the fuel conduit 107 alongside the tank cap 21 while drawing the fuel distribution pipe 39 forwardly, a prescribed U-turn portion is naturally formed at the rear portion of the fuel conduit 107. Subsequently, the fuel distribution pipe 39 is connected<br>
-a*aV<br><br>
contributing to the improvement of assembling property.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the fuel supply unit 22, since the upper end plate 69 of the fuel filter 27 to be disposed immediately below the fuel exit cylinder 36 is formed with the recess 69a toward which the inner end of the fuel distribution pipe 39 faces, the fuel distribution pipe 39 can be disposed in the vicinity of the fuel filter 27, and interference between the fuel conduit 107 and the step floor 12 can be avoided easily by reducing the amount of upward projection of the fuel distribution pipe 39 from the fuel tank 18.<br>
[0049]<br>
During operation of the engine 9, the fuel pump 25 sucks fuel in the fuel tank 18 through the fuel strainer 26, and discharges the same to the fuel filter 27. The fuel is, after filtered by the fuel filter 27, supplied to the fuel injection valve 103 through the fuel distribution pipe 39, the fuel conduit 107, and fuel connector 105 sequentially. During this fuel supply, when the discharge pressure of the fuel pump 25 exceeds a prescribed value, the pressure regulator 28 is actuated to discharge at excessively pressurized fuel directly into the fuel tank 18. Therefore, it is not necessary to connect a specific fuel returning pipe continuing to the fuel tank 18 to the pressure regulator 28, thereby simplifying the structure.<br>
25-2.k<br><br>
[0050]<br>
The fuel supply unit 22 is formed into substantially L-shape as a whole by placing the fuel filter 27 uprightly and the fuel pump 25 transversely, and disposing the fuel pump 25 in flush with the pressure regulator 28 that is disposed downwardly of the fuel filter 27 on one side. Therefore, the entire height may be effectively reduced and thus it may be effectively applied to the flat type fuel tank 18 disposed downwardly of the step floor 12.<br>
[0051]<br>
Since the fuel exit cylinder 36 and the filter housing 32 placed one above the other, and the wiring couplers 95, 96 and the pressure regulator 28 disposed one above the other are disposed at the positions offset from the centerline of the mounting flange 35 to the opposite direction with respect to each other, and the fuel pump 25 and the fuel level sensor 29 are disposed at the position offset from the centerline of the mounting flange 35 to the opposite direction with respect to each other, the diameter of mounting flange 35, and thus the diameter of the opening 43 of the fuel tank 18, may be reduced while enabling insertion of the fuel supply unit 22 into the fuel tank 18, whereby the fuel supply unit 22 may be easily mounted on the relatively narrow top wall 18b of the fuel tank 18. The load exerted on the mounting flange 35 may also be reduced.<br>
M-23-<br><br>
[0052]<br>
In addition, the mounting flange 35 of the fuel supply unit 22 is fixed on the fuel tank 18 so as to be offset toward either one of the left and the right sides of the longitudinal centerline Y thereof, and the fuel exit cylinder 36 is offset from the centerline of the mounting flange 35 in the same direction. In addition, the fuel level sensor 29 is mounted on the side wall of th£ pump holding cylinder 75 opposite from the above-described offset direction, and the tip portion of the float supporting arm 91 of the sensor 29 is bent in the L-shape in the opposite direction from the above-described offset direction to support the float 92. Therefore, the fuel level in the fuel tank 18 can be detected relatively accurately without being influenced by variation in fuel surface in the fuel tank 18 due to rolling of motorcycle 1 since the float 92 is consequently disposed in the vicinity of the longitudinal centerline of the fuel tank 18, and correlatively, the float 92 is elongated in the lateral direction of the vehicle.<br>
[0053]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modification in design may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
[0054]<br>
As is described thus far, according to the first characteristic of the present invention, in a compact vehicle<br>
-zrrS<br><br>
to the fuel exit cylinder 36 of the fuel supply unit 22 previously mounted on the fuel tank 18 via the joint 40. In this manner, the fuel conduit 107 can be piped easily without displacement.<br>
[0046]<br>
Accordingly/ the fuel conduit 107 is guided from the fuel distribution pipe 39 forwardly of the tank cap 21 through the side of the tank cap 21 toward the rear of the vehicle, and curved toward the front while forming a deflecting portion of large radius of curvature, and then extends toward the fuel injection valve 103, whereby resistance in the flow path may be lowered and interference with the adjacent members may be avoided. Accordingly, the deflecting angle of the fuel conduit 107 formed when the power unit 6 is swung in the vertical direction may be minimized, thereby being advantageous in securing its durability.<br>
[0047]<br>
When assembling, as described above, by disengaging the joint 40 from the fuel exit cylinder 36 of the fuel supply unit 22, connection and piping of the fuel conduit 107 to the fuel injection valve 103 can be performed easily and even maintenance of the fuel supply unit 22 can be done easily without being interfered by the fuel conduit 107. In addition, connection of the fuel distribution pipe 39 to the fuel supply unit 22 can be made quickly and easily via the joint 40, thereby<br>
^4-25"<br><br>
in which a power unit having an engine with the cylinder portion inclined toward the front is vertically swingably suspended on the body frame at the position rearwardly of the step floor, a rear wheel is rotatably supported at the rear end portion of the power unit so as to be driven thereby, a luggage box and a passenger seat are disposed upwardly of the power unit, and a fuel tank having a fuel port on the top wall thereof is disposed immediately below the step floor, since a fuel exit cylinder of a fuel supply unit disposed in the fuel tank for supplying fuel to the outside is disposed in the fuel tank at the position forwardly of the fuel port, and the fuel exit cylinder and the fuel injection valve of the engine are connected by a flexible fuel conduit passing alongside the fuel port, the fuel conduit is passed from the fuel distribution pipe positioned forwardly of the fuel port through the side of the fuel port to the rear portion of the vehicle, and then curved toward the front while forming a deflecting portion having a large radius of curvature and extends to the fuel injection valve, whereby resistance in the flow path may be lowered, interference with the adjacent members may be avoided, and the angle of deflection of the fuel conduit when the power unit swings in the vertical direction may be minimized.<br>
[0055]<br>
According to the second characteristic of the present invention, since the fuel injection valve is attached with a<br>
ttXJ)<br><br>
fuel connector to be registered and fixed on the engine, and the fuel conduit is connected to the connecting pipe that is fixed to the fuel connector and communicates with the fuel injection valve, the direction of connection of the fuel conduit to the fuel connector attached to the fuel injection valve is unified and the piping of the fuel conduit can be made easily while preventing displacement of the fuel conduit.<br>
[0056]<br>
According to the third characteristic of the present invention, since the fuel supply unit in the fuel tank is provided with a fuel pump for pumping fuel toward the fuel exit cylinder, and a pressure regulator for relieving excessive discharge pressure of the fuel pump, fuel discharged from the pressure regulator can be returned to the fuel tank as it is, and thus a specific piping for returning fuel is not necessary, thereby contributing to simplification of the structure.<br>
[0057]<br>
According to the fourth characteristic of the present invention, since the fuel distribution pipe connected to the fuel conduit is detachably joined to the fuel exit cylinder of the fuel supply unit via a joint, by disengaging the fuel distribution pipe from the fuel exit cylinder of the fuel supply unit, connection and piping of the fuel conduit to the fuel injection valve can be performed easily and even maintenance of the fuel supply unit can be done easily without being<br>
-23- SS<br><br>
interfered by the fuel conduit. In addition, connection of the fuel distribution pipe to the fuel supply unit can be made quickly and easily, thereby contributing to the improvement of assembling property.<br>
[0058]<br>
According to the fifth characteristic of the present invention, since the fuel supply unit is provided with a fuel filter for filtering discharged fuel from the fuel pump in the vicinity of the inner end of the fuel exit cylinder, and the fuel filter is formed with a recess to which the inner end of the fuel distribution pipe faces on the upper end plate thereof, the fuel distribution pipe can be disposed in the vicinity of the fuel filter, and thus interference between the fuel conduit and the step floor can be avoided easily by reducing the amount of upward projection of the fuel distribution pipe from the fuel tank.<br>
