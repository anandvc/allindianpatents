Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries Gam/AB/NT<br><br>
Hetarvl-substituted homotetramic and homotetronic acids<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   new   hetaryl-substituted   homotetramic   and<br>
5	homotetronic acids, to a plurality of processes for their preaparation, and to their use<br>
as pesticides, microbicides and herbicides.<br>
It   is    known   that   certain   tetrahydropyridones    have    herbicidal   properties:<br>
JP-A-0 832 530. Moreover, there are known specific 4-hydroxytetrahydropyridones<br>
10	which have acaricidal, insecticidal and herbicidal properties: JP-A-11 152 273.<br>
However, the activity and range of action of these compounds is not always entirely satisfactory, in particular when low application rates and concentrations are used. Furthermore, these compounds are not always sufficiently well tolerated by plants.<br>
15<br>
20<br>
It is furthermore known that certain 5,6-dihydropyrone derivatives, as protease inhibitors, have antiviral properties: WO 95/14012. Furthermore, 4-phenyl-6-(2-phenethyl)-5,6-dihydropyrone is known from the synthesis of kawalactone derivatives: Kappe et al.; Arch. Pharm. 309, 558-64, (1976). Moreover, 5,6-dihydropyrone derivatives are known as intermediates: White, J.D., Brenner, J.B., Deinsdale, M.J., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 93, 281-2 (1971). Applications in crop protection have not been described as yet.<br>

Depending on the nature of the substituents, the compounds of the formula (I) can<br>
exist as geometric and/or optical isomers or isomer mixtures of various<br>
compositions, and, if appropriate, these can be separated in the customary fashion.<br>
Not only the pure isomers, but also the isomer mixtures, their preparation and use<br>
30	and compositions comprising them are subject-matter of the present invention.<br>
However, the following text will, for the sake of simplicity, always mention<br><br><br><br>
compounds of the formula (I), even though this is understood as meaning not only the pure compounds, but also, if appropriate, mixtures with various amounts of isomeric compounds.<br>

exist in the two isomeric forms of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B),<br><br><br><br>
(I-A)<br>
which is expressed by the broken line in formula (I).<br><br>
10<br><br>
15<br>
20<br><br>
The compounds of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B) can exist not only as mixtures, but also in the form of their pure isomers. If appropriate, mixtures of the compounds of the formulae (I-A) and (I-B) can be separated in a manner known per se by physical methods, for example by chromatographic methods.<br>
The following text will only mention in each case one of the isomers which are possible, for the sake of clarity. This does not exclude that, if appropriate, the compounds may exist in the form of the isomer mixtures or in each case in the other isomeric form.<br>

10	If appropriate, the compounds according to the invention, in specific concentrations<br>
or at specific application rates, can also be used as herbicides and microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides. If appropriate, they may also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
15	All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are<br>
understood, in the present context, as meaning all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or else by biotechnological and recombinant<br>
20	methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and the<br>
plant varieties which can be protected or which cannot be protected by Plant Breeders' Rights. Plant parts are understood as meaning all aerial and subterraneous parts and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, with leaves, needles, stems, stalks, flowers, fruiting bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers<br>
25	and rhizomes being mentioned by way of example. The plant parts also include<br>
harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, shoots and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
30	compounds is affected directly or by acting on their environment or the surroundings<br>
in which they grow or in which they are stored, using customary treatment methods,<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br>
for example by immersion, spraying, atomizing, forging, spreading, brushing on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular seeds, furthermore by coating with one or more coats.<br>
5	The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspended emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compounds, and microencapsulations and polymeric substances.<br>
10<br>
These formulations are prepared in the known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, if appropriate using surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
15<br>
If water is used as extender, it is also possible, for example, to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics such as xylene, toluene, or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons,  such  as chlorobenzenes,  chloroethylenes or methylene chloride,<br>
20	aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, or paraffins, for example mineral oil<br>
fractions-, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.<br>
25<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example, ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays,<br>
talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground<br>
30	synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid<br>
carriers for granules are: for example, crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br>
calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic or<br>
organic meals and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells,<br>
maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for<br>
example, non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters,<br>
5	polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol  ethers,  for example  alkylaryl  polyglycol  ethers,<br>
alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example, lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
10	form of powders, granules or latices such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, and natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids may be used in the formulations. Other additives may be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
15	Colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide,<br>
Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin, azo and metal phthalocyanin dyes and micronutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc may be used.<br>
20	In general, the formulations comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations,<br>
may also be used in a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaridices,<br>
25	nematicides or insecticides, for example to widen the spectrum of action or to<br>
prevent the build-up of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects result, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the activity of the individual components.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds such as herbicides or with fertilizers and growth regulators is also possible.<br>
25<br>
When employed as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, may furthermore be present in a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds by which the action of the active compounds is increased without it being<br>
30	necessary for the synergist added to be active itself.<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br><br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commerically available  formulations   can   vary   within   wide   ranges.   The   active  compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight. 5<br>
They are applied in a customary manner adapted to suit the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene and stored-product pests, the active compound is<br>
distinguished by outstanding residual action on wood and clay and by good stability<br>
10	to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, all plants and their parts may be treated in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, plant species and plant varieties which occur in the wild or which have been obtained by conventional biological<br>
15	breeding methods, such as hybridization or protoplast fusion, and parts of these plant<br>
species and plant varieties are treated. In another preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant varieties which have been obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetic modified organisms), and parts of these plants and plant varieties are treated. The term "parts"<br>
20	and "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been illustrated above.<br>
Plants which are especially preferably treated in accordance with the invention are<br>
those of the plant varieties which are commercially available or in use. Plant varieties<br>
are understood as meaning plants with novel properties ("traits") which have been<br>
25	bred by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis and also be recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. They can take the form of varieties, biotypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location  and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition), superadditive ("synergistic")<br>
30	effects may also occur as a result of the treatment in accordance with the invention.<br>
Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widened spectrum of action<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br>
and/or an increased action of the substances and compositions which can be used in<br>
accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salinity, increased<br>
flowering performance, facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields,<br>
5	higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better<br>
storability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the actual effects to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant varieties (obtained by recombinant methods)<br>
10	to be treated in accordance with the invention include all plants which, owing to<br>
modification by recombinant means, contain genetic material which imparts particular advantageous valuable traits to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salinity, increased flowering performance,<br>
15	facilitated harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, higher quality and/or<br>
higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storability and/or processability of the harvested products. Other especially emphasized examples of such traits are an increased defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and an<br>
20	increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds. Examples of<br>
transgenic plants which may be mentioned are important crop plants such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya, potato, cotton, oil seed rape and fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruit and grapes), with particular emphasis being placed on maize, soya, potato, cotton  and oil  seed rape. Traits which  are particularly<br>
25	emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed<br>
in the plants, in particular those which are generated by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example, by the genes CrylA(a), CryLA(b), CryLA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and their combinations) in the plants (hereinbelow  "Bt plants"). Other traits which are<br>
30	particularly emphasized are the increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria<br>
and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br><br>
and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Other traits<br>
which are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the<br>
plants to certain herbicidal active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonyl<br>
ureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example "PAT" gene). The genes which<br>
5	impart each of the desired traits may also occur in combination with each other in the<br>
transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are varieties of maize, cotton, soya and potato which are commercially available under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example, maize, cotton, soya), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn®<br>
10	(cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may<br>
be mentioned are varieties of maize, cotton and soya which are commercially available under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinothricin, for example oil seed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to<br>
15	sulphonyl ureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (bred conventionally<br>
for herbicide tolerance) which may also be mentioned are the varieties which are commercially available under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Naturally, these statements also apply to plant varieties which will be developed in the future or which will be marketed in the future and which have these genetic traits, or genetic<br>
20	traits to be developed in the future.<br>
The plants stated can be treated particularly advantageously in accordance with the<br>
invention with the compounds of the general formula I or the active compound<br>
mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active<br>
25	compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. The treatment of<br>
plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically stated in the present text may be particularly emphasized.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention not only act against plant, hygiene<br>
30	and stored-product pests, but also, in the veterinary medicine sector, against animal<br>

The material to be protected from insect attack is very especially preferably wood and timber products.<br>
Wood and timber products which can be protected by the agent according to the<br>
5	invention or mixtures comprising it are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
Construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties,<br>
vehicles made of wood, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging,<br>
windows and doors made of wood, plywood, chipboard, joinery, or timber products<br>
10	which quite generally are used in house construction or building joinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
15<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if desired desiccants and UV stabilizers, and if desired colorants and pigments and other processing aids.<br>

A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture<br>
and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility<br>
and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if<br>
5	appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oil or oil-type solvents<br>
with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30°C, preferably<br>
above 45°C Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low<br>
10	volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or<br>
mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkyl benzene.<br>
Mineral oils which are advantageously used are those with a boiling range of from<br>
15	170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with<br>
a boiling range of from 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics with a boiling range of from 160 to 280°C, oil of turpentine, and the like.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of<br>

The active compounds according to the invention also exhibit a potent strengthening effect in plants. They are therefore suitable for mobilizing the plants' intrinsic defences against attack by undesired microorganisms.<br>
10	Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are to be understood as meaning,<br>
in the present context, those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants in such a way that the treated plants, when subsequently inoculated with undesired microorganisms, develop a high degree of resistance to these microorganisms.<br>
15<br>
Undesired microorganisms are understood as meaning, in the present case, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. The substances according to the invention can thus be employed to protect plants against infection by the abovementioned pathogens within a specific period post-treatment. The period within which protection<br>
20	is brought about generally extends from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the<br>
treatment of the plants with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations<br>
required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of aerial plant parts, of<br>
25	propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield. Moreover, they have a low degree of toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
30	If appropriate, the active compounds according to the invention can also be employed<br>
in specific concentrations and application rates as herbicides, for influencing plant<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br><br>
growth, and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they may also be employed as intermediates and precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
In the protection of materials, the substances according to the invention can be<br>
5	employed for protecting industrial materials against infection with, and destruction by,<br>
undesired microorganisms.<br>
Industrial materials in the present context are understood as meaning non-live materials which have been prepared for use in industry. For example, industrial materials which<br>
10	are intended to be protected by active compounds according to the invention from<br>
microbial change or destruction can be glues, sizers, paper and board, textiles, leather, wood, paints and synthetic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which can be infected with, or destroyed by, microorganisms. Parts of production plants, for example cooling-water   circuits,   which   may   be   impaired   by   the   multiplication   of<br>
15	microorganisms, may also be mentioned within the scope of the materials to be<br>
protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned within the scope of the present invention are preferably glues, sizers, paper and board, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer liquids, especially preferably wood.<br>
20	Microorganisms which may bring about degradation of, or change in, the industrial<br>
materials, and which may be mentioned are, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The active compounds according to the invention preferably act against fungi, in particular moulds, wood-discolouring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes), and against slime organisms and algae.<br>
25<br>
Microorganisms of the following genera may be mentioned by way of example:<br>
Altemaria, such as Altemaria tenuis,<br>
30	Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus niger,<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br>
Chaetomium, such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>
Coniophora, such as Coniophora puetana,<br>
5	Lentinus, such as Lentinus tigrinus,<br>
Penicillium, such as Penicillium glaucum,<br>
Polyporus, such as Polyporus versicolor, 10<br>
Aureobasidium, such as Aureobasidium pullulans,<br>
Sclerophoma, such as Sclerophoma pityophila,<br>
15	Trichoderma, such as Trichoderma viride,<br>
Escherichia, such as Escherichia coli,<br>
Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20<br>
Staphylococcus, such as Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Depending  on  their particular physical   and/or chemical  properties,  the  active<br>
compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions,<br>
25	emulsions,     suspensions,     powders,     foams,     pastes,     granules,     aerosols,<br>
microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seed, and also ULV cold- and warm-fogging products.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
30	active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents, pressurized liquified gases<br>
and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or<br><br><br>
Le A 34 883-Foreign Countries<br>
dispersants and/or foam-formers. If water is used as an extender, organic solvents<br>
can, for example, also be used as cosolvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly<br>
suitable are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated<br>
aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes,<br>
5	chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane<br>
or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water. Liquified<br>
10	gaseous extenders or carriers are those  liquids which  are gaseous at normal<br>
temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellents such as halogenohydrocarbons and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Solid carriers which are suitable are: for example, ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and<br>
15	ground synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates.<br>
Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example, crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam<br>
20	formers are: for example, non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene<br>
fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example, lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
25<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Further additives can be<br>
30	mineral and vegetable oils.<br><br><br>

It is possible to use colourants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc. 5<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention may be present, as such or in their<br>
10	formulations,   in   a   mixture   with   known   fungicides, .bactericides,   acaridices,<br>
nematicides, or insecticides, for example to widen the spectrum of action or to prevent the build-up of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects result, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the activity of the individual components.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds such as herbicides or with fertilizers<br>
15	and growth regulators is also possible.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also exhibit<br>
very good antimycotic actions. They have a very broad antimycotic spectrum of<br>
action, in particular against dermatophytes and yeasts, moulds and diphasic fungi (for<br>
20	example against Candida species such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata) and<br>
also Eprdermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes,<br>
Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The elimination of<br>
25	these fungi constitutes in no way a limitation of the mycotic spectrum which can be<br>
controlled, but has merely illustrative character.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or the use<br>
forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable<br>
30	powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. They are applied in the<br>
customary fashion, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, spreading, dusting,<br><br><br>

foaming, brushing on and the like. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low-volume method or to inject the active compound preparation, or the active compound itself, into the soil. The seed of the plants may also be treated. 5<br>
When employing the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the<br>
application rates can be varied within a substantial range, depending on the type of<br>
application. When treating plant parts, the application rates of active compounds are<br>
generally between 0.1 and l0 000g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. In the<br>
10	treatment of seed, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.001<br>
and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. In the treatment of the soil, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5 000 g/ha.<br>
