This invention relates to a lathe with a polygon machining device to work a workpiece.<br>
This invention further relates to a lathe, more particularly to a lathe, which is provided with a polygon machining device that is used to machine a workpiece, such as a nut or a headed bolt.<br>
The lathe of the subject invention has a polygon machining device that is not disclosed in US 4413539 and US 6173630. Furthermore, the two US patents do not disclose a spindle and a polygon machining cutter unit that are driven by the same driving source and that are interconnected by means of a mechanical transmission.<br>
Referring to Fig.l, a conventional polygon machining device 10 is shown to include a machine body 11, a right gear box 12, a rail member 13, a cutter carrying plate 14, a left gear box 15, three cutters 16 (see Fig.2), and a universal connecting rod 17. A spindle 121 and a driving shaft 122 are jo urn ailed on the machine body 11. A chunk 123 is mounted on an end of the spindle 121 for holding a workpiece 18 (see Fig. 2) to be machined. A cutter shaft 151 is driven by the left gear box 15. A driven shaft 152 is driven by the universal connecting rod 17, and is connected operably to the left gear box 15. The cutters 16 are fixed on a cutter mounting disc 153, which is connected fixedly on the cutter shaft 151. When the spindle 123 rotates, it activates the driving shaft 122 via the right gear box 12, thereby rotating the cutter shaft 151, the cutter mounting disc 153 and the cutters 16 through a transmission line of the universal connecting rod 17, die driven shaft 152 and the left gear box 15, The aforesaid device 10 suffers from the following disadvantages:<br>
(1) When the position of the cutter carrying plate 14 is adjusted in an axial or radial direction of the spindle<br><br>
2<br>
121, the universal connecting rod 17 flexes, thereby resulting in unsmooth rotation of the spindle 121 and the cutter shaft 151. Furthermore, because the length of the universal connecting rod 17 is limited, and because the 5 device 10 can only be used to machine a workpiece, which is shorter than the universal connecting rod 17, the application range of the device 10 is reduced.<br>
(2) To form a nut or a headed bolt, a workpiece has to be machined on the device 10 and a lathe for forming<br>
10 threads, thereby resulting in an increase in the machining costs, the machine-occupied space and the tool-changing time,<br>
Hence, an improved lathe, which is provided with a polygon machining device, has been proposed'heretofore<br>
15 to overcome the above-mentioned problems. In the improved lathe, a spindle and a polygon machining cutter unit are driven respectively by different driving sources at different rotational-speed ratios, and have no mechanical transmission therebetween.  As a result, when<br>
20 the feeding distance of the polygon machining cutter unit is relatively large or when the material of a workpiece to be' machined is relatively hard, the feeding of the cutter unit is delayed, thereby resulting in failure to form an accurate polygon on the workpiece.<br>
25 The object of this invention is to provide a lathe with a polygon machining device, which includes a spindle arid" a polygon machining cutter unit that are driven by the<br><br>
3<br>
same driving source and that have a mechanical transmission therebetween, thereby feeding the cutter uait positively.<br>
According to this invention, a lathe has a machine body including a spindle that is joumailed thereon, and a chuck that is adapted to hold a workpiece to be machined. A transverse rail member is disposed slid ably on the machine body, and extends in a transverse direction relative to the spindle. The rail member is movable on the machine body along a longitudinal direction of die spindle. A cutter carrying plate is disposed si id ably on the rail member, and is movable along a longitudinal direction of the rail member. A turret unit is attached to the carrying plate, and is adapted to work the workpiece. A polygon machining cutter unit is attached to the carrying plate, and is spaced apart from the turret unit in the longitudinal direction of the rail member. The polygon machining cutter unit k adapted to form a plane on the workpiece. A cutter shaft is attached fixedly to die polygon machining cutter unit, and is disposed parallel to the spindle. A rigid driving shaft is joumalied on the machine body, and is disposed parallel to the spindle. A driving source is used for rotating &amp;e spindle A clutch device is movable between a connecting position, where rotation is transferred between the spindle and the driving shaft so as to rotate the driving shaft, and a isition, where ...<br><br>
4<br>
rotation of the driving shaft is stopped. A rigid driven shaft is journalled on the machine body, and extends in the transverse direction relative to the spindle . A first gearing interconnects the driving shaft and the driven 5 shaft, and is movable on the driving shaft for transferring rotation from the driving shaft to the driven shaft. A second gearing interconnects the driven shaft and the cutter shaft, and is movable on the driven shaft for transferring rotation from the driven shaft to the 10     cutter shaft.<br>
Because the driving shaft, the first gearing, the driven shaft and the second gearing constitute cooperatively a mechanical transmission between the cutter shaft and the spindle, the cutter unit can be fed 15 at appropriate times, thereby forming an accurate polygon on the workpiece.<br>
These and other features and advantages of this<br>
invention will become apparent in the following detailed<br>
description of the preferred embodiment of this invention,<br>
20     with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

The turret unit 80 is driven by a motor unit SI to form for example threads os the workpiece (A), e.g. form threads on the latter.<br>
The driving motor unit 30 is provided with a motor shaft 31, and a belt pulley 32 that is mounted fixedly on the motor shaft 31.<br>
A clutch device interconnects the spindle 41 and the driving shaft 70, and can be moved between a connecting position, where rotation is transferred between the spindle 41 and the driving shaft 70 so as to rotate the driving shaft 70, and a disconnecting position, where rotation of the driving shaft 70 is stopped.<br>

The third belt 73 is trained on the driving pulley 46 and a driven pulley 72 that is sleeved fixedly on an end of the driving shaft 70. The driving pulley 46 is sleeved rotatably on the<br>
10 rotating shaft 431, and can be moved between a driving position, where the driving pulley 46 is locked on the rotating shaft 431 for transferring rotation of the rotating shaft 431 to the driving shaft 70, and an idle position, where the driving pulley 46 is unlocked from<br>
15 the rotating shaft 431 for stopping rotation of the driving shaft 70.<br>
A cutter shaft 51 is journalled on the cutter seat 50, and is connected fixedly to a polygon machining cutter unit 53. A tailstock 56 is disposed on the machine body<br>
20     20 for extension of a push needle 561 therein.<br>
¦ A first gearing interconnects the driving shaft 70 and the driven shaft 60 for transferring rotation from the driving shaft 70 to the driven shaft 60. In this embodiment, the first gearing includes a first sleeve 71,<br>
25 a first driving gear 74 , a first driven gear 62 and a first casing (CD {see Fig, 3) . The first casing (Cl) is removed from Fig. 5 for the sake of illustrating connection<br><br>
8<br>
between the first driving gear 74 and the first driven gear 62, which is best shown in Fig. 6. The driving shaft 70 is externally splined. The first sleeve 71 is internally splined, and is sleeved axially and movably 5 on the driving shaft 70 for rotating synchronously with the driving shaft 70 . The first driving gear 74 is sleeved fixedly on the first sleeve 71. The first driven gear 62 is sleeved fixedly on the driven shaft 60, and meshes with the first driving gear 74 for transferring rotation<br>
10 between the driving shaft 70 and the driven shaft 60. The first casing (Cl) is disposed axially and movably around the driving shaft 70 for confining the first driving gear 74 and the first driven gear 62 therein while preventing relative movement between the first driving gear 74 and<br>
15     the first driven gear 62.<br>
A second gearing interconnects the driven shaft 60 and the cutter shaft 51, and is movable on the driven shaft 60 for transferring rotation from the driven shaft 60 to the cutter shaft 51.  In this embodiment, the second<br>
20 gearing includes a second sleeve 61, a second driving gear 63, an intermediate shaft 52, an intermediate gear 55, a second driven gear 54, and a second casing (C2) (see Fig. 3) . The second casing (C2) is removed from Fig. 5 for the sake of illustrating the remaining parts of the<br>
25 second gearing, which are best shown in Fig . 6 . The driven shaft 60 is externally splined. The second sleeve 61 is sleeved axially and movably on the driven shaft 60.  The<br><br>
9<br>
intermediate shaft 52 is journalled on the machine body 20, and is disposed over and parallel to the driven shaft 60. The intermediate gear 55 is sleeved fixedly on the intermediate shaft 52, and meshes with the second driving gear 63. The second casing (C2) is disposed axially and movably around the driven shaft 60 for confining the second driving gear 63, the intermediate gear 55 and the second gear 54 therein while preventing movement of the intermediate gear 55 and the driven gear 54 relative to the second driving gear 63.<br>
When it is desired to adjust the position of the cutter seat 50 and the turret unit 80 relative to the chuck 42 and the workpiece (A), the motor units 221, 231 are actuated to move the rail member 22 along the slide slot 21 and the cutter carrying plate 23 on the rail member 22. Because the driving shaft 70 is relatively long, the permissible greatest length of the workpiece (A) is increased.<br>
The driving shaft 70, the first driving gear 74, the first driven gear 62, the driven shaft 60, the second driving gear 63, the intermediate gear 55 and the second driven gear 55 constitute cooperatively a mechanical transmission between the cutter shaft 51 and the spindle 41. Because the cutter unit is driven indirectly by the spindle, the polygon machining cutter unit 53 can be fed at appropriate times even when it is used to machine a workpiece that is made of a relatively hard material and even when the feeding distance is relatively large,<br><br>
10<br>
thereby increasing the machining precision<br><br>
