This application is divided out of the Indian Patent Application no.: 994/KOLNP/2003<br>
This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional<br>
Application 60/259,927, filed January 5,2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) is a 7.5-kD polypeptide that<br>
circulates in plasma in high concentrations and is detectable in most tissues. IGF-I<br>
stimulates cell differentiation and cell proliferation, and is required by most<br>
mammalian cell types for sustained proliferation. These cell types include, among<br>
others, human diploid fibroblasts, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, T<br>
lymphocytes, neural cells, myeloid cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts and bone marrow<br>
stem cells. For a review of the wide variety of cell types for which IGF-I/IGF-I<br>
receptor interaction mediates cell proliferation, see Goldring et al., Eukar. Gene<br>
Express., 1:31-326(1991).<br>
The first step in the transduction pathway leading to IGF-I-stimulated<br>
cellular proliferation or differentiation is binding of IGF-I or IGF-II (or insulin at<br>
supraphysiological concentrations) to the IGF-I receptor. The IGF-I receptor is<br>
composed of two types of subunits: an alpha subunit (a 130-135 kD protein that is<br>
entirely extracellular and functions in ligand binding) and a beta subunit (a 95-kD<br>
transmembrane protein, with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains). The IGF-IR<br>
belongs to the family of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (Ullrich et al., Cell<br>
61: 203-212, 1990), and is structurally similar to the insulin receptor (Ullrich et al.,<br>
EMBO J. 5: 2503-2512,1986). The IGF-IR is initially synthesized as a single chain<br><br>
2<br>
proreceptor polypeptide which is processed by glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage,<br>
and covalent bonding to assemble into a mature 460-kD heterotetramer comprising<br>
two alpha-subunits and two beta-subunits. The beta subunit(s) possesses ligand-<br>
activated tyrosine kinase activity. This activity is implicated in the signaling pathways<br>
mediating ligand action which involve autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit and<br>
phosphorylation of IGF-IR substrates.<br>
In vivo, serum levels of IGF-I are dependent upon the presence of<br>
pituitary growth hormone (GH). Although the liver is a major site of GH-dependent<br>
IGF-I synthesis, recent work indicates that the majority of normal tissues also produce<br>
IGF-I. A variety of neoplastic tissues may also produce IGF-I. Thus IGF-I may act<br>
as a regulator of normal and abnormal cellular proliferation via autocrine or paracrine,<br>
as well as endocrine mechanisms. IGF-I and IGF-II bind to IGF binding proteins<br>
(IGFBPs) in vivo. The availability of free IGF for interaction with the IGF-IR is<br>
modulated by the IGFBPs. For a review of IGFBPs and IGF-I, see Grimberg et al., J.<br>
Cell. Physiol. 183: 1-9,2000.<br>
There is considerable evidence for a role for IGF-I and/or IGF-IR in<br>
the maintenance of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. IGF-IR levels are elevated in<br>
tumors of lung (Kaiser et al., J. Cancer Res. Clin Oncol. 119: 665-668, 1993; Moody<br>
et al., Life Sciences 52: 1161-1173, 1993; Macauley et al., Cancer Res., 50: 2511-<br>
2517, 1990), breast (Pollak et al., Cancer Lett. 38: 223-230, 1987; Foekens et al.,<br>
Cancer Res. 49: 7002-7009, 1989; Cullen et al., Cancer Res. 49: 7002-7009, 1990;<br>
Arteaga et al., J. Clin. Invest. 84: 1418-1423, 1989), prostate and colon (Remaole-<br>
Bennet et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 75: 609-616, 1992; Guo et al.,<br>
Gastroenterol. 102: 1101-1108, 1992). Deregulated expression of IGF-I in prostate<br>
epithelium leads to neoplasia in transgenic mice (DiGiovanni et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 97: 3455-60, 2000). In addition, IGF-I appears to be an autocrine stimulator<br>
of human gliomas (Sandberg-Nordqvist et al., Cancer Res. 53: 2475-2478, 1993),<br>
while IGF-I stimulated the growth of fibrosarcomas that overexpressed IGF-IR<br>
(Butler et al., Cancer Res. 58: 3021-27, 1998). Further, individuals with "high<br>
normal" levels of IGF-I have an increased risk of common cancers compared to<br>
individuals with IGF-I levels in the "low normal" range (Rosen et al., Trends<br>
Endocrinol. Metab. 10: 136-41, 1999). Many of these tumor cell types respond to<br>
IGF-I with a proliferative signal in culture (Nakanishi et al., J. Clin. Invest. 82: 354-<br><br>
3<br>
359,1988; Freed et al., J. Mol. Endocrinol. 3: 509-514,1989), and autocrine or<br>
paracrine loops for proliferation in vivo have been postulated (LeRoith et al.,<br>
Endocrine Revs. 16: 143-163,1995; Yee et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 3: 509-514,1989).<br>
For a review of the role IGF-I/IGF-I receptor interaction plays in the growth of a<br>
variety of human tumors, see Macaulay, Br. J. Cancer, 65: 311-320, 1992.<br>
Increased IGF-I levels are also correlated with several noncancerous<br>
pathological states, including acromegaly and gigantism (Barkan, Cleveland Clin. J.<br>
Med. 65: 343, 347-349, 1998), while abnormal IGF-I/IGF-I receptor function has<br>
been implicated in psoriasis (Wraight et al., Nat. Biotech. 18: 521-526, 2000),<br>
atherosclerosis and smooth muscle restenosis of blood vessels following angioplasty<br>
(Bayes-Genis et al., Circ. Res. 86: 125-130, 2000). Increased IGF-I levels also can be<br>
a problem in diabetes or in complications thereof, such as microvascular proliferation<br>
(Smith et al., Nat. Med. 5: 1390-1395, 1999). Decreased IGF-I levels, which occur,<br>
inter alia, in cases when GH serum levels are decreased or when there is an<br>
insensitivity or resistance to GH, is associated with such disorders as small stature<br>
(Laron, Paediatr. Drugs 1: 155-159,1999), neuropathy, decrease in muscle mass and<br>
osteoporosis (Rosen et al., Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 10: 136-141, 1999).<br>
Using antisense expression vectors or antisense oligonucleotides to the<br>
IGF-IR RNA, it has been shown that interference with IGF-IR leads to inhibition of<br>
IGF-I-mediated or IGF-II-mediated cell growth (see, e.g., Wraight et al., Nat. Biotech.<br>
18: 521-526, 2000). The antisense strategy was successful in inhibiting cellular<br>
proliferation in several normal cell types and in human tumor cell lines. Growth can<br>
also be inhibited using peptide analogues of IGF-I (Pietrzkowski et al., Cell Growth &amp;<br>
Diff. 3: 199-205, 1992; and Pietrzkowski et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 12: 3883-3889,<br>
1992), or a vector expressing an antisense RNA to the IGF-I RNA (Trojan et al.,<br>
Science 259: 94-97, 1992). In addition, antibodies to IGF-IR (Arteaga et al., Breast<br>
Cane. Res. Treatm., 22: 101-106, 1992; and Kalebic et al., Cancer Res. 54: 5531-<br>
5534, 1994), and dominant negative mutants of IGF-IR (Pragcr ct al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91: 2181-2185, 1994; Li et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269: 32558-32564,<br>
1994 and Jiang et al., Oncogene 18: 6071-77, 1999), can reverse the transformed<br>
phenotype, inhibit tumorigenesis, and induce loss of the metastatic phenotype.<br>
IGF-I is also important in the regulation of apoptosis. Apoptosis,<br>
which is programmed eel] death, is involved in a wide variety of developmental<br><br>
4<br>
processes, including immune and nervous system maturation. In addition to its role in<br>
development, apoptosis also has been implicated as an important cellular safeguard<br>
against tumorigenesis (Williams, Cell 65:1097-1098,1991; Lane, Nature 362: 786-<br>
787, 1993). Suppression of the apoptotic program, by a variety of genetic lesions,<br>
may contribute to the development and progression of malignancies.<br>
IGF-I protects from apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal in IL-3-<br>
dependent hemopoietic cells (Rodriguez-Tarduchy, G. et al., J. Immunol. 149: 535-<br>
540, 1992), and from serum withdrawal in Rat-1/mycER cells (Harrington, E., et al.,<br>
EMBO J. 13: 3286-3295, 1994). The anti-apoptotic function of IGF-I is important in<br>
the post-commitment stage of the cell cycle and also in cells blocked in cell cycle<br>
progression by etoposide or thymidine. The demonstration that c-myc driven<br>
fibroblasts are dependent on IGF-I for their survival suggests that there is an<br>
important role for the IGF-IR in the maintenance of tumor cells by specifically<br>
inhibiting apoptosis, a role distinct from the proliferative effects of IGF-I or IGF-IR.<br>
This would be similar to a role thought to be played by other anti-apoptotic genes<br>
such as bcl-2 in promoting tumor survival (McDonnell et al., Cell 57: 79-88, 1989;<br>
Hockenberry et al., Nature 348: 334-336, 1990).<br>
The protective effects of IGF-I on apoptosis are dependent upon<br>
having IGF-IR present on cells to interact with IGF-I (Resnicoff et al., Cancer Res.<br>
55: 3739-3741, 1995). Support for an anti-apoptotic function of IGF-IR in the<br>
maintenance of tumor cells was also provided by a study using antisense<br>
oligonucleotides to the IGF-ER that identified a quantitative relationship between IGF-<br>
IR levels, the extent of apoptosis and the tumorigenie potential of a rat syngeneic<br>
tumor (Rescinoff et al., Cancer Res. 55: 3739-3741, 1995). An overexpressed IGF-<br>
IR has been found to protect tumor cells in vitro from etoposide-induced apoptosis<br>
(Sell et al., Cancer Res. 55: 303-306,1995) and, even more dramatically, that a<br>
decrease in IGF-IR levels below wild type levels caused massive apoptosis of tumor<br>
cells in vivo (Resnicoff et al., Cancer Res. 55: 2463-2469, 1995).<br>
Potential strategies for inducing apoptosis or for inhibiting cell<br>
proliferation associated with increased IGF-I, increased IGF-II and/or increased IGF-<br>
IR receptor levels include suppressing IGF-I levels or IGF-II levels or preventing the<br>
binding of IGF-I to the IGF-IR. For example, the long acting somatostatin analogue<br>
octreotide has been employed to reduce IGF synthesis and/or secretion. Soluble IGF-<br><br>
5<br>
IR has been used to induce apoptosis in tumor cells in vivo and inhibit tumorigenesis<br>
in an experimental animal system (D'Ambrosio et al., Cancer Res. 56: 4013-20,<br>
1996). In addition, IGF-IR antisense oligonucleotides, peptide analogues of IGF-I,<br>
and antibodies to IGF-IR have been used to decrease IGF-I or IGF-IR expression (see<br>
supra). However, none of these compounds has been suitable for long-term<br>
administration to human patients. In addition, although IGF-I has been administered<br>
to patients for treatment of short stature, osteoporosis, decreased muscle mass,<br>
neuropathy or diabetes, the binding of IGF-I to IGFBPs has often made treatment with<br>
IGF-I difficult or ineffective.<br>
Accordingly, in view of the roles that IGF-I and IGF-IR have in such<br>
disorders as cancer and other proliferative disorders when IGF-I and/or IGF-IR are<br>
overexpressed, and the roles that too little IGF-I and IGF-IR have in disorders such as<br>
short stature and frailty when either IGF-I and/or IGF-IR are underexpressed, it would<br>
be desirable to generate antibodies to IGF-IR that could be used to either inhibit or<br>
stimulate IGF-IR. Although anti-IGF-IR antibodies have been reported to have been<br>
found in certain patients with autoimmune diseases, none of these antibodies has been<br>
purified and none has been shown to be suitable for inhibiting IGF-I activity for<br>
diagnostic or clinical procedures. See, e.g., Thompson et al., Pediat. Res. 32: 455-<br>
459,1988; Tappy et al., Diabetes 37: 1708-1714, 1988; Weightman et al.,<br>
Autoimmunity 16:251-257, 1993; Drexhage et al., Nether. J. of Med. 45:285-293,<br>
1994. Thus, it would be desirable to obtain high-affinity human anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies that could be used to treat diseases in humans.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions and General Techniques<br>
Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in<br>
connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly<br>
understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by<br>
context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the<br>
singular. Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell<br>
and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and<br>
protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well<br>
known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present<br>
invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in<br>
the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited<br>
and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. See,<br>
e.g., Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al.,<br>
Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates (1992), and<br>
Harlow and Lane Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1990), which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to<br>
manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described<br>
herein. The nomenclatures used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures<br>
and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal<br>
and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly<br>
used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical<br>
analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of<br>
patients.<br>
The following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to<br>
have the following meanings:<br>
The term "polypeptide" encompasses native or artificial proteins,<br>
protein fragments and polypeptide analogs of a protein sequence. A polypeptide may<br>
be monomeric or polymeric.<br><br>
10<br>
The term "isolated protein" or "isolated polypeptide" is a protein or<br>
polypeptide that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation (1) is not associated<br>
with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state, (2) is free<br>
of other proteins from the same species (3) is expressed by a cell from a different<br>
species, or (4) does not occur in nature. Thus, a polypeptide that is chemically<br>
synthesized or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it<br>
naturally originates will be "isolated" from its naturally associated components. A<br>
protein may also be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by<br>
isolation, using protein purification techniques well known in the art.<br>
A protein or polypeptide is "substantially pure," "substantially<br>
homogeneous" or "substantially purified" when at least about 60 to 75% of a sample<br>
exhibits a single species of polypeptide. The polypeptide or protein may be<br>
monomeric or multimeric. A substantially pure polypeptide or protein will typically<br>
comprise about 50%, 60, 70%, 80% or 90% WAV of a protein sample, more usually<br>
about 95%, and preferably will be over 99% pure. Protein purity or homogeneity may<br>
be indicated by a number of means well known in the art, such as polyacrylamide gel<br>
electrophoresis of a protein sample, followed by visualizing a single polypeptide band<br>
upon staining the gel with a stain well known in the art. For certain purposes, higher<br>
resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art for<br>
purification.<br>
The term "polypeptide fragment" as used herein refers to a polypeptide<br>
that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining<br>
amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-<br>
occurring sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long,<br>
preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long,<br>
usually at least 50 amino acids long, even more preferably at least 70, 80, 90, 100,<br>
150 or 200 amino acids long.<br>
The term "polypeptide analog" as used herein refers to a polypeptide<br>
that is comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity<br>
to a portion of an amino acid sequence and that has at least one of the following<br>
properties: (1) specific binding to IGF-IR under suitable binding conditions, (2)<br>
ability to block IGF-I or IGF-II binding to IGF-IR, or (3) ability to reduce IGF-IR cell<br>
surface expression or tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo. Typically,<br><br>
11<br>
polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or insertion or<br>
deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at<br>
least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150 or 200<br>
amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-<br>
occurring polypeptide.<br>
Preferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce<br>
susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding<br>
affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or<br>
modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can<br>
include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide<br>
sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring<br>
sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming<br>
intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not<br>
substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a<br>
replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent<br>
sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent<br>
sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures<br>
are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H.<br>
Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C.<br>
Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and<br>
Thornton et at. Nature 354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Non-peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical<br>
industry as drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These<br>
types of non-peptide compound are termed "peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics".<br>
Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p.392 (1985);<br>
and Evans et al. J. Med. Chem. 30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized<br>
molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically<br>
useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide<br>
(i.e., a polypeptide that has a desired biochemical property or pharmacological<br><br>
12<br>
activity), such as a human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally<br>
replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: --CH2NH--, -CHiS--, -<br>
CH2-CH2--, ~CH=CH«(cis and trans), -COCH2--, --CH(OH)CH2--, and-CH2SO--,<br>
by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino<br>
acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in<br>
place of L-lysine) may also be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition,<br>
constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical<br>
consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo<br>
and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference);<br>
for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular<br>
disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.<br>
An "immunoglobulin" is a tetrameric molecule. In a naturally-<br>
occurring immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of<br>
polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy"<br>
chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a<br>
variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for<br>
antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a constant<br>
region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified<br>
as K and X light chains. Heavy chains are classified as n, A, y, a, or e, and define the<br>
antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Within light and<br>
heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a "J" region of about 12<br>
or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a "D" region of about 10<br>
more amino acids. See generally. Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul, W., ed., 2nd<br>
ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)) (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all<br>
purposes). The variable regions of each light/eavy chain pair form the antibody<br>
binding site such that an intact immunoglobulin has two binding sites.<br>
Immunoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structure of<br>
relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable regions,<br>
also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the two<br>
chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a<br>
specific epitope. From N-terminus to C-terminus, both light and heavy chains<br>
comprise the domains FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The<br>
assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of<br><br>
13<br>
Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health,<br>
Bethesda, Md. {1987 and 1991)), or Chothia &amp; LeskJ. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917<br>
(1987); Chothia et al. Nature 342:878-883 (1989).<br>
An "antibody" refers to an intact immunoglobulin or to an antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding.<br>
Antigen-binding portions may be produced by recombinant DNA techniques or by<br>
enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Antigen-binding portions<br>
include, inter alia, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, dAb, and complementarity determining<br>
region (CDR) fragments, single-chain antibodies (scFv), chimeric antibodies,<br>
diabodies and polypeptides that contain at least a portion of an immunoglobulin that is<br>
sufficient to confer specific antigen binding to the polypeptide.<br>
As used herein, an antibody that is referred to as, e.g., 2.12.1, 2.13.2,<br>
2.14.3, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 and 6.1.1, is an antibody that is derived from the hybridoma of<br>
the same name. For example, antibody 2.12.1 is derived from hybridoma 2.12.1.<br>
An Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH,<br>
CL and CH I domains; a F(ab')2 fragment is a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab<br>
fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment consists of<br>
the VH and CHI domains; an Fv fragment consists of the VL and VH domains of a<br>
single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546,<br>
1989) consists of a VH domain.<br>
A single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a VL and VH<br>
regions are paired to form a monovalent molecules via a synthetic linker that enables<br>
them to be made as a single protein chain (Bird et al., Science 242:423-426, 1988 and<br>
Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883,1988). Diabodies are<br>
bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single<br>
polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the<br>
two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with<br>
complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see<br>
e.g., Holliger, P., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448, 1993, andPoIjak,<br>
R. J., et al., Structure 2:1121-1123, 1994). One or more CDRs may be incorporated<br>
into a molecule either covalently or noncovalently to make it an immunoadhesin. An<br>
immunoadhesin may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger polypeptide chain,<br>
may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the<br><br>
14<br>
CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the immunoadhesin to specifically bind to<br>
a particular antigen of interest.<br>
An antibody may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than<br>
one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different.<br>
For instance, a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin has two identical binding sites, a<br>
single-chain antibody or Fab fragment has one binding site, while a "bispecific" or<br>
"bifunctional" antibody has two different binding sites.<br>
An "isolated antibody" is an antibody that (1) is not associated with<br>
naturally-associated components, including other naturally-associated antibodies, that<br>
accompany it in its native state, (2) is free of other proteins from the same species, (3)<br>
is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.<br>
Examples of isolated antibodies include an anti-IGF-IR antibody that has been affinity<br>
purified using IGF-IR is an isolated antibody, an anti-IGF-IR antibody that has been<br>
synthesized by a hybridoma or other cell line in vitro, and a human anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody derived from a transgenic mouse.<br>
The term "human antibody" includes all antibodies that have one or<br>
more variable and constant regions derived from human immunoglobulin sequences.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, all of the variable and constant domains are derived from<br>
human immunoglobulin sequences (a fully human antibody). These antibodies may<br>
be prepared in a variety of ways, as described below.<br>
A humanized antibody is an antibody that is derived from a non-human<br>
species, in which certain amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the<br>
heavy and light chains have been mutated so as to avoid or abrogate an immune<br>
response in humans. Alternatively, a humanized antibody may be produced by fusing<br>
the constant domains from a human antibody to the variable domains of a non-human<br>
species. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in United<br>
States Patent Nos. 6,054,297, 5,886,152 and 5,877,293.<br>
The term "chimeric antibody" refers to an antibody that contains one or<br>
more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other<br>
antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a<br>
human anti-IGF-IR antibody. In a more preferred embodiment, all of the CDRs are<br>
derived from a human anti-IGF-IR antibody. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
CDRs from more than one human anti-IGF-IR antibodies are mixed and matched in a<br><br>
15<br>
chimeric antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the<br>
light chain of a first human anti-IGF-IR antibody may be combined with CDR2 and<br>
CDR3 from the light chain of a second human anti-IGF-IR antibody, and the CDRs<br>
from the heavy chain may be derived from a third anti-IGF-IR antibody. Further, the<br>
framework regions may be derived from one of the same anti-IGF-IR antibodies, from<br>
one or more different antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized<br>
antibody.<br>
A "neutralizing antibody" or "an inhibitory antibody" is an antibody<br>
that inhibits the binding of IGF-IR to IGF-I when an excess of the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I bound to IGF-IR by at least about 20%. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibody reduces the amount of IGF-I bound to IGF-IR by<br>
at least 40%, more preferably 60%, even more preferably 80%, or even more<br>
preferably 85%. The binding reduction may be measured by any means known to one<br>
of ordinary skill in the art, for example, as measured in an in vitro competitive<br>
binding assay. An example of measuring the reduction in binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR<br>
is presented below in Example IV.<br>
An "activating antibody" is an antibody that activates IGF-IR by at<br>
least about 20% when added to a cell, tissue or organism expressing IGF-IR. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibody activates IGF-IR activity by at least 40%, more<br>
preferably 60%, even more preferably 80%, or even more preferably 85%. In a more<br>
preferred embodiment, the activating antibody is added in the presence of IGF-I or<br>
IGF-II. In another preferred embodiment, the activity of the activating antibody is<br>
measured by determining the amount of tyrosine autophosphorylation of IGF-IR.<br>
Fragments or analogs of antibodies can be readily prepared by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of this specification. Preferred amino-<br>
and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional<br>
domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the<br>
nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence<br>
databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify<br>
sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other<br>
proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences<br>
that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. Science<br>
253:164(1991).<br><br>

The term "surface plasmon resonance", as used herein, refers to an<br>
optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions<br>
by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for<br>
example using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and<br>
Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see Jonsson, U., et al. (1993) Ann. Biol.<br>
Clin. 51:19-26; Jonsson, U., et al. (1991) Biotechniques 11:620-627; Johnsson, B., et<br>
al. (1995) J. Mol. Recognit. 8:125-131; and Johnnson, B., et al. (1991) Anal.<br>
Biochem. 198:268-277.<br>
The term "Koff" refers to the off rate constant for dissociation of an<br>
antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.<br>
The term "Koff" refers to the dissociation constant of a particular<br>
antibody-antigen interaction.<br>
The term "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable of<br>
specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants<br>
usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino<br>
acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural<br>
characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody is said to<br>
specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is 
nM and most preferably 
As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their<br>
abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology - A Synthesis (2nd<br>
Edition, E.S. Golub and D.R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass.<br>
(1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino<br>
acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as a-, a-<br>
disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional<br>
amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present<br>
invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, y-<br>
carboxyglutamate, e-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, e-N-acetyllysine, Oi-phosphoserine, N-<br>
acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, s-N- .<br>
methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-<br>
hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the<br>
amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction,<br>
in accordance with standard usage and convention.<br><br>
17<br>
The term "polynucleotide" as referred to herein means a polymeric<br>
form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or<br>
deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. The term includes<br>
single and double stranded forms of DNA.<br>
The term "isolated polynucleotide" as used herein shall mean a<br>
polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof,<br>
which by virtue of its origin the "isolated polynucleotide" (1) is not associated with all<br>
or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the "isolated polynucleotide" is found in<br>
nature, (2) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or<br>
(3) does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.<br>
The term "oligonucleotide" referred to herein includes naturally<br>
occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-<br>
naturally occurring oiigonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide<br>
subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably<br>
oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,<br>
17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded,<br>
e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the<br>
construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides of the invention can be either sense<br>
or antisense oligonucleotides.<br>
The term "naturally occurring nucleotides" referred to herein includes<br>
deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term "modified nucleotides" referred<br>
to herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like.<br>
The term "oligonucleotide linkages" referred to herein includes oligonucleotides<br>
linkages such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate,<br>
phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate, phosphoroamidate,<br>
and the like. See e.g., LaPlanche et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 14:9081 (1986); Stec et al. J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 106:6077 (1984); Stein et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 16:3209 (1988); Zon et<br>
al. Anti-Cancer Drug Design 6:539 (1991); Zon et al. Oligonucleotides and<br>
Analogues: A Practical Approach, pp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University<br>
Press, Oxford England (1991)); Stec et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and<br>
Peyman Chemical Reviews 90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if<br>
desired.<br><br>
18<br>
"Operably linked" sequences include both expression control<br>
sequences that are contiguous with the gene of interest and expression control<br>
sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene of interest.  The term<br>
"expression control sequence" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences<br>
which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to<br>
which they are ligated. Expression control sequences include appropriate<br>
transcription initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer sequences; efficient RNA<br>
processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation signals; sequences that<br>
stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (i.e.,<br>
Kozak consensus sequence); sequences that enhance protein stability; and when<br>
desired, sequences that enhance protein secretion. The nature of such control<br>
sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control<br>
sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription<br>
termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include<br>
promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term "control sequences" is<br>
intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is essential for<br>
expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose<br>
presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner<br>
sequences.<br>
The term "vector", as used herein, is intended to refer to a nucleic acid<br>
molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One<br>
type of vector is a "plasmid", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop<br>
into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral<br>
vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome.<br>
Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they<br>
are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and<br>
episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors)<br>
can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell,<br>
and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are<br>
capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked.<br>
Such vectors are referred to herein as "recombinant expression vectors" (or simply,<br>
"expression vectors"). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA<br>
techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, "plasmid"<br><br>
19<br>
and "vector" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used<br>
form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of<br>
expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses,<br>
adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.<br>
The term "recombinant host cell" (or simply "host cell"), as used<br>
herein, is intended to refer to a cell into which a recombinant expression vector has<br>
been introduced. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only<br>
to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain<br>
modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or<br>
environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent<br>
cell, but are still included within the scope of the term "host cell" as used herein.<br>
The term "selectively hybridize" referred to herein means to detectably<br>
and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof in<br>
accordance with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under<br>
hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable<br>
binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. "High stringency" or "highly stringent"<br>
conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the<br>
art and discussed herein. An example of "high stringency" or "highly stringent"<br>
conditions is a method of incubating a polynucleotide with another polynucleotide,<br>
wherein one polynucleotide may be affixed to a solid surface such as a membrane, in<br>
a hybridization buffer of 6X SSPE or SSC, 50% formamide, 5X Denhardt's reagent,<br>
0.5% SDS, 100 ug/ml denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA at a hybridization<br>
temperature of 42°C for 12-16 hours, followed by twice washing at 55°C using a<br>
wash buffer of IX SSC, 0.5% SDS. See also Sambrook et al., supra, pp. 9.50-9.55.<br>
The term "percent sequence identity" in the context of nucleic acid<br>
sequences refers to the residues in two sequences which are the same when aligned<br>
for maximum correspondence. The length of sequence identity comparison may be<br>
over a stretch of at least about nine nucleotides, usually at least about 18 nucleotides,<br>
more usually at least about 24 nucleotides, typically at least about 28 nucleotides,<br>
more typically at least about 32 nucleotides, and preferably at least about 36,48 or<br>
more nucleotides. There are a number of different algorithms known in the art which<br>
can be used to measure nucleotide sequence identity. For instance, polynucleotide<br>
sequences can be compared using FASTA, Gap or Bestfit, which are programs in<br><br>
20<br>
Wisconsin Package Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison,<br>
Wisconsin. FAST A, which includes, e.g., the programs FASTA2 and FASTA3,<br>
provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap<br>
between the query and search sequences (Pearson, Methods Enzymol. 183: 63-98<br>
(1990); Pearson, Methods Mol. Biol. 132: 185-219 (2000); Pearson, Metholds<br>
Enzymol 266: 227-258 (1996); Pearson,/. Mol. Biol. 276: 71-84 (1998); herein<br>
incorporated by reference). Unless otherwise specified, default parameters for a<br>
particular program or algorithm are used. For instance, percent sequence identity<br>
between nucleic acid sequences can be determined using FASTA with its default<br>
parameters (a word size of 6 and the NOPAM factor for the scoring matrix) or using<br>
Gap with its default parameters as provided in GCG Version 6.1, herein incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
A reference to a nucleic acid sequence encompasses its complement<br>
unless otherwise specified. Thus, a reference to a nucleic acid molecule having a<br>
particular sequence should be understood to encompass its complementary strand,<br>
with its complementary sequence.<br>
In the molecular biology art, researchers use the terms "percent<br>
sequence identity", "percent sequence similarity" and "percent sequence homology"<br>
interchangeably. In this application, these terms shall have the same meaning with<br>
respect to nucleic acid sequences only.<br>
The term "substantial similarity" or "substantial sequence similarity,"<br>
when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally<br>
aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid<br>
(or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about<br>
85%, preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95%, 96%,<br>
97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm<br>
of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or Gap, as discussed above.<br>
As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that<br>
two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or<br>
BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 75% or 80% sequence identity,<br>
preferably at least 90% or 95% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 98%<br>
or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ<br>
by conservative amino acid substitutions. A "conservative amino acid substitution" is<br><br>
21<br>
one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue<br>
having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or<br>
hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not<br>
substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or<br>
more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the<br>
percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct<br>
for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are<br>
well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson, Methods Mol. Biol. 24:<br>
307-31 (1994), herein incorporated by reference. Examples of groups of amino acids<br>
that have side chains with similar chemical properties include 1) aliphatic side chains:<br>
glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; 2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains:<br>
serine and threonine; 3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; 4)<br>
aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; 5) basic side chains:<br>
lysine, arginine, and histidine; and 6) sulfur-containing side chains are cysteine and<br>
methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-<br>
leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-<br>
aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine.<br>
Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a<br>
positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al.,<br>
Science 256: 1443-45 (1992), herein incorporated by reference. A "moderately<br>
conservative" replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250<br>
log-likelihood matrix.<br>
Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as<br>
sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein<br>
analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to<br>
various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino<br>
acid substitutions. For instance, GCG contains programs such as "Gap" and "Bestfit"<br>
which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or<br>
sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous .<br>
polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a<br>
mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be<br>
compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in<br>
GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and<br><br>
22<br>
percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and<br>
search sequences (Pearson (1990); Pearson (2000). Another preferred algorithm<br>
when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number<br>
of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially<br>
blastp or tblastn, using default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et ah, J. Mol. Biol. 215:<br>
403-410 (1990); Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-402 (1997); herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
The length of polypeptide sequences compared for homology will<br>
generally be at least about 16 amino acid residues, usually at least about 20 residues,<br>
more usually at least about 24 residues, typically at least about 28 residues, and<br>
preferably more than about 35 residues. When searching a database containing<br>
sequences from a large number of different organisms, it is preferable to compare<br>
amino acid sequences.<br>
As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to incorporation of<br>
another molecule in the antibody. In one embodiment, the label is a detectable<br>
marker, e.g., incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a<br>
polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g.,<br>
streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected<br>
by optical or colorimetric methods). In another embodiment, the label or marker can<br>
be therapeutic, e.g., a drug conjugate or toxin. Various methods of labeling<br>
polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may be used. Examples of<br>
labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or<br>
radionuclides (e.g., 3H, 14C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, wTc, '"in, I25I, mI), fluorescent labels<br>
(e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish<br>
peroxidase, P-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent<br>
markers, biotinyl groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a<br>
secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary<br>
antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags), magnetic agents, such as gadolinium<br>
chelates, toxins such as pertussis toxin, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium<br>
bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine,<br>
colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone,<br>
mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1 -dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine,<br>
tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof.<br><br>
23<br>
In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to reduce<br>
potential steric hindrance.<br>
The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a<br>
mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made<br>
from biological materials. The term "pharmaceutical agent or drug" as used herein<br>
refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired<br>
therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient. Other chemistry terms<br>
herein are used according to conventional usage in the art, as exemplified by The<br>
McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (Parker, S.', Ed., McGraw-Hill, San<br>
Francisco (1985)), incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The term "antineoplastic agent" is used herein to refer to agents that<br>
have the functional property of inhibiting a development or progression of a neoplasm<br>
in a human, particularly a malignant (cancerous) lesion, such as a carcinoma,<br>
sarcoma, lymphoma, or leukemia. Inhibition of metastasis is frequently a property of<br>
antineoplastic agents.<br>
The term patient includes human and veterinary subjects.<br>
Human Anti-IGF-IR Antibodies<br>
and Characterization Thereof<br>
Human antibodies avoid certain of the problems associated with<br>
antibodies that possess mouse or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of<br>
such mouse or rat derived sequences can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies<br>
or can lead to the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient.<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment, the invention provides humanized anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides fully human anti-IGF-<br>
IR antibodies by introducing human immunoglobulin genes into a rodent so that the<br>
rodent produces fully human antibodies. More preferred are fully human anti-human<br>
IGF-IR antibodies. Fully human anti-IGF-IR antibodies are expected to minimize the<br>
immunogenic and allergic responses :ntrinsic to mouse or mouse-derivatized<br>
monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) and thus to increase the efficacy and safety of "the<br>
administered antibodies. The use of fully human antibodies can be expected to<br>
provide a substantial advantage in the treatment of chronic and recurring human<br>
diseases, such as inflammation and cancer, which may require repeated antibody<br><br>
24<br>
administrations. In another embodiment, the invention provides an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody that does not bind complement.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is 2.12.1, 2.13.2,<br>
2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2,4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody comprises a light chain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 or 22, or one or more CDRs from these amino acid<br>
sequences. In another preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody comprises a<br>
heavy chain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NO: 4, 8, 12,<br>
16, 20 or 24 or one or more CDRs from these amino acid sequences.<br>
Class and Subclass of Anti-IGF-IR Antibodies<br>
The antibody may be an IgG, an IgM, an IgE, an IgA or an IgD<br>
molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG and is an IgGl, IgG2,<br>
IgG3 or IgG4 subtype. In a more preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is<br>
subclass IgG2. In another preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is the<br>
same class and subclass as antibody 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2,4.17.3 or<br>
6.1.1, which is IgG2.<br>
The class and subclass of anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be determined<br>
by any method known in the art. In general, the class and subclass of an antibody<br>
may be determined using antibodies that are specific for a particular class and<br>
subclass of antibody. Such antibodies are available commercially. The class and<br>
subclass can be determined by ELISA, Western Blot as well as other techniques.<br>
Alternatively, the class and subclass may be determined by sequencing all or a portion<br>
of the constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the antibodies, comparing<br>
their amino acid sequences to the known amino acid sequences of various class and<br>
subclasses of immunoglobulins, and determining the class and subclass of the<br>
antibodies.<br>
Species and Molecule Selectivity<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the anti-IGF-IR antibody   •<br>
demonstrates both species and molecule selectivity. In one embodiment, the anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibody binds to human, cynomologous or rhesus IGF-JR. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody does not bind to mouse, rat, guinea pig, dog or<br>
rabbit IGF-IR. In another preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody does not<br><br>
25<br>
bind to a New World monkey species such as a marmoset. Following the teachings of<br>
the specification, one may determine the species selectivity for the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody using methods well known in the art. For instance, one may determine<br>
species selectivity using Western blot, FACS, ELISA or RIA. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, one may determine the species selectivity using Western blot.<br>
In another embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody has a selectivity for<br>
IGF-IR that is at least 50 times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the selectivity of the anti-IGF-IR antibody is more than 100<br>
times greater than its selectivity for insulin receptor. In an even more preferred<br>
embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody does not exhibit any appreciable specific<br>
binding to any other protein other than IGF-IR. One may determine the selectivity of<br>
the anti-IGF-IR antibody for IGR-IR using methods well known in the art following<br>
the teachings of the specification. For instance, one may determine the selectivity<br>
using Western blot, FACS, ELISA or RIA. In a preferred embodiment, one may<br>
determine the molecular selectivity using Western blot.<br>
Binding Affinity of Anti-IGF-IR to IGF-IR<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the anti-IGF-IR antibodies bind to<br>
IGF-IR with high affinity. In one embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody binds to<br>
IGF-IR with a Kd of 1 x 10"8 M or less. In a more preferred embodiment, the antibody<br>
binds to IGF-IR with a Kd or 1 x 10"9 M or less. In an even more preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-IR with a Kd or 5 x 10"10 M or less. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-IR with a Kd or 1 x 10'10 M<br>
or less. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-IR with<br>
substantially the same Kd as an antibody selected from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,<br>
4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-IR<br>
with substantially the same Kd as an antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from<br>
an antibody selected from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1.   In still<br>
another preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-ER with substantially the<br>
same Kd as an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences selected from<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 or 24. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-IR with substantially the same Kd as an<br>
antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody that comprises one of<br><br>
26<br>
the amino acid sequences selected from SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18,<br>
20, 22 or 24.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the anti-IGF-IR antibody has a low<br>
dissociation rate. In one embodiment, the anti-IGF-ER antibody has an Korrof 1 x<br>
10"1 s'1 or lower. In a preferred embodiment, the Koff-is 5 x 10'5 s'1 or lower. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the Koff is substantially the same as an antibody<br>
selected from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody binds to IGF-IR with substantially the same Koff as an<br>
antibody that comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody selected from 2.12.1,<br>
2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In still another preferred embodiment, the<br>
antibody binds to IGF-IR with substantially the same Koff as an antibody that<br>
comprises one of the amino acid sequences selected from SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,<br>
12,14,16, 18,20, 22 or 24. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody binds to<br>
IGF-IR with substantially the same Koff as an antibody that comprises one or more<br>
CDRs from an antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences selected from<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 2,4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,16,18, 20, 22.<br>
The binding affinity and dissociation rate of an anti-IGF-IR antibody to<br>
IGF-IR may be determined by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, the<br>
binding affinity can be measured by competitive ELISAs, RIAs or surface plasmon<br>
resonance, such as BIAcore. The dissociation rate can also be measured by surface<br>
plasmon resonance. In a more preferred embodiment, the binding affinity and<br>
dissociation rate is measured by surface plasmon resonance. In an even more<br>
preferred embodiment, the binding affinity and dissociation rate is measured using a<br>
BIAcore. An example of determining binding affinity and dissociation rate is<br>
described below in Example II.<br>
Half-Life of Anti-IGF-IR Antibodies<br>
According to another object of the invention, the anti-IGF-IR antibody<br>
has a half-life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of at least three days. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of four days or longer. In<br>
another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of eight days or<br>
longer. In another embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof is<br>
derivatized or modified such that it has a longer half-life, as discussed below. In<br><br>
27<br>
another preferred embodiment, the antibody may contain point mutations to increase<br>
serum half life, such as described WO 00/09560, published February 24,2000.<br>
The antibody half-life may be measured by any means known to one<br>
having ordinary skill in the art. For instance, the antibody half life may be measured<br>
by Western blot, ELISA or R1A over an appropriate period of time. The antibody<br>
half-life may be measured in any appropriate animals, e.g., a monkey, such as a<br>
cynomologous monkey, a primate or a human.<br>
Identification oflGF-IR Epitopes<br>
Recognized by Anti-ICF-IR Antibody<br>
The invention also provides an anti-IGF-IR antibody that binds the<br>
same antigen or epitope as a human anti-IGF-IR antibody. Further, the invention<br>
provides an anti-IGF-IR antibody that cross-competes with a human anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the human anti-IGF-IR antibody is 2.12.1,<br>
2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
human anti-IGF-IR comprises one or more CDRs from an antibody selected from<br>
2.12.1,2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2,4.17.3 or 6.1.1.   In still another preferred<br>
embodiment, the human anti-IGF-IR comprises one of the amino acid sequences<br>
selected from SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,12, 14, 16,18, 20, 22 or 24. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the human anti-IGF-IR comprises one or more CDRs from an<br>
antibody that comprises one of the amino acid sequences selected from SEQ ED NOS:<br>
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,16, 18, 20, 22 or 24. In a highly preferred embodiment, the anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibody is another human antibody.<br>
One may determine whether an anti-IGF-IR antibody binds to the same<br>
antigen using a variety of methods known in the art. For instance, one may determine<br>
whether a test anti-IGF-IR antibody binds to the same antigen by using an anti-IGF-<br>
IR antibody to capture an antigen that is known to bind to the anti-IGF-ER antibody,<br>
such as IGF-IR, eluting the antigen from the antibody, and then determining whether<br>
the test antibody will bind to the eluted antigen. One may determine whether an<br>
antibody binds to the same epitope as an anti-IGF-ER antibody by binding the' anti-<br>
IGF-ER antibody to IGF-IR under saturating conditions, and then measuring the<br>
ability of the test antibody to bind to IGF-IR. If the test antibody is able to bind to the<br>
IGF-ER at the same time as the anti-IGF-ER antibody, then the test antibody binds to a<br>
different epitope as the anti-IGF-ER antibody. However, if the test antibody is not<br><br>
28<br>
able to bind to the IGF-IR at the same time, then the test antibody binds to the same<br>
epitope as the human anti-IGF-IR antibody. This experiment may be performed using<br>
ELISA, RIA or surface plasmon resonance. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
experiment is performed using surface plasmon resonance. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, BIAcore is used. One may also determine whether an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody cross-competes with an anti-IGF-IR antibody. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
one may determine whether an anti-IGF-IR antibody cross-competes with another by<br>
using the same method that is used to measure whether the anti-IGF-IR antibody is<br>
able to bind to the same epitope as another anti-IGF-IR antibody.<br>
Light and Heavy Chain Usage<br>
The invention also provides an anti-IGF-IR antibody that comprises<br>
variable sequences encoded by a human K gene. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
variable sequences are encoded by either the VK A27, A3 0 or 012 gene family. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the variable sequences are encoded by a human VK A30 gene<br>
family. In a more preferred embodiment, the light chain comprises no more than ten<br>
amino acid substitutions from the germline VK A27, A30 or 012, preferably no more<br>
than six amino acid substitutions, and more preferably no more than three amino acid<br>
substitutions. In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid substitutions are<br>
conservative substitutions.<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22 provide the amino acid<br>
sequences of the variable regions of six anti-IGF-IR K light chains. SEQ ID NOS: 38,<br>
40 and 42 provide the amino acid sequences of the three germline K light chains from<br>
which the six anti-IGF-IR K light chains are derived. Figs. 1A-1C show the<br>
alignments of the nucleotide sequences of the variable regions of the light chains of<br>
the six anti-IGF-IR antibodies to each other and to the germline sequences from<br>
which they are derived. Following the teachings of this specification, one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art could determine the encoded amino acid sequence of the six anti-IGF-<br>
IR K light chains and the germline K light chains and determine the differences<br>
between the germline sequences and the antibody sequences.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the VL of the anti-IGF-IR antibody<br>
contains the same amino acid substitutions, relative to the germline amino acid<br>
sequence, as any one or more of the VL of antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,<br>
4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. For example, the VL of the anti-IGF-IR antibody may contain<br><br>
29<br>
one or more amino acid substitutions that are the same as those present in antibody<br>
2.13.2,	another amino acid substitution that is the same as that present in antibody<br>
2.14.3,	and another amino acid substitution that is the same as antibody 4.9.2. In this<br>
manner, one can mix and match different features of antibody binding in order to<br>
alter, e.g., the affinity of the antibody for IGF-IR or its dissociation rate from the<br>
antigen. In another embodiment, the amino acid substitutions are made in the same<br>
position as those found in any one or more of the VL of antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2,<br>
2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1, but conservative amino acid substitutions are<br>
made rather than using the same amino acid. For example, if the amino acid<br>
substitution compared to the germline in one of the antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3,<br>
3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1 is glutamate, one may conservatively substitute aspartate.<br>
Similarly, if the amino acid substitution is serine, one may conservatively substitute<br>
threonine.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the light chain comprises an amino<br>
acid sequence that is the same as the amino acid sequence of the VL of 2.12.1,2.13.2,<br>
2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another highly preferred embodiment, the light<br>
chain comprises amino acid sequences that are the same as the CDR regions of the<br>
light chain of 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the light chain comprises an amino acid sequence from at least one CDR<br>
region of the light chain of 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the light chain comprises amino acid sequences from<br>
CDRs from different light chains. In a more preferred embodiment, the CDRs from<br>
different light chains are obtained from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or<br>
6.1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the light chain comprises an amino acid<br>
sequence selected from SEQ ED NOS: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 or 22. In another embodiment,<br>
the light chain comprises an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic acid sequence<br>
selected from SEQ ID NOS: 1,5,9, 13, 17 or 21, or a nucleic acid sequence that<br>
encodes an amino acid sequence having 1-10 amino acid insertions, deletions or<br>
substitutions therefrom. Preferably, the amino acid substitutions are conservative<br>
amino acid substitutions. In another embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof<br>
comprises a lambda light chain.<br>
The present invention also provides an anti-IGF-IR antibody or portion<br>
thereof comprises a human heavy chain or a sequence derived from a human heavy<br><br>
30<br>
chain. In one embodiment, the heavy chain amino acid sequence is derived from a<br>
human VH DP-35, DP-47, DP-70, DP-71 or VIV-4/4.35 gene family. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the heavy chain amino acid sequence is derived from a human VH DP-<br>
47 gene family. In a more preferred embodiment, the heavy chain comprises no more<br>
than eight amino acid changes from germline VH DP-35, DP-47, DP-70, DP-71 or<br>
VIV-4/4.35, more preferably no more than six amino acid changes, and even more<br>
preferably no more than three amino acid changes.<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 4, 8,12,16,20 and 24 provide the amino acid<br>
sequences of the variable regions of six anti-IGF-IR heavy chains. SEQ ID NOS: 30,<br>
32, 34, 36 and 44 provide the amino acid sequences and SEQ ID NOS: 29, 31, 33, 35<br>
and 43 provide the nucleotide sequences of the germline heavy chains DP-35, DP-47,<br>
DP-70, DP-71 and VIV-4, respectively. Figs. 2A-2D show the alignments of the<br>
amino acid sequences of the variable region of the six anti-IGF-IR antibodies to their<br>
corresponding germline sequences. Following the teachings of this specification, one<br>
of ordinary skill in the art could determine the encoded amino acid sequence of the six<br>
anti-IGF-IR heavy chains and the germline heavy chains and determine the<br>
differences between the germline sequences and the antibody sequences.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the VH of the anti-IGF-IR antibody<br>
contains the same amino acid substitutions, relative to the germline amino acid<br>
sequence, as anyone or more of the VH of antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2,2.14.3, 3.1.1,<br>
4.9.2,4.17.3 or 6.1.1. Similar to what was discussed above, the VH of the anti-IGF-<br>
IR antibody may contain one or more amino acid substitutions that are the same as<br>
those present in antibody 2.13.2, another amino acid substitution that is the same as<br>
that present in antibody 2.14.3, and another amino acid substitution that is the same as<br>
antibody 4.9.2. In this manner, one can mix and match different features of antibody<br>
binding in order to alter, e.g., the affinity of the antibody for IGF-IR or its dissociation<br>
rate from the antigen. In another embodiment, the amino acid substitutions are made<br>
in the same position as those found in any one or more of the VH of antibodies 2.12.1,<br>
2.13.2,	2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.17.3., 4.9.2 or 6.1.1, but conservative amino acid substitutions<br>
are made rather than using the same amino acid.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the heavy chain comprises an amino<br>
acid sequence that is the same as the amino acid sequence of the VH of 2.12.1, 2.13.2,<br>
2.14.3,	3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another highly preferred embodiment, the<br><br>
31<br>
heavy chain comprises amino acid sequences that are the same as the CDR regions of<br>
the heavy chain of 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another<br>
preferred embodiment, the heavy chain comprises an amino acid sequence from at<br>
least one CDR region of the heavy chain of 2.12.1, 2.13.2,2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2,4.17.3<br>
or 6.1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the heavy chain comprises amino acid<br>
sequences from CDRs from different heavy chains. In a more preferred embodiment,<br>
the CDRs from different heavy chains are obtained from 2.12.1, 2.13.2,2.14.3, 3.1.1,<br>
4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another preferred embodiment, the heavy chain comprises an<br>
amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 or 24. In another<br>
embodiment, the heavy chain comprises an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic<br>
acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 3, 7, 11, 15,19 or 23, or a nucleic acid<br>
sequence that encodes an amino acid sequence having 1-10 amino acid insertions,<br>
deletions or substitutions therefrom. In another embodiment, the substitutions are<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions.<br>
Inhibition of IGF-IR Activity by Anti-IGF-IR Antibody<br>
Inhibition of IGF-I Binding to IGF-IR<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an ahti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody that inhibits the binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR or the binding of IGF-II to IGF-<br>
IR. In a preferred embodiment, the IGF-IR is human. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is a human antibody. In another embodiment,<br>
the antibody or portion thereof inhibits binding between IGF-IR and IGF-I with an<br>
IC50 of no more than 100 nM. In a preferred embodiment, the IC50 is no more than 10<br>
nM. In a more preferred embodiment, the IC50 is no more than 5 nM. The IC50 can<br>
be measured by any method known in the art. Typically, an IC50 can be measured by<br>
ELISA or RIA. In a preferred embodiment, the IC50 is measured by RIA.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody that prevents activation of the IGF-IR in the presence of IGF-I. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody inhibits IGF-IR-induced tyrasine<br>
phosphorylation that occurs upon occupancy of the receptor. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody inhibits downstream cellular events from<br>
occurring. For instance, the anti-IGF-IR can inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of She<br>
and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2, all of which are normally phosphorylated<br><br>
32<br>
when cells are treated with IGF-I (Kim et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273: 34543-34550,<br>
1998). One can determine whether an anti-IGF-IR antibody can prevent activation of<br>
IGF-IR in the presence of IGF-1 by determining the levels of autophosphorylation for<br>
IGF-IR, She, IRS-1 or IRS-2 by Western blot or immunopreciptation. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, one would, determine the levels of autophosphorylation of IGF-IR by<br>
Western blot. See, e.g., Example VII.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the antibody causes the<br>
downregulation of IGF-IR from a cell treated with the antibody. In one embodiment,<br>
the IGF-IR is internalized into the cytoplasm of the cell. After the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody binds to IGF-IR, the antibody is internalized, as shown by confocal<br>
microscopy. Without wishing to be bound to any theory, it is believed that the<br>
antibody-IGF-IR complex is internalized into a lysosome and degraded. One may<br>
measure the downregulation of IGF-IR by any method known in the art including<br>
immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy or Western blot. See, e.g., Example VII.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2,<br>
or 6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light chain or antigen-binding region thereof.<br>
Activation of IGF-IR by Anti-IGF-IR Antibody<br>
Another aspect of the present invention involves activating anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies. An activating antibody differs from an inhibiting antibody because it<br>
amplifies or substitutes for the effects of IGF-I on IGF-IR. In one embodiment, the<br>
activating antibody is able to bind to IGF-IR and cause it to be activated in the<br>
absence of IGF-I. This type of activating antibody is essentially a mimic of IGF-I. In<br>
another embodiment, the activating antibody amplifies the effect of IGF-I on IGF-IR.<br>
This type of antibody does not activate IGF-IR by itself, but rather increases the<br>
activation of IGF-ER in the presence of IGF-I. A mimic anti-IGF-IR antibody may be<br>
easily distinguished from an amplifying anti-IGF-IR antibody by treating cells in vitro<br>
with an antibody in the presence or absence of low levels of IGF-I. If the antibody is<br>
able to cause IGF-IR activation in the absence of IGF-I, e.g., it increases IGF-IR<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation, then the antibody is a mimic antibody. If the antibody<br>
cannot cause IGF-IR activation in the absence of IGF-I but is able to amplify the<br>
amount of IGF-IR activation, then the antibody is an amplifying antibody. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the activating antibody is 4.17.3. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody comprises one or more CDRs from 4.17.3. In another<br><br>
33<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibody is derived from either or both of the germline<br>
sequences 012 (light chain) and/or D71 (heavy chain).<br>
Inhibition of IGF-IR Tyrosine Phosphorylation, IGF-IR Levels and Tumor Cell<br>
Growth In Vivo by Anti-IGF-IR Antibodies<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody that inhibits IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor levels in vivo. In<br>
one embodiment, administration of anti-IGF-IR antibody to an animal causes a<br>
reduction in IGF-IR phosphotyrosine signal in IGF-IR-expressing tumors. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody causes a reduction in<br>
phosphotyrosine signal by at least 20%. In a more preferred embodiment, the anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibody causes a decrease in phosphotyrosine signal by at least 60%, more<br>
preferably 50%. In an even more preferred embodiment, the antibody causes a<br>
decrease in phosphotyrosine signal of at least 40%, more preferably 30%, even more<br>
preferably 20%. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered<br>
approximately 24 hours before the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation are measured.<br>
The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation may be measured by any method known in the<br>
art, such as those described infra. See, e.g., Example III and Figure 5. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody is selected from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2, or<br>
6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light chain or antigen-binding portion thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, administration of anti-IGF-IR antibody to an<br>
animal causes a reduction in IGF-IR levels in IGF-IR-expressing tumors. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody causes a reduction in receptor levels<br>
by at least 20% compared to an untreated animal. In a more preferred embodiment,<br>
the anti-IGF-IR antibody causes a decrease in receptor levels to at least 60%, more<br>
preferably 50% of the receptor levels in an untreated animal. In an even more<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibody causes a decrease in receptor levels to at least<br>
40%, more preferably 30%. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is administered<br>
approximately 24 hours before the IGF-IR levels are measured. The IGF-IR levels<br>
may be measured by any method known in the art, such as those described infra. See,<br>
e.g., Example VIII and Figure 6. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected<br>
from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2, or 6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light<br>
chain or antigen-binding portion thereof.<br><br>
34<br>
In another embodiment, an anti-IGF-IR antibody inhibits tumor cell<br>
growth in vivo. The tumor cell may be derived from any cell type including, without<br>
limitation, epidermal, epithelial, endothelial, leukemia, sarcoma, multiple myeloma or<br>
mesodermal cells. Examples of tumor cells include A549 (non-small cell lung<br>
carcinoma) cells, MCF-7 cells, Colo 205 cells, 3T3/IGF-IR cells and A431 cells. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibody inhibits tumor cell growth as compared to the<br>
growth of the tumor in an untreated animal. In a more preferred embodiment, the<br>
antibody inhibits tumor cell growth by 50%. In an even more preferred embodiment,<br>
the antibody inhibits tumor cell growth by 60%, 65%, 70% or 75%. In one<br>
embodiment, the inhibition of tumor cell growth is measured at least 7 days after the<br>
animals have started treatment with the antibody. In a more preferred embodiment,<br>
the inhibition of tumor cell growth is measured at least 14 days after the animals have<br>
started treatment with the antibody. In another preferred embodiment, another<br>
antineoplastic agent is administered to the animal with the anti-IGF-IR antibody. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the antineoplastic agent is able to further inhibit tumor cell<br>
growth. In an even more preferred embodiment, the antineoplastic agent is<br>
adriamycin, taxol, tamoxifen, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FU) or CP-358,774. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the co-administration of an antineoplastic agent and the anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibody inhibits tumor cell growth by at least 50%, more preferably 60%,<br>
65%, 70% or 75%, more preferably 80%, 85% or 90% after a period of 22-24 days.<br>
See, e.g., Fig. 7 and Example IX. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected<br>
from 2.12.1, 2.13.2,2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, or 6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light<br>
chain or antigen-binding portion thereof.<br>
Induction of Apoptosis by Anti-IGF-IR Antibodies<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides an anti-IGF-IR antibody that<br>
induces cell death. In one embodiment, the antibody causes apoptosis. The antibody<br>
may induce apoptosis either in vivo or in vitro. In general, tumor cells are more<br>
sensitive to apoptosis than normal cells, such that administration of an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody causes apoptosis of a tumor cell preferentially to that of a normal cell. In<br>
another embodiment, the administration of an anti-IGF-IR antibody decreases levels<br>
of an enzyme, akt, which is involved in the phosphatidyl inositol (PI) kinase pathway.<br>
The PI kinase pathway, in turn, is involved in the cell proliferation and prevention of<br>
apoptosis. Thus, inhibition of akt can cause apoptosis. In a more preferred<br><br>
35<br>
embodiment, the antibody is administered in vivo to cause apoptosis of an IGF-IR-<br>
expressing cell. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected from 2.12.1,<br>
2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, or 6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light chain or<br>
antigen-binding portion thereof.<br>
Methods of Producing Antibodies and Antibody-Producing Cell Lines<br>
Immunization<br>
In one embodiment of the instant invention, human antibodies are<br>
produced by immunizing a non-human animal comprising some or all of the human<br>
immunoglobulin locus with an IGF-IR antigen. In a preferred embodiment, the non-<br>
human animal is a XENOMOUSE™, which is an engineered mouse strain that<br>
comprises large fragments of the human immunoglobulin loci and is deficient in<br>
mouse antibody production. See, e.g., Green et al. Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994)<br>
and United States Patents 5,916,771, 5,939,598, 5,985,615, 5,998,209, 6,075,181,<br>
6,091,001, 6,114,598 and 6,130,364. See also WO 91/10741, published July 25,<br>
1991, WO 94/02602, published February 3, 1994, WO 96/34096 and WO 96/33735,<br>
both published October 31, 1996, WO 98/16654, published April 23, 1998, WO<br>
98/24893, published June 11,1998, WO 98/50433, published November 12, 1998,<br>
WO 99/45031, published September 10, 1999, WO 99/53049, published October 21,<br>
1999, WO 00 09560, published February 24, 2000 and WO 00/037504, published<br>
June 29, 2000. The XENOMOUSE ™ produces an adult-like human repertoire of<br>
fully human antibodies, and generates antigen-specific human Mabs. A second<br>
generation XENOMOUSE ™ contains approximately 80% of the human antibody<br>
repertoire through introduction of megabase sized, germline configuration YAC<br>
fragments of the human heavy chain loci and K light chain loci. See Mendez et al.<br>
Nature Genetics 15:146-156 (1997), Green and Jakobovits J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495<br>
(1998), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The invention also provides a method for making anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies from non-human, non-mouse animals by immunizing non-human -<br>
transgenic animals that comprise human immunoglobulin loci. One may produce<br>
such animals using the methods described immediately above. The methods disclosed<br>
in these patents may modified as described in United States Patent 5,994,619. In a<br><br>
36<br>
preferred embodiment, the non-human animals may be rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle<br>
or horses.<br>
In another embodiment, the non-human animal comprising human<br>
immunoglobulin gene loci are animals that have a "minilocus" of human<br>
immunoglobulins. In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked<br>
through the inclusion of individual genes from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more VH<br>
genes, one or more DH genes, one or more JH genes, a mu constant region, and a<br>
second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a<br>
construct for insertion into an animal. This approach is described, inter alia, in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,545,807, 5,545,806, 5,625,825, 5,625,126, 5,633,425, 5,661,016,<br>
5,770,429, 5,789,650, 5,814,318, 5,591,669, 5,612,205, 5,721,367, 5,789,215, and<br>
5,643,763, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
An advantage of the minilocus approach is the rapidity with which<br>
constructs including portions of the Ig locus can be generated and introduced into<br>
animals. However, a potential disadvantage of the minilocus approach is that there<br>
may not be sufficient immunoglobulin diversity to support full B-cell development,<br>
such that there may be lower antibody production.<br>
In order to produce a human anti-IGF-IR antibody, a non-human<br>
animal comprising some or all of the human immunoglobulin loci is immunized with<br>
an IGF-IR antigen and the antibody or the antibody-producing cell is isolated from the<br>
animal. The IGF-IR antigen may be isolated and/or purified IGF-IR and is preferably<br>
a human IGF-IR. In another embodiment, the IGF-IR antigen is a fragment of IGF-<br>
IR, preferably the extracellular domain of IGF-IR. In another embodiment, the IGF-IR<br>
antigen is a fragment that comprises at least one epitope of IGF-ER. In another<br>
embodiment, the IGF-IR antigen is a cell that expresses IGF-IR on its cell surface,<br>
preferably a cell that overexpresses IGF-IR on its cell surface.<br>
Immunization of animals may be done by any method known in the<br>
art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. New York: Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Press, 1990. Methods for immunizing non-human animals such as<br>
mice, rats, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle and horses are well known in the art. See, e.g.,<br>
Harlow and Lane and United States Patent 5,994,619. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
IGF-IR antigen is administered with a adjuvant to stimulate the immune response.<br>
Such adjuvants include complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant, RIBI (muramyl<br><br>
37<br>
dipeptides) or ISCOM (immunostimulating complexes). Such adjuvants may protect<br>
the polypeptide from rapid dispersal by sequestering it in a local deposit, or they may<br>
contain substances that stimulate the host to secrete factors that are chemotactic for<br>
macrophages and other components of the immune system. Preferably, if a<br>
polypeptide is being administered, the immunization schedule will involve two or<br>
more administrations of the polypeptide, spread out over several weeks.<br>
Example I provides an protocol for immunizing a XENOMOUSE<br>
with full-length human IGF-IR in phosphate-buffered saline.<br>
Production of Antibodies and Antibody-Producing Cell Lines<br>
After immunization of an animal with an IGF-IR antigen, antibodies<br>
and/or antibody-producing cells may be obtained from the animal. An anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody-containing serum is obtained from the animal by bleeding or sacrificing the<br>
animal. The serum may be used as it is obtained from the animal, an immunoglobulin<br>
fraction may be obtained from the serum, or the anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be<br>
purified from the serum. Serum or immunoglobulins obtained in this manner are<br>
polyclonal, which are disadvantageous because the amount of antibodies that can be<br>
obtained is limited and the polyclonal antibody has a heterogeneous array of<br>
properties.<br>
In another embodiment, antibody-producing immortalized hybridomas<br>
may be prepared from the immunized animal. After immunization, the animal is<br>
sacrificed and the splenic B cells are fused to immortalized myeloma cells as is well-<br>
known in the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
myeloma cells do not secrete immunoglobulin polypeptides (a non-secretory cell<br>
line). After fusion and antibiotic selection, the hybridomas are screened using IGF-<br>
IR, a portion thereof, or a cell expressing IGF-IR. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
initial screening is performed using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) or a<br>
radioimmunoassay (RIA), preferably an ELISA. An example of ELISA screening is<br>
provided in WO 00/37504, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, antibody-producing cells may be prepared<br>
from a human who has an autoimmune disorder and who expresses anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies. Cells expressing the anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be isolated by isolating<br>
white blood cells and subjecting them to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)<br>
or by panning on plates coated with IGF-IR or a portion thereof. These cells may be<br><br>
38<br>
fused with a human non-secretory myeloma to produce human hybridomas expressing<br>
human anti-IGF-IR antibodies. In general, this is a less preferred embodiment<br>
because it is likely that the anti-IGF-IR antibodies will have a low affinity for IGF-IR.<br>
Anti-IGF-IR antibody-producing hybridomas are selected, cloned and<br>
further screened for desirable characteristics, including robust hybridoma growth,<br>
high antibody production and desirable antibody characteristics, as discussed further<br>
below. Hybridomas may be cultured and expanded in vivo in syngeneic animals, in<br>
animals that lack an immune system, e.g., nude mice, or in cell culture in vitro.<br>
Methods of selecting, cloning and expanding hybridomas are well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Preferably, the immunized animal is a non-human animal that<br>
expresses human immunoglobulin genes and the splenic B cells are fused to a<br>
myeloma derived from the same species as the non-human animal. More preferably,<br>
the immunized animal is a XENOMOUSE   and the myeloma cell line is a non-<br>
secretory mouse myeloma, such as the myeloma cell line is NSO-bcl2. See, e.g.,<br>
Example I.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides hybridomas are produced that<br>
produce human anti-IGF-IR antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the hybridomas<br>
are mouse hybridomas, as described above. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
hybridomas are produced in a non-human, non-mouse species such as rats, sheep,<br>
pigs, goats, cattle or horses. In another embodiment, the hybridomas are human<br>
hybridomas, in which a human non-secretory myeloma is fused with a human cell<br>
expressing an anti-IGF-IR antibody.<br>
Nucleic Acids, Vectors, Host Cells and<br>
Recombinant Methods of Making Antibodies<br>
Nucleic Acids<br>

invention are provided. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes a<br>

immunoglobulin and another nucleic acid molecule encodes the light chain of an anti-<br>
IGF-IR immunoglobulin. In a more preferred embodiment, the encoded<br><br>

2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2,4.17.3 or 6.1.1. The invention also provides a nucleic acid<br>

one of the light chains of 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence<br>
that encodes the amino acid sequence of all of the CDRs of any one of the light chains<br>
of 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2,4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another embodiment, the<br>
nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the amino acid<br>
sequence of one of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 or 22 or comprises a nucleic acid<br>
sequence of one of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 5, 9,13, 17 or 21. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence that<br>
encodes the amino acid sequence of one or more of the CDRs of any one of SEQ ID<br>
NOS: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 or 22 or comprises a nucleic acid sequence of one or more of<br>
the CDRs of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 or 21. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleic acid sequence that<br>
encodes the amino acid sequence of all of the CDRs of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6,<br><br>

42<br>
The nucleic acid molecule encoding either or both of the entire heavy<br>
and light chains of an anti-IGF-IR antibody or the variable regions thereof may be<br>
obtained from any source that produces an anti-IGF-IR antibody. Methods of<br>
isolating mRNA encoding an antibody are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook<br>
et al. The mRNA may be used to produce cDNA for use in the polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR) or cDNA cloning of antibody genes. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the nucleic acid molecules may be obtained from a hybridoma that<br>
expresses an anti-IGF-IR antibody, as described above, preferably a hybridoma that<br>
has as one of its fusion partners a transgenic animal cell that expresses human<br>
immunoglobulin genes, such as a XENOMOUSE "*, non-human mouse transgenic<br>
animal or a non-human, non-mouse transgenic animal. In another embodiment, the<br>
hybridoma is derived from a non-human, non-transgenic animal, which may be used,<br>
e.g., for humanized antibodies.<br>
A nucleic acid molecule encoding the entire heavy chain of an anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibody may be constructed by fusing a nucleic acid molecule encoding the<br>
variable domain of a heavy chain or an antigen-binding domain thereof with a<br>
constant domain of a heavy chain. Similarly, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the<br>
light chain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody may be constructed by fusing a nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding the variable domain of a light chain or an antigen-binding domain<br>
thereof with a constant domain of a light chain. The nucleic acid molecules encoding<br>
the VH and VL chain may be converted to full-length antibody genes by inserting<br>
them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain<br>
constant regions, respectively, such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the<br>
heavy chain constant region (CH) segment(s) within the vector and the VL segment is<br>
operatively linked to the light chain constant region (CL) segment within the vector.<br>
Alternatively, the nucleic acid molecules encoding the VH or VL chains are converted<br>
into full-length antibody genes by linking, e.g., ligating, the nucleic acid molecule<br>
encoding a VH chain to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a CH chain using standard<br>
molecular biological techniques. The same may be achieved using nucleic acid<br>
molecules encoding VL and CL chains. The sequences of human heavy and light<br>
chain constant region genes are known in the art. See, e.g., Kabat et al., Sequences of<br>
Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., NIH Publ. No. 91-3242, 1991. Nucleic<br>
acid molecules encoding the full-length heavy and/or light chains may then be<br><br>
43<br>
expressed from a cell into which they have been introduced and the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody isolated.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid encoding the variable<br>
region of the heavy chain encodes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 4, 8,12,<br>
16, 20 or 24, and the nucleic acid molecule encoding the variable region of the light<br>
chains encodes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 or 22. SEQ<br>
ID NO: 28 depicts the amino acid sequence and SEQ ID NO: 27 depicts the nucleic<br>
acid sequence encoding the constant region of the heavy chain of the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 and 6.1.1. SEQ ID NO: 26<br>
depicts the amino acid sequence and SEQ ID NO: 25 depicts the nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding the constant region of the light chain of the anti-IGF-IR antibodies<br>
2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 and 6.1.1. Thus, in a preferred embodiment,<br>
the nucleic acid molecule encoding the constant domain of the heavy chain encodes<br>
SEQ ID NO: 28, and the nucleic acid molecule encoding the constant domain of the<br>
light chain encodes SEQ ID NO: 26. In a more preferred embodiment, the nucleic<br>
acid molecule encoding the constant domain of the heavy chain has the nucleic acid<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 27, and the nucleic acid molecule encoding the constant<br>
domain has the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 25.<br>
In another embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule encoding either the<br>
heavy chain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody or an antigen-binding domain thereof, or the<br>
light chain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody or an antigen-binding domain thereof may be<br>
isolated from a non-human, non-mouse animal that expresses human immunoglobulin<br>
genes and has been immunized with an IGF-IR antigen. In other embodiment, the<br>
nucleic acid molecule may be isolated from an anti-IGF-IR antibody-producing cell<br>
derived from a non-transgenic animal or from a human patient who produces anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibodies. Methods of isolating mRNA from the anti-IGF-IR antibody-<br>
producing cells may be isolated by standard techniques, cloned and/or amplified using<br>
PCR and library construction techniques, and screened using standard protocols to<br>
obtain nucleic acid molecules encoding anti-IGF-IR heavy and light chains.   .<br>
The nucleic acid molecules may be used to recombinantly express<br>
large quantities of anti-IGF-IR antibodies, as described below. The nucleic acid<br>
molecules may also be used to produce chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies,<br>
immunoadhesins, diabodies, mutated antibodies and antibody derivatives, as<br><br>
44<br>
described further below. If the nucleic acid molecules are derived from a non-human,<br>
non-transgenic animal, the nucleic acid molecules may be used for antibody<br>
humanization, also as described below.<br>
In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules of the invention<br>
may be used as probes or PCR primers for specific antibody sequences. For instance,<br>
a nucleic acid molecule probe may be used in diagnostic methods or a nucleic acid<br>
molecule PCR primer may be used to amplify regions of DNA that could be used,<br>
inter alia, to isolate nucleic acid sequences for use in producing variable domains of<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules are<br>
oligonucleotides. In a more preferred embodiment, the oligonucleotides are from<br>
highly variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the antibody of interest. In an<br>
even more preferred embodiment, the oligonucleotides encode all or a part of one or<br>
moreoftheCDRs.<br>
Vectors<br>
The invention provides vectors comprising the nucleic acid molecules<br>
of the invention that encode the heavy chain or the antigen-binding portion thereof.<br>
The invention also provides vectors comprising the nucleic acid molecules of the<br>
invention that encode the light chain or antigen-binding portion thereof. The<br>
invention also provides vectors comprising nucleic acid molecules encoding fusion<br>
proteins, modified antibodies, antibody fragments, and probes thereof.<br>
To express the antibodies, or antibody portions of the invention, DNAs<br>
encoding partial or full-length light and heavy chains, obtained as described above,<br>
are inserted into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked to<br>
transcriptional and translational control sequences. Expression vectors include<br>
plasmids, retroviruses, cosmids, YACs, EBV derived episomes, and the like. The<br>
antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control<br>
sequences within the vector serve their intended function of regulating the<br>
transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector and<br>
expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host<br>
cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be<br>
inserted into separate vector. In a preferred embodiment, both genes are inserted into<br>
the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression<br>
vector by standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the<br><br>
45<br>
antibody gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are<br>
present).<br>
A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human<br>
CH or CL immunoglobulin sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so<br>
that any VH or VL sequence can be easily inserted and expressed, as described above.<br>
In such vectors, splicing usually occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted J<br>
region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C region, and also at the<br>
splice regions that occur within the human CH exons. Polyadenylation and<br>
transcription termination occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of the coding<br>
regions. The recombinant expression vector can also encode a signal peptide that<br>
facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain gene<br>
may be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in-frame to the<br>
amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an<br>
immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterologous signal peptide (i.e., a signal peptide<br>
from a non-immunoglobulin protein).<br>
In addition to the antibody chain genes, the recombinant expression<br>
vectors of the invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the<br>
antibody chain genes in a host cell. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art<br>
that the design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory<br>
sequences may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed,<br>
the level of expression of protein desired, etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for<br>
mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of<br>
protein expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived<br>
from retroviral LTRs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (such as the CMV<br>
promoter/enhancer), Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (such as the SV40 promoter/enhancer),<br>
adenovirus, (e.g., the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP)), polyoma and strong<br>
mammalian promoters such as native immunoglobulin and actin promoters. For<br>
further description of viral regulatory elements, and sequences thereof, see e.g., U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,168,062 by Stinski, U.S. Pat. No. 4,510,245 by Bell et al. and U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,968,615 by Schaffher et al.<br>
In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences, the<br>
recombinant expression vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences, such<br>
as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g., origins of<br><br>
46<br>
replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates<br>
selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see e.g., U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 4,399.216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017, all by Axel et al.). For example, typically<br>
the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or<br>
methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred<br>
selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in<br>
dhfr- host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418<br>
selection).<br>
Non-Hybridoma Host Cells and Methods<br>
of Recombinantly Producing Protein<br>
Nucleic acid molecules encoding the heavy chain or an antigen-<br>
binding portion thereof and/or the light chain or an antigen-binding portion thereof of<br>
an anti-IGF-IR antibody, and vectors comprising these nucleic acid molecules, can be<br>
used for transformation of a suitable mammalian host cell. Transformation can be by<br>
any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell. Methods for<br>
introduction of heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in<br>
the art and include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation,<br>
polybrene-mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of<br>
the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, biolistic injection and direct microinjection of the<br>
DNA into nuclei. In addition, nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into<br>
mammalian cells by viral vectors. Methods of transforming cells are well known in<br>
the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040,4,740,461, and 4,959,455<br>
(which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known<br>
in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection (ATCC). These include, inter alia, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)<br>
cells, NSO, SP2 cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney<br>
cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), A549 cells, 3T3<br>
cells, and a number of other cell lines. Mammalian host cells include human,-mouse,<br>
rat, dog, monkey, pig, goat, bovine, horse and hamster cells. Cell lines of particular<br>
preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression<br>
levels. Other cell lines that may be used are insect cell lines, such as Sf9 cells,<br>
amphibian cells, bacterial cells, plant cells and fungal cells. When recombinant<br><br>
47<br>
expression vectors encoding the heavy chain or antigen-binding portion thereof, the<br>
light chain and/or antigen-binding portion thereof are introduced into mammalian host<br>
cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time<br>
sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably,<br>
secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown.<br>
Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein<br>
purification methods.<br>
Further, expression of antibodies of the invention (or other moieties<br>
therefrom) from production cell lines can be enhanced using a number of known<br>
techniques. For example, the glutamine synthetase gene expression system (the GS<br>
system) is a common approach for enhancing expression under certain conditions.<br>
The GS system is discussed in whole or part in connection with European Patent Nos.<br>
0 216 846, 0 256 055, and 0 323 997 and European Patent Application No.<br>
89303964.4.<br>
It it likely that antibodies expressed by different cell lines or in<br>
transgenic animals will have different glycosylation from each other. However, all<br>
antibodies encoded by the nucleic acid molecules provided herein, or comprising the<br>
amino acid sequences provided herein are part of the instant invention, regardless of<br>
the glycosylation of the antibodies.<br>
Transgenic Animals<br>
The invention also provides transgenic non-human animals comprising<br>
one or more nucleic acid molecules of the invention that may be used to produce<br>
antibodies of the invention. Antibodies can be produced in and recovered from tissue<br>
or bodily fluids, such as milk, blood or urine, of goats, cows, horses, pigs, rats, mice,<br>
rabbits, hamsters or other mammals. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,827,690, 5,756,687,<br>
5,750,172, and 5,741,957. As described above, non-human transgenic animals that<br>
comprise human immunoglobulin loci can be produced by immunizing with IGF-IR<br>
or a portion thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, non-human transgenic animals are produced<br>
by introducing one or more nucleic acid molecules of the invention intr the animal by<br>
standard transgenic techniques. See Hogan, supra. The transgenic cells used for<br>
making the transgenic animal can be embryonic stem cells or somatic cells. The<br>
transgenic non-human organisms can be chimeric, nonchimeric heterozygotes, and<br><br>
48<br>
nonchimeric homozygotes. See, e.g., Hogan et ai, Manipulating the Mouse Embrvo:<br>
A Laboratory Manual 2ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press (1999); Jackson et al., Mose<br>
Genetics and Transgenics: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press (2000); and<br>
Pinkert, Trans genie Animal Technology: A Laboratory Handbook, Academic Press<br>
(1999). In another embodiment, the transgenic non-human organisms may have a<br>
targeted disruption and replacement that encodes a heavy chain and/or a light chain of<br>
interest. In a preferred embodiment, the transgenic animals comprise and express<br>
nucleic acid molecules encoding heavy and light chains that bind specifically to IGF-<br>
IR, preferably human IGF-IR. In another embodiment, the transgenic animals<br>
comprise nucleic acid molecules encoding a modified antibody such as a single-chain<br>
antibody, a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. The anti-IGF-IR antibodies<br>
may be made in any transgenic animal. In a preferred embodiment, the non-human<br>
animals are mice, rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle or horses. The non-human transgenic<br>
animal expresses said encoded polypeptides in blood, milk, urine, saliva, tears, mucus<br>
and other bodily fluids.<br>
Phage Display Libraries<br>
The invention provides a method for producing an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof comprising the steps of synthesizing a<br>
library of human antibodies on phage, screening the library with a IGF-IR or a portion<br>
thereof, isolating phage that bind IGF-IR, and obtaining the antibody from the phage.<br>
One method to prepare the library of antibodies comprises the steps of immunizing a<br>
non-human host animal comprising a human immunoglobulin locus with IGF-IR or<br>
an antigenic portion thereof to create an immune response, extracting cells from the<br>
host animal the cells that are responsible for production of antibodies; isolating RNA<br>
from the extracted cells, reverse transcribing the RNA to produce cDNA, amplifying<br>
the cDNA using a primer, and inserting the cDNA into phage display vector such that<br>
antibodies are expressed on the phage. Recombinant anti-IGF-IR antibodies of the<br>
invention may be obtained in this way.<br>
Recombinant anti-IGF-IR human antibodies of the invention in<br>
addition to the anti-IGF-IR antibodies disclosed herein can be isolated by screening of<br>
a recombinant combinatorial antibody library, preferably a scFv phage display library,<br>
prepared using human VL and VH cDNAs prepared from mRNA derived from human<br>
lymphocytes. Methodologies for preparing and screening such libraries are known in<br><br>
49<br>
the art. There are commercially available kits for generating phage display libraries<br>
(e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, catalog no. 27-9400-01;<br>
and the Stratagene SurfZAP™ phage display kit, catalog no. 240612). There are also<br>
other methods and reagents that can be used in generating and screening antibody<br>
display libraries (see, e.g., Ladner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Kang et al. PCT<br>

In a preferred embodiment, to isolate human anti-IGF-IR antibodies<br>
with the desired characteristics, a human anti-IGF-IR antibody as described herein is<br>
first used to select human heavy and light chain sequences having similar binding<br>
activity toward IGF-IR, using the epitope imprinting methods described in<br>
Hoogenboom et al., PCT Publication No. WO 93/06213. The antibody libraries used<br>
in this method are preferably scFv libraries prepared and screened as described in<br>
McCafferty et al., PCT Publication No. WO 92/01047, McCafferty et al., Nature<br>
(1990) 348:552-554; and Griffiths et al., (1993) EMBO J 12:725-734. The scFv<br>
antibody libraries preferably are screened using human IGF-IR as the antigen.<br>
Once initial human VL and VH segments are selected, "mix and<br>
match" experiments, in which different pairs of the initially selected VL and VH<br>
segments are screened for IGF-IR binding, are performed to select preferred VL/VH<br>
pair combinations. Additionally, to further improve the quality of the antibody, the<br>
VL and VH segments of the preferred VL/VH pair(s) can be randomly mutated,<br>
preferably within the CDR3 region of VH and/or VL, in a process analogous to the in<br>
vivo somatic mutation process responsible for affinity maturation of antibodies during<br><br>
50<br>
a natural immune response. This in vitro affinity maturation can be accomplished by<br>
amplifying VH and VL regions using PCR primers complimentary to the VH CDR3<br>
or VL CDR3, respectively, which primers have been "spiked" with a random mixture<br>
of the four nucleotide bases at certain positions such that the resultant PCR products<br>
encode VH and VL segments into which random mutations have been introduced into<br>
the VH and/or VL CDR3 regions. These randomly mutated VH and VL segments can<br>
be rescreened for binding to IGF-IR.<br>
Following screening and isolation of an anti-IGF-IR antibody of the<br>
invention from a recombinant immunoglobulin display library, nucleic acid encoding<br>
the selected antibody can be recovered from the display package (e.g., from the phage<br>
genome) and subcloned into other expression vectors by standard recombinant DNA<br>
techniques. If desired, the nucleic acid can be further manipulated to create other<br>
antibody forms of the invention, as described below. To express a recombinant<br>
human antibody isolated by screening of a combinatorial library, the DNA encoding<br>
the antibody is cloned into a recombinant expression vector and introduced into a<br>
mammalian host cells, as described above.<br>
Class Switching<br>
Another aspect of the instant invention is to provide a mechanism by<br>
which the class of an anti-IGF-IR antibody may be switched with another. In one<br>
aspect of the invention, a nucleic acid molecule encoding VL or VH is isolated using<br>
methods well-known in the art such that it does not include any nucleic acid<br>
sequences encoding CL or CH. The nucleic acid molecule encoding VL or VH are<br>
then operatively linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a CL or CH from a<br>
different class of immunoglobulin molecule. This may be achieved using a vector or<br>
nucleic acid molecule that comprises a CL or CH chain, as described above. For<br>
example, an anti-IGF-IR antibody that was originally IgM may be class switched to<br>
an IgG. Further, the class switching may be used to convert one IgG subclass to<br>
another, e.g., from IgGl to IgG2. A preferred method for producing an antibody of<br>
the invention comprising a desired isotypes comprises the steps of isolating a nucleic<br>
acid encoding the heavy chain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody and a nucleic acid encoding<br>
the light chain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody, obtaining the variable region of the heavy<br>
chain, ligating the variable region of the heavy chain with the constant domain of a<br><br>
51<br>
heavy chain of the desired isotype, expressing the light chain and the ligated heavy<br>
chain in a cell, and collecting the anti-IGF-IR antibody with the desired isotype.<br>
Antibody Derivatives<br>
One may use the nucleic acid molecules described above to generate<br>
antibody derivatives using techniques and methods known to one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art.<br>
Humanized Antibodies<br>
As was discussed above in connection with human antibody<br>
generation, there are advantages to producing antibodies with reduced<br>
immunogenicity. This can be accomplished to some extent using techniques of<br>
humanization and display techniques using appropriate libraries. It will be<br>
appreciated that murine antibodies or antibodies from other species can be humanized<br>
or primatized using techniques well known in the art. See e.g., Winter and Harris<br>
Immunol Today 14:43-46 (1993) and Wright et al. Crit. Reviews in Immunol. 12125-<br>
168 (1992). The antibody of interest may be engineered by recombinant DNA<br>
techniques to substitute the CHI, CH2, CH3, hinge domains, and/or the framework<br>
domain with the corresponding human sequence {see WO 92/02190 and U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,530,101, 5,585,089, 5,693,761, 5,693,792, 5,714,350, and 5,777,085). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody can be humanized by substituting the<br>
CHI, CH2, CH3, hinge domains, and/or the framework domain with the<br>
corresponding human sequence while maintaining all of the CDRS of the heavy<br>
chain, the light chain or both the heavy and light chains.<br>
Mutated Antibodies<br>
In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules, vectors and host<br>
cells may be used to make mutated anti-IGF-IR antibodies. The antibodies may be<br>
mutated in the variable domains of the heavy and/or light chains to alter a binding<br>
property of the antibody. For example, a mutation may be made in one or more of the<br>
CDR regions to increase or decrease the Koff of the antibody for IGF-IR, to increase or<br>
decrease Koff, or to alter the binding specificity of the antibody. Techniques in site-<br>
directed mutagenesis are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al. and<br>
Ausubel et al., supra. In a preferred embodiment, mutations are made at an amino<br><br>
52<br>
acid residue that is known to be changed compared to germline in a variable region of<br>
an anti-IGF-IR antibody. In a more preferred embodiment, one or more mutations are<br>
made at an amino acid residue that is known to be changed compared to the germline<br>
in a variable region or CDR region of one of the anti-IGF-IR antibodies 2.12.1,<br>
2.13.2, 2.14.3,3.1.1,4.9.2,4.17.3 or 6.1.1. In another embodiment, one or more<br>
mutations are made at an amino acid residue that is known to be changed compared to<br>
the germline in a variable region or CDR region whose amino acid sequence is<br>
presented in SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,16, 18, 20, 22 or 24, or whose<br>
nucleic acid sequence is presented in SEQ ID NOS: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21<br>
or 23.   In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules are mutated in one or more<br>
of the framework regions. A mutation may be made in a framework region or<br>
constant domain to increase the half-life of the anti-IGF-IR antibody. See, e.g., WO<br>
00/09560, published February 24, 2000, herein incorporated by reference. In one<br>
embodiment, there may be one, three or five point mutations and no more than ten<br>
point mutations. A mutation in a framework region or constant domain may also be<br>
made to alter the immunogenicity of the antibody, to provide a site for covalent or<br>
non-covalent binding to another molecule, or to alter such properties as complement<br>
fixation. Mutations may be made in each of the framework regions, the constant<br>
domain and the variable regions in a single mutated antibody. Alternatively,<br>
mutations may be made in only one of the framework regions, the variable regions or<br>
the constant domain in a single mutated antibody.<br>
In one embodiment, there are no greater than ten amino acid changes<br>
in either the VH or VL regions of the mutated anti-IGF-IR antibody compared to the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody prior to mutation. In a more preferred embodiment, there is no<br>
more than five amino acid changes in either the VH or VL regions of the mutated<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody, more preferably no more than three amino acid changes. In<br>
another embodiment, there are no more than fifteen amino acid changes in the<br>
constant domains, more preferably, no more than ten amino acid changes, even more<br>
preferably, no more than five amino acid changes.<br>
Modified Antibodies<br>
In another embodiment, a fusion antibody or immunoadhesin may be<br>
made which comprises all or a portion of an anti-IGF-IR antibody linked to another<br>
polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, only the variable regions of the anti-IGF-IR<br><br>
53<br>
antibody are linked to the polypeptide. In another preferred embodiment, the VH<br>
domain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody are linked to a first polypeptide, while the VL<br>
domain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody are linked to a second polypeptide that associates<br>
with the first polypeptide in a manner in which the VH and VL domains can interact<br>
with one another to form an antibody binding site. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the VH domain is separated from the VL domain by a linker such that the VH and VL<br>
domains can interact with one another (see below under Single Chain Antibodies).<br>
The VH-linker-VL antibody is then linked to the polypeptide of interest. The fusion<br>
antibody is useful to directing a polypeptide to an IGF-IR-expressing cell or tissue.<br>
The polypeptide may be a therapeutic agent, such as a toxin, growth factor or other<br>
regulatory protein, or may be a diagnostic agent, such as an enzyme that may be<br>
easily visualized, such as horseradish peroxidase. In addition, fusion antibodies can<br>
be created in which two (or more) single-chain antibodies are linked to one another.<br>
This is useful if one wants to create a divalent or polyvalent antibody on a single<br>
polypeptide chain, or if one wants to create a bispecific antibody.<br>
To create a single chain antibody, (scFv) the VH- and VL-encoding<br>
DNA fragments are operatively linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker,<br>
e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4 -Ser)3 (SEQ ID NO: 60), such that the<br>
VH and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single-chain protein, with the<br>
VL and VH regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science<br>
242:423-426; Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883;<br>
McCafferty et al., Nature (1990) 348:552-554).   The single chain antibody may be<br>
monovalent, if only a single VH and VL are used, bivalent, if two VH and VL are<br>
used, or polyvalent, if more than two VH and VL are used.<br>
In another embodiment, other modified antibodies may be prepared<br>
using anti-IGF-IR-encoding nucleic acid molecules. For instance, "Kappa bodies" (111<br>
et al., Protein Eng 10: 949-57 (1997)), "Minibodies" (Martin et al., EMBO J13: 5303-<br>
9 (1994)), "Diabodies" (Holliger et al., PNAS USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993)), or<br>
"Janusins" (Traunecker et al., EMBO J10: 3655-3659 (1991) and Traunecker et al.<br>
"Janusin: new molecular design for bispecific reagents" Int J Cancer Suppl 7:51-52<br>
(1992)) may be prepared using standard molecular biological techniques following the<br>
teachings of the specification.<br><br>
54<br>
In another aspect, chimeric and bispecific antibodies can be generated.<br>
A chimeric antibody may be made that comprises CDRs and framework regions from<br>
different antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the CDRs of the chimeric antibody<br>
comprises all of the CDRs of the variable region of a light chain or heavy chain of an<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody, while the framework regions are derived from one or more<br>
different antibodies. In a more preferred embodiment, the CDRs of the chimeric<br>
antibody comprise all of the CDRs of the variable regions of the light chain and the<br>
heavy chain of an anti-IGF-IR antibody. The framework regions may be from another<br>
species and may, in a preferred embodiment, be humanized. Alternatively, the<br>
framework regions may be from another human antibody.<br>
A bispecific antibody can be generated that binds specifically to IGF-<br>
IR through one binding domain and to a second molecule through a second binding<br>
domain. The bispecific antibody can be produced through recombinant molecular<br>
biological techniques, or may be physically conjugated together. In addition, a single<br>
chain antibody containing more than one VH and VL may be generated that binds<br>
specifically to IGF-IR and to another molecule. Such bispecific antibodies can be<br>
generated using techniques that are well known for example, in connection with (i)<br>
and (ii) see e.g., Fanger et al. Immunol Methods 4: 72-81 (1994) and Wright and<br>
Harris, supra, and in connection with (iii) see e.g., Traunecker et al. Int. J. Cancer<br>
(Suppl.) 7: 51-52 (1992). In a preferred embodiment, the bispecific antibody binds to<br>
IGF-IR and to another molecule expressed at high level on cancer or tumor cells. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment, the other molecule is erbB2 receptor, VEGF, CD20 or<br>
EGF-R.<br>
In a embodiment, the modified antibodies described above are<br>
prepared using one or more of the variable regions or one or more CDR regions from<br>
one of the antibodies selected from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2, 4.17.3 or 6.1.1.<br>
In another embodiment, the modified antibodies are prepared using one or more of the<br>
variable regions or one or more CDR regions whose amino ?.cid sequence is presented<br>
in SEQ ID NOS: 2,4, 6, 8, 10,12, 14, 16,18, 20, 22 or 24, or whose nucleic acid<br>
sequence is presented in SEQ ID NOS: 1,3,5,7,9,11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 or 23.<br>
Derivatized and Labeled Antibodies<br>
An antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be derivatized or<br>
linked to another molecule (e.g., another peptide or protein). In general, the<br><br>
55<br>
antibodies or portion thereof is derivatized such that the IGF-DR. binding is not<br>
affected adversely by the derivatization or labeling. Accordingly, the antibodies and<br>
antibody portions of the invention are intended to include both intact and modified<br>
forms of the human anti-IGF-IR antibodies described herein. For example, an<br>
antibody or antibody portion of the invention can be functionally linked (by chemical<br>
coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other<br>
molecular entities, such as another antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody),<br>
a detection agent, a cytotoxic agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a protein or<br>
peptide that can mediate associate of the antibody or antibody portion with another<br>
molecule (such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).<br>
One type of derivatized antibody is produced by crosslinking two or<br>
more antibodies (of the same type or of different types, e.g., to create bispecific<br>
antibodies). Suitable crosslinkers include those that are heterobifunctional, having two<br>
distinctly reactive groups separated by an appropriate spacer (e.g.,<br>
m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) or homobifunctional (e.g.,<br>
disuccinimidyl suberate). Such linkers are available from Pierce Chemical Company,<br>
Rockford, 111.<br>
Another type of derivatized antibody is a labeled antibody. Useful<br>
detection agents with which an antibody or antibody portion of the invention may be<br>
derivatized include fluorescent compounds, including fluorescein, fluorescein<br>
isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-l-napthalenesulfonyl chloride,<br>
phycoerythrin, lanthanide phosphors and the like. An antibody may also be labeled<br>
with enzymes that are useful for detection, such as horseradish peroxidase,<br>
P-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase and the like. When<br>
an antibody is labeled with a detectable enzyme, it is detected by adding additional<br>
reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a reaction product that can be discerned.<br>
For example, when the agent horseradish peroxidase is present, the addition of<br>
hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is<br>
detectable. An antibody may also be labeled with biotin, and detected through<br>
indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding. An antibody may be labeled<br>
with a magnetic agent, such as gadolinium. An antibody may also be labeled with a<br>
predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine<br>
zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains,<br><br>
56<br>
epitope tags). In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various<br>
lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.<br>
An anti-IGF-IR antibody may also be labeled with a radiolabeled<br>
amino acid. The radiolabel may be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.<br>
For instance, the radiolabel may be used to detect IGF-ER-expressing tumors by x-ray<br>
or other diagnostic techniques. Further, the radiolabel may be used therapeutically as<br>
a toxin for cancerous cells or tumors. Examples of labels for polypeptides include,<br>
but are not limited to, the following radioisotopes or radionuclides — 3H, I4C, 15N, 35S,<br>
90Y.99Tc,IIIIn,125I,131I.<br>
An anti-IGF-IR antibody may also be derivatized with a chemical<br>
group such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), a methyl or ethyl group, or a carbohydrate<br>
group. These groups may be useful to improve the biological characteristics of the<br>
antibody, e.g., to increase serum half-life or to increase tissue binding.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions and Kits<br>
The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition for the<br>
treatment of a hyperproliferative disorder in a mammal which comprises a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, said pharmaceutical<br>
composition is for the treatment of cancer such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder,<br>
gastric, pancreatic, breast, head, neck, renal, kidney, ovarian, prostate, colorectal,<br>
esophageal, gynecological or thyroid cancer. In another embodiment, said<br>
pharmaceutical composition relates to non-cancerous hyperproliferative disorders<br>
such as, without limitation, restenosis after angioplasty and psoriasis. In another<br>
embodiment, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of<br>
a mammal that requires activation of IGF-IR, wherein the pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of an activating antibody of<br>
the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising activating antibodies may be used to treat animals that lack sufficient IGF-<br>
I or IGF-II, or may be used to treat osteoporosis, frailty or disorders in which the<br>
mammal secretes too little active growth hormone or is unable to respond to growth<br>
hormone.<br>
The anti-IGF-IR antibodies of the invention can be incorporated into<br>
pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically, the<br><br>
57<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprises an antibody of the invention and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are<br>
physiologically compatible. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include<br>
one or more of water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol<br>
and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In many cases, it will be preferable to<br>
include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol,<br>
or sodium chloride in the composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances such<br>
as wetting or minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying<br>
agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the<br>
antibody or antibody portion.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms. These<br>
include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid<br>
solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets,<br>
pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The preferred form depends on the<br>
intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical preferred<br>
compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions<br>
similar to those used for passive immunization of humans with other antibodies. The<br>
preferred mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous,<br>
intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is<br>
administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the antibody is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.<br>
Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a<br>
solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to<br>
high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating<br>
the anti-IGF-IR antibody in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or<br>
a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered<br>
sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active<br>
compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the<br>
required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile<br>
powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of<br><br>
58<br>
preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying that yields a powder of the active<br>
ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered<br>
solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by<br>
the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size<br>
in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of<br>
injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an<br>
agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention can be administered by a<br>
variety of methods known in the art, although for many therapeutic applications, the<br>
preferred route/mode of administration is intraperitoneal, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous or infusion. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan,<br>
the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibodies of the present inventon can be administered as a<br>
single dose or may be administered as multiple doses.<br>
In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a<br>
carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled<br>
release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated<br>
delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters,<br>
and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are<br>
patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and<br>
Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc.,<br>
New York, 1978.<br>
In certain embodiments, the anti-IGF-IR of the invention may be orally<br>
administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The<br>
compound (and other ingredients, if desired) may also be enclosed in a hard or soft<br>
shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the<br>
subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compounds may be incorporated<br>
with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches,<br>
capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. To administer a compound<br>
of the invention by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat<br>
the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its<br>
inactivation.<br><br>
59<br>
Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the<br>
compositions. In certain embodiments, an anti-IGF-IR of the invention is<br>
coformulated with and/or coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic<br>
agents, such as a chemotherapeutic agent, an antineoplastic agent or an anti-tumor<br>
agent. For example, an anti-IGF-IR antibody may be coformulated and/or<br>
coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents. These agents include,<br>
without limitation, antibodies that bind other targets (e.g., antibodies that bind one or<br>
more growth factors or cytokines, their cell surface receptors or IGF-1), IGF-I binding<br>
proteins, antineoplastic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, anti-tumor agents, antisense<br>
oligonucleotides against IGF-IR or IGF-I, peptide analogues that block IGF-IR<br>
activation, soluble IGF-IR, and/or one or more chemical agents that inhibit IGF-I<br>
production or activity, which are known in the art, e.g., octreotide. For a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising an activating antibody, the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody may be formulated with a factor that increases cell proliferation or prevents<br>
apoptosis. Such factors include growth factors such as IGF-I, and/or analogues of<br>
IGF-I that activate IGF-IR. Such combination therapies may require lower dosages of<br>
the anti-IGF-IR antibody as well as the co-administered agents, thus avoiding possible<br>
toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. In one<br>
embodiment, the antibody and one or more additional therapeutic agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may include a<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" or a "prophylactically effective amount" of an<br>
antibody or antibody portion of the invention. A "therapeutically effective amount"<br>
refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve<br>
the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or<br>
antibody portion may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and<br>
weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody or antibody portion to elicit a<br>
desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in<br>
which any toxic cr detrimental effects of the antibody or antibody portion are<br>
outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically effective<br>
amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to<br>
achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in<br>
subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount<br>
will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.<br><br>
60<br>
Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired<br>
response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus<br>
may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the<br>
dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the<br>
therapeutic situation. Pharmaceutical composition comprising the antibody or<br>
comprising a combination therapy comprising the antibody and one or more<br>
additional therapeutic agents may be formulated for single or multiple doses. It is<br>
especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for<br>
ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein<br>
refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian<br>
subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active<br>
compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the<br>
required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the<br>
invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of<br>
the active compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be<br>
achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active<br>
compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. A particularly useful<br>
formulation is 5 mg/ml anti-IGF-IR antibody in a buffer of 20mM sodium citrate, pH<br>
5.5, 140mM NaCl, and 0.2mg/ml polysorbate 80.<br>
An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or<br>
prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antibody portion of the invention<br>
is 0.1-100 mg/kg, more preferably 0.5-50 mg/kg, more preferably 1-20 mg/kg, and<br>
even more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with<br>
the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood<br>
that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time<br>
according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person<br>
administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage<br>
ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or<br>
practice of the claimed composition. In one embodiment, the therapeutically or<br>
prophylactically effective amount of an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof is<br>
administered along with one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to administration of an anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibody for the treatment of cancer in a dose of less than 300 mg per month.<br><br>
61<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides kits comprising the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibodies and the pharmaceutical compositions comprising these<br>
antibodies. A kit may include, in addition to the antibody or pharmaceutical<br>
composition, diagnostic or therapeutic agents. A kit may also include instructions for<br>
use in a diagnostic or therapeutic method. In a preferred embodiment, the kit includes<br>
the antibody or a pharmaceutical composition thereof and a diagnostic agent that can<br>
be used in a method described below. In another preferred embodiment, the kit<br>
includes the antibody or a pharmaceutical composition thereof and one or more<br>
therapeutic agents, such as an additional antineoplastic agent, anti-tumor agent or<br>
chemotherapeutic agent, that can be used in a method described below.<br>
This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions for<br>
inhibiting abnormal cell growth in a mammal which comprise an amount of a<br>
compound of the invention in combination with an amount of a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, wherein the amounts of the compound, salt, solvate, or prodrug, and of the<br>
chemotherapeutic agent are together effective in inhibiting abnormal cell growth.<br>
Many chemotherapeutic agents are presently known in the art. In one embodiment,<br>
the chemotherapeutic agents is selected from the group consisting of mitotic<br>
inhibitors, alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, intercalating antibiotics, growth factor<br>
inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, enzymes, topoisomerase inhibitors, anti-survival<br>
agents, biological response modifiers, anti-hormones, e.g. anti-androgens, and anti-<br>
angiogenesis agents.<br>
Anti-angiogenesis agents, such as MMP-2 (matrix-metalloproteinase<br>
2) inhibitors, MMP-9 (matrix-metalloproteinase 9) inhibitors, and COX-II<br>
(cyclooxygenase II) inhibitors, can be used in conjunction with a compound of the<br>
invention. Examples of useful COX-II inhibitors include CELEBREX™ (alecoxib),<br>

Anti-survival agents include anti-IGF-ER antibodies and anti-integrin<br>
agents, such as anti-integrin antibodies.<br><br>
65<br>
Diagnostic Methods of Use<br>
The anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be used to detect IGF-IR in a<br>
biological sample in vitro or in vivo. The anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be used in a<br>
conventional immunoassay, including, without limitation, an ELISA, an RIA, FACS,<br>
tissue immunohistochemistry, Western blot or immunoprecipitation. The anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies of the invention may be used to detect IGF-IR from humans. In another<br>
embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be used to detect IGF-IR from Old<br>
World primates such as cynomologous and rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees and apes.<br>
The invention provides a method for detecting anti-IGF-IR in a biological sample<br>
comprising contacting a biological sample with an anti-IGF-IR antibody of the<br>
invention and detecting the bound antibody bound to anti-IGF-IR, to detect the IGF-<br>
IR in the biological sample. In one embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is directly<br>
labeled with a detectable label. In another embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody (the<br>
first antibody) is unlabeled and a second antibody or other molecule that can bind the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody is labeled. As is well known to one of skill in the art, a second<br>
antibody is chosen that is able to specifically bind the specific species and class of the<br>
first antibody. For example, if the anti-IGF-ER antibody is a human IgG, then the<br>
secondary antibody may be an anti-human-IgG. Other molecules that can bind to<br>
antibodies include, without limitation, Protein A and Protein G, both of which are<br>
available commercially, e.g., from Pierce Chemical Co.<br>
Suitable labels for the antibody or secondary have been disclosed<br>
supra, and include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials,<br>
luminescent materials, magnetic agents and radioactive materials. Examples of<br>
suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase,<br>
P-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group<br>
complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable<br>
fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate,<br>
rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an<br>
example of a luminescent material includes luminol; an example of a magnetic agent<br>
includes gadolinium; and examples of suitable radioactive material includel25l, I31I,<br>
35Sor3H.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, IGF-ER can be assayed in a biological<br>
sample by a competition immunoassay utilizing IGF-IR standards labeled with a<br><br>
66<br>
detectable substance and an unlabeled anti-IGF-IR antibody. In this assay, the<br>
biological sample, the labeled IGF-IR standards and the anti-IGF-IR antibody are<br>
combined and the amount of labeled IGF-IR standard bound to the unlabeled antibody<br>
is determined. The amount of IGF-IR in the biological sample is inversely<br>
proportional to the amount of labeled IGF-IR standard bound to the anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody.<br>
One may use the immunoassays disclosed above for a number of<br>
purposes. In one embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be used to detect IGF-<br>
IR in cells in cell culture. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibodies may<br>
be used to determine the level of tyrosine phosphorylation, tyrosine<br>
autophosphorylation of IGF-IR, and/or the amount of IGF-IR on the cell surface after<br>
treatment of the cells with various compounds. This method can be used to test<br>
compounds that may be used to activate or inhibit IGF-IR. In this method, one<br>
sample of cells is treated with a test compound for a period of time while another<br>
sample is left untreated. If tyrosine autophosphorylation is to be measured, the cells<br>
are lysed and tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR is measured using an<br>
immunoassay described above or as described in Example III, which uses an ELISA.<br>
If the total level of IGF-IR is to be measured, the cells are lysed and the total IGF-IR<br>
level is measured using one of the immunoassays described above.<br>
A preferred immunoassay for determining IGF-IR tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation or for measuring total IGF-IR levels is an ELISA or Western blot. If<br>
only the cell surface level of IGF-IR is to be measured, the cells are not lysed, and the<br>
cell surface levels of IGF-IR are measured using one of the immunoassays described<br>
above. A preferred immunoassay for determining cell surface levels of IGF-IR<br>
includes the steps of labeling the cell surface proteins with a detectable label, such as<br>
biotin or 125I, immunoprecipitating the IGF-IR with an anti-IGF-IR antibody and then<br>
detecting the labeled IGF-IR. Another preferred immunoassay for determining the<br>
localization of IGF-IR, e.g., cell surface levels, is by using immunobistochemistry.<br>
Methods such as ELISA, RIA, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, cell surface<br>
labeling of integral membrane proteins and immunoprecipitation are well known in<br>
the art. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, supra. In addition, the immunoassays may be<br>
scaled up for high throughput screening in order to test a large number of compounds<br>
for either activation or inhibition of IGF-IR.<br><br>
67<br>
The anti-IGF-IR antibodies of the invention may also be used to<br>
determine the levels of IGF-IR in a tissue or in cells derived from the tissue. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the tissue is a diseased tissue. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the tissue is a tumor or a biopsy thereof. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
the method, a tissue or a biopsy thereof is excised from a patient. The tissue or biopsy<br>
is then used in an immunoassay to determine, e.g., IGF-IR levels, cell surface levels<br>
of IGF-IR, levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR, or localization of IGF-IR by<br>
the methods discussed above. The method can be used to determine if a tumor<br>
expresses IGF-IR at a high level.<br>
The above-described diagnostic method can be used to determine<br>
whether a tumor expresses high levels of IGF-IR, which may be indicative that the<br>
tumor will respond well to treatment with anti-IGF-IR antibody. The diagnostic<br>
method may also be used to determine whether a tumor is potentially cancerous, if it<br>
expresses high levels of IGF-IR, or benign, if it expresses low levels of IGF-IR.<br>
Further, the diagnostic method may also be used to determine whether treatment with<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody (see below) is causing a tumor to express lower levels of IGF-<br>
IR and/or to express lower levels of tyrosine autophosphorylation, and thus can be<br>
used to determine whether the treatment is successful. In general, a method to<br>
determine whether an anti-IGF-IR antibody decreases tyrosine phosphorylation<br>
comprises the steps of measuring the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in a cell or<br>
tissue of interest, incubating the cell or tissue with an anti-IGF-IR antibody or<br>
antigen-binding portion thereof, then re-measuring the level of tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation in the cell or tissue. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IR or of<br>
another protein(s) may be measured.   The diagnostic method may also be used to<br>
determine whether a tissue or cell is not expressing high enough levels of IGF-IR or<br>
high enough levels of activated IGF-IR, which may be the case for individuals with<br>
dwarfism, osteoporosis or diabetes. A diagnosis that levels of IGF-IR or active IGF-<br>
IR are too low could be used for treatment with activating anti-IGF-IR antibodies,<br>
IGF-I or other therapeutic agents for increasing IGF-IR levels or activity.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention may also be used in vivo to<br>
localize tissues and organs that express IGF-IR. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibodies can be used localize IGF-IR-expressing tumors. The advantage of<br>
the anti-IGF-IR antibodies of the present invention is that they will not generate an<br><br>
68<br>
immune response upon administration. The method comprises the steps of<br>
administering an anti-IGF-IR antibody or a pharmaceutical composition thereof to a<br>
patient in need of such a diagnostic test and subjecting the patient to imaging analysis<br>
determine the location of the IGF-IR-expressing tissues. Imaging analysis is well<br>
known in the medical art, and includes, without limitation, x-ray analysis, magnetic<br>
resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CE). In another embodiment of<br>
the method, a biopsy is obtained from the patient to determine whether the tissue of<br>
interest expresses IGF-IR rather than subjecting the patient to imaging analysis. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibodies may be labeled with a detectable<br>
agent that can be imaged in a patient. For example, the antibody may be labeled with<br>
a contrast agent, such as barium, which can be used for x-ray analysis, or a magnetic<br>
contrast agent, such as a gadolinium chelate, which can be used for MRI or CE.<br>
Other labeling agents include, without limitation, radioisotopes, such as 99Tc. In<br>
another embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody will be unlabeled and will be imaged<br>
by administering a second antibody or other molecule that is detectable and that can<br>
bind the anti-IGF-IR antibody.<br>
Therapeutic Methods of Use<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for inhibiting<br>
IGF-IR activity by administering an anti-IGF-IR antibody to a patient in need thereof.<br>
Any of the types of antibodies described herein may be used therapeutically. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is a human, chimeric or humanized<br>
antibody. In another preferred embodiment, the IGF-IR is human and the patient is a<br>
human patient. Alternatively, the patient may be a mammal that expresses an IGF-IR<br>
that the anti-IGF-IR antibody cross-reacts with. The antibody may be administered to<br>
a non-human mammal expressing an IGF-IR with which the antibody cross-reacts<br>
(i.e. a primate, or a cynomologous or rhesus monkey) for veterinary purposes or as an<br>
animal model of human disease. Such animal models may be useful for evaluating<br>
the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of this invention.<br>
As used herein, the term "a disorder in which IGF-IR activity is<br>
detrimental" is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence<br>
of high levels of IGF-IR in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be<br>
or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a<br>
factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly, a disorder in<br><br>
69<br>
which high levels of IGF-IR activity is detrimental is a disorder in which inhibition of<br>
IGF-IR activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and/or progression of the<br>
disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced, for example, by an increase in the levels<br>
of IGF-ER on the cell surface or in increased tyrosine autophosphorylation of IGF-IR<br>
in the affected cells or tissues of a subject suffering from the disorder. The increase in<br>
IGF-IR levels may be detected, for example, using an anti-IGF-IR antibody as<br>
described above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, an anti-IGF-IR antibody may be<br>
administered to a patient who has an IGF-IR-expressing tumor. A tumor may be a<br>
solid tumor or may be a non-solid tumor, such as a lymphoma. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, an anti-IGF-IR antibody may be administered to a patient who has an<br>
IGF-IR-expressing tumor that is cancerous. In an even more preferred embodiment,<br>
the anti-IGF-IR antibody is administered to a patient who has a tumor of the lung,<br>
breast, prostate or colon. In a highly preferred embodiment, the method causes the<br>
tumor not to increase in weight or volume or to decrease in weight or volume. In<br>
another embodiment, the method causes the IGF-IR on the tumor to be internalized.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected from 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,<br>
4.9.2, or 6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light chain or antigen-binding region<br>
thereof.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, an anti-IGF-IR antibody may be<br>
administered to a patient who expresses inappropriately high levels of IGF-1. It is<br>
known in the art that high-level expression of IGF-I can lead to a variety of common<br>
cancers. In a more preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is administered to<br>
a patient with prostate cancer, glioma or fibrosarcoma. In an even more preferred<br>
embodiment, the method causes the cancer to stop proliferating abnormally, or not to<br>
increase in weight or volume or to decrease in weight or volume.<br>
In one embodiment, said method relates to the treatment of cancer such<br>
as brain, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, pancreatic, breast, head, neck, esophageal,<br>
prostate, colorectal, lung, renal, kidney, ovarian, gynecological or thyroid cancer.<br>
Patients that can be treated with a compounds of the invention according to the<br>
methods of this invention include, for example, patients that have been diagnosed as<br>
having lung cancer, bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head<br>
and neck, cutaneous or intraocular melanoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, rectal<br><br>
70<br>
cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer,<br>
gynecologic tumors (e.g., uterine sarcomas, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes,<br>
carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina or<br>
carcinoma of the vulva), Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the<br>
small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system (e.g., cancer of the thyroid,<br>
parathyroid or adrenal glands), sarcomas of soft tissues, cancer of the urethra, cancer<br>
of the penis, prostate cancer, chronic or acute leukemia, solid tumors of childhood,<br>
lymphocytic lymphomas, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter (e.g.,<br>
renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the renal pelvis), or neoplasms of the central<br>
nervous system (e.g., primary CNS lymphoma, spinal axis tumors, brain stem gliomas<br>
or pituitary adenomas).<br>
The antibody may be administered once, but more preferably is<br>
administered multiple times. The antibody may be administered from three times<br>
daily to once every six months. The administering may be on a schedule such as three<br>
times daily, twice daily, once daily, once every two days, once every three days, once<br>
weekly, once every two weeks, once every month, once every two months, once every<br>
three months and once every six months. The antibody may be administered via an<br>
oral, mucosal, buccal, intranasal, inhalable, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
parenteral, intratumor or topical route. The antibody may be administered at a site<br>
distant from the site of the tumor. The antibody may also be administered<br>
continuously via a minipump. The antibody may be administered once, at least twice<br>
or for at least the period of time until the condition is treated, palliated or cured. The<br>
antibody generally will be administered for as long as the tumor is present provided<br>
that the antibody causes the tumor or cancer to stop growing or to decrease in weight<br>
or volume. The antibody will generally be administered as part of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition as described supra. The dosage of antibody will generally be in the<br>
range of 0.1-100 mg/kg, more preferably 0.5-50 mg/kg, more preferably 1-20 mg/kg,<br>
and even more preferably 1-10 mg/kg. The serum concentration of the antibody may<br>
be measured by any method known in the art. See, e.g., Example XVII below. The<br>
antibody may also be administered prophylactically in order to prevent a cancer or<br>
tumor from occurring. This may be especially useful in patients that have a "high<br>
normal" level of IGF-1 because these patients have been shown to have a higher risk<br>
of developing common cancers. See Rosen et al., supra.<br><br>
71<br>
In another aspect, the anti-IGF-IR antibody may be co-administered<br>
with other therapeutic agents, such as antineoplastic drugs or molecules, to a patient<br>
who has a hyperproliferative disorder, such as cancer or a tumor. In one aspect, the<br>
invention relates to a method for the treatment of the hyperproliferative disorder in a<br>
mammal comprising administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of a compound of the invention in combination with an anti-tumor agent selected<br>
from the group consisting of, but not limited to, mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents,<br>
anti-metabolites, intercalating agents, growth factor inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors,<br>
enzymes, topoisomerase inhibitors, biological response modifiers, anti-hormones,<br>
kinase inhibitors, matrix metalloprotease inhibitors, genetic therapeutics and anti-<br>
androgens. In a more preferred embodiment, the antibody may be administered with<br>
an antineoplastic agent, such as adriamycin or taxol. In another preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody or combination therapy is administered along with<br>
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, surgery or other immunotherapy.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the antibody will be administered with another<br>
antibody. For example, the anti-IGF-IR antibody may be administered with an<br>
antibody or other agent that is known to inhibit tumor or cancer cell proliferation, e.g.,<br>
an antibody or agent that inhibits erbB2 receptor, EGF-R, CD20 or VEGF.<br>
Co-administration of the antibody with an additional therapeutic agent<br>
(combination therapy) encompasses administering a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising the anti-IGF-IR antibody and the additional therapeutic agent and<br>
administering two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, one comprising the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody and the other(s) comprising the additional therapeutic agent(s).<br>
Further, although co-administration or combination therapy generally means that the<br>
antibody and additional therapeutic agents are administered at the same time as one<br>
another, it also encompasses instances in which the antibody and additional<br>
therapeutic agents are administered at different times. For instance, the antibody may<br>
be administered once every three days, while the additional therapeutic agent is<br>
administered once daily. Alternatively, the antibody may be administered prior to or<br>
subsequent to treatment of the disorder with the additional therapeutic agent.<br>
Similarly, administration of the anti-IGF-IR antibody may be administered prior to or<br>
subsequent to other therapy, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, photodynamic<br>
therapy, surgery or other immunotherapy<br><br>
72<br>
The antibody and one or more additional therapeutic agents (the<br>
combination therapy) may be administered once, twice or at least the period of time<br>
until the condition is treated, palliated or cured. Preferably, the combination therapy<br>
is administered multiple times. The combination therapy may be administered from<br>
three times daily to once every six months. The administering may be on a schedule<br>
such as three times daily, twice daily, once daily, once every two days, once every<br>
three days, once weekly, once every two weeks, once every month, once every two<br>
months, once every three months and once every six months, or may be administered<br>
continuously via a minipump. The combination therapy may be administered via an<br>
oral, mucosal, buccal, intranasal, inhalable, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
parenteral, intratumor or topical route. The combination therapy may be administered<br>
at a site distant from the site of the tumor. The combination therapy generally will be<br>
administered for as long as the tumor is present provided that the antibody causes the<br>
tumor or cancer to stop growing or to decrease in weight or volume.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody is labeled with<br>
a radiolabel, an immunotoxin or a toxin, or is a fusion protein comprising a toxic<br>
peptide. The anti-IGF-IR antibody or anti-IGF-IR antibody fusion protein directs the<br>
radiolabel, immunotoxin, toxin or toxic peptide to the IGF-IR-expressing tumor or<br>
cancer cell. In a preferred embodiment, the radiolabel, immunotoxin, toxin or toxic<br>
peptide is internalized after the anti-IGF-IR antibody binds to the IGF-IR on the<br>
surface of the tumor or cancer cell.<br>
In another aspect, the anti-IGF-IR antibody may be used<br>
therapeutically to induce apoptosis of specific cells in a patient in need thereof. In<br>
many cases, the cells targeted for apoptosis are cancerous or tumor cells. Thus, in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method of inducing apoptosis by<br>
administering a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-IGF-IR antibody to a<br>
patient in need thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected from<br>
2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2, or 6.1.1, or comprises a heavy chain, light chain or<br>
antigen-binding region thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the anti-IGF-IR antibody may be used to treat<br>
noncancerous states in which high levels of IGF-1 and/or IGF-IR have been associated<br>
with the noncancerous state or disease. In one embodiment, the method comprises the<br>
step of administering an anti-IGF-ER antibody to a patient who has a noncancerous<br><br>
73<br>
pathological state caused or exacerbated by high levels of IGF-I and/or IGF-ER levels<br>
or activity. In a preferred embodiment, the noncancerous pathological state is<br>
acromegaly, gigantism, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, smooth muscle restenosis of blood<br>
vessels or inappropriate microvascular proliferation, such as that found as a<br>
complication of diabetes, especially of the eye. In a more preferred embodiment, the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody slows the progress of the noncancerous pathological state. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment, the anti-IGF-IR antibody stops or reverses, at least in<br>
part, the noncancerous pathological state.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of administering an<br>
activating anti-IGF-IR antibody to a patient in need thereof. In one embodiment, the<br>
activating antibody or pharmaceutical composition is administered to a patient in need<br>
thereof in an amount effective to increase IGF-IR activity. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the activating antibody is able to restore normal IGF-IR activity. In<br>
another preferred embodiment, the activating antibody may be administered to a<br>
patient who has small stature, neuropathy, a decrease in muscle mass or osteoporosis.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the activating antibody may be administered with<br>
one or more other factors that increase cell proliferation, prevent apoptosis or increase<br>
IGF-IR activity. Such factors include growth factors such as IGF-I, and/or analogues<br>
of IGF-I that activate IGF-IR. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is selected<br>
from 4.17.3, or comprises a heavy chain, light chain or antigen-binding portion<br>
thereof.<br>
Gene Therapy<br>
The nucleic acid molecules of the instant invention may be<br>
administered to a patient in need thereof via gene therapy. The therapy may be either<br>
in vivo or ex vivo. In a preferred embodiment, nucleic acid molecules encoding both a<br>
heavy chain and a light chain are administered to a patient. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules are administered such that they are stably<br>
integrated into the chromosome of B cells because these cells are specialized for<br>
producing antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, precursor B cells are transfected or<br>
infected ex vivo and re-transplanted into a patient in need thereof. In another<br>
embodiment, precursor B cells or other cells are infected in vivo using a virus known<br>
to infect the cell type of interest. Typical vectors used for gene therapy include<br>
liposomes, plasmids, or viral vectors, such as retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-<br><br>
74<br>
associated viruses. After infection either in vivo or ex vivo, levels of antibody<br>
expression may be monitored by taking a sample from the treated patient and using<br>
any immunoassay known in the art and discussed herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the gene therapy method comprises the<br>
steps of administering an effective amount of an isolated nucleic acid molecule<br>
encoding the heavy chain or the antigen-binding portion thereof of the human<br>
antibody or portion thereof and expressing the nucleic acid molecule. In another<br>
embodiment, the gene therapy method comprises the steps of administering an<br>
effective amount of an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding the light chain or the<br>
antigen-binding portion thereof of the human antibody or portion thereof and<br>
expressing the nucleic acid molecule. In a more preferred method, the gene therapy<br>
method comprises the steps of administering an effective amount of an isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding the heavy chain or the antigen-binding portion thereof<br>
of the human antibody or portion thereof and an effective amount of an isolated<br>
nucleic acid molecule encoding the light chain or the antigen-binding portion thereof<br>
of the human antibody or portion thereof and expressing the nucleic acid molecules.<br>
The gene therapy method may also comprise the step of administering another anti-<br>
cancer agent, such as taxol, tamoxifen, 5-FU, adriamycin or CP-358,774.<br>
In order that this invention may be better understood, the following<br>
examples are set forth. These examples are for purposes of illustration only and are<br>
not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE I: Generation of Hvbridomas Producing Anti-IGF-IR Antibody<br>
Antibodies of the invention were prepared, selected, and assayed as<br>
follows:<br>
Immunization and hybridoma generation<br>
Eight to ten week old XENOMICE ™ were immunized<br>
intraperitoneally or in their hind footpads with either the extracellular domain of<br>
human IGF-IR (10 ug/dose/mouse), or with 3T3-IGF-IR or 300.19-IGF-IR cells,<br>
which are two transfected cell lines that express human IGF-IR on their plasma<br>
membranes (10 x 106 cells/dose/mouse). This dose was repeated five to seven times<br>
over a three to eight week period. Four days before fusion, the mice received a final<br>
injection of the extracellular domain of human IGF-IR in PBS. Spleen and lymph<br><br>
75<br>
node lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused with the non-secretory myeloma<br>
P3-X63-Ag8.653 cell line and were subjected to HAT selection as previously<br>
described (Galfre and Milstein, Methods Enzymol. 73:3-46, 1981). A panel of<br>
hybridomas all secreting IGF-ER specific human IgG2k antibodies were recovered.<br>
Seven hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies specific for IGF-IR were<br>
selected for further study and were designated 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1, 4.9.2,<br>
4.17.3 and 6.1.1.<br>
Hybridomas 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3, 3.1.1,4.9.2 and 4.17.3 were<br>
deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University<br>
Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209, on December 12, 2000 with the following<br>
deposit numbers:<br><br>
Hvbndoma	Deposit No.<br>
2.12.1	PTA-2792<br>
2.13.2	PTA-2788<br>
2.14.3	PTA-2790<br>
3.1.1	PTA-2791<br>
4.9.2	PTA-2789<br>
4.17.3	PTA-2793<br>
EXAMPLE II: Determination of Affinity Constants (Kd) of Fully<br>
Human Anti-IGF-IR Monoclonal Antibodies by BIAcore<br>
We performed affinity measures of purified antibodies by surface<br>
plasmon resonance using the BIAcore 3000 instrument, following the manufacturer's<br>
protocols.<br>
Protocol 1<br>
To perform kinetic analyses, protein-A was immobilized on the<br>
sensorchip surfaces of the BIAcore. The sensorchip was then used to capture the anti-<br>
IGF-IR antibodies of the present invention. Different concentrations of the<br>
extracellular domain of IGF-IR were injected on the sensorchip and the binding and<br>
dissociation kinetics of the interactions between the anti-IGF-IR antibodies and the<br>
extracellular domain of IGF-IR were analyzed. The data were evaluated with global<br>
fit Langmuir 1:1, using baseline drift models available on the BIAevaluation software<br>
provided by BIAcore.<br><br>
76<br>
Protocol 2<br>
BIAcore measurements were performed essentially as described by<br>
Fagerstam et al. "Detection of antigen-antibody interactions by surface plasmon<br>
resonance. Applications to epitope mapping." J. Mol. Recog. 3: 208-214. (1990).<br>
Table I lists affinity measurements for representative anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies of the present invention:<br>
Table I<br><br>
The kinetic analyses indicates that the antibodies prepared in<br>
accordance with the invention possess high affinities and strong binding constants for<br>
the extracellular domain of IGF-IR.<br>
EXAMPLE III: Antibody-mediated Inhibition of<br>
IGF-I-induced Phosphorylation of IGF-IR<br>
We performed ELISA experiments in order to determine whether the<br>
antibodies of this invention were able to block IGF-I-mediated activation of IGF-IR.<br>
IGF-I-mediated activation of IGF-IR was detected by increased receptor-associated<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation.<br>
ELISA Plate Preparation<br>
We prepared ELISA capture plates by adding 100 ul blocking buffer<br>
(3% bovine serum albumin [BSA] in Tris-buffered saline [TBS]) to each well of a<br>
ReactiBind Protein G-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) and incubated the plates with<br><br>
77<br>
shaking for 30 minutes at room temperature. We diluted rabbit pan-specific SC-713<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody (Santa Cruz) in blocking buffer to a concentration of 5 ug/ml<br>
and added 100 ul diluted antibody to each well. We incubated the plates with shaking<br>
for 60-90 minutes at room temperature. We then washed the plates five times with<br>
wash buffer (TBS + 0.1% Tween 20) and gently blotted the remaining buffer out onto<br>
paper towels. These plates were not allowed to dry out prior to the addition of lysate.<br>
Preparation of Lysate from IGF-IR-expressing Cells<br>
We placed IGF-IR-transfected NIH-3T3 cells (5xl04/ml) in 100 ul of<br>
growth media (DMEM high glucose media supplemented with L-glutamine (0.29<br>
mg/ml), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and 500 ug/ml each of geneticin, penicillin and<br>
streptomycin) in 96-well U-bottom plates. We incubated the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2<br>
overnight to allow the cells to attach. We decanted the media from the plates and<br>
replaced it with 100 ul fresh growth media per well. For testing, we diluted the<br>
potential anti-IGF-IR antibodies to five times the desired final concentration in<br>
growth media and added 25 JJ.1 per well. All samples were performed in triplicate.<br>
We then incubated the plates at 37°C for one hour. We stimulated the cells with 25<br>
ul/well of 600 ng/ml IGF-1 (prepared in growth media) and incubate the plates at<br>
room temperature for 10 minutes. We then decanted the media by inverting the plates<br>
and blotting gently onto paper towels and lysed the adherent cells by adding 50 ul of<br>
lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2)<br>
1.6 mM NaVO4,1% Triton X-100,1% glycerol supplemented immediately before use<br>
with one EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet [Roche Molecular Sciences] per 50 ml)<br>
and shaking for 5 minutes at room temperature. We added 200 ul dilution buffer (50<br>
mM HEPES, pH 7.4,1.6 mM NaVO4) to each well and mixed by pipetting up and<br>
down. We transferred 100 ul of lysate from each well to each well of the ELISA<br>
capture plate prepared as described above and incubated with gentle shaking for two<br>
hours at room temperature.<br>
ELISA with Anti-tyrosine-phosphate (pTYR) Antibodies<br>
We removed the cell lysate by inverting the plates, washed the plates<br>
five times with wash buffer and blotted on paper towels. We added 100 ul per well<br>
pTYR-specific antibody (HRP-PY54) diluted in blocking buffer to a concentration of<br><br>
78<br>
0.2 μg/ml and incubated the plates with shaking for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>
We then washed these plates five times with wash buffer and blotted on paper towels.<br>
We detected binding of the HRP-PY54 antibody by adding 100 ul per<br>
well of TMB peroxidase substrate solution (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry) and incubating with<br>
shaking as the color developed (approximately 2-10 minutes). We stopped the color<br>
development reaction by adding 100 ul per well of TMB stop solution (Kirkegaard &amp;<br>
Perry). We then shook the plates for 10 seconds at room temperature to mix the<br>
solution and quantitated by measurement at OD45onm-<br>
Table II and Figure 4 show the results of this experiment performed<br>
with several antibodies of the invention. The results of this experiment demonstrate<br>
the ability of the antibodies of this invention to block IGF-I-mediated activation of<br>
IGF-IR as shown by increased receptor-associated tyrosine phosphorylation.<br>
Furthermore, these results can be used to quantify the relative potency of the<br>
antibodies of this invention.<br>

EXAMPLE IV: Antibodv-mediated Blocking of IGF-I/IGF-IR Binding<br>
We performed ELISA experiments to quantitate the ability of the<br>
antibodies of the invention to inhibit IGF-I binding to IGF-IR in a cell-based assay.<br>
We plated IGF-IR-transfected NIH-3T3 cells (5xlO4/ml) in 100 ul of DMEM high<br>
glucose media supplemented with L-glutamine (0.29 mg/ml), 10% heat-inactivated<br>
FBS, and 500 ug/ml each of geneticin, penicillin and streptomycin in 96-well.U-<br>
bottom plates. We then incubated the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 overnight to allow cells<br>
to attach. We then decanted the media from the plates and replaced it with 100 ul<br>
fresh media per well. For testing, we diluted antibodies in assay media (DMEM high<br>
glucose media supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 200 jig/ml<br><br>
79<br>
BSA and 500 ug/ml each of geneticin, penicillin and streptomycin) to the desired final<br>
concentration and added 50 ul per well. All samples were performed in triplicate.<br>
We then incubated the plates at 37°C for ten minutes. We diluted [I25I]-IGF-I to a<br>
concentration of 1 uCi/ml is assay media and added 50 ul per well of the plate. As a<br>
control for background radioactivity, we added cold IGF-I to a final concentration of<br>
100 ng/ml. We incubated the plates for 10 minutes at 37°C, decanted the media by<br>
blotting gently onto paper towels and washed twice with assay media. We then lysed<br>
the cells by adding 50 p.1 0.1 N NaOH, 0.1% SDS and shaking the plates for five<br>
minutes at room temperature. We then transferred the samples to a scintillation plate,<br>
added 150 ul OptiPhase Supermix and read the signal on a Wallac Micro-Beta<br>
counter.<br>
Table III and Figure 3 show the results of this experiment performed<br>
with three representative antibodies of the invention. This experiment demonstrated<br>
that antibodies of the invention specifically inhibit binding of [125I]-IGF-I to cells<br>
overexpressing IGF-IR.<br>

2.12.1	0.45 ug/ml<br>
2.13.2	0.18 ng/ml<br>
4.9.2	0.1 ug/ml<br>
EXAMPLE V: Epitope Mapping Studies<br>
Having demonstrated that the antibodies of the invention recognize<br>
IGF-IR, we performed epitope mapping studies with several antibodies of the<br>
invention. We focused these experiments particularly on the 2.12.1, 2.13.2, 2.14.3,<br>
and 4.9.2 antibodies.<br>
We conducted BIAcore competition studies to determine whether the<br>
antibodies of this invention bind to the same or distinct site on the IGF-IR molecule.<br>
We bound the extracellular domain (ECD) of IGF-IR to a BIAcore sensorchip as<br>
described above in Example II. We bound a first antibody of the invention to this<br>
sensorchip-bound IGF-IR under saturating conditions. We then measured the ability<br>
of subsequent secondary antibodies of the invention to compete with the primary<br><br>
80<br>
antibody for binding to IGF-IR. This technique enabled us to assign the antibodies of<br>
this invention to different binding groups.<br>
We performed this experiment with antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2,2.14.3,<br>
and 4.9.2. We observed that 2.13.2 and 4.9.2 compete for the same site on the<br>
extracellular domain of IGF-IR. The other antibodies, 2.12.1 and 2.14.3, bind to sites<br>
on IGF-IR that are different from both each other and from the site bound by 2.13.2<br>
and 4.9.2.<br>
EXAMPLE VI: Species Crossreactivitv of the Antibodies of the Invention<br>
In order to determine the species crossreactivity of the antibodies of<br>
the invention, we performed several experiments including immunoprecipitation,<br>
antibody-mediating blocking of IGF-I-induced receptor phosphorylation and FACS<br>
analysis.<br>
To perform immunoprecipitation experiments, we plated cells in<br>
DMEM high glucose media supplemented with L-glutamine (0.29 mg/ml), 10% heat-<br>
inactivated FBS, and 500 ug/ml each of geneticin, penicillin and streptomycin to 50%<br>
confluence in T25 flasks. We then added 100 uJ of an antibody of the invention in<br>
Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS; Gibco BRL) at a concentration of 1 ug/ml.<br>
We incubated the plates for 30 minutes at 37°C in an incubator and then stimulated<br>
the cells with IGF-I at 100 ng/ml for 10 minutes at room temperature. We lysed the<br>
cells in RJPA buffer (Harlow and Lane, supra) and immunoprecipitated IGF-IR with<br>
2 ng of pan-specific SC-713 anti-IGF-ER antibody (Santa Cruz) plus protein A<br>
agarose beads for 1 hour at 4°C. We pelleted the beads and wash three times with<br>
PBS/T (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20) and then boiled the beads in 40 ul Laemmli buffer<br>
containing 5% pME.<br>
The samples prepared as described above were then analyzed by<br>
Western blot. We loaded 12 ul of each sample per lane on 4-10% gradient Novex™<br>
gels run with IX MES buffer (Novex™). Gels were run at 150V for 1 hour or at 200V<br>
for approximately 30 minutes. We thei. transferred the gel to a membrane in Novex™<br>
transfer buffer with 10% methanol either overnight at 100mA or for 1-1.5 hours at<br>
250mA. We then allowed the membrane to dry completely and blocked at room<br>
temperature with TBS (Tris-buffered saline pH 8.0) containing Superblock (Pierce<br>
Chemical Co.). We added the IGF-IR blotting antibody SC713 (Santa Cruz) to detect<br>
immunoprecipitated IGF-IR.<br><br>
81<br>
This experiment was performed with antibodies of the invention,<br>
particularly 2.12.1,2.13.2,4.17.3 and 4.9.2, on cells from a variety of animals. We<br>
found that antibodies 2.12.1, 2.13.2 and 4.9.2 were able to bind human, but not<br>
canine, guinea pig, rabbit or IGF-IR. Further, these antibodies were able to bind<br>
COS7 and Rhesus IGF-IR, both derived from old world monkeys, but not IGF-IR<br>
from the marmoset, which is a new world monkey. These experiments indicate that<br>
the antibodies are highly specific.<br>
Antibody-mediated Blocking of<br>
JGF-I/IGF-IR Binding in Non-human Primates<br>
Following our observation that the antibodies of the invention<br>
recognize IGF-IR from old world monkeys, we also tested their ability to block IGF-<br>
I/IGF-IR binding in cells derived from these old world monkeys. We plated cells in<br>
DMEM high glucose media supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated<br>
FBS, and 500 ug/ml each of geneticin, penicillin and streptomycin to 50% confluence<br>
in T25 flasks. We then added an antibody of the invention, or media without antibody<br>
as a control, and stimulated the cells with IGF-I at 100 ng/ml for 10 minutes at room<br>
temperature. After stimulation, we lysed the cells and immunoprecipitated IGF-IR<br>
with pan-specific IGF-IR antibody SC713 as described above. We then performed<br>
Western blot analysis as described above using HRP-PY54 antibody to detect<br>
phosphorylated tyrosine in the activated IGF-IR.<br>
We observed that antibodies of this invention, in particular 2.13.2 and<br>
4.9.2 could block IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR in both COS7 and Rhesus<br>
cells. The IC50 for the observed inhibition was 0.02 ug/ml and 0.005 ug/ml for COS7<br>
and Rhesus IGF-IR, respectively.<br>
Determination of Cross-species Affinity<br>
of Antibodies of the Invention<br>
We performed FACS analysis to determine the affinity of the<br>
antibodies of the invention for IGF-IR from other animals, particularly the old world<br>
monkeys described above. We incubated aliquots of human and monkey cells (5xl05)<br>
for 1 hour on ice with increasing concentrations of biotinylated anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibodies of the invention or with a biotinylated anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin<br>
(KLH) antibody (Abgenix) as a negative control. We then incubated the samples for<br>
30 minutes on ice with steptavidin-conjugated RPE (phycoerythrin). We measured<br><br>
82<br>
binding by flow cytometry and analyzed the histograms of fluorescence intensity<br>
(FI2-H) versus cell number (Counts) using CellQuest software. We calculated<br>
binding (Kd) for each antibody from graphs of mean fluorescence intensity versus<br>
antibody concentration. In most experiments, we measured binding in cultured<br>
human MCF-7 cells and either rhesus or cynomologous tissue culture cells. We<br>
controlled for depletion of the antibody by measuring binding over a range of cell<br>
concentrations.<br>
We performed the aforementioned FACS analysis to test the ability of<br>
antibodies of the invention, particularly 2.13.2 and 4.9.2, to bind human, rhesus and<br>
cynomologous cells. We observed a half maximal binding (Kd of 0.1 ug/ml for all<br>
cell lines tested.<br>
EXAMPLE VII: IGF-I Receptor Downregulation<br>
We performed blocking experiments essentially as described above in<br>
Example IV up to the addition of [l25I]-labeled IGF-I. At this point, we boiled the<br>
cells in 40 \il Laemmli buffer containing 50% me. We then analyzed the samples by<br>
western blot analysis as described above in Example VI and probed the blots with<br>
both pan-specific IGF-IR antibody SC713 to quantify the levels of IGF-IR and HRP-<br>
PY54 antibody to monitor the levels of phosphorylated tyrosine in the activated IGF-<br>
IR.<br>
As observed previously (Example III), we observed blockage of IGF-I-<br>
induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR following the treatment of cells with an antibody<br>
of this invention (Figure 4). Further, we observed that this blockage of IGF-I-induced<br>
phosphorylation was followed by downregulation of the IGF-IR in these cells. See,<br>
e.g., Fig. 4. IGF-IR levels were maximally reduced 16 hours after stimulation with<br>
IGF-I in the presence of an antibody of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE VIII: Effects of the Antibodies of the Invention on IGF-IR in vivo<br>
We determined whether the effects of the antibodies of the invention<br>
on IGF-IR as described in the previous examples would occur in vivo. We induced<br>
tumors in athymic mice according to published methods (V.A. Pollack et al.,<br>
"Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor-associated tyrosine phosphorylation in<br>
human carcinomas with CP-358,774: Dynamics of receptor inhibition in situ and<br>
antitumor effects in athymic mice," J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 291:739-748 (1999).<br><br>
Briefly, we injected IGF-IR-transfected NIH-3T3 cells (5xlO6) subcutaneously into 3-<br>
4 week-old athymic (nu/nu) mice with 0.2 ml of Matrigel preparation. We then<br>
injected mice with an antibody of the invention intraperitoneally after established (i.e.<br>
approximately 400 mm3) tumors formed.<br>
After 24 hours, we extracted the tumors, homogenized them and<br>
determined the level of IGF-IR. To determine IGF-IR levels, we diluted the SC-713<br>
antibody in Blocking buffer to a final concentration of ug/ml and added 100 ul to each<br>
well of a Reacti-Bind Goat anti-rabbit (GAR) coated plate (Pierce). We incubated the<br>
plates at room temperature for 1 hour with shaking and then washed the plates five<br>
times with wash buffer. We then weighed tumor samples that had been prepared as<br>
described above and homogenized them in lysis buffer (1 ml/100 mg). We diluted<br>
12.5 ul of tumor extract with lysis buffer to a final volume of 100 ul and added this to<br>
each well of a 96-well plate. We incubated the plates at room temperature with<br>
shaking for 1-2 hours and then washed the plates five times with Wash buffer. We<br>
then added 100 ul HRP-PY54 or biotinylated anti-IGF-IR antibody in Blocking buffer<br>
to each well and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes. We then<br>
washed the plates five times with wash buffer and developed the plates. We<br>
developed the plates probed with HRP-PY54 by adding 100 ul of the TMB microwell<br>
substrate per well and stopped color development with the addition 100 ul 0.9 M<br>
H2SO4. We then quantitated the signal by shaking for 10 seconds and measuring<br>
OD450nm- The signal was normalized to total protein. We developed plates probed<br>
with anti-IGF-IR antibody by adding 100 ul of streptavidin-HRP diluted in Blocking<br>
buffer to each well, incubating at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes and<br>
then continuing as described for HRP-PY54.<br>
We observed that intraperitoneal injection of an antibody of this<br>
invention, particularly 2.13.2 and 4.9.2, resulted in inhibition of IGF-IR activity as<br>
measured by a decrease of [both IGF-IR phosphotyrosine (phosphorylated IGF-IR)<br>
and] total IGF-IR protein (Figure 6). In addition, we also observed a decrease in IGF-<br>
IR phosphotyrosine (phosphorylated IGF-IR) (Figure 5). Without wishingto be bound<br>
by any theory, the decreased levels of IGF-IR phosphotyrosine may be due to the<br>
decreased levels of IGF-IR protein in vivo after treatment with the antibody or may be<br>
due to a combination of decreased levels of IGF-IR protein and a decrease in tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation on the IGF-IR that is present due to blocking of activation by ligand<br><br>
84<br>
(e.g., IGF-I or IGF-II). Furthermore, this inhibition was responsive to the dose of<br>
antibody injected (Figure 6). These data demonstrate that the antibodies of the<br>
invention are able to target the IGF-IR in vivo in a manner analogous to what we<br>
observed in vitro.<br>
EXAMPLE IX: Growth Inhibition (TGD of 3T3/IGF-IR Cell Tumors<br>
We tested whether anti-IGF-IR antibodies of the invention would<br>
function to inhibit tumor growth. We induced tumors as described above (Example<br>
VIII) and when established, palpable tumors formed (i.e. 250 mm3, within 6-9 days),<br>
we treated the mice with a single, 0.20 ml dose of antibody by intraperitoneal<br>
injection. We measured tumor size by Vernier calipers across two diameters every<br>
third day and calculated the volume using the formula (length x [width]2)/2 using<br>
methods established by Geran, et al., "Protocols for screening chemical agents and<br>
natural products against animal tumors and other biological systems," Cancer<br>
Chemother. Rep. 3:1-104.<br>
When we performed this analysis with an antibody of the invention, we<br>
found that a single treatment with antibody 2.13.2 alone inhibited the growth of IGF-<br>
IR-transfected NIH-3T3 cell-induced tumors (Figure 7, left panel). Furthermore, in<br>
combination studies with a single dose of 7.5 mg/kg intravenously-supplied<br>
adriamycin, we observed that administration of a single dose of 2.13.2 enhanced the<br>
effectiveness of adriamycin, a known inhibitor of tumor growth. The combination of<br>
adriamycin with an antibody of the invention, 2.13.2, demonstrated a growth delay of<br>
7 days versus treatment with the antibody or adriamycin alone (Figure 7, right panel).<br>
EXAMPLE X: Relationship of Antibody Levels to IGF-IR Downregulation<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice as described in Example VIII. The<br>
mice were then treated with 125 ug of 2.13.2 by intraperitoneal injuction, as described<br>
in Example VIII. Tumors were extracted and IGF-IR levels were measured by ELISA<br>
as described in Example VIII. Figure 8 shows the serum 2.13.2 antibody levels and<br>
IGF-IR receptor levels over time. The experiment demonstrates that the IGF-IR is<br>
down-regulated by the antibody and that the degree of IGF-IR inhibition is dose<br>
proportional to the serum concentration of the antibody.<br><br>
83<br>
EXAMPLE XI: Growth Inhibition of 3T3/IGF-IR Tumors with Multiple Dosing of<br>
Antibody in Combination with Adriamvcin<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice as described in Example IX. Mice<br>
with established subcutaneous tumors of approximately 250 mm3 were treated on<br>
days 1, 8, 15 and 22 with various amounts of 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) or 7.5 mg/kg<br>
adriamycin (i.v.), either as single agents or in combination, as described in Example<br>
IX. Figure 9 shows the tumor size in relation to the various treatments over time.<br>
The experiment demonstrates that treatment with an anti-IGF-IR antibody given once<br>
every seven days inhibits tumor cell growth and enhances inhibition of tumor cell<br>
growth in combination with adriamycin, a known tumor inhibitor.<br>
EXAMPLE XII: Growth Inhibition of Large Tumors<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice as described in Example EX. Mice<br>
with large established subcutaneous tumors of slightly less than 2000 mm3 were<br>
treated on days 1 and 8 with various amounts of 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) or 7.5 mg/kg<br>
adriamycin (i.v.), either as single agents or in combination, as described in Example<br>
IX. Figure 10 shows the tumor size in relation to the various treatments over time.<br>
Control, antibody alone and adriamycin alone animal groups were terminated at day<br>
5, when the tumor size exceeded 2000 mm3. The experiment demonstrates that<br>
treatment with an anti-IGF-IR antibody in combination with adriamycin is highly<br>
efficacious against large tumors when multiple doses are given.<br>
EXAMPLE XIII: Growth Inhibition of Colorectal Cell Tumors<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice as described in Example IX except<br>
that Colo 205 cells (ATCC CCL 222) were used. Colo 205 cells are human colorectal<br>
adenocarcinoma cells. Mice with established subcutaneous tumors of approximately<br>
250 mm3 were treated with various amounts of 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) or with 100<br>
mg/kg 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FU, i.v.), either as single agents or in combination, as<br>
described in Example IX. Figure 11 shows the tumor size in relation to the various<br>
treatments over time. The experiment demonstrates that treatment with an anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody given once inhibits human colorectal cancer cell growth when provided as a<br>
single agent and enhances the effectiveness of 5-FU, a known tumor inhibitor.<br>
Mice with established Colo 205 tumors were treated on days 1, 8, 15<br>
and 22 with 500 ug 2.13.2 (i.p.), 100 mg/kg 5-FU (i.v.) or a combination thereof.<br><br>
86<br>
Figure 12 shows the tumor size in relation to the various treatments over time. The<br>
experiment demonstrates that treatment with an anti-IGF-IR antibody given once<br>
every seven days inhibits human colorectal cancer cell growth and enhances the<br>
effectiveness of 5-FU.<br>
"EXAMPLE XIV: Growth Inhibition of Breast Cancer Cell Tumors<br>
Nude mice as described in Example VIII were implanted with<br>
biodegradable estrogen pellets (0.72 mg 17-P-estradiol/pellet, 60 day release;<br>
Innovative Research of America). After 48 hours, tumors were induced in nude mice<br>
essentially as described in Example IX except that MCF-7 cells (ATCC HTB-22)<br>
were used. MCF-7 cells are estrogen-dependent human breast carcinoma cells. Mice<br>
with established subcutaneous rumors of approximately 250 mm3 were treated with 50<br>
Mg 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) on days 1,4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 and 22 (q3dx7) or with 6.25<br>
mg/kg taxol (i.p.) on days 1, 2, 3,4, 5 (qldx5), either as single agents or in<br>
combination, essentially as described in Example IX. Figure 13 shows the tumor size<br>
in relation to the various treatments over time. The experiment demonstrates that<br>
treatment with an anti-IGF-IR antibody by itself inhibits human breast cancer cell<br>
growth when administered once every three days and also enhances the effectiveness<br>
of taxol, a known breast cancer inhibitor, when given in combination.<br>
Mice having established tumors from MCF-7 cells as described<br>
immediately above were treated on day 1 with various amounts of 2.13.2 antibody<br>
(i.p.) alone or with 3.75 mg/kg adriamycin (i.v.), essentially as described in Example<br>
IX. Figure 14 shows the tumor size in relation to the various treatments over time.<br>
The experiment demonstrates that a single treatment with an anti-IGF-IR antibody by<br>
itself inhibits human breast cancer cell growth and enhances the effectiveness of<br>
adriamycin, a known tumor inhibitor.<br>
Mice having established tumors from MCF-7 cells as described<br>
immediately above were treated with 250 μg 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) on days 1, 8, 15<br>
and 23 or with a biodegradable tamoxifen pellet (25 mg/pellet, free base, 60 day<br>
release, Innovative Research of America), either as single agents or in combination,<br>
essentially as described in Example IX. The tamoxifen pellet was implanted on day 1<br>
after the tumor was established. Figure 15 shows the tumor size in relation to the<br>
various treatments over time. The experiment demonstrates that treatment with an<br><br>
88<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody administered once every seven days inhibits human breast<br>
cancer growth by itself and enhances the effectiveness of tamoxifen, a known tumor<br>
inhibitor.<br>
EXAMPLE XVI: Growth Inhibition of Epidermoid Carcinoma Cell Tumors<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice essentially as described in Example<br>
IX except that A431 cells (ATCC CRL 1555) were used. A431 cells are human<br>
epidermoid carcinoma cells that overexpress EGFR. Mice with established<br>
subcutaneous tumors of approximately 250 mm3 were treated on days 1, 8,15, 22 and<br>
29 with 500 pg 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) or were treated once daily for 27 days with 10<br>
mg/kg CP-358,774 given orally (p.o.), either as single agents or in combination, as<br>
described in Example DC. CP-358,774 is described in United States Patent 5,747,498<br>
and Moyer et al., Cancer Research 57: 4838-4848 (1997), herein incorporated by<br>
reference. Figure 16 shows the tumor size in relation to the various treatments over<br>
time. The experiment demonstrates that treatment with an anti-IGF-IR antibody<br>
enhances the effectiveness of CP-358,774, a known EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor,<br>
for inhibiting the growth of a human epidermoid carcinoma tumor.<br>
EXAMPLE XVII: Pharmacokinetics of Anti-IGF-IR Antibodies in vivo<br>
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the anti-IGF-IR antibodies,<br>
cynomolgus monkeys were injected intravenously with 3, 30 or 100 mg/kg of 2.13.2<br>
antibody in an acetate buffer. Serum was collected from the monkeys at various time<br>
points and anti-IGF-IR antibody concentrations in the monkeys were determined for a<br>
period of up to ten weeks levels. To quantitate functional serum antibody levels, the<br>
extracellular domain of the human IGF-IR (IGF-I-sR, R&amp;D Systems, Catalog #<br>
391GR) was bound to 96-weIl plates. Monkey serum (diluted between 1:100 and<br>
1:15,000) was added to the assay plates so that each sample would be within the linear<br>
range of the standard curve and incubated under conditions in which any anti-IGF-IR<br>
antibody would bind to IGF-I-sR. After washing the plates, a labeled anti-human IgG<br>
antibody was added to the plates and incubated under conditions in which the anti-<br>
human IgG antibody would bind to the anti-IGF-IR antibody. The plates were then<br>
washed and developed, and a control standard curve and linear regression fits used to<br>
quantitate the amount of anti-IGF-IR antibodies. Figure 17 shows the concentration<br><br>
88<br>
of 2.13.2 in serum over time. The experiment demonstrates that the half-life of the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody is 4.6 to 7.7 days and has a volume distribution of 74-105<br>
mL/kg. Further, the experiment demonstrates that the amounts given are dose-<br>
proportional in the monkey, which indicates that the anti-IGF-IR antibody has<br>
saturated any available IGF-IR binding sites in the body even at the lowest dose of 3<br>
mg/kg.<br>
EXAMPLE XVIII: Combination Therapy of Anti-IGF-IR Antibody and Adriamvcin<br>
Downregulates IGF-IR in vivo<br>
Tumors were induced in nude mice as described in Example IX. Mice<br>
with established subcutaneous tumors of approximately 400 mm3 were treated with a<br>
single injection of 250 [ig 2.13.2 antibody (i.p.) or with 7.5 mg/kg adriamycin (i.v.),<br>
.  either as single agents or in combination, as described in Example EX. 72 hours after<br>
administration of the agents, tumors were extracted as described in Example VIII, and<br>
equal amounts of the tumor extracts were subjected to sodium dodecyl phosphate<br>
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) and western blot analysis using the<br>
anti-IGF-IR antibody SC-713 (Santa Cruz). Figure 18 shows the amounts of IGF-IR<br>
in tumor cells in control animals (first three lanes of each panel), in animals treated<br>
with antibody alone (top panel), in animals treated with adriamycin alone (middle<br>
panel) and in animals treated with antibody and adriamycin (lower panel). Each lane<br>
represents equal amounts of protein from individual tumors from individual mice.<br>
The experiment demonstrates that treatment with adriamycin alone has little effect on<br>
IGF-IR levels and that treatment with antibody alone shows some decrease in IGF-IR<br>
levels. Surprisingly, treatment with adriamycin and antibody together shows a<br>
dramatic decrease in IGF-IR levels, demonstrating that adriamycin and antibody<br>
greatly downregulate IGF-IR levels.<br>
