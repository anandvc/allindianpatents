The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention (and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed)	<br><br>
IELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
"he present invention relates to enzyme-containing aqueous, transparent or ranslucent heavy duty liquid laundry detergents in clear bottles comprising intioxidants. The antioxidants protect enzymes present in the HDL composition rom damage by harmful UV radiation thereby preserving the enzyme activity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
.iquid detergents have traditionally been sold in opaque bottles. However, use )f clear bottles can be aesthetically appealing to consumers as they can see the :onsistency of product, and suspended particles if they are present. However, he use of clear bottles can lead to the undesirable loss of enzyme activity (i.e., jnzymes present in the liquid compositions) by UV light. By UV light is meant ight having wavelength of about 250 to about 460 nanometers (nm). Specifically, UVA generally is in range 320-400 nm, UVB about 290 to 320 nm and UVC below 290 nm, down to about 250 nm.<br>
t has been known in the art that UV absorbers can be added to the bottle naterial during manufacture of clear bottles to protect them from becoming brittle and to protect the ingredients inside the bottle. For instance, in GB 2228940 the use of a dicarboxylate in polyester bottles to protect contents -nainly food - from 320-360 nm is described.<br>
n EU 0461537A2 the use of film formers for blocking UV radiation from massing through glass bottles is described. While use of such ingredients can Dlock the transmission of UV light through clear bottles, UV absorbers for nclusion in bottle material are expensive, and must be added when bottle naterial is hot and molten and there is the risk of burning the operator.<br>
WO 97/26315 (to Colgate) discloses transparent containers with specific chromaticity defined by x and y values. Specific dyes are used in the liquid to Tiatch the container. The reference neither teaches nor suggests transparent iquids with the specific combination of antioxidant and enzyme capsules of the nvention.<br><br>
GB 1,303,810 discloses clear liquid medium and visually distinct components suspended in the medium. Detergent compositions containing antioxidants and enzyme capsule are not disclosed.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,812,042 to Verdier discloses clear packages containing liquids with a viscosity and clarity control system comprising urea, lower aliphatic alcohol and optional hydrotrope.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have surprisingly found that a relatively small amount of antioxidants, when added to a liquid containing enzymes, has the ability to dramatically reduce the loss of activity by UV light. This is unexpected in that the level of additive is small and is dispersed throughout the liquid matrix. The use of antioxidant has the advantage that it can be added at lower temperatures for safety than found with molten bottle materials. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a transparent or translucent heavy duty liquid composition in a clear bottle comprising:<br>
(a)	10 to 85% by wt. of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, cationic, amphoteric, zwitterionic surfactants and mixtures thereof;<br>
(b)	0.001 to 5% by wt. of an enzyme selected from the group consisting of proteases, lipases, cellulases, oxidases, amylases and mixtures thereof; and<br>
(c)	0.001 to 3% by wt. of an antioxidant;<br>
wherein the composition has about 50% light transmittance or greater using a 1 cm cuvette at wavelength of 410-800 nanometers; and<br>
wherein the bottle has a light transmittance of greater than 25% at wavelength of about 410-800 nm.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to enzyme containing transparent/translucent liquid duty liquids in clear bottles comprising antioxidants to protect against loss of enzyme activity (e.g., caused by the light hitting enzyme through the clear bottle).<br>
Antioxidants<br>
Among preferred families of antioxidants which may be used are included the tocopherols, the thiodipropionates, the hydroquinones, the diphenylamines, the hindered phenols and the cresols. These families are not intended to be limiting in any way.<br>
Antioxidants particularly useful for this application include metal chelating agents, ascorbic acid, mono or polyhydric phenols such as tocopherols, butylated hydroxyanisol (BHA), Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), Tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), Propyl gallate (PG), 2,4,5-trihydroxy butylphenone (THBP) and 4-hydroxymethyl-2,6-ditertiarybutylphenol. Especially preferred antioxidants include ascorbic acid, BHA, BHT and mixtures thereof. Although it is not bound by the theory, antioxidants delay oxidation reaction by inhibiting the formation of free radicals in the initiation steps. This would inhibit the chain reaction of radical transfer by acting as hydrogen donors or free radical acceptors.<br>
Other antioxidants which may be used are defined in McCutcheon"s Volume 2,<br>
Functional Materials, North American Edition, published by the Manufacturing<br>
Confectioner Publishing Company (1997).<br>
Antioxidants may be used in an amount of 0.001 to 3%, preferably 0.005 to 2%,<br>
more preferably 0.01 to 1 %.<br>
Detergent Compositions<br>
Detergent Active<br>
The compositions of the invention contains one or more surface active agents<br>
(surfactants) selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, cationic,<br>
ampholytic and zwitterionic surfactants or mixtures thereof.  The preferred<br><br>
surfactant detergents for use in the present invention are mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants although it is to be understood that any surfactant may be used alone or in combination with any other surfactant or surfactants. The surfactant should comprise at least 10% by wt. of the composition, e.g., 11 % to 85%, preferably at least 15% to 70% of the total composition, more preferably 16% to 65%; even more preferably 20% to 65%.<br>
Nonionic Surfactant<br>
Nonionic synthetic organic detergents which can be used with the invention, alone or in combination with other surfactants, are described below.<br>
As is well known, the nonionic detergents are characterized by the presence of an organic hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic or alkyl aromatic hydrophobic compound with ethylene oxide (hydrophilic in nature). Typical suitable nonionic surfactants are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,316,812 and 3,630,929.<br>
Usually, the nonionic detergents are polyalkoxylated lipophiles wherein the desired hydrophile-lipophile balance is obtained from addition of a hydrophilic poly-lower alkoxy group to a lipophilic moiety. A preferred class of nonionic detergent is the alkoxylated alkanols wherein the alkanol is of 9 to 18 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of alkylene oxide (of 2 or 3 carbon atoms) is from 3 to 12. Of such materials it is preferred to employ those wherein the alkanol is a fatty alcohol of 9 to 11 or 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain from 5 to 8 or 5 to 9 alkoxy groups per mole.<br>
Exemplary of such compounds are those wherein the alkanol is of 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain about 7 ethylene oxide groups per mole, e.g. Neodol ™25-7 and Neodol ™23-6.5, which products are made by Shell Chemical Company, Inc. The former is a condensation product of a mixture of higher fatty alcohols averaging about 12 to 15 carbon atoms, with about 7 moles of ethylene oxide and the latter is a corresponding mixture wherein the<br><br>
carbon atoms content of the higher fatty alcohol is 12 to 13 and the number of ethylene oxide groups present averages about 6.5. The higher alcohols are primary alkanols.<br>
Other useful nonionics are represented by the commercially well-known class of nonionics sold under the trademark Plurafac. The Plurafacs are the reaction products of a higher linear alcohol and a mixture of ethylene and propylene oxides, containing a mixed chain of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, terminated by a hydroxyl group. Examples include C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 6 moles ethylene oxide and 3 moles propylene oxide, C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 7 moles propylene oxide and 4 moles ethylene oxide, C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 5 moles propylene oxide and 10 moles ethylene oxide, or mixtures of any of the above.<br>
Another group of liquid nonionics are commercially available from Shell Chemical Company, Inc. under the Dobanol trademark: Dobanol 91-5 is an ethoxylated C9-C11 fatty alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol 23-7 is an ethoxylated C12-C15 fatty alcohol with an average of 7 moles ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol.<br>
In the compositions of this invention, preferred nonionic surfactants include the C12-C15 primary fatty alcohols with relatively narrow contents of ethylene oxide in the range of from about 7 to 9 moles, and the C9 to C11 fatty alcohols ethoxylated with about 5-6 moles ethylene oxide.<br>
Another class of nonionic surfactants which can be used in accordance with this invention are glycoside surfactants. Glycoside surfactants suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include those of the formula:<br>
RO-R"0-y(Z)x<br>
wherein R is a monovalent organic radical containing from 6 to 30 (preferably from 8 to 18) carbon atoms; R" is a divalent hydrocarbon radical containing from<br><br>
about 2 to 4 carbons atoms; 0 is an oxygen atom; y is a number which can have an average value of from 0 to about 12 but which is most preferably zero; Z is a moiety derived from a reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 10 (preferably from 1.5 to 10).<br>
A particularly preferred group of glycoside surfactants for use in the practice of this invention includes those of the formula above in which R is a monovalent organic radical (linear or branched) containing from 6 to 18(especially from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; y is zero; z is glucose or a moiety derived therefrom; x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 4 (preferably from about 1 to 4).<br>
Nonionic surfactants particularly useful for this application include, but are not limited to: alcohol ethoxylates (e.g. Neodol 25-9 from Shell Chemical Co.), alkyl phenol ethoxylates (e.g. Tergitol NP-9 from Union Carbide Corp.), alkylpolyglucosides (e.g. Glucapon™ 600CS from Henkel Corp.), polyoxyethylenated polyoxypropylene glycols (e.g. Pluronic™L-65 from BASF Corp.), sorbitol esters (e.g. Emsorb™ 2515 from Henkel Corp.) , polyoxyethylenated sorbitol esters (e.g. Emsorb™ 6900 from Henkel Corp.), alkanolamides (e.g. Alkamide™ DC212/SE from Rhone-Poulenc Co.), and N-alkypyrrolidones (e.g. Surfadone™LP-100 from ISP Technologies Inc.).<br>
Nonionic surfactant is used in the formulation from about 0% to about 70%, preferably between 5% and 50%, more preferably 10-40% by weight.<br>
Mixtures of two or more of the nonionic surfactants can be used.<br>
Anionic Surfactant Detergents<br>
Anionic surface active agents which may be used in the present invention are those surface active compounds which contain a long chain hydrocarbon hydrophobic group in their molecular structure and a hydrophilic group, i.e.; water solubilizing group such as sulfonate or sulfate group. The anionic surface<br><br>
active agents include the alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) water soluble higher alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and the alkyl polyether sulfates. They may also include fatty acid or fatty acid soaps. The preferred anionic surface active agents are the alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamide salts of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamide salts of higher alkyl sulfonates. Preferred higher alkyl sulfonates are those in which the alkyl groups contain 8 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 14 to 18 carbon atoms. The alkyl group in the alkyl benzene sulfonate preferably contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred alkyl benzene sulfonate is the sodium or potassium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, e.g. sodium linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate. The primary and secondary alkyl sulfonates can be made by reacting long chain alpha-olefins with sulfites or bisulfites, e.g. sodium bisulfite. The alkyl sulfonates can also be made by reacting long chain normal paraffin hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide and oxygen as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,503,280, 2,507,088, 3,372,188 and 3,260,741 to obtain normal or secondary higher alkyl sulfonates suitable for use as surfactant detergents.<br>
The alkyl substituent is preferably linear, i.e. normal alkyl, however, branched chain alkyl sulfonates can be employed, although they are not as good with respect to biodegradability. The alkane, i.e. alkyl, substituent may be terminally sulfonated or may be joined, for example, to the carbon atom of the chain, i.e. may be a secondary sulfonate. It is understood in the art that the substituent may be joined to any carbon on the alkyl chain. The higher alkyl sulfonates can be used as the alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium. The preferred salts are the sodium salts. The preferred alkyl sulfonates are the C10 to C15 primary normal alkyl sodium and potassium sulfonates, with the C10 to C15 primary normal alkyl sulfonate salt being more preferred.<br>
Mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl sulfonates can be used as well as mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl polyether sulfates.<br><br>
The alkali metal alkyl benzene sulfonate can be used in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 10 to 50% and more preferably 10 to 20% by weight.<br>
The alkali metal sulfonate can be used in admixture with the alkylbenzene sulfonate in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 10 to 50% by weight.<br>
Also normal alkyl and branched chain alkyl sulfates (e.g., primary alkyl sulfates) may be used as the anionic component).<br>
The higher alkyl polyether sulfates used in accordance with the present invention can be normal or branched chain alkyl and contain lower alkoxy groups which can contain two or three carbon atoms. The normal higher alkyl polyether sulfates are preferred in that they have a higher degree of biodegradability than the branched chain alkyl and the lower poly alkoxy groups are preferably ethoxy groups.<br>
The preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention are represented by the formula:<br>
R"-0(CH2CH20)p-S03M,<br>
where R" is C8 to C2o alkyl, preferably C10 to C15 and more preferably C12 to C15 P is 2 to 8, preferably 2 to 6, and more preferably 2 to 4; and M is an alkali metal, such as sodium and potassium, or an ammonium cation. The sodium and potassium salts are preferred.<br>
A preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxylated sulfate is the sodium salt of a triethoxy C12 to C15 alcohol sulfate having the formula:<br>
C12-15-0-(CH2CH20)3-S03Na<br>
Examples of suitable alkyl ethoxy sulfates that can be used in accordance with the present invention are C12-15 normal or primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium<br><br>
salt; n-decyl diethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C12 primary alkyl diethoxy sulfate, ammonium salt; C12 primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt: C15 primary alkyl tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt, mixed C14-15 normal primary alkyl mixed tri- and tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; stearyl pentaethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; and mixed C10-18 normal primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, potassium salt.<br>
The normal alkyl ethoxy sulfates are readily biodegradable and are preferred. The alkyl poly-lower alkoxy sulfates can be used in mixtures with each other and/or in mixtures with the above discussed higher alkyl benzene, alkyl sulfonates, or alkyl sulfates.<br>
The alkali metal higher alkyl poly ethoxy sulfate can be used with the alkylbenzene sulfonate and/or with an alkyl sulfonate or sulfonate, in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 10 to 50% and more preferably 10 to 20% by weight of entire composition.<br>
Anionic surfactants particularly useful for this application include, but are not limited to: linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (e.g. Vista™ C-500 from Vista Chemical Co.), alkyl sulfates (e.g. Polystep™ B-5 from Stepan Co.), polyoxyethylenated alkyl sulfates (e.g. Standapol™ ES-3 from Stepan Co.), alpha olefin sulfonates (e.g. Witconate™ AOS from Witco Corp.), alpha sulfo methyl esters (e.g. Alpha-Step™ MC-48 from Stepan Co.) and isethionates (e.g. Jordapon™ CI from PPG Industries Inc.).<br>
Anionic surfactant is used in the formulation from about 0% to about 60%, preferably between 5% and 40%, more preferably 8 to 25% by weight.<br>
Cationic Surfactants<br>
Many cationic surfactants are known in the art, and almost any cationic surfactant having at least one long chain alkyl group of about 10 to 24 carbon atoms is suitable in the present invention. Such compounds are described in "Cationic Surfactants", Jungermann, 1970, incorporated by reference.<br><br>
Specific cationic surfactants which can be used as surfactants in the subject invention are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,718.<br>
As with the nonionic and anionic surfactants, the compositions of the invention may use cationic surfactants alone or in combination with any of the other surfactants known in the art. Of course, the compositions may contain no cationic surfactants at all.<br>
Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
Ampholytic synthetic detergents can be broadly described as derivatives of<br>
aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in<br>
which the aliphatic radical may be a straight chain or a branched and wherein<br>
one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and<br>
at least one contains an anionic water-solubilizing group, e.g. carboxy,<br>
sulfonate, sulfate. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are<br>
sodium	3(dodecylamino)propionate,   sodium   3-(dodecylamino)propane-l-<br>
sulfonate,	sodium	2-(dodecylamino)ethyl     sulfate,     sodium     2-<br>
(dimethylamino)octadecanoate,	disodium	3-(N-<br>
carboxymethyldodecylamino)propane 1-sulfonate, disodium octadecyl-<br>
imminodiacetate, sodium 1-carboxymethyl-2-undecylimidazole, and sodium<br>
N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-sulfato-3-dodecoxypropylamine.	Sodium	3-<br>
(dodecylamino)propane-l-sulfonate is preferred.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. The cationic atom in the quaternary compound can be part of a heterocyclic ring. In all of these compounds there is at least one aliphatic group, straight chain or branched, containing from about 3 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic substituent containing an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate.<br>
Specific examples of zwitterionic surfactants which may be used are set forth in<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,647.<br>
The amount of amphoteric used may vary from 0 to 50% by weight, preferably 1 to 30% by weight.<br>
It should be noted that the compositions of the invention are preferably isotropic (by which is generally understood to be a homogenous phase when viewed macroscopically) and either transparent or translucent.<br>
Total surfactant used must be at least 10%, preferably at least 15%, more<br>
preferably at least 20% by wt.<br>
Builders/Electrolyte<br>
Builders which can be used according to this invention include conventional<br>
alkaline detergency builders, inorganic or organic, which can be used at levels<br>
from about 0% to about 50% by weight of the composition, preferably from 3%<br>
to about 35% by weight.<br>
As used herein, the term electrolyte means any water-soluble salt.<br>
Preferably the composition comprises at least 1.0% by weight, more preferably at least 5.0% by weight, most preferably at least 10.0% by weight of electrolyte. The electrolyte may also be a detergency builder, such as the inorganic builder sodium tripolyphosphate, or it may be a non-functional electrolyte such as sodium sulfate or chloride. Preferably the inorganic builder comprises all or part of the electrolyte.<br>
The composition may comprise at least 1 %, preferably at least 3%, preferably 3% to as much as 50% by weight electrolyte.<br>
The compositions of the invention are capable of suspending particulate solids, although particularly preferred are those systems where such solids are actually in suspension. The solids may be undissolved electrolyte, the same as or different from the electrolyte in solution, the latter being saturated electrolyte.<br><br>
Additionally, or alternatively, they may be materials which are substantially insoluble in water alone. Examples of such substantially insoluble materials are aluminosilicate builders and particles of calcite abrasive.<br>
Examples of suitable inorganic alkaline detergency builders which may be used<br>
are water-soluble alkali metal phosphates, polyphosphates, borates, silicates<br>
and also carbonates. Specific examples of such salts are sodium and<br>
potassium	triphosphates,	pyrophosphates,	orthophosphates,<br>
hexametaphosphates, tetraborates, silicates, and carbonates.<br>
Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builder salts are: (1) water-soluble amino polycarboxylates, e.g., sodium and potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetates, nitrilotriacetates and N-(2 hydroxyethyl)-nitrilodiacetates; (2) water-soluble salts of phytic acid, e.g., sodium and potassium phytates (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,379,942); (3) water-soluble polyphosphonates, including specifically, sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethane-1-hydroxy-l,1-diphosphonic acid; sodium, potassium and lithium salts of methylene diphosphonic acid; sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid; and sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethane-l,l,2-triphosphonic acid. Other examples include the alkali metal salts of ethane-2-carboxy-l,l-diphosphonic acid hydroxymethanediphosphonic acid, carboxyldiphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-l,l,2-triphosphonic acid, ethane-2-hydroxy-1,l,2-triphosphonic acid, propane-1,1,3,3-tetraphosphonic acid, propane-1,1,2,3-tetraphosphonic acid, and propane-1,2,2,3-tetra-phosphonic acid; (4) water-soluble salts of polycarboxylates polymers and copolymers as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,308,067.<br>
In addition, polycarboxylate builders can be used satisfactorily, including water-soluble salts of mellitic acid, citric acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, salts of polymers of itaconic acid and maleic acid, tartrate monosuccinate, tartrate disuccinate and mixtures thereof (TMS/TPS).<br><br>
Certain zeolites or aluminosilicates can be used.

Enzymes<br>
Enzymes which may be used in the subject invention are described in greater detail below.<br>
If a lipase is used, the lipolytic enzyme may be either a fungal lipase producible by Humicola lanuginosa and Thermomvces lanuginosus, or a bacterial lipase which show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the antibody of the lipase produced by the microorganism Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRL B-3673. This microorganism has been described in Dutch patent specification 154,269 of Toyo Jozo Kabushiki Kaisha and has been deposited with the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Tokyo, Japan, and added to the permanent collection under nr. KO Hatsu Ken Kin Ki 137  and  is available to the  public at the  United  States  Department of<br><br>
Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Northern Utilization and Development Division at Peoria, III., USA, under the nr. NRRL B-3673. The lipase produced by this microorganism is commercially available from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan, hereafter referred to as "TJ lipase". These bacterial lipases should show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the TJ lipase antibody, using the standard and well-known immune diffusion procedure according to Ouchterlony (Acta. Med. Scan., 133. pages 76-79 (1930).<br>
The preparation of the antiserum is carried out as follows:<br>
Equal volumes of 0.1 mg/ml antigen and of Freund"s adjuvant (complete or<br>
incomplete) are mixed until an emulsion is obtained. Two female rabbits are<br>
injected 45 with 2 ml samples of the emulsion according to the following<br>
scheme:<br>
day 0: antigen in complete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
day 4: antigen in complete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
day 32: antigen in incomplete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
day 64: booster of antigen in incomplete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
The serum containing the required antibody is prepared by centrifugation of clotted blood, taken on day 67.<br>
The titre of the anti-TJ-lipase antiserum is determined by the inspection of precipitation of serial dilutions of antigen and antiserum according to the Ouchteriony procedure. A dilution of antiserum was the dilution that still gave a visible precipitation with an antigen concentration of 0.1 mg/ml.<br>
All bacterial lipases showing a positive immunological cross reaction with the TJ-lipase antibody as hereabove described are lipases suitable in this embodiment of the invention. Typical examples thereof are the lipase ex Pseudomonas fluorescens IAM 1057 (available from Amano Pharmaceutical Co., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade-name Amano-P lipase), the lipase ex Pseudomonas fragi FERM P 1339 (available under the trade-name Amano B),<br><br>
the lipase ex Pseudomonas nitroreducens var. lipolyticum FERM P1338, the lipase ex Pseudomonas sp. (available under the trade-name Amano CES), the lipase ex Pseudomonas cepacia, lipases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRL B-3673, commercially available from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan; and further Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp. USA and Diosynth Co., The Netherlands, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli.<br>
An example of a fungal lipase as defined above is the lipase ex Humicola lanuginosa available from Amano under the tradename Amano CE; the lipase ex Humicola lanuginosa as described in the aforesaid European Patent Application 0,258,068 (NOVO), as well as the lipase obtained by cloning the gene from Humicola lanuginosa and expressing this gene in Aspergillus oryzae, commercially available from NOVO industri A/S under the tradename "Lipolase".

Methodology<br>
Measurement of Absorbency and Transmittance<br>
Instrument: Milton Roy Spectronic 601 Procedure:<br>
1.	Both the spectrophotometer and the power box were turned on and allowed to warm up for 30 minutes.<br>
2.	Set the wavelength.<br>
type in the desired wavelength on the keypad (i.e., 590, 640, etc.)<br>
press the [second function] key<br>
press the "go to 8" [yes] key<br>
machine is then ready to read at the chosen wavelength.<br>
3.	Zero the instrument.<br>
press the [second function] key<br><br>
press the "zero A" [% T/A/C]<br>
instrument should then read "XXX NM 0.000 A T"<br>
4.	Open the cover, place sample vertically and in front of the sensor.<br>
5.	Close the lid and record reading (ex. 640 NM 0.123 A T)<br>
*Note: all readings are taken in "A" mode (absorbency mode)<br>
*Note: zero instrument with every new wavelength change and/or new sample.<br><br>
Synthetic Sunlight Box<br>
(apparatus used for examples; used only for UVA and UVB range)<br>
Box dimensions and appearance: Length (4 ft.) 1.22 m Width (2 ft.) 0.61 m Height (2 ft.) 0.61 m<br>
Constructed of (%") 19 mm plywood. Box sits approximately (2 inches) 5.08 cm off ground for air circulation. A small fan is located in the cover of the box. Four lamps are mounted on the long side of the box; two on each side set approximately (6 inches) 15.24 cm apart.<br><br>
Fan is included so as to maintain the internal temperature throughout the duration of an experiment. This ensures that any effects seen are the result of ultraviolet light alone and not heat.<br>
Samples are placed in open containers and put in box. Open containers are used so as to limit interference of the container material on the light rays. An open container of water is added to the box as well. This water keeps atmosphere at a constant humidity and slows evaporation from the open samples. After a given period of time, samples are removed from the box, reconsidered for the evaporation of water and tested for UV effects.<br>
Accelerated Weathering:<br>
From "sunlight, UV and Accelerated Weathering" Technical Bulletin LU-0822 and QUV Accelerated Weathering Testers form Q-panel Lab Products.<br>
Sunlight is an important cause of damage to plastics, textiles, paints and other organic materials. Although UV light makes up only about 5% of sunlight, it is responsible for most of the photochemical damage. This is because the photochemical effectiveness of light increases with decreasing wavelength. Short wavelength ultraviolet light has long been recognized as responsible for most of this damage. Accelerated weathering testers are widely used for research and development, quality control, and material certification. They employ a variety of light sources to simulate sunlight and the damage cause by sunlight.<br>
To simulate the damage cause by sunlight it is not necessary to reproduce the entire spectrum of sunlight. For most materials, it is only necessary to simulate the short wavelength UV. For our specific purposes, the UVA-340 lamp was chosen. Most of this lamp"s emission in the UV-A region, with a small amount in the UV-B. This lamp is an excellent simulation of sunlight from about 370 nm, down to the solar cut-off of 295 nm.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The samples of liquid detergents (set forth in Table 1 below) containing protease and lipase were added to (1") 2.54 cm diameter glass dishes with the top off and exposed to UV light of 254 nm and 110 microwatt/cm2 (at 28" from the light source for 5 days). After each 24 hour period, the samples were weighed and topped off to replace evaporated water. Enzyme activity in the samples exposed to UV light was measured using proper substrates (e.g., casein as a protease substrate and p-nitrophenolvalerate as a lipase substrate). Percent remaining activity was calculated based on the initial activity in the sample prior to UV exposure. The samples contained either 25 mM ascorbic acid, 2.5 mM BHA, or 2.5 mM BHT as a protecting agent. This corresponded to 0.044 wt.% ascorbic acid, 0.045 wt.% BHA and 0.055 wt.% BHA. The control sample did not contain any such protecting agents. Results were as follows (Table 2a):<br><br>
*Ci2-Ci5 alkoxylated (9EO) chain group<br>
Table 2a. Effects of Antioxidants on Enzyme Stability Under UV-C Exposure (254 nm)<br><br><br>
Table 2a shows that enzyme activity is higher when antioxidant is used.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The samples of liquid detergents (Table 1 above) containing protease and lipase were added to (1") 2.54 cm diameter glass dishes with the top off and exposed to UV light of 254 nm and 110 microwatt/cm2 (at 28" from the light source for 24 hours). After 24 hours, the samples were weighed and topped off to original weight to replace evaporated water. Enzyme activity in the samples exposed to UV light was measured using proper substrate. Percent remaining activity (% enzyme remaining) was calculated based on the initial activity in the sample prior to UV exposure. The samples contained either 12.5 mM ascorbic acid, 12.5 mM BHA, or 12.5 mM BHT as a protecting agent. The control sample did not contain any such protecting agents. Results were as follows: (Table 2b):<br>
Table 2b. Effects of Antioxidants on Enzyme Stability Under UV-C (254 nm) Exposure<br><br><br>
This again shows effectiveness of compositions with antioxidants for protection of enzymes under UV exposure.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Similar experiments were earned out under similar conditions as Examples 1 and 2, but using a UV-A/B chamber (UVA= 1.01 mW/cm2, UVB= 6.17 mW/cm2 at lamp). The HDL containing enzymes and antioxidant protecting agent were exposed to UV lights for 4 days in this case. The results were as follows (Table 3):<br>
Table 3.  Effects of Antioxidants  on  Enzyme  Stability  Under UV-A/B Exposure<br><br><br><br>
The table above demonstrated that presence of ascorbic acid, BHA, BHT increased the stability of both protease and lipase under UV-a/B light as shown by % enzyme remaining. The results also demonstrate synergy between two antioxidants as shown in example containing both Ascorbic acid and BHA.<br><br>
