The present invention relates to a lance for injecting a feed material. "J The present invention relates particularly, although by no means exclusively, t to a lance that can be used in a metallurgical vessel on a continuous or batch basis and withstand substantial exposure to molten metal and slag in the vessel treat could chemically attack the lance and substantial variations in temperature in the vessel that could contribute to premature mechanical failure of the lance.<br>
The present invention relates more particularly, although by no means exclusively, to a lance that can be used in a range of operational positions to inject solid feed materials into a metallurgical vessel which contains a<br><br>
- 2A-<br>
bath of molten material having a layer of molten metal and a layer of slag with or without a mixture of molten metal and slag By the range of operational position includes but is noc limited to, positions in vhich the tip of the lance is:<br>
i. above the bath in a clear or splash zone; ii. immersed in the slag layer; or iii. immersed in the metal layer.<br>
The present invention relates inore particularly, although by no means exclusively, to a method of injecting solid feed materials into a metallurgical vessel that is based on the use of a lance of the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates more particularly, although by no means exclusively, to a lance that can be used to carry out the(HIsmelt) process for producing molten iron with top injection of solid feed materials, such aa coal, iron ore, and fluxes, to penetrate the surface of a bath of molten iron/slag in a metallurgical vessel.<br>
There is a wide range of known lances and tuyeres for injecting solid feed materials into metallurgical vessels for producing ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys. The known lances and tuyerea include by way of examplei<br>
i. The SAVARD-LEe bottom tuyere for the injection of oxygen through the refractory lining of metallurgical vessels. The tuyere comprises at least 2 concentric pipes. Typically, in use, oxygen is injected through the inner pipe and hydrocarbons (as coolant) are injected through the annular space(s) between the pipe(s). This type of tuyere is also used for injecting solids<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
entrained in &amp; carrier gas instead of oxygen (Z-Bop, KS, KM3). Kortac AG has patented several particular concentric pipe combinations of th" tuyere which, in use, are cooled by hydrocarbon mixtures with water and a carrier aas. These combinations have been used in a wide range oÂ£ applications. However, in general, the tuyere is sensitive to burn-back and erosion of refractories'around the tuyere. Typically, the burn-back velocity (and associated refractory erosion) is between 0.5 and 1.5 mm/hr. This rate of refractory loss limits tuyere life.<br>
ii. Kortec AG has also patented a horizontally or vertically movable tuyere with similar characteristics to the tuyere referred to in item i. The concentric pipes of the tuyere in this case are fixed in a round refractory sleeve and the resultant assembly of the sleeve and the pipes is progressively pushed into a metallurgical vessel to compensate for burn-back. By this method, erosion of refractories is minimised.<br>
iii. Inclined top lances, particularly for electric arc furnace applications, for the injection oE oxygen, coal, and other solids. These lances are water cooled and in a furnace operation are moved into a slag layer but are kept away from the molten metal layer to ensure that there is minimal contact withsmciten metal. Typically, the lances have A limited lifetime of 500-2000 heats (200-800 operational hours) before repairs and maintenance are retired.<br>
other known lances and tuyeres include, but are not limited to Cirosmeit lances, Ausmelt lances and steal pipes (and refractory coated steel pipes) used in. the iron and steel industries for injecting gas and solids.<br>
