Spirocyclic nitriles as protease inhibitors<br>
The invention relates to substituted carbo- and heterocyclic spiro compounds of the formula I which inhibit thiol proteases, to processes for their preparation and to the use thereof as medicaments.<br>
Proteolytic enzymes, known as proteases and peptidases, are very important enzymes which make up about 2% of the genes in the human organism, pathogenic microorganisms and also other life forms. Their particular significance is that they influence many physiological processes by playing an important role in the activation, synthesis or degradation of other proteins. This inevitably gives rise to a crucial regulatory function starting at conception, birth, growth, maturation, aging, diseases up to death.<br>
The balance of the different processes is of crucial significance for the life and survival of the organism. When there is an imbalance of protease-catalyzed processes as a result of endogenous or exogenous factors such as genetic predisposition or environmental factors, massive disruption can occur in the normal development process, acute to serious chronic health disorders up to and including life-threatening diseases.<br>
Equally, proteases are essential and responsible in replication and transmission processes of viral, bacterial and other parasitic organisms which are responsible, for instance, for infection disorders, and equally essential, of course, for all further physiological and pathophysiological processes in the plant and animal kingdom.<br>
Caused by this general great significance for our health, a multitude of protease inhibitors have already been developed, which are on the market or in all stages of development: not only as medicaments, but also as diagnostics, vaccines or food supplements.<br>
A distinction is drawn between 5 classes of proteolytic enzymes, divided according to the catalytically active radicals relevant for the enzymatic hydrolysis: aspartyl<br>
 <br>
proteases, serine proteases, cysteine proteases, metalloproteases and threonine protreases. Inhibitors of all of these classes are the subject of connprehensive studies in a wide field for the control of various types of disorders. Several very effective protease inhibitors are on the market, for example ACE inhibitors, HIV-1 protease inhibitors, and also thrombin and elastase inhibitors, followed by a large number of inhibitors in clinical phases. A summary can be found, for instance, in Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 1, No. 1 p. 71-104.<br>
Cysteine (thiol) proteases are divided into three main classes: Papain-like, ICE-like (caspases) and Picornaviral proteases. From the point of view of the mechanism, the hydrolysis of the amide bond proceeds in a similar way to that in the case of the class of the serine proteases, via an attack of the thiolate anion at the carbonyl carbon and formation of a tetrahedral transition state. The most prominent representatives of the papain superfamily, as the largest and most significant group of the thiol proteases, are the cathepsins which have a natural wide distribution in various tissues and to which an important function is attributed both in normal physiological and pathological processes. Particular emphasis should be given to intracellular protein degradation and remodeling processes. Accordingly, significance is ascribed to cysteine cathepsins in the following general disorder types: musculoskeletal disorders, particularly bone degradation disorders, inflammatory disorders, particularly arthritides, atherosclerotic disorders, emphysemas, dystrophies, cancers, disorders of the periodontal apparatus, infectious disorders (viral, parasitic and bacterial infections), neurodegenerative disorders, disorders of the immune system, ischemias, leukodystrophies, glomerulonephritis. According to the nature of the proteases, the pathogenic properties are exerted especially by three high-level mechanisms: the degradation of (connective) tissue, which initiates many types of symptoms and also further processes, the generation of pathogenic or bioactive proteins and peptides which themselves exert their action directly or in signal cascades, and antigen processing, for example the presentation of antigenic peptides at the cell surface, which then finally initiates an immune response.<br>
Known representatives of the cysteine cathepsins are particularly Cathepsin B, H, K, L, F, V, W, X, O, C and S (A.J. Barrett; N.D. Rawlings; J.F. Woessner; ed.; Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, 2nd. ed., 2004; Publisher: Elsevier, London).<br>
 <br>
Cathepsin F was found for the first time in macrophages and is involved in antigen processing. Caused by the occurrence in stimulated lung macrophages, an important function in inflammatory respiratory pathway disorders has been postulated.<br>
Cathepsin L is involved in normal lysosomal proteolysis, but also in various disease events such as melanoma metastatis.<br>
Cathepsin S plays a key role in many processes which are of significance in the context of antigen presentation and are thus present to an enhanced degree in antigen-presenting cells. In this regard, inhibitors of cathepsin S are possibly active agents in the prevention, inhibition or treatment of immune or autoimmune disorders. Moreover, cathepsin S is also secreted by several antigen-presenting cells and thus plays a role in extracellular matrix interactions which likewise have crucial significance in many pathological processes. Emphasis is given here to various (auto)immune and inflammatory disorders; particularly Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, juvenile diabetes, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris. Graves' disease, Myasthenia gravis, systemic Lupus erythematosus, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, MS, ALS, allerigic disorders such as asthma, allogenic immune responses such as rejection reactions in organ transplants or tissue grafts. Moreover, cathepsin S is connected with COPD (such as emphysema), bronchiolitis, excessive respiratory pathway elastolysis in asthma and bronchitis, pneumonitis, but also with cardiovascular disorders such as plaque ruptures and atheromers, and also endometriosis and chronic neuropathic pain. Cathepsin S is also connected with fibrillary disorders, and inhibitors can thus possibly be used for the treatment of systemic amyloidosis.<br>
Increased levels of cathepsin B and corresponding distributions are found in various tumors - a role in tumor invasion and metastatis is thus ascribed to cathepsin B. Enhanced cathepsin B activity is likewise found in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute pancreatitis, inflammatory respiratory pathway disorders, Pneumocystis carinii and bone and joint disorders. A significant increase in synovial cathepsin B levels has been detected in osteoarthritis models. A review of cytokine-independent<br>
 <br>
overexpression and relevance for osteoarthritis can be found in A. Baici et a!., Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism, 34, 6, Suppl. 2, 24-28 (2005).<br>
Cathepsin K expression is particularly marked (but not exclusively) in osteoclasts (for example D. Bromme et a!., J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2126-32 (1996)) and represents about 98% of the total cysteine protease activity there, mainly localized intracellularly within the lysosome. An autosomal recessive disruption of cathepsin K expression (absence through mutation), pycnodysostosis, is characterized by an osteopetrotic phenotype, with reduced bone resorption, ossification disorders and massive growth disorders. It has likewise been possible to show with cathepsin K antisense nucleotides and knockout mice that cathepsin K is responsible for osteoclast-mediated bone degradation. It is therefore assumed that inhibition of cathepsin K leads to reduced bone resorption and should thus constitute a possible therapy for all disorders which are characterized by elevated bone degradation, i.e. particularly for the treatment of osteoporosis. Caused by a significantly increased activity in the slightly acidic range between pH 4 and 8, enzymatic degradation of the collagen network in bone proceeds accompanied by acidolytic destruction of the mineral matrix. Here, particularly human collagen type I is affected as a main constituent of the protease in bone; this has been proven to be a very good substrate for cathepsin K. Therefore, other disorders which are accompanied by increased catabolic activity at the collagen level are also connected with cathepsins and particularly with cathepsin K. Foremost among these is osteoarthritis, characterized by an imbalance of cartilage matrix buildup and degradation, caused by catabolically active enzymes, for example metalloproteinases, among others. It is therefore obvious and has now also been proved that an inhibition of cathepsin K might likewise have favorable effects here on the disease process (synovial fibroblast-mediated collagen degradation by cathepsin K is described in W.-S. Hou etal.. Am. J. Pathol. 159, 2167-2177 (2001)). The significance of cathepsins K and S in musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis is described in detail by D. Bromme et al., Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 57, 973-993 (2005).<br>
Caused by the above-described detailed findings concerning cysteine cathepsins in various disease processes, they are considered to be very promising points of attack in<br>
 <br>
drug development, such that an intensive search has connmenced for specific, group-specific or even unspecific inhibitors.<br>
Inhibitors of cysteine proteases have been known for sometime, for example cystatines as endogenous polypeptide inhibitors. Low molecular weight inhibitors were isolated from aspergilius for the first time in 1981. These are potent in-eversible inhibitors with low toxicity, but also inadequate specificity, since not only cathepsins B, K, L, S and H but also calpaines are widely inhibited. Since then, a multitude of inhibitors with different specificities or mechanisms has been found - therefore, both irreversibly covalently binding and reversibly covalently binding or reversibly noncovalently binding inhibitors have been found or synthesized. More recent developments have been described in detail (W. Kim, K. Kang, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 13, 3, 419-32 (2002); U. B. Grabowska, Curr. Opin. Drug Disc Dev. 8, 5, 619-30 (2005); R. L. Thurmond et al., Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs 6, 5, 473-482 (2005)).<br>
Reversibly covalently binding inhibitors are of particular interest. From this group, particularly the class of the nitriles has been identified as very promising. These are described in detail, for example in the applications WO99/24460, WO2000/55125, WO2004/052921 and also in WO2005/040142.<br>
In the effort to find effective compounds for treating disorders caused directly or indirectly by cysteine cathepsins, it has now been found that the inventive spiro compounds, spirocyclic nitriles, are strong inhibitors of the cysteine cathepsins, particularly of cathepsin K and/or S, while other cysteine proteases such as calpain are inhibited much more weakly, if at all. Moreover, the inventive compounds have improved bioavailability, which has also been shown already in vito in corresponding Caco permability tests.<br>

The synthesis of the inventive products can also proceed on the basis of three starting nnaterials, any variation of the components which lead to the inventive structures being possible. For the sake of simplicity, the possible syntheses are described through these three components; however, this is not intended to constitute any restriction on the<br>
 <br>
It is a preferred route to prepare, from these three starting materials by selection of suitable derivatives of these components, for example protected or modified precursors or precursors with defined stereochemistry, the inventive compounds through suitable coupling reactions, possibly after activation with reactive reagents such as known peptide coupling reagents or reagents which lead to activated urea precurscxs. Methods of peptkje coupling are described, for instance, in Bodanszl<y bodanszky principles of peptide synthesis ed. springer berlin protecting groups their introduction detachment and stability are described for example in greene w. p.g.m. wuts protective organic ed wiley new york the preparation ureas is detail g. sartori r. maggi acyclic cyclic ureas. science></y>
It is possible for many different suitable activation and coupling reagents which are known to those skilled in the art and some of which differ in their chemistry to be used. Merely by way of example, mention is made of carbodiimides, uronium salts or else chloroformic esters for carboxylic acid activation, and of phosgene, carbonyldiimidazole or else chloroformic esters for the preparation of activated urea precursors, and of<br>
 <br>
chlorosulfonic acid or sulfur trioxide for the preparation of activated sulfonylurea precursors.<br>
It is equally possible for the sequence of coupling to be varied, or else the individual component or the two-component unit (which has been obtained by coupling two adjacent individual components) on which the activation is undertaken, or for different protecting groups to be used, foHowed by the addition of the component which is stili absent or of the components which are still absent it is also possible to change the protecting groups, for example protecting group detachments on completion of coupling or at the end of the synthesis, to prepare the compound of the formulae I and la.<br>
 <br>
The component B - amino acid derivative - used is a suitable ester, for example a methyl ester, but many other ester protecting groups are also possible. This derivative is activated on the nitrogen to give a urea precursor, for example by reaction with triphosgene, diphosgene or phosgene itself to give an isocyanate, so that a urea s forTTrod tjy stjseqiTt iBaction wfth the sptro-annme A. However, many other types of activation are also possible; for example, reaction with carbonyldiimidazole affords the activated imidazolide, reaction with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate affords the corresponding carbamate, and reaction with various similar activating carbonate reagents such as bis-succinimidyl carbonate or bis(4-nitrophenyl) carbonate affords corresponding derivatives. The analogous sulfur-containing derivatives (thiourea analogs) can be obtained correspondingly by the use of thiophosgene. However, it has to be taken into account that the strength of activation by the reagents listed is different, i.e. the subsequent reaction with the secondary spiro-amine can proceed at different speed or else afford very different yields or by-products.<br>
 <br>
Moreover, it might be necessary to achieve a preactivation by silylating the amine with, for example, trimethylsilyl chloride or bistrimethylsiliylacetamide or bistrifluoromethyltrimethylsilylacetamide in order that the actually activated urea precursor can form more easily. In addition, it might be advantageous in some cases to proceed from a free amino acid and to silylate it both on the nitrogen and on the<br>
 <br>
Next, the ester is cleaved under conditions which cause a minimum level of side reactions on the molecule, in the case of the methyl ester preferably under basic conditions, for example with NaOH or LiOH as a base, and it is advisable to avoid base excesses or long reaction times. In the case of a silyl protecting group, it may, though, also be sufficient to achieve ester cleavage by aqueous treatment, possibly with addition of a little mineral acid.<br>
Before the amide bond can be fonned with the 3rd component, the aminonitriie, the<br>
carboxylic acid is generally released from the salt with a mineral add after the basic<br>
cleavage.<br>
Subsequently, the peptide coupling can be effected by a multitude of methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art, as already mentioned above, if appropriate with addition of<br>
further auxiliary reagents for increasing the coupling efficiency or suppressing<br>
racemization.<br>
Route 1 b:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
amino acid derivative, but ratlier on component A, the spiro-amine. Since it is, however, a secondary amine, reactivities and yields are often changed compared to route 1a. For example, it is, though, possible to activate the spiro-amine as the chlorocarbonyl derivative by reaction with phosgene, triphosgene or diphosgene, and then to react the latter with the atx)vementioned amino acid ester. The abovementioned amino acid can also be used in ttie activated sitylated form.<br>
The further reaction, i.e. release of the carboxyiic add and coupling with the amine component C, is then effected as described under 1a.<br>
 <br>
The starting material is a suitable N-terminally protected amino acid derivative B. This is first coupled with the aminonltrile C; in this reaction, the known methods of peptide bond formation can again be used Subsequently, tiie N-temifii pwrtectkig group is eliminated and the elimination product is converted to tiie activated urea precursor as described under la. Under some circumstances, it is of particular significance here to use the protecting groups whose detachment conditions are compatible with the functionalities on the overall molecule B-C. This activated derivative, for example the isocyanate, is subsequently reacted with the spiro-amine to give the inventive compound I.<br>
Route 2b<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Attemativeiy. it is also Dossibie here, anatogousiy to the route desaibed under 1 b first to activate the spiro-amine A in order then to perform the reaction with component B-C to give the urea.<br>
 <br>
The synthesis of sulfonylureas is widely described. A frequently used method proceeds from an activation of the amines to give sulfonyl chlorides by reaction with preferably chlorosulfonic acid, and subsequent chlorination of the resulting sulfonic acid with, for e)mple, phosphorus pentachtoride or fKahoais oxychloride. foUcwed by the reaction with the second amino component and a suitable base. Equally, it is also possible to use SO3 in the first stage of the synthesis.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to achieve the desired conversion with sulfonyl chloride. Preference is given to undertaking the reaction on the secondary spiro-amine unit, followed by the reaction, for example, of the amino acid-amine, protected as the ester. Subsequently, the ester is cleaved and reacted with the aminonitrile unit. Alternatively, it is also possible to react the activated spiro unit with the amino acid-amidonitrile, prepared from the N-terminally protected amino acid by coupling with the aminonitrile unit followed by the protecting group detachment.<br>
Bisamides are prepared starting from amino acid units according to the following scheme:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Wnen tns spiro unit is not present as a secondary amine but rather as a carboxyiic acid, there is attachment to the amino acid via an amkle bond. This can be effected in the synthesis either first, in which case an amino acid ester is used, followed as described above in the analogous case 1 b by ester cleavage and amide coupling with the aminonitrile unit, or, when an amino acid-amidonitrile unit is used, as the second coupling stage in the synthesis, in each case accompanied by appropriate protecting group manipulations, as described above in case 2b.<br>
Optically active carbon atoms in the inventive compounds of the formulae I and la may each independently be present in R or S configuration. The compounds of the formulae I and la may be present in the form of the pure enantiomers or pure diastereomers or in the form of mixtures in any proportions of the enantiomers and/or diastereomers, for example in the form of their racemates or enantiomeric diastereomer pairs. The present invention thus relates to pure enantiomers and mixtures of the enantiomers, and equally to pure diastereomers and mixtures of the diastereomers. The invention likewise encompasses mixtures of two ctf- of more than ttK) sterecas(xners of the fomnulae I and la and likewise all possible mixing ratbs of these stereoisomers in the mixtures. In the case that the compounds of the formulae I and la are present in the form of E or Z isomers, or cis or transisomers, or as a "spiran", the invention relates in each case both to the pure E and pure Z isomers, and to the pure cis or pure transisomers, and likewise, entirely analogously, to the corresponding spiroisomers, and also E/Z or cis/trans mixtures in any ratio. The invention likewise encompasses all tautomeric forms of the inventive compounds of the formulae 1 and la.<br>
The compound of the formulae I and la is, when it occurs as a mixture of diastereomers or enantiomers or is obtained as mixtures thereof in the synthesis selected, separated into the pure stereoisomers, either by chromatography on a chiral or achiral support material, or, when the racemic compound of the formulae I and la is capable of salt<br>
 <br>
formation, by fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts fornned with an optically active base or acid as an auxiliary. Suitable chiral stationary phases for thin-layer or column chromatography separation of enantiomers are, for example, modified silica gel supports (so-called Pirkle phases) and high molecular weight carbohydrates such as triacetylceJiubse. For analytical purposes, gas chromatography methods on chiral stationary phases can also be employed after appropriate derivatization known to those skilled In the art. For enantiomer separation of the racemic carboxylic acids, an optically active, generally commercially available base such as (-)-nicotine, (+)- and (-)-phenylethylamine, quinine bases, L-lysine or L- and D-arginine are used to form the differently soluble diastereomeric salts, the less soluble component is isolated as a solid, the more soluble diastereomer is separated from the mother liquor, and the pure enantiomers are obtained from the diastereomeric salts thus obtained. In a manner similar in principle, the racemic compounds of the formulae I and la which contain a basic group, for example an amino group, can be converted to the pure enantiomers with optically active acids, for example (+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid, D- and L-tartaric acid, D- and L-lactic acid, and also (+)- and (-)-mandelic acid. It is also possible to convert chiral compounds which contain alcohol or amine functions to the corresponding esters or amides with correspondingly activated or optionally N-protected enatiomerically pure amino acids, or, conversely, to convert chiral carboxylic acids to the amides with carboxy-protected enantiomerlcally pure amino acids, or to the corresponding chiral esters with enantiomericaUy pure hydroxycarlxjxylic adds such as lactic acid. The chirality of the amino acid or alcohol radical introduced in enantiomericaUy pure form can then be utilized to separate the isomers by undertaking a separation of the diastereomers now present by crystallization or chromatography on suitable stationary phases, and then detaching the entrained chiral molecular moiety again by means of suitable methods.<br>
Furthermore, the possibility arises for some of the inventive compounds to use diastereomerically or enantiomericaUy pure starting materials to prepare the skeleton structures. This also allows different or simplified processes for purifying the end products to be used. These starting materials have been prepared beforehand in enantiomericaUy or diastereomerically pure form by literature processes. To this end, for example, it is also possible to use enzymatic processes. It is possible either to use<br>
 <br>
those enzymatic processes which proceed enantio- or diastereoselectively in one synthesis step, i.e. afford one compound selectively, or else in the sense of a kinetic enzymatic synthesis or cleavage in such a way that, for example, an enantiomer or diastereomer already present is converted highly preferentially in the enzymatic reaction, for example in the sense of a selective acylation or esterification or acyl cleavage or ester cteavage. Reactions used successfufiy are, for example, acylation reactbns with lipases or acylase cleavages of N-acety! cximpounds, or protease-mediated esterifications in organic solvents or ester cleavages, but many other possibilities are also conceivable.<br>
When amino acid derivatives are used, they are frequently commercially available already in enantiomerically pure form. In the case of non-proteinogenic amino acids, they may, however, often also be prepared from enantiomerically or diastereomerically pure natural precursors, for example from proteinogenic amino acids or else other natural chiral starting materials of the chiral pool, or else these precursors are obtained in optically pure form by one of the separation methods mentioned or by use of different types of enzymatic processes and used correspondingly in the synthesis.<br>
Acidic or basic products of the compound of the formulae I and la may be present in the form of their salts or in free form. Preference is given to pharmacologically acceptable salts, for example alkali metaJ or alkaline earth metal salts or hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, hemisulfates, ail possible phosphates and salts of the amino acids, natural bases or carboxylic acids. The present invention also includes all solvates of the compounds of the general formulae I and la, such as stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric hydrates or alcohol adducts.<br>
The preparation of physiologically compatible salts from compounds of the formulae I and la capable of salt formation, including their stereoisomeric forms, is effected in a manner known per se. The acidic compounds of the formulae I and la form stable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium salts with basic reagents such as hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, alkoxides and ammonia, or organic basis, for example methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, trimethyl or triethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine, trometamol<br>
 <br>
or else basic amino acids, for instance lysine, ornithine or arginine. When the compounds of the formulae I and la have basic groups, it is also possible to prepare stable acid addition salts with strong acid. For this purpose, useful acids are both inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, hemisulfjric acid, phosphoric actd, nitric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic add, p-totuenesuifonic add, 4-bromot)enzenesu{fonic add, cydohexylamidosutfonic add, trifluoromethyfsutfonlc add, 2-hydroxyethanesJulfonic add, formic add, acetic add, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, glycerolphosphoric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, benzoic acid, sorbic acid, gluconic add, glucuronic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. Hydrates of the compounds of the formulae I and la can be prepared, for example, by (re)crystallization from an organic-aqueous solvent mixture, for example by using such organic solvents as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethanol or methanol.<br>
Conversely, it is also possible to prepare free acid or free base forms of the compounds of the formulae I and la from the corresponding salts. For example, a compound of the formulae I and la can be released from its acid salt form by treatment v\/ith suitable bases (such as ammonia solution, sodium hydroxide solution). In some special cases, treatment with oxiranes can also bring about a release; for example, hydrochlorides can be released by treatment with methyloxirane, particulariy in the case of amino acid derivatives. Com]X)unds of the formuJae I and la which are present in the form of their base salt form can be converted to the free acid form by treatment with suitable acids (citric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid).<br>
Nitrogen compounds of the formulae I and la may also be present in the form of their N-oxides. These can be prepared by various processes which are known to those skilled in the art. For example, a nonoxidized form of a compound of the formulae I and la can be oxidized to the corresponding N-oxides by treatment with a suitable oxidizing agent (trifluoroperacetic add, permaleic acid, perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) in suitable inert organic solvents. Alternatively, the N-oxides of the compounds of the formulae 1 and la can also be prepared by using starting materials or intermediates in the form of their N-oxides or preparing them as such.<br>
 <br>
Compounds of the formulae I and la in their nonoxidized form can also be prepared from the N-oxides of the compounds of the formulae I and la by treatment with reducing reagents (such as sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenylphosphine, various borohydrides, phosphorus trichloride or-bromide and the like) in suitable inert organic solvents.<br>
Compounds of tiie fonnulae i and ia which simuttaneousty bear a basic and an acidic group, for example an amino or guanidino group and a cart)Oxy! group, may likewise be present in the form of their zwitterions (betaines), which are likewise included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The invention likewise encompasses all salts of the compounds of the formulae I and la which, owing to their low physiological tolerability, cannot be used directly in active pharmaceutical ingredients, but, for example, are used as intermediates on the route to the preparation of the inventive compounds, or else as starting materials for the synthesis of the physiologically tolerable salts. The invention further encompasses derivatives and modifications of the compounds of the formulae I and la, for example prodrugs, protected forms and other physiologically tolerable derivatives, and equally active or secondarily activable metabolites of the compounds of the formulae I and la. In particular, the invention encompasses prodrugs and protected forms of the compounds of the formulae I and la which can be converted to the compounds of the formulae I and la under physiological conditions. Suitable prodrugs of the compounds of the formiiiae I and la are in particular those chemically modffied cterivatives who properties are modified in a desired manner, for example in relation to improved solubility, bioavailability, absorption, or prolonged exposure or duration of action. The possible prodrugs are known to those skilled in the art and widely described in the literature.<br>
The invention also relates to medicaments characterized by an active content of at least one compound of the formulae I and la and/or of a physiologically compatible salt of the compound of the formulae I and la and/or a stereoisomeric or non-stereoisomeric form of the compound of the formulae I and la, together with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically compatible carrier, additive and/or other active ingredients and auxiliaries.<br>

Since many compounds of this invention are particularly inhibitors of the cysteine cathepsins B, K and S, it is possible with preference to treat disorders in which said<br>
 <br>
cathepsins contribute to the pathology or/and symptoms. This relates particularly to: pain, especially neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and various cancer types. This likewise relates to various (auto)immune disorders, particularly of the rheumatoid type, which have likewise already been listed above, and disorders characterized by excessive elastolysis, particularly of the COPD type, and related disorders listed above, and aiso cardiovascuiar disorders characterized by vascular changes, such as atherosclerosis.<br>
The inventive medicaments can be administered extravasculariy, for example intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraocularly, intraarticularly, intrasynovially, perorally, orally (buccally, perlingually, sublingually), rectally, vaginally, (trans)dermally, pulmonally (inhalatively) or nasally or intravascularly, for example intravenously, intraarterially, or intracardially, in each case as an injection or infusion. Preference is given to the oral administration form.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing a medicament, which comprises bringing a compound of the formulae I and la into a suitable administration form with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically compatible carrier and optionally further suitable active ingredients, additives or auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable soJid or pharmaceutical formulation forms are, for exanple, granules, powders, coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions, and also preparations with protracted active ingredient release in whose production customary auxiliaries such as carriers, disintegrants, binders, coatings, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are used. Frequently used auxiliaries include magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, milk protein, gelatine, starch, cellulose and derivatives thereof, animal and vegetable oils such as fish oil, sunflower oil, groundnut oil or sesame oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents such as sterile water and mono- or polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol. Moreover, it is also possible, particularly in the production of suspensions, to use compounds with quite particular, specifically established surface properties. These include, for example, dry and wet grinding, micronization, spray drying, production of<br>
 <br>
nanocrystals and similar processes, in which changing the surface properties allows, for example, improvement in solubilities or especially dissolution kinetics, which achieves, for example, improved uptake of the particular compound into the organism.<br>
The phamnaceutica! preparations are preferabfy produced and administered in dosage units, each unit containrng a particular dose of the inventive compound of the formulae i and la as an active constituent. !n tfie case of solid dosage units such as tablets, capsules, coated tablets or suppositories, this dose may be up to about 5000 mg, but preferably from about 50 to 1000 mg, and, in the case of injection solutions in ampule form, up to about 500 mg, but preferably from about 20 to 200 mg. For the treatment of an adult patient of about 70 kg in weight, according to the activity of the compound of the formulae I and la, daily doses of from about 2 mg to 5000 mg of active ingredient, preferably from about 10 mg to 1000 mg, are indicated. Under some circumstances, however, higher or lower daily doses may also be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered either by a single dose in the form of a single dosage unit or else a plurality of smaller dosage units; or else by multiple administration of divided doses at particular intervals.<br>
Inhibitors of the aforementioned type can be administered even as a monotherapy or in combination or together with other medicaments.<br>

The examples which follow were prepared analogously to the general or specific methods specified above.<br>
Example 1: Methyl (S)-2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-3-chlorocarbonylpropionate Z-asp-OMe (175 g, 622 mmol) was dissolved in THF (1750 ml) and admixed with 2 ml of DMF. 86.9 g (684 mmol) of oxalyl chloride were dissolved in 200 ml of THF (slightly exothermic), cooled back to room temperature (RT) and added dropwise to the solution of the amino acid over 1 hour (h). After a further hour at RT, the solution was initially sparged with nitrogen for 10 min, concentrated on a rotary evaporator at a maximum of<br>
 <br>
30°C and coevaporated repeatedly with toluene. The resulting dirty white solid was dried to constant weight under in-house vacuum (about 1.5 mbar) and reacted further without further purification. Yield: 186.6 g (quantitative).<br>
Example 2; Methyl (S)-2-fc)enzyioxycarbonyiamino-4-oxopentanoate Goppeni j bromide [60.9 g, 425 mmol, 1.2 equivaients (eq. )j was introduced into a 3 liter 4-neck fiask (with dropping funnei, intemaJ thermometer, argors inlet, rubber septa, in a cooling bath) and admixed with 250 ml of THF. A separate flask was initially charged at 10°C with lithium bromide (75 g, 864 mmol, 2.4 eq.) and admixed with 470 ml of THF under argon. On completion of dissolution and recooling to RT, this solution was transferred to the suspension of the copper bromide. The resulting colorless to slightly greenish solution was cooled to -60°C, and methylmagnesium chloride (141 ml of a 3.0 M solution in THF, 423 mmol) was added within 15 min. A thick yellowish precipitate formed and the temperature rose to RT. After cooling again to -60°C, the solution from example 1 (prepared from 106 g of methyl (S)-2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-3-chlorocarbonylpropionate, 353 mmol, and 360 ml of THF) was added over about 30 min and the temperature was kept below -25°C. After the addition had ended, the mixture was stirred for another 1 h, and solid ammonium chloride (30 g) was added at-15°C. After a further 2 h, the mixture was filtered, the filtrate was diluted with 400 ml of heptane and 200 ml of saturated ammonium chloride solution were aided. Once the mixture had be&amp;\ sttred at RT few 1 h, the ornic phase was removed and washed repeatedly, and the aqueous phases were reextracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and chromatographed on 1 kg of silica gel with 1:3 to 1:1 ethyl acetate/heptane. After the products had been combined and dried under reduced pressure, 83 g (84% yield) of a white solid were obtained.

Example 3: Methyl (S)-2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-4-oxoheptanoate The preparation was effected analogously to example 2, with the difference that N-propylmagnesium chloride (2 M in diethyl ether) was now used and a chromatographic purification was dispensed with. Instead, the resulting dark crude product was taken up<br>
 <br>
in 1:1 DCM/heptane and filtered tiirougii Celite. After treatment with activated carbon and filtration, the desired product was obtained in 93% yield.<br>

made of inert plastic and admixed with the ketone from example 2,<br>
dissolved/suspended in 40 ml of dichloromethane. After a reaction time of 1 day and<br>
again after 12 h, in each case 25 ml (113 mmol) of BAST were added and the mixture<br>
was stirred further at RT. After a further 12 h, dichloromethane was added and the<br>
resulting solution was rapidly added dropwise to an ice-cold saturated sodium<br>
hydrogencarbonate solution while keeping the temperature below 30'C. The organic<br>
phase was removed, the aqueous phase was extracted repeatedly with<br>
dichloromethane and the combined organic phases were washed with water, 1 N HCl<br>
and saturated in NaCl solution, dried over sodium solvate and concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure. The brown oil was then chromatographed on silica gel (3:1<br>
heptane/MTBEto2:1).<br>
Product fractions were combined and concentrated by evaporation under reduced<br>
pressure.<br>

inventive end products were conducted entirely analogously to the corresponding<br>
pentanoic acid derivatives.<br>
Example 6: Methyl (S)-2-amino-4,4-difluoropentanoate hydrobromide<br>
 <br>
10 g of the compound from example 4 were admixed at RT with 35 ml of 33% HBr in<br>
glacial acetic acid and stirred for 40 min. Subsequently, 400 ml of cold diethyl ether<br>
were added and the reaction mixture was stored at 4°C for 3 h. The precipitated<br>
product was filtered off with suction through a glass frit, washed thoroughly with cold<br>
ether and freed of solvent residues under reduced pressure. It can be used directly in<br>

The compound from example 6 (6.76 g, 28.8 mmol) was initially charged and dissolved in 240 ml of dichloromethane and 9.46 ml (117 mmol, 4.05 eq) of pyridine, cooled down to 0°C in an ice bath for 15 min and admixed with 19.86 ml of a 20% phosgene solution in toluene (37.54 mmol, 1.3 eq) within 20 - 30 seconds. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for a further 2 h, then the reaction mixture was extracted with cold half-molar HCI and ice. The water phases were reextracted with dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases were washed with ice and saturated NaCI solution, then dried over MgS04 and filtered off from the desiccant. Concentration by evaporation under<br>
reduced pressure left 5.21 g of brown oil (corresponded to a yield of 94%), which was reacted further directly.<br>
Example 8: (S)-2-{(3-Azaspiro{5.5]und«;ane-3H:a1x&gt;nyl)amkTOJH},4Kltfkj<yopentark acid></yopentark>
252 mg (1.3 mmol) of the isocyanate from example 7 were dissolved at 0°C in 5 ml of THF and admixed with 109 mg (3.25 mmol, 2.5 eq.) of sodium hydrogencarbonate and 209 mg (1.37 mmol, 1.05 eq.) of 3-azaspiro[5.5]undecane. The mixture was stirred overnight, precipitated salts were removed and the reaction mixture was treated directly with 2.5 ml of 1 M LiOH solution (2.5 mmol, 1.9 eq.). The reaction was monitored by HPLC-MS. When the mass peak of the reactant had disappeared completely, the mixture was acidified cautiously with dilute HCI and the product was isolated by extraction with ethyl acetate, drying of the organic phase over sodium sulfate and concentration under reduced pressure.

Example 10: 8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-8-carbonyl chloride<br>
1.57 ml of phosgene (20% solution in toluene, 2.96 mmol) were initially charged in 5 ml of dichloroethane and cooled to -20°C, then a mixture of 8-azaspiro-[4,5]decane (750 mg, Z96 mnrKJ) and triethylarrune (1 ml 9 mmd, 3.1 eq.) was added slowly. After 30 min, the mixture was allowed to come to RT; after 1 h, according to LC-MS, a little starting material was still present but also three new peaks. Subsequently, the mixture was added to 2 N aqueous HCI, the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane, and the organic phase was washed with saturated NaHCOs solution<br>
and dried over sodium sulfate; subsequently, the mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. Crude yield: 592 mg<br>
The material was reacted further directly without further purification. General method: see example 19.<br>
Example 11: Benzyl (S)-4-carboxymethyl-5-oxooxazolidine-3-carboxylate<br>
The compound is commercially available or can be prepared by literature methods by<br>
refluxing Z-Asp-OH with paraformaldehyde on a water separator in benzene.<br>
 <br>
Example 12: Benzyl (S)-4-chlorocarbonylmethyl-5-oxooxazolidlne-3-carboxylate The compound from example 11 was converted analogously to the manner described in example 1 to benzyl (S)-4-chiorocarbonylmethyl-5-oxooxazolidine-3-carboxylate. The product thus obtained was used without further purification in the subsequent reaction.<br>
Example 13: Benzyl (S)-5-oxo-4-(2-oxopropy!)oxazDlJdine-3-cartx)xy!ate CuBr (24,54 g, 168 mmol, 1.2 eq.) and LiBr (29.18 g, 336 mmol, 2.4 eq.) were initially charged in a baked-out flask under argon, then dissolved in 600 ml of absolute THF and stirred at RT for 20 min. This gave a clear yellow-orange solution. The mixture was then cooled to -78°C, and MeMgCI solution (55.46 ml, 168 mmol, 1.2 eq.) was added dropwise thereto. This led to a yellow suspension which was difficult to stir, so that a further 75 ml of THF were added dropwise; the mixture was subsequently stirred at -60°C for 15 min. The carbonyl chloride from example 12 dissolved in about 150 ml of THF (41.67 g, 140 mmol) was initially stirred at -60'C and then slowly added dropwise. The reaction mixture thus formed was stirred at this temperature for 1 h. The workup was effected by adding about 100 ml of saturated NH4CI solution; the mixture was<br>
stirred vigorously at -60°C for 10 min, then 200 ml of heptane and 60 ml of water were added and the mixture was stirred at RT for a further 15 min. The phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was admixed with 50 ml of 1 M HCI (green solution) and extracted t: with abcxjt 100 ml erf ethyl acetate. The contaned cxganfc ph&gt; were washed with 2 M HCI solution, saturated NaHCOs and saturated NaCI solution,<br>
dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. Subsequently,<br>
purification was effected by means of silica gel flash chromatography (5:1-2:1<br>
heptane/ethyl acetate); production fractions were combined and freed of solvent<br>
residues under reduced pressure.	Yield: 21.6 g, 56% of theory<br>

Example 14: Benzyl (S)-4-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-5-oxooxazolidine-3-carboxylate 15.52 g of the compound from example 13 (56 mmol) were suspended in 5 ml of dichloromethane and admixed with stirring with 25 g (20.8 ml, 2.02 eq.) of BAST. For 14 days, the mixture was stirred under argon. Intermediate LC-MS spectra showed that<br>
 <br>
the conversion was not yet complete after 3 and 9 days. For workup, the reaction<br>
solution was added dropwise to a cooled sodium hydrogencarbonate solution (vigorous<br>
gas evolution) and stirred further for about 30 min (no gas evolution), and the aqueous<br>
solution was then extracted by shaking tvyce with DCM. The aqueous phase was<br>
adjusted to pH 3 with dilute HC! solution and extracted by shaking with DCM twice<br>
more. Tne organic phases were combined and washed with saturated NaCl solution,<br>
dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure.<br>
The residue was chromatographed through silica gel with DCM/methanol (to 0-6%<br>
methanol), and product fractions were combined and freed of solvent residues under<br>
reduced pressure.	Yield; 8 g, corresponds to 48% of theory.<br>
Example 15: (S)-2-Benzyloxycarbonylamino-4,4-difluoropentanoic acid The compound from example 14 (4.9 g, 16.37 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of acetone and cooled to 0°C, and then 1 N sodium hydroxide solution (32.74 ml, 32.74 mmol, 2 eq.) was added. For about 2.5 h, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature; reaction monitoring by LC-MS indicated complete conversion. This was followed by addition of 20 ml of 1 N HCI, distilling-off of acetone under reduced pressure and adjustment of the solution to pH 3 to 4. The mixture was extracted twice by shaking with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated NaCI solution, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation to dryness under reduced pressure. The crude product was chromatogrhed using sBka geJ with a DCM/methanol gradient (0-6% methanol). Yield: 4.7 g (quantitative).<br>
Example 16: (S)-2-tert-Butoxycarbonylamino-4,4-difluoropentanpic acid The compound from example 15 (2.99 g, 10.44 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml of methanol and 580 mg of 10% Pd/C were added. Hydrogenation was effected at 2 bar for 3 h. Only a vanishingly small Z elimination was detected. Another 300 mg of catalyst were added and hydrogenation was effected for a further 2 h - low conversion. The same amount of catalyst was added again and hydrogenation was effected overnight; only then was the conversion complete. The mixture was filtered off from the catalyst and concentrated by evaporation. The residue was partly dissolved in dioxane/water (40 ml), and sodium carbonate (700 mg, 0.6 eq), 10.4 ml of 1 N NaOH solution<br>
 <br>
(10.4 mmol, 1 eq.) and 2,6 g of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (11.94 mmol, 1.14 eq.) were added. After about 2 h, the conversion was complete. The solution was extracted with ether and the ether phase was discarded. Subsequently, the aqueous phase was acidified to pH 3 with 1 N HCI and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with a saturated a NaCl solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered off from the desiccanl and oDncenirated by evaporation under reduced pressure.
