				<td>QUINAZOLINE(DI)ONES FOR INVERTEBRATE PEST CONTROL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain quinazoline(di)ones, their TV-oxides, agriculturally suitable salts and compositions thereof, and a method of use for controlling invertebrate pests in both agronomic and nonagronomic environments.<br>
The control of "invertebrate pests is extremely important in achievinghigh crop efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops, stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I is comprised of one or more heterocyclic rings, ah substituents are attached to these rings through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
When a compound is substituted with a substituent bearing a subscript that indicates the number of said substituents can exceed 1, said substituents (when they exceed 1) are independently selected from the group of defined substituents. Further, when the subscript indicates a range, e.g. (R)1,1, then the number of substituents may be selected from the .integers between i and j inclusive.<br>
The term "optionally substituted with one to three substituents" and the like indicates that one to three of the available positions on the group can be substituted. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R3 or R8, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present invention, comprises compounds selected from Formula I, TV-oxides and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocycles can form TV-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation .to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocycles which can form TV-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form TV-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of TV-oxides of heterocycles and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocycles and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and ra-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as /'-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethydioxirane. These methods for the preparation of TV-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature, see for example: T. L. Gilchrist in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, vol. 7, pp 748-750, S. V. Ley, Ed., Pergamon Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 3, pp 18-20, A. J. Boulton and A. McKillop, Eds., Pergamon Press; M. R. Grimmett and B. R. T. Keene in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistiy, vol. 43, pp 149-161, A. R. Katritzky,<br>
Ed., Academic Press; M. Tisler and B. Stanovnik in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 9, pp 285-291, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press; and G. W. H. Cheeseman and E. S. G. Werstiuk in Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry, vol. 22, pp 39O-392, A. R. Katritzky and A. J. Boulton, Eds., Academic Press.<br>
The salts of the compounds of the invention include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-loluenesulfonic ox valeric acids. The salts of the compounds of the invention also include those formed with organic bases (e.g., pyridine, ammonia, or triethylamine) or inorganic bases (e.g., hydrides, hydroxides, or carbonates of sodium, potassium, Hthium, calcium, magnesium or barium) when the compound contains an acidic group such as a carboxylic acid or phenol.<br>
As noted above, J is a phenyl ring, a naphthyl ring system, a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring system wherein each ring or ring system is optionally substituted with 1 to 4 substituents independently selected from R5. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these J groups refers to groups which are unsubstituted or have at least one non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the biological activity possessed by the unsubstituted analog. An example of phenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5 is the ring illustrated as U-1 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R5 and r is an integer from 0 to 4. An example of a naphthyl group optionally substituted with I to 4 R5 is illustrated as U-85 in Exhibit 1, wherein Rv is R5 and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Examples of 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatiG rings optionally substituted with 1 to 4 R5 include the rings U-2 through U-53 illustrated in . Exhibit 1 wherein Rv is R5 and r is an integer from 0 to 4. Note that J-l through J-13 below also denote 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings. Note that U-2 through U-20 are examples of J-l, U-21 through U-35 and U-40 are examples of J-2, U-36 through U-39 are examples of J-3, U-41 through U-48 are examples of J-4 and U-49 through U-53 are examples of J-5. Note that U-11 is equivalent to J-6, U-26 is equivalent to J-7 or J-10, U-42 is equivalent to J-8, U-45 is equivalent to J-9, U-4 is equivalent to J-l 1 and U-24 is equivalent to J-12 or J-13. Also note that in J-6 through J-13 that R7 and R9 are subsets of R5 of Formula I.

It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula I may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group Intel-conversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991).. One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula I One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula I and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical, organometaliic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents.<br>

Compounds of this invention are characterized by favorable metaboHc and/or soil residual patterns and exMbit activity controlling a spectrum of agronomic and non-agronomic invertebrate pests. (In the context of this disclosure "invertebrate pest control" means inhibition of invertebrate pest development (including mortality) that causes significant reduction in feeding or other injury or damage caused by the pest; related<br>
expressions are defined analogously.) As referred to in this disclosure, the term "invertebrate pest" includes arthropods, gastropods and nematodes of economic importance as pests. The term "arthropod" includes insects, mites, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, miiHpedes, pill bugs and symphylans. The term "gastropod" includes snails, slugs and other Stylornrnatophora. The term "nematode" includes all of the helminths, such as: roundworms, heartworms, and phytophagous nematodes (Nematoda), flukes (Tematoda), Acanthocephala, and tapeworms (Cestoda). Those skilled in the art will recognize that not all compounds are equally effective against all pests. Compounds of this invention display activity against economically important agronomic and nonagronomic pests. The term "agronomic" refers to the production of field crops such as for food aad fiber-and includes the growth of cereal crops (e.g., wheat, oats, barley, rye, rice, maize), soybeans, vegetable crops (e.g., lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, beans), potatoes, sweet potatoes, grapes, cotton, and tree fruits (e.g., pome fruits, stone fruits and citrus fruits). The term "nonagronomic" refers to other horticultural (e.g., forest, greenhouse, nursery or ornamental plants not grown in a field), public (human) and animal health, domestic and commercial structure, household, and stored product applications or pests. For reason of invertebrate pest control spectrum and economic importance, protection (from damage or injury caused by invertebrate pests) of agronomic crops of cotton, maize, soybeans, rice, vegetable crops, potato, sweet potato, grapes and tree fruit by controlling invertebrate pests are preferred embodiments of the invention. Agronomic or nonagronomic pests include larvae of the order Lepidoptera, such as armyworms, cutworms, loopers, and heliothines in the family Noctuidae (e.g., fall armyworm (Spodopterafugiperda J. E.

In certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, compositions of the present mvention can farther comprise a biologically effective amount of at least,one additional invertebrate pest control compound or agent having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant protection compound (e.g., protein) or the locus of the plant with a biologically effective amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection and be advantageous for resistance management.<br><br>
Invertebrate pests are controlled in agronomic and nonagronomic apphcations by-applying one or more of the compounds of this invention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present invention further comprises a method for the control of invertebrates in agronomic and/or nonagronomic apphcations, comprising contacting the invertebrates or their environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional biologically active compound or agent.<br>
A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternatively, a granular composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are also effectively delivered through plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the soil, a nursery box treatment or a dip of transplants. Compounds are also effective by topical application of a composition comprising a compound of this invention to the locus of infestation. Other rnetu-ods 01 contact mcnide application of a compound or a composition or tne invention oy direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, seed coatings, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, foggers, fumigants, aerosols, dusts and many others.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into.baits that are consumed by the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising:" between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99% vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates, particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl butoxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest's life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are<br><br>
sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as lMe-as 0,0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as S kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square meter but as little as 0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.<br>
The foflowing Tests in the Biological Examples of the Invention demonstrate the efficacy of methods of the invention for protecting plants from specific arthropod pests. "Control efficacy'" represents inhibition of arthropod development (including mortality) that causes significantly reduced feeding. The pest control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A-D for compound descriptions. The following abbreviations are used in the Index Tables that follow: t is tertiary, n is normal, / is iso, s is secondary, c is cyclo, Me is methyl, Et is ethyl, Pr is propyl and Bu is butyl; accordingly z'-Pr is isopropyl, s-Bu is secondary butyl, etc. The abbreviation "Ex." stands for "Example" and is followed by a number indicating in which example the compound is prepared.<br>
