				<td>AN INTERLABIAL PAD SPECIFICATION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an interlabial product and an individual<br>
wrapping body provided with a form for ensuring finger insertion, and a<br>
manufacturing method thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, a sanitary napkin and a tampon are used generally as a<br>
female sanitary product. Here, there have been great efforts to prevent the leak<br>
of menstrual blood from a gap caused by poor adhesion near the ostium<br>
vaginae as for the sanitary napkin. Moreover, as for the tampon, there have<br>
been great efforts for relieving a foreign feeling and discomfort when the<br>
sanitary product is put on and for lowering the difficulty in insertion of the<br>
product due to the nature of the product.<br>
Under such situation, an interlabial product has attracted people as a<br>
sanitary product positioned between the sanitary napkin and the tampon in<br>
recent years.<br>
The interlabial product is fixed by inserting it between the labia, having<br>
characteristics that it is difficult to cause the leak of menstrual blood because of<br>
higher adhesion to the body than that of the sanitary napkin and psychological<br>
resistance thereof on wearing is lower than that of the tampon which is inserted<br>
into the vagina. Moreover, it is sanitary and clean because the range of the<br>
body or the skin soiled with menstrual blood is small as compared with the<br>
sanitary napkin which is used by attaching to an underwear. Further, since the<br>
product size of the interlabial product is smaller than that of the sanitary napkin,<br>
a feeling of wearing is not deteriorated generally and it is comfortable.<br>
However, compared with the sanitary napkin, the interlabial product has<br>
the disadvantage that it is more difficult to insert than the napkin, because the<br>
interlabial product is to be inserted between the labia which are difficult to be<br>
seen. Moreover, when it is not inserted in a proper position, leakage may cause<br>
serious damage because the interlabial product is smaller than the napkin in<br>
size. Also, compared with the tampon, it may be more possible for the product<br>
to be mis-inserted than for the tampon.<br>
As a product improved in the difficulty of insertion of such an interlabial<br>
pad, PCT International Patent Publication No. WO99/56689 discloses a pad<br>
having a structure provided with a projecting part on the back of the contact side<br>
with a body. According to this structure, a wearer can insert the pad by picking<br>
up said projecting part, therefore, the insertion is regarded easier in this case<br>
than in the case without said projecting part.<br>
However, in such a structure, the insertion point is detected by a fingertip<br>
of the wearer, therefore, the wearer has to insert the pad by intuition, and it is<br>
quite difficult for the wearer to locate the right insertion point. Namely, a<br>
conventional interlabial product has not been developed well enough to be<br>
inserted with a wearer's confidence for the right insertion point. Especially, and<br>
since a woman often keeps her nails long or often wears fake nails, it is<br>
sometimes almost impossible for her to insert the above-mentioned<br>
conventional interlabial product in the right place. Moreover, it is also difficult to<br>
put the interlabial pad on the pudenda utilizing only the projecting portion to be<br>
pinched so as to make a close contact between them.<br>
Thus, the conventional interlabial product mentioned above have not<br>
been developed enough to facilitate the insertion by properly locating the<br>
insertion point and reduce the occasion at mis-insertion or allow the product to<br>
have a sufficiently close contact with the pudenda. Further, such a situation<br>
sometimes occur, as menstrual blood etc. adhere to a fingertip at the time of<br>
inserting the pad, which may cause the wearer to form a sense of resistance<br>
when the interlabial product is used.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made considering the above-described<br>
task, and the purpose is to provide an interlabial product of a structure which<br>
facilitates exact and sanitary insertion of the product between labia of a woman,<br>
and to provide an individual wrapping body enclosing such product.<br>
In order to achieve the above-described task, the inventors have<br>
developed an interlabial product provided with a structure permitting to insert it<br>
so that it sufficiently and closely adheres to vagina while a wearer is confirming<br>
an insertion position by utilizing a sensitive finger cushion. To be more concrete,<br>
the product is characterized in that the interlabial product is curled up to form a<br>
pocket allowing a fingertip to be smoothly inserted so that the product can<br>
smoothly be inserted between the labia by the finger inserted in the pocket.<br>
To be more concrete, the present invention provides as follows.<br>
(1) An interlabial product which comprises a water-permeable surface<br>
side sheet, a back side sheet, and an absorbent body for absorbing body fluid<br>
disposed between the surface side sheet and the back side sheet, the product<br>
comprising a cylindrical portion in which a finger can be inserted when it is<br>
used; and wherein said cylindrical portion comprises said surface side sheet,<br>
said back side sheet, and said absorbent body.<br>
The cylindrical portion may be formed only when a finger is inserted<br>
therein, and does not need to be cylindrical before finger insertion. For example,<br>
the cylindrical portion includes a portion to form a cylindrical structure at the<br>
time of insertion of a finger therein even though the cylindrical portion is<br>
collapsed and folded up in two when it is enclosed in an individual wrapping<br>
body.<br>
A wearer can secure the interlabial product by inserting a finger into the<br>
cylindrical portion so that a finger cushion of the finger is faced to an inner face<br>
of the cylindrical portion. The wearer can thereby securely holds the interlabial<br>
product, until the interlabial product is inserted between the labia. Following this,<br>
by making the length direction of the interlabial product aligned in the same<br>
direction of the finger insertion, the vulvar slit and the interlabial product are<br>
aligned in the same direction so that it is easier for the wearer to insert the<br>
product in the labia.<br>
Further, since the wearer can insert the interlabial product while detecting<br>
the insertion point with a ball of the finger and while the finger pressure for<br>
pushing the interlabial product between the labia can uniformly be applied in the<br>
longitudinal direction, even closer contact between the interlabial and the inside<br>
of the labia may be made.<br>
(2) The interlabial product according to (1), comprising a flap portion as a<br>
sector form area adjacent to said cylindrical portion, wherein said flap portion<br>
comprises said surface side sheet, said back side sheet, and said absorbent<br>
body.<br>
Since the finger can be inserted into the cylindrical portion from a flap<br>
portion, the insertion can easily be performed.<br>
(3) The interlabial product according to (1) or (2), characterized in that<br>
said cylindrical portion gets gradually smaller in diameter along a finger<br>
insertion direction when it is used.<br>
While the finger is being inserted, the deeper the finger is inserted in the<br>
cylindrical portion, the more difficult the finger insertion becomes so that the<br>
interlabial product can naturally be fixed on the finger. Therefore, the shape of<br>
the cylindrical portion in accordance with the present invention includes not only<br>
a simple cylindrical shape but also a plummet shape, for example, a conic<br>
shape, a pyramid shape, a truncated cone shape, a truncated pyramid shape,<br>
etc.<br>
(4) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (3),<br>
characterized in that said cylindrical portion is extended up to an end portion of<br>
the interlabial product along the finger insertion direction, and that said<br>
cylindrical portion covers a wearer's finger inserted in said cylindrical portion.<br>
A wearer can perform a sanitary inserting operation without touching the<br>
labia or menstrual blood adhering to the labia at the time of insertion of the<br>
interlabial product between the labia.<br>
(5) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (4),<br>
characterized in that said cylindrical portion is extensible or elastic at least in a<br>
lateral direction.<br>
The interlabial product changes its shape in accordance with the inserted<br>
finger so as to be secured by the finger. Moreover the wearer can identify the<br>
wear point more easily.<br>
(6) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (5),<br>
characterized in that the flap comprises a pair of flap pieces.<br>
A wearer may visually check a finger insertion opening of the cylindrical<br>
portion through between a pair of flap pieces, as well as visually recognize the<br>
depth of the cylindrical portion so that even an inexperienced wearer can easily<br>
perform the wearing operation.<br>
(7) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (6),<br>
characterized in that a tacking agent is applied on an inner surface of said<br>
cylindrical portion for a fingertip of the finger.<br>
The interlabial product is secured and is inserted in the labia without a<br>
positional deviation between the finger and the product.<br>
(8) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (7), wherein said<br>
absorbent body is enclosed between said surface side sheet and said back side<br>
sheet, and wherein said back side sheet is disposed inside of said cylindrical<br>
body.<br>
The interlabial product may be what is called a laminated type.<br>
(9) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (7), wherein said<br>
absorbent body and said back side sheet are enclosed in said surface side<br>
sheet, and wherein said surface side sheet is disposed inside and outside of<br>
said cylindrical body.<br>
The interlabial product may be what is called an enclosed type.<br>
(10) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (9), wherein<br>
said interlabial product is a product for incontinence.<br>
According to the interlabial product according to the present invention,<br>
the product can be used for incontinence absorb product. Since the ostium<br>
vaginae where the menstrual blood is discharged and the urethral meatus<br>
where urine is discharged locate between labia, and the interlabial product<br>
according to the present invention to be used between labia can also absorb<br>
urine.<br>
As described hereinbefore, the product according to the present invention<br>
can absorb urine between the labia, especially around the urethral meatus and<br>
is useful for the absorbing product for incontinence, especially for a light<br>
incontinence.<br>
(11) The interlabial product according to any one of (1) to (9), wherein<br>
said interlabial product is a product for absorbing vaginal discharge.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the interlabial product can be<br>
used for the product for absorbing the vaginal discharge. Since the interlabial<br>
product is used between the labia, it can absorb the excretion other than the<br>
menstrual blood from the ostium vaginae for the use therefore (for absorbing<br>
the vaginal discharge).<br>
As described above, the product can absorb the vaginal discharge in<br>
order to reduce the discomfort to the wearer, and is useful for the wearer who is<br>
not menstruating.<br>
(12) An individual wrapping body comprising the interlabial product<br>
recited in any one of (1) to (11), and a wrapping sheet for entirely covering and<br>
enclosing said interlabial product.<br>
Since the interlabial product is compactly enclosed in a wrapping sheet in<br>
a sanitary condition before use, a single interlabial product can be taken out of<br>
an individual wrapping body as required. A releasable folded part, a tab,<br>
perforations, or a small cut for opening may be formed on the individual<br>
wrapping body.<br>
(13) The individual wrapping body according to (12), wherein said<br>
interlabial product is folded up and enclosed so that the flap pieces open when<br>
the individual wrapping body is unwrapped.<br>
Since the product is folded when it is enclosed, it is compactly packaged.<br>
Preferably, the product is folded in two in the lateral direction along the<br>
longitudinal center line. And, since the flap pieces can be opened when the<br>
individual wrapping body is unwrapped, the finger can easily be inserted into the<br>
cylindrical portion.<br>
(14) The individual wrapping body according to (12) or (13), characterized<br>
in that the interlabial product is disposed so that the finger insertion opening of<br>
said cylindrical portion is positioned to face the unwrapping opening of said<br>
individual wrapping body.<br>
Since the finger is positioned along the longitudinal direction on the<br>
garment face side of the interlabial product, the inserting operation is speedily<br>
operated and a close contact with the labia is secured more by applying the<br>
finger pressure over the longitudinal direction of the interlabial product for<br>
inserting the product between the labia.<br>
Moreover, since the direction for securing the interlabial product by the<br>
finger to the longitudinal direction of the garment face side of the interlabial<br>
product is specified, as well as the finger cushion is made to face the body side<br>
when the interlabial product is secured by the finger, the interlabial product can<br>
be inserted while the wearer is locating the insertion point by the sensitive finger<br>
cushion even if the insertion between the labia is difficult to be checked visually.<br>
Also, since a direct contact between the labia and the finger can be prevented<br>
when the interlabial product is inserted in the labia, the inserting operation can<br>
be performed in a sanitary condition.<br>
(15) A method for manufacturing an individual wrapping body comprising:<br>
a process for folding the interlabial product recited in any one of (1) to (11) in<br>
two parts in a lateral direction along a longitudinal center line; and a process for<br>
enclosing said interlabial product in the wrapping sheet.<br>
The individual wrapping sheet can easily be manufactured. Any enclosing<br>
mode in the wrapping sheet may apply. Preferably, the interlabial product is<br>
formed to be symmetrical to the longitudinal center line.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[Constitution]<br>
Fig.1 is a schematic plan view showing the interlabial product in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Fig.2 and Fig.3 are<br>
schematic perspective view of the interlabial product in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Fig.4 is a schematic cross-sectional view<br>
taken along the arrowed line A-A of Fig.1. Fig.5 is a schematic cross-sectional<br>
view taken along the arrowed line B-B of Fig.1. Fig.4 and Fig.5 illustrate what is<br>
called a laminated type of the embodiment.<br>
As shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5, the interlabial product 1 in accordance with<br>
this embodiment comprises a surface side sheet 11 composed of a body fluid<br>
permeable material, a back side sheet 13, and an absorbent body 12 for<br>
absorbing body fluid. The surface side sheet 11 and the back side sheet 13 are<br>
bonded together on the peripheral portion so as to enclose the absorbent body<br>
12 and to be formed in one body. The surface side sheet 11 and the back side<br>
sheet 13 are bonded by means of heat emboss processing and/or bonding with<br>
a hot-melt type adhesive.<br>
The interlabial product is provided with a cylindrical portion 20 permitting<br>
to insert a finger therein when it is used, and a flap portion as a fan-top area<br>
composed of a pair of flap pieces 22a, 22b arranged adjacent to said cylindrical<br>
portion in the opposite direction of finger insertion direction 27. The cylindrical<br>
portion is comprised of the surface side sheet 11, the absorbent body 12, and<br>
the back side sheet 13. The pair of the flap pieces 22a, 22b are also, as the<br>
cylindrical portion 20, comprised of the surface side sheet 11, the absorbent<br>
body 12, and the back side sheet 13. The surface side sheet 11, the absorbent<br>
body 12, and the back side sheet 13 are continuous with the flap pieces 22a,<br>
22b via the cylindrical portion 20.<br>
The cylindrical portion 20 is bonded from the side edge portion 28 up to<br>
the corner portion along the longitudinal direction of the back side sheet 13,<br>
while the flaps 22a, 22b are not bonded along the longitudinal side edge faces<br>
of the back side sheet 13. When these are bonded, the back side sheet 13 is<br>
placed inside of the cylindrical portion.<br>
The side edge portions to be bonded together need at least 10% or<br>
longer of the length in the longitudinal direction of the interlabial product, and<br>
more preferably, they have 30 - 60% of the length.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig.3, a part of fingertip portion is not<br>
bonded so as to form an opening 29. The bonded portion may be arranged in<br>
such a structure as the bonded portion starts with about the middle of the side<br>
edge portion of the interlabial product and extends to the end portion of the<br>
interlabial product where the fingertip end portion is located. Here, to extend to<br>
the end portion of the interlabial product where the fingertip end portion is<br>
located means that a wearer's finger can be well covered with the cylindrical<br>
portion up to the fingertip. When the wearer's finger is well covered with the<br>
cylindrical portion up to the fingertip, the opening 29 either may be formed or<br>
may not be formed.<br>
Compared with the cylindrical portion 20, the flap pieces 22a, 22b are<br>
open in the lateral direction. In such a manner, the finger insertion opening 26 of<br>
the cylindrical portion as well as the depth of the cylindrical portion become<br>
visible to a wearer, therefore, even an inexperienced wearer can naturally be<br>
directed to the operation for securing the interlabial product by her finger.<br>
The cylindrical portion may gradually become smaller in diameter along<br>
the direction 27 of finger insertion when it is used. For example, the side edge<br>
portion of the interiabial product can be provided with this structure by widely<br>
arranging the width of the side edge portion in the neighborhood of the finger<br>
insertion opening 26, and gradually narrowing it in the direction 27 of finger<br>
insertion of the cylindrical portion 20.<br>
The side edge portion of the interlabial product can also be provided with<br>
this structure by another method in which the absorbent body 12 positioned in<br>
the neighborhood of the finger insertion opening 26 is narrowly arranged in<br>
width and the absorbent body 12 is gradually increased in width in the direction<br>
27 of the finger insertion of the cylindrical portion 20. Otherwise, both methods<br>
may be used together.<br>
With such structure, it becomes possible to eliminate a positional<br>
deviation between the finger and the interlabial product until the product is<br>
inserted after the interlabial product is secured by inserting the finger into the<br>
cylindrical portion thereof, and this allows the interlabial product to obtain even<br>
contact surfaces on the right and the left inner walls of labia.<br>
Inside of the individual wrapping body, a type of the interlabial product<br>
laminated approximately along the longitudinal center line is folded up in the<br>
lateral direction so that the back side sheet is faced to each other. Therefore,<br>
the cylindrical portion 20 is not cylindrical either inside of the individual wrapping<br>
body, but is folded flat in two. For example, in the case of the laminated type, it<br>
is formed by being folded in such a way as the garment side of the back side<br>
sheet is faced together approximately along the longitudinal center line, and the<br>
mutually overlapping parts of the right and left side edge portions are bonded<br>
together.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5,<br>
the interlabial product may be what is called such a laminated type as the side<br>
edges are formed by bonding the surface side sheet and the back side sheet<br>
together on the side edge portions of the absorbent body to prevent the<br>
absorbent body from coming off.<br>
[Enclosed Type]<br>
In the interlabial product in accordance with another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, as shown in Fig.6 and Fig.7, the interlabial product may be<br>
what is called an enclosed type in which the back side sheet 33 is arranged on<br>
the garment surface side of the absorbent body 32, and then the surface side<br>
sheet 31 encloses the absorbent body 32 and the back side sheet 33.<br>
According to this embodiment, the interlabial product comprises the<br>
water-permeable surface side sheet 31, the back side sheet 33, and the<br>
absorbent body 32 for absorbing body fluid arranged between the surface side<br>
sheet 31 and the back side sheet 33. Namely, in Fig.6 and Fig.7, the surface<br>
side sheet 31, the absorbent body 32, the back side sheet 33, and the surface<br>
side sheet 31 are arranged in the order from the outside toward the inside of the<br>
cylindrical portion of the interlabial product. The surface side sheet 31 is<br>
continuous. In the case of an enclosed type, to form the cylindrical portion, the<br>
back side sheet 33 and the absorbent body 32 are mutually bonded with the<br>
back side sheet inside and the absorbent body 32 outside from a part of the<br>
longitudinal side edge portion of the surface side sheet 31 to corner portion.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Fig.6 and Fog.7, the surface side<br>
sheet 31 is overlapped and bonded together in the neighborhood of the inside<br>
longitudinal center line. However, the overlapping position is not limited to this<br>
position.<br>
Also in the case of the enclosed type, a cylindrical portion permitting to<br>
insert a finger therein when it is used, and flap portions as sectorial top areas in<br>
the direction opposite to the finger insertion direction adjacent to said cylindrical<br>
portion are formed on the interlabial product. Namely, also in the case of the<br>
enclosed type, the appearance is as shown in Fig.1 - Fig.3. The cylindrical<br>
portion is comprised of, the surface side sheet 31, the absorbent body 32, the<br>
back side sheet 33, and the surface side sheet 31 in the order from the outside<br>
to the inside, and just like the cylindrical portion, the flap pieces 22a, 22b are<br>
also comprised of the surface side sheet 31, the absorbent body 32, the back<br>
side sheet 33, and the surface side sheet 31. The surface side sheet 31, the<br>
absorbent body 32, and back side sheet 33 are continuous from the cylindrical<br>
portion to the flap portions.<br>
The embodiment of the laminated type is mainly explained in the<br>
following, however, the present invention is not to be restricted to the<br>
embodiment of this type.<br>
[Tensibility]<br>
The finger insertion portion, namely, the cylindrical portion may be<br>
arranged so as to flexibly correspond to various sizes of wearers' fingers by<br>
being provided with elasticity or tensibility at least in the lateral direction in the<br>
neighborhood of the side edge portion. Such characteristics can be obtained<br>
from corrugation processing in which the side edge portion is formed to be<br>
gathered by pressing the side edge portion with a male and a female molds<br>
having recessed and projecting portion arranged with intervals in the<br>
longitudinal direction. Otherwise, an elastic material, for example, rubber may<br>
be used for the side edge portion. A fiber sheet having elasticity, especially, a<br>
fiber sheet containing elastic fiber, for example, non-woven fabric containing<br>
urethane fiber is also applicable.<br>
[Breaking Strength]<br>
The finger insertion portion, namely, the cylindrical portion, in which a<br>
wearer can insert a finger in the longitudinal direction of the interlabial product,<br>
is formed on the garment surface side of the back side sheet by bonding<br>
together the right and left side edge portions of the interlabial product folded<br>
along the longitudinal centerline.<br>
In the bonding portion for bonding the side edge portions, the breaking<br>
strength is preferred to be at least 30cN or higher. The breaking strength is a<br>
value measured when the interlabial product is cut apart in the longitudinal<br>
direction along the folded part and the cut portions are held with chucks,<br>
respectively, and the maximum tensile strength is measured by stretching the<br>
bonded portion at a speed of 100mm/min. More preferably, the breaking<br>
strength is in a range of 40 - 300cN, and it is most preferable that the breaking<br>
strength ranges 40 -150cN.<br>
[Tacking Agent]<br>
As shown in Fig.8, a tacking agent 42 may be applied to the inner surface<br>
of the cylindrical portion of the interlabial product. Fig.8 is a development before<br>
the cylindrical portion is formed, and the peripheral portion 44a and the<br>
peripheral portion 44b are bonded together to form the cylindrical portion. After<br>
the cylindrical portion has been formed, the tacking agent is applied to the inner<br>
surface 42 of the cylindrical portion. As to a preferred arrangement of the<br>
tacking agent, it is preferred that the tacking agent is applied on the ball of the<br>
fingertip and along the longitudinal direction of the folded jpart 48 of the<br>
interlabial product. When the tacking agent is arranged near the side of the ball<br>
of the fingertip, a press force is applied to the interlabial product by the fingertip<br>
when the interlabial product is inserted in the labia, therefore, the press force<br>
can prevent the finger from deviating. When the finger is drawn out of the<br>
cylindrical portion after insertion, the finger can be drawn out by relaxing the<br>
pressint force at the fingertip, and releasing the finger in the direction of the<br>
crotch from the inner surface of the cylindrical portion. In this case, the tacking<br>
agent is applied nearer to the folded portion than to the bonding portion for<br>
bonding the side edge portions of the interlabial product.<br>
The interlabial product before use is folded along the folding portion, and<br>
the back side sheet may be tacked together via the tacking agent. In this case,<br>
tacked portions of the back side sheet via the tacking agent may be separated<br>
by the wearer's finger insertion by a wearer into the finger insertion portion<br>
(cylindrical portion), and the tacking agent is exposed to the inner surface of the<br>
cylindrical portion, to come into contact with the inserted finger.<br>
The tacking agent is applied in a form of lines, a sprayed form, a meshed<br>
form, an O-letter-form, a form of dots, etc. Moreover, a preferred tacking agent<br>
is provided with a sufficient anchor effect so as not to be left on the finger when<br>
the finger is drawn out, and the tacking agent is preferred to be applied by<br>
means of using a coater or printing.<br>
An example of a method for evaluating adhesion of the tacking agent will<br>
be explained below. Such an evaluation method is through measuring peel<br>
strength (refer to Fig.18) of an adhesive, and shear strength (refer to Fig.19) of<br>
the adhesive, and is performed by using a constant speed stretch tensile tester<br>
and a 80mm long and 50mm wide stainless plate. When the evaluation test is<br>
carried out, a polyethylene film of about the same size as the stainless plate is<br>
coated with an adhesive so as to be 25mm wide and 50mm long, and is left at a<br>
room temperature (20 degree C) for 30 minutes beforehand. Next, the<br>
polyethylene film is lightly superposed on the stainless plate so that the<br>
adhesive is in contact with the stainless plate, and is rolled by a 2kg roller only<br>
one way. And then, the film is left at a room temperature (20 degree C) for 30<br>
minutes to make a test specimen. In the peel strength test, the polyethylene<br>
film part of the test specimen made as described above is peeled by pulling it in<br>
the direction of the arrow A as shown in Fig.18, and in the shear strength test,<br>
the polyethylene film part is pulled in the direction of the arrow B shown in<br>
Fig.19. However, as the test conditions, a chuck distance (grip distance) is<br>
specified as 70mm, and a stretching speed is specified as 100mm/min. When<br>
the measurements are carried out according to the above method, it is<br>
preferable that the measured peel strength of the specimen is 100 -<br>
2000mN/25mm, and the measured shear strength of the specimen is 2900 -<br>
15000mN/25mm. These are the values considering a load on wearer's skin.<br>
Thus, by applying a finger-tacking tacking agent at least in the<br>
neighborhood of the finger-touch point in the finger insertion portion,<br>
sliding-caused deviation between the interlabial product and the finger can<br>
surely be prevented until the interlabial product has been fixed between the<br>
labia after the interlabial product is secured by the finger.<br>
[Developed Shape]<br>
Developed shapes in accordance with one embodiment of the interlabial<br>
product when it is developed on a plane are shown in Fig.9 and Fig.10. The<br>
developed shape may be elliptic, egg-shaped, drop-shaped, dumbbell-shaped,<br>
or the like, however, as shown in Fig.9 and Fig.10, it may be an elliptic shape<br>
with a cut.<br>
As shown in Fig.9, as to the shape of the end portion 55 of the interlabial<br>
product 50 before the side edge portions 52a, 52b are bonded, the border line<br>
54 connecting the side edge portions 52a, 52b of the interlabial product may be<br>
orthogonal to the longitudinal center line 58. Although the border line 54 is a<br>
straight line in Fig.9, this may be a curved line. A preferred border line is shaped<br>
symmetrical with respect to the longitudinal center line 58.<br>
As shown in Fig.10, the shape of the end portion 65 of the interlabial<br>
product 60 before connecting the side edge portions 62a, 62b may be provided<br>
with the cutting lines 64a, 64b from the side edge portions 62a, 62b of the<br>
interlabial product in the direction of the finger insertion. It is preferable that the<br>
shape is formed symmetrical with respect to the longitudinal center line 68. The<br>
cutting lines are not limited to a straightline but may be a curved line.<br>
When the interlabial product is thus formed into a shape with a cut in the<br>
end portion, an extending portion from the top of the fingertip is shortened and a<br>
form fitted to the fingertip shape can be obtained so that a wearer may<br>
recognize (from the feeling of the fingertip during insertion) that the fingertip is in<br>
the neighborhood of the top end of the interlabial product, and this makes it<br>
easier for the wearer to apply sufficient pressing force to the ostium vaginae of<br>
the menstrual blood outlet.<br>
[Dimensions]<br>
A lengthwise dimension (longitudinal dimension) and a widthwise<br>
dimension (lateral dimension) of the interlabial product should be determined<br>
not only within a range in which the interlabial product can be inserted and held<br>
in the labia, but also considering the adhesion to the inside of labia. The<br>
longitudinal length of the interlabial product is preferred to be 60 - 150mm, more<br>
preferably, 80 - 120mm. In this case, when the length is longer than 150mm, the<br>
interlabial product has a too large contact face between the garment side<br>
surface thereof and an underwear or the like, and this causes friction force<br>
stronger than the holding strength of the interlabial product by the labia<br>
themselves, and the interlabial product is at the risk of coming off. On the<br>
other hand, when the length is shorter than 60mm, the interlabial product<br>
cannot have a sufficient area and volume for staying between the labia,<br>
therefore, said interlabial product is prone to fall off.<br>
The widthwise length of the interlabial product before the cylindrical<br>
portion is formed is preferred to be 10 - 60mm, more preferably, 30 - 50mm. In<br>
this case, if the width is wider than 60mm, the edge portions of the interlabial<br>
product rub the femoral regions of the wearer, and this causes friction force<br>
between them every time when the wearer moves. And, if such friction holding<br>
strength exceed the force of the labia themselves holding the interlabial product,<br>
said interlabial product between the labia is in danger of falling off. Moreover,<br>
when the width is narrower than 10mm, the interlabial product cannot have an<br>
area and a volume enough to stay between the labia, and said interlabial<br>
product is prone to fall off.<br>
A longitudinal dimension of the absorbent body may be the same as that<br>
of the interlabial product, and may be arranged with 2 - 10mm spacing<br>
considering the flexibility of the interlabial product. A width dimension of the<br>
absorbent body is arranged in a range of 30 - 70mm, preferably in a range of 35<br>
- 55mm. Following this, a width dimension of the interlabial product is arranged<br>
considering ease of finger insertion in the finger insertion portion, and a<br>
dimension little influenced by body movement while being worn, and the width is<br>
arranged to be at least 40mm or wider when the interlabial product is developed<br>
in a plane, preferably, it is arranged in a range of 50 - 70mm.<br>
A thickness of the interlabial product related to the present invention is<br>
preferred to be 0.5 - 20mm, and more preferably, 2 - 10mm.<br>
Since the interlabial product is inserted between the sensitive labia, a<br>
20mm or thicker product gives a wearer a foreign feeling when she wears it. On<br>
the other hand, when the thickness is 0.5mm or less, the enclosed absorbent<br>
body's volume is prone to be insufficient for absorbing menstrual blood, and the<br>
menstrual blood is in danger of oozing from the interlabial product.<br>
The interlabial product may be used by itself, or it can be used together<br>
with a sanitary napkin by putting it on the underwear, or it can be used together<br>
with a tampon by inserting it in the vagina.<br>
[Method for Manufacturing Laminated Type]<br>
In the interlabial product, the surface side sheet is arranged on the body<br>
surface side of the absorbent body, and the back side sheet is arranged on the<br>
garment side of the absorbent body. Between the absorbent body and the<br>
surface side sheet or between the absorbent body and the back side sheet, a<br>
bonding agent may be applied for bonding them together.<br>
The peripheral portion forming the periphery of the absorbent body is<br>
formed by bonding the surface side sheet and the back side sheet with each<br>
other, and the bonding is carried out by means of a sealing method such as<br>
heat-seal and ultrasonic seal, or a bonding agent such as a hot-melt type<br>
bonding agent and an emulsion-type bonding agent, or a combination of both<br>
sealing and bonding methods. Thus, the absorbing portion of the interlabial<br>
product is formed.<br>
Following this, the absorbing layer integrating the absorbent body, the<br>
surface side sheet, and the back side sheet is folded in the lateral direction<br>
along the longitudinal center line so that the back side sheet faces itself with<br>
each other, and then, the overlapping peripheral portion is partly bonded, and is<br>
cut into a predetermined shape keeping the folded state as it is, to form the<br>
outline of the interlabial product.<br>
[Bonding Method]<br>
As a method for bonding the overlapping side edge portions of the<br>
interlabial product folded along the longitudinal center line, methods such as<br>
heat-seal and ultrasonic seal, or a bonding agent such as an hot-melt type<br>
bonding agent and an emulsion-type bonding agent, or the use of sealing and<br>
bonding agents together can be employed.<br>
When the heat-seal is used, a sealing width is arranged in a range of 1 -<br>
3mm considering a favorable wear feeling. Following this, the sealing may be<br>
arranged like a continuous line, however, the arrangements such as a dashed<br>
line alternately arraying a bonded portion and a non-bonded portion, a dotted<br>
form, and a mesh form are more preferable.<br>
A bonding agent for bonding (sticking) each material, hot-melt type<br>
bonding agent, which are generally used, can be used, and as examples, a<br>
pressure sensitive hot-melt type bonding agent and a thermo-sensible hot-melt<br>
type bonding agent can be employed. The pressure sensitive hot-melt bonding<br>
agent comprising mainly a synthetic rubber resin such as<br>
styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene<br>
block copolymer (SBS), styrene-ethylene/butadiene-styrene block copolymer<br>
(SEBS), and styrene-ethylene/propylene-styrene block copolymer, and can be<br>
obtained by melt-blending therein an adhesion additive such as a terpene resin<br>
and a rosin resin and a plasticizer like wax etc.<br>
As the thermo-sensible hot-melt bonding agents, those essentially<br>
comprising an olefin type resin having poly-a-olefin as a base resin can be<br>
employed as examples.<br>
Thus, many kinds of bonding agents exist, however, considering stability<br>
of application, it is preferred to use a thermo-sensible hot-melt adhesive. As a<br>
thermo-sensible hot-melt adhesive having high application stability, a<br>
melt-blending of 45 - 55m% poly-a-olefin, 10 - 15m% plasticizer, and 35 -<br>
45m% adhesion additive can be used as an example. As to this thermo-sensible<br>
hot-melt bonding agent, 0.1 - 1.0m% oxidation inhibitor and fluorescence<br>
inhibitor may be added thereto.<br>
Such a bonding agent is applied in a line form, a spiral form, a sprayed<br>
form, an O -like form, etc. Moreover, since the interlabial product is inserted<br>
between the labia of a woman and is therefore formed of curved surfaces in<br>
order to create generally a soft atmosphere about the product, a printing<br>
method is suitable when an application method along the curved surfaces is<br>
selected.<br>
When washability is considered, the bonding agent is selected from<br>
polymers in which hydroxide polymers such as<br>
polyoxyethylene-polyoxy-propyrene glycol, etc. are polymerized to<br>
thermo-plastic polyvinyl alcohol resin, starch paste, gelatin, polyester polyol<br>
resin, or mixtures of a pressure sensitive adhesive essentially comprising a<br>
synthetic rubber such as styrene-ethylene/butadiene-styrene block copolymer<br>
(SEBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS),<br>
styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), etc., and water-soluble<br>
materials such as hydrophilic activator, starch paste, gelatin, etc.<br>
[Materials for Surface side sheet]<br>
The surface side sheet is preferred to be water-permeable and to be<br>
selected from materials not stimulative to skin. For example, non-woven fabric<br>
obtained from the manufacturing methods of melt-blown, spunbond, through-air,<br>
point-bond, needle-punch, spun lace, etc. can be used, however, considering a<br>
ratio of contact with the inner wall of labia, it is preferable to singly use<br>
non-woven fabric obtained from the manufacturing methods of spun lace,<br>
melt-blown, needle-punch, etc. or to use some of them combined.<br>
It is also preferable to use single or mixed sheet-like fiber selected from<br>
rayon, acetate, cotton and pulp as natural fiber, or homo-fiber made of a<br>
synthetic resin or conjugated fiber of a sheath-core structure,<br>
hydrophilization-treated synthetic resin, etc. Concretely, spun lace non-woven<br>
fabric etc. can be used, which is obtained by adjusting mixed fiber in proportion<br>
of 10 - 1m% synthetic fiber, 4 - 30m% natural cotton, 60 - 95m% rayon or<br>
acetate to with a specific weight per unit area 20 - 50g/m2, confounding the fiber<br>
itself by means of the water confounding method, drying it, and adjusting the<br>
thickness to 0.1 - 1.0mm.<br>
The reason for mixing the synthetic resin in the above spun lace<br>
non-woven fabric is that the volume and inter-fiber distance can easily be<br>
maintained even when the surface side sheet gets wet from contact with<br>
menstrual blood. Further, the reason for a little low compounding ratio of the<br>
synthetic fiber is that the fiber rigidity is maintained even when the fiber gets wet<br>
with menstrual blood, therefore, compounding more than necessary is in danger<br>
of hurting the inner wall of labia due to the fiber rigidity. Preferred synthetic fiber<br>
is single fiber such as polypropylene, (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET), or fiber formed from graft polymerization of PE and PP,<br>
further, a sheath-core structure of which the core is PP or PET and the sheath is<br>
PE, or an eccentricity type sheath-core structure, or complex synthetic fiber of<br>
side-by-side structure. Moreover, it is also preferable to use the fiber by making<br>
it cloudy by mixing a filler comprising titanium oxide, calcium carbonate, etc. in a<br>
range of 0.5 -1.0m% as necessary.<br>
The fiber length of the fiber used with the above spun lace non-woven<br>
fabric ranges 15 - 60mm when it is natural cotton, and ranges 25 - 51mm when<br>
it is rayon or acetate, and the fineness is to be selected from the range of 1.1 -<br>
6.6dtex. In this case, a preferred point is that use of fiber having a high<br>
specific surface area can increase a contact area with the inner wall of the labia,<br>
and is thereby able to decrease the risk of falling-off the interlabial product from<br>
the labia. For example, it is preferred to use rayon or acetate having a<br>
deformed (non-circular) cross section in which the fiber cross section is<br>
deformed like Y-type or C-type. It is also preferable that when the fiber is<br>
deformed in the cross section if compared to that with the cross section of<br>
perfect circularity, since the fiber is increased in the specific surface area as well<br>
as in the inter-fiber air gap, thereby, the surface side sheet is decreased in<br>
stiffness so that adhesion of the interlabial product to the inner wall of labia is<br>
improved, and that the risk of falling off the interlabial product from labia is<br>
reduced as well as the risk of menstrual blood leakage is.<br>
As another preferred example of the surface side sheet, such spun lace<br>
nonwoven fabric can be used, wherein 15 - 5m% synthetic resin, 50 - 10m%<br>
natural cotton, and further 35 - 85m% rayon or acetate are mixed in these<br>
proportion and adjusted to with a specific weight per unit area 20 - 50g/m2, and<br>
wherein the obtained spun lace is increased in width by about 10 - 80%, and<br>
further stretched in the longitudinal direction by about 10 - 80%. Since this<br>
spun lace nonwoven fabric has a high coarse-fineness gradient in a flat state,<br>
and is once relaxed in intertwining among fiber, this spun lace nonwoven fabric<br>
is the one wherein each fiber, especially, a synthetic resin having high single<br>
yarn stiffness is provided with a spring-back property, and has almost<br>
looped-form fiber projecting on the inner wall side of labia.<br>
Since this looped-form fiber is able to relax frictional resistance in the<br>
shearing direction on the inner wall of labia and the surface of the interlabial<br>
product, the fiber is not only in less danger of hurting the inner wall of labia but<br>
is also able to reduce the flow velocity of menstrual blood flowing on the almost<br>
flat inner wall of labia toward underwear, and this helps the menstrual blood<br>
move to the absorbent body in the interlabial product.<br>
The height and pitch of the loop-like form to be projected can be<br>
controlled by the method wherein the nonwoven fabric is varied in a widening<br>
rate and a drawing rate, or the nonwoven fabric is varied in intertwining force<br>
among the fiber according to the manufacturing method, or a composite<br>
synthetic resin of an eccentricity type sheath-core structure or a side-by-side<br>
structure is used and the percentage crimp of each single yarn of the fiber is<br>
adjusted by utilizing the differences among the thermal contraction ratio of the<br>
fiber.<br>
As still another preferable example of the surface side sheet, a porous<br>
film made by perforation, heat-press, or the like of thermoplastic film, or a<br>
composite sheet of said film and nonwoven fabric can be mentioned. Among<br>
these, the nonwoven fabric part of said composite sheet provided with lots of<br>
nap-raised minute projections by means of water-jet treatment is more<br>
preferable. The surface resistance produced by said projections reduces the<br>
drift velocity of menstrual blood on the surface of the surface side sheet, and<br>
prevents the menstrual blood from flowing down and secures absorption of the<br>
menstrual blood. A height of the projections and a distance between them are<br>
preferred to be in a range of 0.1 - 4mm.<br>
Height and distance smaller than this range cause to decrease the gap<br>
for menstrual blood to flow into the interlabial product, and it becomes difficult to<br>
surely absorb the menstrual blood, while the height and distance exceeding this<br>
range may cause to get down the projections by body pressure or the like when<br>
the interlabial product is inserted, therefore, both cases are not preferable.<br>
Moreover, the surface side sheet may entirely or partly be provided with<br>
holes, and a rate of the hole area is preferred to be in a range of 3 - 30%. A rate<br>
lower than this range has a less effect on menstrual blood moving to the side of<br>
the absorbent body, and a rate higher than this range reduces a ratio contact<br>
between the interlabial product and the inner wall of labia and so the interlabial<br>
product is in danger of falling from between labia, therefore, neither case is not<br>
preferable.<br>
Among these materials, considering liquid movement from the inner<br>
surface of labia, chemical stimulus due to an activator, and adhesion to the<br>
inner wall of labia, such spun lace nonwoven fabric is preferred for the use, as<br>
rayon of 1.1 - 4.4dtex fineness and 7 - 51mm fiber length is laminated 40 - 80%<br>
to total specific weight per unit area on the body surface side; rayon of 1.1 -<br>
4.4dtex fineness and 7 - 51mm fiber length which is 14 - 42% to total specific<br>
weight per unit area and PET which is 6 -18% to the to total specific weight per<br>
unit area are mixed and laminated on the garment surface side; and the two<br>
layers are laminated so that the to total specific weight per unit area of both<br>
layers is 20 - 60g/m2; and then the fiber are intertwined by water jet intertwining<br>
and dried ; and the thickness is adjusted within a range of 0.13 - 0.50mm. In<br>
this case, since the bulkiness can easily be maintained by mixing PET in the<br>
rayon on the garment surface side even when the water-permeable sheet gets<br>
wet, the adhesion to the inner wall of labia can be maintained.<br>
[Materials for Back Side Sheet]<br>
As a material used for the back side sheet, a similar one to those for the<br>
surface side sheet can be used when a water-permeable material is used. In<br>
this case, it is preferable that the interlabial product is used together with a<br>
sanitary napkin (an interlabial product to be used with a sanitary napkin).<br>
Further if non-water permeability material is used for said back side sheet,<br>
the menstrual blood, which is kept in the absorbent body, is prevented from a<br>
leak out of the interlabial product. Furthermore the pad can be comprised of<br>
water vapor permeability material, thereby in wearing the pad, the sweat and<br>
the discomfort can be lowered.<br>
To apply materials of non-water permeability, non-water permeable film<br>
such as a thin filmed synthetic resin of PE, PP and the like, a gas-permeable<br>
film comprised of a synthetic resin filled with inorganic filler and processed with<br>
an extension treatment, a laminated film combined with of a paper nonwoven<br>
fabric and non-water permeable film, a nonwoven fabric of a spun bond or a<br>
spun lace which are treated with a water repellent with a gas-permeable resin<br>
film bonded on a rear surface thereof may be preferably used. Further for a<br>
method of providing ventilation on non-water permeability sheet, it is eligible to<br>
form a capillary having 10 to 30% of pore area ratios and a pore size of 0.1 to<br>
0.6 mm toward the absorbent body.<br>
More concrete example of applying non-water permeability materials, a<br>
film mainly of a low density polyethylene (LDPE) is eligible which is obtained<br>
from a range of a density 0.900 to 0.925g/cm3, with a specific weight per unit<br>
area 15 to 30g/m2, based on the total mass per unit area of the composition.<br>
The flexibility not to hurt a wear feeling is considered. More preferably, during<br>
the pad is attached between labia, non-water permeability sheets are contacted<br>
with each other, with the pad which is used together or with the under wear, to<br>
decrease a fear of dropping the interlabial pad from the labia due to the high<br>
friction, the film is treated an embossing process and the convex upheaval<br>
portion is disposed, thereby it may decrease a ratio contact by less frictional<br>
resistance.<br>
[Absorbent body]<br>
Materials to be used for the absorbent body contained in the interlabial<br>
pad include pulp, chemical pulp, rayon, acetate, natural cotton, water-absorbent<br>
polymer, fibrous water-absorbent polymer, synthetic fiber or a mixture thereof. A<br>
mixture blended as predetermined is made into a sheet by technologies such as<br>
pressure bonding by embossing process, entanglement by needling that are<br>
well known in the art. The sheet may be adjusted by bulking, layering, folding,<br>
etc. as required.<br>
Materials for the sheet may be used in a sheet or powdered. Their types<br>
of usage are not particularly limited.<br>
It is preferable for the absorbent body, although any material can be used<br>
as long as it is capable of absorbing and holding liquid (body fluid), to be bulky,<br>
hard-to-be deformed, less chemically stimulant, and highly flexible to fit into the<br>
labia. Specifically, a nonwoven fabric sheet in which, 50 to 150 g/m2 of pulp<br>
selected from the range of the fiber length of 1 to 10 mm is laminated on the<br>
garment face side and, on the body face side, 150 to 250 g/m2 of a mixture<br>
obtained by mixing 60 to 90 % of rayon with 1.1 to 4.4dtex fineness and 20 to<br>
51 mm fiber length with 40 to 10 % of natural cotton by this mixing ratio is<br>
laminated, which then to be formed into a sheet by dotted emboss processing to<br>
have 2 to 10 mm bulkiness, and more preferable to have 3 to 5 mm bulkiness.<br>
Thereby, liquid can be easily transferred from the body face side to the garment<br>
face side resulting in the improvement of the absorbing and holding capacity.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a mesh spun lace nonwoven fabric of rayon with 1.1<br>
to 4.4dtex fineness and 25 to 51 mm fiber length by a specific weight per unit<br>
area of 15 to 40 g/m2, the liquid transferred from the body face side can be<br>
diffused by the mesh spun lace to be induced to almost all over the region of the<br>
pulp layer. Therefore, more liquid can be effectively absorbed.<br>
[Adhesive portion]<br>
In order to further reduce the danger that the interlabial product may fall<br>
off labia, it is preferable to form an adhesive portion by applying an adhesive<br>
agent on the surface of the surface side sheet for covering these. The interlabial<br>
product is reduced in the danger of falling by adhering the adhering portion in<br>
the neighborhood of the labia of a wearer.<br>
As the arrangements of the adhesive portion, a plane form, a dotted form,<br>
a mesh form, a striped form, or the like can be employed. The position of the<br>
adhesive portion is not to be specifically limited as long as it is possible to fix the<br>
product to the body, however, the adhesive portion is preferred to be arranged<br>
in a striped form of about 1 - 5mm in width in the longitudinal direction,<br>
considering the neighborhood of labia, especially, the existence of pubic hairs in<br>
front of labia.<br>
"Adhesive portion" can be formed by applying an adhesive agent on the<br>
surface side sheet. As the adhesives which can be used in the present invention,<br>
a gel adhesive etc. comprising water-soluble polymer, crosslinking agent,<br>
plasticizer, or water content can be mentioned. To be more concrete, as<br>
examples of the water-soluble polymers, gelatin, polyacrylic sodium, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, carboxyl-methyl-cellulose, etc. can be mentioned; as examples of the<br>
crosslinking agents, water-soluble metal salt such as calcium chloride, and<br>
magnesium sulfate; and as examples of the plasticizers, glycerine, wax, paraffin,<br>
etc. can be used.<br>
In addition to the above, a pressure-sensible hot melt adhesive can also<br>
be used as an adhesive for forming the adhesive portion. The pressure-sensible<br>
hot melt adhesive comprises a synthetic rubber resin such as<br>
styrene-isoprene-styrene block coploymer (SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene<br>
block coploymer (SBS), styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene block coploymer<br>
(SEBS), or styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene block coploymer (SEPS), and<br>
can be obtained by melt-blending therein a tackifier such as turpentine resin and<br>
rosin resin, and a plasticizer such as wax.<br>
Further, silicone resin adhesives can be used. As the silicone resin<br>
adhesive, a mixture composed by blending of crosslinking agents which<br>
essentially comprise silicone resin or fluorocarbon polymer and is metal salt of<br>
platinum, molybdenum, antimony, etc., and a polymerizer such as ester wax,<br>
glycerine, machine oil, etc.<br>
Thus, there are many kinds of adhesives for forming the adhesive portion,<br>
however, considering the stability of application, a pressure sensitive hot melt<br>
adhesive is preferred for the use. As the pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive<br>
with high application stability, a melt-blended mixture of 15 - 25m% SEBS, 15 -<br>
35m% plasticizer, and 40 - 70m% tackifier can be mentioned. An oxidation<br>
inhibitor, a fluorescence inhibitor, etc. may be added to this pressure sensitive<br>
hot melt adhesive within a range of 0.1 -1.0m%.<br>
[Structure of the interlabial pad provided with biodegradability, water<br>
dispersibility and water solubility]<br>
Preferably the interlabial product according to the present invention is<br>
comprised of a material of biodegradability and/or a material of water<br>
dispersibility and/or a material of water-solubility. After using the product<br>
comprised of these materials, it can be disposed into a toilet to flush, thereby<br>
the destruction of the product can be easily and sanitarily achieved and the<br>
garbage in a toilet can be decreased.<br>
In this Specification, "biodegradability" means that a substance is<br>
decomposed into gas such as carbon dioxide or methane, water, and biomass<br>
under anaerobic or aerobic condition according to the natural process under the<br>
existence of bacteria represented by actinomycetes and other microbes, and<br>
also means that the biodegradability (biodegradable rate and biodegradable<br>
degree) of the substance equals to a material naturally generated such as fallen<br>
leaves or a synthetic polymer generally recognized having the same<br>
biodegradability under the same environment. "Water dispersibility" means the<br>
same as water degradability, where there is no effect from the limited amount of<br>
water (menstrual blood) upon use, whereas in conditions of large amounts of<br>
water or under water flow, the fibers are easily dispersible into at least small<br>
pieces which cannot clog the toilet plumbing. "Water solubility" means the<br>
property of not being affected by limited amount of water (menstrual blood)<br>
upon use, but being soluble in large amounts of water or under a flow of water.<br>
[Surface Side Sheet]<br>
As a material for the surface side sheet for providing it with<br>
biodegradability, water dispersibility, and water solbility, spun lace non-woven<br>
fabric can be used, and it is also preferable to use wet spun lace non-woven<br>
fabric of which the fiber length is in a range of 1 - 15mm. As the other materials,<br>
what is called biodegradable resin such as polylactic acid and poly-butylene<br>
succinate can also be used, for example, it is also preferred to use melt-blown<br>
non-woven fabric made from polylactic acid as a raw material and adjusted to<br>
with a specific weight per unit area 20 - 60g/m2, and spun bond non-woven<br>
fabric of which the specific weight per unit area is in a range of 15 - 30g/m2 and<br>
the fineness is adjusted to 1.1 - 3.3dtex. As the other materials, a dissolved fiber<br>
from fiber composites by adjusting so-called tow in a range of 10 - 80g/ m2may<br>
be used. The tow may include acetate, rayon, synthetic resin by itself or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
[Absorbent body]<br>
Same materials having water permeability for the cover sheet can be<br>
used for materials of the absorbent body to apply biodegradability, water<br>
dispersibility and water solubility. Further it is possible to independently use the<br>
absorbent materials such as alginic acid soda, starch, carboxymethylcelluloce<br>
and the like, particle-typed or fiber-typed super absorbent polymer, or to use a<br>
form by mixing these materials with same materials for the cover sheet,<br>
In respect of the structure of the absorbent body, the wood pulp and the<br>
like are eligible, that is laminated to with a specific weight per unit area 150 to<br>
500g/m2 to enclose into tissue and is adjusted the thickness from 2 to 10mm by<br>
a press device. It is possible to improve the absorption capacity or keeping<br>
ability of the menstrual blood by mixing absorbent body such as starch and the<br>
like in a ratio from 5 to 30g/m2.<br>
[Back Side Sheet]<br>
As the materials for the back side sheet which can be provided with<br>
biodegradability, water dispersibility, and water solubility, and which is also<br>
water impermeable, laminated paper etc. can be mentioned, which laminates a<br>
film made from what is called biodegradable resin such as a polyvinyl alcohol<br>
(PVA) film, a film sheet provided with water-repelling treatment with silicone<br>
resin etc. on a part or the whole of one side or both sides of PVA film, a PVA film<br>
mixed with silicone resin, a starch film, polylactic acid or poly-butylene succinate,<br>
etc., and tissue etc. These materials may be mixed with inorganic pigments in<br>
a range of 0.1 - 5 % to be colored as appropriate.<br>
As a specific constitution of a water-impermeable back side sheet, for<br>
example, laminated paper can be mentioned, which is formed by laminating a<br>
film comprising polylactic acid, and 10 - 20µm thick tissue with a specific<br>
weight per unit area in a range of 15 - 20g/m2 within a range of 5 - 40%<br>
lamination area ratio. It is preferable that such laminated paper is able to<br>
maintain water-impermeable property when the interlabial product gets wet, and<br>
does not charge a too heavy burden to a septic tank.<br>
[Bonding Method]<br>
Further for a bonding method of applying biodegradability, water<br>
dispersibility, water solubility, a bonding method such as adhesion by polyvinyl<br>
alcohol and the like having water solubility or water swelling, a heat sealing, or a<br>
bonding by a hydrogen bonding, and the like can be used individually or can be<br>
used in a combination of them adequately.<br>
[Manufacturing Method]<br>
The interlabial product constituted of such materials in accordance with<br>
the present invention can be manufactured by the following manufacturing<br>
method comprising:<br>
a. a process for forming the shape of the absorbent body into a<br>
predetermined form,<br>
b. a process for laminating the surface side sheet wider than the<br>
absorbent body on the body surface side of the absorbent body, and<br>
laminating the back side sheet wider than the absorbent body on the<br>
garment side of the absorbent body,<br>
c. a process for bonding the surface side sheet and the back side<br>
sheet with each other on the periphery of the absorbent body, to form an<br>
absorbing layer,<br>
d. a process for folding the absorbing layer along the longitudinal<br>
center line in the lateral direction so that both side edge portions of the back<br>
side sheet are meet each other,<br>
e. a process for partly bonding the overlapping peripheral portions,<br>
and<br>
f. a process for forming the outer contour by cutting.<br>
As to the process a, the absorbent body is cut into the prescribed form by<br>
being made to pass between a roll cutter provided with a cemented carbide<br>
edge and an anvil serving as a receiving roller.<br>
Peripherals necessary for cutting the absorbent body into a shape are<br>
sucked to the side of the anvil roll provided with suction holes and are then<br>
supplied to a pipe for dust collection and collected.<br>
Or, this may be such a process as forms the shape of the absorbent body<br>
by sucking and accumulating the pulverized particles such as pulps on meshes<br>
forming a prescribed shape and transcribing them on a conveyor belt with<br>
suction.<br>
As to the process b, this may be provided with a process for applying an<br>
adhesive between the absorbent body and the surface side sheet, and the<br>
absorbent body and the back side sheet. For example, when a hot-melt type<br>
adhesive is applied, the hot melt melted by heating in a temperature range of<br>
140 - 180deg is press-fed into a supply hose by a gear pump and fed into a<br>
manifold for uniformalizing the flow rate distribution of the hot melt, and then a<br>
press-output rate is adjusted to 3 - 50g/m2 a specific weight per unit area and<br>
pressed out of a nozzle.<br>
As to the process c, the absorbent layer is made to pass between an<br>
embossing roller on which a press-pattern is stamped and the anvil roller<br>
serving as a receiving roller, heating the absorbent layer at a temperature range<br>
of 70 - 160deg, and pressing on it at a pressure rage of 1 - 3MPa, to bond the<br>
peripheral portions. When the peripheral portions are bonded with a hot-melt<br>
type adhesive, or they are bonded by applying the hot-melt type adhesive using<br>
heat-sealing together, the adhesive is applied according to the method of the<br>
process b.<br>
As to the process d, the absorbing layer obtained by the process c is<br>
folded in the lateral direction so that the side edges of the back side sheet are<br>
faced to each other by the sailor plates arranged on the right and left each so as<br>
to be gradually narrower in the travelling direction. In order to fold the absorbing<br>
layer almost along the longitudinal center line, an inducing line for folding it by<br>
applying pressure ranging 0.5 - 1MPa onto a disk-like roller from the side of the<br>
back side sheet may be provided. Moreover, the inducing line for folding may be<br>
provided on the absorbent body. The inducing line is a metal mold roller with a<br>
0.3 - 2mm tip width, and is selected from a line form, a dashed line form, etc.<br>
As to the process e, the folded absorbing layer is made to pass between<br>
the embossing roller stamped with the press-pattern thereon and the anvil roller<br>
serving as the receiving roller and thereby the peripheral portions are bonded<br>
by being pressurized at a range of 1 - 3MPa at a temperature ranging 70 -<br>
160deg. There is no restriction for the embossing pattern, but a staggered<br>
pattern of a 2.5mm width, a 0.5mm2 embossing area is intended at 0.5mm<br>
intervals (in this embodiment).<br>
As to the process f, the absorbent layer is made to pass between the roll<br>
cutter provided with the cemented carbide edge and the anvil roller, and the<br>
product is cut and formed into the outline in the folded state. The roll cutter is<br>
pressurized at a range of 0.5 - 2MPa. The surplus disposal loss is sucked and<br>
supplied into the dust collection piping and collected.<br>
[Individual Wrapping Body]<br>
Fig.11 illustrates a top view of one embodiment of the individual wrapping<br>
body. The wrapping body 70 is formed lengthwise, and an unwrapped opening<br>
72 is arranged so as to be opened in the lateral direction. The individual<br>
wrapping body 70 is formed by turning up both end portions of the wrapping<br>
sheet, and bonding the upper and lower end edge 74a, 74b of the wrapping<br>
sheet together to be strippable from each other. A tab tape 76 is attached on the<br>
overlapping part of the wrapping sheet in the center. The strippable bonding can<br>
be achieved by means of known techniques such as press-force by<br>
heat-embossing, and intertwining by male and female embossing.<br>
Fig.12 illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along the arrowed line C-C<br>
of Fig.11. The wrapping sheet is folded with the end portion 78 thereof lower<br>
side and the end portion 77 thereof upper side, and the tab tape 76 is attached<br>
on the unwrapped portion 72. The interlabial product is enclosed in the folded<br>
state so that the back side sheet 13 is faced to each other almost along the<br>
longitudinal center line. A wearer picks up the tab tape 76, and carries out a<br>
work for taking out the interlabial product while breaking the strippable bonded<br>
portions 74a, 74b of the wrapping sheet.<br>
Fig.13 illustrates a perspective cross-sectional view of the state in which<br>
the wearer has opened the one end portion 77 of the wrapping sheet. The<br>
interlabial product is arranged so that the finger insertion opening 26 of the<br>
cylindrical portion 20 is positioned to face the unwrapped opening 71 of said<br>
individual wrapping body 70. The interlabial product is enclosed being folded so<br>
that the flap pieces 22a, 22b are opened when the interlabial product is<br>
unsealed. It becomes possible for the wearer to watch the cylindrical portion 20<br>
of the enclosed interlabial product immediately when the product is unsealed,<br>
and to speedily secure the interlabial product by a finger.<br>
In that case, the interlabial product is still enclosed in the other end<br>
portion 78 of the interlabial product and can be maintained via the wrapping<br>
sheet, so the surface side sheet 11 of the interlabial product does not come into<br>
contact with the finger, therefore, the interlabial product can be handled<br>
sanitarily also when it is taken out.<br>
Moreover, since the wearer is induced into the state in which she holds<br>
the end portion 78 of the individual wrapping body enclosing the interlabial<br>
product by one hand at the time of unsealing it, such a trouble as the interlabial<br>
product may fall off the wrapping body can be prevented. The wearer picks up<br>
the tab tape by the other hand to open the end portion 77.<br>
It is preferable that the unwapped opening 71 of the individual wrapping<br>
body is faced to the opposite side of the folded part 19 of the interlabial product.<br>
If the unwrapped opening 71 is faced to the same side of the folded part, the<br>
wearer observes the folded part of the interlabial product at the time of<br>
unsealing it, she has to turn the interlabial product enclosed in the wrapping<br>
body to find out the finger insertion portion formed on the rear surface side of<br>
the interlabial product, therefore, this makes the insertion operation complex<br>
and lacks in smooth insertion operation.<br>
The wrapping material used for the wrapping sheet is chosen from a<br>
single use or lamination of tissue, non-woven fabric, film, etc., and is not to be<br>
restricted. To be specific, a film essentially comprising low-density polyethylene<br>
(LDPE) adjusted to a specific weight per unit area ranging 15 - 30g/m2 is used<br>
in general. Such a constitution is more preferable, as menstrual blood adhering<br>
to labia does not come into contact with the finger inserted in the sack at the<br>
time of insertion, lamination of non-woven fabric and a film can be used for the<br>
purpose. To be more concrete, a complex obtained by laminating a film<br>
essentially comprising LDPE adjusted to a specific weight per unit area ranging<br>
5 - 20g/m2 on one side of complex non-woven fabric composed of spun bond,<br>
melt-blown and spun bond of 6 - 10gsm, 5 - 20gsm and 6 - 10gsm by weight,<br>
respectively, can be used.<br>
Moreover, when water washability is considered, the wrapping materials<br>
can be obtained from non-woven fabric or a film of biodegradable polylactic acid,<br>
poly-butylene succinate, polylactic acid, poly-isocyanate, starch, etc.;<br>
water-soluble materials can be obtained from a film essentially comprising of<br>
poly-vinyl alcohol; and toilet paper can also be used. To be concrete, lamination<br>
of a film of poly-isocyanate adjusted to a specific weight per unit area ranging 5<br>
- 10g/m2 and water-soluble paper to be adjusted to a specific weight per unit<br>
area ranging 15 - 30g/m2 can be mentioned.<br>
Since it becomes possible to re-enclose the interlabial product in the<br>
individual wrapping body after use by composing both of the individual wrapping<br>
body and interlabial product of water-soluble materials, the individual wrapping<br>
body and the interlabial product can be disposed of in a flushing toilet at the<br>
same time, and this facilitates disposal work.<br>
[Method for Manufacturing Individual Wrapping Body]<br>
The individual wrapping body for enclosing the interlabial product<br>
constituted as the above can be manufactured by the following manufacturing<br>
method provided with the following processes, that is;<br>
a) a process for arranging the wrapping sheet at least on one<br>
side of either the upper surface or the lower surface to the transport<br>
direction of the interlabial product,<br>
b) a process for enclosing the interlabial product in the<br>
wrapping sheet by folding the end portion 78 of the wrapping sheet<br>
from the folding part 19 side of the interlabial product toward the<br>
peripheral bonding portion side of the interlabial product, then folding<br>
up one end portion 77 of the wrapping sheet from the peripheral<br>
bonding portion of the interlabial product toward the folding part 19 of<br>
the interlabial product, and overlapping the wrapping sheet with each<br>
other,<br>
c) a process for bonding the upper and lower end edges 74a,<br>
74b of the wrapping sheet together, and<br>
d) a process for cutting the wrapping sheet into the<br>
prescribed dimensions.<br>
In the process a), the wrapping sheet wider than the interlabial product is<br>
overlaid on the interlabial product.<br>
In the process b), the interlabial product is enclosed in the wrapping<br>
sheet by folding one side 78 of the wrapping sheet from the folding part 19 side<br>
of the interlabial product toward the peripheral bonding portion side of the<br>
interlabial product, then folding up one side of the wrapping sheet from the<br>
peripheral bonding portion of the interlabial product toward the folding part 19 of<br>
the interlabial product, and overlapping the wrapping sheet with each other.<br>
This method is to prevent such a mis-operation as a wearer has to open<br>
the wrapping sheet from the folded part of the interlabial product, by folding the<br>
wrapping sheet from the folded part 19 side of the interlabial product. Further,<br>
the folding width has such a dimension as is sufficiently able to cover the<br>
widthwise dimension of the interlabial product. Thus, it is possible to prevent a<br>
wearer's finger from touching the surface side sheet when she takes the<br>
interlabial product out of the wrapping body.<br>
The wrapping sheet is folded by being guided from the folding part side of<br>
the interlabial product by the sailor plates arranged on the right and left each so<br>
as to be gradually narrower in the travelling direction, and is folded one by one<br>
to enclose the interlabial product.<br>
In the process c), the wrapping sheet enclosing the interlabial product<br>
therein is made to pass between the embossing roller stamped with the<br>
press-pattern thereon and the anvil roller serving as the receiving roller, and the<br>
upper and lower end edges 74a, 74b of the wrapping sheet are bonded together<br>
by being pressurized at a range of 1 - 2MPa at a temperature of 60 - 130deg.<br>
Although the embossing pattern is not to be restricted, it may be provided with a<br>
3 - 10mm bonding length, and a lattice pattern with a 0.5mm2 embossing area<br>
and a 1.0mm pitch may be used.<br>
This process may be provided with a step for affixing a tab tape to stride<br>
over the overlapping part of the wrapping sheet. Or, the overlapping part may<br>
be coated with an adhesive for bonding the part. Such an arrangement makes it<br>
possible for a wearer to visually check the position of the unsealing part.<br>
Moreover, the arrangement prevents the entry of dust and dirt during storage<br>
and is sanitary.<br>
In the process d), the wrapping sheet is made to pass between the roll<br>
cutter provided with a cemented carbide edge and the anvil roller, and the<br>
individual wrapping body is formed by cutting off the upper later sheet. The roll<br>
cutter is pressurized at 0.5 - 2MPa. The surplus parts to be disposed of are<br>
sucked and supplied into the dust collection piping for collection. Both of the<br>
front and back sides of the individual wrapping body may be cut into curved<br>
surfaces.<br>
[Another Embodiment of Individual Wrapping Body]<br>
Another embodiment according to the present invention is described<br>
here.<br>
Fig.14 is a top view outline of the individual wrapping body 80 in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Fig.15 is a<br>
cross-sectional schematic taken along the arrowed line D-D of Fig.14. In the<br>
embodiment in Fig.14, the three sides 82 of the individual wrapping body are<br>
bonded to be strippable, to enclose the interlabial product inside. The tab 84 is a<br>
guide for the unsealing part. In Fig.15, the interlabial product is folded in two in<br>
the lateral direction along the longitudinal center line. The figure illustrates the<br>
finger insertion opening of the interlabial product arranged on the side of the<br>
unsealing part 81 of the individual wrapping body.<br>
As shown in Fig.14, the interlabial product may be enclosed by folding a<br>
single wrapping sheet in half. Or, the interlabial product may be enclosed by<br>
superposing two wrapping sheets of the same shape on each other and<br>
bonding their four sides together so as to be strippable.<br>
As shown in Fig.15, the interlabial product is placed so that the finger<br>
insertion opening of the cylindrical portion of the interlabial product is positioned<br>
to face the unsealing hole 81 of said individual wrapping body 80.<br>
Such a structure makes it possible for a wearer to visually check the<br>
finger insertion portion, namely, the cylindrical portion at the same time when<br>
she unseals the individual wrapping body.<br>
Here, the tab is formed in a shape of a picking tab 84 on the individual<br>
wrapping body so that a wearer can visually check the position of the<br>
unsealing part, however, the tab shape is not to be restricted to this<br>
embodiment.<br>
Fig.16 is a plane schematic of the individual wrapping body 90 in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to the embodiment shown in Fig.16, in addition to the heat<br>
sealing 92, the unsealing part may be opened by breaking the perforations 94<br>
arranged inside of the heat sealing 92.<br>
The individual wrapping body is so structured that the wearer can visually<br>
check the finger insertion portion of the interlabial product through the broken<br>
opening of the perforations, and the edge portions of the three sides are bonded<br>
by heat sealing, and the perforations are provided inside of the edges.<br>
As to the perforations, the tear part length is within a range of 0.5 - 5mm,<br>
and the width is not wider than 3mm considering the prevention of the entry of<br>
dust and dirt.<br>
The position of the dashed line is preferred to start from one lengthwise<br>
side edge end of the individual wrapping sheet, and it does not matter whether<br>
the line is connected up to the other edge end or it is arranged from one edge<br>
end up to about the middle point. The breaking strength is within a range of 0.2<br>
- 3.0N/25mm in the lateral direction, and more preferably, 0.3 - 1.5N/25mm<br>
(the breaking strength of the perforations, speed; 100mm/min). In this case, the<br>
perforations make an unwrapped opening, therefore, the heat-sealing part 92 is<br>
preferred to be increased in the bonding strength so as not to be strippable, to<br>
avoid misunderstanding the operation.<br>
Fig.17 is a plane schematic showing an embodiment in which the<br>
interlabial product is held between two wrapping sheets and the four sides are<br>
bonded by heat sealing 102, and then the three sides are provided with the<br>
perforations 104.<br>
With such an arrangement in both Fig.16 and Fig.17, a wearer can<br>
visually check the finger insertion portion as soon as she breaks the<br>
perforations. Moreover, since the interlabial product is grasped by the wearer's<br>
hand via the wrapping sheet, the insertion operation is sanitarily performed<br>
without contact between the surface side sheet of the interlabial sheet and the<br>
finger.<br>
In both embodiments shown in Fig.16 and Fig.17, the individual wrapping<br>
body may be provided with a print (for example, an arrow head), different cut<br>
forms in the front and rear in the neighborhood of the beginning of the<br>
perforations (for example, the edge end is cut round), or the individual wrapping<br>
body made asymmetric in the longitudinal direction, etc., so as to visually<br>
suggest the wearer of the perforations.<br>
When the individual wrapping body is made asymmetric in the<br>
longitudinal direction, by forming the individual wrapping body so that it<br>
gradually becomes wider toward one side end portion, making it face in the<br>
widening direction, making the finger insertion opening of the finger insertion<br>
portion face in the narrowing direction, and positioning the finger insertion<br>
portion to face in the widening direction, the wearer will naturally grasp it by<br>
hand on the narrower part, the finger insertion is directed toward the wearer at<br>
the same time as the wrapping body is opened.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Since the interlabial product of the present invention is provided with a<br>
cylindrical portion formed thereon in which a finger can be inserted, the finger<br>
can be secured until the interlabial product is taken out and inserted in labia,<br>
and the longitudinal direction of the interlabial product is naturally guided to the<br>
direction of the labia, and a wearer can insert the interlabial product while<br>
confirming the insertion point by securing the product with the ball of the finger<br>
faced to the side of the back side sheet.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. An interlabial pad comprising: a water-permeable surface side sheet; a back<br>
side sheet; an absorbent body for absorbing body fluid disposed between the surface<br>
side sheet and the back side sheet; and a portion for forming a longitudinally<br>
elongated open space for inserting a finger therein, wherein said open space is formed<br>
inside the interlabial pad to extend from one end to another end of the interlabial pad<br>
along the longitudinal direction by attaching longitudinally opposing peripheral edges<br>
of the back side sheet in the longitudinal direction from approximately the middle of<br>
the peripheral edges towards one end of the peripheral edges, said open space<br>
becomes smaller toward the end of the peripheral edges, and a part of the peripheral<br>
edges of the back side sheet away from the end of the peripheral edges is opened to<br>
