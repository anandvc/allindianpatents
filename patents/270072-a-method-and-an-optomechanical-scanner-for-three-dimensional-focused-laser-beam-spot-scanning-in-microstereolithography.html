PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and an optomechanical scanner for three dimensional focused laser beam spot scanning.<br>
This invention relates particularly to a method and an optomechanical scanner for three dimensional focused laser beam spot scanning in microstereolithography for fabrication of microstructures like micromechanisms, microdevices, microchannels or microcatheters. The method and scanner of the invention can be also advantageously used for other applications like laser cutting or etching, near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) or con-focal microscopy. The use areas of the method and scanner of the invention are not, however, limited to the above applications.<br>
PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION<br>
Microstereolithography for fabrication of microstructures like micromechanisms, microdevices, microchannels or microcatheters comprises on axis or off axis scanning of a liquid resin with a focused laser beam spot so as to achieve pinpoint photopolymerization of the resin. The scanned portion of the resin is allowed to cure or solidify and form the microstructures. The dimensional accuracy and performance characteristics of the microstructures will depend upon the focused laser beam spot characteristics ie diameter or size and intensity profile of the laser beam spot and also properties of the resin. Galvanomirror scanner used for microstereolithography comprises a laser beam generating source, a focusing lens and a pair of mirrors having their reflective surfaces facing each other and inclined  at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam.   The beam<br>
source and focusing lens positions are fixed and the lens is located aligned with the beam source<br>
2<br><br>
such that the optic axis of the beam and the lens axis are coaxial. One mirror is located tiltably about the X-axis in the horizontal plane and the other mirror is located tiltably about the Y-axis in the horizontal plane. The focused laser beam is allowed to fall on one mirror and reflect onto the other mirror. The laser beam is further reflected from the other mirror onto the liquid resin contained in a resin tank. The mirrors are tilted about the XY-axes so as to carry out on axis scanning of the resin surface by the laser beam spot along and across the resin surface in the XY-axes. Due to tilting of the mirrors, the focal plane of the laser beam spot ie the path of the laser beam spot over the entire scan area on the liquid resin surface is not plane towards the end of the scan length and is spherical, whereas the liquid resin surface is plane. Therefore, the focal plane of the laser beam spot does not coincide or match with the resin surface over the entire scan area and defocusing of the laser beam spot takes place during scanning. Defocusing leads to increase in the beam spot size and decrease in the intensity of the beam spot towards the end of the scan length. As a result, the laser beam spot characteristics ie size and intensity profile of the laser beam spot change thereby reducing the dimensional accuracy and performance characteristics of the microstructures formed. Photoreactor tank scanner and Off-axis lens scanner are also used for microstereolithography. Both these scanners comprise a laser beam generating source, a focusing lens and a resin tank containing the liquid resin. In the case of a photoreactor tank scanner, the lens is stationary and the beam axis and the lens axis are coaxial. The resin tank is moved in the XY-axes in the horizontal plane to carry out on axis scanning of the resin by the laser beam spot. As the laser beam spot is directly focused on the resin surface by the lens and the lens position is fixed, the focal plane of the lens coincides with the resin surface over the entire scan area. Therefore, there is no variation in the beam spot characteristics and the dimensional accuracy and performance characteristics of the microstructures produced are maintained. Due to movement of the resin tank, waves are, however, formed on the liquid resin<br>
3<br><br>
surface. In order to avoid wavy microstructures being formed due to the waves, it is necessary to allow the liquid resin to settle prior to scanning. As a result overall fabrication time is increased and productivity is reuced. In the case of the Off-axis lens scanner, the resin tank is stationary and the focusing lens is moved in the XY-axes in the horizontal plane to carry out the scanning of the resin surface by the laser beam spot. The laser beam spot is directly focused on the resin surface but the lens is moved because of which there will be offset between the lens axis and beam axis towards the end of the scan length. Off-axis lens scanning, especially large off-axis scanning may increase the beam spot size towards the end of the scan length and reduce the dimensional accuracy and performance characteristics of the microstructures. Off axis scanning is, however, useful where increased polymerization is desired at specific locations in the liquid resin. Increased beam spot size will give increased polymerization so as to increase the fabrication speed. Scanning across the depth of the liquid resin ie along the Z-axis or in the vertical plane is carried out by the above scanners by moving the resin tank up and down. Due to the up and down movement of the resin tank, there will be disturbances in the liquid resin. In order to avoid dimensional inaccuracies in the microstructures due to such disturbances it is necessary to allow the liquid resin to settle prior to scanning. This will also increase the overall fabrication time and reduce productivity.<br>

The optomechanical scanner 1 as illustrated in Figs 1 to 8 of the accompanying drawings<br>
comprises a first mirror Ml held in a first mirror holder 2 and mounted on a first translation cum<br>
mount assembly 3 which in turn is mounted on an optical table 4. As illustrated in detail in Fig<br>
4, the first translation cum mount assembly 3 comprises a first slidable member 5 linearly<br>
slidably held in a first channel member 6 which is mounted on one limb 7a of an L-shaped<br>
bracket 7.   The limb 7a of the L-shaped bracket 7 is mounted on the optical table.   8 is a first<br>
reversible motor mounted on the limb 7a of the L-shaped bracket 7 with its shaft 9 in thread<br>
engagement with one end of the first slidable member 5.   10 is a first vertical member mounted<br>
on the first slidable member 5.  11 is a first stationary member horizontally disposed and fixed to<br>
the first vertical member 10.   The stationary member 11 is formed with a rectangular stepped<br>
portion 12.  13 is a first rectangular member held on the stepped portion 12 of the first stationary<br>
member 11 spring tensioned against the stepped portion 12 by tension springs 14a.    The<br>
rectangular member 13 is pivoted on stepped portion 12 at one corner thereof by pivot marked<br>
14b. A pair of first screws 15 pass through a pair of diagonally opposite corners of the stepped<br>
portion 12 of the stationary member 11 in thread engagement therewith. The edges of screws 15<br>
abut against a pair of diagonally opposite corners of rectangular member 13 different from the<br>
pivoted corner thereof.  Mirror Ml is located on rectangular member 13 and is disposed in the<br>
path of a laser beam (not marked) from a laser beam generating source 16 mounted on the optical<br>
table through the legs 17 thereof (Fig 1). The reflective surface of mirror Ml is inclined at 45° to<br>
the optic axis of the laser beam. Mirror Ml is linearly movable in the horizontal plane along the<br>
13<br><br>
path of the laser beam from the laser beam generating source ie along the Y-axis by moving slidable member 5 back and forth in channel member 6 by rotating the motor shaft 9 in opposite directions by operation of the motor 8. As the motor shaft is in thread engagement with one end of slidable member 5, the slidable member converts the rotational movement of the motor shaft in opposite directions into back and forth linear displacements of mirror Ml. Mirror Ml is angularly adjusted by screws 15 which are in thread engagement with the stepped portion 12 of stationary member 11 and abutting against the rectangular member 13. On tightening and loosening the screws one after the other against the rectangular member 13 the rectangular member tilts in opposite directions in the vertical plane about the pivot 14b so as to adjust the reflective surface of mirror Ml at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam falling on it. M2 is a second mirror mounted on a second translation cum mount assembly 18. Mirror M2 is located above mirror Ml in spaced apart relationship with mirror Ml with the reflective surface of mirror M2 facing the reflective surface of mirror Ml and inclined at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam reflected from mirror Ml.

The edges of screws 29 abut against a pair of diagonally opposite corners of rectangular member 27 different from the pivoted corner thereof. Mirror M2 is held in a second mirror holder 30 and mounted on rectangular member 27. Linear movements of mirror M2 in the vertical plane along the path of the laser beam reflected from mirror Ml is carried out by moving the slidable member 19 up and down by operating the reversible motor 21 whose shaft 22 is in thread engagement with one end of slidable member 19. On rotating the motor shaft 22 in one direction, slidable member 19 moves up along with the mirror M2 and the other components parts fixed thereto.

On tightening and loosening the screws one after the other against the rectangular surface 42a of the mirror support 42, the mirror holder 40 tilts in opposite directions in the vertical plane about the pivots 43 so as to adjust the reflective surface of mirror M3 at 45° with respect to the optic axis of the laser beam falling on it. 45 is a second double flexure manipulator located within the translation stage 34 of manipulator 33 (Figs 1, 2 and 3).

As shown in detail in Fig 7, M4 is a fourth mirror held in a rectangular mirror holder 52 which is held against the rectangular surface 53a of a fourth mirror support 53 spring biased against the rectangular surface 53a by tension springs 54a. Mirror holder 52 is pivoted on rectangular surface 53a at one corner thereof by pivot 54b. A pair of fourth screws 55 pass through a pair of corners of the mirror holder 52 different from pivoted corner thereof in thread engagement therewith.    The edges of screws 55 abut against the<br>
16<br><br>
corresponding corners of the rectangular surface 53a of the mirror support 53. Mirror M4 is located spaced apart from M3 with the reflective surface of mirror M4 facing the reflective surface of mirror M3 and inclined at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam reflected from mirror M3. Mirror M4 is angularly adjusted by screws 55 which are in thread engagement with the mirror holder 52 and abutting against the rectangular surface 53a of mirror support 53. On tightening and loosening the screws one after the other against the rectangular surface 53a of mirror support 53, the mirror holder tilts in opposite directions in the vertical plane about the pivot 54b so as to adjust the reflective surface of mirror M4 at 45° with respect to the optic axis of the laser beam falling on it. As further shown in Fig 7, a focusing lens L is held at the center of a spiral flexure manipulator 56 which in turn is held at the center of a support plate 57.

The double flexure manipulator 33 and 45 and spiral flexure manipulator 56 are of known construction and function in known manner. As shown in Fig 8, 62 is a control unit comprising a computer 63 connected to reversible motors 8 and 21 and to the coils 37, 49 and 60 of voice coil motors 36, 48 and 59 respectively through a microcontroller 64 and current amplifiers65, 66, 67, 68 and 69 respectively.

17<br><br>
microcontroller. The position sensors may be, for instance, optical encoders. Position sensor 72 is held in a holder 75 which in turn is held by screws 76 (Fig 3). The screws 76 are supported in the support frame 31a in thread engagement therewith. The sensor holder 75 is held compressed by compression springs 77 disposed over the screws 76 and held compressd between the sensor holder 75 and the support frame 31a. The position of sensor 72 and sensor holder 75 is adjusted by increasing or reducing the compressive force of compression springs 77 by turning the screws 76 in opposite directions in the support frame 31a. Position sensor 73 is held in a holder 78 which in turn is held by screws 79 (Fig 3). The screws 79 are supported in the translation stage 46 of manipulator 45 in thread engagement therewith. The sensor holder 78 is held compressed by compression springs 80 disposed over the screws 79 and held compressed between the sensor holder 78 and translation stage 46. The position of sensor 73 and sensor holder 78 is adjusted by increasing or reducing the compressive force of compression springs 80 by turning screws 79 in opposite directions in the translation stage 46. Based on input signals received from position sensor 70, the computer 63 drives the motor 8 through the microcontroller 64 to move mirror Ml linearly along the Y-axis in the horizontal plane ie along the path of the laser beam from the laser beam source 16. Similarly based on input signals received from position sensor 71, the computer 63 drives the motor 21 through the microcontroller 64 to move mirror M2 linearly along the Z-axis in the vertical plane ie along the path of the laser beam reflected from mirror Ml. Manipulator 33 with mirror M3 mounted on the translation stage 34 thereof and with manipulator 45 located within the translation stage 34 of manipulator 33 and fixed to the translation stage 34 and having mirror M4 and lens L mounted on the translation stage 46 of manipulator 45 is disposed for movement along the X-axis in the horizontal plane ie along the path of the laser beam reflected from mirror M2. Based on input signals received from position sensor 72, the computer 63 drives the linear voice coil motor 36 through the microcontroller 64<br>
18<br><br>
to move the translation stage 34 of manipulator 33 and with it mirror M3 and translation stage 46 of manipulator 45 and mirror M4 and lens L mounted on it. On energizing the coil 37 of motor 36 with a DC supply, a magnetic field is created around the coil 37 and due to the electromagnetic force created by the magnetic field the coil 37 moves in the core 38 of motor 36 back and forth depending upon the direction of flow of the DC supply in the coil 37. As a result the translation stage 34 of manipulator 33, along with the mirrors M3 and M4 and lens L together moves along the X-axis. Manipulator 45 with mirror M4 and lens L mounted on the translation stage 46 thereof, is disposed for movement along the Y-axis ie along the path of the laser beam reflected from mirror M3. Based on input signals received from position sensor 73, the computer 63 drives the linear voice coil motor 48 through the microcontroller 64 to move the translation stage 48 of manipulator 45 and with it mirror M4 and lens L together. On energizing the coil 49 of motor 48 with a DC supply, a magnetic field is created around the coil 49 and due to the electromagnetic force created by the magnetic field the coil 49 moves in the core 50 of the motor 48 back and forth depending upon the direction of flow of the DC supply in the coil 49. As a result, the translation stage 46 of manipulator 45, along with mirror M4 and lens L moves together along the Y-axis. Linear movements of the translation stages 34 and 46 of manipulators 33 and 45 are facilitated by the flexibility and bending pattern of the respective flexural beams about the attachment points thereof. Lens L is disposed for movement along the Z-axis in the vertical plane ie perpendicular to the path of the laser beam reflected from mirror M4. Based on input signals received from position sensor 74, the computer 63 drives the linear voice coil motor 59 through the microcontroller 64 to move the lens L. On energizing the coil 60 of motor 59 with a DC supply, a magnetic field is created around the coil 60 and due to the electromagnetic force created by the magnetic field the coil 60 moves in the core 61 of motor 59 back and forth depending upon the direction of flow of the DC supply.    The elasticity or<br>
19<br><br>
flexibility of the spiral flexural manipulator 56 allows up and down movement of the coil 60 along with the lens along the Z-axis. 81 is a liquid resin contained in a resin tank 82 located on a platform 83 which in turn is located on the optical table 4. The resin tank is disposed on the optical table below the lens L. Prior to scanning, mirrors Ml, M2, M3 and M4 are angularly adjusted so as to allow the mirrors to be inclined at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam. Depending on whether on-axis or off-axis scanning is to be carried out, mirrors M2 and M3 are linearly adjusted in the horizontal plane and vertical plane, along the Y-axis and Z-axis respectively to align or offset the optic axis of the laser beam with the lens axis. On-axis laser beam spot scanning along the X-axis ie along the surface of the resin in the horizontal plane is carried out by moving mirrors M3 and M4 and lens L together along the X-axis. On-axis laser beam spot scanning along the Y-axis ie across the surface of the resin in the horizontal plane is carried out by moving mirror M4 and lens L together along the Y-axis. On-axis laser beam spot scanning along the Z-axis ie across the depth of the resin in the vertical plane is carried out by moving lens L along the Z-axis. Off-axis scanning is carried by moving mirror Ml along Y-axis to carryout X-axis scanning, moving mirror M2 along Z-axis to carry out Y-axis scanning and moving lens L along Z-axis to carry out Z-axis scanning. During both on-axis and off-axis scanning, the resin tank remains stationary and the laser beam spot travels along the various axes linearly in a straight line. During on-axis scanning the laser beam axis and lens axis are also aligned over the entire scanning area. Therefore, the microstructures fabricated by on-axis scanning will have dimensional accuracy and excellent performance characteristics. Off axis scanning will be useful at locations where bulk of the resin is to be polymerized and resolution is not important. On axis scanning can be carried out at specific locations where small volumes of the resin are to be polymerized like the edges. Combined on-axis and off axis scanning can be advantageously used to improve the speed of fabrication with high resolution. According to the<br>
20<br><br>
invention on- or off-axis scanning of the resin can be carried out by the laser beam spot along all the three XYZ-axes easily and conveniently. The fabrication time is reduced and productivity is increased and the scanning is efficient and economical. The invention has the flexibility to carry out on-axis scanning so as to fabricate microstructures with dimensional accuracy and excellent performance characteristics or to carry out off-axis scanning to fabricate microstructures requiring increased polymerization at certain locations with increased fabrication speed. Also both on- and off-axis scanning can be advantageously combined. Since the tank containing the liquid resin is not disturbed during scanning, formation of wavy microstructures is also eliminated. The invention is basically in carrying out scanning along all the three axes without disturbing the resin tank and without causing any deviation in the linear movements of the mirrors and lens along the three axes. The configuration and construction of the first and second translation cum mount assemblies and the flexure mechanism may vary to achieve the above purpose. The angular adjustments of the mirrors may be carried out by different arrangements. The linear movements of the mirrors and the lens along the three axes may be carried out by different arrangements. Such variations in the configuration and construction of the optomechanical scanner of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
 A method and an optomechanical scanner   for three dimensional focused laser beam spot<br>
scanning. A laser beam is allowed to fall on a first mirror (Ml) held in the path of the laser beam with its reflective surface inclined at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam. The first mirror is linearly movable in the horizontal plane along the Y-axis. The laser beam reflected from the first mirror is allowed to fall on a second mirror (M2) held above the first mirror spaced apart from the first mirror with the reflective surface of the second mirror inclined at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam reflected from the first mirror. The second mirror is linearly movable in the vertical plane along the Z-axis. The laser beam reflected from the second mirror is allowed to fall on a third mirror (M3) held spaced apart from the second mirror with the reflective surface of the third mirror inclined at 45° to the optic axis of the laser beam reflected from the second mirror. The laser beam reflected from the third mirror is allowed to fall on a fourth mirror (M4) held spaced apart from the third mirror with the reflective surface of the fourth mirror inclined at 45° to the laser beam reflected from the third mirror. The laser beam reflected from the fourth mirror is allowed to fall on a focusing lens (L) held below the fourth mirror spaced apart from the fourth mirror and perpendicular to the optic axis of the laser beam reflected from the fourth mirror. The third and fourth mirrors and the lens together are linearly movable along the X-axis and the fourth mirror and lens together are linearly movable along the Y-axis and the lens is linearly movable along the Z-axis. On-axis scanning is carried out by linearly adjusting the first and second mirrors to allow the optic axis of the laser beam and lens axis to be on-axis and moving the third and fourth mirrors with the lens along the X-axis to carryout X-axis scanning, moving the fourth mirror with the lens along the Y-axis to carryout Y-axis scanning and moving the lens along the Z-axis to carry out Z-axis scanning. Off-axis scanning is carried out by linearly adjusting the first and second mirrors to allow the optic axis of the laser beam and lens axis to be off-axis, moving the first mirror along the Y-axis to carry out X-axis scanning, moving the second mirror along the Z-axis to carry out Y-axis scanning and moving the lens along the Z-axis to carryout Z-axis scanning (Fig 1).</td>
