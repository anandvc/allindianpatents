Scheme 1-10 illustrate methods of synthesizing compounds of the formula I.<br>
Referring to Scheme 1, the starting material of formula III is reacted with trifluoroacetic anhydride, in the presence of pyridine, to form the compound of formula IV. This reaction is typically conducted in methylene chloride at a temperature from about 0°C to about room temperature.<br>
The compound of formula IV is then converted into the dinitro derivative of formula IIA by the following process. The compound of the formula IV is added to a mixture of 4 or more equivalents of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO2OH) and 2 to 3 equivalents of nitric acid, in a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform, dichoroethane (DCE) or methylene chloride. The resulting mixture is allowed to react for about 5 to 24 hours. Both of the foregoing reactions are generally conducted at a temperature ranging from about -78°C to about 0°C for about 2 hours, and then allowed to warm to room temperature for the remaining time.<br>

Biological Assay<br>
The effectiveness of the active compounds in suppressing nicotine binding to specific receptor sites is determined by the following procedure which is a modification of the methods of Lippiello, P. M. and Fernandes, K. G. (in The Binding of L-[3H]Nicotine To A Single Class of High-Affinity Sites in Rat Brain Membranes, Molecular Pharm., 29, 448-54, (1986)) and Anderson, D. J. and Arneric, S. P. (in Nicotinic Receptor Binding of 3H-Cystisine, 3H-Nicotine and 3H-Methylcarmbamylcholine In Rat Brain, European J. Pharm., 253, 261-67 (1994)).<br>
Procedure<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) from Charles River were housed in groups in hanging stainless steel wire cages and were maintained on a 12 hour light/dark cycle (7 a.m.-7 p.m. light period). They received standard Purina Rat Chow and water ad libitum.<br>
The rats were killed by decapitation. Brains were removed immediately following decapitation. Membranes were prepared from brain tissue according to the methods of Lippiello and Fernandez (Molec Pharmacol, 29, 448-454, (1986) with some modifications. Whole brains were removed, rinsed with ice-cold buffer, and homogenized at 0° in 10 volumes of buffer (w/v) using a Brinkmann Polytron™, setting 6, for 30 seconds. The buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris HCI at a pH of 7.5 at room temperature. The homogenate was sedimented by centrifugation (10 minutes; 50,000 x g; 0 to 4°C. The supernatant was poured off and the membranes were gently resuspended with the Polytron and centrifuged again (10 minutes; 50,000 x g; 0 to 4°C. After the second centrifugation, the membranes were resuspended in assay buffer at a concentration of 1.0g/100mL The composition of the standard assay buffer was 50 mM Tris HCI, 120 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 2 mM MgCI2, 2 mM CaCI2 and has a pH of 7.4 at room temperature.<br>
Routine assays were performed in borosilicate glass test tubes. The assay mixture typically consisted of 0.9 mg of membrane protein in a final incubation volume of 1.0 ml. Three sets of tubes were prepared wherein the tubes in each set contained 50µL of vehicle, blank, or test compound solution, respectively. To each tube was added 200 µL of [3H]-nicotine in assay buffer followed by 750 µL of the membrane suspension. The final concentration of nicotine in each tube was 0.9 nM. The final concentration of cytisine in the blank was 1 ^M. The vehicle consisted of deionized water containing 30 µL of 1 N acetic acid per 50 ml of water. The test compounds and cytisine were dissolved in vehicle. Assays were initiated by vortexing after addition of the membrane suspension to the tube. The samples were incubated at 0 to 4° C in an iced shaking water bath. Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration under vacuum through Whatman GF/B™ glass fiber filters using a Brandel™ multi-manifold tissue harvester. Following the initial filtration of the assay mixture, filters were washed two times with ice-cold assay buffer (5 m each). The filters were then placed in counting vials and mixed vigorously with 20 ml of Ready Safe™ (Beckman) before quantification of radioactivity. Samples were counted in a LKB Wallach Rackbeta™ liquid scintillation counter at 40-50% efficiency. All determinations were in triplicate.<br>
Calculations<br>
Specific binding (C) to the membrane is the difference between total binding in the samples containing vehicle only and membrane (A) and non-specific binding in the samples containing the membrane and cytisine (B), i.e.,<br>
Specific binding = (C) = (A) - (B).<br>
Specific binding in the presence of the test compound (E) is the difference between the total binding in the presence of the test compound (D) and non-specific binding (B), i.e., (E) = (D) -(B).<br>
% Inhibition = (1-((E)/(C)) times 100.<br>
The compounds of the invention that were tested in the above assay exhibited IC50 values of less than 10 nM.<br>

Magnesium turnings (36.5 g, 1.5 M) were stirred in anhydrous THF (250 mL) in a dried 2 L 3 neck round bottom flask equipped with a 250 mL non-equalizing addition funnel with a nitrogen (N2) flow adapter, mechanical stirrer and efficient condenser equipped with a N2 flow adapter. The flask was stirred and warmed to reflux by a removable heating mantle. 2-Fluorobromobenzene (2g) was added followed by 1 mL of 3N ethylmagnesium bromide (EtMgBr in THF). The addition funnel was charged with a mixture of cyclopentadiene (94.4 g, 1.43 M. Prepared by the method described in: Org. Syn. Col. Vol. V, 414-418) and bromofluorobenzene (250 g, 1.43 M) which was maintained at 0 °C in a separate flask by an ice bath, and transferred to the addition funnel via cannula. Small portions (~1 mL) of the intimate mixture were introduced to assist initiation (~4x). After -15 minutes, the reaction initiated (exotherm, and vapor condensation), the heating mantle was removed and the contents of the addition funnel was added dropwise at such rate as to maintain reflux (1.5 hours). The heating mantle was re-applied and a reflux maintained for 1.5 hours. (TLC 100% hexanes R, 0.67).<br>
The reaction was cooled to room temperature and quenched with H2O (500 mL) and carefully with 1N HCI (200 mL, produces H2 evolution from unconsumed Mg). To this ~50 mL<br>
concentrated HCI was added to dissolve solids. Total addition/quench time ~1 hour. Saturated aqueous sodium chloride (NaCI) solution (300ml) was added and product hexanes extracted until no potassium permanganate (KMn04) active product is removed. (4 x ~250 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (250 mL), sodium bicarbonate Na2SO4 dried and concentrated to an oil (~200 g). The product was distilled at 78-83 °C @15mm (131 g, 64%). (An alternative workup is described on p.419 Fieser and Fieser, Vol. I, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Wiley, NY., NY.; 1967).<br>

To this sodium periodate (NalO4) (51 g. 239 mmol) and triethylbenzyl ammonium chloride (Et3BnNCI) (50 mg) were added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour (slight initial exotherm), then the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCE (200 mL). The organic layer was washed with H2O (4 x 200 mL, or until no reaction to starch iodide is observed in the aqueous wash) then dried through a cotton plug. To this was added benzyl amine (25.5 g, 238.6 mmol) and the mixture was stirred for 2 minutes then immediately transferred into the sodium triacetoxyborohydride NaHB(OAc)3/DCE (see below) over 10 minutes.<br>
In a separate 2 L round botton flask flask under nitrogen was magnetically stirred NaHB(OAc)3 (154 g, 0.727 mmol) in DCE (800 ml) at 0 °C (ice bath). To this was added the above mixture over 10 minutes, without delay after the dialdehyde and amine were mixed. The resulting orange mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 30-60 minutes.<br>
The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) solution (~300 ml) carefully at first and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour (pH 9). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2CI2 (2 x 300 ml). The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaCI solution (200 ml), dried through a cotton plug, then evaporated to a red oil. This was dissolved in a minimum of Et20 and filtered through a Silica pad (3x4 inch) eluting with 15% ethyl acetate (EtOAc)/hexanes +1% of 37% aqueous ammonium hydroxide (NK,OH) solution to remove baseline red color.
