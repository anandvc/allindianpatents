A method for the Manufacture of a Transdermal Drug.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Filed<br>
The invention relates to a method for the manufacture of a transdermal drug delivery system, that is a system for the administration of medicine through the skin of a patient and into the systemic circulation system. In this way, the medicine avoids passing through the gastro-intestinal tract and liver. Thus metabolism is to some extent avoided, and a smaller dose can be used. Background Art<br>
GB 2249956 contains a useful summary of the state of the art, and discloses such systems containing super-saturated solutions of an active ingredient within an adhesive layer by use of a carefully selected mixture of solvents. EP-A-276561 discloses a method for the manufacture of a transdermal drug delivery system in which the active ingredient, piroxicam, is mixed with an alkaline agent, the mixture obtained after the alkaline agent has been added is further dissolved and dispersed in a solubilizing agent such as crotamiton, and then the mixture is blended into an aqueous adhesive base to form a homogeneous pharmaceutical composition for use in tape form. The only example given using crotamiton as the solubilizing agent has a weight ratio of piroxicam to crotamiton of 1:2, which is well in excess of saturation concentration. The mixture is blended into an aqueous adhesive base from which a transdermal tape is formed by coating the mixture onto a peel-off liner and drying.<br>
WO-A-92/10231  discloses  the use of sub-saturated solutions of the active ingredient, but only when the drug is hydrophobic.  No skin penetration enhancer is contemplated. THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a method for the manufacture of a transdermal drug delivery system, which comprises the successive steps of:<br>
(a)	dissolving  a   pharmaceutically  active   substance   such  as  herein<br>
defined in a solvent such as herein defined which is one or more of the skin<br>
penetration enhancers crotamiton and diethyltoluamide (DEET), and optinally<br>
one or more other skin penetration enhancers, to form a solutin of active<br>
substance in the skin penetration enhancer(s) at a concentration less than<br>
saturation;<br>
(b)	mixture the resulting solution which an adhesive such as herein<br>
defined in the form of a solution or an aqueous dispersion;<br>
(c)	forming the mixture obtained in (b) into a coating on a release liner or<br>
backing sheet; and<br>
(d)	drying the coating at a temperature less than the boiling point of the<br>
skin penetration enhancer or enhancers used as solvent in the dissolution step (a)<br>
to yield a transdermal drug delivery system for the administration of the<br>
pharmaceutically active substance through the skin of a patent and into the<br>
patient's systemic circulatiory system.<br>
The invention provides for effective transdermal delivery of any number of pharmaceutically active substances at less than the saturation concentrations. The invention selects, as a solvent to create the original solution of the pharmaceutically active substance, a solvent that is both a good solvent for the drug and a good skin penetration enhancer, and thus the creation of the initial solution of the active substance is made easier because the use of a separate aqueous or organic solvent is unnecessary. Because of the skin penetration enhancement properties of the solvent, good transdermal transport properties can be achieved even at sub saturated drug concentrations. Indeed the transdermal drug transport characteristics from sub saturated solutions have<br>
been found to be even better than those at saturated solutions have been found to be even better than those at saturated solutions have been found to be even better than those at saturated or supersaturated concentrations, which is the reverse of contrary to what is known in the art, as exemplified by Pick's Law.<br>
Investigations by the inventors found that two skin penetration enhancers in<br>
particular  showed   sufficiently  high  dissolution  properties  for  a  range  of<br>
hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs to be used as the solvent to created the<br>
original solution of the active substance. These sol vent/enhancers are crotamiton<br>
and diethyltoluamide (DEET).<br>
The process steps of the invention are as set out in claim 1.<br>
By using the active substance in, a ration less than saturation level, there is a<br>
reduced risk of crystallisation, a stable system can be manufactured, and a<br>
constant rate of delivery to the patient can be obtained.<br>
It is surprising that certain solvents act both as a skin penetration enhancer and<br>
as a solvent for the active substance. Such solvents/enhancers are crotamiton,<br>
diethyltoluamide (DEET) and mixtures thereof. The ratio of crotamiton to DEET<br>
in such a solvent mixture may be from 5:95 to 95.5% by weight of the total<br>
solvent/enhancer content depending on the delivery rate and extent of the<br>
delivery required for the active substance. By choosing a solvent/enhancer of<br>
sol vent/enhancers having a boiling point higher than any drying temperature<br>
applied to the system, and controlling the drying temperature, the solvent(s) do<br>
not evaporate, the solution of the active substance never becomes, and a high<br>
proportion    of    active    substance    remains    in    the    system.    The    active<br>
substance/solvent(s) solution cab be maintained at 20°-30° for over one month.<br>

More preferably, 0.3% to 30% by weight of the coating material.<br>
The active substance is generally incorporated in the solvent/enhancer at room temperature (25°C or Below) and in a ratio less than 90% of saturation level to prevent crystal formation during storage. Dissolution may be aided by sonication or warming. The resulting solution can be added slowly to the adhesive which may be in the form of an aqueous dispersion or solution, and mixed. The adhesive can be an acrylate, silicone or polyisobutylene. An adhesive thickener may be added to the mixture at about a 50% solution/water mix to produce a thicker spreading solution for reverse roll coating or knife over roll coating.<br>
The resulting delivery system may then be coated onto a release liner, which may be a siliconised polyester such as type FL 2000 (commercially available), or paper, which naturally is impermeable to the active substance. The system can then be dried by circulating hot air, and laminated onto a backing sheet, which may be a 3M Health Care Type 1220, the backing sheet naturally being impermeable to the active substance. The layer may be coated to a wet-coat thickness of from 20 to 500 µ. Alternatively, the delivery system mixture may be spread or coated onto the backing sheet, and then laminated to the release liner. The hot air circulation may be effected at gradually increased temperatures from 50°Ctol40°C.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 is section through an adhesive tape for application to the skin of a patient comprising a drug delivery system according to the invention. A delivery system comprising an active substance, adhesive and solvent/skin penetration enhancer 4 is coated as a layer onto a siliconized release paper 2 and laminated onto a backing strip 6.<br>
The following Examples of ingredients in parts by weight may be used in the production of delivery systems as described above:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Manufacturing Method (illustrative)<br>
A)      Delivery system using adhesive - aqueous emulsion<br>
The active substance is dissolved in the solvent by means of heating and mixing over a 45°-55°C water bath with agitation. When the solution is optically clear, it is checked microscopically for absence of crystals.<br>
The adhesive is weighed into a separated mixing vessel, diluted with water if necessary over a period not exceeding 30 mins to achieve the requisite viscosity.<br><br>
The active substance/solvent solution is gradually added to the adhesive solution with mixing. The pH is adjusted to 6.5-7.5 and a thickener is added (if appropriate) to obtain a suitable viscosity (eg 900-100 cps) for the selected coating process such as reverse roll coating or knife over roll coating. The resultant aqueous emulsion is coated onto a release liner (typical coating thickness 20-500 µ), and dried by passing in sequence through ovens at 50-140°C. the product is then laminated onto a backing sheet.<br>
B)      Delivery system using an adhesive solution<br>
The active substance is dissolved in a solvent by means of heating and mixing as<br>
described above. The adhesive is weighed in a separate vessel and the active<br>
substance/solvent solution is gradually added to the solution of adhesive with<br>
mixing. The resultant adhesive solution is coated onto a release liner, dried by<br>
passing in sequence through ovens at 50-140°C. The product is then laminated<br>
onto a backing sheet.<br>
In-vitro drug delivery through the skin<br>
In-vitro skin permeation experiments with human skin have been on systems<br>
made from the above ingredients carried out using Franz-type diffusion cells,<br>
and the studies were carried out on a Hanson Microette system.<br>
Dermatomed human skin sections were mounted onto the Franz cells and<br>
transdermal drug delivery systems mounted on tape backings (105cm2) were<br>
placed on the stratum corneal surface of the skin. Each Franz cell contained 7ml<br>
of ethanol phosphate buffered saline as the receptor medium, maintained at<br>
32°C.  At predetermined  time intervals 0.7ml of the receptor solution was<br>
sampled and an equal amount replaced.<br>
The samples were analysed by High pressure Liquid Chromatography.<br>
The skin mass transport of Estradiol and Norethisterone Acetate has been found<br>
to be enhanced by the solvent / skin penetration enhancer DEET  and / or<br>
Crdtamiton in a concentration below saturation. Further, the active substance flux profile follows the solvent flux profile, the latter showing high skin penetration flux during the first 20 hours of application.<br>
Indications<br>
The main indications are in both peri-menopausal and menopausal women for<br>
the control in the former of the symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes,<br>
sweating and the other symptoms of the peri-menopause, and in the case of the<br>
menopause the prevention of osteoporosis and cardiac events such as coronary<br>
thrombosis.<br><br><br><br><br>
