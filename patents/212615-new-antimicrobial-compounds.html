Compounds of the present invention represented by the formula (I) or (Ia) can be prepared by the process as described below.<br>
Compounds A-500359A (Exemp. compound No. 1), A-500359C (Exemp. compound No. 2), A-500359D (Exemp. compound No. 3), A-500359G (Exemp. compound No. 45) and A-500359M-2 (Exemp. compound No. 396) of the present invention each represented by the formula (I) are available by culturing a microorganism capable of producing the above described compounds, belonging to the Streptomyces spp. on a suitable medium and then recovering the compound from the cultured broth. Streptomyces griseus Strain SANK60196 (which will hereinafter be called "Strain SANK60196"), a preferable microorganism capable of producing Compounds A-500359A, A-500359C, A-500359D, A-500359G or A-500359M-2 has been collected and separated from the soil of Mt. Tsukuba/Ibaraki-ken in a manner known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Mycological properties of Strain SANK60196 are as follows: 1) Morphological appearance<br>
Strain SANK60196 showed morphological appearance as described below after cultivation at 28°C for 14 days on a medium specified by International Streptomyces Project (which will hereinafter be abbreviated as "ISP") [refer to Shirling, E.B. and Gottlieb, D., "Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 16, 313-340 (1996)".] Observation through an optical microscope indicates that substrate mycelia of SANK60196 are favourably grown and branched and show yellowish grey, yellowish brown or pale olive colour, but unlike the strain belonging to Nocardia spp., does not show cleavage or zigzag extension. Aerial mycelia exhibit simple branching. The form of the spore chain is straight or curved and its chain is formed of 10 to 50 or greater spores. Observation through a scanning electron microscope shows that the spore has an oval shape and it has a smooth surface structure. The spore is 0.6-0.8 x 0.7-1.2 mm in dimension. The spore is formed only on the aerial mycelia. Formation of sporangia, axial division of aerial mycelia, cleavage of aerial mycelia and sclerotia are not recognized.<br><br>

4) Chemotaxonomic properties<br>
The cell wall of the present strain was investigated in accordance with the method of Hasegawa, et al. [refer to Hasegawa, T., et al., "The Journal of General and Applied Microbiology, 29, 319-322(1983)], resulting in the detection of LL-diaminopimelic acid. The main sugar component in the whole cells of the present strain was investigated in accordance with the method of M.P. Lechevalier [refer to Lechevalier, M.P., "Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, 71, 934-944(1968)]. As a result, no characteristic component was detected.<br>
The above-described mycological properties have revealed that the present strain belongs to Streptomyces spp. among the actinomycetes. It has been made clear that the present strain is markedly related to Streptomyces griseus, as a result of comparison with the microorganism described in the ISP strains by Shirling and Gottlieb [refer to Shirling, E.B. and Gottlieb, D., "International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 18, 68-189 and 279-392 (1968); 19, 391-512 (1969); 22, 265-394 (1972)"], the microorganism described in "The actinomycetes Vol. 2" written by Waksman [refer to Waksman, S.A., "The actinomycetes 2 (1961)"], with the microorganism described in Bergey's Manual edited by Buchanan and Gibbons [refer to R.E. Buchanan and N.E. Gibbons, "Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology", 8th edition (1974)], with the microorganism described in "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology", edited by Williams [refer to Williams, S.T., et al., "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology 4 (1989)"] and with the microorganism described in the recent literature about actinomycetes belonging to Streptomyces spp. It has however been recognized to be different from Streptomyces griseus, because it produces a yellowish grey soluble pigment on a glycerin -asparagine agar medium and a pale yellowish brown soluble pigment on a peptone -yeast extract - iron agar medium but produces a soluble pigment neither on a potato extract - carrot extract agar medium nor on a water agar medium; the maximum growth temperature is 40°C; and it is grown in the presence of 7% of salt.<br>
The present strain having such mycological characteristics is considered to be a novel strain different from Streptomyces griseus, but it is impossible to distinguish them based on only the above-described differences. The present inventors therefore identified the present strain as Streptomyces griseus SANK60196.<br><br>
-58-<br>
This strain was internationally deposited with Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of Internet ional Trade and Industry (l-3,Higashi 1-chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305, JAPAN) as of February 22, 1996, with the accession number of FERM BP-5420.<br>
A desertion was heretofo re made on Strain SANK60196. It Is known that various properties of actinomycetes are not fixed but easily change naturally or synthetically.<br>
Any synthetic or natural medium can be used for cultivation for microorganisms capable of producing Compounds A-500359A, A-500359C, A-500359D, A-500359G or A-500359M-2 of the present invention, insofar as it contains, as needed, a substance selected from carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic ions and organic nutrition sources.<br>
Known carbon sources, nitrogen sources and inorganic sate conventionally employed for cutevatem of the strain of the eumycetess or actinomycetes and are utilizable by a microorganism can be used as such nutrition sources<br>
Specific examples of the carbon source Include glucose, fructose, maltose sucrose, marmttol, glycerol, dextrin, oats, rye, corn starch, potato, corn meat , soybean meal, cotton seed oil, thick malt syrup, therlac, soybean oil, citric acid and tartarlc acid. They may be used either singly or In combhation. The amount of the carbon source to be added usually varies, but not limited to, within a range of from 1 to 10 wt.%.<br>
As the nitrogen source, a subsance containhg protein or hydrotyzate thereof can usually be employed. Deferred examples of the nitrogen source include soybean meal, wheat bran, peanut meat, cotton seed meal, casein hydroiyzate, Farrnamine, fish meal, com steep liquor, peptone, meat extract, pressed y east, dry yeast, yeast extract, matt<br>
extract, potato, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate. It Is preferred to use the nitrogen source either singly or In combination In an amount ranghg from 0.2 to 6 wt.% of the amount of the medium.<br><br>
59<br>
As the nutrition inorganic salt, ordinarily employed salts from which an ion is available, such as sodium salts, ammonium salts, calcium salts, phosphates, sulfates, chlorides and carbonates can be used. In addition, trace metals such as potassium, calcium, cobalt, manganese, iron and magnesium are usable.<br>
For the production of Compound A-500359A, the addition of cobalt or yeast extract is particularly effective.<br>
Upon culturing the microorganism capable of producing Compound A-500359A, A-500359C, A-500359D, A-500359G or A-500359M-2, an inhibitor of antibiotic biosynthesis can be added to produce useful related compounds. Compound A500359M-2 can be produced, for example, by using, as a medium additive, S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine or salt thereof which is an aspartate kinase inhibitor. The additive can be added to give its final concentration ranging from 1 to 100 mM. Preferably, use of it to give a final concentration of 10 mM permits favorable production of Compound A-500359M-2.<br>
Upon liquid culture, a silicone oil, vegetable oil or surfactant can be added as an antifoamer.<br>
The medium used for the cultivation of Strain SANK 60196 to produce Compound A-500359A, A-500359C, A-500359D, A-500359G or A-500359M-2 preferably has a pH ranging from 5.0 to 8.0.<br>
The temperature which allows Strain SANK60196 to grow ranges from 12 to 36°C. It is preferred to cultivate the strain at 18 to 28°C in order to produce Compound A-500359A, A-500359C, A-500359D, A-500359G or A-500359M-2, of which 19 to 23°C is more preferred.<br>
Compound A-500359A, A-500359C, A-500359D, A-500359G or A-500359M-2 is available by aerobic culture of Strain SANK 60196. Ordinarily-employed solid culture, shake culture, and aeration agitation culture can be used as such culturing method.<br>
For small-scale culturing, agitation of the culture for several days at 19 to 23oC is preferred. Culturing is started by growing a seed culture in a single or two stage process in an Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a baffle (water flow adjusting wall) or an ordinarily-employed Erlenmeyer flask. A carbon source and a nitrogen source can be used in combination as a medium in the seed culture. The flask or seed culture may be shaken at 19 to 23°C for 5 days or until the seed cultures grow<br><br>
60<br>
sufficiently in a thermostat incubator. The seed cultures thus grown can be used for inoculation of the second seed culture medium or a production medium. When the seed cultures are used under an intermediate growing step, they are allowed to grow essentially in a similar manner, followed by inoculation of a part of them into a production medium. The flask into which the seed cultures has been inoculated is subjected to culturing with shaking at a constant temperature for several days and after completion of the culturing, the cultured medium in the flask is centrifuged or filtered.<br>
For large-scale cultivation, on the other hand, culturing in a jar fermenter or tank equipped with an agitator and an aeration apparatus is preferred. Prior to culturing in such a container, the culture medium is heated to 125°C for sterilization.

Esterification is conducted in a similar manner to the corresponding reaction in Step A2. Use of an esterifying agent in an amount of about 1 molar equivalent yields a mixture of monoesters. This mixture can easily be separated, for example, by column chromatography. Use of the esterifying agent in an amount of about 2 molar equivalents yields a diester.<br>

Use of the esterifying agent in an amount of about 2 molar equivalents yields a diester. The hydroxy-protecting reaction of the compound thus obtained is conducted in a similar manner to Step Al. Use of a protecting agent in an amount of about 1 molar equivalent yields a mixture of compounds each having one protected hydroxy group. This mixture can easily be separated, for example, by column chromatography. Use of the protecting agent in an amount of about 2 molar equivalents yields a compound having two protected hydroxy groups.<br>

After completion of the cultivation, the cultured broth (52 L) obtained above in 1) was filtered with the aid of "Celite 545" (product of Celite Co.) added at 4% (v/v). The filtrate (50 L) was charged on a "Diaion HP-20" column (product of Mitsubishi Chemical; 12 L). The resulting column was washed with 18 L of distilled water and the adsorbed substance was eluted with 50 L of 10% aqueous acetone. The eluate was concentrated by "Evapor" to give 15 L of the concentrate.<br>
Upon purification as described later, the active substance of each fraction was monitored by HPLC under the following conditions.<br>

Fraction A was combined with Fraction E (the combined one will hereinafter be called "Fraction H"), while Fraction C was combined with Fraction G (the combined one will hereinafter be called "Fraction I"). Fractions F, H and I were concentrated on "Evapor" and lyophilized, respectively, whereby 16.2 g of Fraction H, 33.6 g of Fraction I and 8.6 g of Fraction F were obtained, each as a crude powdery product.<br>

These fractions were collected and concentrated by "Evapor" into 820 ml and the resulting concentrate was lyophilized to give 6.4 g of a crude powdery product.<br>
The crude powdery product thus obtained was dissolved in 400 ml of water. Each of the 80 ml portions of the resulting solution was charged on an HPLC column<br><br>
(YMC-Pack ODS R-3105-20 (100 x 500 mm; product of YMC Co., Ltd.)) equilibrated with a 6% aqueous solution of acetonitrile; followed by column development at a flow rate of 200 ml/min. The ultraviolet absorption of the active substance at 210 nm was detected and a peak eluted at a retention time of 105 to 120 minutes was collected by five fractionation, each in portions of 400 ml.<br>

The resulting crude powdery product (25 g) was dissolved in 300 ml of deionised water. The resulting solution was charged on a "Cosmosil 140C18-OPN" column (product of Nacalai Tesque; 1.5 L). After washing the column with 3 L of deionised water and 12 L of 1% aqueous acetonitrile, the active compound was eluted with 6 L of 10% aqueous acetonitrile.
