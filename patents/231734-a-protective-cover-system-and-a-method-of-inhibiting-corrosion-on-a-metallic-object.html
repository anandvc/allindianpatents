Application No. 60/386,017 filed June 5,2002.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to the field of covers for protecting materials<br>
from environmental elements. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a protective<br>
cover system that includes a corrosion inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Attention to corrosion and corrosion mitigation have become increasingly important for<br>
economic and safety reasons. Based on estimates made in the mid 1990's, overall costs<br>
attributable to corrosion account for over $100 billion a year in the United States alone. These<br>
costs typically account for only the direct costs of corrosion and do not include the associated<br>
indirect costs, such as safety, plant downtime, loss of product, contamination and over-design.<br>
[0004] Corrosion may be defined as the destructive effect of an environment on a metal or<br>
metal alloy. Nearly every metallic corrosion process involves the transfer of electronic charge in<br>
aqueous solution, and most corrosion reactions take place in the presence of water in either liquid<br>
or condensed vapor phases and also in high humidity. Corrosion is particularly a problem in<br>
marine environments experienced in places such as shipboard, aboard off-shore drilling rigs, and<br>
in coastal regions, among others, where seawater enhances corrosion reactions due to increased<br>
ion transport, pH effects, and elevated dissolved oxygen levels that in turn enhance levels of<br>
hydrogen ions. Corrosion reactions are further accelerated in marine environments by<br>
contaminants, such as chloride ions, present in seawater. Corrosion damage to equipment stored<br><br>
and used in marine environments is a tremendous problem, impacting maintenance costs,<br>
availability, repair, and reliability.<br>
[0005] Equipment stored, e.g., onboard a ship or in coastal regions, is often stored in protective<br>
storage systems that have proved to be less than optimally effective. At best, such equipment is<br>
covered with waterproof tarpaulins, although often, especially for shipboard equipment, it is not<br>
covered properly and is directly exposed to a marine environment, which leads to rapid<br>
corrosion. Even when equipment is covered by waterproof tarpaulins, seawater still penetrates<br>
through and/or around the tarpaulins into the protected spaces where it collects and corrodes the<br>
underlying equipment. Also, conventional storage systems can be cumbersome to use and<br>
maintain, and are therefore often avoided. As a result, corrosion continues to be a significant and<br>
costly problem, requiring many hours of rust removal, painting, and repair that often lead to<br>
premature equipment replacement.<br>
[0006] FIG. 1 shows a conventional waterproof cover 20 used to protect an object, such as<br>
metallic object 22 resting on a surface 24, from moisture, such as rain, sea spray, dew and the<br>
like. Cover 20 has an outer surface 26, an inner surface 28, and an area 30 defined by a<br>
peripheral edge 32. Cover 20 is shown covering object 22 in a typical manner, wherein a<br>
microenvironment is generally defined by the space enclosed by the cover. The<br>
microenvironment comprises a number of interior regions, such as regions 34, located between<br>
cover 20 and object 22.<br>
[0007] Generally, conventional covers, such as cover 20, comprise at least one liquid-<br>
impermeable layer made of, e.g., a tightly-woven polymer fabric or a non-woven structure, such<br>
as a continuous film or other membrane. More complex conventional covers may include one or<br>
more additional layers that provide them with additional features, such as highly durable outer<br>
surfaces to withstand harsh environments and non-abrasive inner-surfaces to minimize<br>
mechanical damage to the object covered. Other conventional covers are made of vapor-<br>
permeable, porous materials, such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or the like.<br><br>
[0008] The air in interior regions 34 generally never has a moisture content less than the<br>
moisture content of the ambient environment. If the moisture content of the ambient<br>
environment rises, the moisture content of regions 34 also rises due to the inflow of moisture<br>
(illustrated by arrow 36) through gaps between cover 20 and surface 24 at peripheral edges 32 of<br>
the cover. Eventually, the moisture content of the ambient environment 38 and regions 34<br>
equalize. Once the additional moisture is in the microenvironment, it can become trapped, as<br>
illustrated by arrows 40. Moisture levels can quickly become elevated, and the air saturated. In<br>
such a case, condensation could occur on the object 22. Because the moisture content of interior<br>
regions 34 never falls below that of ambient environment 38, conventional covers are not very<br>
effective in high moisture environments, such as marine and high-humidity environments.<br>
Moreover, once moisture enters the microenvironment, it can take a long time to dissipate, if at<br>
all.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00091 In. one aspect, the present invention is directed to a protective cover system for<br>
protecting an object by defining a microenvironment adjacent the object when the protective<br>
cover system is applied to the object. The protective cover system comprises a cover for being<br>
applied to the object and defining a microenvironment when the cover is applied to the object.<br>
The cover includes a first layer that comprises a non-porous water-vapor-permeable layer. A<br>
corrosion inhibitor source provides at least one corrosion inhibitor to the microenvironment<br>
when the cover is applied to the object. The corrosion inhibitor source is in communication with<br>
the microenvironment when the cover is applied to the object so that at least some of the<br>
corrosion inhibitor may enter the microenvironment.<br>
[0010] In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a protective cover system for<br>
inhibiting corrosion of an object by forming a microenvironment adjacent the object when the<br>
protective cover system is applied to the object. The protective cover system comprises a cover<br>
that includes a first layer having a first face and a second face. The first layer comprises an<br>
absorbent material adapted to absorb and store moisture. A second layer is located adjacent the<br>
first face of the first layer and is liquid-impermeable. A corrosion inhibitor source that<br><br>
comprises at least one corrosion inhibitor fluidly communicates with the microenvironment<br>
when the cover is applied to the object.<br>
[0011] In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a panelized cover system for<br>
protecting an object from moisture. The panelized cover system comprises a plurality of panels<br>
each comprising a first layer having a first face and a second face. The first layer comprises an<br>
absorbent material adapted to absorb and store the moisture. A second layer is located adjacent<br>
the first face of the first layer. The second layer is liquid-impermeable. Each of the plurality of<br>
panels is fastened to at least one adjacent one of the plurality of panels.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, FIG. 2<br>
illustrates a protective, corrosion-inhibiting cover system, which is generally denoted by the<br>
numeral 100. Cover system 100 may include a cover 101 that may be made of flexible materials<br>
and includes an outer surface 102, an inner surface 104, and a peripheral edge 106 that defines an<br>
area 108, which may be shaped as desired to suit a particular application. Alternatively,<br>
cover 101 may include rigid materials that may be formed into a shape conforming to the shape<br>
of the object to be covered or to another shape suitable for that object. When covering an object,<br>
such as a metallic object 110 resting on a surface 112, outer surface 102 is exposed to an ambient<br>
environment 114 and inner surface 104 defines a microenvironment comprising one or more<br>
interior regions, such as the interior regions 116, located between inner surface 104 and<br>
object 110 and/or surface 112.<br>
[0014] Although object 110 is generally protected from elements present in ambient<br>
environment 114 by cover 101, often moisture from the ambient environment tends to infiltrate<br>
(as illustrated by arrow 118) interior regions 116 through gaps between peripheral edge 106 of<br>
the cover and surface 112. A feature of the present invention allows cover 101 to absorb and<br>
store such infiltrating moisture (as illustrated by arrows 120), and other moisture trapped within<br>
interior regions 116, so as to maintain the moisture content of the microenvironment at a low<br>
level, often below the moisture content of ambient environment 114. Another feature of the<br><br>
present invention allows cover 101 to absorb and store by wicking action any water present on<br>
the surface of object 110 that comes into contact with inner surface 104 of the cover. The result<br>
is a low-moisture microenvironment that inhibits metallic object 110 from corroding.<br>
[0015] Yet another feature of the present invention permits cover 101 to regenerate its<br>
moisture-absorbing and storing features by diffusing stored moisture to outer surface 102 of the<br>
cover, where it can evaporate (as illustrated by arrows 122) into ambient environment 114 when<br>
conditions there are suitable for evaporation. A further feature of the present invention is the<br>
ability to disperse one or more corrosions inhibitors into regions 116 of the microenvironment<br>
formed beneath cover 101 so that the corrosion inhibitors are deposited on the surface of metallic,<br>
object 110, e.g., as a film 123.<br>
[0016] As discussed in more detail below, each of these and other features may be incorporated<br>
into protective cover system 100 of the present invention either singly or in various combinations<br>
with one another. For example, one embodiment of cover 101 may be provided with the<br>
moisture absorbing feature, but not the corrosion inhibitor feature. Likewise, another<br>
embodiment may be provided with the corrosion inhibitor feature, but not the moisture-<br>
absorbing feature. Of course, another embodiment may include both the moisture absorbing and<br>
corrosion inhibitor feature. Each of these embodiments may optionally be augmented or<br>
supplemented as desired and/or appropriate with various other features, such as the surface<br>
wicking, edge wicking, radar influencing, evaporation augmenting, and panelization features,<br>
among others, described herein.<br>
[0017] A beneficial attribute of protective cover system 100 of the present invention is that it<br>
can be made to any size and shape necessary to protect an object having virtually any size and<br>
surface profile. Some diverse examples of such objects ate containers for container ships, deck-<br>
mounted guns on naval ships, construction equipment, stored construction materials, air<br>
conditioning units and barbeque grills, to name just a few. Pouches made from cover 101 could<br>
be fashioned to store munitions, tools, handguns and telephones and other electronic devices to<br>
name just a few. One skilled in the art will recognize that there is a vast range of applications for<br>
protective cover system 100 of the present invention.<br><br>
[0018] FIG. 3 shows one embodiment of protective cover system 100 of the present invention,<br>
which may include a cover identified by the numeral 200. Cover 200 may comprise a liquid-<br>
permeable layer 202, a liquid-impermeable layer 204, and a moisture-absorbing layer 206<br>
sandwiched between the liquid-permeable and liquid-impermeable layers. With reference to<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3, liquid-permeable layer 202 generally defines inner surface 104 of cover 200 and<br>
may, among other things, retain the constituent materials) (described below) of moisture-<br>
absorbing layer 206 within the cover. Liquid-permeable layer 202 may be vapor permeable to<br>
allow moisture vapor within interior regions 116 to reach moisture-absorbing layer 206 and<br>
liquid-permeable to allow any liquid water contacting inner surface 204 of cover 200 to be<br>
wicked into the moisture-absorbing layer. In a typical embodiment, liquid-permeable layer 202<br>
has a water transmission rate that is greater than 10 g/m2-hr, although the present invention<br>
encompasses the use of liquid-permeable layers having somewhat lower water transmission<br>
rates. Liquid-permeable layer 202 may be made of any suitable material, such as wovens, knits,<br>
perforated films, open-cell foams, melt-blowns, or spunbonds, among others, or combination of<br>
materials, e.g., a woven material coated with a porous open-cell foam, that is liquid and vapor<br>
permeable. Those skilled in the art will appreciate the breadth and variety of materials that may<br>
be used for liquid-permeable layer 202 such that an exhaustive recitation of such materials is<br>
unnecessary for those skilled in the art to understand the broad scope of the present invention.<br>
[0019] For some applications, it is generally preferable, but not necessary, that liquid-<br>
permeable layer 202 be made of a material that can withstand repeated use and continual contact<br>
with a wide variety of surfaces. It may also be preferable for some applications that liquid-<br>
permeable layer 202 be relatively smooth and/or soft so that damage to an object contacted by<br>
liquid-permeable layer 202 may be avoided. An example of a material suitable for liquid-<br>
permeable layer 202 is the K-Too™ un-backed knitted nylon available from HUB Fabric Leather<br>
Company, Inc., Everett, MA. Other suitable materials include polyester mesh Style No. 9864,<br>
available from Fablock Mills, Murry Hill, NJ, and nylon, polypropylene, and other knits that are<br>
available from Fablock Mills Inc., Murry Hill, NJ, Jason Mills Inc., Westwood, N J, and Apex<br>
Mills, Inwood, NY, among others. These few examples of knits are merely several particular<br>
materials the inventors have found suitable. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that<br><br>
suitable non-knit materials are widely available and readily substirutable for the knit materials<br>
mentioned above. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will also readily appreciate that an<br>
exhaustive presentation of exemplary materials is not necessary to understand the broad scope of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0020] Moisture-absorbing layer 206 may include any suitable absorbent material or<br>
combination of materials. For example, moisture-absorbing layer may contain a matrix 210 and<br>
a superabsorbent material 208, e.g., hydrogen, among others, dispersed within the matrix. Those<br>
skilled in the art will understand that many superabsorbent and matrix materials are known and<br>
may be used in conjunction with the present invention. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,051,317<br>
to Brueggemann et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a number of<br>
superabsorbent and matrix materials that may be used within moisture-absorbing layer 206.<br>
Superabsorbent material 208 may be provided as particulate, fiber, or other form, which allows it<br>
to be dispersed throughout matrix 210. Alternatively, superabsorbent material 208 may be<br>
located in a generally discrete layer within matrix 210.<br>
[0021] Examples of acceptable materials for matrix 210 include wool, fiberglass, polymer<br>
fleece, fluff wood pulp, and the like. It is desirable that fiber matrix 210 be hydrophilic and have<br>
a high capillarity, e.g., greater than 10 g/m2-hr (although, lower capillarity rates are encompassed<br>
in the present invention), so that moisture coming into contact with moisture-absorbing layer 206<br>
through liquid-permeable layer 202 may be wicked deep into moisture-absorbing layer 206 to<br>
take advantage of the superabsorbent material located there, if any. Although matrix 210 is<br>
shown, it may be eliminated in an alternative embodiment having superabsorbent material 208 in<br>
a form that need not be supported by, and/or located within, a matrix.<br>
[0022] As mentioned, hydrogei is one example of a class of superabsorbent materials suitable<br>
for superabsorbent material 208, Some forms of hydrogei are capable of absorbing up to<br>
400 times their weight in water. With such a large absorption capability, particles of hydrogei<br>
can swell to many times their original size. If the hydrogei particles are not distributed properly<br>
throughout fiber matrix 210, moisture-absorbing layer 206 may experience "hydroblocking,"<br>
wherein the hydrogei particles closest to the moisture source swell so much that they block<br><br>
moisture from being wicked farther into the fiber matrix. Although some of the absorbed<br>
moisture eventually reaches the hydrogel located deep within matrix 210 by diffusion, diffusion<br>
is a relatively slow process that may degrade the usefulness of a cover experiencing<br>
hydroblocking, particularly in high-moisture conditions. Therefore, it is recommended care be<br>
taken to distribute a hydrogel-type superabsorbent material 208 within matrix 210 in a manner<br>
that minimizes, or eliminates, hydroblocking so that when the superabsorbent material and<br>
matrix adjacent liquid-permeable layer 202 is saturated, the matrix is still able to wick water<br>
deeper into moisture-absorbing layer 206.<br>
[0023] Liquid-impermeable layer 204 may define outer surface 102 of cover 200 and may be<br>
selected to generally prevent liquid in ambient environment 114, such as rain, sea spray, dew,<br>
and the like, from reaching interior regions 116 beneath the cover. It is preferable, but not<br>
necessary, that liquid-impermeable layer 204 be made of one or more vapor-permeable materials<br>
to allow moisture stored in moisture-absorbing layer 206 and/or present in interior regions 116 of<br>
the microenvironment to escape into ambient environment 114 by diffusion and evaporation as<br>
described above. In a typical embodiment, liquid-impermeable layer 204 has a vapor<br>
transmission rate of greater than 1 g/m2-hr, although liquid-impermeable layers with lower vapor<br>
transmission rates may also be employed in certain circumstances.<br>
[0024] The liquid transmission rate through the liquid-impermeable layer 204 should be less<br>
than the employed vapor transmission rate for this layer. For the typical lower bound of 1 g/m2-<br>
hr. of vapor transmission through liquid-impermeable layer 204, a liquid transmission rate<br>
through this layer could be any value less than 1 g/m2-hr. If the vapor transmission rate were<br>
greater, the corresponding acceptable level of liquid transmission would be greater, as long as it<br>
remained less than the vapor transmission rate. By allowing stored moisture to escape,<br>
cover 200 is capable of regenerating itself, i.e., losing previously absorbed and stored moisture to<br>
ambient environment 114, e.g., by evaporation, during periods of low moisture in the ambient<br>
environment so that it may absorb and store more moisture during a subsequent period when<br>
interior regions 116 again become moisture laden. Beneficially, liquid-impermeable layer 204<br>
may also be designed to absorb solar energy to provide heat to cover 200 that accelerates<br>
regeneration of moisture-absorbing layer 206.<br><br>
[0025] Liquid-impermeable layer 204 may comprise any suitable woven or non-woven<br>
material or a combination of the two. As used herein and the claims appended hereto, the term<br>
non-woven shall include any material that is not woven, e.g., a film, knit, foam, felt, melt-blown,<br>
spunbond, air-laid, cast material, extruded material, and molded material, among others. For<br>
example, in one embodiment of cover 200 wherein liquid-impermeable layer 204 is vapor<br>
permeable, the liquid-impermeable layer may include one or more layers of various porous,<br>
vapor-permeable materials, such as a laminate of a 200 denier nylon inner layer and a breathable<br>
urethane outer layer. Such a nylon/urethane laminate is available from LAMCOTEC<br>
Incorporated, Monson, MA. Other suitable porous vapor-permeable materials include expanded<br>
polytetrafluroethylene, GORE-TEX® fabric (W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc., Newark, DE),<br>
SUNBRELLA® fabric (Glen Raven Mills Inc., Glen Raven, NC), Hub Semi-Permeable fabric<br>
(Hub Fabric Leather Company, Everett, MA) or the like, may alternatively be used. Like liquid-<br>
permeable layer 202, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the foregoing examples of<br>
suitable porous, vapor-permeable materials for liquid impermeable layer 204 are merely<br>
representative of the many materials that may be used for this layer. Accordingly, an exhaustive<br>
list of such suitable materials herein is not necessary for those skilled in the art to understand the<br>
broad scope of the present invention.<br>
[0026] In another embodiment of cover 200, liquid-impermeable layer 204 may include a non-<br>
porous, water-vapor-permeable film that allows moisture contained within moisture-absorbing<br>
layer 206 to be transported into ambient environment 114 when conditions are suitable for such<br>
transport to occur. Examples of such non-porous, water vapor permeable films include the<br>
copolyether ester films described in U.S. Patent No. 4,493,870 to Vrouenraets et al., e.g.,<br>
SYMPATEX® film available from SympaTex Technologies GmbH, Wuppertal, Germany, the<br>
copolyether amide films described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,989,697 and 5,744,570, both to<br>
Gebben, and films comprising a tetrafluoroethylene matrix interspersed with sulfonic acid<br>
groups, e.g., NAFION® film available from E.I. DuPont de Nemours Company, Wilmington,<br>
Delaware, among others. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,493,870, 5,989,697, and 5,744,570 are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[0027] Generally, these films are non-porous so that liquid water and other substances cannot<br>
pass through them. It is believed that each of these films works on a molecular level to transport<br>
water molecules from a region on one side of the film having a relatively higher moisture content<br>
to a region on the other side of the film having a relatively lower moisture content by an<br>
addsorption/desorption process within special hydrophilic polymer regions of the film.<br>
Typically, but not necessarily, each of these non-porous, water vapor permeable films would be<br>
continuously bonded, or otherwise attached, to a backing layer that provides support for the film.<br>
This is so because these films are generally very thin, e.g., on the order of tens of microns thick<br>
and, standing alone, would typically not be robust enough for some of the contemplated<br>
applications of cover 200 of the present invention. An example of such a laminated composite is<br>
a 500 denier woven CORDURA® nylon fabric, which has been acid dyed and treated with a<br>
durable water repellent, laminated to a 15 micron thick SYMPATEX® film (CORDURA is a<br>
registered trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, DE). This laminate<br>
is available from Brookwood Companies, Inc., New York, NY.<br>
[0028] In an alternative embodiment, cover 200 may further include a heating<br>
element 212 (FIG. 3) that would allow moisture-absorbing layer 206 to regenerate more quickly<br>
or regenerate when the conditions in ambient environment 114 would otherwise not permit<br>
evaporation of the stored moisture. Such a heating element may comprise an electrical resistance<br>
wire grid located within one of the layers or between adjacent layers. Alternatively, the heating<br>
element may comprise arrays of thin, flexible heating elements consisting of etched-foil resistive<br>
elements laminated between layers of flexible insulation like KAPTON®, NOMEX®, silicone<br>
rubber, or mica, or arrays of thin film ceramic elements available from Minco Products<br>
Incorporation, Minneapolis, MN and Watlow Gordon, Richmond, IL among others (KAPTON®<br>
and NOMEX® are registered trademarks of E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company,<br>
Wilmington, DE). Those skilled in the art will appreciate the variety of heating elements 212<br>
that may be incorporated into cover 200 if this feature is desired.<br>
[0029] In another alternative embodiment, cover 200 may further include a corrosion<br>
inhibitor 214 (FIG. 3) incorporated into one or more of layers of the cover discussed above, into<br>
an additional layer, and/or into one of more corrosion inhibitor sources generally separate from<br><br>
the cover. If one or more separate corrosion inhibitor sources are provided, each may be located<br>
within the microenvironment defined by the cover, e.g., in an interior region 116, or otherwise<br>
placed into communication with the microenvironment so that corrosion inhibitor (214) may<br>
enter the microenvironment and provide protection to metallic object 110 (FIG. 2). Examples of<br>
suitable materials for use as corrosion inhibitor 214 include vapor, or vapor-phase, corrosion<br>
inhibitors (VCIs) (also known as "volatile corrosion inhibitors"), contact corrosion inhibitors,<br>
and migrating corrosion inhibitors, among others. Generally, VCIs are volatile compounds that<br>
emit ions that condense on metallic surfaces to form a mono-molecular layer that interacts with<br>
corrosion agents to protect the surface. Contact corrosion inhibitors generally require surface-to-<br>
surface contact with the object to be protected in order to provide protection (although they may<br>
also migrate from one region to another to some extent). Migrating corrosion inhibitors migrate<br>
through a solid diffusion process. Each of these types of corrosion inhibiting materials is<br>
generally continuously self-replenishing and environmentally benign. These corrosion inhibiting<br>
materials may be used alone or in combination with one another as desired to suit a particular<br>
application.<br>
[0030] Examples of corrosion inhibiting materials include, among others,<br>
cyclohexylammonium benzoate, ethylamino benzoate, calcium sulfonate, calcium carbonate,<br>
sodium benzoate, amine salts, ammonium benzoate, silica, sodium sulfonate, triazole derivatives,<br>
such as toltriazol and benzotriazol, alkali dibasic acid salts, alkali nitrites, such as sodium nitrite,<br>
tall oil imidazolines, alkali metal molybdates, dyclohexylammonium nitrate, cyclohexylamine<br>
carbonate, and hexmethyleneimine nitrobenzoate. These VCIs materials may be obtained from a<br>
number of sources, including Cortec Corporation, St. Paul, Minnesota, Daubert Coated Products<br>
Incorporated, Westchester, Illinois, Poly Lam Products, Buffalo, New York, Mil-Spec Packaging<br>
of Georgia Incorporated, Macon, Georgia, and James Dawson Enterprises Limited, Grand<br>
Rapids, Michigan, among others. U.S. Patent No. 6,028,160 to Chandler et al., which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, lists the foregoing and other compounds that may be suitable<br>
for use as corrosion inhibitor 214.<br>
[0031] As mentioned, corrosion inhibitor 214 may be incorporated into one or more of the<br>
above-described layefs of cover, provided in one or more layers separate from the layers of the<br><br>
cover, or may be provided in a separate corrosion inhibitor source, among other alternative.<br>
When provide as a separate layer, corrosion inhibitor 214 may be incorporated into a coating<br>
applied to one or more of the layers, e.g., one or more of layers 202, 204,206, or incorporated<br>
into a separate layer (not shown), e.g., a separate film, woven, knit, meltblowmelt-blown,<br>
spunbond, foam, or other layer, comprising a suitable vehicle material, such as polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, or nylon, among others. Those skilled in the art will understand how the various<br>
corrosion inhibiting materials may be combined with various resins and other bases for providing<br>
a vehicle for the corrosion inhibiting materials. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,028,160 to<br>
Chandler et al., mentioned above, discusses vehicle resin/VCI blends in the context of<br>
biodegradable polymeric films. Similar formulations may be used for non-biodegradable films.<br>
In addition, a vehicle resin/VCI blend may be used form a structure other than film, such as the<br>
woven, knit, meltblowmelt-blown, spunbond, and foam structures noted above.<br>
[0032] The addition of a corrosion inhibitor 214 to cover 200 can enhance the corrosion<br>
inhibiting ability of the cover by allowing the cover to continue to provide protection when the<br>
moisture-absorbing layer is overwhelmed. When moisture-absorbing layer 206 is present, which<br>
it need not be (see FIGS. 8A-C and accompanying discussion), corrosion inhibitor 214 may<br>
benefit from the presence of the moisture-absorbing layer because this layer removes the burden<br>
from the corrosion inhibitor by not requiring it to offer protection at all times. It is noted that<br>
corrosion inhibitor 214 may be provided to any embodiment of the cover of the present<br>
invention, such as those shown in FIGS. 4-8, and in any form, such as a coating, a separate layer,<br>
incorporation into one or more of the liquid-permeable, moisture-absorbing, and liquid-<br>
impermeable layers, and a separate source, each of which is described herein.<br>
[0033] Layers 202, 204, 206 may be secured to one another in any suitable manner. For<br>
example, these layers may be bonded to one another throughout area 108 of cover 200 in a<br>
manner that does not interfere with its liquid and vapor transport features, yet retains the layers<br>
in physical proximity to one another. Bonding processes known in the art may be used to bond<br>
or join the layers of cover 200. For example, bonding processes such as thermal bonding or<br>
multi-component adhesive bonding may be used. Alternatively, the various layers of cover 200<br><br>
may be secured to one another by other means, such as stitching, or other mechanical fasteners,<br>
e.g., rivets, among others.<br>
[0034] Depending on the size and materials of the cover, it may only be necessary to provide<br>
stitching adjacent peripheral edge 106. In other uses, it may be desirable to provide quilt-<br>
stitching throughout the area. Similarly, bonding may be continuous, only at peripheral edges, or<br>
in a quilted fashion, among others. Of course, various combinations of fastening means may be<br>
used for securing different layers to one another and/or to secure the layers in different regions of<br>
cover 200. For example, liquid-impermeable layer 206 may be secured to moisture-absorbing<br>
layer 206, e.g., by continuous bonding, whereas liquid-permeable layer 202 may be secured to<br>
the bonded combination of the liquid-impermeable and moisture-absorbing layers, e.g., by quilt<br>
stitching in area 108 and by continuous stitching adjacent peripheral edge 106. Those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate the many variations of securing the various layers of cover 200 to one<br>
another such that an exhaustive recitation of all possible securing means need not be described in<br>
detail herein.<br>
[0035] In a further alternative embodiment, liquid-impermeable layer 204 may be removably<br>
secured to the other two layers 202 and 206 to allow it to be removed to speed regeneration of<br>
the moisture-absorbing layer in times of favorable conditions in ambient environment. Re-<br>
fastenable fasteners, such as hook-and-loop fasteners, snaps, zippers and the like, may be<br>
provided to facilitate this feature. Additionally, moisture-absorbing layer 206 may be bonded or<br>
formed via an airlaid process known in the art as a process of producing a nonwoven web of<br>
fibers in sheet form where the fibers are transported and distributed via air flows where the entire<br>
sheet is then set with a mixture of binders and resins.<br>
[0036] FIG. 4 shows another specific embodiment of cover 101 of the present invention, which<br>
is identified by the numeral 300. Cover 300 may comprise the three layers of cover 200 shown<br>
in FIG. 3, i.e., a liquid-permeable layer 302, a liquid-impermeable layer 304 and a moisture-<br>
absorbing layer 306 (these layers being identical, respectively, to layers 202, 204 and 206). In<br>
addition to these layers, cover 300 may further includes a radar-influencing layer 308. Radar-<br>
influencing layer 308 may comprise a radar-absorbing material 310, a radar-reflecting<br><br>
material 312 or a combination of both, depending upon the desired radar profile of cover 300.<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, it may be preferable to have entire area 108 of cover 300 be radar-<br>
attenuating. For example, in a military application it may be necessary to reduce the radar<br>
profile of a large object to conceal its identity. On the other hand, it may be preferable to have<br>
entire area 108 be radar-enhancing. For example, in a civilian application it may be<br>
advantageous to increase the radar profile of a small water craft to accentuate its presence. In<br>
another instance, it may be desirable to provide area 108 with alternating discrete radar-<br>
attenuating, radar-enhancing, and/or radar neutral regions to give cover 300 a custom radar<br>
profile.<br>
[0037] Although radar-influencing layer 308 is shown located between liquid-impermeable<br>
layer 304 and moisture-absorbing layer 306, it may be located elsewhere. For example, the<br>
radar-influencing layer may be located between moisture-absorbing layer 306 and liquid-<br>
permeable layer 304, adjacent outer surface 102 of cover 200, or the like. In addition, radar-<br>
absorbing material 310 and radar-reflecting material 312 may be incorporated into one or more<br>
of liquid- permeable layer 304, moisture-absorbing layer 306, and liquid-permeable layer 302.<br>
Generally, care should be taken, however, to select radar-absorbing and reflecting materials 310,<br>
312 that do not interfere with the vapor and liquid transport features of cover 300.<br>
[0038] Radar-absorbing material 310, may comprise polypyrrole-coated polyester fibers, or the<br>
like, that may be made into a thread that is then woven into a discrete fabric layer or one or more<br>
of layers 302, 304, 306 of cover 300. Such textiles are available from Milliken &amp; Co.,<br>
Spartanburg, South Carolina under the trademark CONTEX®. Alternatively, radar-absorbing<br>
material 310 may comprise discrete particles and/or fibers of carbon, graphite, or the like<br>
dispersed within a fiber matrix or a coating that is applied to one of layers 302, 304, 306, or is<br>
applied to a separate layer that is then incorporated into cover 300. Other examples of radar-<br>
absorbing materials are REX radar-absorbing mats (Milliken &amp; Co., Spartanburg, South<br>
Carolina) and RFWP Weatherproof Foam (R&amp;F Products, Inc., San Marcos, California). Similar<br>
techniques may be used for radar-reflecting material 312, except that a metal, such as silver,<br>
copper, or compounds of such metals, or the like, which may be provided as a thread, discrete<br>
particles, or other form incorporated into cover 300 in any suitable manner.<br><br>
[0039] Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 5, there is shown yet another embodiment of cover 101 of<br>
the present invention, which is identified by the numeral 400. In FIG. 5, cover 400, which may<br>
have the five-layer construction shown, is illustrated with its peripheral edge 106 contacting<br>
surface 112, which may be, e.g., a ship's deck, tarmac, or other similar surface. In such<br>
applications, it can be common for a large amount of liquid water to be absorbed by cover 400 at<br>
regions adjacent peripheral edge 106. This is so because much of the water from ambient<br>
environment 114, such as rain, sea spray, dew and the like, repelled by cover 400 from area 108<br>
travels down the sloping portions of the cover, ending up adjacent peripheral edge 106. To<br>
prevent saturation of cover 400 in regions adjacent peripheral edge 106, additional layers may be<br>
added to the three layer structure of FIG. 3 to provide a separate zone for absorbing and storing<br>
moisture mat may accumulate on surface 112.<br>
[0040] Accordingly, cover 400 may include an outer liquid-impermeable layer 402, a first<br>
moisture-absorbing layer 404, an intermediate liquid-impermeable layer 406, a second moisture<br>
absorbing layer 408, and a liquid-permeable layer 410, which may confront one another in the<br>
recited order as shown. The primary purpose of outer liquid-impermeable layer 402 is to prevent<br>
liquid water, such as rain, sea spray, dew and the like, from penetrating into the<br>
microenvironment, e.g., interior regions 116, beneath cover 400. Outer liquid-impermeable<br>
layer 402 may include a return 412 to provide a seamless, robust structure at peripheral edge 106.<br>
The primary function of first moisture absorbing layer 404 is to absorb and store moisture that<br>
collects on surface 112, whereas the primary function of second moisture absorbing layer 408 is<br>
to absorb and store moisture trapped in the microenvironment beneath cover 400.<br>
[0041] Intermediate liquid-impermeable layer 406 prevents liquid moisture stored in each of<br>
the moisture-absorbing layers from migrating to the other of such layers. At regions adjacent<br>
peripheral edge 106, this separation prevents second moisture-absorbing layer 408 from<br>
becoming overburdened by moisture from surface 112. Preferably, both liquid-impermeable<br>
layers are vapor permeable to allow cover 400 to regenerate passively by losing stored moisture<br>
to ambient environment 114 when conditions there permit.<br><br>
[0042] The peripheral edge of the intermediate liquid-impermeable layer 406 is laterally spaced<br>
from peripheral edge 106 of cover 400 around the entire periphery of the cover to define an<br>
opening 414. When cover 400 is draped over an object, such as metallic block 110, opening 414<br>
may contact, or be slightly spaced from, surface 112, allowing any moisture present on that<br>
surface to be wicked into first moisture-absorbing layer 404. Depending on design parameters,<br>
such as materials selected, volume of moisture to be absorbed, and the like, the width 416 of<br>
opening 414 may be varied accordingly.<br>
[0043] FIGS. 6 and 7 show a cover 500 according to the present invention, wherein the cover is<br>
panelized into a number of discrete panels, each denoted 502 and having an outer surface 504, an<br>
inner surface 506, and a peripheral edge 508. Panels 502 may be removably secured to one<br>
another, and to other panels (not shown) of similar construction, with fasteners 510 located<br>
adjacent peripheral edge 508 of cover 500. Panelization allows cover 500 of the present<br>
invention to be assembled to fit the size and shape necessary for a particular application. To<br>
further enhance customization, one or more of the panels may be formed into a shape other than<br>
the rectangular shapes shown in FIG. 6. Panels 502 may be any size desired to suit a particular<br>
application, with smaller size panels typically, but not necessarily, being used to conform<br>
cover 500 to highly contoured surfaces. For example, for relatively large objects having regions<br>
of high contour, panels 502 may be on the order of 1 ft2 (0.093 m2). Of course, panels 502 may<br>
be larger or smaller depending upon the application, and different panels within cover 500 may<br>
differ in size from one another. Larger panels 502 may be on the order of 100 ft2 (9.290 m2),<br>
1,000 ft2 (92.903 m2), or more.<br>
[0044] Fasteners 510 may be of the hook-and-loop type, which typically includes a flexible<br>
hook strip 512 and a flexible loop strip 514. Hook strip 512 and loop strip 514 may alternately<br>
be secured to outer and inner surfaces 504, 506 adjacent peripheral edge 508 so that when the<br>
peripheral edge of one panel is overlaid the peripheral edge of another panel the hook and loop<br>
strips engage one another to secure the panels to one another. Loop strip 508 may be liquid-<br>
permeable so that its presence does not interfere with the moisture absorbing properties of<br>
cover 500 at its peripheral edge 508. Such hook-and-loop fasteners may be VELCRO® brand<br>
hook-and-loop fasteners (Velcro Industries B.V., Curacao, Netherlands) or the like.<br><br>
Alternatively, other types of fasteners such as buttons, zippers, snaps, hook and eyelet, eyelet and<br>
lacing, among others, may be used for fasteners 504 or the panels may be sewn together.<br>
[0045] In the embodiment shown, each panel 502 comprises a three-layer structure of a liquid-<br>
impermeable outer layer 516, a moisture-absorbing intermediate layer 518 and, a liquid-<br>
permeable inner layer 520, which are identical, respectively, to layers 204, 206, 202 of cover 200<br>
of FIG. 3. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that each panel 502 may have<br>
any other construction, such as the construction of covers 300, 400, and 600, described above<br>
and below. In this connection, each panel 502 may include any combination of layers and/or<br>
features described herein desired to suit a particular application.<br>
[0046] FIG. 8 A shows another cover 600 of protective cover system 100 of the present<br>
invention. Cover 600 may include a water-vapor-permeable layer 602 and at least one corrosion<br>
inhibitor 604. Water-vapor-permeable layer 602 may be made of any suitable porous ox non-<br>
porous water-vapor-permeable material, which includes the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene,<br>
copolyether ester, copolyether amide, and tetrafluoroethylene/sulfonic acid materials described<br>
above in connection with liquid-impermeable layer 204 of cover 200 (FIG. 3), among others. A<br>
non-porous water-vapor-permeable layer 602 may have a functional advantage over conventional<br>
porous liquid-impermeable materials in that not only do these non-porous materials prevent the<br>
passage of liquid water through the layer, but they typically also prevent molecules of corrosion<br>
inhibitor 604 from passing therethrough. Most conventional porous water-vapor-permeable<br>
layers allow at least the smallest molecules of corrosion inhibiting materials to pass through<br>
them.<br>
[0047] Typically, but not necessarily, water-vapor-permeable layer 602 is a relatively thin<br>
layer, often on the order of about 5 microns to about 100 microns, or greater, thick. Such a thin<br>
layer is generally not practicable for use as a stand-alone protective layer, particularly for large<br>
protective covers subject to harsh weather elements. Therefore, cover 600 may also include a<br>
support layer 606, which may be made of a relatively durable and water-vapor-permeable<br>
material to provide a generally robust, but breathable, outer shell. Support layer 606 may be<br>
continuously bonded to liquid-impermeable layer and may be made of any suitable porous<br><br>
material, such as the woven, film, knit, foam, felt, melt-blown, spunbond, cast, extruded, molded,<br>
and expanded materials described above in connection with liquid-permeable layer 202 and<br>
liquid impermeable 204 layer of cover 200 (FIG. 3), among others.<br>
[0048] Corrosion inhibitor 604 may be any one or more corrosion inhibiting materials,<br>
including of the corrosion inhibiting materialsors noted above with respect to corrosion<br>
inhibitor 214 of cover 200. Like corrosion inhibitor 214, corrosion inhibitor 604 may be<br>
provided to cover 600 in any one of a number of ways. For example, FIG. 8A shows corrosion<br>
inhibitor 604 as being incorporated into water-vapor-permeable layer 604. This may be<br>
accomplished, e.g., by adding one or more corrosion inhibiting materials to the resin of water-<br>
vapor-permeable layer 604. Resin/corrosion inhibitor blending is discussed above in the context<br>
of VCIs in connection with cover 200. Similarly, FIG. 8B shows corrosion inhibitor 604 as<br>
being incorporated into an optional liquid- and/or vapor-permeable layer 608 located adjacent the<br>
interior face of water-vapor-permeable layer 602, e.g., by blending one or more corrosion<br>
inhibiting materials with the resin of layer 608. Layer 608 may be attached to layer 602 either<br>
continuously or intermittently, or may not be attached to layer 602 at all, except perhaps at the<br>
outer periphery (not shown) of cover 600.<br>
[0049] FIG. 8C shows corrosion inhibitor 604 as being incorporated into a coating 610 applied<br>
to cover 600, e.g., to water-vapor-permeable layer 602. Depending upon the permeability of<br>
coating 610, the coating may be applied either continuously or intermittently such that water-<br>
vapor-permeable layer 602 can provide its vapor-transport function. Coating 610 may comprise<br>
any one or more of the corrosion inhibiting materials identified above, or other corrosion<br>
inhibiting materials), in a binder suitable for being applied to cover 600 as a coating.<br>
[0050] FIG. 9 shows corrosion inhibitor 604 contained in separate corrosion inhibitor<br>
source 612. Corrosion inhibitor source 612 may be any suitable source, other than<br>
layers 602, 606, 608 and coating 610 described above, for holding and releasing one or more<br>
corrosion inhibiting materials into the microenvironment defined by cover, e.g., regions 116 of<br>
FIG. 2. For example, corrosion inhibitor source 612 may comprise a container 614 and a<br>
closure 616 suitably secured to the container. Closure 616 and/or container 614 may include one<br><br>
or more apertures 618 for allowing corrosion inhibitor 604 to escape therefrom and into the<br>
microenvironment beneath cover 600. Corrosion inhibitor source 612 may be placed anywhere it<br>
may be in communication with the microenvironment, e.g., by placing it in one of interior<br>
regions 116, so that corrosion inhibitor 604 may enter the microenvironment and provide<br>
protection to metallic object 110 (FIG. 2). If desired, corrosion inhibitor source 612 may be<br>
located outside the microenvironment and placed into communication with the<br>
microenvironment using one or more ducts or other conduits (not shown) that communicate with<br>
the microenvironment.<br>
[0051] Depending upon the size of the object to be protected and/or the arrangement of the<br>
microenvironment, e.g., the microenvironment may include interior regions 116 (FIG. 2) not in<br>
fluid communication with one another, more than one corrosion inhibitor source 612 may be<br>
used. Corrosion inhibitor source 612 may optionally be provided with a seal 620 or other means<br>
for opening apertures 618 to allow corrosion inhibitor 604 to escape. Seal 620 may be removed<br>
just prior to corrosion inhibitor source 612 being placed into the microenvironment.<br>
[0052] Like cover 300 of FIG. 4, discussed above, that contains radar-influencing layer 308,<br>
any of the embodiments of cover 600 shown in FIGS. 8A-D may contain a radar-influencing<br>
layer containing one or more radar-reflecting and/or radar-absorbing materials, such as materials<br>
310, 312 mentioned above in connection with cover 300. Such a radar-influencing materials<br>
may be located in any of layers 602, 606, 608, or coating 610, or may be provided in a layer<br>
separate from these layers and located on either side of water-vapor-permeable layer 602. Those<br>
skilled in the art will readily understand how one or more radar influencing materials may be<br>
incorporated into cover 600 such, that a detailed explanation need not be provided in detail<br>
herein.<br>
[0053] In each of the above exemplary embodiments of the cover system of the present<br>
invention, the extent of the various layers was not described with, particularity. For example, the<br>
discussion of moisture absorbing layer 206 in the context of cover 200 and FIG. 3 directed to this<br>
embodiment did not particularly indicate whether or not the moisture-absorbing layer is<br>
coextensive with liquid-permeable layer 202 and/or liquid-impermeable layer 204. As those<br><br>
skilled in the art will appreciate, the various layers of a cover according to the present invention<br>
may be coextensive with the area of the cover, but may also be smaller in area than the cover.<br>
For example, in FIG. 3 just mentioned, moisture-absorbing layer 206 and/or liquid-permeable<br>
layer 202 may extend over only a portion of liquid-impermeable layer 204. In addition,<br>
moisture-absorbing layer 206 and/or liquid-permeable layer 202 may be "discretized" so as to be<br>
present in certain spaced locations that may or may not correspond to particular locations, e.g.,<br>
flat water-retaining surfaces, of the object to be covered.<br>
[0054] Although those skilled in the art will immediately recognize the variety of arrangements<br>
that these discretized locations may have, examples of "regular" arrangements include a<br>
"window-pane" arrangement, wherein rectangular regions of moisture-absorbing and/or liquid-<br>
permeable layers are separated by regions where the materials/characteristics of these layers are<br>
not present, and a "striped" arrangement, wherein the cover includes strips where the<br>
materials/characteristics of the moisture-absorbing and/or liquid-permeable layers are<br>
alternatingly present and not present. This type of discretization of the moisture-absorbing and<br>
liquid-permeable layers is applicable to any embodiment containing such layers. Other layers,<br>
such as a separate corrosion inhibitor layer or a radar-influencing layer, may be discretized in a<br>
similar manner in any embodiment containing such layer(s). Of course, alternatively these<br>
layers, too, may be coextensive with the cover. Similarly, in embodiments wherein a corrosion<br>
inhibitor, radar-influencing material, or other material is incorporated into one or more of the<br>
liquid-impermeable, moisture-absorbing, and/or liquid-permeable layers, as the case may be, the<br>
