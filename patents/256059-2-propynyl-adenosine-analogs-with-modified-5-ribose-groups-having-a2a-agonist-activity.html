This application claims priority from a provisional application entitled:<br>
"2-PROPYNYL ADENOSINE ANALOGS and COMPOSITIONS WITH<br>
MOD1FED S''-RIBOSE GROUPS HAVING A2A AGONIST ACTIVITY", filed<br>
on August 2, 2004, serial number 60/598,018, the entire contents of which is<br>

Government Funding<br>
The invention described herein was made with government support<br>
under Grant Number (RO1-HL37942), awarded by the National Science<br>
Foundation. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The inflammatory response serves the purpose of eliminating harmful<br>
agents from the body. There is a wide range of pathogenic insults that can<br>
initiate an inflammatory response including infection, allergens, autoimmune<br>
stimuli, immune response to transplanted tissue, noxious chemicals, and toxins,<br>
ischemia/reperfusion, hypoxia, mechanical and thermal trauma. Inflammation<br>
normally is a very localized action, which serves in expulsion, attenuation by<br>
dilution, and isolation of the damaging agent and injured tissue. The body''s<br>
response becomes an agent of disease when it results in inappropriate injury to<br>
host tissues in the process of eliminating the targeted agent, or responding to a<br>
traumatic insult<br>
As examples, inflammation is a component of pathogenesis in several<br>
vascular diseases or injuries. Examples include: ischemia/reperfusion injury (N.<br>
G. Frangogiannis et al., in Myocardial Ischemia: Mechanisms, Reperfusion,<br>
Protection, M. Karmazyn, cd, Birkhuser Verlag (1996) at 236-284; H. S.<br>
Sharma et al., Med. of Inflamm., 6,175 (1987)), atherosclerosis (R. Ross,<br>
Thor. Surg., 64,251 (1997); D. I. Walker et al., Brit. J. Surg., 59,609 (1972); R.<br>
L. Pennell et al., J. Vase. Surg., 2, 859 (1985)), and restenosis following balloon<br>
angioplasty (see, R. Ross cited above). The cells involved with inflammation<br>
include leukocytes (i.e., the immune system cells - neutrophils, eosinophils,<br>
lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, raacrophages, dendritic cells, and mast<br>
cells), the vascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and<br>
myocytes.<br>
The release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factoralpha<br>
(TNFa) by leukocytes is a means by which the immune system combats<br>
pathogenic invasions, including infections. TNFa stimulates the expression and<br>
activation of adherence factors on leukocytes and endothelial cells, primes<br>
neutrophils for an enhanced inflammatory response to secondary stimuli and<br>
enhances adherent neutrophil oxidative activity. See, Sharma et al., cited herein.<br>
In addition, macrophages/dendritic cells act as accessory cells processing antigen<br>
for presentation to lymphocytes. The lymphocytes, in turn, become stimulated<br>
to act as pro-inflammatory cytotoxic cells.<br>
Generally, cytokines stimulate neutrophils to enhance oxidative (e.g.,<br>
superoxide and secondary products) and non-oxidative (e.g., myeloperoxidase<br>
*<br>
and other enzymes) inflammatory activity. Inappropriate and over-release of<br>
cytokines can produce counterproductive exaggerated pathogenic effects through<br>
the release of tissue-damaging oxidative and non-oxidative products (K. G.<br>
Tracey et al., J. Exp. Med., 167,1211 (1988); and D. N. Mannel et al., Rev.<br>
Infect. Dis., 9 (suppl. 5), S602-S606 (1987)). For example, TNFa can induce<br>
neutrophils to adhere to the blood vessel wall and then to migrate through the<br>
vessel to the site of injury and release their oxidative and non-oxidative<br>
inflammatory products.<br>
Although monocytes collect slowly at inflammatory foci, given<br>
favorable conditions, the monocytes develop into long-term resident accessory<br>
cells and macrophages. Upon stimulation with an inflammation trigger,<br>
monocytes/macrophages also produce and secrete an array of cytokines<br>
(including TNFa), complement, lipids, reactive oxygen species, proteases and<br>
growth factors that remodel tissue and regulate surrounding tissue functions.<br>
For example, inflammatory cytokines have been shown to be<br>
pathogenic in: arthritis (C. A. Dinarelfo, Semin. Immunol., 4, 133 (1992));<br>
ischemia (A. Seekamp et al., Agents-Actions-Supp., 41,137 (1993)); septic<br>
shock (D. N. Mannel et al., Rev. Infect. Dis., 9 (suppl. 5), S602-S606 (1987));<br>
asthma (N. M. Cembrzynska et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 147,291 (1993));<br>
organ transplant rejection (D. K. Imagawa et al., Transplantation, 51,57 (1991);<br>
multiple sclerosis (H. P. Hartung, Ann. Neural, 33,591 (1993)); AIDS (T.<br>
Matsuyama et al., AIDS, 5,1405 (1991)); and in alkali-burned eyes (P.<br>
Miyamoto et ah, Opthalmic Res., 30,168 (1997)). In addition, superoxide<br>
formation in leukocytes has been implicated in promoting replication of the<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (S. Legrand-Poels et al., AIDS Res. Hum.<br>
Retroviruses, 6,1389 (1990)).<br>
It is well known that adenosine and some analogs of adenosine that<br>
non-selectively activate adenosine receptor subtypes decrease neutrophil<br>
producdon of inflammatory oxidative products (B. N. Cronstein et al., Ann. N.Y.<br>
Acad. Sci., 451,291 (1985); P. A. Roberts et al., Biochem. J., 227,669 (1985);<br>
D. J. Schrieret al., J. Immunol., 137,3284 (1986); B. N. Cronstein et al.,<br>
Clinical Immunol. and Immunopath., 42,76 (1987); M. A. lannone et al., in<br>
Topics and Perspective in Adenosine Research, E. Gerlach et al., eds., Springer-<br>
Verlag, Berlin, p. 286 (1987); S. T. McGarrity et al., J. Leukocyte Biol., 44,<br>
411421 (1988); J. De La Harpe et al., J. Immunol., 143,596 (1989); S. T.<br>
McGarrity et al., J. Immunol., 142, 1986 (1989); and C. P. Nielson et al., Br. J.<br>
Phannacol., 97, 882 (1989)). For example, adenosine has been shown to inhibit<br>
superoxide release from neutrophils stimulated by chemoattractants such as the<br>
synthetic mimic of bacterial peptides, f-met-leu-phe (fMLP), and the<br>
complement component d&amp; (B. N. Cronstein et al., J. Immunol., 135,1366<br>
(1985)). Adenosine can decrease the greatly enhanced oxidative burst of PMN<br>
(neutrophil) first primed with TNF-a and then stimulated by a second stimulus<br>
such as f-meMeu-phe (G. W. SulJivan et al., din. Res., 41,172A (1993)).<br>
Additionally, it has been reported that adenosine can decrease the rate of HIV<br>
replication in a T-cell line (S. Sipka et al., Acta. Biochim. Biopys. Hung., 23,75<br>
(1988)). However, there is no evidence that in vivo adenosine has andinflammatory<br>
activity (G. S. Firestein et al., Clin. Res., 41, 170A (1993); and B.<br>
N. Cronstein et al., Clin. Res., 41,244A (1993)).<br>
It has been suggested that there is more than one subtype of adenosine<br>
receptor on neutrophils that can have opposite effects on superoxide release (B.<br>
N. Cronstein et al., J. Clin. Invest., 85,1150 (1990)). The existence of AZA<br>
receptor on neutrophils was originally demonstrated by Van Calker et al. (D.<br>
Van Calker et al.4 Eur. J. Pharmacology, 206,285 (1991)).<br>
There has been progressive development of compounds that are more<br>
and more potent and/or selective as agonists of AJA adenosine receptors (AR)<br>
based on radioligand binding assays and physiological responses. Initially,<br>
compounds with little or no selectivity for A2A receptors were developed, such as<br>
adenosine itself or 5''-carboxamides of adenosine, such as 5''-Nethylcarboxamidoadenosine<br>
(NECA) (B. N. Cronstein et al., J. Immunol., 135,<br>
1366 (1985)). Later, it was shown that addition of 2-alkylamino substituents<br>
increased potency and selectivity, e.g., CV1808 and CGS21680 (M. F. Jams et<br>
al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then, 251,888 (1989)). 2-Alkoxy-substituted adenosine<br>
derivatives such as WRC-0090 are even more potent and selective as agonists at<br>
the coronary artery AJA receptor (M. Ueeda et al., J. Med. Chem., 34,1334<br>
(1991)). The 2-alklylhydrazino adenosine derivatives, e.g., SHA 211 (also<br>
called WRC-0474) have also been evaluated as agonists at the coronary artery<br>
AaA receptor (K. Niiya et al., J. Med. Chem., 35,4557 (1992)).<br>
There is one report of the combination of relatively nonspecific<br>
adenosine analogs, R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) and 2-chloroadenosine<br>
(Cl-Ado) with a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor resulting in a lowering of<br>
neutrophil oxidative activity (M. A. lannone et al., Topics and Perspectives in<br>
Adenosine Research, E. Garlach et al., eds., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 286-<br>
298 (1987)). However, R-PIA and Cl-Ado analogs are actually more potent<br>
activators of A] adenosine receptors than of AJA adenosine receptors and, thus,<br>
are likely to cause side effects due to activation of AI receptors on cardiac<br>
muscle and other tissues causing effects such as "heart block."<br>
R. A. Olsson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,150) disclose selective<br>
adenosine AI receptor agonists of the formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Rib is ribosyl, R( can be H and R? can be cycloalkyl. The compounds<br>
are disclosed to be useful for treating hypertension, atherosclerosis and as<br>
vasodilators.<br>
Olsson et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,015) disclose certain adenosine A2<br>
receptor agonists of formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein C(X)BR2 can be CH2OH and RI can be alkyl- or alkoxyalkyl. The<br>
compounds are disclosed to be useful as vasodilators or an antihypertensives.<br>
Linden et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,180) is based on the discovery that<br>
certain inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis and asthma, may be effectively<br>
treated by the administration of compounds which are selective agonists of AM<br>
adenosine receptors, preferably in combination with a Type IV<br>
phosphodiesterase inhibitor. An embodiment of the Linden et al. invention<br>
provides a method for treating inflammatory diseases by administering an<br>
effective amount of an ASA adenosine receptor of the following formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R and X are as described in the patent.<br>
In one embodiment, the Linden et al. invention involves the<br>
administration of a Type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor in combination<br>
with the A.2A adenosine receptor agonist. The Type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE)<br>
inhibitor includes racemic and optically active 4-(polyalkoxyphenyl)-2-<br>
pyrrolidones of the following formula:<br>
wherein R'', RIS, R" and X are as disclosed and described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,193,926. Rolipram is an example of a suitable Type IV PDE inhibitor<br>
included within the above formula.<br>
O. Cristalli (U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,975) discloses 2-arylethynyl,<br>
2-cycloalkylethynyl or 2-hydroxyalkylethynyl derivatives, wherein the riboside<br>
residue is substituted by carboxy amino, or substituted carboxy amino<br>
(R3HNC(O». 2-Alkynylpurine derivatives have been disclosed in Miyasaka et<br>
al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,345), wherein the 2-alkynyl group is substituted with<br>
(Cj-Cj6)alkyl. The ''975 compounds are disclosed to be vasodilators and to<br>
inhibit platelet aggregation, and thus to be useful as anti-ischemic, antiatherosclerosis<br>
and anti-hypertensive agents.<br>
Recently, U.S. Patent 6,232,297 to Linden, et al. disclosed compounds<br>
having the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein each R is H, X is ethylaminocarbonyl and R1 is 4-<br>
carboxycyclohexylmethyl (DWH-146a), R1 is 4-<br>
methoxycarbonylcyclohexylmethyl (DWH-l46e) or R1 is 4-acetoxymethylcyclohexylmethyl<br>
(JMR-193). These compounds are reported to be AJA<br>
agonists.<br>
However, a continuing need exists for selective A2 adenosine receptor<br>
agonists useful for therapeutic applications, which have reduced side effects. In<br>
addition, a continuing need exists for selective A2 adenosine receptor agonists<br>
useful for use as pharmacological stressors in stress imaging or in other<br>
ventricular function imaging techniques, that preferably have reduced side<br>
effects, while being chemically stable and short-acting.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention comprises compounds and methods of their use<br>
for the treatment of inflammatory activity in mammalian tissue. The<br>
inflammatory tissue activity can be due to pathological agents or can be due to<br>
physical, chemical or thermal trauma, or the trauma of medical procedures, such<br>
as organ, tissue or cell transplantation, angioplasty (PCTA), inflammation<br>
following ischemia/reperfusion, or grafting. The present compounds comprise a<br>
novel class of 2-alkynyladenosine derivatives, substituted at the ethyn-2-yl<br>
position by substituted cycloalkyl and heterocycle (heterocyclic) moieties.<br>
Preferably, the riboside residue is modified at the 5''-position by substituting an<br>
N-(cyc!oalkyl)carboxyamino ("aminocarbonyr1) moiety ("X") or a 5- or 6-<br>
membered heterocyclic ring. Thus, the present invention provides a method for<br>
inhibiting the inflammatory response in a mammal, such as a human subject, and<br>
protecting the tissue subject to the response, by administering an effective<br>
amount of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>

The invention provides a compound of formula I for use in medical<br>
therapy, preferably for use in treating inflammation or protecting mammalian<br>
tissue from inflammation such as an inflammatory response, e.g., resulting from<br>
allergy, trauma or ischemia/reperftision injury, as well as the use of a compound<br>
of formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an<br>
inflammatory response due to a pathological condition or symptom in a<br>
mammal, such as a human, which is associated with inflammation.<br>
The invention also includes the use of a combination of these<br>
compounds with type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitors to preferably cause<br>
synergistic decreases in the inflammatory response mediated by leukocytes.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
an effective amount of the compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or carrier, and optionally, in combination with a Type IV<br>
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. Preferably, the composition is presented as a<br>
unit dosage form.<br>
Additionally, the invention provides a therapeutic method for<br>
preventing or treating a pathological condition or symptom in a mammal, such as<br>
a human, wherein the activity of AJA adenosine receptors is implicated and<br>
agonism of said receptors is desired, comprising administering to a mammal in<br>
need of such therapy, an effective amount of a compound of formula I, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, it is believed that activation<br>
adenosine receptors inhibits inflammation by affecting neutrophils, mast cells,<br>
monocytes/macrophages, platelets T-cells and/or eosinophils. Inhibition of these<br>
inflammatory cells results in tissue protection following tissue insults.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a therapeutic method for<br>
treating biological diseases that includes the administration of an effective<br>
amount of a suitable antibiotic agent, antifungal agent or antiviral agent in<br>
conjunction with an A2A adenosine receptor agonist. If no anti-pathogenic agent<br>
is known the AM agonist can be used alone to reduce inflammation, as may<br>
occur during infection with antibiotic resistant bacteria, or certain viruses such as<br>
those that cause SARS or Ebola. Optionally, the method includes administration<br>
of a type IV PDE inhibitor. The AU adenosine receptor agonist can provide<br>
adjunctive therapy for treatment conditions such as, the inflammation, caused by<br>
sepsis, for example, human uremic syndrome when administered with antibiotics<br>
in the treatment of bio-terrorism weapons, such as anthrax, tularemia,<br>
Eschcricbia coli, plague and the like. The present invention also provides<br>
adjunctive therapy for treatment of lethal bacterial, fungal and viral infections<br>
such as anthrax, tularemia, escherichia and plague comprising administration of<br>
an antibacterial agent, an antifungal agent or an antiviral agent in conjunction<br>
with selective, AM adenosine receptor agonists.<br>
The present invention provides a therapeutic method for treating<br>
biological diseases that provoke inflammation either alone or in combination<br>
with a disease killing medicine. These include bacteria in combination with<br>
antibiotics, including but not limited to bacteria that cause anthrax, tularemia,<br>
plague, lyme disease and anthrax. Also included are viruses including but not<br>
limited to those that cause RSV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),<br>
influenza and Ebola with or without anti-viral therapy. Also included are yeast<br>
and fungal infections with or without anti-yeast or anti-fungal agents.<br>
The antibacterial agent, antifungal agent or antiviral agent can be coadministered<br>
(e.g., simultaneously) with the A2A adenosine receptor agonist or<br>
they can be can be administered either simultaneously or as a mixture or they<br>
can be administered subsequently. The subsequent administration of the ATA<br>
15<br>
adenosine receptor agonists can be prior to the agent, within minutes or up to<br>
about 48 hours after the administration of the agent Preferably the<br>
administration of the AM adenosine receptor agonists will be within about 24<br>
hours and more preferably within about 12 hours.<br>
The method of the invention will also be useful for treating patients<br>
with sepsis, severe sepsis, and potentially, the systemic inflammatory response<br>
syndrome, in addition to septic shock. The A2*AR agonists exert multiple antiinflammatory<br>
effects early in the inflammatory cascade, and thus a short course<br>
of an A^AR agonists could produce profound benefit in serious, life-threatening<br>
infectious and inflammatory disorders of humans, including inhalational anthrax,<br>
tularemia, escherichia and plague.<br>
The anti-inflammatory effect of A2AAR agonists has been<br>
documented hi vivo, in experimental models of meningitis, peritonitis and<br>
arthritis. The potentially fatal syndrome of bacterial sepsis is an increasingly<br>
common problem in acute care units. Sepsis and septic shock, now the eleventh<br>
leading cause of death in the United States, are increasing in frequency. Current<br>
estimates indicate that about 900,000 new cases of sepsis (approximately 60%<br>
Gram negative) occur in the United States annually with an estimated crude<br>
mortality rate of 35%. Furthermore, the mortality rate, as assessed in recent<br>
clinical trials, is approximately 25%, while approximately 10 % of patients die<br>
from their underlying disease. Shock develops in approximately 200,000 cases<br>
annually with an attributable mortality rate of 46 % (92,000 deaths). Sepsis<br>
accounts for an estimated $ 5-10 billion annually in health care expenditures. It<br>
is now widely appreciated mat among hospitalized patients in non-coronary<br>
intensive care units, sepsis is the most common cause of death. Sepsis syndrome<br>
is a public-health problem of major importance. A^AR agonists are anticipated<br>
to have use as a new and unique adjunctive therapeutic approach to reduce<br>
morbidity and mortality. It is believed that this treatment will improve the<br>
outcome in systemic anthrax, tularemia, escherichia and plague.<br>
The agonists of A2A adenosine receptors of the invention can inhibit<br>
neutrophil, macrophage and T cell activation and thereby reduce inflammation<br>
caused by bacterial and viral infections. The compounds, in conjunction with<br>
antibiotics or antiviral agents can prevent or reduce mortality caused by sepsis or<br>
hemolytic uremic syndrome or other inflammatory conditions. The effects of<br>
adenosine A2A agonists are enhanced by type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitors<br>
such as rolipram.<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an effective amount of the compound of formula (I), or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,, in combination with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluent or carrier. Preferably, the composition is presented as a unit<br>
dosage form, and can be adapted for parenteral, e.g., intravenous infusion.<br>
The invention also provides a compound of formula I for use in<br>
medical therapy (e.g., for use as an adjunct in the treatment of potentially lethal<br>
bacterial infections, such as, anthrax, tularemia, Escherichia, plague, or other<br>
bacterial or viral infections, and treatment of systemic intoxification caused by<br>
bacterial and/or viral infections, as well as the use of a compound of formula I<br>
for the manufacture of a medicament for reducing inflammation caused by the<br>
bacteria or virus or the treatment thereof in a mammal, such as a human. The<br>
compounds of the invention are also useful for treatment of treating systemic<br>
intoxification wherein the bacterial or viral agents cause inflammation either<br>
directly or as a result of treatment, e.g., with an antibiotic or antiviral agent.<br>
Sepsis is a severe illness caused by overwhelming infection of the<br>
bloodstream by toxin-producing bacteria or viruses. The infection, which can<br>
manifest as inflammation, can be caused by the bacteria or virus pathogens<br>
directly or from the treatment thereof, i.e., the death of the pathogens due to<br>
treatment with antibacterial or antiviral agents. Sepsis can be also be viewed as<br>
the body''s response to an infection. The infection can be caused by microorganisms<br>
or "germs" (usually bacteria) invade the body, can be limited to a<br>
particular body region (e.g., a tooth abscess) or can be widespread in the<br>
bloodstream (often referred to as "septicemia" or "blood poisoning")<br>
The systemic intoxification or inflammatory shock is often referred to<br>
as Septic shock; Bacteremic shock; Endotoxic shock; Septicemic shock; or<br>
Warm shock.<br>
Septic shock is a serious, abnormal condition that occurs when an<br>
overwhelming infection leads to low blood pressure and low blood flow. Vital<br>
organs, such as the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver may not function properly or<br>
may fail. Septic shock occurs most often in the very old and the very young. It<br>
also occurs in people with underlying illnesses. Any bacterial organism can<br>
cause septic shock. Fungi and viruses may also cause this condition. Toxins<br>
released by the bacteria, fungi or viruses may cause direct tissue damage, and<br>
may lead to low blood pressure and/or poor organ function. These toxins can<br>
also produce a vigorous inflammatory response from the body, which contributes<br>
to septic shock.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention also provides a method to<br>
treat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), comprising administering to a<br>
mammal in need of said therapy, an effective anti-inflammatory amount of an<br>
agonists of AJA adenosine receptor, optionally with a PDE-IV inhibitor, such as,<br>
rolipnun.<br>
The present invention provides compounds and methods of their use<br>
for detecting the presence of, and assessing the severity of, coronary artery<br>
stenoses in a mammal, such as a human or domestic animal. Preferably, the<br>
compounds of the invention are used as pharmacological stress-inducing agents<br>
or stressors that are useful hi pharmacological stress imaging for the detection<br>
and assessment of coronary artery disease. The specific compounds of the<br>
invention useful as stress-inducing agents are potent and selective at AJA<br>
adenosine receptors, but are also short-acting, so that they are rapidly cleared by<br>
the body following the imaging process.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a method for detecting the<br>
presence and severity of coronary artery stenoses in a mammal, such as a human ''<br>
subject, comprising (1) administering an amount of one or more compounds of<br>
the general formula (I) and (2) performing a technique on said mammal to<br>
detect and/or determine the severity of said coronary artery stenoses.<br>
The invention provides a compound of formula (I) for use in medical<br>
diagnostic procedures, preferably for use in detecting the presence of, and<br>
assessing the severity of, coronary artery stenoses in a human subject. The<br>
present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) for the<br>
manufacture of a pharmacologic vasodilator agent which could be used with<br>
clinical perfusion imaging techniques for diagnosing and assessing the extent of<br>
coronary artery disease. Preferred perfusion imaging techniques are planar or<br>
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) gamma camera<br>
scintigraphy, positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
(NMR) imaging, magnetic resonance inaging (MRI) imaging, perfusion contrast<br>
echocardiography, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and ultrafast X-ray<br>
computed tomography (CINE CT).<br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an effective amount of the compound of formula (I), or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluent or carrier. Preferably, the composition is presented as a unit<br>
dosage form, and can be adapted for parenteral, e.g., intravenous infusion.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The following definitions are used, unless otherwise described. Halo is<br>
fluoro, chloro, brorao, or iodo. Alkyl, alkoxy, aralkyl, alkylaryl, etc. denote both<br>
straight and branched alley! groups; but reference to an individual radical such as<br>
"propyl" embraces only the straight chain radical, a branched chain isomer such<br>
as "isopropyl" being specifically referred to. Aryl includes a phenyl radical or<br>
an ortho-fused bicyclic carbocyclic radical having about nine to ten ring atoms in<br>
which at least one ring is aromatic. Heteroaryl encompasses a radical attached<br>
via a ring carbon of a monocyclic aromatic ring containing five or six ring atoms<br>
consisting of carbon and one to four heteroatoms each selected from the group<br>
consisting of non-peroxide oxygen, sulfur, and N(X) wherein X is absent or is H,<br>
O, (Ci-C4)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, as well as a radical of an ortho-fiised bicyclic<br>
heterocycle of about eight to ten ring atoms derived therefrom, particularly a<br>
benz-derivative or one derived by fusing a propylene, trimemylene, or<br>
tetramethylene diradical thereto.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of<br>
formula (I) have more than one chiral center and may be isolated in optically<br>
active and racemic forms. Preferably, the riboside moiety of formula (I) is<br>
derived from D-ribose. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism. It is to be<br>
understood that the present invention encompasses any racemic, optically-active,<br>
polymorphic, or stereoisotneric form, or mixtures thereof, of a compound of the<br>
invention, which possess the useful properties described herein, it being well<br>
known in die art how to prepare optically active forms (for example, by<br>
resolution of the racemic form by recrystallization techniques, or enzymatic<br>
techniques, by synthesis from optically-active starting materials, by chiral<br>
synthesis, or by chromatographic separation using a chiral stationary phase) and<br>
how to determine adenosine agonist activity using the tests described herein, or<br>
using other similar tests which are well known in the art.<br>
Among the inflammatory responses that can be treated (including<br>
treated prophylactically) with a compound of formula I, optionally with a Type<br>
IV PDE inhibitor, are inflammation due to:<br>
(a) autoimmune stimulation (autoimmune diseases), such as lupus<br>
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, infertility from endometriosis, type I diabetes<br>
mellitus including the destruction of pancreatic islets leading to diabetes and the<br>
inflammatory consequences of diabetes, including leg ulcers, Crohn''s disease,<br>

malaria, bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (AROS),<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lyrne disease, HIV infection,<br>
{TNFo-enhanced HIV replication, TNFa inhibition of reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitor activity);<br>
(e) wasting diseases: cachexia secondary to cancer and HIV;<br>
(f) organ, tissue or cell transplantation (e.g., bone marrow, cornea,<br>
kidney, lung, liver, heart, skin, pancreatic islets) including transplant rejection,<br>
and graft versus host disease;<br>
(g) adverse effects from drug therapy, including adverse effects<br>
from amphotericin B treatment, adverse effects from immunosuppressive<br>
therapy, e.g., interleukin-2 treatment, adverse effects from OKT3 treatment,<br>
contrast dyes, antibiotics, adverse effects from GM-CSF treatment, adverse<br>
effects of cyclosporine treatment, and adverse effects of aminoglycoside<br>
treatment, stomatitis and mucositis due to immunosuppression;<br>
(h) cardiovascular conditions including circulatory diseases<br>
induced or exasperated by an inflammatory response, such as ischemia,<br>
atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, restenosis following angioplasty,<br>
inflammatory aortic aneurysm, vasculitis, stroke, spinal cord injury, congestive<br>
heart failure, hemorrhagic shock, ischemia/reperrusion injury, vasospasm<br>
following subarachnoid hemorrhage, vasospasm following cerebrovascular<br>
accident, pleuritis, pericarditis, and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes;<br>
(i) dialysis, including pericarditis, due to peritoneal dialysis;<br>
(j) gout; and<br>
(k) chemical or thermal trauma due to bums, acid, alkali and the<br>
like.<br>
Of particular interest and efficacy is the use of the present compounds<br>
to limit inflammatory responses where the ischemia/reperrusion injury is caused<br>
by angioplasty or throbolysis. Also of particular interest and efficacy is the use<br>
of the present compounds to limit inflammatory responses due to organ, tissue or<br>
cell transplantation, i.e., the transplantation of allogeneic or xenogeneic tissue<br>
into a mammalian recipient, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions<br>
due to circulatory pathologies and the treatment thereof, including angioplasty,<br>
stent placement, shunt placement or grafting. Unexpectedly, it was found that<br>
administration of one or more compounds of formula (I) was effective after the<br>
onset of the inflammatory response, e.g., after the subject was afflicted with the<br>
pathology or trauma that initiates the inflammatory response.<br>
Tissue or cells comprising ligand bound receptor sites can be used to<br>
measure the selectively of test compounds for specific receptor subtypes, the<br>
amount of bioactive compound in blood or other physiological fluids, or can be<br>
used as a tool to identify potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of<br>
diseases or conditions associated with receptor site activation, by contacting said<br>
agents with said ligand-receptor complexes, and measuring the extent of<br>
displacement of the ligand and/or binding of the agent, or the cellular response to<br>
said agent (e.g., cAMP accumulation).<br>

The preparation of alkynyl cycloalkanols is illustrated in Scheme 1 A.<br>
A solution of an appropriate cycloalkanone (where j is from 0-5) is prepared in a<br>
solvent such as THF. A solution of a suitable ethynylmagnesium halide<br>
compound in a solvent is added to the cycloalkanone. After addition, the<br>
solution is allowed to stir at about 20°C for about 20 hours. The reaction is<br>
monitored via TLC until the starting material is consumed. The reaction is<br>
quenched with water, filtered over a plug of sand and silica, washed with a<br>
solvent, such as EtOAc, and evaporated to provide the product. Typically, two<br>
products are formed, the isomers formed by the axial/equatorial addition of the<br>
alkyne (where m is as defined above, and the sum of ml and m2 is from 0 to<br>
about 7) to the ketone. The compounds are purified via flash chromatography<br>
using EtOAc/Hexanes to provide the product.<br>

addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or<br>
a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to<br>
otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance,<br>
tablets, pills, or capsules maybe coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and<br>
the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose<br>
as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and<br>
flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in<br>
preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and<br>
substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active<br>
compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.<br>
The active compound may also be administered intravenously or<br>
tntraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or<br>
its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant.<br>
Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols,<br>
triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage<br>
and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent (he growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can<br>
include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the<br>
active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in<br>
liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable<br>
under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle<br>
can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water,<br>
ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene<br>
glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable<br>
mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the<br>
formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the<br>
case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosa],<br>
and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the<br>
injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of<br>
agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active<br>
compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the<br>
other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization.<br>
In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions,<br>
the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying<br>
techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional<br>
desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.<br>
For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in<br>
pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to<br>
administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination<br>
with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid, a liquid or in a<br>
dermatologica) patch.<br>
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers<br>
include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the<br>
present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally<br>
with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and<br>
additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a<br>
given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent<br>
pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the<br>
affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.<br>
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and<br>
esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also<br>
be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments,<br>
soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.<br>
Examples of useful dermatological compositions, which can be used to<br>
deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are disclosed in Jacquet et al.<br>
(U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).<br>
Useful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by<br>
comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods<br>
for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans<br>
are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949. Useful dosages<br>
of Type IV PDE inhibitors are known to the art. For example, see, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,877,180, Col. 12.<br>
Generally, the concentration of the compound(s) of formula (I) in a<br>
liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25% wt-%,<br>
preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid<br>
composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably<br>
about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.<br>
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof,<br>
required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected<br>
but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being<br>
treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the<br>
discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.<br>
In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about<br>
0,5 to about 100 jig/kg, eg., from about 10 to about 75 jig/kg of body weight per<br>
day, such as 3 to about 50 ug per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day,<br>
preferably in the range of 6 to 90 ug/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15<br>
to 60 ug/kg/day.<br>
The compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for<br>
example, containing 5 to 1000 ug, conveniently 10 to 750 ug, most conveniently,<br>
50 to 500 ug of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
Ideally, the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak<br>
plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.1 to about lOnM,<br>
preferably, about 0.2 to 10 nM, most preferably, about 0.5 to about 5 nM. This<br>
may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5%<br>
solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a<br>
bolus containing about 1 -100 ug of the active ingredient Desirable blood levels<br>
may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.01-5.0 ug/kg/hr or<br>
by intermittent infusions containing about 0.4-15 ug/kg of the active<br>
ingredient(s).<br>
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as<br>
divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three,<br>
four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, eg.,<br>
into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple<br>
inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the<br>
eye. For example, it is desirable to administer the present compositions<br>
intravenously over an extended period of time following the insult that gives rise<br>
to inflammation.<br>
The ability of a given compound of the invention to act as an AIA<br>
adenosine receptor agonist (or antagonist) may be determined using<br>
pharmacological models which are well known to the art, or using tests<br>
described below.<br>
The present compounds and compositions containing them are<br>
administered as pharmacological stressors and used in conjunction with any one<br>
of several noninvasive diagnostic procedures to measure aspects of myocardial<br>
perfusion. For example, intravenous adenosine may be used in conjunction with<br>
thaliium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging to assess the severity of myocardial<br>
ischemia. In this case, any one of several different radiopharmaceuticals may be<br>
substituted forthallium-201 (e.g., technetium-99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals<br>
(ie: Tc-99m-sestamibi, Tc-99m-teboroxime), iodine-123-labeled<br>
radiopharmaceuticals such as I-123-IPPA or BMIPP, rubidium-82, nitrogen-13,<br>
etc...). Similarly, one of the present compounds may be administered as a<br>
pharmacological stressor in conjunction with radionuclide ventriculography to<br>
assess the severity of myocardial contractile dysfunction. In this case,<br>
radionuclide ventriculographic studies may be first pass or gated equilibrium<br>
studies of the right and/or left ventricle. Similarly, a compound of formula (I)<br>
may be administered as a pharmacological stressor in conjunction with<br>
echocardiography to assess the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities.<br>
Similarly, the active compound may be administered as a pharmacological<br>
stressor in conjunction, with invasive measurements of coronary blood flow such<br>
as by intracardiac catheter to assess the functional significance of stenotic<br>
coronary vessels.<br>
The method typically involves the administration of one or more<br>
compounds of formula (I) by intravenous infusion in doses which are effective to<br>
provide coronary artery dilation (approximately 0.25-500, preferably 1 -<br>
250 mcg/kg/min). However, its use in the invasive setting may involve the<br>
intracoronary administration of the drug in bolus doses of 0.5-50 meg.<br>
Preferred methods comprise the use of a compound of formula (I) as a<br>
substitute for exercise in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging to<br>
detect the presence and/or assess the severity of coronary artery disease in<br>
humans wherein myocardial perfusion imaging is performed by any one of<br>
several techniques including radiopharmaceutical myocardial perfusion imaging<br>
using planar scintigraphy or single photon emission computed tomography<br>
(SPECT), positron emission tomograph (PET), nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
(NMR) imaging, perfusion contrast echocardiography, digital subtraction<br>
angiography (DSA), or ultrafast X-ray computed tomography (CINE CT).<br>
A method is also provided comprising the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) as a substitute for exercise in conjunction with imaging to detect the<br>
presence and/or assess the severity of ischemic ventricular dysfunction in<br>
humans wherein ischemic ventricular dysfunction is measured by any one of<br>
several imaging techniques including echocardiography, contrast<br>
ventriculography, or radionuclide ventriculography. The myocardial dysfunction<br>
can be coronary artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, differences in blood flow<br>
through disease-free coronary vessels and stenotic coronary vessels and the like<br>
A method is also provided comprising the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) as a coronary hyperemic agent in conjunction with means for<br>
measuring coronary blood flow velocity to assess the vasodilatory capacity<br>
(reserve capacity) of coronary arteries in humans wherein coronary blood flow<br>
velocity is measured by any one of several techniques including Doppler flow<br>
catheter or digital subtraction angiography.<br>
The invention will be further described by reference to the following<br>
detailed examples, which are given for illustration of the invention, and are not<br>
intended to be limiting thereof.<br>
Description of Proffered Embodiments<br>
All melting points were determined with a Thomas Hoover capillary<br>
melting point apparatus and are unconnected. Nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
spectra for proton (''H NMR) were recorded on a 300 MHz GE<br>
spectrophotometer. The chemical shift values are expressed in ppm (parts per<br>
million) relative to tetramethylsilane. For data reporting, s = singlet, d =<br>
doublet, t = triplet, q - quartet, and m = multiple!. Mass spectra''were measured<br>
on a Finnigan LcQ Classic. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data<br>
was provided by the Nebraska Center for Mass Spectrometry. Analytical HPLC<br>
was done on a Waters 2690 Separation Module with a Waters Symmetry C8 (2.1<br>
x 150 mm) column operated at room temperature. Compounds were eluted at<br>
200 uL/min with 70:30 acetonitrile:water, containing 0.5% acetic acid, with UV<br>
detection at 214 nm using a Waters 486 Tunable Detector. Preparative HPLC<br>
was performed on a Shimadzu Discovery HPLC with a Shim-pack VP-ODS C|g<br>
(20 x 100 nun) column operated at room temperature. Compounds were eluted<br>
at 30mL/min with a gradient 20-80% of water (containing 0.1% TFA) to<br>
methanol over 15 minutes with UV detection at 214 nm using a SPD10A VP<br>
Tunable detector. AH final compounds presented here were determined to be<br>
greater than 98% pure by HPLC. Flash chromatography was performed on<br>
Silicyle 60A gel (230-400 mesh) or using reusable chromatography columns and<br>
system from RT Scientific, Manchester NH. Analytical thin-layer<br>
chromatography was done on Merck Kieselgel 60 F254 aluminum sheets.<br>
Preparative thin-layer chromatography was done using 1000 micron Analtech<br>
Uniplate with silica gel. All reactions were done under a nitrogen atmosphere in<br>
flame-dried glassware unless otherwise stated.<br>
General method 1: Preparation of alkynyl cyclohexanols<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
To a solution of 10 mmol of the appropriate cyclohexanone in 50 mL of THF<br>
was added 60 mL (30 mmol) of 0.5 M ethynylmagnesium bromide in THF. The<br>
solution was allowed to stir at 20°C for 20 h, at which time TLC indicated that<br>
all the starting material had been consumed. The reaction was quenched with 5<br>
mL of water, filtered over a plug of sand and silica, washed with EtOAc, and<br>
evaporated to yield a yellow oil usually containing two spots on TLC w/ 20%<br>
EtOAc/Hexanes which were visualized with Vanillin. These two products were<br>
usually the different isomers formed by the axial/equatorial addition of the<br>
alkyne to the ketone. The compounds were purified via flash chromatography<br>
using 10% EtOAc/Hexanes to yield clear oils or white solids in 50-80% yields.<br>
General method 2: Preparation of propargyl piperadines and piperazines.<br>

stabilized in toluene) and 50.0 mmol of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The<br>
reaction mixture was filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken<br>
up in 50 mL of dichlorom ethane/water and the organic removed. The aqueous<br>
was washed with an additional 3 x 25 mL dichloromethane. The organic was<br>
then dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to yield<br>

General method 3: Preparation of modified piperadines and piperazines.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
To 100 mg of the appropriate Boc-protected piperazine or piperadine,<br>
JR3275/JR3255 respectively, was added 2-4 mL of neat TFA. The solution was<br>
allowed to stir for 6 hours, after which time the TFA was removed under reduced<br>
pressure to yield a yellow oil. This oil was taken up in 10 mL of<br>
dichloromethane to which was added 10-fold excess of TEA and 3 equivalents<br>
of the appropriate electrophile. The yellow solution was allowed to stir at r.t. for<br>
12 hours, after which time the solvents were removed and the product purified<br>
using a 1.1x3 Ocm 14 g RTS1 column with a 5%-30% gradient of ethyl<br>

OH OH<br>
A flame dried 25 mL round bottom under nitrogen was charged with 2-<br>
lodo adenosine analog (40 mg) and dissolved in 2 mL of DMF. The appropriate<br>
alkyne (approx 0.1 mL) was then added followed by 4mL of acetonitrile and<br>
O.lmL of TEA. AH three solvents had been degassed with nitrogen for at least<br>
24 hours. To this solution was added 5 mole percent Pd(PPh3)4 and 6 mole %<br>
copper iodide. The yellowish solution was allowed to stir for 24 hours at room<br>
temperature, or until complete by HPLC. If the reaction was not complete at mis<br>
time, additional catalyst, Cul, and TEA were added. After the reaction was<br>
complete, the solvents were removed under high-vacuum and the red/black<br>
residue taken back up in a small amount of DMF. This solution was added to a<br>
preparative silica TLC plate (Analtech 1 000 microns, 20cm x. 20cm) and eluted<br>
first with 120 mL of 40% Hexanes/CH2Cl2, and then again after addition of 40<br>
mL of MeOH. The UV active band (usually yellow in color) in the middle of the<br>
plate is collected, slowly washed with 4 x 25 mL 20% MeOH/CH2Cl2, and<br>
concentrated. This product is then purified by RP-HPLC to yield solids after<br>
trituration with anhydrous ethyl ether.<br>

A 3-neck 250 mL-flask equipped with a gas inlet tube and dry-ice<br>
condenser was cooled to -78 °C and charged with liquid ammonia (40 mL). To<br>
the reaction mixture was added lithium wire (600 mg, 86.4 mmol) generating a<br>
deep blue solution. The mixture was allowed to stir for 1 hour. Acetylene,<br>
passed through a charcoal drying tube, was added to the ammonia until all the<br>
lithium had reacted and the solution turned colorless, at which time the flow of<br>
acetylene was stopped, the acetylene-inlet tube and condenser removed and the<br>
flask outfitted with a thermometer. DMSO (20 mL) was added and the ammonia<br>
evaporated with a warm water bath until the mixture reached a temperature of<br>
30 °C. The solution was stirred at this temperature for 2 hours until the solution<br>
stopped bubbling. The mixture was cooled to 5 °C and compound 84 (11.25 g,<br>

5 °C. The mixture was allowed to stir at 5 °C for 0.5 hours. Then the solution<br>
was gradually wanned to room temperature and stirred for an additional 18<br>
hours. The brown/black reaction mixture was poured slowly over ice (300 g)<br>
and extracted with ether (4 x 100 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and<br>
concentrated in vacuo to yield a yellow oil. The oil was subsequently dissolved<br>
in THF (200 mL) and changed to a brownish color upon addition of TBAF<br>
hydrate (11.20 g, 35.5mmol). The solution was allowed to stir for 24 hours<br>

Sf9 cells were cultured in Grace''s medium supplemented with 10%<br>
fetal bovine serum, 2.5 ng/rol amphotericin B and SO ng/ml gentamycin in an<br>
atmosphere of 50% N2/50% O2. Viral infection was performed at a density of<br>
2.5x106 cells/mL with a multiplicity of infection of two for each virus used.<br>
Infected cells were harvested 3 days post-infection and washed twice in insect<br>
PBS (PBS pH 6.3). Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES<br>
pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, ImM jJ-mercaptoethanol (BME), 5ug/mL<br>
leupeptin, 5ug/mL pepstatin A, 1 jig/mL aprotinin, and O.lmM PMSF) and snap<br>
frozen for storage at - 80°C. Cells were thawed on ice, brought to 30 mL total<br>
volume in lysis buffer, and burst by N2 cavitation (600 psi for 20 minutes). A<br>
low-speed centrifugation was performed to remove any unlysed cells (1000 x g<br>
for 10 minutes), followed by a high-speed centrifugation (17,000 x g for 30<br>
minutes). The pellet from the final centrifugation was homogenized in buffer<br>
containing 20 mM HEPES pH 8, lOOmM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 2 ug/mL<br>
leupeptin, 2 u.g/mL pepstatin A, 2 ng/mL Aprotinin, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 10 ^M<br>
ODP using a small glass homogenizes followed by passage through a 26 gauge<br>
needle. Membranes were aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid N2, and stored at<br>
-80°C. Membranes from cells stably expressing the human At AR (CHO Kl<br>
cells) or A3 AR (HEK 293 cells) were prepared as described (Robeva et al.,<br>
19%).<br>
Example 6:Radioligand Binding Assays.<br>
Radioligand binding to recombinant human A2A receptors in Sf9 cell<br>
membranes was performed using either the radio labeled agonist,l2SI-APE<br>
(Luthin et al., 1995) or the radio labeled antagonist, 12SI-ZM241385 (12S1-ZM).<br>
To detect the high affinity, GTPyS-sensitive state of AI and AaAR, we used the<br>
agonist, I25I-ABA (Linden et al., 1985;Linden et al., 1993). Binding<br>
experiments were performed in triplicate with 5 ng (AJA) or 25 ng (A| and Aj)<br>
membrane protein in a total volume of 0. ImL HE buffer (20 mM HEPES and 1<br>
mM EDTA) withl U/mL adenosine deaminase and 5 mM MgClj with or without<br>
SO u.M GTPyS. Membranes were incubated with radioligands at room<br>
temperature for three hours (for agonists) or two hours (for antagonists) in<br>
Millipore Multiscreen''9 96-well GF/C filter plates and assays were terminated by<br>
rapid filtration on a cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) followed by 4 x<br>
150 u.1 washes over 30 seconds with ice cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,10 mM<br>
MgC^. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 50 uM NECA.<br>
Competition binding assays were performed as described (Robeva et al., 1996)<br>
using 0.5-1 nM 12SI-APE, I25I-ZM241385, or I2SI-ABA. We found that it was<br>
sometimes important to change pipette tips following each serial dilution to<br>
prevent transfer on tips of potent hydrophobic compounds. The Ki values for<br>
competing compound binding to a single site were derived from IC50 values with<br>
correction for radioligand and competing compound depletion as described<br>
previously (Linden, 1982).<br>

Chemiluminescence Methods: Luminol enhanced chemiluminescence,<br>
a measure of neutrophil oxidative activity, is dependent upon both superoxide<br>
production and mobilization of the granule enzyme myeloperoxidase. The light<br>
is emitted from unstable high-energy oxygen species such as hypochlorous acid<br>
and singlet oxygen generated by activated neutrophils.<br>
Purified human neutrophils (2 X 106/ml) suspended in Hanks balanced<br>
salt solution containing 0.1% human serum albumin (HA), adenosine deaminase<br>
(lU/mL) and rolipram (100 nM) were incubated (37°C) in a water bath for 15<br>
min with or without rhTNF(10U/ml). Following incubation 100 L aliquots of the<br>
PMN were transferred to wells (White walled clear bottom 96 well tissue<br>
culture plates Costar #3670; 2 wells /condition) containing 501 HA and luminol<br>
(final concentration 100 M) with or without adenosine agonist (final agonist<br>
concentrations 0.01-1000 nM). The plate was incubated 5 min (37°C) and then<br>
fMLP (501 in HA; final concentration 1M) was added to all wells.<br>
Peak chemiluminescence was determined with a Victor 1420<br>
Multilabel Counter in the chemiluminescence mode using the Wallace<br>
Workstation software. Data are presented as peak chemiluminescence as percent<br>
of activity in the absence of an adenosine agonist. The EC$o was determined<br>
using PRISM software. All compounds were tested with PMNs from three<br>
separate donors. The results are summarized in Table 5.<br>

A. Materials.<br>
f-met-leu-phe (fMLP), luminol, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome C,<br>
fibrinogen, adenosine deaminase, and trypan blue were obtained from Sigma<br>
Chemical. FicoU-hypaque was purchased from 1CN (Aurora, OH), and Cardinal<br>
Scientific (Santa Fe, NM) and Accurate Chemicals and Scientific (Westerbury,<br>
NY). Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; E. coli K235) was from List Biologicals<br>
(Campbell, CA). Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS), and limulus amebocyte<br>
lysate assay kit were from BioWittaker (Walkersville, MD). Human serum<br>
albumin (HSA) was from Cutter Biological (Elkhart, IN). Recombinant human<br>
tumor necrosis factor-alpha was supplied by Dianippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.<br>
(Osaka, Japan). ZM241385(4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[U,4]-<br>
triazoIo[2,3-a][l,3,5]triazin-5-yl amino]ethyl)phenol) was a gift from Simon<br>
Poucher, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, UK. Stock solutions (1 mM and 10<br>
mM in DMSO) were made and stored at -20°C.<br>
B. Human neutrophil preparation<br>
Purified neutrophils (-98% neutropbils and &gt;95% viable by trypan<br>
blue exclusion) containing 
endotoxin (limulus amebocyte lysate assay) were obtained from normal<br>
heparinized (10 U/ml) venous blood by a one step Ficoll-hypaque separation<br>
procedure (A. Ferrante et al., J. Immunol. Meth.. 36,109 (1980)).<br>
C. Release of inflammatory reactive oxygen species from primed and stimulated<br>
human neutrophils Chemiluminescence<br>
Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, a measure of neutrophil<br>
oxidative activity, is dependent upon both superoxide production and<br>
mobilization of the lysosoma] granule enzyme myeloperoxidase. The light is<br>
emitted from unstable high-energy oxygen species generated by activated<br>
neutrophils. Purified neutrophils (5-10 * 105/ml) were incubated in Hanks<br>
balanced salt solution containing 0.1% human serum albumin (1 ml) with the<br>
tested AJA agonist with or without rolipram and with or without tumor necrosis<br>
factor-alpha (1 U/ml) for 30 minutes at 37°C in a shaking water bath. Then<br>
luminol (1 * Iff4 M) enhanced f-met-leu-phe (I mcM) stimulated<br>
chemiluminescence was read with a Chronolog® Photometer (Crono-log Corp.,<br>
Havertown, PA) at 37°C for 2-4 minutes. Chemiluminescence is reported as<br>
relative peak light emitted (= height of the curve) compared to samples with<br>
tumor necrosis factor-alpha and without agonist or rolipram.<br>
Example 8. In vivo rat blood pressure experiments.<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats (mean weights, 250-300 grams) were<br>
anthesthetized and jugular and carotid catheters are implanted ipsilaterally and<br>
the animals are allowed to recover 24-48 hours. Prior to each experiment a<br>
baseline blood pressure reading is established for 30 minutes with each drug<br>
injection being preceded by a vehicle control. Drugs are injected bolus I.V.<br>
through a jugular catheter in a 200 microliter volume of saline and the catheter is<br>
flushed with an additional 300 microliters of saline. To measure blood pressure,<br>
a central line from the carotid catheter is attached to the pressure transducer of a<br>
Digi-Med Blood Pressure Analyzer. Systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean<br>
pressure, and heart rate are all recorded in real time at 30-60 second intervals.<br>
Data is recorded until mean blood pressure has returned to baseline and<br>
remained constant for 20 minutes. The data is presented as a fraction of the<br>
mean blood pressure averaged over the 10 minutes immediately prior to drug<br>
injection. The blood pressures are recorded and plotted over time as a means of<br>
determining potency of the compounds as well as biological half-life.<br>
