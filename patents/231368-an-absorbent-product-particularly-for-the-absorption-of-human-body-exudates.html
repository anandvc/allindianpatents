				<td>"ABSORBENT PRODUCT"<br>
The present invention refers to an absorbent product<br>
particularly for the absorption of human body<br>
exudates, such as, for example, disposable diapers,<br>
diapers for geriatric use, sanitary napkins, or breast<br>
protectors, which are provided with a<br>
coating/backsheet external layer, which is soft,<br>
agreeable to touch and comfortable, aiming at<br>
increasing the wearer's satisfaction and consequently<br>
the penetration of the product in the market, without<br>
increasing its manufacturing cost and its cost to the<br>
client.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Conventionally, the absorbent products for the<br>
containment and absorption of human body exudates,<br>
such as disposable diapers, diapers for geriatric use,<br>
sanitary napkins, breast protectors, among others, are<br>
structured so as to present, basically: (i) a first<br>
external layer, which contacts the wearer's<br>
undergarment and which is impermeable at least to<br>
liquids; (ii) a second permeable internal layer, which<br>
will contact the wearer's body; and (iii) a third<br>
layer made of absorbent material (hereinafter<br>
denominated absorbent core), which absorbs and<br>
accumulates the body exudates and which is located<br>
between the first and second layers..<br>
In most of these absorbent products, notably in the<br>
disposable diapers, geriatric diapers and sanitary<br>
napkins, the first external layer comprises a film of<br>
polymeric material, preferably polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene, which is impermeable to liquids and<br>
avoids the body exudates stored in the absorbent core<br>
from leaking and reaching the wearer's undergarment.<br>
This film of polymeric material receives additives so<br>
as to present desirable properties, notably regarding<br><br>
feel, softness and quietness when deformed, in order<br>
to present characteristics that make the product<br>
attractive. Some additives . used in the films of<br>
polymeric material are calcium carbonate, magnesium<br>
carbonate, calcium sulfate, other sulfates, and<br>
titanium dioxide, among others.<br>
Several improvements have been developed over the<br>
years, aiming at improving the characteristics of the<br>
plastic films to be used in absorbent products, in<br>
order to make them more attractive.<br>
In this sense, US patent 4,285,100 discloses a process<br>
and equipment to stretch/elongate a non-woven web made<br>
of synthetic fibers, in order to maximize its<br>
mechanical resistance properties.<br>
The idealized equipment comprises a first station<br>
provided with at least one pair of rolls having<br>
longitudinal grooves and at least one pair of rolls<br>
having transverse grooves, besides auxiliary rolls,<br>
whose function is to avoid slippage of the web in<br>
relation to the rolls. This web is uniformly deformed<br>
or affected through the whole extension thereof,<br>
presenting as a final result a considerable<br>
dimensional increase in its width and length, with the<br>
consequent reduction of its density.<br>
Accordingly, US patent 4,368,565 discloses a grooved<br>
roll and an equipment provided with such grooved<br>
rolls, the rolls comprising a plurality of disks with<br>
two distinct diameters, which are alternatively<br>
disposed so that two disks of larger diameter are<br>
disposed on each side of a disk of smaller diameter,<br>
forming said grooves.<br>
The rolls with this configuration allow stretching<br>
orientable thermoplastic substrates, thus making<br>
possible to achieve the desired behavior<br>
characteristics of these materials.<br><br>
US patent 5,296,184, on its turn, discloses a method<br>
to manufacture an ultra-soft and quiet embossed<br>
plastic film presenting a cotton-like feel, which<br>
characteristics are obtained by producing a plurality<br>
of post-embossing stretching areas that are uniformly<br>
positioned along the length and width of the plastic<br>
film. The stretched areas are thinner than the<br>
unstretched areas.<br>
Still in relation to the patent cited above, the<br>
resulting film (which is initially embossed) may<br>
present several compositions and additives, and the<br>
protective scope of said invention is directed to the<br>
manufacturing process of this embossed and stretched<br>
final film.<br>
This patent, however, does not disclose the processing<br>
of a film of polymeric material which is initially not<br>
embossed since, as mentioned above, this initial<br>
characteristic was fundamental for the product to<br>
present the desired softness.<br>
Finally, US patent 6,258,308 discloses a process to<br>
adjust the capacity of water vapor transmission<br>
(WVTR), and other properties of a polyolefin film,<br>
rendering said film gas permeable.<br>
According to said patent, the film is processed in a<br>
equipment provided with at least one pair of rolls<br>
having longitudinal circular projections and which are<br>
at least slightly heated, so that the film, upon<br>
contacting said rolls, is heated and extended so. as to<br>
form a permanently stretched gas permeable film.<br>
Thus, this patent does not disclose a stretching with<br>
rupture of the material, but solely the thermo-<br>
deformation of the molecules, with molecular<br>
alignment, in such a way that the film becomes gas<br>
permeable.<br>
As it can be learned from the analysis of these well<br><br>
known prior art techniques, it has not been achieved<br>
heretofore an absorbent product, particularly for the<br>
absorption of human body exudates, such as disposable<br>
diapers, sanitary napkins, or breast protectors<br>
presenting an external layer composed of a film of<br>
plastic material, preferably a generally impermeable<br>
multiplayer film, Which has been stretched in a -way to<br>
present a smoother and softer feel similar to silk,<br>
besides presenting improved flexibility properties and<br>
quietness when deformed.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide<br>
an absorbent product, particularly for the absorption<br>
of human body exudates, such as disposable diapers,<br>
diapers for geriatric use, sanitary napkins, or breast<br>
protectors, presenting an external layer made of a<br>
polymeric film, which is stretched so as to present a<br>
very soft feel, flexibility and quietness when<br>
deformed, giving to the product an impression of<br>
quality, which increases the acceptance of the<br>
product, consequently resulting in a higher<br>
penetration of the product in the market.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
The objectives of the present invention are achieved<br>
by an absorbent product, particularly for the<br>
absorption of human body exudates, comprising a first<br>
external layer and a second layer, the second layer<br>
facing the discharge region of the exudates and the<br>
first layer being positioned opposite to the second<br>
layer, the first layer being made of at least one film<br>
of polymeric material having a single apparent<br>
density, the film presenting at least one stretched<br>
region positioned adjacent to at least two unstretched<br>
regions, the stretched region being obtained by the<br>
first layer being passed and stretched through at<br><br>
least one stretching device.<br>
The present invention has the advantages of providing<br>
an absorbent product which presents characteristics of<br>
feel, softness, flexibility, and comfort much higher<br>
than those of the prior art products, significantly<br>
increasing its sales and market penetration potentials<br>
in relation to the known absorbent products.<br>

Detailed Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
According to a preferred embodiment and as illustrated<br>
in Fig.l, the absorbent product 1 of the present<br><br>
invention, which is particularly idealized for the<br>
absorption of human body exudates, generally comprises<br>
a first external layer, hereinafter denominated<br>
backsheet 2, and a second internal layer, hereinafter<br>
denominated topsheet 3, which are disposed parallel to<br>
each other and between which is provided an absorbent<br>
element or core 4, which functions to absorb and<br>
retain the body exudates in its interior, avoiding<br>
leakages to the wearer's clothes. Although figure 1<br>
shows a disposable diaper, the absorbent product 1 may<br>
assume any other configuration.<br>
The backsheet 2 is the one turned to the wearer's<br>
clothes when he/she is using the absorbent product 1,<br>
while the topsheet 3 is the one that contacts his/her<br>
body and directly receives the discharge (s) of body<br>
exudates.<br>
The topsheet 3, therefore, due to its positioning,<br>
must be liquid permeable, allowing the exudates to be<br>
conducted to the absorbent core 4, where said exudates<br>
will be stored and prevented from leaking. In this<br>
sense, it is evident that the faster the topsheet 3<br>
allows the body exudates to pass towards the absorbent<br>
core 4, the more efficient the absorbent product will<br>
be.<br>
The main materials used to manufacture topsheets 3 are<br>
permeable woven or non-woven fabrics, which may<br>
contain polymeric fibers, although it is also possible<br>
to use a plastic film presenting characteristics of<br>
permeability, notably obtained by perforations.<br>
However, the topsheet 3 of the absorbent product 1<br>
disclosed herein may present any composition, as this<br>
is not the objective of the present invention.<br>
The absorbent core 4, which is not the objective of<br>
the present invention, either, must consist of a<br>
substance or a group of substances which allow<br><br>
absorbing and storing a large quantity of liquid<br>
exudates, in order to guarantee that no leakages to<br>
the outside of the absorbent product will occur, even<br>
after successive discharges. Preferably, said group of<br>
absorbent substances comprises cellulose pulp, due to<br>
its suitable properties, however it being understood<br>
that super absorbent elements, or other components,<br>
such as for example turf moss, may be used.<br>
The backsheet 2, on its turn, is made of an<br>
impermeable material, generally a polymeric material,<br>
preferably plastic, for preventing the exudates<br>
retained in the absorbent core 4 from reaching the<br>
wearer's clothes somehow. Preferably, the backsheet 2<br>
consists of a polyethylene film, which can receive<br>
additives according to the desired properties to be<br>
obtained, however it should be understood that any<br>
other films might be used, provided that they are<br>
functional and capable of being stretched, as<br>
described below. As a viable alternative to the use of<br>
a polyethylene film, we can mention the films made of<br>
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), among others.<br>
The preferential utilization of the polyethylene film<br>
is due to its low manufacturing cost and compliance<br>
with the working requirements of the backsheet 2.<br>
As an example of additives, we can mention calcium<br>
carbonate (CaCo3), which renders breathability to the<br>
polyethylene film, i.e., the capacity of being gas<br>
permeable (breathability), but continuing to be liquid<br>
impermeable. Such breathability is achieved, since the<br>
CaCo3 granules present a considerable difference of<br>
elasticity in relation to the film, and when the<br>
latter is stretched, micro-ruptures occur around said<br>
granules.<br>
The percentage of calcium carbonate, or other additive<br><br>
that is added to the film, is determined by the<br>
desired properties and these values are not included<br>
in the protective scope of the present invention, as<br>
they can vary considerably. As a rule, additives are<br>
also used to impart higher smoothness to the film<br>
surface and to reduce the noise when it is folded or<br>
squeezed, which characteristics are desired by the<br>
purchasers of absorbent products in general.<br>
Independently of the basic composition of the film<br>
that forms the backsheet 2, said film can have a<br>
single layer or multiple layers, in which case it<br>
comprises several superposed layers of films with<br>
distinct properties, forming a main single film 20,<br>
whose properties are more workable as compared to the<br>
single layer.<br>
The multilayer film 20 is more adequate to be used as<br>
a backsheet 2, since it continues to maintain its<br>
liquid impermeability property even after being<br>
stretched, by reasons that will be described in more<br>
details below. In the preferred embodiment, a<br>
polyethylene multilayer film 20 with five layers,<br>
commonly known as A B C B A film with three<br>
formulations, is used.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the film comprises the following layers:<br>
•	LAYERS A (external) : made of low density<br>
polyethylene (LDPE) and linear medium density<br>
polyethylene (LMDPE).<br>
•	LAYERS B (intermediate): made of linear low density<br>
polyethylene catalyzed with metallocene (M-LLDPE) and<br>
low density polyethylene (LDPE), and which may have<br>
percentage variations in the relation between these<br>
two components.<br>
•	LAYER C (central): made of linear low density<br>
polyethylene catalyzed with metallocene (M-LLDPE) and<br><br>
low density polyethylene (LDPE), and which may have<br>
percentage variations in the relation between these<br>
two components and present percentages different from<br>
those presented by. layers B.<br>
In relation to layers A, it should be noted that the<br>
low density polyethylene (LDPE) is soft and rubbery,<br>
whereas the linear medium density polyethylene (LMDPE)<br>
presents higher rigidity. Thus, the ideal compromise<br>
between softness and flexibility and resistance is<br>
achieved in this layer, making it suitable to the<br>
intended use. The balance of the two components allows<br>
said layers to further present interesting<br>
characteristics regarding slip properties (measured by<br>
COF, coefficient of friction).<br>
The layers B present as main characteristic a higher<br>
flexibility in relation to the layers A, since they do<br>
not have linear medium density polyethylene (LMDPE).<br>
The use of melallocene provides a more sticky and<br>
flexible characteristic to the linear low density<br>
polyethylene (M-LLDPE), which helps maintain the<br>
integrity between the several layers of the film 20,<br>
reducing the tendency to occur shearing movements<br>
therebetween. Obviously, the quantity of (M-LLDPE) in<br>
relation to the quantity of LDPE may be manipulated so<br>
as to make these layers and the film 20 present the<br>
desired resistance and flexibility properties. The<br>
comments above are also valid to layer C, whose<br>
composition has the same components, although the<br>
ratio between them, may differ.<br>
Finally, to the film 20 used is added a concentrated<br>
compound of titanium dioxide (Ti02) (a Ti02<br>
masterbatch) with a carrier in low density<br>
polyethylene (LDPE). Titanium dioxide is used owing to<br>
its matting properties, eliminating the film<br>
transparence or translucency. Evidently, its use is<br><br>
optional.<br>
Several additives, such as dyes for example, may be<br>
used.<br>
It should also be noted that the multilayer film may<br>
further present basic compositions distinct from those<br>
mentioned above for each layer and, therefore, a great<br>
variety of different products can be used, according<br>
to the desired properties.<br>
Whatever the film chosen to be used, it must be<br>
stretched before the fabrication of the absorbent<br>
product 1, in order to guarantee the above-mentioned<br>
desired properties of softness and smoothness.<br>
Prior to the stretching, the polymeric film 20<br>
presents its molecules substantially and homogenously<br>
dispersed, i.e., there is no region in this film in<br>
which the molecules are differently arranged in<br>
relation to other molecules, for example, as it would<br>
occur in the case of an embossed film that is thermo-<br>
deformed in specific regions, or in any other possible<br>
situation. Therefore, the film 20 presents only one<br>
apparent density.<br>
The stretching is carried out in a stretching<br>
equipment with at least one pair of stretching<br>
elements 10 in the form of rolls that are positioned<br>
parallel and adjacent to each other.<br>
Each roll 10 comprises a plurality of projections 11<br>
that are responsible for stretching the film 20.<br>
Preferably, these projections 11 present a<br>
substantially annular form and are positioned<br>
concentrically to the roll and adjacent to each other,<br>
so that two concentric projections define an annular<br>
space or gap 12 therebetween.<br>
The rolls 10 are positioned in a way that the<br>
projections 11 of each of said rolls occupy a portion<br>
of the annular gaps 12 of the other roll. Thus,<br><br>
between the two rolls 10 is defined a sinuous region<br>
(corresponding to the sum of the successive annular<br>
gaps 12), which will be crossed by the film 20 that<br>
forms the backsheet 2.<br>
The stretching of the film 20 occurs when said film,<br>
upon being moved by the two rolls 10 presenting<br>
opposite and concomitant circular movements, passes<br>
through the sinuous region defined by the space<br>
existing between the rolls 10, simultaneously meeting<br>
the plurality of projections 11 of both rolls, which<br>
projections are simultaneously alternatively<br>
positioned. Thus, some rectilinear longitudinal<br>
regions of the film are stretched to the point in<br>
which the molecular rearrangement of the polymer<br>
occurs, configuring stretched regions 5, preferably<br>
but not compulsorily in the form of lines.<br>
Normally, these stretched regions 5 are those that<br>
touch the ends of the projections 11. Figure 9 makes<br>
it easier to understand the regions of the film 20<br>
that are stretched and the positioning of said film<br>
upon passing through the space defined by the two<br>
rolls 10.<br>
In order to achieve the desired stretching and to<br>
avoid total rupture of the film 20, the deformation<br>
suffered by the film in the stretched regions 5 is<br>
controlled by handling variables, such as the shape of<br>
the projections 11, the composition of the film 20,<br>
etc.<br>
Obviously, due to the process variables, such as film<br>
thickness and composition, shape of the projections,<br>
etc., it is possible to occur the stretching of the<br>
regions of the film 20 corresponding to the<br>
intermediate portion defined between two unstretched<br>
regions 6, which are also longitudinal and touch the<br>
ends of the projections 11, or even the geometrically<br><br>
random stretching of the film.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the stretched regions 5<br>
are considerably thinner (or less wide) than the<br>
unstretched regions 6, presenting a * width<br>
substantially between 0,6 mm and 1,1 mm, whereas the<br>
unstretched regions present a width substantially<br>
between 1,1 mm and 1,9 mm, but this is not a mandatory<br>
characteristic of the film 20 after stretching.<br>
Statistically, for the preferred embodiment, the<br>
relation between the width of the unstretched regions<br>
6 and the width of the stretched regions 5 is of about<br>
183%.<br>
In order to allow the film 20 to be stretched without<br>
being completely ruptured upon passing through the<br>
space between the rolls 10, said film 20 should<br>
preferably embrace one of the rolls 10 in an angle of<br>
about 90°, thus maximizing the film/roll contact time<br>
and contact area. Also, to avoid rupture of the film<br>
20, the modulus of velocity of said film when entering<br>
the region between the rolls should be equal to the<br>
modulus of velocity when it leaves said rolls and<br>
equal to the modulus of the velocities of the rolls<br>
10. However, it is possible to handle the process<br>
variables so as to eventually allow stretching the<br>
film 20 with a considerable lower film/roll contact<br>
angle.<br>
Accordingly, tension means should be preferably used<br>
for longitudinally and transversally<br>
drawing/stretching, the film 20 before and after its<br>
passage through the rolls 10, which also assures<br>
stretching without total rupture. The tension values<br>
to be applied, as well as the means used for<br>
accomplishing stretching are not described herein, as<br>
they can vary according to the type/composition of the<br>
film used, the geometric- constructive characteristics<br><br>
of the rolls 10, etc. Also, it is possible to handle<br>
the several variables involved, . in order not to<br>
require the use of means for drawing the film 20.<br>
As widely known, the stretching of the film made of<br>
plastic material produces a non-despicable amount of<br>
heat, due to the molecular rearrangement in the<br>
stretched regions 5. In case the stretching is<br>
effected for a long time and continuously, this heat<br>
that is generated will be absorbed by the rolls 10,<br>
whose superficial temperature increases. From a<br>
determined temperature, the rolls, instead of<br>
stretching the film 20 cause its heat-deformation,<br>
since this high temperature softens the material of<br>
the film, which may be ruptured due to said material<br>
softening. A heat-deformed film, however, does not<br>
present the .same softness and smoothness<br>
characteristics as the stretched film, and therefore<br>
this temperature increase of the rolls 10 should be<br>
avoided.<br>
In order to maintain the rolls 10 in a convenient and<br>
efficient working- temperature, preferably less than<br>
about 80°C, the stretching equipment is preferably<br>
provided with means to refrigerate the rolls. These<br>
refrigerating means help maintain the film in a not<br>
very high temperature, since as already mentioned, it<br>
is not interesting to occur heating of the rolls 10.<br>
Thus, stretching is a mechanical cold forming process<br>
(without the application of heat).<br>
Any mechanism can be used to achieve said<br>
refrigeration, as this is not the object of the<br>
present invention, however, by way of example, we can<br>
mention the application of air at room temperature<br>
adjacently to the rolls, or even effect cooling with a<br>
refrigerant liquid'.<br>
Although the film 20 that forms the backsheet 2 of the<br><br>
absorbent product 1 of the present invention has a<br>
plurality of longitudinal stretched regions 5, it is<br>
evident that this arrangement may vary. For example,<br>
the film can be stretched upon its passage through a<br>
pair of rolls 10 having substantially transverse<br>
projections 11, similar to gear teeth, so that<br>
stretched regions 5 lie substantially perpendicular to<br>
the displacement direction. of the film in the region<br>
of the rolls 10. The rolls 10 may present any other<br>
shape of projections 11 as well.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to provide two rolls 10<br>
operating synchronously, each roll having more than<br>
one type of projection 11, allowing the film t"o have<br>
consecutive different stretched regions 5 determined<br>
by different types of projections 11.<br>
As mentioned above, the stretched film 20 that forms<br>
the backsheet 2 presents at least one stretched region<br>
5, on which sides are provided at least two<br>
unstretched regions 6, but it preferably comprises a<br>
plurality of stretched regions 5. Whatever the<br>
quantity, the stretched regions 5 correspond to the<br>
molecular rearrangement of the film.<br>
In the film 20 of the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the increase of the transverse<br>
measure of the film made possible by the presence of<br>
longitudinal stretched regions 5 is of about 16%,<br>
however it is obvious that this value may vary.<br>
Figures 5, 6 and 7 are enlarged views of the film 20,<br>
in which it may be verified that the stretched regions<br>
5 present a substantial thickness reduction in<br>
relation to the unstretched regions 6. In the<br>
preferred embodiment of the film of the present<br>
invention, the relation between the thicknesses of the<br>
unstretched regions 6 and the stretched regions 5 is<br>
of about 240%.<br><br>
This is due to the fact that the stretching provoked<br>
the molecular rearrangement in the stretched regions<br>
and reduced the basis weight of the film. Evidently,<br>
since no more alterations occurred in the film, the<br>
same quantity of material in a larger area will result<br>
in a smaller basis weight in the stretched regions<br>
(preferably, the basis weight is measured in grams by<br>
square meters - g/m2). Moreover, this stretching<br>
produces heat, as it is responsible for the quantity<br>
of residual energy of the material, which will be<br>
discussed in more details ahead.<br>
Figures 5, 6 and. 7 further allow visualizing a micro<br>
embossing, which is defined by a profile comprising<br>
alternate areas 7, 8 of different thicknesses. This<br>
micro embossing is carried out during the<br>
manufacturing process of the film 20 (by extrusion)<br>
with any configuration, with the purpose of rendering<br>
said film a matte, brightless appearance, otherwise<br>
the film would present a lustrous appearance. This<br>
micro embossing does not interfere with any properties<br>
of the film, such as softness, smoothness, etc., since<br>
it is produced in a very superficial level. It is<br>
evident that a film lacking this micro embossing may<br>
be used. In short, the use of the micro-embossed film<br>
20 is merely optional.<br>
The reduction of the residual energy of the polymeric<br>
material of the film 20 (which is confirmed by the<br>
generation of heat) imparts to the backsheet 2 formed<br>
therewith sensations of smoothness and great softness.<br>
These characteristics are specially desired, sirrce the<br>
backsheet 2 is the first region of the absorbent<br>
product 1 to be touched by the user, even before using<br>
it.<br>
As already mentioned above, the stretching of the film<br>
20 produces heat, due to a mechanical molecular<br><br>
rearrangement. However, the mechanical resistance of<br>
the material is not altered. To confirm this<br>
statement, traction comparative tests were made<br>
between samples of the film 2 0 of the present<br>
invention having longitudinal stretched regions 5 and<br>
unstretched samples of the film 2 0 of the present<br>
invention. The results of said tests allowed reaching<br>
the following conclusions:<br>
•	Since the stretching is longitudinal, no change<br>
occurs in the material behavior regarding deformation<br>
in the longitudinal direction until the point of<br>
rupture (in the specific case it remained about 530%,<br>
independently of the stretching), as well as regarding<br>
the necessary force to cause rupture of the film (in<br>
the specific case, about 1300 kgf) .<br>
•	On the other hand, in relation to the deformation in<br>
the transverse direction (always taking into account<br>
that the stretched regions 5 of the samples containing<br>
the latter were longitudinal) , the transverse<br>
deformability of the stretched samples was reduced (in<br>
the specific case reduced from about 730% to about<br>
520%, i.e., a reduction in the deformability of about<br>
2 9%) , however without the corresponding reduction in<br>
the necessary force to cause rupture of the film (in<br>
the specific case equivalent to about 1,050 kgf). This<br>
reduction of the transverse deformability is directly<br>
associated with the energy dissipated in the form of<br>
heat in the stretching process, making the rupture of<br>
the stretched film to be achieved with the smallest<br>
maximum transverse deformation.<br>
•	The absence of modifications in the properties of<br>
the film 20 regarding the longitudinal deformation and<br>
the reduction of the transverse deformability until<br>
reaching the point of rupture, due to the reduction of<br>
the residual energy of the stretched samples, confirms<br><br>
that no alterations occur in the mechanical properties<br>
of the film 20 after stretching.<br>
With the purpose of measuring the difference of the<br>
residual energy between the samples of the film 20<br>
that were submitted to stretching and the ones that<br>
were not submitted to stretching, a DSC (Differential<br>
Scanning Calorimeter) test was Carried out, which<br>
proved that, to a determined temperature increase of<br>
the stretched samples, there was a heat absorption<br>
about 3,3% higher than the amount of heat absorbed by<br>
the unstretched samples for the same temperature<br>
increase. Evidently, this value may vary, but it has<br>
unmistakably been proved that the stretching process<br>
reduces the residual energy of the film, with the<br>
production of heat, as already mentioned.<br>
In order to illustrate the high approval of the users<br>
as to the utilization of an absorbent product<br>
containing a backsheet 2 made of a film 20 stretched<br>
in accordance with the teachings of the present<br>
