				<td>AN ANTINEOPLASTIC COMPOSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the use of combinations of rapamycin 42-ester with<br>
3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpropionic acid (CCI-779) and 4-dimethylamino-<br>
but-2-enoic acid [4-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenylamino)-3-cyano-7-ethoxy-quinolin-6-yl]-<br>
amide (EKB-569).<br>
Rapamycin is a macrocyclic triene antibiotic produced by Streptomyces<br>
hygroscopicus, which was found to have antifungal activity, particularly against<br>
Candida albicans, both in vitro and in vivo [C. Vezina et al., J. Antibiot. 28, 721<br>
(1975); S.N. Sehgal et al., J. Antibiot. 28, 727 (1975); h. A. Baker et al., J. Antibiot<br>
31, 539 (1978); U.S. Patent 3,929,992; and U.S. Patent 3,993,749]. Additionally,<br>
rapamycin alone (U.S. Patent 4,885,171) or in combination with picibanil (U.S. Patent<br>
4,401,653) has been shown to have antitumor activity.<br>
The immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin have been disclosed in FASEB<br>
3, 3411 (1989). Cyclosporin A and FK-506, other macrocyclic molecules, also have<br>
been shown to be effective as immunosuppressive agents, therefore useful in<br>
preventing transplant rejection [FASEB 3, 3411 (1989); FASEB 3, 5256 (1989);<br>
R. Y. Calne et al., Lancet 1183 (1978); and U.S. Patent 5,100,899]. R. Martel et al.<br>
[Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 55, 48 (1977)] disclosed that rapamycin is effective in<br>
the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model, a model for multiple sclerosis; in<br>
the adjuvant arthritis model, a model for rheumatoid arthritis; and effectively inhibited<br>
the formation of IgE-like antibodies.<br>
Rapamycin is also useful in preventing or treating systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus [U.S. Patent 5,078,999], pulmonary inflammation [U.S. Patent<br>
5,080,899], insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [U.S. Patent 5,321,009], skin<br>
disorders, such as psoriasis [U.S. Patent 5,286,730], bowel disorders [U.S. Patent<br>
5,286,731], smooth muscle cell proliferation and intimal thickening following vascular<br>
injury [U.S. Patents 5,288,711 and 5,516,781], adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma<br>
[European Patent Application 525,960 A1], ocular inflammation [U.S. Patent<br>
5,387,589], malignant carcinomas [U.S. Patent 5,206,018], cardiac inflammatory<br>
disease [U.S. Patent 5,496,832], and anemia [U.S. Patent 5,561,138].<br>
Rapamycin 42-ester with 3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylpropionic acid<br>
(CCI-779) is ester of rapamycin which has demonstrated significant inhibitory effects<br>
on tumor growth in both in vitro and in vivo models. The preparation and use of<br>
hydroxyesters of rapamycin, including CCI-779, are disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
5,362,718.<br>
CCI-779 exhibits cytostatic, as opposed to cytotoxic properties, and may delay<br>
the time to progression of tumors or time to tumor recurrence. CCI-779 is considered<br>
to have a mechanism of action that is similar to that of sirolimus. CCI-779 binds to<br>
and forms a complex with the cytoplasmic protein FKBP, which inhibits an enzyme,<br>
mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin, also known as FKBP12-rapamycin<br>
associated protein [FRAP]). Inhibition of mTOR"s kinase activity inhibits a variety of<br>
signal transduction pathways, including cytokine-stimulated cell proliferation,<br>
translation of mRNAs for several key proteins that regulate the G1 phase of the cell<br>
cycle, and IL-2-induced transcription, leading to inhibition of progression of the cell<br>
cycle from g1 to S. The mechanism of action of CCI-779 that results in the G1 S<br>
phase block is novel for an anticancer drug.<br>
In vitro, CCI-779 has been shown to inhibit the growth of a number of<br>
histologically diverse tumor cells. Central nervous system (CNS) cancer, leukemia (T-<br>
cell), breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma lines were among the most<br>
sensitive to CCI-779. The compound arrested cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.<br>
in vivo studies in nude mice have demonstrated that CCI-779 has activity<br>
against human tumor xenografts of diverse histological types. Gliomas were<br>
particularly sensitive to CCI-779 and the compound was active in an orthotopic glioma<br>
model in nude mice. Growth factor (platelet-derived)-induced stimulation of a human<br>
glioblastoma cell line in vitro was markedly suppressed by CCI-779. The growth of<br>
several human pancreatic tumors in nude mice as well as one of two breast cancer<br>
lines studied in vivo also was inhibited by CCI-779.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a<br>
phosphate group from ATP or GTP to tyrosine residue located on protein substrates.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases clearly play a role in normal cell growth. Many of the growth<br>
factor receptor proteins function as tyrosine kinases and it is by this process that they<br>
effect signaling. The interaction of growth factors with these receptors is a necessary<br>
event in normal regulation of cell growth. However, under certain conditions, as a<br>
result of either mutation or overexpression, these receptors can become deregulated;<br>
the result of which is uncontrolled cell proliferation which can lead to tumor growth and<br>
ultimately to the disease known as cancer [Wilks A.F., Adv. Cancer Res., 60, 43<br>
(1993) and Parsons, J.T.; Parsons, S.J., Important Advances in Oncology, DeVita<br>
V.T. Ed., J.B. Lippincott Co., Phila., 3 (1993) ]. Among the growth factor receptor<br>
kinases and their proto-oncogenes that have been identified and which are targets of<br>
the compounds of this invention are the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase<br>
(EGF-R kinase, the protein product of the erbB oncogene), and the product produced<br>
by the erbB-2 (also referred to as the neu or HER2) oncogene. Since the<br>
phosphorylation event is a necessary signal for cell division to occur and since<br>
overexpressed or mutated kinases have been associated with cancer, an inhibitor of<br>
this event, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, will have therapeutic value for the<br>
treatment of cancer and other diseases characterized by uncontrolled or abnormal cell<br>
growth. For example, overexpression of the receptor kinase product of the erbB-2<br>
oncogene has been associated with human breast and ovarian cancers [Slamon, D.<br>
J., et. al., Science, 244, 707 (1989) and Science, 235,1146 (1987)]. Deregulation of<br>
EGF-R kinase has been associated with epidermoid tumors [Reiss, M., et. al., Cancer<br>
Res., 51, 6254 (1991)], breast tumors [Macias, A., et al., Anticancer Res., 7, 459<br>
(1987)], and tumors involving other major organs [Gullick, W.J., Brit. Med. Bull., 47,<br>
87 (1991)]. Because of the importance of the role played by deregulated receptor<br>
kinases in the pathogenesis of cancer, many recent studies have dealt with the<br>
development of specific PTK inhibitors as potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents<br>
[some recent reviews: Burke. T.R., Drugs Future, 17, 119 (1992) and Chang, C.J.;<br>
Geahlen, R.L., J. Nat. Prod., 55,1529 (1992)].<br>
4-Dirnethylamino-but-2-enoic acid [4-(3-chloro-4-fluoro-phenylamino)-3-cyano-<br>
7-ethoxy-quinolin-6-yl]-amide (EKB-569) is an EGFR kinase inhibitor which has<br>
significant inhibitory effects on tumor growth in both in vitro and in vivo models. The<br>
preparation and use of EGFR kinase inhibitors, such as EKB-569, are disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent 6,002,008.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides the use of combinations of CCI-779 and EKB-569 as<br>
antineoplastic combination chemotherapy. In particular, these combinations are<br>
useful in the treatment of renal cancer, soft tissue cancer, breast cancer,<br>
neuroendocrine tumor of the lung, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, head and neck<br>
cancer, glioma, non-small lung cell cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer,<br>
lymphoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer,<br>
esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, and unknown primary<br>
cancer. This invention also provides combinations of CCI-779 and EKB-569 for use<br>
as antineoplastic combination chemotherapy, in which the dosage of either CCI-779<br>
or EKB-569 or both are used in subtherapeutically effective dosages.<br>
As used in accordance with this invention, the term "treatment" means treating<br>
a mammal having a neoplastic disease by providing said mammal an effective amount<br>
of a combination of CCI-779 and EKB-569 with the purpose of inhibiting growth of the<br>
neoplasm in such mammal, eradication of the neoplasm, or palliation of the mammal.<br>
As used in accordance with this invention, the term "providing," with respect to<br>
providing the combination, means either directly administering the combination, or<br>
administering a prodrug, derivative, or analog of one or both of the components of the<br>
combination which will form an effective amount of the combination within the body.<br>
The preparation of CCl-779 is described in U.S. Patent 5,362,718, which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference. An improved preparation of CCI-779 is disclosed in<br>
US patent application SN 09/670,358, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
When CCI-779 is used as an antineoplastic agent, it is projected that initial i.v.<br>
infusion dosages will be between about 0.1 and 100 mg/m2 when administered on a<br>
daily dosage regimen (daily for 5 days, every 2-3 weeks), and between about 0.1 and<br>
1000 mg/m2 when administered on a once weekly dosage regimen. Oral or<br>
intravenous infusion are the preferred routes of administration, with intravenous being<br>
more preferred.<br>
EKB-569 can be prepared according to the procedures described in US Patent<br>
6,002,008, which is incorporated by reference. Preferred procedures for the<br>
preparation of EKB-569 are provided herein. When EKB-569 is used as an<br>
antineoplastic agent it is projected that the initial oral dosage will be between 1 and<br>
100 mg per day. Depending on patient tolerance, EKB-569 can be administered daily<br>
for a treatment period, such as 14 days, followed by a rest period (no drug<br>
administered), or can be administered on a continuous basis for a longer treatment<br>
period (for example, 6 months or longer).<br>
The antineoplastic activity of the CCI-779 plus EKB-569 combination was<br>
confirmed in in vitro standard pharmacological test procedure; the following briefly<br>
describes the procedure used and the results obtained.<br>
Cell Proliferation Procedure - HCT 116 colon adenocarcinoma cells were<br>
maintained in RPMl 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD)<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies) and 50 µg/ml<br>
gentamlcin (Life Technologies) under 7% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were plated in 96-well<br>
microtiter dishes (6000 cells/well) in 200 µl RPMl 1640 medium containing 5% FBS<br>
and 50 µg/ml gentamicin and incubated overnight at 37°C. Compound dilutions were<br>
prepared in the same medium, at 5X final concentration, and 50 µl of the drug dilution<br>
was added to the cell-containing wells. For studies involving combinations of two<br>
drugs, serial dilutions of one compound were prepared in the presence of a fixed dose<br>
of a second compound. Alternatively, a checkerboard dilution series was employed.<br>
Cells were cultured for three days in the presence of the drugs. Untreated cells were<br>
included as controls. The percentage of surviving cells was determined using<br>
sulforhodamine B (SRB, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), a protein binding dye. Cellular<br>
protein was precipitated in each well by the addition of 50 µl of 50% cold<br>
trichloroacetic acid. After 1 hour, the plates were washed extensively in water and<br>
dried. SRB dye reagent (0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid, 80 µl per well) was added and<br>
plates were kept at room temperature for ten minutes. Plates were then washed<br>
thoroughly in 1% acetic acid and dried. Cell-associated dye was dissolved in 10 mM<br>
Tris (150 µl) and the absorbance was read at 540 nm in a microtiter plate reader. The<br>
concentration of compound that caused a fixed percentage inhibition of growth was<br>
determined by plotting cell survival (relative to untreated cells) against the compound<br>
dose.<br>
Synergy Evaluation - Isobolograms were used to study the interaction of two<br>
pharmacological agents. Here, the concentration of each drug alone which produces<br>
a certain endpoint (e.g 50% inhibition of cell growth, IC50), is plotted on the two<br>
graphical axes. The straight line connecting the two points represents equally<br>
effective concentrations of all combinations of the two drugs if the interaction is purely<br>
additive. A shift of the isobologram to the left of the predicted cytotoxicity (curve with<br>
concave side up) represents a synergistic interaction. Conversely, a shift to the right<br>
(isobologram with the convex side up) represents an antagonistic interaction. When<br>
isobolograms for different endpoints were plotted on the same graph, the<br>
concentration of each drug was expressed as the fraction of the concentration of each<br>
drug alone that produced the same effect. This produces a symmetrical isobologram<br>
with unit-less measures on each axis, and allows a direct comparison of different<br>
endpoints.<br>
A second model for studying drug interactions was proposed by Prichard and<br>
Shipman [Antiviral Research. 14: 181-206 (1990)]. This is a 3-dimensional model:<br>
one for each drug and the third for the biological effect. Theoretical additive<br>
interactions are calculated from the individual dose-response curves, based on a<br>
dissimilar sites model of additivity (Bliss independence). The calculated additive<br>
surface, representing predicted cytotoxicity is subtracted from the experimental<br>
surface to reveal areas of enhanced toxicity (synergy) or reduced toxicity<br>
(antagonism). The resulting surface appears as a horizontal plane at 0% inhibition<br>
above the calculated additive surface, if the interaction is additive. Peaks and valleys<br>
deviating from this plane are indicative of synergy and antagonism, respectively.<br>
MacSynergyll, a Microsoft Excel-based software was used to perform all calculations<br>
automatically. This spreadsheet calculates the theoretical additive interactions, and<br>
locates and quantifies synergistic or antagonistic interactions that are significant at the<br>
95% confidence levels. The results were plotted as a 3-dimensional plot, or as a<br>
contour plot.<br>
Results - HCT 116 cells were chosen as they express low, but detectable<br>
levels of EGFR, and are sensitive to inhibition by EGFR inhibitors. The cells are<br>
somewhat resistant to CCI-779, but are inhibited by high doses (5-10 µg/ml) of this<br>
drug. HCT-116 cells were cultured in the presence of EKB-569 alone, CCI-779 alone,<br>
or a dilution series of EKB-569 with fixed doses of CCI-779. Following growth for 3<br>
days, ceil survival was determined using the SRB test procedure. Cytotoxicity curves<br>
are shown in Fig. 1. EKB-569 produced an IC50 value of 0.31 µg/ml in HCT116 cells.<br>
When this compound was combined with 2.08 µg/ml CCI-779 (which caused 41%<br>
inhibition of growth when administered alone), the IC50 value is reduced to 0.03 µg/ml,<br>
a 10-fold decrease. When combined with 0.026 µg/ml CCI-779 (which alone inhibits<br>
cell proliferation by 36 %), the IC50 value dropped to 0.051 µg/ml, a 6-fold decrease.<br>
Similar results were observed when dose-response curves were produced with CCI-<br>
779 in the presence of fixed doses of EKB-569. To identify the nature of this drug<br>
interaction, isobolograms (at 50% effect level) of the combination of EKB-569 and<br>
CCI-779 were generated (Fig. 2). The isobologram was deeply indented with the<br>
concave side up, indicating a substantial synergistic interaction between the two<br>
drugs. At the most synergistic point, 0.03 µg/ml of EKB-569 combined with 0.077<br>
µg/ml CCI-779 was iso-effective with 0.31 µg/ml of EKB-569 alone or 4.3 µg/ml CCI-<br>
779 alone (IC50 for each drug alone). Thus, a 10-fold reduction in the dose of EKB-<br>
569 and a 50-fold reduction in the dose of CCI-779 was required to inhibit cell<br>
proliferation by 50% when the drugs were combined, compared to either drug alone.<br>
Isobolograms derived from different endpoints, ranging from 50 to 65% were also<br>
examined. As shown in Fig 3., the isobolograms produced were almost<br>
superimposable, indicating synergy at all effect levels tested.<br>
The interaction between EKB-569 and CCI-779 was also evaluated using a 3-<br>
dimensional analysis. Here, pharmacological interactions are presented in a 3-<br>
dimensional plot with the plane at 0% representing additive interaction, and peaks and<br>
valleys representing areas of synergy or antagonism, respectively, between the two<br>
drugs. In Fig. 4, the combination of EKB-569 and CCI-779 resulted in a broad area of<br>
synergistic interaction, consistent with the results shown in the isobologram studies.<br>
A contour plot of the 3-dimensional synergy plot facilitates the identification of the<br>
concentrations of drugs at which greatest synergistic toxicity occurs (Fig. 5). A broad<br>
area of synergy was observed at 0.0005 to 3 µg/ml CCI-779 and 0.16 to 0.4 µg/ml<br>
EKB-569. Within this area, two peaks of maximum synergy occurred at 0.0005 to<br>
0.003 µg/ml and 0.05 to 0.3 µg/ml of CCI-779 and 0.25 to 0.37 µg/ml EKB-569.<br>
Based on the results of these standard pharmacological test procedures,<br>
combinations of CCI-779 plus EKB-569 acted synergistically together, and are useful<br>
as antineoplastic therapy. More particularly, these combinations are useful in the<br>
treatment of renal carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, neuroendocrine<br>
tumor of the lung, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, head and neck cancer, glioma, non-<br>
small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, melanoma,<br>
small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric<br>
cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, and unknown primary cancer. As these<br>
combinations contain at least two active antineoplastic agents, the use of such<br>
combinations also provides for the use of combinations of each of the agents in which<br>
one or both of the agents is used at subtherapeutically effective dosages, thereby<br>
lessening toxicity associated with the individual chemotherapeutic agent.<br>
In providing chemotherapy, multiple agents having different modalities of<br>
action are typically used as part of a chemotherapy "cocktail." It is anticipated that the<br>
combinations of this invention will be used as part of a chemotherapy cocktail that<br>
may contain one or more additional antineoplastic agents depending on the nature of<br>
the neoplasia to be treated. For example, this invention also covers the use of the<br>
CCI-779/EKB-923 combination used in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic<br>
agents, such as antimetabolites (i.e., 5-fluorouracil, floxuradine, thioguanine,<br>
cytarabine, fludarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, gemcitabine, capecitabine,<br>
pentostatin, trimetrexate, or cladribine); DNA crosslinking and alkylating agents (i.e.,<br>
cisplatin, carboplatin, streptazoin, melphalan, chlorambucil, carmustine,<br>
methclorethamine, lomustine, bisulfan, thiotepa, ifofamide, or cyclophosphamide);<br>
hormonal agents (i.e., , tamoxifen, roloxifen, toremifene, anastrozole, or letrozole);<br>
antibiotics (i.e., plicamycin, bleomycin, mitoxantrone, idaaibicin, dactinomycin,<br>
mitomycin, doxorubicin or daunorubicin); immunomodulators (i.e., interferons, IL-2, or<br>
BCG); antimitotic agents (i.e., estramustine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinblastine,<br>
vincristine, or vinorelbine); topoisomerase inhibitors (i.e., topotecan, irinotecan,<br>
etoposide, or teniposide.); and other agents (i.e., hydroxyurea, trastuzumab,<br>
altretamine, retuximab, L-asparaginase, or gemtuzumab ozogamicin).<br>
As used in this invention, the combination regimen can be given<br>
simultaneously or can be given in a staggered regimen, with CCI-779 being given at a<br>
different time during the course of chemotherapy than EKB-923. This time differential<br>
may range from several minutes, hours, days, weeks, or longer between<br>
administration of the two agents. Therefore, the term combination does not<br>
necessarily mean administered at the same time or as a unitary dose, but that each of<br>
the components are administered during a desired treatment period. The agents may<br>
also be administered by different routes. For example, in the combination of CCI-779<br>
plus EKB-569, it is anticipated that the CCI-779 will be administered orally or<br>
parenterally, with parenterally being preferred, while the EKB-569 may be<br>
administered parenterally, orally, or by other acceptable means. These combination<br>
can be administered daily, weekly, or even once monthly. As typical for<br>
chemotherapeutic regimens, a course of chemotherapy may be repeated several<br>
weeks later, and may follow the same timeframe for administration of the two agents,<br>
or may be modified based on patient response.<br>
As typical with chemotherapy, dosage regimens are closely monitored by the<br>
treating physician, based on numerous factors including the severity of the disease,<br>
response to the disease, any treatment related toxicities, age, health of the patient,<br>
and other concomitant disorders or treatments.<br>
Based on the results obtained with the CCI-779 plus EKB-569 combinations, it<br>
is projected that the initial i.v. infusion dosage of CCI-779 will be between about 0.1<br>
and 100 mg/m2, with between about 2.5 and 70 mg/m2 being preferred. It is also<br>
preferred that the CCl-779 be administered by i.v., typically over a 30 minute period,<br>
and administered about once per week. The initial daily dosages of EKB-569 will be<br>
between about 1 and 100 mg, with between 5 and 75 mg being preferred. After one<br>
or more treatment cycles, the dosages can be adjusted upwards or downwards<br>
depending on the results obtained and the side effects observed.<br>
Oral formulations containing the active compounds of this invention may<br>
comprise any conventionally used oral forms, including tablets, capsules, buccal<br>
forms, troches, lozenges and oral liquids, suspensions or solutions. Capsules may<br>
contain mixtures of the active compound(s) with inert fillers and/or diluents such as<br>
the pharmaceutically acceptable starches (e.g. corn, potato or tapioca starch), sugars,<br>
artificial sweetening agents, powdered celluloses, such as crystalline and<br>
microcrystalline celluloses, flours, gelatins, gums, etc. Useful tablet formulations may<br>
be made by conventional compression, wet granulation or dry granulation methods<br>
and utilize pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, binding agents, lubricants,<br>
disintegrants, surface modifying agents (including surfactants), suspending or<br>
stabilizing agents, including, but not limited to, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, alginic acid, acacia gum, xanthan gum, sodium citrate,<br>
complex silicates, calcium carbonate, glycine, dextrin, sucrose, sorbitol, dicalcium<br>
phosphate, calcium sulfate, lactose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, talc, dry<br>
starches and powdered sugar. Preferred surface modifying agents include nonionic<br>
and anionic surface modifying agents. Representative examples of surface modifying<br>
agents include, but are not limited to, poloxamer 188, benzalkonium chloride, calcium<br>
stearate, cetostearyl alcohol, cetomacrogol emulsifying wax, sorbitan esters, colloidal<br>
silicon dioxide, phosphates, sodium dodecylsulfate, magnesium aluminum silicate,<br>
and triethanolamine. Oral formulations herein may utilize standard delay or time<br>
release formulations to alter the absorption of the active compound(s). The oral<br>
formulation may also consist of administering the active ingredient in water or a fruit<br>
juice, containing appropriate solubilizers or emulsifiers as needed.<br>
In some cases it may be desirable to administer the compounds directly to the<br>
airways in the form of an aerosol.<br>
The compounds may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally.<br>
Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds as a free base or<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a<br>
surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in<br>
glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparation contain a preservative to prevent the<br>
growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of<br>
sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and<br>
must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the<br>
contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can<br>
be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol<br>
(e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures<br>
thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
For the purposes of this disclosure, transdermal administrations are<br>
understood to include all administrations across the surface of the body and the inner<br>
linings of bodily passages including epithelial and mucosal tissues. Such<br>
administrations may be carried out using the present compounds, or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, in lotions, creams, foams, patches, suspensions, solutions,<br>
and suppositories (rectal and vaginal).<br>
Transdermal administration may be accomplished through the use of a<br>
transdermal patch containing the active compound and a carrier that is inert to the<br>
active compound, is non toxic to the skin, and allows delivery of the agent for systemic<br>
absorption into the blood stream via the skin. The carrier may take any number of<br>
forms such as creams and ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The<br>
creams and ointments may be viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions of either the oil-<br>
in-water or water-in-oil type. Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in<br>
petroleum or hydrophilic petroleum containing the active ingredient may also be<br>
suitable. A variety of occlusive devices may be used to release the active ingredient<br>
into the blood stream such as a semi-permeable membrane covering a reservoir<br>
containing the active ingredient with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the<br>
active ingredient. Other occlusive devices are known in the literature.<br>
Suppository formulations may be made from traditional materials, including<br>
cocoa butter, with or without the addition of waxes to alter the suppository"s melting<br>
point, and glycerin. Water soluble suppository bases, such as polyethylene glycols of<br>
various molecular weights, may also be used.<br>
The following provides the preparation of EKB-569 from commercially<br>
available starting materials or starting materials that can be made according to<br>
available literature procedures.<br>
211 ml dimethylamine (2M in THF, 0.422 moles) was added drop-wise to a solution of<br>
50 g TMS-4-bromocrotonate (0.211 moles, 75.9% by GC-MS) in 250 ml of THF at 0-<br>
50°C under N2. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br>
A white solid by-product was filtered off. 2 ml water was added to the filtrate followed<br>
by seeding. The crystals formed were filtered and washed with ether to give 18.3 g<br>
(from two crops) off -white solid product. Yield was 67.2% (98% purity by GC-MS,<br>
NMR was consistent with the structure).<br>
120 ml dimethylamine (2M in THF, 0.24 moles) was added drop-wise to a solution of<br>
20 g methyl 4-bromocrotonate (85% purity, 0.095 moles) in 150 ml of THF at 0-50°C<br>
under N2. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. TLC<br>
(9:1 CH2CI2: MeOH with few drops of Et3N) showed residual methyl 4-bromo-<br>
crotonate. The reaction mixture was heated to 40-450C for 15 minutes. A white solid<br>
by-product was filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated to give a yellow oil (14 g). The<br>
yellow oil was dissolved in 100 ml CH2CI2 and washed with H2O twice. The aqueous<br>
layer was back extracted with 100 ml CH2CI2. The CH2CI2 layers were combined,<br>
dried over MgSO4 and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to give an oil (12 g). Yield<br>
was 88%. NMR indicated desired product with trace methyl 4- bromocrotonate.<br>
