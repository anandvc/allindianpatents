				<td>Description<br>
The invention is based on an arrangement with which a shower head may be<br>
mounted.<br>
That hand-held shower heads may be held in place by a cone inserted into a<br>
conical holder is already known. The cone is situated on the hand-held shower<br>
heads, usually at the location where the shower hose is attached to their grip.<br>
Holders, into which their grip may be emplaced or inserted, are also known.<br>
Holders where a linkage having an eye that may be slipped onto a pin on a wall<br>
bracket or shower rod is present at the joint between the hose and handgrip are<br>
also known.<br>
In the case of many such holders, the shower head may still be employed as such<br>
while it is in the holder. However, there are also holders where shower heads are<br>
merely held in place by, for example, eyes hung on hooks.<br>
All known arrangements for mounting shower heads have a special facility on the<br>
shower head or its grip that users may recognize as intended for mounting<br>
purposes. Such facilities, or shape alterations, are also frequently regarded as<br>
unsightly.<br>
The problem addressed by the invention is creating a holder for a shower head that<br>
will allow the latter to be used in a wider variety of manners.<br>
In order to solve that problem, the present invention proposes a wall<br>
mounting having novel features as disclosed hereunder.<br>
The invention allows attaching to a holder a shower head that needs no<br>
special mounting devices for attaching it to the former. In particular, the<br>
appearance of the shower head is such that it cannot be recognized that it<br>
has been designed for attachment to a holder and is suitable therefor.<br>
Designers thus have much more freedom in designing shower heads and<br>
their housings.<br>
Introducing the shower head into the holder is also much easier and greatly<br>
simplified. The shape of the shower head eases that introduction which may<br>
be further facilitated by the holder, if deemed necessary.<br>
In the case of the usual conical holders, where the holder engages the grip,<br>
users must first feed the grip or hose on the shower head through the slot in<br>
the holder and then press the shower head into the holder along a direction<br>
orthogonal thereto. In the case of the shower head proposed here, only a<br>
single, extremely simple action, namely, sliding the shower head forward, is<br>
required.<br>
In particular, the holder should be configured such that it engages the<br>
shower head's housing at a location thereon that is provided for that purpose,<br>
but is not recognizable as such from its shape.<br>
The properties of its housing's outer surface thus might be configured for<br>
mounting purposes at certain location thereon, without significantly altering<br>
its housing's shape, which, in the case of this further design feature, will also<br>
allow providing that that location on the shower head's housing is intended<br>
for mating to the holder will not be recognizable as such, based on the<br>
housing's shape.<br>
In particular, the holder may be configured such that it grips the outer<br>
perimeter of the shower head's housing.<br>
The invention proposes under an elaboration thereon, that the shower head<br>
remain operational following withdrawal from the holder in order that may be<br>
employed as a shower head both while it is mated to the holder and after it has<br>
been withdrawn therefrom, which will significantly improve its utility.<br>
In order to arrive at a particularly sensible and, in spite of the shower head's not<br>
having been specially adapted to suit the holder, reliable, mounting, according to<br>
the invention, it may be provided that the holder engages the shower head's<br>
housing at two diametrically opposed locations thereon.<br>
The holder may, for example, have a pair of jaws that are configured for gripping<br>
the shower head's housing for that purpose.<br>
According to the invention, it may be provided that the jaws are tensioned toward<br>
one another while the shower head is present in the holder. That tensioning may<br>
be effected by the introduction of the shower head.<br>
Under a further elaboration on the invention, it may be provided that the jaws on<br>
the holder are interconnected by a tensioning component.<br>
In particular, that tensioning component may be configured such that it contacts the<br>
shower head's housing over an extended area while the shower head is present in<br>
the holder, which may be effected either by adapting the shape of the tensioning<br>
component to suit that of the housing or designing the tensioning component such<br>
that it is flexible.<br>
The tensioning component may also be configured such that it does not contact the<br>
shower head.<br><br>
According to the invention, it may be provided that the shower head configured in<br>
the form of a hand-held shower head having a grip attached to its housing. The<br>
shower head is attached to the holder by its housing, rather than its grip.<br>
It has proven to be particularly beneficial if the shower head's housing is disk-<br>
shaped.<br>
Further features, details, and benefits of the invention will be evident from the<br>
claims and the abstract, whose wordings are herewith made part of this description<br>
by way of reference thereto, the following description of a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, and the accompanying drawings, which depict:<br>
Fig. 1 a schematized side view of a shower-head holder according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Fig. 2 a simplified, schematic representation of a top view of the arrangement<br>
shown in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 an end view of a variation on the embodiment;<br>
Fig. 4 a view of the shower head;<br>
Fig. 5 a representation, corresponding to that of Fig. 3, of a slightly modified<br>
embodiment.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a greatly simplified side view of a shower-head holder and a wall<br>
mounting according to the invention. In the case of the example shown, this<br>
shower-head holder is mounted on a wall 1. A mounting fixture 2, which, in the<br>
case of the example shown, is in the form of a console 3 that, for example, is<br>
bolted to the wall, serves to attach it to the wall. Within the console 3, the shower-<br>
head holder is connected to a water line from a mixer faucet. An arm 5 is pivoted<br>
on a protrusion 4 on the console 3. Its pivot axis is horizontal and normal to the<br>
plane of the paper. A setscrew that may be operated by a knob 6 clamps the arm 5<br>
at a particular angular position. The arm extends away from the wall, originating at<br>
the mounting fixture 2, and terminating at its far end 7. A holder, that is not shown<br>
in any great detail in Fig. 1, for a shower head 8 is attached to the arm 5 in the<br>
vicinity of the latter's far end 7. In the case of the embodiment shown, the shower<br>
head 8 is disk-shaped and has a handgrip 9 that is slightly angularly offset from the<br>
plane of the shower head 8. Within the handgrip 9, a shower hose 10, which is not<br>
shown in detail, passes through the former and hangs freely downward therefrom.<br>
The other end of the shower hose 10 is connected to the mounting fixture 2. As<br>
has been mentioned, the arm 5 may be pivoted about a horizontal axis in order that<br>
it may take on various angular positions relative to the wall when swung upward<br>
and downward. The angular travel of the arm 5 is, for example, 180°.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts a simplified view of the arrangement shown in Fig. 1. The arm 5 forks<br>
out just beyond its point of attachment to the console 3, thereby forming a pair of<br>
tines 11 that are configured such that they diverge, but are parallel to one another<br>
in the vicinity of the far end 7 of the arm, where a holder 13 that has already been<br>
mentioned is provided between the tips 12 of the tines. The holder retains the<br>
shower head 8, which is also situated between the tips 12 of the tines.<br>
How the holder looks in detail may be seen from a first sample embodiment, which<br>
is shown in Fig. 3. The housing of the shower head 8 is disk-shaped and has a<br>
roughly elliptical outer perimeter. A pair of jaws 14 whose inner surfaces are<br>
contoured to match the outer surface of the shower head's housing is arranged on<br>
the inner faces of the tines 11 of the arm 5, which accommodate the shower head<br>
8 in a sort of form-fit clamp, where the forces exerted by the mating surfaces<br>
involved act upward and downward. However, the clamping action along the<br>
direction normal to the plane of the paper is due to an interference fit. Either an<br>
indirect clamping in each of the clamping jaws 14 or a tensioning of the pair of<br>
clamping jaws 14 toward one another, which may be actuated by a knob 6, may be<br>
employed for that purpose. That tensioning of the clamping jaws 14 toward one<br>
another may be obtained by providing that their separation is slightly less than the<br>
corresponding lateral dimension, or diameter, of the housing of the shower head 8,<br>
which will provide that they will be tensioned when the shower head's housing is<br>
inserted between the pair of clamping jaws 14, normal to the plane of the paper.<br>
Their tensioning will thus be caused by a deformation of the pair of tines 11 of the<br>
arm. The extensions of the clamping jaws 14 normal to the plane of the paper in<br>
Fig. 3 are rather short in order that they will grip the shower head's housing at two<br>
diametrically opposed locations thereon only, and only over very short portions of<br>
its perimeter, as is shown in simplified form in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 5 shows how the pair of jaws 14 on the holder might be bound together by a<br>
bail 15 that is either adapted to suit the shape of the housing of the shower head 8<br>
or is configured such that it will flex in a manner that will allow it to conform to the<br>
latter's shape. Employing the bail 15, which is essentially stressed in tension, will<br>
allow attaining a heightening of the clamping action.<br>
One of the clamping jaws 14 is mounted on the tip 12 of each of the pair of tines 11<br>
of the arm such that both are free to rotate in order that the holder, together with<br>
the shower head 8, may be pivoted about a horizontal axis. An arresting<br>
component, similar to the knob 6 shown in Fig. 1, may be provided for the purpose<br>
of providing a facility for locking the shower head at a particular position.<br>
The shower head may be grasped by its grip 9 and withdrawn from the holder<br>
normal to the plane of the paper, preferably toward the wall. If the jaws 14 (cf. also<br>
Fig. 4) have arched inner faces 16 at the central plane of the housing of the shower<br>
head 8, a certain latching of the shower head's housing in the holder will occur,<br>
without need for the shower head's housing having a shape that will allow<br>
recognizing that it is to be held in the holder at that location. When the shower<br>
head is withdrawn from the holder, there are no visible indications that it is<br>
intended for mounting on a shower-head holder.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts an embodiment where the shower head, together with its holder, is<br>
mounted between the tips of a fork. Of course, it will also be feasible to provide that<br>
such a holder may be mounted on an arm that does not constitute a fork, and that<br>
option is also covered by the invention. That option may be implemented by, for<br>
example, providing that the holder, as shown, is mounted on the side of the far end<br>
of an arm. For example, in Fig. 2, one might imagine that one of the pair of tines 11<br>
is absent, in which case, one would obtain an embodiment in which the holder<br>
would be arranged on one side of the remaining arm, or be asymmetrically<br>
arranged thereon.<br>
Of course, it will also be feasible to, for example, mount the center of the<br>
tensioning component 15 on the far end of an arm, in which case, of course,<br>
facilities for incorporating a rotation axis might also be provided.<br>
