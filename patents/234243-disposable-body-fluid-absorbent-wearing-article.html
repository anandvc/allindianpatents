				<td>This invention relates to a disposable body fluid<br>
absorbent wearing article such as a disposable diaper, an urine<br>
absorbent pad or a sanitary napkin.<br>
Fig. 9 of the accompanying drawings is a perspective view<br>
showing a liquid-pervious flexible composite sheet 100<br>
described in Japanese Patent Application Publication No.<br>
1999-217453A. This composite sheet 100 is adapted to be used<br>
as a liquid-pervious topsheet covering a liquid-absorbent core<br>
in a body fluid absorbent wearing article. The composite sheet<br>
100 comprises a plastic sheet 101 and a fibrous layer 102 bonded<br>
to the lower surface of the sheet 101. The sheet 101 has a<br>
plurality of flat zones 108 extending in parallel one to another<br>
in Y-direction and a plurality of opening arrays 111 extending<br>
in the Y-direction, each of the arrays comprising a plurality<br>
of openings 109. Each of the flat zones 108 are formed along<br>
its edges 118 with rising portion 112 extending upward from the<br>
flat zone 108. Upper edge 117a of the rising portion 112<br>
undulates along the edges 118. In the case of the disposable<br>
diaper using this composite sheet 100 as its liquid-pervious<br>
topsheet, a quantity of body fluids discharged on the flat zones<br>
108 of the composite sheet 100 will flow through the troughs<br>
defined between respective pairs of the adjacent individual<br>
rising portions 112, 112 into the openings 109 and then will<br>
be absorbed by the core underlying the composite sheet 100 . The<br>
plastic sheet 101 has its initial shape held by the fibrous layer<br>
102 and therefore it is not apprehended that the sheet 101 might<br>
be wrinkled and consequently a plurality of the openings 109<br>
might be substantially closed. The composite sheet 100<br>
preferably has a breathability of 5 - 700 cm2 /cm2 • sec as measured<br>
in accordance with prescription of JIS L 1096 and a water-<br>
resistance of 0 - 200 mm as measured in accordance with<br>
prescription of JIS L 1092.<br>
The flexible composite sheet of prior art is certainly<br>
advantageous in. that a plurality of projections, i.e.,<br>
individual rising portions serve to offer a cloth-like touch<br>
in spite of being made from plastic sheet material and a<br>
plurality of openings serve to improve the liquid- and air-<br>
permeability, in addition, this composite sheet is<br>
hydrophobic in its flat zones as well as in its rising portion<br>
so that a cloth-like touch free from wetness may be maintained<br>
even after body fluids have been discharged thereon. However,<br>
these flat zones and rising portion are rather repellent against<br>
body fluids and may deteriorate the desired liquid-permeability<br>
of the composite sheet.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a disposable<br>
body fluid absorbent wearing article improved to make the best<br>
use of the dried cloth-like touch and the high liquid-<br>
permeability characterizing the composite sheet of prior art.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a disposable<br>
body fluid absorbent wearing article comprising:<br>
a liquid-pervious topsheet;<br>
a liquid-impervious backsheet; and<br>
a liquid-absorbent core disposed between said liquid-pervious<br>
topsheet and said liquid-impervious backsheet, said liquid-<br>
pervious topsheet comprising:<br>
a plurality of plastic film layer sections each having upper<br>
and lower surfaces and a thickness of from about 0.001 to<br>
about 0.05 mm;<br>
openings defined between respective pairs of adjacent one of<br>
said plastic film layer sections; and<br>
a first fibrous layer bonded to the lower surf aces of said<br>
plastic film layer sections and immediately underlying said<br>
openings,<br>
said liquid-pervious topsheet having a Klemm's water<br>
absorbency lower than 10 mm,<br>
each of said openings having a width of from about 0.05 to<br>
about 1 mm so that a total open area thereof occupies from<br>
about 3 to about 40% of a surface area of said topsheet,<br>
edges of said plastic film layer sections defining said<br>
openings being partially fibrillated so as to form rising<br>
portions having a maximum height of 1.5 mm, said first<br>
fibrous layer having component fiber having a fineness of<br>
from about 0.5 to about 20 dtex and a basis weight of from<br>
about 5 to about 60 g/m.sup.2,<br>
said liquid-absorbent core having a second fibrous layer<br>
being closely contiguous to a lower surface of said first<br>
fibrous layer and a third fibrous layer being closely<br>
contiguous to a lower surface of said second fibrous layer,<br>
said second fibrous layer having a Klemm's water absorbency<br>
lower than 35 mm but higher than a Klemm's water absorbency<br>
of said liquid-pervious topsheet by 15 mm or more and said<br>
third fibrous layer having a Klemm's water absorbency of at<br>
least 35 mm but higher than said Klemm's water absorbency of<br>
said second fibrous layer by 15 mm or more.<br>

Details of a disposable body fluid absorbent wearing<br>
article will be more fully understood from the description given<br>
hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
typical and several preferred embodiments in the form of<br>
sanitary napkin are shown.<br>
A sanitary napkin 1 shown by Fig. 1 in a perspective view<br>
as partially broken away comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet<br>
2, a liquid-impervious backsheet 3 and a liquid-absorbent core<br>
4 disposed between these top- and backsheets 2,3. The portions<br>
of these top- and backsheets 2, 3 extending outward laterally<br>
beyond transverse opposite side edges of the core 4 are put flat<br>
under a pressure and bonded or welded together. The topsheet<br>
2 has a plurality of flat plastic film layer sections 6 lying<br>
on body side of a wearer and a fibrous assembly layer 7 bonded<br>
to the lower surfaces of the film layer sections 6. The core<br>
4 has a concealing layer 41 bonded to the lower surface of the<br>
fibrous assembly layer 7 and a liquid holding layer 42 bonded<br>
to the lower surface of the concealing layer 41. The backsheet<br>
3 comprises a single plastic sheet.<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along a line II - II in<br>
Fig. 1, Fig. 3 a perspective view showing a part of Fig. 1 in<br>
an enlarged scale and Fig. 4 a sectional view taken along a line<br>
IV - IV in Fig. 3. The film layer sections 6 distributed over<br>
the entire area of the topsheet 2 are obtained by high pressure<br>
columnar water stream treatment of hydrophobic or weakly<br>
hydrophilic thermoplastic sheet material in the manner as<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No.<br>
1999-217453A. Each of the film layer sections 6 has a thickness<br>
of 0.05 - 1 mm and formed along its peripheral edge with rising<br>
portion having a thickness similar to or less than the thickness<br>
of the flat film layer section 6. A liquid-pervious opening<br>
31 is formed between each pair of the adjacent film layer<br>
sections 6, 6.<br>
The fibrous assembly layer 7 comprises hydrophobic or<br>
weakly hydrophilic thermoplastic synthetic component fibers 13<br>
having a fineness of 0.5 - 20 dtex and a basis weight of 6 -<br>
60 g/m2. The component fibers 13 are mechanically intertwined,<br>
welded or adhesively bonded together. Such fibrous assembly<br>
layer 7 is preferably formed with a nonwoven fabric selected<br>
from a group including a spun lace nonwoven fabric, a spun bond<br>
nonwoven fabric, a melt bond nonwoven fabric, an air-through<br>
nonwoven fabric and a melt blown nonwoven fabric. The fibrous<br>
assembly layer 7 is placed upon and compressed together with<br>
the backsheet along a peripheral edge of the napkin 1.<br>
The film layer sections 6 areiwelded or adhesively! bonded<br>
to the fibrous assembly layer 7. The film layer sections 6 are<br>
intermittently arranged in a first direction X of the topsheet<br>
2 as well as in a second direction Y intersecting the first<br>
direction X. A space between each pair of the adjacent film<br>
layer sections 6, 6 is less than 1 mm in the first direction<br>
X as well as in the second direction Y and, in at least one of<br>
these two directions X, Y, 0. 05 mm or larger. Such space between<br>
the adjacent film layer sections 6, 6 defines an opening allows<br>
the fibrous assembly layer 7 to be exposed toward the skin of<br>
the napkin wearer. A total area of these openings 31 preferably<br>
occupies 3 - 40 % of the surface area of the topsheet 2. While<br>
a shape of the film layer section 6 is not specified, if the<br>
shape is quadrilateral as in the illustrated embodiment, first<br>
and second sides 21, 22 extending in parallel to each other in<br>
the first direction X as well as third and fourth sides 23, 24<br>
extending in parallel to each other in the second direction Y<br>
are preferably in a range of 0.1 ~ 5 mm and crossing angles of<br>
these sides 21 - 24 are preferably in a range of 20 ~ 160° .<br>
The rising portion 17 formed along the peripheral edge<br>
of the film layer section 6 is of the same material as the plastic<br>
sheet material of the film layer section 6 and, more<br>
specifically, the rising portion 17 corresponds to the portion<br>
of the plastic sheet material fibrillated under the high<br>
pressure columnar water streams. Upper edge 17a of the rising<br>
portion 17 undulate along the first ~ fourth sides 21 - 24 so<br>
that the maximum height of the rising portion 17 as measured<br>
from the upper surface of the film layer section 6 to its upper<br>
edge 17a is 1.5 mm and the minimum height, i.e., the height of<br>
the rising portion 17 defining a trough bottom of the undulation<br>
of the rising portion 17 and having its upper edge coinciding<br>
with the upper surface of the film layer section 6 is 0 mm. In<br>
the vicinity of the rising portion 17 having the minimum height,<br>
the film layer section 6 is continuous to the fibrous assembly<br>
layer 7 exposed in the opening 31. The topsheet 2 constructed<br>
in this manner has a Klemm's water absorbency lower than 10 mm<br>
as measured in accordance with prescription of JIS P 814. The<br>
topsheet 2 preferably has a breathability of 5 - 700 cmVcm2 •<br>
sec as measured in accordance with prescription of JIS L 1096<br>
and a water-resistance of 0 - 200 mm as measured in accordance<br>
with prescription of JIS L 1092.<br>
In the core 4, the concealing layer 41 contains<br>
hydrophilic fibers 46 and has a Klemm's water absorbency lower<br>
than 3 5 nun and higher than the Klemm's water absorbency of the<br>
topsheet 2 by 15 mm or more. Such concealing layer 41 preferably<br>
has a basis weight of 20 - 50 g/m2 and a density lower than 0.05<br>
g/cm3 which is higher than the density of the fibrous assembly<br>
layer 7 . The core 4 may be formed, for example, with fluff pulp,<br>
a mixture of fluff pulp and thermoplastic synthetic fiber, or<br>
thermoplastic synthetic fiber treated to make it rather<br>
hydrophilic. The concealing layer 41 may be covered with tissue<br>
paper, if necessary, and bonded to the fibrous assembly layer<br>
7 by means of hot melt adhesive intermittently applied thereto.<br>
The liquid holding layer 42 also contains hydrophilic fibers<br>
47 and has a Klemm' s water absorbency of at least 35 mm and higher<br>
than the Klemm's water absorbency of the concealing layer 41<br>
by 15 mm or more. The liquid holding layer 42 is formed with<br>
fluff pulp or a mixture of fluff pulp and high absorption polymer<br>
grains 48 with a basis weight of, for example, 50 - 500 g/m2<br>
and a density of 0.05 ~ 0.30 g/cm3. The hydrophilic fiber 47<br>
may be fluff pulp, rayon fiber or thermoplastic synthetic fiber<br>
treated to make it rather hydrophilic. It is possible to mix<br>
the hydrophilic fiber 47 with hydrophobic thermoplastic<br>
synthetic fiber up to 20 % by weight. The liquid holding layer<br>
42 is provided with a density higher than the density of the<br>
concealing layer 41 and, if desired, mixed with an appropriate<br>
quantity of highly hydrophilic fiber 47 to ensure that the<br>
liquid holding layer 42 may have a water absorbency higher than<br>
that of the concealing layer 41 by at least 15 mm. If desired,<br>
the liquid holding layer 42 is covered with tissue paper<br>
separately or together with the concealing layer 41.<br>
With the sanitary napkin 1 according to such embodiment,<br>
menstrual discharge flows through the openings 31 of the<br>
topsheet 2 into the fibrous assembly layer 7, then permeates<br>
the concealing layer 41 and the liquid holding layer 42, these<br>
layers have the Klemm's water absorbency progressively<br>
increasing in this order. On the film layer sections 6 of the<br>
topsheet 2, menstrual discharge flows through troughs defined<br>
between respective pairs of the adjacent individual rising<br>
portions 17, 17 into the openings 31. The napkin 1 according<br>
to this embodiment allows the topsheet 2 to offer the wearer<br>
a dried touch before and after absorption of menstrual discharge<br>
without causing a stuffiness even though the film layer sections<br>
6 and the rising portion 17 are hydrophobic. This is because<br>
the appropriate gradient of the Klemm's water absorbency<br>
enables menstrual discharge to be rapid absorbed by the core<br>
4. The film layer sections 6 of the topsheet 2 is particularly<br>
advantageous in that these sections 6 can offer the wearer a<br>
dried cloth-like touch and the fibrous assembly layer 7 is<br>
particularly advantageous in that this layer 7 can maintain the<br>
film layer sections 6 in close contact with the core 4 and thereby<br>
can reliably guide menstrual discharge from the openings 31 into<br>
the liquid holding layer 42. The concealing layer 41 of the<br>
core 4 functions to conceal menstrual discharge absorbed by the<br>
liquid holding layer 42 so that the wearer is relieved of<br>
somewhat uncomfortable feeling for every disposal of the used<br>
napkin. Once menstrual discharge has been absorbed by the high<br>
absorption polymer grains 48, there is no anxiety that the<br>
menstrual discharge might flow back toward the wearer's skin<br>
even if a body weight of the wearer is exerted on the napkin<br>
1. It is possible to arrange each of these concealing layer<br>
41 and liquid holding layer 42 in two or more layers. In such<br>
layered structure, the Klemm's water absorbency is preferably<br>
adjusted to increase progressively from the uppermost layer to<br>
the lowermost layer.<br>
Fig. 5 a view similar to Fig. 3 but showing one preferred<br>
embodiment of this invention. The topsheet 2 of this napkin<br>
1 is formed with the flexible sheet of prior art as shown in<br>
Fig. 9. This topsheet 2 has a plurality of film layer sections<br>
6 extending in parallel one to another in the second direction<br>
Y, a plurality of opening arrays 32 extending in parallel one<br>
to another in the second direction Y, each of the arrays 32<br>
comprising a plurality of openings 31, and the fibrous assembly<br>
layer 7 welded or adhesively bonded to the lower surface of the<br>
film layer sections 6 and immediately underlying the openings<br>
31. The peripheral edge of the film layer section 6 defining<br>
each of the openings 31 is formed with the rising portion 17<br>
extending upward and the upper edge 17a of the rising portion<br>
17 undulates in the second direction Y. Each pair of the film<br>
layer sections 6, 6 being adjacent in the first direction X are<br>
connected to each other by a bridge-like portion 10 lying<br>
between each pair of the openings 31 being adjacent in the second<br>
direction Y. The bridge-like portion 10 is classified into a<br>
curved one 10a as shown and a flat one 10b. The rising portion<br>
17 may be formed along edges of such bridge-like portion 10 also.<br>
The opening 31 preferably has a width of 0.05 - 1 mm as measured<br>
in the first direction X and a length in the second direction<br>
Y corresponding to at least 1.5 times the width. A total area<br>
of these openings occupies 10 - 40 % of the surface area of the<br>
topsheet 2. Component fibers 13 of the fibrous assembly layer<br>
7 partially extend upward through these openings 31. The other<br>
characteristics of the film layer sections 6 as well as the<br>
fibrous assembly layer 7 closely contiguous to the lower surface<br>
of the film layer sections 6 are similar to those in the topsheet<br>
2 shown by Fig. 3 . The napkin 1 including such topsheet 2 allows<br>
menstrual discharge to flow on the film layer sections 6 in the<br>
second direction Y quickly to longitudinally opposite ends of<br>
the napkin 1. At these longitudinally opposite ends of the<br>
napkin 1 also, menstrual discharge can be effectively absorbed<br>
by the core 4. In other words, substantially entire length of<br>
the napkin 1 can be used to absorb menstrual discharge.<br>
Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 5 but showing another<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention and Fig. 7 is a sectional<br>
view taken along a line VII - VII in Fig. 6. According to this<br>
embodiment, the topsheet 2 of the napkin 1 is formed with a<br>
plurality of tubular passages 51 extending through the topsheet<br>
2 from its upper surface to its lower surface. Each of the<br>
tubular passages 51 has an upper opening 52, a lower opening<br>
53 and a tube wall 54 extending between these two openings 52,<br>
53 . The upper and lower openings 52 , 53 preferably have a diaper<br>
of 0.1 - 5 mm, more preferably 1.5-5 mm on the upper and lower<br>
surfaces of the topsheet 2, respectively, so that a total area<br>
of the upper openings 52 may preferably occupy 1 - 70 %, more<br>
preferably 5 - 50 % of the upper surface of the topsheet 2. The<br>
tube wall 54 is tapered downward at an angle of 0 - 70 % with<br>
respect to the vertical. Within such range of tapering degree,<br>
the lower opening 53 is preferably dimensioned to be smaller<br>
than the upper opening 52. The lower opening 53 immediately<br>
overlies the upper surface of the absorbent core 4.<br>
Fig. 8 is a view similar to Fig. 7 but showing still another<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention. In the case of the<br>
topsheet 2 according to this embodiment, tubular depressions<br>
61 extend from the upper surface of the topsheet 2 toward the<br>
lower surface of the topsheet 2 and terminate in the interior<br>
of the fibrous assembly layer 7. The component fibers 13 of<br>
the fibrous assembly layer 7 partially extend upward. These<br>
component fibers 13 extend further upward through upper<br>
openings 62 of the respective depressions 61 and contribute to<br>
a soft touch of the topsheet 2. With the component fibers 13<br>
of weakly hydrophilic nature, body fluids can be smoothly guided<br>
to the level below the respective depressions 61 under capillary<br>
action. It should be understood that these depressions 61 may<br>
be provided in combination with the tubular passages 51 as shown<br>
in Figs. 6 and 7.<br>
While this invention has been described with respect to<br>
the napkin 1 as one of typical embodiments, this invention can<br>
be implemented also in the form of the other disposable body<br>
fluid absorbent wearing article such as a disposable diaper or<br>
a urine absorbent pad.<br>
In the disposable body fluid absorbent wearing article<br>
according to this invention, the topsheet has the fibrillated<br>
portion contributing to a cloth-like touch of the article and<br>
comprises the plastic film layer sections defining the<br>
liquid-pervious openings and the fibrous assembly layer<br>
integrated with the plastic film layer sections. The topsheet<br>
is closely contiguous to the absorbent core and the Klemm's<br>
water absorbency progressively increases from the topsheet<br>
toward the liquid holding layer of the core. Consequently, this<br>
wearing article allows body fluids to be rapidly absorbed by<br>
the core even though the film layer sections of the topsheet<br>
are hydrophobic or weakly hydrophilic so that a dried touch may<br>
be obtained.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
