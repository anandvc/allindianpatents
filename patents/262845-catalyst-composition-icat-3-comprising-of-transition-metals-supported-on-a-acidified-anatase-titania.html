EXAMPLE 1: Synthesis of ICaT-3 catalyst by wet impregnation technique<br>
A specific amount of titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OC3H7)4) (0.44 mol) is dissolved in anhydrous ethanol and, then this is added to the solution of the watenethanol (1:1 mol ratio). Titanium isopropoxide solution is added dropwise with rigorous stirring at room temperature under N2 atmosphere. The precipitate is subjected to hydro thermal treatment at 80 °C in a Parr autoclave for 24 h. Then, it is filtered and dried at 120 °C for 24 h. Iron loading (5%, 6% and 9%) is done by wet impregnation technique by using iron nitrate. The dried material is hydrolyzed by ammonia gas and washed with distilled water. It is dried in an oven for 24 h at 110 °C. Sulfation is done by immersing it in 0.5 M chlorosulfonic acid in ethylene dichloride. Without allowing any moisture absorption, it<br><br>
is oven dried to evaporate the solvent at 120 C for 3 h and calcined thereafter at 500 C for 3 h to get the final solid acid catalyst called ICaT-3.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Synthesis of ICaT-3 catalyst by co-precipitation technique<br>
A specific amount of titanium tetrachloride (0.40 rnoi) is dissolved in anhydrous ethanol and, then added to the solution of the water:ethanol (1:1 mol ratio). Titanium isopropoxide solution is added dropwise with rigorous stirring at room temperature under N2 atmosphere. Iron, molybdenum and tungsten loading is done by adding solution to it. The precipitate is subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 80 °C in a Parr autoclave for 24 h. Then, it is filtered and dried at 120 C for 24 h. The dried material is hydrolyzed by ammonia gas and washed with distilled water. It is dried in an oven for 24 h at 110 °C. Sulfation is done by immersing it in 0.5 M chlorosulfonic acid in ethylene dichloride. Without allowing any moisture absorption, it is oven dried to evaporate the solvent at 120 °C for 3 h and calcined thereafter at 500 °C for 3 h to get the final solid catalyst.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Alkylation of toluene with benzyl chloride by using ICaT-3 catalyst<br>

The reactor is consisted of a flat glass vessel of 5 cm i.d., 10 cm height and 150 ml of capacity equipped with baffles and a six blade impeller. The assembly is kept in an oil bath at 90 °C. The reaction mixture is agitated at the required speed with the help of a variable motor. Reaction completed within 60 min with 100 % conversion of benzyl chloride. These results represent the good acidic strength of ICaT-3.<br>

Samples are withdrawn and analyzed by gas chromatography. As the iron content is increased from 3 to 9 % in the catalyst, there is subsequent increase in catalyst activity. However, 6 and 9% iron loading gives the similar results. The duration of reaction is 60 min.<br><br>
