				<td>HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS IN PRESSURE VESSELS<br>
The present invention relates to a reaction vessel and a process<br>
for producing a molecular sieve.<br>
Molecular sieves are usually produced by heating a synthesis gel<br>
comprising suitable starting materials, in the synthesis of zeo-<br>
lites for example an aluminum source and a silicon source, in<br>
predominantly aqueous solution under hydrothermal conditions for<br>
a number of days. The reaction is usually carried out in the<br>
presence of an organic template, for example a quaternary ammo-<br>
nium salt. However, at the temperatures employed during the syn-<br>
thesis, some of these quaternary ammonium compounds, e.g. tetra-<br>
ethylammonium hydroxide, tend to undergo Hofmann elimination to<br>
form gaseous decomposition products such as amines or low mo-<br>
lecular weight hydrocarbons. These gaseous by-products collect<br>
in the gas space of the reaction vessel and there lead to a<br>
pressure increase which can be controlled only with difficulty.<br>
To prevent the maximum permissible pressure of the vessel from<br>
being exceeded as a result of evolution of gaseous by-products,<br>
the reaction can be carried out under conditions under which the<br>
Hofmann elimination is suppressed. For this purpose, it is pos-<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
sible, for example, to carry out the reaction at lower tempera-<br>
tures or reduce the basicity of the synthesis gel. However, this<br>
firstly increases the synthesis times and secondly reduces the<br>
phase purity of the molecular sieve formed. Both are undesir-<br>
able.<br>
WO 03/043937 A2 proposes carrying out the production of zeolites<br>
at temperatures above 125°C using a mixture of quaternary ammo-<br>
nium halides and quaternary ammonium hydroxides as templates.<br>
The ratio of halides to hydroxide is selected so that, as a re-<br>
sult of the reduced basicity of the synthesis gel, the pressure<br>
in the reaction vessel at the end of the reaction is signifi-<br>
cantly lower than when using pure ammonium hydroxides, without<br>
the reaction temperature having to be reduced significantly for<br>
this purpose.<br>
A further possible way of enabling the reaction to be carried<br>
out at high temperatures is to increase the pressure resistance<br>
of the reaction vessel appropriately. However, this results in a<br>
significant increase in the capital costs.<br>
The uncontrolled increase in the pressure in the reaction vessel<br>
as a result of gaseous by-products formed in the reaction also<br>
occurs in other syntheses. Here too, the vessels have to be de-signed for the pressure peaks to be expected or the reaction<br>
conditions have to be modified appropriately in order to be able<br>
to carry out the reaction using a given reaction vessel having a<br>
particular pressure resistance.<br>
A first object of the invention was therefore to provide a reac-<br>
tion vessel in which reactions in which gaseous by-products are<br>
formed can be carried out without danger and with the capital<br>
costs for the reaction vessel being kept low.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
This object is achieved by a reaction vessel having the features<br>
of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments are subject matter of the<br>
dependent claims.<br>
The reaction vessel of the invention comprises two different<br>
tanks which are connected to one another. Both tanks have a par-<br>
ticular pressure resistance, so that a reaction can be carried<br>
out at elevated pressure. A main tank which generally has larger<br>
dimensions is initially charged with the reaction mixture. In<br>
terms of its structure, this main tank corresponds essentially<br>
to known pressure vessels for carrying out chemical reactions.<br>
The tank is made of a suitable material which is stable to the<br>
components of the reaction mixture under the reaction condi-<br>
tions. An example of a suitable material is stainless steel. The<br>
main tank can be provided with a heating device, for example a<br>
heating coil or a heating jacket, so that the interior of the<br>
main tank can be heated to a particular temperature by means of<br>
a suitable heat transfer medium, for example steam or oil. The<br>
tank can also have customary closable openings through which the<br>
components of the reaction mixture can be introduced into the<br>
interior of the main tank. The main tank can be provided with a<br>
stirrer and with customary feed lines and discharge lines in or-<br>
der, for example, to charge the tank with liquids or flush it<br>
with an inert gas.<br>
The main tank is connected to a turbulence-reduction tank. The<br>
turbulence-reduction tank generally has smaller dimensions than<br>
the main tank. The turbulence-reduction tank likewise has a par-<br>
ticular pressure resistance, so that the same pressure can be<br>
set in the main tank and in the turbulence-reduction tank. The<br>
turbulence-reduction tank is likewise made of a material which<br>
is inert toward the components of the reaction mixture under the<br>
reaction conditions, for example stainless steel.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
The turbulence-reduction tank has a pressure-limiting valve<br>
through which gaseous products can be discharged from the turbu-<br>
lence-reduction tank to the outside. The pressure-limiting valve<br>
opens at a particular pressure so that the gaseous products can<br>
be discharged from the reaction vessel and the pressure in the<br>
reaction vessel drops. When the pressure in the reaction vessel<br>
has dropped to a particular value, the pressure-limiting valve<br>
closes again. In this way, a reaction in which gaseous by-<br>
products are formed can be carried out over a longer period, for<br>
example a number of days, in a reaction vessel which has a pres-<br>
sure resistance which is significantly lower than the pressure<br>
resistance of a reaction vessel in which the gaseous by-products<br>
remain for the duration of the reaction and therefore contribute<br>
to a significantly higher pressure in the interior of the ves-<br>
sel. The reaction vessel can thus be designed for lower pres-<br>
sures, which significantly reduces the capital costs.<br>
In the main tank, the reaction mixture is heated to boiling, for<br>
example while stirring. The components which have gone into the<br>
gas space can then go over into the turbulence-reduction tank.<br>
In the turbulence-reduction tank, there is significantly lower<br>
turbulence of the gas phase than in the main tank. As a result,<br>
entrained liquid can settle and flow back into the main tank.<br>
The gas phase can be then be discharged via the pressure-<br>
limiting valve until the desired pressure is attained. The dis-<br>
charged gases can, if appropriate after a cooling phase, be let<br>
out into the atmosphere or worked up in accordance with legal<br>
requirements.<br>
The pressure-limiting valve is preferably configured as a spring<br>
valve. The maximum pressure prevailing the reaction vessel can<br>
be set by means of the spring constant or the counterforce ex-<br>
erted by the spring. When the pressure in the reaction vessel<br>
exceeds the predetermined value, the pressure-limiting valve is<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
opened against the spring force of the spring valve, so that<br>
gaseous materials can escape from the reaction vessel and the<br>
pressure drops. When a particular pressure has been reached, the<br>
spring valve is closed again by the force exerted by the spring.<br>
Spring valves can be produced comparatively cheaply. Designs in<br>
which the spring force can be adjusted so that the reaction ves-<br>
sel can also be used for different reactions are also available.<br>
However, apart from the spring valve, it is also possible to use<br>
other types of pressure-limiting valves. For example, a magneti-<br>
cally or electrically switching valve controlled via pressure<br>
sensors which measure the internal pressure in the reaction ves-<br>
sel can also be used. Suitable valves are in principle all<br>
valves which open at a particular, predetermined pressure so<br>
that the pressure in the reaction vessel decreases and close<br>
again after the pressure has dropped to a predetermined value.<br>
All valves which open and close reversibly are suitable.<br>
The"1 turbulence-reduction tank serves first and foremost to re-<br>
duce the turbulence of the vapor rising from the main "tank. As<br>
indicated above, no or very little turbulence should, if possi-<br>
ble, occur in the gas phase of the turbulence-reduction vessel,<br>
so that liquid or condensed material settles and flows back into<br>
the main tank. The turbulence-reduction tank can therefore have<br>
a volume which is significantly smaller than the volume of the<br>
main tank. The volume of the turbulence-reduction tank is pref-<br>
erably from 0.5% to 5% of the volume of the main tank. However,<br>
the dimensions of the main tank and the turbulence-reduction<br>
tank also depend on the reactions carried out and can therefore<br>
also be outside the range indicated. For economic reasons, the<br>
turbulence-reduction tank is made as small as possible.<br>
Main tank and turbulence-reduction tank are connected by a line,<br>
with the cross section of the line being selected so that liquid<br>
material such as condensate can flow back from the turbulence-<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
reduction tank into the main tank without backpressure. If the<br>
cross section of the line is made too small, the liquid phase<br>
accumulates in the turbulence-reduction tank so that effective<br>
separation of gaseous and liquid phases can no longer take place<br>
in this and liquid is also discharged from the reaction vessel<br>
via the pressure-regulating valve. The cross section of the line<br>
depends on the dimensions of the main tank or the turbulence-<br>
reduction tank and also on the reaction conditions. However, the<br>
dimensions of the cross section of the line can easily be deter-<br>
mined by a person skilled in the art on the basis of the flows<br>
to be expected.<br>
The cross section of the line is preferably less than 10% of the<br>
cross section of the turbulence-reduction tank, preferably less<br>
than 5%, particularly preferably less than 3%.<br>
The turbulence-reduction tank is preferably arranged above the<br>
main tank, with the line between turbulence-reduction tank and<br>
main tank preferably running essentially vertically.<br>
The turbulence-reduction tank is preferably cooled in order to<br>
condense gaseous components of the reaction mixtures. Cooling<br>
can be effected, for example, by means of water. However, cool-<br>
ing is preferably effected by means of air. This can flow along<br>
the exterior wall of the turbulence-reduction tank in order to<br>
carry away the heat. The undesirable gaseous by-products often<br>
have a significantly lower condensation point than the reactants<br>
or products, so that efficient removal of the by-products is<br>
also possible by means of simple air cooling.<br>
The dimensions of the turbulence-reduction tank are preferably<br>
selected so that, apart from the undesirable gaseous by-<br>
products, only small proportions of the constituents of the re-<br>
action mixture are discharged from the reaction vessel. The<br>
maximum heat to be removed can therefore be set via the size of<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
the turbulence-reduction tank. The ratio of height to width of<br>
the turbulence-reduction tank is preferably in the range from<br>
3/1 to 1/5.<br>
The reaction vessel of the invention is suitable for carrying<br>
out reactions under superatmospheric pressure. It therefore has<br>
an increased pressure resistance. Main tank and turbulence-<br>
reduction tank preferably have a pressure resistance of at least<br>
10 bar, preferably from 10 to 15 bar. The range of fluctuation<br>
of the pressure-regulating valve is preferably set to less than<br>
2 bar, preferably less than 1 bar. In this way, the reactions<br>
can be carried out under approximately isobaric conditions.<br>
As indicated above, gaseous by-products which can lead to a<br>
large pressure increase in the reaction vessel are formed from<br>
the template compounds present in the reaction mixture in the<br>
synthesis of molecular sieves, in particular zeolites. The reac-<br>
tion vessel of the invention is particularly suitable for the<br>
synthesis of zeolites. The use of the reaction vessel of the in-<br>
vention makes it possible to discharge the gaseous by-products<br>
from the reaction vessel while carrying out the reaction and<br>
thus to avoid a large pressure increase in the reaction vessel.<br>
The invention therefore also provides a process for producing a<br>
molecular sieve, wherein:<br>
a synthesis gel comprising:<br>
a)	at least one starting material selected from the group<br>
consisting of an aluminum source, a silicon source, a<br>
titanium source, a gallium source, a chromium source, a<br>
boron source, an iron source, a germanium source and a<br>
phosphorus source;<br>
b)	an organic template;<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
c)	if appropriate, an alkali metal and/or alkaline earth<br>
metal ion source M having a valence n;<br>
in predominantly aqueous solution is produced;<br>
the synthesis gel is crystallized under essentially isobaric<br>
conditions in a reaction vessel as described above;<br>
the solid is separated off, and<br>
the solid is, if appropriate, washed and dried.<br>
As aluminum source, it is in principle possible to use all cus-<br>
tomary aluminum sources with which those skilled in the art are<br>
familiar. Suitable sources are, for example, activated aluminum<br>
oxide, Y-aluminum oxide, aluminum hydroxide, sodium aluminum,<br>
aluminum nitrate and aluminum sulfate. If alkali metal ions are<br>
introduced into the synthesis, sodium aluminate is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
As silicon source, it is likewise possible to use customary<br>
silicon sources. Preference is given to using precipitated sil-<br>
ica as silicon source.<br>
As titanium source, gallium source, chromium source, boron<br>
source, iron source, germanium source and phosphorus source, it<br>
is likewise possible to use all customary starting materials<br>
with which those skilled in the art are familiar.<br>
A suitable titanium source is, for example, titanium oxide, tet-<br>
raethyl orthotitanate, tetrapropyl orthotitanate, titanium chlo-<br>
ride .<br>
A suitable gallium source is, for example, gallium nitrate.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
A suitable chromium source is, for example, chromium oxide,<br>
chromium nitrate, chromium chloride, chromium acetylacetonate.<br>
A suitable boron source is, for example, boric acid.<br>
A suitable iron source is, for example, iron nitrate, iron sul-<br>
fate, iron acetylacetonate.<br>
A suitable germanium source is, for example, germanium oxide,<br>
germanium chloride.<br>
A suitable phosphorus source is, for example, phosphoric acid.<br>
The abovementioned starting materials can be used either indi-<br>
vidually or preferably in a mixture of at least two components.<br>
If more than two components are used, one of the components is<br>
usually added in a significantly lower proportion than the other<br>
two components. The proportion of the third or further compo-<br>
nents is preferably from 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably from 1<br>
to 10 mol%, based on the totality of the sources used as start-<br>
ing material.<br>
Particular preference is given to producing zeolites by the<br>
process of the invention. These are produced from a silicon<br>
source and an aluminum source, with proportions of the other<br>
abovementioned sources being able to be added if appropriate.<br>
To form the desired structure, suitable organic templates are<br>
added to the synthesis gel. Suitable classes of templates are,<br>
for example, amines, quaternary ammonium salts, alcohols, ke-<br>
tones, phosphonium salts.<br>
In the production of, for example, zeolites, preference is given<br>
to using quaternary ammonium salts which tend to decompose into<br>
by-products at elevated temperatures, for example tetraalkylam-<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
monium hydroxides, where the alkyl groups preferably have from<br>
two to eight carbon atoms, as templates. Here, tetraethylammo-<br>
nium hydroxide is particularly preferred.<br>
As alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal ion source, it is<br>
possible to use all customary compounds which contain an alkali<br>
metal or alkaline earth metal ion M having a valence n and with<br>
which those skilled in the art are familiar. The valence n is 1<br>
for alkali metals and 2 for alkaline earth metals. Particular<br>
preference is given to using sodium as alkali metal. As alkali<br>
metal source, particular preference is given to using alkali<br>
metal hydroxides, preferably sodium hydroxide.<br>
In the synthesis of a molecular sieve, a mixture, preferably a<br>
solution, of the starting materials, the organic template and,<br>
if appropriate, the alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal ion<br>
source is preferably firstly prepared in the reaction vessel. As<br>
solvent, use is made of water which may also contain relatively<br>
small proportions of organic solvents, for example alcohols such<br>
as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, dimethylformamide or di-<br>
methyl sulfoxide, with the proportion preferably being less than<br>
10% by weight, particularly preferably less than 5% by weight,<br>
in particular less than 1% by weight, in each case based on the<br>
weight of the solvent, i.e. the water and the organic solvent<br>
which may be present.<br>
The order in which the individual components of the synthesis<br>
gel are dissolved in the solvent is in principle not subject to<br>
any restrictions. It is possible firstly to dissolve the organic<br>
template in water and subsequently dissolve the further compo-<br>
nents therein, or else to prepare a solution of the starting ma-<br>
terials first and then dissolve the organic template therein. In<br>
principle, it is possible to employ the same procedure as is<br>
known for producing the respective molecular sieves.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
The synthesis gel is then heated under hydrothermal conditions,<br>
with the pressure in the reaction vessel being kept below a pre-<br>
determined maximum pressure by use of the above-described reac-<br>
tion vessel and gaseous by-products being able to escape from<br>
the reaction vessel. The reaction time is selected as a function<br>
of the molecular sieve synthesized and is also dependent on the<br>
amount of synthesis gel reacted. Here, recourse can be made, as<br>
one alternative, to values which are based on experience and are<br>
available from the synthesis in known reaction vessels. As an-<br>
other alternative, a person skilled in the art can determine the<br>
required reaction time by means of trials or by sampling during<br>
the reaction.<br>
As indicated above, the process of the invention is particularly<br>
useful for the production of zeolites.<br>
In the synthesis of a zeolite, a solution of tetraethylammonium<br>
hydroxide or another suitable tetraalkylammonium salt in demin-<br>
eralized water is preferably firstly provided. The aluminum<br>
source, for example sodium aluminate, and, if appropriate, a<br>
source of alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal ions M having<br>
the valence n, for example sodium hydroxide, are subsequently<br>
added to this solution and the mixture is stirred until a solu-<br>
tion of the constituents is obtained. The silicon source, for<br>
example, precipitated silica, is subsequently added to this so-<br>
lution a little at a time to give a highly viscous gel. The syn-<br>
thesis of the zeolite is preferably carried out in a small<br>
amount of water as solvent. For this purpose, the molar ratio of<br>
H20:SiO2 is preferably set in the range from 5 to 15. The reac-<br>
tion vessel is then closed and the pressure-regulating valve of<br>
the turbulence-reduction tank is set to a particular value. The<br>
main tank is heated so that the pressure in the interior of the<br>
tank rises. The pressure-regulating valve is preferably set so<br>
that the reaction proceeds at the given temperature under hydro-<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
thermal conditions and only the increase in pressure due to evo-<br>
lution of gaseous by-products leads to opening of the pressure-<br>
regulating valve. The pressure-regulating valve is preferably<br>
set so that the reaction is carried out at a pressure of more<br>
than 8 bar, preferably at a pressure in the range from 10 to<br>
13 bar. For this purpose, the temperature in the main tank is<br>
preferably set to temperatures in the range from 120°C to 200°C,<br>
in particular from 140°C to 180°C, for crystallization of the<br>
synthesis gel. The crystallization is particularly usefully car-<br>
ried out at a temperature of about 160°C. The crystallization<br>
time is preferably from about 50 to 500 hours, in particular<br>
from about 100 to 250 hours. The crystallization time is influ-<br>
enced, for example, by the crystallization temperature. These<br>
synthesis conditions give a solid which corresponds in terms of<br>
its purity, crystallinity and crystal size to a solid as is ob-<br>
tained using an identical synthesis gel at a higher synthesis<br>
pressure without use of the reaction vessel of the invention.<br>
The solid preferably has primary crystallites having a mean pri-<br>
mary crystallite size of not more than about 0.1 urn.<br>
The crystallized product is subsequently separated off from the<br>
mother liquor. For this purpose, the reaction mixture can, for<br>
example, be filtered by means of a membrane filter press. How-<br>
ever, other methods of separating off the solid can likewise be<br>
employed. The solid can also be separated off by, for example,<br>
centrifugation. The solid which has been separated off is subse-<br>
quently washed with demineralized water. Washing is preferably<br>
continued until the electrical conductivity of the washings has<br>
dropped below 100 us/cm.<br>
The precipitate which has been separated off can subsequently be<br>
dried. Drying is, for example, carried out in air in customary<br>
drying apparatuses. The drying temperature is, for example, se-<br>
lected in the range from 100°C to 120°C. The drying time is gen-<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
erally in the range from about 10 to 20 hours. The drying time<br>
is dependent on the moisture content of the solid which has been<br>
separated off and on the size of the batch. The dried solid can<br>
subsequently be comminuted in a customary way, in particular<br>
granulated or milled.<br>
To remove the template, the solid can be calcined. The calcina-<br>
tion is carried out in the presence of air, with temperatures in<br>
the range from 400 to 700°C, preferably from 500 to 600°C, being<br>
selected. The calcination time is generally from 3 to 12 hours,<br>
preferably from 3 to 6 hours. The times indicated for the calci-<br>
nation are based on the time for which the zeolite is maintained<br>
at the maximum temperature. Heating and cooling times are not<br>
taken into account. The amount of exchangeable cations, in par-<br>
ticular alkali metal ions, present in the catalyst can, for ex-<br>
ample, be influenced by treatment with suitable cation sources<br>
such as ammonium ions, metal ions, oxonium ions or mixtures<br>
thereof, with the exchangeable ions present in the zeolite, in<br>
particular alkali metal ions, being replaced. The catalyst laden<br>
with the appropriate ions can subsequently be washed and dried<br>
again. Drying is carried out, for example, at temperatures of<br>
from 110 to 130°C for a time of from 12 to 16 hours. To convert<br>
the catalyst into an acid-activated form in the case of a re-<br>
placement using ammonium ions, the catalyst can be additionally<br>
calcined, for example at temperatures in the range from 4 60 to<br>
500°C for a time of from 6 to 10 hours. Finally, the catalyst<br>
can be additionally milled.<br>
The reaction conditions have been described by way of example<br>
for the production of a zeolite. To produce other molecular<br>
sieves, it is in principle possible to use the same reaction<br>
conditions. Thus, for example, aluminum phosphates can be pro-<br>
duced under analogous conditions.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
The molecular sieve obtained or preferably the zeolite obtained<br>
can be used in powder form. However, to increase the mechanical<br>
stability and to aid handling, the molecular sieve or the zeo-<br>
lite can also be processed to produce shaped bodies. For this<br>
purpose, the molecular sieve or the zeolite can, for example, be<br>
pressed with or without addition of binders to form appropriate<br>
shaped bodies. However, shaping can also be effected by other<br>
methods, for example by extrusion. Here, the powder obtained is<br>
admixed with a binder, for example pseudoboehmite, and shaped to<br>
produce shaped bodies. The shaped bodies can subsequently be<br>
dried, for example at temperatures of from 100 to 130°C. If ap-<br>
propriate, the shaped bodies can be additionally calcined, gen-<br>
erally at temperatures in the range from 400 to 600°C.<br>
The process of the invention is particularly suitable for pro-<br>
ducing ZSM-12 zeolites. In this case, a tetraethylammonium salt,<br>
preferably the hydroxide, is used as template. In particular,<br>
the process of the invention is suitable for producing a ZSM-12<br>
zeolite as is described in DE 103 14 753.<br>
The synthesis of the zeolite is preferably carried out directly<br>
with the desired SiO2/Al2O3 ratio by setting the amount of sili-<br>
con source and aluminum source in the synthesis gel composition<br>
appropriately. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the synthesis gel composi-<br>
tion is approximately the same as the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the<br>
ZSM-12 zeolite. The proportion of SiO2 in the synthesis gel com-<br>
position generally differs, as a person skilled in the art will<br>
know, by about ± 10% from the proportion in the finished zeo-<br>
lite. Only at very high or very low proportions of SiO2 are lar-<br>
ger deviations observed. As a result, no subsequent dealumina-<br>
tion of the zeolite in order to set the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is nec-<br>
essary. The aluminum content of the zeolite of the ZSM-12 type<br>
therefore does not subsequently have to be reduced by addition<br>
of acid and leaching out of aluminum atoms. It is assumed that<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
the direct synthesis makes a homogeneous buildup of the zeolite<br>
possible and avoids "extra-framework" aluminum which is formed<br>
in subsequent dealumination after the zeolite synthesis and can<br>
have an adverse effect on the activity or selectivity of the<br>
ZSM-12 zeolite.<br>
The molar ratio of TEA+/SiO2 set in the synthesis gel is pref-<br>
erably low. A molar ratio of TEA+/SiO2 in the range from about<br>
0.10 to 0.18 is preferably selected. The molar ratio of<br>
SiO2/Al2C&gt;3 in the synthesis gel composition is preferably set to<br>
a value in the range from about 50 to about 150.<br>
The synthesis gel should preferably also have a comparatively<br>
low alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal content, with the<br>
molar ratio of M2/nO:SiO2 advantageously being able to be from<br>
about 0.01 to 0.045. Here, M2/nO is the oxide of the alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal having the valence n. Furthermore, a com-<br>
paratively low molar ratio of H2O:SiO2 of from about 5 to 18,<br>
preferably from 5 to 13, in the synthesis gel is advantageously<br>
used. The metal ion M is preferably an alkali metal, particu-<br>
larly preferably sodium.<br>
The silicon source has a considerable influence on the morphol-<br>
ogy and catalytic activity of the ZSM-12 zeolite produced. Pref-<br>
erence is given to using a precipitated silica which has a lower<br>
reactivity than colloidal silica. In this way, an influence can<br>
be exerted over the mean size of the primary crystallites ob-<br>
tained, which should preferably be less than 0.1 um. The pre-<br>
cipitated silica preferably has a BET surface area of<br>
≤ 200 m2/g.<br>
The mean size of the primary crystallites in the ZSM-12 zeolite<br>
produced is comparatively low and is less than 0.1 um. The pri-<br>
mary crystallite size can be determined from scanning electron<br>
micrographs by measuring the length and width of a number of<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
primary crystallites. The arithmetic mean of the primary crys-<br>
tallite sizes measured is then formed. There is generally no<br>
significant difference between the width and length of the pri-<br>
mary crystallites obtained. Should such a difference occur in a<br>
particular case, the largest diameter and the smallest diameter<br>
of the crystallite is determined to determine the primary crys-<br>
tallite size.<br>
Specifically, scanning electron micrographs of the washed and<br>
dried but uncalcined, template-containing ZSM-12 zeolite at a<br>
magnification of from 68 000 to 97 676 are prepared (instrument:<br>
Leo 1530; Leo GmbH, Oberkochen, DE). 30 primary crystallites<br>
which are clearly delineated are selected in the micrographs and<br>
their length and width is measured and the mean is determined<br>
therefrom. The arithmetic mean of the diameters determined in<br>
this way, i.e. the mean primary crystallite size, is then<br>
formed. The primary crystallite size is not significantly influ-<br>
enced by calcination. The primary crystallite size can therefore<br>
be determined either directly after the synthesis of the zeolite<br>
of the ZSM-12 type or after calcination.<br>
The primary crystallites preferably have a size in the range<br>
from about 10 to 80 nm, particularly preferably in the range<br>
from about 20 to 60 nm. The catalyst thus comprises compara-<br>
tively small primary crystallites.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the primary crystallites<br>
of the zeolite are at least partly agglomerated to form agglom-<br>
erates. It is advantageous for a proportion of at least 30%,<br>
preferably at least 60%, in particular at least 90%, of the pri-<br>
mary crystallites to be agglomerated to form agglomerates. The<br>
percentages are based on the total number of primary crystal-<br>
lites.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
When the above-described conditions are adhered to in the syn-<br>
thesis of the zeolite of the ZSM-12 type, a particularly advan-<br>
tageous morphology of the agglomerates of the very small primary<br>
crystallites which also has a positive influence of the cata-<br>
lytic activity of the ZSM-12 zeolites is obtained. The agglomer-<br>
ates have a large number of voids or intestices between the in-<br>
dividual primary crystallites on their surface. The agglomerates<br>
thus form a loose composite of primary crystallites having voids<br>
or intestices between the primary crystallites which can be ac-<br>
cessed from the agglomerate surface. On scanning electron micro-<br>
graphs, the agglomerates appear as sponge-like structures having<br>
a strongly fissured surface produced by the loose cohesion of<br>
the primary crystallites. The micrographs preferably display<br>
relatively large spherical agglomerates which have a broccoli-<br>
like form. The structured surface is made up of primary crystal-<br>
lites which form a loose composite. Between the individual crys-<br>
tallites, there are voids from which channels lead to the sur-<br>
face and which appear as dark ridges of the surface in the mi-<br>
crographs. Overall, a porous structure is obtained. The agglom-<br>
erates formed by the primary crystallites are preferably in turn<br>
joined to form larger higher-order agglomerates between which<br>
individual channels having a larger diameter are formed.<br>
For use as catalyst, in particular when used for hydrogenations,<br>
dehydrogenations and hydroisomerizations, the catalyst is addi-<br>
tionally provided with suitable activating compounds (active<br>
components). The addition of the active components can be ef-<br>
fected by any method with which those skilled in the art are fa-<br>
miliar, e.g. by intensive mixing, vapor deposition, steeping in<br>
or impregnation with a solution or incorporation into the zeo-<br>
lite. The zeolite obtained is preferably provided with at least<br>
one transition metal, particularly preferably at least one noble<br>
metal. For this purpose, the zeolite is, for example, impreg-<br>
nated with an appropriate solution of the transition metal or a<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
noble metal. Loading with platinum can be carried out using, for<br>
example, an aqueous H2PtCl6 solution. The impregnation solution<br>
is preferably used in such an amount that the impregnation solu-<br>
tion is completely absorbed by the catalyst. The catalysts are<br>
subsequently dried, for example at temperatures of from about<br>
110 to about 130°C for from 12 to 20 hours, and calcined, for<br>
example at from 400 to 500°C for from 3 to 7 hours.<br>
The catalysts produced in this way are particularly suitable for<br>
modification of hydrocarbons. They are suitable, for example,<br>
for the reforming of fractions from petroleum distillation, for<br>
increasing the flowability of gas oils, for the isomerization of<br>
olefins or aromatic compounds, for catalytic or hydrogenated<br>
cracking and also for the oligomerization or polymerization of<br>
olefinic or acetylenic hydrocarbons. Further applications are<br>
alkylation reactions, transalkylation, isomerization or dispro-<br>
portionation of aromatics and alkyl-substituted aromatics, dehy-<br>
drogenation and hydrogenation, hydration and dehydration, alky-<br>
lation and isomerization of olefins, desulfonation, conversion<br>
of alcohols and ethers into hydrocarbons and conversion of par-<br>
affins or olefins into aromatics.<br>
The invention is illustrated below with the aid of examples and<br>
with reference to an accompanying figure. Here:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a section through a reaction vessel<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows, very schematically, a longitudinal section<br>
through a reaction vessel according to the invention. The reac-<br>
tion vessel comprises two different tanks, a main tank 1 and a<br>
turbulence-reduction tank 2. Main tank 1 and turbulence-<br>
reduction tank 2 are connected via line 3. The main tank 1 has a<br>
significantly lager volume than the turbulence-reduction tank 2.<br>
The cross section of the line 3 is in turn made considerably<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
smaller than the cross section of the turbulence-reduction tank<br>
2. The reaction mixture 4 is introduced into the main tank 1 and<br>
the main tank is heated by means of a heating jacket 5 until the<br>
desired reaction temperature, for example 165°C, has been at-<br>
tained in the reaction mixture 4. The reaction mixture 4 can be<br>
agitated by means of a stirrer 6. The reaction mixture 4 com-<br>
prises, for example, a synthesis gel for the synthesis of a mo-<br>
lecular sieve, in particular for the synthesis of a zeolite,<br>
which gel has been produced from a predominantly aqueous suspen-<br>
sion which contains, for example, an aluminum source, a silicon<br>
source, organic template, for example a tetraalkylammonium salt<br>
as template, and, if appropriate, alkali metal and/or alkaline<br>
earth metal sources. As a result of the heating of the reaction<br>
mixture, the pressure in the main tank 1 and thus also in the<br>
line 3 and the turbulence-reduction tank 2 rises. In addition,<br>
components of the reaction mixture 4 go over into the gas phase<br>
7 present above the reaction mixture 4, for example water vapor.<br>
During the synthesis of the molecular sieve, part of the organic<br>
template, for example of the tetraalkylammonium salt used, de-<br>
composes with elimination of gaseous by-products. These likewise<br>
go over into the gas phase 7 and result in an additional pres-<br>
sure increase in the reaction vessel. The components present in<br>
the gas phase go via line 3 into the turbulence-reduction tank<br>
2. Heat can be removed via the exterior walls of the turbulence-<br>
reduction tank 2, so that vaporized constituents of the reaction<br>
mixture 4, for example water vapor, condense again and flow back<br>
into the main tank 1 via the line 3. The cross section of the<br>
line 3 is selected so that the liquid phase condensed in the<br>
turbulence-reduction tank 2 can flow back into the main tank 2<br>
without being forced back by the ascending gases which flow from<br>
the main tank 1 into the turbulence-reduction tank 2. The gase-<br>
ous by-products formed from the tetraalkylammonium salt collect<br>
in the turbulence-reduction tank 2 as a result of the condensa-<br>
tion of the components of the reaction mixture 4. A discharge<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
line 8 leads from the turbulence-reduction tank 2 to a pressure-<br>
regulating valve 9. The pressure-regulating valve 9- is set to a<br>
particular counterpressure. When the pressure in the reaction<br>
vessel increases due to the evolution of gaseous by-products, it<br>
exceeds this counterpressure exerted by the pressure-regulating<br>
valve so that the latter is opened. The gaseous by-products can<br>
then be discharged via the discharge line 8 and passed to a<br>
work-up. As a result of the outflow of the gaseous by-products,<br>
the pressure in the reaction vessel drops, so that the pressure<br>
falls below the pressure set in the pressure-regulating valve 9.<br>
The pressure-regulating valve 9 closes again as a result. In<br>
this way, the pressure prevailing in the reaction vessel, i.e.<br>
in the reaction system formed by the main tank 1, the line 3 and<br>
the turbulence-reduction tank 2, can be kept approximately con-<br>
stant. The pressure resistance of the main tank 1, the turbu-<br>
lence-reduction tank 2 and the line 3 can therefore be designed<br>
accordingly.<br>
Example: Synthesis of ZSM-12<br>
To produce the ZSM-12 zeolite, a synthesis gel composition hav-<br>
ing the following composition:<br>
8.5952 H2O : SiO2 : 0.0099 A12O3 : 0.0201 Na2O : 0.1500 TEAOH.<br>
TEAOH = tetraethylammonium hydroxide,<br>
was prepared.<br>
271.2 g of sodium aluminate and 99.1 g of NaOH were dissolved in<br>
94 98.3 g of an aqueous solution of tetraethylammonium hydroxide<br>
(35% by weight) and 15 905.3 g of water while stirring. The so-<br>
lution was placed in a 40 liter capacity pressure vessel which<br>
was provided with a stirrer. A turbulence-reduction tank having<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
a volume of 300 ml was connected to the pressure vessel via a<br>
line which had an internal diameter of 5 mm. The turbulence-<br>
reduction chamber was equipped with an adjustable spring valve<br>
via which gas could be discharged from the turbulence-reduction<br>
tank into the surroundings. While stirring vigorously,<br>
10 227.1 g of precipitated silica having a specific surface area<br>
of 170 m2/g was added in small portions. A highly viscous gel<br>
which had a pH of 13.7 at 24.0°C was obtained. The pressure ves-<br>
sel was closed and the contents were heated at 163°C for 12<br>
hours and then maintained at this temperature for a total reac-<br>
tion time of 155 hours. The pressure-regulating valve was set<br>
during this time to a counterpressure of 12 bar. During the re-<br>
action time, the pressure-regulating valve opened at intervals<br>
so that gas phase was discharged from the reaction system.<br>
After 155 hours had elapsed, the pressure vessel was cooled to<br>
room temperature. The solid product was separated from the<br>
mother liquor by filtration and subsequently washed with demin-<br>
eralized water until the conductivity of the washings was below<br>
100 us/cm. The filtercake was dried at 120°C in the presence of<br>
air for 16 hours and subsequently calcined in the presence of<br>
air. In the calcination, the dried solid was firstly heated to<br>
120°C at a heating rate of 1 K/min and maintained at this tem-<br>
perature for 3 hours. It was subsequently heated to 550°C at a<br>
heating rate of 1 K/min and this temperature was maintained for<br>
5 hours.<br>
Examination by X-ray diffraction indicated that ZSM-12 had been<br>
formed. Examination by scanning electron microscopy shows ag-<br>
glomerates which have a diameter of about 0.8 urn and are made up<br>
of small primary crystallites. The agglomerates display a broc-<br>
coli-like structure.<br><br>
