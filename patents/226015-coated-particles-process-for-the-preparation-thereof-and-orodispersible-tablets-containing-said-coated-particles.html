TASTE-MASKING COATED PARTICLES, PROCESS FOR THE<br>
PREPARATION THEREOF AND ORODISPERSIBLE TABLETS<br>
CONTAINING SAID COATED PARTICLES.<br>
5<br>
The present invention concerns taste-masking coated particles  of active<br>
substance, oral  formulations including said particles, particularly, orodispersible<br>
tablets, and a process for the preparation of said particles and said tablets.<br>
10	In the context of the present invention, the term "orodispersible tablets" means<br>
tablets which are able to disintegrate in the buccal cavity in less than 60 seconds,<br>
preferably in less than 40 seconds, upon contact with saliva by formation of an easy-<br>
to-swallow suspension.<br>
Many active substances which are intended for oral formulations present<br>
15      unpleasant, bitter or irritating taste. Such a taste must be masked in order to improve<br>
the palatability of the oral formulation and, consequently, the compliance with the<br>
treatment.<br>
Taste-masking coating of such active substances is a well-kaiown method<br>
used to solve said problem. 20<br>
Specific polymers have been developed to  comply with the taster<br>
masking requirements. Said polymers present a solubility profile according to   which<br>
they are insoluble at the saliva pH, i. e. pH=6-8 in order to prevent   the active<br>
substance from contacting the tongue when the formulation is in the buccal cavity,<br>
25     but  they are   soluble at  the stomach pH, i. e. pH=l-3, to   allow    the immediate<br>
release  of the  active    substance  and  its    absorption     by     the gastrointestinal<br>
mucous membrane.<br>
The polymer is completely dissolved and the active substance is released 30     when both following conditions are fulfilled ;<br>
-	the residence time of the coated particles in the stomach is sufficiently long,<br>
-	the pH of the stomach is sufficiently acid.<br>
35<br>
In some cases, both conditions are not fulfilled.<br><br>
In fact, the residence time in the stomach can be very short. This is the<br>
case when the patient has eaten nothing and the stomach is empty. This is also<br>
the case when the patient drinks a large amount of water along with the drug,<br>
because the large amount of water causes the instinctive opening of the pyloric<br>
5     sphincter and the early emptying of the stomach contents into the duodenum.<br>
In the case where the formulation consists in numerous particles presenting a size not greater than a few millimeters, the passage from the pylori to the duodenum (pH5.5-6;5) and the jejunum (pH 6-7) is very/rapid-, <br>
Furthermore, the stomach pH can vary depending on whether the 10     patient has eaten or not.<br>
The uptake of an antacid can also modify the pH of the stomach which is then greatly increased and near neutral pH.<br>
In such cases, the coated particles are in a medium where the polymer is no longer soluble, but only permeable. The release of the active substance 15 depends then on the permeability of the film and on its thickness. The release of the active substance is then delayed.<br>
In order to avoid or to minimize this difficulty, it has been proposed in<br>
the International Patent Application WO91/16043 to coat the active substance<br>
with a polymer membrane which is only soluble at pH above 5 and to add an<br>
20     acidic compound in order to prevent or to limit the dissolution of the polymer<br>
membrane in the buccal cavity.<br>
However, the  use of such  a  polymer membrane with  an  acidic<br>
compound is not suitable when the active substance must be immediately<br>
released since the polymers are enteric polymers which are insoluble at the<br>
25     stomach pH and are commonly used to protect active substances which can be<br>
damaged at stomach pH.<br>
The solution proposed in WO91/16043, is thus not suitable for an immediate and complete release of active substances which need a taste-masking coating.<br>
3<br><br>
Up to now, no oral formulations comprising taste-masking particles which release the active substance at any pH value, i.e, at any level in the intestinal tract exist.<br>
It is thus highly desirable to remedy this situation and to develop<br>
5     particles of active substance, which allow an immediate and complete release<br>
of the active substance even outside the stomach pH range and which present<br>
satisfactory taste-masking properties and which can thus be included into oral<br>
formulations in   particular orodispersible  tablots. presenting   a   peasant<br>
palatability.<br>
10	The Applicant has now surprisingly found that these characteristics can<br>
be obtained by coated particles comprising a core, said core comprising the active substance and an acidic compound, said core being coated with a taste-masking coating based on a polymer which is soluble at pH of 5 or less, and which is permeable at pH above 5.<br>
15	In the context of the present invention, the term "soluble polymer" refers<br>
to polymers which have the ability to dissolve in a determined pH, substantially independantly of the amount applied when coated onto active substance, and so as to release in one hour, at least 80% (w/w) of the active substance which would have been released without coating, in vivo or in vitro.<br>
20	According to the present invention, at a pH above 5, the polymer is not<br>
soluble, but is permeable . At said pH, the acidic compound which is present in the core locally creates a very acidic micro-environment, which allows the quick dissolution of the polymer film and consequently the release of the active substance from the core.<br>
25	The acidic compound which is comprised in the core of the particles<br>
according to the present invention, is a pharmaceutical^ acceptable organic acid which is selected from the group consisting of adipic acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid or mixtures thereof.<br>
4-<br><br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the particles according<br>
to the invention, the amount of acidic compound ranges from 0.5 to 20% (w/w),<br>
preferably from 5 to 15% (w/w), and even more preferably from 5 to 10% (w/w)<br>

5	The core of the coated particles according to the invention comprises at<br>
least one active substance selected from the group comprising gastroenteric sedatives, antacids, antalgics, antiinflammatory agents, coronary vasodilatators peripheral and-cerebral vasodilatators and agents,<br>

The invention is not suitable for active substances which are labile in<br>
20 acidic medium, such as in the stomach or in the microenvironment created by the acidic compound, and which need gastro-protection for oral administration, for example omeprazole, lansoprazole, or active substances which irritate the stomach mucus membrane, and which need sustained release because of their<br>
ulcerous effects, such as diclofenac, erythromycin and  its derivatives and<br>
25     doxycycline.<br>
The active substance which is initially in pulverulent or microcrystalline form, is used in the dry state for preparing particles, and in the form of organic or aqueous solution or suspension for layering on an inert carrier.<br><br>

Advantageously the particle size of the  coated particle ranges<br>
between 100 and 800pm and preferably between 200 and 500pm,<br>
10	The particle sizes are measured according to conventional methods<br>
such as by sieving or by laser diffraction.<br>
The invention also concerns a process for preparing the above-described coated granules.<br>
The process comprises the steps consisting in :<br>
15	-       preparing particles containing the active substance, and the<br>
acidic  compound,  and  optionally at  least one  excipient<br>
selected from the group consisting in an inert carrier, a<br>
binder, an antistatic agent, a diluent agent, a permeabilizing<br>
agent and mixtures thereof,<br>
20	-       coating   the   particles   by   spraying   thereon   a   coating<br>
composition based on a polymer which is soluble at a pH of 5 or less and which is permeable at a pH above 5, drying the thus obtained coated granules. In this process the mixing, granulating and coating steps can be 25     performed in different apparatuses or in the same apparatus, each step being performed in the presence of a mixture of excipients which may be identical or different.<br><br>
In an advantageous embodiment, each step is performed on a fluidized air-bed, such as for example, but not limited to Glatt GPCG-1, GPCG-5 or GPCG 120.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the polymer used for 5     granulating and the polymer used for coating are identical. The granulation step differs from the coating step by the operational parameters such as spraying flow, atomization pressure of the mixture of excipients.<br>
. Advantageously, frorn 10 to 30% of he mixture of excipients are sprayed during the granulation step, the complement to 100% being sprayed 10     during the coating step.<br>
For granulating, bottom spray granulation, tangential spray granulation, top spray granulation or high shear granulation can be used, bottom spray granulation being preferred.<br>
For coating, bottom, top and tangential spray methods can be used as 15     well as layering method, the bottom spray method of coating being preferred.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the preparation of the particles, comprises the following steps :<br>
dry mixing active substance under pulverulent form or under<br>
crystalline form, with the acidic compound and optionally with a<br>
20	diluent agent and an antistatic agent,<br>
granulating the thus obtained mixture with a binder used under dry or wet form depending on the granulation type, drying. When a fluidized air apparatus is used, a pulverulent mixture of active 25     substance, and optionally the diluent agent and the antistatic agent is charged into the apparatus, then a solution or a suspension of excipients comprising at least a binder is sprayed thereon.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the preparation of the particles consists in the following steps :<br><br>
spraying onto an inert carrier a solution or dispersion containing<br>
the  active   substance  and   the   acidic  compound,   both   being<br>
sprayed simultaneously or subsequently,<br>
drying.<br>
5	According to a third  embodiment, the preparation of the particles<br>
comprises the following steps :<br>
providing active substance particles,<br>
spraying thereon a solution of the acidic compound,<br>
drying,<br>
10	The particles obtained according to the above-described processes are<br>
then coated by spraying thereon a coating composition containing the polymer<br>
in solution, dispersion, colloidal dispersion or suspension in a solvant selected<br>
from  the   group  consisting   in  water,   organic  alcohols   such  as  ethanoi,<br>
isopropanol, acetone, and mixtures thereof,<br>
15	and then drying.<br>
Preferably the different steps are performed on a fluidized air apparatus, wherein both the position and the orientation of the spraying outlet of said apparatus can be selected.<br>
This selection results in the possibility to check the growth rate of the 20     particles and to avoid the binding phenomena due to the nature of the active substance, binding or coating composition, and the different parameters of the process.<br>
The coated particles according to the invention can be used in any oral formulations, and are particularly suitable for formulations in which the coated 25     particles are in contact with saliva.<br>
Another object of the invention is an oral formulation containing said coated particles.<br>
Said oral formulation can be a pharmaceutical powder packaged in a unidose bag, or drinkable suspensions which are presented in liquid form or as<br><br>
extemporaneous preparations to which water needs to be added before use, or tablets which are orodispersible or dispersible in a small amount of water.<br>

10	The invention also concerns the process for preparing orodispersible<br>
tablets, comprising the coated particles.<br>
The process according to the invention comprises the following  steps consisting in :<br>
dry mixing the coated particles obtained according to the above<br>
15	described process with a mixture of excipients comprising at least<br>
one disintegrating agent, a soluble diluent agent, a lubricant and<br>
optionally a swelling agent, a permeabilising agent, sweeteners,<br>
flavoring agents and colorants;<br>
tabletting the mixture to obtain a tablet,<br>
20	The tabletting step can be performed on a alternate or rotative press.<br>
The strength used during the tabletting step ranges from 5kN to 50kN, preferably from 5kN to 15kN.<br>
The hardness of the orodispersible tablets ranges from 1 to lOkp, preferably from 1 to 5 kp, such as measured according to the method described 25     in the European Pharmacopeia (2.9.8), 1kp being 9.8N.<br>
The hardness of the tablets is such that:<br>
V<br>
the tablets present a friability as measured according to the European Pharmacopeia of less than 2%,<br><br>
the dissolution profile of the tablets is identical to the dissolution profile of the<br>
coated particles contained therein; and<br>
the disintegration time of orodispersible tablets in the buccal cavity is 60<br>
seconds or less, preferably, 40 seconds or less.<br>
5	The tablets may have a diameter of 6 to 17 mm. They can be round, oval, oblong ;<br>
they may have present an outer surface which is flat or concave, and optionally they may<br>
be marked.<br>
In the case of orodispersible tables, polo punches can advantageously be used.<br>
Depending on the dosage, the tablets have a weight of 0.1 to 2.0 grams. 10<br>
The polymer which is soluble at a pH of 5 or less and which is permeable at a pH<br>
above 5 works in combination with the active substance and an acidic compound and<br>
provides synergistic and unexpected results in the buccal cavity.<br>
The invention is illustrated in further detail in the following examples. These 15      examples are only illustrative and not limitative.<br>

Table 10<br><br>
In a medium which presents a pH equivalent to the stomach pH, the organic acid has no influence on the release of the fexofenadine. At pH=6.8, the presence of the organic acid in the core of the coated particles 10 helps the solubilization of the coating film and allows the release of the f fexofenadine equivalent to the release of fexofenadine in the medium presenting the stomach pH., while the release of the fexofenadine of the comparative example (with no organic acid in the core) is delayed.<br><br><br><br>
