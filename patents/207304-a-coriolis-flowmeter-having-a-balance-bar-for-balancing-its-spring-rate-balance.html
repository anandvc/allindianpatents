FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a Coriolls flowmeter and, in particular, to a single flow tube Coriolls flowmeter that maintains dynamic balance between a flow tube and balance bar in response to changes in the density of the flowing material.<br>
PROBLEM<br>
It is a problem in single flow tube Coriolls flowmeters to maintain a dynamic balance between the vibrating flow tube with material flow and the associated balance bar. Single flow tube Coriolis flowmeters are provided with balance bars to maintain a dynamic balance of the flowmeter under varying operating conditions. Balance bars are coupled to the flowmeter's flow tube and they vibrate out of phase with the flow tube so that the combination of the balance bar and the vibrating flow tube form a dynamically balanced structure.<br>
Single flow tube Coriolis flowmeters are factory calibrated and dynamically balanced for materici having a known specific gravity or for materials having a known narrow range of specific gravities such as 0.8 to 1.0,1.0 to 1.2, etc. This is shown in U.S. 5,398,554 and EP 0 759 542 A1. These flowmeters operate satisfactorily and maintain their dynamic balance as long as their use is limited to materials having a specific gravity close to that for which the flowmeter was calibrated. However, It is not always possible for a Coriolis flowmeter to be limited In use to materials having the specific gravity for which the flowmeter was calibrated. The use of a flowmeter with materials of other densities throws the flowmeter out of balance and causes it to shake with a resultant degradation in accuracy.<br>
A single flow tube Coriolis flowmeter typically comprises a flow tube, a balance bar or balance tube (hereinafter balance bar) vibrationally coupled to the flow tube and a surrounding case that encloses the flow tube and balance bar. An extension stub often extends from the flow tube through the case ends so that the flowmeter structure may be coupled to an associated pipeline whose material flow is to be measured. When dynamic balance of a flowmeter is achieved, the end node locations of zero motion are typically at the intersection of the flow tubes and the case ends. A relatively short portion of the flow tube extends inwardly from each case end to a brace bar that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flow tube and connects the flow tube to the ends of the balance bar. The material<br><br>
manner that the flow tube/balance bar pair form a dynamically balanced structure with the nodes being at the intersection of the flow tube and the case ends. When this dynamic balance is achieved, the case does not vibrate.<br>
Case vibration due to dynamic unbalance occurs when the flowmeter is operated with material having a specific gravity different from that for which the flowmeter was calibrated and balanced. Under these conditions the location of the nodes shift so that they are no longer in the case end. Depending upon the specific gravity of the new material, the vibrational nodes either shift inward (for a heavier material) away from the case end and In a direction towards the center of the flowmeter or the nodes shift outward (for a lighter material) extemal to the case and Into the pipeline. Under either condition, the case vibrates in order to satisfy the law of conservation of momentum; flowmeter accuracy is then degraded.<br>
The design of a flowmeter includes the placement of velocity sensors at advantageous locations on the flow tube with respect to the end nodes of the flow tube. It s known that e placement of sensors relatively close to the end nodes enhances flowmeter sensitivity while the placement of sensors further away from the end nodes decreases flowmeter sensitivity. It is desired that a flowmeter have a fixed and known sensitivity. The movement of the end nodes as the flowmeter is operated with materials of different densities causes the distance between the sensors and the nodes to vary. This varies the sensitivity of the meter and degrades the accuracy of its output information. Although this sensitivity change is relatively small, it is sufficiently large in critical applications so that the degraded output information causes problems for the user.<br>
In summary, the flow sensitivity of a Coriolis flowmeter is a function of the distance between its velocity sensors and the nodes which define the ends of the active flow tube length. In single flow tube flowmeters, changes in the specific gravity of the material flow cause the location of the flow tube's end nodes to change which, in turn, changes the sensitivity of the flowmeter.<br>
A traditional way of solving the balance problem in single flow tube Coriolis flowmeters is to make the case mass as great as possible in order to minimize its vibration amplitude and thereby minimize the change in nodal location. In addition, since the unbalance (which causes the flowmeter vibration) Is a function of material density, and since the material density is determined from flow tube frequency, a<br><br>
flow calibration factor in accordance with the vibration frequency of the flow tube. This is shown in EP 0 831 306 A1, The main problem with this approach is that it does not take into account the effect of the flowmeter mounting stiffness on the flowmeter vibration amplitude, A soft flowmeter mount results in higher vibration amplitude (and greater nodal location shift) of the flowmeter than does a stiff mount. The corrective algorithm used in the output Instrumentation assumes a meter mount having "an average stiffness" and thus under compensates for a soft mount and overcompensates for a stiff mount. This results In a degradation of the accuracy of the output information of the Coriolis flowmeter and its associated instrumentation. EP 0 759 542 A1 and US 5,398,554 illustrate prior art attempts to overcome the problem of maintaining meter balance over a range of fluid densities. They do this by means of manually adjustable counterbalance weights. This method has problems in that it does not allow for the accurate measurement of fluids with continuously changing density.<br>
SOLUTION<br>
The present invention solves the above problems and achieves an advance in the art by the pr-ovlsion of a flowmeter having a single flow tube, a balance bar and associated interconnecting structure that maintains the dynamic balance of the flowmeter over a wide range of material densities. This dynamic balance is maintained between the flow tube and the balance bar by controlling the characteristics of the spring structure of the balance bar, the flow tube and the connecting structure hereinafter termed a brace bar. The brace bar interconnects the ends of the balance bar with the flow tube and maintains this balance by dynamically altering the resonant frequency of the balance bar to match that of the flow tube when filled with material of different densities. In performing this function, the balance bar behaves like a dynamic balancer and automatically maintains the vibrational amplitude required to counter balance the vibrational amplitude of the flow tube and the material therein.<br>
Two fundamental laws of vibrating systems apply to the present invention. The first is that (in the absence of external forces) momentum must be conserved. This means that the mass times velocity In one direction is equal to the mass times velocity in the opposite direction.  In a balanced flowmeter the mass of the flow<br><br>
mass of the balance bar times its velocity in the opposite direction, (In sinusoidal motion, velocity is proportional to vibration amplitude. Since the different points along the flow tube and balance bar have varying amplitudes, this becomes a calculus problem,) In an unbalanced flowmeter this law still holds, but the flowmeter case mass, and the connected pipeline mass are also involved since they vibrate either with the flow tube or the balance bar. No matter how much of the worid is shaken by the flowmeter, the vibrating masses can be divided Into two groups; those vibrating with the flow tube and those vibrating with the balance bar. Consen/ation of momentum requires that the total momentum of these two groups is equal and opposite.<br>
The second law pertinent to the present invention is that the two halves of a two body vibrating system must have the same resonant frequency. If they didn't have the same resonant frequency, they would constitute separate vibration modes and not the two halves of the same mode. Resonant frequency Is equal to the squre root of stess ss/mass. Therefore, the two mass groups having the same resonant frequency must have the same stiffness to mass ratio.<br>
In a Corlolis flowmeter the stiffness and mass are spatially distributed throughout the meter. In such a complex structure, some regions act primarily as masses while other regions act primarily as springs. A simple cantilever beam vibrating in its first bending mode is used to illustrate this concept. It has uniform mass distribution and uniform stiffness along its length. The mass near the vibrating end of the beam has more effect on its resonant frequency than the mass near the fixed end. Thus, the mass function, which is the product of the local mass times the local amplitude of vibration, is concentrated near the vibrating end, Similariy, the stiffness of the vibrating end has little effect on the resonant frequency while the stiffness at the fixed end has a large influence. Thus, the spring function, which is the product of the local spring rate k times the local bending moment, is,concentrated near the fixed end.<br>
In prior art Coriolis flowmeters (such as that of EP0759542A1) the flow tube and balance bar are fixed at both ends so that the maximum vibration amplitude Is in the center. Thus the mass in the center has the most impact on the drive frequency. The bending moment, however, has three maximums. The moments<br><br>
Thus, three regions in each of the vibrating members share the spring function.<br>
In a balanced flowmeter, the flow tube with contained material and the balance bar have the same stiffness to mass ratio since they have the same resonant frequency. When a conventional single flow tube flowmeter is unbalanced by a material of a different density, the nodes separating flow tube structure from the balance bar structure move to accommodate the conservation of momentum of the combined structure comprising the flow tube, balance bar, anci case. With a more dense material, the nodes move inward on the flow tube so that some of the flow tube mass and case mass vibrate with the balance bar. The result of the shift of mass is that the flow tube natural frequency drops less than the increased material density would indicate because the flow tube gives up some mass to the balance bar. Also, the balance bar natural frequency drops from the added mass comprising part of the flow tube and case so that the mass/stiffness ratios and resonant frequencies of the two structures stay equal. With low density materials, the nedes move n the opposite direction and the balance bar gives up mass to the flow tube to keep the resonant frequencies equal.<br>
In the prior art solutions, the shift of the nodal positions primarily shifts mass from one member and the case to the other member. The problem is the involvement of the case mass and the fact that its shaking amplitude is a function of the mounting stiffness which is unknown. Because the case shaking amplitude is unknown, the shift in meter sensitivity is also unknown. The nodal shift with imbalance also alters the spring rates of the two members by making one "spring" longer and the other shorter. But, since the "spring function" In each member is spread throughout the structure, the nodal shift distance is very small compared to the "spring" length, and the shift in the spring rates is very small.<br>
In the present invention, the maximum bending moment of each member is concentrated in the vicinity of the end nodes rather than distributed throughout the structure. This concentration renders the localized stiffness very important in determining the resonant frequency. A shift in nodal location thus significantly alters the effective spring lengths by making one shorter and consequently stiffer and the other longer and softer (spring stiffness is Inversely proportional to spring length). In the present invention, the nodal shift with material density alters the spring rates in such a manner asto keep the resonant frequencies of the flow tube<br><br>
amplitudes of the flow tube and balance bar adjust themselves automatically to conserve momentum. By this means, the meter balance is maintained without transferring significant mass or involving the meter case,<br>
in accordance with the present invention, the spring function is concentrated in the brace bar and substantially removed from the flow tube and the balance bar. A structure's significance as a spring can be determined by the amount of spring energy it stores in its deflected state. If an area stores very little spring energy it has very little impact on the frequency of the system. The equation for spring energy, <br>
reveals that spring ergy can be made insignificant by making the stiffness, k, very small. When this is done the structure behaves as though there is a hinge or gap  location of the very soft spring. Spring energy can also be made insignificant "on by making the spring deflection, x, very small. This can be done either by reducing the loading locally or making the spring stiffness, k, so large that the loading fails lo deflect the member. When this is done the structure behaves as though there Is a rigid link in the location of the high stiffness. Both of these methods are used to remove the spring function of the flowmeter from the flow tube and balance bar. The balance bar and the flow tube still remain important to the dynamics of the system, but only as mass elements.<br>
In accordance with one possible preferred embodiment of the present invention, the flow tube is removed from the spring function by removing the mid portion of the flow tube and replacing it with flexible bellows. The bellows have such a low spring rate that they store very little energy despite their high deflection. This soft mid section of the flow tube allows it to deform like two rigid cantilever beams loosely coupled at their ends by the bellows. The bending moment in the dynamic portion of the flow tube is so effectively removed by the bellows that the flow tube halves on each side of the bellows undergo very little deformation (they remain relatively straight). The majority of spring deformation and spring energy storage is thus removed from the dynamic part of the flow tube. Because the flow tube must be continuous and cannot end at the brace bars, the flow tube ends (external to the brace bars and internal to the case ends) bend as the rigid<br><br>
(hereafter called tube stubs) store spring energy as they bend. In the optimum embodiment of the present invention substantially all of the spring energy is contained in the brace bars. The spring energy is thereby removed from the tube stubs by the use of bellows in the tube stubs which eliminate the spring energy in the same manner as do the central flow tube bellows. The entire spring function for the flow tube in the present invention is, by way of three bellows, caused to reside In the brace bar.<br>
The balance bar of the present invention is also removed from the spring function since it is also made very flexible in its center. Like the flow tube, the remainder of the balance bar is made stiff. The balance bar does not extend beyond the brace bars at its ends therefore it does not need end bellows. The combination of soft in the center and the stiff remainder effectively removes the balance bar from the spring function of the meter. The result of removing the flow tube and balance bar from the spring function of the meter is that the spring function is concentrated almost exclusively in the brace bar.<br>
The concentration of the spring function of the flowmeter In the brace bars is advantageous since the brace bars are relatively short in length and effectively comprise short springs. The flowmeter of the present invention is balanced so that the end nodes which dynamically separate the flow tube spring from the balance bar spring reside in the brace bar. Each end node thus separates the short portion of the effective spring which acts on the flow tube from the short portion of the effective spring which acts on the balance bar. Changes in material density cause slight shifts in the nodal positions which (because the springs are so short) cause one spring to get significantly shorter and stiffer and the other to get significantly longer and softer. Conservation of momentum dictates that the nodal location move toward the member with increased mass. For a more dense material the nodes move toward the flow tube while for a less dense material they move toward the balance bar. The result is that for a more dense material, the flow tube spring (located in the brace bar) gets stiffer and the balance bar spring (also located in the brace bar) gets softer. This change serves to maintain the two members at equal resonant frequencies. Conversely, for a less dense material, the nodes move toward the balance bar, the flow tube spring gets softer and the balance bar spring gets stiffer, and equal resonant frequencies are maintained.<br><br>
act like tuned dynamic balancers for each other. As such, they adjust their relative vibration amplitudes so that momentum is conserved without involving significant case or pipeline vibration. Balance is maintained by altering the vibrating member's spring rates rather than masses. This has a great advantage over the prior art in that reduced case and pipeline vibration reduces the change in meter sensitivity with mounting stiffness.<br>
It was stated eariier that in prior art meters the nodal shift with material density produced a slight (insignificant) change in spring rates along with a major change in mass distribution. The reason is that the balance bars of the prior art meters are tubes having either no holes (US 5,365,794) or very small holes (EP 0831306A1) through which the pick off and drive magnets protmde. This balance bar geometry has nearly constant bending stiffness throughout its length. Furthermore, the bending moment in the drive mode has three maxima; one at each end and one in the center. The combination of uniform stiffness and a bending moment maximum in the balance bar center means that a large amount of the spring energy of the balance bar is stored in this region. The central balance bar location is sufficiently far from the end nodes that nodal movement due to fluid density change d s not effect the spring energy in the center of the balance bar. The nodal mover, ^nt does effect the spring function in the vicinity of the brace bar and makes one member slightly softer and the other slightly stiffer, but the change is not enough to have a major impact on the spring rate of the balance bar. Without significant spring rate change, the prior art meters have sufficient nodal movement that the nodes leave the brace bar and move into either the balance bar (for low density fluid) or into the flow tube (for high density fluid). Either way the case vibrates in phase with either the flow tube or the balance bar in order to conserve momentum.<br>
Conversely the present invention produces a slight shift In mass distribution along with a major shift in spring rates. Two design features are necessary to keep the meter mass involvement minimal. The first is the concentration of the flowmeter spring In the vicinity of the end nodes. The other is that the connection of the flow tube/balance bar dynamic system to the case (or the world if no case is used) must be at points of no vibration amplitude. The only regions in the dynamic system which have no vibration amplitude are, of course, the end nodes.  The end<br><br>
design of the structure connecting the dynamic system to the case (hereafter termed as a case connect link) is therefore critical to maintaining the case vibration amplitude near zero.<br>
The specific design of the case connect links of the present invention is dependant upon the balance bar design. One preferred embodiment of the balance bar has the balance bar concentric with the flow tube such that the flow tube extends through the hollow center of the balance bar. The brace bars then take the form of circular rings which extend from the outside diameter of the flow tube to the inside diameter of the balance bar. The brace bar (rings) are of limited axial length so as to have the proper stiffness to impart the desired resonant frequency to the dynamic structure of the flowmeter. The brace bars are located at the ends of the balance bar.<br>
Given this optimum geometry, the nature of the deformation of each brace bar is determined. The meter is balanced so that the nodal location at each end of  within the brace bar. The inner surface of the brace bar (ring) moves with the flow tube and the outer surface moves with the balance bar. Each node therefore insists of a cylindrical surface between the brace bar outer surface and inner surface. Outward of the nodal surface, the brace bar material oscillates in phase with the balance bar and increases its oscillation amplitude with distance from the nodal surface. Inward of the nodal surface, the brace bar material oscillates in phase with the flow tube and it also has increasing amplitude with distance from nodal surface. The brace bar material is thus seen to deflect in shear, as though it were a torsional spring. The nodal surface separates the effective balance bar spring from the effective flow tube spring. When the amplitude ratio between the flow tube and the balance bar changes due to a material density change, the cylindrical nodal surface moves inward or outward changing its diameter. This changes the relative "spring" lengths and maintains equality in the natural frequencies of the two active members despite mass changes of the flow tube. The mass transfer between flow tube and balance bar that occurs with this nodal shifting is insignificant and the case mass need not be involved.<br>
The case connect links must support the dynamic structure of the meter within the case without causing case vibration. The balance bar and flow tube<br><br>
pivot at each end about common pivot axes. At the pivot axes there is no translation of the balance bar exterior but there is rotational oscillation.   In the preferred embodiment the case connect links attach to the exterior of the balance bar ends at the pivot axes. By making them stiff in translation in the direction of vibration, they can support the dynamic structure without imparting vibration to the case. By making the case connect links soft in torsion, spring energy outside of the brace bar can be avoided. In the preferred embodiment, the case connect links are flat butterfly shaped structures that extend along the pivot axes between the exterior of the balance bar and the interior of the case. There are four of them, one on each side of each balance bar end. The flat plane of the links are oriented perpendicular to the tube axis. This geometry renders the connection between the dynamic structure and the case rigid in the direction of the flow tube/balance bar vibration. The waist" of the butterfly shape, which occurs approximately half way between the balance bar and case, renders the connection between the balance bar ai:   ase co in torsion and decreases the torsional spring energy in the links,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Description of Figures 1 and 2<br><br>
center 101 of tube 104 and operating under a no flow conditions so as to create node locations 102 and 103. The flow tube 104 is associated with a left sensor SL and a right sensor SR. Dashed line 106 is the zero displacement axis of flow tube 104. Dashed line 107 is opposite the deflection extremity of flow tube 104. Figure 2 portrays the same flowmeter operating under a flow condition.<br>
In vibrating flow tube Coriolis flowmeters, the Coriolis force of the flowing material deforms the shape of the vibrating flow tube 104. This deformation, which is greatly exaggerated as element 108 in Figure 2, causes different locations along flow tube 104 to vibrate with slightly different phases. Each point along the vibrating flow tube undergoes sinusoidal motion; but during material flow, the points do not reach their maximums displacements or zero displacements simultaneously. The center of a vibrating flow tube experiences no phase change with flow while locations toward the inlet end experience increasing amounts of phase lag and locations toward the outlet end of the flow tube experience increasing amounts of leadoing phase. The points having maximum phase lag and lead are thus at the inlet and outlet ends of the vibrating portion of the flow tube. These ends are defined by nodes, or locations of zero vibration amplitude.<br>
End node 102 is assumed to be at the Inlet of the flow tube 104 while end node 103 is positioned at the outlet of flow tube 104. The portion of the flow tube to the left of its mid 101 has a phase lag in that each point on this portion of flow tube 104 passes through its zero displacement axis 106 after the corresponding point of the right side of flow tube 104 passes through zero displacement axis 106,<br>
The difference in phase between two locations on flow tube 104 is the means by which flow rate is determined. Velocity (or displacement or acceleration) sensors SL and SR are located at two locations along flow tube 104, The time delay (phase difference divided by flow tube frequency) between the sensors' output sine waves is directly proportional to the mass flow rate through flow tube 104. The phase difference and time delay between the sensors' output signals would be greatest at the end nodes 102 and 103. Locating velocity sensors SL and SR at nodes 102 and 103 would theoretically produce the most sensitive meter. However, there is no vibration amplitude to be sensed at nodes 102 and 103 since they do not move. Thus, a compromise position forthe velocity sensors SL and SR is chosen that has enough separation from nodes 102 and 103 for a reasonable<br><br>
detected sine wave. These compromise positions are usually about half way between end nodes 102 and 103 and the centrally located driver D.<br>
A change in the locations of the end nodes 102 and 103 with respect to the location of the fixed velocity sensors SL and CR changes meter sensitivity to flow. As the nodes are moved in towards the velocity s 'sors, or outwards away from the velocity sensors, the phase delay and thus the meter sensitivity changes. The locations of the flow tube end nodes 102 and 103 are detemiined by the structural design of the meter but the node positions can be altered by meter imbalance. Description of Figure 3<br>
Figure 3 discloses flow tube 104 connected by end plates 301 to a surrounding case 304A. Flow tube 104 is vibrating and has a certain amplitude. If case 304A is stationary, the nodes reside at the desired nodal locations 102 and 103, The structure is then said to be dynamically balanced. However, In Figure 3, case 304A is also vibrating at the same frequency, but 180 degrees out of phase with respect to flow tube 104 (a common situation for an unbalanced flow tube). The dashed lines 106 and 304A represent the undetected flow tube and case position. However, the desired nodal locations 102 and 103 at plates 301 are not the true nodes because of the case vibration. The true nodes are now at the locations 302 and 303 on the flow tube 104 where the flow tube 104 vibration amplitude relative to case 304 is equal and opposite to case vibration amplitude. Thus, the total vibration amplitude at nodes 302 and 303 is zero. It can be seen that the nodal locations 302 and 303 on Figure 3 have moved inwards on flow tube 104 from plates 301 due to the case vibrating out of phase with flow tube 104. Shifts In nodal location with respect to fixed position sensors SL and SR alter the flowmeter's sensitivity to flow and are undesirable.<br>
In order to keep nodes 102 and 103 at their design points within end plates 301, it is necessary to keep case 304A from vibrating. This is easily done for a single (flowing) material density by counterbalancing the spring mass system of flow tube 104 with another spring mass system of the same resonant frequency.<br>
Description of Figures 4. 5. and 6<br><br>
counterbalancing works. Two lumped masses, m' and m', are connected by an Ideal massless spring with a spring rate k. When masses m' and mg are pulled apart and released, they vibrate 180 degrees out of phase with each other at the same resonant frequency.<br>
The law of conservation of momentum requires that mass times velocity in one direction is equal to the mass times velocity in the opposite direction, or m'Vi=m2V2. Since vibration velocity Is proportional to vibration amplitude, m' A'=m2A2 where A' and Ag are vibration amplitudes. In simple temns, large mass m' must have a small vibrating amplitude compared to m'. It also follows that there is a node N having zero movement on the spring. The location of the node at N divides the spring into two lengths having lengths l/l2=A/A2. Since the node N position is fixed, each spring part behaves as though as it were fastened to a wall rather than the other part of the spring.<br>
The two halves of a two body vibrating system (on either side of spring node N) must have the same resonant frequency. Resonant frequency is equal to the square root of (stiffness/mass) or:<br><br><br>
in Figure 5, Since node N is motionless, case 304 does not vibrate. In Figure 6 an additional mass Am has been added to m' to represent a material of higher density in flow tube m'. Conservation of momentum must still apply, so the nodal location N moves toward m' to a position Nd comprising a new nodal location. This causes case 304, which is connected at N (which is no longer a node), to vibrate with m' with a vibration amplitude such that the sum of the momentums on each side of new node Nd is zero. Since the case is generally a much larger mass than either m' or mg, the node does not have to move very far from N to Nd in Figure 6 to vibrate case 304 with sufficient amplitude to conserve momentum. If mass were removed from m' rather than added to it, then the node would move from N to the right and case 304 would vibrate with m' rater than m'.<br>
In summary, in prior art single tube flowmeters, a change in mass of the flow tube 104 (mj results In enough change in the nodal location to cause the case mass to vibrate in phase with either m' or mg with enough vibration amplitude to conserve momentum. Since the case mass is large, the change in nodal position is small, the case vibration amplitude is small, and the meter sensitivity change with material density is small. However, the sensitivity change with material density is sufficiently large to degrade the accuracy required of a Coriolis flowmeter in some applications. The case may be considered to be a reference mass that is connected to the balance bar, the flow tube and the brace bar.<br>
The present invention significantly improves upon the traditional flow tube balancing method by altering the stiffness of k, and kg ratherthan involving the case mass in balancing. In the traditional approach the spring of the flowmeter structure is distributed throughout the flow tube, balance tube, and the connecting structure such as brace bars 301. The movement of the end nodes' 102 and 103 location with a material density change in flow tube 104 is very small compared to the effective "spring" length; thus the nodal movements have very little Impact on altering the effective spring rates k' and kg and are unable to achieve a dynamic balance in the stnjcture without involving case mass. Recall that:<br><br><br>
the case mass 304 to move with the light member. Thus, equality is achieved when:<br><br>
Description of Figures 7 and 8<br>
As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the present invention employs 'n extremely short spring 701 in the nodal area so that any movement in nodal position due to dynamic unbalance causes a relatively large change in the individual spring rates, k1 and kg. By altering spring rates, dynamic balance is maintained and the required mass transfer and the length of the nodal position shift is reduced. This reduces the case vibration and the change in meter sensitivity with material density.<br>
Figures is an enlargement of the spring region of figure 7. It shows how the node shifts the short distance from location 801 to 802 to regain dynamic balance after mass Am has been added to m'. It also shows how this short distance is significant compared to the short spring length. Spring k' is shortened and stiffened while spring kg is lengthened and softened enabling meter balance with much less nodal shift and case shaking than if the spring were extended throughout the structure as in prior art. The difference between the conventional balancing approach and that of the present invention is illustrated by the way the resonant frequency equality between the flowmeter elements is maintained despite a change in one of the masses.<br>
Recall from equation 2 that:<br><br>
When mass Am is added to the flow tube mass m1, such as by a change in material density, the prior art balancing method maintains the equality by adding case mass to the balance bar mass. The case vibrates under this condition.<br><br><br>
This equation requires the case mass to be directly involved in the balancing.<br>
The present invention maintains the equality of the stiffness to mass ratio by altering the spring rates, k, and kg of the flowmeter structure in response to the added mass, Am:<br><br>
This equation does not Involve the case mass and instead, alters the stiffness of k' and kz to achieve balancing. This case does not vibrate significantly since it is not involved in achieving a dynamic balance. Description of Figure 9<br>
Figure 9 shows a typical prior art flowmeter flow tube and balance bar in its deformed state. In prior art, flow tube 104 and balance bar 901 are essentially uniformly stiff along their lengths and deform throughout their lengths. The spring of the system is spread throughout the structure. The term "spring" in this context refers to a volume of metal that deforms elastically in response to applied force. It stores energy as it is deformed and returns energy back to the system as it relaxes. The whole structure of Figure 9 thus acts as a large spring. Nodal location shift, because it is very small in relation to the great spring length, does very little to alter the effective length and thus the effective spring stiffness of either the flow tube or the balance bar. Description of Figure 10<br>
One of the design details of the present Invention which enables spring rate balancing of a flowmeter, rather than mass balancing, is the localization of the spring proximate the end nodes of the flow tube. Figure 10 discloses a conceptual embodiment of structure comprising the present invention. This stmcture localizes the spring function of the flowmeter portrayed in Figure 10 in the vicinity of nodes<br><br>
and 1003 of both flow tube 104 and balance bar 1004 that are very easy to bend. This is done by the use of a less stiff material in the centers of flow tube 104 and balance bar 1004 such as rubber, or a less stiff geometry. This mid portion comprises bellows 1003 in the flow tube 104 and a necked down region 1002 In balance bar 1004. These "soft" center areas concentrate the bending of elements 104 and 1004 in this central region. Because the spring rate is so low in these central regions, the spring energy is concentrated in the regions where flow tube 104 \s connected to balance bar 1004. This area is the brace bar 1001 in Figure 10. The straight portions of flow tube 104 and balance bar 1004 are stiff and free to move, however, they do not form effective springs since their soft center portions remove the bending moments from these stiff elements. If the balance bar and flow tube central regions 1002 and 1003 are sufficiently flexible, then their stiffness is so low that it becomes insignificant in the dynamics of the spring mass system. The total spring, k, is then concentrated and becomes equal to that of brace bar 1001.<br>
Figure 11 shows a section view of the brace bar 1001 on one end of a flowmeter having flow tube 104 and balance bar 1101 (comparable to 1004). Figure 12 shows (greatly exaggerated) the defomiation in brace bar 1001 that results when flow tube 104 and balance bar 1101 have approximately equal vibrational amplitudes. The node (area experiencing no motion) is in this case a cylindrical surface 1104 (dashed lines) approximately half way between flow tube 104 wall and balance bar 1101 wall. Figure 13 shows the deformation that results when balance bar 1101 has a much larger vibration amplitude than flow tube 104. This situation results from a very high density material In flow tube 104. The dense material tends to lower the frequency and vibration amplitude of flow tube 104 (remember conservation of momentum). It can be seen that the nodal cylinder 1104 has moved very close to flow tube 104 due to the flow tube's decreased amplitude. This causes the flow tube's effective spring to become short and stiff and decreases the drop in the flow tube's resonant frequency. Simultaneously the balance bar effective spring has lengthened and softened. This causes the balance bar's resonant frequency to also drop. When properly designed, the shift in spring rate Ak within brace bar 1001 is just sufficient to balance the extra mass of the high density material in the flow tube. The resonant frequencies then drop<br><br>
desirable because case vibration amplitude changes meter sensitivity.<br>
Until now it has been assumed that the relative vibrational amplitude of flow tube 104 compared with the vibrational amplitude of balance bar 1101 decreases with a dense material and increases with a light material. With the balance bar and the flow tube having equal resonant frequencies due to the spring rate shift, this assumption is justified. If the balance bar is visualized as a dynamic balancer fastened to the flow tube at the desired end nodes, it is readily apparent that any movement at the desired nodal positions within brace bar 1001 pumps energy into the dynamic balancer formed by balance bar 1101 and increases its amplitude until the reaction force from the dynamic balancer suppresses the nodal motion. If mass is put onto flow tube 104, the dynamic balancer (the balance bar) lowers its resonant frequency to maintain frequency equality and raises its amplitude until the position of nodal cylinder 1104 is stationary. If mass is removed from flow tube 104, the dynamic balancer (balance bar) raises its resonant frequency and lowers its amplitude just the right amount. Description of Figures 14-21, 29 and 30<br>
The present invention maintains dynamic balance by altering the relative spring stiffness rather than by transferring masses between the vibrating flow tube, balance bar and case members. It Is able to accomplish this by concentrating the spring function locally around the fixed nodal area 1104 within brace bar 1001. Figures 11,12 and 13 show how this is accomplished so that flowmeter sensitivity is not affected. However, they ignore, for purposes of simplicity, a complicating factor illustrated by Figures 14 and 15. Figures 14 and 15 disclose a flowmeter case 1401 having an end portion 1405 of case 1401 which contains balance bar 1101, flow tube 104 and brace bar 1001, Flow tube 104 and the balance bar 1101 are interconnected at the end of balance bar 1101 by brace bar 1001. in Figure 14, the flow tube 104 vibrational amplitude is much larger than the balance bar 1101 amplitude. In Figure 15, the balance bar 1101 amplitude Is much larger than the flow tube 104 amplitude. These situations would balance a meter having a light material (Figure 14) and dense material (Figure 15) respectively.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 differ from Figures 11,12 and 13 in that flow tube 104 is bending in the flow tube segment 1404 between brace bar 1001 and case end 1405 in response to the torque applied to flow tube 104 In brace bar 1001 region.<br><br>
balance bar 1101. The flowmeter can be designed so that for a given material density the torque applied by balance bar 1101 to the brace bar is equal and opposite to the torque applied by flow tube 104 (Figure 16). However, as material density changes, the amplitude ratio between the flow tube 104 and balance bar 1101 changes and the torque becomes unbalanced. This torque is resisted by the case connect links 1701 (Figure 17) and case end 1405, where flow tube segment 1404 penetrates it, resulting in equal and opposite forces F' and F2. H can now be appreciated why case connect links 1701 must be rigid in translation in the direction of vibration. Case connect links 1701 must resist force F' lest the desired nodal locations be forced to translate by F' and the entire structure becomes unbalanced. Case end 1405 and case connect links 1701 transfer the forces to case 1401 which is extremely rigid and where the forces cancel each other resulting in no shaking forces on the case. When both ends of case 1401 are taken into consideration (Figure 19) the moments on case 1401 also cancel.<br>
Case connect links 1701 have specific design criteria imposed upon them. They must be rigid enough that they prevent significant relative motion between the nodal region of brace bar 1001 and case 1401. Simultaneously they must be sufficiently flexible in torsion so that the balance bar 1101 ends are free to rotate without storing significant spring energy in the connecting links 1701. If spring energy were stored in case connect links 1701, it would be external to the nodal area and degrade the self balancing performance of the meter. One possible preferred design of the connecting links is butterfly or hour glass shaped as in Figures 17 and 20. The narrow central section 1702 allows foraflexibility in torsion but not translation. The wide ends 1703 and 1704 provide sufficient stiffness to resist translational forces. The central section 1702 does not have to be wide to resist the translational forces because the bending moments that accompany the translation forces on the link go to zero in the center of the link as is shown in the bending moment diagram of Figure 21.<br>
Case connect links 1701 can also be used to solve another design problem. Flow tube 104 and balance bar 1101 are driven to vibrate in a resonant frequency opposed to each other. They are driven to vibrate in a direction that, along with the tube axis defines a plane called the drive plane. The flow tube and the balance bar also have a vibration mode in which they vibrate in a direction perpendicular to the<br><br>
bar, it Is likely that the frequency of the perpendicular vibration mode is very near to the drive frequency. This narrow frequency separation can cause measurement problems and should be avoided. A way to increase the frequency separation between the drive mode and the perpendicular mode is to put thin metal gussets between the case connect links and balance bar as is shown in Figure 29 and Figure 30. Gussets 2901 are fastened to case connect links 1701 and balance bar 1101. This orientation stiffens case connect links to the bending deflection required in the perpendicular mode. It thereby stiffens the balance bar mounting and raises the frequency in the perpendicular mode. Because the gussets are thin, they do not significantly increase the torsional rigidity of the case connect links or raise the frequency of the drive mode. Furthermore, they do not impact the stiffness of the case connect links in translation in the drive direction.<br>
The torque applied to tube stub 1404 by forces F' and Fg causes one other problem in that each tube stub bends in response to the torque. This flexing of flow tube stub 1404 external to brace bar 1103 is a significant extension of the spring function of the flow tube away from the nodal area. As has been* previously discussed, it is desirable to concentrate the spring function of the meter in the vicinity of the node. This extension of the spring structure degrades the spring balancing of the meter. Description of Figures 22  28<br>
The spring energy stored in tube stub 1404 is reduced by reducing the spring rate of flow tube stub 1404 by the provision of a softer material or a softer geometry such as bellows 2201 on Figure 22. Bellows 2201 reduce the spring energy in tube stub 1404 so as to further concentrate it In brace bar 1001 regions. Bellows 2201 also greatly reduces the torque forces applied to case 1401 bythe tube stubs 1404. They reduce these forces by allowing the brace bar region 1001 to pivot freely. From a self balancing perspective, the design of Figure 22 and, with the case removed, Figure 23 is a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 23 shows a flowmeter similar to that of Figure 22 but without case 1401 being shown. In particular, the flowmeter structure shown on Figure 23 comprises flow tube 104 having a bellows 1003 in its mid section and bellows 2201 in its tube stub 1404 sections. Flow tube 104 is surrounded by balance bar 1101 having a flexible center cutaway-portion 2402 defined by the reduced section 1002<br><br>
Figure 23 further includes case connection links 1701. The structure of Figure 23 thus, is preferred in applications in which dynamic balance is the primary criteria. Dynamic balance is achieved by the structure of Figure 23 since it concentrates the spring structure of the flow tube 104 and balance bar 1101 in brace bars 1001 proximate the end nodes.<br>
In some applications bellows may negate some of the features that make a single straight flow tube flowmeter desirable. Bellows are difficult to clean intemally. This makes bellows unacceptable in food applications, for instance, where it is necessary that the entire internal surface of the flow tube be cleanable and subject to inspection.<br>
In cases where it is desirable to have flow tube 104 of a continuous uniform diameter and material, the flow tube's 104 central region and tube stub 1404 regions are not made soft in bending. It is still advantageous to make the central region 1002 of balance bar 1101 soft in bending and to use case connect links 1701 at the brace bars 1001. Figure 24 is similar to Figure 23 except that flow tube 104 is devoid of the bellows 2201 and 1003 of Figure 23. The embodiment of Figure 24 would be best preferred in applications where interior of flow tube 104 must be smooth and continuous. Thus, flow tube 104 of Figure 24 does not have the flexibility afforded by the bellows 2201 and 1003 of Figure 23.<br>
The flowmeter of Figure 24 is balanced so that the node is still in the brace bar 1001 region. Furthermore, the balance bar 1101 spring is still concentrated in brace bar 1001 proximate the node as in Figure 23. On the flow tube 104 side of the node, the brace bar 104 portion of the flow tube spring is now in series with a relatively soft and distributed spring (the bending flow tube). When additional mass is placed on the flow tube, the nodal location moves toward the flow tube and significantly softens the balance bar 1101 spring as before described for Figure 13. The net flow tube spring, however, consists of the soft flow tube spring and a portion of the stiff brace bar 1001 spring in series. Springs in series add rates like resisters in parallel; the soft one (or small resistor) dominates.<br><br><br>
in a net spring rate of 9.1 pounds per inch. If the stiffer spring were changed to 130 pounds per inch as might occur with nodal movement, the net series result would be a spring rate of 9.3 pounds per inch. Thus a 30% change in the stiffness of the stiff spring is seen to produce only a 2% change in the stiffness of the combined springs. The net flow tube 104 spring rate is thus dominated by the soft flow tube spring and the nodal position change in the brace bar 1001 spring has little effect on the rate of the net flow tube 104 spring function.<br>
The spring function of flow tube 104 of Figure 24 is illustrated conceptually on Figures 25 and 26. In Figure 25, the flow tube 104 mass is represented by ml. The net flow tube spring is represented by k1 which is the series addition of the soft distributed flow tube 104 spring and the stiff portion of the brace bar 1001 to the left of node N. The larger balance bar 1101 mass is represented by the mass mj whose spring kg is concentrated in brace bar 1001. The node of this structure in the balanced condition is represented by node N at location 2501. In Figure 26 mass Am is added to the flow tube 104, such as when a heavy material is introduced into the flow tube, which causes the node N shift to the left to position 2601, This nodal shift causes a significant shift in the spring length and spring rate of spring segment k2, the balance bar 1101 spring. The flow tube 104 spring, however is made up of the soft distributed spring in the flow tube which does not change length in series with the short stiff spring of the brace bar on the flow tube side of the new nodal position. Even though the brace bar 1001 component is shortened significantly by the nodal movement, the distributed tube spring dominates the spring rate and the nodal shift makes little difference to the flowtube 104 overall spring stiffness. This geometry of Figure 24 is thus a compromise with regard to maintaining balance with change in material density. The balance bar 1101 can change its spring rate but the flow tube 104 must change its mass by moving case 1401. The result is that the case does vibrate. However, the case movement is much less than prior art meters because the stiffness change in balance bar 1101 reduces the necessary mass transfer. This reduction in case vibration results in a smaller change in the nodal position and accuracy improvement in the flowmeter compared to the prior art.<br><br>
bellows in the flow tube) of the present invention still results in less case shaking than the prior art meters.<br><br>
This equation differs from the traditional approach (Equation 4) in the Aktemn. The presence of this term means that the case mass needs less involvement (vibration amplitude) in order to balance the equation and the meter.<br>
Figures 27 and 28 disclose the structure of an entire Coriolis flowmeter embodying the present invention. Figure 27 comprises the embodiment wherein the flow tube 104 does not include a bellows. The embodiment of Figure 28 is similar to that of Figure 27 except that the center portion of flow tube 104 and tube stubs 1404 areas include the bellows 2201 and 1003. Both embodiments show case end 1405 being connected by element 2702 to a flange 2701 by means of which the flowmeters of Figures 27 and 28 may be connected to a source of material such as a pipeline on its input and to a receiver of material on its output end-Both embodiments of Figures 27 and 28 include a driver D in the mid portion of flow tube 104 and a left sensor SL and SR for detecting movements representative of Coriolis vibrations of the flow tube/balance bar structure which, in turn, is indicative of the material flow rate through the flowmeter.<br>
It is to be expressly understood that the claimed invention is not to be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment but encompasses other modifications and alterations within the scope and spirit of the inventive concept. Thus, the term "material" as used herein Is applicable to any substance that flows such as slurries, liquids and gasses including any combination thereof.<br><br><br><br>
