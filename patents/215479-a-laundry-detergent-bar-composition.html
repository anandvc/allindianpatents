				<td>FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry bar composition comprising a bleach containing laundry detergent bar composition having perfume.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In societies where mechanical washing machines are hot common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency phosphate builders are used in the laundering of clothes. Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability, and feel; which have low smear; and which have a pleasing odor and appearance. Methods for making laundry detergent bars are also well known in the art. Prior art disclosing laundry bars and methods for making laundry bars include: U.S. Pat. 3,178,370, Okenfuss, issued April 13, 1965; and Philippine Pat. 13,778, Anderson, issued September 23, 1980.<br>
Laundry bar compositions which comprise bleach, especially peroxygen bleach, aid in the removal of different kinds of stains, as well as aid in whitening the appearance of the fabric. In addition, laundry bar compositions contain perfume. Consumers prefer perfume in the composition which is pleasant to smell. There are many perfumes known in the art of detergent compositions; some perfumes are made from a mixture of perfume raw materials.<br>
Bar compositions containing peroxygen bleach in combination with a perfume which contain a high level of cinnamic aldehyde give off a malodor. Although not wanting to be limited by theory, the cinnamic aldehyde material is converted to benzaldehyde during the processing of the bar ingredients when forming a laundry bar. The resultant benzaldehyde is the cause of the malodor, and the cinnamic aldehyde raw material is believed to be the precursor of the malodor. Therefore, it has now been found that peroxygen bleach containing •<br>
laundry bars comprising a perfume having low levels of cinnamic are substantially free of malodor.<br>
None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a laundry detergent bar composition comprising:<br>
(a)	from 0.1% to 20% peroxygen bleach; and<br>
(b)	from 0.001% to 1.0% of a perfume, wherein the perfume<br>
comprises less than 1% of cinnamic aldehyde, by weight of the<br>
perfume;<br>
(c)	balance being conventional adjunct ingredients.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to a laundry detergent bar composition comprising from about 0.1% to about 20% peroxygen bleach; and a perfume, wherein the perfume comprises less than about 1% of cinnamic aldehyde, by weight of the perfume.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed that the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
All percentages are by weight of total composition unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
As used herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encbmpasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of".<br>
All  cited  references are  incorporated  herein by reference  in  their entireties.     Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention. A.       Peroxygen Bleach<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises from about 0.1% to about 20% peroxygen bleach, by weight of the total bar composition. Preferably, the bar composition comprises from about 1% to about 10%, more preferably, from about 2% to about 5% peroxygen bleach, by weight of the total bar composition.<br>
The peroxygen bleach of the present invention are those peroxygen bleaching compounds which are capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an<br>
aqueous solution, These compounds are well Known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide and the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxide bleaching compounds such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and the like. Mixtures of two or more such bleaching compounds can also be used, if desired. Preferred peroxygen bleaches include perborate, percarbonate, persulfate, peroxide, peroxohydrates, perphosphates, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Specifically referred peroxygen pleaching compounds to be used in the present invention include sodium perborate, commercially available in the form of mono- and telra-hydrates, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrats, and sodium peroxide, Particular preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate, and especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is especially preferred because it is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleaching solution.<br>
Persulfate bleach (e.g., OXONE, manufactured commercially by DuPont) can also be used,<br>
Other peroxygen bleach agents can also be used such as a percarbonate bleach. Such percarbonate bleach comprises dry particles having an average particle size in the range from about 500 micrometers to about 1,000 micrometers, not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being smaller than about 200 micrometers and not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being larger than about 1,250 micrometers, Optionally, the percarbonate can be coated with silicate, borate or water-soluble surfactants. Percarbonate is available from various commercial sources such as FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka, B. Perfume<br>
Cinnamic aldehyde is a common raw material for perfumes and therefore many perfumes, especially those used in laundry detergent compositions, contain cinnamic aldehyde. It has now been found that perfumes which contain low levels (if any) of cinnamic aldehyde in bleach bar compositions do not give off malodor after the bar has been processed.<br>
The composition of the present invention contains a perfume, wherein the perfume contains less than about 1.0% of cinnamic aldehyde. Preferably, the perfume contains from about 0.0% to about 1.0% of cinnamic aldehyde, More<br><br>
preferably, the perfume contains less than about 0.2% of cinnamic aldehyde, even more preferably lass than about 0.04%, by weight of the perfume. It is preferable that the perfume is substantially free of cinnamic aldehyde.<br>
The perfume may contain only cinnamic aldehyde, or may contain other perfume raw materials in addition to cinnamic aldehyde,<br>
Cinnamic aldehyde, or cinnamaldehyde is also denoted by the following structure below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Although not wanting to be limited by theory, as discussed in the background section, it is believed that the cinnamic aldehyde material is converted to benzaldehyde during the processing of the bar ingredients when forming a laundry bar. In the presence of peroxygen bleach under alkaline • conditions, cinnamic aldehyde is believed to be oxidized into epoxide and then converted to benzaldehyde. The resultant benzaldehyde is believed to be the cause of the malodor, and the cinnamic aldehyde raw material is believed to be the precursor of the malodor. See also, Wright and Abott, "The Oxidation of Cinnamaldehyde with Alkaline Hydrogen Peroxide", International Journal of Chemical Kinetics, Vol. 25, 901-911 (1993); Guthrie et aj., "The Retroaldol Reaction of", Can. J. Cham. 62,1441 (1984).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may contain a total amount of perfume (including the cinnamic aldehyde), by weight of the composition, of from about 0,001% to about 1%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.5%. C.      Adjunct Ingredients<br>
