NEW MATERIALS FOR INJECTING OR TRANSPORTING HOLES AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENCE DEVICES USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present, invention relates to a novel compound that can greatly improve lifespan, efficiency and thermal stability of organic light omitting devices, and to an organic light. emitting device comprising the same compound in an organic compound layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
In the era of advanced information technology of the 21st century, a great deal of information should bo obtained promptly with ease, and thus an importance of. the high performance flat panel display for multimedia increases. Although liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have ployed the main part of" flat panel displays up to now, many attempts are made to develop novel flat, panel displays that are cost-efficient, show excellent performance and are differentiated from liquid crystal displays all over the world. Organic electroluminescence (EL) devices or organic light emitting devices chat are expected to play an important role as advanced flat panel displays have advantages of lower drive voltage, higher response rate, higher efficiency and wider view angle, compared to liquid crystal displays. In addition, because displays using organic electroluminescence phenomenon permit a total module thickness of 2 mm or less and can be manufactured on plastic substrates having a thickness of 0.3 mm or less, it is possible to meet the trend of thinning and downsizing of displays. Moreover, organic electroluminescence displays have an<br>

WO 2005/090512	PCT/KR2005/000794<br>
additional advantaqe in that thay are produced lower cost compared to liquid crystal displays.<br>
Organic .1 :. qht omit tinq devices are. based on the mechanism wherein electrons and holes injected to an organic film formed of organic; compounds through an anode and a cathode form oxitons when they are recombined and then light havinq a certain wavelength is emitted from 'he exitons. In ]965, Pope et al . found electroluminescence in an anthracene single cryst.i 1 for the first time. Following this, in 1987, Tang el al. in Kodak Co. found that an organic light emitting device formed of organic materials with a structure having separate functional. laminated layers, i.e., a hole transport layer and light emitting layer laminated to each other, can provide a high luminance of 1000 cd/m2 or higher even under a low voitage of 10V or less. After those findings, organic light, emitting devices has been a matter of great interest in the field of display technology (Tang, C.W.; Vanslyke, S. A. Appl. Phys. Lett. 1987, 51, 913). Such organic light emitting devices are classified into those using fluorescence and those using phosphorescence capable of providing a high efficiency of up to three times of the fluorescence-based efficiency. Alternatively, such organic light emitting devices may be classified according to molecular' weights of the organic materials forming organic light emitting devices, i.e., those prepared by a low-molecular weight method wherein a device is formed by using a vacuum sublimation process and those prepared by a high-molecular weight method wherein a device is formed by using solution processes such as a spin coating, ink jet printing or roll coating process.<br>

WO 2005/090512	PCT/KR20005/000794<br>
As shown in. FIG. I , a conventional organic Light emitting device "includes an anode, a hole injection layer that accepts. holes from the anode, a hole transport layer that: transports holes, a light emitting layer in which holes and electrons are recombined to emit light, an electron transport layer that accepts electrons from a cathode and transport them to the liqht emitting layer, and a cathode. The above thin film layers are formed by a vacuum deposition process. The reason for manufacturing organic light emitting devices having a multilayered thin film structure is as follows. It is possible to transport, holes and electrons to a light emitting layer more efficiently when a suitable hole transport layer and electron transport layer are used, because the moving rate of holes is significantly higher than that of electrons in organic materials. Additionally, it is possible to increase luminous efficiency when hole density is balanced with electron density in a light emitting layer.<br>
Hereinafter, a conventional organic light emitting device will be explained referring to FTG. 1.<br>
A substrate 1 is the support for an organic light emitting device and may be formed of a silicone wafer, quartz or glass plate, metal plate, plastic film or sheet, etc. Preferably, glass plates or transparent plates made of synthetic resins such as polyester, polymethacrylate or polysulfone are used.<br>
A first electrode (anode) 2 is disposed on the substrate 1. The anode serves to inject holes to a hole injection layer 3 and may be formed of metals such as aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, palladium or platinum, metal oxides such as indium-tin oxides or indium-zinc<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br>
oxides, halogennated metals, carbon black, or conductive polymers such as poly(3-methylthiophene), polypyrrole or polyani1ine.<br>
The hole injection layer 3 is disposed on the anode 2. Materials used in the hole injection layer have to provide high efficiency of hole injection from the anode and have to transport. the injected holes efficiently. In this regard, the materials should have low ionization potential, high transparency to visible light and excellent stability to holes.<br>
Materials for the hole injection layer include compounds that have excellent thermal, stability while maintaining a stable interface with the anode. Typical examples of the materials include copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), which is a porphyrin-copper complex disclosed in US Patent No. 4,356,429 by Kodak, Co. Because CuPc is the most stable compound for use in a hole injection layer, it has been used widely. However, it shows an absorption band at the blue and red zones, and thus has problems when manufacturing full-color display devices. Recently, starburst-like aromatic aryl amine compounds having no absorption band at the blue zone are known (US Patent No. 5,256,945 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 1999-219788, and see the following formulae 4-12). Particularly, among the starburst-like amines having no absorption band at the blue zone, compounds represented by the following formulae 8-12 having a glass transition temperature of 1000c or higher and excellent stability are used.<br>

Recently, many hole injection materials having a higher glass transition temperature and more improved thermal stability have been reported. Most of them are compounds derived irom NPB of Kodak, Co. and are represented by the following formulae 13-17 'see,, Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. elei9-301934 and US Patent Nos. 6,334,283 and 6,541,129).<br><br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br><br>
Additionally, Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 2003-23850] discloses aromatic oligoamine derivatives having at least five nitrogen atoms in one molecule (formulae 18 and 19).<br><br>
Further, more recently, Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>

No. 2003-317966 and US Patent No. 6, 660, 410 disclose a carbazole group containing material (formula 20), which is specifically used as host forming a light omitting layer in. an. organic light emitting device using phosphorescence and is claimed to improve the lifespan of an organic light emitting device compared to conventionally known CBP (carbazole biphenyl ) . Other compounds used in a hole injection layer are represented by the following formulae 21-27.<br><br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br><br>
A hole transport layer 4 is disposed on the hole injection layer 3. The hole transport layer serves to accept holes from the hole injection layer and transport them to an organic light, emitting layer 5 disposed thereon. The hole transport layer has high hole transportability and stability to holes. It also serves as a barrier to protect electrons. In addition to the above-mentioned basic requirements, when it is used in display devices for cars, tor example, it. is preferable that the materials for a hole transport layer have an improved heat resistance and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 80°C or higher. Materials satisfying such requirements incJude NPB, spyro-arylamine compounds, perylene-arylamine compounds, azacycloheptatriene compounds, bis(diphenylvinylphenyl) anthracene, silicon germanium oxide compounds, silicon-containing arylamine compounds, or the like.<br>
Meanwhile, as an important organic single molecules for a hole transport layer, there is arylamine compounds having high hole transport rate and excellent electrical stability. In order to improve thermal stability of arylamine compounds, hole transport<br>

materials into which. a naphthyl substituent or spyro group is introduced are reported (see, US Patent. Nos. 5,554,159 and 5,840,217). In the beginning, N,N'-diphenyl -N, N' b.i s ( 3-rnethylphenyl.) -1, 1' -di.phenyl-4, 4' -diamine (TPD) is frequently used as organic hole transport, material. However, because TI'D is unstable at a temperature of 60°C or higher, N-naphthyl N-phenyl-1 , 1' -diphenyl- 4 , 4 ' -diamine (NPD) based materials or amine compounds substituted with a greater number of aromatic groups that have a higher glass transition temperature are used at the present time. Particularly, organic single molecules for use in a hole transport layer should have high hole transport. rate. Additionally, because a hole transport layer is in contact with a light emitting layer and forms an interface therebetween, organic single materials for a hole transport layer should have an adequate ionization potential value of between that of a hole injection layer and that of a light emitting layer so as to inhibit the generation of exitons at the interface between hole transport layer and light emitting layer. Further, the organic single materials for a hole transport layer are required to control the electrons transported from the light emitting layer.<br>
An organic light emitting layer 5 is disposed on the hole transport layer 4. The organic light emitting layer, which serves to emit lights by the recombination of holes and electrons injected from the anode and cathode, respectively, is formed of materials having high quantum efficiency.<br>
Organic single molecules for use in a light emitting layer where light emission is accomplished by<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br>
the recombination of holer; and electrons are classified functionally into host materials and guest materials. In general, host material;; or guest materials can accomplish light, emission when used alone. However, host mater i.ais are doped with guest materials in order to solve the problems of low efficiency and luminance and the problem of self-pack ing of the same molecules that causes the excimer characteristics to come out in addition to the unique characteristics of each molecule. More particularly, as green light omitting layer, 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum salt (Aiq3) is uniquely used and may be doped with high-quantum efficiency materials such as quinacridone or C54 51 so as to increase luminous efficiency. Organic materials for a blue Light emitting layer have problems in that they have low melting points and low luminous stability at the initial time and that they have poor lifespan, compared to Alq3 as urecn light emitting material. Additionally, because most materials for a blue light emitting layer represent a light blue color rather than pure blue color, they are not suitable for full-color version displays, and so, they are also doped with perylene or distryl amines (DSA) to increase luminous efficiency. Typical organic materials for a blue light emitting layer include aromatic hydrocarbons, spyro-type compounds, aluminum-containing organometallic compounds, heterocyclic compounds having an imidazole group, fused aromatic compounds, as disclosed in US Patent Nos. 5,516,577, 5,366,811, 5,840,217, 5,150,006 and 5,645,948. Meanwhile, in the case of a red light emitting layer, a large amount of green light emitting material doped with a small amount of red light emitting material is used due to the characteristically narrow<br>

WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br>
band gap of red light emission. However, such materials have structural problems disturbing the improvement of: lifespar..<br>
An elecVron transport, layer. 6 is disposed on the organic light emitting layer 5. In the electron transport layer 6, such materials as having high electron injection efficiency from a cathode 7 (a second electrode) and capable of transporting the injected electrons efficiently are used. For satisfying this, the materials should have hiqh electron affinity and electron moving rate and excellent stability to electrons. Materials that meet the above requirements include: aromatic compounds such as tetraphenylbutadiene (Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. Sho57-51781) , metal complexes such as 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. Sho59-194 393) , metal complexes of 10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinoline (Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. Hei6-322362) , cyclopentadiene derivatives (Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. Hei2-289675), bisstyrylbenzene derivatives (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Nos. Hei1 -245087 and Hei2-222484) , perylene derivatives (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Nos. Hei2-189890 and Hei3-791), p-phenylene derivatives (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Nos. Hei 3-33183 and Hei11-345686), oxazole derivatives, or the like.<br>
Additionally, preferred organic single molecules-for use in an electron transport layer include organometal complexes having relatively high stability to electrons and high electron moving rate. Particularly, it is reported that Alq3 is the most preferred, because it has excellent stability and high electron affinity. In addition to the above-mentioned materials, other electron transport materials known to<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br>
one skilled in the art include Flaven or silol scries available from Chisso Corporation.<br>
There is no especially preferred candidate ot hei than the above materials for use in the electron transport layer. Generally, electron transport materials are used in the form of a mixture with metals for use in cathodes. Otherwise, inorganic materials such as lithium fluoride (LiF) may be used.<br>
The cathode 7 serves to inject electrons to the organic light emitting layer b. As materials for the cathode, the materials used in the anode 2 may be used. However, it is preferable to use metals having low work function in order to inject electrons more efficiently. Particular examples of the metals include lithium, cesium, sodium, tin, magnesium, indium, calcium, aluminum, etc., and alloys thereof.<br>
However, the organic electroluminescence display device using organic single molecules suitable for each of the Layers forming the device generally has short life span and has problems that it provides poor shelf durability and reliability. It is thought that such problems result from physical, chemical, photochemical and electrochemical changes in organic materials, oxidation of cathode, interlayer separation, and melting, crystallization and pyro.lysis of organic compounds.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As described above, conventional hole injection materials including organometa.l complexes such as CuPC, arylamine compounds and carbazole group-containing materials. have problems in that they have a difficulty in realizing full color and show poor stability.<br>
The present inventors have synthesized novel organic compounds containing a carbazole group, represented by the following formula 1. And They have found that the above novel compounds can provide significantly improved efficiency, lifespar. and thermal stability of an organic light emitting device, when used as hole injection and transport materials.

As described above, it is possible to realize desired color in an organic electroluminescence device by modifying the structure of a suitable organic single molecule. In this regard, various high-efficiency organic electroluminescence devices are provided by using host-guest systems. However, such devices show insufficient luminance characteristics, lifespan and durability for practical use. Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems. It is an object of the present invention to<br>

In the above formulae 2a--2e and 3a-3n, each of Rl-R8 is the same as defined with regard to the above formula 1.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail.<br>
The organic compounds represented by the formula of 1, 2 or 3 are capable of serving as hole injection and hole transport materials, and thus can be used in at least one layer selected from a hole injection layer, hole transport layer and a light emitting layer in an organic light emitting device.<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br>
Particularly, each of the compounds comprises a<br>
carbazole qroup and accepts and transports holes with<br>
ease. It is thought that such functions result from the<br>
cyclic structure present in the carbazole qroup and the<br>
presence of an aryl group bonded to the carbazolo group.<br>
Therefore, an organic material layer comprising the<br>
above compound may be used as a hole injection layer or<br>
hole transport layer. Additionally, the organic material <br>
layer may be used as a light emitting layer where holes<br>
and electrons are recombincd to accomplish light<br>
emission. In other words, the compound according to the<br>
present invention can perform at least one function<br>
selected from the group consisting of hole injection,<br>
hole transport and light emission. Similarly, the Jayer<br>
comprising the above compound in an organic light<br>
emitting device can serve as at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of a hole injection layer, hole<br>
transport layer and a light emitting layer.<br>
Additionally, the layer comprising the above compound<br>
can be used as a hole injection/hole transport layer,<br>
hole injection/hole transport/light emitting layer, etc.<br>
More particularly, it is thought that the compound may accept and transport holes stably and safely by virtue of the aryl group of the carbazole group or the aryl group bonded to the carbazole group as a substituent and the carbazole group itself. In addition, the substituent bonded to the carbazole group is derived from an amine group. Such substituents maintain the movement of holes and the structure of the compound according to the present invention in a stable state, while not disturbing the flow of holes. Therefore, the<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O9O5I2	PCT/KR2O05/00O794<br>
organic light emitting device comprisinq the compound shows excellent stability and improved .lifespan.<br>
In addition, the substituents of the compound according to the present invention, i.e., R1-R10 may represent any other substituents than the groups as defined above, as long as the compound having substituents corresponding to Rl-Rl0 can perform a desired function as an organic material layer in an organic light emitting device, for example, when R1-R10 represent alkyl groups or alkyl-substituted substituents, there is no limitation in the length of each alkyl group. Because the length of an alkyl group included in the compound does not affecrt the conjugation length of the compound, it has no direct effect on the wavelength of the compound or on the characteristics of a device. However, the length of an alkyl group may affect the selection of a method of applying the compound to an organic light emitting device, for example, a vacuum deposition method or a solution coating method. Therefore, there is no particular limitation in length of alkyl groups that may be included in the compound represented by the above formulae.<br>
With regard to R1-R10 in the above formulae, particular examples of the aromatic compound include monocyclic aromatic rings such as phenyl, biphenyl, terphenyl, etc., and multicyc.lic aromatic rings such as naphthyl, anthracenyl, pyrenyl, perylenyl, etc. Particular examples of the hcteroaromatic compound include thiophene, furan, pyrrole, imidazole, thiazole, oxazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, trriazole, pyridyl, pyridazyl, pyrazine, quinoline, isoquinol.ine, etc.<br>

process, a catalyst may be used. There is no particular limitation in the selection of a halogen atom. Generally, bromine, chlorine, etc. may be used.<br>
It will be appreciated that a suitable synthetic process car. be designed by one skilled in the art with reference to the structural formula of the compound according to the present invention.<br>
Synthetic processes for some compounds will be described in the following Fxamples.<br>
FIG. ] shows a preferred embodiment of the organic electroluminescence device. The organic compound according to the present invention can be used in at least one organic material layer disposed between an anode and cathode, i.e., at least one layer selected from the group consisting of a hole injection layer, hole transport layer and a light emitting layer. More particularly, the compound can be used in a hole injection layer, hole transport layer, hole injection/hole transport layer, or a hole injection/hole transport/light emitting layer.<br>
Meanwhile, it is known that a host material having a large energy gap, for example CBP, is doped with an organic phosphorescent material such as phenylpyridine iridium to provide a high-efficiency device successfully. This indicates that limited efficiency by the singlet-singlet transition may be overcome by triplet-triplet transition. Therefore, when the novel hole injection material according to the present invention is applied as a host material for phosphorescence-based luminescence, it will be possible to obtain an organic, electroluminescence device having significantly improved luminous efficiency and lifespan<br>
