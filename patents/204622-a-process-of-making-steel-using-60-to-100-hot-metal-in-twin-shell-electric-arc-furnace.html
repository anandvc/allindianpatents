     (See Section 10)<br>
"A PROCESS OF MAKING STEEL USING 60% to 100% HOT METAL IN TWIN-SHELL ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE"<br>
Ispat Industries Limited, a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its office at Casablanca, Plot No. 45, Sector-11, CBD, Belapur, Navi Mumbai-400<br>
614,MaharashtraState,India<br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
 nature of this invention and the manner in <br>
which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
This invention relates to process of making steel using 60% to 100% hot metal in twin-shell electric arc furnace.<br>
More particularly this invention relates to the steel making process using twin shell-electric arc furnace, in which feed stock comprises 60% to 100% hot metal and oxygen is blown through top lance and/or door lance and in which Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) is used as a coolant for utilizing the excess heat generated during blowing and thereby provides a cost effective and safe method of making steel.<br>
DEFINITIONS OF VARIOUS TERMS USED IN THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION<br>
ARE AS FOLLOWS:-<br>
1.	Hot Metal: This is a product from Blast Furnace technically termed as molten pig iron or Hot Metal. This is transferred from Blast Furnace to steel melt shop at an approximate temperature of 1450°C through a vessel called as Torpedo car. This is one of a raw material for steel melt shop. The composition is in the approximate range of Carbon: 4.5 -5.0%, Manganese: 0,1 -0.4%, Silicon: 0.3 -1.2%, Sulphur: 0.05% max, Phosphorus: 0.08% max. Titanium: 0.06%max. Balance will be Iron, Fe.<br>
2.	Direct Reduced Iron: This is a product from Sponge Iron Plant termed as sponge iron or DRI. Transferred to steel melt shop through conveyor system. The typical composition is: Fe (Total): 93%, SiO2: 1.9%, Carbon: 1.8 %, A12O3: 0.6 % max, Phosphorous: 0.040% max, CaO:0.5% max, MgO: 0.3 % max,.Sulphur : 0.01 % max, Other oxides 1.85%). This is used as coolant during the process.<br>
3.	Hot Heel: This is the leftover liquid steel in the furnace after tapping the heat from the furnace. Approximate Quantity of 20 -35 tons will-remain after every batch. This is a process requirement to avoid slag carry over into the ladle at the time of tapping along with steel, which affects the steel quality during refining at secondary metallurgy-stage.<br>
4.	Coke : This is a de-oxidiser which is used for the deoxidation of hot heel leftover after tapping the liquid steel. Coke reacts with the dissolved oxygen present in steel and FeO present in slag. This is perfected to avoid any violent reaction during hot metal pouring into EAF. Coke is injected through a consumable or non-consumable supersonic lance<br>
5. Lime: This is used as a flux during the process, to remove all impurities material like oxides and silicates generated. Depending on the raw material composition, quantity of lime to be added is decided. The approximate composition of lime is CaO: 90% minimum, Si02: 1.5% maximum, LOI: 3% max, MgO: 2% maximum, Al2O3: 1.5% maximum.<br><br>
6.	Dolomite: This is also used as a flux to maintain MgO in EAF Slag to reduce furnace refractory erosion. MgO is to be maintained in the range of 8 -10% in slag which is obtained from dolomite. The basic composition of Dolomite is CaO: 50-55%, MgO:30-35%, LOI:4% max, R203:3% max.<br>
7.	Liquid Steel: This is the product from furnace, which is further refined in ladle down the line. Liquid steel is super heated up to 1620°C for down stream processing. The melting point of steel is 1539°C. The liquid steel is tapped through a tap hole of 180mm diameter after the end of the heat. The typical composition by weight percent of elements are: Carbon: 0.03%, Managanese:0.15%, Sulphur:0.015%, Phosphorous: 0.010%, Si: 0.03%. However the composition varies depending on end applications.<br>
8.	Slag: Slag is a byproduct of furnace, which contains various oxide mixtures. The typical composition of slag is CaO:30-35%, Mgo:8-10%, SiO2:10-15%, FeO:20-25%, A1203: 3%. Slag being lighter in weight floats on top of metal during process. This is drained out of the furnace through slag door from time to time and constant basicity is maintained.<br>
9.	Basicity: This is a ratio of basic oxides to acidic oxide (CaO / Si02) present in slag. This ratio is maintained at 2.5 to 3.0, to remove the silicates and oxides during process.<br>
EXISTING STEEL MAKING PROCESSES/METHODS KNOWN IN THE PRIOR<br>
ART ARE AS FOLLOWS:-<br>
1.	Open hearth process: The furnace is refractory lined shallow vessel, heated by either liquid or gaseous fuels using heat regeneration principle. Charge is molten pig iron and scrap. The scrap is heated to near its melting point and molten pig iron from blast furnace is poured into it. The charge may contain iron ore and limestone. Refining is done by oxygen blowing enabling the process autogenous. This process takes a long time affecting the productivity.<br>
2.	Converter process: This furnace is having a solid refractory lined bottom with height to diameter (H/D) ratio greater than 1.5. This is a basic oxygen process using oxygen blowing from top. The scrap is used as a coolant. The energy source is from exothermic chemical reactions. The heat is generated by the carbon and oxygen reaction releasing carbon monoxide gas which is called exothermic reaction. The Direct Reduced Iron is not used in this type of furnace. There is no flexibility of charge-mix like that in Electric Arc Furnace.<br>
3.	Electric Arc Furnace Process: The energy source in this process is Electrical Energy. The advantage in this method is flexibility of using charge-mix like Direct Reduced Iron, scrap and Hot Metal. The vessel is shallow with two split shells: refractory lined bottom shell and water cooled upper shell. There are two types of Electric Arc Furnaces : AC<br><br>
type &amp; DC type. The high cost of electric energy makes'this process.costly.  Hence efforts are made to maximize hot metal in Electric Arc Furnace to reduce cost of production. In the conventional process, Direct Reduced Iron and Hot metal are mixed in the ratio of 40% and 60%.<br>
Method of operation of Conventional Process<br>
The conventipnal process is called 'ConArc' process.-The philosophy of this concept is to operate two processes i.e., 'Converter' and 'Arc' simultaneously in two alternate shells. This process uses Hot Metal upto 60% and balance Direct Reduced Iron to synchronize the twin-shell operation. When one shell is in blowing mode the other shell will be arcing mode. The furnace capacity to hold the charge is 210 ton.<br>
The sequence of operation in thexonventional process is as follows:<br>
1.	Furnace preparation: This involves tapping of previous heat, Tap hole filling, furnace repair, if necessary.<br>
2.	Killing of hot heel: This process of de-oxidation is carried out through feeding of Aluminum or Ferro Aluminium or Ferro Silicon -or Ferro Manganese from the top.<br>
3.	Charging: Hot metal charging upto 60%, through launder from the slag door. The desired quantity of hot metal supplied from Blast Furnace is poured into hot metal ladle. The entire hot metal is poured into the furnace in single pouring before blowing starts.<br>
4.	Converter process: Oxygen blowing through the top lance to blow down the Carbon, Silicon, Manganese &amp; de-phosphorisation.<br>
5.	Flushing out silicious slag through slag door<br>
6.	Roof swiveling and switchover from top lance to arcing mode<br>
7.	Arcing process: Meltdown the balance 40% Direct Reduced Iron with Electric Arc. Direct Reduced Iron is fed from the top through conveyer system in the controlled feed-rate.<br>
8.   Superheat the total melt to tapping temperature using Electric Energy 9.   Check chemistry &amp; temperature as per tapping conditions<br>
10. Tap the liquid steel to ladle retaining 15% of liquid steel called hot heel, in the furnace<br>
A typical blowing &amp; arcing profile is given in Table -A<br><br><br><br>
The typical activity chart of the conventional process is shown in Table - B hereto.<br><br>
Disadvantages of conventional Process:<br>
The basic disadvantages of this process are:<br>
1.	Hot metal can be used upto a maximum of 60% only. The furnace volume is a<br>
limitation and there is a loss of liquid metal through slag door during deslagging. This<br>
means there is a loss of liquid metal yield and hence cost of production is high.<br>
2.	Usage of Electric Energy: In this process, charge-mix is 60% hot metal and balance<br>
 40% is Direct Reduced Iron. Electric arcing is done to melt the Direct Reduced Iron in<br>
 the Arcing process. Hence this process consumes costly electrical energy increasing the<br>
 liquid steel cost.<br>
73. Improper hot heel killing leading to violent reaction and equipment damage: The -killing of hot heel is done through materials like Aluminium or Ferro Aluminium or Ferro Silicon or Ferro Manganese, which are fed from top. The top layer of hot heel being slag, these materials react partially with FeO present in slag and partially react with dissolved oxygen present in liquid steel. This results in inhomogeneous and incomplete reaction. Hence the dissolved oxygen in liquid steel and unreacted FeO present in slag react with carbon in hot metal as soon as hot metal pouring starts. This has led to violent reaction followed by explosion leading to equipment damage frequently.<br><br>
4. Usage of costlier materials for Hot heel killing: The killing was done through costlier materials like Aluminum or Ferro Aluminium or Ferro Silicon or Ferro Manganese.<br>
5.'Heavy reaction during arcing'cycle resulting in unsafe operation : After the end of blowing and before charging of Direct Reduced Iron for arcing cycle, due to soft  blowing and over-oxidation of the bath, there is a tendency of boiling. The high percentage of FeO in slag &amp; carbon in liquid steel will react when slag layer is broken during start of arcing.<br>
6.	Increased cost of production due to higher consumption of:<br>
a.	Power<br>
b.	Electrode<br>
c.	Carburiser<br>
d.	Refractory<br>
e.	De-oxidisers for hot heel killing<br>
7.	Production delays due to Electrode gantry breakdown<br>
8.	Higher maintenance cost of Electrode gantry &amp; water cooled cables:-<br>
The Improved Process :-<br>
The main object of this invention is to obviate the above mentioned drawbacks and limitations of the conventional steel making processes using electric arc furnace and to provide an improved processes/methods of making steel by using twin-shell electric arc furnace in which use of 60% to 100% hot metal is now made possible and Direct Reduced Iron is used just to utilise the excess heat generated during oxygen blowing.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process of making steel by using twin-shell electric arc furnace, wherein 100% hot metal is used as the feed stock to the electric arc furnace.<br>
A-further object of this invention is to provide a process of making steel by using twin-shell electric arc furnace, wherein the oxygen is blown through top lance and/or door  lance.<br>
 A further object of this invention is to provide a process of making steel by using twin- shell electric arc furnace, wherein killing of hot heel is done with injection of coke  through consumable door lance or side lance using compressed air as carrier gas instead  of using Aluminum or Ferro Aluminium or Ferro Silicon or Ferro Manganese from the<br>
top as in case of prior art process which is very costly in comparison to coke injection of<br>
this invention.<br><br>
of using Aluminum or Ferro Aluminium or Ferro Silicon or Ferro Manganese from the top as in case of prior art process which is very costly in comparison to coke injection of this invention.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides:<br>
A process of making steel with hot metal in twin shell electric arc furnace, characterizes charging 60 % to 100 % hot metal in said furnace which is modified by reducing the refractory safety lining thickness, reducing the thickness of Dry Hearth Ramming Mass, wherein the process steps comprises;<br>
a)	Killing of hot metal with injection of coke through consumable door lance/supersonic lance with compressed gas and/or air, which conveys coke particles into the bath through the lance<br>
b)	Charging of 140 - 220 tons of hot metal into the furnace preferably obtained from blast furnace by using the hot metal ladle and hot metal launder;<br>
c)	De-siliconisation by oxygen (99% purity) blowing through top lance at blow rate in the range 150 - 200 Nm3/min and continuously charging lime in the furnace in order to maintain basicity ratio in between 2.5-3;<br>
d)	Deslagging of silicon enriched acidic slag at the end of the above step of de-<br>
siliconisation, through the slag door of the furnace;<br>
e)	Decarburisation and dephosphorisation by oxygen (99% purity) blowing at 150 to 200 Nm3/min through toplance and charging lime continuously to maintain basicity ratio in between 2.5-3;<br>
f)	Deslagging of phosphorous enriched slag through the slag door of the furnace.;<br>
g)	Taking sample for chemical analysis &amp; slag analysis and measuring in the temperature range of 1580 °C - 1640 °C through an immersion lance with the disposable thermocouples.;<br>
h) Tapping of liquid steel into the ladle.<br>
THE VARIOUS STEPS OF A PROCESS OF MAKING STEEL USING 60% to 100% HOT METAL IN TWIN-SHELL ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE IS AS UNDER:-<br>
1. Killing of hot heel remained from previous heat: This is done with injection of coke through consumable door lance or side lance using compressed air as carrier gas. The said lance is dipped into the hot heel and the coke is injected at a flow rate of 50 Kg/min<br><br>
so as to escaping the gas produced out of the furnace and eliminating any violent reaction.In the conventional method this is done with costlier Aluminium or ferro alloys like Ferro- Silicon, Ferro Aluminium, Ferro Manganese. This was fed from the top and the reaction was inhomogeneous and incomplete, resulting in violent reaction. Moreover, the products being oxides, remain in the furnace and higher basicity had to be maintained under this condition.<br>
Hot heel killing is done in two methods:<br>
1)	The said consumable door lance used for injecting the coke for killing of hot heel is mounted on lance manipulator.<br>
2)	The injection of coke for killing of hot heel is carried out by the lance inserted through the upper shell of the furnace in order to perform hot heel killing simultaneously with the hot-metal pouring.<br>
2.	Quality of Raw material used<br>
a.	Direct Reduced Iron<br>
Fe (Total) : 93 % min<br>
Carbon   : 1.8%<br>
Si02   : 1.9% max. A1203   : 0.6% max  Phosphorous : 0.040 % max CaO   :0.5% max MgO   :-0.3%max<br>
Sulphur   : 0.010% max<br>
Miscellaneous oxides : 1.85% max<br>
b.	Hot Metal<br>
Carbon   : 5.-0 % max<br>
Manganese : 0.3 % max Silicon   : 1.0 % max Sulphur   : 0.050% max<br>
Phosphorous : 0.080 % max<br>
Iron(Fe) : 93.57% min<br>
3.	Charging of Hot Metal into the furnace: Hot metal from Blast Furnace is supplied<br>
through a vessel called Torpedo. The required quantity is poured into hot metal ladle in<br>
the pit. The hot metal from hot metal ladle is transferred to the furnace through an<br><br>
intermediate vessel called hot metal launder, in order to have a controlled pouring. Hot metal launder is preheated before pouring the hot metal.<br>
Hot metal charged into the furnace varies preferably in between 60 % to 90%. There are two methods of pouring the hot metal.<br>
1)	60 % to 90% charge of hot metal is carried out in a single charge in the beginning<br>
'itself, before blowing starts followed by single blowing.<br>
2) Charge of 60 % to 90% hot metal is split-into two, 60% of hot metal being first<br>
poured in the beginning and blown with the oxygen.and after the end of the first blowing the remaining hot metal is poured into the furnace followed by second blowing.<br>
The different methods followed at Ispat's case are given separately as Examples in point no.5.,<br>
4.	Furnace shell volume: This is a limitation of conventional process. Before adopting the inventive process, the furnace volume is increased. The lower shell of the furnace is modified to accommodate the increased hot metal quantity. The thickness of the safety lining, dry hearth ramming mass is decreased resulting in increase of furnace volume by 18.22%:<br>
5.	De-Siliconisation: Oxygen blowing through-top lance at 200 Nm3/min for de-Siliconisation. Lime to be charged continuously to maintain Basicity 2.5 - 3.0.<br>
6.	Deslagging: After the end of de-siliconisation, the silicon-enriched slag being acidic in nature is flushed out of the furnace through slag-door<br>
7. Decarburisation and dephosphorisation: Oxygen blowing is done for idecarburisation and dephosphorisation at 200 Nm3/min. Lime is charged continuously to  maintain Basicity of 2.5 - 3.0<br>
8. Addition of coolant: During the decarburisation, excess heat energy is generated. Hot  metal charge being 60% to 90% and the balance is completed by feeding Direct Reduced  Iron into the liquid pool, of the hot meal, which melts by utilizing the excess heat energy   generated during the decarburisation and thereby reduced energy cost for melting the said   Direct Reduced Iron. The hot metal in charge is with balance quantity as Direct Reduced   Iron-which is fed to the liquid pool<br>
The Direct Reduced Iron add to the quantity of liquid metal with out any energy cost for  melting and acts as a coolant to safeguard the refractory of the furnace from high - temperature to increase the life of refractory and maintaining the temperature of the<br>
Liquid metal 1590°C to 1600 °C.<br>
9.	Deslagging: Total de-slagging is done for the removal of phosphorous enriched slag.<br>
This operation is done without furnace stoppage<br>
10.	Sampling : Sample is taken for chemical analysis &amp; slag analysis during the process<br><br>
11.	Temperature measurement: The temperature is measured through an immersion lance with the disposable thermocouples during the process.<br>
12.	Tapping: After the confirmation of the tapping conditions like chemistry &amp; temperature and after the end of blowing, top lance is swung back with its roof cover to its parking position. Liquid steel is tapped into the preheated ladle. There is no usage of Electrical Energy.<br>

ADVANTAGES OF PROCESS OF MAKING STEEL USING 60% to 90% HOT METAL-IN TWIN-SHELL ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE<br>
This invention provides the use of hot metal up to 90%. Hot heel killing is done with cheaper material and with safe operation and the cost of production is reduced as described below:<br>
1. Cost reduction due to usage of cheaper coke breeze for hot heel killing:<br>
In the. patented process a new innovative method of hot heel killing through coke breeze resulted in. considerable cost reduction by replacing costlier materials like Aluminium, Ferro Silicon, Ferro Manganese or Ferro Aluminium. The cost comparison is given below:<br><br>
SI.<br>
No	Material	Unit<br>
consumption<br>
kg/tls	Unit cost Rs.	Cost/ ton Rs.	Saving Rs/tls<br>
1	Coke Breeze	2.5	3.50	8.00	163.00-8.00 = 155.00<br>
2	Aluminium	2.0	81.50	163.00	<br>
^Hence there is a cost saving of Rs. 155 per ton of liquid steel produced. The only modification done was replacement of existing oxygen lance mounted on oxygen lance manipulator with coke injector lance.<br>
2. Zero Electrical Energy consumption:<br>
In the case of 60-90% Hot Metal, arcing is not required, alternatively oxygen is used with lower cost, for blowing down insignificant elements like Carbon, Manganese, Silicon and Phosphorous. It has been established fact that with an increase.in Hot Metal Ratio (HMR) by 1%, power consumption is reduced by 6kWh per ton of liquid steel (tls) produced. Each unit (kWh) costs Rs.4.00. Hence below matrix shows the savings in Patent Process:<br><br>

3.	Melting of Direct Reduced Iron without Energy consumption:<br>
Additional benefit is that during blowing Direct Reduced Iron is used as a coolant to compensate the excessive heat generated during blowing.<br>
4.	Zero Electrode consumption:<br>
Since electrical energy is not consumed in this process hence electrode consumption is nil, resulting in cost reduction. Inventory of this material is not required.<br>
5.	Reduced Carburiser consumption:<br>
Carburiser is used to form foamy slag during arcing for melting DRI in conventional process to protect the refractory lining from radiation. This is not required in 60 - 90% Hot metal operation.<br>
6.	Saving in Refractory consumption:<br>
Refractory erosion is a big constraint in conventional process which is overcome by this new process, since arcing is not required in the inventive process, shell life is increased much more.-. Frequency of furnace repair has drastically come down, resulting in cost reduction.<br>
7.	Safe operation<br>
