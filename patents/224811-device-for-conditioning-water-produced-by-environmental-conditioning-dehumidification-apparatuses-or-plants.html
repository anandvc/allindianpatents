				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a device for conditioning water produced by environmental conditioning or dehumidification apparatuses or plants, with nearly constant and automatic operation.<br>
In many areas of the world, the problem of obtaining potable water is an extremely difficult one to solve.<br>
In addition to systems and processes for distilling and conditioning sea water and for treating and recirculating waste water, the focus has also been on the possibility of recovering, conditioning and reusing water produced by conditioning plants or environmental dehumidification plants.<br>
Background Art<br>
This problem has already been confronted by the prior are through the capture of the particles of water that constitute air humidity.<br>
For example, the US patents numbers 3,035,418; 4,255,937; 5,259,203; 5,517,829; 5,52,459; 6,029,461; 6,182,453 disclose dehumidifier apparatuses, which separate water from air and store it also for human consumption. Said dehumidifier apparatus are designed to have maximum efficiency in their water production. The cycle for treating the water produced by said apparatuses also comprises a step of sterilising said water by means a source of ultraviolet light, showed in WO 00 14464. This sterilisation system has not been found to be always effective to obtain potable water.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Also known, for instance from US patent no. 6,303,039, to treat the stagnant water produced by dehumidifiers and by conditioners to make innocuous to the environment by dissolving bactericidal substances therein. In order to be destined to nutrition and home uses, water must satisfy not only the requirement of bacteriological purity, but also chemical, physical and organoleptic requirements to be qualified as potable. Conditioning water to make it potable therefore needs two types of intervention; purification and correction. Waters such as those obtained from condensation and air dehumidification processes, are normally free of pathogenic microbes, for instance those deriving from pollution of faecal origin, as is instead the case for surface water or for water extracted from the subsoil, but, on the other hand, they are quite lacking in the mineral inorganic substances that are necessary for a proper chemical-organoleptic balance.<br>
A problem not yet confronted adequately, therefore, is that of providing a treatment for correcting such water to restore acceptable average values of their content of mineral substances, in order to obtain potability and organoleptic acceptance conditions.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to assure a purification and correction in substantially automatic and continuous fashion of water produced by dehumidifier apparatus, built prevalently, as mentioned above, to achieve high water productivity, and by air conditioning apparatuses designed mainly to create well-being situations in inhabited environments, to make it fit for human consumption.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The main aim of the invention, therefore, is to provide a treatment for correcting said water immediately after its condensation, thus making them almost immediately available for consumption, avoiding their stagnant storage in containers or open tanks with the risk that they may be polluted.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a device for conditioning water produced<br>
by environmental conditioning or dehumidification apparatuses or plants comprising a<br>
condenser (1) for transforming atmospheric humidity into water, a tank (7) collecting the water,<br>
filtering means (7), a valve (81) for the exit of potable water, a control and command unit (6),<br>
characterised in that it also comprises:<br>
a device (2) for measuring the quantity of water produced by said condenser (1) and destined to<br>
be poured into a conveyor (3);<br>
a feeder (4) for dispensing a predetermined quantity of a corrective composition of salts and<br>
minerals in proportion to a reached predefined quantity of water measured by the measuring<br>
device (2);<br>
a mixing vessel (5) receiving the water measured by the measuring device (2) coming through<br>
said conveyor (3) and said quantity of a corrective composition of salts and minerals supplied<br>
by the feeder (4); said tank (7) being placed downstream of the mixing vessel (5) to collect the<br>
water treated with said corrective compositions dosed of salts and minerals dissolved therein,<br>
and being provided with said filtering means (70), for withholding bacteria and<br>
microorganisms;<br>
said control and command unit (6) activating, when the condenser (1) is in operation, the feeder<br>
(4) for dispensing said quantity of the dosed corrective composition in proportion to the<br>
quantity of water measured by the measuring device (2) to provide, once they are dissolved in<br>
water, a correct mineral composition of the water for its qualification as potable; said unit<br>
performing monitoring and alarm functions at least over the operation of the feeder (4) and of<br>
the level of filling of the collection and filtering tank (7).<br><br>
Description of the Drawings<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention shall become more readily apparent from the detailed description that follows of a preferred embodiment, illustrated purely by way of non limiting example in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view, substantially in blocks, of a plant for producing potable water from atmospheric humidity and for its distribution, which incorporates a conditioning device according to the present invention;<br>

Figure 5 shows a diameter section of the feeder of correcting tablets of Figure 4.<br>
Description of the Illustrative Embodiment<br>
With reference to Figure 1, which shows a schematic view, substantially in blocks,<br>
of a plant for producing potable water, according to the invention, the reference number 1<br>
indicates a condenser for transforming atmospheric humidity into water, the number 2 a<br>
device for measuring the quantity of water produced by the condenser 1 and destined to be<br>
poured into a conveyor 3, the number 4 a feeder of predetermined quantities of a corrective<br>
composition of salts and minerals in pre-set proportion to the quantity of water measured<br>
by the measuring device 2, the number 5 a vessel for mixing the water arriving through the<br>
conveyor 3 with said corrective composition provided by the feeder 4, the number 6 a<br>
control and command unit that operates the feeder 4 in relation to the quantity of water<br>
measured and received through the conveyor 3, the number 7 a tank for collecting and<br>
filtering the water thus treated and the number 8 a refrigerated container for storing and<br>
distributing the potable water communicating with the collection and filtering tank 7.<br>
In the condenser 1 is schematically shown a part of any environmental<br>
dehumidification or conditioning apparatus which, as is well known, produces water by<br>
condensation from atmospheric humidity. It should be specified that, for the purposes of the<br>
invention, the condenser 1, and hence the whole potable water production plant, is destined<br>
to function in an environment that is not polluted by dangerous chemical agents, in<br>
particular noxious gases or fumes, which may lead to dissolving dangerous chemicals to be<br>
dissolved in the water, requiring more complex treatments for their plimination.<br>
The collection and filtering tank 7, according to the invention, can be constituted by<br>
the common tank for collecting the condensation water of a known home conditioner or<br>
dehumidifier apparatus, modified or replaced as described hereafter.<br>
The refrigerated container 8 for storing and distributing potable water communicating<br>
with the collection and filtering tank 7, through a pipeline 80 with valve, and possible<br>
circulation pump 81, can be a traditional office water container, provided with tap 82. To<br>
allow to fill a glass B with water, the interior of the container 8 is obviously in<br>
communication w i t h the atmosphere through a pipe 83 fitted with a common air f i l t e r 84.<br>
To make potable the water dispensed by the tap 82 and produced upstream by the<br>
condenser 1, the conditioning device of the invention is provided. The condensation water<br>
to be conditioned is received by the device 2 for the measuring the water produced by the<br>
condenser 1, measuring device which, in a preferred embodiment, is better i l l u s t r a t e d in<br>
Figures 2 and 3, which are respectively a global perspective view of the conditioning device<br>
and an exploded perspective view of the measuring device alone.<br>
Said corrective composition of salts and minerals, to be dosed iu prc-sel proportion<br>
to the quantity of water measured by the measuring device 2, comprises a complex of salts,<br>
acids and other inorganic substances which, once they are dissolved in water, are able to<br>
provide the water with the right mineral composition w i t h i n the l i m i t s and proportions<br>
established by the literature and by current standards to qualify water as potable. Said<br>
composition must, for instance, contain salts, carbonates, bicarbonatcs, acids able to confer<br>
calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, fluorine, iron etc., in organoleptically acceptable<br>
average proportions.<br>
This corrective composition can be dispensed in l i q u i d form or in soluble solid form,<br>
either in grains or tablets. It has been experimentally determined, both for reasons of<br>
s t a b i l i t y and conservation of the corrective composition and for reasons of case of supply<br>
and use, that the solid tablet form is preferable. The remainder of the description w i l l<br>
therefore refer to the dispensation of said corrective composition in the preferred form of<br>
tablets with pre-determined composition and dosage.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the measuring device underlies a known no/.xle 10 for the e x i t<br>
of the water from the condenser 1.<br>
Note that the water provided by the condenser 1 is often dispensed, in particular in<br>
small apparatuses or plants for home use, in intermittent drops or in small, non continuous<br>
threads. Said dispensing, moreover, q u a n t i t a t i v e l y depends on the conditions of<br>
environmental humidity, which are apt to vary periodically, daily and seasonally. Therefore,<br>
said measuring device according to the invention, must be such as lo be able to interccpi the<br>
condensation water in its discontinuity of dispensation and to measure it taking into account<br>
its quantitative variation over time.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, advantageously, according to the invention, the measuring<br>
device 2 is fastened to a shaped vertical wall 20 integral with the associated collection and<br>
filtering tank 7.<br>
The device 2 for measuring the water produced by the condenser 1, according to a<br>
preferred embodiment, superiorly has a swivelling semi-tubular element 21 for collecting<br>
the water. As shown in greater detail in Figure 3, the swivelling semi-tubular element 21 is<br>
open at its opposite ends and is pivotally mounted, through a pivot spindle 22, onto a frame<br>
23 provided with appropriate slots 24, 24 for housing the ends of the pivot spindle 22. The<br>
pivot spindle 22 is keyed in a prismatic block 25, appropriately shaped superiorly in order<br>
rigidly to receive the swivelling semi-tubular element 21 in such a way as lo oscillate freely<br>
in a single piece therewith.<br>
The swivelling semi-tubular clement 21, overlying the conveyor 3 of t h e produced<br>
water, is separated internally in the transverse direction by means of a baffle plate 26 i n to<br>
two opposite chambers 27, 27. The reference number 29 indicates, by way of example, a<br>
block for fastening the measuring device 2 to the vertical wall 20.<br>
The measuring device 2 overlies the conveyor 3, suspended underneath i t . The<br>
conveyor 3 is tray shaped, having a bottom 30, lateral flanks 31, 31 and front and rear walls<br>
32, 32 provided with end flaps 33, 33. The bottom 30, anteriorly and posteriorly inclined<br>
downwards by means of its wails 34, 34, is centrally provided with a hole 35 for the passage<br>
of the water arriving from the swivelling semi-tubular element 21, as shall be explained<br>
hereafter. The conveyor 3 is fastened to the shaped wait 20, for instance by means of a<br>
bracket 36.<br>
The water produced by the condenser i descends in drops through the nox/le 10 i n t o<br>
one of the two chambers 27, 27 of the swivelling semi-cylindrical element 21 of llie<br>
measuring device 2. When said chamber 27 is sufficiently full, in the volume of water<br>
defining the predetermined limit weight causing the oscillation of the swivelling semicylindrical<br>
element 21, it t i l t s the element 21 to one side and causes the water contained<br>
therein, by gravity, into the underlying conveyor 3, positioning the other one of the two<br>
chambers 27, 27 in stabie fashion underneath the nozzle 10. Each oscillation of the<br>
swivelling element 21 therefore measures a determined and certain q u a n t i t y of water<br>
produced by the condenser.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, underlying the conveyor 3 is positioned the vessel 5 for mixing<br>
the measured water arriving through the conveyor 3 and at least a tablet provided by the<br>
feeder 4 through an advancement tube 9. The tablet 5 (Figures 4 and 5) is made to arrive by<br>
gravity from the feeder 4 which is fastened, for instance, to the shaped vertical wall 20 by<br>
means of a bracket 40.<br>
With reference now to Figures 4 and 5, which are respectively a p a r t i a l l y exploded<br>
perspective view and a diameter section of the feeder 4, according to a preferred<br>
embodiment for dispensing the corrective composition in the form of tablets, of the<br>
conditioning device according to the invention. The feeder 4 of tablets P, in its preferred<br>
embodiment, comprises a container for tablets formed by an upper cylindrical wall 41,<br>
provided with a lid 42, by a lower cylindrical part 43 integrated in a body 44 and by a base<br>
45. On the base 45 is pivotatly mounted, by means of an electric motor 46 housed in a<br>
respective scat 460 passing through the base 45, a shaped dome 47. The shaped dome 47 has<br>
a convex upper surface 48 and substantially cylindrical outer lateral wall 49. The dome 47,<br>
suitably connected to the shaft of the motor 46 to rotate coaxially therewith, has such<br>
dimensions that between the outer lateral surface 49 and the inner surface of the lower<br>
cylindrical part 43 of the tablet container there is such a gap as to a l l ow only the vertical<br>
positioning of the tablets P. The dome 47 has at its base stepped projections 470 (Fig. 4),<br>
each having greater diametrical width than a tablet, separated by a p l u r a l i t y of<br>
circumferentially equidistant seats 471, each seat 471 having such dimensions as to receive<br>
a single tablet. The number of seats 471 can be four. On the base 45 of the feeder is<br>
appropriately provided a through opening 450 surmounted by an i n t e r d i c t i o n cap 451<br>
fastened from the outside to the body 44 of the tablet container. The tablet container 451<br>
prevents tablets coming from the top of the container to enter the through opening. I f one<br>
of the seats 471 is i n i t i a l l y positioned correspondingly surmounting the through opening<br>
450, at each 90° rotation a successive seat 471 is positioned in correspondence with the<br>
through opening 450. The through opening 450 is in communication through the<br>
advancement tube 9, supported by means of an attachment neck 90, with said mixing vessel<br>
5 of the water measured by the measuring device 2 with the tablet P.<br>
The mixing vessel 5 has a centrally concave bottom, inferiorly holed with a hole of<br>
smaller size than the diameter of the tablet P, so that it cannot pass through it before Slaving<br>
been gradually dissolved by the water poured thereon by the measuring device 2. The<br>
operation, already fairly apparent in itself, shall be described in detail hereafter.<br>
The control and command u n i t 6 (Figure 1) operates through an electrical connection<br>
line 60 the tablet feeder 4 in proportion and upon reaching the predetermined q u a n t i t y of<br>
water measured and received through the conveyor 3, through an electrical connecting line<br>
61 which allows to'count the oscillation of the swivelling clement 21 on ihc pivoting spindle<br>
22 of the measuring device 2.<br>
For example, once the number of oscillations of the swivelling clement 21<br>
corresponding to the pouring of two litres of condensation water into the collection and<br>
filtering tank 7 is counted, the fall is allowed ofone tablet, of corrective composition, dosed<br>
and proportioned to the two litres of water, which is gradually dissolved by the additional<br>
water dispensed in the conveyor 3.<br>
The command unit 6, in addition to checking, providing alarm signals, for the<br>
presence of tablets in the container of the feeder 4 and any jamming thereof, may provide,<br>
through a line 62, for the operation a possible device 63 for agitating the conditioned water<br>
inside the collection and filtering tank 7. Said agitator device 63 serves the function of<br>
mixing and homogenising the water contained in the tank corrected with the periodic<br>
dissolution of the tablet P. The command unit 6 can also provide for the continuous<br>
measuring of the water level in the collection and f i l t e r i ng tank 7, schematically i l l u s t r a t e d<br>
through a connecting line 64.<br>
Moreover, according to the invention, the collection and filtering tank 7 is internally<br>
provided with means 70 for filtering the water as treated above, schematically i l l u s t r a t e d<br>
with two immersed cylindrical bodies 71, in communication with and upstream of the valve<br>
81 for the exit of potable water. Said filters, known in themselves, are sterilisation filters,<br>
for instance preferably with granular f i l l i ng of ceramic material or kicselgur, with such<br>
porosity as to withhold the any micro-organisms and bacteria present in the water and,<br>
obviously, any other suspensions or corpuscles present in the water, which may derive from<br>
the condenser 1.<br>
Advantageously, when necessary, for a greater certainty of reaching the prescribed<br>
condition of bacteriological purity of the condensation water, said corrective composition,<br>
also in its solid tablet form, can be formulated to comprise also common bactcricide<br>
substances.<br>
The operation of the conditioning device according to the invention therefore is as<br>
follows. Once the count number corresponding to a determined flow rate of water is<br>
reached, the command unit 6 activates the feeder 4 of corrective composition, possibly in<br>
the form of tablets P, causing the dome 47 to rotate. In this way a tablet positioned in a scat<br>
471 is brought in correspondence with the through opening 450 obtained at the base 45 of<br>
the tablet container. The tablet P is made to advance by gravity through the advancement<br>
tube 9 to reach the mixing vessel 5 where it is dissolved by the water coming from the<br>
conveyor 3. The solution of condensation water enriched by the minerals dissolved from the<br>
tablet falls into the collection and filtering tank 7 wherefrom it exits, passing the filtering<br>
means 70, to feed a preferably refrigerated storage and d i s t r i b u t i o n container 8.<br>
In this way, a nearly continuous automatic conditioning is assured during the operation<br>
of the condenser 1, with perfect treatment in terms of bacteriological purification and<br>
correction of the chemical content and of the organoleptic characteristics, of the water<br>
obtained by condensation by an environmental dehumidification or conditioning apparatus.<br>
Naturally, the invention as conceived can be subject to numerous modifications and<br>
variations, without thereby departing from the scope of the same inventive concept that<br>
