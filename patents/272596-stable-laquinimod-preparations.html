D. HDPE 30 mL containers (manufactured by Quality Container, Ypsilanti, MI. Item No. W.0030B33400WH09T) sealed with child-resistant caps (33mm) (33mm Saf-Cap IH-A with pulp and polyex primary liner, and secondary liner PS-22 0.002" Eva Wax Type Pressure Sensitive Adhesive Coated on a <br><br>
0.020 Tekni-Foam Printed "SFYP", manufactured by Van Blarcom, Closures, Inc. Brooklyn, NY . )<br><br>
Containers A, C and D The moisture permeability of the containers A, C and D was measured according to United States Pharmacopoeia, 29th edition, U.S. Pharmacopoeia  (Multiple-unit containers for capsules and tablets) as follows:<br><br>
Desiccant Preparation: A quantity of 4- to 8-mesh, anhydrous calcium chloride was placed in a shallow container, taking care to exclude any fine powder, then dried at 1100C for 1 hour, and cooled in a desiccator.<br><br>
Procedure: 12 containers of a uniform size and type were selected, the sealing surfaces were cleaned with a lint- free cloth, and each container was closed and opened 30 times. The closure was applied firmly and uniformly each time the container was closed. Screw-capped containers were closed with a torque that was within the range of tightness specified in Table 3. Desiccant was added to 10 of the containers, designated Test Containers, filling each to within 13 mm of the closure. Each was closed immediately after adding desiccant, applying the torque designated in Table 3 when closing screw-capped containers. To each of the remaining 2 containers, designated Controls, add a sufficient number of glass beads to attain a weight approximately equal to that of each of the Test Containers, and close, applying the torque designated in Table 3 when closing screw-capped containers . The weight of the individual containers so prepared was recorded to the nearest mg; and stored at 75° ± 3% relative humidity and a temperature of 23°C ± 2°C. After 336 ± 1 hours (14 days) , the weight of the individual containers was recorded in the same manner. 5 empty containers of the same size and type as the containers under test were completely filled with water or <br><br>
a noncorapressible, free-flowing solid such as well -tamped fine glass beads, to the level indicated by the closure surface when in. place. The contents of each were transferred to a graduated cylinder, and the average container volume was determined, in mL. The rate of moisture permeability, in mg per day per liter, was calculated by the formula:<br><br>
(1000 / 14V)[(TF -Tl)-(CF - CI)]<br><br>
in which V was the volume, in mL, of the container, (TF - TI) was the difference, in mg, between the final and initial weights of each test container, and (CP - CI) was the difference, in mg, between the average final and average initial weights of the 2 controls. As containers used for drugs being dispensed on prescription, the containers so tested were tight containers as not more than one of the 10 test containers exceeded 100 mg per day per liter in moisture permeability, and none exceeded 200 mg per day per liter. <br><br><br>
Table 3<br><br><br>
1 e torque es gnated for t e nex arger c osure ameter was to e applied, in testing containers having a closure diameter intermediate to the diameters listed.<br><br>
2 The torque values refer to application, not removal, of the closure.<br><br>
Container B<br><br>
The moisture permeability of the container B was measured according to United States Pharmacopoeia, 29 edition, U.S. Pharmacopoeia  Method II (Single-unit containers and unit-dose containers for capsules and tablets) as follows:<br><br>
Desiccant Preparation: Suitable desiccant pellets were dried at 1100C for 1 hour prior to use. Pellets weighing approximately 400 mg each and having a diameter of approximately 8 mm were used. <br><br>
Procedure: A sufficient number of packs were sealed, such that not fewer than 4 packs and a total of not fewer than 10 unit-dose containers or blisters filled with 1 pellet in each unit are tested. A corresponding number of empty- packs were sealed, each pack containing the same number of unit-dose containers or blisters as used in the test packs, to provide the controls. All of the containers were stored at 75% ± 3% relative humidity and at a temperature of 230C ± 20C. After 24 hours, and at each multiple thereof, the packs from the chamber were removed, and allowed to equilibrate for about 45 minutes. The weights of the individual packs were recorded, and returned to the chamber. The control packs were weighed as a unit, and the total weight was divided by the number of control packs to obtain the average empty pack weight. The average rate of moisture permeation was calculated, in mg per day, for each unit-dose container or blister in each pack taken by the formula: (1 /NX)KWF - WI) -(CF -CI)]<br><br>
in which N was the number of days expired in the test period (beginning after the initial 24 -hour equilibration period) ; X was the number of separately sealed units per pack; (WF-WI) was the difference, in mg, between the final and initial weights of each test pack,- and (CF-CI) was the difference, in mg, between the average final and average initial weights of the control packs, the rates being calculated to two significant figures.<br><br>
Results<br><br>
The following were the results for the permeability testing of each container. The R value (rate of moisture permeability) for each container is expressed in Table 4 in terms of mg/L/day. <br><br>
Table 4<br><br><br>
The arithmetic mean value of moisture permeability for 10 containers of type A, C and D in mg/L/day was determined to be 11.4, 0.351 and 28.7, respectively.<br><br>
The packaging type B was tested according to USP  Method II. No pack tested exceeded 0.5 mg moisture permeability per day, and was thus classified as Class A according to USP  Method II.<br><br>
Example 3b; Appearance of Laquinimod Sodium Capsules in Various Packaging<br><br>
Laquinimod sodium capsules (0.3 mg of LA/capsule) prepared according to Examples 1 and 2 were packaged in packaging types A (35 capsules per package) , B (7 capsules, each individually sealed, per blister package) , C (35 capsules per package) and D (40 capsules per package) as described in Example 3a.<br><br>
The sealed packages were stored at 400C at 75% relative humidity.<br><br>
1-2 packages were opened per time point for packages A, C, <br><br>
and D. 5 blister packages (35 capsules) were opened per time point for package B. Only sealed packages were evaluated at each time point.<br><br>
The appearance of all of the capsules at time zero was normal . The appearance of the capsules at various time points is listed in Table 5:<br><br>
Table 5<br><br><br>
These results indicate that packaging D was unacceptable for storing the capsules of Examples 1 and 2.<br><br>
Example 3c: Stability of Laquinimod Sodium Capsules in Various Packaging<br><br>
Capsules (0.3 mg of LA/capsule) from Examples 1 and 2 were packaged in packaging of types A, B and C:<br><br>
The sealed packages were stored at 400C at 75% relative humidity.<br><br>
1-2 packages were opened per time point for packages A, C, and D. 5 blister packages (35 capsules) were opened per time point for package B. Only sealed packages were evaluated at each time point.<br><br>
At certain time points, a peak identified to be fumaric acid was observed in chromatographic analysis of some of the capsules. The fumaric acid was present in the formulation as a result of the degradation of sodium <br><br>
stearyl fumarate . The percent degradation of sodium stearyl fumarate was calculated based on the amount of fumaric acid present . The percent degradation of sodium stearyl fumarate (w/w, degraded sodium stearyl fumarate/starting sodium stearyl fumarate) is listed in Table 6.<br><br>
Table 6<br><br><br>
Example 4 : Forced Degradation of Laquinimod Sodium Capsules Laquinimod sodium capsules manufactured according to Examples 1 and 2 were exposed to 0.15% H2O2 solution for 40 minutes.<br><br>
The amount of sodium laquinimod in each capsule after exposure was measured using a chromatographic assay, and the percent decrease is listed below:<br><br>
Formulation of Example 1: 28.5% decrease. Formulation of Example 2: 0.7% decrease.<br><br>
Results<br><br>
The use of meglumine as an excipient in sodium laquinimod prevented oxidation-related degradation of laquinimod sodium under forced conditions . <br><br>

The use of meglumine in the formulations of Example 2 inhibits the degradation of sodium stearyl fumarate at 400C and 75% relative humidity such that 10% or less degradation occurs after 3 months as compared to analogous formulations without meglumine. This indicates that the use of meglumine in laquinimod sodium formulations increases stability.<br><br>
Furthermore, the use of meglumine reduces the degradation of the laquinimod sodium in a formulation. Specifically, when exposed to 0.15% H2O2 solution for 40 minutes the formulation with meglumine of Example 2 exhibited less than 2.5% of laquinimod sodium degradation as compared to an analogous formulation without meglumine under the same conditions .<br><br>
In addition, as seen from the results after 3 months, packaging laquinimod sodium compositions in the presence of a desiccant such as silica gel increases stability of the formulations. Specifically, the presence of a desiccant in the packaging results in 20% or less (in some cases 0.5%) degradation of sodium stearyl fumarate occurring as compared to packaging without desiccant under the same conditions and time interval.<br><br>
WO 2005/074899 discloses that laquinimod is susceptible to chemical degradation in solid state. Accordingly, WO 2005/074899 teaches a method of preparing laquinimod sodium for pharmaceutical use by dissolving laquinimod base in the neutral form in a solution of an alkaline reacting component such as sodium carbonate, thus producing laquinimod sodium. The manufacturing processes disclosed in WO 2005/074899 all keep laquinimod base in contact with water.<br><br>
The disclosure of WO 2005/074899 thus indicates that there is no problem when laquinimod is in contact with water. <br><br>
Therefore, when addressing the question of packaging laquinimod, it would appear irrelevant whether a package for laquinimod is permeable to moisture. Herein, however, it has been shown that solid laquinimod formulations are indeed sensitive to moisture and degrade more rapidly in the presence of moisture. To solve this newly recognized problem, the subject invention provides that laquinimod should be packaged in a package with low moisture permeability. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
