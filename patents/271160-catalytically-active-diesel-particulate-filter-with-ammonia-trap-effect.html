				<td>Catalytically active diesel particulate filter with<br>
ammonia trap effect<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a catalytically active diesel<br>
particulate filter which, in addition to the properties<br>
typical of a diesel particulate filter, has an ammonia<br>
blocking function. The invention further relates to<br>
exhaust gas aftertreatment systems for removal of<br>
nitrogen oxides and particulates from the exhaust gas<br>
of internal combustion engines operated under<br>
predominantly lean conditions using the inventive<br>
catalytically active diesel particulate filter in<br>
different embidoments.<br>
The emissions present in the exhaust gas of a motor<br>
vehicle can be divided into two groups. Thus, the term<br>
"primary emission" refers to pollutant gases which form<br>
directly through the combustion process of the fuel in<br>
the engine and are already present in the untreated<br>
emission before it passes through emission control<br>
units. Secondary emission refers to those pollutant<br>
gases which can form as by-products in the emission<br>
control system.<br>
The exhaust gas of lean engines comprises, as well as<br>
the customary primary emissions of carbon monoxide CO,<br>
hydrocarbons HC and nitrogen oxides NOX, a relatively<br>
high oxygen content of up to 15% by volume. In the case<br>
of diesel engines, there is additional particulate<br>
emission as well as the gaseous primary emissions,<br>
which consists predominantly of soot residues, with or<br>
without organic agglomerates, and originates from<br>
partially incomplete fuel combustion in the cylinder.<br>
Especially in the case of diesel vehicles, complying<br>
with the emissions limits stipulated by the future<br><br>
emissions legislation in Europe, North America and<br>
Japan requires not only nitrogen oxide removal from the<br>
exhaust gas ("denitrification") but also the cleaning<br>
thereof to remove particulates. The carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrocarbon pollutant gases from the lean exhaust gas<br>
can easily be rendered harmless by oxidation over a<br>
suitable oxidation catalyst. The reduction of the<br>
nitrogen oxides to nitrogen is much more difficult<br>
owing to the high oxygen content. For the removal of<br>
the particulate emissions, the use of specific diesel<br>
particulate filters is unavoidable.<br>
Known methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust<br>
gases are firstly methods using nitrogen oxide storage<br>
catalysts (NSCs) and secondly methods for selective<br>
catalytic reduction (SCR) by means of ammonia over a<br>
suitable catalyst, SCR catalyst for short.<br>
The cleaning action of nitrogen oxide storage catalysts<br>
is based on the nitrogen oxides being stored in a lean<br>
operating phase of the engine by the storage material<br>
of the storage catalyst, predominantly in the form of<br>
nitrates. When the storage capacity of the NSC is<br>
exhausted, the catalyst has to be regenerated in a<br>
subsequent rich operating phase of the engine. This<br>
means that the nitrates formed beforehand are decom-<br>
posed and the nitrogen oxides released again are<br>
reacted with the reducing exhaust gas components over<br>
the storage catalyst to give nitrogen, carbon dioxide<br>
and water. The operation of nitrogen oxide storage<br>
catalysts is described in detail in the SAE document<br>
SAE 950809.<br>
Since the implementation of a rich operating phase in<br>
diesel engines is not straightforward and the<br>
establishment of the rich exhaust gas conditions<br>
required for regeneration of the NSC frequently entails<br>
auxiliary measures such as fuel postinjection into the<br><br>
exhaust gas line, the SCR method is used preferentially<br>
for denitrification of diesel motor vehicle exhaust<br>
gases.<br>
In this method, according to the engine design and<br>
construction of the exhaust gas system, a distinction<br>
is made between "active" and "passive" SCR methods,<br>
"passive" SCR methods involving use of ammonia second-<br>
ary emissions generated deliberately in the exhaust gas<br>
system as a reducing agent for denitrification.<br>
For example, US 6,345,496 B1 describes a method for<br>
cleaning engine exhaust gases, in which repeatedly<br>
alternating lean and rich air/fuel mixtures are estab-<br>
lished and the exhaust gas thus produced is passed<br>
through an exhaust gas system which comprises, on the<br>
inflow side, a catalyst which converts NOX to NH3 only<br>
under rich exhaust gas conditions, while a further<br>
catalyst arranged on the outflow side adsorbs or stores<br>
NOX in the lean exhaust gas, and releases it under rich<br>
conditions, such that it can react with NH3 generated<br>
by the inflow-side catalyst to give nitrogen. As an<br>
alternative, according to US 6,345,496 Bl, an NH3<br>
adsorption and oxidation catalyst may be arranged on<br>
the outflow side, which stores NH3 under rich condi-<br>
tions, desorbs it under lean conditions and oxidizes it<br>
with oxygen to give nitrogen and water. Further disclo-<br>
sures of such methods are known.<br>
Like the use of the nitrogen oxide storage catalysts,<br>
such "passive" SCR methods have the disadvantage that<br>
one of their essential constituents is the provision of<br>
rich exhaust gas conditions, which are generally<br>
required for in situ generation of ammonia as a reduc-<br>
ing agent.<br>
Compared to this, in "active" SCR methods, the reducing<br>
agent is metered into the exhaust gas line from an<br><br>
addition tank carried in the vehicle by means of an<br>
injection nozzle. Such a reducing agent used may, apart<br>
from ammonia, also be a compound readily decomposable<br>
to ammonia, for example urea or ammonium carbamate.<br>
Ammonia has to be supplied to the exhaust gas at least<br>
in a stoichiometric ratio relative to the nitrogen<br>
oxides. Owing to the greatly varying operation condi-<br>
tions of the motor vehicles, the exact metered addition<br>
of the ammonia presents great difficulties. This leads<br>
in some cases to considerable ammonia breakthroughs<br>
downstream of the SCR catalyst. To prevent secondary<br>
ammonia emission, an oxidation catalyst is usually<br>
arranged downstream of the SCR catalyst, which is<br>
intended to oxidize ammonia which breaks through to<br>
nitrogen. Such a catalyst is referred to hereinafter as<br>
an ammonia slip catalyst.<br>
Ammonia slip catalysts which are arranged downstream of<br>
an SCR catalyst for oxidation of ammonia which breaks<br>
through are known in various embodiments. For instance,<br>
DE 3929297 C2 (US 5120695) describes such a catalyst<br>
arrangement. Accordingly, the oxidation catalyst is<br>
applied as a coating to an outflow-side section of the<br>
reduction catalyst configured in one-piece form as a<br>
solid extrudate in honeycomb form, the region coated<br>
with the oxidation catalyst making up 20 to 50% of the<br>
overall catalyst volume. The oxidation catalyst<br>
comprises, as catalytically active components, at least<br>
one of the platinum group metals, platinum, palladium<br>
and rhodium, which are deposited on cerium oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide and aluminum oxide as support<br>
materials.<br>
According to EP 1 399 246 B1, the platinum group metals<br>
can also be applied directly to the components of the<br>
reduction catalyst as support materials by impregnation<br>
with soluble precursors of the platinum group metals.<br><br>
According to JP 2005-238199, the precious metal-<br>
containing layer of an ammonia oxidation catalyst can<br>
also be introduced below a coating of titanium oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide, silicon oxide or aluminum oxide and a<br>
transition metal or a rare earth metal.<br>
To remove particulate emissions from the exhaust gas of<br>
diesel motor vehicles, specific diesel particulate<br>
filters are used, which may be provided with an oxida-<br>
tion catalyst-containing coating to improve their<br>
properties. Such a coating serves, as described in<br>
detail in SAE publication SAE 2005-01-1756, to lower<br>
the activation energy for oxygen-based particulate<br>
burnoff (soot combustion) and hence to lower the soot<br>
ignition temperature on the filter, to improve the<br>
passive regeneration performance by oxidation of<br>
nitrogen monoxide present in the exhaust gas to<br>
nitrogen dioxide, and to suppress breakthroughs of<br>
hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.<br>
A particular problem in the coating of filter<br>
substrates is that of the increase in the exhaust gas<br>
backpressure as a result of the coating applied. The<br>
exhaust gas backpressure already increases continuously<br>
as a result of the soot deposits on the filter during<br>
operation and thus reduces the performance of the<br>
engine. The filter therefore has to be regenerated from<br>
time to time by burning off the soot. When the filter<br>
is a coated filter substrate, the soot burnoff is<br>
generally facilitated, but the exhaust gas backpressure<br>
of the coated filter without deposits is often already<br>
higher than that of an uncoated filter. It is therefore<br>
not immediately possible to alter the catalytic<br>
functionality of a particulate filter by alterations to<br>
the coating, for example by introducing additionally<br>
catalytically active components.<br>
If compliance with legal emissions standards requires<br><br>
both denitrification and removal of particulates from<br>
the exhaust gas of diesel motor vehicles, the described<br>
measures for removing individual pollutant gases are<br>
combined in a corresponding conventional exhaust gas<br>
system by connection in series. For example, WO<br>
99/39809 describes an exhaust aftertreatment system<br>
wherein an oxidation catalyst for oxidation of NO in<br>
NOx to NO2, a particulate filter, a metering unit for a<br>
reducing agent and an SCR catalyst follow on each<br>
other. To prevent ammonia breakthroughs, an additional<br>
ammonia slip catalyst is generally required downstream<br>
of the SCR catalyst, and continues the series of<br>
catalysts on the outflow side of the SCR catalyst.<br>
DE 20 2005 008 146 U1 discloses an exhaust gas system<br>
for a motor vehicle, comprising at least one regenerat-<br>
able particulate filter and an SCR catalyst with<br>
ammonia storage capacity connected downstream of the<br>
particulate filter, wherein the downstream SCR cata-<br>
lyst, according to the information in this document,<br>
serves to scavenge especially the NH3 peaks which occur<br>
during the regeneration of the particulate filter in<br>
the exhaust gas, which is why the SCR catalyst is<br>
connected downstream of the particulate filter.<br>
Such conventional systems are expensive owing to the<br>
multitude of catalysts required. The series connection<br>
of the catalysts additionally leads to a high demand<br>
for installation space in the exhaust gas system. Their<br>
accommodation is often found to be difficult especially<br>
in smaller vehicles. Furthermore, the series connection<br>
of catalysts, each of which exerts its own backpressure<br>
on the exhaust gas to be cleaned, leads to unfavorable<br>
values of the exhaust gas backpressure over the entire<br>
exhaust gas system and thus reduces the performance of<br>
the engine.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the system described in DE<br><br>
20 2005 008 146 U1, the particulate filter and the SCR<br>
catalyst form a common, combined unit with a common<br>
insert body, which is typically a monolithic ceramic<br>
substrate. The SCR catalyst is formed here only by a<br>
corresponding coating of the ceramic substrate on the<br>
outflow side.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, by improving<br>
existing particulate filter technologies, to provide<br>
devices whose use allows exhaust gas aftertreatment<br>
systems for simultaneous denitrification and removal of<br>
particulates from the exhaust gas of lean engines to be<br>
simplified while dispensing with exhaust gas cleaning<br>
units. It is likewise an object of the present<br>
invention to make a contribution to the minimization of<br>
the exhaust gas backpressure of such systems and at the<br>
same time to show potential for cost saving.<br>
This object is achieved by a catalytically active<br>
diesel particulate filter which comprises a filter body<br>
and an oxidation-active catalytic coating and a further<br>
coating which is catalytically active in the SCR<br>
reaction. The coating which is catalytically active in<br>
the SCR reaction is featured in that an ammonia storage<br>
material is present therein. The diesel particulate<br>
filter is characterized in that an arrangement of the<br>
layers is maintained such that the exhaust gas to be<br>
cleaned primarily passes through the coating which is<br>
catalytically active in the SCR reaction and<br>
subsequently through the oxidation-active catalytic<br>
coating.<br>
The object is further achieved by an exhaust gas<br>
aftertreatment system for removing nitrogen oxides and<br>
particulates from the exhaust gas of internal<br>
combustion engines operated under predominantly lean<br>
conditions, which, in addition to a catalyst suitable<br>
for removing nitrogen oxides, comprises an inventive<br><br>
catalytically active diesel particulate filter.<br>
By virtue of the combination of the oxidation-active<br>
coating which may already be present in conventional<br>
particulate filters with a coating which is catalyti-<br>
cally active in the SCR reaction ("SCR coating"; "SCR-<br>
active layer"), the diesel particulate filter comprises<br>
an additional ammonia blocking function. The<br>
combination of the coatings enables the particulate<br>
filter, in addition to the functions already present<br>
(particulate filtering/particulate burnoff with lowered<br>
soot ignition temperature; improved passive regene-<br>
ration performance, NO oxidation, suppression of<br>
breakthroughs of CO and HC emissions), firstly to<br>
reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and secondly to<br>
oxidize ammonia to nitrogen. When the exhaust gas to be<br>
cleaned primarily passes through the SCR-active layer<br>
and subsequently the oxidation-active coating, the<br>
multifunctionality with regard to the conversion of the<br>
nitrogen-containing pollutant gases is thought to be<br>
based on the following reaction profile shown<br>
schematically in figure 1:<br>
1)	Nitrogen oxides and ammonia from the exhaust gas<br>
are absorbed on the SCR-active layer (1) and react<br>
in a selective catalytic reaction to give water<br>
and nitrogen, which desorb on completion of<br>
reaction. Ammonia is present in a<br>
superstoichiometric amount, i.e. is present in<br>
excess.<br>
2)	Excess ammonia diffuses into the SCR-active layer<br>
(1). Some of the ammonia is stored there.<br>
3)	Unstored ammonia passes through the SCR-active<br>
layer (1) to the oxidation-active coating (2).<br>
Nitrogen and nitrogen oxides are generated here.<br>
The nitrogen formed diffuses unchanged through the<br><br>
SCR-active layer (1) and passes into the atmos-<br>
phere .<br>
4) Before the nitrogen oxides formed in the<br>
oxidation-active layer (2) leave the system, they<br>
again pass through the SCR-active coating (1).<br>
They are reacted here with ammonia stored before-<br>
hand NH3_stored in an SCR reaction to give N2.<br>
In order that the reaction profile described leads to<br>
maximum conversions of the nitrogen-containing pollu-<br>
tant gases, it is advantageous when the SCR-active<br>
coating possesses sufficient ammonia storage capacity.<br>
In order to ensure this, the SCR-active layer in the<br>
inventive diesel particulate filter comprises an<br>
ammonia storage material. In the context of this<br>
document, ammonia storage materials are compounds which<br>
contain acidic sites at which ammonia can be bound. The<br>
person skilled in the art distinguishes these into<br>
Lewis-acidic sites for physisorption of ammonia and<br>
Br0nsted-acidic sites for chemisorption of ammonia. An<br>
ammonia storage material in an inventive diesel<br>
particulate filter must contain a significant<br>
proportion of Br0nsted-acidic sites, with or without<br>
Lewis-acidic sites, in order to ensure sufficient<br>
ammonia storage capacity.<br>
How high the ammonia storage capacity of a catalytic<br>
material is can be determined with the aid of<br>
temperature-programmed desorption. In this standard<br>
method for characterizing heterogeneous catalysts, the<br>
material to be characterized, after baking out any<br>
adsorbed components, for example water, is laden with a<br>
defined amount of ammonia gas. This is done at room<br>
temperature. The sample is then heated under inert gas<br>
at a constant heating rate, such that ammonia gas<br>
absorbed beforehand by the sample is desorbed and can<br>
be detected quantitatively with a suitable analysis<br><br>
system. As a parameter for the ammonia storage capacity<br>
of the material, an amount of ammonia in milliliters<br>
per gram of catalyst material is obtained, the term<br>
"catalyst material" always referring to the material<br>
used for characterization. This parameter is dependent<br>
on the selected heating rate. Values reported in this<br>
document are always based on measurements with a<br>
heating rate of 4 Kelvin per minute.<br>
The ammonia storage capacity of the coating which is<br>
catalytically active in the SCR reaction in the inven-<br>
tive diesel particulate filter is preferably at least<br>
20 milliliters of ammonia per gram of catalyst<br>
material, more preferably up to 70 milliliters per gram<br>
of catalyst material. Particularly suitable SCR-active<br>
layers are those having an ammonia storage capacity of<br>
25 to 40 milliliters of ammonia per gram of catalyst<br>
material.<br>
SCR-active coatings with the ammonia storage properties<br>
described preferably comprise zeolites which can be<br>
exchanged with hydrogen cations ("H zeolites") or<br>
transition metal cations. Very suitable are with iron<br>
or copper or iron and copper exchanged zeolites, which<br>
are preferably beta-zeolite or Y-zeolite or faujasite<br>
or mordenite or ZSM-5 or combinations thereof.<br>
In particularly suitable configurations of the inven-<br>
tion, the SCR-active coating in the inventive diesel<br>
particulate filter is free of precious metals. This<br>
ensures that the selectivity in the SCR reaction is as<br>
high as possible. To further improve the SCR activity,<br>
it is also possible for additives selected from the<br>
group consisting of cerium oxide, titanium oxide,<br>
zirconium oxide, vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide,<br>
tungsten oxide, silicon dioxide, and mixtures and/or<br>
mixed oxides thereof, to be present.<br><br>
Many conventional diesel particulate filters comprise<br>
an oxidation-active coating. In the inventive diesel<br>
particulate filter, this is preferably free of<br>
zeolites. In particularly suitable configurations of<br>
the invention, the oxidation-active catalytic coating<br>
comprises platinum or palladium or mixtures thereof on<br>
a support material selected from the group consisting<br>
of high-surface area active aluminum oxide, cerium<br>
oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, silicon oxide<br>
and mixtures or mixed oxides thereof.<br>
The oxidation-active catalytic coating and the coating<br>
which is catalytically active in the SCR reaction are<br>
applied in a defined manner to a filter body suitable<br>
for deposition of diesel particulates. Suitable filter<br>
bodies are selected from the group of the ceramic wall<br>
flow filter substrates, the sintered metal filter<br>
bodies or the ceramic or metallic foam structures.<br>
Preference is given to using ceramic wall flow filter<br>
substrates which have walls with an open-pore structure<br>
with a porosity of 40 to 80% and a mean pore diameter<br>
of 9 to 30 micrometers. Particular preference is given<br>
to using ceramic wall flow filter substrates with a<br>
porosity of 45 to 65% and a mean pore diameter of 9 to<br>
22 micrometers.<br>
When the coatings are applied to the filter body, it<br>
should firstly be ensured that the arrangement of the<br>
layers required for the reaction mechanism described is<br>
complied with, such that the exhaust gas to be cleaned<br>
primarily passes through the coating which is<br>
catalytically active in the SCR reaction and<br>
subsequently through the oxidation-active catalytic<br>
coating. In addition, it must be possible for the<br>
exhaust gas to diffuse back from the oxidation-active<br>
coating through the SCR-active coating into the gas<br>
space. On the other hand, it should be ensured that the<br>
backpressure properties of the resulting catalytically<br><br>
activated diesel particulate filter are not signi-<br>
ficantly worsened. This sum cf requirements constitutes<br>
a challenge in the production of the inventive<br>
catalytically active diesel particulate filter.<br>
Regardless of the type of the filter body used, the<br>
oxidation-active catalytic coating (2) is first applied<br>
to the filter body (3) which serves as the support<br>
body, and occupies the entire length of the device. The<br>
resulting filter with a coating for oxidation catalysis<br>
then constitutes the support body for the coating (1)<br>
which is catalytically active in the SCR reaction. The<br>
SCR-active coating is thus applied to the oxidation-<br>
active coating. In the preferred embodiment, the SCR-<br>
active coating occupies only part of the length of the<br>
device and is arranged on the inflow side, as shown in<br>
figure 2. The flow direction of the exhaust gas is<br>
indicated with an arrow. By virtue of this arrangement,<br>
the exhaust gas to be cleaned, in accordance with the<br>
requirements from the assumed reaction mechanism, first<br>
comes into contact with the SCR-active coating, before<br>
it can be converted over the oxidation-active coating.<br>
Diffusion of the exhaust gas back through the SCR-<br>
active coating into the gas space, for which close<br>
contact of the two layers is a prerequisite, is also<br>
ensured. Furthermore, the reduction of the SCR-active<br>
coating to part of the component length<br>
a)	ensures the minimization of the backpressure of<br>
the device and<br>
b)	ensures that the properties advantageous for a<br>
catalytically coated diesel particulate filter,<br>
such as particulate burnoff at lowered soot<br>
ignition temperature, improved passive regene-<br>
ration performance and suppression of break-<br>
throughs of CO and HC emissions, are main-<br>
tained.<br><br>
The question as to what proportion of the length of the<br>
device the SCR-active coating should occupy depends on<br>
the flow rate of the exhaust gas to be cleaned and the<br>
concentration of the nitrogen-containing pollutant<br>
gases present therein. It should be such that ammonia<br>
breakthroughs which occur can be converted fully to<br>
nitrogen. The catalytic coating which is active in the<br>
SCR reaction preferably occupies 5 to 50% of the length<br>
of the device, more preferably 10 to 30%.<br>
In the preferred configurations of the invention, a<br>
wall flow filter substrate is used. To minimize the<br>
backpressure of the inventive catalytically active<br>
diesel particulate filter, the oxidation-active cata-<br>
lytic coating is introduced into the pores of the walls<br>
of the ceramic wall flow filter substrate over the<br>
entire length of the component, such that it is distri-<br>
buted homogeneously in the particular wall of the wall<br>
flow filter substrate. How this coating should be<br>
performed is described, for example, in DE 10 2004 040<br>
548 A1 to this applicant.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show particularly preferred coating<br>
arrangements in catalytically activated wall flow<br>
filter substrates as sections of the structure with in<br>
each case an inflow channel (4) and an outflow channel<br>
(5). The flow direction of the exhaust gas is indicated<br>
by arrows. The inflow and outflow channels are<br>
separated from one another by a wall (3a) with open-<br>
pore structure which is pervious to the exhaust gas,<br>
and sealed, respectively, from the outflow and inflow<br>
side by a gas-tight channel end (3b).<br>
The embodiment of the inventive catalytically active<br>
diesel particulate filter shown in figure 3 is prefer-<br>
ably selected when a conventional wall flow filter<br>
substrate comprising an oxidation-active coating is to<br>
be extended to include an ammonia blocking function<br><br>
without losing its existing properties. It is quite<br>
common for such conventional catalytically active wall<br>
flow filter substrates to have an oxidation-active<br>
coating which is distributed homogeneously in the wall<br>
over the entire length of the component, which fills<br>
the pores up to the inflow-side surface. To obtain the<br>
ammonia blocking function, a coating which is<br>
catalytically active in the SCR reaction is applied<br>
over part of the length of the component to such a<br>
particulate filter on the inflow side. The SCR-active<br>
layer is preferably arranged on the inflow-side surface<br>
of the wall and occupies 5 to 50% of the length of the<br>
component, more preferably 10 to 30%.<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 4 is particularly<br>
preferred when the inventive catalytically active<br>
diesel particulate filter is used in an exhaust gas<br>
aftertreatment system which firstly possesses a highly<br>
active oxidation function connected upstream on the<br>
inflow side for elimination of CO and HC breakthroughs,<br>
and in which there is secondly increased demand for<br>
denitrification of the exhaust gas, when the inventive<br>
diesel particulate filter is generally exposed therein<br>
to exhaust gas temperatures in the range from 100 to<br>
250°C. In this embodiment, both the oxidation-active<br>
coating and the SCR-active coating are distributed<br>
homogeneously in the wall over the entire length of the<br>
device, the SCR-active coating filling the pores up to<br>
the inflow-side surface of the wall, while the<br>
oxidation-active coating fills the pores up to the<br>
outflow-side surface of the wall. This arrangement<br>
likewise satisfies all requirements existing through<br>
the assumed reaction mechanism and the required back-<br>
pressure properties. By virtue of the arrangement of<br>
the SCR-active coating over the entire length of the<br>
device, the diesel particulate filter catalytically<br>
activated in this way exhibits not only an ammonia<br>
blocking function but additionally full low-temperature<br><br>
SCR activity.<br>
The use of the inventive catalytically active diesel<br>
particulate filter allows conventional exhaust gas<br>
aftertreatment systems for removing nitrogen oxides and<br>
particulates from the exhaust gas of internal<br>
combustion engines operated under predominantly lean<br>
conditions to be simplified considerably. Figure 5<br>
shows, by way of example, a prior art exhaust gas<br>
system, as described in WO 99/39809, in the<br>
configuration as a two-flow system. Each cylinder bank<br>
of the engine (0) therein is connected to an exhaust<br>
gas system part which comprises a diesel oxidation<br>
catalyst (6, 6'). The combination of the exhaust gas<br>
lines is followed downstream, in flow direction,<br>
successively by an optionally catalytically activated<br>
diesel particulate filter (7), a metering unit for the<br>
reducing agent (8) required in the SCR reaction, for<br>
example urea, and an SCR catalyst (9). To prevent<br>
ammonia breakthroughs, a downstream ammonia slip<br>
catalyst (10) is required.<br>
The use of the inventive device allows the essential<br>
constituents of such an exhaust gas aftertreatment<br>
system to be reduced. To remove nitrogen oxides and<br>
particulates from the exhaust gas of internal<br>
combustion engines operated under predominantly lean<br>
conditions, it is thus sufficient when a corresponding<br>
system comprises a catalyst suitable for removal of<br>
nitrogen oxides and an inventive catalytically active<br>
diesel particulate filter. The catalyst suitable for<br>
removal of nitrogen oxides may be a nitrogen oxide<br>
storage catalyst (12, 12') arranged on the inflow side<br>
of the diesel particulate filter (11) according to this<br>
invention. Such an embodiment is shown schematically in<br>
figure 6 for the case of a two-flow configuration of<br>
the system.<br><br>
In a preferred form of the inventive exhaust gas<br>
aftertreatment system, the catalyst suitable for<br>
denitrification used is an SCR catalyst (9) with an<br>
equipment for metered addition of ammonia or of a<br>
compound decomposable to ammonia (8), which is likewise<br>
present on the inflow side of the inventive diesel<br>
particulate filter (11) . Such an embodiment is shown<br>
schematically in figure 7 for the case of a two-flow<br>
configuration of the system. In this case, it may be<br>
advantageous for use in some vehicle types when a<br>
diesel oxidation catalyst (6, 6') or a three-way<br>
catalyst (13, 13') or a nitrogen oxide storage catalyst<br>
(12, 12') or combinations thereof are arranged in the<br>
emission control system between the internal combustion<br>
engine (0) operated under predominantly lean conditions<br>
and the equipment for metered addition of ammonia or of<br>
a compound decomposable to ammonia (8).<br>

iron-exchanged zeolite, the inventive diesel<br>
particulate filter [#2] (▲) a copper-<br>

In the examples described below, various embodiments of<br>
the inventive catalytically active diesel particulate<br>
filters were produced. Their reactivity and selectivity<br>
in the ammonia oxidation was studied on a model gas<br>
test bench compared to the conventional diesel<br>
particulate filter produced in the comparative example.<br>
The following test conditions were selected:<br><br>
By means of a suitable gas analysis system, the<br>
concentrations of ammonia, dinitrogen monoxide,<br>
nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide were detected<br>
downstream of the catalyst. Under the justified assump-<br>
tion that, apart from these nitrogen-containing gases<br>
and molecular nitrogen, no further nitrogen-containing<br>
reaction products form from the ammonia oxidation, the<br>
following balance equation can be used to determine the<br>
concentration of the reaction target product N2:<br><br>
The nitrogen concentration thus obtained and the<br><br>
ammonia concentration metered in are used to calculate<br>
the selectivity for nitrogen as follows:<br><br>
To assess the measurement results, the concentration of<br>
ammonia downstream of the catalyst and the selectivity<br>
for nitrogen were plotted as a function of the tempera-<br>
ture. The results are shown in figures 8 and 9.<br>
Comparative example:<br>
A wall flow filter substrate composed of silicon<br>
carbide was provided with a conventional oxidation-<br>
active coating which was introduced into the wall with<br>
the aid of the procedure described in DE 10 2004 040<br>
548 Al.<br>
The filter substrate had a diameter of 14.4 centimeters<br>
and a length of 7.62 centimeters, and had 47 cells per<br>
square centimeter with a wall thickness of 0.3 milli-<br>
meter. The walls of the filter substrate had pores with<br>
a mean diameter of 20 micrometers; the porosity of the<br>
walls was 60%.<br>
The oxidation-active coating comprised essentially<br>
platinum, which was supported on a high-surface area<br>
aluminum oxide doped with lanthanum oxide. The amount<br>
of coating applied was selected such that the finished<br>
diesel particulate filter contained 0.7 g/l of noble<br>
metal, based on the volume of the coated filter<br>
substrate.<br>
Three drilled cores with a diameter of 2.54 centimeters<br>
were taken from the finished diesel particulate filter.<br>
In a model gas system, the characteristic ammonia<br>
oxidation performance was studied by the method<br><br>
described above on one of these drilled cores [#0].<br>
Example 1:<br>
A coating which was active in the SCR reaction and<br>
comprised predominantly iron-exchanged zeolites was<br>
applied to the inflow side of a second drilled core<br>
which had been taken from the diesel particulate filter<br>
from the comparative example. The length of the coated<br>
zone was 2.54 centimeters, i.e. 33% of the length of<br>
the overall component. 50 g/l of the SCR-active<br>
material, based on the volume of the filter substrate,<br>
were applied.<br>
The characteristic ammonia oxidation performance of the<br>
inventive catalytically active diesel particulate<br>
filter [#1] thus obtained was studied by the above-<br>
described method in the model gas system.<br>
Example 2:<br>
A coating which was active in the SCR reaction and<br>
comprised predominantly copper-exchanged zeolites was<br>
applied to the inflow side of the third drilled core<br>
which had been taken' from the diesel particulate filter<br>
from the comparative example. The length of the coated<br>
zone was 2.54 centimeters, i.e. 33% of the length of<br>
the overall component. 50 g/l of the SCR-active<br>
material, based on the volume of the filter substrate,<br>
were applied.<br>
The characteristic ammonia oxidation performance of<br>
this inventive catalytically active diesel particulate<br>
filter [#2] was also studied by the method described<br>
above in the model gas system.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show the result of the studies in the<br>
model gas.<br><br>
In figure 8, the ammonia concentration downstream of<br>
the catalyst is plotted as a function of the reaction<br>
temperature. This concentration serves as a measure of<br>
the general activity of the diesel particulate filters<br>
studied in the ammonia oxidation. It is obvious that<br>
the general ammonia oxidation activity of the inventive<br>
diesel particulate filters does not differ signifi-<br>
cantly from the conventional diesel particulate filter:<br>
above 250°C, ammonia is oxidized completely.<br>
The significant advantage of the inventive<br>
catalytically active diesel particulate filters is<br>
found in the selectivity of the ammonia oxidation for<br>
nitrogen. While this is lost above 300°C in the case of<br>
the conventional diesel particulate filter (0), since<br>
ammonia is completely overoxidized to nitrogen oxides<br>
(predominantly NO2) , the inventive diesel particulate<br>
filters exhibit outstanding selectivity data over the<br>
entire temperature range. The best results with<br>
selectivity values of more than 70% are observed for<br>
the diesel particulate filter [#2] (▲) with the copper-<br>
containing, SCR-active coating, but the inventive<br>
diesel particulate filter [#1] (•) with the iron-<br>
containing SCR-active coating also exhibits good<br>
selectivity values of more than 30% in the 250 to 550°C<br>
temperature range.<br>
The inventive catalytically active diesel particulate<br>
filter with ammonia blocking function is thus<br>
outstandingly suitable for use in exhaust gas systems<br>
which serve for the simultaneous removal of nitrogen-<br>
containing pollutant gases and particulates, and which<br>
can now be simplified in accordance with the invention<br>
in the manner described.<br><br>
