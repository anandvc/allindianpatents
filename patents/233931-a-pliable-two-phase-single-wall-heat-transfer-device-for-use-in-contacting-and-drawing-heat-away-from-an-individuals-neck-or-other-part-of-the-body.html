				<td>This invention pertains to apparatus and methods for abstracting<br>
heat from a substance.<br>
More particularly, the invention pertains to an improved apparatus<br>
and method which utilizes a matrix comprised of liquids and solids to abstract,<br>
over an extended period of time., heat from a substance,<br>
In a further respect, the invention pertains to an improved apparatus<br>
of the type described which utilizes a plurality of heat transfer elements having<br>
three dimensional parity.<br>
In another respect, the invention pertains to an improved heat<br>
abstracting apparatus of the type described which converts heat along paths<br>
intermediate spaced apart heat transfer elements.<br>
In still a further respect, the invention pertains to an improved<br>
apparatus and method of the type described in which heat transfer elements are<br>
shaped to absorb heat along vertical and lateral paths.<br>
In still another respect, the invention pertains to an improved<br>
simplified method of manufacturing a heat transfer device.<br>
In yet a further respect, the invention pertains to an improved heat<br>
abstracting apparatus of the type described which provides efficient transfer<br>
using a single heat transfer element-liquid interface.<br><br>
So called "cold packs" are well known and typically, for example,<br>
comprise pliable, hollow, vinyl containers filled with a gelatin. In use, the cold<br>
pack is frozen and is placed against an individual's neck or other part of the<br>
individual's body to cool the individual. One such conventional cold pack is<br>
marketed under the trademark "THERAPAC" and comprises a twelve inch-by-<br>
twelve inch two ply vinyl container filled with a white odorless insoluble gelatin.<br>
Another conventional cold pack is marketed under the trademark "COLPAC" and<br>
comprises a twelve inch-by-twelve inch single ply polymer container filled with<br>
a gray odorless soluble gelatin. Such conventional cold packs are widely<br>
disseminated and effectively absorb heat. One principal disadvantage of such<br>
cold packs is that they have a relatively short-lived, ability to stay cold. For<br>
example, when the THERAPAC and COLPAC cold packs noted above are<br>
removed from a freezer, the temperature on the outer surface of the cold pack<br>
can be five degrees F. After about an hour, the temperature can be about forty-<br>
five to fifty degrees F. After about two hours, the temperature on the outer<br>
surface of the cold packs can be about fifty-two to fifty-eight degrees F. After<br>
about three hours, the temperature can be about sixty-five to seventy degrees<br>
F. Consequently, after only an hour the temperature of the outer surface of each<br>
of the cold packs is well above freezing.<br>
Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide an improved<br>
cold pack which would, after being exposed to ambient temperature, maintain<br>
a low temperature for an extended period of time.<br>
Therefore, it is a principal object of the invention to provide an<br>
improved apparatus for abstracting heat from a solid, liquid, gas or other<br>
substance.<br>
A further object of the instant invention is to provide an improved<br>
cold pack which will maintain a cold temperature for an extended period of time<br>
after being exposed to a temperature greater than that of the cold pack.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method for<br>
manufacturing a cold pack.<br>
Still a further object of the invention is to provide a heat transfer<br>
device that facilitates conforming the device to the contour of the body.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved heat<br>
transfer device with a module matrix that facilitates folding the device and<br>
partitioning the device.<br>

is abstracted from the substance into the first liquid by conduction through the<br>
wall of the primary container, such that heat abstracted into the first liquid by<br>
conduction through the wall of the primary container causes the liquid to have<br>
a nonuniform temperature and produces circulatory motion in the liquid due to<br>
variation in the density of the liquid and the action of gravity, and such that heat<br>
is abstracted from the first liquid by the conduction through the wall of the<br>
auxiliary container.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved<br>

side. The first direction is substantially normal to the second direction.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, I provide an improved<br>
two phase single wall heat transfer device for use in contacting and drawing heat<br>
away from a substance. The heat transfer device includes an outer wall<br>

containers mounted in the inner space; a first heat-exchange composition in the<br>
inner space contacting each of the fluid containers and comprising a liquid which<br>
undergoes a change of state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a<br>

in each of hollow containers comprising a liquid which undergoes a change of<br>
state from the liquid phase to the solid phase at a selected temperature of<br>

Turning now to the drawings, which depict the presently preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention for the purpose of illustrating the practice thereof<br>
and not by way of limitation of the scope of the invention, and in which like<br>
reference characters refer to corresponding elements throughout the several<br>
views, Fig. 1 illustrates a heat transfer device generally identified by reference<br>
character 10. Device 10 includes a spherical hollow primary container having<br>
a wall 11 including spherical outer surface 12 and spherical inner surface 13.<br>
A liquid 14 is housed inside the primary container. At least one auxiliary<br>
spherical hollow container 15 is in and free to move and circulate about the<br>
reservoir formed by liquid 14. Each hollow container 15 includes a spherical wall<br>
30 having a spherical outer surface 16 and a spherical inner surface 17. A liquid<br>
18 is housed inside each auxiliary container 15. Liquid 14 has a lower (cooler)<br>
freezing point than liquid 18, and preferably, but not necessarily, has a freezing<br>
point lower than the coldest temperatures found in conventional household or<br>
commercial freezers. By way of example, and not limitation, liquid 14 presently<br>
comprises propylene glycol and liquid 18 comprises water. Liquid 18 preferably<br>
has a freezing point greater or equal to the coldest temperature found in<br>
conventional household or commercial freezers.<br>
Other examples of compositions that can be utilized as liquid 14 or<br>
liquid 18 include aqueous solutions of ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol,<br>
PRESTONE, iso-propyl alcohol, and glycerol. Magnesium chloride, sodium<br>
chloride, and calcium chloride brines can be utilized. Refrigerants which can be<br>
utilized as liquid 14 include ammonia, ethyl chloride, and methyl chloride.<br>
The wall 11 is preferably, although not necessarily, fabricated from<br>
a pliable vinyl or other pliable material so that wall 11 will conform to a part of<br>
an individual's body or will conform to some other object that is contacted by<br>
heat transfer device 10. Similarly, the wall 30 is preferably, although not<br>
necessarily, fabricated from a pliable vinyl or other pliable material so that wall<br>
30 will conform to a part of an individual's body or will conform to some other<br>
object. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, device 10 and walls<br>
11 and 15 need not be spherical and can be made to have any desired shape,<br>
contour, and dimension. Walls 11 and 15 need not be pliable and can be<br>
substantially rigid.<br>
In use of the heat transfer device 10, device 10 is placed in a<br>
freezer, Liquid 18, being water, freezes. Liquid 14, being propylene glycol, does<br>
not freeze. After liquid 18 freezes, device 10 is removed from the freezer and<br>
placed against a portion 40 of an individual's body or against some other object<br>
or substance so that device 10 absorbs heat H. Heat is absorbed through wall<br>
11 and into liquid 14 by the transfer of kinetic energy from particle to particle.<br>
When heat is absorbed by liquid 14, liquid 14 has a non-uniform temperature,<br>
i.e., liquid near wall 11 is warmer and has a greater enthalpy than liquid farther<br>
away from wall 11. If liquid near wall 11 has a different temperature, the density<br>
of the liquid near wall 11 is different than the density of cooler liquid farther away<br>
from wall 11. This density differential, along with the force of gravity, causes<br>
circulation and movement of liquid 14. When, during this circulation and<br>
movement, warmed liquid 14 passes by and contacts an auxiliary spherical<br>
hollow container 15, heat is absorbed through wall 30 and into frozen liquid 18<br>
by the transfer of kinetic energy from particle to particle.<br>
The heat transfer device of Fig. 2 is identical to that of Fig. 1 except<br>
that auxiliary containers 15 are connected in a chain to each other and to the<br>
inner surface of wall 13 by links 19, 20, and 21, respectively. This chain can be<br>
slack so that containers 15 can, to a degree, move about in liquid 14, or, the<br>
chain can be substantially rigid so it maintains its shape and dimension even if<br>
pliable wall 11 is displaced.<br>
The heat transfer device of Fig. 3 is identical to that of Fig. 1 except<br>
that auxiliary containers 15 are removed and replaced by an elongate hollow<br>
auxiliary container 31 having a cylindrical wall 24 with a cylindrical outer surface<br>
25 and a cylindrical inner surface 26. Container 31 is filled with a liquid 28<br>
which, like liquid 18, has a freezing point which is greater (warmer) than that of<br>
liquid 14.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, liquids 18 and/or 28 have<br>
a freezing point which is less than that of liquid 14. This embodiment of the<br>
invention is particularly desirable if liquid 14, when frozen, is malleable or is<br>
readily broken into pieces which permit a pliable wall 13 to be displaced and<br>
manipulated like the pliable rubber wall of a hot water bottle can be manipulated<br>
when the water bottle is filled with water<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, liquids 18 and/or 28 have<br>
a freezing point equivalent to that of liquid 14..<br>
The use of the devices of Figs. 2 and 3 is comparable to that of the<br>
heat transfer device of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, auxiliary containers 15 absorb heat from<br>
liquid 14. In Fig. 3, auxiliary container 31 absorbs heat from liquid 14.<br>
The ratio of the mass of liquid 14 with respect to the mass of liquid<br>
18 (or 28) in a device 10 can vary as desired, but is presently preferably about<br>
1:1. As the mass of liquid 18 with respect to the mass of liquid 14 increases, the<br>
heat absorbing capacity of liquid 18 increases, but there is less of liquid 14 to<br>
circulate to containers 15 heat which is absorbed from wall 11. It is believed that<br>
if the mass of liquid 18 greatly exceeds that of liquid 14 (e.g., the ratio of liquid<br>
18 to liquid 14 is, for example, 8:1), then heat will tend to be absorbed directly<br>
by containers 15 instead of first being absorbed by liquid 14 and transferred to<br>
containers 15. This would defeat a primary feature of the invention. The use of<br>
liquid 14 to circulate heat to containers 15 is believed central to the invention<br>
and is believed, at least in part, responsible for why the heat transfer apparatus<br>
of the invention stays cool for unusually long periods of time. The ratio of liquid<br>
18 to liquid 14 is preferably, but not necessarily, in the range of 3:1 to 1:3, most<br>
preferably in the range of 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
The materials utilized to construct walls 11 and 30 and 24 affect the<br>
rate of heat transfer. Thicker walls normally transfer heat at a slower rate;<br>
thinner walls at a faster rate. While polymer material is desirable in walls 11, 24,<br>
30 because pliable polymer materials are readily available, incorporating metal<br>
or other materials which facilitate the transfer of heat is also desirable.<br>
When a device 10 is placed in a freezer to solidify liquid 18, liquid<br>
14 can have a composition which permits it to turn to a gel, but preferably does<br>
not solidify. It is preferred that liquid 14 remain a liquid or become a gel so that<br>
device 10 remains pliable after being frozen. Similarly, when liquid 18 is frozen,<br>
it may turn to a gel and may not completely solidify,<br>
The following example is given by way of demonstration and not<br>
limitation of the scope of the invention.<br>

The liquid in each of the small rubber containers was water. One<br>
and three-fourths pounds of water was used to fill the small rubber<br>
containers, i.e., each small rubber container contained significantly<br>
less than one and three-fourths pounds of water, and, if all the<br>
water in all of the small rubber containers were poured in a<br>
container, the water would have weighed one and three-fourth<br>
pounds. The rubber containers could move about freely in the<br>
propylene glycol. Each ply in the plastic bag had a thickness of<br>
about two to three mils. The wall thickness of each rubber<br>
container was about two to three mils. This cold pack was<br>
identified as "C".<br>
Cold packs A, B, C were all placed at the same time in a freezer. After<br>
several hours, cold packs A, B, C were removed at the same time from the<br>
freezer and placed on a flat table top in a room. The room temperature was<br>
eighty degrees and was maintained at eighty degrees while the following<br>
measurements were made. Measurements were made when the cold packs<br>
were removed from the freezer and at hourly intervals thereafter up to four<br>
hours. Each time measurements were taken, a measurement was taken on the<br>
outer surface of each cold pack and on the interior of each cold pack. The<br>
results are summarized below in Tables I and II.<br>
The above results demonstrate that the cold pack of the invention<br>
(identified as "C") remained much colder for much longer than the conventional<br>
cold packs identified as "A" and "B". These results were surprising and<br>
unexpected and are believed to demonstrate the utility and novelty of the heat<br>
transfer device of the invention.<br>
Another heat transfer device of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 4<br>
and is generally indicated by reference character 32. Device 32 includes outer<br>
wall 33. The material(s) used to fabricate wall 33 can vary as desired. Wall 33<br>
presently preferably comprises a pliable water impermeable material like rubber<br>
or plastic. Wall 33 circumscribes and encloses inner space 36. Cylindrical<br>
hollow fluid containers 34 and 35 are mounted in inner space 36. The shape<br>
and dimension of each container 34, 35 can vary as desired. Each container 34<br>
is fluid tight and completely encloses a space 37. Each container 35 partially<br>
encloses a space 38 and opens into the lower portion of inner space 36 in Fig.<br>
4. Each container 35 can be mounted on floor 46 in an inverted configuration<br>
in which space 38 opens into the upper portion-instead of the lower portion-of<br>
space 36. Each container 34 includes a top 40 and side 41. The thickness of<br>
top 40 and side 41 can vary as desired to vary the ability of heat to traverse and<br>
pass through top 40 and side 41.<br>
Containers 34, 35 are mounted on a floor 46 that extends across<br>
and bifurcates inner space 36 into two separate chambers or spaces. The outer<br>
peripheral edge of floor 46 is attached to wall 33. A first heat-exchange<br>
composition 44 is in the upper chamber created in space 36 by floor 46. A<br>
second heat-exchange composition 45 is in the lower chamber created in space<br>
36 by floor 46. Floor 46 and containers 34 and 35 prevent composition 44 from<br>
intermixing with composition 45, and vice-versa. If desired, floor 46 can be<br>
perforated to allow the flow of fluid 44 into fluid 45, and vice-versa.<br>
The freezing point of composition 44 can vary as desired and can<br>
be equal to that of composition 45, greater than that of composition 45, or less<br>
than that of composition 45, In one presently preferred embodiment, the<br>
freezing point of composition 44 is lower than that of composition 45.<br>
Composition 44 can be the same as composition 45. It is presently preferred,<br>
although not necessary, that compositions 44 and 45 be in a liquid phase when<br>
heated to normal room temperature of 76 degrees F; that composition 45 freeze<br>
at temperatures in the range of fifteen degrees Fahrenheit to thirty-two degrees<br>
Fahrenheit; and, that composition 44 freeze at temperatures less than fifteen<br>
degrees Fahrenheit. In this configuration, composition 45 normally freezes<br>
when placed in a conventional residential freezer while composition 44 does not.<br>
Since composition 44 then remains in a liquid state and since wall 33 normally<br>
is pliable, wall 33 and composition 44 can readily conform to a surface (i.e., the<br>
body of a human being or other animal) even if composition 45 is, when frozen,<br>
rigid.<br>
A third heat-exchange chemical composition can be in space 37 in<br>
each fluid tight container 34. The third composition can be a gas, liquid, or solid<br>
and can have any desired phase transformation temperatures. Practically<br>
speaking, however, the third composition is, as are the first and second heat-<br>
exchange compositions, preferably a fluid at room temperature because the<br>
heat-exchange compositions preferred in the practice of the invention either<br>
remain in a fluid form or transform between only two phases, the liquid phase<br>
and the solid phase of the heat-exchange composition. Gases have minimal<br>
thermal capacity and ordinarily are difficult to transform into liquids or solids at<br>
normal ambient, freezing or heating temperatures.<br>
When the upper portion of wall 33 in Fig. 4 is placed against a<br>
substance having a temperature cooler than that of an aqueous liquid<br>
composition 44, heat from composition 44 travels outwardly through wall 33<br>
causing the temperature of the portion of composition 44 adjacent wall 33 to<br>
cool. When the composition 44 cools, the density of the cooled liquid increases,<br>
causing the liquid to move downwardly under gravity in a convection current in<br>
the direction of arrow A.<br>
When the lower portion of wall 33 in Fig. 4 is placed against a<br>
substance having a temperature warmer than that of a liquid composition 45,<br>
heat from the substance is absorbed by composition 45 through the lower<br>
portion of wall 33. The warmed portion of composition 45 typically carries the<br>
heat by convection upwardly in the direction indicated by arrow B. Fluid<br>
circulating in the manner indicated by arrows A and B travels adjacent the sides<br>
41,43 and tops 40,42 of containers 34 and 35, permitting heat to travel through<br>
the containers between compositions 44 and 45. The shape and configuration<br>
of containers 34 and 35 is important in this respect. A plurality of spaced apart<br>
containers 34 and 35 is preferred because the upstanding sides 41, 43<br>
significantly increase the surface area available to compositions 44 and 45.<br>
Further, when sides 41 and 43 are substantially normal to floor 46 and top 40 or<br>
42, heat can be absorbed substantially vertically through a top 40, 42 or floor 46<br>
in the direction indicated by arrow C and can be absorbed substantially laterally<br>
through a side 41 and 43. A side 41,43 is substantially normal to floor 46 or top,<br>
40, 42 if the side is at an angle in the range of sixty to one-hundred and twenty<br>
degrees, preferably in the range of seventy-five to one-hundred and five<br>
degrees, to floor 46 or top 40, 42. In Fig. 4, sides 41 and 43 are normal to tops<br>
40, 42 and floor 46. Another reason containers 34 and 35 are preferred is that<br>
when fluid flows between containers 34 and 35 or into a container 35, turbulent<br>
flow and eddy currents are believed more likely to occur, particularly if the<br>
distance between adjacent containers is one inch or less. Turbulent flow and<br>
eddy currents facilitate the intermixing of warmed fluid 44 (or 45) with cooler fluid<br>
44 (or 45). This intermixing of fluid 44 having different temperatures facilitates<br>
the efficient transfer of heat from a substance to fluid 44 and from fluid 44 either<br>
through containers 34, 35 to composition 45 or to a third composition in spaces<br>
37 in containers 34. Heat can also, if desired, transfer from composition 45 to<br>
fluid 44 in the event that composition 45 is used to absorb heat.<br>
Another preferred feature of containers 34 and 35 is that each<br>
container have substantial dimensional parity. Dimension parity is important<br>
because it slows the absorption of heat by the container 34 and 35. Slowing the<br>
absorption of heat tends to extend the useful life of device 32 as a cooling<br>
device. If containers 34 and 35 do not have dimensional parity and instead take<br>
on the configuration of a sheet or panel, the composition in each container 34,<br>
35 tends to more rapidly absorb heat. A container 34, 35 has dimensional parity<br>
when the height and width of a cross-section taken through the center (or<br>
estimated center) of the container and normal to the length (i.e., normal to the<br>
greatest dimension of the container) are substantially equal. The height and<br>
width of such a cross-section of the container are substantially equal when the<br>
ratio of the height to the width is in the range of 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 3:1 to 1:3.<br>
A sphere has substantial dimensional parity because the height and width of a<br>
cross-section through the center of the sphere are equal, i.e., are each equal the<br>
diameter of the sphere. Therefore, for a sphere, the ratio of the height of the<br>
cross-section to the width of the cross-section is 1:1. A cube has substantial<br>
dimensional parity because the ratio of the height to the width of a cross-section<br>
that passes through the center of the cube, passes through four of the comers<br>
of the cube, and is normal to a centerline passing through two corners of the<br>
cube is 1:1.<br>
A parallelepiped that is 4 cm high, 6 cm wide, and 8 cm long has<br>
substantial dimensional parity because the ratio of height to the width of a cross-<br>
section taken through the center and normal to the longitudinal centerline of the<br>
parallelepiped 1:1.5.<br>
A parallelepiped which is in the shape of a panel and has a length<br>
of 8 cm, height of 4 cm, and a width of 0.5 cm does not have substantial<br>
dimensional parity because the ratio of the height to the width of a cross-section<br>
taken through the center and normal to the longitudinal centerline of the<br>
parallelepiped is 8:1 (i.e., is 4 to 0.5). This parallelepiped would, because of its<br>
narrow width, more rapidly absorb heat and dissipate the thermal absorption<br>
capacity of the composition in or comprising the parallelepiped.<br>
When the side 41, 43 and top 40, 42 of a container 34, 35 are thin-<br>
walled, i.e., are less than about two millimeters (mm) thick (i.e., having a<br>
thickness of two mm plus or minus 10%), and have a substantially uniform<br>
thickness (i.e., the thickness of the side(s), top, and, if appropriate, bottom, walls<br>
at all points varies by no more than about two millimeters), then the outer<br>
dimensions of the container provide a good indication of whether the container<br>
has substantial dimensional parity. If, however, the thickness of a wall(s) of the<br>
container is greater than about two mm and/or the thickness of the walls is not<br>
substantially uniform, then the outer dimensions of the container may not<br>
provide a good indication of whether the container has substantial dimensional<br>
parity, and the configuration of the space 37, 37A inside the container 34, 35<br>
needs to be taken into account to determine if there is substantial dimensional<br>
parity. The same criteria used to evaluate the dimensional parity of the outside<br>
shape and dimension of a container 34, 35 can be utilized to evaluate the<br>
dimensional parity of the space 37, 37A inside a container 34, 35. If the space<br>
37, 37A is the shape of a cube, then the space has dimensional parity. If the<br>
space 37, 37A is the shape of a sphere, then the space has dimensional parity.<br>
If the space 37, 37A is the shape of a parallelepiped having a length of 8 cm, a<br>
height of 4 cm, and a width of 0.5, then the space does not have substantial<br>
dimensional parity. In Fig. 5, containers 53 and 54 are not thin-walled. Since,<br>
however, the cross-sections of the spaces inside containers 53 and 54 have the<br>
shape of a cube, containers 53 and 54 have substantial dimensional parity. The<br>
heat transfer container illustrated in^J.S. Patent No. 2,595,328 to Bowen does<br>
not appear to have substantial dimensional parity.<br>
Another heat transfer device 50 is illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 and is<br>
similar to heat transfer device 32. A particular advantage of device 50 is that it<br>
only requires outer liquid impermeable wall 51 and does not require a floor 46<br>
because containers 52, 53, 54 are connected to a portion of wall 51 and extend<br>
into space. This makes device 50 inexpensive to manufacture. Each container<br>
52, 53, 54 includes a fluid tight wall 57, a top 58, and a bottom that comprises<br>
a portion of wall 51. The inner space 60 of each container includes a heat-<br>
exchange composition 60. Inner space 55 is circumscribed and enclosed by<br>
wall 51 and includes heat-exchange composition 56. The freezing point of<br>
composition 56 can be greater than, less than, or equal to the freezing point of<br>
composition 60. In one presently preferred embodiment, the freezing point of<br>
composition 60 is a higher temperature than the freezing point of composition<br>
56.<br>
The distance, indicated by arrows E, between an adjacent pair of<br>
containers 52 can vary as desired, as can the height, indicated by arrows F, and<br>
the width, indicated by arrows G, of a container 52. To facilitate the transfer of<br>
heat between compositions 56 and 60, it is preferred that a plurality of<br>
containers 52 be provided. As the number of containers 52 increases, the<br>
available surface area increases. By way of example, and not limitation,<br>
containers 52 presently preferably have a width G in the range of one-quarter<br>
to one inch, and a height in the range of one-quarter to one inch. This<br>
distance E between adjacent containers is in the range of one-quarter to three-<br>
quarters of an inch. Arrows H to K in Fig. 5 illustrate possible liquid flow paths.<br>
Liquid traveling along these flow paths transports heat by convection away from<br>
wall 51 toward containers 52, 53, 54.<br>
Heat transfer device 60 in Fig. 7 includes parallelepiped wall 61<br>
circumscribing and enclosing inner spaces 62 and 67 and hollow fluid tight<br>
containers 63, 64 mounted on wall 62. A heat-exchange fluid or solid is in each<br>
container 63, 64. Rectangular plate 66 separates spaces 62 and 67. Pump 69<br>
circulates a heat-exchange liquid. The liquid flows out of space 62 in the<br>
direction of arrows 68, through pump 69, and back into space 67 in the direction<br>
of travel indicated by arrows 70. Liquid flowing into space 67 flows through<br>
perforations 65 back into space 62.<br>
Heat transfer device 80 in Fig. 8 includes outer wall 81. Walls 61,<br>
81 normally, but not necessarily, are liquid impermeable. Hollow fluid tight<br>
containers 82, 83, 84 are housed within wall 81, are mounted on wall 81, and<br>
extend into the inner space circumscribed by wall 81 in the same manner that<br>
containers 52, 53, 54 are attached to wall 51 and extend into space 55 in Figs.<br>
5 and 6. The inner space circumscribed by wall 81 is filled with a first heat-<br>
exchange composition. Each container 82 to 84 is filled with a second heat-<br>
exchange composition. When the first heat-exchange composition is in a fluid<br>
phase, pump 85 circulates the first heat-exchange composition, The first heat-<br>
exchange composition exits pump 85 and travels through conduit 86 in the<br>
manner indicated by arrows M, N, O. The upper arm 87 of conduit 86 is<br>
perforated such that fluid exits arm 87 under pressure in the direction indicated<br>
by arrow P. The perforations are shaped and spaced to facilitate a uniform rate<br>
of dispersal of fluid out of arm 87 along the length of arm 87, or along a selected<br>
portion of the length of arm 87. The first heat-exchange composition flows around and between containers 82,(8) 84 in the manner indicated by arrows Q,<br>
R, S and re-enters pump 85, which again directs the composition into conduit<br>
86 under pressure.<br>
Walls 33 and 51 and 61 and 81, floor 46, and containers 34, 35, 52,<br>
53, 54, 63, 64, 82, 83, 84 can be rigid or flexible or pliable, elastic or non-elastic,<br>
porous or non-porous, fluid tight or not fluid tight, have one or more layers, and<br>
can be constructed from any desired material including, without limitation, resin,<br>
metal, glass, concrete, plaster, porcelain, and paper.<br>
As earlier noted, fluid can be circulated in the heat transfer device<br>
of the invention by convection and by the use of a pump. Fluid can also be<br>
circulated by shaking the heat transfer device and by, when the outer wall 33,<br>
51,61, 81 is pliable, manually kneading or displacing the wall to move the heat-<br>
exchange composition 44, 56 in the device.<br>
As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, in Fig. 4 either the<br>
top or bottom of wall 33 can be placed against a surface to be heated or cooled.<br>
In Fig. 4, only containers 34 or only containers 35 can, if desired, be utilized and<br>
mounted on floor 46.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the containers 52 in Fig. 5 each<br>
are cylindrically shaped, are of equivalent shape and dimension, have a<br>
diameter and height of about one-half inch, are equidistant from other adjacent<br>
containers, and are spaced apart about one-half inch in a checker board array<br>
similar to that shown in Fig. 6.<br>
In Fig. 4, containers 34, 35 approximately double the surface area<br>
exposed to composition 44. If containers 34, 35 are not utilized and floor 46 is<br>
a flat, continuous member extending completely across device 32, then the<br>
surface area exposed to composition 44 is about equal to the sum of the area<br>
of the tops 40, 42 of the containers 34, 35 and the area of the portions of floor<br>
46 extending intermediate containers 34, 35 in the manner shown in Fig. 4.<br>
When containers 34, 35 are utilized, the surface area exposed to composition<br>
44 equals the sum of the area of tops 40, 42 plus the area of the portions of floor<br>
46 extending intermediate containers 34, 35 plus the sum of the cylindrical<br>
surface areas of each side 41,43. 100% of the surface area of each container<br>
35 is in contact with composition 44. All of the surface area of each container<br>
34 is in contact with composition 44 excepting the circular base, which is in<br>
contact with composition 45. The proportion of the surface area of each<br>
container 34, 35 in contact with composition 44 or 45 is in the range of 20% to<br>
100%, preferably in the range of 55% to 100%, most preferably in the range of<br>
70% to 100%. In U.S. Patent No. 2,595,328 to Bowen, only 50% of each<br>
receptacle 8 is in contact with material 7 positioned above receptacle 8. The<br>
more desirable embodiments of the invention illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5 herein<br>
utilize containers 34, 35 having well over 50% of the containers in contact with<br>
composition 44 and/or 45.<br>
The use of containers 34, 35, 52, etc. that remain in fixed position<br>
comprises one preferred embodiment of the invention because the containers<br>
34, 35, 52 are prevented from bunching together. This insures that the heat<br>
transfer characteristics of the heat transfer device remain fixed and more evenly<br>
distributed throughout the device.<br>
Another important feature of the invention is the proportion of the<br>
surface area of floor 46 (or of the bottom area of a wall 51 on which containers<br>
52, 53, 54 are mounted in Fig. 5) intermediate containers 34, 35 with respect to<br>
the surface area of floor 46 occupied by the base of each container 52, 53.<br>
This is important because there must be sufficient space intermediate<br>
containers 52, 53 to permit fluid to circulate in the manner indicated by arrows<br>
A and B (and arrows H to K in Fig. 5) so heat can be transferred through floor<br>
46 to fluid 45 and/or through walls 41 and 43 to fluid 45 or to fluid in spaces 37.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 2.595.328 discloses a heat transfer device which has little floor<br>
space (zones 9 in Bowen) and, consequently, which permits little lateral heat<br>
transfer and little heat transfer through zones 9. The ratio of the surface area<br>
of floor 46 intermediate containers 34, 35 to the surface area of the bases of<br>
containers 35, 35 (where in Fig. 4 the surface area of each base of a cylindrical<br>
containers 34, 35 is equal to the surface area of the top 40, 42 of the container)<br>
is in the range of 1:3.5 to 10:1, preferably 1:2 to 10:1.<br>
Similarly the proportion of the surface area of containers 34, 35 that<br>
permits lateral heat transfer D is important in the practice of the invention. The<br>
proportion of the surface area of the side(s) of a container 34, 35 to the total<br>
surface area of the container is in the range of 1:4 to 10:1. The receptacles 8<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 2,595,328 to Bowen are not constructed to significantly utilize<br>
lateral heat transfer The total surface area of container 35 herein includes the<br>
area of top 42 plus the area of side 43. The total surface area of container 34<br>
includes the surface area of circular top 40, the surface area of cylindrical side<br>
41, and the area of the circular base of container 34. If the proportion of the<br>
surface area of the side(s) of a container 34, 35 with respect to the total surface<br>
area of the container is too great (i.e., is, for example, 12:1), then it is likely the<br>
container is either losing dimensional parity or is so tall that it interferes with<br>
proper fluid circulation. Similarly if the proportion of the surface area of the<br>
side(s) of a container 34, 35 with respect to the total surface area of the container is too small (i.e., is for example 1:6), then it is also likely the container<br>
is losing dimensional parity and/or is so short that the lateral heat absorption D<br>
is adversely affected.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, fluid 56 has a lower<br>
freezing point than the fluid in containers 52. For example, fluid 56 is glycol and the fluid 60 in containers 52 is water. Device 50 is placed in a conventional<br>
residential freezer in a refrigerator. Fluid 60 freezes. Fluid 56 does not. The<br>
upper portion of wall 51 in Fig. 5 is placed against the back of the neck of an<br>
individual. Since fluid 56 is in a liquid state, fluid 56 and the upper portion of<br>
pliable wall 51 readily conform to the shape of individual's neck (or shoulder, or<br>
arm, etc.). Fluid 56 absorbs heat. Convection currents H to K carry heat toward<br>
containers 52. The shape and dimension and spacing of containers 52 cause<br>
turbulent flow and eddy current when the convection currents flow into, past, and<br>
between containers 52. Frozen fluid 60 absorbs heat. Eventually a large<br>
enough quantity of heat is absorbed to cause frozen fluid 60 to undergo a phase<br>
transformation from a solid to a liquid.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates another heat transfer device 70 constructed in<br>
accordance with the principles of the invention. Device 70 includes a pan 73,<br>
a module matrix 72, and a seal layer 71.<br>
Pan 73 includes bottom 78 and includes outer parallel elongate<br>
planar lips or edges 88 and 89 and includes inner parallel inset elongate planar<br>
lips or edges 79. The construction of lips or edges 88, 89, 79 is similar to the<br>
construction of lips or edges 88A, 89A, 79A and 79B in pan 173A in Fig. 10C.<br>
The construction of pan 73 is similar to that of pan 173A.<br>
Module matrix 72 includes a plurality of modules 74, 75, 76, 77. In<br>
Fig. 9 there are sixteen equal sized modules 75 in an upper left hand quadrant<br>
I, sixteen equal sized modules 76 in an upper right hand quadrant II, sixteen<br>
modules 74 in a lower left hand quadrant III, and sixteen modules 77 in a lower<br>
right hand quadrant IV. The shape and dimension of each module can, if<br>
desired, vary. However, in Fig. 9 each module 74, 75, 76, 77 has an equivalent<br>
shape and dimension. Adjacent modules 75 in the upper left hand quadrant are<br>
spaced equal distances apart, as are adjacent modules 75 to 77 in the<br>
remaining three quadrant illustrated in Fig. 9. If desired, module matrix 72 can,<br>
and likely would, include additional modules, preferably, but not necessarily, in<br>
sub-matrix groupings of four by four (or sixteen total) modules.<br>
One particular advantage of module matrix 172 is that each<br>
quadrant I, II, III, IV of sixteen modules is spaced apart from any adjacent<br>
modules such that the distance indicated by arrows D5 and D7 is greater than<br>
the distance D6 between modules in a quadrant. This facilitates folding or<br>
cutting device 70 along axis X and/or Y.<br>
Another advantage of module matrix 172 is that each module 74 to<br>
77 has a semi-spherical, cylindrical, semi-ellipsoidal, semi-spheroidal or other<br>
arcuate bottom like modules 77A in Figs. 11B and 11C. Providing modules 74<br>
to 77 with arcuate bottoms faciliates pliably bending or deforming device 70 in<br>
the manner indicated by arrows 201 and 202 in Fig. 10D for heat transfer device<br>
170. The arcuate bottoms of each module 74 to 77 also facilitate the flow of<br>
fluid around the bottoms.<br>
The peripheral edges of seal layer 71 are fixedly sealingly<br>
connected to lips 88, 89 to seal liquid (not visible in Fig. 9) that fills pan 73 and<br>
surrounds modules 74, 75, 76, 77 and that fills each module 74, 75, 76, 77.<br>
Layer 71 is sealingly affixed to edges 88 and 89 in the same manner that layer<br>
71A is affixed to edges 89A and 88A in Fig. 10D.<br>
While distance D5 can vary as desired, D5 is presently preferably<br>
in the range of 16 mm to 24 mm. The distance D6, D2, D8 between a pair of adjacent modules 74 in a quadrant can vary but is presently preferably eight<br>
millimeters to twelve millimeters. The diameter or width W1 (Fig. 11C) of a<br>
module can vary but is presently preferably in the range of 20 mm to 40 mm.<br>
The depth D1 (Fig. 11C) of a module is preferably equal to or about equal to the<br>
width of the module. The bottom 77C (Fig. 10D) of a module can contact or<br>
need not contact the bottom 78, 78A of a pan 73, 173A.<br>
A procedure for fabricating a heat transfer device similar to that<br>
depicted in Fig. 9 is illustrated Figs. 10A to 10D and 11A to 11C.<br>
In Fig. 10A, a deformable pliable sheet 73A of a polymer or some<br>
other material is provided along with a mold 91. Mold 91 includes apertures 92.<br>
Apparatus (not shown) draws air out from the inside of mold 91 through<br>
apertures 92 in the direction indicated by arrow L to draw sheet 73A into the<br>
mold and to contour sheet 73A to the inner surface 91A of the mold. A follower<br>
90 is also provided to assist sheet 73A in contouring to surface 91 A. After<br>
suction is applied to draw air in the direction of arrow L and follower 90 is<br>
simultaneously moved downwardly in the direction of arrow T, sheet 73A<br>
contours to inner surface 91A in the manner illustrated in 10B and a pan 173A<br>
is formed.<br>
In Fig. 10B, pan 173A includes bottom 78A, includes elongate,<br>
parallel spaced apart inset edges 79A and 79B, and includes elongate, parallel,<br>
spaced apart outer edges 88A and 89A.<br>
In Fig. 10C, follower 90 has been removed and nozzle 93 is utilized<br>
to inject fluid into pan 173A to form a reservoir 94.<br>
The module matrix 172A produced using the steps illustrated in<br>
Figs: 11A to 11C is inserted in pan 173A in Fig. 10D.<br>
In Fig. 11A, a deformable pliable sheet 72A of a polymer or some<br>
other material is provided along with a mold 96. Mold 96 includes openings 97.<br>
Each opening 97 includes an upright cylindrical wall and a semi-spherical<br>
bottom. Apparatus (not shown) draws air out from the inside of mold 96 through<br>
apertures 97 in the direction indicated by arrow U to draw sheet 72A into the<br>
mold and to contour sheet 72A to the inner surfaces 96A of the mold. A follower<br>
95 is also provided to assist sheet 72A in contouring to cupped surfaces 96A.<br>
After suction is applied to draw air in the direction of arrow U and follower 95 is<br>
simultaneously moved downwardly in the direction of arrow V, sheet 72A is<br>
contoured to inner surfaces 96A in the manner illustrated in 11B and a module<br>
matrix 172A is formed.<br>
In Fig. 11B, module matrix 172A includes modules 77A.<br>
In Fig. 11C, follower 95 has been removed and nozzles 99 are<br>
utilized to inject fluid into modules 77A to form a reservoir 98 in each module<br>
77A. The fluid charged module matrix 172A is inserted in the pan 173A of Fig.<br>
10 to produce the module matrix 172A-pan 173A combination illustrated in fig.<br>
10D. After the module matrix 172A is inserted in pan 173A in the manner<br>
illustrated in Fig. 10D, a layer 71A is applied to seal the fluid reservoirs 98, 94<br>
to complete the production of a heat transfer device in accordance with the<br>
invention. Layer 71A is continuously sealed to outer edges 88A and 89A.<br>
If desired, module matrix 172A can be inserted in the pan 173A of<br>
Fig. 10C before each module 77A is charged with fluid to form reservoirs 98. Or,<br>
a auxiliary layer similar to layer 71A can be applied to module matrix 172A<br>
before matrix 172 A is inserted in pan 173A. This auxiliary layer would seal fluid<br>
reservoirs 98 in the matrix 172A. After this sealed matrix 172A is inserted in pan<br>
173A, then layer 71A is applied to seal matrix 172A and reservoir 94 in pan<br>
173A.<br>
As earlier discussed, the fluid in reservoirs 98 normally preferably<br>
has a different freezing tempering than the fluid in reservoir 94.<br>
In Fig. 9, the fluid in pan 73 and the fluid in each module 74 to 77<br>
has been omitted for the sake of clarity. The structure of the heat transfer<br>
device 70 of Fig. 9 is generally equivalent to the structure of the heat transfer<br>
device illustrated in Fig. 10D except, of course, that the heat transfer device in<br>
Fig. 10D includes fewer modules than the heat transfer device 70.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 illustrate another heat transfer device 170<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention. Device 170 is generally equivalent<br>
in structure to heat transfer device 70 and to the heat transfer device of Fig. 10D<br>
except that modules 75B in the module matrix 72B are interconnected by semi-<br>
cylindrical channels 100,102,104. Device 170 includes sealing layer 71B and<br>
pan 73B with bottom 78B. The bottom of each module 75B contacts bottom 78B<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 13. It is not, however, necessary that the bottom of each<br>
module 75B contact bottom 78B. Each module 75B is charged with a liquid (not<br>
shown), and pan 73B is charged with a liquid (not shown). The liquid in modules<br>
75B has a different freezing temperature than the liquid in pan 73B. When<br>
device 170 is utilized, the liquid in modules 75B near the peripheral edge 170P<br>
of device 170 tends to melt first. Since channels 100, 102, 104 permit fluid to<br>
flow between modules 75B, channels 100, 102,104 are believed to facilitate a<br>
more uniform distribution of heat into or from device 170. As would be<br>
appreciated by those of skill in the art, in Fig. 11 A, mold 96 can be shaped and<br>
dimensioned to produce a module matrix 172A that would include channels 100,<br>
102, 104.<br>
Having described my invention in such terms as to enable those of<br>
skill in the art to make and practice it, and having described the presently<br>
preferred embodiments thereof. <br>
