				<td>Description<br>
Apparatus for the Production of Granulate<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the production of granulate comprising a perforated<br>
rotating drum with a feeding device for flowable masses in its interior space the exit openings of<br>
which come to overlap at the bottom circumference of the drum with the perforations of the latter,<br>
as well as a cooling belt disposed below the rotating drum upon which the masses, that exit the<br>
drum in the form of drops, fall and solidify.<br>
DE 3421625 discloses an apparatus for the production of granulate comprising a perforated<br>
rotating drum and a cooling belt disposed below the rotating drum, upon which the masses that exit<br>
the drum in the form of drops fall and solidify. The drum according to DE 3421625 is held by<br>
support arms that can be pivoted around a swivel axis that extends parallel relative to and in the<br>
same plane as an axis of the drum. The support arms are formed as rigid parts and have at their<br>
respective free ends a ball bearing to rotatably support the drum.<br>
Another apparatus is known from DE 28 53 054 C3. In the marketplace, these apparatuses are<br>
known under the designation of "rotoformers;" and they have proved their value with regard to the<br>
processing of the most varied kinds of melts of granulate. In these devices, the rotating drum is<br>
held up on both sides above the cooling belt, employing the aid of a support frame. But when the<br>
apparatus is to be serviced or also when the rotating outer tube is to be replaced with another tube<br>
that has a different perforation distribution or a different perforation diameter, a relatively complex<br>
disassembly effort is required because one of the bearings must be axially pulled off before the<br>
drum can be released. Moreover, during operation of such rotoformers, a safety risk may arise at<br>
times because the rotoformers, which is fixedly disposed above the cooling belt, forms together<br>
with the cooling belt a draw-in gap that may result in damage to the device and even possible<br>
injury to the operator.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention consists in providing an apparatus of the kind<br>
described in the introduction specifically in such a way that, on the one hand, easy mounting and<br>
removal of the rotating drum and, on the other hand, safe operation are made possible.<br>
To achieve this object it is envisioned that for an apparatus of the kind as described at the outset<br>
the drum is held on support arms that can be swung around an axis which extends parallel relative<br>
to the axis of the drum. With this configuration, it is possible to pivot the drum in a simple fashion<br>
upwards and away from the cooling belt if service and<br>
maintenance work or similar tasks are to be performed. On the other hand, however, this<br>
way it is also possible to easily adjust the distance between the rotating drum and the<br>
cooling belt and, if in an improvement of the present invention the drum is positioned by<br>
way of a stop that is disposed on a support frame against which the support arms are<br>
pressed, also to provide for the possibility that the rotating drum can be automatically<br>
pivoted upward should any items be pulled into the draw-in gap.<br>
The new configuration therefore allows for better accessibility during service and<br>
maintenance work, increases the safety of the device during its operation and allows,<br>
moreover, for easily carrying out any adjustments in relation to setting the distance of the<br>
rotating drum from the cooling belt.<br>
An improvement of the invention provides therefore that the stop be realized as<br>
adjustable.<br>
An improvement of the invention envisions that the support arms can be configured as<br>
part of a rocker whose arms, extending beyond the swiveling axis, are interconnected by<br>
a cross bar. The result is, on the one hand, a stable swiveling arrangement and, on the<br>
other hand, the driving motor for the drum, usually connected to the driving wheel of the<br>
drum by way of a chain drive, can be disposed on the cross bar whereby a certain weight<br>
equalization is achieved at the location of the rocker that ensures that the rocker including<br>
its rotating drum that is disposed thereon can be pivoted without exercising any major<br>
application of force.<br>
To improve the work processes during service and maintenance tasks or when<br>
exchanging rotating drums, one of the support arms can advantageously have the ability<br>
to pivot around an axis that extends in the vicinity of the swiveling axis and in a<br>
perpendicular direction relative to the swiveling axis. This pivotable support arm can be<br>
equipped with a bearing arrangement that engages on a front side of the drum thereby<br>
making the drum easily accessible for disassembly or assembly tasks, if the drum is to be<br>
pulled off, by way of the simple swinging away of a support arm part.<br>
In an embodiment of this inventive idea, the bearing arrangement can be disposed having<br>
the ability to rotate around a connecting pin that can be fastened on the swivel arm and on<br>
the feeding device. Also, the bearing arrangement can have a bearing guard that can be<br>
pushed into the drum on the front side of the drum and that can be axially pulled out of<br>
the drum, in particular with the assistance of the connecting pin that can also be<br>
configured in such as way that it is possible to axially pull it off the feeding device. If, in<br>
the embodiment of the invention, the connecting pin is equipped with a stop that takes the<br>
bearing guard axially along with it when it is axially pulled off the feeding device, the<br>
subsequent swivel-off process of the swivel arm part is possible. The bearing guard itself<br>
can be held in this case in a suitable embodiment by an axial sleeve in pivot bearings that<br>
are fastened to the support arm; and the axial sleeve can have a collar that acts in<br>
cooperation with the stop of the connecting pin. As will be explained below, this way it<br>
is possible to very easily first release the bearing from the drum thereby allowing for the<br>
carrying out the swivel-off process of the bearing after which the drum can easily be<br>
pulled off. Assembly is effected following these steps in the opposite order.<br>
The invention will be illustrated by way of an embodied example in the drawing and will <br>
be explained in more detail in the following. Shown are in:<br>
Figure 1 an apparatus according to the invention comprising a rotating perforated<br>
drum; in<br>
Figure 2 the enlarged representation of a detail of Figure 1; in<br>
Figure 3 the representation of a partial section along the plane III-III in Figure 2; in<br>
Figure 4 a representation similar to the one in Figure 2, but with partially folded-off<br>
bearing arrangement for the rotating drum; in<br>
Figure 5 a depiction similar to the one in Figure 4, but with completely folded-off<br>
bearing arrangement; and in<br>
Figure 6 the representation similar to the one in Figure 5, but with the drum pulled<br>
off.<br>
Figure 1 shows a granulating apparatus comprised of a rotating perforated drum 1 which<br>
in turn is driven by way of a chain drive 2 by an electric motor 4 having gearing 3.<br>
Rotating drum 1 is here supported by swivel arms 5, 6 that are part of a rocker 7 that can<br>
be pivoted around axis 8 which in turn extends parallel relative to axis of rotation 9 of<br>
drum 1. Driving motor 4 is, in this context, arranged on a connecting bar 10 of rocker 7<br>
which, seen from the perspective of rotating drum 1, is located on the opposite side of<br>
swiveling axis 8. It is easily recognizable that the weight of driving motor 4 and of the<br>
gearing constitutes in an arrangement of this kind a counterweight to rotating drum 1 and<br>
to the feeding tube running inside the drum for the mass that is to be dropped down, and<br>
of which tube a part 11 extends laterally from drum 1. By way of part 11 of the<br>
stationary feeding tube and in a way that is not shown in more detail, the mass that is to<br>
be dropped down is added, usually a melt, which is then released on the bottom side of<br>
rotating drum 1 onto a transport or cooling belt 12, which is drawn as transparent in the<br>
representation according to Figure 1 in order to help show idle roll 13 that is located<br>
below rotating drum 1.<br>
Both rocker 7 with its parts as well as idle roll 13 are supported on a support frame 14.<br>
Uppermost longitudinal bar 15 of this support frame 14 has a stop 16 on each side that is<br>
height-adjustable. Rocker 7 is pressurized counterclockwise by a pneumatic cylinder 17<br>
in such a way that its lever arms 5 and 6 and/or parts of bearing 18 fastened to them end<br>
up resting on stop 16. This allows for the precisely defined adjustment of the height of<br>
rotating drum 1 above belt 12.<br>
Since the melt that is to be introduced through feeding tube 11 is usually heated and must<br>
be maintained at a certain temperature, entry and exit lines 19, 20 for a heating medium<br>
are envisioned in a way known in the art, with the medium flowing inside the feeding<br>
tube in a way known in the art. <br>
Figures 2 and 3 indicate that bearing 18, which is fastened to swivel arm 6, is disposed<br>
centrally around a connecting pin 21 the axis of which falls together with rotational axis 9<br>
of drum 1. Connecting pin 21 is arranged with the ability to rotate and has at its end that<br>
protrudes to the outside a furrowed end cap 22 or a corresponding actuation device and at<br>
its inside end a thread 23 by which it is screwed onto a threaded journal 24 of stationary<br>
inner tube 11 in order to stably support the inner tube. Screwed pin 24 and connecting<br>
pin 21 are also equipped with a guide cone 25 that secures alignment and connection of<br>
pin 21 and inner tube 11.<br>
Envisioned radially inside bearing 18 is a sleeve 26 that is held in a centered fashion but<br>
is axially movable inside bearing 18 and that has at its left end a bearing guard 27 with a<br>
collar 26 extending axially into the front end of drum 1. Envisioned on bearing guard 27,<br>
on the one hand, and on inner tube 11, on the other hand, are shielding pans and sheets<br>
that ensure that cone 25 and thread 23 are covered as much as possible against the<br>
atmosphere prevailing inside drum 1.<br>
In Figure 2 it can be seen that rocker 7 is lifted off stop 16 when in the position according<br>
to Figure 2 and after pivoting counterclockwise - which is effected with the aid of<br>
pneumatic cylinder 17 - it rests according to Figure 3 on stop 16 whereby distance a<br>
between drum circumference 1 and cooling belt 12 is stably and securely adjusted. For<br>
this purpose, stop 16 is configured in such a way that its height is adjustable. This can be<br>
achieved, for example, by placing a collet 30 onto stationary screwed bolt 31 which<br>
makes the adjustment possible, and the adjusted distance is then secured by locking screw<br>
32.<br>
But Figure 2 also shows a swiveling lever 33 having two walls that extend parallel<br>
relative to each other, and the lever overlaps the upper edge of swiveling lever 6 during<br>
operation, as demonstrated in Figure 1. For the purpose of anchoring bearing 18,<br>
swiveling lever 6 comprises a lever part 6a that can be pivoted around an axis 35, and<br>
whereby in the vicinity of swiveling axis 8 axis 35 extends in a perpendicular direction<br>
relative to said swiveling axis 8. Reason and purpose for this lever part 6a, that can be<br>
swung upward, is to allow for the easy removal of bearing 18 from drum 1 in order to, for<br>
example, service or replace the drum. In its position according to Figure 1, swiveling<br>
lever 33 secures lever part 6a in a flush alignment relative to swiveling lever 6. To<br>
remove bearing 18 from the drum, swiveling lever 33 is pivoted upward into its position<br>
according to Figure 2 following the direction of arrow 38.<br>
Afterwards - starting with operating position as shown in Figure 3 - connecting pin 21 is<br>
released from inner tube 11 which is achieved by unscrewing. During this process of<br>
unscrewing, connecting pin 21 is moved to the right thereby releasing cone 25 and taking<br>
with it, via step 36, sleeve 26 which features a stop ring 37 at its right end that engages<br>
with step 36. During the further screwing process, sleeve 26 with bearing guard 27 is<br>
therefore axially moved further to the right by connecting pin 21 until collar 28 exits on<br>
the front side of drum 1. Bearing bush 29 has then also released protection disc 30 and,<br>
after pivoting safety lever 33 in the direction of arrow 38, which in fact cannot occur until<br>
after collar 28 has been loosened from the drum, part 6a of swiveling lever 6 can be<br>
pivoted to the right along with bearing 18, as shown in figure 4, specifically until<br>
reaching the position according to Figure 5 in which it is possible, without problem, to<br>
axially pull off drum 1 from the seating disposed on the opposite side. Inner tube 11 with<br>
an added adapter piece 39 is now also accessible for service and maintenance work, as<br>
shown in Figure 6.<br>
