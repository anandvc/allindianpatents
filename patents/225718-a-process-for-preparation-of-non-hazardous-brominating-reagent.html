				<td>PREPARATION OF NON-HAZARDOUS BROMINATING<br>
REAGENTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of non-hazardous brominating reagents.<br>
The invention particularly relates to suitable mixtures of alkali bromide and alkali bromate<br>
salts that can be prepared in stable form from inexpensive raw material and can be used as<br>
a substitute for liquid bromine in aromatic bromination reactions and also bromine addition<br>
in unsaturated compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Liquid bromine is used to prepare a variety of brominated compounds through addition- or<br>
4<br>
substitution reactions. The latter includes commercially important products such as:<br>
tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA)—a flame retardant, eosin—a pigment used in personal<br>
care products, bromoacetanilide—an analgesic and antipyretic agent, tribromophenol—an<br>
intermediate used in the manufacture of antiseptic, germicide, fungicide, fire extinguishing<br>
fluids, and fire retardant, and 2-bromo-4-nitro acetanilide—a drug intermediate used in the<br>
preparation of nimenslide. Likewise, there are a number of addition compounds of bromine<br>
that have utility as intermediates or products. However, liquid bromine is hazardous by<br>
nature and requires extreme care in its production, transportation, and utilization.<br>
Moreover, for substitution reactions depicted by equation 1, half of the bromine atoms end<br>
up in the effluent as hydrobromic acid.<br>
R—H + Br2 -&gt; RBr + HBr(l)<br>
Bromine atom efficiency of liquid bromine can be 100 % for addition across olefins<br>
(equation 2) but the need to handle the hazardous liquid bromine remains.<br>
R—CH=CH2 + Br2 -&gt; RCHBrCH2Br(2)<br>
Z. E. Jolles (Bromine and its compounds, Ernest Benn Limited London 1966, p352)<br>
describe the preparation of a number of dibromo compounds through addition of liquid<br>
bromine across unsaturated organic compounds. Such products are obtained in high yields<br>
but an important disadvantage is the hazards of handling liquid bromine.<br>
C. A. Buechler and D. E. Pearson, (Survey of organic syntheses Wiley -Inter science, New<br>
York 1970 Chapter?) have reported the preparation of tribromophenol using liquid<br>
bromine as brominating agent. The drawbacks of this method are that it requires special<br>
devices for handling corrosive liquid bromine and at least half of the bromine atoms in the<br>
reagent end up in the effluent in the form of hydrobromic acid.<br>
Reference may be made to S. Armstrong in US 5,475,153, Dec. 12, 1995 who brominated<br>
Bisphenol-A with liquid bromine to get 98 % pure tetrabromobisphenol-A (m.p, 180 °C)<br>
and where hydrogen peroxide was combined with the reactants to reuse the HBr produced<br>
as in equation 1 and thereby reduce the amount of bromine required. However, the<br>
principal difficulty of the hazardous nature of liquid bromine remains.<br>
Brominating agents that are easy to handle are known but are used mainly for more<br>
selective transformations or those where bromine is less effective. A. Groweiss in Organic<br>
Process &amp; Development 2000, 4, 30-33, described the use of sodium bromate for<br>
bromination of aromatic compounds that contain deactivating substituents such as<br>
nitrobenzene, benzoic acid, benzaldehyde, 4-nitrofluorobenzene and 4-fluorobenzoic acid.<br>
In this process, the addition of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid into a stirred aqueous<br>
solution or slurry of the substrate and stoichiometric quantity of bromate salt at 40-100 °C,<br>
leads to the decomposition of the bromate ions and production of active brominating<br>
species. The drawback of sodium bromate is that it is costly and its use cannot be justified<br>
in more conventional bromination reactions that can be effected by liquid bromine as such.<br>
Z. E. Jolles (Bromine and its compounds, Ernest Benn Limited London 1966, p394) has<br>
added a mixture of 356 g (2 moles) of N-bromosuccinimide and 4 g (0.0165 moles) of<br>
benzoyl peroxide over 20 min to a solution of 220 g (2.24 moles) of 3-methyl thiophene<br>
and 4 g (0.0165 moles) benzoyl peroxide in 700 ml of dry benzene under stirring at reflux<br>
conditions. After all the succinimide is added, the reaction mixture is cooled to below 5°C.<br>
The benzene is distilled at 75-78°C under reduced pressure to give 280 g of 3-<br>
bromomethyl- thiophene. Although N-bromos- nide is a useful reagent for specific<br>
bromination reactions, it is a costly brominatinfe, -i,ent and its use cannot be justified in<br>
those bromination reactions where liquid bromine would suffice; even more so since its<br>
preparation involves use of liquid bromine in any case (N-bromosuccinimide is prepared by<br>
reacting succinimide with bromine liquid below 0 °C in potassium hydroxide solution).<br>
P. C. Merker and J. A. Vona (J Chem. Ed. 1949, 26, 613) prepared p-bromoacetanilide by<br>
reacting 31.5 g (0.232 mole) of acetanilide in 50 ml of glacial acetic acid with 38 g (0.119<br>
mole) of pyndinium bromideperbromide in hot 40 ml glacial acetic acid. The mixture was<br>
allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. To it, 2 ml of saturated sodium bisulfite<br>
solution was added. The resulting mass was filtered, washed with water and finally<br>
recrystallized from hot 95% aqueous ethanol to yield 13 g of/7-bromoacetanilide having<br>
m.p. 168 °C. The drawbacks of this method are that the brominating agent requires liquid<br>
bromine and hydrobromic acid in its preparation (L. F. Fieser and M. Fieser, Reagents for<br>
Organic Chemistry Vol. 1, John Wiley, New York, 1967, p967) and the reagent is costlier<br>
than liquid bromine.<br>
G. Rothenberg and J. H. Clark (Organic Process &amp; Development 2000, 4, 270-274) have<br>
claimed the catalytic bromination of various aromatic compounds using an alkali bromideor hydrobromic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 1-2 mol % vanadium<br>
pentoxide catalyst. The drawbacks of this method are that more than stoichiometric<br>
quantities of hydrogen peroxide are required and the reaction needs a catalyst.<br>
G. Ramachandraiah, P. K. Ghosh, A. S. Mehta, R. P. Pandya, A. D. Jethva, S. S. Vaghela,<br>
S. N. Misra (pending US Pat. Appln. No. 09/767,667 [2001]) have prepared<br>
tetrabromobisphenol-A from bisphenol-A using 2:1 molar ratio of bromide and bromate<br>
salts as brominating agent. To 0.50 kg (2.19 moles) of bisphenol-A in 1.50 liters of<br>
methylene chloride, a solution of 0.63 kg (6.14 moles) of sodium bromide, 0.44 kg (2.93<br>
moles) of sodium bromate and 1 g of sodium lauryl sulfate in 2.5 liters of water was added.<br>
The flask was cooled to 10 °C by placing it in'a cold water bath. To it, 0.90 liters (10.8<br>
moles) of 12 N hydrochloric acid was added over 3 h under stirring. The contents were<br>
stirred for another 0.5 h and the separated solid product was filtered, washed twice with<br>
deionized water and dried in oven at 100 °C to give a yield of 0.85 kg of TBBPA. The<br>
organic layer was recycled in subsequent batches. The isolated yield of TBBPA (m.p. 178-<br>
180 °C) over three batches was 85.4 %. Although the method has several advantages in<br>
that the brominating reagent is easy to handle, no catalyst is required, the bromine atom<br>
efficiency for the aromatic substitution reaction studied is as high as 95-100 %, the main<br>
drawback of this method is that alkali bromide and bromate salts are individually much<br>
costlier than liquid bromine. Moreover the 4:2 stoichiometry of bromide:bromate is<br>
suitable for substitution reactions but not for addition of bromine across double bonds.<br>
According to the present invention, the main drawback of pending US Pat. Appln. No.<br>
09/767,667 (2001) has been overcome by using a mixture of alkali bromide and alkali<br>
bromate salts of the desired ratios that can be prepared inexpensively from the intermediate<br>
of bromine recovery plants, the said mixture being easy to handle and stable under storage<br>
while, under the conditions of bromination reaction, the bromide and bromate salts self<br>
annihilate one another to create reactive species of bromine that are useful in the safe<br>
preparation of several organo bromine compounds as demonstrated through working<br>
examples.<br>

In an embodiment of the present invention, the alkaline bromine having 29.3% (w/v)<br>
bromine dissolved in sodium hydroxide (37.2 °Be, pH 8.73) and 28.1% (w/v) bromine<br>
dissolved in lime (37.2 °Be, pH 10.25) are obtained from bromine recovery plants based on<br>
"Cold Process" technology.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, alkaline bromine may be obtained from<br>
other sources than bromine recovery plants based on "Cold Process" technology.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention bromide salt is added to the alkaline<br>
bromine having bromide to bromate ratio less than 5:1 to adjust the bromide to bromate<br>
ratio to 5:1.<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction/mixing is conducted<br>
typically in the temperature range between 25-30 °C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the treated alkaline bromine solutionscontaining 5:1 and 2:1 bromide to bromate are used as reagents for bromine addition and<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the brominating agent can be activated<br>
during bromination reactions addition of a suitable acid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the acid used during the bromination<br>
* reaction is preferably an inexpensive mineral acid and more specifically an acid which<br>
produces soluble calcium salts which is advantageous when the brominating agent is based<br>
on alkaline (lime) bromine and/or calcium hypochlorite.<br>
Bromine is manufactured commercially by the "Steaming Out" and "Cold" Processes. In<br>
the latter process, bromine liberated from the feed by sparging with chlorine gas is initially<br>
trapped in aqueous solution in concentrated form wherein it reacts with the alkali and<br>
disproportionate as per the reaction of equation 3 to produce five parts of bromide ion and<br>
one part of bromate ion. The medium is then acidified to re-liberate bromine as per the<br>
reaction of equation 4. This bromine can then be collected.<br>
3Br2 + 60FT -» 5Bf + BrO3' + 3H2O(3)<br>
5Bf + Br03" + 6H+ -&gt; 3Br2 + 3H2O (4)<br>
whereas, the mixture of bromide and bromate is unstable under acidic conditions, it<br>
is stable over many months under alkaline conditions. It has been found in the course of<br>
this invention that it is possible to apply the knowledge of equation 4 and convert the<br>
it duct mixture of equation 3 into a reagent to carry out the reaction of equation 2 as<br>
shown below:<br>
5Bf + BrCV + 6H+ -&gt; [3Br2] + 3H2O (5a)<br>
R— CH=CH2 + [Br2] -&gt; RCHBrCH2Br (equation 2)<br>
Care must, however, be taken to ensure that sufficient time is given for equation 5a so that<br>
molecular bromine can be generated prior to the reaction of equation 2. Otherwise,<br>
tendency to form side products is higher as demonstrated later in the examples.<br>
The reagent can also be used to carry out equation 6, as described in pending US Pat.<br>
Application No. 09/767,667 (2001), when the reaction mixture containing such<br>
brominating reagent and organic compound is acidified whereupon active bromine is<br>
generated. Alternatively, the brominating agent can be added into a solution of the organic<br>
compound and desired quantity of acid.<br>
3R—H + 5Br" + BrO3'+ 6H+ -» 3RBr +3HBr +3H2O(6)<br>
Pending US Pat. Appln. No. 09/767,667 (2001) states that the bromide/bromate<br>
stoichiometric ratio should be 4:2 instead of 5:1 for maxirmim bromine atom efficiency, <br>
6R—H + 4Bf + 2BrO3'+ 6H+ -&gt; 6RBr + 6H20(7)<br>
It occurred to us in the course of the invention that the desired bromide:bromate<br>
stoichiometric ratio can be achieved in cost-effective manner as shown by equations 8 and<br>
9. Hypochlorite is generated as in equation 8 and used in the reaction of equation 9 to<br>
attain the desired 4:2 stoichiometry of bromide:bromate.<br>
3C12 + 6 OH' -» 3CICT+ 3d' + 3H2O (8)<br>
5Br' + BrO3' + 3CIO' -» 4Br" + 2BrO3" + 3C1'(9)<br>
The preparation of hypochlorite involves handling alkali and chlorine, both of which are<br>
used by manufacturers of bromine by the "Cold Process". Moreover, hypochlorite is<br>
among the cheapest oxidizing agents, which can effect the desired oxidation reaction of<br>
equation 9, and, therefore, is an ideal choice although other oxidizing agents could also be<br>
used.<br>
The reaction of equation 9 is carried out in the L ory in a stoppered 0.25-5.00 L rounu<br>
bottom flask. Alkaline bromine containing 3-265 g of dissolved bromine in lime or sodium<br>
hydroxide was mixed with calculated amount 0.8-63.0 g of sodium hypochlorite under<br>
thorough stirring. The reactants were allowed to react for 6-24 h to obtain the desired<br>
brominating reagent in solution form. The temperature of the vessel during the reaction<br>
was in the range of 27-30 °C. It is advisable to conduct the reaction of sodium hypochlorite<br>
with alkaline bromine in a closed vessel for at least 12 h.<br>
In the second method, the alkaline bromine containing 3-265 g of dissolved bromine was<br>
mixed with a solution of calculated amount (1.5-118 g) of sodium bromate in a 0.25-5.00 L<br>
flask to give liquid brominating reagent or solid on evaporation and drying of it under<br>
vacuum.<br>
Better brominating reagent for equation 7 is obtained if the bromide:bromate ratio is<br>
maintained between 2.0-2.1. Brominating agent with bromide:bromate &gt; 2.1 leads to<br>
decrease in bromine atom efficiency whereas undesired products tend to be produced when<br>
bromide:bromate 
In the preferred form of the invention, the aqueous brominating agent with pH in the range<br>
8.5-10.5 and the desired stoichiometry of bromide:bromate was evaporated on a steam bath<br>
and dried under vacuum to get the reagent in solid form. Bromine manufacturers generally<br>
have access to solar evaporation ponds that can be used to produce the solid reagent costeffectively<br>
on large scale. Apart from the advantage of higher bromine content, such form<br>
of the reagent would be easier and cheaper to transport than the solution.<br>
The brominating reagent (solid and solution) was characterized by determining its bromate<br>
and bromide contents. 1 g of solid or 1 ml of liquid brominating reagent was<br>
dissolved/diluted with water to a volume of 100 ml and used as stock in the estimation of<br>
bromate and bromide. To estimate bromide, 1-4 ml of the stock was taken in a 25 ml<br>
volumetric flask and 2 ml of 9 M sulfuric acid was added and the solution was diluted up<br>
25 ml volumetric flask and into it was added a large excess (1 g) of sodium bromide and <br>
ml of 9 M sulfuric acid and the volume made up to the 25 ml mark. The liberated bromine<br>
as a result of the reaction between bromide and bromate in presence of acid was estimated<br>
spectrophotometrically (K. Kumar and D. W. Margerum Inorg. Chem. 1987 26, 2706-<br>
by measuring the absorbance at 390 nm and using the appropriate molar extinction<br>
coefficient (e, 167 NT1 cm"1 in absence and 522 M~l cm"1 in the presence of large excess<br>
of bromide) values. The homogeneity of solid brominating reagent was confirmed by<br>
estimating bromate and bromide composition in 1 g samples drawn from different parts of<br>
the sample.<br>
Since the bromide:bromate stoichiometry was always maintained slightly higher than the<br>
theoretical ratio of 4:2 as per the requirement of equation 7, the active bromine was always<br>
less than 100 % and was estimated with the help of equation 10:<br>
{3x[BrO3']/([Br03'] + Br"]}xlOO %(equation 10)<br>
The following examples illustrate the method of preparation of the brominating agent and<br>
its application in organic bromination reactions.<br>

reagent can be prepared from mixed salts of alkali bromide and bromate, either as a<br>
solution or solid as desired, (ii) such mixed salt can be prepared cost-effectively from the<br>
alkaline bromine intermediate produced in the process of bromine recovery through the<br>

is achieved by treating the aqueous alkaline bromine solution with 1-10% concentration of<br>

and more preferably by adding alkali into the aqueous alkaline bromine solution and<br>
passing chlorine gas to generate hypochloride in situ which can convert bromide salt to<br>
bromate salt by the process of oxidation.<br>

by addition of appropriate quantities of alkaline bromate salt sodium or calcium bromate<br>
maintaining the pH of the final solution between 8-10 and without any rise in temperature<br>
of the solution.<br>

evaporated by conventional techniques, preferably in solar pans for large scale production<br>
to yield solid brominating reagent which is finally ground to get a homogenous mixture of<br>
salts having bromine content in the range of 35-70%.<br>
