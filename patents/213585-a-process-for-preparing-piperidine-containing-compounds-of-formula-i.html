				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A method of producing an FeCrAl material by gas atomisation, wherein in addition to containing iron (Fe), chromium (Cr) and aluminium (Al) the material also contains minor fractions of one or more of the materials molybdenum (Mo), hafnium (Hf), zirconium (Zr), yttrium (Y), nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and oxygen (O). The invention is characterised by causing the smelt to be atomised to contain 0.05-0.50 percent by weight tantalum (Ta) and, at the same time, less than 0.10 percent by weight titanium (Ti). According to one highly preferred embodiment, nitrogen gas (N¿2?) is used as an atomising gas to which a given amount of oxygen gas (O¿2?) is added, said amount of oxygen gas being such as to cause the atomised powder to contain 0.02-0.10 percent by weight oxygen (0) at the same time as the nitrogen content of the powder is 0.01-0.06 percent by weight. The invention also relates to a high temperature material.</td>

D may also represent   a  piperidine   group,   where   the  nitrogen   substituent is  selected  from the  group consisting  of hydrogen,  methyl,  ethyl,  propyl, butyl,   hydroxyethyl,   hydroxypropyl   or   hydroxybutyl   and   where   the piperidine  nucleus is attached  at 2-,   3-  or 4-position.<br>
The   chemical  compounds   of  this   invention   have  pharmacological properties   that  render  said  compounds   to   be  useful  in  preventing   and treating  pain.  The  compounds  can  also  be  used  to   treat conditions, comprising   convulsions,   hiccup   and   cardiac   arrhythmias   and   can   be   used to  inhibit sodium and  potassium ion  fluxes  over  cell  membranes  in  the body<br>
Prevention  and   treatment  of pain   using  the  compounds  of this invention   may   be   achieved   by   applying   compositions   containing   said chemical  entities  on  the  skin ot by   applying  compositions   containing   said chemical  entities  on  mucosal  membranes  or by  injecting  solutions  of said chemical  entities  to  infiltrate  biological   tissues  with  said  solutions  or  by injecting  solutions of said chemical  entities  in  the  anatomical  vicinity  of nerves,   thereby   allowing  said  chemical   entities   to   penetrate   the  biological tissues   and   cause  dermal   anesthesia,   topical   anesthesia,   infiltration anesthesia   or   nerve   blocks.<br>
The  invention  also  refers  to  compositions,  containing  at least one  of said   chemical   entities   and  combinations   of  the   present  chemical   entities with   various   other  chemical   entities   and   with   various   penetration-promoting   devices.<br>
3<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Membrane   stabilizing   agents,   such   as   lidocaine,  prilocaine, mepivacaine  and  bupivacaine,  have  been  shown  to  possess  local anesthetic  effects and  are  widely  used  for infiltration  anesthesia and  for inducing  nerve  blocks.     These  compounds  have  limited use  as  dermal anesthetics  since  they  have  to  be  given  in  high concentrations,  which increases  the  risk of tissue  irritation  and  tissue damage.     Other compounds,   such   as   tetracaine,   are   better   suited   for  dermal   anesthesia since   they   may   better  penetrate   through   the   tissues.   However,   tetracaine and  similar  drugs  are  esters  and  are known  to  cause  tissue  irritation  and to  be- unstable  in  the  human  body  where  practically  all tissues  contain esterases.<br>
Objectives  of the   present   invention   are   to   obtain  compounds   that are   potent  membrane   stabilizing   agents   with   a  prolonged  effect  as   local anesthetics   and   topical   anesthetics   and   dermal   anesthetics   and   that   have beneficial   penetration   properties   and   are   able   to  penetrate   the   ocular tissues as well as mucosal   tissues,   including   rectal  tissues,   and  also penetrate   through   human   skin   after   topical   dermal   application.   Thus,   the compounds  of the invention  will  assure  short onset  time  and  long duration   of  local  anesthesia,   topical   anesthesia   and   dermal   anesthesia.<br>
It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a method for local,  topical  and  dermal  anesthesia  which is safe, effective,  and  has  a minimum   of  side  effects.<br>
The   mechanism   of  action   of  membrane   stabilizing   agents,   when used as  local  anesthetic or topical  anesthetic drugs,  is  to inactivate ion channels   in   nerves   and   thereby   inhibit  neuronal  impulse  conduction.     To do   this,   the   membrane   stabilizing   compound   needs   to  overcome   the   local penetration   barriers   and   reach   the   nerve   structure   in   a  concentration   that is  high  enough  to  achieve the  therapeutic  objective.  The compounds  of the  present  invention  have  the   ability   to  effectively  overcome  such  tissue penetration    barriers.<br>
The  term topical  anesthesia is  in  this  document defined as  local anesthesia of mucosal  membranes,  such  as  for examples those  the eye, the ear,  the mouth, the nose, the rectal  area and the urogenital  tract.     The Ferm  dermal   anesthesia   is   in   this   document  defined  as  local  anesthesia  of the  skin Infiltration   anesthesia  and  nerve   blocks  of afferent or  efferent nerves  are   in  this  document called  local   anesthesia.<br>
4<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new nerve membrane stabilizing compounds as described above and to methods of inducing local, topical or dermal anesthesia,by-admihisterihg a compositions  containing at least one such chemical entity that has such penetration properties that it in a short period of time can reach the site of action on the nerve ending or a nerve in a concentration that will block the initiation or conduction of action It has been found that compositions containing at least one of the "compounds of the present invention are particularly useful for ocular and dermal anesthesia and for other forms of local anesthesia, such as for example infiltration anesthesia and nerve blocks. The compounds of the present invention are useful for the prevention of pain in connection with inserts of injection needle, surgical procedures and for the treatment of pain in connection with the above mentioned medical procedures, insect bites, sunburn, and for the treatment of shingles and urogenital pain, including hemorrhoids.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides effective methods for treating humans and animals with topical, dermal and local anesthetic compositions, while reducing undesirable side effects, for example local burning and itching and particularly tissue toxicity resulting in necrosis.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

I<br>
E<br><br>
(Formula 5)<br>
wherein E is a residue removable by means of hydrolysis, and n has the meaning given above, to form a compound of formula 5, wherein R is hydrogen.<br>
The reactions are carried out in an inert organic solvent such as benzene or toluene in the presence of a strong base such as sodium amide or sodium hydride.<br>
In the method a) above X may be halogen (CI, Br or I) or a reactive, esterified hydroxy group, that is a hydroxy group esterified with a strong, organic acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-bromobenzenesulfonic acid or 4-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
7<br><br><br>
In method c)  above,  a  residue  removable  by means  of hydrolysis may be e.g. an acyl residue,  which,  when present,  is  a functionally  varied carboxy  group,  e.g.  oxycarbonyl  or alkoxycarbonyl   residues,   such   as   tert.-butoxycarbonyl  residue,   or  ethoxycarbonyl   residue;   an   aralkoxycarbonyl residue  such  as  phenyl  substituted  lower  alkoxycarbonyl  residue,  e.g.   a carbobenzyloxy  residue;  a  halogencarbonyl  residue,  e.g.  a chlorocarbonyl residue;  an  arylsulphonyl  residue  such  as  toluenesulphonyl    or bromobenzenesulphonyl   residues;   a   halogenated,   e.g.   fluorinated,   lower alkanoyl  residue  as formyl-,   acetyl-  or  trifluoroacetyl  residue;  or a  benzyl residue, a cyano group, or a silyl residue, such as trimethylsilyl   residue.<br>
The hydrolysis is carried out in a known way, e.g. in the presence of a hydrolyzing  agent,  e.g.  in  the  presence of an  acidic agent such  as diluted  mineral  acid,  e.g.  sulphuric  acid  or hydrohalogen acid; or    in the presence of a basic  agent such  as  an  alkali  metal  hydroxide,  e.g.  sodium hydroxide.     Oxycarbonyl  residues,   arylsulphonyl   residues   and   cyano groups  may be split off in  a  suitable  way by means of acidic agents such as   hydrohalogen   acid,   suitably   hydrobromic   acid.      Preferably   the   splitting may   take  place  using  diluted   hydrobromic   acid,   possibly  in  a  mixture   with acetic acid. Cyano groups  are  preferably split off by means of hydrobromic   acid   at  an  elevated   temperature,   as   in   boiling   hydrobromic acid,  according  to  the  "cyanogen   bromide   method"   (v.   Braun). Furthermore,   a  tert-butoxycarbonyl   residue   may   be   split  off under anhydrous  conditions  by  means  of treatment  with  a  suitable  acid,   as trifluoroacetic   acid.<br>
In  method  b)  above,  a  residue  removable  by  means  of reduction  is e.g.   an   alpha-arylalkyl residue,  such  as a benzyl  residue, or an alpha-aralkoxycarbonyl  residue such  as  a benzyloxycarbonyl residue, which in a known way may be split off by means of a hydrogenolysis especially by catalytically  activated      hydrogen,  as   by  hydrogen  in the presence  of hydrogenating   catalysts,   e.g.   Raney-nickel  or palladium  on  carbon.     Other residues   removable   by  means   of  reduction   are   2-halogenalkoxycarbonyl residues   as   2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl   residues   or   2-iodoethoxy-   or 2,2,2-tribromoethoxycarbonyl  residues,   which   may  be  split  off in  a  known way,  suitably by  means of a  metallic  reduction  (so-called  nascent hydrogen).  Nascent  hydrogen  may  be  obtained  by  the  action  of metal,  or metal  alloy  as  amalgam,  on  compounds  which  give hydrogen,  such  as carboxyacids,  alcohols or water,  whereby especially zinc or zink  alloys together with acetic acid may  be used.     Splitting off of 2-halogenalkoxycarbonyl  residues   may  likewise  take   place   using  chromium  or  chromium (II)  compounds  as  chromium  (II)  chloride  or chromium  (II)  acetate.<br>
8<br><br><br>
A  residue removable by reduction  may also be such  an arylsulphonyl group as a toluenesulphonyl  group,  which  in   a  known  way may be split off by reduction using nascent hydrogen, i.e.  by means of an<br>
alkalimetal,  such as  lithium or sodium,  in  liquid  ammonia and suitably may be  split off from a nitrogen  atom.  When a residue is removed  by reduction,  one  must  tak*e  care   to  avoid   reduction  of other reducible groups   in   the  molecule.<br>
The  nitrogen  atom   in  the  piperidine  nucleus  may  also  be  substituted with a residue removable by means of ammonolysis,   pyrolysis   and   fermentation,  to form a compound of the Formula I, wherein R is hydrogen.<br>
Residues  splittable  by  ammonolysis  are  especially  the  halogen-carbenyl  residues,   as  the  chlorocarbonyl   residue.     The  ammonolysis  may be carried  out in a common way,  e.g.  by means of an amine containing  at least  one   hydrogen   atom  bounded   to   the   nitrogen   atom,   as   a  mono-or diloweralkylamine,   e.g.   methylamine   or   dimethylamine,   or   especially ammonia,   preferably   at  an  elevated   temperature.     Instead   of ammonia   one may   use   an   agent   which   gives   ammonia   as   hexamethylenetetraamine.<br>
Residues  splittable  by  means  of pyrolysis,  especially  residues splitable  from the nitrogen  atom,  are  in occurring  cases   substituted, preferably   unsubstituted,   carbamoyl   groups.      Suitable   substituents   are e.g. loweralkyl, or arylloweralkyl  as  methyl  or benzyl or aryl,  as phenyl. The pyrolysis is carried out in  a common  way,  whereby one must take care to  avoid pyrolysis   of  other   thermically   susceptible   groups.<br>
Residues   splittable   by   means   of  fermentation,   especially   residues splitable   from   the   nitrogen   atom   are   in   occurring  cases   substituted, however  preferably   unsubstituted   carbamoyl   groups.   Suitable substituents  are e.g.  loweralkyl  or arylloweralkyl,  as  methyl  or benzyl,  or aryl  as  phenyl. The fermentation  is  carried  out in  a common  way,  e.g.  by means of the enzyme urease or soybean extract at about 20°C or at a slightly   elevated   temperature.<br>
The   piperidine-containing   compounds   of  the   invention   are   those   of the  general  formula 2  wherein E is  selected  from the group  consisting of hydrogen,   methyl,   ethyl,   propyl,   butyl,   hydroxyethyl,   hydroxypropyl   or hydroxybutyl and where A, B, Z and n are as stated above.    Starting material   and  compounds   of  formula   6   above  have  been   prepared.<br>

N-Phenyl-2-aminoindane, i.e. SM, (13.2 g, 67 mmol)   was   dissolved in dry  toluene (220 ml),  and sodium amide (4.5  g,   115 mmol)   was   added to   the   stirred  solution  at  room  temperature.   After  3  h,   l-benzyl-2-chloromethylpiperidine   (15   g,   63   mmol)  was   added  and  the  mixture   was stirred at reflux for 20 h. The mixture  was  poured  into  water and extracted  with  diethyl  ether.  The ether  layer  was  washed  with  water and brine   and  dried  over sodium  sulfate.   After  evaporation  of solvent  the residue   was  purified  on  a  silica  gel  column  with  ethyl  acetate:petroleum ether (1:9) as eluent. The product as  the free base (21  g, 79%) was isolated as an oil.<br>
A solution of free base (19 g) in ethanol (300 ml) was acidified to pH   4   with   hydrochloric   acid   in   methanol.   The   mixture   was   hydrogenated at  room  temperature  at 50 psi using Pd/C (10%, 0,5 g) as catalyst. The mixture   was   filtrated   and   concentrated,   and   the   residue   was   crystallized from  acetonitrile  to give   10.2 g (56%)  of TAC 28 as the  hydrochloride.<br>

The reactions are carried out in  an  inert organic solvent such as benzene or toluene in  the presence of a strong base such as sodium amide or   sodium   hydride.<br>
In the method a) above X may be a halogen such as CI, Br or I, or a reactive,  esterified  hydroxy  group,   that  is,   a   hydroxy  group esterified   with a   strong  organic  acid,   such   as  methanesulfonic   acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic   acid,   benzenesulfonic   acid,   4-bromobenzene-sulfonic   acid,   or  4-toluenesulfonic   acid.<br>
In  method c)  above,  a residue  removable  by means  of hydrolysis may be e.g. an acyl residue,  which,  when  present,  is  a  functionally  varied carboxy  group,  e.g.  oxycarbonyl or alkoxycarbonyl  residues,   such   as   tert.-butoxycarbonyl   residue,   or  ethoxycarbonyl   residue;   an   aralkoxycarbonyl residue  such  as  phenyl  substituted  lower  alkoxycarbonyl  residue,  e.g.   a<br>
18<br><br><br>
carbobenzyloxy  residue;   a  halogencarbonyl   residue,  e.g.  a chlorocarbonyl residue;  an  arylsulfonyl  residue  such  as  toluenesulfonyl   or<br>
 bromobenzenesulfonyl   residues;   a   halogenated,   e.g.   fluorinated,   lower alkanoyl residue  as formyl-,  acetyl-  or  trifluoroacetyl residue;  or a  benzyl residue, a cyano group, or a silyl residue, such as trimethylsilyl   residue.<br>
The hydrolysis is carried out in a known way, e.g. in the presence of a hydrolyzing agent,  e.g. in the presence of an acidic agent such as diluted mineral  acid,  e.g.  sulphuric  acid  or hydrohalogen acid; or in the presence of a basic  agent such as  an  alkali metal hydroxide, e.g.  sodium hydroxide.     Oxycarbonyl  residues,  arylsulfonyl  residues  and  cyano   groups may be split off in a suitable way by means of acidic agents such as hydrohalogen   acid,   suitably   hydrobromic   acid.     Preferably   the   splitting maytake  place  using diluted  hydrobromic  acid,  possibly in  a mixture  with acetic acid. Cyano groups  are  preferably  split off by means  of hydrobromic   acid   at  an  elevated   temperature,   as  in  boiling  hydrobromic acid,  according  to  the  "cyanogen   bromide   method"   (v.   Braun). Furthermore,   a   tert-butoxycarbonyl   residue   may   be   split   off  under anhydrous  conditions  by  means  of treatment  with  a suitable  acid,  as trifluoroacetic   acid.<br>
In  method b) above,  a residue  removable by  means of reduction  is e.g.   an   alpha-arylalkyl  residue,  such   as   a  benzyl  residue,  or  an  alpha-aralkoxycarbonyl  residue  such  as  a  benzyloxycarbonyl  residue,   which   in   a known way may be split off by means of    a hydrogenolysis especially by catalytically   activated  hydrogen,   as   by   hydrogen  in  the  presence  of hydrogenating   catalysts,   e.g.   Raney-nickel  or palladium on  carbon.     Other residues   removable   by   means   of  reduction   are   2-halogenalkoxycarbonyl residues   as   2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl   residues   or  2-iodoethoxy-   or 2,2,2-tribromoethoxycarbonyl  residues,   which   may  be  split  off in   a  known way, suitably by means of a metallic reduction (so-called nascerating hydrogen).   Nascerating   hydrogen   may   be   obtained  by  the  action   of  metal, or metal  alloy as  amalgam,  on  compounds  which give hydrogen,  such as carboxyacids,  alcohols  or  water,  whereby  especially zinc  or zinc  alloys together with acetic acid may be used.     Splitting off of 2-halogenalkoxycarbonyl   residues   may   likewise   take  place   using  chromium or chromium  (II)  compounds  as   chromium   (II)  chloride or  chromium  (II) acetate.<br>
A residue removable  by  reduction  may  also be such  an arylsulfonyl group as a toluenesulfonyl  group,  which in a known way may be split off by  reduction  using  nascerating hydrogen, i.e. by means of an alkali metal, such as lithium or sodium,  in liquid  ammonia and suitably may be split<br>
19<br><br>
off from a nitrogen atom. When a residue is removed by reduction, one must take  care  to  avoid reduction of other reducible groups in  the molecule.<br>
The   nitrogen   atom  in   the  piperidine   nucleus   may   also  be   substituted with a residue removable by means of ammonolysis,   pyrolysis   and fermentation,  to form a compound of the formula I, wherein R is hydrogen.<br>
Residues   splittable  by  ammonolysis   are  especially   the  halogeno-carbonyl  residues,   as   the  chlorocarbonyl  residue.     The  ammonolysis   may be  carried out in a common way, e.g. by means of an amine containing at least  one  hydrogen  atom bounded  to the  nitrogen  atom,  as  a mono-or  di-loweralkylamine,  e.g.  methylamine   or   dimethylamine,   or   especially ammonia,   preferably   at an  elevated  temperature.     Instead  of ammonia   one may   use   an   agent  which  gives   ammonia   as   hexamethylenetetraamine.<br>
Residues  splittable  by  means  of pyrolysis,   especially   residues splittable   from   the   nitrogen   atom,   are   in   occurring   cases   substituted, preferably   unsubstituted,   carbamoyl   groups.      Suitable   substituents   are e.g. loweralkyl, or arylloweralkyl  as methyl  or benzyl or aryl, as phenyl. The pyrolysis is carried out in a common way,  whereby one must take care to avoid pyrolysis  of  other  thermically   susceptible   groups.<br>
Residues   splitable  by   means   of fermentation,   especially  residues splittable  from  the  nitrogen  atom  are  in  occurring  cases substituted, however   preferably   unsubstituted   carbamoyl   groups.   Suitable substituents  are e.g.  loweralkyl  or arylloweralkyl,  as  methyl or benzyl,   or aryl as phenyl. The fermentation is carried out in a common way, e.g.  by means of the enzyme urease or soy bean extract at about 20°C or at a slightly   elevated   temperature.<br>
Depending   on   the  process   conditions   and   the   starting   materials,   the end  product  is  obtained  either  as  the free  base or  as  the  acid  addition   salt, both of which are included within the scope of the invention.    Thus,  basic, neutral or mixed salts may be obtained,  as well as hemi-, mono-, sesqui-, or  polyhydrates.     The  acid  addition  salts  of the  new compounds  may  be transformed  in  a manner known per se  into  free base using basic  agents such as alkali or by ion exchange.    On the other hand, the free bases obtained may form salts with organic or inorganic acids.    In the preparation  of acid  addition  salts  preferably  such  acids  are used  which form  suitable  therapeutically  acceptable  salts.     Such  acids  include hydrohalogen  acids,, sulfuric,  phosphoric,  nitric,  and perchloric   acids; aliphatic,   alicyclic,  aromatic,  heterocyclic carboxy or sulfonic acids, such<br>
20<br><br>
as acetic, formic, propionic,   succinic,   glycolic, lactic, malic,  tartaric, citric, ascorbic,  maleic, hydroxymaleic,   pyruvic,  phenylacetic,   benzoic,   p-aminobenzoic,   anthranilic,  p-hydroxybenzoic,  salicylic or p-aminosalicylic acid,   embonic,   methanesulfonic,   ethane  sulfonic,    hydroxyethanesulphonc, ethylenesulphonic,    halogenbenzenesulphonic,   toluenesulfonic, naphtylsulfonic, or sulfanilic  acids;  methionine, tryptophane, lysine or arginine.<br>
These and other salts of the new compounds, as e.g. picrates,   may serve as purifying agents of the free bases obtained.     Salts of the bases may   be  formed,  separated  from  the  solution,  and  then  the  free  base  can be  recovered from the new salt solution in a purer state. Because of the relationship   between  the  new  compounds  in  free  base  form  and  their salts it  will  be understood  that  the  corresponding  salts  are  included within  the  scope of the  invention.<br>
The starting materials  are known  or may,  if they should  be new,  be obtained   according  to   processes   known  per se.<br>
In   clinical  use  the  compounds   of  the   invention  are  administered   by injection,   transdermally,   topically   or  epidermally  in  the  form  of a pharmaceutical  preparation   which   contains   at   least  one  compound  of  the invention  either as  a free  base  or  as  a pharmaceutically  acceptable,  nontoxic  acid  addition salt,  such  as  for  example  hydrochloride,  lactate, acetate,   sulfamate,   in  combination   with   a  pharmaceutically   acceptable carrier.   Usually  the amount  of active  compound  is  between  0.05  and   10% by  weight  of the  preparation:  between  0.05  and  2.5%  by  weight in preparations  for ocular use,  between  0.5  and   10%  by weight in preparations  for dermal  anesthesia,  between  0.5  and 5%  by  weight in preparations   for  non-ocular  topical   (ex.   oral,   nasal,  rectal,   urethral, vaginal,  etc.) use, between 0.25  and  3% for injections and between 0.1 and 3% for infusions (ex. for epidural,   spinal  or  regional   anesthesia).   In any  case,   the quantity of the drug  to  be administered will  be determined on  an individual basis,  and  will  be  based  on the  pharmacological potency of the  drug,  the route of administration and at least in part on consideration  of the individual"s  size,  the severity  of the symptoms to  be treated  and  the results  sought.     In  general,  quantities of a compound  of the   invention  sufficient  to  eliminate   the  unwanted  condition  will  be administered.     The  actual   dosage   (concentration   and  volume)   and   the number  of  administrations  per  day   will   depend   on   the  pharmacokinetic properties  of the drug  and  the  mode  of drug  administrations,  for example, by topical doses to the eye.<br>
2 1<br><br>
In  the  present method,  the  compounds   of the  invention  can  be administered  topically  to  the  eye,  for  example   as  solutions,  suspensions  or ointments.  The  ophthalmically  compatible  carrier  which  may  be  used  in this  invention  comprises  e.g.  an  aqueous  solution,  such  as  saline  solution, oil   solution   or   ointments   containing   ophthalmically   compatible preservatives,   surfactants,   buffers,   and   agents   such  as  polymers   to increase  the  viscosity.  These  compositions   may   also  contain  stabilizing agents,   antibacterial  agents,   buffering   agents   and  may   be   manufactured   in different  dosage  units,  suitable  for  ocular  administration.     Also  drug inserts,  either  soluble  or insoluble,  may  be   used.<br>
Solutions  for injection  or infusion  may   be  prepared  as  aqueous solutions  of a  water soluble,  pharmaceutically   acceptable  salt  of the  active compound, preferably in a concentration  from  0.1   to  3.0%.       These solutions   may   also   contain   stabilizing   agents,   antibacterial   agents, buffering   agents   and  may  be  manufactured   in   different  dosage   unit ampoules   or   bottles.<br>
Dosage   units  for  rectal  administration   may  be  prepared  in   the  form of ointments  or  suppositories,   which  contain   the  active  substance  in  a mixture  with  a  neutral fat base,  or  they  may  be  prepared  in the  form of gelatin-rectal  capsules  that  contain   the  active   compound   in   a  mixture  with for example a vegetable oil  or paraffin oil.     Ointments,  suppositories or cremes  containing  at least one  of the  compounds  of the  invention  are useful   for   the   treatment  of  hemorrhoids   and   compounds   of  the   invention having   topical   anesthetic   effects   in   combination   with   vasoconstrictor effects   are  particularly  useful  for  the   treatment  of hemorrhoids.<br>
Dosage  forms  for  dermal  anesthesia  may   be  prepared  for example  as a  solution,  ointment or cream.  The  dermal   composition  may  also  contain emulsifiers (e.g.  polyoxyethylene  fatty  acid   esters),   thickening  agents   (e.g. carboxypolymethylene),   pH-adjusting   agents   (e.g.   sodium   hydroxide), preservatives,   penetration   promoting   agents   (e.g.<br>
hydroxypolyethoxydodecane,  DMSO,   DMAC,   etc).  The  dermal  composition may  contain  one  or more  active compounds  and  the compounds  may  be prepared  as  bases  or salts  to  facilitate dermal  penetration.     The composition may  be applied to the skin  under occlusive  dressing or as  a constituent of a  dermal  delivery  system  ("patch"  etc.)<br>
22<br><br><br><br><br>
In   the  method  of the  present invention,  the  compounds  of the invention  can  be  administered  together  with  one  or more  other compound(s).     For  example,  injectable  solutions  may  contain a vasoconstrictor  (e.g.   epinephrine   or  vasopressin);   a  solution  for  infusion or regional  anesthesia may  contain  glucose  or dextrose,  a jelly for urogenital  topical  procedures  may  contain  thickening agents (e.g. hydroxypropylmethylcellulose);   a   preparation   for   topical   or   dermal application   may   contain  penetration   promoting   agents   (e.g. hydroxypolyethoxydodecane,   DMSO,   DMAC);   sprays  for  topical  anesthesia of  the   mouth   and   oropharynx  may   contain   saccharin  and  alcohol, ointments   for  accessible  mucous   membranes   may   contain  a  lubricant. The  compounds  of the  invention  can   also   be  administered  together  with other- membrane  stabilizers   (local   anesthetics),   for  example  to  form eutectic   mixtures.<br>

Aliquots  (0.25  ml)  of test solutions   were  applied  into  the conjunctival sac of conscious rabbits (either sex; 2-4 kg) and the eye-lids were kept closed for approximately  20 sec.  The corneal reflex was checked before  application  of the  test  solution  and  every  5   min  thereafter.  To  test the corneal reflex,  the cornea was  touched six  times with a stalked elastic bristle.  The  duration of anesthesia  was  calculated  as  the period from  the time-point when the animal did not feel any of the six touches by  the bristle to the time point when the animal again reacted to three of the six touches.  To  verify  the reversibility  of the  topical anesthetic effect,  the testing  continued  until  the  animal  reacted  to  all  six  touches  of the  bristle for at least   15  minutes.<br>
B.	Dermal anesthetic activity.<br>
Approximately   18-24  hours  before  each  experiment,   the  skin  on  the back of male guinea pigs was shaved  and depilated with a commercially available  hair remover. The  anesthetic   action  of each  agent following dermal   application  was  determined   using   a   "pin-prick"   method  as described  by  Aberg  (Acta Pharmacol  Toxicol,   1972, JU:  273-286).  Before and at various intervals after treatment,  the area of the skin was tested for<br>
23<br><br><br><br>
the presence or absence of a skin  twitch in response to  six standardized dermal  probings   with   a  pointed  metal   "algesimeter"   at  a  predetermined maximum load of  10 grams. The  average number of probings  not producing  a skin  twitch response  was  designated  as  the  "anesthetic  score". In  this  system six responses  to  six  stimuli  represents  "no  anesthetic activity"   and  no  response  to  six  stimuli  represents  a  "maximal  anesthetic activity".     In  experiments  on the dermal anesthetic activity,  a single area of skin  1  inch square was marked off on the middle of the back of each animal.    This area was covered by a  1   inch square,  16 layer thick gauze pad onto which was deposited 0.45 ml of a  10% solution of the test agent in water with DMSO. The gauze pad was covered with al.5 inch square sheet of Saran Wrap™  which  was  attached  to  the surrounding  skin  with tape.-The  entire   area  was   then   covered  by   wrapping  an   elastic  bandage around   the   trunk  of  the   animal.   After  a  predetermined   duration  of treatment,   the   coverings   were   removed   and   the   skin   assessed  for  the presence  of anesthesia  as   described  above.   Dermal  anesthesia  tests  were performed   at  ten   minute   intervals   to   measure   onset  time   and   duration   of dermal   anesthetic   activity;   comparisons   were   made   with   reference compounds  and  vehicle.  All  test compounds  were  in  the  base  form and dissolved  in  DMSO/water  when   tested  for  dermal  anesthesia.<br>
C. Local   (infiltration)   anesthetic   activity.<br>
Approximately   18-24   hours  before  each  experiment,   the  skin  on   the back of male  guinea pigs  was  shaved  and  depilated  with  a commercially available  hair remover.  The  anesthetic  action  of each  agent following intradermal   injection   was   determined   using   a   "pin-prick"   method   as described  by  Aberg  (Acta  Pharmacol  Toxicol,   1972, JUL:  273-286).  Before and at various intervals after treatment, the area of the skin was tested for the presence or absence of a skin twitch in response to  six  standardized cutaneous   probings   with   a   pointed   metal   "algesimeter"   at  a predetermined   maximum   force   of  20   grams.   The   average   number  of probings  not producing  a  skin  twitch  response  was  designated  as  the "anesthetic  score".  In this  system six  responses  to  six  stimuli represents "no  anesthetic  activity"  and  no response  to  six  stimuli  represents  a "maximal   anesthetic   activity".   In   experiments   with   intradermal   injections of agents,  the backs of the guinea pigs  are divided into  four sections  using a marking pen, and injections of 0.1  ml of 0.25%, 0.5% and  1.0% solutions of the  test  compounds  in  physiological  saline,   vehicle  (physiological<br>
24<br><br>
saline)   and   at  least  one  reference  compounds   were  made,   one  injection into  each  of the four defined areas.<br>
All test compounds were in salt form (usually hydrochlorides) and dissolved   in   physiological   saline   when   tested   for   infiltration   anesthesia.<br>
D.    Acute intravenous toxicity in mice.<br>
Mice (males) of the NMRI strain, weighing 20 to 22 g were used after a stabilization period of at least ten days at the testing facility and at least one hour in  the laboratory. Food but not water had been  withheld from all  animals for  16 hours before the test. The animals were again given free acces-s  to  food  starting  two hours  after the  drug  administration,  that usually  took place around 9.00 AM.     All animals are observed daily for 7 days  post   dosing.<br>
EQUIVALENTS<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more   than   routine   experimentation,   many   equivalents   to   the   specific embodiments   of  the   invention   described   herein.   Thus,   the   piperidine moiety of Formula 2 may be substituted with an azabicyclo   moiety   that may also be attached in ortho,  meta  or  para  positions.  The  compounds  of the  present  invention may be  used  also for other indications,  such  as  for example   to   prevent   or   treat   smooth   muscle   spasms,   cardiac   arrhythmias and hiccup.  The use of a single isomer may have the advantage that side effects  residing  in  the  other  isomer  can  be   avoided.  Thus  nervous  system side  effects,  such  as  for example  effects  on  respiration  and  cardiovascular side effects,  such  as  for example  negative  inotropic  effects,  negative chronotropic   effects   and   negative   dromotropic   effects   may   be   completely or  partially  avoided  by  using  a single  isomer.
