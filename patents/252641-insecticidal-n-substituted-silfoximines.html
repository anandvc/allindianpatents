				<td>INSECTICIDAL N-SUBSTITUTED SULFOXIMINES<br>
The present invention concerns novel N-substituted sulfoximines and their<br>
use in controlling insects, particularly aphids. This invention also includes new<br>
synthetic procedures for preparing the compounds, pesticide compositions<br>
containing the compounds, and methods of controlling insects using the<br>
compounds.<br>
There is an acute need for new insecticides. Insects are developing<br>
resistance to the insecticides in current use. At least 400 species of arthropods are<br>
resistant to one or more insecticides. The development of resistance to some of<br>
the older insecticides, such as DDT, the carbamates, and the organophosphates, is<br>
well known. But resistance has even developed to some of the newer pyrethroid<br>
insecticides. Therefore a need exists for new insecticides, and particularly for<br>
compounds that have new or atypical modes of action.<br>
This invention concerns compounds useful for the control of insects,<br>
especially useful for the control of aphids and other sucking insects. More<br>
specifically, the invention concerns compounds of the formula (I)<br>
wherein<br>
X represents NO2, CN or COOR4;<br>
L represents a single bond or R1, S and L taken together represent a 5- or<br>
6-membered ring;<br>
R1 represents methyl or ethyl;<br>

or bromo;<br>
n is an integer from 0-3;<br>
Y represents 6-halopyridin-3-yl, 6-(C1-C4)alkylpyridin-3-yl, 6-(C1-<br>
C4)alkoxypyridin-3-yl, 2-chloromiazol-4-yl, or 3-chloroisoxazol-5-yl when n = 0-<br>
3 and L represents a single bond, or Y represents hydrogen, Ci-C4 alkyl, phenyl,<br>
6-halopyridin-3-yl, 6-(Ci-C4)alkylpyridin-3-yl, 6-(Ci-C4)alkoxypyridin-3-yl, 2-<br>
chlorothiazol-4-yl, or 3-chloroisoxazol-5-yl when n = 0-1 and R1, S and L taken<br>
together represent a 5- or 6-membered ring; and<br>
R4 represents C1-C3 alkyl.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (I) include the following classes:<br>
(1) Compounds of formula (I) wherein X is NO2 or CN, most<br>
preferably CN.<br>
(2) Compounds of formula (I) wherein R1, S and L taken together form<br>
a standard 5-membered ring, n=l, and Y represents 6-chloropyridin-3-yl, i.e.,<br>
having the structure<br>
 (3) Compounds of formula (I) wherein R1,S and L taken together<br>
form a standard 5-membered ring and n = 0, i.e., having the structure<br>
O. /<br>
(4) Compounds of formula (I) wherein Rl represents CHs, L<br>
represents a single bond and Y represents 6-chloropyridin-3-yl, i.e., having the<br>
structure<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the most preferred<br>
compounds are generally those which are comprised of combinations of the above<br>
preferred classes.<br>
The invention also provides new processes for preparing compounds of<br>
formula (I) as well as new compositions and methods of use, which will be<br>
described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Throughout this document, all temperatures are given in degrees Celsius,<br>
and all percentages are weight percentages unless otherwise stated.<br>
Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term alkyl (including derivative<br>
terms such as alkoxy) as used herein include straight chain, branched chain, and<br>
cyclic groups. Thus, typical alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, 1-methylethyl, propyl,<br>
1,1-dimethylethyl, and cyclopropyl. The term halogen includes fluorine, chlorine,<br>
bromine, and iodine.<br>
The compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers.<br>
The various stereoisomers include geometric isomers, diastereomers and<br>
enantiomers. Thus the compounds of the present invention include racemic<br>
mixtures, individual stereoisomers and optically active mixtures. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that one stereoisomer may be more active<br>
than the others. Individual stereoisomers and optically active mixtures may be<br>
obtained by selective synthetic procedures, by conventional synthetic procedures<br>
using resolved starting materials or by conventional resolution procedures.<br>
The compounds of formula (la), wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X, and Y are as<br>
previously defined and L is a single bond, can be prepared by the methods<br>
illustrated in Scheme A:<br>
Scheme A<br>
In step a of Scheme A, sulfide of formula (A) is oxidized with metachloroperoxybenzoic<br>
acid (mCPBA) in a polar solvent below 0 °C to provide<br>
sulfoxide of formula (B). hi most cases, dichloromethane is the preferred solvent<br>
for oxidation.<br>
In step b of Scheme A, sulfoxide (B) is iminated with sodium azide in the<br>
presence of concentrated sulfuric acid in an aprotic solvent under heating to<br>
provide sulfoximine of formula (C). In most cases, chloroform is the preferred<br>
solvent for this reaction.<br>
In step c of Scheme A, the nitrogen of sulfoximine (C) can be either<br>
cyanated with cyanogen bromide in the presence of a base, or nitrated with nitric<br>
acid in the presence of acetic anhydride under mildly elevated temperature, or<br>
carboxylated with alkyl (R4) chloro formate in the presence of base such as 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to provide ./V-substituted sulfoximine (la). Base<br>
is required for efficient cyanation and carboxylation and the preferred base is<br>
DMAP, whereas sulfuric acid is used as catalyst for efficient nitration reaction.<br>
The compounds of formula (la), wherein X represents CN and R1, R2, R3,<br>
R4 and Y are as previously defined, can be prepared by the mild and efficient<br>
method illustrated in Scheme B.<br>
Scheme B<br>
In step a of Scheme B, sulfide is oxidized with iodobenzene diacetate in<br>
the presence of cyanamide at 0 C to give sulfilimine (F). The reaction can be<br>
earned out in a polar aprotic solvent li<br>
In step b of Scheme B, the sulfilimine (F) is oxidized with wCPBA. A<br>
base such as potassium carbonate is employed to neutralize the acidity of raCPBA.<br>
Protic polar solvents such as ethanol and water are used to increase the solubility<br>
of the sulfilimine starting material and the base employed.<br>
The a-carbon of the TV-substituted sulfoximine of formula (la), i.e., n=l, R3<br>
= H in the (CR2R3) group adjacent to the //-substituted sulfoximine function can<br>
be further alkylated or halogenated (R5) in the presence of a base such as<br>
potassium hexamethyldisilamide (KHMDS) to give /V-substituted sulfoximines of<br>
formula (Ib), wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X, L and Y are as previously defined and Z<br>
is an appropriate leaving group, as illustrated in Scheme C. The preferred leaving<br>
groups are iodide (R5 = alkyl), benzenesulfonimide (R5 = F), tetrachloroethene (R5<br>
= Cl), and tetrafluoroethene (R5 = Br).<br>
The starting sulfides (A) in Scheme A can be prepared in different ways as<br>
illustrated in Schemes D, E, F G and H.<br>
In Scheme D, the sulfide of formula (Ai), wherein R1, R2 and Y are as<br>
previously defined and R3 = H, can be prepared from the chloride of formula (Di)<br>
by nucleophilic substitution with the sodium salt of an alkyl thiol.<br>
In Scheme E, the sulfide of formula (A2), wherein R1, R2 and Y are as<br>
previously defined and R3 = H, can be prepared from the chloride of formula (D?)<br>
by reacting with a 2-mono substituted methyl malonate in the presence of base<br>
such as potassium te?-/-butoxide to provide 2,2-disubstitued malonate, hydrolysis<br>
under basic conditions to form a diacid, decarboxylation of the diacid by heating<br>
to give a monoacid, reduction of the monoacid with borane-tetrahyrofuran<br>
complex to provide an alcohol, tosylation of the alcohol with toluenesulfonyl<br>
chloride (tosyl chloride) in the presence of a base like pyridine to give a tosylate<br>
and replacement of the tosylate with the sodium salt of the desired thiol.<br>
m Scheme F, the sulfide of formula (A3), wherein R1, R2 and Y are as<br>
previously defined and R3 = H, can be prepared from the nitrile of formula (E) by<br>
deprotonation with a strong base and alkylation with an alkyl iodide to give ct-<br>
-7-<br>
alkylated nitrile, hydrolysis of the a-alkylated nitrile in the presence of a strong<br>
acid like HC1 to give an acid, reduction of the acid with borane-tetrahyrofuran<br>
complex to provide an alcohol, tosylation of the alcohol with tosyl chloride in the<br>
presence of a base like pyridine to give a tosylate and replacement of the tosylate<br>
with the sodium salt of the desired thiol.<br>
In Scheme G, the sulfide of formula (A/0, wherein R1, S and L taken<br>
together form a ring, n = 0, Y = isopropyl or phenyl can be prepared from the<br>
unsubstituted cyclic sulfide wherein m = 0,1. Chlorination of the cyclic sulfide<br>
starting material with 7V-chlorosuccinimide in benzene followed by alkylation with<br>
Grignard reagent can lead to the desired sulfide (A4) in satisfactory yield.<br>
In Scheme H, the sulfide of formula (As), wherein R1 is previously<br>
defined, L is a bond, n is 0 and Y is 6-chloropyridin-3-yl can be prepared from 2-<br>
chloro-5-bromopyridine with a halo-metal exchange followed by a substitution<br>
with disulfide.<br>
Sulfoximine compounds wherein R , S and L taken together form a<br>
saturated 5- or 6-membered ring can also be prepared by the methods illustrated in<br>
Scheme I wherein X and Y are as previously defined and m is 0 or 1.<br>
In step a of Scheme I, which is similar to step b of Scheme A, sulfoxide is<br>
iminated with sodium azide in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid or with<br>
0-mesitylsulfonylhydroxylamine in a polar aprotic solvent to provide<br>
sulfoximine. Chloroform or dichloromethane are the preferred solvents.<br>
In step b of Scheme I, similar to step c of Scheme A, the nitrogen of<br>
sulfoximine can be either cyanated with cyanogen bromide, or nitrated with nitric<br>
acid followed by treatment with acetic anhydride under refluxing conditions, or<br>
carboxylated with methyl chloroformate in the presence of base such as DMAP to<br>
provide jV-substitued cyclic sulfoximine. Base is required for efficient cyanation<br>
and carboxylation and the preferred base is DMAP, whereas sulfuric acid is used<br>
as catalyst for efficient nitration reaction.<br>
In step c of Scheme I, the a-carbon of //-substituted sulfoximine can be<br>
alkylated with a heteroaromatic methyl halide in the presence of a base such as<br>
KHMDS or butyl lithium (BuLi) to give the desired JV-substituted sulfoximines.<br>
The preferred halide can be bromide, chloride or iodide.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula (Ib) can be prepared by a first ctalkylation<br>
of sulfoxides to give a-substituted sulfoxides and then an imination of<br>
the sulfoxide followed by ^-substitution of the resulting sulfoximine by using the<br>
steps c , a and b respectively as described above for Scheme I.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples I-X Preparation of TV-substituted sulfoximines<br>
Example I. [3-(6-Chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methvlpropyl](methyl)oxido-^4-<br>

To a stirred solution of potassium /er/-butoxide (4.49 g, 40 mmol) in<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF, 100 mL) was added dimethyl methylmalonate (6.43 g, 44<br>
mmol) dropwise at room temperature. After 10 min, 3-chloromethyl-6-<br>
chloropyridine (6.48 g, 40 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred<br>
at room temperature overnight. The mixture was poured into water (400 mL) and<br>
then extracted with ether (2 x 150 mL). The organic fractions were combined,<br>
washed with brine (100 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO.4. The solvent was<br>
evaporated to give a yellow oil, which was triturated with boiling hexane (2 x 100<br>
mL) with the hexane being decanted from insoluble oil. The hexane fractions<br>
were combined and cooled to give 6.3 g of the desired malonate derivative as a<br>
white solid in 58% yield: m.p. 80-81 °C.<br>
B) 2-[(6-Chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]-2-methylmalonic acid<br>
To a stirred solution of dimethyl 2-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]-2-<br>
methylmalonate (10.85 g, 40 mmol) in THF (80 mL) was added a solution of<br>
lithium hydroxide monohydrate (5.7 g, 0.136 mol) in water (43 mL). The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then poured into<br>
water (300 mL). The pH was adjusted to less than 2 by the addition of<br>
concentrated HC1. The resulting mixture was extracted with ether (3 x 100 mL)<br>
and the ether extracts were combined, washed with brine (100 mL) and dried over<br>
anhydrous MgSO4. After a filtration, the solvent was evaporated to give 9.26 g of<br>
the product as a white solid in 95% yield: m.p. 168 C (decomp.).<br>
C) 3-(6-Chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid<br>
,CO,H<br>
The solid 2-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]-2-methylmalomc acid (8.70 g,<br>
37.5 mmol) in a 500 mL round bottom flask was immersed in an oil bath heated to<br>
185 °C. As the solid melted carbon dioxide evolution occurred. After heating for<br>
30 min, the reaction was deemed complete. Upon cooling there was obtained an<br>
amber gum (6.8 g, 95% yield). [M+H]+ - 200, 202; IR: 1703 (C=O). The product<br>
was about 85% pure and was used for the next step reaction directly.<br>
D) 3-(6-Chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropan-1 -ol<br>
N'<br>
To a stirred solution of 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropanoic acid<br>
(6.5 g, 32.6 mmol) in THF (75 mL) cooled in an ice-water bath was added a<br>
solution of 1 M borane in THF (48 mL, 48 mmol) in a rapid dropwise fashion.<br>
The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. Water (25 mL) was added<br>
carefully followed by 2 N NaOH solution. The two phases were separated and the<br>
aqueous phase washed with ether (100 mL). The organic phases were combined,<br>
dried over anhydrous MgSC4, filtered, and concentrated to give 4.2 g of the<br>
product as a nearly colorless oil in 69% crude yield. [M+H]+ = 186,188; IR: 3414<br>
(OH)<br>
E)3-(6-Chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate<br>
To a stirred solution of 3-(6-cUoropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropan-l-ol (4.0<br>
g, 21.5 mmol) and pyridine (3.40 g, 43 nimol) in CHC13 (30 mL) cooled below 5<br>
°C in an ice-water bath was added-toluenesulfonyl chloride (6.16 g, 32.3 mmol)<br>
in one portion. After 20 min, the ice-water bath was removed and the mixture was<br>
continued to stir at room temperature overnight. The solution was then diluted<br>
with CH2C12 (30 mL), washed with 1 N HC1 (50 mL), water (50 mL), brine (50<br>
mL), and dried over anhydrous MgSO,. The solvent was filtered and evaporated<br>
to give 9.0 g of the crude product as a yellow oil, which was purified on silica gel<br>
using 15% acetone in hexane (v/v) as eluent to give 5.45 g of the desired tosylate<br>
product as a colorless oil in 74.6% yield. [M+H]+ - 340, 342; IR: 1177 (S=O).<br>
F)2-Chloro-5-[2-methyl-3-(methylthio)propyl]pyridine<br>
A solution 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropyl-4-methylbenzenesulfonate<br>
(5.0 g, 14.7 mmol) and sodium methylthiolate (2.10 g, 30 mmol)<br>
in THF (50 mL) was stirred overnight at room temperature. The remaining<br>
unreacted starting material indicated on TLC was converted into the product<br>
completely after the solution was heated at 55 °C for 4 more hours. The mixture<br>
was diluted with ether and washed with 2 N NaOH solution (50 mL). The<br>
aqueous phase was washed with ether (50 mL). The combined organic phase was<br>
washed with brine (50 mL), dried over MgSCU, filtered and concentrated to give<br>
2.94 g of the desired crude sulfide in 93% yield as a yellowish oil: M = 215, 217;<br>
5 2.07 (s, 3H), 0.95 (d, 3H).<br>
G) 2-CliIoro-5-[2-methyl-3-(methylsulfinyl)propyl]pyridine<br>
To a stirred solution of 2-chloro-5-[2-methyl-3-(methylthio)propyl]-<br>
pyridine (2.60 g, 12.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (35 mL) cooled to -15 °C in an ice-salt<br>
bath was added m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (/7/CPBA, -85%, 2.54 g, -12.5<br>
mmol) portion wise at such a rate that the temperature never rose above -10 C.<br>
After the addition was over, TLC showed that a single product plus a small<br>
amount of starting material was present in the solution. To avoid any sulfone<br>
formation, the reaction was quenched at this point by the addition of saturated<br>
NaHCOs (50 mL). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous phase<br>
washed with CHaCla (25 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over<br>
MgSO4 and the solvent was evaporated to give 2.66 g of crude product as a yellow<br>
oil. The oil was triturated with hot hexane (50 mL) and the hexane decanted after<br>
cooling. This procedure removed .most of the starting material and the resulting<br>
product (a mixture of two diastereomers) was directly used for the following step<br>
without further purification. [M+H]+ = 232, 234; 5 1.09 (overlapping d, 3H),<br>
2.57,2.59 (2 s, 3H).<br>
H)2-Chloro-5-[2-methyl-3-(methylsulfonimidoyl)propyl]pyridine<br>
To a stirred mixture of 2-chloro-5-[2-methyl-3-(methylsulfmyl)propyl]-<br>
pyridine (2.15 g, 9.3 mmol) and sodium azide (1.81 g, 28 mmol) in chloroform<br>
(30 mL) cooled in an ice-water bath was added concentrated H2S04 (6 mL) and<br>
the resulting mixture stirred at this temperature for 10 min. The reaction was then<br>
heated at 55 °C in an oil-bath for 16 hrs. Upon cooling down, the mixture was<br>
diluted with ice-water (70 mL) and the organic layer removed. The aqueous phase<br>
was washed with CH2C12 (2 x 30 mL) and the organic phase was discarded. The<br>
aqueous phase was made basic by the careful addition of aqueous ammonia<br>
whereupon an oil separated, which was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 x 30 mL). The<br>
combined organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and solvent evaporated to give<br>
2.15 g of the product as a yellowish oil in 94% yield. [M+H]+ = 247, 249; 81.11<br>
(overlapping d, 3H).<br>
I) [3-(6-Chloropyridin-3-yl)-2-methylpropyl](methyl)oxido- X4-<br>
sulfanylidenecyanamide (2)<br>
To a stirred solution of 2-chloro-5-[2-methyl-3-(methylsulfonimidoyl)-<br>
propyljpyridine (0.432 g, 1.75 mmol) and DMAP (0.24 g, 2 mmol) in CH2C12 (10<br>
mL) was added a 3 M cyanogen bromide solution in CH2Cl2 (1.2 mL, 3.5 mmol)<br>
in one portion. There was an immediate exothermic reaction accompanied by gas<br>
evolution. After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, TLC showed that all of<br>
the starting material had been consumed and replaced by a single product. The<br>
reaction mixture was added to the top of a small pad of silica gel and then washed<br>
effusing 7:3 hexane-acetone (v/v). Removal of the solvent gave 0.39 g of the<br>
desired TV-cyanosulfoximine (2) as a colorless oil in 82% yield. [M+H]"1" = 272,<br>

Propyl pyridine (0.432 g, 1.75 mmol) (Example I-H) in CH2C12 (10 mL) cooled in<br>
an ice-water bath was added 98% HNO3 (0.11 g, 1.75 mmol). The nitrate salt of<br>
sulfoximine separated from the solution. To this mixture was added acetic<br>
anhydride (4 mL) and a catalytic amount of concentrated HaSC^ (3 drops). The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred at 0 C for a few minutes and then heated under<br>
reflux for 1 h. During this period, the reaction mixture became homogeneous. To<br>
the resulting solution was added additional CHiCla (20 mL) followed by 1 N<br>
NaOH (75 mL) and the stirring was continued to quench the acetic anhydride.<br>
The organic layer was then separated and the aqueous layer was washed with<br>
CH2C12 (80 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and solvent<br>
evaporated to give 0.49 g of product (3) (yellow oil) as a 1:1 mixture of<br>

Tween 20 (in H2O) to make 200 and 50 ppm spray solutions. A hand-held<br>
Devilbiss sprayer was used to apply the spray solutions until runoff to both sides<br>
of the squash cotyledon leaves. Four plants (4 replications) were used for each<br>
concentration of each compound. Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed<br>
with 0.025% Tween 20 only. Treated plants were held in a holding room for 3<br>
days at approximately 23 °C and 40% RH before the number of live aphids on<br>
each plant was recorded. Insecticidal activity was measured by Corrected %<br>
Control using Abbott's correction formula and presented in Table 2:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100  (X - Y) / X<br>
where X = No. of live aphids on solvent check plants<br>
Y = No. of live aphids on treated plants<br>
Compounds that showed high activity (high Corrected % Control) from the<br>
above basic screening were further assayed in rundown assays using the same<br>
procedures with 0.012, 0.049, 0.195, 0.78, 3.13,12.5 and/or 50 ppm as test doses.<br>
The Corrected % Control values from these mndown assays are given in Table 3.<br>
Insecticidal test for green peach aphid (Myzitspcrsicae).<br>
Cabbage seedlings grown in 3-inch pots, with 2-3 small (3-5 cm) true<br>
Leaves, were used as test substrate. The seedlings were infested with 20-50 green<br>
peach apbids (wingless adult and nymph) 2-3 days prior to chemical application.<br>
Four seedlings were used for each treatment. Five milligrams of test compounds<br>
were dissolved in 5 mL of acetone : methanol (50 : 50) solvent. The solutions<br>
were then diluted with 0.025% Tween 20 (in H2O) to make 0.012, 0.049, 0.195,<br>
0.78, 3.13, 12.5 and/or 50 ppm spray solutions. A hand-held Devilbiss sprayer<br>
was used for spraying a solution to both sides of cabbage leaves until runoff.<br>
Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with 0.025% Tween 20 only.<br>
Treated plants were held in a holding room for three days at approximately 23 °C<br>
and 40% RH prior to grading. Evaluation was conducted by counting the number<br>
of live aphids per plant under a microscope. Insecticidal activity was measured<br>
by using Abbott's correction formula:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100  (X - Y) / X<br>
where X = No. of live aphids on solvent check plants<br>
Y = No. of live aphids on treated plants<br>
The Corrected % Control values from these rundown assays are given in Table 4.<br>
Insecticidal test for corn earworm (Helicoverpa zed] and beet armyworm<br>
(Spodoptera exigua) in dietary assays.<br>
Dietary assays were conducted in 128-well plastic trays. To prepare test<br>
solution, the test compound was formulated at 2000 ppm in 2 mL of acetone :<br>
water (9 : 1). A volume of 50 |il of the test solutions was pipetted upon the<br>
surface of 1 mL of lepidopteran diet (Southland Multi-Species Lepidopteran Diet)<br>
in each well of 128-well plastic trays. Eight wells (8 replications) were used for<br>
each treatment on each insect species. This application rate was equivalent to 50<br>
 (ig/cm . A second-instar corn earworm or beet armyworm larva was placed upon<br>
the treated diet in each well once the solvent had been air-dried. Trays containing<br>
the treated diet and larvae were covered with self-adhesive transparent sheets and<br>
held in a growth chamber at 25 °C, 50-55% RH, and 16 h light: 8 h dark<br>
Observation were conducted 5 days after treatment and infestation. The number of<br>
dead insects is converted to % mortality that is given in Table 2.<br>
% Mortality =100 * X /Y<br>
where X = No. of dead insects<br>
Y = Total No. of insects tested (= 8)<br>
Insecticidal test for beet armyworm (Spodoptera exisua) in injection assays.<br>
Test solutions were prepared by dissolving 2 mg of tech grade compound<br>
in 100 jil of dimethyl sulfoxide or acetone. Each 4th instar beet armyworm larva<br>
was injected with 0.5 \il (10 jig of test compound per larva) solution using a<br>
Hamilton 10 ul 33 !/2 gauge syringe. The test solution was injected into the<br>
abdomen of a larva, just underneath the cuticle and with the long axis of the<br>
syringe needle parallel to the long axis of the insect's body. A solvent blank and<br>
an untreated plate were included to each test to ensure validity. Six larvae were<br>
used for each treatment. Injected larvae were individually placed in the wells of<br>
6-well polystyrene plates with a small amount of lepidopteran diet (Southland<br>
Multi-Species Lepidopteran Diet). Plates were held at room temperature in the<br>
lab and were graded at 1, 24, and 48 h. Intoxicated symptoms were observed at<br>
each time point. The number of larvae showing symptoms was converted to %<br>
Show Symptoms.<br>
% Show Symptoms - 100  X / Y<br>
where X = No. of larvae showing symptoms<br>
Y - Total No. of larvae tested (= 6)<br>
The results (% Show Symptom) from the 1 h observation are presented in Table 2.<br>
Insecticidal test for fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster}.<br>
Polystyrene plates with 24 wells were filled with approximately 300 \i\ of<br>
an agar solution containing 20 g of agar in 1000 mL of 10% sucrose solution.<br>
Green or yellow food coloring was added to the agar solution as the color will be<br>
visible in the abdomen of the fly when ingested (providing an indication of<br>
ingestion observation). Prior to treatment, 1.5-cm filter paper disks were<br>
individually placed on the top of the solidified agar layer in the wells. Test<br>
solutions were prepared by adding 500 jul of acetone : water (2:1) solvent to 2<br>
mg of tech grade compounds, then adding an additional 500 |il of 10% sucrose<br>
solution to provide final concentration of 2000 ppm. For the solvent blank, 500 JLL!<br>
of acetone : water (2:1) solvent was added to 500 jul of 10% sucrose solution. A<br>
volume of 25 |il of the formulated 2000 ppm solution was pipetted onto the filter<br>
paper in each well (equivalent to 25 |U,g / cm2). Four wells (4 replications) were<br>
used for each compound. Plates were then placed in a fume hood for 30-45<br>
minutes to allow solvent to evaporate. Test flies were placed in a refrigerator for<br>
10-15 minutes and transferred onto a glass dish that was kept on ice. Chilled flies<br>
were transferred to the treated plates with a camel's hair brush. On average, 5-8<br>
flies were used for each well. The plates were covered with lids immediately<br>
after the infestation and held at room temperature in the laboratory. Observation<br>
for intoxicated symptoms was conducted at 4 h and % mortality was recorded at<br>
48 h. The number of flies showing symptoms was converted to % Show<br>
Symptoms and the number of dead flies was converted to % Mortality.<br>
% Show Symptoms = 100 X / Y<br>
where X = No. of flies showing symptoms<br>
Y = Total No. of flies tested<br>
% Mortality =100 X /Y<br>
where X = No. of dead flies<br>
Y = Total No. of flies tested<br>
Results are presented in Table 2.<br>
Insecticidal test for mosquito (Aedes aegypti}.<br>
This test was designed to evaluate the insecticidal activity of compounds<br>
against yellow fever mosquito larvae through contact and ingestion. Micro-titer<br>
plates with 96 wells were treated with formulated compounds in dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide at 4000 ppm concentration. A Tomtec robotic system was used to<br>
dispense 1.5 |J,1 of each formulated experimental solution into each well of the<br>
plates. Each compound was applied to 6 wells (6 replications). Subsequent to<br>
application, mosquito larvae (3 hours old following hatch) were suspended in<br>
water containing 0.4 % mosquito diet (brewers yeast: liver powder = 1:3) and<br>
transferred to the wells. A Labsystems Multidrop robotic system was used to<br>
dispense aliquots of 230 |il of this aqueous solution with 5-8 mosquito larvae into<br>
each well of the treated plates. The final test concentration was approximately 26<br>
ppm. After infestation, the plates were covered with a matching clear plastic lid<br>
that allows moisture to escape. Infested plates were held in an incubator at 22 C<br>
for 72 h before they were examined under a microscope. Insecticidal activity was<br>
recorded for each replication as 100% control (all dead) or 0 % control (no effect).<br>
Results are presented in Table 2.<br>
Insecticidal test for sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci).<br>
This test was designed to measure the capability of whitefly eggs and/or<br>
young nymphs to develop to large nymphs. Cotton seedlings at the growth stage<br>
of one or two expanding true leaf were trimmed so that only the first true leaf<br>
remained (cotyledon leaves were also removed). The plants were pre-infested<br>
with sweet potato whitefly eggs by keeping plants next to the colony-keeping<br>
plants for two or three days. The infested plants were carefully checked for<br>
presence of similar egg density before use in the insecticidal tests. Master<br>
solutions of test compounds at 2000 ppm were prepared in acetone : water (9 : 1).<br>
The 200 ppm spray solutions were then made by diluting 1 mL of the master<br>
solution with 9 mL of 0.025% Tween 20 (in water). The test solutions were<br>
sprayed with a hand-held Devilbiss sprayer until runoff to both sides of the<br>
infested cotton leaves. Four plants (4 replications) were used for each compound.<br>
Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with 0.025% Tween 20 containing<br>
9% acetone. Treated plants were held in a holding room for 13 or 14 days at<br>
approximately 23 °C and 40% RH before evaluation. To evaluate the efficacy of<br>
the compounds, the number of live large nymphs in an area of 1 square inch on<br>
the lower surface of the treated cotton leaves was counted under a microscope.<br>
Insecticidal activity is determined by Corrected % Control using Abbott's<br>
correction formula and presented in Table 2:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100* (X - Y) / X<br>
where X = No. of live large nymphs on solvent check plants<br>
Y = No. of live large nymphs on treated plants<br>
Compounds that showed high activity (high Corrected % Control) from the<br>
above basic screening were further tested in rundown assays using the same<br>
procedures with test doses ranging from 0.4 ppm to 50 ppm. The Corrected %<br>
Control values from these rundown assays are given in Table 5.<br>
Insecticidal test for Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineatd).<br>
Tomato seedlings at the growth stage of three or four expanding leaves<br>
were used. Master solutions of test compounds at 2000 ppm were prepared in<br>
acetone : water (9 : 1). The 50 ppm spray solutions were made by diluting 0.5 mL<br>
of the master solution with 18.5 mL of 0.025% Tween 20 (in water). The test<br>
solutions were sprayed with a hand-held Devilbiss sprayer until runoff to all<br>
surfaces of the plants. Four plants (4 replications) were used for each treatment.<br>
Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with 0.025% Tween 20 containing<br>
2.25% acetone. Treated plants were held in the laboratory for approximately 3 h<br>
to allow drying before the upper portion (with two or three leaves) of a plant was<br>
cut and placed in a 10 X 2.5-cm petri dish containing approximately 10 mL of<br>
solidified 1% agar at the bottom. Five 2nd or 3rd instar larvae were placed on the<br>
treated plant tissue, and the petri dishes were covered and held in an incubator at<br>
25 C. At 5 days following treatment, insecticidal activity was evaluated by<br>
counting the number of live larvae in each dish. Corrected % Control is<br>
calculated using Abbott's correction formula and presented in Table 2:<br>
Corrected % Control = 100  (X - Y) / X<br>
where X = No. of live larvae on solvent check plants<br>
Y = No. of live larvae on treated plants<br>
Compounds that showed high activity (high Corrected % Control) from the<br>
above basic screening were further tested in rundown assays using the same<br>
procedures with test doses ranging from 0.78 ppm to 50 ppm. The Corrected %<br>
Control values from these rundown assays are given in Table 6.<br>
Insecticide Utility<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful for the control of insects.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also is directed to a method for inhibiting an<br>
insect which comprises applying to a locus of the insect an insect-inhibiting<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The "locus" of insects is a term used herein to refer to the environment in<br>
which the insects live or where their eggs are present, including the air<br>
surrounding mem, the food they eat, or objects which they contact. For example,<br>
insects which eat or contact edible or ornamental plants can be controlled by<br>
applying the active compound to plant parts such as the seed, seedling, or cutting<br>
which is planted, the leaves, stems, fruits, grain, or roots, or to the soil in which<br>
the roots are growing. It is contemplated that the compounds might also be useful<br>
to protect textiles, paper, stored grain, seeds, domesticated animals, buildings or<br>
human beings by applying an active compound to or near such objects. The term<br>
"inhibiting an insect" refers to a decrease in the numbers of living insects, or a<br>
decrease in the number of viable insect eggs. The extent of reduction<br>
accomplished by a compound depends, of course, upon the application rate of the<br>
compound, the particular compound used, and the target insect species. At least<br>
an inactivating amount should be used. The terms "insect-inactivating amount"<br>
are used to describe the amount, which is sufficient to cause a measurable<br>
reduction in the treated insect population. Generally an amount in the range from<br>
about 1 to about 1000 ppm by weight active compound is used. For example,<br>
insects which can be inhibited include, but are not limited to:<br>

Compositions<br>
The compounds of this invention are applied in the form of compositions<br>
which are important embodiments of the invention, and which comprise a<br>
compound of this invention and a phytologically-acceptable inert carrier. The<br>
compositions are either concentrated formulations which are dispersed in water<br>
for application, or are dust or granular formulations which are applied without<br>
further treatment. The compositions are prepared according to procedures and<br>
formulae which are conventional in the agricultural chemical art, but which are<br>
novel and important because of the presence therein of the compounds of this<br>
invention. Some description of the formulation of the compositions will be given,<br>
however, to assure that agricultural chemists can readily prepare any desired<br>
composition.<br>
The dispersions in which the compounds are applied are most often<br>
aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of the<br>
compounds. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable or emulsifiable formulations<br>
are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, or liquids usually blown as<br>
emulsifiable concentrates or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may<br>
be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of<br>
the active compound, an inert carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the<br>
active compound is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The inert<br>
carrier is usually chosen from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite<br>
clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants,<br>
comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found<br>
among the sulfonated lignins, the condensed naphthalenesulfonates, the<br>
naphthalenesulfonates, the alkylbenzenesulfonates, the alkyl sulfates, and<br>
nonionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates of the compounds comprise a convenient<br>
concentration of a compound, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter<br>
of liquid, equivalent to about 10% to about 50%, dissolved in an inert carrier<br>
which is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic<br>
solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially the<br>
xylenes, and the petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and<br>
olefmic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic<br>
solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin<br>
derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such<br>
as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are chosen<br>
from conventional nonionic surfactants, such as those discussed above.<br>
Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble compounds<br>
of this invention, dispersed in an aqueous vehicle at a concentration in the range<br>
from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely<br>
grinding the compound, and vigorously mixing it into a vehicle comprised of<br>
water and surfactants chosen from the same types discussed above. Inert<br>
ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums, may also be<br>
added, to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous vehicle. It is often<br>
most effective to grind and mix the compound at the same time by preparing the<br>
aqueous mixture, and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball<br>
mill, or piston-type homogenizer.<br>
The compounds may also be applied as granular compositions, which are<br>
particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually<br>
contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the compound, dispersed in<br>
an inert carrier which consists entirely or in large part of clay or a similar<br>
inexpensive substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the<br>
compound in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier which has<br>
been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 to<br>
3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of<br>
the carrier and compound and crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular<br>
particle size.<br>
Dusts containing the compounds are prepared simply by intimately mixing<br>
the compound in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as<br>
kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from<br>
about 1% to about 10% of the compound.<br>
It is equally practical, when desirable for any reason, to apply the<br>
compound in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually a<br>
bland petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural<br>
chemistry.<br>
Insecticides and acaricides are generally applied in the form of a<br>
dispersion of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier. It is conventional to refer to<br>
application rates in terms of the concentration of active ingredient in the earner.<br>
The most widely used earner is water.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be applied in the form of an<br>
aerosol composition. In such compositions the active compound is dissolved or<br>
dispersed in an inert carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture.<br>
The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is<br>
dispensed through an atomizing valve. Propellant mixtures comprise either lowboiling<br>
halocarbons, which may be mixed with organic solvents, or aqueous<br>
suspensions pressurized with inert gases or gaseous hydrocarbons.<br>
The actual amount of compound to be applied to loci of insects and mites<br>
is not critical and can readily be determined by those skilled in the art in view of<br>
the examples above. In general, concentrations from 10 ppm to 5000 ppm by<br>
weight of compound are expected to provide good control. With many of the<br>
compounds, concentrations from 100 to 1500 ppm will suffice.<br>
The locus to which a compound is applied can be an)' locus inhabited by<br>
an insect or mite, for example, vegetable crops, fruit and nut trees, grape vines,<br>
ornamental plants, domesticated animals, the interior or exterior surfaces of<br>
buildings, and the soil around buildings.<br>
Because of the unique ability of insect eggs to resist toxicant action,<br>
repeated applications may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae, as is tme<br>
of other known insecticides and acaricides.<br>
The compounds of the present invention (Formula I) are often applied in<br>
conjunction with one or more other insecticides or fungicides to obtain control of<br>
a wider variety of pests and diseases. When used in conjunction with other<br>
nsecticides or fungicides, the presently claimed compounds can be formulated<br>
with the other insecticides or fungicides, tank mixed with the other insecticides or<br>
fungicides, or applied sequentially with the other insecticides or fungicides.<br>

as allosamidin and thuringiensin; macrocyclic lactone insecticides such as<br>
spinosad; avermectin insecticides such as abamectin, doramectin, emamectin,<br>
