THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
WO 2004/009583<br><br>
PCT/US2003/022419<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to improved prodrugs of proton pump inhibitors which are useful as anti-ulcer agents. More particularly, the present invention is directed to prodrugs that slowly hydrolyze to provide benzimidazole-type proton pump inhibitors which inhibit exogenously or endogenously gastric acid secretion, have improved solubility in physiological fluids and can be used in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases in mammals, including humans. Brief Description of the Prior Art<br>
Benzimidazole derivatives intended for inhibiting gastric acid secretion are disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 4,045,563; 4,255,431; 4,628,098; 4,686,230; 4,758,579; 4,965,269; 5,021,433; 5,430,042, 5,708,017, 6,093,734 and 6,599,167. Generally speaking, the benzimidazole-type inhibitors of gastric acid secretion work by undergoing a rearrangement to form a thiophilic species which then covalently binds to gastric H,K-ATPase, the enzyme involved in the final step of proton production in the parietal cells, and thereby inhibits the enzyme.  Compounds which inhibit the gastric H,K-ATPase enzyme are generally known in the field as "proton pump inhibitors" (PPI).<br>
Some of the benzimidazole compounds capable of inhibiting the gastric H,K-ATPase enzyme have found substantial use as drugs in human medicine and are known under such names as LANSOPRAZOLE (United States Patent No. 4,628,098), OMEPRAZOLE (United States Patent Nos. 4,255,431 and 5,693,818), PANTOPRAZOLE (United States Patent No. 4,758,579), and RABEPRAZOLE (United States Patent No. 5,045,552).  The diseases treated<br>

PCT/US2003/0224I9<br><br>

by proton pump inhibitors and specifically by the four above-mentioned drugs include peptic ulcer, heart burn, reflux esophagitis errosive esophagitis, non-ulcer dispepsia, infection by Helicobacter pylori, laryngitis and asthma among others.<br>
Whereas the proton pump inhibitor type drugs represent substantial advance in the field of human and veterinary medicine, they are not totally without shortcomings or disadvantages. The shortcomings of the presently used proton pump inhibitor (PPI) type drugs can be best explained by a more detailed description of the mode of their action, the diseases or condition against which they are employed and the circumstances of their application. Thus, acid related diseases include but are not limited to erosive esophagitis, esophageal reflux, gastric and duodenal ulcer, non-ulcer dyspepsia and infection by Helicobacter pylori. Current therapy of all but the infection by H. pylori bacteria involves treatment with drugs designed to suppress acid secretion, one type of which are the above-mentioned proton pump inhibitors.<br>
The presently used proton pump inhibitors are pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazoles (or compounds of closely related structure) with a stated pKa of 4.0 to 5.0.  Their mechanism of action requires accumulation in the acidic space of the parietal cell (secretory canaliculus, pH ca. 1.0) and subsequently hydrogen ion catalyzed conversion to the reactive thiophilic species that is capable of inhibiting the gastric ATPase, enzyme resulting in effective inhibition of gastric secretion with a large therapeutic index.   Because of this mechanism the presently used PPI type drugs require specialized gastro protection to remain active for duodenal absorption. For this reason, and due to sensitivity to degradation in the acid milieu of the stomach, oral formulations of<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/009583<br><br>
PCT/US2003/022419<br><br>
3<br>
the PPI drugs are enteric coated. The need for enteric coating is a shortcoming because enteric coating is expensive and moisture sensitive.<br>
Because of the requirement for accumulation in the acid space of the parietal cell, acid secretion is necessary for the efficacy of the PPI type drugs. It was found that the plasma half life of these drugs is between 60 to 90 minutes. All acid pumps are not active at any one time, rather only about 75 % are active on the average during the time the drug is present in the blood following oral administration. It was also found in medical experience that on a currently used once-a-day oral administration therapy the maximal inhibition of stimulated acid output is approximately 66 %. This is due to a combination of the short plasma half life of the drug, to the limited number of acid pumps active during presentation of the drug and to the turn-over of acid pumps.   In present practice it is often not possible to properly control night time acid secretion by evening therapy with oral administration because the drug is dissipated from the plasma by the time acid secretion is established after midnight. The ideal target for healing in acid related diseases and for treatment of H. pylori infection (in conjunction with antibiotics), as well as for relief of symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia would be full inhibition of acid secretion. With the currently used PPI type drugs this is achieved only by intravenous infusion; in case of the drug OMEPRAZOLE this requires intravenous infusion of 8 mg per hour.   Clearly, there is a need in the art for a drug or drugs acting through the mechanism of PPI -type drugs which can attain or approach full inhibition of acid secretion through oral therapy.<br>
Because of the less than mil inhibition of acid secretion and less than 24 hour inhibition through oral administration that is attained by the current dosage forms of currently used PPI-type drugs, therapy for healing of gastric and<br>

PCT/US2003/U22419<br><br>
4<br>
duodenal ulcerations is 4 to 8 weeks. This is in spite of the fact that the generation time of surface cells of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum is approximately 72 hours. Undoubtedly the presently observed prolonged healing times with these drugs is due to inadequate acid suppression and acid related damage. The foregoing underscores the need in the art for a drug or drugs acting through the mechanism of PPI -type drugs that can attain or approach full inhibition of acid secretion through oral therapy.<br>
As further pertinent background to the present invention, applicants note the concept of prodrugs that is well known in the art.   Generally speaking, prodrugs are derivatives of perse drugs, which after administration undergo conversion to the physiologically active species. The conversion may be spontaneous, such as hydrolysis in the physiological environment, or may be enzyme catalyzed.   From among the voluminous scientific literature devoted to prodrugs in general, the foregoing examples are cited: Design of Prodrugs (Bundgaard H. ed.) 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B. V.

As far as the present inventors are aware, there are no prodrugs of the proton pump inhibitors presently in use. However, several United States patents describe compounds that can act as prodrugs of certain proton pump inhibitors. Specifically, United States Patent No. 4,686,230 (Rainer et al.) describes derivatives of pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazoles which include a group designated "R5" on one of the benzimidazole nitrogens. The "R5" group is expected to cleave under physiological condition, or under the influence of an enzyme to provide the corresponding compound with a free N-H bond (see column 3 of United States Patent No. 4,686,230). United States Patent Nos. 5,021,433 (Alminger et al), 4,045,563 (Berntsson et al), 4,965,269 and (Brdndstrom et al.) also describe pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazoles where one of the nitrogens of the benzimidazole moiety bears a substituent that cleaves under physiological or enzymatic conditions. United States Patent No. 4,045,563 (Berntsson et al.)describes N-alkoxycarbonyl benzimidazole derivates.<br>
A publication by Sih, et al. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1991, vol. 34, pp 1049-1062, describes N-acyloxyalkyl, N-alkoxycarbonyl, N-(aminoethyl), and N-alkoxyalkyl derivatives of benzimidazole sulfoxide  as prodrugs of proton-pump inhibitors. According to this article these prodrugs exhibited improved chemical stability in the solid state and in aqueous solutions, but had similar activity or less activity than the corresponding parent compounds having a free imidazole N-H group. This publication does not provide data regarding the duration of the inhibitory activity of these prodrugs. United States Patent No. 6,093,734 and PCT Publication WO 00109498 (published on February 24,2000) describe prodrugs of proton pump inhibitors which include a substituted arylsulfonyl moiety attached to one of the<br>

benzimidazole nitrogens of proton pump inhibitors having the structure identical with or related to proton pump inhibitor drugs known by the names LANSOPRAZOLE, OMEPRAZOLE, PANTOPRAZOLE and RABEPRAZOLE.<br>
PCT Publication WO 02/30920 describes benzimidazole compounds which are said to have gastric acid secretion inhibitory and anti H. pylori effects.  PCT Publication WO 02/00166 describes compounds that are said to be nitric oxide (NO) releasing derivatives of proton pump inhibitors of the benzimidazole structure.<br>
The present invention represents further advance in the art in that it provides prodrugs of the proton pump inhibitor type drugs of improved solubility in physiological fluids and improved cell penetration, and provides proof of the suitability of the prodrugs of the invention for use as prodrug of proton pump inhibitors, with improved efficacy in therapy of acid related diseases due to prolongation of the presence of the proton pump inhibitors in the body.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions<br>
The term alkyl refers to and covers any and all groups which are known as normal alkyl, branched-chain alkyl, cycloalkyl and also cycloalkyl-alkyl.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared for any compound in this invention having a functionality capable of forming a salt, such as the carboxylic acid, tetrazole or a basic (for example an amine) functionality of the compounds of the present invention. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt is any salt that retains the activity of the parent compound and does not impart any<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/009583	PCT/U S2003/022419<br>
10<br>
deleterious or untoward effect on the subject to which it is administered and in the context in which it is administered.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be derived from organic or inorganic bases. The salt may be a mono or polyvalent ion. Of particular interest are the inorganic ions, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Organic salts may be made with amines, particularly ammonium salts such as mono-, di- and trialkyl amines or ethanol amines. Salts may also be formed with caffeine, tromethamine and similar molecules. Hydrochloric acid or some other pharmaceutically acceptable acid may form a salt with a compound of the invention when the compound includes a basic group, such as an amine or a pyridine ring.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore may exist in enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. The scope of the present invention is intended to cover all isomers per se, mixtures of diastereomers and racemic mixtures of enantiomers (optical isomers) as well. General Embodiments<br>
The chemical structure of the compounds of the invention is shown and described in broad terms in the Summary of the Invention in connection with Formulas 1 through 4. As it can be seen in these formulas, the compounds of the invention are pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazoles substituted in the pyridine and benzimidazole moieties in the same manner as in the well known proton pump inhibitor drugs LANSOPRAZOLE (United States Patent No. 4,628,098), OMEPRAZOLE (United States Patent Nos. 4,255,431 and 5,693,818), PANTOPRAZOLE (United States Patent No. 4,758,579), and RABEPRAZOLE (United States Patent No. 5,045,552). The specifications of<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/009583	PCT/US2003/022419<br>
11<br>
United States Patent Nos. 4,628,098,4,255,431,5,693,818,4,758,579 and 5,045,552 are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Moreover, as it can be seen in connection with Formulas 1 through 4, in the compounds of the invention one of the benzimidazole nitrogens is substituted with a group (designated R in Formulas 1 through 4) that gradually cleaves under physiological conditions and thereby provides the pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazole compound which has a free NH function in the benzimidazole moiety.  The compound thus obtained by cleavage of the R group then undergoes the acid catalyzed rearrangement and provides the thiophilic species which inhibits the H,K-ATPase enzyme involved in gastric acid production. Thus, the novel compounds of the present invention bearing the R group are prodrugs of the proton pump inhibitor compounds which could also be depicted by Formulas 1 through 4 where, however the R group would be designated hydrogen. For further description of prodrugs of pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazoles type proton pump inhibitor drugs which include a substituted arylsulfonyl or substituted arylsulfonyl moiety attached to one of the benzimidazole nitrogens reference is made to United States Patent No. 6,093,734, 6,599,167 and PCT Publication WO 00109498, the specifications of which are expressly incorporated herein. As it is demonstrated by the solubility and related data provided below, the compounds of the present invention represent a significant improvement over these compounds of the prior art because they are significantly more soluble in physiological media, and therefore are expected to be significantly more bio-available.<br>
Referring now to the group designated R and shown by structural formulas (i) through (viii), compounds are preferred where R represents a substituted phenyl (formula (i)), substituted pyridyl (formula (ii)), substituted<br>
12-<br><br>
WO 2004/009583	PCT/US2003/022419<br>
12<br>
naphthyl (formula (iii)) or substituted thienyl (formula (vi)). Presently still more preferred are compounds where R represents substituted phenyl (formula<br>
CD)-<br>
Referring now to the variables designated R3 and R4 m formulas (i)<br>
through (vii), compounds of the invention are presently preferred where these<br>
variables are independently selected from H, methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl,<br>
methoxy, ethoxy, CF3, CH3O and OCF3. Preferably at least one of these<br>
substituents are not hydrogen, and preferably these substituents are on the<br>
carbon or carbons which is or are located adjacent to the carbon linked to the<br>
sulfonyl group. In many of the presently most preferred compounds of the<br>
invention where R is phenyl, these carbons are in ortho position relative to the<br>
sulfonyl group. As it will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the R3 and<br>
R4 substituents can electronically and sterically influence the rate of cleavage or<br>
hydrolysis of the sulfonyl group from the benzimidazole nucleus, and thereby<br>
influence the bio-availabilty of the prodrugs of the present invention. When, as<br>
in several preferred embodiments, the R3 and R4 substituents are in ortho (or<br>
comparable) position relative to the sulfonyl group, then the steric bulk or lack<br>
of steric bulk of these substituents are especially significant in influencing the<br>
rate of hydrolysis of the sulfonyl group from the benzimidazole moiety. In<br>
several of the presently preferred compounds of the invention R is phenyl<br>
(formula (i)) and R3 and R4 are both methyl and occupy the ortho and ortho"<br>
positions on the phenyl ring. In other examples of the preferred compounds of<br>
the invention R is phenyl, one of the R3 and R4 groups is H, and the other is iso-<br>
propyl. The ortho and ortho" methyl and the ortho iso-propyl substituents slow<br>
down the rate of hydrolysis relative to a compound of otherwise comparable<br>
structure that lacks these ortho and ortho" substituents.<br>

Referring now to the variables R1 and R2 it is an important feature of the compounds of the present invention that one or both of these groups include a carboxylic acid (or like-wise acidic tetrazole) function. The purpose of function of the carboxylic acid moiety included in these variables in the compounds of the invention is to render the compounds more soluble in aqueous physiological fluids at physiological pH than the prodrugs of pyridyl-methyl-sulfinyl-benzimidazole proton pump inhibitors of the prior art. Generally speaking it is desired within the scope of the present invention that the pKa of the carboxylic acid (or tetrazole) moiety of the compounds of the invention be in the range of 2 to 6, even more preferable the pKa should be in the range of 2 to 4, and still more preferably the pKa is approximately 3. One or two carboxylic acid moieties attached to the R1and/or to the R2 substituents provide the desired pKa and therefore the desired solubility to the compounds of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the acidity of the carboxylic acid moiety is influenced by the electronic effects of other groups in its vicinity, particularly so when the carboxylic acid moiety is attached directly to an aromatic ring. It will also be recognized that tetrazole ring may substitute for one or both carboxylic acid moieties, and further that physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention may have the same or even better solubility in physiological fluids than the corresponding free acids.<br>
The requirement of the present invention that one or both of the Rj and R2 groups include at least one but no more than a total of two carboxylic acid (or tetrazole) moieties (or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt) can be satisfied with a large variety or combination of R1 and R2 groups. For example, one of these two groups may represent H, in which case the other group includes one or two carboxylic acid (or tetrazole) function (or its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/009583	PCT/US2003/022419<br>
14<br>
salt). Alternatively, each of the R1 and R2 may include one carboxylic acid (or tetrazole) function (or their pharmaceutically acceptable salt). The carboxylic acid (or tetrazole) functions, designated R5 in connection with formulas (i) through (viii), may be directly attached to the aromatic or heteroaromatic rings (formulas (i) through (vii)) or to the Y group (formula (viii)), or one or both of the R1 and R2 groups may include a hydrocarbon "skeleton" or "frame" which is attached directly to the aromatic rings (formulas (i) through (vii)), or to the Y group (formula (viii)).  Alternatively, the hydrocarbon "skeleton" or "frame" itself may be attached to the aromatic or heteroaromatic rings (formulas (i) through (vii)) or to the Y group (formula (viii)) through an intermediate ether, thioether, amino, ester or amide function.   These functions are represented by the variable X in the description of the compounds in the Summary Section of this application for patent.<br>
Moreover, the ether, thioether, amino, ester or amide function or functions may be included at one or more places in the hydrocarbon "skeleton" or "frame" in which case the carboxylic acid (or tetrazole) moiety or moieties are attached to or are "carried by" R1 and/or R2 groups which themselves include ether, thioether, amino, ester or amide linkages. Any combination of these linkages may be suitable for providing compounds within the scope of the invention.

The presently most preferred compounds of the invention are those where one of the R11 through R34 groups is attached to the benzimidazole moiety shown in Formulas 1 through 4. Structures of specific examples of the most preferred compounds of the invention are provided below together with the experimental description of the preparation of the specific examples. Synthetic Methodology<br>
Generally speaking the compounds of the invention can be prepared by base catalyzed hydrolysis of substituted or unsubstituted phenyl sulfonyl-ethyl esters of the mono or dicarboxylic acids which constitute the compounds of the invention. The general method of the presently preferred synthetic process is shown in Reaction Scheme 1, where for the sake of simplicity of illustration the pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazole moieties corresponding to Formulas 1 through 4 are jointly shown by Formula 5, the aryl, heteroaryl or alkyl moieties of formulas (i) through (viii) are illustrated by a phenyl group, only the R1 group (as defined above) and only a monocarboxylic acid are shown. However those skilled in the art will readily understand that the herein described synthetic procedure can be applied to the preparation of all compounds within the scope of the invention with only such modifications<br>

which are readily apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure.<br>
Referring now specifically to Formula 5 in Reaction Scheme 1, this formula represents the pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazole compounds known as LANSOPRAZOLE, OMEPRAZOLE, PANTOPRAZOLE and RABEPRAZOLE. The variable Z represents H or such substituent which may be present in the benzimidazole moiety in any of these compounds, and Z" represents the substituent or substituents which are present in the pyridine moiety of these proton pump inhibitor drugs. The compound of Formula 5 is reacted with a chlorosulfonyl compound of Formula 6 in the presence of base such as sodium hydride, triethylamine, and di(isopropyl)methylamine or other suitable base, in an aprotic solvent such as CH2C12. The compound of Formula 6 includes a substituted or unsubstituted phenylsulfonylethyl ester of the carboxylic acid moiety that is included in the compounds of the invention.<br>

The substituent of the phenylsulfonylethyl moiety is indicated with the symbol Z", which in many preferred examples is a methyl group in the para position or a nitro group in the meta position of the phenyl ring. The preferred methods of synthesizing the chlorosulfonyl compounds of Formula 6 are illustrated in the reaction schemes below and are also described in detail in connection with the Specific Examples. Still further and generally speaking chlorosulfonyl compounds within the scope of Formula 6 can be obtained by such modifications of the reactions shown here which will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of widely available chemical patent and scientific literature.<br>
Reaction of the pyridyl methyl sulfinyl benzimidazole compounds of Formula 5 with the chlorosulfonyl compounds of Formula 6 results in the formation of the intermediates of Formula 7. The intermediates of Formula 7 are hydrolyzed in the presence of mild base, such as NaHC03, to provide the sodium salt of the compounds of the invention. A by-product of this reaction is a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl vinyl sulfone that is shown in Reaction Scheme 1. The sodium salt can be readily converted to the free acid compounds of the invention which are represented (in their simplified form) by Formula 8.<br>
Compounds of the invention which are depicted by Formulas 2 and 3 include a substituent in the benzimidazole moiety, namely a CH3O- group (Formula 2, OMEPRAZOLE derivatives) or a HF2CO- group (Formula 3, PANTOPRAZOLE derivatives). For this reason reaction of OMEPRAZOLE and PANTOPRAZOLE (depicted in a simplified form in Formula 5) with the chlorosulfonyl compounds of Formula 6 gives rise to 2 isomeric compounds, both of which are, generally speaking, within the scope of the invention. The<br>

two isomers are usually but not necessarily formed approximately in 1 to 1 ratios in the reaction, and it was found in accordance with the invention that the biological activity, solubility and particularly the stability of the isomers may also differ, in some cases significantly. Although, when desired, the isomers can be separated from one another by state-of-the-art separation techniques, such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), a more efficient synthetic route to synthesize single isomers of these compounds has been developed also. Reaction Schemes 1A and 1B disclose general synthetic routes to obtain the two single isomers of the OMEPRAZOLE derivatives of the invention. Specific synthetic schemes for making preferred single isomers of the OMEPRAZOLE derivatives of the invention are shown and described in the specific examples.<br>

Referring now to Reaction Scheme 1A 2-nitro-4-methoxy-aniline (available Jfrom Aldrich) is reacted with a chlorosulfonyl compound of Formula 9. As in connection with Reaction Scheme 1 in Reaction Schemes 1A and 1B<br>
also, for the sake of simplicity of illustration the reagent of Formula 9 illustrates the aryl, heteroaryl or alkyl moieties of formulas (i) through (viii) only by an exemplary phenyl group, and shows only the R1 group (as defined above) and an ester leading to a monocarboxylic acid. However those skilled in the art will readily understand that the herein described synthetic procedures can be applied to the preparation of single isomers of the OMEPRAZOLE derivatives of the present invention having the full scope of the R groups, as that group is defined in connection with Formulas 1 - 4.<br>
The reaction of 2-nitro-4-methoxy-aniline with the chlorosulfonyl compound of Formula 9 provides the chlorosulfonyl-2-nitro-4-methoxy-aniline derivative of Formula 10. The nitro group of the latter compound is reduced in the next reaction step to yield a chlorosulfonyl-2-amino-4-methoxy-aniline derivative of Formula 11. The chlorosulfonyl-2-amino-4-methoxy-aniline derivative of Formula 11 is then ring closed by treatment with thiocarbonyldiimidazole (Im2C=S) (or by treatment with phenylisocyanate, or with thiophosgene) to provide a 2-thiobenzimidazole derivative of Formula 12 where the methoxy group is in the 5-position of the imidazole ring and the chlorosulfonyl group is attached to the nitrogen in the 1-position. The compound of Formula 12 is reacted with 2-chloromethyl-4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridine to give rise to a AM-sulfonyl-5-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl(2-pyridyl))methylthio]-benzimidazol derivative of Formula 13. The reagent 2-chloromethyl-4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridine or its hydrochloride salt can be obtained by treatment of 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridine-methanol<br>

with thionyl chloride. The thioether linkage of the compound of Formula 13 is oxidized to the sulfoxide level by treatment with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, m-CPBA) or with other suitable oxidizing agent to yield a N-l-sulfonyl-5-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl(2-pyridyl))methylsulfinyl]-benzimidazol derivative of Formula 14. Treatment of the compounds of Formula 14 with base saponifies the carboxylic acid ester function attached to the aryl ring of the chlorosulfonyl moiety and gives rise to the OMEPRAZOLE derivative compounds of the invention of Formula 15 where the methoxy group is attached to the 5-position of the benzimidazole moiety (pure positional isomers).<br>
Reaction Scheme 1B illustrates a synthetic route to the "other isomer" where the methoxy group is attached to the 6-position of the benzimidazole moiety. In this scheme 3-methoxyaniline (available from Aldrich) is reacted with the reagent of Formula 9 to provide a chlorosulfonyl-3-methoxy-aniline derivative of Formula 16. The chlorosulfonyl-3-methoxy-aniIine derivative of Formula 16 is treated with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid to yield a chlorosulfonyl-3-methoxy-6-nitro-aniline derivative of Formula 17. The nitro group of the compound of Formula 17 is reduced to an amino group and the resulting chlorosulfonyl-3-methoxy-6-amino-aniline derivative is ring-closed by treatment with thiocarbonyldiimidazole to give a 2-thiobenzimidazole derivative of Formula 18 where the methoxy group is in the 6-position of the imidazole ring and the chlorosulfonyl group is attached to the nitrogen in the 1-position. The compound of Formula 18 is then subjected to the same sequence of reaction as the compound of Formula 12 in Reaction Scheme 1A, to give rise to the OMEPRAZOLE derivative compounds of the invention of Formula 21 where the methoxy group is attached to the 6-position of the benzimidazole<br>

moiety (pure positional isomers). It was found in accordance with the present invention that the positional isomers of Formula 21 tend to be less stable than the positional isomers of Formula 15.<br>
Reaction Schemes 2 to 44 incorporated in the section titled Specific Examples below, disclose the presently preferred synthetic routes to exemplary preferred compounds of the invention.<br>
BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, MODES OF ADMINISTRATON<br>
A significant advantage of the compounds of the present invention is that<br>
they can release the active forms of the proton pump inhibitors spontaneously<br>
	... ■*<br>
by hydrolysis in the mammalian (including human) body. Hydrolysis can occur chemically or enzymatically.   Because the compounds of this invention spontaneously release the active form of the proton pump inhibitor drugs by in vivo hydrolysis, they can attain longer duration of effective drug concentration in the body. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are prodrugs which are converted to active drugs by hydrolysis in the body, providing long duration of effective concentration. The long duration of inhibitory activity by spontaneous hydrolysis of the compounds of this invention allows more effective inhibition of gastric acid secretion, which enables better therapy of acid related disease defined above. Compounds of this invention can be administered for inhibiting gastric acid secretion orally. The typical daily dose of the compounds will depend on various factors such as the individual requirement of each patient. In general, oral and parenteral dosages will be in the range of 5 to 300 mg per day.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily understand that for oral administration the compounds of the invention are admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which per se are well known in the art. Specifically, a drug to be<br>

WO 2004/009583	PCT/US2003/022419<br>

administered systemically, it may be confected as a powder, pill, tablet or the like or as a syrup or elixir suitable for oral administration. Description of the substances normally used to prepare tablets, powders, pills, syrups and elixirs can be found in several books and treatise well known in the art, for example in Remington"s Pharmaceutical Science, Edition 17, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be combined with certain amounts of known proton pump inhibitors, e. g. LANSOPRAZOLE, OMEPRAZOLE, PANTOPRAZOLE, or RABEPRAZOLE,„ toprovide a drug-prodrug combination, and the combination administered for inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Thus, initially the proton pump inhibitor (drug) inhibits gastric acid secretion of the patient.  The aforesaid known and widely used proton pump inhibitors have 60-90 minutes of plasma half-life. As the effective concentration of the proton pump inhibitor (drug) is decreased by metabolism, the compound of the present invention (prodrug) continuously undergoes hydrolysis and provides and maintains new active inhibitor concentration in the mammalian, including human body for much longer periods of time than the unmodified proton pump inhibitor. This results in more rapid and effective inhibition of acid secretion.<br>
A disadvantage of many of the presently used proton pump inhibitors is that for therapy by injection in a liquid form they must be reconstituted from a lyophilized powder in a medium having the high pH of approximately 9.5 to 10.5.   The prodrugs of the present invention overcome the disadvantage of requiring a reconstituting medium having such high pH, because the compounds of the present invention can be reconstituted to form an injectable liquid in a medium of approximately pH 7 to 8. It will be readily appreciated by those<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2004/009583	PCT/US2003/022419<br>
34<br>
skilled in the art that for administration in liquid form by injection the liquid that reconstitutes the drug is a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous solution that per se is known in the art. Such pharmaceutically acceptable solutions utilized for administration of drugs in injectable form are described for example in the treatise PHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORMS (Parenteral Medications, Volume 1, Edited by K. E. Avis, H. A. Lieberman and L. Lachman(1992).<br>
Among the benefits of the pre-proton pump inhibitor (P-PPI) type of drugs of the present invention is their ability to provide more effective treatment of erosive esophagitis and of less severe reflux diseases as well. This is because effective treatment of erosive esophagitis (and to a lesser extent of lesser reflux diseases) requires prevention of the reflux of gastric contents at pH 3.0 or still lower pH. The current PPI drugs allow several acidic excursions to pH  4.0 for about 16 hours per day or longer. When, as in current usual treatment by PPIs, the other 8 hours contain episodic acidity to pH 3.0 or less, the patients tend to continue to complain of pain. The more effective and more continues acid suppression by the drugs of the present invention is likely to result in substantially better treatment of this disease, as well as faster healing of all acid related erosions or ulcers.<br>
The pre-proton pump inhibitor (P-PPI) type of drugs of the present invention provide improved dual therapy for H. pylori eradication.   This is because the PPI"s synergize with cell division dependent antibiotics such as amoxicillin (cell wall biosynthesis) and clarithromycin (protein synthesis) by elevating gastric surface pH to enable a larger fraction of the bacterial<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2004/009583<br><br>
PCT/US2003/022419<br><br>
35<br>
population to be in dividing or growth phase during presentation of the antibiotic to the gastric lumen. However, their effect on intragastric pH is limited by their dwell time in the plasma. The pre-proton pump inhibitor (P-PPI) type of drugs of the present invention can continuously elevate intra gastric pH close to neutrality on current once a day therapy. Therefore, 100% eradication of the bacteria is expected in dual therapy with the prodrugs of the invention (for example a prodrug of OMEPRAZOLE in accordance with the invention) plus an effective antibiotic, such as amoxicillin.<br>
Even monotherapy for H. pylori eradication is likely to be successful with the pre-proton pump inhibitor (P-PPI) type of drugs of the present invention. This is because in the absence of acid, the enzyme H. pylori urease elevates environmental pH to &gt; 8.3, which is toxic to the organism. PPI"s in current formulation inhibit growth or present of the organism in the antrum, due to elevation of antral pH to close to neutrality.  Elevation of 24 hour pH to neutrality, as it can be accomplished with the drugs of the present invention, is likely to result in "self eradication" of the bacteria.<br>
Approximately 30% of patients with gastrointestinal distress appear with symptoms without quantitative underlying disease (non-ulcer dyspepsia). The most likely cause for these symptoms is upper gastrointestinal afferent nerve sensitivity to gastric acid. Only highly effective inhibition of acid secretion or even acid ablation can ameliorate these symptoms and this can be attained with the drugs of the present invention.

The results in the buffer of pH 7.4 are shown in Table 1. As it can be seen in Table 1, the compounds tested were found to be highly soluble in the phosphate buffered saline buffer at pH 7.4.  The tested compounds were much less soluble little in the Britton Robinson buffer of pH 3, but still more soluble than the prior art compounds (a) through (f).   This is understandable in view of the fact that in the buffer of pH 7.4 the compounds of the invention form a sodium salt, whereas in the buffer of pH 3 the compounds are less soluble free carboxylic acids. Thus, a solution of a sodium or other pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compounds of the invention, or stated in an other way the compounds of the invention at pH 7 or above are highly soluble and therefore suitable for administration by intravenous injection.<br>

The stability of Compounds 1,2, 3, 4 and 5 of the invention in aqueous solution (0.lmg/mL) was investigated in Britton Robinson buffers of pH 3, pH 7, and pH 9, respectively.   A solution of 0.1 mg/mL concentration of each compound in each buffer was prepared and the solutions were stored at 37 °C for 1 h and then the concentrations of test compounds were determined by HPLC. It was found that the test compounds are stable in aqueous solution under neutral conditions. Half-life of hydrolysis at pH 7 of the prodrug to yield the corresponding proton pump inhibitory drug was over 50 hours. This  demonstrates that the prodrugs per se are stable enough for intravenous injection.<br>
Stability in Plasma<br>
Exemplary test compounds (prodrugs) of the invention were incubated in plasma at 37 °C, and the concentration of the compounds and also of the corresponding proton pump inhibitor compounds (PPI) were determined by a gradient HPLC-UV method. The results are shown in Table 2. Although the<br>

half-lives of test compounds in plasma varies depending on their structure, nevertheless it is apparent that in plasma the compounds of the invention are converted into the corresponding proton pump inhibitor at a rate faster than the hydrolysis rate of the compound at neutral or near neutral pH. This demonstrates that the prodrugs of the invention can be used as prodrugs in intravenous injection and that they release the active proton pump inhibitor in vivo.<br>

OMEPRAZOLE sodium salt or LANSOPRAZOLE sodium salt (20 mg) was suspended in 10 ml of 0.1 N NaHCO3  40 mg of each of the sodium salts of Compound 1, Compound 2, Compound 3, Compound 4, Compound 6 Compound 9, Compound 12, mixture (1:1) of Compound 16 and 17, mixture (1:1) of Compound 18 and 19, mixture (1:1) of Compound 20 and 21, mixture (1:1) of Compound 22 and 23, Compound 27, mixture (1:1) of Compound 34 and 35, and Compound 36 were dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.  The doses administered to the rats were as follows (μmole per kg body weight of the rat): OMEPRAZOLE (10 umole/kg), LANSOPRAZOLE (10 μmole/kg), Compound 1 20 μmole/kg, Compound 2 40 umole/kg, Compound 3 20 umole/kg, Compound 4 20 umole/kg, Compound 6 20 umole/kg, Compound 9 40 umole/kg, Compound 12 40 umole/kg, mixture (1:1) of Compound 16 and 17 40 umole/kg, mixture (1:1) of Compound 18 and 19 40 μmole/kg„ mixture (1:1) of Compound 20 and 21 40 μmole/kg„ mixture (1:1) of Compound 22 and 23 40 μmole/kg, Compound 27 40 μmole/kg, mixture (1:1) of Compound 34 and 35 40 μmole/kg, and Compound 36 40 μmole/kg. These drug solutions were orally administered. 3 hours after administration the abdomen of the rat was incised and the pylorus was ligated under light ether anethesia. Histamine (30 mg/kg) and carbachol (30 μg/kg) were subcutaneously injected for acid stimulation.<br>

Immediately the abdomen was closed. Two hours later, the esophagus was ligated and the stomach was removed. The gastric juice was collected and acid output was quantified by titration using 0.1 N NaOH solution. As a control experiment, 1 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) solution was orally administrated without any prodrug or proton pump inhibitory drug. Acid output was quantified by same method as described above, showing maximum histamine and carbachol-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Percentage inhibition was calculated from the fractional responses elicited by the test compound and a control experiment. Table 3) Inhibition of gastric acid secretion between 3-5 hours after<br>
