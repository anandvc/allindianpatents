				<td>The present invention is about a conveying/cooling device of solid hot loose materials such as<br>

capacity control, and<br>
Figure 9 is a diagrammatic view of the metal conveyor belt (4) having the plates equipped with<br>
slots (6)<br>
It must be clarified on this matter that the same reference numbers in the various figures indicate<br>
similar or matching parts<br><br>
The conveyor/cooler according to the present invention uses for the transport of the hot loose<br>
materials (3), specifically such as heavy ashes and other combustion by products coming from the<br>
boilers or incinerators (2-7), a driving means with a steel metal belt(4) inserted in a sealed metal<br>
container(l)<br>
The hot loose material (3) thanks to the gravitational effect leaves the boiler or incinerator (2-7)<br>
under which the. metal conveyor belt (4) is found, whereon the material (3) is laid down by forming a<br>
continuous bed traveling towards the unloading area (9)<br>
The dusty material with a smaller grain size which falls from the metal belt (4) and is laid down<br>
on the bottom of the container (1) is conveyed towards the outlet (9) through the use of a scraping<br>
conveying means (10) with chains or with a metal net<br>
The speed of the conveyor belt (4) can be adjusted with respect to the capacity of the conveyed<br>
material (3) and of the specific cooling needs, so as to optimize the distribution of the ashes on the belt<br>
in order to increase the thermal exchange surface<br>
The cooling of the loose material (3) exiting from the combustion chambers at temperatures<br>
close to 800/900 deg C, takes place through the joint feeding of air flows and water jets atomized<br>
inside of the container (1)<br>
The external air is induced in the metal container (1) through the air intakes by using the<br>
vacuum found in the combustion chamber when the CONVEYING/COOLING system is connected to<br>
vacuum operated combustion chambers (2) In the event that the conveying/cooling system were to be<br>
installed downstream of the boilers or incinerators wherein the combustion occurs under pressure<br>
operated combustion chamber (7), the cooling air is induced inside of the metal container (1) with the<br>
aid of a forced ventilation system<br>
The air flow enters from the air intakes (12) and passes through the metal container (1) by<br>
heading against the stream with respect to the advancing of the hot material (3) conveyed by the metal<br>
belt (4) towards the unloading area (9)<br>
In order to improve the efficiency of the cooling process, the metal plates of the conveyor belt<br>
(4) can be equipped with slots (6) through which the cooling air can reach the bottom of the travelling<br>
continuous bed and can flow inside the layer of the<br><br>
material (3) . In such manner, in the metal container (1)<br>
additional air intakes (11) are provided, whose placement is such<br>
to generate a farther cooling flow, different from the previous<br>
one.<br>
Regarding the second air flow sucked by the intakes (11), a<br>
part of it flows at the bottom of the container (1) underneath<br>
the conveyor belt (4) towards the unloading area (9) whereas<br>
nixed to the first flow coming from the air intakes (12), while<br>
the remaining part flows through the slots (6} made in the metal<br>
plates of the conveyor belt (4). By talcing advantage of the<br>
difference in pressure existing between the upper section of the<br>
conveyor belt and the lower one, the air passes through the whole<br>
thickness of the traveling continuous bed of hot material (3), by<br>
cooling its bottom and the inner layer.<br>
The geometry, the number and the arrangement of the slots<br>
(6) made in the plates of the conveyor belt (4) are defined as a<br>
function of the chemical-physical features of the conveyed<br>
material (3) and of the desired cooling degree, so as to avoid a<br>
possible leakage.<br>
The fraction of used air for the two cooling portions of<br>
the incoming flow from the intake valves (11) can be measured<br>
through, an adjustment mechanism (13) placed in the lower part of<br>
the metal container (1) in proximity of the unloading area (9) .<br>
The capacity of the cooling air is a function of the air<br>
intakes (11-12) and of the pressure difference established in the<br>
metal container (1), and it can be measured out by acting on the<br>
adjustment members of the intake valves.<br>
The air absorbs the heat that the hot material (3) gives up<br>
thanks to the convective thermal exchange that the air directly<br>
has with the same material, with the walls of the metal container<br>
(1) which are radiatively heated, with the metal belt (4), both<br>
in its forward run and its return runr and at last through the<br>
possible post- combustion of the unburnt matter found in the<br>
conveyed material (3). It is convenient to clarify that in the<br>
specific case the metal conveyor belt (4) operates as a<br>
regenerative heat exchanger, fay absorbing the heat from the hot<br>
loose material (3) in the forward run and by giving it up to the<br>
cooling air during the return run.<br>
When the conveyor/cooler is applied to the boilers or vacuum<br>
operated incinerators (2), the air thus heated is taken back in<br>
the combustion chamber where is mixed with the main combustion<br><br>
air, by recovering in such manner part of the thermal energy<br>
accumulated during the cooling phase of the hot material (3).<br>
When instead the system is applied to pressure operated<br>
combustion chambers {7} the air is directly ejected into the<br>
atmosphere, after an appropriate filtering for the recovery of<br>
the volatile substances.<br>
In order to further reduce the temperature of the hot<br>
material (3) conveyed by the metal belt (4) the air cooling<br>
system is integrated with the water cooling system.<br>
The water cooling system is made of a determined number of<br>
nozzles (5) which can be activated when the air only cooling<br>
capacity is not enough to guarantee the desired thermal<br>
reduction. The nozzles (5) are arranged in such manner that the<br>
atomized water jets would be directed on the upper part of the<br>
hot loose material (3) conveyed by the metal belt (4) during the<br>
forward run towards the unloading area (9).<br>
The integration of the atomized water sprinkling system<br>
allows increasing the thermal exchange with the conveyed material<br>
(3), therefore it is possible to reduce the horizontal dimensions<br>
of the metal container (1) compared to the cooling carried out<br>
with air only.<br>
The sprinkling system can also be used in the applications<br>
wherein the object is not just that of reducing the temperature<br>
of the conveyed material (3), but it is also that of achieving a<br>
preset moisturizing of the same material.<br>
The number of nozzles (5) therein, their PLANO-VOLUMETRIC<br>
arrangement inside of the metal container (!) and the kind of<br>
each single nozzle (5) are predefined according to the chemical-<br>
physical characteristics of the conveyed material (3), according<br>
to the capacity of the same material and according to the desired<br>
cooling degree.<br>
The sprinkling system can be connected to the compressed air<br>
network so as to jointly atomize water and air with respect to<br>
the need to optimize the cooling by appropriately measuring out<br>
the capacity of the two elements.<br>
The capacity of the nozzles (h), the intervention sequence<br>
and the duration of the activation are defined according to the<br>
temperature of the material (3) and according to the level of the<br>
capacity of the same material, through the on-line processing of<br>
the signals received by the temperature sensors (14) installed<br><br>
inside the metal container (l), and by the value of the capacity<br>
of the material {3).<br>
The instant value of the capacity of the hot loose conveyed<br>
material (3) can be measured by either utilizing a weighing<br>
system (8) directly connected to the conveyor belt (4), or by<br>
using a strap iron (15) hinged to the upper cover of the metal<br>
container (1) suitable to detect the height of the layer of the<br>
conveyed material (3) .<br>
It is obvious that several modifications, adjustments,<br>
additions, variations and substitutions of the elements with<br>
others which are functionally equivalent can be made to the<br>
embodiments of the invention described in an explanatory but not<br>
limiting way without falling out of the scope of protection<br>
