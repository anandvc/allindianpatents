COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
'DUAL MOLECULES CONTAINING A PEROXIDE DERIVATIVE, SYNTHESIS AND THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS<br>
THEREOF"<br>
CENTRE NATIONAL DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE [C.N.R.S.], of 3, rue Michel-Ange, F-75794 Paris, France,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to dual molecules containing a peroxide derivative, showing particularly an anti-malarial activity, the synthesis and therapeutic applications of said molecules.<br>
Malaria is one of the primary infectious causes of mortalitv in the world and affects 100 to 2Q0 million people, a year. The signiffiant'upsurge in the  disease-observed in recent years is due to several factors, including:<br>
the carriers, i.e. Anopheles, which are becoming resistant to conventional inexpensive insecticides such as DDT (abbreviation of trichloro-1,1,1-di(p-chloro-phenyl)-2,2 ethane);<br>
-	population  growth  in  at-risk  zones  and, •<br>
essentially,<br>
-the resistance'of numerous strains of Plasmodium' falciparum,  ' the parasite responsible' for the mortal forms  of  the  disease,  to  the  medicinal  products :onventiorially  used,   such   as   chloroquine and<br><br>
mefloquine.  The discovery of artemisinine  1,  2,  a powerful anti-malarial agent extracted from Artemisia annua,     drew attention, to molecules comprising,  like artemisinine,   an   endoperoxide   function   3,   4. Artemisinine   and   some   of   its   hemi-synthetic derivatives, such as artemether and artesunate, have iproved to be very active on resistant P.    falciparum Istrains.  However,  the  high  cost  of  these  natural compounds  and  uncertain  supply  represent  major disadvantages.  Therefore,  the interest of synthetic anti-malarial compounds, which would be accessible at low prices, and offer an action mechanism similar to that of artemisinine, an alkylating effect on the blood and/or parasitic proteins, will be evaluated.<br>
Research on such compounds by the inventors led to the development of a new synthesis strategy based on the use of- . compounds liable both to be accumulated effectively in the parasite and exert an effect such as that of artemisine.<br>
The inventors observed that forming a covalent bond between a compound with anti-malarial properties and a peroxide type derivative offered coupling products with, surprisingly, a synergic effect between the penetration capacity and activity of the respective constituents on chloroquine-resistant strains and as a general rule a high efficacy for a wide range of parasites.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to dual molecules Dresented in the form of coupling products, showing particularly an anti-malarial activity, in particular m P.   falciparum.<br><br>
It also relates  to a synthesis method for such molecules, comprising a limited number of steps, involving low-cost products, and therefore easy to implement at an industrial scale.<br>

This method comprises the reaction of reactive derivatives of A and peroxide derivatives comprising the residues Rx' and Ry, so as to form, between these derivatives, a link as defined in relation to formula I.<br>
(XI)<br>
Various synthesis processes will be easy to access for those skilled in the art using conventional techniques. For example, for peroxide synthesis, it is possible to refer to the work by S. Patai, "The Chemistry of peroxides", John Wiley and Sons Ltd, 1983. In this way, to prepare dual molecules comprising a trioxane as the peroxide and an aminoquinoline as the derivative A, a compound according to formula XI<br><br><br>
 wherein K3 -is as defined above and "hal" represents a halogen atom, is reacted with a diamine derivative according to formula XII<br>
' R4—NH— Yr-u,	(XII)<br>
where R4 and Yx are as defined above and U^. represents an -NH2 group, producing a compound according to formula XIII<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R3, R4 and Yx  are, as defined above,<br>
b)-irradiation in the presence of molecular oxygen<br>
and a photosensitising agent, of a derivative according<br>
to formulas XIV to XVII below<br><br><br><br>
followed by the reaction with a diketone, such as 1,4-cyclohexadione according to formula XVIII or cis-bicyclo(3.3.0]octane-3,7-dione according to formula XIX<br><br><br><br><br>
producing trioxanes functionalised with a ketone, according to the general formula XX,<br><br>
(XX)<br>
o—o'<br>
wherein Zx, Z2 and R3 are as defined above, c)-coupling of the derivative according to formula XIII with the trioxane according to formula XX, by reductive amination, followed if applicable by a reaction with a pha.rmaceutically acceptable acid, to obtain the coupling product in salt form.<br>
Step a is advantageously carried out at a. temperature of 80°C to 140°C with stirring. The diamine derivative is preferentially used at a rate of 5 molar equivalents. After cooling, the product obtained is recovered by extraction, for example using an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, and then treated if required, for purification purposes.<br>
To carry out step b, photosensitised oxygenation of the initial olefin is performed in the presence of molecular  oxygen.  The  photosensitising  agent  is advantageously a conventional agent such as tetra-phenylporphyrine or Bengal pink.<br>
The peroxide obtained is then reacted with a diketone, preferentially at a rate of 4 to 10 molar equivalents. The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of trimethyl silyl trifluorpmethane sulphonate, at a temperature below -50°C, particularly -70°C, for several hours. The functionalised trioxane is then purified. Column chromatography is used for example. A similar protocol is used for the synthesis of trioxane as the precursor of trioxaquines according to  formula  XIII:  2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene  is  photo-<br><br>
oxygenated under the above conditions and then placed in the presence of 2 to 10 molar equivalents of an oxoaldehyde, a few drops of trifluoroacetic acid and 2 molar equivalents of N-iodosuccinimide. The reaction is carried out at ambient temperature and protected from light for several ho:urs. The functionalised trioxane is then purified using column chromatography for example.<br>
The coupling step c between the ketone and primary amine is carried out in the presence of a reductive agent such as sodium triacetoborohydride,. at ambient temperature.<br>
These compounds are used according to a primary amine/ketone molar ratio of approximately 1.25, the reductive agent being used at a rate of 1.25 equivalents/ketone. To obtain the coupling product in salt form, the basic nitrogens undergo protonation, by adding a pharmacological acceptable acid. For example, citric, tartaric, oxalic and fumaric acid may be used.<br>
The reaction may be carried out with 2 acid equivalents. The protonated product is then recovered and subjected to one or more purification steps if required.<br>
The study of the pharmacological properties of the coupling products according to the invention demonstrated an anti-malarial effect on P. falciparum cultured in human red blood cells.<br>
It' is particularly important to obtain such an effect as the resistance phenomena of Plasmodium falciparum strains, the mortal species, are developing with respect to standard anti-malarial drugs and, in addition,  vaccination  protection,  the  subject  of<br><br>
considerable  research,  will  not  be  available  for several years.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to the use of the properties of these "coupling products, which also offer the advantage of high safety, to produce pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention are characterised in that they comprise an effective quantity of at least one coupling product as defined above, associated with a pharmaceutically inert vehicle.<br>
These formulations comprise if required active ingredients  of  other medicinal  products.  This may involve an association with any other anti-malarial molecule  (amino-quinoline, aryl-alcohol comprising an amine  function,  amino  derivatives  of  orthocresol, sulphones, sulphonamides, biguanides, amino-pyriminidines,  amino-triazines,  or quinazolines,  and antibiotics (tetracycline, rifampicine, gramicindine D, valinomycine and quinolones in particular)  and anti¬fungal agents with an anti-malarial activity).<br>
They will also be used advantageously with compounds promoting their assimilation such as sugars like glucose.<br>
The formulations according to the invention are particularly suitable for the treatment of malaria..<br>
Therefore,  the  invent ion. also  relates  to  the<br>
application of the coupling products defined above to<br>
the development of medicinal products to treat malaria.<br>
The sales packaging materials, particularly the<br>
labelling and package inserts, and advantageously the<br><br>
packaging,  are  produced  according  to  the  planned specific therapeutic application.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention may be administered in different forms, more specifically by the oral, rectal or injectable route.<br>
Formulations administered orally advantageously comprise 40 to 300 mg of active ingredient per dosage unit, preferentially 40 to 100 mg. They advantageously come in the form of tablets, pills, capsules or drops in particular.<br>
The injectable forms comprise 2 0 to 3 00 mg of active ingredient per dosage unit, preferentially 50 to 100 mg. They come in the form of solutions for injection by the intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular route, produced from sterile or sterilisable solutions. Suspensions or emulsions may also be used.<br>
For rectal administration, suppositories are used. For example, the dosage that may be used in humans corresponds to the following doses:  the patient is administered 50 to 300 mg/day for example, in one or more doses for malaria treatment.<br>
The invention also relates to biological reagents, wherein the active ingredients are composed of .the derivatives defined above.<br>
These reagents may be used as references or standards in studies on potential anti-malarial activities.<br>
The invention's other characteristics and advantages will be seen more clearly in the following examples related to the production of quinoline and<br><br>
trioxane coupling products, referred to as "trioxaquines", and the study of their anti-parasitic activity. The formulas of compounds 1 to 34, the synthesis of which is described in these examples are given at the end of the disclosure.<br>

Synthesis of trioxanes functionalised with a ketone 2 6a and 2 6b<br>
A mixture of 1,3-cyclohexadiene (4 0 0 mg, 5 mmol) and tetraphenylporphyrine  (5 mg)  in dichloromethane (10 ml)  is irradiated in the presence of molecular oxygen (1.15 bar) for 1 hour, at 5°C, with a white bulb (200 W) . The peroxide is obtained with a quantitative yield.  The  unprocessed  peroxide  in  solution  in dichloromethane is placed in a bath at -70°C; 4 molar equivalents of 1,4 cyclohexanedione (2.3 g, 2 0 mmol) and 0.4 equivalent of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane sulphonate  (500  µl,  2.8  mmol)  are  added and the reaction mixture is kept under stirring at -70°C for- 4 hours. The reaction is stopped by adding triethylamine (1000 ill) . After returning to ambient temperature, the reaction medium is washed with distilled water', dried on  magnesium  sulphate  and  evaporated  to  dryness. Chromatography on silica column (hexane/ethyl acetate eluent, 70/30, v/v) is used to separate the two isomer trioxanes 26a and 26b (overall yield: 2%).<br><br>

Experimental section<br>
The   P.	falciparum        strains   are   cultured<br>
continuously according to Trager and Jensen's method 5, with the following modifications 6: the parasites are maintained in human red blood cells (0±), diluted to 1% haematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM Hepes + 30 mM NaHC03 and complemented with 5% AB+ human serum. The parasite populations are synchronised over a 4 hour period by flotation with a gelatine solution, followed by lysis with 5% D-sorbitol 7,8. The Nigerian strain is considered to be susceptible to chloroquines and the FcM29-Cameroon and FcBl-Columbia strains are chloroquine-resistant (IC50 for chloroquine  100 nM) 9,10. The anti-malarial activity tests are performed using Desjardins' radioactive micromethod 11. The tests are performed in triplicate, in '96-well microplates, the  reading's  being  at  1%  haematocrit  and  0.5-1% parasitaemia.  For  each  test,  the  parasites  are incubated with decreasing concentrations of drug for either . 32  hours  and  72  hours  (4  wells  contain chloroquine diphosphate as a reference).  The first dilution of the drug is performed at 10 mg/ml in<br><br>
dimethylsulphoxide and the following dilutions are made with RPMI 1640. The parasite growth is measured with the incorporation of tritiated hypoxanthine compared to incorporation in the absence of drug  (taken to be 100%) .   12  and  the  IC50 values  are  determined graphically by plotting the percentage of inhibition as a function of the drug concentration. The IC50 values measured after 3 2 hours, equivalent to the end of the trophozoite stage, are used to evaluated the influence of the compound on parasite maturation, the IC50 values measured after 72 hours, corresponding to 1.5 of the life cycle in red blood cells,  indicate a possible effect on erythrocyte reinvasion.<br>

The IC50 values obtained for the compounds 3, 4, 6 and 9 are between 5 and 5 0 ng/ml, which is equivalent to a concentration of 8 to 86 nM.<br>
All the trioxaquine samples are more active than<br>
chloroquine, on both susceptible and resistant strains<br>
(except for 6 on the Nigerian susceptible strain). The<br>
high efficacy of 9, 3 and 4 on the susceptible and<br>
resistant, strains,  significantly  greater  than  the<br><br>
activity of not .only chloroquine, but also of each of, the two fragments, guinoline-amine 1 (n=2) and trioxane-keto.ne 2, indicates a significant synergic effect between the trioxane and chloroquinoline fragments of these compounds.<br>
The citrate form of compound 4 increases its solubility considerably in aqueous media while retaining a high activity. Protonation by other acids than citric acid produces salts offering the same advantages (hydrochloride, sulphate, tartrate).<br>
The low IC5Q values obtained with trioxaqui'ne 3 on the FcBl, FcM2 9 strains and on the Nigerian strain (9 nM, 18 nM and 1.8 nM respectively) and with 9 and the citrate 4, indicate that the efficacy of these compounds is retained for a wide spectrum of parasites.<br>

Example 15<br>
Activity  of  trioxaquine-citrate  4  on  human isolates<br>
Trioxaquine-citrate 4, referred to as DU-1102, was tested on human Plasmodium falciparum isolates, some of which were chloroquine- and/or pyrimethamine-resistant. The median inhibitory concentration values, ■ IC50, obtained are 11 to 68 ng/ml, corresponding to a geometric mean of 41 ng/ml, i.e. 43 nM.<br>
The activity of DU-1102 on these isolates is independent of their susceptibility or their resistance to the other anti-malarial agents tested.<br>
There is no correlation between DU-1102 on the one hand and chloroquine or pyrimethamine on the other, which indicates the absence of the probability of cross-resistance between DU-1102 and said anti-malarial agents already used.<br>
These results indicate the satisfactory efficacy of trioxaquines on wild P. falciparum strains.<br>
