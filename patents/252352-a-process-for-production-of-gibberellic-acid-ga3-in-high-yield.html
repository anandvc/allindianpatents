				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for production of Gibberellic acid (GA3) in high yield from fruits, vegetables and agriculture waste.<br>
More particularly it relates to a process for production of Gibberellic acid (GA3) in high yield from fruits, vegetables and agriculture waste using fungal strain Gibberella.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF INVENTION<br>
The gibberellins (GAs) are originally identified as secondary metabolites of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi Saw Wr. (Fusarium moniliforme Sheld.). While these compounds have no apparent role in the fungus, they have been found to elicit a variety of responses in higher plants (seed plants) including shoot elongation, sex expression, fruit growth, and seed germination. The early descriptions of gibberellins -induced elongation, especially those associated with genetic dwarfism, led to the idea that GAs might be naturally-occurring in normal, non dwarf strains of higher plants. The first evidence for the presence of gibberellin-like substances in higher plants came from the fact that semi-purified extracts from such material would mimic a GA-induced growth response when applied to genetic dwarfs. This evidence was soon followed by the isolation and chemical identification of gibberellins (Gas). Gibberellins are well-recognized group of diterpenoids having a typical tetracyclic ring system. More than hundred naturally occurring gibberellins are known.<br>
It is a well-established fact that gibberellins, particularly Gibberellic acid (GA3) are a well-known plant growth regulator. Gibberellins are well-recognized group of diterpenoids having a typical tetracyclic ring system. More than hundred naturally occurring gibberellins are known. Many gibberellins are found to occur naturally in all higher plants. Because of potent plant growth regulating property; Gibberellic acid (GA3) is extensively used in agriculture, horticulture, nurseries, greenhouses, viticulture and tea gardens. Gibberellic acid (GA3) at very low concentration (
 <br>
to extremely low yield, extensive down stream processing and the consequent high capital and operating expenses.<br>
Reference may be made by a method described for production of Gibberellic acid by Solid-State Fermentation in Coffee Husk by Machado C. M. M., et al. (Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, July 2002,vol.l02, no.1-3, pp.170-192 (14)). Although it uses coffee husk, an agriculture waste as a raw material and produces gibberellic acid using Gibberella fujikuroi LPB 06, yet the yield of gibberellic acid is very low (492.5 mg) as it is well known fact that Gibberellic Acid yield varies according to the use of the selected strain. Also, coffee husk waste used by Machado C. M. M., et al., is region specific.<br>

Gibberellins are well-recognized group of diterpenoids having a typical tetracyclic ring<br>
system. Many gibberellins are found to occur naturally in all higher plants. Gibberellic<br>
acid (GAs) is a well-known compound among the group of gibberellins and has been<br>
recognized as a potential plant growth regulator. Gibberellic acid (GA3) is extensively<br>
used in agriculture, horticulture, nurseries and green houses for regulating cell growth<br>
and stimulating the phenomenon of germination.<br>
The present invention provides a novel method for utilizing solid waste of agriculture,<br>
fruit and vegetable from food processing industries for production of gibberellins,<br>
containing high percentage of gibberellic acid.   The waste, which is not used for any<br>
purpose other than disposal by any way, is used for value added product involving very<br>
simple technique. E.g. the method described in Kumar K. P.   K. and Lonsane B. K.<br>
(1987), used to produce gibberellic acid from wheat bran and rice bran. But these<br>
materials are used as an important ingredient in animal and poultry feed formulations.<br>
Thus the present invention utilizes solid waste of agriculture, fruit and vegetable for<br><br>
production of gibberellic acid by solid-state fermentation using a fungal strain of Gibberellafujikuroi NCIM 1099.<br>
Agriculture waste viz. waste maize cobs, sorghum straws, fruit and vegetable wastes like viz. citrus pomace, pineapple pomace, tomato peel, potato peel, pea hull etc. from fruit and vegetable processing industry has limited utility to make value added products. This invention discloses the process of production of gibberellic acid using the solid waste of fruits and vegetables and agriculture waste which have no utility otherwise and essentially are absolute wastes. The present invention also discloses isolation of gibberellic acid by modified solid-liquid extraction process with high recovery of solvent. The invention provides a novel method utilizing solid waste of fruits and vegetables and agricultural waste as a raw material for producing the value added products. Solid waste of fruits, vegetables and agriculture contains appreciable quantum of nutrients and hence we got more yield of Gibberellic Acid upto 5-6 gm/Kg of waste.<br>
This invention describes the production of gibberellic acid by fungal strain Gibberella fujikuroi NCIM 1099 obtained from National collection of Industrial Microorganism, National Chemical Laboratories (NCL), Pune. The strain was grown subsequently on potato dextrose agar in slants, stored at low temperature and used in the experiments. The colonies of the Gibberella fujikuroi on Potato Dextrose agar in slants found the texture like cotton wool.<br>
Aqueous nutrient media was prepared which consist of useful source of carbon and nitrogen, low level of inorganic salts like potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus and trace elements like zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum. 100 ml of aqueous nutrient media was transferred in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask and closed with surgical cotton plug. The flasks were autoclaved to get sterile biomass. These flasks were inoculated with the culture of Gibberellafujikuroi NCIM 1099 grown on potato dextrose agar at ambient temperature. The inoculated flasks were incubated in a chamber equipped with shaking unit maintained at temperature 29°+2°C. The growth was observed after 3 days. The three days old contents were used as inoculum.<br>
The solid waste was mixed with aqueous nutrient media same as used in preparation of inoculum at the level corresponding to the water activity assuring maximum growth of the fungus. The moist solid waste (25g solid waste + 20 ml nutrient media) was charged in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks, closed with surgical cotton plug. These flasks were<br><br>
autoclaved to get sterile biomass and cooled to ambient temperature. These flasks were inoculated with 20-25 ml inoculum and incubated in a chamber maintaining at 29°+2°C. The fermentation was allowed for 8 - 10 days. A white-pink fungal mould growth was observed in Erlenmeyer flasks.<br>
The flasks were acidified to lower the pH to the extent of pH = 2 to 3.5, to avoid the formation of iso-gibberellic acid. The fermented solid mass was subjected to isolation of crude gibberellic acid using solid-liquid extraction process. The amount of gibberellic acid (GAs) isolated from solid state fermentation media was determined by a known method using high performance liquid chromatography, using reverse flow C -18 column and methanol as mobile phase.<br>
