Detailed Description<br>
[58]     Certain exemplary embodiments comprise a system comprising: an electrical<br>
isolator adapted to couple a processor of a programmable logic controller to a user load; a transistor adapted to provide switching of a control signal provided by the processor for the user load; a totem pole output coupling the electrical isolator and the transistor and adapted to switch a gate of the transistor; and a floating power supply adapted to provide a regulated DC voltage to the gate of the transistor.<br>
[59]     FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system 1000, which can comprise a processor 1100 of a programmable logic controller 1200. Control signals generated by the processor 1100 can be transmitted to a switch 1400 via an electrical isolator 1300 that can electrically isolate processor 1100 from switch 1400. Electrical isolator 1300 can be an optocoupler, such as an optocoupler comprising an open collector, and/or a magnetic coupler.<br>
[60]     Switch 1400 can comprise a transistor, such as a field effect transistor (e.g., a P-channel FET, an N-channel FET, a MOSFET, and/or a junction FET, etc.) or a bipolar junction transistor, and a totem pole output. A buffer and/or pull-up resistor can be coupled between electrical isolator 1300 and the switch 1400. The<br><br>
pull-up resistor can be coupled to a gate of the transistor and/or can prevent switching of the control signal during certain predetermined events. A pull-down capacitor can be coupled to the output of the optocoupler and/or can prevent switching of the control signal during certain predetermined events.<br>
[61]     In certain exemplary embodiments, a protective resistor can coupled between the totem pole output and the gate of the transistor. In certain exemplary embodiments, a pull-up resistor can be coupled to a conductor running between the reference pin of the transistor and the gate of the transistor and also coupled to a diode coupled in series with a zener diode connected between the gate of the transistor and a load side pin of the transistor. The pull-up resistor can be adapted to turn-on the transistor to absorb an inductive kick-back from an inductive user load. The first protective resistor can be adapted to prevent an inductive kickback from damaging the totem pole output, and/or to effect a turn-off speed of the transistor.<br>
[62]     When switched on, switch 1400 can allow the control signals to continue to one or more user loads 1500. Power for the gate of the switch 1400 can come from a floating regulated DC power supply 1700 that is referenced to switch 1400, which can be referenced to a user load power supply 1600. Power supply 1700 can be electrically isolated from processor 1100.<br>
[63]     The control signal can comprise a series of pulses having a frequency that is greater than approximately 20,000 pulses per second, such as approximately and/or greater than approximately 21,000; 25,000; 30,000; 40,000; 50,000; 60,000; 70,000; 80,000; 90,000; 100,000; etc., including all values and subranges therebetween.<br>
[64]     User load power supply 1600 can be operable from less than approximately 6<br>
volts to greater than approximately 21 volts. Thus, user load power supply 1600 can be operable at approximately 0; 3; 4.5; 5, etc., volts including all values and<br><br>
subranges therebetween (e.g., less than approximately 5 volts; approximately 0 to approximately 4.48 volts; etc.) and at approximately 23; 24; 25.8; 27; 30; 100; 1000, etc., volts, including all values and subranges therebetween.<br>
[65]     FIG. 2 is a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method 2000. At activity 2100, a processor is electrically isolated from a user load. At activity 2200, a signal for controlling the user load is generated. At activity 2300, the control signal is switched. At activity 2400, the control signal is provided to the user load. At activity 2500, inductive kick-back generated by inductive user loads is prevented from reaching and/or damaging the switch.<br>
[66]     FIG. 3 is a schematic of an exemplary embodiment of a DC output circuit and floating power supply 3000, that can provide a high speed wide voltage range sourcing output 3100 that is isolated from the logic control 3200. Output 3100 can be capable of switching at up to approximately 100,000 pulses per second or greater. Output 3100 can work with any voltage and/or voltage range desired from the user load power supply 3150, such as from approximately 0V up to approximately 30V and/or from approximately 0V up to approximately 1000V, including all values and subranges therebetween. Output 3100 can be capable of controlling user loads 3125 that are inductive loads and/or withstanding inductive kickback.<br>
[67]     Certain exemplary embodiments can use high-speed optocouplers 3300 that are open collector (which can be less expensive than high speed optocouplers with totem pole outputs). However, the open collector optocoupler might not be able to turn the gate of P-Channel FET 3400 off quickly. So, a buffer 3500 with a totem pole output 3600 can be added between optocoupler 3300 and the gate 3410 of P-Channel FET 3400. Pull-up resistors 3710 and 3740, shown added to open collector 3310 on optocoupler 3300 and gate 3410 of FET 3400, can ensure that output 3100 would be off during power-up, power-down, and/or when the logic circuit 3200 was not on or powered. A pull-down capacitor 3720 on open<br><br>
collector 3310 of the optocoupler 3300 can prevent output 3100 from turning on during the presence of fast transient and/or burst noise.<br>
[68]     Certain exemplary embodiments can control inductive loads. A zener diode 3730 and diode 3750 can connect from gate 3410 to the drain 3420 of P-channel FET 3400. When an inductive load is turned off, inductive forces can maintain the current that had been flowing while the load was on by increasing the voltage in the negative direction. The zener 3730 can clamp when the voltage becomes large enough to turn zener 3730, diode 3750 and gate 3410 on by conducting current through resistors 3740 and/or 3760. When the gate 3410 is on enough, the transistor 3400 can leak some current to the load to dissipate kickback energy of the user load 3125 that is an inductive load.<br>
[69]     The output current of buffer 3500 might exceed its rating during this time because the buffer 3500 is turning gate 3410 off (high) and zener 3730 is trying to pull gate 3410 on (low). In order to prevent this occurrence, resistor 3760 can be added in between buffer 3500 and gate 3410. Resistor 3760 can effect the turn-off speed of FET output 3100.<br>
[70]     In certain exemplary embodiments, since optocoupler 3300 and buffer 3500 can operate specifically with approximately 5 volts of regulated DC power, the circuit can include a P-Channel FET 3400 saturated in the on-state with approximately 5 volts on gate 3410.<br>
[71]     In certain exemplary embodiments, a power supply 3800 can generate a regulated output of approximately 5 volts. Power supply 3800 can operate from approximately 0 volts up to approximately 30 DC volts of user load power supply 3150.<br>
[72]     Certain exemplary embodimentscan include an isolated floating power supply<br>
3800. A push-pull switching regulator integrated circuit3810, transformer 3820,<br><br>
and/or diodes 3830 and 3835 can convert a regulated voltage 3850 into an isolated unregulated voltage 3860. A regulator 3840 can regulate this voltage 3870. This output 3870 of the power supply 3800 can be referenced to the positive of the user load power supply 3150. The return 3880 of the power supply 3800 can be floating and always below the incoming voltage of the user load power supply 3150 no matter if the user load power supply 3150 voltage is 0V or 30V. Power supply 3800 can be used to supply power for numerous gates 3410 of transistors 3400 that are connected to the same user load power supply 3150.<br>
[73]     FIG, 4 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a system 1000, and is identical to FIG. 1 except that programmable logic controller 1200 is shown as not comprising numbered elements other than processor 1100. That is, the numbered elements comprised by components of programmable logic controller 1200 can be varied.<br>
