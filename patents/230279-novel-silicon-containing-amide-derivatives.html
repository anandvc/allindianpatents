WO 2OO5/O28485	PCT/EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br><br>
The symmetrical nature of Cyl, Cy2, Cy4, Cy5&gt; Cy7, Cy8, Cyll, Cyl2? Cyl3, Cyl 6, Cy20, Cy21 and Cy22 means that it does not matter which arrow represents a bond to the moiety (CRaRb)m and which arrow represents a bond to the moiety (CRcRd)n. However Cy3, Cy6, Cy9, CylO, Cyl4, Cyl5, Cyl7, Cyl8, Cyl9, Cy23 and Cy24 are not symmetric and therefore it does matter which arrow represents a bond to the moiety (CRaRb)m and which arrow represents a bond to the moiety (CRcRd)n; for these values of Cy, it is preferred that the arrow labelled "a" represents a bond to the moiety  (CRaRb) [and therefore that the arrow labelled "b" represents a bond to the moiety(CRcRd)n]. In this specification Cy3a is the group Cy3 in which the arrow "a" represents a bond to the moiety  (CRaRb) whilst Cy3b is the group Cy3 in which the arrow "b" represents a bond to the moiety (CRaRb)m. The same applies mutatis mutandis to Cy6, Cy9, Cyl0, Cyl4, Cyl5, Cyl7, Cyl8, Cyl9, Cy23 and Cy24. In all instances, the "a" group is preferred to the corresponding "b" group.<br>

Preferably q is 0.<br>
Preferably r is 0 or 1; more preferably r is 0.<br>
Preferably s is 0.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is an N-oxide then it is preferred that Het is pyridinyl substituted by one to three groups R4.<br>
Throughout this description, Me is used to represent the methyl group. Likewise, Et represents the ethyl group.<br>
Compounds of formula (II)<br><br>
where RING, r, R and R are as defined above and A is NH2, NHCH(O), optionally substituted(C1-C4)alkylC(=O)NH, optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylOC(==O)NH, halogen, NO2 OSO2CF3 or N=C(C6H5)2 are useful as intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Compounds of formula (II) where R3 is bound to a carbon atom in a position ortho to I arc novel and are preferred as intermediates for  the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Therefore, in another aspect the present invention provides a compound of formula (II) where RING, r, R2 and R3 are as defined above and A is NH2, NHCH(O), optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylC(=O)]SIH, optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylOC(=O)NH, Br, I, NO2, OSO2CF3 or N=C(C6H5)2 and R3 is bound to a carbon atom in a position ortho to A.<br>

The compounds according to the present invention may be prepared according to the following reaction schemes, in which, unless otherwise stated, the definition of each variable is as defined above for a compound of formula (I).<br>
There are a number of alternative methods for preparing a compound of formula (I).<br>
Method A<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) [in which A is NH2, NHCH(O), optionally substituted (C1-4)aIkyIC(=O)NH or optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylOC(=O)NH] with a compound of formula Het-C(=O)OR* [where R' is C1.5 alkyl] in the presence of a strong base [for example NaH or sodium hexamethyldisilazane], in a dry polar solvent [preferably THF] and at a temperature between -1O°C and the boiling point of the solvent [preferably at ambient temperature]. The article by J.Wang et al [Synlett 2OO1, 1485] provides details of analogous preparations. When A is NHCH(O), optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylC(=O)NH or optionally substituted<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O28485<br><br>
PCT7EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br><br>
(C1-C4)alkylOC(=O)NH; and a compound of formula (I) in which R1 is H is desired, then hydrolysis according to Method E below must follow.<br>
Method B<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) [where A is as defined above in Method A] with a compound of formula Het-C(=O)R" [where R" is OH or a leaving group, such as CI, Br, F or OC(=O)C1-4 alkyl] in an inert organic solvent [such as ethylacetate, dichloromethane, dioxane, THF or DMF] and at a temperature between -1O°C and the boiling point of the solvent [preferably at ambient temperature]. If R" is OH, then the reaction is carried out in the presence of an activating agent [for example BOP-C1] and two equivalents of a base [such as a tertiary amine, an inorganic carbonate or a hydrogen carbonate]. Alternatively, if R" is a leaving group, then the reaction is carried out in the presence of at least one equivalent of base [for example pyridine, a tertiary amine, an inorganic carbonate or a hydrogen carbonate; a stronger base, such as NaH or sodium hexamethyldisilazane is used when A is NHCH(O), optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylC(=O)NH or optionally substituted (C1-4)alkylOC(K))NH]. If a compound of formula (I) in which R1 is H is desired, then hydrolysis according to Method E must follow.<br>
Method C<br>
A compound of formula (I) [where R is as defined above but is nul hydrogen] may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I) [where R1 is hydrogen] with a compound of formula R1-L1 [where R1 is as defined above but is not hydrogen; and L1 is a leaving group, such as CI, Br, I, a sulfonate (for example a mesylate or a tosylate) or OC(O)C1-4 alkyl] in a solvent [such as an halogenated solvent (for example dichloromethane), an ether, ethylacetate, DMF or even water (as a biphasic mixture, optionally in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate)] and in the presence of a base [such as a tertiary amine, an alkali carbonate, an alkali bicarbonate, an alkali hydroxide or NaH; though when L1 is O(CO)C1-4 alkyl then simply heating without base is possible].<br>
Method D<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (It) [where A is halogen, preferably bromo or iodo] with a compound of formula Het-C(=O)NH2 in the presence of a Cu(I) compound and an aprotic solvent [such as a cyclic ether, for example dioxane] at an elevated temperature and preferably at reflux. It is preferred that Cul is used at 2% to 100%mole/mole, relative to the compound of formula (II), in the presence of<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O28485	PCT/EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br>
a 1,2-diamine (such as 1,2-diamino cyclohexane or ethylene diamine) as a ligand-forming substance and at least one equivalent of abase (such as an alkali carbonate or an alkali phosphate). The article by A.Klapars et al. LAm.Chem.Soc. 123, 7727 (2OO1) provides details of analogous preparations.<br>
Method E<br>
A compound of formula (I) [where Rl is H] may be prepared from a compound of formula (I) [where R1 is as defined above, but is not H] by acidic or alkaline hydrolysis. For this purpose the compound is treated with aqueous acid or base, for example HC1, HBr or an organic hydroxide [such as sodium-, potassium-, calcium- or barium-hydroxide] in an appropriate solvent which is preferably mixable with water [for example THF, dioxane, a lower alcohol or water itself] at ambient or elevated temperatures.<br>
Method F A compound of formula (I) [where R1 is H] may be prepared from a compound of formula (II) [where A is N=C(C6H5)2  by converting A to NH2, for example according to methods described by J. Ahman et al. Tetrahedron Letters 38, 6363 (1997) and proceeding according to Method A or Method B, preferably without isolation or purification of the intermediates.<br>
Many compounds of formula (EI) or (IV) (R3 as defined above) which do not have additional substituents on the benzene or thiophene ring, have been described in the literature.<br><br>
A compound of formula (II) may be prepared either by introducing the appropriate functionality A' into a compound of formula (III) or (IV) and transforming it if necessary to the desired function A. Alternatively, and preferentially, a compound of formula (II) may be prepared by methods analogous to the literature methods for the preparation of compounds (III) and (IV) where the starting materials already have the appropriate substituent A' in place; these compounds are referred to as (IlIa) and (IVa). Often the reaction conditions and stoichiometry of the reagents must be modified to accommodate the additional substituent A'.<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O28485	PCT/EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br>
Afterwards, A' (if desired) is converted to A according to known methodology to give a compound of formula (II). The preferred synthetic strategy is depicted in the following schemes and is further described below:<br><br>
Step l:<br>
Some suitable methods for the preparation of a compound of formula (III) which can be used under modified conditions with the appropriate starting materials for the preparation of a compound of formula (Ha') are described in the following documents:<br>

A' is a group A, as defined above, or a precursor group of A, which is compatible with the reaction conditions of step 1 and which can be converted to A by known chemical methodology. Especially valuable precursor groups are free and protected OH and protected amino groups. References to useful protecting groups forphenoles and anilines are given e.g. in T.W. Green and P.G.M.Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd edition p.503-614 (Wiley 1999).<br>
Step2 : According to the nature of A', a compound of formula (IIa') may be converted to a compound of formula (Ha) (where A=NH2) [for example by catalytic hydrogenation or chemical reduction (A' is nitro) or deprotection (A' is protected amino group)]. A compound<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O28485	PCT/EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br>
of formula (Ila) (A-OSO2CF3) may be prepared by deprotection of the protected OH (if A' is protected OH) and converting he resultant compound of formula (Ha') (A=OH) to a triflate with triflic anhydride and a suitable base. A compound of formula (Ha) (A is OSO2CF3 or Halogen) may in a further step be converted to a compound of formula (Ha) (A=NH2) by using methodologies described by J. Ahman et al. Tetrahedron Letters 38, 6363 (1997) and X.Huang et al., Org.Lett.3, 3417 (2OO1) and references cited therein.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the novel compounds of formula (I) have, for practical purposes, a very advantageous spectrum of activities for protecting plants against diseases that are caused by fungi as well as by bacteria and viruses.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) tcan be used in the agricultural sector and related fields oi use as active ingredients for controlling plant pests. The novel compounds are distinguished by excellent activity at low rates of application, by being well tolerated by plants and by beinj environmentally safe. They have very useful curative, preventive and systemic properties and are used for protecting numerous cultivated plants. The compounds of formula I can be used to inhibit or destroy the pests that occur on plants or parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) of different crops of useful plants, while at the same time protecting also those parts of the plants that grow later, for example from phytopathogenie microorganisms.<br>
It is also possible to use compounds of formula (I) as dressing agents for the treatment of plant propagation material, in particular of seeds (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings (e.g. rice), for the protection against fungal infections as well as against phytopatho genie fungi occurring in the soil.<br>
Furthermore the compounds according to present invention may be used for controlling fungi in related areas, for example in the protection of technical materials, including wood and wood related technical products, in food storage, in hygiene management, etc. The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, effective against the phytopathogenic fungi of the following classes: Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Botrytis, Pyricularia, Hehninthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora and Alternaria) and Basidiomycetes (e.g. Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia). Additionally, they are also effective against the Ascomycetes classes (e.g. Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula) and of the Oomycetes classes (e.g. Phytophthora, Pythium, Plasmopara). Outstanding activity has been observed against powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Furthermore, the novel compounds of formula I are<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O28485<br><br>
PCT/EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br><br>
effective against phytopathogenic bacteria and viruses (e.g. against Xanthomonas spp, Pseudomonas spp, Erwinia amylovora as well as against the tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Within the scope of present invention, target crops to be protected typically comprise the following species of plants: cereal (wheat, barley, rye, oat, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, drupes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucumber plants (pumpkins, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnnamomum, camphor) or plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation. To this end they are conveniently formulated in known manner to emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granuiaies, and also encapsulations e.g. in polymeric substances. As with the type of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The compositions may also contain further adjuvants such as stabilizers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders or tackifiers as well as fertilizers, micronutrient donors or other formulations for obtaining special effects.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are substances useful in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers. Such carriers are for example described in WO97/3389O.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the crop area or plant to be treated, simultaneously or in succession with further compounds. These further compounds can be e.g. fertilizers or micronutrient donors or other preparations which influence the growth of plants. They can also be selective herbicides as well as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of<br><br>
WO 2OO5/O28485<br><br>
PCT/EP2OO4/O1OOO9<br><br>
several of these preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or application promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be mixed with other fungicides, resulting in some cases in unexpected synergistic activities. Mixing components which are particularly preferred are azoles, such as azaconazole, BAY 1412O, bitertanol, broxnuconazole, cyproconazole, difenoconazole, diniconazole, epoxiconazole, fenbuconazole, fluqumconazole, flusilazole, flutriafol, hexaconazole, imazalil, imibeaconazole, ipconazole, metconazole, myclobutanil, pefurazoate, penconazole, pyrifenox, prochloraz, propiconazole, simeconazole, tebuconazole, tetraconazole, triadimefon, triadimenol, triflumizole, triticonazole; pyrimidinyl carbinole, such as ancymidol, fenarimol, nuarimol; 2-amino-pyrimidines, such as bupirimate, dimethirimol, ethirimol; morpholines, such as dodemorph, fenpropidine, fenpropimorph, spiroxamine, tridemorph; anilinopyrimidines, such as cyprodinil, mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil; pyrroles, such as fenpiclonil, fludioxonil; phenylamides, such as benalaxyl, furalaxyl, metalaxyl, R-metalaxyl, oiurace, oxadixyl; benzimidazoles, such as benomyl, carbendazim, debacarb, Albendazole, thiabendazole; dicarboximides, such as chlozolinate, dichlozoline, iprodione, myclozoline, procymidone, vinclozoline; carboxamides, such as carboxin, fenfuram, flutolanil, mepronil, oxycarboxin, thifluzamide; guanidines, such as guazatine, dodine, iminoctadine; strobilurines, such as azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, metominostrobin, SSF-129, trifloxystrobin, picoxystrobin, BAS 5OOF (proposed name pyraclostrobin), BAS 520; dithiocarbamates, such as ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, metiram, propineb, thiram, zineb, ziram; N-halomethylthiotetrahydro-phthalimides, such as captafol, captan, dichlofluanid, fluoromides, folpet, tolyfluanid; Cu-compounds, such as Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, copper sulfate, cuprous oxide, mancopper, oxine-copper; nitrophenol-derivatives, such as dinocap, nitrothal-isopropyl; organo-p-derivatives, such as edifenphos, iprobenphos, isoprothiolane, phosdiphen, pyrazophos, tolclofos-methyl; various others, such as acibenzolar-S-methyl, anilazine, benthiavalicarb, blasticidin-S, chinomethionate, chloroneb, chlorothalonil, cyflufenamid, cymoxanil, dichlone, diclomezine, dicloran, diethofencaxb, dimethomorph, SYP-LI90 (proposed name: flumoiph), dithianon, ethaboxam, etridiazole, famoxadone, fenamidone, fenoxanil, fentin, ferimzone, fluazinam, flusulfamide, fenhexamid, fosetyl-aluminium, hymexazol, iprovalicarb, IKF-916 (cyazofamid), kasugamycin, methasulfocarb, metrafenone, nicobifen, pencycuron, phthalide, polyoxins, probenazole, propamocarb,<br><br>

A preferred method of applying a compound of formula (I), or an agrochemical composition which contains at least one of said compounds, is foliar application. The frequency of application and the rate of application will depend on the risk of infestation by the corresponding pathogen. However, the compounds of formula I can also penetrate the plant through the roots via the soil (systemic action) by drenching the locus of the plant with a liquid formulation, or by applying the compounds in solid form to the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application). In crops of water rice such granulates can be applied to the flooded rice field. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seeds (coating) by impregnating the seeds or tubers either with a liquid formulation of the fungicide or coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
A formulation [that is, a composition containing the compound of formula (I)] and, if desired, a solid or liquid adjuvant, is prepared in a known manner, typically by intimately mixing and/or grinding the compound with extenders, for example solvents, solid carriers and, optionally, surface active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The agrochemical formulations will usually contain from  0.1 to 99% by weight, preferably Hum 0.1 Lo 95% by weight, of the compound of formula 1, 99.9 to 1% by weight, preferably 99.8 to 5% by weight of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and from 0  to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 5g to 2kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from l0g to 1kg a.i./ha, most preferably from 20g to 600g a.i./ha. When used as seed drenching agent, convenient dosages are from l0mg to Ig of active substance per kg of seeds.<br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
The following non-limiting Examples illustrate the above-described invention in more detail.<br>

Surprisingly, it has now been found that the novel compounds of formula (I) have, for practical purposes, a very advantageous spectrum of activities for protecting plants against diseases that are caused by fungi as well as by bacteria and viruses.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) tcan be used in the agricultural sector and related fields oi use as active ingredients for controlling plant pests. The novel compounds are distinguished by excellent activity at low rates of application, by being well tolerated by plants and by beinj environmentally safe. They have very useful curative, preventive and systemic properties and are used for protecting numerous cultivated plants. The compounds of formula I can be used to inhibit or destroy the pests that occur on plants or parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) of different crops of useful plants, while at the same time protecting also those parts of the plants that grow later, for example from phytopathogenie microorganisms.<br>
It is also possible to use compounds of formula (I) as dressing agents for the treatment of plant propagation material, in particular of seeds (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings (e.g. rice), for the protection against fungal infections as well as against phytopatho genie fungi occurring in the soil.<br>
Furthermore the compounds according to present invention may be used for controlling fungi in related areas, for example in the protection of technical materials, including wood and wood related technical products, in food storage, in hygiene management, etc. The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, effective against the phytopathogenic fungi of the following classes: Fungi imperfect! (e.g. Botrytis, Pyricularia, Helminthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora and Alternaria) and Basidiomycetes (e.g. Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia). Additionally, they are also effective against the Ascomycetes classes (e.g. Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula) and of the Oomycetes classes (e.g. Phytophthora, Pythium, Plasmopara). Outstanding activity has been observed against powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Furthermore, the novel compounds of formula I are<br><br>
WO 2005/028485	PCT/EP2004/010009<br>
effective against phytopathogenic bacteria and viruses (e.g. against Xanthomonas spp, Pseudomonas spp, Erwinia amylovora as well as against the tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Within the scope of present invention, target crops to be protected typically comprise the following species of plants: cereal (wheat, barley, rye, oat, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, drupes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucumber plants (pumpkins, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamomum, camphor) or plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation. To this end they are conveniently formulated in known manner to emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granuiaies, and also encapsulations e.g. in polymeric substances. As with the type of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The compositions may also contain further adjuvants such as stabilizers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders or tackifiers as well as fertilizers, micronutrient donors or other formulations for obtaining special effects.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are substances useful in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers. Such carriers are for example described in WO97/33890.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the crop area or plant to be treated, simultaneously or in succession with further compounds. These further compounds can be e.g. fertilizers or micronutrient donors or other preparations which influence the growth of plants. They can also be selective herbicides as well as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of<br><br>
WO 2005/028485	PCT/EP2004/010009<br>
several of these preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or application promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of foimulation.<br>

A preferred method of applying a compound of formula (I), or an agrochemical composition which contains at least one of said compounds, is foliar application. The frequency of application and the rate of application will depend on the risk of infestation by the corresponding pathogen. However, the compounds of formula I can also penetrate the plant through the roots via the soil (systemic action) by drenching the locus of the plant with a liquid formulation, or by applying the compounds in solid form to the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application). In crops of water rice such granulates can be applied to the flooded rice field. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seeds (coating) by impregnating the seeds or tubers either with a liquid formulation of the fungicide or coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
A formulation [that is, a composition containing the compound of formula (I)] and, if desired, a solid or liquid adjuvant, is prepared in a known manner, typically by intimately mixing and/or grinding the compound with extenders, for example solvents, solid carriers and, optionally, surface active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The agrochemical formulations will usually contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, preferably Hum 0.1 Lo 95% by weight, of the compound of formula 1, 99.9 to 1% by weight, preferably 99.8 to 5% by weight of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 5g to 2kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from l0g to 1kg a.i./ha, most preferably from 20g to 600g a.i./ha. When used as seed drenching agent, convenient dosages are from l0mg to Ig of active substance per kg of seeds.<br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
The following non-limiting Examples illustrate the above-described invention in more detail.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This Example illustrates the preparation of Compound Numbers 28.83a, 28.63a and 1.61a.<br>
Step A : U-Dimethvl-3-(2’-nitro)phenvl-silacyclohexene-2 [Compound 28.83a1.<br><br>
WO 2005/028485	PCT/EP2004/010009<br>
2-Nitro-phenylacetylene (prepared according to Synthesis 1980,627) (25g), 1,1-dimethy-l-silacyclobutane (21.9ml) and PdCl2((Ph3P)2 (9.5g) were refluxed in 450 ml dry toluiene under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 3 hours. After cooling to room temperature the solvent was evaporated and the residue (51.8g) was chromatographed over 13kg of silica gel (eluent: hexane:ethylacetate::39:l). An olive green oil (19.9g) was isolated, which contained (according to nmr) 60% of Compound 28.83a. This material was used directly in the next step.<br>
Step B: U-Dimethvl-3-(2’-amino)phenvl-silacvclohexane [Compound 28.63a].<br>
The product of step A was hydrogenated in THF over Pd (10% on carbon) at athmospheric pressure and room temperature. Filtration of the catalyst, evaporation of the solvent and chromatography over silica gel (eluent: hexane:ethylacetate::19:l) yielded Compound 28.63a (5.75g).<br>
Step C: Compound Number 1.61a<br>
Compound Number 28.63a (0.17g) was dissolved in THF (5ml). N-Methyl-3-difluoromethyl-4-chlorocarbonyl-pyrazole (0.15g) was added and then pyridine (0.062ml) was added while cooling with ice. The resultant white suspension was stirred overnight, poured on to water, extracted with ethyl acetate and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated and the residue (03g) chromatographed on silica gel (eluent: hexane:ethyl acetate::2:l) to yield Compound Number 1.61a (0.26g) melting at 117-119°C.<br>
An analogous reaction sequence [but starting from 1-methyl-1-ethyl-silacyclobutane or 1-methyl-1-ethenyl-silycyclobutane instead of 1,1-dimethy-l-silacyclobutane] was used to prepare Compound Numbers 28.87a, 28.86a and 1.96a.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This Example illustrates the preparation of Compound Numbers 28.82a, and 1.94a. Step A: 1 J-Dimethvl-3-(2’-amino)phenvl-silacvclohexene-2 [Compound 28.82a1.<br>
The product from Example 1 step A (1.5g) was dissolved in ethanol (50ml; 50% by volume) to which powdered iron (1.5g) was added. The resultant suspension was heated to reflux. At this temperature HC1 (0.35ml; 2N), dissoved in ethanol (3.5ml, 50% by volume) was added over 10 minutes and the resultant mixture was refluxed overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension was filtered, neutralised with bicarbonate, extracted with<br><br>

WO 2005/028485	PCT/EP2004/010009<br>
Compound 28.5 (3.5g) was dissolved in methanol (95ml) and then sodium acetate (L9g) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (1.2g) were added in sequence. After stirring for 75 minutes at room temperature, the mixture was poured on to sodium hydroxide (500ml, 0.1N in water) and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. Work-up as described in Step B and chromatography of the semi solid residue (3.8g) on silica gel (eluent: hexane:ethyl acetate: 9:1) gave Compound 28.2 (1.9g) as an oil. Step D: Compound 5.3<br>
This compound was prepared from 1xans-l-(2’-amino-phenyI)-2-trimethylsilyl-cyclopropane [Compound 28.2] (0.25g) and 2-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorocarbonyl-thiazole (0.28g) as described in Example 1 step C. The yield was 0.45g of off-white cristals melting at.61-64°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This Example illustrates the preparation of Compound Number 3.3.<br>
N-Methyl-4-trifluormethyl-3- pyrrole carboxylic acid (0.24g), Compound 28.2 (0.25g) and triethyl amine (0.34ml) were dissolved in dry dichloromethane (25ml), cooled with ice and treated with bis-(2-oxo-3oxazolidinyl-phosphinic acid chloride (0.3 lg). The resultant suspension was stirred for 1 hour in an icebath and for 15 hours at room temperature. Then the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (250ml) and then saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (125ml) was added. The organic phase was separated and dried with sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent and chromatography of the residue (0.45g of a yellow oil) on silica gel (eluent: hexane:ethyl acetate::2:l) yielded Compound 2.3 (0.2g) as an oil.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
This Example illustrates the preparation of Compound Number 1.84.<br>
2-Amino-(4’ trimethylsilylethinyl)biphenyl was prepared from 2-amino-4’-bromobiphenyl in analogy to the method described by Sonagashira (Synthesis 1980,627). This compound was reacted with N-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorocarbonyl-pyrazole in an analogous manner to that described in Example 1 Step C to yield an amide (m.p.l51-153°C). This amide (0.5g) was then dissolved in THF (10ml) and was then hydrogenated over Pd (0.1g;10% on carbon) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove the catalyst and the solvent was evaporated. The residue (0.52g of off-white crystals) was chromatographed on silica gel (eluent: hexane:ethyl acetate::2:l) to yield Compound 1.84 (0.43g) (mp. 119-121°C).<br><br>
WO 2005/028485	PCT/EP2004/010009<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The Example illustrates the preparation of Compound Numbers 1.12 and 1.13.<br>
Compound Number 1.4 (lg) [prepared in a manner analogous to Example 3 Step D by using N-methyl-3-difluoromethyl-4-chlorocarbonyl pyrazol as coupling partner for Compound Number 28.2J was dissolved in dry THF (50ml) and sodium hydride (0.13g as a 55% suspension in mineral oil) were added cautiously. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient teperature for 2.5 hours. Then propargyl bromide (0.23g) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant suspension was diluted with ethyl acetate (200ml) and washed with water, dried with sodium sulfate and then the solvent was evaporated. The residue (1.25 g as a yellow oil) was chrornatographed on silica gel (solvent: hexane;ethyl acetate 2:1) to yield Compound Number 1.12 (0.47g) and Compound Number 1.13 (0.52g), both as light yellow oils.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
The Example illustrates the preparation of the pure enantiomers of Compound Number 1.4.<br>
Racemic Compound Number 1.4 [see example 6 for preparation] ( 0.1 g per injection) was separated on a preparative chiral HPLC coloumn under the following conditions: colounm: Chiraccl™ OD (Daicel™) 5x50; eluent: n-hexane/2-propanol 70:30; stream: 30 ml/min. After manual separation ofthe 2 peaks the solvent was evaporated. The residue was taken up in diisopropyl ether anf filtered. Evaporation of the solvent yielded the pure enantiomers; Compound Number 1.4A [specific rotation: -89.1 (c=12.4g/l)] and Compound Number 1.4B [specific rotation: +87.7 (c=l l.lg/1)], each as a colourless oil.<br>
