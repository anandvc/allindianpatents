DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, a processing method of a disassembling apparatus of an electronic appliance in an embodiment of the invention is described below.  For the sake of convenience, the electronic appliance is represented by an example of a television receiver.<br>
Fig. 1 is a conceptual block diagram of a disassembling apparatus of an electronic appliance in an embodiment of the invention.  Fig. 2 is a plan view of Fig. 1.  Fig. 3 is a flowchart of Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1 through Fig. 3, the television receiver is mounted on a conveying pallet, and is conveyed from the lower right corner to the upper left corner in Fig. 1 by the conveyor, for example, chain conveyors stretched parallel.  In the conveying process, the steps from removal of back cover to peeling and removal of adhesive tape are half automated.  Each step of the process shown in Fig. 3<br>
- 30 -<br><br>
is described below.  Reference numerals 1 to 12 shown in Fig. 2 refer to the step numbers.<br>
(a)	Step 1:  Loading device<br>
At step 1, a discarded television receiver is discharged by mounting on a conveying pallet by means of a loading device.  In this embodiment, it is mounted on the conveying pallet manually. Of course, it is possible to detect automatically a discarded television receiver conveyed by a conveyor or the like, and mount automatically on a conveying pallet by a loading device.  A lifting robot of discarded television receiver may be composed freely so as to, for example, suck the CRT surface by vacuum, or hold the both sides of the cabinet (housing ) by two arms.<br>
(b)	Steps 2 to 4: Tilting device, cleaning device, tilting<br>
device<br>
At step 2, of two tiltable work benches, a conveying pallet mounting a television receiver is delivered into the work bench of the side in which the conveying pallet has not been delivered yet. The worker removes the back cover of the housing positioned at the rear side of the housing (cabinet) for composing the television receiver.<br>
At step 3. dust collected in the discarded television receiver is automatically removed by air blow.<br>
At step 4, again, the television receiver is mounted together with the conveying pallet on the tiltable work bench, and the deflecting yoke (DY), chassis and others are removed manually.<br>
- 31 -<br><br>
The members after removing the back cover, DY and others are mounted on the conveyor, and automatically discharged as specified.<br>
Referring next to Fig. 4 through Fig. 8, an embodiment of tilting device and cleaning device is described below.  Fig. 4 is a side view of concept of tiltable work bench and cleaning device composed in the embodiment.  Fig. 5 is an essential plan view of Fig. 4.  Fig. 6 is an essential side view of the tiltable work bench. Fig. 7 is a plan view of Fig. 6.  Fig. 8 is an essential side view of the cleaning device.<br>
In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. a television receiver 100 is mounted on a conveying pallet 2, and is conveyed from the left to right direction in Fig. 5 by means of a conveyor 1.  The television receiver 100 comprising a cabinet 101 and a back cover 102 delivered up to before a work bench 40 (left side in Fig. 5)is transferred from the conveyor 1 onto the first tiltable work bench 40 together with the pallet 2, by an automatic transfer device, for example, a belt conveyor (not shown) driven in a direction orthogonal to chain conveyors stretched parallel.  The worker is positioned before the tiltable work bench 40.<br>
After the worker confirms that the television receiver 100 has been transferred, a start signal is sent by pressing, for example, a foot switch (not shown), so that the work bench 40 is tilted to a specified angle, for example, in a range of about 45 degrees to 75 degrees.  By tilting of the work bench 40, the television receiver 100 mounted nearly in the center of the work<br>
- 32 -<br><br>
bench slides on the conveying pallet, and hits against a stopper 32, and is positioned in a range accessible by the worker.  Then the worker removes the back cover 102.  After the work, the work bench is put back in horizontal state, and the conveying pallet 2 mounting the television receiver is returned onto the conveying  by the automatic transfer device-  The returned television receiver is delivered into a cleaning device 45 of next step by the conveyor 2.<br>
In the case of a small-sized television receiver of about 14 inches to 20 inches, meanwhile, it is possible to work in horizontal state without tilting the work bench 40.  In the case of a large-sized television receiver, it is designed so that the tilting angle may be set freely by the worker depending on the model or outline shape.<br>
In Fig. 5. the work bench 40 is installed before and after the two cleaning devices 45 each.  A first reason is to have a margin in the disassembling processing capacity of television receiver.  That is, by this constitution, the working personnel can be increased depending on the processing amount.  A second reason is to receive the conveyed television receiver on other work bench if next television receiver to be disassembled is conveyed while disassembling work is done on one of the two adjacent work benches. That is, the disassembling time varies with the size and type of the television receiver.  Therefore, if a longer time than a specific processing time is taken, other working bench of two working benches functions as a spare one.  In this case, as a matter of course, the<br>
- 33 -<br><br>
worker moves to the adjacent work bench and handles.<br>
The structure of the tiltable work bench 40 is described specifically by referring to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.  In Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the work bench 40 is composed of a base frame 31, parallel belt conveyors 39, 39 assembled into the frame 31, a drive cylinder 33 installed in the lower side of the frame 31, and a base frame 34.<br>
The belt conveyor 39 is composed of two parallel belts, and the belt conveyor 39 transfers the conveying pallet 2 nearly to the stopper 32, and stops automatically.<br>
The frame 31 is mounted on the hinge so that the one end side may be rotatable, by means of a bearing 35 and a shaft 36. At the other end side of the frame 31,  a rod end member of the cylinder 33 is fitted on hinge through a shaft 37.  The other end of the cylinder 33 is fitted to the frame 34 through a shaft 38.  Thus is composed a link mechanism for rotating at each fulcrum.<br>
In this constitution, when a fluid pressure such as air or oil pressure is supplied to the cylinder 33, the piston rod of the cylinder moves, and the frame 31 is tilted to a specified angle. The television receiver 100 or a large-sized television receiver 100A is mounted on the pallet 2.<br>
As the mean for tilting the frame 31. other arbitrary constitution may be employed.  For example, the plate may be tilted by fitting an eccentric disk on the motor shaft.  Or the plate may be tilted by a cam mechanism or the like (neither shown).<br>
The cleaning process is described below.  In Fig. 8, the<br>
- 34 -<br><br>
television receiver 100 having cabinet 101 and CRT 103 being mounted on the conveying pallet 2 and conveyed to specified position by the conveyor 1 is isolated from the surrounding almost in airtight state by an enclosed box 46 descending from above.  Near the ceiling of the enclosed box 46, a spray nozzle 47 and an exhaust duct 48 are disclosed.  In this way, the cleaning device 45 is constituted.<br>
Afterwards, a high pressure air shower 49 is injected toward the television receiver 100 from a plurality of spray nozzles 47 disposed near the ceiling.  This high pressure air shower 49 blows off dust deposits from the components including the electron gun neck, DY and funnel of CRT, inside of cabinet, printed wiring board contained in cabinet, wiring, and others.  Simultaneously with air injection, the exhaust duct 48 is put in operation, and floating dust is sucked and discharged.  The air injection time is set at about 5 seconds to scores of seconds.<br>
After cleaning of the television receiver, the enclosed box is raised, and the television receiver mounted on the conveying pallet 2 is sent to next step by the conveyor 1.<br>
At the next step, again, the television receiver is sent into a tiltable second work bench (the work bench located at the right side of the cleaning device in Fig. 5) together with the conveying pallet.  On this second work bench 40, the DY unit (the deflecting yoke, neck printed board, etc.) and chassis furnished to the neck of the CRT are removed.  In the DY unit removing step, since the inside of the television receiver is cleaned beforehand.<br>
- 35 -<br><br>
floating dust is decreased substantially, and hence there is no adverse effect on the working environments and equipment.<br>
After dismounting the DY unit and others, the CRT attached to the cabinet is sent forward to next step of cabinet cutting process and CRT dismounting process by the conveyor together with the conveying pallet.<br>
In this way, according to steps 2 to 4 in Fig. 3, dismounting of back cover and DY unit, and dust removal in the cabinet can be done efficiently, and the subsequent disassembling procedure can be automated.  Besides, the tiltable work bench can pretreat the television receivers in various inch sizes and shapes efficiently.<br>
(c) Step 5:  Bottom plate cutting device<br>
At step 5, the bottom plate of the wooden cabinet is cut in a U-form, so that the CRT can be drawn out easily.  Referring now to Fig. 9 through Fig. 14, an embodiment of a housing bottom plate cutting (housing disassembling) device is explained.  Fig. 9 is a flowchart of disassembling process of television receiver in an embodiment of the invention.  Fig. 10 is an essential plan view of a housing disassembling device in an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 11 is an essential side view of Fig. 10.  Fig. 12 is a perspective view of a process for forming a U-form cutting groove in the principal plane (bottom plane/bottom plate) of the housing for disassembling the housing of a video appliance.  Fig. 13 is a perspective view of an opened state of the bottom plane (bottom plate) after finishing the process of the cutting groove.  Fig. 14<br>
- 36 -<br><br>
shows a disassembled state of opening four principal planes of the housing.<br>
The television receiver 100 shown in Fig. 9 through Fig. 13 is composed of a cathode-ray tube 51 (or CRT), a housing (cabinet) 50 connected to the end of the outer circumference of the CRT 51 by screws, a chassis (including control circuit) 52 accommodated in the housing 50, a speaker unit 55 installed near the CRT 51. an antenna terminal board 54, a tuner 56, and printed wiring boards 53, 57 mounted on side plate, among others.  In the CRT 51, as shown in Fig. 13, a metal band (reinforcing band for preventing implosion) 58 is wound on the outer circumference (the end of the display screen surface), and mounting tabs 59 are disposed at four positions by spot welding or other means.<br>
The disassembling procedure of the housing of such general television receiver (or TV) is described below.  Fig. 9 is a flowchart of "cutting groove processing, disassembling, and constituent member dismounting" of the TV housing.  Fig. 10 shows the state of mounting a discarded TV on the conveying pallet 2, and transferring to the specified position, that is, step 2A.<br>
Consequently, by the air cylinder 9, the conveying pallet 2 put on the plate 10 placed at the leading end of the air cylinder 9 is raised above the conveyor 1 (step 3A).  Then, the housing 50 of the discarded TV is positioned in the X-axis and Y-axis direction (position establishing: step 4A).<br>
Positioning of the housing 50 in the Y-axis direction is<br>
- 37 -<br><br>
effected by the Y-axis direction positioning means 6 having two confronting air cylinders 4, 4, and plates 5, 5 mounted at the ends of the cylinders 4.  The timing is controlled, of course, so that either one of the two air cylinders may advance first to the specified position, so that the other air cylinder may advance later. Positioning in the X-axis direction is similarly effected by X-axis direction positioning means 3.  This positioning is executed at a specified timing by means of an air cylinder 7 moving up and down in the Z-axis direction, an air cylinder in the X-axis direction not shown, and a plate 8 fitted to the end of the cylinder 7.<br>
Consequently, the dimensions of the housing established in position in the X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis direction are measured (step 5A: position measurement of principal planes).  Measurement of position of principal planes is a step to be ready for cutting groove process at next step 6A, and a non-contact sensor, such as laser beam sensor, or ultrasonic sensor is used.  By operating X-axis direction sensor 14, Y-axis direction sensor 15, and Z-axis direction sensor 16, principal planes (bottom, top, both sides) of the housing 50 are measured and identified.  On the basis of the position identification data, a cutting tool 13 such as end mill is driven as specified.<br>
In groove cutting at step 6A, the principal planes of the housing 50 are cut by cutting means (at least one means of, for example, end mill processing of high speed rotation, laser processing, and water jet processing).  Rotating and driving means 12<br>
- 38 -<br><br>
for rotating the cutting tool 13 as specified may be executed arbitrarily by using general 3-axis to 5-axis control robot 11 (for example, scalar robot).  The rotating speed of the end mill tool 13 is about hundreds to 25,000 rpm when the tool diameter is 3 mm to 20 mm.  Preferably, for the end mill tool of 12 mm in diameter, the rotating speed is about 8.000 rpm to 10,000 rpm.  In Fig. 12, a U-form cutting groove 60 is processed in the bottom (bottom plate) of the housing 50 by two each of rotating and driving means 12 and cutting tools (end mills) 13.  It is also possible to cut by using only one each of rotating and driving means 12 and cutting tool 13.<br>
A folded open state of bottom of the housing is shown in Fig. 13.  Afterwards, by executing sequentially from step 7A (a step for lowering the conveying pallet) to step 8A (a step for transferring the conveying pallet to next process), one cycle of cutting groove process into the housing is terminated.<br>
Later, in other process (other stage), the nuts clamping the mounting tab 59 are detached by robot (not shown) or manually.  In succession, the CRT 51, tuner 56, antenna terminal board 54, chassis 52, printed wiring board 53, and speaker unit 55 are dismounted manually or by robot (neither shown).  Then it is transferred to the classification and regeneration process of step 9A.<br>
Meanwhile, folding and opening operation of the principal planes of the housing 50 and dismounting operation of constituent members should be preferably done in other process than cutting groove processing, but may be done in the same process as the cutt-<br>
- 39 -<br><br>
ing process.  In the flow in Fig. 9, exchange, addition or deletion of steps may be done as desired.<br>
The shape and forming position of the cutting groove are not particularly limited, and it may be formed in any desired shape and position.  For example, the groove may be formed while leaving occasional linking portions so that the principal planes may not collapse in the midst of processing, in ridges of four corners in the Z-axis direction (intersection of top and side, and intersection of bottom and side), X-axis direction, and Y-axis direction.<br>
Not limited to the bottom of the housing, a U-form cutting groove may be formed also on the top and both sides.  By the housing rotating means not shown, the housing may be rotated by 90 degrees repeatedly (rotation, measurement of position of principal planes, and cutting process).<br>
Fig. 14 shows the disassembled state by opening four principal planes of the housing.  Alternatively, by cutting only the ridges of the four corners in the Z-axis direction of the housing, the principal planes may be pushed down and opened by force in other process.<br>
According to the embodiment, when high speed rotating means such as end mill is used as the groove cutting tool, it can be operated in dry process without using water.<br>
Laser processing realizes three-dimensional processing more easily, and curvature processing can be done at high speed.  Water jet processing can be applied not only in cutting of housing, but<br>
- 40 -<br><br>
also in glass cutting of CRT.<br>
Thus, according to step 5 in Fig. 3, disassembling work of discarded TV (housing bottom plate cutting) can be automated.<br>
(d)	Steps 6 to 7:  CRT dismounting device to CRT transfer<br>
device<br>
At step 6, the worker removes tightening screws, and dismounts the CRT from the cabinet.  Peripheral parts (grounding wire, demagnetization coil, etc.) are also detached.  At step 7, the cabinet, removed parts, and CRT are conveyed to next CRT processing step on the conveying pallet.<br>
(e)	Step 8:  Electron gun cutting<br>
- At step 8, a diamond wheel of about 200 mm in outside diameter, and thickness of 2 mm or less is rotated at about 3,000 rpm to 5,000 rpm, and is forwarded straightly in one direction or in a moderate arc, so that the electron gun neck of the CRT is cut off. The separated electron gun is conveyed to the recycling process, while the CRT is sent to the next step.<br>
(f)	Step 9:  Metal band removing device<br>
At step 9, the metal band for prevention of implosion around the CRT is removed by high frequency heating.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 15 to Fig. 23, an embodiment of metal band removing device is described below.  Fig. 15 is a conceptual block diagram of disassembling process of metal band for prevention implosion of a cathode-ray tube in an embodiment of the invention, showing an essential block diagram of the disassembling apparatus as<br>

seen from the side direction.  Fig. 16 is an essential perspective view of disassembling apparatus of metal band for prevention of implosion in an embodiment of the invention.  Fig. 17 is a circuit diagram of an equivalent circuit of high frequency heating means for composing Fig. 16.  Fig. 18 is an essential side view of an example of cathode-ray tube used in explanation of the invention.  Fig. 19 is a flowchart of disassembling process in an embodiment of the invention.<br>
A cathode-ray tube 51 shown in Fig. 18 comprises a panel, a funnel, a neck, an implosion preventive metal band 58 wound around the panel, and mounting tabs 59 fitted at four corners of the implosion preventive metal band by spot welding.  The internal structure of the cathode-ray tube is not explained herein because it is not the main subject.<br>
In Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, the conveying pallet 2 is put on the conveying means of the conveyor 1, and is transferred by a specific constant pitch.  A high frequency heating device (specifically, high frequency induction heating device) 24 is installed at a specified position at the upper side of the conveyor 1.  Tab pressing means 21 acts to press the mounting tabs 59 always by a force of 4 kg to 6 kg when heating the implosion preventive metal band 58.  An induction heating coil 25 is installed in the high frequency heating device 24 in order to heat the implosion preventive metal band 58 at 350 to 500°C.  CRT lifting means 23 is installed for lifting the CRT up to specified position in the induction heating coil 25 through the<br>
- 42 -<br><br>
opening (penetration hole) provided in the center of the conveying pallet 2.  CRT supporting means 22 having four pin members is planted and installed at the CRT mounting surface side of the conveying pallet 2.<br>
Disassembling procedure of implosion preventive metal band of a general cathode-ray tube is explained below.  A flowchart of an embodiment of disassembling procedure is given in Fig. 19.<br>
In Fig. 15, the cathode-ray tube 51 mounted by supporting the panel surface on the conveying pallet 2 is fed by specified pitch and positioned at the lower part of the high frequency heating device (specifically, high frequency induction heating device) 24. The cathode-ray tube 51 is then lifted to a specified position in the induction heating coil 25 by the CRT lifting means 23.  In succession, the tab pressing means 21 descends, and the tab pressing' means 21 presses the mounting tabs at four positions with a force of 4 kg to 6 kg each.<br>
Consequently, the high frequency heating device 24 is operated, and the implosion preventive metal band 58 is heated to 350 to 500°C.  In this case, as the operating condition of the high frequency heating device, 180 V, 200 A was applied for 5 to 50 seconds at 1500 to 2000 Hz.  The application time of the high frequency heating device is about 15 seconds in the case of a 20-inch CRT.<br>
By this heating operation, the implosion preventive heating band 58 is suddenly heated and expanded.  As a result, the metal<br>
- 43 -<br><br>
band 58 falls in a reverse state of shrinkage fitting.  By heat conduction from the implosion preventive metal band 58, the resin impregnated in the incombustible buffer material or undercoat resin (for example, acrylic resin, polyester resin, or urethane resin) is lowered in the shearing adhesion strength.  Finally, the adhesion of the resin becomes lower than the pressing force, so that the implosion preventive metal band 58 is separated from the panel.  In the center of Fig. 15, a falling implosion preventive metal band 58 is indicated by single, dot chain line.<br>
After peeling off the implosion preventive metal band 58, the cathode-ray tube 51 is transferred by a specific pitch.  In next process, the implosion preventive metal band 58 is removed from the conveying pallet 2. Thereafter, specified regeneration process is done individually for regeneration of cathode-ray tube glass and regeneration of implosion preventive metal band.<br>
Two examples of removing the implosion preventive metal band 58 from the conveying pallet 2 are shown in Fig. 19.  The procedure shown in Fig. 19 is not particularly limited, and steps may be added, deleted, or changed as required.<br>
A circuit diagram of equivalent circuit of the high frequency heating device used in the above explanation and an example of constitution and main specification are given in Fig. 17. The high frequency output of the high frequency heating device used in the embodiment is a maximum of 60 kw at a frequency in a range of 0.5 kHz to 2000 kHz.  The output and frequency may be set freely<br>
- 44 -<br><br>
depending in the inch size of the cathode-ray tube.  The lower limit output may be about 2 kW.<br>
As the CRT lifting means 23, air cylinder, robot or other arbitrary means may be used.  The conveying means of the conveying pallet is not particularly limited, and, for example, roll conveyor, belt conveyor, roller conveyor, chain conveyor, or pusher method using fluid cylinder may be employed.<br>
The tab pressing means 21 is not particularly limited, and, for example, air cylinder, compression coil spring or others may be used.  The pressing load may be 4 kg or more each, allowable up to 100 kg as far as the cathode-ray tube is not broken, and preferably it is in a range of 4 to 40 kg.<br>
The front end shape of the tab pressing means 21 is not particularly limited, and an arbitrary shape may be employed.  In the tab pressing means shown in Fig. 16, four independent pressing pins corresponding to the tabs 59 are provided.<br>
In the tab pressing means 21A shown in Fig. 22 and Fig. 23, a pair of T-form plates are used.  In the tab pressing means 21A composed of T-form plates, as shown in Fig. 23, both side portions corresponding to the tabs are notched in a specified width.  The operation of the pair of T-form plates is explained in Fig. 22.<br>
First, the tab pressing means 21A composed of a pair of T-form plates grips the side surface of the metal band 58 of the CRT 51. and positions the CRT 51 at specified position in the horizontal direction.  Releasing this gripping force, consequently (the gripp-<br>
- 45 -<br><br>
ing position of the T-form plates remaining unchanged or slightly moved back), the T-form plates 21A descend in the vertical direction to press down the tabs 59.  One plate (one side) of the T-form plates 2IA presses two tabs 59 each.<br>
Other conveying pallet in an embodiment of the invention is described below.  Fig. 20 (A) is a plan view of other conveying pallet used in the disassembling device of the implosion preventive metal band of the cathode-ray tube in the invention, and Fig. 20 (B) is a sectional view cutting away Fig. 20 (A) along S1-S1.  Fig. 21 (A) is a plan view of another conveying pallet used in the invention, and Fig. 21 (B) is a sectional view cutting away Fig. 21 (A) along S2-S2.<br>
The conveying pallet 2A in Fig. 20 (A) and the conveying pallet 2B in Fig. 21 (A) are plate members made of wood, aluminum or other metal, or ABS, duracon or other resin.  The outline of the conveying pallet is nearly rectangular.  In the conveying pallet of plate form, specified recesses are formed at four positions on the circumference, and penetration holes 27A, 27B are formed in the center.<br>
Moreover, in the conveying pallet 2A shown in Fig. 20 (A), on the upper peripheral edge of the penetration hole 27A, an annular recess 29 of one size larger is formed in stairs.  A ring-form elastic member 26 is fitted in the annular recess 29.  The ring-form elastic member 26 is made of either rubber member or plastic member having a hardness of 35 to 50 degrees, or in a combination thereof.<br>
- 46 -<br><br>
The rubber material is not particularly limited, and, for example, silicone rubber, fluororubber. butyl rubber, urethane rubber, natural rubber, or other arbitrary member may be used.  Of course, a rubber member foamed like sponge may be also used.<br>
The plastic material is not particularly limited, and, for example, silicone system, vinyl chloride system, nylon system, styrol system, and other arbitrary plastic member may be used.<br>
The cathode-ray tube (CRT) to be disassembled is mounted on the center of the conveying pallets 2A, 2B with the tube side down (in Figs. 20 (B), 21 (B), the cathode-ray tube is shown by twin dot chain line).<br>
Therefore, the ring-form elastic member 26 is elastically deformed by the own weight of the cathode-ray tube 51, and contacts tightly along the tube surface of the cathode-ray tube 51. As a result, then conveying or stopping the conveying pallet 2A, by the frictions! force between the cathode-ray tube 51 and elastic member 28, the cathode-ray tube 51 maintains the initial mounted position without deviation of position.<br>
In the conveying pallet 2B shown in Fig. 21. instead of the ring-fori elastic member, elastic members pieces 2$ are disposed nearly at equal divided angles at three positions on the upper peripheral edge of the penetration hole 27B,<br>
As the constituent aember of the elastic member pieces 28, same materials as in Fig. 20 may be used.  In Fig. 21, since the cathode-ray tube is supported at three points, positioning of the<br>
- 47 -<br><br>
cathode-ray tube is further stabilized as compared with the case in Fig. 20.<br>
Besides, when conveying or stopping the conveying pallet 2B, by the frictional force between the cathode-ray tube 51 and elastic member pieces 19, the cathode-ray tube 51 maintains the initial mounted position without deviation of position.<br>
The outline of the conveying pallets 2A, 2B is not particularly limited, and any shape may be used.  The shape of the penetration holes 27A, 27B is not limited to circle, but rectangular or other shape may be used.<br>
According to the embodiment, the implosion preventive band can be removed efficiently in a short time.  Large equipment is not needed.  Deviation of position of cathode-ray tube mounted on the conveying pallet can be prevented.<br>
(g) Step 10:  CRT double panel measuring device<br>
At step 10, presence or absence of safety glass adhered to the panel surface of the CRT is judged, and the CRT having safety class is classified, and conveyed to next process.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 24 through 26, an embodiment of CRT double panel measuring device (CRT judging device) is described below.<br>
Fig. 24 is an essential sectional view of concept of process for measuring the outline of a cathode-ray tube in an embodiment of the invention.  Fig. 25 is an essential sectional view of concept of measuring process from a distance sensor to a fluorescent screen of<br>
- 48 -<br><br>
a cathode-ray tube in an embodiment of the invention.  Fig. 26 is a flowchart of measurement to separation process of a cathode-ray tube in an embodiment of the invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 24, after removing the metal band, the cathode-ray tube 51 is mounted on a specified position of the conveying pallet 2 having a penetration hole 91 and data carrier 92 in the center, with the picture display side (tube side) down.<br>
The conveying pallet 2 may be either same as the conveying pallet described in Fig. 20 and Fig. 21, or a different type of different line.<br>
In this state, at least one of the vertical dimension or lateral dimension c of the panel of the cathode-ray tube 51 is measured by a distance sensor 93.  By this measurement, the picture display screen size (tube screen size) of the cathode-ray tube is judged.  The measured value and judged data are stored in general memory means (not shown).  The length dimension c of the cathode-ray tube 51 is measured from the length a between the confronting distance sensors 93, and the lengths b1, b2 from the distance sensors 93 to the panel of the cathode-ray tube 51.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 25, a measuring unit 95 comprising the distance sensors 94 is fitted to contact with the picture display screen.  Then the distances h1, h2 from the distance sensors 94 to the fluorescent screen of the cathode-ray tube 51 are measured.<br>
In Fig. 25, the left side shows a general cathode-ray tube 51, not having safety glass at the picture display side.  The right<br>
- 49 -<br><br>
side shows a cathode-ray tube 51A of special specification having a safety glass 80 disposed through an adhesive agent 81 (for example, unsaturated polyester resin).<br>
The thickness of the safety glass 80 is about 2 mm to 3 mm, the plate thickness of the panel picture display unit is about 10 mm, the thickness of the adhesive agent 81 is about 2 mm, and the interval of the picture display screen and distance sensors 94 is about 20 mm.<br>
Therefore, the measuring distance differs about 5 mm depending on the presence or absence of the safety glass 80.  It means that the measuring precision of the distance sensors 94 may be rough, and an inexpensive measuring apparatus can be used.  As the distance sensors 94, laser beam, ultrasonic wave, or other arbitrary sensors may be used.<br>
The process from measurement and separation of cathode-ray tube is described further while referring to Fig. 26.<br>
At step 1C, the outline dimension of the cathode-ray tube is measured.  That is, the distance a of a pair of confronting laser type distance sensors 93 is set as specified.  Next, the distances b1, b2 from the laser type distance sensors 93 to the cathode-ray tube 51 are measured, and the outline dimension c of the cathode-ray tube is determined by the calculation of c = a - (b1+b2).<br>
At step 2C, the distance (measurement) between the distance sensor fluorescent screens and the type of tube are judged.  That is, the measuring unit 95 contacts with the picture display screens of<br>
- 50 -<br><br>
the cathode-ray tubes 51, 51A.  Next, by the laser type distance sensors 94, the distances h1, h2 from the fluorescent screens applied on the inside of the panel of the cathode-ray tubes 51, 51A are measured.<br>
Measured values of h1, h2 are compared with the distance "H value" from the distance sensors to the fluorescent screens put in the computer preliminarily.  In the case of the cathode-ray tube 51 without safety glass 80, the H value is defined in each inch size. Therefore, the H value is set automatically according to the outline dimension information at step 1C.<br>
When H is nearly equal to h1, the cathode-ray tube placed on the conveying pallet 2 is judged to be an ordinary cathode-ray tube (without safety glass) 51.  When H is smaller than h2, and the difference of II and h2 is about 3 mm to 4 mm or more, the cathode-ray tube is judged to be a cathode-ray tube 51A with safety glass.<br>
At step 3C, the measured data and judged result are transmitted and stored in a mechanical data carrier 92 furnished to the conveying pallet 2.  In Fig. 25, the data carrier 92 is moved to the left.<br>
As the data memory means 92, meanwhile, aside from the mechanical memory shown in Fig. 25. optical, microwave, or other arbitrary means may be employed.<br>
At step 4C, cathode-ray tubes put on the conveying pallet 2 are classified into general cathode-ray tubes 51 and cathode-ray tubes with safety glass 51A.  That is, the data in the data carrier<br>
- 51 -<br><br>
92 is read, and when the data is judged to be cathode-ray tube with safety glass 51A, this cathode-ray tube 51A is automatically transferred to other line.  As a result, adhesive agent 81 such as unsaturated polyester resin is prevented from being mixed into the cullet.<br>
At step 5C, the cathode-ray tubes 51, 51A are separated into the panel and funnel.<br>
In each line of cathode-ray tubes 51 without safety glass and cathode-ray tubes 51A with safety glass, the boundary of the panel and funnel of the cathode-ray tube is cut in a groove of specified depth circularly by a disk-shaped diamond cutter.<br>
The groove is then heated, and the panel and funnel are separated by making use of difference in thermal stress and thermal expansion.<br>
The disk-shaped diamond cutter is 80 mm to 120 mm in diameter, 0.2 mm to 2 mm in disk thickness, and 2,000 rpm to 10,000 rpm in rotating speed, and water is used as coolant.  The groove cutting depth is about 0.2 to about 2 mm.<br>
As mentioned above, according to the judging method of cathode-ray tubes of the invention, the picture display size of the cathode-ray tube can be identified and presence or absence of safety glass can be judged automatically, and the cathode-ray tube can be automatically separated into the panel and funnel at high productivity.<br>
In the embodiment, regardless of the manufacture, model, or<br>
- 52 -<br><br>
product number of video appliances, numerous unspecified discarded video appliances can be regenerated.  If the product number, model code, symbol, bar code and other codes provided in the housing of the video appliances or cathode-ray tubes can be automatically identified by CCD camera or the like, according to the identified data, judgement of the manufacturer name, model name and size of cathode-ray tube, groove cutting process in housing, judgement of presence or absence of safety glass in cathode-ray tube and classification, and separation into panel and funnel can be executed.<br>
(h) Step 11: Automatic brushing device<br>
At step 11, for the purpose of shock absorbing and adhesion of the implosion preventive metal band 58. the adhesive tape 72 glued to the side of the cathode-ray tube 51 is peeled off. or the adhesive agent of the adhesive tape 72 is scraped off.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, hereinafter, deposit reioving method of cathode-ray tube and its apparatus (automatic brushing device) are described by referring to Pigs. 27 through 32.<br>
Fig. 27 is a conceptual block diagram of deposit removing device of a cathode-ray tube in an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 28 is an essential side view of deposit removing device of a cathode-ray tube in an embodinent of the invention.  Fig. 29 is an essential plan vies of Fig. 28.  Fig. 30 is an essential side view showing peeling region of each rotary brush for composing Fig. 28. Fig. 31 is a flowchart of removal process of residual adhesive agent of adhesive tape or adhesive agent.  Fig. 32 is an essential plan<br>
- 53 -<br><br>
view of a dresser device in an embodiment of the invention.<br>
In Fig. 28, a deposit removing device 70 of cathode-ray tube is composed of a rotary brush 73 having steel wires planted radially, a brush rotating motor 74, a CRT suction pad 75 for sucking the tube surface of CRT 51 by vacuum, a CRT rotating motor 76, an elevating unit 77 for elevating and lowering the sucked CRT 51, a brush support arm 78 for supporting the rotary brush 73 and motor 74, a brush moving cylinder 79 for contacting and separating the rotary brush 73 and CRT 51, a tape recovery box 82 of adhesive tape 72 peeled off from the side wall of the CRT 51 by the rotary brush 73, a cylinder 83 for moving the tape recovery box 82, a CRT pressing cylinder 84 for holding the CRT 51 between an exhaust duct 85 for collecting the adhesive tape or brush dust generated in the peeling process of adhesive tape and suction pad 75, a conveying pallet 2 for mounting and conveying CRT, and a conveyor 1 for conveying the conveying pallet 2 in a specified direction.  This deposit removing device 70 is installed in a cleaning chamber 80.<br>
As the adhesive tape 72 serving as shock absorber by fixing the metal band to the cathode-ray tube 51, generally, a glass cloth tape impregnated with organic resin such as acrylic adhesive is used.<br>
The rotary brush 73 for peeling and removing the adhesive tape 72 is formed by planting steel wires, stainless steel wires, brass wires, or other metal wires of diameter of 0.2 mm to 0.8 mm, radially and densely on the surface of a hub.  The outside diameter of the brush is about 200 mm, and the brush width is about 40 mm.<br>
- 54 -<br><br>
The rotating speed of the brush is variable in a range of about 3,000 to about 12,000 rpm.  The rotating direction of the rotary brush 73 is reversible in normal and reverse directions.<br>
As shown in Fig. 29, the rotary brush 73 comprises rotary brushes 73A, 73B, 73C, 73D, and these rotary brushes 73 are disposed at four positions corresponding to the side walls of the CRT 51, so as to press against the side wall at a specified pressing force. The arrow in Fig. 29 indicates the rotating direction.<br>
Besides, as shown in Fig. 30. the rotary brushes 73A, 73B, 73C, 73D are disposed by sequentially deviated in the vertical direction of the CRT 51, from the first peeling region to the fourth peeling region.  In this arrangement, the adhesive tape can be securely peeled off along the width of about 100 mm.<br>
The conveying pallet 2 for mounting and conveying the CRT 51 has a penetration hole for elevating and lowering the CRT suction pad 75 in the center.<br>
In thus composed removing device 70 of deposits (adhesive tape) on the CRT wall, the operation is described while referring to the flowchart in Fig. 31.<br>
First, at step ID, the conveying pallet 2 mounting the CRT 51 is delivered into the cleaning chamber of the deposit removing device 70.<br>
Next, at step 2D, the conveying pallet 2 is positioned at a specified position.  Consequently, at step 3D, the elevating unit 77 operates, the CRT suction pad 75 supports the panel surface of the<br>
- 55 -<br><br>
CRT and goes up, and the suction pad 75 sucks the panel surface in vacuum and fixes.  At step 4D, the CRT pressing cylinder 84 descends, and the cylinder 84 presses near the neck of the electron gun of the CRT 51. and the CRT 51 is held between the pressing cylinder 84 and CRT suction pad 75.<br>
At step 5D, the tape recovery box 82 for collecting the peeled adhesive tape moves forward toward the CRT 51.  At step 6D, the brush 73 abuts against the wall of the CRT 51 while rotating at about 10,000 rpm.  AT step 7D, in this state, the CRT 51 rotates one turn in the clockwise direction.  In succession, at step 8D, with the rotating brush 73 in contact, the CRT 51 descends by about 50 mm in the vertical direction.<br>
Afterwards, at step 9D, the CRT 51 rotates one turn in the counterclockwise direction.  In this period, the rotating direction of the brush 73 may be changed over properly.<br>
At step 10D, the recovery box 82 and brush 73 are separated from the CRT 51, and return to the initial position.  At step 11D. suction of the CRT bulb surface is released.  At step 12D, the CRT suction pad 75 descends.  The CRT pressing cylinder 84 moves up.  At step 13D, the CRT 51 is mounted on the conveying pallet 2, and is discharged outside of the deposit removing device.<br>
In this embodiment, in the process of peeling work, by lowering the CRT 51 by about 50 mm in the vertical direction and rotating reversely, peeling of the adhesive tape of about 100 mm is more secure.<br>
- 56 -<br><br>
Moreover, by changing over the rotation of the CRT 51 and brush 73 in normal and reverse directions, deformation of the tip of the brush 73 can be prevented, and a fresh abutting surface of the brush is always obtained.<br>
Besides, as the means for showing always a fresh abutting surface of the brush, the dresser device as shown in Fig. 32 can be used.  In Fig. 32, a dresser 62 made of cylindrical porous ceramic or grinding wheel piece is fitted to the tip of the brush 61, so that the tip of the brush 61 coated with the deposit 67 is ground. At this time, by using also coolant such as water from coolant feed means 64, the grinding effect is enhanced while cooling action is achieved.<br>
In Fig. 32, an adhesive tape (adhesive tape and adhesive agent) 72 is adhered to the surface of the side wall 63 of the CRT. As the brush 61 rotates, the deposit 67 formed on the tip of the brush 61 is removed by the dresser 62.<br>
In the embodiment, the planting width and outside diameter of the brushes 61, 73, wire material, rotating speed and others can be set freely.<br>
The presence or absence of the dresser device is also arbitrary.  Still more, instead of the lowering action of the CRT at step 9D, the rotary brush side can be moved up and down.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, deposits such as adhesive tape left over on the CRT bulb side can be removed in dry process, efficiently, and in a short time.<br>
- 57 -<br><br>
(i) Step 12:  CRT transfer device<br>
At step 12, after removing the electron gun, metal band, and adhesive tape, the CRT is conveyed to the CRT classification process to be classified into the panel and funnel by CRT transfer device (12) in Fig. 2.<br>
In the execution of each step, the dissembling object is not limited to the video appliances (television receiver, personal computer, or display monitor), but it can be applied to any electronic appliances such as audio appliances and air-conditioners.<br>
Thus, according to the constitution of the invention, disassembling of the television receiver, electric household appliances, and electronic appliances can be realized in dry process. Moreover, the process from detaching of back lid of housing, to peeling and removing of adhesive tape glued to the side of the CRT can be automated or half automated in a simple facility.  Hence, classification and regeneration process is facilitated.  As a result, the recycling efficiency is enhanced, the environments can be preserved, and the sources can be utilized effectively.<br>
