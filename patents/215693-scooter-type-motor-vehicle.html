				<td>1.	The present invention relates to a velticle body structure in a scooter-type motor vehicle.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
One conventional scooter-type motor vehicle having a power unit suspended on a suspension on a vehicle frame is already known from Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 1-311975, for example. Another conventional scooter-type motor vehicle which includes a rear cushion disposed between a main frame in the form of a casting and a power unit and having an upper end coupled to a rear portion of the main frame is already known from Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 3-186492, for example.<br>
According to the disclosure of Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 1-311975, the vehicle frame as a whole comprises a unitary casting of a light alloy such as an aluminum alloy or the like. However, there are occasions where it is difficult to form the entire vehicle<br>
frame as a unitary structure due to limitations on the production facility.  In such a case, the vehicle frame has to be divided into front and rear members   It is preferable to avoid the application of a large load to a suspension on which a power unit is mounted.<br>
According to the disclosure of Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 3-186492, a bracket is attached to the rear portion of the main frame which is cast, and the upper end of the rear cushion is coupled to the bracket. While the main frame comprises a unitary casting, the bracket is required separately from the main frame. Therefore, the number of parts used is relatively large.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is a first object of the present<br>
V<br>
invention to provide a scooter-type motor vehicle which is arranged to avoid the application of a large load to a suspension of a vehicle frame which is divided into front and rear members.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to<br><br>
provide a scooter-type motor vehicle which is made up of a relatively small number of parts and allows a rear cushion to be attached to a main frame.<br>
To achieve the first object, there is provided in accordance with the present invention a scooter-type motor vehicle comprising a vehicle frame having a suspension member and a power unit suspended from the suspension member, the vehicle frame comprising a head pipe on which a front fork is steerably supported, a main frame integral with the head pipe, the suspension member being mounted on a rear portion of the main frame, and an auxiliary frame for bearing part of a load acting on the vehicle frame, the auxiliary frame having a front end fastened to the main frame forwardly and rearwardly of the suspension member.<br>
With the above arrangement, regardless of the main frame and the auxiliary frame into which the vehicle frame is divided, a large load is prevented from being applied in a certain direction to the suspension member on the rear end of the main frame. The thickness of the main frame does not need to be increased or stiffener ribs do not need to be mounted on the main frame for increasing the strength of the main frame at the suspension member. Thus, the weight of the main frame and hence the vehicle frame may be reduced.<br>
To achieve the second object, there is provided in<br>
accordance with the present invention a scooter-type motor vehicle comprising a cast main frame, a power unit, and a rear cushion disposed between the cast main frame and the power unit, the rear cushion having an upper end coupled to a rear portion of the cast main frame, the upper end of the rear cushion being coupled to the rear portion of the cast main frame through rubber members interposed between the upper end of the rear cushion and upper and lower surfaces of the rear portion of the cast main frame.<br>
With the above arrangement, the upper end of the rear cushion is coupled to the rear end of the cast main frame through the rubber members that are interposed between the upper end of the rear cushion and the upper and lower surfaces of the rear end of the cast main frame.  It is therefore not necessary to install a separate bracket on the cast main frame, and hence the number of parts used may be reduced.<br>
The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention by way of example.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a vehicle body structure in a scooter-type motor vehicle in which a power unit is suspended from a suspension member on a vehicle frame, said vehicle frame comprising a main frame which is integrally formed with a head pipe on which a front fork is steerably supported, and which has a suspension member on a rear end thereof, characterized in that it has an auxiliary frame for bearing part of a load acting on the vehicle frame in its entirety, said auxiliary frame having a front end fastened to the upper side of the main frame forwardly and rearwardly of the said suspension member.<br>

A power unit 20 which comprises an engine and a continuously variable transmission has a casing 21 which serves as a crankcase of the engine and a transmission case of the continuously variable transmission. The casing 21 is suspended by the vehicle frame 15 by a link mechanism 22, with a rear cushion 23 disposed between the casing 21 and the vehicle frame 15. A rear wheel WR is rotatably supported on a rear end of the casing 21.<br>
The vehicle frame 15 is covered with a vehicle cover 24 except for a portion of the vehicle frame 15. The vehicle cover 24 comprises a front cover 25 covering a front portion of the head pipe 16 and an upper portion of the front wheel WF, a leg shield 26 joined to the front cover 25 for covering front portions of the legs of a rider, a pair of floor panels 27 joined to the leg shield 26 and disposed one on each side of the vehicle frame 15, for supporting the feet of the rider, a pair of under covers 28 joined to the front cover 25 in covering relation to the both sides of the motor vehicle below the floor panels 27 and joined to the floor panels 27, respectively, and a rear cover 29 joined to the floor panels 27 in<br>
covering relation to both sides of a rear portion of the motor vehicle. A seat 30 for the rider to sit on is disposed on the rear cover 29.<br>
In FIGS. 3 and 4, the vehicle frame 15 comprises a main frame 31 and an auxiliary frame 32 fastened to a rear end of the main frame 31. The main frame 31 comprises a front frame 33 including the head pipe 16 as an integral portion thereof and a rear frame 34 joined to a rear end of the front frame 33.  The main frame 31 is of an integral cast structure made of an aluminum alloy or the like, or an integrally molded structure made of a synthetic resin reinforced with long reinforcing fibers such as long glass fibers, long carbon fibers, or the like.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the front frame 33 comprises the head pipe 16, an inclined portion 35 extending rearwardly downwardly from the head pipe 16, and a rear extension 36 joined to a rear end of the inclined portion 35 and extending substantially horizontally in the rearward direction.  Stays 37 which are relatively long in the longitudinal direction and project laterally outwardly are integrally formed with opposite sides, respectively, of the inclined portion 35 and the rear extension 36.  The floor<br>
panels 27 are fixedly supported on upper surfaces of the stays 37. Specifically, the floor panels 27 are fastened to the stays 37 by a plurality of nuts 38 (see FIG. 5) held against and engaging lower surfaces of the stays 37 and a plurality of bolts 39 threaded in the respective nuts 38.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the front frame 33 has a upwardly bulging, transversely central tunnel 33a having a substantially U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape. The stays 37 are integrally joined to respective lower ends of laterally opposite side walls of the tunnel 33a.  The side walls of the tunnel 33a have respective steps 33b which engage respective inner side edges of the floor panels 27.  The floor panels 27 are supported on the respective stays 37 in a manner to expose the tunnel 33a outwardly above the floor panels 27.<br>
A plurality of stiffener ribs 40 are integrally formed with lower surfaces of the inclined portion 35 and the rear extension 36 of the front frame 33. A reinforcing member 41 extending between the stays 37 has opposite ends fastened to lower surfaces of the stays 37 by bolts 42.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2, 3, and 4, accessory stays 43, 44, 35 are integrally mounted on a front portion of the<br>
front frame 33. A battery 46 is mounted as an accessory on the accessory stay 43. A horn 47 is mounted as an accessory on the accessory stay 44. A combination switch (not shown) is mounted as an accessory on the accessory stay 45.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 6, 7, and 8, the rear frame 34 which is joined to the rear end of the front frame 33 extends rearwardly and upwardly from the rear end of the front frame 33. The rear frame 34 has an article storage container 49 for storing an article such as a helmet 48 (see FIG. 1) or the like.<br>
The article storage container 49 is in the form of an upwardly open box made of synthetic resin.  The article storage container 49 has an upper end covered with the seat 30.  The seat 30 is disposed on the rear cover 29 so as to be movable for opening the upper end of the article storage container 49.<br>
The rear frame 34 has an upwardly open storage cavity 50 defined and surrounded by a front side wall 51, lateral side walls 52, and a rear side wall 53 which all extend upwardly.  The article storage container 49 is mounted on the rear frame 34 and has at least a portion thereof placed in the storage cavity 50.<br>
Each of the lateral side walls 52 has an inner side plate 52a which serves as an inner side surface of the storage cavity 50, an outer side plate 52b spaced outwardly from the inner side plate 52a, and a joint plate 52c interconnecting the upper ends of the inner and outer side plates 52a, 52b.  Each of the lateral side walls 52 has a substantially U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape which is open downwardly. The front side wall 51 also has a substantially U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape which is open downwardly, similar to the lateral side walls 52.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, a pair of laterally spaced attachment recesses 54 is defined in a front end of the bottom of the storage cavity 50, and an attachment recess 56 is defined in a rear end of the bottom of the storage cavity 50.  The article storage container 49 has a pair of attachment fingers 49a (see FIG. 6) projecting from a front end of the bottom thereof and fitted respectively in the attachment recesses 54. The attachment fingers 49a are fastened to the rear frame 34 by screws 57.  The article storage container 49 also has an attachment finger (not<br>
shown) projecting from a rear end of the bottom thereof and fitted in the attachment recess 56, the attachment finger being fastened to the rear frame 34 by a screw (not shown).<br>
The rear frame 34 has a pair of integral engine hanger brackets 58 (see FIG. 7) extending downwardly from lateral sides of a front end thereof. The power unit 20 is suspended from the engine hanger unit 58 by the link mechanism 22.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the link mechanism 22 has a link 60 comprising a cylindrical proximal member 60a and a cylindrical distal member 6Ob which have respective axes extending parallel to each other, and a joint arm 60c interconnecting the cylindrical proximal and distal members 60a, 60b.  The cylindrical proximal member 60a is supported by a pair of rubber bushings 62 on a first support shaft 61 which extends horizontally and is fixed to the engine hanger brackets 58.  The cylindrical distal member 60b is fitted over a second support shaft 63 which is supported by a rubber bushing 64 on a joint tube 21a mounted on the casing 21 of the power unit 20.<br>
A stopper arm 65 extending away from the joint arm 60c is fixed to the cylindrical proximal member 60a of the<br>
link 60. The stopper arm 65 has a distal end having upper and lower surfaces to which respective rubber stoppers 66, 67 are fixed. The rubber stoppers 66, 67 are inserted in a box 68 integrally formed with a lower surface of the front end of the rear frame 34.<br>
The link mechanism 22 allows the power unit 20 to swing about the second support shaft 63. The link 60 is swingable about the first support shaft 61 while vibrations from the power unit 20 are being absorbed by the rubber bushings 62, 64.  Swinging and vibratory movement of the link 60 is dampened by the rubber stoppers 66, 67 and then transmitted to he rear frame 34, i.e., the vehicle frame 15.<br>
Because the rear frame 34 is of an integral cast structure made of an aluminum alloy or the like, or an integrally molded structure made of a synthetic resin reinforced with long reinforcing fibers such as long glass fibers, long carbon fibers, or the like, dimensions between the engine hanger brackets 58 are subject to strains or shrinkage and are not highly accurate. To compensate for a reduction in the dimensional accuracy between the engine hanger brackets 58, dimensional adjustment washers 69 are<br>
interposed between the rubber bushings 62 and the engine hanger brackets 58.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 9, 10, and 11, the main frame 31, i.e., the rear frame 34, has a downwardly recessed, rear cushion attachment wall 70 disposed as a suspension member on a rear portion thereof in the vicinity of a left one of the lateral side walls 52 of the storage cavity 50. The rear cushion 23 disposed between the main frame 34 and the power unit 20 has an upper end coupled to the rear cushion attachment wall 70 through rubber members 79, 80.<br>
The rear cushion 23 comprises a hydraulic damper<br>
71	having a cylindrical damper body 7la and a rod 71b<br>
projecting from a lower end thereof, and a helical spring<br>
72	disposed around the hydraulic damper 71 and extending<br>
between an upper end of the damper body 7la and a lower end<br>
of the rod 71b.  The lower end of the rear cushion 23,<br>
i.e., the lower end of the rod 71b, is connected to a rear<br>
portion of the casing 21 of the power unit 20 by a shaft<br>
73.<br>
A joint shaft 74 is coaxially fixed to the upper end of the rear cushion 23, i.e., the upper end of the damper body 7la, and extends through an attachment hole 75<br>
which is defined in the rear cushion attachment wall 70. The rubber member 79 is interposed between the rear cushion attachment wall 70 and a washer 76 attached to an upper end of the joint shaft 74. The rubber member 79 is prevented from being expanded radially outwardly by a surrounding wall of the downwardly recessed, rear cushion attachment wall 70. The washer 76 is engaged by a bolt 77 which is threaded into the upper end of the joint shaft 74. The rubber member 80 is interposed between the upper end of the damper body 7la and a cap-shaped guide member 78 having a tubular portion 78a fitted in the attachment hole 75.  The rubber member 80 is prevented from being expanded radially outwardly by the guide member 78.  The upper end of the rear cushion 23 is connected to the rear cushion attachment wall 70 through the rubber members 79, 80.<br>
The auxiliary frame 32 has a pair of longitudinal frames 83 inclined rearwardly and upwardly, and is made of a light alloy such as an aluminum alloy or the like or a synthetic resin reinforced with long-fiber reinforcement members. The auxiliary frame 32 also has a pair of attachments 85 integral with respective front ends of the longitudinal frames 83 and fastened to the rear end of the<br>
main frame 31, i.e., the rear end of the rear frame 34. The attachments 85 has respective pairs of integral front and rear attachment legs 86, 87 projecting toward the rear end of the rear frame 34. The rear end of the rear frame 34 has two pairs of support lands 90, 91 projecting toward the auxiliary frame 32 in alignment with the respective attachment legs 86, 87.  The attachment legs 86, 87 have distal ends held against the corresponding support lands 90, 91, and are fastened to the support lands 90, 91, i.e., the rear end of the rear frame 34, by bolts 88, 89.<br>
The support lands 90, 91 on the left-hand side of the rear end of the rear frame 34, i.e., the region where the rear cushion attachment wall 70 is located, are positioned forwardly and rearwardly, respectively, of the rear cushion attachment wall 70.  Therefore, the auxiliary frame 32 is fastened to the rear frame 34, i.e., the main frame 31, forwardly and rearwardly, respectively, of the rear cushion attachment wall 70.<br>
The auxiliary frame 32 is disposed around lateral sides and a rear portion of a fuel tank 92.  The fuel tank 92 has a front end whose opposite sides are fastened to and supported on the respective attachments 85 of the auxiliary<br>
frame 32. The longitudinal frames 83 have rear ends to which tank supports 84 are integrally joined. The fuel tank 92 has a rear end whose opposite sides are fastened to and supported on the respective tank supports 84. Although not shown, a rear fender, a tail lamp, etc. are attached to the auxiliary frame 32.<br>
The auxiliary frame 32 also has an integral rear grip 97 interconnecting the rear ends of the longitudinal frames 83 in a portal shape.  The seat 30 has a rear end supported on a support 98 which extends integrally intermediate between opposite sides of the rear grip 97.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, each of the longitudinal frames 83 of the auxiliary frame 32 serves as a side grip. The rear cover 29 has openings 99 defined in its opposite side panels for the rider to gain access to and grip the longitudinal frames 83 through the openings 99.<br>
Advantages offered by the scooter-type motor vehicle according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described below.<br>
In the main frame 31 which is integrally<br>
constructed of the front frame 33 with the head pipe 16 on its front and the rear frame 34, the stays 37 are<br>
integrally positioned on the opposite sides of the front frame 33, and the floor panels 27 for supporting the feet of the rider are supported on the respective stays 37. Therefore, it is not necessary to employ a frame separate from the front frame 33, and thus the number of parts used may be reduced. The front frame 33 as on its front portion the integral accessory stays 43, 44, 45 for attachment of the battery 46, the horn 47, and the combination switch. Since no separate accessory stays are required, the number of parts used may be reduced.<br>
The stays 37 extend longitudinally over a<br>
relatively long distance and are integral with the opposite sides of the front frame 33.  Therefore, loads acting on the stays 37 are prevented from being applied locally to the front frame 33, and can instead be substantially uniformized over the relatively long distance in the longitudinal direction.  Consequently, even though the front frame 33 is of an open cross-sectional shape, it can sufficiently bear loads from the floor panels 27, and the stays 37 can easily be integrally formed with the front frame 32.<br>
Inasmuch as the front frame 33 has the upwardly<br>
bulging, transversely central tunnel 33a having the substantially U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape, the transverse cross-sectional area of the front frame 33 may be relatively large and may have increased rigidity. Since the reinforcing member 41 extends between the stays 37 of the front frame 33, the rigidity of the front frame 33 is further increased.  The floor panels 27 are supported respectively on the stays 37, exposing an upper portion of the tunnel 33a outwardly.  Consequently, it is possible to make the leg shield 26 and the floor panels 27 of the vehicle cover 24 relatively small.<br>
The rear frame 34 of the main frame 31 has the upwardly open storage cavity 50 surrounded by the front side wall 51, the lateral side walls 52, and the rear side wall 53 which all extend upwardly, and the article storage container 49 is mounted on the rear frame 34 and has at least a portion thereof placed in the storage cavity 50. Therefore, the thickness of a portion which supports the bottom of the article storage container 49 does not need to be increased, and the rigidity of the rear frame 34 is increased.  The position of the upper end of the article storage container 49, i.e., the height of the seat, can be<br>
lowered without resulting in an increase in the weight of the motor vehicle.<br>
The upper end of the rear cushion 23 is coupled to the rear end of the rear frame 34. A left one of the lateral side walls 52 has the inner side plate 52a which serves as the inner side surface of the storage cavity 50, the outer side plate 52b spaced outwardly from the inner side plate 52a, and the joint plate 52c interconnecting the upper ends of the inner and outer side plates 52a, 52b, and has a substantially U-shaped transverse cross-sectional shape which is open downwardly. The upper end of the rear cushion 23 is coupled to the rear frame 34 at a position close to the left lateral side wall 52. Consequently, the rigidity with which the rear cushion 23 is attached to the rear frame 34 is increased.  Since the engine hanger brackets 58 are integral with the rear frame 34, no separate engine hanger brackets are necessary, and hence the number of parts used may be reduced.<br>
The upper end of the rear cushion 23 is coupled to the rear cushion attachment wall 70 of the rear frame 34 through the rubber members 79, 80 disposed between the upper end of the rear cushion 23 and upper and lower<br>
surfaces of the rear cushion attachment wall 70. Because no separate bracket is required to attach the rear cushion 23, the number of parts used may be reduced. The rear cushion attachment wall 70 is downwardly recessed and is disposed on the rear end of the rear frame 31. Therefore, the rigidity of the rear cushion attachment wall 70 may be made relatively high. Since the rubber member 79 is fitted in the recessed rear cushion attachment wall 70, no guide member is required to prevent the rubber member 79 from being expanded radially outwardly. Accordingly, the number of parts used may be reduced.<br>
The rear end of the rear frame 34 is subject to a thrust load applied upwardly from the rear cushion 23.  The auxiliary frame 32 which is subject to part of the passenger load from the seat 30, the load of the fuel tank 92, and a load exerted when one of the longitudinal frames 83, which serves as a side grip, or the rear grip 97, is gripped to lift the motor vehicle, is fastened to the rear frame 34 forwardly and rearwardly of the rear cushion attachment wall 70.  Therefore, a load which is opposite in phase to the thrust load from the rear cushion 23 is applied to the rear frame 34 forwardly and rearwardly of<br>
the rear cushion attachment wall 70. The rear end of the rear frame 34 is thus prevented from being subject to a relatively large load in a certain direction. The thickness of the rear frame 34 does not need to be increased, and no stiffener ribs are not required to be mounted on the rear frame 34.  Consequently, the weight of the rear frame 34 may be reduced.<br>
The fuel tank 92, the rear fender, the tail lamp, etc. are mounted on the auxiliary frame 32. Since the auxiliary frame 32 with the fuel tank 92, the rear fender, the tail lamp, etc. mounted thereon can be installed on the rear frame 34, it is possible to install the fuel tank 92, the rear fender, the tail lamp, etc. on the auxiliary frame 32 in advance to prepare for assembling the scooter-type motor vehicle. As a result, the scooter-type motor vehicle can be assembled with increased efficiency.<br>
Because the auxiliary frame 32 has the<br>
longitudinal frames 83, serving as side grips, and the rear grip 97 as integral members, it is not necessary to install those grips as separate members. Thus, the number of parts used may be reduced.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a vehicle frame of a scooter-type<br>
motor vehicle according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 13, the vehicle frame, generally denoted by 15', has a main frame 31' including an integral head pipe 16 and an auxiliary frame 32' fastened to a rear end of the main frame 31'. The main frame 31' is of a shape which substantially corresponds to the front frame 33 according to the first embodiment. The auxiliary frame 32' is of a shape which substantially corresponds to the rear frame 34 and the auxiliary frame 32 according to the first embodiment.<br>
An engine hanger bracket 58' to which the link mechanism 22 (see FIG. 6) interposed between itself and the power unit 20 is integrally formed as a suspension member with the rear end of the main frame 31'. The auxiliary frame 32' has a front end fastened to the rear end of the main frame 31' by bolts 100 forwardly and rearwardly of the engine hanger bracket 58'.<br>
In the second embodiment, a load acting on the engine hanger bracket 58' and a load acting from the auxiliary frame 32' act in opposite phase on the main frame 31', which is thus prevented from being subject to a relatively large load in a certain direction. The<br>
thickness of the main frame 31' does not need to be increased, and no stiffener ribs are not required to be mounted on the main frame 31'. Consequently, the weight of<br>
Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in detail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
