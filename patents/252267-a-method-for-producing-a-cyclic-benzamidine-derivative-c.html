DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING CYCLIC BENZAMIDINE DERIYATIVE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods for producing cyclic benzamidine derivatives, recrystallization methods thereof, theix intennediates, and methods for producing the intermediates.<br>
Background Art<br>
One of the ^proaches against thrombosis is the inhibition of the enzyme activity towards thrombin.    Recently, compounds having antagonistic effects on thrombin receptors are expected to exhibit excellent effects for the treatment and prevention of thrombin-related diseases such as thrombosis, vascular restenosis, deep phlebothrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, cardiac diseases, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, hypertension, inflammatory diseases, rheumatism, asthma, glomerulonephritis, osteoporosis, nerve disorders, malignant tumors, and so on.    Accordingly, there was a need for thrombin receptor antagonists that satisfy points such as pharmacological activity, receptor specificity to thrombin receptors, safety, dose and oral usefxilness.<br>
The present inventors have already found that 2-iminopyrTolidine derivatives and their salts have excellent thrombin receptor-inhibitory activity, and are useful as thrombin receptor antagonists (Patent Document 1: WO02/085855).    Among the 2-iminopyrrolidine derivatives and their salts disclosed in Patent Document 1, methods for producing<br>
1 -(3-rerr-butyl-4-methoxy-5-morpholino-phenyl)-2-(5,6-diethoxy-7-fluoro-1 -imino-1,3-dihydro-2-isoindol-2-yl)-ethanone (hereinafter may be referred to as "cyclic benzamidine derivative (C)") represented by formxila (XIII),<br><br>
or a salt thereof, are described in Patent Document 1.<br>
More specifically, as an example of methods for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent, Patent Document 1 discloses the method of coupling 5,6-diethoxy-7-fluoro-3if-isoindol-1-ylamine represented by<br><br><br>
(hereinafter, these compounds may be referred to as "fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A)"),<br><br>
(hereinafter, it may be referred to as "morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B)).<br>
A method of producing the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) is described as dissolving 4,5-diethoxy-3-fluorophthalonitrile, which is represented by the following formula, in ethylacetate-ethanol-methanol, and adding platinum oxide.<br><br>
However, this method has a low yield of the desired compound, leads to formation of<br><br>
numerous by-products, and requires purification immediately after the reaction due to product instability.    Furthermore, since the products have high adsorptivity for the platinum catalyst treatments to avoid hazardous ignition from the remaining platinum catalyst are necessary even after catalyst filtration, thus posing complicated purification issues.    Patent Document 1 uses a known compound l,2-diethoxy-3-fluorobenzene as the raw material for producing a fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A), but its low overall yield was a problem.<br>
Therefore, methods of producing the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A), or a salt thereof, that give high overall yields, have easy reaction procedures, and are useful even in an industrial scale production were anticipated.<br>
patent Document 1 discloses a method of producing the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) using 2-tert-butylphenyl as the raw material.   However, this method has problems such as: the necessity to include manipulations to secure safety since a nitro compound is used in the reaction procedure; the need to use expensive reagents such as 2-bromoethylether; and low overall yield.<br>
Therefore, economical and industrially advantageous methods for producing the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) or a salt thereof, which have simple reaction procedures and give high overall yields were required.<br>
Furthermore, the reaction of coupling the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) or a salt thereof with the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) to obtain the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof also had complicated purification procedure issues.<br>
Therefore, there was a need for overall industrially advantageous methods for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C), or a salt thereof, including methods of synthesizing raw materials such as the aforementioned compound (A) and compoxmd (B).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
More specifically, an ultimate objective of the present invention is to provide effective methods for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof.   Therefore, the initial objective is to provide effective methods for producing raw materials for synthesizing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C), which are the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) or a salt thereof, and the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) or a salt thereof, as well as to provide their precursors.   Another objective is to provide effective methods for coupling the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) or a salt thereof with the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) or a salt thereof, as well as effective methods for recrystallizing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof.,<br>
Upon extensive studies to solve the above-mentioned issues, the present inventors succeeded in synthesizing the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) or a salt thereof with<br><br>
simple and convenient procedures and good yields, using the novel compound (I) represented by formula (I)<br><br>

Furthermore, the present inventors discovered that when an ether, (preferably tetrahydrofuran (THF)), or a hydrocarbon, is used as the reaction solvent in the coupling reaction between the fluorinated cyclic benzamidine derivative (A) or a salt thereof and the morpholike-substituted phenacyl derivative (B) or a salt thereof, the desired cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof can be crystallized easily and desired compounds can be readily and conveniently purified.<br>
In addition, the present inventors found that cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) can be dissolved readily at a low temperature and recrystallized easily by dissolving this cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) in a mixed solvent prepared from an alcohol and water, or   an ether and water, and precipitating its crystals by adding water, and thereby completed this invention.<br>

(wherein, Hal" represents a halogen atom), using a hydrocarbon or ether as the solvent.<br>
Generally, the reaction can be carried out by simply mixing these compounds (A) and (B) and stirring in a solvent   Furthermore, post-reaction treatments and procedures of isolation and purification may also be performed to isolate and purify the desired cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) as a free benzamidine or a salt thereof.<br>
Examples of ethers that are used as the solvent include THF.<br>
Examples of hydrocarbons that are used as the solvent include w-hexane, n-heptane, benzene, toluene, and xylene, and among them, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane and n-heptane are preferred.<br>
These solvents can be used individually or in combinations of two or more types of solvents.<br>

It is desirable from the perspective of increasing overall yields to react the fluorinated cychc benzamidine derivative (A) with the morpholine-substituted phenacyl derivative (B).    The phrase "(A) and/or (B)" means at least either (A) or (B) is included.<br>
The methods of the present invention for producing the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof may comprise a recrystallization step.   More specifically, the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof obtained by the aforementioned methods can be further purified by recrystallization.<br>
The recrystallization method involves adding cmde crystals of the cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof into a mixed solvent containing water and alcohol such as methanol or ethanol in a discretionary ratio, or a mixed solvent containing water and ether such as THF in a discretionary ratio, and dissolving the crude crystals at low temperatures.   For example, after dissolution, additional water can be added to precipitate the crystals.   A mixed solvent comprising alcohol and water is preferable.   For the alcohol, ethanol is preferred.<br><br>
For the dissolution above, the volume ratio of water to ether or water to alcohol ia the be is preferably 0:100 to 80:20, and more preferably in the range between 10:90 and 30:70. The temperature at which crude crystals precipitate is preferably 50oC or lower, and more preferably 45°C or lower.    The cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) and a salt thereof are astable to heat, and when they are placed under high temperatures for a long period of time, their quality may decrease due to degradation, generation of by-products, and such.   For example, when a mixed solvent comprising water and ethanol is used, the cyclic benzamidine erivative (C) or a salt thereof can be easily dissolved at low temperatures, and thus, their quality 5 not decreased by the heating needed for dissolution.    Furthermore, since ethanol is used, this method is very safe from operational and pharmaceutical aspects.   In addition, it is industrially adantageous since crystals are precipitated simply by adding water.<br>
The cyclic benzamidine derivative (C) or a salt thereof obtained by such methods of the present invention have excellent thrombin receptor inhibitory activity, and are useful as thrombin receptor antagonists.<br>
