DESCRIPTION<br>
PRODUCTION METHOD OF TRIHYDROCARBYLBORANE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a production method of<br>
trihydrocarbylborane useful as organic synthesis reagent such as an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst, a reducing agent and an aklylating agent.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
The production method of trihydrocarbylborane (hereinafter abbreviated as<br>
TRB) is described, for example, by taking as an example a production method of<br>
a trialkylborane.<br>
[0003]<br>
A production method of TRB in which trialkoxyborane is reacted with<br>
trialkylaluminum is disclosed, for example, in Patent Document 1 (Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open No. 47-8621) and others.<br>
[0004]<br>
B(OR)3 + AIR3 -&gt; BR3 + AI(OR)3	(1) R: alkyl<br>
When this reaction is carried out in industrial production, it is necessary that<br>
the by-produced trialkoxyaluminum be hydrolyzed to be separated as aluminum<br>
hydroxide, and the alcohol be recovered and then reacted with boric acid to be<br>
again converted back into a trialkoxyborane; for that purpose, equipment is to be<br>
augmented and the number of the operation steps are also to be increased; the<br>
volume of the by-product exceeds that of TRB as the target product, and hence<br><br>
the volume efficiency of the reaction vessel is low; further, organic liquid waste is<br>
also discharged in a large amount to necessitate the disposal thereof; from the<br>
reasons described above, the above-mentioned method is not an advantageous<br>
method for industrial production.<br>
[0005]<br>
Another production method of TRB in which boron trihalide is reacted with<br>
trialkylaluminum is also disclosed, for example, in Patent Document 1 and others.<br>
[0006]<br>
BX3+AIR3 -&gt; BR3+AIX3	(2) X=F, CI, Br, I<br>
In this reaction, boron trihalide as a raw material is expensive and highly<br>
toxic, and hence an industrial production of TRB based on this reaction seems to<br>
be impossible.<br>
[0007]<br>
Patent Document 2 (U.S. Patent No. 2,951,093) discloses a method in<br>
which boron oxide is reacted with ethylaluminum sesquichloride, and Patent<br>
Document 3 (U.S. Patent No. 3,042,723) discloses a method in which borax is<br>
reacted with ethylaluminum sesquichloride to produce TRB; however, according<br>
to the knowledge of the present inventors, any of these is low in reaction yield,<br>
and has been evaluated not to be applicable to industrial production.<br>
[0008]<br>
Patent Document 4 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3-258786) describes<br>
a method for obtaining TRB by reacting trialkoxyboroxine with trialkylaluminum.<br>
[0009]<br>
3R3AI + (R-0-B-O-)3 -&gt; 3R3B + (R-0-AI-O-)3 (3)<br><br>
This reaction suffers from the by-production of an alkoxy group-containing Al<br>
compound, similarly to the reaction of (1), causing a problem of the disposal<br>
thereof. Additionally, for production of trialkoxyboroxine, a method of Patent<br><br>
Document 5 (Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 41-6751) is cited; in this method,<br>
the product is obtained as a solution containing an organic solvent such as carbon<br>
tetrachloride, thus a step for separating the organic solvent and other steps are<br>
required to make this method unsuitable for industrial production.<br>
Well known is a production method of TRB in which trialkylborane is reacted with<br>
boron oxide to yield trialkylboroxine (hereinafter abbreviated as TRBO) (reaction (4)),<br>
and then TRBO is reacted with trialkylaluminum (hereinafter abbreviated as TRAL), and<br>
thus, TRB is newly produced in twice the amount used as the raw material (reaction<br>
(5)).<br>
BR3 + B2O3—► R3B3O3	(4)<br>
R3B3O3 + 2AIR3 —► 3BR3 + AI2O3	(5)<br>
(4)+(5) BR3 + B2O3 + 2AIR3 -► 3BR3 + AI2O3<br>
For example, in Non-Patent Document 1 to ("Journal of the American Chemical<br>
Society, Sep. 20, 1959, Vol.81, p.4791-4795", Organic and Biological Chemistry) 0.2<br>
mole of triethylboroxine (hereinafter abbreviated as TEBO) was added and reacted with<br>
0.4 mole of triethylaluminum (hereinafter abbreviated as TEAL), then triethylborane<br>
(hereinafter abbreviated as TEB) was obtained with a yield of 95.6%. Non-Patent<br>
Document 1 also describes that aluminum oxide becomes white crystals having<br>
satisfactory fluidity in a flask.<br>
Patent Document 6 (U.S. Patent No. 3,049,407) describes that for the reaction<br>
between TRBO and TRAL, the TRBO to TRAL molar ratio is preferably 2, and a reaction<br>
method of adding TRAL into TRBO is preferable; and additionally, Patent Document 6<br>
also recommends that a tertiary amine or TEB itself be used as the dispersion medium<br>
because aluminum oxide is handled in a liquid.<br><br>
Further, the concerned Patent discloses a continuous distillation method in which<br>
a vertical thin-film evaporator is used in the distillation and the vapor of TRB is<br>
discharged from the top of the evaporator and the solid aluminum oxide is<br>
discharged from the bottom of the evaporator.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0013]<br>
Among the proposed production methods of TRB, the method in which the<br>
reaction (4) and the reaction (5) are combined seems to be a most excellent<br>
method to be industrially implemented because it is excellent in reaction yield, and<br>
the by-product is an inorganic material, namely, aluminum oxide, and organic<br>
waste is generated in a small amount. However, according to the knowledge of<br>
the present inventors, the reaction is carried out, as in the conventional<br>
techniques, by using TRAL in the vicinity of the theoretical amount of twice the<br>
moles of TRBO, gelation starts all over the synthesis liquid from around the end of<br>
the synthesis operation; the agitator trips and stops when the torque of the<br>
agitator is small, and subsequently the synthesis liquid is wholly solidified. Even<br>
when the torque is large and the agitation can thereby be continued, the agitation<br><br>
becomes difficult with the progress of the distillation operation of TRB, and<br>
eventually the gel sticks to the bottom of the distillation still, and the discharge<br>
operation of the gel becomes difficult.<br>
[0014]<br>
It is to be noted that in the present description, the trihydrocarbylborane<br>
inclusive of trialkylborane is abbreviated as TRB and the trihydrocarbylaluminum<br>
inclusive of trialkylaluminum is abbreviated as TRAL, and the following description<br>
adopts these abbreviations.<br>
[0015]<br>
As a countermeasure against the above-mentioned problem, as described<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 3,049,407, a method in which aluminum oxide is fluidized by<br>
adding a tertiary amine or the like as a dispersion medium requires a step for<br>
separating the added tertiary amine, or causes the degradation of the product<br>
purity or other problems, and thus is disadvantageous for the industrial<br>
implementation. The use of TRB itself as the dispersion medium causes the loss<br>
of the targeted and expensive TRB, and results in the lack of economic rationality.<br>
Additionally, the present inventors have concluded that it is impossible to<br>
implement a continuous distillation operation in which TRB is recovered as a<br>
fraction of distillate while the solid aluminum oxide is being separated by<br>
introducing the mixed solution having no or such a remarkably low fluidity into the<br>
thin-film evaporator.<br>
[0016]<br>
A method in which a paraffin oil is used as a dispersion medium may be<br>
possible, but, as shown in Comparative Example 2 of the present application, the<br><br>
gelation cannot be prevented and no satisfactory results have been obtained.<br>
[0017]<br><br>
The present invention provides a new production method of TRB which<br>
method is free from the above described problems. Furthermore, the present<br>
invention provides a production method suitable for the industrial production<br>
excellent both in quality and in cost.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
[0018]<br>
The present inventors have made a diligent study for the purpose of solving<br>
the above described problems, and perfected the present invention by discovering<br>
that TRAL as a raw material serves as a satisfactory dispersion medium for<br>
aluminum oxide. Specifically, the production method of TRB of the present<br>
invention comprises a reaction synthesizing TRB and aluminum oxide from TRBO<br>
and TRAL, characterized in that the reaction is allowed to proceed so that TRAL is<br>
present at the end of the reaction in an amount of 0.5 moles or more per mole of<br>
the aluminum oxide produced in the reaction.<br>
[0019]<br>
Additionally, the production method of TRB of the present invention<br>
comprises synthesis of TRB and aluminum oxide from TRBO and TRAL and<br>
subsequent separation of TRB by distillation, characterized in that the distillation<br>
is carried out in the presence of the TRAL in an amount of 0.5 moles or more per<br>
mole of the aluminum oxide.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
[0020]<br>
The method of the present invention that is a rational production process of<br>
trihydrocarbylborane using no materials other than the raw materials enables the<br>
industrial production of trihydrocarbylborane excellent both in quality and in cost.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0023]<br>
In the present invention, each of the hydrocarbyl groups in each of TRB<br>
and TRAL has 1 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
[0024]<br>
The hydrocarbyl group in the present invention has 1 to 8 carbon atoms,<br>
and is selected from an aliphatic hydrocarbon group, an alicyclic hydrocarbon<br>
group and an aromatic hydrocarbon group; specific examples of the hydrocarbyl<br>
group may include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, a butyl group, a<br>
hexyl group, an octyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a phenyl group and a benzyl<br>
group. It is to be noted that different alkyl groups may be present in one and the<br>
same molecule in a mixed manner.<br>
[0025]<br><br>
TRBO as the raw material is prepared by means of a method well known in<br>
the art. Boron oxide and TRB, for example, are placed in a pressure reaction<br>
vessel so as to be approximately equivalent in molar ratio to each other, and are<br>
allowed to react with each other at the reaction temperatures of 200 to 300°C for 4<br>
to 30 hours while being agitated in an inert gas atmosphere to prepare TRBO with<br>
a yield of 70 to 90%. The unreacted boron oxide is separated by filtration and<br>
the TRBO as the filtrate is transferred to a subsequent step for reaction with TRAL.<br>
[0026]<br>
It is to be noted that it is rational from the viewpoint of process operation to<br>
dispose a filter, for filtration-separation of the unreacted boron oxide, inside a<br>
pressure reaction vessel for use in the synthesis of TRBO. Thus, the boron<br>
oxide separated and left in the reaction vessel can be used as it is in a<br>
subsequent reaction. The filtration property of the unreacted boron oxide is<br>
satisfactory, and various filters can be used; a metal mesh filter, for example, can<br>
be preferably used.<br>
[0027]<br>
The TRBO synthesis reaction solution obtained as a filtrate is reacted with<br>
TRAL in a TRB synthesis reaction vessel in the next step to prepare TRB and<br>
aluminum oxide. In this stage of the method of the present invention, it is<br>
essential that TRAL be present at the end of the reaction in an amount of 0.5<br>
moles or more per mole of the aluminum oxide produced with the progress of the<br>
reaction. Herewith, the phenomenon in which the aluminum oxide in the reaction<br>
solution is gelated and further, the whole reaction solution is solidified can be<br>
suppressed owing to the fact that the concomitantly present TRAL serves as a<br>
stable dispersion medium; the reaction solution is neither gelated nor solidified<br>
both through the reaction and through the next step for distilling TRB, and<br>
accordingly can maintain an easily handlable slurry state.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
No particular constraint is imposed on the reaction that fulfills the above-<br>
mentioned conditions, but an example thereof is a procedure as follows: TRAL is<br>
beforehand placed in the reaction vessel in a total necessary amount, namely, in<br>
an amount 2.5 or more times, preferably, 3 to 6 times the moles of TRBO; and a<br>
TRBO synthesis reaction solution is dropped bit by bit over a period of 1 to 5<br>
hours into the reaction vessel to react with TRAL under agitation and cooling.<br>
This procedure yields TRB with a yield of 95% or more. The reaction<br>
temperature varies depending on the hydrocarbyl groups contained in the raw<br>
materials, and is preferably set to fall within a range from room temperature to<br>
approximately 150°C. Another example of the reaction operation concerned is a<br>
method in which while the amount of TRAL is being maintained to be 2.5 or more<br>
times the moles of TRBO, both raw materials are simultaneously fed into the<br>
reaction vessel to react with each other, this method also giving a satisfactory<br>
result. It is to be noted that this method of simultaneous feeding of the raw<br>
materials has been found to lead to a tendency that the aluminum oxide produced<br>
in the reaction has a larger grain size of the obtained crystal thereof.<br>
[0029]<br>
Also, even in the reaction to be carried out by adding TRAL to TRBO, when<br>
the molar ratio TRAL/TRBO is approximately 1.1 or less, preferably 1.0 or less, no<br>
precipitation of gelated aluminum oxide occurs; hence, the TRAL and the TRBO<br>
that have been preliminarily reacted with each other in the above-mentioned<br>
molar ratio range may be added to TRAL, and the reaction may be allowed to<br>
proceed in such a way that the amount of TRAL is 2.5 times the moles of TRBO at<br>
the end of the reaction.<br>
[0030]<br><br>
From the reaction solution thus obtained, TRB as a product is recovered by<br>
distillation; in the method of the present invention, the distillation is carried out by<br>
making TRAL present in an amount of 0.5 moles or more per mole of the<br>
aluminum oxide in the reaction solution. When the amount of TRAL is small, the<br>
fluidity of the still bottom solution becomes poor, and when the amount of TRAL is<br>
large, the boiling point of the reaction solution is raised and the recovery rate of<br>
TRB is decreased. Therefore, the amount of TRAL is preferably approximately<br>
0.5 or more times and 6 or less times the moles of the aluminum oxide. In<br>
particular, the amount of TRAL of approximately 1 or more times and 3 or less<br>
times the moles of the aluminum oxide is excellent from the viewpoints of the<br>
handlability of the reaction solution and the distillation recovery rate of TRB.<br>
Thus, from the still bottom solution maintaining a satisfactory fluidity, aluminum<br>
oxide can be easily removed by filtration, and TRAL as the filtrate can be again<br>
used in the reaction (5) with TRBO.<br>
[0031]<br>
In an alternative method for obtaining TRB of the present invention, first,<br>
aluminum oxide is removed by filtration from the reaction product, thereafter the<br>
filtrate is separated and distilled to recover TRB as a product, and the still bottom<br>
solution containing TRAL as the main component can be again used in the<br>
reaction (5) with TRBO. In this case, the distillation step does not involve any<br>
solid matter, and hence any trouble due to the concentration of aluminum oxide in<br>
the distillation still is not caused, so that the distillation can be stably carried out.<br>
[0032]<br>
If expensive TRBO and TRB remain by adhesion to the aluminum oxide<br>
cake at the time of the filtration of aluminum oxide, it will result in a loss from the<br>
viewpoint of the process economics; thus, also preferable is a method in which<br><br>
the aluminum oxide cake is washed with relatively inexpensive TRAL and the<br>
washing waste is also used as a raw material.<br>
[0033]<br>
Additionally, if needed, the reaction product may be diluted with TRAL in a<br>
process for working up thereof to work it up better.<br>
[0034]<br>
A preferable distillation method is such that the reaction vessel, as it is, is<br>
used as a distillation still and a fractionating tower is disposed thereabove the still<br>
is heated under agitation; either a plate tower or a packed tower can be used as<br>
the fractionating tower, the packed tower being preferable because it can be small<br>
in size. In the case of TEB, for example, the boiling points of TEB and TRAL are<br>
96°C and 194°C to be largely different from each other, and thus, a sufficient<br>
separation efficiency and a sufficient distillation yield can be obtained by operating<br>
under the conditions that the number of the separation stages is 3 to 10, the reflux<br>
ratio is 1 to 10, the pressure ranges from atmospheric pressure down to a<br>
reduced pressure of 30 kPa, and the temperature ranges approximately from 95<br>
down to 65°C.<br>
[0035]<br>
The still bottom solution after distillation is a TRAL slurry solution of<br>
aluminum oxide. The slurry solution is taken out of the still, made to pass<br>
through a filtering device to separate aluminum oxide therefrom, and TRAL as the<br>
filtrate thus obtained is again used in the reaction (5). As for the aluminum oxide<br>
crystal obtained at this stage, the crystal obtained by the method of simultaneous<br>
feeding of the raw materials is larger in grain size, as described above, and hence<br>
the filtration property thereof tends to be satisfactory. The filter of the filtering<br>
device may be made of a ceramic, a cloth, a metal or the like. The TRAL as the<br>
filtrate has undergone the reaction and the distillation, so that there has been a<br><br>
fear of the compositional change and the quality degradation thereof, but has<br>
been able to be used again in the reaction (5) without causing any problem in<br>
such a way that the reaction achievement and the quality of the TRB thus<br>
obtained have not exhibited any changes.<br>
[0036]<br>
In another embodiment, first the reaction solution is passed through the<br>
filtering device to separate aluminum oxide, the filtrate is distilled to recover the<br>
product TRB, and the still bottom solution containing TRAL as the main<br>
component thereof is used in the reaction (5). The distillation conditions, the<br>
filtering device and the like are the same as described above. The thus obtained<br>
still bottom solution can be used again in the reaction (5), and the reaction<br>
achievement and the quality of the TRB thus obtained have not exhibited any<br>
changes.<br>
Examples<br>
[0037]<br>
Example-1<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 3 moles of<br>
triethylaluminum was placed, and 1 mole of triethylboroxine contained in a<br>
dropping funnel was dropped into the flask over a period of 3 hours to react with<br>
triethylaluminum. In this case, the reaction solution was cooled with a cooling<br>
medium so as for the temperature of the reaction solution to be maintained at<br>
70°C. Then, the flask was raised in temperature to 100°C in an oil bath, and 2.9<br>
moles of triethylborane at 95°C was obtained from the top of a tower packed with<br>
Dixon packing. An aluminum oxide-containing slurry solution was left in the flask.<br>
The slurry solution was filtered with a glass filter (25G-4; pore size: 5 to 10 µm)<br>
under a reduced pressure (150 Torr) over a period of 30 minutes. On the filter,<br><br>
0.98 mole of a white powder of aluminum oxide was left, and the colorless,<br>
transparent filtrate was 1.04 moles of triethylaluminum. The yield of<br>
triethylborane was 97.1 %. The purity of the obtained triethylborane was 99.9%<br>
or more on the basis of the results of the NMR analysis and the metal analysis<br>
carried out after hydrolysis.<br>
[0038]<br>
Example-2<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, from a dropping funnel<br>
containing 3 moles of triethylaluminum and from another dropping funnel<br>
containing 1 mole of triethylboroxine, the respective contents in these dropping<br>
funnels were simultaneously dropped over a period of 3 hours each at a rate<br>
maintained approximately constant, and thus the simultaneous-addition reaction<br>
was completed. In this case, the reaction solution was cooled with a cooling<br>
medium so as for the temperature of the reaction solution to be maintained at<br>
70°C. Then, the flask was raised in temperature in an oil bath, and 2.85 moles of<br>
triethylborane at 95°C was obtained from the top of a tower packed with Dixon<br>
packing. A white aluminum oxide-containing slurry solution was left in the flask.<br>
The slurry solution was filtered with a glass filter (25G-3; pore size: 20 to 30 µrn)<br>
under a reduced pressure (150 Torr) over a period of 10 minutes. On the filter,<br>
0.95 mole of aluminum oxide was left, and the colorless, transparent filtrate was<br>
1.08 moles of triethylaluminum. The yield and the purity of triethylborane were<br>
95.0% and 99.9% or more, respectively.<br>
[0039]<br>
Example-3<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 4 moles of<br>
triethylaluminum was placed, and 1 mole of triethylboroxine contained in a<br>
dropping funnel was dropped into the flask over a period of 3 hours to react with<br><br>
triethylaluminum. In this case, the reaction solution was cooled with a cooling<br>
medium so as for the temperature of the reaction solution to be maintained at<br>
70°C. Then, the flask was raised in temperature to 100°C in an oil bath, and<br>
2.93 moles of triethylborane at 95°C was obtained from the top of a tower packed<br>
with Dixon packing. An aluminum oxide-containing slurry solution was left in the<br>
flask. The amounts of the aluminum oxide and the triethylaluminum contained in<br>
the slurry solution were 0.98 mole and 2.04 moles, respectively. The yield and<br>
the purity of triethylborane were 97.6% and 99% or more, respectively.<br>
[0040]<br>
Example-4<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 4 moles of<br>
tributylaluminum was placed, and 1 mole of tributylboroxine contained in a<br>
dropping funnel was dropped into the flask over a period of 2 hours to react with<br>
tributylaluminum. In this case, the reaction solution was cooled with a cooling<br>
medium so as for the temperature of the reaction solution to be maintained at<br>
100°C. Then, the flask was raised in temperature to 140°C in an oil bath, the<br>
reaction solution was aged for 3 hours, and thereafter 2.9 moles of tributylborane<br>
at 80°C was obtained from the top of a tower packed with Dixon packing under a<br>
reduced pressure distillation condition of 6.5 mmHg. An aluminum oxide-<br>
containing slurry solution was left in the flask. The amounts of the aluminum<br>
oxide and the tributylaluminum contained in the slurry solution were 0.96 mole<br>
and 2.07 moles, respectively. The yield and the purity of tributylborane were<br>
96.7% and 98% or more, respectively.<br>
[0041]<br>
Example-5<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 4 moles of<br>
tripropylaluminum was placed, and 1 mole of tripropylboroxine contained in a<br><br>
dropping funnel was dropped into the flask over a period of 2 hours to react with<br>
tripropylaluminum. In this case, the reaction solution was cooled with a cooling<br>
medium so as for the temperature of the reaction solution to be maintained at<br>
100°C. Then, the flask was raised in temperature to 140°C in an oil bath, the<br>
reaction solution was aged for 3 hours, and thereafter 2.9 moles of tripropylborane<br>
at 75°C was obtained from the top of a tower packed with Dixon packing under a<br>
reduced pressure distillation condition of 36 mmHg. An aluminum oxide-<br>
containing slurry solution was left in the flask. The amounts of the aluminum<br>
oxide and the tripropylaluminum contained in the slurry solution were 0.96 mole<br>
and 2.07 moles, respectively. The yield and the purity of tripropylborane were<br>

[0042]<br>
Comparative Example-1<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 2 moles of<br>
triethylaluminum was placed. From the time by which 0.80 mole of<br>
triethylboroxine had been dropped to react with triethylaluminum into the flask<br>
from a dropping funnel containing 1 mole of triethylboroxine, the viscosity of the<br>
synthesis solution was increased, and at the time by which 0.85 mole of<br>
triethylboroxine had been dropped, the state of the flask content became a<br>
solidified state and the agitator was stopped. At this time, the temperature of the<br>
reaction solution was maintained at 70°C. After the rest of triethylboroxine had<br>
been added, the flask was raised in temperature from 120°C to 140°C in an oil<br>
bath, and 1.34 moles of triethylborane at 95°C was obtained from the top of a<br>
tower packed with Dixon packing. A white solid matter and a highly viscous<br>
matter were left in the flask. The yield of triethylborane was 44.7%.<br>
[0043]<br>
Comparative Example-2<br><br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 1 mole of<br>
triethylaluminum and 120 g of liquid paraffin were placed. At the time by which<br>
0.43 mole of triethylboroxine had been dropped to react with triethylaluminum into<br>
the flask from a dropping funnel containing 0.5 mole of triethylboroxine, the<br>
synthesis solution was converted from a gel state to a solidified state. Further<br>
addition of 120 g of liquid paraffin into the reaction flask failed in elimination of the<br>
solidified state, which was not changed. At this time, the temperature of the<br>
reaction solution was maintained at 70°C. After the rest, namely, 0.1 mole of<br>
triethylboroxine had been added, the flask was raised in temperature from 120°C<br>
to 140°C under atmospheric pressure, and 0.95 mole of triethylborane at 95°C<br>
was obtained from the top of a tower packed with Dixon packing. The liquid<br>
paraffin layer and a white solid matter adhered to the bottom of the flask were left<br>
in the flask. The yield of triethylborane was 63.3%.<br>
[0044]<br>
Comparative Example-3<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 0.63 mole of<br>
triethylboroxine was placed. At the time by which 0.7 mole of triethylaluminum<br>
had been dropped into the flask from a dropping funnel containing 1.26 moles of<br>
triethylaluminum, the synthesis solution started to become clouded, and at the<br>
time by which 0.73 mole of triethylaluminum had been dropped, the synthesis<br>
solution was gelated to become a solidified state. Because the continuation of<br>
the agitation became impossible, 200 ml of liquid paraffin was added to the flask,<br>
and the rest, namely, 0.53 mole of triethylaluminum was drooped into the flask to<br>
react with triethylboroxine. The state of the content of the flask after the reaction<br>
was such that a gelated and solidified matter remained adhered to the inner wall<br>
of the flask without forming a dispersed state. The flask was heated up to 180°C<br>
to carry out distillation, and consequently, the yield of triethylborane was 71%.<br><br>
[0045]<br>
Comparative Example-4<br>
In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an agitator, 0.5 mole of<br>
tributylboroxine was placed. At the time by which 0.6 mole of tributylaluminum<br>
had been dropped into the flask from a dropping funnel containing 1 mole of<br>
tributylaluminum, the synthesis solution was gelated to become a solidified state.<br>
Because the continuation of the agitation became impossible, 200 ml of liquid<br>
paraffin was added to the flask, and the rest, namely, 0.4 mole of tributylaluminum<br>
was dropped into the flask to react with triethylboroxine. In this case, the<br>
reaction solution was heated with a heating medium so as for the temperature of<br>
the reaction solution to be maintained at 100°C. Then, the flask was raised in<br>
temperature to 140°C, the reaction solution was aged for 3 hours, and thereafter<br>
0.95 mole of tributylborane at 80°C was obtained from the top of a tower packed<br>
with Dixon packing under a reduced pressure distillation condition of 6.5 mmHg.<br>
A gelated solid matter and a highly viscous matter were left in the flask. The<br>
yield of tributylborane was 63.3%.<br>
[0046]<br>
Example-6<br>
The slurry-like residual mixture in the flask in Example-2 was filtered with a<br>
10-µm filtering device to recover 1.8 moles of triethylaluminum. This filtering was<br>
able to be carried out smoothly. In a 1-L four-neck flask equipped with an<br>
agitator, 1.8 moles of the recovered triethylaluminum and additional 2.2 moles of<br>
triethylaluminum were placed in combination, and 1 mole of triethylboroxine<br>
contained in a dropping funnel was dropped into the flask over a period of 3 hours<br>
to react with triethylaluminum. In this case, the reaction solution was cooled with<br>
a cooling medium so as for the temperature of the reaction solution to be<br>
maintained at 70°C. Then, the flask was raised in temperature to 100°C in an oil<br><br>
bath, and 2.92 moles of triethylborane at 95°C was obtained from the top of a tower<br>
packed with Dixon packing. An aluminum oxide-containing slurry solution was left in the<br>
flask. The amounts of the aluminum oxide and the triethylaluminum contained in the<br>
slurry solution were 0.98 mole and 2.04 moles, respectively. The yield of<br>
triethyulborane was 97.3%. The purity of the obtained triethylborane was 99% or more<br>
on the basis of the results of the NMR analysis and the metal analysis carried out after<br>
hydrolysis.<br>
Example-7<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the TEB production flow is described as a<br>
representative example. A TEBO synthesis reaction vessel (1) is a 100-L stainless steel<br>
vessel which has a metal mesh filter (2) disposed thereinside, and agitating and cooling<br>
means. A TEB synthesis reaction vessel, (3) doubling as a distillation still is a 250-L<br>
stainless steel vessel which has an agitating means, and a heating/cooling means. To<br>
the reaction vessel 3 connected is a distillation tower (4) in which 16 mm Raschig rings<br>
of 100 mm in inside diameter are packed along a height of 2 m. A filtering device (5)<br>
having a 10-nm metal mesh filter disposed thereinside.<br>
In the vessel 1, 25.6 kg (0.368 kmol) of boron oxide and 36.1 kg (0.368 kmol) of<br>
TEB were placed, and were reacted with each other in a nitrogen atmosphere at a<br>
reaction temperature of 210°C under a pressure of 1.7 MPa for 24 hours. In the vessel<br>
3,154 kg (1.5 kmol) of TEAL was placed, and 55.5 kg filtrate TEBO and 2.32Kg of TEB<br>
obtained by separating the unreacted boron oxide through the filter (2) were fed into<br>
the vessel (3) over a period of 4 hours while the solution temperature was being<br>
maintained at 70°C. Then, the solution<br><br>
temperature was raised to start the distillation operation. When the temperature<br>
exceeded 100°C, the distillation of TEB started. Thereafter, by regulating the reflux ratio<br>
to be 5 to 10, 99.5 kg (1.02 kmol) of TEB as the distillate was obtained in a receiver<br>
(6). In the vessel (1), 2.56 kg (0.037 kmol) of the unreacted boron oxide filtration-<br>
separated from the still bottom solution and additional 23.1 kg (0.33 kmol) of boron<br>
oxide were placed in combination, and then 35.9 kg (0.366 kmol) of the obtained TEB<br>
was also place, and the same reaction as described above was carried out to yield 55.5<br>
kg of TEB. After distillation, the still bottom solution in the vessel (3) was composed of<br>
33.7 kg (0.33 kmol) of aluminum oxide, 78.6 kg (0.688 kmol) of TEAL, 1.01 kg (0.01<br>
kmol) of TEB and 1.13 kg (0.007 kmol) of TEBO; and the aluminum oxide was filtered<br>
through the filtering device (5). The filtrate was again fed into the vessel (3), and TEAL<br>
was further added so as for the total amount of TEAL to be 154 kg (1.5 kmol). Then,<br>
the solution obtained through the filter (2) was also fed into the vessel (3), and the TEB<br>
synthesis reaction was carried out and the distillation was also carried out in the same<br>
manner. This cycle was repeated 5 times. A stable, high quality product of TEB was<br>
obtained in an amount of 63 to 64 kg, and the yield thereof based on the consumed<br>
raw material TEAL was maintained at approximately 96%.<br><br>
