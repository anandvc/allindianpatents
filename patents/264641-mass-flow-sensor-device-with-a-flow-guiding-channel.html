				<td>Description<br>
MASS FLOW SENSOR DEVICE WITH A FLOW GUIDING CHANNEL<br>
The invention relates to a mass flow sensor device. Such mass<br>
flow sensor devices are suitable for sensing a mass flow in a<br>
main channel. Such a main channel can be, for example, an<br>
intake tract of an internal combustion engine. Control of, for<br>
example, an internal combustion engine or else diagnostics can<br>
be carried out as a function of the mass flow which is sensed<br>
by the mass flow sensor device. For these purposes, it is<br>
important to sense the actual mass flow reliably and as<br>
precisely as possible even under different operating<br>
conditions.<br>
DE 100 11 709 A1 discloses a mass flow sensor device which is<br>
arranged in a main channel and is assigned a pipe body which is<br>
assigned coaxially to the main channel.<br>
Corresponding mass flow sensor devices with at least one pipe<br>
body which is arranged parallel to a main flow direction in the<br>
main channel are also known from DE 100 355 43 Al and DE 197 35<br>
664 A1.<br>
DE 101 54 253 Al discloses a mass flow sensor device with a<br>
vane-shaped shielding body which shields the air mass flow<br>
sensor against particles and feeds air to it from the outer<br>
wall of the pipe. Here, the mass flow is extracted<br>
asymmetrically in the main channel.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a mass flow sensor<br>
device which can be operated precisely and reliably.<br><br>
The object is achieved by means of the features of patent claim<br>
1. Advantageous refinements of the invention are characterized<br>
in the subclaims.<br>
The invention is defined by a mass flow sensor device for at<br>
least partial arrangement in a main channel in which a mass<br>
flow flows in a main flow direction. The mass flow sensor<br>
device has a mass flow sensor with a bypass channel which has<br>
an inlet via which mass flow can flow out of the main channel<br>
into the bypass channel. In addition, the mass flow sensor has<br>
at least one mass flow sensor element by means of which a<br>
variable which is characteristic of the mass flow into the<br>
bypass channel can be sensed. A flow guiding channel is<br>
provided whose inlet cross section, which runs perpendicularly<br>
with respect to the main flow direction, has, with its outlet<br>
cross section which runs perpendicularly with respect to the<br>
main flow direction, a maximum overlap of a third with respect<br>
to the inlet cross section. In this context, the maximum<br>
overlap refers to the respective projection of the inlet and<br>
outlet cross sections onto one another. The inlet cross section<br>
is arranged essentially centrally in the main channel. The flow<br>
guiding channel is embodied and arranged in such a way that<br>
said channel directs at least some of the medium flowing in it<br>
to the inlet of the mass flow sensor and has at least one<br>
cutout toward the main channel, via which cutout communication<br>
occurs with the main channel by bypassing the bypass channel.<br>
This cutout can be embodied, for example, outside the region of<br>
the overlap or in the region of its outlet cross section. In<br>
particular, the outlet cross section is positioned upstream of<br>
the inlet of the bypass channel in the main flow direction, and<br>
is, if appropriate, embodied so as to be separate from the<br>
inlet. It is particularly advantageous that the inlet cross<br>
section and outlet cross section do not overlap at all.<br>
By means of the flow guiding channel in conjunction with the at<br>
least one cutout it is easily possible to ensure<br><br>
that particles such as, for example, dust or else water<br>
droplets which are located in the flowing medium can be<br>
separated off to a large extent at a wall of the flow guiding<br>
channel by means of centrifugal force separation, and can be<br>
carried off via the at least one cutout into the main channel<br>
by bypassing the bypass channel. As a result, the measurement<br>
behavior of the sensor element is then unaffected by these<br>
particles, and can therefore be very precise and also reliable.<br>
Furthermore, the extraction of the mass flow which occurs<br>
essentially centrally in order to feed to the bypass channel<br>
permits very robust sensing of the mass flow in the main<br>
channel, in particular even when there are inhomogeneous flow<br>
profiles in the main channel, such as is generally the case,<br>
for example, directly downstream of air filters. As a result,<br>
dependence of the measurement signal of the mass flow sensor<br>
element on an installation angle with respect to the pipe cross<br>
section of the main channel can also be significantly reduced.<br>
According to one advantageous refinement, the flow guiding<br>
channel has a pipe longitudinal axis which is tilted with<br>
respect to the main flow direction. In this way, the flow<br>
guiding channel can be implemented particularly easily.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, the flow guiding channel is assigned a fastener for<br>
securement in the main channel, which fastener is embodied in<br>
such a way that it shields the mass flow sensor from the flow<br>
in the main channel in a region of the mass flow sensor which<br>
is at the end side with respect to the main flow direction. In<br>
this way, it is possible, for example, to prevent very<br>
effectively the ingress of undesired particles such as, for<br>
example, water droplets along, for example, a housing of the<br>
mass flow sensor, which can otherwise occur, for example, by<br>
means of a creepage process. In this context, the fastener can,<br>
in particular, also advantageously be made<br><br>
streamlined and therefore reduce pressure loss.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, the fastener has a cutout, medium flowing through<br>
which is directed to a temperature sensor element which is<br>
provided for sensing the temperature of the flowing medium in<br>
the mass flow sensor. In this way it is possible, in particular<br>
in conjunction with the shielding effect, for the temperature<br>
of the flowing medium to be sensed precisely and largely<br>
without delay.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement, the section of<br>
the fastener which has a shielding effect with respect to the<br>
end side region of the mass flow sensor is embodied first, in<br>
the main flow direction, as a narrow web. A non-shielding<br>
section of the fastener is embodied so as to widen in relation<br>
to the narrow web, at least in part of the main flow direction<br>
with respect to said narrow web. In this way, a good flow<br>
divider property, which approximates a symmetrical design, can<br>
be achieved even with an asymmetrical design of the fastener.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, the flow guiding channel is embodied in an S shape.<br>
This permits any flow separation to be satisfactorily avoided.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, the flow guiding channel is embodied in such a way<br>
that its cross section decreases in the flow direction. In this<br>
way, stable flow conditions can easily be achieved by<br>
accelerating the flow.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement, guide contours<br>
are provided in the wall of the flow guiding channel.<br><br>
This has the advantage that the particles which are to be<br>
carried away, in particular water droplets and the like, can be<br>
guided selectively.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, the flow guiding channel is manufactured as an<br>
injection molded component in one piece with the main channel.<br>
In this way, the mass flow sensor device can be manufactured<br>
particularly cost effectively.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in more<br>
detail below with reference to the schematic drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a first longitudinal cross section through a<br>
first embodiment of the mass flow sensor device,<br>
Figure 2 shows a second longitudinal cross section through the<br>
first embodiment of the mass flow sensor device<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal section according<br>
to figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross section through a main channel of the<br>
first embodiment of the mass flow sensor device, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a longitudinal cross section through a second<br>
embodiment of the mass flow sensor device.<br>
Elements of identical design or function are characterized with<br>
the same reference symbols in all the figures. A mass flow<br>
sensor device is provided to be arranged at least partially in<br>
a main channel 2. During correct operation of the mass flow<br>
sensor device, it is arranged at least partially in the main<br>
channel. It can also encompass the main channel, but does not<br>
have to.<br><br>
The mass flow sensor device (figure 1) comprises a mass flow<br>
sensor which is arranged at least partially in the main channel<br>
2.	Figure 1 illustrates that part of the mass flow sensor 1<br>
projects into the main channel 2. The main flow direction of the<br>
medium which flows in the main channel is denoted by the arrow 3.<br>
This medium is generally air which, under certain circumstances<br>
may also contain particles in solid or liquid form, for example<br>
dust or water droplets.<br>
The mass flow sensor 1 has a housing 5 in which a bypass channel<br>
7 is formed. The bypass channel 7 has an inlet section 9, a first<br>
bypass channel section 11 which is embodied perpendicularly with<br>
respect to the main flow direction, a second bypass channel<br>
section 13 which is embodied parallel to the main flow direction<br>
3,	and a third bypass channel section 15 which is again embodied<br>
perpendicularly with respect to the main flow direction.<br>
In addition, mass flow sensor elements 17, 19, which preferably<br>
comprise temperature dependent resistors which are preferably<br>
connected to one another in the form of a Wheatstone measuring<br>
bridge according to the principle of an anemometer, are arranged<br>
in the bypass channel.<br>
In addition, a temperature sensor 21 which is preferably embodied<br>
in tablet shape and is provided for sensing the temperature of<br>
the medium flowing in the main channel 2 is also preferably<br>
assigned to the mass flow sensor 1.<br>
In addition, a flow guiding channel 2 3 is mounted upstream of the<br>
mass flow sensor 1 and, in particular, the inlet section 9 of the<br>
bypass channel 7 in the main flow direction. The flow guiding<br>
channel 23 is embodied in such a way that its inlet cross section<br>
25, which runs perpendicularly with respect to the main flow<br>
direction 3, has, with respect to its outlet cross section 27<br>
which runs perpendicularly with respect to the main flow<br>
direction 23, a maximum<br><br>
overlap of a third with respect to the inlet cross section 23.<br>
The inlet cross section 25 is essentially arranged centrally in<br>
the main channel 2. The flow guiding channel 23 is embodied and<br>
arranged in such a way that said flow guiding channel 23<br>
directs at least some of the medium flowing in it to the inlet<br>
section 9 of the mass flow sensor 1 and has at least one cutout<br>
29 toward the main channel 1, via which cutout communication<br>
occurs with the main channel 1 by bypassing the bypass channel<br>
7. In the exemplary embodiment in figure 1, the cutout is<br>
formed in the region of the outlet cross section 27. However,<br>
additionally or alternatively, one or more corresponding<br>
cutouts can also be provided upstream thereof in the wall of<br>
the flow guiding channel.<br>
The flow guiding channel 23 is secured in the main channel 2 by<br>
means of a fastener 35. The flow guiding channel 23 with its<br>
fastener 35 is preferably manufactured in one piece with the<br>
main channel 2 by injection molding.<br>
However, the fastener 35 can also be embodied as a separate<br>
part from the main channel 2.<br>
A cutout 37 (figure 3), medium flowing through which is<br>
directed to the temperature sensor element 21, is preferably<br>
provided in the fastener.<br>
The fastener preferably has a first web 39 and a second web 43.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a longitudinal section perpendicularly to<br>
the sectional direction according to figure 1, with relevant<br>
areas being illustrated in several sectional planes which are<br>
characterized by A-A, B-B and C-C. The first web 39 is firstly<br>
embodied in the main flow direction as a very narrow web and is<br>
then widened downstream to form a shielding body 41. The<br>
shielding body 41 is preferably embodied in such a way that it<br>
shields part or a large part of the housing 5 of the mass flow<br>
sensor 1 from<br><br>
the flow in the main channel 2. The second web 43 of the<br>
fastener 35 preferably has the contour illustrated in figure 2<br>
(see sectional plane C-C) . In this way, a particularly<br>
favorable flow divider property, which approximates a<br>
symmetrical embodiment of the first and second webs 39, 43, can<br>
be achieved by widening the second web 43 upstream in the main<br>
flow direction 3 compared to the first web 39.<br>
The flow guiding channel 23 is preferably embodied in an S<br>
shape. In addition, it is also apparent in figure 1 that the<br>
cross section of the flowing guiding channel 23 along the main<br>
flow direction 3 decreases in the flow direction of the medium<br>
within the flow guiding channel 23. However, the cross section<br>
can alternatively also remain the sane, for example.<br>
Guide contours by means of which particles, in particular water<br>
droplets or else oil droplets, which are separated off by<br>
centrifugal force separation are guided selectively along the<br>
wall, specifically toward at least one cutout 29 in the flow<br>
guiding channel 23, are preferably provided in the wall of the<br>
flow guiding channel and in this way these particles can be<br>
selectively kept away from the mass flow sensor elements 17,<br>
19.<br><br>
