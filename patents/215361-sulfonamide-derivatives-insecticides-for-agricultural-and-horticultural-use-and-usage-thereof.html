SULFONAMIDE DERIVATIVES, INSECTIC1DES FOR<br>
AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL USE,<br>
AND USAGE THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to sulfonamide derivatives or salts thereof, agricultural and horticultural insectiC1des containing any of said compounds as an active ingredient, and their usage.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Compounds analogous to the sulfonamide derivatives of the present invention have been known to be useful as agricultural and horticultural insectiC1des (see, for example, JP-A-11-240857 or JP-A-2001-131141).  These references, however, do not describe working examples, physical properties and the like with respect to the compounds represented by general formula (I) of the present invention.<br>
The production of agricultural and horticultural crops and the like is still badly damaged by insect pests and the like, and the development of a novel agricultural and horticultural insectiC1de is desired because of, for example, the appearance of insect pests resistant to existing chemicals.  In addition, because of the increased population of aged<br><br>
farmers, and the like, various labor-saving application methods are desired and the development of an agricultural and horticultural insectiC1de having properties suitable for the application methods is desired.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors earnestly investigated in order to develop a novel agricultural and horticultural insectiC1de, and conseguently found that the sulfonamide derivatives represented by general formula (I) or salts thereof of the present invention are novel compounds not known in any literature and are excellent agricultural and horticultural insectiC1des which are effective at a lower dosage as compared with the analogous compounds disclosed in the above prior art references, whereby the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and then poured into ice water, followed by three runs of extraction with ethyl acetate.  The extract solution was washed twice with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and then once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.  The solvent was distilled off and the crude crystals thus obtained were washed twice with a solvent (hexane : ethyl acetate =4:1) to obtain 5.0 g (yield 94%) of 1,3-dihydro-7-iodo-3-{2-methyl-4-[1,2,2,2-tetrafluoro-1- (trifluoro-methyl)ethyl]phenylimino}-2-benzofuran-l-one.<br>

The content of the compound as active ingredient may be varied as required, and may be properly chosen in the range of 0.01 to 90 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the agrohorticultural insectiC1de.  For example, in dusts or granules, the suitable content of the compound as active ingredient is from 0.01 to 50 parts by weight.  In emulsifiable concentrates or flowable wettable powders, it is also from 0.01 to 50 parts by weight.<br>
The agrohorticultural insectiC1de of the<br><br>
present invention is used to control a variety of insect pests in the following manner: it is applied to a crop on which the insect pests are expected to appear, or a site where appearance or growth of the insect pests is undesirable, as it is or after being properly diluted with or suspended in water or the like, in an amount effective for control of the insect pests.<br>
The applying dosage of the agrohorticultural insectiC1de of the present invention is varied depending upon various factors such as a purpose, insect pests to be controlled, a growth stage of a plant, tendency of insect pests appearance, weather, environmental conditions, a preparation form, an application method, an application site and application time.  It may be properly chosen in the range of 0.001 g to 10 kg, preferably 0.01 g to 1 kg, (in terms of the compound as active ingredient) per 10 areas depending upon purposes.<br>
