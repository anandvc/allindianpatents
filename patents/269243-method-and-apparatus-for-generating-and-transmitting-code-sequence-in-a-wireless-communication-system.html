				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR GENERATING AND TRANSMITTING CODE<br>
SEQUENCE IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of generating and transmitting code<br>
sequence, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for generating and transmitting<br>
code sequence in a wireless communication system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Usually, a pilot signal or a preamble of a wireless communication system is referred<br>
to as a reference signal used for initial synchronization, cell search, and channel estimation.<br>
Further, the preamble is comprised of a code sequence, and the code sequence is further<br>
comprised of orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal which represent good correlation properties.<br>
For example, a Hadamard matrix of 128x128 is used in a portable internet (PI) to<br>
insert the code sequence to the frequency domain. In so doing, 127 types of code sequences<br>
are used.<br>
Although the Hadmard code sequence and a poly-phase Constant Amplitude Zero<br>
Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) code sequence are orthogonal codes, a number of codes used to<br>
maintain orthogonality is limited. For example, a number of N orthogonal codes in a NxN<br>
Hadamard matrix is N, and a number of N orthogonal codes that can be expressed by the<br>
CAZAC codes is N and a prime number smaller than N (David C. Chu, "Polyphase Codes<br><br>
with Good Periodic Correlation Properties," Information Theory IEEE Transaction on, vol.<br>
18, issue 4, pp. 531-532, July 1972). With respect to CAZAC sequence types, GCL CAZAC<br>
and Zadoff-Chu CAZAC are often used.<br>
If the code sequence is generated using the Hadamard codes, N number of sequence<br>
types corresponding to the entire length of the codes is generated. However, the if the code<br>
sequence is generated using the CAZAC codes, only half or N/2 number of sequence types<br>
are generated.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for<br>
generating and transmitting code sequence in a wireless communication system that<br>
substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the<br>
related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of generating a code<br>
sequence in a wireless communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for generating a<br>
code sequence in a wireless communication system.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part<br>
in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary<br>
skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the<br>
invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and<br><br>
attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof<br>
as well as the appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>
the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method of generating a code<br>
sequence in a wireless communication system includes recognizing a desired length of the<br>
code sequence, generating a code sequence having a length different from the desired length,<br>
and modifying the length of the generated code sequence to equal the desired length. Here,<br>
the step of modifying includes discarding at least one element of the generated code<br>
sequence or inserting at least one null element to the generated code sequence.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, method of generating a code sequence in<br>
a wireless communication system includes a recognizing a desired length of a first code<br>
sequence, generating a second code sequence having a length different from the desired<br>
length of the first code sequence, and modifying the length of the second code sequence to<br>
equal the desired length of the first code sequence. Here, the step of modifying includes<br>
discarding at least one element of the modified code sequence if the length of the modified<br>
code sequence is longer than the desired length of the first code sequence or inserting at<br>
least one null element to the modified code sequence if the length of the modified second<br>
code sequence is shorter than the desired length of the first code sequence.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for generating a code<br>
sequence in a wireless communication system includes a sequence selection unit for<br>
recognizing a desired length of the code sequence, generating a code sequence having a<br><br>
length different from the desired length, and modifying the length of the generated code<br>
sequence to equal the desired length, wherein the sequence selection unit discards at least<br>
one element of the generated code sequence or inserts at least one null element to the<br>
generated code sequence in modifying the length of the generated code sequence, and a<br>
transmitting unit for transmitting the modified generated code sequence via at least one<br>
antenna.<br>

detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are<br>
intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the<br>
same or like parts.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a structure of an apparatus for transmitting data using Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) or OFDM Access (OFDMA) scheme. Figure 2<br>
illustrates a structure of an apparatus for receiving data using OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br><br>
In Figure 1, traffic data and control data are multiplexed at a muxer 11. Here, the<br>
traffic data is used to provide service from a transmitting end to a receiving end, and the<br>
control data is used to facilitate transmission from the transmitting end to the receiving end.<br>
The discussion relating to the present invention regarding the code sequence which relates<br>
to a type of a code sequence of the control data. The code sequence can be used for initial<br>
synchronization, cell search, or channel estimation.<br>
Depending on the communication system, the code sequence can be used in various<br>
forms. For example, the code sequence in an IEEE 802.16 wideband wireless access system<br>
can be used in a preamble or a pilot signal format, and in a multi-input, multi-output<br>
(MIMO) system, the code sequence can be used as a midamble format.<br>
After being processed at the muxer 11, the multiplexed traffic and control data is<br>
then channel coded by a channel coding module 12. Channel coding is used to allow the<br>
receiving end to correct error that can occur during transmission by adding parity bits.<br>
Examples of channel coding include convolution coding, turbo coding, and low density<br>
parity check (LDPC) coding.<br>
Thereafter, the channel coded data is modulated by a digital modulation module 13<br>
in which data symbols are mapped using algorithms such as a quadrature phase shift keying<br>
(QPSK) or a 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM). The mapped data symbols are<br>
then processed by a subchannel modulation module 14 through which the data symbols are<br>
mapped to each subcarrier of the OFDM system or OFDMA system. Then, the data symbols<br>
mapped to subcarriers are processed by an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) module 15<br><br>
which transform the data symbols into a signal in a time domain. The transformed data<br>
symbols are then processed through a filter 16 and farther processed through a digital-to-<br>
analog conversion (DAC) module 17 where the filtered data symbols are converted to<br>
analog signals. Lastly, the analog signals are converted into a radio frequency (RF) by a RF<br>
module 18 which is then transmitted via an antenna 19 to the receiving end.<br>
Based on the type of generated code (e.g., CAZAC code), the steps of channel<br>
coding and/or symbol mapping can be omitted. Figure 2 illustrates a receiving end whose<br>
processes are inverse to those of the transmitting end.<br>
A code sequence is used for transmitting control information, which includes<br>
identification (ID) and synchronization information, to classify types of sequences in a<br>
communication system. In order for more effective reception of the control information<br>
using code sequence, the code sequence can be adjusted or modified. Further, the code<br>
sequence can be applied to all of the channels that use code sequence for control signaling<br>
such as a random access channel (RACH), downlink/uplink reference symbol, channel<br>
quality information (CQ1), and Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negalive Acknowledgement<br>
(NACK).<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram illustrating adjusting a code sequence. More specifically,<br>
a length of the code sequence is defined as N, a number of codes in the code sequence is<br>
defined as NaNi-NXN, and a code sequence set defined as aaNi-NXN. In operation, the code<br>
sequence set aNi-NXN having Nseq N number of codes can be extended to a code sequence<br>
set aNi-NXN having NseqM number of codes.<br><br><br>
Referring to Figure 3, a code sequence set aaNi-NXN , having Nseq M number of code<br>
sequence(s) where each code sequence has length M, can be generated based on the code<br>
generation algorithm based on code type in which a value of length M is a natural number<br>
greater than a value of length N (S301). Here, the code types include Hadamard code,<br>
Pseudo Noise (PN) code, and a Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) code,<br>
among others to be used for initial synchronization, cell search, and channel estimation in<br>
the wireless communication system. The code sequence set having length M per each code<br>
type can be generated by various schemes as discussed. As for the CAZAC code, the value<br>
of length M is a smallest prime number greater than the value of length//, preferably.<br>
Subsequently, a code sequence set aaNi-NXN , having Nseq M number of code<br>
sequences, can be generated where a resulting length of the code sequence is length N.<br>
More specifically, the code sequence set aNi-NXN , having Nseq M number of code<br>
sequences where each code sequence has length M (from step S3 01), can have elements of<br>
the code sequence removed. That is, elements which comprise each code sequence can be<br>
removed from the code sequence allowing the length of the code sequence to be adjusted or<br>
shortened. Here, M-N number of elements can be removed from the code sequence whose<br>
length corresponds to length M. By removing elements from the code sequence with length<br><br>
M, a code sequence having length N can be generated. As discussed, N is smaller than M.<br>
Consequently, a code sequence set aNi-NXN, having Nseq M number of code sequences in<br>
which each code sequence has length N, can be generated (S302).<br>
A code sequence is used for transmitting control information, which includes<br>
identification (ID) and synchronization information, to classify types of sequences in a<br>
communication system. Currently in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term<br>
Evolution (LTE), a CAZAC sequence is being considered.<br>
The CAZAC sequence can be used by channels to output various IDs and<br>
information. The channels include channels for downlink synchronization (e.g., primary<br>
synchronization channel, secondary synchronization channel, and broadcast channel),<br>
uplink synchronization (e.g., random access channel), and pilot channels (e.g., data pilot<br>
and channel quality pilot). Further, the CAZAC sequence can be used in scrambling as well<br>
as channels that use code sequence such as RACH.<br>
Although mere are various types of the CAZAC sequences, there are two types of<br>
often used CAZAC sequences - GCL CAZAC and Zadoff-Chu CAZAC. The Zadoff-Chu<br>
CAZAC sequence can be defined by the following equations.<br><br><br>
Here, k denotes sequence index, TV denotes a length of CAZAC to be generated, and<br>
M denotes sequence ID.<br>
If the Zadoff-Chu CAZAC sequence and the GCL CAZAC sequence are expressed<br>
by c(k;N,M) as shown in Equations 1 and 2, then the sequences have the following three<br>
(3) characteristics as presented in following equations.<br><br>
According to Equation 3, the CAZAC sequence always has a size of 1, and the<br>
CAZAC sequence of Equation 4 has an auto-correlation function denoted by a delta<br>
function. Here, the auto-correlation is based on circular correlation. Further, Equation 5 is a<br>
cross-correlation which is constant if N is a prime number.<br>
If the length to be applied in the wireless communication system for generating the<br>
CAZAC sequence is denoted by L, a method for generating the CAZAC sequence sets N of<br>
Equations 1 and 2 to equal L(N=L)- identified as step (1). Step (2) can be identified by a<br>
method where a value of N is set to be a prime number greater than a value of length L for<br>
generating the CAZAC sequence.<br><br>
Referring to the characteristics of the generated CAZAC sequence having a<br>
specified length of L, if L is not a prime number, the generated CAZAC sequence can<br>
include M = 1,2,... L-l number of codes, some of which are repeated codes. In other words,<br>
the number of different codes is less than L-l number of codes. On the contrary, if L is a<br>
prime number, there is L-l number of different codes. The above descriptions may also be<br>
applied to other types of code sequences and are not limited to Zadoff-Chu CAZAC<br>
sequence.<br>
Further, the following technique has been considered. More specifically, if the<br>
length of code to be applied to the system is not a prime number, and there are a large<br>
number of codes to be used, a smallest prime number greater than L was selected. Using the<br>
selected prime number, the CAZAC sequence was generated, and discards or removes at<br>
least one element of the generated CAZAC sequence for use. This technique is different<br>
than the technique introduced with respect to step 1.<br>
For example, assume that a number of codes of a CAZAC code sequence (N) is<br>
1024. The following equation can be used to express an algorithm for generating a Zadoff-<br>
Chu CAZAC code.<br><br><br>
In Equation 6, A and M are natural numbers, and index(A)(= 0,1,2,...,N SEQ M -l)is<br>
an index of A in ascending order. In order to extend the CAZAC sequence where N=1024, a<br>
smallest prime number greater than 1024 is used. That is, the smallest prime number greater<br>
than 1024 is 1031. As such, the code sequence set aaNi-NXN where M=1031 is applied to<br>
Equation 6.<br>
Since M (=1031) is a prime number, NSeq M =1030. Furthermore, A can be referred<br>
to as a seed value used to generate a code sequence maintaining CAZAC properties. If M is<br>
a prime number, a total of M - 1 number of code sequences can be generated. In other<br>
words, for example, if M- 1024, a total of 512 (=1024/2 or NIT) number of code sequences<br>
are generated. However, if M - 1031, a total of 1030 number of code sequences (M- 1) are<br>
generated. Moreover, the cross-correlation properties of the generated code sequence are<br>
better if Mis a prime number than a composite number.<br>
In order to adjust or modify the CAZAC code sequence set aaNi-NXN where M =<br>
1031 to a code sequence set aaNi-NXN whose length is N = 1024, M-N number of elements<br>
can be removed from index p. — N,... ,M -1, generating a code sequence set aaNi-NXN.<br>
In determining the value of M, although the number of code sequences can increase<br>
with increase in value of N, it is preferable to determine the value of M based on the code<br>
sequence whose length is N that promotes maintenance of good correlation properties. In<br>
case of the CAZAC code, optimum correlation properties can be attained if the value of<br>
length Mis the smallest prime number greater than the value of length//.<br><br>
If the code sequence set aaNi-NXN generated using length N=1024 is compared with<br>
the code sequence set aaNi-NXN , a total number code sequences of the former can be<br>
represented by Nil or 512 (=1024/2) code sequences having an index<br>
0,1,2, •••,7V/ 2 -1(/V = 1024), and a total number of code sequences of the latter can be<br>
represented by M -1 or 1030 having an index 0,1,2, ....M-2 (M =1031).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates cross-correlation properties of the generated code sequence.<br>
More specifically, the cross-correlation properties of aNi-NXN(k = l,2,---,Nseq u -1)<br>
associated with the remaining Nseq-M (1029) code sequences for a°aNi-NXN code sequence of<br>
the code sequence set aN mn mxn The figure illustrates this with respect to amplitude, code<br>
index, and time index.<br>
Further, Figure 5 illustrates a generated CAZAC sequence aaNi-NXN using N (=1024).<br>
More specifically, the figures illustrate cross-correlation properties of<br>
akaNi-NXN(k = l,2,---,Nsei_M -1) regarding the remaining Nseq N(511)code sequences. The<br>
figure illustrates this with respect to amplitude, code index, and time index. Between Figure<br>
4 and Figure 5, the cross-correlation properties of the generated code sequence of Figure 4<br>
are better.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a cross-correlation properties cumulative distribution function<br>
(CDF) of the code sequences that can be generated according to the code sequence aseq mxn<br>
and the CAZAC sequence aaNi-NXN when 7= 1024.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the cross-correlation properties CDF of the code sequences that<br>
can be generated based on the CAZAC sequence generated using the prime number of<br><br>
N=1031 and a code sequence set aaNi-NXN having length of 1024 (seven (7) elements<br>
removed). The performance lines of Figures 4-7 indicate that the code sequence set with<br>
seven (7) elements removed has equivalent cross-correlation properties compared to the<br>
original code sequence set.<br>
As discussed, the codes in addition to the CAZAC code are available, such as the<br>
PN code and the Hadamard code. The discussion with respect to the CAZAC code sequence<br>
can also be applied to the PN code and the Hadamard code. With respect to the PN code, a<br>
modular shift register generator is used to generate the code sequences. If a number of shift<br>
registers generated is represented by N, a code sequence having a length of 2N - 1 is<br>
generated. Thereafter, a value "1" is added to the shift register, resulting in a length 2N+! - 1,<br>
and then, adjust the length to equal 2N.<br>
With respect to the Hadamard codes, a number of code sequences, which equal the<br>
length of the code sequence, make up a code sequence. However, for example, if M number<br>
of code sequences having length N is required (M &gt; N), then M number of code sequences<br>
having length M are generated, followed by removing a specified number of elements to<br>
make the length of the code sequence equal length N.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a method of generating CAZAC sequence using a length required<br>
by a communication system. That is, the required (or desired) length of the CAZAC<br>
sequence can be represented by length L. Further, the codes types can be extended.<br>
However, since a generated code sequence can be truncated or have elements discarded to<br>
correspond to the desired length L, the auto-correlation and cross-correlation properties of<br><br>
the truncated code sequence can experience deterioration. Similarly, even if a code<br>
sequence portion is added/attached to the generated code sequence (e.g., zero-padding or<br>
cyclic prefix) to correspond to the desired length L, the auto-con-elation and cross-<br>
correlation properties can experience deterioration. Here, auto-correlation properties relate<br>
to the auto-correlation value being 1 when the delay is 0. Otherwise, the auto-correlation<br>
value is 0 when the delay is a value other than 0. Further, the cross-correlation properties<br>
having a constant value is negatively affected.<br>
Assuming that the code sequence having poor auto-correlation and cross-correlation<br>
properties are removed, the remaining number of code sequences may be less than L -1.<br>
In order to attain a desired length and a maximum number of CAZAC sequence<br>
types corresponding to the desired length, a smallest prime number, X, greater than the<br>
desired length, L, (X&gt; L) can be selected. Although the CAZAC sequence can be generated<br>
using X. due to deterioration of the correlation properties, the correlations properties of<br>
CAZAC sequence as shown in Equations 4 and 5 cannot be attained. Further, when<br>
selecting a length of the generated code sequence, the length that is nearest to the desired<br>
length L which is between a smallest prime number larger than the desired length or a<br>
largest prime number smaller than the desired length can be selected.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, the generated CAZAC sequence has length X. Thereafter, the<br>
generated CAZAC sequence having length X has elements of the code sequence removed<br>
(or truncated) so as to make the length of the generated CAZAC sequence correspond to the<br>
desired length L.<br><br>
Figure 9 illustrates a method of generating a CAZAC sequence using a padding<br>
portion. As discussed, the generated CAZAC sequence is truncated. With respect to auto-<br>
correlation and cross correlation properties, delay of 0 indicates an auto-correlation value of<br>
1, as shown in Equation 4, and a delay not equaling 0 indicates a value of 0. Moreover, the<br>
properties where the cross-correlation value is always a prime number is not deteriorated<br>
whereby effective correlation is maintained. Further, additional control information can be<br>
transmitted by using the information inputted to the fading unit.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, the generated CAZAC sequence has length X. Here, the value<br>
of Z is a largest prime number less than the value of L. In other words, X is a prime number<br>
less than L. Thereafter, the generated CAZAC sequence having length X has elements added<br>
or a padding portion added to the CAZAC sequence so as to make the length of the<br>
generated CAZAC sequence correspond go the desired length L. Here, C1 represents the<br>
length of the CAZAC sequence having length X, and C2 represents the padding portion. By<br>
combining Cl and C2 (Cl + C2), the generated CAZAC sequence can have a length<br>
corresponding to the desired iength L,.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates an exemplary application of circular shift. The circular shift is<br>
typically applied to increase amount of control information transmitted to the<br>
communication system. That is, for example, a back portion of the sequence is re-allocated<br>
to a front portion of the sequence, and accordingly, the remaining sequence is shifted in the<br>
direction of the back portion of the sequence in amount (or length) corresponding to the re-<br>
allocated back portion, as illustrated in Figure 2. Further, if specified control information is<br><br>
applied the circular shift as described above, then the control information amount that can<br>
be transmitted via corresponding sequence increases.<br>
Discussions of above relate to the methods of generating the sequence using the<br>
desired length L, and of increasing transmitted control information using the circular shift.<br>
If these methods are applied in generating the sequence, the following processes take place.<br>
First, select a smallest prime number greater than I or a largest prime number less than L,<br>
which is referred to as X. Second, remove or add a sequence unit having a length<br>
corresponding to X-L or L-X. Third, apply the circular shift to the resulting sequence.<br>
Figure 11 is an exemplary diagram illustrating application of circular shift to the<br>
generated code sequence after the elements of the code sequence are removed. Referring to<br>
Figure 11, the code sequence 1102 is generated based on length X which is the smallest<br>
prime number greater than length L. In other words, the generated code sequence 1102 has a<br>
length equaling length X which is longer than the desired length L. From the generated code<br>
sequence 1102, a portion having a length corresponding to length X - L is removed,<br>
resulting in a code sequence having length L 1103. Thereafter, the result of the generated<br>
code sequence 1103 having length L is applied circular shift thereto, resulting in the code<br>
sequence 1104.<br>
Figure 12 is an exemplary diagram illustrating application of circular shift to the<br>
generated code sequence prior to removing the elements of the code sequence. In other<br>
words, circular shift is performed to the generated CAZAC sequence having length X, and<br>
after circular shift is performed, the elements of the code sequence are removed.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 12, the code sequence 1202 is generated based on length X<br>
which is the smallest prime number greater than length L. In other words, the generated<br>
code sequence 1202 has a length equaling length X which is longer than the desired length L.<br>
A circular shift is then performed to the generated code sequence 1203 having length X.<br>
Thereafter, a portion of the generated code sequence having a length corresponding to<br>
length X-L is removed, resulting in a code sequence 1204 having length L.<br>
Figure 13 is an exemplary diagram illustrating application of circular shift to the<br>
generated code sequence after a padding portion is attached. Referring to Figure 13, the<br>
code sequence 1302 is generated based on length X which is the largest prime number<br>
smaller than the value of length L. To the generated CAZAC sequence 1302, a padding<br>
portion is added 1303. The length of the padding portion corresponds to a length L-X.As<br>
discussed, the padding portion can be comprised of zeroes or cyclic prefix/postfix. With the<br>
addition of the padding portion, the length of the CAZAC sequence equals the desired<br>
length L. Thereafter, the result of the generated code sequence having length L 1303 is<br>
applied circular shift thereto, resulting in the CAZAC sequence 1304.<br>
Figure 14 is an exemplary diagram illustrating application of circular shift to the<br>
generated code sequence prior to attaching a padding portion. In other words, circular shift<br>
is performed to the generated CAZAC sequence having length X, and after circular shift is<br>
performed, the padding portion is attached.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, the code sequence 1402 is generated based on length X<br>
which is the largest prime number smaller than the value of the desired length L. To the<br><br>
generated CAZAC sequence 1402, circular shift is performed. The circularly-shifted<br>
CAZAC sequence 1403 still has length X. To the CAZAC sequence 1403, a padding portion<br>
is added, resulting in the CAZAC sequence 1404. The length of the padding portion<br>
corresponds to a length i-XAs discussed, the padding portion can be comprised of zeroes<br>
or cyclic prefix/postfix. With the addition of the padding portion, the length of the CAZAC<br>
sequence 1404 equals the desired length!.<br>
Between Figures 11 and 12, the difference is that circular shift is performed either<br>
before or after the elements of the CAZAC sequence are removed. By performing circular<br>
shift before removing the elements (or adjusting the length to equal the desired length),<br>
correlation deterioration can be reduced. To put differently, the CAZAC sequence does not<br>
have discontinuous codes.<br>
Between Figures 13 and 14, the difference is that circular shift is performed either<br>
before or after the padding portion is added to the generated CAZAC sequence. By<br>
attaching the padding portion after performing circular shift, better correlation properties<br>
can be attained, especially since the padding portion is placed at the end of the code<br>
sequence.<br>
Further, according to the discussion above, the desired length L (or required length)<br>
is first recognized. As illustrated with respect to Figures 11 - 14, the generated code<br>
sequence is adjusted/modified based on the desired length L. Based on that, after the desired<br>
length L recognized, a determination can be made as to whether the generated length X<br>
should be shortened or extended. In other words, the determination can be made whether to<br><br>
remove or discard at least one element of the generated code sequence or to add or insert at<br>
least one element to the generated code sequence. As discussed, the elements to be inserted<br>
can be a null (0) element (e.g., zero padding) or cyclic prefix/postfix, for example. In order<br>
to make the determination between discarding the element(s) or adding the element(s), the<br>
system can choose to select the length closest to the desired length L.<br>
For example, if the desired length L is 75, the value of the smallest prime number<br>
greater than 75 is 79, and the value of the largest prime number smaller than the 75 is 73.<br>
Here, the prime number 73 can be selected since 73 is closer to 75 than 79 is to 75.<br>
Although the illustration above selects the prime number closest to the desired<br>
length L, selection regarding removal or addition of the element(s) is not limited to the<br>
example of above and other implementations may be applied.<br>
Regarding padding, there are five (5) schemes by which padding can be<br>
accomplished. As a first padding scheme, the padding portion can be comprised of a<br>
constant number (e.g., 0s). Although the padding portion is used to fill the portion of the<br>
code sequence so that the length of the code sequence coincides with the desired length, it is<br>
possible for the padding portion to be less then completely full. In other words, it is possible<br>
for that the length of the code sequence with padded portion is not equal to or is shorter than<br>
the code sequence with the desired length. That is, when the code sequence is used for<br>
functions deemed less important, such as for cell search or random access, it is not<br>
necessary to use the entire length of the code sequence, and as such, the padding portion<br><br>
does not need to be completely occupied to correspond to the desired length of the code<br>
sequence.<br>
As a second padding scheme, the padding portion can be comprised of a repeated<br>
portion. In other words, the portion corresponding to L -X of the code sequence 1204 can<br>
be duplicated and inserted/attached to the end of the code sequence 1204. This can be<br>
referred to as cyclic postfix. Here, the code sequence uses the entire length L. When<br>
determining the identification (ID) of the code sequence, the entire length L is used to<br>
facilitate identifying of the code sequence ID. At the same time, the generated code<br>
sequence does not experience distortion by using the entire length L. In the discussion<br>
above, the cyclic postfix is used. Alternatively, cyclic prefix can also be used.<br>
As a third padding scheme, the padding portion can be comprised of additional<br>
information through which different messages can be delivered. More specifically, the<br>
desired length L of the code sequence can be used to generate a supplemental code sequence<br>
whose length equals the desired length L (N-L), The code sequence portion corresponding<br>
to L — X is extracted from the supplemental code sequence and inserted/attached to the<br>
generated code sequence as the padded portion.<br>
As a fourth padding scheme, a portion corresponding to length L - X is extracted<br>
from the code sequence and inserted as the padding portion. Here, the code sequence<br>
inserted to the padding portion may be a different code sequence than the code sequence<br>
1204. Put differently, the code sequence inserted to the padding portion may be a CAZAC<br>
sequence having a length of M, for example, which is different from the code sequence<br><br>
1204 having a length of I. Further, the code sequence inserted to the padding portion can be<br>
a different code sequence other than the CAZAC sequence. By using different code<br>
sequence, additional information can be delivered including information related to type of<br>
code sequence adjustments.<br>
As a fifth padding scheme, the padding portion can be used as lower bandwidth<br>
guard interval. During transmission of control information using a prescribed sequence, the<br>
following possible scenarios can occur such as transmitting data without establishing<br>
synchronization with an access channel, transmitting data by a plurality of users within a<br>
communication system, and distortion of frequency of the received data.<br>
Furthermore, the padding portions can be placed at both ends of the code sequence<br>
to use the padding portions as guard intervals of the lower bandwidth. Consequently, a more<br>
reliable acquisition of control information from the received data can take place despite<br>
distorted frequency signals. In the padding portions used as guard intervals, constant<br>
numbers (e.g., 0s) can be used or cyclic prefix or postfix of the generated code sequence can<br>
be used.<br>
If the padding portions are placed at both ends of the code sequence and used as<br>
guard intervals of the lower bandwidth, the code sequences can be protected from frequency<br>
signal distortions. Moreover, if 0s are inserted between the guard intervals or put differently,<br>
within the code sequence, interference to neighboring codes can be reduced. Alternatively,<br>
if cyclic prefix/postfix is used as guard intervals, the code sequences can be protected from<br><br>
frequency distortions and can be used to transmit the control information containing the<br>
sequence ID if there is no frequency distortion.<br>
Figure 15 is an exemplary diagram of a padding portion of the code sequence in<br>
which the padding portion is used as a lower bandwidth guard interval. Referring to Figure<br>
15, the code sequence 1501 can be divided into three (3) parts - a portion (C1), which is<br>
generated based on length X, and the other two portions (C2 and C3) are attached to both<br>
ends of the code sequence 1501.<br>
In the discussions above, five (5) padding schemes are introduced. However, the<br>
padding schemes are not limited to the discussed schemes, and there can be other types of<br>
padding schemes.<br>
Besides the first padding scheme in which no information is inserted, the other four<br>
padding schemes insert additional information in the padding portions to allow expansion of<br>
the code sequence and/or transmission of message(s). Various information can be inserted<br>
into the padding portion including, for example, initial access information, timing update<br>
information, resource request information, user ID information, channel quality information<br>
(CQI), user group ID information related to a random access channel (RACH). Furthermore,<br>
the information can include cell ID information, multi-input multi-output (MIMO)<br>
information, and synchronization channel information of a synchronization channel (SCH),<br>
for example. In addition, the padding portion can be used for transmitting data for message<br>
transmission as well as arbitrary information using a code sequence having a length of L —X.<br><br>
Figure 16 is a structural diagram for transmitting the code sequence. Depending on<br>
whether the transmission of the code sequence is made in a downlink direction or an uplink<br>
direction, the structure can be in different form. With that, Figure 16 is described with<br>
respect to a general transmitting end for transmitting the control signal.<br>
Referring to Figure 16, the transmitting end 1601 comprises a sequence selection<br>
unit 1602 and a transmitting unit 1603. The sequence selection unit 1602 is used to generate<br>
the code sequence for transmitting the control information. More specifically, the sequence<br>
selection unit 1602 performs an operation to select a code sequence having a desired length<br>
of L. In other words, the sequence selection unit 1602 stores the value of the desired length<br>
L, and then selects an appropriate code sequence for expressing the control information to<br>
be transmitted where the code sequence has a length of L.<br>
The code sequence that can be selected by the sequence selection unit 1602 has a<br>
length of L as illustrated in Figures 12 and 14 (e.g., code sequence 1204 and code sequence<br>
1404). Moreover, the code sequence is applied circular shift (e.g., code sequences 1203 and<br>
1403) to which a padded portion corresponding to lengths L - X or X - L is removed or<br>
inserted/added. As a result, discontinuous parts are not formed within or in the code<br>
sequence to promote superior correlation characteristics.<br>
Although it is preferable to use length X which is a smallest prime number greater<br>
than the length of L or a largest prime number smaller than the length of L, as long as the<br>
value of length X is a prime number, different or other prime numbers can be used as the<br>
value of length X<br><br>
Figure 17 is a structural diagram illustrating a basic code sequence generation unit<br>
and a code sequence length adjustment unit. In Figure 17, the basic code sequence<br>
generation unit 1701 further comprises a code sequence generation unit 1701a and a circular<br>
shift application unit 1701b. The code sequence generation unit 1701a is used to generate a<br>
first code sequence (Cl). Here, C1 can be defined as a code sequence having a length of X<br>
where the value of length X is a smaller prime number larger than the value of length L or a<br>
code sequence having a length of X where the value of length X is a larger prime number<br>
smaller than the value of length L. Cl is then applied circular shift by the circular shift<br>
application unit 1701b. More specifically, the circular shift application unit 1701b receives<br>
Cl having length of X, applies circular shift, and outputs a second code sequence (C2) to the<br>
code sequence length adjustment unit 1702.<br>
The code sequence length adjustment unit 1702 further comprises a control unit<br>
1702a. a code sequence removing unit 1702b, and a padding unit 1702c. More specifically,<br>
the control unit 1702a receives C2 as well as the value of length L. The control unit 1702a<br>
determines whether to remove a portion/section of C2 or insert/add a portion/section to C2.<br>
Based on the determination from the control unit 1702a, C2 is delivered to the sequence<br>
removing unit 1702b in which a portion/section of C2 corresponding to a length of X- L is<br>
removed. Alternatively, C2 can be delivered to the padding unit 1702c for inserting/adding<br>
a portion/section of C2 whose length corresponds to the length of L —X.<br>
If C2 and the value of length L are provided to the control unit 1702a, the control<br>
unit 1702a compares the value of length X which identifies the length of C2 with the value<br><br>
of the length L. Here, if x is greater than L, then C2 is inputted into the sequence removing<br>
unit 1702b. From C2, the portion length of C2 corresponding to length X- L is removed,<br>
resulting in C3. However, if X is less than L, then C2 is inputted into the padding unit 1702c.<br>
From C2, the padding portion length corresponding to length L-Xis inserted/added to C2,<br>
resulting in C4. Here, the padding portion can be inserted to either end or both ends of C2.<br>
Figures 18 and 19 illustrate cross-correlation characteristics of the code sequence.<br>
The illustrations of Figures 18 and 19 is based on the value of length X being the smallest<br>
prime number greater than the value of the desired length L: however, the illustrations are<br>
not limited to the smallest prime number greater than length L but can have a prime number<br>
value of length X smaller than the value of length L.<br>
Referring to Figures 18 and 19, the x-axis represents values of circular shift while<br>
the y-axis represents un-normalized cross-correlation values. Furthermore, a thinner line<br>
represents the value of cross-correlation of the code sequence with circular shift applied<br>
thereto after a code sequence portion having the length X- L is removed. A darker/thicker<br>
line represents values of code sequence to which circular shift is applied prior to removing<br>
the code sequence portion corresponding to the length X - L. More specifically, Figure 7<br>
illustrates a graph where L is 75 and X is 79 which is the smallest prime number greater than<br>
75. Moreover, Figure 8 illustrates a graph where L 8 is 225 and X is 227 which is the<br>
smallest prime number greater than 225.<br>
In Figures 18 and 19, if the value of circular shift is 0 or put differently, if there is no<br>
shift, then high correlation value is indicated only when the auto-correlation value of the<br><br>
code sequence corresponds and in other cases, moderate correlation is maintained. On the<br>
contrary, if the code sequence has a section corresponding to length X- L is removed and<br>
thereafter applied circular shift, severe fluctuations occur with correlation values, resulting<br>
in deteriorated correlation characteristics. As such, if cross-correlation is used to analyze the<br>
code sequence, the code sequence according to the embodiments of the present invention<br>
shows superior performance and outcome to that of the conventional code sequence.<br>
Figure 20 is an exemplary diagram illustrating boosting the power of the generated<br>
code sequence. As discussed, the code sequence is generated based on length X, and a<br>
padding portion, whose length corresponds to length L —X, is attached to the code sequence<br>
(e.g., CAZAC sequence). Thereafter, the portion of the code sequence corresponding to<br>
length^ is used where lengths is divided by length X{LIX). The result of the division is the<br>
amount of power that can be boosted. Moreover, the amount of power that can be boosted<br>
can be applied to the code sequence whose length is length X. When the receiving end<br>
receives power boosted code sequence, more effective detection performance can be<br>
achieved since interference is reduced.<br>
However, regarding a code sequence generated with a padding portion with cyclic<br>
prefix/postfix attached thereto, there is no need to power boost since all of the code<br>
sequences corresponding to length L are used for acquiring sequence ID information.<br>
In the receiving end, information related to the generated code sequence and length<br>
X used to generate the code sequence is received. From the code sequence, a portion<br>
corresponding to length X is processed to acquire the control information. To this end, it is<br><br>
important to first receive synchronization information of the received data. Equation 7 and<br>
Equation 8 can be used to acquire synchronization information. Here, Equation 7 relates to<br>
auto-correlation, and Equation 8 relates to cross-correlation.<br><br>
Equation 7 is used to acquire auto-correlation value(s) from the received code<br>
sequence whose sequence ID is M. Further, the acquired auto-correlation value d, which is a<br>
value other than 0, is used to achieve synchronization.<br>
Equation 8 is used to acquire cross-correlation value(s) of a code sequence whose ID<br>
is M2 from the received code sequence whose sequence ID is M\. Through the acquired<br>
value, synchronization can be achieved.<br>
Typically, if the wireless communication system is a synchronous network, auto-<br>
correlation is used to acquire synchronization information, and if the system is an<br>
asynchronous network, cross-correlation is used to acquire synchronization information.<br>
However, according to the embodiments of the present invention, synchronization<br>
information can be acquired using any one or at least one of the correlation schemes.<br>
After the synchronization information of the received code sequence is acquired, the<br>
receiving end analyzes the received code sequence to acquire the sequence ID, as shown in<br>
Equations 9 and 10.<br><br><br>
In Equations 9 and 10, oc(k:M,X) denotes difference sequence of the received<br>
sequences. Equation 9 is used to acquire the ID information of the received sequence using<br>
the differential sequence corresponding to the total length of the received sequence.<br>
Equation 9 can also be used to acquire the ID information of the code sequence which has<br>
been generated with the cyclic prefix/postfix padded portion. Equation 10 is used to acquire<br>
the ID information of the received sequence using the smallest prime number corresponding<br>
to length x<br>
As discussed, if the differential sequence of the CAZAC sequence is calculated<br>
using Equations 9 or 10, A: of the sequence index is generated, and the result therefrom is<br>
transformed by the Fourier transform scheme, to show a single peak value. Thereafter, by<br>
detecting the peak value, the ID information of the sequence can be acquired.<br>
The discussion of above regarding a code sequence or a code sequence set can be<br>
applied to 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) system or 3GPP2 system as well as a<br>
Wibro system or a Wimax system.-<br>

can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
