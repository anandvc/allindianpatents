				<td>POWER NETWORK FOR COLLECTING DISTRIBUTED POWERS Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an AC power network for collecting the electric powers of amount of distributed AC power cells. Background of the Invention<br>
A lot of power sources are distributed in our environment, such as sun light, surf, wind. It is an inportant problem how to collect these energy. Power networks are thus used to resolve this problem.<br>
In a series DC power network of the prior art, when more and more DC power cells are connected to the network, the currents in the network approach to constant values and the power collected by the target load through the network thus approaches to a constant. In the same time, the output powers of the DC power cells in the series DC power network of the prior art approach to zeros. The same problem occurs in a parallel DC power network of the prior art. Series arid parallel DC power networks of the prior arts are not suitable<br>
for collecting the powers of distributed DC power cells.<br>
A series-parallel DC power network of the prior art: <br>
not induce the above problem when more and more DC power cells are connected to the network, however, it will generate a non-uniform power distribution among the DC power cells thereof. The non-uniform power distribution causes some DC<br>
power cells being inversely charged. In order -co prevent. the damage of inversely charging DC power cells, diodes are series or parallel connected to DC power cells. Although the above problems are resolved by using the series-parallel DC power network with diodes, the power efficiency of the network is low when the electric powers of large amount of DC power cells are collected.<br>
Summary  of   the   Invention<br>
The objective of the invention is to provide an AC power network for collecting the electric powers of distributed power cells.<br>
With the problem of the prior art in mind, an AC power network of the invention includes a plurality of AC power cells, a plurality of transmission lines, and at least one resistant load. The AC power network of the invention has important properties, such as simple structure and easy setup and maintenance. In addition, when there is non-unif orm distribution among AC power cells or some AC power cells are broken down, the AC power network possesses equal potential rings or equal potential planes to eliminating non-uniform distribution without decreasing its power efficiency.<br>
The present invention provides an AC power network for collecting the electric powers of amount of distributed AC power cells, comprising:<br>
a plurality of AC current source with the same frequency, being arranged in order, the phase difference of every successive AC current sources's phasors<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
First Embodiment: an AC power network with linear structure. Please refer to FIG. 1, which is the first preferred embodiment of an AC power network of the invention. The AC power network of the embodiment includes a plurality of AC current sources with the same frequency, a plurality of quarter-wavelength transmission lines with the same characteristic impedance, a resistant load, and a resistant target load. It is noted that a AC current source can be characterized by a AC current phasor I with a magnitude A<br>
and a phase 6 denoted as 1 - A .e where A&gt;0 is a real number<br>
and j represents l .  Each pair of quarter-wavelength<br>
transmission lines has the same characteristic impedance<br>
Z0 and induces 90° phase delay between both AC phasors<br>
respectively connected to its both ends. The AC current<br>
sources are linearly connected by the quarter-wavelength<br>
transmission lines. Inside the dashed-line rectangular of<br>
FIG. 1, the two AC current phasors with the same magnitude<br>
and 90 degree phase difference are called a pair of AC current<br>
sources. The magnitude of the kth pair of AC current source<br>
is denoted as A*. The power network shown in FIG. 1 consists<br>
of n pairs of AC current sources linearly connected with<br>
quarter-wavelength transmission lines, a resistant load RL1.,<br>
and a resistant target load RL2. Hence, the phasor of the<br>
kth AC current source can be written as<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
with A0=An+1=0. According to the theories of transmission lines and superposition, the AC voltage phasor Vk and AC current phasor Ir,k of the kth port of the power network in FIG. 1 can be represented as<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
In addition, the output power Ps,k and the collected power Pr,k of the Jrth AC current source and the Jrth port are described as<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where the * denotes the complex conjugate operation. It is obvious that the output power efficiency of every AC current source is 1, the collected power at the resistant target load RL2 is maximum, and the collected power at the resistant load RL1 is zero.<br>
Second Embodiment : an AC power network with tree structure.<br>
According to the equation (5) of the first preferred<br>
embodiment, the AC current source near the resistant target<br>
load RLZ much more is needed to offer higher output power.<br>
The AC current source near the resistant target load RL2 can<br>
be replaced by another linear AC power network of the above<br>
embodiment. Hence, the second preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention shows an AC power network with a tree structure.<br>
The second preferred embodiment of an AC power network<br>
of the invention includes a plurality of AC power cells with<br>
the same frequency and phasor connected by a plurality of<br>
quarter-wavelength transmission lines with the same<br>
characteristic impedance, and a resistant target load. In<br>
the case, the power cells are current sources. Each pair<br>
of quarter-wavelength transmission lines has the same<br>
characteristic impedance Z0 and induces 90 degree phase delay<br>
between the two AC current sources connected to its both<br>
ends. The AC power network constructs a tree structure with<br>
a root and a plurality of branches and nodes. The resistant<br>
target load is the root, a pair of quarter-wavelength<br>
transmission lines forms a branch, and AC current sources<br>
are the ending nodes.  The ending nodes of the AC power<br>
network is the leaves of the tree structure, and they are<br>
apart from the root with the same number of branches. The<br>
nodes excluding the ending nodes denote the locations<br>
collecting branches.  The nodes with the same number of<br>
branches away from the root form a class.  The ending nodes<br>
forms the class one (Cl) .  The nodes in the same class collect<br><br>
the same number of branches, FIG. 2 shows an AC power network with four-class tree structure. A dashed contour denotes one class, and the leaves of the tree forms the class one (Cl) . The nodes with one branch away from the ending nodes forms the class two (C2) . Similarly, the classes three <c3 and four are formed. in fig. the resistant target load forms c4. nodes of c2 c3 c4 collect same number branches.></c3>
Let the phasor I of each AC current source be I - 1.e10 ,<br>
and the characteristic impedance of each pair of<br>
quarter-wavelength transmission lines is Z0=50Ω.  It is<br>
clear that the AC power network with tree structure of this<br>
embodiment can be seen as an assembly of AC power networks<br>
of the first embodiment. Hence, according to the result of<br>
the AC power network with linear structure shown in the first<br>
embodiment, the maximum collected power of the network<br>
locates at the resistant target load. FIG. 3,4, and 5 show<br>
the simulation results of the tree-structure AC power<br>
network with different values RL=25Ω (RL<z0 rl="50Ω"></z0>
and RL=100Ω  (RL&gt;Z0)  of the resistant target load,<br>
respectively. It is clearly obtained that the more higher<br>
power is collected at the port more near the resistant target<br>
load, and the maximum power is collected at the resistant<br>
target load.<br>
In FIG. 2 , the nodes excluding the ending nodes collect<br><br>
three branches. FIG. 6a shows another case of the embodiment, which the numbers of branches collected by the nodes of different classes are different. It is noted that the result of the case in FIG. 6a is same as the case in FIG. 2. FIG. 6b shows the real connection of the branches and nodes in the dashed-line contour PC shown in FIG. 6a. In the cases of FIG. 2 and 6a, the AC power cells are AC current sources. FIG. 7 a shows a further case of the embodiment, whose AC power cells are AC voltage sources, and the practical implement of the branches and nodes in the dashed-line contour PC of FIG. 7a are shown in FIG. 7b. Third Embodiement:  an AC power network with tree structure and global equal potential rings.<br>
Please refer to FIG. 8a, which shows a network with two AC current sources, two resistant loads, and three branches. Both branches respectively between the AC current source with phasor ISI and the resistant load R1. and between the AC current source with phasor IS2 and the resistant load R2 are two pairs of quarter-wavelength transmission lines with impedance 20, and the branch between both AC current sources is a pair of k-wavelength transmission lines with impedance Z0 and k=l. A pair of k-wavelength transmission lines with impedance will cause Kx360° phase delay between both AC phasors respectively connected to its both ends. According to the<br><br>
transmission-line theory, the AC voltage phasors V1,1 and V2,1 of both AC current sources IS1 and IS2 are equal, i.e. , V1, 1=V2, 1. In addition, it is obtained that I1,2=12.2- However, the AC current phasors I1.1 and I2,1 may not be equal, and so do the AC voltage phasors Vl,2 and V2,2. Since the AC voltage phasors at both ends of the pair of k-wavelength transmission lines as shown in FIG. 8a are equal, the pair of k-wavelength transmission lines is called an equal potential ring.<br>
Please refer to FIG. 8b, which shows a network with<br>
two AC current sources, two resistant loads, and four branches. Both branches respectively between the AC current source with phasor IS1 and the resistant load RI and between the AC current source with phasor In and the resistant load R2 are two pairs of quarter-wavelength transmission lines with Impedance Z0, and both branches respectively between both AC current sources In and Is2 and between both resistant load Rx and R2 is a pair of k-wavelength transmission lines with impedance Zc and k=l. According to the transmission-line theory, the AC voltage phasors V1.1 and V22,1 of both AC current sources Is1 and Is2 are equal, i.e., V1,1=V2,1, and so do the AC voltage phasors V1,2 and V2,2 of both resistant loads R1 and R2, i.e., V1,2=V2,2. Consequently, it is obtained that I1,1=J2,1 and I1,2=I2,2. It is noted that, with the equal potential rings, all AC voltage phasors between each equal potential ring are equal, and so do all AC current<br><br>
phasors between each equal potential ring.<br>
Please refer to PIG. 9, which is an AC power network with three-class tree structure, which includes nine AC current sources at class 1 (Cl) . The dashed contour at the class 1 (Cl) denotes the closed contour (rl) of equal potential rings, which connect all the AC current sources. There are three branches at each note of the AC power network. In addition, three of the nine AC current sources have larger AC current outputs than others'.   Hence, the power distribution of the AC network is heavily non-uniform. From the simulation results of the AC network shown in FIG. 9, because there are equal potential rings at class 1, the voltages of the nodes at class 1 are equivalent; however, they are different at class 2. Besides, in FIG. 10, the equal potential rings connect all the nodes at classes I, and so do at class 2. It is very clear that all the voltages and currents of the nodes at class 1 are equivalent, so do the nudes at class 2. This means that the power distribution of the AC network is equalized at each class by inserting equal potential rings. In addition, the collected power of the resistant target load is maximum.<br>
According to the above result, three cases of the third embodiment of the invention are shown in FIG. 11, 12 and 13, respectively. The first case as shown in FIG. 11 is an AC power network with five-class tree structure, AC current<br>
sources, and equal potential rings connecting all nodes of each class (Cl, C2, C3, and C4) . Every branch of the tree structure consists of a pair of quarter-wavelength transmission lines. The number of branches of the nodes at the class with equal potential rings are not needed to be equal. Since all power cells of the AC network are AC current sources, the first case of the third embodiment is called an current-type AC power network with tree structure and global equal potential rings. Please refer to FIG. 12, which is the second case of the third embodiment. The only difference of the first and second cases is that the AC current source of the first case are replaced with an AC voltage source and a pair of quarter-wavelength transmission lines. The second case is called an voltage-type AC power network with tree structure and global equal potential rings. In addition, in FIG. 13, the third case of the embodiment is shown. The power cells of the case consist of the AC current source, and the AC voltage source with a pair of quarter-wavelength transmission lines.  It is called an hybrid-type AC power network with tree structure and global equal potential rings. It is very important that the equal potential rings, linking all nodes of a class, are not necessary to form a closed contour, and it does not affect their function equalizing the power distribution of the class.<br>
Forth Embodiment an AC power network with tree structure and local equal potential rings.<br>
In the third embodiment, all classes without the<br>
resistant target load have equal potential rings, and the<br>
equal potential rings at each class form one contour. In<br>
the forth embodiment, there is at least one contour of equal<br>
potent rings at the same class.  In FIG. 14, the forth<br>
embodiment of the invention, an AC power network with<br>
four-class tree structure and local equal potential rings,<br>
is shown. The AC power network includes a plurality of AC<br>
power sources, a resistant target load, and a tree structure<br>
with branches and nodes. The branches are constructed by<br>
quarter-wavelength transmission lines. Nodes at each class<br>
are not needed to possess the same number of branches, for<br>
example: in the class 2, there are two branches at the node<br>
A, there are four branches at the node B, and there are two<br>
branches at the node C in the class 3. The ending nodes,<br>
i.e. the nodes in the class 1, are the AC current sources<br>
whose phasors may have different magnitudes. In the same<br>
class (say class J: } , these nodes connected to the same node<br>
in its preceding class (say class k+1) construct a group<br>
of nodes.  In the odd classes of this embodiment of the<br>
invention, such as class 1 and class 3 etc., every group<br>
of nodes has one local contour of equal potential rings<br>
connecting all its nodes.  For example, the AC current<br>
sources of this embodiment shown in FIG. *14 construct eight groups in class 1, and there is a contour of equal potential rings connecting the nodes of every group. In addition, in class 3, there is only one group of nodes, there is only one local contour of equal potential rings. In class 2, there is no equal potential ring.<br>
Every local contour of equal potential rings in class<br>
1 are used to equalize the output powers of the AC current<br>
sources in the same group of nodes, which the phasors of<br>
these AC current sources may have different magnitudes. The<br>
local contour of equal potential rings, in class 3, are used<br>
to make the power distribution of the AC power network<br>
uniformly.  In addition, the collected power of the<br>
resistant target load is maximum. This embodiment of the<br>
invention is called an AC power network with tree structure<br>
and local equal potential rings.<br>
Please refer to FIG. 15a and 15b, which are two embodiments of a quarter-wavelength transmission line with impedance Z0. The first one shown in FIG. 15a is the lump n-circuit which consists of an inductor with inductance Zo/ω and two capacitors with capacitance 1/(ω-Zo) where  is the AC power cells ' frequency. The both ends of the inductor are connected to one end of each capacitor, and the other ends of both capacitor are linked together. As shown in FIG. 15b, the other embodiment is the lump T-circuit, which<br>
consists of a capacitor with capacitance 1/ (ω-Zo) and two inductors with inductance Z0/ω. One end of the capacitor is connected to one end of each inductor. In addition, in FIG. 15c, the implement of a. pair of k-wavelength transmission lines, which consists of a capacitor with capacitance 1/(ω•Zo) and a inductor with inductance Z0/ω. The capacitor and inductor are serially connected. Fifth Embodiment- an AC power network with multi-plane structure and equal potential planes.<br>
According to the above results of different equal potential rings, two cases of the fifth embodiment of the invention are shown in FIG. 16a and 16b. In FIG. 16a, the first case includes at least one resistant target load, a plurality of AC power cells, a plural pairs of quarter-wavelength transmission lines, and a plurality of equal potential rings. The equal potential rings construct chess-like equal potential planes whose node's number is not less than the number of the AC power cells. One AC power cell is connected to one node of the fist chess-like equal potential plane. Both corresponding nodes of successive chess-like equal potential planes are connected by a pair of quarter-wavelength transmission lines. The resistant target load is connected to one node of the last chess-like equal potential plane. FIG. 16b shows another case of this embodiment, which has a plurality of the first<br>
chess-like equal potential planes. The corresponding nodes of the first chess-like equal potential planes and the successive chess-like equal potential plane are connected with pairs of quarter-wavelength transmission lines. Others are similar to the first case. It is clear that, in every chess-like equal potential plane, the power distribution is uniform, and the collected power of the resit ant target load is maximum.<br>
