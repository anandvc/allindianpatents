PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPOSITION   COMPRISING A  BENZODIAZEPINE   DERIVATIVE AND  AN  XNHIBIT  OR  OF  THE   RSV  FUSION  PROTEIN<br>
The present invention relates to a series of anti-viral benzodiazepine derivatives. In particular, it relates to a series of benzodiazepine derivatives which interact with an inhibitor of the RSV fusion protein to provide an additive or synergistic therapeutic effect in treating or preventing an RSV infection.<br>
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of Tespiratory illness in patients of all ages, in adults, it tends to cause mild cold symptoms. In school-aged children, it can cause a cold and bronchial cough. In infants and toddlers it can cause bronchiolitis (inflammation of the smaller airways of the lungs) or pneumonia. It has also been found to be a frequent cause of middle ear infections (otitis media) in pre-school children. RSV infection in the first year of life has been implicated in the development of asthma during childhood.<br>
Current anti-RSV therapy involves the use of a monoclonal antibody to RSV, called palivizum&amp;b. Such use of palivizumab is a prophylactic, rather than therapeutic, treatment of RSV. However, although this antibody is often effective, it is expensive. Indeed, its expense means that it is unavailable for many people in need of anti-RSV therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for effective alternatives to existing anti-RSV therapy.<br>
Small compounds which inhibit RSV replication by inhibiting the fusion (F) protein of RSV block the entry of the virus into the host cell and the exit from the host cell via syncytia formation. While these compounds have been shown to have high potency, RSV rapidly develops resistance to these compounds through mutations in the F protein (Morton, CJ. et al, 2003.Virology 311, 275-288).<br>
PCT/GB03/04050 filed on 20 September 2003 discloses a series of benzodiazepine derivatives which inhibit RSV replication. Serial passaging experiments have indicated that resistance to these inhibitors is slow to develop and sequencing of resistant mutants did not reveal any significant changes in the F protein. It can therefore be assumed that these benzodiazepines have a common and novel mode of action, which does not involve inhibition of the F-protein.<br>
It has now surprisingly been shown that a combination of (a) an RSV fusion protein inhibitor and (b) an anti-RSV benzodiazepine is highly active against RSV. Components (a)<br><br>
and (b) are found to have at least an additive effect. Further, it is also a finding of the invention that the two components interact synergistically, to provide a combined effect-that is greater than the sum of the effects of the individual components.<br>
The present invention therefore provides, in a first embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and<br>
(a)	an inhibitor of the RSV fusion protein; and;<br>
(b)	a benzodiazepine derivative capable of inhibiting RSV replication.<br>
It is a finding of the present invention that components (a) and (b) have at least an additive effect The concepts of synergism and additivity are, of course, well known in the field of pharmacology. It is thus well established that a therapeutically useful additive combination is one in which the effect of the combination is greater than the larger of the effects produced by each of the components at the same concentrations as in the mixture. Thus, in the present case, a given formulation containing x wt% of component (a) and y wt% of component (b) has an activity which is at least as great as the activity of a formulation containing, as sole active ingredient, either x wt% component (a) or y wt% component (b).<br>
In such additive combinations, the active ingredients are typically operating via different physiological pathways. In the present case, for example, component (a) and component (b) are believed to be inhibiting separate RSV proteins. An additive combination is therapeutically useful because it can achieve a therapeutically useful effect using lower concentrations of each active component. This enables the side-effects of the medication to be minimised. Thus, the additive combination can be formulated so that each active ingredient is present at a concentration which is subclinical in cells other than the target disease cells, The additive combination is nevertheless therapeutically effective in target cells which respond to both ingredients.<br>
As regards component (a), an inhibitor of the RSV fusion protein can be identified by an assay comprising:<br>
(a)	labelling RSV with octadecyl rhodamine dye (R18);<br>
(b)	pre-incubating the labelled virus with Hep-2 ceDs seeded in a 6-well plate at 1<br>
hour for 4°C;<br>
(c)	removing unattached virus;<br>
(d)	adding the candidate fusion protein inhibitor,<br><br>
(e)	incubating the 6-weU plates at 37°C for 1 hour, and<br>
(f)	determining any increase in fluorescence, typically using a fluorescence<br>
microscope.<br>
In the above assay, any increase in fluorescence signifies a fusion event. Thus, if no increase in fluorescence is detected, 100% inhibition is achieved. If the increase in fluorescence is equal to that observed with a corresponding assay in which a control of growth medium and solvent (e.g., growth medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and DMSO) is used in step (d) in place of the candidate fusion protein inhibitor, 0% inhibition is achieved. Accordingly the % inhibition achieved with the candidate fusion protein inhibitor can be determined by quantitative assessment of the fluorescence in step (f).<br>

The compounds of formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV) are known compounds. They are disclosed, for example, in WO 00/195910, WO 00/004900, WO 03/053344, US-A-4324794 and WO 01/00612, and can be prepared by the processes set out in those documents.<br>
WO 00/195910, WO 00/004900, WO 03/053344, US-A-4324794 and WO 01/00612 are incorporated herein by reference. Any of the compounds disclosed as fusion protein inhibitors in those documents can be used in the present invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) may be prepared by reacting glyoxylic acid (HCO-CO2HX benzotriazole and an appropriate benzyl carbamate at reflux in toluene, under Dean-Stark conditions giving the key protected amino acid of formula (it)<br>
  en')<br>
The thus obtained amino acid of formula (II;) can then be reacted with a suitable chlorinating agent, such as oxalyl chloride, followed by reaction with a 2-aminobenzophenone of formula (III7)<br><br><br>
to give the intermediate amide of formula (IV;)<br><br>
which need not be characterized.<br>
The compound of formula (IV7) can then be subjected to ammonolysis followed by ring closure in acetic acid containing ammonium acetate to obtain the protected benzodiazepine of formula (V')<br><br>
The compound of formula (V) can then be deprotected using hydrogen bromide in 0     acetic acid to yield the deprotected amine of formula (VI;).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (V), in which R5 is XR6 and X is -CO- can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (VI1), as defined above, with an acid anhydride in a suitable solvent, preferably pyridine at ambient temperature, or with an acid chloride in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base, preferably in THF at ambient temperature with trietfaylamine present. Alternatively, the compounds can be produced by reaction of a compound of formula (VIy) with an acid in a suitable solvent in the presence of a base and a coupling agent, preferably in THF at ambient temperature with triethylamine and O-benzotriazol-l-yl-N, N, N\ N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) present<br>
If the acid chloride used is an ainino carbonyi chloride, the compound of formula (V) is a tertiary urea. In the case where R is NH-R, such compounds may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (VI) with an isocyanate. This reaction is preferably carried out in THF at ambient temperature. Alternatively, the isocyanate may be prepared in situ from the relevant amine and phosgene, in the presence of a base, usually triethylamine, again in THF.<br>
Compounds of formula (V), in which R5 is -XR6 and X is -S(O)2- may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (VI) with a suitable sulfonyl chloride. Similarly, compounds of formula (V), in which R5 is XR6 and X is -S(O)- may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (VI;) with a suitable sulfinyl chloride<br>
Compounds of formula (V) in which R5 is not XR6 may be prepared by known methods. For example, a compound of formula (VI7) can be reacted with a compound of formula R5-L, wherein L is a leaving group such as a chlorine atom, a mesylate group or a triflate group. When R5 is aryl or heteroaryl, L can be -B(OH)2 and the reaction may take place in the presence of copper acetate. Such boronic acid coupling reactions will, of course, be familiar to those of skill in the art. Compounds wherein R5 is aryl or heteroaryl may also be prepared by way of a Buchwald reaction or by reaction of a compound of formula (VI1) with an appropriate fluoroaryl or fluoroheteroaryl compound. Compounds wherein R5 is a<br><br>
heteroaryl group may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (VI') with a suitable chloroheteroaryl or bromoheteroaryl compound. Compounds wherein R5 is a carbocyclyl group may also be prepared by known methods, for example a compound wherein R5 is cyclohexyl maybe prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (VI7) with cyclohexanone in the presence of a reducing agent.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) in which the R5 group is aryl-(Ci-6alkyl)-, heteroaryl-(Ci-6 alkyl)-, carbocyclyl-(Ci-6 alkyl)-, heterocyclyl-(Ci^ alkyl)- can also be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (VI7) with an aldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent. Preferably, such reactions between compounds of formula (VI7) and aldehydes are carried out in a mixture of dichloromethane and acetic acid in the presence of sodium (triacetoxy)borohydride at ambient temperature.<br>
In the preparation of the benzodiazepine skeleton, commercially available aminobenzophenone compounds of formula (in7) can be used where possible. Compounds of formula (in7) which are not commercially available can be prepared by known methods, for example by reaction of a Weinreb type amide of formula (VII7)<br><br>
with a group R'-Li or a Grignard reagent such as R!-MgBr. Preferably this reaction is cairied out in THF at -100°C.<br>
Compounds of formula (VII7) are known compounds or can be prepared by analogy with known methods. For example, they can be prepared from the reaction of isatoic anhydrides of formula (VIII7)<br><br><br>
with N,O-dimethy] hydroxylamine under standard reaction conditions.<br>
The starting materials of formula (if), (Hi'), (VH;), ^d (VIII7) are known compounds, or may be prepared by analogy with known methods.<br>
Further synthetic manipulation of the thus obtained compounds of formula (V) may be carried out by conventional methods to achieve further compounds of formula (V). The benzodiazepines of formula (V) can be salified by treatment with an appropriate acid or base.<br>
Although the described route to the claimed compounds provides an adequate synthesis for laboratory scale preparations, an alternative route was sought which has potential as a manufacturing route. The same starting material (2-amino-benzophenone) (1) is used in both, however in the alternative route, the benzodiazepine ring system is formed by reaction initially with bromoacetyl bromide (or an equivalent reagent) followed by ring closure with ammonia. These reactions are carried out in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, and at a suitable temperature which may range from -20 to 150°C. In order to protect the NH functionality, at this stage the unsubstituted benzodiazepine is reacted with a base, and an alkylating agent. For instance sodium hydride in DMF followed by addition of 4-methoxy-benzyl chloride gives rise to the intermediate (2) shown below.   Further reaction of this material with a base (e.g. potassium tert-butoxide) in a suitable solvent (e.g. THF or DMF) followed by quenching with isoamyl nitrite (or an alternative similar reagent) furnishes the oxime intermediate (3) which may be converted into the racemic primary amine by methods which include the use of hydrogen and a suitable catalyst. This amine then undergoes a Dynamic Kinetic Resolution (DKR) procedure by which the racemic amine in the presence of a suitable optically active acid, and a suitable aldehyde gives rise to precipitation of the salt of the desired (S)-amine (4) in good yield and exceptionally high enantiomeric excess. A suitable acid for this conversion can be e.g. Camphorsulfonic acid, Boc-phenyl alanine or the like, and a suitable aldehyde may be a ben2aldehyde such as 3,5-dichloro salicylaldehyde.<br>
The optically amine thus formed may then be transformed into a desired derivative, such as an amide or urea. The amide formations may be carried out using a suitable carboxylic acid and a coupling reagent, or a carbonyl chloride or other suitable reagent, and the ureas prepared using aeither a suitable isocyanate, or alternatively reaction with phosgene followed by a suitable amine.<br><br>
These derivatives thus formed may then have the protecting group removed. This may be carried out in the presence of a Lewis Acid, such as aluminium chloride, boron trifluoride, titanium tetrachloride, or the like. These reactions are carried out in a suitable inert solvent, such as dichloromethane. Reaction temperatures may range from -20 to 150°C, but are typically carried out at room temperature or below.<br><br>

The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, for use in the treatment of the human or animal body. Also provided is the use of (a) a said RSV fusion protein inhibitor and (b) a said benzodiazepine derivative, in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating or preventing an RS V infection.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating or preventing an RSV infection in a patient, which method comprises the administration to said patient of (a) a said RSV fusion protein inhibitor and (b) a said benzodiazepine derivative.<br>
Typically, the amount of component (a) in the composition of the invention is from 0.025 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.25 wt% to 5 wt%, more preferably from 1 wt% to 3.5 wt%, for example about 2.5 wt%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Typically, the amount of component (b) in the composition of the invention is from 0.025 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.25 wt% to 5 wt% more preferably from 1 wt% to 3.5 wt%, for example about 2.5 wt%, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>

RSV is prevalent among children younger than two years of age, adults suffering from asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) or immunodeficiency and the elderly. It is a particularly serious risk amongst children who suffer from chronic lung disease. Accordingly, the said composition or medicament is typically for use in treating a patient who is a child under two years of age, patients with asthma, COPD or immunodeficiency the elderly or persons in long term care facilities. Typically, said child suffers from chronic lung disease.<br>
Further, anti-RSV prophylaxis is recommended for infants bom at 32 weeks of gestation or earlier, until they reach 6 months of age, the elderly, persons with immunedeficiency and those in long term care facilities. Accordingly, the said composition or medicament is typically for use in preventing RSV infection in an infant less than 6 years of age, who was born after 32 weeks of gestation or less, the elderly, persons with immunosufficiency and those in long term care facilities.<br>
As described above, RSV strains upon exposure to fusion inhibitors known in the art rapidly develop resistance. In order to minimize the risk of development of resistance to<br><br>
fusion inhibitors it is desirable to combine them with another inhibitor of RSV replication with a different mode of action. To our knowledge, the benzodiazepine derivatives disclosed above are the first class of compounds with a novel mode of action. Accordingly, the compositions of the invention are characterized by a very low resistance profile, which makes them particularly suitable for therapeutic and prophylactic applications.<br>
The present invention also covers situations where components (a) and (b) are administered separately. Thus, for example, component (a) can be administered up to 24 hours before component (b). Alternatively, component (b) can be administered up to 24 hours before component (a). More usually, when components (a) and (b) are administered separately, they are administered within 12 hours, preferably within 6 hours, of each other.<br>
The present invention therefore also provides a product comprising (a) a said RSV fusion protein inhibitor and (b) a said benzodiazepine derivative for separate, simultaneous or sequential use in the treatment of the human or animal body. Typically, said product is for separate, simultaneous or sequential use in treating or preventing an RSV infection.<br>
Also provided is the use of a said RSV fusion protein inhibitor in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating or preventing an RSV infection by co-administration with a said benzodiazepine derivative. The present invention also provides the use of a said benzodiazepine derivative in the manufacture of a medicament for use in treating or preventing an RSV infection, by co-administration with a said RSV fusion protein inhibitor.<br>
When components (a) and (b) are administered separately, they are typically formulated as described above. The amount of active ingredient in each separate formulation will, of course, correspond to the amount of component (a) or (b) given above for the combined formulation. Thus, when components (a) and (b) are administered separately, a first formulation is typically provided which contains from 0.025 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.25 wt% to 5 wt%, more preferably from 1 wt% to 3.5 wt%, for example about 2.5 wt%, of a said RSV fusion protein inhibitor, based on the total weight of the formulation. Similarly, a second formulation is typically provided which contains from 0.025 wt% to 10 wt%, preferably from 0.25 wt% to 5 wt%, more preferably from 1 wt% to 3.5 wt%, for example around 2.5 wt%, of a said benzodiazepine derivative, based on the total weight of the formulation. The two formulations can be administered separately in any order.<br><br>
Preferably, the compositions and medicaments of the invention have an activity greater than the combined individual activities of compounds (a) and (b). Thus, components (a) and (b) typically interact synergistically. Preferably, therefore, in the formulations and the medicaments of the invention, component (a) and component (b) are each present in an amount producing a synergistic therapeutic effect in treating or preventing an RSV infection.<br>
The anti-RSV compositions of the invention may be administered in a variety of dosage forms. Thus, they can be administered orally, for example as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules. The compounds of the invention may also be administered parenterally, whether subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, intrasternally, transdermally or by infusion techniques. The compounds may also be administered as suppositories.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, administration is by intravenous, intranasal or intrabronchial means. In particular, formulations for treating or preventing RSV can advantageously be administered intranasally. TTie present invention therefore also provides an inhaler or nebuliser containing a medicament which comprises (i) a composition of the invention comprising component (a) and component (b), as defined above, and (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The anti-RSV compositions of the invention are typically formulated for administration with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. For example, solid oral forms may contain, together with the active compound(s), diluents, e.g. lactose, dextrose, saccharose, cellulose, corn starch or potato starch; lubricants, e.g. silica, talc, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycols; binding agents; e.g. starches, arabic gums, gelatin, roethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl pyrrolidone; disaggregating agents, e.g. starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; effervescing mixtures; dyestuffs; sweeteners; wetting agents, such as lecithin, polysorbates, laurylsulphates; and, in general, non toxic and pharmacologically inactive substances used in pharmaceutical formulations.

Liquid dispersions for oral administration may be syrups, emulsions and suspensions. The syrups may contain as carriers, for example, saccharose or saccharose with glycerine and/or mannitol and/or soibitol.<br>
Suspensions and emulsions may contain as carrier, for example a natural gum, agar, sodium alginate, pectin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, orpolyvinyl alcohol. The suspension or solutions for intramuscular injections may contain, together with the active compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g. sterile water, olive oil, ethyl oleate, glycols, e.g. propylene glycol, and if desired, a suitable amount of lidocaine hydrochloride.<br>
Solutions for injection or infusion may contain as carrier, for example, sterile water or preferably they may be in the form of sterile, aqueous, isotonic saline solutions.<br>
Preferably, the anti-RSV compositions of the invention are solubilised in a carrier containing (a) a pharmaceutically acceptable oil selected from esterification or polyether products of glycerides with vegetable oil fatty acids of chain length Cg-Cio and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant selected from oleate and laurate esters of a polyalcohol copolymerized with ethylene oxide.

The anti-RSV compositions of the invention also be suspended in PEG 400 for oral administration.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of an anti-RSV composition of the invention is administered to a patient. A typical dose is from about 0.001 to 50 mg, typically 0.5 to 30 mg, preferably 1 to 20 mg active ingredient per kg of body weight, according to the activity of the specific composition, the age, weight and conditions of the subject to be treated, the type and severity of the disease and the frequency and route of administration. Preferably, daily dosage levels are from 5 mg to 2 g active ingredient.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention. They do not however, limit the invention in any way. In this regard, it is important to understand that the particular assays used in the Examples section are designed only to provide an indication of antiviral activity. There are many assays available to determine the activity of given compounds against RSV, and a negative result in any one particular assay is therefore not determinative.<br><br>

Example 7<br>
Determination of RSV fusion inhibitor activity<br>
RSV enters the host cell via attachment to and fusion with the host cell membrane. The effect of an inhibitor on the specific virus-cell fusion event can be qualitatively determined by using a fluorescence de-quenching system.<br>
The design of this assay takes advantage of the fact that RSV binds to cells at 4°C and at 37°C but that fusion may only occur at concentrations above 18°C.<br>
RSV labelled with octadecyl rhodamine dye (R18) is pre-incubated with Hep-2 cells seeded in a 6-well plate for 1 hour at 4°C to allow binding to occur. Unattached virus is removed by washing the cell monolayer. The inhibitor is then added to the virus-cell complexes prior to transferring the plates to 37°C for 1 hour in order to induce fusion.<br><br>
Virus-cell fusion can be observed directly under a fluorescence microscope.   Fluorescence emission is quenched when 2 identical fluorophores are in close proximity. Upon fusion of the labelled virus with the cell membrane, the distance between fluorophores is increased due to dye spread and there is a decrease in quenching. This is observed as an increase in fluorescence intensity of R18. It therefore follows that inhibition of fusion would lead to a decrease in fluorescence of RI8 compared to untreated control. Where the fluorescent yield of R18 in the presence of inhibitor is comparable to the untreated control this would suggest the inhibitor were not exerting its effects on the fusion protein.<br>
Example 8<br>
Determination of RSV replication inhibitoT activity<br>
The inner 60 wells of 96 well tissue culture plates are seeded with Hep-2 cells at 4x104 cells/well for compound activity and toxicity studies in IOOJJ.1 of medium and incubated at 37°C overnight or until nearing confluency.<br>
Cells are infected with 25 \xl RSV, e.g. the RSS strain, previously titrated to give 80% cell kill. To each well 25\LM of test compound are added. The final DMSO concentration is 0.5%. Some 200 |j.l of sterile distilled water is added to the outer wells of the plate and incubated at 37°C for 6 days. Some 0.25 jd/ml PMS are added to stock XTT solution, final cone. 25 |iM PMS. Then 25 pi warmed XTT/PMS solution is added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.<br>
Maximum OD450nm reading (uninfected, untreated control cells) corresponds to 100% inhibition. Minimum OD4sonm readings (infected control cells) corresponds to 0% inhibition.

Svnergistic action between RSV fusion inhibitor and anti-RSV benzodiazepines 3LISA experiments were carried out on the combined effect of potent benzodiazepine RSV -eplication inhibitor (S)-l-(2-Fluoro-phenyI)-3-(2-oxo*5-phenyl-23-dihy^olH-:&gt;enzo[e][ls4]diazepin-3-yl)-urea (compound A) with one RSV fusion inhibitor selected from 1 -cyclopropyl-3-[ 1 -(4-hydroxy-butyl)-lH-benzoimida2ol-2-yhnethyl]« 1,3-dibydro imidazo[4,5-c3pyridin-2-one (compound B) or l-isopropenyi-3-(l-propyl-lH-benzoimidazol-2-yimethyl)-l,3-dihydro-imida2o[4,5-c]pyridine-2-one (compound B)<br>
ELISA PROTOCOL<br>
Mouse monoclonal antibodies to the phosphoprotein (P), nucleocapsid (N) &amp; fusion (F) proteins of RSV and a rabbit anti-mouse- horseradwash peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody were used to demonstrate a reduction in RSV antigen via conversion of the o-phenylene diamine dihydrochloride (OPD) substrate to a coloured product. This was quantified by optical density (OD) measurement.<br>
Method<br>
This assay was set up using all 96 wells of flat-bottomed 96-well plates. The outer wells were not subjected to any greater amount of evaporation than the inner wells during the 3 day assay period, (ie. No "edge effect" seen).<br>
Plates were set up one day before addition of virus and compounds. The assay then ran for 3 days with ELISA development taking place on the 4   day.<br>
Day 0<br>
Set up of Assay Plates<br>
All 96 wells of a microtitre plate were seeded at a density of 5x103 Hep-2 cells/well in<br>
lOOn-1/weil of Growth Medium (GM) consisting of Dulbecco's MEM (DMEM) with Glutamax-1, Sodium Pyruvate, 1000 mg^l glucose and pyridoxine (Invitrogen, catalogue number 21885-025) and supplemented with 10%FBS. (See Plate 1).<br>
In tissue culture, the cells adhere to the tissue culture flask and were grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 until 90% confluent.<br><br>
Monolayers were washed with 20ml sterile PBS to remove serum and treated with lml trypsin to detach cells from the flask.<br>
Cells were suspended in a small known volume of growth media and counted using a haemocytometer.   The cell suspension was made up to the desired concentration in growth medium and added to wells by multichannel pipette. Brief, gentle shaking encouraged the cells to disperse more evenly across the well.<br>
Plate 1<br><br>
Plates were kept undisturbed at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24hrs during which time the cells settle to form an even cell monolayer.<br>
Dayl<br>
Addition of Virus<br>
A frozen vial of RSV (RSS strain provided by Virogen Ltd) stock solution was removed<br>
from the -80 freezer or liquid nitrogen store and diluted to a known Multiplicity of Infection<br>
(m.oA) in Growth Medium.<br>
The m.o.i. was calculated by prior titration of the virus stock (by the ELISA assay method) as<br>
the virus input required to achieve a window of at least 0.8 OD units between infected and<br>
uninfected control wells.<br>
Multiplicity of Infection       =         plaque forming units per well (pfu/welO<br>
number of cells per well<br><br>
25^1 (SOpl in Exanple 9c) of diluted virus was added to infected wells by multichannel pipette; 25(il (50\il in Example 9c) of Growth Medium was added to uninfected, cell control wells by multichannel pipette.<br>
Sides of plates were marked with stripes to identify plates in the event of lids becoming<br>
separated.<br>
Plates were incubated at 37°C for lhr to allow virus adsorption.<br>
Compound Dilutions<br>
Compound "A" was titrated horizontally across the plate and Compound "B" was titrated vertically down the plate, creating a chequerboard. The 2 compounds were titrated at either Vz-log or doubling dilutions either across (horizontally) or down the plate (vertically) in the presence of virus. Each compound dilution was set up in duplicates or triplicates. For triplicates 3 identical plates were set up. Duplicates were set up as dublicate wells on the same plate. The dilution range covered concentrations from just above the compound IC50 to below the compound IC50 and included a OJJM control for each compound<br>
Compounds were made up in a separate microtitre plate at 8x strength in GM containing 2% DMSO (a final DMSO concentration in the assay of 0.5%). 12.5pM (25(J,1 in Example 9c) of the Compound "A" dilution series and 12.5|il (25^1 in Example 9c) of the Compound "B" dilution series were then transferred to the appropriate wells of the assay plate by multichannel pipette, according to the marked out chequerboard.<br>
12.5p.l (25^.1 in Example 9c) of GM (containing 2% DMSO) was added to wells receiving O^M Compound "A" or O^M Compound tcB". 25jal (50jil in Example 9c) GM (containing 2% DMSO) was added to wells containing neither compound.<br>
Virus infected, untreated wells served as the virus control (VC); Uninfected, untreated wells serve as the cell control (CC).   The difference in absorbance between CC and VC wells constitutes the assay window.<br>
Plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 days.<br><br>
ELISA Stage Day 4<br>
Media was tapped out from wells directly into Virkon (1% solution in water) and plates were<br>
washed by immersing in a plastic box containing PBS.<br>
50fil/well of 75%/25% vol/vol acetone/methanol fixative was added by multichannel pipette<br>
and left for 3mins.<br>
Aceton&amp;Zmethanol was discarded from wells into Virkon and wells were washed with PBS as<br>
above.<br>
Some 200pJ of blocking solution (2% Marvel in PBS containing 0.05% Tween) was added per well by multichannel pipette. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator for 60mins.<br>
Block solution was discarded down the sink and diluted primary antibody was added directly to wells (ie. no washing required).<br>
RSV mouse monoclonal antibody NCL-RSV3 (Novocastra) was diluted 1/400 in PBS/2% Marvel/0.05% Tween and 50fxl was added per well. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator for 90mins.<br>
Antibody was discarded down the sink and plates were washed 4 times by immersion in PBS/0.05% Tween.<br>
DAKo rabbit anti-mouse HRP conjugate (DAKO catalogue number P0260) was diluted 1/1000 in PBS/2% Marvel/0.05% Tween and 50[d was added per well. Plates were incubated at 37°C in a shaking incubator for 60mins.<br>
Antibody was discarded down the sink and plates were washed 6 times by immersion in PBS/0.05% Tween.<br><br>
Substrate (SigmaFast OPD) was prepared in advance by dissolving 1 urea tablet in 20mL water. 1 OPD tablet was added to the urea solution just prior to use (NB. OPD was light sensitive) and vortexed to mix. 50pl of substrate was added per well.<br>
The reaction was stopped by addition of 25n-l/well of 20% sulphuric acid, once sufficient colour had developed but while cell control background was still low (-5 minutes).<br>
Plates were read on a SpectraMax (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer at wavelength 490nm and utilize the SOFTmax Pro software package.<br>
The wells were emptied, washed in tap water and the monolayers stained with 50jil/well of 2% crystal violet in 20% methanol/watsr for at least 1 hour. The wells were then washed and air-dried and the monolayers examined under the microscope for indications of cell toxicity.<br>
Results<br>
SOFTmax data files were exported to Excel. Data handling used Excel templates written in-house for plotting dose response curves graphically and calculating 1C50 values from the curves obtained.<br>
All replicate wells were meaned. The assay window was calculated by subtracting the meaned cell control (CC) from the meaned virus control (VC). For each compound, the meaned CC was subtracted from the meaned values for each concentration point. The % of control was then calculated for each concentration point as a percentage of the window. % of control was plotted against compound concentration. A straight line was fitted to the curve and the slope and intercept functions were used to calculate the 1C50.<br>
The IC50 for Compound "A" was calculated for each background concentration of Compound "B". Similarly, the IC50 for Compound tcB" was calculated for each background<br>
concentration of Compound "A".<br>
