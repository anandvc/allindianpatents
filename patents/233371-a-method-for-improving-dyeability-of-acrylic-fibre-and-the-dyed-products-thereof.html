				<td>The present invention relates to A Method for improving Dyeability of Acrylic Fibre and the Dyed Products thereof.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to a method of modification of the acrylic fibres, which are incapable of dyeing with acid or reactive or disperse dye, more particularly, to a method of partial conversion of acrylonitrile of acrylic fibre into an active amino group to make them suitable for dyeing with acid, reactive, disperse dyes, even more particularly to a method of partial conversion of acrylic fibre comprising acrylonitrile group into an acrylic fibre comprising of acrylonitrile group and an active amino group to make them suitable for dyeing with acid, reactive, disperse dyes and to a method of dyeing the said modified acrylic fibre and the dyed products thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The dyeing of the polymeric fibre particularly the acrylic fibre is highly specific in nature due to the inherentcharacteristics of the acrylic fibre. The inherent characteristics of the acrylic fibre, such as low moisture absorption and dyeability are mainly due to the presence of the nitrile group, such as acrylonitrile groups.<br>
The compactness of the polymeric structure, particularly the acrylic fibre structure also adds to the specificity of the dyeing of the polymeric fibre, particularly the acrylic fibre. This compactness is again mainly due to the presence of nitriole groups such as acrylonitrile groups.<br>
The highly specificity of the dyeing process of the polymeric fibre as referred hereinabove means that such fibres have restricted dyeability with various classes of dyes like acid, reactive, and disperse dyes.<br>
The commercially available polymeric fibres particularly acrylic fibreshave up to 15% of the comonomer, particularly acrylic monomer, which makes them dyeable with the<br><br>
disperse dyes. However, this characteristic does not improve the dyeability of the polymeric fibres particularly of the acrylic fibres towards the reactive and acid dyes. Further, the dyeability towards the disperse dyes is also not improved to the satisfactory extent.<br>
Therefore the polymeric fibres, particularly acrylic fibres have poor or no dyeability towards the reactive, acid, and also disperse dyes.<br>
Further, the dyeing of the polymeric fibres particularly the acrylic fibres, as known in the prior art is carried out at high temperatures. The temperature of the dyeing process is close to the boiling temperature of water that is as high as 100°C. This requirement necessitates the consumption of high energy, which in turn makes the dyeing process economically unviable.<br>
Therefore any improvement or the modification of the acrylic fibres, which makes them dyeable with the known and commonly used dyes such as basic and disperse dyes and particularly enhances the dyeability of such fibres towards the disperse dyes in addition to making them dyeable towards the acid and reactive dyes will make the acrylic fibres suitable for dyeing with wide spectrum of available dyes. Further, if such process could be carried out at lower temperature, preferably at the room temperature will result in the energy saving and hence make the whole process economically viable and ecofriendly.<br>
Further, drawback of known method of improving the polymeric fibres is that the use of the agents to improve the said fibres results in the destruction of the morphological structure of the said fibresand some times in the change in colour of the fibres to the unwanted colour. However, as aresult of such methods the improvement of the dyeability characteristics of the said fibres is rarely observed to the satisfactory level.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a method of improving the dyeability of acrylic fibres and the dyed products thereof. Particularly, there is a need to have a method of modification of polymeric fibre particularly acrylic fibre, which are incapable of dyeing with acid, reactive, and disperse dyes, which can overcome the drawbacks of the prior art<br><br>
as described herein above. More particularly, the need is to have a method of partial conversion of acrylonitrile groups of acrylic fibres in to an active group, which in turn make them suitable for dyeing with acid, reactive, and disperse dyes and at the same time can enhance the dyeability of the acrylic fibres, particularly the acrylic fibres towards the commonly available acid, reactive, and disperse dyes and a method of dyeing the said modified acrylic fibres resulting into desired dyed products.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This is the main object of the present invention is to propose a complete disclosure of a method of improving the dyeability of acrylic fibre and the dyed products thereof, which can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art as described herein above.<br>
Another object of the present invention to propose particularly for a method of modification of the acrylic fibre, which are incapable of dyeing with acid or reactive or disperse dyes, which can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art as described herein above.<br>
Further, the object of the present invention to propose for a method of partial conversion of acrylic fibre comprising of acrylonitrile group, which are responsible for poor or no dyeability of acrylic fibres as stated herein above into an acrylic fibre comprising of acrylonitrile group and active amino group to make them suitable for dyeing with acid or reactive or disperse dyes, which can be carried out at the room temperature.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a complete disclosure of the method of dyeing the modified acrylic fibres as achieved in the first step of this invention, which can also be carried out totally at the room temperature and the dyed products thereof.<br>
This is still another object of the present invention is to propose a complete disclosure of the method as stated herein above, wherein the morphological structure of the fibre is not<br><br>
destroyed and at the same time there is no change in colour of fibres to the unwanted colour. But the dyeability characteristics of the said fibres is improved to the desired extent.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose for a method as stated herein above, wherein the resulted modified acrylic fibre has the reduced compactness and enhanced moisture absorption capacity.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a complete disclosure of a method of improving the dyeability of acrylic fibre and the dyed products thereof.<br>
Particularly, the present invention provides a method of modification of polymeric fibre particularly the acrylic fibres, which are incapable of dyeing with acid or reactive or disperse dyes, particularly with acid or reactive dyes. More particularly the invention provides a complete disclosure of a method of partial conversion of acrylic fibre comprising of acrylonitrile group and active group, which in turn make them suitable for dyeing with acid, reactive, disperse dyes and at the same time enhances the dyeabiility of the acrylic fibres towards the commonly available acid, reactive, and disperse dyes and in addition the resulted modified said fibre has reduced compactness and enhanced moisture absorption capacity.<br>
Further, accordingly this invention also provides a method of dyeing the said modified fibres particularly acrylic fibres, which in turn results in the desired dyed products.<br>
