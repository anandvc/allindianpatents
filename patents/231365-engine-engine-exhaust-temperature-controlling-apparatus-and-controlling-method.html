ENGINE, ENGINE EXHAUST TEMPERATURE CONTROLLING APPARATUS.<br>
AND CONTROLLING METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an invention for controlling an electronic fuel spray<br>
valve in an engine such as a gas engine, thereby automatically adjusting the exhaust<br>
temperatures of cylinders so as to reduce variation between them, and more specifically<br>
relates to an engine which can be controlled in this way, and a controlling apparatus and<br>
a method for controlling the engine exhaust temperature, which make such control<br>
possible.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
In a multi-cylinder engine, the temperatures of the exhausts from the cylinders<br>
do not match, and, in engines for commercial use, variation in the exhaust, temperatures<br>
of the cylinders is presently regulated to less than an average of ± 15°C at a load of<br>
100 %. The exhaust temperature of a cylinder which has exceeded this range is<br>
adjusted by manually adjusting a gas-adjusting valve of the cylinder, thereby balancing<br>
the exhaust temperatures of the cylinders.<br>
However, since the gas-adjusting valve is adjusted at a load of 100 %, there is<br>
greater variation between the exhaust temperatures of the cylinders at loads other than<br>
100 %. Furthermore, even at a load of 100 %, the set value of the gas-adjusting valve<br>
deviates from its initial setting as years pass, so that the set value may require re-<br>
adjustment. Unless this deviation in the set value due to the passage of time is dealt<br>
with, variation in the exhaust temperatures of the cylinders will greatly increase,<br>
causing misfire and knocking.<br>
Such misfire and knocking leads to considerable disadvantages when, for<br>
example, operating a co-generation system. That is, in a co-generation system, when<br><br>
the engine suffers misfire or knocking, the engine output (the amount of electricity generated by<br>
system) is reduced as a first step of human or mechanical safety procedures, and, as a second step, the<br>
engine is stopped; the result of reducing the engine output and stopping operating is not only to cease<br>
supplying the expected power, but may sometimes be non-profitable, after compensation claims of<br>
power contract infringement (demand-over).<br>
Therefore, a technique for automatically controlling the exhaust temperatures in the cylinders,<br>
so as to reliably balance the exhaust temperatures in the cylinders while the engine is operational, is<br>
desirable. This technique is also important in, for example, safely and stably operating the co-<br>
generation system mentioned above.<br>
This invention has been realized in view of the problems described above, and aims to<br>
provide an exhaust temperature control technique which can automatically control variation in the<br>
exhaust temperatures of the cylinders, and prevent misfire and knocking by keeping the exhaust<br>
temperatures of the cylinders within a predetermined range.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
A preferred embodiment of this invention will be explained with reference to<br>
FIGS. 1 to 6.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an embodiment of this invention. A gas engine<br>
of this invention has a plurality of cylinders. An electronic fuel spray valve 1 is<br>
attached to the cylinder head 2 of each cylinder. Each electronic fuel spray valve 1 is<br>
connected via a fuel gas pipe 3 to an unillustrated fuel supply source, and supplies gas<br>
fuel to a combustion chamber inside the cylinder. Further, an exhaust temperature<br>
gauge unit 4 is attached to each of the cylinder heads 2 of the cylinders. The exhaust<br>
temperature gauge units 4 measure the exhaust temperature near the exit of the each<br>
cylinder, and output an exhaust temperature signal 10 to a control unit 5, which is<br>
explained later. For example, a temperature gauge such as a pyrometer can be used as<br>
the exhaust temperature gauge unit 4. Incidentally, FIG. 1 shows one cylinder, and<br>
therefore show one electronic fuel spray valve 1 and one exhaust temperature gauge unit<br>
4, however in fact, the electronic fuel spray valve 1 and the exhaust temperature gauge<br>
unit 4 are attached to each of a plurality of cylinders.<br>
Furthermore, the gas engine of this invention comprises an exhaust temperature<br><br>
control unit 5 (hereinafter abbreviated as "control unit") which controls an opening<br>
period of the electronic fuel spray valve 1 in order to keep the exhaust temperature of<br>
the cylinders within a predetermined range. The exhaust temperature gauge unit 4 and<br>
the electronic fuel spray valve 1 of each cylinder are connected to the control unit 5, and<br>
the exhaust temperature signal 10 is input from the exhaust temperature gauge unit 4; in<br>
addition, a control signal 11 is output to each electronic fuel spray valve 1, the opening<br>
period of each of the electronic fuel spray valves 1 being adjusted so as to keep the<br>
exhaust temperature within the predetermined range.<br>
More specifically, a computer, which adjusts the opening period of the<br>
electronic fuel spray valves 1 by processing data according to a predetermined sequence<br>
described later, and a governor, which has been set so that the same controls as the<br>
computer are executed, are used as the control unit 5.<br>
Moreover, the gas engine of this embodiment comprises a load factor measuring<br>
unit 6 which measures the load factor of the engine, and a rotation number measuring<br>
unit 7 which measures the number of rotations of the engine. These are connected to<br>
the control unit 5, and respectively output a load factor signal 12 and a.rotation number<br>
signal 13 to the control unit 5. The signals 12 and 13 are used as data by the control<br>
unit 5 to adjust the opening period of the electronic fuel spray valves 1.<br>
The gas engine of this embodiment is used as an engine for co-generation, and<br>
drives an unillustrated electric generator. Therefore, the load of the engine described<br>
above corresponds to the generated electrical power, and the load factor signifies the<br>
power rate. More specifically, a signal representing the power generated by the<br>
electric generator is sent to an unillustrated generator board, and the signal is output as<br>
the load factor signal 12 from the generator board to the control unit 5. That is, in the<br>
case of this embodiment, the electric generator and the generator board function as the<br>
load factor measuring unit 6.<br>
Furthermore, a non-contact type rotation number detecting element using light,<br>
provided in the rotation drive section of the engine, can be used as the rotation number<br>
measuring unit 7.<br><br>
An input unit 8 for setting predetermined data required for control is connected<br>
to the control unit 5 of the gas engine of this embodiment. The predetermined data<br>
required for control comprises the following (1) to (5).<br>
(1)	Control start (end) number of rotations [rpm]<br>
This is the number of rotations of the engine when the control starts when the<br>
number of rotations exceeds this value, and ends when the number of rotations falls<br>
below this value.<br>
(2)	Sampling set time [sec]<br>
This is the time interval for sampling the exhaust temperature signal, and can be<br>
set within a range of 0.1 seconds to 60 seconds in this embodiment.<br>
(3) Set load [%]<br>
This is the one or more load value which is set as the control split point in<br>
controlling this embodiment, eight values of LO to L7 being set in this embodiment.<br>
(4)	Duration rate Rdur [deg • Crank Angle/sec]<br>
This signifies the changing speed of the amount of control which is set in<br>
accordance with the values of the set load. The amount of control represents the<br>
opening period (in units of [degCA] ) of the electronic fuel spray valve 1, which is<br>
directly controlled by the control unit 5 in this embodiment. In this case, a changing<br>
amount of the opening period of the valve per a second is shown by the crank angle.<br>
For example, 0.1 degCA represents the open angle of the fuel spray valve is increased<br>
or decreased with 0.1 degCA in a second.<br>
(5)	Set deviation Tlimit [ºC]<br>
This is the value which determines the permissible range of the deviation<br>
between the actual exhaust temperature of each cylinder at the time of sampling, and the<br>
average exhaust temperature of all the cylinders of the gas engine. This value is set<br>
independently from the duration rate at each set load.<br>
FIG. 2 schematically shows the control of the exhaust temperature in the engine<br>
of this embodiment. The control sequence and function of the control unit 5 in this<br>
embodiment will be explained with reference to this figure.<br><br>
The control unit 5 regularly samples the exhaust temperature of each cylinder<br>
and the load of the engine at predetermined time intervals (tsamp [seconds]), and<br>
determines the set deviation (Tlimit [°C]) in accordance with the load; in addition, in the<br>
control of this embodiment, the control unit 5 calculates the average exhaust<br>
temperature (Tave [°C]) of all the cylinders.<br>
The deviation upper limit value and deviation lower limit value in FIG. 2<br>
respectively represent (average exhaust temperature Tave + set deviation Tlimit) [ ºC] and<br>
(average exhaust temperature Tave-set deviation Tlimit) [°C]. Even in the case where<br>
one of six cylinders departs from the range of the set deviation at a given time, as shown<br>
by the broken line in FIG. 2, according to the exhaust temperature control of this<br>
embodiment, the exhaust temperature of the cylinder is adjusted to within, the range of<br>
the set deviation (between the deviation upper limit and deviation lower limit).<br>
Here, in the control shown in FIG. 2, at a sampling set time of, for example, 0.1<br>
seconds, the control unit 5 performs the above calculation every 0.1 seconds.<br>
Furthermore, at a sampling set time of sixty seconds, the control unit 5 performs the<br>
above calculation every sixty seconds. In this embodiment, the sampling set time is<br>
two seconds.<br>
In the above calculation, at each sampling set time, the control unit 5 measures<br>
the exhaust temperature at the cylinder exit of each cylinder, calculates the average<br>
exhaust temperature of all the cylinders, compares the average exhaust temperature with<br>
the actual exhaust temperatures at the cylinder exits of the cylinders, and determines<br>
whether the exhaust temperature of each cylinder is below the predetermined set<br>
deviation. As mentioned above, this set deviation is the plus-minus (upper limit and<br>
lower limit) deviation with respect to the average value of the exhaust temperature.<br>
Then, the control unit 5 controls the electronic fuel spray valve 1 of any cylinder where<br>
the difference between the average exhaust temperature and the actual exhaust<br>
temperature departs from the set deviation.<br>
At the time of controlling the electronic fuel spray valve 1, the opening amount<br>
of the electronic fuel spray valve 1 is changed by using the duration rate, and the<br><br>
exhaust temperature of the cylinder being controlled is adjusted so as to be within the<br>
set deviation. Incidentally, as described above, the set deviation and the duration rate<br>
can be set to different values at each set load.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the relationship between the set load (load factor, horizontal axis)<br>
and the duration rate Rdur [deg • Crank Angle/sec] (vertical axis). Any number of set<br>
loads from L0 to L0 can be set; in this embodiment, n = 7 and there are a total of eight<br>
set loads. For instance. L0 is set at 0 %, L1 at 25 %, etc. Furthermore, as shown in<br>
FIG. 3, the duration rate between the points of the set loads (L0, L1. ...) is set so as to<br>
link them in straight lines.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the relationship between the set load (load factor, horizontal axis)<br>
and the set deviation Tlimt (vertical axis). Similarly in the case of set deviation, any<br>
number of set loads from L0 to Ln can be set; in this embodiment, n = 7 and there are a<br>
total of eight set loads, as described above. Incidentally, the set loads at this time can<br>
be set independently from the set loads of the duration rate. Further, as shown in FIG.<br>
4, each point of the set loads (L0, L1,...) is set so as to link them in straight lines.<br>
Furthermore, when the set deviation is set at 10°C. for example, the permissible<br>
range for the average exhaust temperature of the cylinders becomes plus or minus 10°C.<br>
and no control is carried out as long as the difference between the actual exhaust<br>
temperature and the average exhaust temperature is within this range; control is carried<br>
out when the difference is departed from this range.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart showing a sequence for controlling the exhaust temperature<br>
according to a control program which is written in the control unit 5. In FIG. 5,<br>
reference numerals S1 to S9 correspond to steps 1 to 9. The control sequence whereby<br>
the control unit 5 and the program written therein act in co-operation, and the control<br>
functions of the control unit 5 which are thereby realized, will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 5.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, after the engine is started, when the control unit 5 starts to<br>
operate, in step S1, the control unit 5 detects the number of rotations of the engine based<br>
on the rotation number signal 13, output by the rotation number measuring unit. Here,<br><br>
when the number of rotations of the engine is, for example, more than 950 rpm, a<br>
control operation is carried out and the sequence proceeds to step S2. On the other<br>
hand, when the number of rotations or the engine is below 950 rpm, no control<br>
operation is carried out, and step 1 is repeated after an appropriate interval.<br>
Incidentally, the number of rotations of the engine at which control should be carried<br>
out can be set as desired from the input unit.<br>
In step 2, the control unit 5 starts sampling the exhaust temperature. That is.<br>
based on the exhaust temperature signal 10 which was output from the exhaust<br>
temperature gauge unit 4, the control unit 5 detects the exhaust temperature of each<br>
cylinder at each predetermined sampling set time tsamp [seconds].<br>
In step 3, the control unit 5 instantly calculates the average exhaust temperature<br>
Tave [°C] from the exhaust temperatures of the cylinders, input at each sampling set time<br>
tsamp, [seconds].<br>
In step 4, the control unit 5 determines the load factor of the engine from the<br>
load factor signal 12, output by the load factor measuring unit 6. Then, from this load<br>
factor, the control unit 5 calculates the set deviation Tmlimit [°C] to determine whether to<br>
control the electronic fuel spray valve 1 based on FIG. 4, and in addition, when it has<br>
been determined to control the electronic fuel spray valve 1 based on FIG. 3, the control<br>
unit 5 calculates the duration rate Rdur [deg • CA/sec] to be used. Moreover, the<br>
control unit 5 compares the average exhaust temperature Tave [°C], which was<br>
calculated in step 3, with each (maximum of eighteen cylinder, minimum of six.<br>
cylinders) exhaust temperature T(n) [°C] , and calculates the deviation ∆Tn [°C] between<br>
them.<br>
In step 5, the control unit 5 determines whether the absolute value | ∆Tn | of the<br>
deviation ∆Tn [°C] in the cylinders is greater or smaller than the set deviation Tlimit [°C]<br>
in the abovementioned load factor, and thereby determines whether to control the<br>
electronic fuel spray valve 1 of each cylinder.<br>
In the case where | ∆Tn | &gt;Tlimit, control is necessary since the exhaust<br>
temperature deviation ∆Tn [°C] of the cylinder exceeds the set deviation Tlimit [°C] .<br><br>
Therefore, the sequence proceeds to the subsequent step 6 (equation (1) in step 5 of FIG.<br>
5). In the case where | ∆Tn | ≤Tlimit, there is no need to adjust the fuel spray period in<br>
the electronic fuel spray valve 1 of the cylinder, since the exhaust temperature deviation<br>
ATn [ºC] of the cylinder is within the set deviation Tlimit [°C]. Therefore, the control<br>
unit 5 returns to step 2 and repeats the same sequence (equation (2) in step 5 of FIG. 5).<br>
In step 6, the control unit 5 calculates the code of the exhaust temperature<br>
deviation ∆Tn [°C] , and determines whether the present exhaust temperature T(n) [°C]<br>
of the cylinder has departed toward the high temperature side or the low temperature<br>
side. That is. when ∆Tn &gt;0 (equation (1) in step 6 of FIG. 5). the exhaust temperature<br>
T(n) 
temperature T(n) [°C] of the cylinder has departed toward the low temperature side.<br>
When ATnthe<br>
average exhaust temperature Tave, and it is determined that the present exhaust<br>
temperature T(n) [°C] of the cylinder has departed toward the high temperature side.<br>
In step 6, when the exhaust temperature T(n) of the cylinder 
exhaust temperature Tave (i.e. when ∆Tn&gt;0), the present exhaust temperature of the<br>
cylinder has departed from the lower limit value toward the low temperature side, and<br>
consequently, the control unit 5 proceeds to step 7, where the exhaust temperature of the<br>
cylinder is increased. That is, the control unit 5 uses the duration rate Rdur [deg • CA<br>
/sec], which is the changing speed of the opening period of the electronic fuel spray<br>
valve 1 of the cylinder and is determined in step 4, to calculate a target value for the<br>
opening period as shown in FIG. 6, applies the output signal 11 to the electronic fuel<br>
spray valve 1, and changes the opening period of the electronic fuel spray valve 1.<br>
More specifically, when tc represents the time lapse from determining that control was<br>
required in step 5 and passing the loop of steps 9, 2, 3, 4, ... until it is finally determined<br>
in step 5 that control is unnecessary and control is stopped, the target value for the<br>
initial value D0 of the target value of the opening period of the valve is expressed by the<br>
following equation.<br>
Target value of opening period [degCA] = D0 + Dc<br><br>
Here. Dc [degCA] = Rdur [degCA/sec] x tc [sec].<br>
Furthermore, in step 6. when the exhaust temperature T(n) of the cylinder -'the<br>
average exhaust temperature Tave (i.e. when ∆T0 
the cylinder has departed from the higher limit value toward the high temperature side,<br>
and consequently, the control unit 5 proceeds to step 8, where the exhaust temperature<br>
of the cylinder is decreased. That is, the control unit 5 uses the duration rate Rdur<br>
[deg • CA/sec], which is the changing speed of the opening period of the electronic<br>
fuel spray valve 1 of the cylinder and is determined in step 4, to calculate a target value<br>
for the opening period as shown in FIG. 7, applies the output signal 11 to the electronic<br>
fuel spray valve 1, and changes the opening period of the electronic fuel spray valve 1.<br>
More specifically, when to represents the time lapse from determining that control was<br>
required in step 5 and passing the loop of steps 9, 2, 3, 4, ... until it is finally determined<br>
in step 5 that control is unnecessary and control is stopped, the target value for the<br>
initial value D0 of the target value of the opening period of the valve is expressed by the<br>
following equation.<br>
Target value of opening period [degCA] = D0 — Dc<br>
Here, Dc [degCA] = Rdur [degCA/sec] X to [sec].<br>
After the fuel spray amount has been adjusted by adjusting the opening period of<br>
the electronic fuel spray valve 1 to keep it within the set deviation during the duration<br>
control, (i.e. in step 7 and step 8), in step 9, the control unit 5 detects the number of<br>
rotations of the engine in the same manner as in step 1 and, when the number of<br>
rotations of the engine is greater than, for example, 950 rpm, the control sequence<br>
returns to step 2 and repeats the procedures of steps 2 through 7, and 8. As a<br>
consequence, by increasing or decreasing the opening period of the electronic fuel spray<br>
valve 1 with the duration rate Rdur [degCA/sec], set at each load of the engine,<br>
cylinders which have departed from their set deviations are continuously controlled so<br>
that their exhaust temperatures are kept within the set deviation. When the number of<br>
rotations of the engine is less than 950 rpm in step 9, the control operation stops.<br>
Incidentally, the same reference number of rotations is set in step 1 and step 9.<br><br>
In the control described above, variation in the exhaust temperature is generally<br>
greater when at low load, and smaller at high load. When variation in the exhaust<br>
temperature at low load is reduced in the same way as at high load, there is a possibility<br>
that unwarranted control will diffuse the exhaust temperature (make it non-divergent).<br>
Conversely, it is sometimes difficult to carry out control when the duration rate value is<br>
high at high load, and the control speed may be reduced when the duration rate value is<br>
low at low load. That is, the duration rate has appropriate amount of adjustment which<br>
varies according to the load.<br>
To deal with this, the set deviation and duration rate at each load may be<br>
changed so that the exhaust temperature remains within an exhaust temperature range<br>
which is appropriate for that load. Generally, the set deviation and duration rate tend<br>
to increase as the load decreases, and decrease and medium and high load. Since the<br>
set deviation and duration rate are independent, there is a merit that precise control<br>
appropriate for the load can be performed.<br>
FIG. 8 is a graph showing effects of controlling the engine according to this<br>
embodiment.<br>
In this case, the operational status of the engine is changed from a load factor of<br>
50 % to one of 80 %, and the load factor is then returned to 50 %. The set deviation<br>
Tlimit [°C] is set to plus or minus 10°C from the exhaust temperature average value at the<br>
cylinder exits of all the cylinders. The duration rate Rdur [degCA/sec] is set to 0.05<br>
[degCA/sec] at a load factor of between 50 % and 80%.<br>
In FIG. 8. there is a cylinder having an exhaust temperature which has departed<br>
from the deviation upper limit and deviation lower limit of the set deviation at the point<br>
where the load factor is approximately 65%. Usually, unless controlled, the exhaust<br>
temperature would not be restored and the cylinders would operate with unbalanced<br>
exhaust temperatures; however, due to the effect of the control, as shown in FIG. 8. the<br>
exhaust temperature is thereafter restored to within its normal range. Thus, according<br>
to the control, even in circumstances where there is a possibility of variation in the<br>
exhaust temperatures, the variation can be automatically corrected, and as a result.<br><br>
knocking and misfire caused by an unbalance in the exhaust temperatures of the<br>
cylinders can be prevented.<br>
Incidentally, the engine used in the embodiment described above has a cylinder<br>
diameter of 220 mm and six cylinders, but the present invention can achieve similar<br>
effects even when the cylinder diameter and number of cylinders are changed.<br>
Furthermore, although the duration rate and the set deviation are divided into a total of<br>
eight loads, this number can be increased or decreased as necessary.<br>
Furthermore, although this embodiment relates to a gas engine, it can be applied<br>
in any other type of gas engine in which the opening period of an electronic fuel spray<br>
valve is adjusted in order to control the exhaust temperature.<br><br>
