This invention relates to floor cleaning<br>
Floor cleaning was carried out in earlier days by squatting on the floor and rubbing away dirt with a wet cloth. As this was found to be very tiresome, mop consisting of a rod with coarse strings or cloth fastened to its end, became widely used. The main disadvantages of this method are<br>
i.   Both hands have to be used as pressure has to be applied on the ground for proper cleaning. This causes considerable physical strain.<br>
ii. The mop has to be dipped in water before cleaning, and the dirt and water has to be squeezed out, every now and then, during the process of cleaning.<br>
Vacuum cleaners are used for cleaning floor, but they are not as effective on floors as on carpets as adhering dirt can not be removed by vacuum sucking<br>
Although   various   electrically   operated   floor   cleaning   devices   are   known,   their performance is not quite satisfactory on account of reasons like.<br>
i.   They do not permit cleaning under spaces of low heights such as coats, cabinets etc. ii. They are heavy and difficult to operate with one hand.<br>
iii. Because of the complexity involved in incorporating vacuum for sucking liquids after cleaning etc. they are difficult and expensive to maintain.<br>
My invention is an electrically operated scrubbing cum mopping machine which has none of the above drawbacks. The weight of the machine exerts pressure on the floor and it is not necessary to exert any additional pressure. The machine rests over the floor on two tyres at the back and two brushes at the front. The floor gets automatically cleaned due to the wiping action of the brushes when the machine is switched 'ON' and pushed along the floor. 'ON'-'OFF' switch is mounted on a handle with LED status indication and the cleaning operation can be easily carried out using one hand even under spaces of low height. It can be used for scrubbing or for mopping or as a combined scrubbing and mopping machine by fixing brushes having nylon bristles and brushes made with coarse cotton thread on the brush holders. The brushes can be easily fixed and removed from the brush holders by sliding. The machine consumes only 0.15 Kwh / hour.<br>
One form of invention consist of a single phase induction motor, the circular motion of which is transmitted by a belt and pulley arrangement to a crank shaft, having two cranks, spaced 180 degrees apart, carrying two connecting rods, the other ends of which are connected to two brush holder fixing units. A metallic guide shaft controls the motion of the brush holder fixing units so that they come together and move apart repeatedly along the same line thus carrying out wiping action when the motor is switched 'ON'. The frame work also carry a water tank, cone nozzles and hose connecting them . All the above components are mounted on a framework made of aluminum angles.<br><br>
The machine rests over the floor on two tyres at the back and two brushes fixed on the brush holder units at the front. Supply to the machine is effected using insulated cable run through a hollow handle which carries a touch switch to control an 'ON'-'OFF' contactor, and LED status indication. When the machine is switched cON' the water stored in tank mounted on the aluminum sprayed through the cone nozzles on the floor. The floor gets cleaned due to the wiping action of the brushes when it is pushed over the floor<br>
A steel or fiber glass brush cleaning tray with two inlets and two outlets for entry and overflow of water, holding a stainless steel grill consisting of 3mm steel rods welded at either end also form part of the invention.<br>
For cleaning the brushes the machine is placed on the brush cleaning tray such that the brush portion rests on the steel grill. Fresh water is let in through inlet holes of the tray. When the machine is switched cON' the brushes will wipe over the grill and the dirt will be removed and the dirty water will flow out through the outlets. The machine can then be used for further cleaning.<br>
When the brushes are cleaned repeatedly dirt will accumulate at the bottom of the tray and this has to be washed out after removing the grill.<br>
Other forms of inventions are<br>
i.   Machine having one brush<br>
ii. Machine having two brushes at angle or at opposite sides of the crankshaft.<br>
iii. Machine having three brushes in parallel or at angles.<br>
iv. Machine having four brushes in parallel or at angles.<br>

Detailed description (Ref. fig 1)<br>
The machine consists of a frame (21) made of aluminum angles with holes drilled so as to mount the clamp for motor (4), single phase induction motor (5), tyre fixing clamp (2), tyre shall for mounting tyres (3), main pulley (9), supports (13) of metallic guide shaft (14) for guiding the movement of brush holder fixing units (15,16) along the same line, water tank (22) and nozzles (23). The crank shaft (10) is fixed on the main pulley (9) and the two connecting rods (11,12) fixed on the crank shaft (10) go to the center pins of the brush holder fixing units (15,16). Brush holders (18) are fixed on the four corner pins of the brush holder fixing unit (15,16). Brushers (19) are inserted into the brush holders (18) by sliding the base of the brush into the ,C shaped holder. A CV belt (24) is provided for transmitting the rotation of the motor (5) to the crank shaft (10) The handle (1) is 'Y' shaped at the bottom and has 2 holes for the passage of tyre shafts.<br>
The supply to the machine is by insulated flexible cable drawn through the handle, and controlled by a relay actuated by a touch-switch located in the handle. The status of the machine is indicated by LEDs on the handle.<br>
There are two tyres connected by shafts fixed on the tyre fixing clamps. The bottom end of the handle is 'Y' shaped and has holes for the passage of the shafts.<br>
There arc two types of brushes<br>
i.   Brushes made of coarse cotton thread for mopping.( coarse cotton thread can be easily<br>
replaced when its gets worn out) ii. Brushes having nylon bristles for scrubbing<br>
The machine rests on the two tyres and the two brushes<br>
When the machine is switched 'ON', using the touch switch on the handle, the motor is actuated. The rotary motion of the motor is transmitted to the crank shaft by a belt and pulley arrangement. This rotary motion is converted into to-and-fro or reciprocating motion of brush holder fixing units by two cranks, spaced 180 degrees apart, carrying two connecting rods of different lengths the other ends of which are connected to the brush holder fixing units guided by a metallic shaft restrict the motion so that they come together and move apart along the same line. Tilting of brush holder fixing units is prevented by four bearings resting against the top frame.<br>
For mopping coarse cotton thread brushes are used and for scrubbing nylon bristled brushes are used. One brush holder with coarse cotton thread and the other with nylon bristles can be used for better cleaning. Brushes are inserted into the brush holder by sliding the base of the brush into the 'C shaped holder.<br><br>
Before starting mopping water is to be sprinkled on the floor either manually or by fixing tank with nozzles on the frame of the machine . The machine is switched 'ON' and pushed along the floor. The brushes continuously wipe the floor (the wiping action of the brushes is such that they come together and move away repeatedly). The dirt get collected on the brush. When it is to be cleaned, the handle is lifted higher than the normal using angle. The handle then gets locked up by a gravity lock The machine cati then be freely pushed along the floor without the brushes touching the ground. The machine is placed on the brush cleaning tray such that the brush portion touches the steel grill. Fresh water is let in through inlet holes of the tray. When the machine is switched 'ON' the brushes will wipe over the grills and the dirt will be removed and the dirty water will flow out through the outlets. The machine can then be used for further cleaning.<br>
When the brushes are cleaned repeatedly the dirt will accumulate at the bottom of the tray and this has to be washed out after removing the grill.<br><br><br>
