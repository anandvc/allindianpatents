				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of chewing gum. In particular, the present<br>
invention provides a gum base and a chewing gum comprising a biodegradable<br>
polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) above 37°C.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
It is generally recognized that chewing gum that is dropped in indoor or outdoor<br>
environments gives rise to considerable nuisances and inconveniences due to the fact<br>
that the dropped gum sticks firmly to e.g. street and pavement surfaces and to shoes<br>
and clothes of people being present or moving in the environments. Adding<br>
substantially to such nuisances and inconveniences is the fact that conventional<br>
chewing gum products are based on the use of elastomeric and resinous polymers of<br>
natural or synthetic origin that are substantially non-degradable in the environment.<br>
Cleaning off the dropped chewing gum remnants is often costly and without<br>
satisfactory results.<br>
Attempts to reduce the nuisances associated with the widespread use of chewing gum<br>
have e.g. involved improvement of cleaning methods or incorporation of anti-stick-<br>
ing agents into chewing gum formulations. However, none of these precautions have<br>
contributed significantly to solving the pollution problem.<br>
In recent time an increasing amount of interest has been paid to synthetic polyesters,<br>
which are hydrolysable to smaller compounds, which are more easily degradable by<br>
environmental effects and/or removed via metabolic pathways.<br><br>
In US 5,672,367 it has been disclosed that chewing gum may be made from certain<br>
synthetic polymers having in their polymer chains chemically unstable bonds that<br>
can be broken under the influence of light or hydrolytically into water-soluble and<br>
non-toxic components. In US 5,672,367 such polymers, which are obtained by the<br>
polymerization of cyclic esters, e.g. lactides, glycolides, and ε-caprolactone, are<br>
referred to as biodegradable. Furthermore according to the same document such<br>
polymers as applied in chewing gum have a glass transition temperature of at most<br>
37°C<br>
The upper limit of the glass transition temperature being substantially at human body<br>
temperature is a general assumption throughout the prior art within the area of biode-<br>
gradable chewing gum polymers. The importance of keeping the glass transition<br>
temperature of chewing gum polymers substantially below human body temperature<br>
seams to be a logical consequence of the basic properties related to the glass tran-<br>
sition temperature (Tg). Usually Tg is loosely defined as the temperature at which a<br>
polymer undergoes a significant change in properties. Accordingly, Tg may be<br>
described as the temperature where a polymer structure turns "rubbery" upon heating<br>
and "glassy" upon cooling.<br>
Therefore, the glass transition temperature is in the prior art of biodegradable<br>
chewing gum polymers generally kept substantially below human body temperature.<br>
An example of such prior art-chewing gum polymer is disclosed in WO 00/19837<br>
wherein it is stated that caprolactone may be toxic and should be avoided as a<br>
masticatory substance. As 'the applied polymer comprises no low-Tg-inducing<br>
monomers, the Tg is found to be too high. Therefore a large amount of plasticizer is<br>
used to obtain a poly(D,L-lactic acid) polymer with a lower Tg. According to WO<br>
00/19837, the Tg is shifted from a higher value to a lower, whereby the resulting<br>
polymer according to WO 00/1983 7-is much more rubbery and elastic.<br><br>
A drawback of using these large amounts of plasticizer such as triacetin in chewing<br>
gum may be that the robustness of the chewing gum is compromised, especially if<br>
the chewing gum contains rather aggressive chewing gum ingredients such as acids<br>
or fats.<br>
Another approach in order to obtain a combined advantageous texture and a<br>
robustness with respect to gum base or chewing gum components is to mix the<br>
biodedegradable polymer with different kinds of natural resins. The resin compounds<br>
are contributing to obtain the desired masticatory properties and acting as plasticizers<br>
for the elastomers of the gum base composition.<br>
Resin in conventional chewing gum bases typically include synthetic resins such as<br>
polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and natural resins such as rosin esters, which are often<br>
referred to as ester gums. Additionally, natural resins such as glycerol esters of<br>
partially hydrogenated rosins, glycerol esters of polymerized rosins, glycerol esters<br>
of partially dimerized rosins, glycerol esters of tally oil rosins, pentaerythritol esters<br>
of partially hydrogenated rosins, methyl esters of rosins, partially hydrogenated<br>
methyl esters of rosins and pentaerythritol esters of rosins are typically applied in<br>
chewing gum bases. Other resinous compounds typically applied in chewing gum<br>
bases include synthetic resins such as terpene resins derived from alpha-pinene, beta-<br>
pinene, and/or d-limonene and natural terpene resins.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid the application of natural resin<br>
because of lack of degradability of these components.<br>
The synthetic resin polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is substantially non-degradable in the<br>
environment and thus the use of this resin polymer in gum bases has a high influence<br>
on the non-degradability of chewing gum. PVA is usually added to a gum base in<br>
amounts dependent upon the molecular weight range, and thereby i.e. provides<br>
stretch or elasticity to the gum base. The total amount of PVA used in a gum base<br><br>
composition is usually from about 5% to 95% by weight based on the total gum base<br>
composition. Typically, the amount of PVA in chewing gum bases is in the range of<br>
10-30%, and thus constitutes a major part of the entire gum base composition. As<br>
this synthetic resin is substantially non-degradable in the environment, this<br>
component in the gum base contributes significantly to the overall non-degradability<br>
of chewing gum based on such gum bases.<br>
It is an object of the invention to create a biodegradable polymer, suited for chewing<br>
gum and with improved degradability.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to prepare a chewing gum comprising a<br>
polymer, which is particularly degradable and may substitute the resin part of a<br>
chewing gum.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to obtain a chewing gum polymer having<br>
improved biodegradability properties with respect to e.g. degradation process and/or<br>
the degradation residues.	 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention relates to a chewing gum comprising at least one biodegradable<br>
polymer in an amount of from about 0.1 % to about 95 %, said biodegradable<br>
polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) above 37°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a chewing gum comprises at least one<br>
biodegradable polymer in'an amount of from about 0.1 % to about 95 %, said<br>
biodegradable polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) above 37°C and<br>
having a molecular weight (Mn) within' the range of approximately 500 to 60000<br>
g/mol and wherein said chewing gum comprises less than approximately 5% by<br>
weight of natural resins. <br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a high Tg of the low molecular weight<br>
polymer component of the chewing gum, namely the biodegradable component<br>
having a molecular weight (Mn) within the range of approximately 500 to 400000<br>
g/mol, results in an improved effect of the applied low molecular weight polymer. In<br>
other words, according to the invention an improved effect of the low molecular<br>
weight polymer component has been obtained. Such improvement may e.g. result in<br>
the possibility of reducing the overall amount of the low molecular weight polymers<br>
which may be significant with respect to stability. This is in particular the fact when<br>
dealing with biodegradable chewing gum.<br>
According to the invention the amount of natural resins in the final chewing gum<br>
should be kept low due to the fact that the desired biodegradability is compromised<br>
by the nature of the natural resins available.<br>
Moreover, according to an embodiment of the invention, the use of high-Tg<br>
polymers facilitates the use of high-Tg-inducing monomers, which may be regarded<br>
as more biodegradable when dealing with e.g. lactidε-based or glycolidε- based<br>
biodegradable polymers. Thus, degrad'ability of lactonε-polymers is not as fast as<br>
either lactidε- or glycolidε-polymers, and furthermore the degradation products of<br>
lactonε-polymers are less preferred than those of lactide and/or glycolide polymers.<br>
Moreover, the application of high-Tg properties according to the invention facilitates<br>
use of advantageous polymer monomers. According to an advantageous embodiment<br>
of the invention, a biodegradable polymer may be made substantially on the basis of<br>
lactides and/or glycolides alone and/or the content of lactones may be minimized.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the chewing should comprise<br>
less than approximately 2% by weight of natural resins.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprises said at least one<br>
biodegradable polymer in an amount of from about 2 to 60 % by weight.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg) above about 40°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum is substantially free of natural<br>
resins.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, use of natural resins should<br>
be avoided in order to obtain a chewing gum, which may be regarded as completely<br>
biodegradable due to the fact that natural resins features very little biodegradability,<br>
if any, compared to typical synthetic polyester-based polymers.<br>
The natural resins, which according to the present invention should be avoided,<br>
include natural rosin esters, often referred to as ester gums including as examples<br>
glycerol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, glycerol esters of polymerised<br>
rosins, glycerol esters of partially dimerised rosins, glycerol esters of tally oil rosins,<br>
pentaerythritol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins, methyl esters of rosins,<br>
partially hydrogenated methyl esters of rosins, pentaerythritol esters of rosins.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, even those natural resins,<br>
which according to some litterature may have some degradability over very long<br>
periods and at elevated temperatures, are also not acceptable according to the present<br>
invention in any considerable amount.<br>
Other resinous compounds include synthetic resins such as terpene resins derived<br>
from alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and/or d-limonene, natural terpene resins. Such<br>
resins are not regarded as biodegradable according to the present invention. Thus,<br><br>
they are not acceptable according to the present invention in any considerable<br>
amount.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to avoid the application of natural resin<br>
because of the marked lack of degradability of these components. According to the<br>
present invention, the biodegradable polymers with a high Tg of at least 37°C has a<br>
larger effect as resinous compounds than biodegradable polymers of lower Tg.<br>
Hence, the biodegradable polymers of high Tg may be excellent substitutes for<br>
natural resins.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the amount of resin substitute in a chewing<br>
gum may be lowered, when applying the effective high-Tg-polymers of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprising said at least one<br>
biodegradable polymer further comprises at least one elastomeric compound.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a plasticizing<br>
effect on said elastomeric compound.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the biodegradable polymer with Tg<br>
above 37°C functions as plasticizer for the elastomeric part of the chewing gum. In<br>
other words, according to an embodiment of the invention, the high Tg<br>
biodegradable polymer acts as elastomer plasticizer, which is typically the role of a<br>
resinous compound. The biodegradable chewing gum polymer of the present<br>
invention may therefore be referred to as a biodegradable resin.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention; the total content of polymers, including one or<br>
more biodegradable resins of high Tg and one or more elastomeric compounds, in<br>
the final chewing gum may preferably be in the range of 5 to 90%, preferably in the<br><br>
range of 20 to 70% by weight of the chewing gum. A polymer content, which is too<br>
low, may result in a chewing gum, which is too soft, which dissolves in the mouth<br>
and is completely swallowed or leaving a water insoluble part, which is too small for<br>
chewing. On the other hand, if the polymer content is too high, the chewing gum<br>
may be extremely hard and/or falling apart. Within the limits of reasonable polymer<br>
content, there are various possibilities of adjusting the texture of a chewing gum<br>
comprising a biodegradable resin of high Tg according to the present invention.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprises said biodegradable<br>
polymer in an amount in the range of 2 to 50 %.<br>
According to the invention, the robustness of the chewing gum may be enhanced by<br>
an increase in the amount of the polymer part of the chewing gum. Specifically<br>
according to the invention, when keeping the elastomer content at a constant level,<br>
while increasing the amount of biodegradable polymer of high Tg according to the<br>
invention, the robustness of the chewing gum may be clearly enhanced.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprises said biodegradable<br>
polymer in an amount in the range of 5 to 40 %, preferably in the range of 10 to 30<br>
%.<br>
It should be noted, that it is important in the manufacture of chewing gum to bring<br>
about a balance between elastomeric and resinous compounds. According to the<br>
present invention, a biodegradable polymer of high Tg, which is above human body<br>
temperature, is suitable as at least one of the resinous polymers in a chewing gum.<br>
The amount of the resinous biodegradable polymer should preferably not encompass<br>
the whole polymer part of the chewing gum. Depending on the actual elastomer used,<br>
the resin content may advantageously be lowered to make room for a higher content<br>
of elastomer, which may improve the texture of the final chewing gum.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprises said biodegradable<br>
polymer in an amount in the range of 5 to 25 %.<br>
According to the invention, the final chewing gum texture may be designed by<br>
adjusting the amount of high-Tg-polymer. The sufficient amount, according to the<br>
present invention, of the biodegradable polymer in a chewing gum may preferably be<br>
considerably lower than the amount, which would be necessary in the case of using a<br>
comparable polymer with a lower Tg.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg) above 38 °C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum comprises an elastomeric<br>
compound in an amount of at least 0.5 %, preferably at least 1 % by weight of the<br>
chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum comprises an elastomeric<br>
compound in an amount of at least 5 %, preferably at least 8 % by weight of the<br>
chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum comprises an elastomeric<br>
compound in an amount within the range of about 1% to 40% by weight of the<br>
chewing gum.	 <br>
According to the present invention, the high-Tg biodegradable polymer may be<br>
considered to hereby have a great strength as a resin compound i.e. an advantageous<br>
plasticizer or solvent for the elastomeric compound in the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg) in the range of 38°C to 90°C.<br><br>
Previously it was supposed that polymers applied in chewing gum had to have a Tg-<br>
value below human body temperature, because logically Tg would be the limit<br>
between a polymer being glassy or being chewable. Now it has surprisingly been<br>
found, that it is possible to apply a polymer having a Tg-value well above human<br>
body temperature without compromising the chewability of the final chewing gum,<br>
as the polymer may provide the function of a resin, i.e. as a plasticizer for an<br>
elastomer in the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a glass transition<br>
temperature in the range of 41°C to 75°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a glass transition<br>
temperature in the range of 42°C to 65°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a glass transition<br>
temperature in the range of 43 °C to 48°C.<br>
The present invention relates to a chewing gum comprising biodegradable polymers<br>
having favorable resinous properties and being exceedingly degradable. Furthermore<br>
the degradation products of the inventive biodegradable chewing gum polymers are<br>
notably desirable as they are part of biochemical pathways.<br>
When the Tg of the biodegradable polyester polymer of the invention is a couple of<br>
degrees above mouth temperature, but not more than about ten to twenty degrees<br>
above mouth temperature, an advantageous embodiment of the invention may be<br>
obtained, as the performance as resinous and elastomer plasticizing compound is<br>
high without imparting too hard texture in the final chewing gum.<br><br>
Moreover, a high robustness may be obtained of the chewing gum comprising the<br>
biodegradable polymer having Tg in this Tg-range.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a molecular<br>
weight (Mn) in the range of 1000 to 40000 g/mol, preferably in the range of 1000 to<br>
25000 g/mol.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a relatively low molecular<br>
weight of the relevant biodegradable polymer is one of the factors leading to a<br>
desirable texture of the final chewing gum. The low molecular weight polymer<br>
should provide the resinous properties, typically a plasticizing effect, which is useful<br>
in combination with elastomeric polymers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polymer has a molecular<br>
weight (Mn) in the range of 3000 to 22000 g/mol, preferably in the range of 3000 to<br>
15000 g/mol.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the plasticizing effect may be<br>
improved, when lowering the molecular weight. A molecular weight somewhat close<br>
to the molecular weight of conventional synthetic resins may be preferred.<br>
In an embodiment of the inventionj said biodegradable polymer is a polyester.<br>
t<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polyester polymer is<br>
obtainable by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic monomers.<br>
According to an embodiment of thε- invention, an advantageous biodegradable<br>
polyester polymer may be obtained based on cyclic monomers.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said cyclic monomers are selected from the<br>
group of cyclic esters and cyclic carbonates.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the biodegradable polyester polymer obtained<br>
from cyclic esters and/or cyclic carbonates may provide a chewing gum according to<br>
the invention with preferred properties with regard to texture and degradability.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said cyclic monomers are selected from the<br>
group of D,L-lactide, L-lactide, glycolide, s-caprolactone, δ-valerolactone,<br>
trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and dioxanone.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, at least one of said cyclic monomers is a high-<br>
Tg-inducing monomer.<br>
In the present text the terms "high-Tg-inducing monomer" and "low-Tg-inducing<br>
monomer" refer to monomers, which when polymerized alone or in their respective<br>
groups result in polymers of high- and low Tg, respectively. Herein the resulting<br>
polymers of high- and low-Tg may be understood as polymers having a molecular<br>
weight of at least 500 Mn. In other words, the terms high- and low-Tg-inducing<br>
monomers are used for monomers, which, when polymerized to polymers of at least<br>
500 Mn, may preferably lead to either high or low Tg of the polymer. Herein a high<br>
Tg is defined as a Tg above mouth temperature and a low Tg is correspondingly<br>
defined as a Tg below mouth temperature.<br>
The chewing gum elastomer plasticizer polymer, also referred to as biodegradable<br>
resin according to the present invention may sometimes in the present text be<br>
referred to as 'polyester resin' when it is intended to refer to the polymer as being a<br>
polyester with resin-like properties. •':.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention the polyester resin comprises monomer units<br>
originating from one or more sorts of high-Tg-inducing monomers such as lactide or<br>
glycolide forming a homo-polymer or a co-polymer with high Tg.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the high-Tg-inducing monomers may be chosen<br>
among D,L-lactide, L-lactide, and glycolide.<br>
The observed and desired effect of applying at least one high-Tg-inducing monomer<br>
may be to obtain a chewing gum polymer, which is harder and less elastic than usual<br>
chewing gum polymers. Such polymer has been observed to imply a pleasing texture<br>
in the final chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyester is a polymer obtainable by the<br>
polymerization of one single type of high-Tg-inducing monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the biodegradable polyester polymer is a homo-<br>
polymer based on one type of high-Tg-inducing monomers only. Preferred polymers<br>
of this type may be poly(lactide) or poly(glycolide).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyester is a copolymer obtainable by the<br>
polymerization of at least two different high-Tg-inducing monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention,' a co-polymer such as a poly(d,l-lactidε-co-<br>
glycolide) may be applied as the high-Tg-biodegradable polymer in a chewing gum<br>
according to the present invention. A purpose of introducing a co-polymer may be<br>
that such co-polymer may be more amorphous and less crystalline than a homo-<br>
polymer, and that these features may contribute further to the advantageous texture<br>
properties of the final chewing gum.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyester is a copolymer obtainable by the<br>
polymerization of at least one low-Tg-inducing monomer with at least one high-Tg-<br>
inducing monomer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a small percentage of low-Tg-inducing monomers<br>
is introduced in the polymer chain to control the Tg of the resulting copolymer.<br>
While keeping the Tg above 38 °C according to the present invention, the texture of<br>
the polymer may according to a preferred embodiment of the invention be adjusted<br>
by regulating the percentage of low-Tg-inducing monomers in the copolymer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a high Tg of the biodegradable resin polymer has<br>
improved effect as resinous compound, thereby lowering the necessary amount of<br>
resin in order to plasticize the elastomer part of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the structure of the high-Tg-biodegradable<br>
polymer may be tuned by the balance between high- and low-Tg-inducing monomers<br>
in the co-polymer to provide a polymer with elastoplastic and considerably amorph<br>
properties. Hereby, a preferred quality of the final chewing gum according to the<br>
invention may be achieved.<br>
A polymer having elastoplastic properties may comprise both elastomeric and<br>
resinous properties and act as elastomer at lower temperatures and as resin<br>
(elastomer plasticizer) at higher temperatures.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention,- the molar ratio of the at least one high-Tg-<br>
inducing monomer to the at least one low-Tg-inducing monomer is in the range of<br>
75/25 to 99/1, preferably in the range of 85/15 to 99/1.<br>
An advantage of such ratio between low and high Tg-inducing monomers is that<br>
improved elastoplastic features may be obtained.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of the at least one high-Tg-<br>
inducing monomer to the at least one low-Tg-inducing monomer is in the range of<br>
90/10 to 99/1, preferably in the range of 95/5 to 99/1.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of the at least one high-Tg-<br>
inducing monomer to the at least one low-Tg-inducing monomer is in the range of<br>
95/5 to 98/2.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one high-Tg-inducing monomer is<br>
selected from the group of monomers comprising D,L-lactide, L-lactide and<br>
glycolide.<br>
When these monomer units constitute a relatively large part of the polymer an<br>
advantage may be obtained with regard to the degradation products. When the goal is<br>
to obtain a biodegradable chewing gum, it may provide a significant contribution to<br>
the usefulness of the chewing gum that the monomer- or oligomer-degradation<br>
products are desirable in the environment. This is what may be obtained by the<br>
present invention, as the fraction of lactic acid, glycolic acid etc. as degradation<br>
products may be increased compared to the degradation products of prior art<br>
biodegradable chewing gum polymers, wherein low-Tg-inducing monomers such as<br>
e.g. lactones are often used in higher percentages.<br>
The application of these high-Tg-inducing monomers in the biodegradable resin in<br>
the chewing gum of the present invention generally involves some important<br>
advantages as regards fast rate of degradability with favorable and non-toxic<br>
degradation products. In addition hereto, these monomer compounds may be<br>
purchased at low cost<br><br>
By increasing the percentage of high-Tg-inducing monomers in the polymer, the Tg<br>
of the resulting polymer is raised, and experiments have shown that it is actually<br>
possible to obtain desired chewing gum characteristics, when applying such hard and<br>
inelastic polymers in chewing gum in combination with an elastomeric compound.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one low-Tg-inducing monomer is<br>
selected from the group of monomers comprising s-caprolactone, δ-valerolactone,<br>
trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and dioxanone.<br>
As regards polymers made at least partly from these monomers, they may represent<br>
some ambiguity with regard to degradation rate. Certainly, they degrade with a much<br>
more rapid rate than conventional chewing gum polymers such as PVA or natural<br>
resins. However, when compared to high-Tg-polymers such as poly(d,l-lactide), they<br>
may be observed to degrade at a slower rate. Hence, when taking degradability<br>
aspects into account, the amount of high-Tg-inducing monomers may<br>
advantageously be increased. <br>
In an embodiment of the invention, ε-caprolactone may be preferred over δ-<br>
valerolactone because of cost considerations.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention; said ring-opening polymerization is initiated by<br>
one or more initiators.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said initiators comprise about 0.01 to 1.0 % by<br>
weight of said biodegradable polyester polymer.<br>
In an embodiment of the ihvention at least 50 mol %, preferably at least 70 mol % of<br>
said initiators are difunctional.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the mol percentage of difunctional initiators may<br>
be used to control the linearity of the biodegradable polymer. If both difunctional and<br>
higher functional initiators are used, an increase in the mol percentage of difunctional<br>
initiators may increase the linearity, while an increase in the higher functional<br>
initiators may induce more branching in the polymer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, an advantageous robustness and texture of the<br>
chewing gum may be obtained, when the relatively low molecular weight<br>
biodegradable polyester polymer of high Tg obtains a high degree of linearity and<br>
crystallinity. Excellent properties as biodegradable resin in the chewing gum may<br>
hereby be obtained.<br>
Thus, the excellent resinous properties may be derived from the fact that especially a<br>
biodegradable polymer with glass transition temperature above mouth temperature<br>
may gain fine elastomer plasticizing properties, when somewhat crystalline and<br>
linear regions are introduced therein.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a preferred group of difunctional initiators may<br>
be diol initiators such as e.g. 1,2 -propane diol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyester polymer is substantially linear.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a high linearity may be associated with an<br>
improved elastomer plasticizing function of the high-Tg-biodegradable polymer.<br>
Furthermore, a higher linearity may also imply a higher crystallinity, which in an<br>
embodiment of the invention may entail that a smaller amount of biodegradable resin<br>
polymer is needed in order to obtahvthe desired texture of the final chewing gum<br>
according to the present invention.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said substantially linear polyester polymer<br>
comprises above 50 percent linear polymer chains.<br>
Accordingly, in an embodiment of the invention, a high percentage linearity of the<br>
biodegradable polymer of the invention, may contribute to a high robustness and<br>
pleasant texture of the chewing gum.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said substantially linear polyester polymer<br>
comprises above 70 percent linear polymer chains.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said substantially linear polyester polymer<br>
comprises above 80 percent linear polymer chains.<br>
Hereby, in an embodiment of the invention, a further improvement may be obtained<br>
with regard to elastomer plasticizer function of the high-Tg biodegradable polyester<br>
polymer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable polyester polymer is<br>
obtainable by condensation polymerization of polyfunctional acids or derivatives<br>
thereof and/or polyfunctional alcohols or derivatives thereof.<br>
Examples of poly condensation methods of producing polymers from carboxylic<br>
acids have been disclosed in US 5,310,865 and US 4,273,920.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyfunctional acids are selected from the<br>
group of lactic acids and glycolic acids.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said polyfunctional acids are<br>
polyhydroxycarboxylic acids or hydroxycarboxylic acids.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said chewing gum comprises an elastomeric<br>
compound in an amount of at least 5 %, preferably at least 10 % by weight of the<br>
chewing gum.<br>
The amount of elastomeric compound depends on the actually applied elastomer and<br>
resin. It has been found that a nice texture of the chewing gum according to the<br>
invention may be obtained, when the high-Tg biodegradable resin is combined with<br>
an elastomeric compound in a gum base, which is introduced into a standard chewing<br>
gum formulation.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said at least one elastomeric compound is a<br>
biodegradable elastomer.<br>
In order to obtain a highly degradable chewing gum, it may be preferred that both the<br>
resinous and the elastomeric parts of the chewing gum are biodegradable.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said biodegradable elastomer is obtainable by the<br>
polymerization of at least' one alcohol or derivative thereof and at least one<br>
carboxylic acid or derivative thereof. <br>
Useful elastomers of this kind may be prepared from a large number of different<br>
monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention an advantageous elastomer polymer may be<br>
prepared from dimethyl terephthalate, dimethyl adipate, and di(ethylene glycol).<br>
Further examples within the scope of the invention include polymers, which may<br>
generally be prepared by step-growth polymerization of di-, tri- or higher-functional<br>
alcohols or esters thereof with di-, tri- or higher-functional aliphatic or aromatic<br>
carboxylic acids or esters thereof. Likewise, also hydroxy acids or anhydrides and<br>
halides of polyfunctional carboxylic acids may be used as monomers. The<br><br>
polymerization may involve direct polyesterification or transesterification and may<br>
be catalyzed.<br>
In another embodiment, useful elastomer compounds may include polyester<br>
polymers obtained by the polymerization of one or more cyclic esters such as lactide,<br>
glycolide, trimethylene carbonate, δ-valerolactone, β-propiolactone and ε-<br>
caprolactone.<br>
Regardless of the monomer composition, the molecular weight of the elastomeric<br>
compound may be considerably higher than the molecular weight of the resinous<br>
high-Tg biodegradable polymer according to the present invention. Likewise, the<br>
glass transition temperature may be much lower for the elastomer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the water content is less than 3 %, preferably less<br>
than 1.5 %, and most preferably less than 1 % by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
In some of the most preferred embodiments of the present invention, a low water<br>
content in the final chewing gum is of great importance because of the chewing gum<br>
content of highly degradable polymers such as poly(lactide). When applying such<br>
polymers being particularly susceptible to hydrolytical degradation, a low water<br>
content may according to the present invention be a crucial factor to avoid or at least<br>
minimize prε-chewing degradation, which is very undesired in the chewing gum.<br>
Keeping the water content in the chewing gum low may increase the keeping<br>
qualities of the final chewing gum product considerably, and the period of storage<br>
before use may be prolonged without compromising the chewing gum taste,<br>
appearance and quality.<br>
Thus, due to the large content of particularly degradable polymers in the chewing<br>
gum of the present invention, it is a general goal to keep to water content as low as<br>
possible.<br><br>
The chewing gum of the present invention may be manufactured by several different<br>
processes such as a batch process, by extrusion, by a onε-step process, etc..<br>
The shape of the resulting chewing gum tablet may be any manufacturable<br>
geometrical shape, such as round, oval, flattened, stick, etc. The tablet may also be<br>
multi-modular, e.g. center-filled.<br>
The chewing gum according to the invention may also be made by means of<br>
compression, as a compressed multi-modular table, etc.<br>

chewing gum ingredients selected from the group comprising flavoring agents,<br>
sweetening agents, fillers, softeners, emulsifiers, and active ingredients.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, said flavoring agents comprise natural and<br>

in an amount of about 0 to about 20 % by weight of the chewing gum, more typically<br>
about 0 to about 10 % by weight of the chewing gum.<br>
According to the present invention, it has been found that softener may<br>
advantageously be added to the chewing gum of the present invention in an amount<br><br>
corresponding to the amount used in conventional chewing gum. According to the<br>
present invention, a satisfactory texture of a chewing gum comprising a resinous<br>
compound of high Tg may be obtained, even when the amount of added softener is<br>
rather low, that is below 10 % or even below 5 % by weight of the chewing gum.<br>

% by weight of the chewing gum.<br>

either with or without emulsifier.<br>

thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
According to a preferred definition of biodegradability according to the invention,<br>
biodegradability is a property of certain organic molecules whereby, when exposed<br>
to the natural environment or placed within a living organism, they react through an<br>
enzymatic or microbial process, often in combination with a chemical process such<br>
as hydrolysis, to form simpler compounds, and ultimately carbon dioxide, nitrogen<br>
oxides, methane, water and the like.<br>
In the present context the term 'biodegradable polymers' means environmentally or<br>
biologically degradable polymer compounds and refers to chewing gum base<br>
components which, after dumping the chewing gum, are capable of undergoing a<br>
physical, chemical and/or biological degradation, whereby the dumped chewing gum<br>
waste becomes more readily removable from the site of dumping or is eventually<br>
disintegrated to lumps or particles, which are no longer recognizable as being<br>
chewing gum remnants. The degradation or disintegration of such degradable poly-<br>
mers may be effected or induced by physical factors such as temperature, light,<br>
moisture, etc., by chemical factors such as oxidative conditions, pH, hydrolysis, etc.<br>
or by biological factors such as microorganisms and/or enzymes. The degradation<br>
products may be larger oligomers, trimers, dimers and monomers.<br>
Preferably, the ultimate degradation products are small inorganic compounds such as<br>
carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, ammonia, water, etc.<br>
As referred to herein, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is be determined by for<br>
example DSC (DSC: differential scanning calorimetry). The DSC may generally be<br><br>
applied for determining and studying of the thermal transitions of a polymer and<br>
specifically, the technique may be applied for the determination of a second order<br>
transition of a material. The transition at Tg is regarded as such a second order<br>
transition, i.e. a thermal transition that involves a change in heat capacity, but does<br>
not have a latent heat. Hence, DSC may be applied for studying Tg. Unless otherwise<br>
stated the heating rate used is 10°C/min throughout the application.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein with regard to polymers, the term<br>
"molecular weight" means number average molecular weight (Ma) in g/mol.<br>
Furthermore, as used herein the short form PD designates the polydispersity of<br>
polymers, polydispersity being defined as Mw /Mn, where Mw is the weight average<br>
molecular weight of a polymer. A well-established technique for characterization of<br>
biodegradable polymers is gel permeation chromatography (GPC).<br>
In the present text, it is assumed that the temperature in the mouth of the chewing<br>
gum consumer is about human body temperature, although it may in praxis during<br>
chewing be a few degrees below'body temperature. A glass transition temperature<br>
above mouth temperature is herein referred to as a high Tg, whereas a Tg below<br>
mouth temperature is herein referred to as a low Tg.<br>
Chewing gum of the present invention typically comprises a water-soluble bulk<br>
portion, a water-insoluble chewable gum base portion and flavoring agents. The<br>
water-soluble portion dissipates with a portion of the flavoring agent over a period of<br>
time during chewing. The gum base portion is retained in the mouth throughout the<br>
chew. The term chewing gum refers to both a chewing and bubble type gum in its<br>
general sense.<br>
The gum base is the masticatory substance of the chewing gum, which imparts the<br>
chew characteristics to the final product. The gum base typically defines the release<br>
profile of flavors and sweeteners and plays a significant role in the gum product.<br><br>
The insoluble portion of the gum typically may contain any combination of<br>
elastomers, vinyl polymers, elastomer plasticizers, waxes, softeners, fillers and other<br>
optional ingredients such as colorants and antioxidants.<br>
The composition of gum base formulations can vary substantially depending on the<br>
particular product to be prepared and on the desired masticatory and other sensory<br>
characteristics of the final product However, typical ranges (% by weight) of the<br>
above gum base components are: 5 to 80% by weight elastomeric compounds, 5 to<br>
80% by weight elastomer plasticizers, 0 to 40% by weight of waxes, 5 to 35% by<br>
weight softener, 0 to 50% by weight filler, and 0 to 5% by weight of miscellaneous<br>
ingredients such as antioxidants, colorants, etc. The gum base may comprise about 5<br>
to about 95 percent, by weight, of the chewing gum, more commonly, the gum base<br>
comprises 10 to about 60 percent of the gum.<br>
Elastomers provide the rubbery, cohesive nature to the gum, which varies depending<br>
on this ingredient's chemical structure and how it may be compounded with other<br>
ingredients. Elastomers suitable for use in the gum base and gum of the present<br>
invention may include natural or synthetic types.<br>
Elastomer plasticizers vary the firmness of the gum base. Their specificity on<br>
elastomer inter-molecular chain breaking (plasticizing) along with their varying<br>
softening points cause varying degrees' of finished gum firmness and compatibility<br>
when used in base. This may be important when one wants to provide more<br>
elastomeric chain exposure to the'alkanic chains of the waxes.<br>
The elastomer compounds may be of natural origin but are preferably of synthetic<br>
origin, preferably synthetic polyesters: According to the invention, the resin<br>
compounds are preferably biodegradable polymers, and in preferred embodiments,<br><br>
the resin compounds are biodegradable synthetic polyesters. Natural resins of any<br>
kind are avoided in the chewing gum of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, the chewing gum comprises at least one<br>
biodegradable polymer having a high Tg being above 37°C. Furthermore, according<br>
to the present invention, these biodegradable polymers are very suitable as resinous<br>
compounds in the chewing gum of the present invention. Here below a series of<br>
examples of monomer compositions are given, which in tuned molar ratios may be<br>
applied for the high-Tg biodegradable polymer, which is part of the chewing gum of<br>
the present invention.<br>
According to different embodiments of the invention, a high-Tg biodegradable<br>
polymer may comprise at least one of the high-Tg-inducing monomers chosen<br>
among lactides or glycolides and possibly one or more low-Tg-inducing monomers<br>
chosen among lactones and cyclic carbpnates.<br>
The lactone monomers ■ may be selected from the group of δ-caprolactone, δ-<br>
valerolactone, y-butyrolactbne, and β-propiolactone, also including s-caprolactones,<br>
5-valerolactones, y-butyrolactones, or p-propiolactones that have been substituted<br>
with one or more alkyl or aryl substituents at any non-carbonyl carbon atoms along<br>
the ring. The carbonate monomers may be chosen from the group of trimethylene<br>
carbonate, 5-alkyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one,' •5,5-dialkyl-l53-dioxan-2-one, or 5-alkyl-5-<br>

propylene carbonate, trimethylolpropane monocarbonate, 4, 6dimethyl-l, 3-<br>
propylene carbonate, 2,2-dimethyl trimethylene carbonate, and 1,3-dioxepan-2-one.<br>
According to the present invention, some preferred monomers are cyclic monomers<br>
such as D,L-lactide, L-lactide, and'glycolide, which are high-Tg-inducing, and ε-<br>
caprolactone, 5-valerolactone, trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and dioxanone, which<br>
are low-Tg-inducing.<br><br>
In order to obtain the desired high Tg, either homo-polymers or co-polymers of high-<br>
Tg-inducing monomers alone are used, or a combination of high- and low-Tg<br>
inducing monomers are used, wherein it is important that the ratio between high-Tg<br>
inducing monomers and low-Tg inducing monomers is controlled.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, some examples of homo-polymers or<br>
co-polymers of high-Tg-inducing monomers may include the following: poly(L-<br>
lactide); poly(D-lactide); poly(D, L-lactide); poly(mesoIactide); poly(glycolide);<br>
poly(L-lactidε-co-D, L-lactide); poly(L-lactidε-co-meso-lactide); poly(L-lactidε-co-<br>
glycolide); poly(D, L-lactidε-co-meso-lactide); poly(D, L-lactidε-co-glycolide);<br>
poly(mesolactidε-co-glycolide), etc..<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, one or more high-Tg-inducing<br>
monomers and one or more low-Tg-inducing monomers may be polymerized<br>
together, the molar ratio of high/low being in the range of 75/25 to 99/1, preferably<br>
in the range of 85/15 to 99/1, and typically in the range of 95/5 to 99/1. In other<br>
words, the mol percentage of high-Tg-inducing monomers is at least 75%, preferably<br>
at least 85%, and typically at least 95% of the total mol number of monomers<br>
forming the resulting polymer. While maintaining these ratios, preferred<br>

The polymerization of monomers according to the above compositions may<br>
according to the invention lead to some very degradable high-Tg polymers, which<br>
are suitable as resinous compounds in the chewing gum of the present invention.<br>
A few examples of the resulting high-Tg biodegradable polymers may include<br>
poly (L-lactidε-co-trimethylenecarbonate); poly (L-lactidε-co-epsilon-caprolactone);<br>
poly (D, L-lactidε-co-trimethylenecarbonate); poly (D, L-lactidε-co-epsilon-<br>

According to an embodiment of the invention, the polymerization process to obtain<br>
the biodegradable polymer, which is applied in the chewing gum of the present<br>
invention, may be initiated by an initiator-such as a polyfunctional alcohol, amine or<br>
other molecules or compounds with multiple hydroxyl or other reactive groups or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, examples of suitable multifunctional<br>
initiators include but arε-not limited to glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol,<br>

other di-functional compounds capable of initiating a ring-opening polymerization.<br>
Furthermore, according to the invention, the initiator may comprise in the range of<br>
0.01 to 1.0, preferably 0.05 to 0.8 weight % of the high-Tg biodegradable polyester<br>
polymer, which may be applied in the chewing gum of the present invention.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the fraction of initiators in the biode-<br>
gradable polymer being difunctional or higher functional may be regulated, whereby<br>
the degree of linearity and branching may be controlled.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the difunctional initiators comprise at least 50<br>
mol % of the total content of initiator molecules applied. Hereby, a considerable<br>
linearity may be introduced in thε-biodegradable polymer according to the present<br>
invention, and a certain desired' crystallinity may be obtained. Hereby, the<br>
biodegradable polyester polymer may gain very suitable properties as elastomer<br>
plasticizer, and hence an advantageous biodegradable resin may be provided in the<br>
chewing gum of the present invention. To increase the linearity to improve the<br>
crystallinity, plasticizing properties and robustness of the chewing gum in an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the content of difunctional initiators may be raised to<br>
e.g. 60%, 70%, 80%, '90%; or about 100% of the total content of moles initiator<br>
molecules applied.<br>
Accordingly, a substantially linear polyester polymer may according to an embodi-<br>
ment of the invention comprise above e.g. 50 or 80 percent linear polymer chains.<br><br>
The biodegradable bigh-Tg resinous polymers of the present invention are preferably<br>
obtainable by ring-opening polymerization. However, the method of production is<br>
not limiting for the scope of the present invention. As an example, ring-opening<br>
polymerization of lactide is more commonly used as production method than<br>
polycondensatibn of lactic acid (e.g. a-hydroxypropionic acid). This, however, is<br>
mainly a matter of process conditions and ease of production. As concerns the<br>
resulting polymers, they may be provided with substantially the same composition<br>
and properties and being equally applicable in chewing gum according to the present<br>
invention. The naming of such polymers is often regarded inter-changeable, thus the<br>
names poly(lactide) and poly (lactic acid) may be used for the same polymer.<br>
Generally, the biodegradable polymers used in the chewing gum of the present<br>
invention may be homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers, including graft- and<br>
block-polymers.<br>
Useful polymers, which may be applied as elastomers in the chewing gum of the<br>
present invention, may generally be prepared by step-growth polymerization of di-,<br>
tri- or higher-functional alcohols or esters thereof with di-, tri- or higher-functional<br>
aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids or esters thereof. Likewise, also hydroxy acids<br>
or anhydrides and halides of polyfunctional carboxylic acids may be used as<br>
monomers. The polymerization may involve direct polyesterification or<br>
transesterification and may be catalyzed.<br>
Because polyfunctional carboxylic acids in general are high-melting solids that have<br>
very limited solubility in the polycondensation reaction medium, esters or anhydrides<br>
of the polyfunctional carboxylic acids are often used to overcome this limitation.<br>
Furthermore, polycondensations involving carboxylic acids or anhydrides produce<br>
water as the condensate, which requires high temperatures to be driven off. Thus,<br>
polycondensations involving transesterification of the ester of a polyfunctional acid<br>
are often the preferred process. For example, the dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid<br><br>
may be used instead of terephthalic acid itself. In this case, methanol rather than<br>
water is condensed, and the former can be driven off more easily than water. Usually,<br>
the reaction is carried out in the bulk (no solvent) and high temperatures and vacuum<br>
are used to remove the by-product and drive the reaction to completion.<br>
Specific examples of aliphatic polyfunctional carboxylic acids, which may be useful<br>
in the preparation of an elastomer applied in the chewing gum of the present<br>
invention, include oxalic, malonic, citric, succinic, malic, tartaric, fumaric, maleic,<br>
glutaric, glutamic, adipic, glucaric, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanedioic<br>
acid, etc. Likewise, specific examples of aromatic polyfunctional carboxylic acids<br>
may be terephthalic, isophthalic, phthalic, trimellitic, pyromellitic and naphthalene<br>
1,4-, 2,3-, 2,6-dicarboxylic acids and the like.<br>
For the purpose of illustration and not limitation, some examples of carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives, which may be used for preparation of the elastomer used in the chewing<br>
gum of the present invention, include hydroxy acids such as 3-hydroxy propionic<br>
acid and 6-hydroxycaproicacid and anhydrides, halides or esters of acids, for<br>
example dimethyl or diethyl esters, corresponding to the already mentioned acids,<br>
which means esters such as dimethyl or diethyl oxalate, malonate, succinate,<br>
fumarate, maleate, glutarate, adipate, pimelate, suberate, azelate, sebacate,<br>
dodecanedioate, terephthalate, isophthalate, phthalate, etc. Generally speaking,<br>
methyl esters are sometimes more preferred than ethyl esters due to the fact that<br>
higher boiling alcohols are more difficult to remove than lower boiling alcohols.<br>
The usually preferred polyfunctional alcohols contain 2 to 100 carbon atoms as for<br>
instance polyglycols and polyglycerols. •<br>
In the polymerization of an: elastomer for usε-in the chewing gum of the present<br>
invention, some applicable examples of alcohpls, which may be employed as such or<br>
as derivatives thereof, include polyols such as ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-<br>
propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanedioI, 1,6-hexanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-<br><br>
cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol, glycerol,<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, etc.<br>
Generally, the elastomer polymers used in the chewing gum of the present invention<br>
may be homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers, including graft- and block-<br>
polymers.<br>
Further suitable examples of additional environmentally or biologically degradable<br>
chewing gum base polymers, which may be applied in accordance with the gum base<br>
of the present invention, include degradable polyesters, polycarbonates, polyester<br>
amides, polypeptides, homopolymers of amino acids such as polylysine, and proteins<br>
including derivatives hereof such as e.g. protein hydrolysates including a zein<br>
hydrolysate.<br>
In accordance with the general principles in manufacturing a chewing gum within the<br>
scope of the invention, variations of different suitable ingredients are listed and<br>
explained below.<br>
The chewing gum according to the invention may comprise coloring agents.<br>

and preservatives.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises softeners in an<br>
amount of about 0 to about 18% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically about<br>
0 to about 12% by weight of the chewing gum.<br><br>
Softeners/emulsifiers may according to the invention be added both in the chewing<br>
gum and the gum base.<br>
A gum base formulation may, in accordance with the present invention, comprise<br>
one or more softening agents e.g. sucrose esters including those disclosed in<br>
WO 00/25598, which is incorporated herein by reference, tallow, hydrogenated<br>
tallow, hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, cocoa butter,<br>
degreased cocoa powder, glycerol monostearate, glyceryl triacetate, lecithin, mono-,<br>
di- and triglycerides, acetylated monoglycerides, fatty acids (e.g. stearic, palmitic,<br>
oleic and linoleic acids) and combinations thereof. As used herein the term "softener"<br>
designates an ingredient, which softens the gum base or chewing gum formulation<br>
and encompasses waxes, fats, oils, emulsifiers, surfactants and solubilisers.<br>
To soften the gum base further and to provide it with water-binding properties, which<br>
confer to the gum base a pleasant smooth surface and reduce its adhesive properties,<br>
one or more emulsifiers is/are usually added to the composition, typically in an<br>
amount of 0 to 18% by weight, preferably 0 to 12% by weight of the gum base.<br>
Mono- and diglycerides of edible fatty acids, lactic acid esters and acetic acid esters<br>
of mono- and diglycerides of edible fatty acids, acetylated mono and diglycerides,<br>
sugar esters of edible fatty acids, Na-, K-, Mg- and Ca-stearates, lecithin,<br>
hydroxylated lecithin and the like are examples of conventionally used emulsifiers<br>
which can be added to the chewing gum base. In case of the presence of a<br>
biologically or pharmaceutically active ingredient as defined below, the formulation<br>
may comprise certain specific emulsifiers'and/or solubilisers in order to disperse and<br>
release the active ingredient.<br>
Waxes and fats are conventionally used for the adjustment of the consistency and for<br>
softening of the chewing gum base when preparing chewing gum bases. In<br>
connection with the present invention, any conventionally used and suitable type of<br><br>
wax and fat may be used, such as for instance rice bran wax, polyethylene wax,<br>
petroleum wax (refined paraffin and microcrystalline wax), paraffin, beeswax,<br>
carnauba wax, candelilla wax, cocoa butter, degreased cocoa powder and any<br>
suitable oil or fat, as e.g. .completely or partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or<br>
completely or partially hydrogenated animal fats.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the chewing gum comprises filler.<br>
A chewing gum base formulation may, if desired, include one or more<br>
fillers/texturisers including as examples, magnesium and calcium carbonate, sodium<br>
sulphate, ground limestone, silicate compounds such as magnesium and aluminum<br>
silicate, kaolin and clay, aluminum oxide, silicium oxide, talc, titanium oxide,<br>
mono-, di- and tri-calcium phosphates, cellulose polymers, such as wood, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention* the chewing gum comprises filler in an amount<br>
of about 0 to about 50% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically about 10 to<br>
about 40% by weight of the chewing-gum'.<br>
In addition to a water insoluble gum base portion, a typical chewing gum includes a<br>
water soluble bulk portion and one or more flavoring agents. The water-soluble<br>
portion may include bulk sweeteners, high intensity sweeteners, flavoring agents,<br>
softeners, emulsifiers, colors, acidiilants, fillers, antioxidants, and other components<br>
that provide desired attributes:<br>
Suitable bulk sweeteners include both sugar and non-sugar sweetening components.<br>
Bulk sweeteners typically constitute from about 5 to about 95% by weight of the<br>
chewing gum, more typically about 20 to about 80% by weight such as 30 to 60% by<br>
weight of the gum.<br><br>
Useful sugar sweeteners are saccharidε-containing components commonly known in<br>
the chewing gum art including, but not limited to, sucrose, dextrose, maltose,<br>
dextrins, trehalose, D-tagatose, dried invert sugar, fructose, levulose, galactose, corn<br>
syrup solids, and the like, alone or in combination.<br>
Sorbitol can be used as a non-sugar sweetener. Other useful non-sugar sweeteners in-<br>
clude, but are not limited to, other sugar alcohols such as mannitol, xylitol,<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, maltitol, isomaltol, erythritol, lactitol and the like,<br>
alone or in combination.<br>
High-intensity artificial sweetening agents can also be used alone or in combination<br>
with the above sweeteners. Preferred high-intensity sweeteners include, but are not<br>
limited to sucralose, aspartame, salts of acesulfame, alitame, neotame, twinsweet,<br>
saccharin and its salts, cyclamic acid and its salts, glycyrrhizin, dihydrochalcones,<br>
thaumatin, monellin, stevioside and the like, alone or in combination. In order to<br>
provide longer lasting sweetness and flavor perception, it may be desirable to<br>
encapsulate or otherwise control the release of at least a portion of the artificial<br>
sweetener. Techniques such as wet granulation, wax granulation, spray drying, spray<br>
chilling, fluid bed coating, coascervation, encapsulation in yeast cells and fiber<br>
extrusion may be used to achieve the desired release characteristics. Encapsulation of<br>
sweetening agents can also be provided using another chewing gum component such<br>
as a resinous compound.<br>
Usage level of the high intensity artificial sweetener will vary considerably and will<br>
depend on factors such as potency of the sweetener, rate of release, desired sweetness<br>
of the product, level and type of flavor used and cost considerations. Thus, the active<br>
level of high potency artificial sweetener may vary from about 0 to about 8 % by<br>
weight, preferably 0.001 to about 5 % by weight. When carriers used for encapsu-<br>
lation are included, the usage level of the encapsulated sweetener will be<br>
proportionately higher.<br><br>
Combinations of sugar and/or non-sugar sweeteners can be used in the chewing gum<br>
formulation processed in accordance with the invention. Additionally, the softener<br>
may also provide additional sweetness such as aqueous sugar or alditol solutions.<br>
If a low-calorie gum is desired, a low-caloric bulking agent can be used. Examples of<br>
low caloric bulking agents include polydextrose, Raftilose, Raftilin,<br>
fructooligosaccharides (NutraFlora®), palatinose oligosaccharides; guar gum<br>
hydrolysates (e.g. Sun Fiber®) or indigestible dextrins (e.g. Fibersol®). However,<br>
other low-calorie bulking agents can be used.<br>

size may be less than 3 mm, less than 2 mm or more preferred less than 1 mm, calcu-<br>
lated as the longest dimension of the particle. The natural flavoring agent may in a<br>
form where the particle size is from' about 3 fim to 2 mm, such as from 4 \im to 1<br><br>
mm. Preferred natural flavoring agents include seeds from fruit e.g. from strawberry,<br>
blackberry and raspberry.<br>
Various synthetic flavors, such as mixed fruit flavors may also be used in the present<br>
chewing gum centers. As indicated above, the aroma agent may be used in quantities<br>
smaller than those conventionally used. The aroma agents and/or flavors may be used<br>
in the amount from 0.01 to about 30% by weight of the final product depending on<br>
the desired intensity of the aroma and/or flavor used. Preferably, the content of<br>
aroma/flavor is in the range of 0.2 to 3% by weight of the total composition.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the flavoring agents comprise natural and<br>
synthetic flavorings in the form of natural vegetable components, essential oils,<br>
essences, extracts, powders, including acids and other substances capable of affecting<br>
the taste profile.<br>
Further chewing gum ingredients, which may be included in the chewing gum<br>
according to the present invention, include surfactants and/or solubilisers, especially<br>

Generally, it is preferred that the chewing gum and the gum bases prepared<br>
according to the invention are based solely on biodegradable polymers.<br>
However, within the scope of the invention, minor amounts of conventional synthetic<br>
chewing gum elastomers or elastomer plasticizers, examples of which are mentioned<br>
below, may be applied.'<br>
Examples of such generally non-biodegradable synthetic resins include polyvinyl<br>

permeation chromatography (GPC) average molecular weight in the range of about<br>
10,000 to 1,000,000 including the range of 50,000 to 80,000, isobutylenε-isoprene<br>
copolymer (butyl elastomer), styrenε-butadiene copolymers e.g. having styrenε-<br>
butadiene ratios of about 1:3 to 3:1, polyvinyl acetate (PVA), e.g. having a GPC<br>
average molecular weight in the range of 2,000 to 90,000 such as the range of 3,000<br>

and combinations hereof.<br>
It is common in the industry to combine in a gum base a synthetic elastomer having a<br>
high molecular weight and a synthetic elastomer having a low molecular weight.<br>
Examples of such combinations of are polyisobutylene and styrenε-butadiene,<br>
polyisobutylene and polyisoprene, polyisobutylene and isobutylenε-isoprene co-<br>
polymer (butyl rubber) and a combination of polyisobutylene, styrenε-butadiene<br>
copolymer and isobutylene isoprene copolymer, and all of the above individual<br>
synthetic polymers in admixture with polyvinyl acetate, vinyl acetatε-vinyl laurate<br>
copolymers, respectively and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of natural resins, which should preferably not be applied in the chewing<br>
gum according to the present invention are: Natural rosin esters, often referred to as<br>
ester gums including as examples glycerol esters of partially hydrogenated rosins,<br>

alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and/or d-limonene, and natural terpene resins.<br>
In general, chewing gum may be manufactured by sequentially adding the various<br>
chewing gum ingredients to a commercially available mixer known in the art. After<br>
the initial ingredients have been thoroughly mixed, the chewing gum mass is<br>
discharged from the mixer and shaped into the desired form such as by rolling into<br>
sheets and cutting into sticks, extruded into chunks or casting into pellets.<br>
Generally, the ingredients may be mixed by first melting the gum base and adding it<br>
to the running mixer. Colors, active agents and/or emulsifiers may also be added at<br>
this time. A softener such as glycerin, may also be added at this time, along with<br><br>
syrup and a portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. Further portions of the bulking<br>
agent/sweetener may then be added to the mixer. A flavoring agent is typically added<br>
with the final portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. A high-intensity sweetener is<br>
preferably added after the final portion of bulking agent and flavor has been added.<br>
The entire mixing procedure typically takes from five to fifteen minutes, but longer<br>
mixing times may sometimes be required. Those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
many variations of the above described procedure may be followed. Including the<br>
onε-step method described in US patent application 2004/0115305 hereby<br>
incorporated as reference. Chewing gums are formed by extrusion, compression,<br>
rolling and may be centre filled with liquids and/or solids in any form.<br>
The chewing gum according to the present invention may also be provided with an<br>
outer coating, which may be a hard coating, a soft coating, a film coating, or a<br>
coating of any type that is known in the art, or a combination of such coatings. The<br>
coating may typically constitute 0.1 to 75 percent by weight of a coated chewing<br>
gum piece.<br>
One preferred outer coating type is a hard coating, which term is including sugar<br>
coatings and sugar-free (or sugarless) coatings and combinations thereof The object<br>
of hard coating is to obtain a sweet, crunchy layer, which is appreciated by the<br>
consumer and to protect the gum centers. In a typical process of providing the<br>
chewing gum centers with a protective sugar coating the gum centers are<br>
successively treated in suitable coating equipment with aqueous solutions of<br>
crystallizable sugar such as sucrose or dextrose, which, depending on the stage of<br>
coating reached, may contain other functional ingredients, e.g. fillers, colors, etc.<br>
In one presently preferred embodiment/the coating agent applied in a hard coating<br>
process is a sugarless coating agent, e.g. a polyol including as examples sorbitol,<br><br>
maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol and isomalt or e.g. a mono- di-saccha-<br>
ride including as example trehalose.<br>
Or alternatively a sugar free soft coating e.g. comprising alternately applying to the<br>
centres a syrup of a polyol or a mono- di-saccharide, including as examples sorbitol,<br>
maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, isomalt and trehalose.<br>
In further useful embodiments a film coating is provided by film-forming agents<br>
such as a cellulose derivative, a modified starch, a dextrin, gelatine, zein, shellec,<br>
gum arabic, a vegetable gum, a synthetic polymer, etc. or a combination thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the outer coating comprises at least one additive<br>
component selected from the group comprising of a binding agent, a moisturε-<br>
absorbing component, a film-forming agent, a dispersing agent, an antisticking<br>
component, a bulking agent, a flavoring agent, a coloring agent, apharmaceutically<br>
or cosmetically active component, a lipid component, a wax component, a sugar, an<br>
acid<br>

A coated chewing gum center according to the invention may have any form, shape<br>
or dimension that permits the chewing gum center to be coated using any<br>
conventional coating process.<br>
The gum centre of coated chewing gum' element according to the invention can have<br>
any form, shape or dimension that permits the chewing gum centre to be coated using<br>
any conventional coating process. Accordingly, the gum centre may be e.g. in a form<br>
selected from a pellet, a cushion-shaped pellet, a stick, a tablet, a chunk, a pastille, a<br>
pill, a ball and a sphere, and typically the weight of a gum center may be 0,5 to 5<br>
grams.<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Preparation of gum bases and chewing gums<br>
Three different gum bases were prepared from the above polymers of examples 1 to<br>
4 by combining the elastomeric polymer of ex. 4 with three different resinous poly-<br>
mers as outlined in table 1:<br><br>
The gum bases areprepared as follows: ••<br>
The elastomeric polymer and resinous polymer are added to a mixing kettle provided<br>
with mixing means like e.g. horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle has been<br>
i<br>
preheated for 15 minutes to a temperature of about 60-80°C. The mixture is mixed<br>
for 10-20 minutes until the whole mixture becomes homogeneous. The mixture is<br>
then discharged into the pan and allowed to cool to room temperature from the<br>
discharged temperature of 60-80°C.<br><br>
Based on the Tg's of the resinous components, gum bases no. 101 and 102 are in the<br>
present text considered as high-Tg-biodegradable gum bases as compared to gum<br>
base no. 103. In gum base no. 103, the resinous component has a Tg of about 31 °C,<br>
which is below mouth temperature, while in gum base no. 101 and 102, the resinous<br>
components have Tg's of 44 °C and 41 °C, which are above normal mouth<br>
temperature.<br><br>
All the chewing gums are prepared with the same overall composition, wherein only<br>
the type of resinous component (the polymers of ex. 1,2, and 3, respectively) in the<br>
gum base is varied. The softeners, emulsifiers and fillers may alternatively be added<br>
to the polymers as a part of the gum base preparation.<br><br>
The chewing gum products are prepared as follows:<br>
The gum base is added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g.<br>
horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle has been preheated for 15 minutes to a<br>
temperature of about 40-60°C or the chewing gum is made in one step, immediately<br>
after preparation of gum base in the same mixer where the gum base and kettle has a<br>
temperature of about 60-80°C.<br>
One half portion of the sorbitol is added together with the gum base and mixed for 3<br>
minutes. Peppermint and menthol are then added to the kettle and mixed for 1<br>
minute. The remaining half portion of sorbitol is added and mixed for 1 minute.<br>
Maltitol syrup is added, and then wax and filler may be added and the gum mass is<br>
mixed well. Softeners are slowly added and mixed for 7 minutes. Then aspartame<br>
and acesulfame are added to the kettle and mixed for 3 minutes. Xylitol is added and<br>
mixed for 3 minutes. The resulting gum mixture is then discharged and e.g.<br>
transferred to a pan at a temperature of 40-48 °C. The gum is then rolled and scored<br>
into cores, sticks, balls, cubes, and any other desired shape, optionally followed by<br>
coating and polishing processes prior to packaging.<br>
Evidently, within the scope of the invention, other processes and ingredients may be<br>
applied in the process of manufacturing the chewing gum.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Evaluation of chewing gums comprising biodegradable polymers of high Tg's -<br>
and the effect of regulating the molecular weight<br>
Samples of chewing gum no. 1001 and 1002 were tested by some individual test<br>
persons, whereby the following evaluation was obtained:<br><br><br>
It has been found that an acceptable chewing gum texture may be obtained by the use<br>
of high-Tg-polymers as the compound providing the resinous contribution to the<br>
chewing gum.<br>
In the present evaluation, the samples of 1001 are judged to be the best alternative,<br>
even though the Tg of the resinous biodegradable polymer in 1001 is a few degrees<br>
higher than the corresponding of 1002. If any difference between the two samples<br>
due to Tg, it would be expected that the Tg of the resinous polymer would affect<br>
1001 to have the hardest texture. As the opposite situation is observed, the<br>
explanation of the texture may be interpreted to be due to the difference in molecular<br>
weight of the resinous biodegradable polymers of 1001 and 1002, respectively.<br>
The molecular weight of the resinous polymer of 1002 is somewhat higher than of<br>
1001, and the texture of the final chewing gum no. 1002 is somewhat harder than of<br>
1001. Hence, it is learned that the molecular weight may have a considerable impact<br>
on the performance of such biodegradable, polymers of higher Tgina. chewing gum.<br>
The chewing gum formulation of 1002 should be adjusted in order to achieve a fully<br>
acceptable texture of the chewing guitn comprising a resinous biodegradable polymer<br>
featuring both a relatively high Tg and molecular weight. A way to adjust the present<br><br>
formulation could for example be a slight lowering of the amount of resinous<br>
biodegradable polymer or a slight increase in the amount of softener.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Evaluation of chewing gums<br>
The chewing gum no. 1001 (comprising biodegradable polymer of Tg 44°C and Mn<br>
1165Q g/mol) was then compared to the low-Tg chewing gum no. 1003 (comprising<br>
a biodegradable polymer of Tg 31°C and Mn 6500)<br>
Samples of 1001 and 1003 were evaluated throughout at chewing period of 7 minutes<br>
and involving an evaluation of the initial phases A and B (A: 0-1 min. and B: 1-2<br>
min.), the intermediate phase (4-5 min.), and the end phase (6-7 min.) of the chewing<br>
period. The evaluation involved the following parameters: flavor, cooling, sweetness,<br>
elasticity, volume, and softness, the chewing gum samples were tested by serving<br>
them to 21 sensory panelists in tasting booths made in accordance with ISO 8598<br>
standards at room temperature in small tasteless plastic cups with randomized 3-<br>
figure codes. For each of the parameters tested, the panelists were required to provide<br>
their assessments according to an arbitrary scale of 0-15, with 0 being the lowest<br>
rating and 15 being the highest rating. Between each sample tested, the panelists<br>
were allowed a break of 3 minutes.<br><br><br>
Generally, the above evaluation reveals surprising results for the samples of chewing<br>
gum no. 1001. It was surprising, that the polymer with a Tg of 44°C, which is well<br>
above human body temperature, were actually fully applicable in chewing gums. In<br>
particular, it is a remarkable, that the properties of chewing gum no. 1001 were<br>
basically on the same level as chewing gum no. 1003 regardless of the different Tg's.<br>
The experiment discloses that a biodegradable polymer of high Tg, contrary to the<br>
expectations within the art, may be Used in a chewing gum in a rather large amount,<br>
without compromising the texture considerably.<br>
The above table 4 summarizes by average numbers the evaluation given by the<br>
sensory panel. However, based on Hie assertions made by the 21 sensory panelists it<br>
was furthermore evaluated, on which parameters small differences were significant.<br><br>
In table 5 the evaluation results are represented by five different levels:<br>
2 designates that 1001 is significantly unproved with respect to 1003.<br>
1 designates that indications of differences in favor of the 1001 samples compared<br>
to 1003 samples was observed.<br>
0 designates that there was found no considerable difference between 1001 and<br>
1003,<br>
-1 designates that 1001 shows indications of difference is observed, and that the<br>
indication of difference the properties of 1001 was not as good as 1003.<br>
-2 designates that there is a significant difference between 1001 and 1003 in favor of<br>
1003.<br><br>
Only the softness was in all chewing gum phases judged to be significantly inferior<br>
in 1001 compared to 1003. The level of sweetness was equal between the two<br>
chewing gum types in the initial phase, but in the intermediate and end phase, 1001<br>
was apparently loosing sweetness sooner than 1003. With regard to the rest of the<br>
parameters, flavor, cooling, elasticity, and volume, it is noteworthy, that the general<br>
picture was that the eventual differences weren't significant.<br><br>
It is understood from the experiments, that a biodegradable polyester featuring a Tg<br>
well above mouth temperature, may be fully applicable as a resinous compound in a<br>
chewing gum. Actually, based on the experiments, it is believed that the strength of<br>
such a resinous biodegradable polymer is increased by an increase in the Tg. In other<br>
words, the function as a resinous compound in chewing gum may be augmented and<br>
in some formulations improved by a higher Tg. Thus, a biodegradable polymer<br>
having a Tg above mouth temperature is found to have great properties as elastomer<br>
plasticizer, ie. elastomer solvent in chewing gum.<br>
It should furthermore be noted, that it is possible to avoid natural resins and natural<br>
rubber, by the application of a resinous biodegradable polymer according to the<br>
invention instead.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Biodegradable resinous homo-polymer with a high Tg<br>
A polymerization similar to example 1 was performed to prepare a biodegradable<br>
resinous polymer polymerized from only one monomer type, D,L-lactide to make a<br>
100%-lactidε-based polymer.'<br>
Characterization of the polymer indicates Tg about 40-45°C (DSC, heating rate<br>
10°C/min), Mn = 6,800g/mol and Mw = 7,4P0g/mol (gel permeation<br>
chromatography with online MALLS detector).<br>
It is acknowledged that mis polymer is also applicable as a resinous compound in a<br>
chewing gum formulation 'corresponding to example 5. The chewing gum is<br>
chewable without further softening, and the chewing gum texture may be adjusted by<br>
altering the molecular weight of the lactidε-polymer to be rather low compared to<br>
resinous biodegradable polymers of a lower Tg such as 31 °C.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A homopolymer by NatureWorks® PLA 4060 D (amorph) poly D,L-lactide was<br>

EXAMPLE 10<br>
A homopolymer by NatureWorks® PLA 5500 D (amorph) poly D,L-lactide was<br>
provided as a resin. The homopolymer has a Tg of about 50°C (Mn ~ 50,000)<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Preparation of gum bases<br>
The process of preparing gum bases is carried out in the following way: The gum<br>
base components are added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g.<br>
horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle has been preheated to a temperature of<br>
about 140°C. The rnixture is mixed for 30-120 minutes until the whole mixture<br>
becomes homogeneous. The mixture is then discharged into the pan and allowed to<br>
cool to room temperature.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>

The gum bases of example 11 were used in the preparation of peppermint flavored<br>
chewing gum formulations 1004 to 1006 with the basic formulations shown in table<br>
7 and where gum base 104 is applied for the preparation of chewing gum 1004, gum<br>
base 105 is applied for the preparation of chewing gum 1005 and so forth.<br><br><br>
The softeners, emulsifiers and fillers may alternatively be added to the polymers as a<br>
part of the gum base preparation.<br>
EXAMPLE 13:<br>
Evaluation of the chewing gum of table 7.<br>
The texture of the chewing gums of table 7 was evaluated.<br>
It was generally observed that the texture was well compensated by the modified<br>
softening system and that' the texture of 1005 and 1006 were acceptable and<br>
comparable to 1004.<br><br>
