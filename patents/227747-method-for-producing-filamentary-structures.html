				<td>Method For Producing Filamentary Structures<br>
Government Support<br>
This invention was made with government support under Grant Number DE-<br>
FG02-84ER13282, awarded by the Department of Energy. The United States<br>
government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to method and apparatus for synthesizing filamentary<br>
structures including nanotubes in the post-flame region of a non-sooting premixed or<br>
non-premixed flame using unsupported catalysts.<br>
Since their discovery in 1991(1), carbon nanotubes have sparked a surge of<br>
interest(2-5). Numbers in parentheses refer to the reference list included herein. The<br>
teachings in all of these references are incorporated by reference herein. The many<br>
unique properties of nanotubes gives appeal to a wide range of potential applications in<br>
areas such as mechanical actuators(6,7), sensors(8-10), polymer composites(l 1),<br>
electronics(12-16), biosensors and biocompatibility(17,18), gas storage( 19-22),<br>
adsorption(23-25), and catalysis(26-28). Techniques that have been demonstrated to<br>
synthesize carbon nanotubes include laser ablation(29,30), plasma arc(31), chemical<br>
vapor deposition (CVD)(32-34), fluidized bed reactors(35,36), and combustion<br>
systems(37-51).<br>
Flames offer potential as means of producing bulk quantities of carbon<br>
nanotubes in a continuous, economically favorable process. There are three key<br>
requirements for nanotube synthesis common to most of the synthesis techniques: 1) a<br>
source of carbon, 2) a source of heat, and 3) presence of metallic catalyst particles. A<br>
fuel-rich flame is a high-temperature, carbon-rich environment that can be suitable for<br>
nanotube formation if certain metals are introduced into the system.<br>
There have been a number of reported observations in the combustion literature<br>
of nanotubes and filamental carbon structures within flame systems. Perhaps the<br>
earliest observation of intriguing tube-like structures in flames is reported by<br>
Singer(52) in the 1950s and within the last decade there have been occasional reports of<br>
nanotube structures (38,49,50,53-57). These observations are typically reported as<br><br>
curiosities and are largely serendipitous in nature. In recent years Diener et al(51),<br>
Saito et al.(49,50), and Vander Wal et al(37-45) have independently made more<br>
detailed studies of nanotube formation in flames.<br>
Diener et al. (51) report the synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes in<br>
sooting flames. A semi-premixed flame configuration is used with fuel gases<br>
(acetylene, ethylene or benzene) issued through numerous small diameter tubes<br>
distributed through a sintered metal plate through which oxygen flows, drafting past the<br>
fuel tubes. Iron and nickel bis(cyclopentadiene) compounds are vaporized and issued to<br>
the flame feed as a metal catalyst precursor. Single-walled carbon nanotubes are<br>
observed in acetylene and ethylene flames (within the equivalence ratio range of 1.7 to<br>
3.8) while multi-walled nanotubes are observed in benzene flames (within the<br>
equivalence ratio range of 1.7 to 3.4). An equivalence ratio, ï¡Œe, is defined as the<br>
actual fuel/oxygen ratio divided by the stoichiometric fuel/oxygen ratio corresponding<br>
to conversion of all carbon to C02 and all hydrogen to H20. Diener et al. do not report<br>
the level of dilution with argon, the concentration of metal species added, to the flame,<br>
or the inlet velocity for the feed gas mixture - all are parameters affecting nanotube<br>
formation in flames. The reported overall single-walled carbon nanotube yields are very<br>
low "certainly less than 1% of the carbon soot product" and this small population of<br>
single-walled carbon nanotubes is confirmed by inspection of the transmission electron<br>
microscope (TEM) micrographs in the article. The nanotube bearing soot material<br>
analyzed by Diener et al. is collected from a filter system far downstream from the<br>
burner and there is no information relating to the time, temperature or concentration<br>
history of the material, making it difficult to judge the extent to which nanotubes were<br>
in fact formed in the flame and how much growth occurred during extended exposure<br>
to flame exhaust while collecting in associated downstream systems. Prior to analysis,<br>
the material is prepared using a separation technique employing sonication of the soot<br>
in methanol to disperse the sample - it is unclear how this preparation technique might<br>
alter the composition of the material and if the material is representative of solid<br>
material present in the flame itself. Diener et al. place emphasis on the use of sooting<br>
flames for the synthesis of their materials which is in fact analogous to the approach<br>
reported by Howard et al(46-48), Richter et al(55), and Duan et al. (54). The reported<br>
range of equivalence ratios is stated as 1.7 to 3.8 which is very much focused on<br><br>
exploiting sooting conditions. Furthermore, the quantities of nanotubes observed in the<br>
condensed material is very small (
Saito et al. (49,50) immersed metallic substrates in various hydrocarbon fueled<br>
diffusion flames and observed multi-walled carbon nanotubes that had formed on the<br>
substrate. It will be understood by those familiar with the combustion literature that a<br>
diffusion flame is one type of non-premixed flame. Vander Wal and coauthors have<br>
observed single walled nanotubes in a hydrocarbon (acetylene or ethylene)/air diffusion<br>
flame with nitrogen diluent and metallocene catalyst precursor compound added to the<br>
fuel stream (38).<br>
Vander Wal and coworkers make extensive use of an annular burner<br>
configuration consisting of a 50 mm diameter sintered metal plate with a central tube of<br>
11m diameter that is mounted flush with the surface of the burner plate. See Fig. 1.<br>
For most experiments Vander Wal et al. established a fuel rich premixed flame<br>
supported on the outer annular section of a burner plate 10 while reactant gas mixtures,<br>
including metal catalyst species of interest were fed through a central tube 12. This<br>
configuration is termed a 'pyrolysis flame' in the papers as the central gas flow does<br>
not undergo combustion due to the lack of oxygen in this flow, but reactions (and<br>
nanotube formation) do proceed in the flow by virtue of the heating influence of the<br>
surrounding annular flame. The entral gas flow is in effect a reactive streamtube and<br>
not aflame. A stabilizing chimney 14 (7.5 x 2.5 cm diameter) immersed in the flame<br>
gases provides a stabilizing effect and nanotube (single-wall, multi-wall nanotubes and<br>
nanofiber) samples are collected at the exit of the chimney. There are some important<br>
distinctions to note regarding this configuration. First of all, the outer (annular) flame<br>
is primarily a source of heat and the central gas mixture flow is the primary source of<br>
carbon and metallic catalyst. Combustion is not supported in the central gas flow.<br>
Therefore, heating and material synthesis processes are substantially separated<br>
functions.<br>
A flame system has been used extensively in combination with a wide variety of<br>
methods to introduce metallic catalyst species to the system. Vander Wal and Ticich<br>
performed comparative experiments, synthesizing nanotubes in both the 'pyrolysis<br>
flame' and tube reactor setups (39,40). The premixed flame in the outer annulus used<br>
acetylene/air mixtures of equivalence ratios between 1.4 and 1.62, The reactant gas<br><br>
mixtures used in this instance used either carbon monoxide/hydrogen or<br>
acetylene/hydrogen mixtures, and iron or nickel nanoparticles entrained in the central<br>
feed gases. In a similar study, Vander Wal and Ticich used a carbon<br>
monoxide/hydrogen reactant feed mixture and used a nebulized solution of iron colloid<br>
(ferrofluid) and a spray drying technique as the source of catalyst particles. Nanotube<br>
samples were collected once again at the exit of the chimney section (39). Single-<br>
walled nanotubes were observed in a similar flame setup where Vander Wal and Hall<br>
introduced metallocene (ferrocene and nickelocene) vapor to the central reactive feed<br>
gases using a controlled sublimation technique (45). Vander Wal observed single-<br>
walled nanotubes in an identical flame arrangement using a nebulizer system to<br>
introduce iron nitrate salt solution to the flame as the catalyst particle precursor (37).<br>
Vander Wal also reports the formation of nanofibers (similar to multi-walled nanotubes<br>
except the walls tend to be irregular and non-graphitic) in an identical flame<br>
configuration with nickel nitrate solution nebulized into the flame (44).<br>
Another variation of the catalyst feed technique with this burner configuration is<br>
reported by Vander Wal, where catalyst particles are generated by burning a piece of<br>
paper coated in metal particles and the resulting aerosol is entrained in a fuel-rich<br>
mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and air. The resulting gas mixture is fed to the<br>
central section of an annular fuel-rich acetylene-air flame and single-walled nanotubes<br>
are collected at the exit of a cylindrical chimney surrounding the central streamtube. In<br>
this instance the central gas flow does in fact lead to a premixed flame (as opposed to a<br>
pyrolysis reaction streamtube in previous experiments) where the premixed flame<br>
composition is carbon monoxide, hydrogen and air with entrained iron nano-particles.<br>
Single-wall nanotubes were once again collected at the exhaust of the stabilizing<br>
chimney(43). In this configuration, the premixed gas feed did not contain a<br>
hydrocarbon (carbon monoxide and hydrogen are used in this case). Further, the<br>
nanotube material is collected quite late in the system at a point exclusively at the<br>
exhaust of a physical chimney insert.<br>
Vander Wal, Hall, and Berger have synthesized multi-walled nanotubes and<br>
nanofibers on cobalt nanoparticles supported on a metal substrate immersed in<br>
premixed flames of various hydrocarbon fuels and equivalence ratios (41,42). This<br>
configuration is truly a premixed flame and all three functions necessary for nanotube<br><br>
synthesis (heat source, carbon source, and metal catalyst) are present in the same flame<br>
environment. However, in this instance the catalyst particles are supported on an<br>
externally affixed substrate immersed in the flame gases.<br>
An extensive amount of research related to the formation of fullerenes and<br>
fullerenic nanostructures in flames has been reported in the last decade (46-<br>
48,56,58,59). In particular, there have been two studies by Howard et al. where carbon<br>
nanotubes have been observed in condensed material collected from flames (47,48).<br>
Howard et al. employed a premixed flame configuration operated at low pressure (20 to<br>
97 Torr), and burner gas velocity between 25 and 50 cm/s. A variety of fuels and<br>
fuel/oxygen compositions (C/O ratios) were explored including acetylene (C/O 1.06, ï¡Œ<br>
= 2.65), benzene (C/O 0.86 to 1.00, (p = 2.15 to 2.65) and ethylene (C/O 1.07, ï¡Œ =<br>
3.21). Diluent concentrations between 0 and 44 mol% were alsoexplored. These<br>
flames are all considered 'sooting' flames as they spontaneously generate condensed<br>
carbon in the form of soot agglomerates suspended in the flame gases. Similarly, other<br>
studies that have reported nanotubes in flames such as Duan et al .(54) and Richter et<br>
al. (55) have each been under sooting conditions. Samples of condensed material were<br>
obtained directly from the flame using a water-cooled gas extraction probe (between 2<br>
to 7 cm above burner), and also from the water-cooled surfaces of the burner chamber.<br>
Nanostructures were extracted from the collected soot material by sonication of soot<br>
material dispersed in toluene. High resolution electron microscopy of the extracted<br>
material allowed visual analysis of the fullerenic nanostructures. A range of<br>
nanostructures was observed, including spherical, spheroidal, tubular and trigonous<br>
structures, typically composed of multiple, graphitic carbon planes. Nanotubes are<br>
observed in these materials and tend to be multi-walled nanotubes typically with more<br>
than 5 walls. The nanotube material is generally observed predominately in the<br>
material collected from the chamber surfaces. US patent number 5,985,232 has been<br>
awarded for 'production of fullerenic nanostructures' that draws heavily on the<br>
methods and observations reported in the papers described above (46). The patent<br>
discloses a method based on a flame burning unsaturated hydrocarbons, operated at<br>
sub-atmospheric pressure (up to 300 Torr), with diluent present in the flame feed gases,<br>
and also makes allowance for the addition of metal species (such as iron, cobalt, nickel,<br>
calcium, magnesium, potassium, rubidium and strontium) to promote the formation of<br><br>
single-walled nanostructures. Additional disclosure relates to the potential of adding<br>
oxidant species to the flame gases to selectively purify the nanostructures relative to the<br>
soot material and possibly open the end-caps of nanotube materials.<br>
There have been a number of combustion studies that have employed some<br>
components of the system described in the present patent application, yet did not<br>
observe the formation of carbon nanotube material. Rumminger et al. (60,61)<br>
introduced a vapor of iron pentacarbonyl into premixed flames of methane/air and also<br>
carbon monoxide/hydrogen/air. The focus of the studies was on flame inhibition due to<br>
the compound. No nanotube material is reported from this work and the likely reason is<br>
the low equivalence ratio employed in these studies. Feitelberg and coworkers also<br>
injected metal compounds into premixed flames in order to examine the effect upon<br>
soot formation in fuel rich flames. Nanotube-like material was not reported from these<br>
studies, most likely because the equivalence ratios employed were too high. Janzen<br>
and Roth (62) examined the formation of iron-oxide particles in a premixed<br>
hydrogen/oxygen/argon flame injected with iron pentacarbonyl and did not observe any<br>
 nanotube formation. The reason is very simply that there was insufficient carbon in<br><br>
this flame system. Each of these flame studies employed some, but not all, of the<br>
components that have been found to favor nanotube formation in a premixed flame.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect, the invention is a method for producing filamentary structures<br>
such as nanotubes including combusting hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen so as to<br>
establish a non-sooting pre-mixed or non-premixed flame and providing an<br>
unsupported^atalyst to synthesize the filamentary structure in a post-flame region of<br>
the flame. The equivalence ratio, catalyst type and catalyst concentration may be<br>
selected to establish the non-sooting flame. In a preferred embodiment, residence time<br>
of the structures in the post-flame region of the flame extends up to approximately 200<br>
milliseconds. It is preferred that a diluent such as argon be provided along with the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen. It is also preferred that the catalyst be a metal in the<br>
form of an aerosol produced in the flame either by chemical reactions of a precursor<br>
compound such as iron pentacarbonyl and coagulation of the reaction products or by<br>
physical dispersion and mixing of pre-prepared catalyst particles.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the filamentary structures are nanotubes each having<br>
a small diameter with either a metallic or semiconductor chirality. The invention<br>
further contemplates adding modifying agents such as ammonia, thiophene, hydrogen<br>
and carbon monoxide. A secondary oxidant may also be injected into the post-flame<br>
region so as to preferentially oxidize carbon or metallic contamination, or open<br>
filament structure.<br>
In yet another embodiment, an electric and/or magnetic field may be impressed<br>
upon the flame or the post-flame region of the flame to alter residence time profiles<br>
and/or particle trajectories to alter filamentary structure and/or morphology. In one<br>
embodiment, an electric field having a selected strength is impressed upon the flame<br>
wherein the field lines are substantially parallel to the flame gas flow to induce<br>
preferential growth of the structures having either metallic or semiconductor chirality.<br>
In yet another embodiment, an electric and/or magnetic field may be impressed<br>
upon the flame or the post-flame region of the flame to alter residence time profiles<br>
and/or particle trajectories to induce a separation effect. In one embodiment, an electric<br>
field having a selected strength is impressed upon the flame wherein the field lines are<br>
substantially perpendicular to flame gas flow to induce preferential separation of the<br>
structures from the flame gases.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention includes an apparatus for synthesizing<br>
filamentary structures having a burner system and a source of hydrocarbon fuel and<br>
oxygen delivered to the burner system to establish a non-sooting premixed or non-<br>
premixed flame A source of unsupported catalyst is provided to deliver the<br>
unsupported catalyst into the burner system. In a preferred embodiment, the burner<br>
system is designed to provide a selected residence time in a post-flame region in the<br>
burner system.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Definitions<br>
The term 'catalyst' refers to particles introduced to the flame gases to initiate<br>
filamentary structure growth and control the nature of the formed structures.<br>
The term 'unsupported catalyst' refers to catalyst particles (or precursor reagents that<br>
decompose to form components that coalesce and consequently form catalyst particles)<br>
that are introduced to the flame environment independent of any physical support<br>
affixed to a point or surface outside of the post-flame domain.<br>
The term 'filamentary structures' refers to materials where there exists a dominant<br>
linear dimension, giving the structure of the material a filament-like or filamentary<br>
appearance. See also the definition of aspect ratio below.<br>
The term 'filamentary nanostructures' refers to filamentary structures that have<br>
one or more dimensions on the scale of nanometers. Filamentary nanostructures include<br>
nanotubes, nanowires, nanocones, peapods, and nanofibers.<br><br>
The term 'fullerenic' refers most specifically to an allotropic form of carbon<br>
that exhibits a three-dimensional curved structure comprising one or more layers or<br>
shells each including five-and sometimes seven-membered rings within a network of<br>
otherwise six-membered rings.<br>
The term 'nanotube' implies a'tubular structure of nanoscale dimensions.<br>
Nanotubes may be fullerenic in nature, implying they have end caps that close the<br>
surface of the structure, or may be tubular yet with end regions affixed to features (such<br>
as metal particles) other than curved end-caps, or the nanotubes may be open at one or<br>
multiple ends of the structure. More formally, there are essentially four categories that<br>
define the structure of nanotubes.<br>
1.	Single or multiwalled: Nanotubes can be considered as a graphitic plane<br>
rolled to form a cylinder. There are two main classes.of carbon nanotubes. A<br>
single-walled nanotube (SWNT) is a single graphitic layer in the form of a<br>
tube. Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) consist of multiple layers arranged<br>
concentrically about a common axis. Double-walled nanotubes<br>
(DWNT)(63) are occasionally described as a distinct class, however they<br>
can be considered as the smallest category of MWNT.<br>
2.	Diameter: Single wall nanotubes have diameters of order lnm. Typical<br>
range of diameters spans from 0.7nm (the diameter of C60) through to 10nm.<br>
The smallest observed nanotube diameter is 0.4nm (4A)(64,65). The<br>
diameter of multi-walled nanotubes varies between around lnm up to<br>
100nm.<br>
3.	Aspect ratio: One of the most striking properties of nanotubes is the<br>
disparity in their dimensions. The length of nanotubes can extend to order of<br>
microns and more, giving an aspect ratio (length to diameter) of 1000 to 1.<br>
The longest nanotubes reported to date(66) are 20cm, giving an aspect ratio<br>
of 200,000,000 to 1! As used herein, filamentary structures have an aspect<br>
ratio of at least 10 to 1.<br>
4.	Chirality: The chirality of a nanotube refers to the 'twist' in the graphitic<br>
layer that makes up the tube wall. Certain chiralities can give metallic<br>
conduction while others are semiconductive. The chirality of a nanotube can<br>
be described uniquely by two indices (m,n). By folding a graphene sheet<br><br>
into a cylinder so that the beginning and end of a (m,n) lattice vector in the<br>
graphene plane join together, one obtains an (m,n) nanotube(4). (m,m)<br>
nanotubes are said to be 'arm-chair', (m,0) and (0,m) nanotubes are 'zig-<br>
zag', and (m,n) nanotubes are chiral. All arm-chair nanotubes are metallic<br>
but only one third of possible zig-zag and chiral nanotubes are metallic, the<br>
other two thirds being semiconducting (67).<br>
The term 'nanowire' implies a linearly contiguous and non-hollow length of metal<br>
based material with diameter on a scale of nanometers. Nanowires can be formed by<br>
filling the internal cavity of carbon nanotubes with metals and other elements.<br>
The term 'nanocone' refers to a class of materials that have a dominant linear<br>
dimension with a non-constant diameter increasing or decreasing relative to the<br>
position along the length of the structure.<br>
The term 'peapod' refers to carbon nanotubes that have one or more carbon<br>
fullerenes occupying the internal cavity of the nanotube.<br>
The term 'nanofiber' refers to filamental structures that are similar in structure to<br>
multi-walled nanotubes as they possess multiple structural layers in the wall area.<br>
Nanofibers are much more disordered and irregular relative to nanotubes and the walls<br>
are non-graphitic. Carbon nanofibers may alternately be described as carbon fibrils,<br>
vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF), filamental carbon, filamental coke or simply<br>
filaments.<br>
The term 'graphitic' refers most specifically to an allotropic form of carbon that<br>
exhibits a flat, two-dimensional, planar structure. The term graphitic in the context of<br>
this document refers to the flat geometric structure and the high degree of order<br>
associated with a planar structure, and does not necessarily imply an elemental<br>
composition of carbon. A graphitic plane rolled into a cylinder can therefore describe<br>
the structure of a single-walled nanotube.<br>
The term 'post-flame region or zone' is the part of the flame located downstream<br>
of, or farther from a burner than, the oxidation region or zone of the flame. The<br>
beginning of the post-flame region is marked by the approximate completion of the<br>
consumption of molecular oxygen and the conversion of the original fuel to<br>
intermediates and products including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, acetylene,<br>
other carbon containing species, hydrogen and water. The post-flame region includes<br><br>
the tail of the flame, extends to the transition between the flame and the exhaust, and<br>
consists of hot but usually cooling gases which are approximately well mixed within a<br>
given cross section of the flow perpendicular to the direction of flow at a given distance<br>
from the burner. The well-mixed condition is achieved by mixing the fuel and oxygen<br>
together before feeding them to the burner (premixed combustion) or by feeding the<br>
fuel and oxygen as separate streams which rapidly mix within the combustor over a<br>
downstream distance from the burner that is much smaller than the diameter or the<br>
equivalent diameter of the post flame region (non-premixed combustion). The<br>
residence time in the post-flame region is much larger than the residence time in the<br>
oxidation region of premixed flames or the mixing and oxidation region of non-<br>
premixed flames.<br>
The term 'sooting flame' refers to a flame system including a fuel and oxygen<br>
undergoing combustion in such a way that carbon soot is generated in visibly<br>
significant quantities. Almost all non-premixed flames of hydrocarbon fuels exhibit<br>
soot formation. The sooting limit for premixed flames is defined as the lowest<br>
equivalence ratio (or carbon to oxygen ratio) at which soot is observed in the flame<br>
gases. A sooting flame has a distinctive, visibly luminous glow caused by emission<br>
from the soot particles. A non-sooting flame is established by a fuel equivalence ratio<br>
(or carbon to oxygen ratio) lower than the sooting limit.<br>
Addition of metal bearing compounds to the flame may induce visible luminosity<br>
yet the flame is not sooting as in this instance the sooting limit is defined for the base-<br>
flame (fuel, oxygen only). For non-sooting flames the radiance is caused by emission<br>
from the metal particles rather than soot particles.<br>
In flames containing nanotube formation catalysts, the critical equivalence ratio<br>
for soot formation depends not only on equivalence ratio, but also on the type and<br>
concentration of catalysts present. Metal catalysts may augment soot formation such<br>
that a non-sooting condition may become sooting upon catalysts addition if the flame<br>
were at an equivalence ratio near the sooting limit and the type and concentration of<br>
catalyst added were sufficient.<br>
Burner system<br>
A premixed acetylene/oxygen/argon flame formed the basis of the experiments<br>
disclosed in this patent application. An argon dilution of 15 molar percent, cold gas<br><br>
feed velocity of 30 cm/s, and burner pressure of 50 Torr were used throughout the<br>
experiments. A variety of fuel equivalence ratios ranging from 1.4 through 2.2 were<br>
considered. Iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) was used as the source of metallic catalyst<br>
necessary for nanotube synthesis.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, a controlled flow of iron pentacarbonyl vapor was<br>
supplied through a temperature-controlled (4â€¬C) single-stage bubble saturator 20 unit<br>
using argon as the carrying gas. The argon gas flow could be accurately proportioned<br>
between the saturator 20 and a bypass line, allowing control of the catalyst feed rate.<br>
Typical iron pentacarbonyl feed concentrations were 6000ppm (molar).<br>
A burner 22 consisted of a 100mm diameter copper plate 24 with 1500<br>
uniformly spaced 1mm diameter holes drilled through the surface. Only the inner<br>
70mm diameter burner section was utilized for this study with the outer annular section<br>
used during flame startup. The burner plate 24 is attached to a burner cavity filled with<br>
stainless steel wool to facilitate uniform flow distribution of premised gases 25 entering<br>
from the base of the cavity. Suitable premised gases include acetylene, oxygen and<br>
argon. It is also contemplated that modifying agents for altering the structure or<br>
morphology of the condensed material may be co-injected. In addition, a secondary<br>
oxidant may be injected in the post-flame region to oxidize carbon contamination. It is<br>
also contemplated to quench the filamentary structures by injecting an inert fluid that<br>
will quench by sensible energy, latent energy or chemical reaction. A flow of cooling<br>
water passes through copper tubing 26 coiled around the outside of the burner body.<br>
Burner plate temperatures were typically 70-80Â°C. The burner was mounted on a<br>
vertical translation stage 28, which allows measurements to be taken at various heights-<br>
above-burner (HAB). The burner 22 and translation stage 28 are contained in a<br>
stainless-steel pressure chamber 30. An upper chamber plate is water-cooled and<br>
exhaust gases are withdrawn through two ports 32 in the upper flange. A variety of<br>
ports in the sidewall of the chamber provide access to sampling and diagnostic<br>
instruments. A large (15cm) window 34 is provided for visual observation of the flame<br>
(68). An electronic proportioning valve 36 and PID controller coupled to the exhaust<br>
extraction system allows accurate control of the chamber pressure.<br>
Table 1 shows operational settings and parameters to obtain good quality<br>
nanotubes.<br><br><br>
With reference still to Fig 2, a preferred embodiment includes an electric field<br>
represented by the arrow 27 aligned with flame gas flow and having a selected field<br>
strength. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the electric field 27 could also be a<br>
magnetic field or the combination of an electric and magnetic field to alter the<br>
characteristics of the filamentary structures produced. For example, an electric and/or<br>
magnetic field may be used to alter residence time profiles and/or particle trajectories to<br>
alter the structure or morphology of the produced structures. The electric field 27<br>
aligned with the flame gas flow will induce preferential growth of the structures with<br>
either metallic or semiconductor chirality.<br><br>
Sampling system<br>
A thermophoretic sampling technique(69) was used to collect condensed material in the<br>
flame gases at various HAB and the samples were then analyzed using transmission<br>
election microscopy (TEM). A thermophoretic sampling system 38 included a<br>
pneumatic piston coupled with a timing mechanism to give precise control over<br>
immersion time within the flame. An insertion time of 250ms was used throughout the<br>
experiments. TEM grids 40 (Ladd Research Industries, 3mm Lacy film) were affixed<br>
to a thin metal stage attached via a 6mm diameter rod and pressure seal feedthrough to<br>
a pneumatic plunger. After insertion into the flame gases, each TEM grid was removed<br>
and subsequently taken to the microscope for analysis. A JOEL 200CX was used for<br>
the bulk of the microscopy work to allow rapid screening and turnaround of samples to<br>
be examined. More detailed microscopy was performed on a 2010 and 2000FX for<br>
high resolution images.<br>
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)<br>
The elemental composition of any condensed material is of particular interest in<br>
terms of the nanotube formation processes occurring in the flame. STEM combined<br>
with electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) allows a high resolution<br>
transmission electron microscopy image to be correlated with an elemental map that<br>
gives insight into the distribution of specific elements (such as C, Fe, O) relative to the<br>
material structures imaged using TEM. A VG HB603 system was used for STEM<br>
anatysis performed in this study.<br>
Raman spectroscopy<br>
Raman spectroscopy can be used to obtain information relating to the diameter<br>
and also the chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes (70,71). When single-wall<br>
nanotubes are irradiated with 514.5nm argon-ion laser light, at least two distinct<br>
resonant modes are observed in the resulting Raman spectrum. Modes around the 100<br>
to 300 cm-1 frequency range correspond to the 'radial breathing mode' (RBM) of<br>
nanotubes where the cylindrical nanotube vibrates in a concentric expansion and<br>
contraction. The frequency of the RBM is inversely proportional to tube diameter and<br>
so die spectrum can be used to obtain tube diameter information. The second major<br>
feature in the spectrum is the 'G-band' at around 1590cm-1 which corresponds to<br>
transverse vibrations along the plane of the nanotube wall. Shifts in the shape of the<br><br>
G-band peak can indicate the nature of the nanotube chirality (semiconducting or<br>
metallic). Raman spectroscopy on condensed samples collected from the burner<br>
chamber wall was performed using a Kaiser Hololab 5000R Raman spectrometer with<br>
Raman microprobe attachment. The spectrometer was operated at 514.5 nm at<br>
0.85mW power in stokes configuration.<br>
Synthesis dynamics characterization<br>
Thermophoretic samples were taken at regular height intervals above the burner<br>
22 and images obtained using transmission electron microscopy. Each sampling height<br>
corresponds to a residence time away from the burner and so this technique enables<br>
characterization of the dynamics of the nanotube growth processes occurring in the<br>
flame. Flame characterization sampling was performed on flames with equivalence<br>
ratios (ï¡Œ) between 1.4 and 2.2. For each flame, samples were obtained along the axis-<br>
line in the post-flame region between 10 and 75 mm above the burner. A typical<br>
progression of nanotube morphologies observed in a flame with equivalence ratio of<br>
1.6 is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The initial post-flame region (up to 40mm) as shown in Fig. 3 is dominated by<br>
the presence of discrete particles. Particle formation and growth leads to larger particle,<br>
sizes as height above burner increases. Iron pentacarbonyl decomposes rapidly upon<br>
exposure to the flame and the particles size growth most likely occurs through<br>
coagulation of the iron resulting from this decomposition (62). The composition of the<br>
particles is most likely metallic iron as observed in flames of higher equivalence ratio<br>
(72).<br>
Nanotube growth is generally accepted to occur through a decomposition-<br>
diffusion-precipitation mechanism whereby carbon bearing species (primarily CO)<br>
catalytically decompose on the surface of a metal particle, followed by elemental<br>
carbon dissolving into the metal lattice and diffusing to the adjacent side of the particle,<br>
where the carbon precipitates in a curved tubular graphitic structure (73-75). Based on<br>
this mechanism it is likely that catalytic decomposition and 'loading' of carbon into the<br>
particles is also occurring concurrently with particle growth in this initial post-flame<br>
region.<br>
Carbon nanotubes are observed after an inception time of approximately 30<br>
milliseconds. A small number of discrete nanotube segments with length of the order<br><br>
of 100nm are observed as early as 25ms and longer tube lengths up to a micron in<br>
length are observed to form in the following 10ms. It appears that the metallic particle<br>
population has reached a critical level after 25ms and nanotube growth proceeds rapidly<br>
after this point for the next 10 to 20ms. The critical condition may be sufficiently large<br>
particle size, carbon content, surface properties, internal lattice structure transition (41),<br>
or point of relative concentrations for CO and H2 within the flame gases (42).<br>
For times after 40ms the dominant mechanism appears to be coalescence of the<br>
condensed material in the flame gases. Disordered networks of nanotube bundles form<br>
tangled webs decorated with metallic and soot-like particles. The complexity and size<br>
of the webs increases significantly in the upper region of the system, between 45 and<br>
70ms.<br>
From the structures observed in the post-flame gases it is clear that, once<br>
initiated, nanotube growth occurs quite rapidly. An order of magnitude estimate for the<br>
nanotube growth rate is 100 um/s based on the images and observed increase in length<br>
of 100nm to 1 micron over a period of 10ms (between 25 to 35ms).<br>
Nanotube formation window<br>
The effect of different equivalence ratios upon nanotube formation was also<br>
investigated. Samples were extracted from 70mm above burner (approx. 67ms) for<br>
equivalence ratios between 1.4 and 2.0. Representative TEM images over the range of<br>
equivalence ratios are shown in Fig. 4. Nanotubes are observed to form between<br>
equivalence ratios of 1.5 and 1.9. This range of equivalence ratios can be considered as<br>
a 'formation window' where conditions within the flame are suitable for nanotube<br>
synthesis. A particularly preferred equivalence ratio range is 1.5 
equivalence ratios (1.4 and 1.5) the condensed material in the flame is dominated by<br>
discrete particles, although nanotubes may form at higher HAB than those described in<br>
the present system (See Fig. 11). The range of equivalence ratios that could support<br>
nanotube growth can therefore potentially extend from 1.7 to 1.0. Equivalence ratios<br>
of 1.9 and higher are dominated by soot-like structures displaying clustered networks of<br>
primary particles (of either metallic or carbon encapsulated metal centers) with the<br>
occasional nanotube within this matrix. It is interesting to note that within the<br>
formation window range, relatively 'clean' nanotubes are formed at the lower<br><br>
equivalence ratios while an increasing level of encrusting with disordered carbon is<br>
observed on the nanotubes as the equivalence ratio increases.<br>
A continuum of morphologies is apparent ranging between clean nanotubes at<br>
low equivalence ratios through to an increasing proportion of soot-like material as the<br>
equivalence ratio increases. A competition between carbon precipitation pathways is<br>
likely, with one pathway leading to filamentary or tube structures and the other to<br>
disordered carbon clusters. This observation is consistent with the nanotube formation<br>
mechanism and how this would relate to a flame environment. As fuel equivalence<br>
ratio increases from unity, the level of excess carbon available in the flame gases<br>
increases, so one would also expect an increasing potential to form carbon nanotubes.<br>
This trend is tempered as the sooting equivalence ratio limit is reached and the<br>
availability of carbon exceeds the capacity of the nanotube formation pathway and<br>
disordered carbon is formed. Therefore the lower formation limit corresponds to<br>
insufficient availability of carbon, while the upper limit is due to dominance of soot<br>
formation pathways close to the sooting limit.<br>
The observed change in morphology as equivalence ratio is changed is<br>
described quantitatively in Fig. 10. A metric of nanotube quality, defined in this<br>
instance as the product of filament length and filaments counted in a TEM image<br>
divided by the image area covered by condensed material. High quality material by<br>
this metric would have many filaments of significant length within a matrix of minimal<br>
non-structured condensed material. A plot of this metric against equivalence ratio<br>
indicates quite clearly that nanotube quality improves dramatically as equivalence ratio<br>
moves from high (2.0+) to lower equivalence ratios. This trend reinforces the<br>
importance of using non-sooting flames to enhance the growth of filamental structures<br>
in the flame. Furthermore, the TEM insets and schematic plot give context to this<br>
phenomena relative to other flame parameters.<br>
Material characterization<br>
Higher magnification TEM analysis shows that the condensed filamental<br>
material is predominantly bundles of single-wall nanotubes (Fig. 5). The structures<br>
shown in Fig. 5 resulted from an equivalence ratio of 1.6 with a HAB of 70 mm. The<br>
inset shows detail of a nanotube bundle with an outer wall shown in dark contrast. The<br>
flame synthesis process preferentially forms single-wall as opposed to multi-wall<br><br>
nanotubes. This observation is in agreement with other flame studies (43) and indicates<br>
a high degree of selectivity in the material synthesis despite the ensemble of competing<br>
processes occurring in the flame system. A TEM image for material collected from the<br>
water-cooled chamber wall (used for Raman measurements also) is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Note the dominant features of nanotube bundles encrusted with agglomerates of carbon<br>
with internal metallic particles.<br>
The Raman spectroscopy technique yielded a number of observations about the<br>
flame generated nanotube material. A typical Raman spectrum for flame generated<br>
material is shown in Fig. 7. Spectra for flame generated material (bold line) are<br>
compared to materials obtained from plasma arc processes (light grey lines) in Fig. 8.<br>
In Fig. 7, features centered around 200 cm-1 are radial breathing modes corresponding<br>
to a range of single-walled nanotube diameters (approximately 0.9 to 1.3 nm). The<br>
shape of the large peak at 1590 cm-1 relates to chirality effects. The Raman spectrum<br>
for the flame generated material shows a wide distribution of peaks corresponding to<br>
radial breathing modes (REM). The corresponding range of tube diameters that<br>
generate this spectrum are between approximately 0.9 and 1.3 nm. When compared to<br>
the REM modes obtained from the spectra of material generated with a plasma-arc<br>
technique, a difference in diameter distribution is clear. The flame generated material<br>
has a broader distribution of diameters and the diameters extend to smaller sizes. Other<br>
differences are apparent based on the shape of the G-band. The flame generated<br>
material has a significant 'hump' profile on the side of the G-band, with a peak at about<br>
1330 cm-1 and an apparent peak seen as a shoulder on the G-band, which is indicative<br>
of nanotube chirality (semiconducting or metallic). Compared to the plasma-arc<br>
generated material, the flame material appears to be more metallic in nature.<br>
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was performed on material<br>
sampled directly from the flame as per the previously described TEM measurements.<br>
The composition of the particles associated with the carbon nanotubes is of particular<br>
interest and electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was used in scanning mode<br>
to obtain spatial maps of elemental intensity which could be compared to the STEM<br>
image in order to correlate composition with position. Images for this measurement on<br>
flame generated material are shown in Fig. 9. The STEM bright field image shows a<br>
bundle of single-wall carbon nanotubes with a dark particle agglomerate overlaying the<br><br>
bundle (apparently sitting next to rather than a part of the bundle). The elemental map<br>
for iron clearly shows a close correlation between the iron and the particle position,<br>
indicating the particle is composed largely of iron. The oxygen map also shows a<br>
correlation although at much lower intensity. The particle is most likely predominately<br>
iron but may have a small oxide content. The carbon map shows rather poor contrast<br>
due to the bundle sitting on a carbon substrate yet an increased carbon intensity is<br>
observed in correlation with the nanotube bundle and around the particle. The particle<br>
associated with the nanotube bundle is likely composed of iron surrounded by non-<br>
structured carbon, as can also be observed in TEM images shown in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
Nanotube yield &amp;purity<br>
The yield of nanotube material from the flame was estimated by a probe<br>
sampling technique and gravimetric analysis. A quartz tube (OD-11mm, ID 9mm),<br>
surrounded by a water cooled jacket, was inserted into the post-flame region with the<br>
mouth opening of the probe positioned 70mm above the burner surface. The quartz tube<br>
was attached directly to a sintered metal filter assembly (Swagelok) that had been<br>
modified by placing a custom made disc of filter fabric (Balston, grade CQ) in-line<br>
before the metal filter disc. A vacuum pump was coupled to the filter to allow<br>
extraction of flame gases and flame-born condensed material through the probe and<br>
filter unit. Sampled gases were vented from the sample pump exhaust directly to a<br>
water column (gas collection bell) to allow determination of the volumetric<br>
concentration in the flame. After sampling the flame for a measured period of time, the<br>
filter disc was removed from the filter unit and weighed to determine the mass of<br>
material collected.<br>
The amount of condensed material collected on the filter, scaled to the cross-<br>
section area of the burner face, over the sampling time (90sec), gave the following<br>
estimates for condensed material yield per component of burner feed (per C fed: 1.1%;<br>
per Fe fed 24.8%; per Fe(CO)5 fed 9.8%). Based on inspection of representative TEM<br>
micrographs for the flame sampled material (Fig. 6), it is estimated that roughly 50% of<br>
the image area covered by condensed material is associated with nanotubes (typically in<br>
the form of bundles) and this would equate roughly to a mass percentage of 10% or so.<br>
The yield of nanotubes relative to components fed to the burner can therefore be<br>
estimated as (per C fed 0.1%; per Fe fed 2.5%; per Fe(CO)5 fed 1.0%). These<br><br>
estimated yields indicate that there are significant quantities of nanotubes generated in<br>
the flames described in this study, and would certainly amount to more than 1% of the<br>
condensed material.<br>
The effect of using non-sooting flames is illustrated in Fig. 10. Nanotube<br>
quality and yield as a proportion of condensed material clearly improves as equivalence<br>
ratios shift away from the sooting limit. Note that yield of the filamentary material<br>
peaks at an equivalence ratio of approximately 1.6. However, it is likely that higher<br>
yields may be obtained at lower equivalence ratios and higher HAB (or longer<br>
residence times) as is indicated in Fig. 11.<br>
Single-walled nanotubes have thus been observed in a premixed<br>
acetylene/oxygen/argon flame operated at 50 Torr with iron pentacarbonyl vapor used<br>
as a source of metallic catalyst necessary for nanotube growth. A thermophoretic<br>
sampling method and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the<br>
solid material present at various heights above burner (HAB), giving resolution of<br>
formation dynamics within the flame system. Catalyst particle formation and growth is<br>
observed in the immediate post-flame region, 10 to 40 mm HAB, with coagulation<br>
leading to typical particle sizes on the order of 5 to 10 nm. Nanotubes were observed to<br>
be present after 40mm (~34ms) with nanotube inception occurring as early as 30mm<br>
HAB (-25 ms). Between 40 and 70 mm HAB (period of approx. 30 ms), nanotubes are<br>
observed to form and coalesce into clusters. Based on the rapid appearance of<br>
nanotubes in this region, it appears that once initiated, nanotube growth occurs quite<br>
rapidly, on the order of 100 urn per second. A nanotube formation 'window' is evident<br>
with formation limited to fuel equivalence ratios between a lower limit of 1.5 and an<br>
upper limit of 1.9, although this range may extend to lower equivalence ratios in<br>
samples withdrawn from higher (or after more time) in the post-flame region. A<br>
continuum of morphologies ranging from relatively clean clusters of nanotubes to<br>
disordered material is observed between the lower and upper limits. The yield of<br>
nanotubes in the condensed material increases at compositions lower than the sooting<br>
limit.<br>
It is recognized that modifications and variations of the invention disclosed<br>
herein will occur to those skilled in the art and it is intended that all of such<br>
modifications and variations be included within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1. Method for producing filamentary structures comprising:<br>
combusting hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen to establish a non-sooting flame;<br>
providing an unsupported catalyst to synthesize the filamentary structures in a post-<br>
flame region of the flame; and<br>
impressing an electric and/or magnetic field on the flame or post-flame region of the<br>
flame to alter residence time profiles and/or particle trajectories, and/or growth kinetics<br>
of particles to alter filamentary structure or morphology.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, which involves impressing on the flame an<br>
electric field having a selected strength and having field lines substantially parallel to<br>
flame gas flow to induce preferential growth of the structures having either metallic or<br>
semiconductor chirality.<br>
3.	Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the electric and/or magnetic field(s), as<br>
impressed, is/are with field lines perpendicular to the flow field in order to induce a<br>
separation of nanotubes or particles from the flame gases.<br><br>
Method and apparatus for producing filamentary structures. The structures<br>
include single-walled nanotubes. The method includes combusting hydrocarbon fuel<br>
and oxygen to establish a non-sooting flame and providing an unsupported catalyst to<br>
synthesize the filamentary structure in a post-flame region of the flame. Residence time<br>
is selected to favor filamentary structure growth.</td>
