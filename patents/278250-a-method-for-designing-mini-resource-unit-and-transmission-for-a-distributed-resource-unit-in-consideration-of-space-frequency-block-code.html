[invention Title]<br>
A METHOD FOR DESIGNING MINI RESOURCE UNIT AND<br>
TRANSMISSION FOR A DISTRIBUTED RESOURCE UNIT IN<br>
CONSIDERATION OF SPACE FREQUENCY BLOCK CODE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a wideband wireless<br>
mobile communication system supporting SFBC (Space<br>
Frequency Block Coding).<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Fading is the distortion that a carrier-modulated<br>
telecommunication signal experiences over certain<br>
propagation media. A fading channel is a communication<br>
channel that experiences fading. In wireless systems,<br>
fading is due to multi-path propagation and is sometimes<br>
referred to as multipath induced fading.<br>
In wireless communications, the presence of reflectors<br>
in the environment surrounding a transmitter and receiver<br>
creates multiple paths that a transmitted signal can<br>
traverse. As a result, the receiver sees the superposition<br>
of multiple copies of the transmitted signal, each<br>
traversing a different path. Each signal copy will<br>
experience differences in attenuation, delay and phase<br>
shift while traveling from the source to the receiver.<br>
This can result in either constructive or destructive<br>
interference, amplifying or attenuating the signal power<br>
seen at the receiver. Strong destructive interference is<br>
frequently referred to as a deep fade and may result in<br>
temporary failure of communication due to a severe drop in<br>
the channel signal-to-noise ratio.<br>
In telecommunications, a diversity scheme refers to a<br>
method for improving the reliability of a message signal by<br>
utilizing two or more communication channels with different<br>
characteristics. Diversity plays an important role in<br>
combating fading and co-channel interference and avoiding<br>
error bursts. Diversity exists because individual channels<br>
experience different levels of fading and interference.<br>
Multiple versions of the same signal may be transmitted<br>
and/or received and combined in the receiver.<br>
Alternatively, a redundant forward error correction code<br>
may be added and different parts of the message transmitted<br>
over different channels. Diversity techniques may exploit<br>
the multipath propagation, resulting in a diversity gain,<br>
often measured in decibels.<br>
Diversity scheme can be classified into time diversity,<br>
frequency diversity, space diversity, polarization<br>
diversity, multi-user diversity, and cooperative diversity.<br>
For time diversity among these, multiple versions of the<br>
same signal are transmitted at different time instants.<br>
Alternatively, a redundant forward error correction code is<br>
added and the message is spread in time by means of bit-<br>
interleaving before it is transmitted. Thus, error bursts<br>
are avoided, which simplifies the error correction. For<br>
frequency diversity, the signal is transferred using<br>
several frequency channels or spread over a wide spectrum<br>
that is affected by frequency-selective fading.<br>
In a broadband wireless mobile communication system,<br>
resources can be allocated in distributed manner for<br>
transmission to have frequency diversity gain. Strategies<br>
for distributed allocation of resources can be different<br>
according to the combinations of the number of DRUs<br>
(Distributed Resource Units) assigned to a user and the<br>
available bandwidth for forming DRUs for the user. The<br>
number of DRUs assigned to a user is proportional to the<br>
packet size allocated to the user, and the available<br>
bandwidth for forming DRUs is proportional to the number of<br>
LRUs (Logical Resource Units) allocated to the user.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates possible combinations of a packet<br>
size and the number of LRUs (the available bandwidth) for<br>
forming DRUs.<br>
Region 1 of Fig. 1 represents the combination of small<br>
amount of available bandwidth and large packet size, and<br>
Region 3 represents the combination of large amount of<br>
available bandwidth and large packet size. In Region 1 and<br>
Region 3, performance difference between possible<br>
distributed resource allocation strategies is negligible<br>
because the packet size is large in these regions so that<br>
the packet is more likely to spread over frequency.<br>
However, even in region 4, performance difference<br>
between possible distributed resource allocation strategies<br>
would not be significant if the size of a fractional PRU<br>
(Physical Resource Unit) or MRU (Mini physical Resource<br>
Unit) is small, because a number of MRUs of small size can<br>
be allocated in the manner that the MRUs spread over<br>
frequency axis due to large available bandwidth for forming<br>
DRUs. Therefore, in terms of diversity gain, the smaller a<br>
MRU size is, the better a system performance becomes.<br>
Therefore, generally one sub-carrier as the minimum unit<br>
for forming the DRU can obtain more diversity gain than<br>
other structure for the minimum unit.<br>
However, designing a MRU as a minimum unit for forming<br>
a DRU should be approached in view of flexibility as well<br>
as diversity because a wireless mobile communication system<br>
may support various sub-frame configurations. For example,<br>
a communication system may adopt FFR (Fractional Frequency<br>
Reuse) and FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) of DRU and<br>
CRU (contiguous resource unit). Also in some configuration,<br>
there exist those sub-frame configurations where STBC<br>
(Space-Time Block Code) is not suitable for data<br>
transmission. STBC is not suitable for a sub-frame having<br>
"odd" number of symbols. In TDD (Time Division Duplexing)<br>
mode, a total of odd number of symbols may be allocated for<br>
an irregular sub-frames (5 symbols) for TTG (Transmission<br>
Transition Gap), for a sub-frame including preamble, for a<br>
sub-frame including mid-amble, for an irregular sub-frame<br>
with other CP (Cyclic Prefix) size (e.g., 7 symbols for<br>
1/16 CP) , for a sub-frame including TDM MAP (Time Division<br>
Multiplexing), etc. In FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing)<br>
mode, a total of odd number of symbols may be allocated for<br>
a sub-frame including preamble, a sub-frame including mid-<br>
amble, an irregular sub-frame with other CP size (e.g., 7<br>
symbols for 1/16 CP), a sub-frame including TDM MAP, etc.<br>
Although STBC is not suitable for many sub-frame<br>
configurations, SFBC (Spatial Frequency Block Coding) can<br>
support all the sub-frame configurations. Therefore, as<br>
discovered by the present inventors, a need has arisen to<br>
create a structure for the minimum unit for forming a DRU<br>
for replacing STBC by SFBC or to support both STBC and SFBC,<br>
in consideration of diversity gain performance.<br>
[Disclosure of Invention]<br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
The technical problem to be solved by the present<br>
invention concerns how to decide the size of the minimum<br>
unit for forming a DRU provides strong diversity gain and<br>
that supports a SFBC MIMO operations and to transmit the<br>
DRUs.<br>
[Technical Solution)<br>

includes n1 pilots allocated in accordance with a<br>
predetermined pilot allocation scheme, the remaining Ldru<br>

renumbered in order, from 0 to LDRU (Psc - n1) - 1, with<br>
logically contiguous renumbered subcarriers being grouped<br>
into LDRU • Lpair,1 tone pairs and the tone pairs being<br>
renumbered 0 to LDRU • Lpair,1 -1, and the logically<br>

a predetermined permutation formula applied to be permuted<br>
and mapped into ith distributed LRUs, where i = 0, 1,...,<br>
Ldru-1- Ldru = number of DRUs, Psc = number of subcarriers<br>
within an OFDMA symbol in the PRU, Lpair,1 = (Psc - n1)/2.<br>

the number of data subcarrier-pairs in the 1-th OFDMA<br>
symbol within a PRU and is equal to Lsc,1/2 (LSP,1 = Lsc,1/2).<br>
The renumbered subcarrier pairs in the 1-th OFDMA symbol<br>
are denoted by RSPFPi,1[u] that equals {SC_DRUFPi[j],1[2v],<br>

[Mode for Invention]<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The detailed<br>
description, which will be given below with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings, is intended to explain exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention, rather than to show<br>
the only embodiments that can be implemented according to<br>
the invention. The following detailed description includes<br>
specific details in order to provide a thorough<br>
understanding of the present invention. However, it will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art that the present<br>
invention may be practiced without such specific details.<br>
For example, the following description will be given<br>
centering on specific terms, but the present invention is<br>
not limited thereto and any other terms may be used to<br>
represent the same meanings.<br>
A DRU comprises sub-carriers spread across a resource<br>
allocation region. Although the minimum unit for forming<br>
the DRU may equal to one sub-carrier or a fraction of the<br>
DRU, the optimum size of the minimum unit may differ<br>
according to possible resource configurations. Hereinafter<br>
in this document, (x, y) denotes the size of a resource<br>
unit consisting of 'x' sub-carriers and 'y' OFDMA symbols.<br>
When deciding a size of a MRU constituting a DRU,<br>
diversity gain issue should be taken into consideration. A<br>
smaller "minimum DRU forming unit (Minimum-Resource Unit;<br>
MRU) " is preferred to a larger minimum DRU forming unit<br>
because a smaller minimum DRU forming unit can achieve<br>
larger diversity gain than the larger minimum DRU forming<br>
units.<br>
Meanwhile, when deciding a size of the MRU, the ability<br>
to support SFBC should be taken into consideration for<br>
those sub-frame configurations where STBC is not suitable<br>
for data transmission. For these sub-frame configurations,<br>
it is advantageous to use SFBC in place of STBC. Generally,<br>
at least two sub-carriers should be contiguous in order to<br>
replace STBC by SFBC, or to support both STBC and SFBC, or<br>
to support all the other sub-frame configurations.<br>
Considering the matters discussed above, the minimum<br>
DRU forming units introduced by the present invention may<br>
include two or more sub-carriers. Hereinafter, embodiments<br>
according to the present invention are described.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
DRU comprises 'k' MRUs. A MRU of a DRU may have a size of<br>
(2n, Nsym) if the size of PRU is (Psc, Nsym) , where 'PSc'<br>
denotes the number of sub-carriers constituting the DRU,<br>
'Nsym' denotes the number of symbols constituting the DRU,<br>
Psc equals to k*2n, '2n' represents the number of sub-<br>
carriers constituting the MRU, 'k' is a natural number<br>
denoting the number of MRUs included in the DRU, and 'n' is<br>
a natural number. With this MRU configuration, SFBC can be<br>
supported with the simplest permutation rule.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates exemplary DRU structures according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The exemplary DRU illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2 consists<br>
of 18 sub-carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols; in other words, the<br>
size of the DRU is (18, 6). The DRU consists of nine (9)<br>
MRUs (k=9). The size of each MRU is (2, 6).<br>
The exemplary DRU illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2 consists<br>
of 18 sub-carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols; in other words, the<br>
size of the DRU is (18, 6) . The DRU is comprised of three<br>
(3) MRUs (k=3). The size of each MRU is (6, 6).<br>
For the structures of Fig. 2, permutation may be<br>
conducted in units of 6 symbols. However, it should be<br>
noted that the permutation can be conducted in any units of<br>
symbols.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the size of a DRU is (PSc, Nsym) and the size of<br>
a MRU is (2n, 2m), where 'Psc' denotes the number of sub-<br>
carriers constituting the DRU, 'Nsym' denotes the number of<br>
symbols constituting the DRU, '2n' represents the number of<br>
sub-carriers constituting the MRU, '2m' represents the<br>
number of symbols constituting the MRU, 'n' is an integer<br>
satisfying 1=n=Psc/2, and 'm' is an integer satisfying<br>
1=m=Nsym/2. With this MRU configuration, two-dimensional<br>
permutation can support both SFBC and STBC.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an exemplary DRU structure according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the DRU consists of 18 sub-<br>
carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols; in other words, the size of<br>
the DRU is (18, 6). The size of a MRU constituting the DRU<br>
is (2, 2). For the case of Fig. 3, 'm' and 'n' equal to '1',<br>
respectively.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the size of a DRU is (Psc, Nsym), and the size of<br>
a MRU is (2n, 1), where 'Psc' denotes the number of sub-<br>
carriers constituting the DRU, 'Nsym' denotes the number of<br>
symbols constituting the DRU, '2n' represents the number of<br>
sub-carriers constituting the MRU, PSc equals to k*2n, 'n'<br>
is a natural number, and 'k' is a natural number denoting<br>
the number of MRUs included in an OFDMA symbol of the DRU.<br>
With this MRU configuration, two-dimensional permutation<br>
can support both SFBC and STBC.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary DRU structure according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the DRU consists of 18 sub-<br>
carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols; in other words, the size of<br>
the DRU is (18, 6) . The size of a MRU constituting the DRU<br>
is (2, 1). For the case of Fig. 4, 'n' equals to '1'.<br>
According to the present invention, MRU allocation can<br>
be performed before pilot allocation or after pilot<br>
allocation.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
all of the MRUs include two sub-carriers which are<br>
contiguous both in the physical and logical domain, on the<br>
condition that pilots are two-tone-wise paired.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates an exemplary DRU structure according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5 shows that every pilot symbol is paired with<br>
another pilot symbol on a physical resource structure, and<br>
all of the MRUs have the same size accordingly. From Fig. 5,<br>
it can be easily understood that a MRU can be allocated to<br>
a DRU or a set of DRUs both before and after pilot<br>
allocation (i.e., irrespective of allocation order of data<br>
sub-carriers and pilot sub-carriers).<br>
According to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, at least part of the MRUs consists of two sub-<br>
carriers which are logically contiguous but not necessarily<br>
physically contiguous for the situation where pilots are<br>
not two-tone-wise paired. If pilots are not two-tone-wise<br>
paired, two (2) sub-carriers constituting a MRU may or may<br>
not be contiguous on a physical frequency domain, although<br>
the two (2) sub-carriers are contiguous on a logical<br>
frequency domain.<br>
Fig. 6A illustrates another exemplary DRU structure<br>
according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 6A shows that at least some pilot symbols are not<br>
paired with another pilot symbol. Therefore, there may be<br>
physical disconnection between two (2) data sub-carriers<br>
constituting a MRU.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the permutation rule for each 1th OFDMA symbol in a sub-<br>
frame is as follows, supposing that there are 'Ldru' LRUs<br>
(Logical Resource Units) in a distributed group (refer to<br>
Fig. 6B):<br>
For each 1th OFDMA symbol in the subframe:<br>
Step S1) Allocate the n1 pilots within each PRU;<br>
Step S2) Renumber the remaining<br>
Ldru · ( Psc — n1)<br>
data subcarriers in order, from 0 to LDRU (Psc - n1)-<br>
1. Group these contiguous and logically renumbered<br>
subcarriers into LDRU • Lpair,1 pairs and renumber them<br>
from 0 to LDRU • Lpair,1 - 1;<br>
Step S3) Logically map contiguous tone-pairs [i •<br>
Lpair.ir (i + 1) • Lpair,]. - 1] into the ith distributed<br>
LRUs, i=0,l,..., LDRU -1 by applying a predetermined<br>
subcarrier permutation formula .<br>
For an sth distributed LRU of a tth subframe, the<br>
predetermined subcarrier permutation formula is given by:<br>
pair (s, m, 1, t) = LDru ' f(m,s) + g(PermSeq(), s,<br>
m, 1, t),<br>
where 1 = 0,1,..., Nsym-1,<br>
where pair (s, m, 1, t) is the tone-pair index of<br>
the mth tone pair (0
(0
subframe; t is the subframe index with respect to the<br>
frame, 5 is the distributed LRU index (0
the tone pair index within the 1th OFDMA symbol, and<br>
PermSeqO is a permutation sequence generated by a<br>
predetermined function or lookup table.<br>
For the exemplary DRUs of Fig. 6A, 'LDRU, FPi' equals to<br>
'6', 'n/ equals to '2', and 'PSc' equals to '18'.<br>
Accordingly, the permutation rule can be rewritten for Fig.<br>
6 as follows:<br>
1. Allocate 2 pilots in each OFDMA symbol within each<br>
PRU.<br>
2. Renumber the remaining 6*(18-2)=96 data sub-carriers<br>
in order, from index 0 to index [6*(18 - 2)-l]=95.<br>
3. The contiguous renumbered sub-carriers are grouped<br>
into [6*(18 - 2)]/2 = 48 pairs/clusters to support SFBC.<br>
4. Apply the permutation sequence PermSeq()for<br>
pairs/clusters.<br>
The concept of above described examples of Fig. 5 and<br>
Fig. 6 can be extended and generalized for a larger size of<br>
MRU. That is, if a pilot design meets the following<br>
conditions; 1) pilots are paired into 2n contiguous sub-<br>
carriers (n=1, 2, ...) and 2) the number of remaining data<br>
sub-carriers after pilot allocation is always paired into<br>
2n contiguous sub-carriers (n=1, 2, ...) ; then, a MRU<br>
consists of both physically and logically contiguous sub-<br>
carriers irrespective of allocation order. On the other<br>
hand, if pilot does not satisfy the conditions above, then,<br>
a MRU consists of logically contiguous sub-carriers after<br>
allocating pilot symbols, but it is not guaranteed that a<br>
MRU consist of physically contiguous sub-carriers. That is,<br>
two data sub-carriers of a MRU after pilot allocation<br>
sometimes are not physically contiguous (they might be<br>
split only by a pilot symbol). However, these physically<br>
split subcarriers may be logically joined as a single MRU.<br>
According to the present invention, a basic PRU may<br>
consist of one or more MRUs which are adjacent to each<br>
other in frequency axis or adjacent in time axis.<br>
Distributed allocation is supported in frequency axis when<br>
a basic PRU is divided along with frequency axis; on the<br>
other hand, distributed allocation is supported in time<br>
axis when a basic PRU is divided along with time axis. In<br>
the case that a basic PRU is divided into one or more MRUs<br>
which are adjacent to each other in time axis, MIMO<br>
(Multiple Input Multiple Output) methods such as SFBC/STBC<br>
are easy to implement because each of the MRUs has enough<br>
length in frequency axis accordingly. Preferably, a basic<br>
PRU may consist of 18 sub-carriers in frequency axis. In<br>
this case, each of the one or more MRUs may consist of even<br>
number of sub-carriers. Hereinafter, embodiments of the<br>
present invention will be described supposing that a basic<br>
PRU consists of 18 sub-carriers in frequency axis. However,<br>
it should be noted that the present invention is not<br>
limited by a specific number of sub-carriers constituting a<br>
basic PRU. In this application, the term 'sub-<br>
channelization' means the procedure of dividing a basic PRU<br>
into one or more MRUs or the resultant resource structure<br>
of a basic PRU consisting of one or more MRUs.<br>
Sub-frames may be classified into regular sub-frames<br>
and irregular sub-frames according to the number of OFDMA<br>
symbols constituting a sub-frame. A regular sub-frame may<br>
consist of 6 OFDMA symbols and an irregular sub-frame may<br>
consist of 5 or 7 OFDMA symbols. Preferably, a basic PRU of<br>
the regular sub-frame may consist of 18 sub-carriers by 6<br>
OFDMA symbols; on the other hand, a basic PRU of the<br>
irregular sub-frame may consist of 18 sub-carriers by 5 or<br>
7 OFDMA symbols, respectively. In this case, a MRU<br>
constituting the basic PRU may consist of 'x' sub-carriers<br>
and 'y' OFDMA symbols, wherein 'x' is an integer value<br>
ranging from 1 to 18, and 'y' is the total number of OFDMA<br>
symbols contained in a sub-frame or a divisor of the total<br>
number of OFDMA symbols contained in a sub-frame,<br>
irrespective of the type of the sub-frame. A MRU may<br>
consist of pilot, data, and control sub-carrier. It should<br>
be noted that the present invention is not limited by the<br>
number of sub-carriers constituting a basic PRU.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention,<br>
a basic PRU may be divided into '18/x' MRUs in frequency<br>
axis to support distributed allocation scheme. 'x' may<br>
preferably have a value of two (2). If x=1, which leads to<br>
namely "tone-wise sub-channelization," it is difficult to<br>
implement SFBC. Therefore, for SFBC, it is required to pair<br>
two (2) sub-carriers as one unit. In other words, a basic<br>
PRU may preferably consist of 9 (= 18/2) MRUs, each of which<br>
consists of 2 sub-carriers (i.e., x=2) to support<br>
distributed allocation scheme.<br>
SFBC is applicable for a system supporting irregular<br>
sub-frames where implementing STBC is not feasible. However,<br>
in SFBC mode, distributed allocation scheme is difficult to<br>
implement when tone-wise sub-channelization (i.e., x=l) is<br>
adopted due to data sub-carrier pairing problem which is an<br>
inherent in SFBC. Therefore, according to the some<br>
embodiments of the present invention, 'x' may preferably<br>
have a value of 2, 3, 6, 9, or 18, and accordingly, the<br>
number of MRUs in a basic PRU may become 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1<br>
for distributed allocation in the condition that all the<br>
MRUs forming the basic PRU have the same size. However, in<br>
case that all of the MRUs forming a basic PRU do not<br>
necessarily have the same size, 'x' may have any integer<br>
value ranging from 2 to 18.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a structure of a MRU for a basic PRU<br>
of regular sub-frame according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a basic PRU preferably consists of<br>
18 sub-carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols, and a MRU consists of 6<br>
sub-carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols. Therefore, the basic PRU<br>
of size (18, 6) consists of three (3) of the MRU of size (6,<br>
6) which are adjacent to each other in frequency axis.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, it is shown that a MRU consists of 36<br>
tones (= 6*6) . In this document, the term 'tone'<br>
represents a resource specified by 1 sub-carrier by 1 OFDMA<br>
symbol.<br>
On the other hand, if a MRU is designed to have the<br>
size of (9, 6) so that a basic PRU of size (18, 6) consists<br>
of two (2) of the MRUs, sufficient frequency diversity may<br>
not be obtained. To the contrary, if a MRU structure is<br>
designed so that a basic PRU of size (18, 6) consists of<br>
four (4) or more of the MRUs, then overhead and/or the<br>
complexity of the system may be increased. In addition, if<br>
pilots are divided for more than as many as three (3) MRUs<br>
of a PRU, it is not feasible to support SFBC. Therefore,<br>
to optimize system performance when a basic PRU size is (18,<br>
6) , it is preferable to sub-channelize the basic PRU into<br>
three (3) MRUs in frequency axis.<br>
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 illustrate other structures of a MRU<br>
for a basic PRU of irregular sub-frame according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, respectively.<br>
In Fig. 8, the sub-channelization method is same as in<br>
Fig. 7 except that the basic PRU and the MRU consist of 5<br>
OFDMA symbols, respectively.<br>
In Fig. 9, the sub-channelization method is same as in<br>
Fig. 7 except that the basic PRU and the MRU consist of 7<br>
OFDMA symbols, respectively.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8 and Fig. 9, it is shown that a MRU<br>
consists of 30 or 42 tones (= 6*5 or 6*7), respectively.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates another structure of a MRU for a<br>
basic PRU of regular sub-frame according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a basic PRU preferably consists of<br>
18 sub-carriers by 6 OFDMA symbols. The basic PRU consists<br>
of three (3) MRUs which are adjacent to each other in time<br>
axis. All of the three (3) MRUs have the same size of (18,<br>
2) in this embodiment. Referring to Fig. 10, it is shown<br>
that a MRU consists of 36 tones (= 18*2) .<br>
On the other hand, it is possible to divide the basic<br>
PRU of size (18, 6) into two (2) MRUs of size (18, 3).<br>
However, in this case, enough time diversity may not be<br>
obtained. Therefore, to optimize system performance when a<br>
basic PRU size is (18, 6) , it is preferable to sub-<br>
channelize the basic PRU into three (3) MRUs in time axis.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates other structure of a MRU for a<br>
basic PRU of irregular sub-frame according to other<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a basic PRU preferably consists of<br>
18 sub-carriers by 5 OFDMA symbols. The basic PRU consists<br>
of three (3) MRUs which are adjacent to each other in time<br>
axis. Although it is preferable to make all of the three<br>
(3) MRUs in the basic PRU to have the same size, this is<br>
not possible for an irregular sub-frame consisting of five<br>
(5) OFDMA symbols. Therefore, two (2) of the MRUs have a<br>
size of (18, 2) and remaining one (1) of the MRUs has a<br>
size of (18, 1) in this embodiment. Referring to Fig. 11,<br>
it is shown that a MRU consists of 36 or 18 tones (= 18*2<br>
or 18*1), respectively.<br>
On the other hand, it is possible to divide the basic<br>
PRU of size (18, 5) into two (2) MRUs of size (18, 3) and<br>
size (18, 2). However, in this case, enough time diversity<br>
may not be obtained. Therefore, to optimize system<br>
performance when a basic PRU size is (18, 5), it is<br>
preferable to sub-channelize the basic PRU into three (3)<br>
MRUs in time axis like this embodiment.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates another structure of a MRU for a<br>
basic PRU of irregular sub-frame according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a basic PRU preferably consists of<br>
18 sub-carriers by 7 OFDMA symbols. The basic PRU consists<br>
of three (3) MRUs which are adjacent to each other in time<br>
axis. Although it is preferable to make all of the three<br>
(3) MRUs in the basic PRU to have the same size, this is<br>
not possible for an irregular sub-frame consisting of seven<br>
(7) OFDMA symbols. Therefore, two (2) of the MRUs have a<br>
size of (18, 2) and remaining one (1) of the MRUs has a<br>
size of (18, 3) in this embodiment. Referring to Fig. 12,<br>
it is shown that a MRU consists of 36 or 54 tones (= 18*2<br>
or 18*3), respectively.<br>
On the other hand, it is possible to divide the basic<br>
PRU of size (18, 7) into two (2) MRUs of size (18, 4) and<br>
size (18, 3). However, in this case, enough time diversity<br>
may not be obtained. Therefore, to optimize system<br>
performance when a basic PRU size is (18, 7), it is<br>
preferable to sub-channelize the basic PRU into three (3)<br>
MRUs in time axis like this embodiment.<br>
As discussed above, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple<br>
Output) methods such as SFBC/STBC may be implemented with<br>
the MRU structures of Fig. 10, Fig. 11, and Fig. 12 because<br>
each of the MRUs has enough length in frequency axis<br>
accordingly.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
previously described physical resource unit (PRU) is<br>
transmitted by a base station to a mobile station. In<br>
another embodiment, the previously described physical<br>
resource unit (PRU) is transmitted by a mobile station to a<br>
base station.<br>
Fig. 13 is a diagram showing a frame structure<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the system band 1301 is divided<br>
into N number of frequency partitions FP0, FP1, ..., FPi, ...,<br>
FPN-1. The frequency partitions may be used for fractional<br>
frequency reuse or other purposes. Frequency partition FPi<br>
1302 comprises LDRU,FPi number of distributed resource units<br>
DRUFPi[j] (j=0 to LDRU/FPi-1) and/or at least one localized<br>
resource units although not shown in Fig. 13. The time<br>
duration of DRUFPi[j] may be the same as or shorter than the<br>
time duration of a subframe, a plurality of which<br>
constituting a frame. In this embodiment, the time<br>
duration of DRUFPi[j] is the same as or shorter than the<br>
time duration of a subframe. However, it should be<br>
understood that the present invention is also applicable<br>
when the time duration of DRUFPi[j] is shorter than the time<br>
duration of a subframe. t-th subframe and DRUFPi[j] is<br>
comprised of H number of OFDMA symbols. 1-th OFDM symbol<br>
1304 is comprised of total Psc number of subcarriers,<br>
including ni number of pilot subcarriers and Lsc,1 ( = Psc-n1)<br>
number of data subcarriers. Without the n1 number of pilot<br>
subcarriers, 1-th OFDM symbol 1304 can be re-drawn as block<br>
1305. SC_DRUFPi[j],1[n] (n=0, ..., Lsc,1-1) in block 1305<br>
indicates n-th subcarrier of 1-th OFDM symbol of j-th DRU<br>
of i-th frequency partition of the system band.<br>
Fig. 14 is a diagram showing subcarrier-to-DRU mapping<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 14 (b) shows data subcarriers of 1-th OFDM symbol<br>
of the whole DRUs included in frequency partition FPi as<br>
shown in Fig. 14 (a) . Because each DRU includes Lsc,1<br>
number of data subcarriers, frequency partition FPi<br>
includes LDRU,FPi· Lsc,1 number of data subcarriers in total.<br>
The Ldru, fpi • Lsc,1 number of subcarriers are renumbered in<br>
order from index 0 to LDRU,FPi • Lsc,1 -1. Then, these<br>
contiguous and logically renumbered data subcarrier<br>
subcarriers are grouped into LDrU, fpi • LSp, 1 pairs and renumber<br>
them from 0 to LDRU,FPi•LSP,1-1, where Lsp,1= Lsc,1/2. Each<br>
renumbered data subcarrier pair is denoted by RSPFPi,1[u]<br>
that indicates the subcarrier pair with index<br>
{SC_DRUFPi[j],1[2v] , SC_DRUFPi[j],1[2v+1]}, where,<br>
0
Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 illustrate logical domain of the<br>
frame structure according to the present invention. The<br>
paired subcarriers RSPFPi,1[u] may be distributed and mapped<br>
to distributed LRUs of frequency partition FPi by a<br>
predetermined permutation formula. The distributed LRUs,<br>
which correspond to corresponding PRUs in physical domain,<br>
may be exchanged between a base station and a mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the predetermined permutation formula is given by<br>
SC_DRUFPi[j],1[m] = RSPFPi,1[k], and k is LDRU,FPi<br>
•f(m,s)+g(PermSeq(),s,m,l,t) where is the m-th subcarrier<br>
pair in the 1-th OFDMA symbol in the s-th distributed LRU<br>
of the t-th subframe and m is the subcarrier pair index, 0<br>
to LSp,i-l and t is the subframe index with respect to the<br>
frame.<br>
FIG. 15 shows a structure of a wireless communication<br>
system capable of exchanging the data structures of Figs.<br>
2-14, including the method of Fig. 6B. The wireless<br>
communication system may have a network structure of an<br>
evolved-universal mobile telecommunications system (E-UMTS).<br>
The E-UMTS may also be referred to as a long term evolution<br>
(LTE) system. The wireless communication system can be<br>
widely deployed to provide a variety of communication<br>
services, such as voices, packet data, etc.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, an evolved-UMTS terrestrial radio<br>
access network (E-UTRAN) includes at least one base station<br>
(BS) 20 which provides a control plane and a user plane.<br>
A user equipment (UE) 10 may be fixed or mobile, and<br>
may be referred to as another terminology, such as a mobile<br>
station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station<br>
(SS), a wireless device, etc. The BS 20 is generally a<br>
fixed station that communicates with the UE 10 and may be<br>
referred to as another terminology, such as an evolved<br>
node-B (eNB), a base transceiver system (BTS), an access<br>
point, etc. There are one or more cells within the<br>
coverage of the BS 20. Interfaces for transmitting user<br>
traffic or control traffic may be used between the BSs 20.<br>
Hereinafter, a downlink is defined as a communication link<br>
from the BS 20 to the UE 10, and an uplink is defined as a<br>
communication link from the UE 10 to the BS 20.<br>
The BSs 20 are interconnected by means of an X2<br>
interface. The BSs 20 are also connected by means of an S1<br>
interface to an evolved packet core (EPC), more<br>
specifically, to a mobility management entity (MME)/serving<br>
gateway (S-GW) 30. The SI interface supports a many-to-<br>
many relation between the BS 20 and the MME/S-GW 30.<br>
FIG. 16 is a block diagram showing constitutional<br>
elements of a device 50, that can be either the UE or the<br>
BS of Fig. 15, and that is capable of exchanging the data<br>
structures of Figs. 2-14. Device 50 includes a processor<br>
51, a memory 52, a radio frequency (RF) unit 53, a display<br>
unit 54, and a user interface unit 55. Layers of the radio<br>
interface protocol are implemented in the processor 51.<br>
The processor 51 provides the control plane and the user<br>
plane. The function of each layer can be implemented in<br>
the processor 51. The processor 51 may also include a<br>
contention resolution timer. The memory 52 is coupled to<br>
the processor 51 and stores an operating system,<br>
applications, and general files. If device 50 is a UE, the<br>
display unit 54 displays a variety of information and may<br>
use a well-known element such as a liquid crystal display<br>
(LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), etc. The<br>
user interface unit 55 can be configured with a combination<br>
of well-known user interfaces such as a keypad, a touch<br>
screen, etc. The RF unit 53 is coupled to the processor 51<br>
and transmits and/or receives radio signals.<br>
Layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and<br>
the network can be classified into a first layer (L1), a<br>
second layer (L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the<br>
lower three layers of the open system interconnection (OSI)<br>
model that is well-known in the communication system. A<br>
physical layer, or simply a PHY layer, belongs to the first<br>
layer and provides an information transfer service through<br>
a physical channel. A radio resource control (RRC) layer<br>
belongs to the third layer and serves to control radio<br>
resources between the UE and the network. The UE and the<br>
network exchange RRC messages via the RRC layer.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made in the<br>
present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
present invention cover the modifications and variations of<br>
this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
