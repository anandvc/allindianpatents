				<td>GAS CYCLE APPARATUS FOR TIRE VULCANIZER<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a gas cycle apparatus<br>
for a tire vulcanizer.<br>
Background Art<br>
The tire vulcanizer includes an upper mold, a lower<br>
mold, and a bladder expanding and contracting under the<br>
supply/discharge of a heating gas (steam or the like), and<br>
is configured to press the bladder expanded by the supply of<br>
the steam, against the inner surface of a raw tire set<br>
inside the mold.<br>
In such 	a situation, in order to eliminate the<br>
temperature difference within the bladder, a gas cycle<br>
apparatus arranged to circulate the heating gas is used, as<br>
set forth in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 62-33611.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings, the<br>
conventional gas cycle apparatus includes a bladder 1<br>
expanding and contracting under the supply/discharge of a<br>
heating gas; a gas circulating flow path 2 constituted by<br>
allowing a forward flow path 2a connected to a supply port<br>
10 of the bladder 1 and a return flow path 2b connected to a<br>
discharge port 11 of the bladder 1, to communicate with each<br>
other through a circulation<br><br>
valve 20; a gas feeder 21 (pump) provided in tne gas<br>
circulating flow path 2; and a gas supply flow path 3<br>
connected to the forward flow path 2a; and a gas discharge<br>
flow path 4 connected to the return flow path 2b.<br>
In a state where a gas supply valve 30 and gas<br>
discharge valve 40 are opened and the circulation valve 20<br>
is closed, a heating gas is supplied from the gas supply<br>
flow path 3 to the inside of the bladder 1 to fill it with<br>
the heating gas. Thereafter, the gas supply valve 30 and<br>
gas discharge valve 40 are closed and the circulation valve<br>
20 is opened. Under this situation, the heating gas is<br>
circulated between the gas circulating flow path 2 and the<br>
inside of the bladder 1 by the gas feeder 21.<br>
However, in such a conventional gas cycle apparatus, a<br>
drain of the heating gas liquefied by a heat exchange within<br>
the bladder 1 undesirably flows in the gas circulating flow<br>
path 2,<br>
When the drain of the heating gas flows in the gas<br>
circulating flow path 2, an excessive load is applied to the<br>
gas feeder 21 of the gas cycle apparatus, so that it becomes<br>
difficult to increase the circulation flow rate of the<br>
heating gas.<br>
This has caused a problem in that the temperature<br>
difference eliminating capacity in the bladder 1 decreases,<br>
and the tire vulcanizing time increases, resulting in the<br><br>
reduction in production capacity of tires.<br>
The present invention has been made for solving the<br>
above-described conventional problem. For this purpose, an<br>
air-water separation section is provided in the gas<br>
circulating flow path, and the drain of the liquefied<br>
heating gas is stored in this air-water separation section,<br>
whereby said drain is prevented from flowing in the gas<br>
circulating flow path.<br>
This inhibits an excessive load by the drain from being<br>
applied to the gas feeder of the gas cycle apparatus, and<br>
thereby increases circulating flow rate of the heating gas.<br>
As a result, the temperature difference eliminating<br>
capacity in the bladder is improved and the tire vulcanizing<br>
time is shortened. Herewith, the present invention aims to<br>
provide a gas cycle apparatus for a tire vulcanizer, capable<br>
of enhancing the production capacity of tires.<br>

Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic explanatory view of a gas cycle<br>
apparatus for a tire vulcanizer, according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic explanatory view of a<br>
conventional gas cycle apparatus for a tire vulcanizer.<br><br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment according to the present<br>
invention will be described with respect to the drawings.<br>
The specific construction of the present invention is not<br>
limited by the following embodiment.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic explanatory view of a gas cycle<br>
apparatus for a tire vulcanizer, according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The tire vulcanizer includes upper and lower molds (not<br>
shown), and a bladder 1 expanding and contracting under the<br>
supply/discharge of a heating gas, and is configured so as<br>
to perform vulcanization molding while holding a raw tire,<br>
by pressing the bladder 1 expanded by the supply of the<br>
heated gas (high-temperature and high-pressure steam, or the<br>
like), against the inner surface of the raw tire set inside<br>
the mold.<br>
A gas circulating flow path 2 is connected to the<br>
bladder 1.<br>
This gas circulating flow path 2 is constituted by<br>
allowing a forward flow path 2a connected to a supply port<br>
10 of the bladder 1 and a return flow path 2b connected to a<br>
discharge port 11 of the bladder 1, to communicate with each<br>
other through a circulation valve 20. A pump 21 serving as<br>
a gas feeder is provided in the gas circulating flow path 2.<br>
Here, the pump 21 may be provided in the return flow<br><br>
path 2b as in the embodiment, or alternatively, may be<br>
provided in the forward flow path 2a.<br>
A gas supply flow path 3 having a gas supply valve 30<br>
is connected to the forward flow path 2a, and a gas<br>
discharge flow path 4 having a gas discharge valve 40 is<br>
connected to the return flow path 2b.<br>
An air-water separation section 5 is provided on the<br>
way through the return flow path 2b in the gas circulating<br>
flow path 2; the return flow path 2b is connected to an<br>
upper space 5a of the air-water separation section 5, and<br>
the gas discharge flow path 4 is connected to a lower space<br>
5b of the air-water separation section 5.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, an auxiliary air-water<br>
separation section 6 is provided on the way through the<br>
forward flow path 2a in the gas circulating flow path 2; the<br>
forward flow path 2a is connected to an upper space 6a of<br>
the auxiliary air-water separation section 6; and the gas<br>
supply flow path 3 is connected to a lower space 6b of the<br>
air-water separation section 6.<br>
Making allowance for a possible amount of drain of<br>
the liquefied heating gas, the capacity of each of the air-<br>
water separation section 5 and auxiliary air-water<br>
separation section 6 is set so that each of the lower spaces<br>
5b and 6b is formed as a drain chamber, and each of the<br>
upper chambers 5a and 6a is formed as a gas distribution<br>
chamber.<br><br>
When the gas supply valve 30 and gas discharge valve 40<br>
are opened with a raw tire being set inside the mold, and<br>
the heating gas is supplied from the gas supply flow path 3<br>
with the circulation valve 20 being closed, the heating gas<br>
flows inside the bladder 1. With the bladder 1 being filled<br>
with the heating gas, the gas supply valve 30 and gas<br>
discharge valve 40 are closed.<br>
After the bladder 1 has been filled with the heating<br>
gas, the gas circulating flow path 2 is open by releasing<br>
the circulation valve 20, and thereby a closed circulating<br>
circuit is fo2:med between the gas circulating flow path 2<br>
and the inside; of bladder 1.<br>
In this state, the pump 21 is operated to circulate the<br>
heating gas between the gas curculating flow path 2 and the<br>
inside of the bladder 1. The circulation of the heating gas<br>
allows the temperature difference inside the bladder 1 to be<br>
eliminated.<br>
At this time, the heating gas, which is circulating, is<br>
partly liquefied to thereby become a drain due to a heat<br>
exchange within the bladder 1, and this drain undesirably<br>
flows in the gas ci.rculating flow path 2 .<br>
Under this situation, when the heating gas including<br>
the drain of the liquefied heating gas is discharged from<br>
the return flow path 2b and flows into the air-water<br>
separation section 5, the drain is stored in the lower space<br><br>
5b serving as a drain chamber, of the air-water separation<br>
section 5.<br>
Since the return flow path 2b is connected to the upper<br>
space 5a of the air-water separation section 5, the heating<br>
gas, which has separated the drain in the air-water<br>
separation section 5 as described above, passes through the<br>
gas distribution chamber just as it is, and continues<br>
circulating in the gas circulating flow path 2.<br>
Here, the drain of liquefied heating gas, generated by<br>
the heat exchange within the bladder 1 can possibly flow<br>
back in the forward flow path 2a from the supply port 1(3.<br>
However, in this embodiment, the drain that has flowed back<br>
can be stored in the lower space 6b serving as the drain<br>
chamber, of the auxiliary air-water separation section 6.<br>
While circulating the heating gas as described above,<br>
the raw tire is subjected to vulcanization molding.<br>
After having completed this vulcanization molding, in a<br>
state where the circulation valve 20 and gas discharge valve<br>
40 are opened and the gas supply valve 30 is closed, the<br>
pump 21 is operated. Thereby, the heating gas filling the<br>
inside of the bladder 1 and the gas circulating flow path 2<br>
can be discharged from the gas discharge flow path 4, and<br>
simultaneously the drain stored in the air-water separation<br>
section 5 can be discharged from the gas discharge flow path<br>
4.<br><br>
Next, in a state where the circulation valve 20 and gas<br>
supply valve 30 are opened and the gas discharge valve 4 0 is<br>
closed, the pump 21 is operated. Thereby, the drain stored<br>
in the auxiliary air-water separation section 6 can be<br>
discharged from the gas supply flow path 3.<br>
In the present invention, the gas circulating flow path<br>
2 may be provided with a heating unit.<br>
As this heating unit, a steam jacket or electrothermal<br>
heater is used. Heating the heating gas in the gas<br>
circulating flow path 2 by the heating unit allows the<br>
prevention of the temperature drop and pressure drop of the<br>
heating gas. The installation position of the heating unit<br>
may be any place as long as the place is located on the way<br>
through the gas circulating flow path 2.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, since the gas cycle apparatus for a<br>
tire vulcanizer, according to the present invention has an<br>
air-water separation section provided on the way through the<br>
return flow path in the gas circulating flow path, the drain<br>
of liquefied heating gas can be stored in this air-water<br>
separation section.<br>
Therefore, since the said drain does not flow in the<br>
gas circulating flow path, the gas feeder of the gas cycle<br>
apparatus can be prevented from being subjected to an<br>
excessive load by the drain. Therefore, energy<br>
conventionally consumed for circulating the drain can be<br><br>
used exclusively for circulating the heating gas, thereby<br>
allowing the circulation amount of heating gas to be<br>
increased.<br>
This makes it possible to improve the temperature<br>
difference eliminating capacity, shorten the tire<br>
vulcanizing time, and enhance the production capacity of<br>
tires.<br>
Also, since the gas cycle apparatus for a tire<br>
vulcanizer, according to the present invention has an<br>
auxiliary air-water separation section provided on the way<br>
through the forward flow path in the gas circulating flow<br>
path, the drain of liquefied heating gas, that has been<br>
flowed back from the supply port of the bladder can be<br>
stored by this auxiliary air-water separation section.<br>
Thus, by the use of the air-water separation section<br>
and auxiliary air-water separation section, the defect of<br>
the drain flowing in the gas circulating flow path can be<br>
substantially perfectly eliminated.<br><br>
