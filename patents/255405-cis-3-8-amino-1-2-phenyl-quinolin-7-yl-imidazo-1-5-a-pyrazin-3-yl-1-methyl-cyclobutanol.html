TTTLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
6,6-BICYCLIC RING SUBSTITUTED HETEROBICYCLIC PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 60/559,250 filed 02 April 2004.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1]	The present invention is directed to novel heterobicyclic compounds, then-<br>
salts, and compositions comprising them. In particular, the present invention is directed to novel heterobicyclic compounds that inhibit the activity of tyrosine kinase enzymes in animals, including humans, for the treatment and/or prevention of various diseases and conditions such as cancer.<br>
[2]	Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are enzymes that catalyse the phosphorylation<br>
of specific tyrosine residues in various cellular proteins involved in regulation of cell<br>
proliferation, activation, or differentiation (Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron 9:383-<br>
391). Aberrant, excessive, or uncontrolled PTK activity has been shown to result in<br>
uncontrolled cell growth and has been observed in diseases such as benign and malignant<br>
proliferative disorders, as well as having been observed in diseases resulting from an<br>
inappropriate activation of the immune system (e.g., autoimmune disorders), allograft<br>
rejection, and graft vs. host disease. In addition, endothelial-cell specific receptor PTKs such<br>
as KDR and Tie-2 mediate the angiogenic process, and are thus involved in supporting the<br>
progression of cancers and other diseases involving inappropriate vascularization (e.g.,<br>
diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration,<br>
psoriasis, arthritis, retinopathy of prematurity, infantile hemangiomas).<br>
[3]	Tyrosine kinases can be of the receptor-type (having extracellular,<br>
transmembrane and intracellular domains) or the non-receptor type (being wholly intracellular). The Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors with at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies having diverse biological activities. The RTK family includes receptors that are crucial for the growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types (Yarden and Ullrich, Ann. Rev, Biochem. 57:433-478, 1988; Ullrich and Schlessinger, Cell 61:243-254,1990). The intrinsic function of RTKs is activated upon hgand binding, which results in phosphorylation of the receptor and multiple cellular substrates, and subsequently results in a variety of cellular responses (Ullrich &amp; Schlessinger, 1990, Cell 61:203-212). Thus, RTK mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (hgand), typically followed by receptor dimerization, stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and receptor trans-<br><br>
phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that facilitate a corresponding cellular response such as cell division, differentiation, metabolic effects, and changes in the extracellular microenvironment (Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron 9:1-20).<br>
[4]	Malignant cells are associated with the loss of control over one or more cell<br>
cycle elements. These elements range from cell surface receptors to the regulators of transcription and translation, including the insulin-like growth fectors, insulin growth factor-I (IGF-1) and insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-2) (M.J. Ellis, "The Insulin-Like Growth Factor Network and Breast Cancer", Breast Cancer, Molecular Genetics, Pathogenesis and Therapeutics, Humana Press 1999). The insulin growth factor system consists of families of ligands, insulin growth factor binding proteins, and receptors.<br>
[5]	A major physiological role of the IGF-1 system is the promotion of normal<br>
growth and regeneration. Overexpressed IGF-1R (type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor) can initiate milogenesis and promote ligand-dependent neoplastic transformation. Furthermore, IGF-1R plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of the malignant phenotype.<br>
[6]	IGF-1R exists as a heterodimer, with several disulfide bridges. The tyrosine<br>
kinase catalytic site and the ATP binding site are located on the cytoplasmic portion of the<br>
beta subunit. Unlike the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, no mutant oncogenic forms<br>
of the IGF-1R have been identified. However, several oncogenes have been demonstrated to<br>
affect IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression. The correlation between a reduction of IGF-1R<br>
expression and resistance to transformation has been seen. Exposure of cells to the mRNA<br>
antisense to IGF-1R RNA prevents soft agar growth of several human tumor cell lines.<br>
[7]	Apoptosis is a ubiquitous physiological process used to eliminate damaged or<br>
unwanted cells in multicellular organisms. Misregulation of apoptosis is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. The failure of apoptotic cell death has been implicated in various cancers, as well as autoimmune disorders. Conversely, increased apoptosis is associated with a variety of diseases involving cell loss such as neurodegenerative disorders and AIDS. As such, regulators of apoptosis have become an important therapeutic target It is now established that a major mode of tumor survival is escape from apoptosis. IGF-1R abrogates progression into apoptosis, both in vivo and in vitro. It has also been shown that a decrease in the level of IGF-1R below wild-type levels<br><br>
causes apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo. The ability of IGF-IR disruption to cause apoptosis appears to be diminished in normal, non-tumorigenic cells.<br>
[8]	Inappropriately high protein kinase activity has been implicated in many<br>
diseases resulting from abnormal cellular function. This might arise either directly or indirectly by a failure of the proper control mechanisms for the kinase, related to mutation, over-expression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme; or by an over- or underproduction of cytokines or growth factors participating in the transduction of signals upstream or downstream of the kinase. In all of these instances, selective inhibition of the action of the kinase might be expected to have a beneficial effect.<br>
[9]	IGF-IR is a transmembrane RTK that binds primarily to IGF-1 but also to<br>
IGF-II and insulin with lower affinity. Binding of IGF-1 to its receptor results in receptor oligomerization, activation of tyrosine kinase, intennolecular receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of cellular substrates (major substrates are IRS 1 and She). The ligand-activated IGF-IR induces mitogenic activity in normal cells and plays an important role in abnormal growth.<br>
[10]	Tie IGF-1 pathway in human tumor development has an important role: 1)<br>
IGF-IR overexpression is frequently found in various tumors (breast, colon, lung, sarcoma) and is often associated with an aggressive phenotype. 2) High circulating IGF1 concentrations are strongly correlated with prostate, lung and breast cancer risk Furthermore, IGF-IR is required for establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype in vitro and in vivo (Baserga R. Exp. Cell. Res., 1999,253,1-6). The kinase activity of IGF-IR is essential for the transforming activity of several oncogenes: EGFR, PDGFR, SV40 T antigen, activated Ras, Raf, and v-Src. The expression of IGF-IR in normal fibroblasts induces neoplastic phenotypes, which can then form tumors in vivo. IGF-IR expression plays an important role in anchorage-independent growth. IGF-IR has also been shown to protect cells from chemotherapy-, radiation-, and cytokine-induced apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous IGF-IR by dominant negative IGF-IR, triple helix formation or antisense expression vector has been shown to repress transforming activity in vitro and tumor growth in animal models.<br>
[11]	Many of the tyrosine kinases, whether an RTK or non-receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase, have been found to be involved in cellular signaling pathways involved in numerous disorders, including cancer, psoriasis, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, auto-immune disease, allergy, asthma, transplantation rejection, inflammation, thrombosis, nervous system diseases, and other hyperproliferative disorders or hyper-immune responses. It is desirable to<br><br>
provide novel inhibitors of kinases involved in mediating or maintaining disease states to treat such diseases.<br>
[12]	The identification of effective small compounds that specifically inhibit signal<br>
transduction and cellular proliferation, by modulating the activity of receptor and non<br>
receptor tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, to regulate and modulate abnormal or<br>
inappropriate cell proliferation, differentiation, or metabolism is therefore desirable. In<br>
particular, the identification of methods and compounds that specifically inhibit the function<br>
of a tyrosine kinase essential for angiogenic processes or for the formation of vascular<br>
hyperpermeability leading to edema, ascites, effusions, exudates, macromolecular<br>
extravasation, matrix deposition, and their associated disorders would be beneficial.<br>
[13]	It has been recognized that inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases are useful as<br>
selective inhibitors of the growth of mammaEan cancer cells. For example, Gleevec™ (also known as imatinib mesylate, or STI571), a 2-phenylpyrimidine tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion gene product, was recently approved by the U-S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CML. This compound, in addition to inhibiting BCR-ABL kinase, also inhibits KIT kinase and PDGF receptor kinase, although it is not effective against all mutant isofonns of KIT kinase. In recent clinical studies on the use of Gleevec™ to treat patients with GIST, a disease in which KIT kinase is involved in transformation of the cells, many of the patients showed marked clinical improvement. Other kinase inhibitors show even greater selectively. For example, 'the 4-anilinoquinazoline compound Tarceva™ inhibits only EGF receptor kinase with high potency, although it can inhibit the signal transduction of other receptor kinases, probably because such receptors heterodimerize with the EGF receptor.<br>

of cell proliferation and the diseases and disorders associated with abnormal cell proliferation, many attempts have been made to identify small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

[17]	IGF-1R performs important roles in cell division, development, and<br>
metabolism, and in its activated state, plays a role in oncogenesis and suppression of<br><br>
apoptosis. IGF-1R is known to be overexpressed in a number of cancer cell lines (IGF-1R overexpression is linked to acromegaly and to cancer of the prostate). By contrast, down-regulation of IGF-1R expression has been shown to result in the inhibition of tumorigenesis and an increased apoptosis of tumor cells.<br>

the compositions can be presented as a powder, as granules, as a solution, as a suspension in<br>
an aqueous liquid, as a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water emulsion, or as a water-in-oil<br>
liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compound<br>
represented by Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may also be<br>
administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices. Tbe compositions may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, such methods include a step of<br>
bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more<br>
necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately<br>
admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both.<br>
The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation.<br>
[898]	Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may include a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, of Formula L lie compounds of Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds.<br>
[899]	The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be, for example, a solid, liquid, or<br>
gas. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are sugar syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, and water. Examples of gaseous carriers include carbon dioxide and nitrogen.<br>
[900]	In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any convenient<br>
pharmaceutical media may be employed. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like may be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; while carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like may be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules<br><br>
are the preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed.<br>
Optionally, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
[901]	A tablet containing the composition of this invention may be prepared by<br>
compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or adjuvants. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent Each tablet preferably contains from about 0.05mg to about 5g of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule preferably containing from about 0.05mg to about 5g of the active ingredient<br>
[902]	For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration to humans<br>
may contain from about 0.5mg to about 5g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about lmg to about 2g of the active ingredient, typically 25mg. 50mg. lOQmg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 500mg, 600mg, 800mg, or lOOOmg.<br>
[903]	Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral<br>
administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Further, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms.<br>
[904]	Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable<br>
use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form, of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage; thus, preferably should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[905]	Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable<br>
for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, dusting powder, or the like. Further, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared, utilizing a compound represented by Formula I of this invention, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by admixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5wt% to about 10wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency.<br>
[906]	Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for<br>
rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid. It is preferable that the mixture forms unit<br>
dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used<br>
in the art The suppositories may be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition<br>
with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in molds.<br>
[907]	In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical<br>
formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including anti-oxidants) and the like. Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient Compositions containing a compound described by Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form.<br>
[908]	Generally, dosage levels on the order of from about O.Olmg/kg to about<br>
150mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated<br>
conditions, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 7g per patient per day. For example,<br>
inflammation, cancer, psoriasis, allergy/asthma, disease and conditions of the immune<br>
Systran, disease and conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), may be effectively<br>
treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50mg of the compound per kilogram of<br>
body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 3.5g per patient per day.<br>
[909]	It is understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
