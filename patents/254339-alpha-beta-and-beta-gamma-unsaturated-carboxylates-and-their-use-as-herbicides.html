certain concentration. A moving belt plant sprayer (maufacturer: Engineer Research Ltd. of UK) was used for spraying (spraying pressure: 1.95kg/cm2; sprying volume: 50ml/m2; belt moving speed: 30cm/s; sprying nozzle: fan-shaped). For postemergence tests, the monocot weed seeds (barnyard grass, foxtail, and crabgrass) and crop seeds (rice, wheat, maize, and soybean)were planted in the growing containers of 100 cm2 size, covered with 1 cm soil and watered. The seeds were watered growed as standard procedure in greenhouse. At the stages of 1.5 leaf of weeds and 2-3 leaf of crops of rice, wheat, maize, and soybean, the test plants with uniform size and stage of development were selected, and treated with the formulation prepared previously. The l%oToween 80 stand water solution without testing compound was used as control. The treated plants were placed in a dry and windy place for drying. The plants were then returned to the greenhouse and growed as standard procedure. The test plants were watered from the bottom of the containers in 48h in order not to wash away the test formulation. Four weeks after application, the state of the plant was evaluated visually. The inhibition effect was the combination results of various damages such as green losing, withered spot, growth block or leaf burn, and which was obtained through comparison with control. Some of the test results are shown in Table 3.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention disclose the alpha-substituted-carbonyloxy-alpha-beta-and/or beta-gamma-unsaturated-carboxylates and their use as herbicides. The said compounds are represented by formulas I and II:<br>
I	ii<br>
wherein<br>
Ri is (C1-C4)alkyl;R2 is hydrogen, (C1-C6)alkyl, (C3-C6)alkenyl, or (C3-C6)alkynyl;<br>
Q is aryl, or substituted aryl; The configuration of the chiral carbon atom labeled "*" is R or S, or their mixture of various ratio. The compounds of this invention possess outstanding herbicidal activity, as well as better crop safety.<br></td>
