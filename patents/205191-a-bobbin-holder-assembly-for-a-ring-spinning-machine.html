Field of invention:<br>
The invention provides a dust free uniform de-creeling bobbin holder assembly for a ring spinning machine.<br>
Prior art:<br>
Ring spinning machines are used to make yarn, in the process of yarn making. The feed material which is in the form of roves, prepared in the previous process called roving is wound on a bobbin.    This bobbin with the roves is hung in the ring spinning machines frame creel with the aid of a bobbin holder assembly and these rovers are fed to the drafting zone of the ring spinning machine to make the yarn.<br>
While feeding the rovers to the drafting zone the rovers have to unwind from the bobbin and this unwinding occurs with some tension. The unwinding tension is the most critical factor for a good bobbin holder as any uncontrolled tension will induce thin places in the yarn which leads to unevenness in the final product. For a good quality of yarn uniformity in the weight per unit length is important. Even a small variation in this weight per unit length of yarn will result in poor appearance of the fabric.<br>
The bobbin holder is designed with a bearing for smooth rotation and with some breaking tension to have uniform feed, The bobbin holder assembly is used in an environment where fine dust particles of cotton or synthetic material with high static charge are floating around. These particles settle in the bearing arrangement of the bobbin holder assembly which creates friction and affects the rotation pattern and the quality of the de-creeling.<br><br>
Also when the roving is de-creeled, the unwinding speed depends on the break spring provided above the thrust housing area. Invariably there would be differences observed in the unwinding speed of the roves between the initial stage of full bobbin to the final stage of unwinding when the roves are completely unwound.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention solves the above-mentioned limitations by developing a dust proof, tension compensated bobbin holder assembly.<br>
The bobbin holder assembly according to the invention is provided with a dust seal made of a flexible material such as silicon rubber and is positioned and fixed over the bearing assembly to prevent the dust entering the bearing assembly of the bobbin holder assembly. The dust seal prevents dust accumulation and enables friction free rotation and uniform de-creeling in the bobbin holder assembly and thereby improving the final fabric quality.<br>
When a new bobbin containing roves is loaded in the bobbin holder assembly, the load bearing spring will get compressed and the thrust unit will come down, which in turn releases the compression of the breaking spring, which in turn reduces the winding resistance. When the bobbin containing the roves is getting emptied the load bearing spring starts expanding proportionate to the weight loss causing more breaking to the break spring which in turn increases the winding resistance. The process would result in better uniformity in de-creeling and increase the consistency of the yarn quality. Brief description of the drawings:<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the longitudinal cross sectional view of the conventional bobbin holder assembly.<br>
Figure 2 shows the longitudinal cross sectional view of the dust free bobbin holder assembly according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows the longitudinal cross sectional view of the dust free and load compensated bobbin holder assembly according to the invention in the loaded condition.<br>
Figure 4 shows the longitudinal cross sectional view of the dust free and load compensated bobbin holder assembly according to the invention in the unloaded condition.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
Figure 1 shows the longitudinal cross sectional view of the conventional bobbin holder assembly. A spindle (1) houses an actuator (5). A ratchet (6) and latches (3) are fit inside the actuator (5) may be preferably by ratchet dowels (7) and latch dowels (4). A Z-spring (8) is placed in such a way that it is in a meshing position with the ratchet (6). The spindle also houses a compression spring (18) and is placed in compression with the actuator (5) using a spring cap (10) which seats flush within the grooves provided in the spindle (1).<br>
A thrust housing (9) which comprises a screw (11), that extends outside the thrust housing (9), a thrust pad (21), a bearing gauge (20) that consists of a plurality of grooves to house a plurality of balls (12), The balls (12) sits flush with respect to the thrust pad (21) and the bearing gauge (20). The screw (11) is inserted through the circular holes of the thrust pad (21) and the bearing gauge (20) in the thrust housing<br><br>
(9) extending outwards as seen in figure 1. The spindle (1) assembly and the thrust housing (9) assembly are attached together with the help of grooves present in the thrust housing (9) and protrusions in the spindle (1). A break spring (22) is mounted on a break spring seat (13) and is placed on the top of the thrust housing (9) through the extended screw (11) as shown in the figure 1. An outercap (23) is placed through the screw (11) on top of the break spring (22) such that it compresses the break spring (22). The outer cap is fixed using nuts and washers as shown in figure 1. The conical ring (17) is attached externally to the spindle and its longitudinal movement is arrested by a dowel pin (2) provided at the bottom of the spindle. The bobbin which contains rove is fixed to the latches (3) and it is de-creeled from thereon.<br>
The bobbin holder assembly, as described above, is employed in an environment where fine dust particles are floating around in the mill. These particles are most likely to enter into the thrust housing assembly through the gaps present between the screw (11) and the top of the thrust housing (9), thereby causing blocks and malfunction of the bobbin holder assembly, which adversely affects the quality of yarn produced. These particles are also likely to enter through the gaps between the spindle (1) and the thrust housing (9).<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention incorporates a grommet as a dust seal to eliminate any chances of these dust particles to enter into the bobbin holder assembly.<br>
Figure 2 shows this embodiment in detail. A dust seal (30) is fixed flush in between the break spring seat (13) and the thrust housing (9). The dust seal (30) may be preferably made of high quality synthetic rubber usually nitrite butadiene rubber (NBR) or simply nitrite rubber. The dust seal (30) is made to taper inwardly towards the screw (11) and the thickness as it tapers becomes thin enough to barely touch the<br><br>
screw (11) and does not hinder the free rotation of the screw (11).   Thus the gap is closed and prevents entry of unwanted dust particles.<br>
Also in this embodiment, a spindle cap (25) is attached to the top of the spindle (1) and an O-Ring (26) which may be preferably made of nitrite butadiene rubber (NBR) is fixed above the spindle cap (25), as shown in the Section B of figure 2. This arrangement also prevents the dust particles from entering the spindle assembly (9). Thus a smooth dust free operation of the bobbin holder assembly is made possible by this embodiment.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention is shown is figures 3 and 4. A compensating spring (27) is placed on the screw as shown in figures 3 and 4. As explained earlier, the bobbin having the rove is hung from the latch. When the roving is loaded on the bobbin holder assembly the weight causes the compensating spring (27) to compress and the thrust housing unit (9) comes down, which in turn releases the compression of the breaking spring (22). This causes a reduction in winding resistance. When the bobbin gets emptied, the bobbin holder assembly gets unloaded the compensating spring (27) starts expanding proportionate to the weight loss causing an increase in breaking to the break spring which in turn increases the winding resistance. Thus, in the initial loaded condition more force is necessary to pull due to the weight and thereby the breaking is less. As unwinding occurs, the unwinding mass is matched proportionally to the expansion of the compensation spring (27), thereby making the applied friction of the break spring (22) and the unwinding force as constant. This uniformity in de-creeling of the rove due to the compensating spring (27) increases the quality of the yarn produced.<br><br>
While the above is a description of the embodiments of the present invention, further modification may be employed without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. For example, the size, shape and material of the dust seal (30) may be changed as desired. The size of the compensating spring (27) could be different as well. Thus the scope of the invention should not be limited by the structures disclosed. Instead, the true scope of the invention should be determined by the claims.<br><br><br>
