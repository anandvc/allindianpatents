Conveying and lock system<br>
The invention concerns a conveying and lock system for introducing bulk<br>
material to a reactor, with the exclusion of gas, and while preventing gas<br>
exchange at low pressure differences, the system having a housing and a<br>
screw shaft disposed therein which is driven to transport the bulk<br>
material from an entrance opening to an outlet opening in the housing.<br>
In a plurality of preparation processes involving bulk materials, it is<br>
either desirable or technically necessary that the process takes place<br>
without or substantially without air in order to be able to achieve the<br>
desired purpose or such that the amount of air transported along with the<br>
bulk material is reduced to a minimum before the bulk material is subject<br>
to further processing. An example thereof are processes with which high<br>
energy content fuels are generated from plastic waste. Towards this end,<br>
it is important that the plastic pieces or plastic waste which is to be<br>
processed be safely and reliably transported to a reactor, often with large<br>
temperature gradients between the inner region of a storage silo and the<br>
inner region of the reactor, while air which is. trapped in the bulk material<br>
is substantially removed therefrom during transport.<br>
In this connection, double pendulum flap systems or vane cell locks are<br>
known by means of which the above mentioned products can be<br>
transported into a reactor room substantially separated from the<br>
atmospheric side. The double pendulum flap system functions in a<br>
substantially continuous manner and the vane cell lock is continuous.<br>
Both systems are expensive and require extensive processing and control<br>
technology.<br><br>
It is therefore the purpose of the present invention to present a<br>
conveying and lock system which removes gas from the transported bulk<br>
material to the extent that the material contains captured atmospheric<br>
air, wherein the gas phase in a container such as reactor is separated<br>
from the atmospheric gas phase.<br>
This purpose is achieved in accordance with the invention in that the<br>
screw shaft has a section which is free of windings and is disposed, in the<br>
axial direction, between the inlet and the outlet opening and located<br>
between a plurality of first windings in the inlet region and a plurality of<br>
second windings in the outlet region, wherein the first windings have a<br>
bulk material transport capacity which is equal to or larger than that of<br>
the second windings.<br>
The conveying and lock system in accordance with the invention has the<br>
substantial advantage that, in contrast to a double pendulum flap or to a<br>
corresponding vane cell lock, the locked chamber or the locked chambers<br>
must not be evacuated and no special seals are required to seal the<br>
chamber between two pendulum flaps or to seal each individual chamber<br>
of the vane cell lock with respect to atmosphere. In the conventional<br>
systems, the air is removed from the bulk material being transported by<br>
producing a vacuum within the chamber accepting the bulk material.<br>
Before the locked chamber is opened with respect to the inner region of<br>
the reactor, the conventional system must apply vacuum. In the system<br>
in accordance with the instant invention, it is not necessary for a vacuum<br>
to be established within the transport screw, since the bulk material is<br>
compressed in the winding-free section of the transport screw to<br>
generate a bulk material plug. Through establishment of the bulk<br>
material plug, the gas located in the bulk material is pressed out and can<br>
flow out of the conveying and lock system by way of a gas vent opening.<br><br>
The section of the screw shaft which does not have any windings, the so-<br>
called winding-free region, can have different sizes and different axial<br>
lengths, since that region must be adjusted to the bulk material<br>
properties of the bulk material being transported. The diameter of the<br>
housing of the conveying and lock system can be increased or decreased<br>
in a straight forward manner and the axial length of the winding-free<br>
zone can be shortened or lengthened in dependence on the bulk material.<br>
Moreover, complete reconstruction of the overall conveying and lock<br>
system is not necessary in the event that the transport capacity of the<br>
first winding section is adjusted relative to that of the second winding<br>
section. The differing transport capacities of the first and a second<br>
winding sections can be used to determine the degree of compression of<br>
the bulk material plug in the winding-free region of the screw shaft.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first and second<br>
windings have winding flanks which are connected, without openings, to<br>
the screw shaft. This has the advantage that, during transport of the bulk<br>
material in the first as well as in the second winding regions, the free<br>
areas between the windings are completely filled with the bulk material<br>
being transported and the winding flanks in addition to the bulk material<br>
being transported itself, both constitute gas barriers between the<br>
atmosphere and the gas phase inside the reactor region.<br>
The conveying and lock system advantageously has a conical tapering in<br>
the entrance region and, preferentially, a first cylindrical region, a<br>
conically tapered section and a second cylindrical section. This has the<br>
advantage that the bulk material being transported is already<br>
compressed in the first winding region such that a barrier between the<br>
atmosphere and the reactor region is formed even before it gains<br>
entrance to the winding-free section of the transport screw.<br><br>
It is particularly advantageous in the event that the conveying and lock<br>
system has a hollow shaft on which the screw shaft is mounted. For<br>
inventive conveying and lock systems constructed in this manner, it is<br>
very straight forward to replace or exchange screw shafts. The basic<br>
structure of the conveying and lock system remains unchanged and a<br>
new screw shaft is merely introduced onto the hollow shaft.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous when the hollow shaft is sealed with<br>
respect to atmosphere by means of a sliding ring seal, preferably a<br>
double action sliding ring seal. A sealing system of this kind prevents<br>
gas, in this case air, from entering into the reactor region when the<br>
hollow shaft is driven. In the event that reactions or material processes<br>
are carried out within the reactor which must be effected in the absence<br>
of air, the conveying and lock system in accordance with the invention<br>
provides such operating conditions in a manner which is robust and<br>
insensitive to failure.<br>
In the event that the housing of the conveying and lock system is<br>
subdivided in the axial direction a plurality of times, in particular two<br>
times, different screw geometries can be used along the hollow shaft for<br>
the first winding region and for the second winding region. In this<br>
manner, the conveying and lock system in accordance with the invention<br>
can be tailored to widely varying transport properties of a bulk material.<br>
A vent opening is preferential provided in the inlet region on the housing<br>
by means of which gases associated with the compression of the bulk<br>
material during the transport process within in the conveying and lock<br>
system can escape.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the housing of the conveying<br>
and lock system has, at least in the outlet region, a double wall for the<br><br>
passage of a fluid. The conveying and lock system can thereby be cooled<br>
or warmed according to need such that the bulk material can be<br>
transported out of a storage silo and into the reaction region in a safe<br>
and constant fashion.<br>
The temperature of a fluid which is used for cooling or warming the screw<br>
housing is advantageously chosen in such a fashion that the flow<br>
behavior or the bulk material remains substantially unchanged.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, an axially<br>
displaceable rod is provided within the hollow shaft which has a plate at a<br>
free end thereof which closes the output opening in a first end position<br>
thereof and which, in a second end position, completely frees the full<br>
transport capacity of the conveying screw. With this structured<br>
configuration, the bulk material leaving the conveying and lock system<br>
can be compressed one more time by narrowing the output gap between<br>
the plate and the screw windings of the second winding region. Moreover,<br>
radiative heat or cold can be shielded from the bulk material being<br>
transported by means of the plate. In addition, the conveying and lock<br>
system can be blocked by closing the gap between the second winding<br>
region and the associated plate. The overall reliability of the entire<br>
manufacturing process can be thereby increased and, in the event of<br>
failure or malfunction, the conveying and lock system can be completely<br>
closed.<br>
In a further configuration, the end of the hollow shaft facing the plate has<br>
a bellows. By means of the bellows, it is possible to displace the plate in<br>
the hollow shaft in a gas-tight fashion and, thereby prevent gas from<br>
penetrating into and negatively influencing processing in the reaction<br>
region.<br><br>
It can be particularly advantageous when a pipe surrounds the screw<br>
shaft at a separation from the housing in the region of the outlet opening<br>
and projects in a axial direction past the outlet end of the screw shaft.<br>
This measure is advantageous in the event that a temperature is present<br>
in the reactor chamber which strongly differs from the outside<br>
temperature or in the event that the bulk material being transported has<br>
high temperature sensitivity which can influence its transport properties.<br>
In the event that the tube projects past the screw shaft, an additional<br>
cooling or warming function can be effected.<br>
The overall reliability of the entire system can be increased by providing<br>
a pressure sealed blocking element, in particular a gate valve, at the inlet<br>
opening, disposed between a bulk material delivering system and the<br>
inlet opening. In the event of failure, the conveying and lock system can<br>
be sealed in a air tight manner and blocked at this location.<br>
The tube which surrounds the screw shaft at a separation can have a<br>
connecting wall at the output end of the screw shaft which defines an<br>
enclosed region between the tube and the housing of the screw shaft.<br>
This region can thereby be provided with a dedicated insulator.<br>
In a preferred example of an application, the conveying and lock system<br>
can be used to introduce plastic waste as a bulk product into a reactor for<br>
the production of high energy fuels, wherein the screw shaft used for this<br>
purpose has a compression zone in the transport region of the screw<br>
shaft between the inlet and the outlet regions. In the outlet region, the<br>
screw shaft can be displaced to different degrees via a plate and the<br>
output zone is jacketed by a tube which is separated from the housing of<br>
the screw shaft. The tube projects along with the output region into the<br>
reactor, wherein only the tube dips into a fluid surface formed within the<br>
reactor. Should the tube dip below the fluid surface and should the<br><br>
transport region of the screw shaft in the second winding region be separated<br>
from this liquid surface, the tube which surrounds the output region acts as a<br>
protective shield to block radiative heat coming from the reaction process of the<br>
reactor which then only enters into the conveying and lock system to a limited<br>
extent. In this manner, one prevents the plastic waste from already melting in<br>
the entrance region to the reactor, which could block the transport system and<br>
cause disruption thereof. In this fashion, a proper introduction of the plastic<br>
waste into the reactor is guaranteed for long periods of time. The plastic waste<br>
is transported from room temperature into a reactor having processing<br>
temperatures between 200 degrees and 500 degrees. The plastic waste is<br>
introduced into the reactor by means of the conveying and lock system and the<br>
plastic waste thereby transported is not warmed above the melting point of the<br>
individual plastics. In this manner, reproducible and reliable transport<br>
behavior of the plastic waste in the conveying and lock system is guaranteed.<br>
The conveying and lock system is described in greater detail below by way of<br>
examples in the accompanying figures.<br>
Figure 1 is a highly schematic illustration of a conveying and lock system in<br>
according with the invention for transport into a reactor; and<br>
Figure 2 shows a detailed section of a conveying and lock system in accordance<br>
with the invention and compared to the conveying and lock system of figure 1.<br>
Reference symbol 10 of figure 1 depicts a conveying and lock system which is<br>
disposed between a delivery system 12 and a reactor 14. The conveying and<br>
lock system 10 is connected to the delivery system 12 as<br><br>
well as to the reactor 14 in a permanent fashion by means of flange<br>
connections 16 and 18.<br>
Plastic particles or plastic waste in the form of bulk material is introduced<br>
into an inner region 22 of a storage container 24 in the direction of arrow<br>
20. The bulk material is kept in motion within the storage container 24 by<br>
means of a mixer 26 to prevent clumping of the bulk material particles or<br>
plastic shred located in the storage container 24. The mixer 26 is driven<br>
by a motor 28. The storage container 24 has a weighing device 30 for<br>
continuously monitoring delivery to the reactor 14. The weighing device<br>
30 can be used to determine and define the transport capacity of a<br>
transfer screw 32 driven by a motor 34. The bulk material located in the<br>
storage container 24 is introduced to the conveying and lock system 10<br>
by means of a transfer screw 32. A blocking element 36 is disposed<br>
between the transfer screw 32 and the conveying and lock system 10 (in<br>
this case a gate valve) with which the transport flow of bulk material<br>
coming from the storage container 24 into the conveying and lock system<br>
10 can be interrupted.<br>
The conveying and lock system 10 is flanged to the transfer screw 32.<br>
The conveying and lock system 10 has a housing 40 in which a hollow<br>
shaft 42 is borne. The hollow shaft 42 has a screw shaft 44 having first<br>
windings 46 (first winding section) and second windings 48 (second<br>
winding section). A winding-free section 50 (screw-free region) is<br>
disposed between the first windings 46 and the second windings 48.<br>
When a bulk material, in this case plastic particles or plastic shred, is<br>
introduced via the transfer screw 32 into the conveying and lock system<br>
10, the first windings 46 transport the bulk material into the winding-free<br>
section 50. The first windings 46 have thread flanks which extend from<br>
the screw shaft 42 to a proximity of the housing 40. The first windings 46<br><br>
transport the bulk material into the winding-free section 50 where it is<br>
compressed until the entire winding-free section 50 is filled with<br>
compressed bulk material particles, thereby forming a bulk material plug.<br>
During this compression, the gas located between the particles is<br>
expelled and can flow out of the conveying and lock system 10 by means<br>
of vent openings 51. When the winding-free section 50 is completely<br>
filled with bulk material particles, these bulk material particles are<br>
transported into the reactor 40 by means of the second windings 48.<br>
The screw shaft 44 is disposed in a rotationally secure fashion onto the<br>
hollow shaft 42 and can be exchanged if desired.<br>
A rod 52 is disposed in the hollow shaft 42 and has a plate 54 at a free<br>
end thereof facing the reactor 14. An adjustment mechanism can<br>
displace the rod 52 and thereby the plate 54 in the direction of arrow 58.<br>
A gap 60 is formed between the free end of the housing 40 and the plate<br>
54, the width of which can be adjusted by displacing the rod 52. The gap<br>
60 can be completely closed by means of a plate 54 or sufficiently<br>
opened that the product transfer capacity of the second winding 48 into<br>
the reactor 15 is not throttled.<br>
The hollow shaft 42 is driven by a motor 62 and is sealed by a double<br>
action sliding ring seal 64 so that no gas can penetrate into the reactor<br>
region of the reactor 14 in consequence of rotational connections within<br>
the conveying and locking system 10.<br>
A jacket 66 is provided on the housing 40, at least at the outlet end of<br>
the conveying and lock system 10, by means of which the housing 40<br>
and thereby the screw shaft 44 can be cooled or warmed by a fluid. A<br>
tube 68 is attached at the output end of the conveying and lock system<br>
10 at a separation from the jacket 66 and projects in the axial direction<br><br>
of the conveying and lock system 10 and into the reactor 14 past the free<br>
end of the hollow shaft 42 and of the plate 54 and by a further axial<br>
extent than does the plate 54. The tube 68 has a connecting wall 70<br>
between the jacket 66 and the inner wall of tubes 68 so that a closed<br>
region 72 is defined between the jacket 66 and the tube 68. Depending<br>
on the application, the closed region 72 can be filled with an insulating<br>
material or with a cooling or warming medium.<br>
The tube 68 projects in an axial direction past the screw shaft 44 and<br>
dips, with its free end 76 into a liquid surface 74. The tube 68 can shield<br>
radiative heat and prevent it from entering into the transported bulk<br>
material.<br>
The reactor 14 has a mixer 78 which is driven by a motor 80. By means<br>
of the structural features of the conveying and lock system 10, bulk<br>
materials can be transported from atmosphere into a reactor while<br>
preventing gas exchange and the production temperature of the bulk<br>
material can be adjusted in a controlled fashion by means of cooling or<br>
warming elements on the conveying and lock system 10 so that the<br>
transport temperature of bulk material and the conveying and lock<br>
system can be changed to influence the transport properties of the<br>
material being transported or can be kept constant.<br>
Figure 2 shows a detail section of the transport and conveying and lock<br>
system 10. The hollow shaft 42 disposed in the housing 40 is driven by a<br>
motor 62. A screw shaft 44 is disposed on the hollow shaft 42 and, if<br>
necessary, can be exchanged. The screw shaft 44 has first windings 46<br>
and second windings 48. The winding-free section 50 is provided between<br>
the first windings 46 and the second windings 48. A vent opening 51 is<br>
disposed on the housing 40 by means of which gases can flow out of the<br>
housing 40.<br><br>
A rod 52 is disposed in the hollow shaft 42 and has a plate 54. The rod<br>
52 can be displaced in the direction of arrows 58 in a manner not shown.<br>
The hollow shaft 42 is sealed by a sliding seal, in this case, a double<br>
acting sliding seal ring 64. The gap 60 between the free end of the<br>
housing 40 and the plate 54 can be adjusted by displacing the rod 52. If<br>
desired, the plate 55 can be displaced up to the housing 40 so that the<br>
gap 60 can be completely closed. In another adjustment position of the<br>
gap 60, the gap can be sufficiently wide that the plate 54 does not<br>
influence the bulk material transport through the conveying and lock<br>
system 10.<br>
Bulk material particles are transported into the conveying and lock<br>
system 10 in the direction of arrow 82 and are introduced by means of<br>
first windings 46 into the winding-free section 50. The bulk material<br>
particles are compressed in the winding-free section 50 and gases are<br>
simultaneously removed therefrom. The freed gas can escape from the<br>
housing 40 by means of vent openings 51. A product plug is formed in<br>
the winding-free section 50 and can be partially relieved by means of the<br>
second windings 48 when the region in the winding-free sections 50 is<br>
completely filled with the compressed bulk material particles. The bulk<br>
material particles can pass through the gap 60 into a reactor (not shown<br>
in figure 2) in the direction of arrow 84.<br>
The plate 54 is attached to the hollow shaft 42 by means of a bellows 86<br>
so that the plate 54 can be displaced in the direction of arrow 58 by rod<br>
52.<br>
A conveying and lock system 10 for the introduction of a bulk product,<br>
without gas, into a reactor 14 while preventing gas exchange at low<br>
pressure differences, has a screw shaft 44 on which a first winding 46<br><br>
and a second winding 48 are disposed. A winding-free section 50 is<br>
located between the first and the second windings 46, 48 in which the<br>
transported bulk product can be compressed. The compression generates<br>
a bulk product plug which is substantially free of gas and during transport<br>
of the bulk product by means of the screw shaft 44, the bulk product plug<br>
is constantly formed in the conveying and lock system 10 to prevent an<br>
exchange of gas between the product inlet and the product outlet of the<br>
conveying and lock system 10.<br><br>

Abstract<br><br><br>
Title: CONVEYING AND LOCK SYSTEM<br>
A conveying and lock system (10) for introducing a bulk material into a<br>
reactor (14) with exclusion of gas and while preventing gas exchange at<br>
low pressure differences has a screw shaft (44) on which first windings<br>
(46) and second windings (48) are formed. A winding-free section (50) is<br>
disposed between the first and the second windings (46, 48) in which the<br>
conveyed bulk material is compacted. The compacting causes a bulk<br>
material plug which is substantially gas free and, during bulk material<br>
transport, the bulk material plug is constantly formed in the conveying<br>
and lock system (10) by means of the screw shaft (44) to prevent gas<br>
exchange between the product inlet and the product outlet of the<br>
conveying and lock system (10). (Fig. 1)</td>
