				<td>The present invention relates to a dual in line integrated circuit extractor. The novel extractor of the present invention extracts the integrated circuits from the base without damaging the base or the specific component.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a dual in line integrated circuit extraotor. The main embodiment of the device of the present invention resides in the efficiency of the extractor to extract the integrated circuit from the base assembly slowly and in a uniform manner and without damaging the leads of the integrated circuit. The slow, smooth and uniform extraction is a result of uniform pressure and equal gripping strength applied from both sides by the extracting and holding means. The uniform and slow extraction of the integrated circuit is an essential requirement of the extracting device as otherwise it could hamper the activity of such integrated circuit. The device of the present invention is aimed at eliminating the risks of.destroying the integrated circuit including the leads while extracting it from the Integrated Circuit base from static charge.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a dual in line circuit extractor capable of extracting the integrated circuits without damaging the leads of the integrated circuit. The extractor of the present invention comprises of a main central block having means for protecting the integrated circuit from static charges. Further an additional central block is also provided within the device of the present invention having means for holding and extracting the integrated circuit from the electronic device. The main central block and the additional central block are connected through an attachment means. These attachment means essentially comprise of a screw and knob arrangement. The device of the present invention is further provided with a means for regulating the vertical as well as horizontal movement of the extracting, means.<br>
Means for protecting the Integrated Circuit from static charges comprise of electrically conducting side support plates. These electrically conducting plates protect the Integrated circuit from static charges as these plates short all the leads of the Integrated Circuit. The current therefore instead of moving towards the center of the circuit is regulated only around these electrically conducting plates. This is an important and essential requirement of the extractor as otherwise static charge could damage the component during extraction.<br>
The electrically conducting side support plates are affixed along the longitudnal length of the main central block with the help of screws thus playing an important role in preventing the damage to the integrated circuit.<br>
The main central block is further attached to the additional central block by a screw and knob arrangement. The additional central block comprises means for holding and extracting the integrated circuit from the electronic component. These holding and extracting means are a pair of puller arms affixed at the sides of the additional central block. The puller arms have projections at its bottom ends to provide better grip to the component. These projections also help extract the integrated circuit smoothly. The puller arms of the device are bent at the ends preferably at a right angle. These projections support the component while pulling it thereby ensuring uniform extraction.<br>
The screw and knob arrangement of the device of the present invention perform a plurality of functions. This arrangement connects the main central block and the additional central block and with the help of knob of such arrangement-, movement of the holding and extracting means is carried out. As the knob of the extraction device is rotated in a clockwise direction, the puller arms of the device move vertically downwards to a desired height. After reaching the desired height the puller arms diverge outward horizontally. The vertical downward movement is maintained to a particular height and similarly the horizontal movement is also restricted to a particular point. Therefore rotation of the knob in a particular direction if made continually leads to vertical as well as horizontal movement.<br>
The device of the present invention has special means for regulating the vertical as well as horizontal movement of the holding and extracting means. Further these means also regulate the extent of the vertical as well as horizontal movement. The divergence of the puller arms result in increased space between the arms. This divergence is aimed at creating enough space for proper placing of the integrated circuit followed by gripping of the integrated circuit between the puller arms.<br>
Once the integrated circuit is properly placed between the divergent puller arms, it requires gripping. For gripping the integrated circuit between the puller arms, now anti-clockwise rotation of the knob arrangement is carried out. After the puller arms have gripped the integrated circuit for extraction within its projections, any further anti-clockwise rotation leads to uplifting the arms with the integrated circuit placed in between it. The special means for regulating such movement ensure 'that excessive gripping force is not applied on the integrated circuit thus protecting the life of the integrated circuit.<br>
The regulating means of the device of the present invention monitor the movement of the puller arms in horizontal as well as in vertically upwards direction. The gripping strength of the arms is monitored with the help of the regulating means to protect the integrated circuit from suffering extra pressure placed on the integrated circuit. This monitoring of the gripping strengm being applied on the integrated circuit held between puller arms is achieved by regulating the dimensions of the "L" shaped slot according to the dimensions of the integrated circuit. Therefore regulating means of the present invention not only regulates the space provided for the movement of the puller arms but also ensures protection of the integrated circuit placed between the puller arms.<br>
The knob is subjected to two types of motions; the clockwise and anti-clockwise motion. The clockwise motion of the knob performs functions of downward movement and divergence of the puller arms. The anti-clockwise rotation of the knob<br>
performs plurality of functions, i.e., the convergence of the divergent arms followed by lifting up the convergent arms.<br>
The anti-clockwise rotation of the knob results in carrying out a plurality of functions, first being convergence of puller arms and second being pulling up of the integrated circuit held between the puller arms. These functions are successfully carried out and regulated with the help of the regulating means employed in the device of the present invention. The regulating means of the present invention comprises of a pair of "L" shaped slots on the side support plates. The horizontal movement of £he puller arms leading to convergence and divergence of the puller arms is regulated by these "L" shaped slots. The clockwise rotation leading to divergence of the puller arms is due to the horizontal movement of the puller arms within the horizontal portion of the "L" shaped slots. Therefore the divergence of the puller arms and the extent of such divergence is regulated by these "L" shaped slots. The fully divergent puller arms are then so placed that the further anti-clockwise rotation of the knob results in vertical movement of the puller arms, thereby lifting the component within its grips. The vertical movement of the puller arms results in uplifting the component slowly and uniformly. Therefore the novelty of the device of the present invention resides in the regulated and controlled dual movement of the puller arm, i.e., in vertical as well as horizontal direction. The regulated and controlled movement of the puller arms facilitates extraction of the component without effecting the component.<br>
The extraction device of the present invention comprises a main central block from which all the components of the extraction device are connected. The main central block has a screw attachment at the center which connects the knob and the central block II with the main central block. At the longitudinal sides of the main central block two electrically conductive side support plates are connected. At the lateral edges of the main central block are connected a pair of puller arms which have a projection of 2-5 mm at its end. The projections at the end of the puller arms are preferably tangentical to the puller arm. The mechanism of the device of the present invention is centered at the central block II where the inter connections of various parts are centered. At the lateral edges of the central block II are connected a pair of<br>
puller arms which have a projection of 2-5 mm at its end. The central block II is connected to the electrically conducting plates at the center with the help of a screw comprising regulatory mechanism. The regulatory mechanism of the device of the present invention comprises an "L" shaped slot on the side support plates which provides space for the screw arrangement. The "L" shaped slot facilitates the movement of the puller arms within its boundaries. Thus the extent of the movement in vertical as well as horizontal direction is within specified boundaries. When the arms diverge, they move within the horizontal part of the "L" shaped slot and move to the extreme ends of the horizontal portion of such slot. Thus the maximum limit of divergence is the extreme corners of the horizontal portion of the "L" shaped slot.<br>
As they reach the maximum limit, the puller arms can not diverge any further which<br>
is taken to be the limit of divergence. Similarly when the convergence begins, the<br>
puller arms move from the farthest end of the horizontal portion of the "L" shaped<br>
slot and then when they reach the center and if they are provided further rotation, they<br>
*■ move in the vertical position thereby pulling up the component gripped between the<br>
convergent puller arms. This upliftment of the component however, is very slow and<br>
uniform.<br>
Another method of carrying out the present invention is that a lever'arrangement is provided in the device which when pressed leads to the downwards movement of the puller arms in a single jolt. This lever arrangement prevents carrying out of the clockwise rotation of the knob to bring down the uplifted puller arms. To achieve this, the puller arms are provided at their sides with means for pressing them in an inward position. These means are preferably switches made of polymeric material preferably plastic.<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the present invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein figure 1 relates to the extraction device of the present invention. Figure 2 defines the intricate mechanism used for the functioning of the present device.<br>
The present invention can be more clearly understood with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows the extraction device of the present invention. Figure 1 of the present invention clearly shows the main central block ( 1) comprising electrically conductive side plates (2) at its longitudinal ends. The main central block is further attached with the help of a screw (4) to a knob arrangement (5) which connects the main central block with the central block II (3). The central block II (3) is connected from its lateral sides to the puller arms (6).<br>
When the knob (5) on the tool is rotated clockwise, the puller arms (6) move down and then opens sideways. When the knob (5) on the tool is rotated in the anti clockwise direction, the puller arms first moves in a horizontal direction to grip the component such as Integrated Circuits. The gripping of the Integrated Circuits is facilitated by the presence of projections (8) at the ends of the puller arms. When the knob on the tool is rotated further in anti clockwise direction, the puller arms move upwards, extracting the component slowly and uniformly. This movement in horizontal direction followed by the upward movement is controlled by regulatory mechanism comprising "L" shaped slots (6) on the side support plates. These "L" shaped slots facilitate movement of puller arms within its boundaries leading to horizontal as well as vertical movement of the puller arms (2). These "L" shaped slots have been clearly shown in figure 2 where support arm has been unscrewed from one side. Figure 2 also shows the arrangement of central block II with respect to the main central block. As can be seen from figure 2, the main central block is connected to the central block II through a screw attachment. Further the two puller arms are connected to the central block II and these two puller arms are connected to each other through a spring mechanism (7). The puller arms are connected to the main central block and puller arms through screws.<br>
The extent of the convergence and divergence of the puller arms depends on the measurements of the component being extracted which governs the dimensions of the "L" shaped slot to be employed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
