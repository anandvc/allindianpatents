Title of the Invention: METAL CORD, RUBBER-CORD COMPLEX AND<br>
PNEUMATIC TIRE USING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a metal cord and a<br>
rubber-cord complex in which an adhesion reaction layer formed<br>
between a rubber and a brass plated layer of a plated element<br>
wire is specified to thereby suppress deterioration in<br>
adhesiveness between the plated wire and the rubber under a wet<br>
heat environment, and a pneumatic tire using the complex.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a reinforcing element for rubber products such as<br>
pneumatic tires, hoses and industrial belts, a metal cord has<br>
been popularly used from the viewpoints of good reinforcing<br>
effect and the like. In a rubber-cord complex such as a rubber<br>
product reinforced with such a metal cord, the surface of element<br>
wires of the cord is plated with brass containing copper and<br>
zinc in order to enhance the adhesive property of the metal cord<br>
to the rubber. Typically, this brass plating is performed in<br>
such a manner as sequentially forming a copper plated layer and<br>
a zinc plated layer on the surface of an element wire and then<br>
subjecting them to thermal diffusion to give an alloy of the<br><br>
two metals.<br>
It is known that the adhesive property between the brass<br>
plated layer and the rubber is revealedby formation of an adhesion<br>
reaction layer between the brass plated layer and the rubber<br>
through a cross-linking reaction which occurs between copper<br>
in the brass plated layer and sulfur incorporated into the rubber<br>
during vulcanization of the rubber.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Problem to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, although a conventional brass plating has a good<br>
adhesive property in an initial stage after the vulcanization<br>
(initial adhesive property), it tends to be poor in wet heat<br>
adhesive property such that the adhesive property decreases under<br>
a wet heat environment at high temperature and high humidity<br>
and the brass plating is more likely to separate from the rubber.<br>
It is effective for improving the wet heat adhesive property<br>
to add an organocobalt salt to the rubber. However, the<br>
organocobalt salt is expensive, and has a property of making<br>
an unvulcanized rubber apt to deteriorate or thermally<br>
deteriorate. Hence the amount of the organocobalt salt to be<br>
incorporated is limited, so a sufficient increase in wet heat<br>
adhesive property is not achieved thereby.<br>
As other technologies to improve the wet heat adhesive<br>
property are known, for example, a method of suppressing<br><br>
diffusion of copper into rubber, as disclosed in JP-A- 2 003 -096 5 94,<br>
wherein the content of copper in the brass plated layer is limited<br>
to 62% or less to suppress excessive formation of a sulfide at<br>
the interface with the rubber, and a method of suppressing<br>
corrosion reaction and adhesion reaction at the interface with<br>
the rubber, as disclosed in JP-A-2003-094108 and JP-B-1812616,<br>
by plating a ternary alloy of copper, zinc and nickel as a brass<br>
plating. However, in these methods, no investigation about<br>
structure of plated layer (structure of reaction layer) optimum<br>
to improvement of wet heat adhesive property has been made from<br>
the viewpoint of mechanism of wet heat deterioration. As a result,<br>
the effects are limitative and do not reach a practical level.<br>
In view of such circumstances, the present inventors<br>
conducted an intensive study and, as a result, they have found<br>
that the adhesive property under the wet heat environment can<br>
be exhibited on a higher level as compared with a conventionally<br>
achieved adhesive property when the state of irregularity of<br>
the interface between the adhesion reaction layer and the rubber<br>
and the average thickness of the adhesion reaction layer fall<br>
within specific ranges.<br>
Accordingly, a primary object of the present invention<br>
is to provide a rubber-cord complex having a wet heat adhesive<br>
property improved basically by specifying the state of<br>
irregularity of the interface between the adhesion reaction layer<br>
and the rubber and the average thickness of the adhesion reaction<br><br>
layer.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a metal cord suitable for use in the rubber-cord complex and<br>
capable of improving its wet heat adhesive property to a rubber<br>
vulcanized and adhered thereto.<br>
A third object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
pneumatic tire with its durability improved by the use of the<br>
rubber-cord complex as mentioned above.<br>
Means to Solve the Problem<br>
The present invention as claimed in claim 1 is directed<br>
to a rubber-cord complex obtained by vulcanizing a rubber to<br>
adhere it to a metal cord comprising a drawn plated wire prepared<br>
by providing a plated layer of brass containing copper and zinc<br>
on the surface of a metal wire and drawing the resulting plated<br>
wire, wherein:<br>
the rubber-cord complex has an adhesion reaction layer<br>
formed by a cross-linking reaction of sulfur in the rubber and<br>
copper in the brass plated layer, between the rubber and the<br>
brass plated layer, and<br>
in the wet heat deterioration state of the metal cord to<br>
which the rubber has been vulcanized and bonded and which has<br>
been held in an atmosphere having a temperature of 50 to 100Â°C<br>
and a humidity of 6 0 to 100% for one hour to 2 0 days, the average<br>
thickness of the adhesion reaction layer is from 50 to 1,000<br><br>
nm , and the interface between the adhesion reaction layer and<br>
the rubber has a fractal dimension of 1.001 to 1.300.<br>
The invention as claimed in claim 5 is directed to a metal<br>
cord for use in the rubber-cord complex according to claims 1<br>
to 3 , wherein the brass plated layer is formedby thermal diffusion<br>
of a copper plated layer and a zinc plated layer formed by plating<br>
in layers on a metal wire, in which the copper plated layer is<br>
formed by plating at a current density of 15 to 25 A/dm2, the<br>
zinc plated layer is formed by plating at a current density of<br>
40 to 60 A/dm2, and the thermal diffusion is conducted by a low<br>
temperature diffusion at a temperature of 500 to 550Â°C.<br>
The invention as claimed in claim 6 is directed to a metal<br>
cord for use in the rubber-cord complex according to claims 1<br>
to 3 , wherein the brass plated layer is formedby thermal diffusion<br>
of a copper plated layer and a plated layer of a zinc alloy selected<br>
from a zinc-nickel alloy and a zinc-cobalt alloy, the layers<br>
being formed in layers on a metal wire, in which the copper plated<br>
layer is formed by plating at a current density of 15 to 25 A/dm2,<br>
the zinc alloy plated layer is formed by plating at a current<br>
density of 40 to 60 A/dm2, and the thermal diffusion is conducted<br>
by a low temperature diffusion at a temperature of 500 to 550Â°C.<br>
The invention as claimed in claim 7 is directed to a<br>
pneumatic tire in which the rubber-cord complex according to<br>
claims 1 to 4 is used as a ply for tire reinforcement.<br><br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
As stated above, in the present invention, the irregularity<br>
of the interface between a rubber and an adhesion reaction layer<br>
in which sulfur in the rubber and copper in a brass plated layer<br>
bond to each other by a cross-linking reaction, is increased<br>
and complicated such that the fractal dimension of the interface<br>
falls within the range of 1.001 to 1.3 00. Also, the average<br>
thickness of the adhesion reaction layer is properly secured.<br>
As a result, the bonding force to the rubber at the interface<br>
of the adhesion reaction layer can be sufficiently increased<br>
and, in addition, increase in strength of the adhesion reaction<br>
layer itself can be achieved. Thus, by a synergistic effect<br>
of them, improvement in wet heat adhesive property between the<br>
rubber and the cord can be achieved.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be explained<br>
below along with illustrated examples. FIG. 1 is a cross<br>
sectional view showing a pneumatic tire in which a rubber-cord<br>
complex of the present invention is used as a ply for tire<br>
reinforcement. FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view showing the<br><br>
above-mentioned ply which is the rubber-cord complex.<br>
In FIG. 1, a pneumatic tire 1 shown in this example is<br>
a radial tire for passenger cars, and it includes a carcass 6<br>
extending from a tread portion 2 to bead cores 5 in bead portions<br>
4 through sidewall portions 3, and a belt layer 7 arranged radially<br>
outward of the carcass 6 in the tread portion 2.<br>
In this example, the carcass 6 is formed of one or more<br>
carcass plies 6A having carcass cords arranged, for example,<br>
at an angle of 75 to 90 degrees with respect to the circumferential<br>
direction of the tire. The carcass ply 6A comprises a ply main<br>
body portion 6a extending between the bead cores 5, 5, and ply<br>
turnup portions 6b that are turned up around the bead cores 5<br>
from the inside to the outside at each end of the ply main body<br>
portion 6a. A bead apex rubber 8 extending radially outwardly<br>
from the bead core 5 in a tapered manner is disposed between<br>
the ply main body portion 6 a and the ply turnup portion 6b, whereby<br>
a portion from the bead portion 4 to the sidewall portion 3 is<br>
reinforced.<br>
The belt layer 7 comprises two or more belt plies, two<br>
belt plies 7A, 7B in this example, having belt cords arranged<br>
at an angle of 10 to 45 degrees with respect to the circumferential<br>
direction of the tire. The belt plies are stacked so that the<br>
belt cords in one ply intersects with those in another belt ply<br>
to thereby enhance the belt rigidity so as to firmly reinforce<br>
the tread portion 2.<br><br>
In the present example, the rubber-cord complex 9 of the<br>
present invention is adopted to the belt plies 7A, 7B out of<br>
the plies for tire reinforcement including the carcass ply 6A<br>
and the belt plies 7A, 7B.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the rubber-cord complex 9 is composed<br>
of a cord array body 11 that metal cords 10 as belt cords are<br>
arranged mutually in parallel, and a rubber 12 for topping formed<br>
by covering the surface and back of the cord array body 11 with<br>
the rubber and subjecting the rubber to vulcanization-bonding<br>
to the cord array body. The "vulcanization-bonding" is achieved<br>
by vulcanization heat applied when an unvulcanized green tire<br>
is vulcanized and molded in a mold.<br>
As the rubber 12 for topping can be suitably used<br>
conventional rubbers for use in tires, in which sulfur is<br>
incorporated in a rubber base material. Besides sulfur, known<br>
additives, e.g. , a vulcanization accelerator andavulcanization<br>
acceleration assistant, are selectively used for the rubber 12<br>
in order to obtain required physical properties of the rubber.<br>
As the rubber base material are preferably used diene rubbers<br>
such as natural rubber, isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber and<br>
styrene/butadiene rubber. The diene rubbers are used alone or<br>
in the form of a blend of two or more rubbers. Table 1 shows<br>
an example of a rubber composition for the rubber 12. The<br>
composition dose not contain any organocobalt salt as mentioned<br>
above.<br><br><br>
*1 2,2,4-trimethyl-l,2-dihydroquinoline polymer<br>
*2 DZ: N,N'-dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide<br>
The metal cord 10 is composed of at least one drawn plated<br>
wire 17E obtained by forming a brass plated layer 16 on the surface<br>
of a metal element wire 15 and drawing the resulting plated wire .<br>
In case that the metal cord 10 is composed of a plurality of<br>
drawn plated wires 17E, the wires 17E are twisted in a known<br>
twisting structure such as bundle-twisting or layer-twisting.<br>
A metal cord 10 having a 1x3 structure where three plated wires<br>
17E are twisted together is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
The brass plated layer 16 is a brass-based plating<br>
containing copper and zinc as main components. In the present<br>
invention, it is possible to employ a binary alloy plating<br>
comprised of copper and zinc, or a ternary alloy plating<br>
containing, besides copper and zinc, cobalt or nickel as a third<br>
metal. In both cases of the binary alloy plating and the ternary<br>
alloy plating, it is preferable that the content of copper is<br>
in the range of 60 to 80 parts by weight and the content of zinc<br>
is in the range of 40 to 20 parts by weight, with respect to<br>
100 parts by weight of the plating. Further, in the case of<br><br>
the ternary alloy plating, it is preferable that the content<br>
of cobalt is in the range of 0.1 to 5.0 parts by weight and the<br>
content of nickel is in the range of 1.0 to 10.0 parts by weight.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3 (A) , the brass plated layer 16 made of<br>
the binary alloy plating is formed in such a manner that primary<br>
plated layers 20, i.e., a copper plated layer 20A and a zinc<br>
plated layer 2OB, are formed one after another on the surface<br>
of a metal element wire 15 , and then sub j ected to thermal diffusion<br>
to alloy the both metals (copper and zinc). Numeral 17A denotes<br>
a plated element wire prior to drawing, and numeral 17E denotes<br>
a plated wire after drawing. The copper plated layer 2 0A can<br>
be formed by electroplating treatment in a copper plating bath<br>
such as a copper pyrophosphate bath or a copper sulfate bath.<br>
The zinc plated layer 20B can be formed by electroplating<br>
treatment in a zinc plating bath such as a zinc sulfate bath.<br>
Further, the thermal diffusion is performedby thermally treating<br>
an element wire 15 having the copper plated layer 2 0A and the<br>
zinc plated layer 20B in a heating apparatus.<br>
In the case of forming the brass plated layer 16 made of<br>
a ternary alloy plating, as shown in FIG. 3(B), in addition to<br>
the copper plated layer 20A and the zinc plated layer 20B, a<br>
third metal plated layer 20C is formed by electroplating<br>
treatment in a third metal bath which is a cobalt bath or a nickel<br>
bath, and the three layers are then thermally diffused and<br>
alloyed.<br><br>
The order of formation of respective primary plated layers<br>
is not particularly restricted. However, in case that the<br>
element wire 15 is made of steel, it is not preferable to firstly<br>
form the zinc plated layer 2OB from the viewpoint of the plating<br>
peeling property since a hard and fragile alloy phase of iron<br>
and zinc is produced on the surface of the element wire 15.<br>
Further, diffusion tends to occur with difficulty between the<br>
copper plated layer 2 0A and the third metal plated layer 2 0C<br>
as compared with an interface between other plated layers.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable not to dispose the copper plated<br>
layer 20A and the third metal plated layer 20C adjacently to<br>
each other. Therefore, in the case of the binary alloy plating,<br>
the order of the copper plated layer 2 0A and the zinc plated<br>
layer 20B is preferred, and in the case of the ternary alloy<br>
plating, the order of the copper plated layer 2OA, the zinc plated<br>
layer 20B and the third metal plated layer 20C is preferred.<br>
After formation of the brass plated layer 16, the plated<br>
wire 17A is subjected to a known wire drawing process to give<br>
a plated wire 17E drawn to a desired diameter. Numeral 16E<br>
denotes a brass plated layer in the drawn plated wire 17E, and<br>
numeral 15E denotes a wire 15 in the drawn plated wire 17E.<br>
Further, another method for forming the brass plated layer<br>
16 made of the ternary alloy plating is a method wherein, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3 (C) , the copper plated layer 20A is firstly formed<br>
on the surface of the metal wire 15 and, thereafter, a plated<br><br>
layer 20D of an alloy of zinc and nickel or an alloy of zinc<br>
and cobalt is formedonthe copperplated layer 20A. Subsequently,<br>
the plated layers are subjected to thermal diffusion to give<br>
the brass plated layer 16. This alloy plated layer 20D can be<br>
formed by electroplating treatment in an alloy bath containing<br>
zinc sulf ate and nickel or an alloy bath containing zinc sulf ate<br>
and cobalt. When the brass plated layer 16 is formed in this<br>
manner, the content of the third metal in the external surface<br>
after the thermal diffusion decreases relatively as compared<br>
with the case of forming the third metal plated layer 20C as<br>
the outermost layer (the case shown in FIG. 3(B)). It is<br>
therefore possible to improve the drawing processability in the<br>
wire drawing step.<br>
The adhesive property between the brass plated layer 16E<br>
and the rubber 12 is exhibitedby formation of an adhesion reaction<br>
layer 25 at an interface between the brass plated layer 16E and<br>
the rubber 12, as shown in Fig. 4. The adhesion reaction layer<br>
25 is formed from copper in the brass plated layer 16E and sulfur<br>
incorporated in the rubber 12 that cause a cross-linking reaction<br>
to combine each other during vulcanization of the rubber.<br>
Improvement in wet heat adhesive property between the rubber<br>
12 and the plated wire 17 canbeachievedby increasing the strength<br>
of the adhesion reaction layer itself and increasing the adhesive<br>
force between the adhesion reaction layer 25 and the rubber 12.<br>
For this purpose, in the present invention, when the metal<br><br>
cord 10 to which the same rubber as the above-mentioned rubber<br>
12 has been vulcanized and bonded, or the rubber-cord complex<br>
9 itself, is in the wet heat deterioration state after being<br>
held in an atmosphere at a temperature of 50 to 100Â°C and a relative<br>
humidity of 60 to 100% for one hour to 20 days, the adhesion<br>
reaction layer 25 is required to have an average thickness Tn<br>
of 50 to 1,000 nm, and the interface S between the adhesion reaction<br>
layer 25 and the rubber 12 is required to have a fractal dimension<br>
of 1.001 to 1.300. In addition, in order to further ensure the<br>
effects of improvement in wet heat adhesive property, the wet<br>
heat deterioration environment is preferably set at a temperature<br>
of 70 to 100Â°C and a relative humidity of 80 to 100% for a period<br>
of 10 to 20 days.<br>
If the average thickness Tn of the adhesion reaction layer<br>
25 is less than 50 nm, the adhesion reaction layer 25 is so thin<br>
that the adhesive strength is insufficient. On the other hand,<br>
if the average thickness Tn exceeds 1, 0 00 nm, the cross-linking<br>
density of the adhesion reaction layer 25 decreases to result<br>
in reduction of adhesive strength. It is therefore preferable<br>
that the average thickness Tn of the adhesion reaction layer<br>
25 is 100 nm or more, and is 500 nm or less.<br>
As well known, the "fractal dimension" is an index for<br>
showing a complexity of a shape, a degree of irregularity of<br>
a surface, and the like. The larger the fractal dimension value,<br>
the more complex the irregularity is. In the present embodiment,<br><br>
the fractal dimension of the interface S of the adhesion reaction<br>
layer 25 is set to 1.001 or more, thereby increasing the degree<br>
of irregularity of the interface S to render it complicated and<br>
increasing the surface area thereof. It is thereby possible<br>
to enhance the bonding force between the adhesion reaction layer<br>
25 and the rubber 12. If the fractal dimension is less than<br>
1.001, the bonding force between the adhesion reaction layer<br>
25 and the rubber 12 after the wet heat deterioration is decreased.<br>
However, if the degree of irregularity becomes large to such<br>
an extent that the fractal dimension exceeds 1.3 00, the bonding<br>
force between the adhesion reaction layer 25 and the rubber 12<br>
after the wet heat deterioration decreases. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable that the lower limit of the fractal dimension is at<br>
least 1.050, especially at least 1.100, and the upper limit of<br>
the fractal dimension is at most 1.250.<br>
Further, as well known, the "fractal dimension" can be<br>
obtained, for example, by a box counting method. Specifically,<br>
for example, a TEM photograph (transmission electron microscopic<br>
photograph) of an adhesion reaction layer is subjected to image<br>
processing to extract a curved line along its interface. The<br>
fractal dimension of the extracted curved line is then obtained<br>
by the box counting method. In this box counting method, the<br>
curved line is divided into small square regions (boxes) each<br>
having one side with a length of "r" , and while the length "r"<br>
is changed, the number of small regions (boxes) each including<br><br>
a segment of the target curved line is counted. The counted<br>
number of small regions (boxes) is plotted as ordinate and the<br>
length of "r" at the time of counting is plotted as abscissa<br>
on a logarithmic graph, and the fractal dimension is obtained<br>
from the inclination of the graph. The average thickness Tn<br>
of the adhesion reaction layer 25 can also be obtained from the<br>
above-mentioned curved line along the interface shape.<br>
The fractal dimension of the interface S of the adhesion<br>
reaction layer 2 5 and the average thickness Tn of the adhesion<br>
reaction layer 25 can be adjusted by selecting the conditions<br>
of the current density and the diffusion temperature in<br>
electroplating for the copper plating and the zinc plating, and<br>
also by selecting the current density condition in plating of<br>
the third component.<br>
Preferable conditions on the fractal dimension of the<br>
interface S of the adhesion reaction layer 25 and the average<br>
thickness Tn of the adhesion reaction layer 25 are as mentioned<br>
below, namely<br>
(A)	to set the current density of electroplating within a specif ic<br>
range higher than a conventional one, in formation of the primary<br>
plated layers 20 (20A, 20B, 20C); and<br>
(B)	to set the temperature (diffusion temperature) in thermal<br>
diffusion treatment within a specific range lower than a<br>
conventional one;<br>
whereby the adhesion reaction layer 25 as defined above can be<br><br>
obtained. Specifically, it is preferable that the current<br>
density in electroplating for the copper plated layer 2 0A is<br>
raised to the range of 15 to 25 A/dm2, the current density in<br>
electroplating for the zinc plated layer 20B is raised to the<br>
range of 40 to 60 A/dm2, and the thermal diffusion is performed<br>
at a low diffusion temperature within the range of 500 to 550Â°C.<br>
It should be noted that in a conventional brass plating of wires,<br>
the current density for the copper plated layer is set to about<br>
10A/dm2, the current density for the zinc plated layer is set<br>
to about 20A/dm2, and the diffusion temperature is set to a range<br>
of 560 to 600Â°C. Further, in the case of conducting<br>
electroplating for the third metal plated layer 20C, it is<br>
preferable to raise the current density to the range of 3 0 to<br>
4 0 A/dm2.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 3(C), in the case of forming<br>
a zinc alloy plated layer 20D, i.e., zinc/nickel alloy plated<br>
layer or zinc/cobalt alloy plated layer in place of the zinc<br>
plated layer 20B, the current density in electroplating for the<br>
zinc alloy plated.layer 20D is set to the range of 40 to 60 A/dm2,<br>
as in the case of the zinc plated layer 20B.<br>
As stated above, the brass plated layer 16E may be a ternary<br>
alloy plating containing nickel or cobalt. However, in the case<br>
of adding nickel as a third metal, if the amount of nickel added<br>
is less than 1.0 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight<br>
of the plating, the plated layer 16E is easy to change to a fragile<br><br>
grain structure after wet heat deterioration and tends to cause<br>
peeling from this changed portion. On the other hand, if the<br>
amount of nickel added exceeds 10.0 parts by weight, the thickness<br>
T of the adhesion reaction layer 25 becomes thin to decrease<br>
the adhesive strength, and also the plated layer 16E becomes<br>
hard to deteriorate the wire drawing processability. Hence,<br>
the amount of nickel added is preferably within the range of<br>
1.0 to 10.0 parts by weight.<br>
Further, in the case of adding cobalt as a third metal,<br>
if the amount of cobalt added is less than 0.1 part by weight<br>
based on 10 0 parts by weight of the plating, the plated layer<br>
16 is easy to change to a fragile grain structure after wet heat<br>
deterioration and tends to cause peeling from this changed<br>
portion. On the other hand, if the amount of cobalt added exceeds<br>
5.0 parts by weight, the thickness T of the adhesion reaction<br>
layer 25 becomes thin to decrease the adhesive strength, and<br>
also the plated layer 16E becomes hard to deteriorate the wire<br>
drawing processability. Hence, the amount of cobalt added is<br>
preferably within the range of 0.1 to 5.0 parts by weight.<br>
In the present example has been illustrated a case where<br>
the rubber-cord complex 9 is applied to a ply for tire<br>
reinforcement, particularly a belt ply. However, the<br>
rubber-cord complex 9 can also be applied to other plies for<br>
tire reinforcement, such as a carcass ply and a bead reinforcing<br>
ply. Further, the metal cord 10 may be used as a bead wire for<br><br>
forming a bead core 5. In such a case, the metal cord 10 is<br>
made of a single plated wire 17, and it is considered that the<br>
pneumatic tire 1 itself constitutes the rubber-cord complex 9.<br>
In addition to those described above, the rubber-cord complex<br>
9 is also applicable to a variety of rubber products such as<br>
a hose and a industrial belt. Further, as the material for the<br>
metal element wire 15 can be used, besides steel mentioned above,<br>
a variety of metal materials which are capable of forming the<br>
brass plated layer 16, such as aluminum, copper and titanium,<br>
and with the use of any of the metal materials, it is possible<br>
to effectively exert the above-mentioned action and effect.<br>
A particularly preferable embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been described above in detail, but the present<br>
invention is not limited to the embodiment shown in the drawings<br>
and various changes and modifications can be made in practicing<br>
the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
(1) A brass plated layer was formed on the surface of a<br>
steel wire having a diameter of 1.7 mm. The plated wire was<br>
then subjected to wire drawing treatment to give a drawn plated<br>
wire having a diameter of 0.27 mm.<br>
The brass plating was carried out by any of the following<br>
methods.<br>
(A) A copper plated layer and a zinc plated layer were<br><br>
successively formed and then subjected to a thermal diffusion<br>
treatment to form a binary alloy brass plated layer. This method<br>
is referred to as a method A.<br>
(B)	A copper plated layer, a zinc plated layer and a third<br>
metal plated layer were successively formed and then subjected<br>
to a thermal diffusion treatment to form a ternary alloy plated<br>
layer. This method is referred to as a method B.<br>
(C)	A copper plated layer and a zinc alloy (zinc/nickel<br>
alloy or zinc/cobalt alloy) plated layer were successively formed<br>
and then subjected to a thermal diffusion treatment to form a<br>
ternary alloy plated layer. This method is referred to as a<br>
method C.<br>
Both sides of an array of metal cords each of which is<br>
formed by twisting the drawn plated wires and has a 1x3 structure,<br>
were sandwiched between unvulcanized rubber sheets having the<br>
composition shown in Table 1, and then heated in a press-contacted<br>
state (165Â°C, 18 minutes) for vulcanization to give a sample<br>
of a cord ply. Each of the samples obtained in such a manner<br>
was then subjected to a peeling test, and the initial adhesive<br>
property and the wet heat adhesive property of the metal cords<br>
were compared.<br>
The wet heat adhesive property was measured by allowing<br>
the above-mentioned sample to stand in an oven at a temperature<br>
of 80Â°C and a relative humidity of 95% for 20 days and then<br>
subjecting the sample in a wet heat deterioration state to a<br><br>
peeling test. The initial adhesive property was measured by-<br>
allowing the sample after the vulcanization to natural cooling<br>
at ordinary temperature and humidity [20Â°C, 50%(relative<br>
humidity)] and then subjecting it to a peel ing test. The peeling<br>
test was conducted by peeling the sample from its one end along<br>
the rubber/metal cord interface at a speed of 50 mm/min., and<br>
the state of the metal cord surface at the interface was evaluated<br>
according to the following criteria.<br>
5: The surface is fully covered with the rubber, and the plated<br>
layer surface of the steel cord is invisible.<br>
4 : The plated layer is visible at 3 to 6 places on the peeled<br>
surface.<br>
3 : The plated layer is visible at 11 to 16 places on the peeled<br>
surface.<br>
2 : The plated layer is visible at 21 or more places on the peeled<br>
surface, but not less than 6 0% of the whole plated layer surf ace<br>
is covered with the rubber.<br>
1: The total area of the plated layer surface covered with the<br>
rubber is not less than 10% and less then 30%.<br>
In Table 2, the evaluation is performed with scores in<br>
steps of 0.5, where a surface state out of the integer score<br>
range applies such evaluation.<br>
(2) A pneumatic tire (size: 195/65R15) using the<br>
above-mentioned steel cord as a belt cord was produced according<br>
to the following specification, and the high-speed durability<br><br>
of the tire was tested.<br>
(Belt layer)<br>
The number of plies: 2 plies<br>
Cord angle: (+20Â°, -20Â°)<br>
The number of cords: 40 cords/5 cm<br>
(Carcass)<br>
Cord:	1,670 dtex/2 (polyester)<br>
The number of plies: 1 ply<br>
Cord angle: (90Â°)<br>
The number of cords: 50 cords/5 cm<br><high-speed durability test><br>
Under conditions of an internal pressure of 28 0 kPa and<br>
a load of 492 kgf, a drum driving test apparatus was started<br>
at a speed of 170 km/h, and the speed was increased in stages<br>
by 10 km/h every 10 minutes. A distance driven until destruction<br>
of the tire was measured and shown as an index relative to the<br>
result of Comparative Example 1 taken as 100. The larger the<br>
value, the better the high-speed durability is.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in the table, it can be confirmed from the peeling<br>
test that the metal cords of the examples according to the present<br>
invention are excellent in adhesive property after wet heat<br>
deterioration to the rubber. Further, it can also be confirmed<br>
from the high-speed durability test that reduction in adhesive<br>
property due to heat can be suppressed to thereby allow<br>
improvement in high-speed durability of tires.<br>
