				<td>METHOD FOR CONTROLLING COOL AIR DISPERSING OPERATION OF A REFRIGERATOR Disclosed is a method of controlling a cool air dispersing operation of a refrigerator for maintaining the temperature in a cooling compartment uniform. Many horizontal dispersing blades and vertical dispersing blades of planar plate shape, which respectively control the horizontal and vertical discharge directions of cool air are installed in a cool air duct. The blades are continuously rotated while a deviation of temperature in the cooling compartment is smaller than a predetermined value, whereby the cool air in the cooling compartment is successively supplied into the respective areas in the cooling compartment. Meanwhile, if the deviation is greater than the predetermined value, the blades are stopped at a specific position so that the cool air is discharged toward an area of which temperature is high. Thus, the temperature in the cooling compartment becomes unifomi in a short period of time. Further, no vortex of cool air is generated since the blades are shaped into a planar plate.

				<td>Background of the invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling cool air dispersing operation of a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a method for controlling cool air dispersing operation of a refrigerator having horizontal dispersing blades and vertical dispersing blades for respectively dispersing cool air supplied into a cooling compartment horizontally and vertically.<br>
2.	Prior Art<br>
In general, a refrigerator has a cabinet for forming a pair of cooling compartments, i. e,, a freezing compartment and a fresh food compartment which are partitioned by a partitioning wall, a freezing compartment door and a fresh food compartment door for opening/closing the cooling compartments respectively, and a cooling system for supplying the freezing compartment and the fresh food compartment with cool air which is comprised of a compressor, a condenser and an evaporator. The cool air generated by the evaporator flows along a cool air duct formed in a rear wall of each compartment, and then is supplied into each cooling compartment by a blowing fan through cool air discharge ports opened thereinto.<br>
In such a conventional refrigerator, however, there exist an area on which the cool air discharged through the cool air discharge ports is concentrated, and an area to which a relatively small amount of cool air is supplied, so there occurs a deviation of temperamre in the cooling compartments and uniform cooling cannot be achieved. Therefore, the refrigerator adopting so called tri-dimensional cooling method which has amended such a problem has been proposed. In the refrigerator adopting the tri-dimensional cooling method, the cool air discharge ports are provided at both side walls as well as at the rear wall of the cooling compartment in order to promote the uniform cooling.<br><br>
However, in such a refrigerator adopting the tridimensional cooling method, since the cool air is discharged through the cool air discharge ports in fixed directions, there may be a dead-zone at an edge area which is not supplied with the cool air sufficiently. In particular, since the cool air duct has to be provided not only in the rear wall but also in the side walls, there are problems that the space for storing food is reduced and the manufacturing cost increases due to the increased number of components and processes.<br>
The uniform distribution of cool air has risen to an important problem in relation to the trend to use large-sized refrigerator.<br>
In consideration of such a problem, the applicant of this invention has proposed a refrigerator having a device for dispersing cool air in hitemational Patent Application WO 95/27278. FIGS. 1 through 3 are a side view, a partial enlarged sectional view, and an exploded perspective view of main elements of the refrigerator having the device for dispersing cool air.<br>
The convenrional refrigerator having the device for dispersing cool air has a pair of cooling compartments 2 and 3 in a cabinet 1 with hexahedral shape, which are partitioned from each other by a partitioning wall 5. The cooling compartments 2 and 3 are called a freezing compartment 2 of relatively low temperature and a fresh food compartment 3 of relatively high temperature. On the front opening of the cooling compartments 2 and 3, doors 6 and 7 for opening/closing them are installed respectively. In the cabinet 1 is installed a cooling system comprising a compressor 11, a condenser (not shown), a freezing compartment evaporator 12a, and a fresh food compartment evaporator 12b. The cool air generated from the evaporators 12a and 12b is supplied to the corresponding compartments 2 and 3 by a freezing compartment fan 13a and a fresh food compartment fan 13b respecrively.<br>
A duct plate 9 of partial cylinder shape having cool air discharge ports 16 opened to the fresh food compartment 3 is attached to an inner wall plate 23 forming a rear inner wail surface of the fresh food compartment 3, and a cool air duct 15 and a circulation duct 17 separated from each other by a seal plate 25 are provided between the duct plate 9 and a rear wall 4 of the cabinet  1.    In the<br><br>
cool air duct 15 is installed a duct member 21 for guiding the cool air blown by the fresh food compartment fan 13b downwardly. The cool air generated by the ftesh food compartment evaporator 12b is blown by the fresh food compartment fan 13b, and then supplied to the fresh food compartment 3 via the cool air duct 15 aiid the cool air discharge ports 16.<br>
A cool air dispersing device 130 is installed in the cool air duct 15. The cool air dispersing device 130 is comprised of a rotational shaft 131 having a vertical axis, cool air dispersing blades 132 assembled with the rotational shaft 131 at areas adjacent to the cool air discharge ports 16 respectively, and a driving motor 135 for rotating the rotational shaft 131. Each of the cool air dispersing blades 132 is comprised of three discs 136, 137 and 138 disposed in parallel with each other along the axis direction, and a first blade part 133 and a second blade part 134 disposed between the discs 136, 137 and 138. Each of the blade parts 133 and 134 are bent so that their cross section is a lax shape of alphabet S. The blade pans  133 and  134 are bent to the opposite directions to each other.<br>
In the refrigerator having the above-described constitution, when the driving motor 135 rotates the rotational shaft 131 at a low speed, the cool air flowing along the cool air duct 15 changes its flowing direction along the bent .surface of the cool air dispersing blades 132, and is discharged into the fresh food compartment 3 to be dispersed horizontally. Meanwhile, when the concentrative cooling on a specific area is needed, the drivmg motor 135 stops the rotational shaft 131 in accordance with the direction of the cool air dispersing blades 132.<br>
However, since the blade parts 133 and 134 of the cool ak dispersing device 130 are bent to be shaped into the lax alphabet S, die smooth flow of cool au" may be impeded by a vortex of the cool air formed about the cool au" discharge ports 16.<br>
Moreover, although such a conventional cool air dispersing device 130 can achieve the uniform distribution of the coo! air horizontally, the vertical distribution of the cool air has not been uniform, so there is a limitation in realizing the uniform cooling throughout the overall area of the fresh food compartment 3.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention has been proposed to overcome the above-described problems in the prior art, and accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provides a method for controlling a cool air dispersing operation of a refrigerator, capable of preventing vortex of cool air and achieving effectively the uniform distribution of cool air both horizontally and vertically.<br>
The present invention provides a method for controlling a cool air dispersing operation of a refirigeratoi, comprising the steps of: preparing a duct housing forming a cool air duct for guiding cool air generated by an evaporator, said duct housing having a plurality of cool air discharge ports open into a cooling compartment, characterized in that a plurality of horizontal dispersing blades of planar plate shape being installed in said cool air duct so as to be capable of rotating with respect to a vertical axis, said horizontal dispersing blades for controlling a horizontal discharge direction of the cool air supplied into said cooling compartment, and a plurality of vertical dispersing blades of planar plate shape being installed in said cool air duct so as to be capable of rotating with respect to a horizontal axis, said vertical dispersing blades for controlling a vertical discharge direction of the cool air supplied into said cooling compartment; sensing temperatures of a predetermined number of positions in said cooling compartment; calculating a deviation of the temperatures in said cooling compartment on the basis of the sensed temperature; supplying the cool air in said cool air duct successively to respective areas in said cooling compartment by rotating said horizontal dispersing blades and said vertical dispersing blades continuously, while the deviation is smaller than a predetermined value; and stopping said horizontal dispersing blades and said vertical dispersing blades so that the cool air is discharged toward an area of which temperature is high, when the deviation is greater than the predetermined value.<br>
It is preferably that said vertical dispersing blades are reciprocally rotated within a predetermined angular range as said horizontal dispersing blades are rotated. Furthermore, it is more preferable that said vertical dispersing blades are controlled so as to reciprocate one time while said horizontal dispersing blades rotate one time.<br><br>
According to the present invention, die vortex of the cool air about die cool air discharge ports does not occur. Further, since the discharge direction of the cool air is continuously changed by the combinational operation of the horizontal dispersing blades and the vertical dispersing blades, the cool air is distributed uniformly throughout the overall area of the cooling compartment, hi particular, the area of which temperature has risen can be cooled in a concentrative manner, so the temperature in the cooling compartment becomes uniform in a short period of lime.<br>

The transmission part comprises a driving cam 63 installed on the vertical shaft disposed in the rear of the vertical dispersmg blades 51 in the cool air duct   15, and a link member 61  assembled with the vertical dispersing  blades<br><br>
51 and elevated/de-elevaied by the driving cam 63 according to the rotation of the vertical shaft 31.<br>
The vertical shaft 31 is dispased along the longitudinal direction of the coo! air duel 15 in the rear of the vertical dispersing blades 51, of which upper end is assembled with the driving motor 35, and lower end is rotatably fixed to the lower part of the duct cover 27. The driving motor 35 is accommodated in a motor case (not shown) at the upper part of the front plate 23. It is preferable that the driving motor 35 is a stepping motor which is capable of rotating bilaterally and controlling the stop angular position thereof.<br>

Hereinbelow, the method for controlling the cool air dispersing operation of the refrigerator having the above-described construction will be described.<br>
FIG. 8 through FIG. 13 are views showing the state of cool air dispersed by the vertical dispersing blades and the horizontal dispersing blades. After a desired temperature is set by a user, a microprocessor (not shown) in the refrigerator drives the compressor, and thereby cool air is generated aroimd the evaporators 12a and 12b. The cool air generated by the evaporators 12a and 12b is blown by the fans 13a and 13b,<br>
Meanwhile, the refrigerator senses the temperatures in the fresh food compartment 3 with the temperature sensors 9a and 9b. The microprocessor calculates the deviation of the temperamres in the fresh food compartment 3 on the basis of the signals from the temperature sensors 9a and 9b, and compares the deviation with a predetermined reference value preset in the microprocessor. The reference value may be determined variously according to the capacity or characteristic of the refrigerator.<br>
While the deviation is smaller than the reference value, the microprocessor drives the driving motor 35 so that it rotates continuously at a predetermined velocity. Then, the vertical shaft 31 assembled with the driving motor 35 and the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c are rotated, and in such a situation, the link member 61 is elevated/de-elevated by the driving cam 63.    As the link member 61  is elevated/de-elevated, as shown in FIGS. 8 through<br><br>
10, the vertical dispersing blades 51 are rotated successively. When the vertical dispersing blades 51 are horizontal, die cool air is discharged frontward as shown in flG. 8. When the vertical dispersmg blades 51 are rotated upward or downward, the cool air is discharged upward or downward as shown in FIGS. 9 and  10, respecdvely.<br>
While die vertical dispersing blades 51 are rotating, die horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c are rotatmg. When the horizontal dispersmg blades 33a, 33b and 33c are positioned frontward as shown in FIG. 11, the cool air is discharged frontward. When the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c are rotated right or left, the cool air is discharged right or left as shown in FIGS.  12 and 13, respecdvely.<br>
As described above, while the cool air dispersing device 30 according to the present invention is operating, the cool air is successively discharged to respective areas in the fresh food compartment 3 by the combinational operation of the vertical dispersing blades 51 and the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c. FIGS, 14 and 15 show die areas in the fresh food compartment (area A through area F) to which the cool air is successively supplied by such a cool air dispersing device 30.<br>
While one dispersing blade part 34a of the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c is rotated right, the vertical dispersmg blades 51 are rotated downward, whereby the cool air in the cool air duct 15 is discharged to the right lower area A in the fresh food compartment 3. While the one dispersing blade part 34a is directed frontward, the vertical dispersing blades 51 are also directed frontward, whereby the cool air in the cool air duct 15 is discharged to the central area B in the fresh food compartment 3. While the dispersing blade part 34a is rotated left, the vertical dispersing blades 51 are rotated upward, whereby the cool air m the cool air duct 15 is discharged to the left upper area C in the fresh food compartment 3.<br>
As the vertical shaft 31 further rotates, the other dispersing blade part 34b of the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c becomes rotated right, and the vertical dispersing blades 51 are still rotated upward, whereby the cool air is discharged right upper area D  in the fresh food compartment 3.     As the other<br><br>
dispersing blade 34b continues to rotate left, the vertical dispersing blades 51 gradually rotate downward, whereby the cool air in the cool air duct 15 is discharged to the central area E, and then to the left lower area F successively.<br>
Afterward, the cool air is supplied to the right lower area A again by the dispersing blades part 34a and the vertical dispersmg blades 51, and such a process is repeated while die vertical shaft 31 is being rotated by the driving motor 35. The temperature in the fresh food compartment 3 is maintamed uniform by the cool air discharged thereinto along a predetermined continuous circulatmg path as described above.<br>
Meanwhile, when the deviation of temperatures m the fresh food compartment 3 is greater than the predetermined reference value, the microprocessor controls the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c and the vertical dispersing blades 51 on the basis of the signals from the temperature sensors 9a and 9b so that the cool air is concentrated on an area of which temperature is high. For example, if the temperature of the right lower area A in the fresh food compartment 3 is determined to be highest, the microprocessor drives the driving motor 35 so that the horizontal dispersing blades 33a, 33b and 33c and the vertical dispersing blades 51 are directed to the right lower area A, and then stops the driving motor 35. Then, the coo! air is continuously supplied to the right lower area A, and the temperature in the fresh food compartment 3 becomes uniform in a short period of time.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the vortex of the cool air about the cool air discharge ports does not occur since the horizontal dispersing blades and the vertical dispersing blades have the shape of a planar plate. Further, since the discharge direction of die cool air is continuously changed by the combinational operation of the horizontal dispersing blades and the vertical dispersing blades, the cool air is distributed uniformly throughout the overall area of the fresh food compartment. In particular, the area of which temperature has risen can be cooled in a concentrative manner, so the temperature in the fresh food compartment becomes uniform in a short period of time.<br>
Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is cleariy understood that the same is by way of illustration and example<br><br>
only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, wherein the spirit and scope of the present invention is limited only by the terms of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
