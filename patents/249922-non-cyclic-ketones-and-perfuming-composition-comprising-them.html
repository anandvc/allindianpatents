				<td>Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery. More particularly, it<br>
concerns the use as perfuming ingredient of a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group, and R1 represents a<br>
(Me)(R2)C=C(R3) group or a phenyl group optionally substituted.<br>
The present invention concerns also the compositions or articles associated with<br>
said compound.<br>
Prior art<br>
Compounds having fragrances of the citrus type, and in particular of the grapefruit<br>
odor, are of high interest for the perfumery industry as they can he used in a variety of<br>
articles to impart a very well appreciated scent.<br>
Most of the compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 represents a phenyl group are<br>
known from the prior art. Indeed US 4654169 cites several of them as intermediates in the<br>
synthesis of oximes. However, this prior art document does not report or suggest any<br>
organoleptic properties of the compounds of formula (I), or any use of said compound in<br>
the field of perfumery.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 represents a substituted carbon-carbon<br>
double bond have never been reported in the prior art. The closest known analogue of said<br>
compounds is 2,4,4,7-tetramethyloct-6-en-3-one which has been described in US 6252120<br>
as perfuming ingredient. However, this prior art document does not report or suggest any<br>
compound of the present invention and still less their organoleptic properties or any use of<br>
said compound in the field of perfumery.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now discovered that a compound of formula<br><br>
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group, and R1 represents<br>
(i) a (Me)(R2)C=C(R3) group, R2 representing a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and<br>
R3 representing a methyl or ethyl group; or<br>
(ii) a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or two methyl groups;<br>
is a useful perfuming ingredient, which is unexpectedly characterized by a citrus odor of<br>
the grapefruit type.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the preferred compounds of formula (I) are<br>
those wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, in particular those wherein R1 represents (i)<br>
a (Me)2C=C(R3) group, R3 representing a methyl or ethyl group, or (ii) a phenyl group<br>
optionally substituted by one methyl group.<br>
The invention's compounds of formula<br><br>
wherein the carbon-carbon double bond has a configuration of the type (Z) or (E), or a<br>
mixture of the two configurations, and R, R2 and R3 have the meaning indicated for<br>
formula (I),<br>
are new and are also an object of the present invention. Amongst the compounds (H), the<br>
one wherein R is a hydrogen atom and R2 and R3 are each a methyl group is a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
As mentioned above, all the invention's compounds are characterized by a citrus<br>
type odor, of the grapefruit type.<br><br>
In particular one can cite 2,2,4-trimemyl-l-phenyl-3-pentanone which has a<br>
pleasant, sparkling and natural grapefruit fragrance wherein are also present balsamic and<br>
floral notes as well as bottom notes of the ginger and herbal-green type. The overall<br>
impression is a bit bitter and reminiscent of the grapefruit peel. The fragrance is also<br>
characterized by a good persistence and is also one of the most powerful grapefruit notes<br>
ever observed for a non-sulfur containing compound.<br>
Other examples of invention's compounds are 2,2,4-trimethyl-1-(2-methylphenyl)-<br>
3-pentanone or 2,4,4-trimethyl-5-phenyl-3-hexanone which have a grapefruit, slightly<br>
sulfury, odor.<br>
Yet, another invention's compound is the 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one that<br>
has a fresh and sparkling grapefruit fragrance wherein are also present lrnalool, fresh-mint<br>
citrata, cooling-fresh and cinnamon tonalities. Another important characteristic of said<br>
compound is its woody-aromatic aspect. Bottom notes of the floral, clary-sage are also<br>
present. The overall impression of the 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one fragrance<br>
reminds of the grapefruit peel, but without the sulfury aspect, and the floral-herbaceous<br>
aspect of the clary-sage.<br>
The fragrance of 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one is also distinct from the one<br>
of the prior art compound 2,4,4,7-tetramethyl-6-octen-3-one. Indeed, the invention's<br>
compound has an odor which is characteristic of the grapefruit peel with a woody (pine)-<br>
aromatic note, while the prior art compound has an odor which is characteristic of the<br>
grapefruit juice, bergamot, and is not woody.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns also the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) as perfuming ingredients. Said compound of formula (I) can be used as such or<br>
in admixture with one or more other compounds of formula (I). In other words another<br>
object of the present invention concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify<br>
the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed article; which method<br>
comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount of at least a<br>
compound of formula (I).<br>
By "use of a compound of formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the use of<br>
any composition containing the compound (I).<br><br>
Said compositions, which are in fact perfuming compositions that can be<br>
advantageously employed as perfuming ingredient, are also an object of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming composition<br>
comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one invention's compound as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a<br>
' perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of<br>
perfuming ingredients. Said carrier may be a liquid or a solid.<br>
As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, an emulsifying system,<br>
i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery. A<br>
detailed description of the nature and type of solvents commonly used in perfumery<br>
cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as non-limiting examples solvents such as<br>
dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthal-ate, isopropyl myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used. As solid<br>
carrier one may cite, as non-limiting examples, absorbing gums or polymers, or yet<br>
encapsulating materials. Examples of such materials may comprise, for example, wall-<br>
forming and plasticizing materials, such as mono, di- or trisaccharides, natural or<br>
modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl • acetates,<br>
polyvinylalcohols, proteins or pectins, or yet the materials cited in reference texts such as<br>
H. Scherz, Hydrokolloids : Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel in Lebensmittel,<br>
Band 2 der Schriftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelqualitat, Bear's VerlagGmbH<br>
.&amp; Co., Hamburg, 1996. The encapsulation is a well-known process to a person skilled in<br>
the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drying,<br>
agglomeration or yet extrusion; or consists of a coating encapsulation, including<br>
coacervation and complex coacervation techniques.<br>
Generally speaking, by 'perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br><br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not of the formula (I). Moreover, by "perfuming<br>
co-rngredienf' it is meant here a compound, which is used in perflming preparations or<br>
compositions to impart an hedonic effect. In other words such a co-ingredient, to be<br>
considered as being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or<br>
sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingredients<br>
can be of natural or synthetic origin. Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in<br>
reference texts such as the book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969,<br>
Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar<br>
nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also<br>
understood that said co-ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a<br>
controlled manner various types of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carrier than those previously specified can also be ethanol,<br>
water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known<br>
under the trademark Isopar® (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether<br>
esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability, etc. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br>
commonly used in permming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
An invention's composition consisting of at least one compound of formula (I)<br>
and at least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as<br>
well as a perfuming composition comprising at least one compound of formula (I), at least<br>
one perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
It is useful to mention here that the possibility to have, in the compositions<br>
mentioned above, more than one compound of formula (I) is important as it enables the<br>
perfumer to prepare accords, perfumes, possessing the odor tonality of various compounds<br>
of the invention, creating thus new tools for their work.<br>
Its is also understood here that, unless otherwise indicated or described, any<br>
mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e.g. without an adequate purification,<br>
in which the compound of the invention would be involved as a starting, intermediate or<br>
end-product could not be considered as a perfuming composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used in all the<br>
fields of modern perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product<br>
into which said compound (I)is added. Consequently, a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I); and<br>
ii) a consumer product base,<br>
is also an obj ect of the present invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "consumer product base",<br>
we mean here a consumer product which is compatible with perfuming ingredients. In<br>
other words, a perfumed article according to the invention comprises the functional<br>
formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer<br>
product, e.g. a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfactive effective amount of at least<br>
one invention's compound.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the consumer product do not warrant a<br>
more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled<br>
person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to<br>
the nature and the desired effect of said product.<br><br>
Examples of suitable consumer products include solid or liquid detergents and<br>
fabric softeners as well as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes,<br>
colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or<br>
gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products,<br>
deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations. As detergents<br>
there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleaning products for<br>
washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile, dish or hard-surface<br>
treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use. Other perfumed<br>
articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an<br>
aggressive medium for the invention's compound, so that it may be necessary to protect<br>
the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The use of, or a composition or article containing, 2,2,4-trimethyl-l-phenyl-3-<br>
pentanone and/or 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one is a particularly appreciated<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed<br>
and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in a given<br>
base when the compounds according to the invention are mixed with perfuming co-<br>
ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, in the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are in<br>
the order of 0.5 % to 35 % by weight, or even more, of the compounds of the invention<br>
based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated. Concentrations<br>
lower than these, such as in the order of 1% to 15% by weight, can be used when these<br>
compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles.<br>
The invention's compounds can be prepared by a process comprising the reaction<br>
of the 2,4-dimethyl-pentan-3-one with the appropriate alkylating agent such a benzyl<br>
halide or an allyl halide, in the presence of a base, according to the Scheme (I).<br><br>
Scheme (I): Specific examples of preparation of the compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
wherein R and R3 have the same meaning as indicated above. Specific examples of<br>
preparation are given in the Examples.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art, the temperatures<br>
are indicated in degrees centigrade (°C); the NMR spectral data were recorded in CDCl3<br>
(if not stated otherwise) with a 360 or 400 MHz machine for 1H and 13C, the chemical<br>
displacements 5 are indicated in ppm with respect to TMS as standard, the coupling<br>
constants J are expressed in Hz.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 2.4.4.6.7-pentamethvl-6-octen-3-one<br>
On a three neck flask containing 50 ml of dry THF, at -70°C, were added 65 ml of a<br>
1.5 M solution of LDATHF in cyclohexane (96 mmoles). To said solution were added,<br>
dropwise, 10 g of 2,4-dhnethyl-3-pentanone (87.5 mmoles). After one hour stirring, the<br>
medium temperature was left to warm up to 0° C, and then 14,3 g of 2,3-dimethyl-l-<br>
bromo-2-butene (87 mmoles) were added dropwise so as to maintain the reaction<br>
temperature betweem 0° and 10°C, At the end of the addition of the bromide, the<br>
temperature was risen to room temperature. After one hour stirring the reaction medium<br>
was poured into an excess of a 2M aqueous HC1 solution. The mixture thus obtained was<br>
extracted with 100 ml of cyclohexane and the organic layer washed with water until<br>
neutrality.<br><br>
Drying of the organic layer, evaporation of the solvent and distillation (B.p.4.5mhar = 84°C)<br>
of the crude oil afforded the title compound with a yield of 72%.<br>

The addition of 1000 parts by weight of 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one to the<br>
above-described composition imparted to the latter a new dimension. The new eau de<br>
toilette thus obtained had a more enhanced floral-citrus character and its fragrance was<br><br>
also more sparkling, almost effervescent, with also a note that was both pink grapefruit<br>
and floral, slightly freesia.<br>

4)	Propyl (S)-2-(1,1-dimethylpropoxy)propanoate; origin: Firmenich SA, Geneva,<br>
Switzerland<br>
The addition of 400 parts by weight of 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one to the above-<br>
described composition imparted to the latter a very interesting pink grapefruit twist with a<br>
pine-woody side. Furthermore, the fragrance of the new eau de toilette acquired a more<br>
sparkling character, with a citrus-fruity tonality much more natural.<br>
The addition of the same amount of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1-phenyl-3-pentanone to the eau de<br>
toilette imparted to the latter a similar olfactive effect to the one obtained by the addition<br>
of 2,4,4,6,7-pentamethyl-6-octen-3-one, however the effect was more persistent.<br>
On the other hand, the addition of 400 parts by weight of 2,4,4,7-tetramethyl-6-octen-3-<br>
one (of the prior art) to the above-described composition imparted to said composition a<br>
fragrance of the terpenic, acid type, close to the limette type. This fragrance, which<br>
contains the prior art compound, was also devoid of the pink grapefruit character, as well<br>
as of the woody aspect, obtained with the addition of the invention's compounds.<br><br>
