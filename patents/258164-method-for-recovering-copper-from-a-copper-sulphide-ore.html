				<td>METHOD FOR RECOVERING COPPER FROM A COPPER SULPHIDE<br>
ORE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method whereby copper is recovered from a<br>
copper sulphide ore that containing pyrite. According to the method the ore is<br>
ground finely and leached into a solution containing sulphuric acid in<br>
atmospheric conditions by means of trivalent copper. As the copper sulphide<br>
leaches out, the trivalent iron is reduced to divalent and is oxidised back to<br>
trivalent by means of oxygen during leaching. Leaching is carried out in a<br>
closed reactor, where the undissolved gas rising from the solution in the<br>
upper section of the reactor is circulated back into the suspension of solution,<br>
solids and gas. Leaching is performed in the presence of both divalent and<br>
trivalent iron and preferably with the dissolved copper acting as a catalyst to<br>
promote leaching. The conditions are adjusted to be such that the pyrite<br>
essentially does not dissolve.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A significant portion of ores that contain copper sulphide is chalcopyritic ore,<br>
CuFeS2, of which the most common processing method after enrichment is<br>
pyrometallurgical smelting - anode casting - electrolytic purification.<br>
Nowadays however there is also interest in the hydrometallurgical<br>
processing of copper sulphide ores, whereby the first treatment stage itself is<br>
also commonly the formation of a flotation concentrate, after which usually at<br>
least one concentrate leaching stage takes place in autoclave conditions.<br>
The other primary occurrence of copper sulphide is chalcocite, Cu2S, which<br>
is processed principally in the same way as chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite and<br>
chalcocite generally occur in the same ore and often the amount of<br>
chalcopyrite is predominant.<br>
The leaching of minerals containing chalcopyrite and/or chalcocite with the<br>
aid of trivalent iron in a solution containing sulphuric acid is described e.g. in<br><br>
WO publications 2005/042790 and 2005/005672. In both cases the oxidation<br>
of the divalent iron formed in leaching to trivalent is performed in autoclave<br>
conditions, although at least part of the concentrate leaching could be<br>
performed in atmospheric conditions. The copper sulphate solution formed in<br>
leaching is routed to conventional copper recovery.<br>
A method for the hydrometallurgical recovery of copper from chalcopyrite<br>
and other sulphides is described in US patent publication 4,115,221. In this<br>
method the sulphide mineral is ground to a fineness where the particle size is<br>
a maximum of one micrometre. The sulphidic solids are leached into an<br>
acidic solution, in which the amount of ferric ions is stochiometrically<br>
sufficient to oxidise the copper contained in the copper sulphide material.<br>
Part of the iron is removed from the copper sulphate solution by precipitating<br>
the ferrous sulphate from it, after which the solution is routed to copper<br>
electrolysis. The solution exiting electrolysis, which is dilute in relation to<br>
copper, is routed to a separate stage, in which the ferrous iron still in solution<br>
is oxidised into trivalent before routing the solution back to sulphide leaching.<br>
In the method, the leaching and fomriation of trivalent iron used in leaching<br>
take place in different stages.<br>
EP patent 815,270 describes a method for leaching sulphidic minerals,<br>
where the mineral also contains iron, According to the method, the mineral is<br>
ground to a fineness where the P80 is 20 microns or less. Leaching takes<br>
place by means of ferric iron and sulphuric acid in an open reactor and<br>
oxygen is fed into the reactor to oxidise the ferrous iron formed in sulphide<br>
leaching back into ferric iron. All the examples in the publication describe the<br>
treatment of flotation concentrate. The copper sulphate solution formed in<br>
leaching is routed to conventional extraction and electrowinning.<br>
The drawback of the two last atmospheric methods described above is<br>
considered to be the fact that for leaching to succeed, the mineral has to be<br>
ground very fine, which consumes energy and thus raises grinding costs. In<br><br>
addition, it can be said of the latter method that with oxidation in an open<br>
reactor an excess of oxygen has to be fed in, because it cannot all be taken<br>
back into circulation.<br>
PURPOSE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of the invention is to eliminate the disadvantages of the<br>
methods presented above. A copper sulphide-bearing ore containing pyrite is<br>
fed to leaching in considerably coarser form than that described above,<br>
thereby saving grinding costs. The leaching of ore and oxidation of ferrous<br>
iron into ferric iron takes place with the aid of oxygen in the same stage in<br>
closed reactors in atmospheric conditions, so that the oxygen efficiency is<br>
made higher than in an open reactor. An acidic iron-containing solution is<br>
used for ore leaching, which in addition to ferrous and ferric iron also<br>
includes copper, which acts as a catalyst to promote leaching.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essential features of the invention will be made apparent in the attached<br>
claims.<br>
The invention relates to a method for leaching copper from a copper sulphide<br>
ore containing pyrite, whereby finely ground ore is leached into a solution<br>
containing sulphuric acid and iron in a single stage. The grain size of the ore<br>
is of the order of 95 -100% below 150 m. Oxygen is fed into the leaching<br>
stage and leaching is performed in atmospheric conditions with a solution<br>
having an iron concentration of around 20-50 g/l, of which the amount of<br>
ferric iron is at least 10 g/l and the amount of copper at the start of leaching<br>
is 8-12 g/l.<br>
LIST OF DRAWINGS<br>
A flow chart of the method accordant with the invention is shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method accordant with the invention is particularly suitable for the<br>
leaching of chalcocite-type copper sulphlde-pyrite ore, although of course it<br>
can also be adapted for the leaching of other sulphide ores. The method is<br>
described below with reference to Figure 1. The purpose in the method is to<br>
leach sulphide ore in particular without enrichment pre-treatment. The<br>
conditions of leaching stage 1 are adjusted to be such that as small a part as<br>
possible of the pyrite contained in the ore will dissolve. The ore is ground for<br>
leaching to a grain size of 95 -100 % below 150 micrometres and preferably<br>
to a size of around 50-150 m so that it contains as little as possible of the<br>
finer fractions. The ground ore is fed into the first leaching reactor. The<br>
number of reactors in series in the leaching stage can vary according to<br>
need, but both ore leaching and the oxidation of ferrous iron into ferric iron<br>
takes place during the same stage.<br>
The following reactions typically occur in the leaching of copper sulphide ore:<br>
Cu2S + 2Fe2(SO4)3	→ 2 CuSO4+S + 4 FeSO4	(1)<br>
CuS + Fe2(SO4)3	→ CuSO4+S + 2 FeSO4	(2)<br>
S + 3 Fe2(SO4)3 + H2O	→ 6 FeSO4 + 4 H2SO4	(3)<br>
2FeSO4+ H2SO4 + 1/2 O2	→ Fe2(SO4)3 + H2O	(4)<br>
FeS2 + H2O + 31/2 O2	→ FeSO4 + H2SO4	(5)<br>
A solution is used for leaching copper sulphide ore with a sulphuric acid<br>
concentration of at least 20 g/l, preferably 70 - 95 g/l. The total iron in<br>
solution is 20 - 70 g/l, where the amount of trivalent iron is at least 10 g/l, the<br>
Fe3/Fe2+ ratio is preferably adjusted to the region of 0.5 - 1.2 and the<br>
amount of dissolved copper around 8-12 g/l at the start of leaching.<br>
Preferably the solution is extraction stage raffinate, from which the majority of<br>
the copper has been removed. When the solution used in leaching is the kind<br>
described above, it has been found that reactions 1, 2 and 4 proceed almost<br>
one hundred per cent, but reaction 3 only around 5% and reaction 5<br><br>
(dissolving of pyrite) around 3%. As can be seen from the reactions above,<br>
sulphuric acid is only generated in reactions 3 and 5 and all the rest of the<br>
sulphur is recovered as elemental sulphur.<br>
When copper is present in the solution used for ore leaching, it aids the<br>
regulation of the oxidation-reduction potential of the leaching. Obviously, the<br>
copper concentration of the solution increases as the leaching proceeds,<br>
because the purpose is to leach the copper in the ore, but generally in<br>
leaching accordant with the prior art the copper concentration of the raffinate<br>
is low, in the region of less than 2 g/l.<br>
The leaching potential is adjusted to be 450 - 550 mV vs. Ag/AgCI electrode<br>
at the end of leaching. The relatively high iron concentration in addition to the<br>
copper concentration facilitates the above-mentioned potential level<br>
adjustment. Potential adjustment also facilitates the limitation of pyrite<br>
dissolution, which consumes a lot of oxygen and increases the need for<br>
neutralisation.<br>
Copper sulphide ore leaching takes place at a temperature of 85 - 95°C. The<br>
regulation of the reactor temperature is performed indirectly. One indirect<br>
temperature regulation mechanism is to use baffles, in which a medium, for<br>
instance steam or cooling fluid, is circulated. Another method is to equip the<br>
reactor with heating/cooling coils. The advantage of indirect regulation is the<br>
fact that no excess water is introduced into the leaching stage. The leaching<br>
mother liquor i.e. the extraction raffinate, is preheated to a temperature of 70<br>
- 80°C with the reaction heat generated in leaching.<br>
Typically oxygen is fed into all the leaching stage reactors to oxidise the<br>
ferrous iron into ferric iron, but feeding oxygen into every reactor is not<br>
however absolutely essential. Oxygen can be fed as oxygen, oxygen-<br>
enriched air or air. By means of precise temperature control, the dissolving of<br>
pyrite can also be regulated and thus leaching costs restricted. Reactors are<br><br>
equipped with effective mixers, which keep the solids, liquid and gas in<br>
suspension. The effective mixing maintained in the reactors enables the feed<br>
of a fairly rough solid into the leaching stage. The oxidising gas is preferably<br>
fed below the mixing element, from where the mixer sucks it into the<br>
suspension. The mixing element is composed preferably of two blade mixers<br>
located on the same shaft, which are shaped in a way appropriate for the<br>
purpose. The tip speed of the mixer is adjusted to be less than 5 m/s, so that<br>
the mixer blades do not fundamentally wear out.<br>
The reactors are equipped with a cover so that the gas that accumulates<br>
above the suspension can be circulated back into the suspension with the<br>
aid of the upper blade mixer and only the amount equivalent to the amount of<br>
gases other than oxygen in the gas is removed from the upper section of the<br>
reactor. The reactors are not however autoclaves but act in atmospheric<br>
pressure. The suspension flows from one reactor to another as an overflow.<br>
The solution formed in leaching, which contains copper sulphate known as<br>
PLS (Pregnant Leach Solution), is routed to solids separation and cooling.<br>
Solids separation can be carried out for example in two stages such as<br>
thickening and filtration, but in the illustration for the sake of simplicity it is<br>
depicted as a single stage. The underflow of separation 2 consists of the<br>
gangue of the ore (silicates), undissolved ore such as pyrite, gypsum and a<br>
little elemental sulphur that is generated in the reactions. The overflow of<br>
separation 2 is copper sulphate solution, with a copper concentration of<br>
around 20-50 g/l, and in which there is still present about 20 - 70 g/l iron,<br>
partly in ferrous and ferric form, so that the ferric iron concentration is at least<br>
10 g/l. The sulphuric acid concentration of the solution is of the order of 18-<br>
22 g/l.<br>
The copper sulphate solution is routed to cooling 3, where the solution is<br>
cooled, so that its temperature is suitable for extraction. The ore generally<br>
always also contains a small amount of calcium and arsenic, and now by<br><br>
means of cooling, gypsum and ferric arsenate are precipitated out of the<br>
solution, so that they do not precipitate during extraction into the first<br>
extraction cell.<br>
The copper sulphate solution is routed to liquid-liquid extraction, which is<br>
performed in two stages in accordance with the invention. The fact that the<br>
copper concentration of the raffinate exiting the first extraction stage can be<br>
left higher than normal, whereby the copper contained in the raffinate acts as<br>
a catalyst for leaching may be considered one advantage of two-stage<br>
extraction. Another advantage is the fact that, in connection with the second<br>
extraction stage, substances dissolved from the ore and/or harmful to<br>
leaching and extraction can be removed from the raffinate without great<br>
tosses of copper. Any known copper extractant whatsoever is suitable as<br>
extractant, diluted into a suitable solvent such as kerosene. It is also<br>
beneficial for the method that the extractant concentration in the extraction<br>
solution is adjusted to be high, in the region of 35 - 45%. The passage of the<br>
extraction solution is depicted in the illustration by a dashed line, so the<br>
solution entering extraction, BO (barren organic), is shown by a dashed and<br>
dotted line and the copper-containing LO (loaded organic) solution exiting<br>
extraction is represented by a dotted line. In the first stage 4 of extraction, 65<br>
- 75% of the copper content of the PLS is extracted into the extraction<br>
solution, whereupon the copper concentration of the aqueous solution to be<br>
removed from extraction i.e. the raffinate, remains 8-12 g/l. As the copper<br>
concentration of the raffinate has fallen, its sulphuric acid concentration has<br>
risen in accordance with the following reaction:<br>
CuSO4 + 2 HR	→ CuR2 + H2SO4	(6)<br>
In the reaction, R means the hydrocarbon part of the extractant, which forms<br>
a complex with the copper in the organic solution and the hydrogen ion part<br>
of the extractant forms sulphuric acid in the aqueous solution with the<br>
sulphate.<br><br>
The majority, i.e. over 90% of the raffinate is routed back to ore leaching 1,<br>
but a small part, in the region of 3-8%, is routed to the second extraction<br>
stage 5. This part is adjusted according to requirements so that the iron<br>
concentration of the raffinate does not rise above 70 g/l or that its impurity<br>
content such as its zinc content does not rise too much. The raffinate to be<br>
routed to the second extraction stage is neutralised in neutralisation stage 6<br>
before the extraction stage by means of a suitable neutralising agent such as<br>
lime or limestone. Before neutralisation the sulphuric acid concentration of<br>
the solution is around 60 - 70 g/l and it is neutralised to a pH value of 1.6 -<br>
1.8, so that the solution is suitable for extraction. In the second extraction<br>
stage, copper is removed from the solution until the concentration is around<br>
0.5 g/l or even smaller. The raffinate solution II from the second extraction<br>
stage is removed from the circuit via precipitation stage 7, whereupon the<br>
zinc and iron that dissolved from the ore during leaching are precipitated<br>
from the solution, i.e. mainly the iron of the pyrite, for example by means of<br>
lime. The deposit from neutralisation 6, which is mainly gypsum, is also<br>
routed to the precipitation stage. The precipitate and solution formed are<br>
removed and processed in an appropriate manner.<br>
The LO solutions from both extraction stages, containing an abundance of<br>
copper, are combined and routed to the washing and stripping stages, which<br>
are depicted together as reference number 8. The aqueous solution exiting<br>
stripping, which is the RE (rich electrolyte) to be routed to electrolysis 9,<br>
contains around 45 - 50 g/l copper. Electrolysis is a conventional<br>
electrowinning. The LE (lean electrolyte) exiting electrolysis is recirculated as<br>
the aqueous solution for stripping.<br>
EXAMPLES<br><br><br>
Example 1<br>
In a test we leached copper sulphide-pyrite ore that had been ground to a<br>
fineness of 95 % below 150 microns. Leaching was carried out in five<br>
reactors arranged in series and leaching occurred at a temperature of 90°C.<br>
Leaching took place by means of recirculated raffinate from the first<br>
extraction stage. Leaching time was 9 h and during this time 91.8% of the<br>
copper dissolved. The analysis of the ore was as follows:<br><br>
The analyses of the raffinate used for leaching and the PLS formed in<br>
leaching are given in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The leaching stage reactors were equipped with baffles, where steam was<br>
routed inside the first reactor baffles to heat the reactor space. The raffinate<br>
was heated before being fed into the leaching stage with heat recovered in<br>
PLS cooling, but the final temperature control of the solution was performed<br>
by means of baffle steam. Since the reactions occurring in leaching are<br>
exothermic, the subsequent reactors were cooled by means of the cooling<br>
fluid flowing in the baffles. The solution flowed from one reactor to another by<br>
gravity. The reactors were mixed with the aid of double-bladed mixers and<br>
the oxygen required for oxidising iron was fed below the mixer. The redox<br>
potential of the leaching stage was adjusted to be a value of 400 - 550 mV<br>
vs. Ag/AgCI electrode.<br>
The suspension of solution and solids to be removed from the last leaching<br>
reactor was routed to thickening. The composition of the thickener underflow<br>
was as follows: Cu 0.55%, Fe 31.1% and Zn 0.1%.<br>
The thickener overflow was a copper-rich PLS, which was routed to cooling<br>
prior to extraction. The solution was cooled to a temperature below 38°C, to<br>
make it suitable for extraction. In connection with the cooling of the solution<br>
gypsum and ferric arsenate were precipitated from it, and were removed<br>
from the solution by means of thickening and filtration.<br>
The extraction of the PLS was carried out in two stages, the first of which<br>
comprised two extraction cells in series. The copper concentration of the<br>
PLS was 40 g/l. The extractant concentration used for the BO organic<br>
extraction solution was 40%. During the first extraction stage about 70% of<br>
the copper in the PLS was extracted into the organic solution and the copper<br>
concentration of the remaining raffinate was about 12 g/l.<br>
The raffinate from extraction was mostly recirculated back to ore leaching,<br>
but about 6% of it was routed to the pre-neutralisation preceding the second<br>
extraction stage, which aids the control of the iron and zinc content of the<br><br>
solution circulating in the leaching and extraction circuit. In addition to the<br>
raffinate, the wash waters of various precipitates were routed to pre-<br>
neutralisation so that the Cu concentration of the solution became 7.2 g/l.<br>
Solution neutralisation was carried out with lime from an H2SO4<br>
concentration of 80 g/l to a pH value of 1.6 - 1.8. The clear solution resulting<br>
from solids separation was routed to the second extraction stage, which<br>
comprised a single extraction cell. The extraction solution used was the<br>
same extraction solution as that in the first extraction stage. In the second<br>
stage, 93% of the copper contained in the aqueous solution was extracted,<br>
so that the Cu concentration of the solution to be removed from this stage<br>
was only 0.5 g/l.<br>
The organic solutions rich in copper exiting both extraction stages were<br>
combined and routed to the stripping and washing stage, which consisted of<br>
two stripping cells, one extraction solution washing cell and an organic LO<br>
solution tank. During the washing stage the chlorides and ferric iron<br>
contained in the solution were removed from the organic solution with a<br>
water wash.<br>
In the stripping cells copper was extracted from the organic solution into an<br>
aqueous solution, which was the lean electrolyte LE exiting copper<br>
electrowinning. The aqueous solution exiting stripping was an electrolyte rich<br>
in copper (RE), which was routed to electrolysis.<br>
Example 2<br>
In a test we leached copper sulphide-pyrite ore that had been ground to a<br>
fineness of 95 % below 150 microns. Leaching was carried out in one reactor<br>
at a temperature of 90°C. The leaching reactor was equipped with baffles.<br>
The mixing element was equipped with both an upper and lower mixer. The<br>
upper mixer was an A-type and the lower mixer a GLS-type. Leaching time<br>
was 8 h. A synthetic leaching solution corresponded to an extraction<br>
raffinate, in which the Fe3+ / Fe2+ ratio was adjusted to a value of 0.75:1. The<br><br>
solution was preheated before being fed into the leaching reactor. The solids<br>
content of the slurry in the reactor was adiusted to 400 g/l. The oxygen feed<br>
amount in the test was a constant 80 ml/min/l (slurry). The analyses of the<br>
ground ore and leaching solution were as follows:<br><br>
In this test 93.9% of the copper dissolved. There was 41.5 g/l copper, 49.4<br>
g/l iron and 21.1 g/l sulphuric acid in the leaching product solution.<br>
Consequently the composition of the product solution cooled to 
suitable feed solution as such for the following sub-process i.e. copper<br>
extraction. The analysis of the solids separated from the slurry, the leaching<br>
residue, after leaching is presented in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
In a test a copper-rich PLS obtained from leaching was fed into an extraction<br>
system, which consisted of two extraction cells, a loaded organic LO tank, a<br>
washing cell and two stripping cells. The extraction system operates on the<br>
countercurrent principle. The amount of organic phase extractant was 45 vol<br>
%. The temperature of all the different solutions was 35°C.<br>
In extraction 74% of the copper contained in the PLS transferred to the<br>
organic phase. Water droplets were removed from the loaded organic phase<br>
in the LO tank. Ferric iron was washed out of the organic phase loaded with<br>
copper in the washing cell with acidic wash water. In stripping the copper<br>
was removed from the loaded organic phase with an electrolyte solution<br>
(LE), forming an electrolyte solution rich in copper (RE). Both test product<br>
solutions were suitable for further processing; the raffinate as a mother liquor<br>
for leaching and the RE for electrolysis.<br>
The analyses of the leaching product solution or PLS, the feed solution of<br>
leaching or extraction raffinate, stripping feed solution (LE) and stripping<br>
product solution (RE) are presented in Table 5.<br><br><br><br>

is around 0. 5 g/l.<br>
16.	A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the ore<br>
leaching stage is performed in several closed reactors connected in<br>
series, into which an oxygen-containing gas is fed below the mixing<br>
element of the reactor and where said reactors are equipped with<br>
baffles.<br>
17.	A method according to claim 16, characterised in that the<br>
temperature of the reactors is adjusted indirectly by means of an<br>
agent fed inside the baffles.<br>
18.	A method according to claim 16, characterised in that the leaching<br>
stage reactors are equipped with a mixing element, which is<br>
composed of two mixers located on the same shaft in order to form a<br>
suspension of solids, liquid and gas.<br><br>
The invention relates to a method whereby copper is recovered from a copper sulphide ore containing pyrite. According<br>
to the method the ore is ground and leached into a solution containing sulphuric acid in atmospheric conditions by means<br>
of trivalent copper. As the copper sulphide leaches out, the trivalent iron is reduced to divalent and is oxidised back to trivalent by<br>
means of oxygen during leaching. Leaching is carried out in a closed reactor, where the undissolved gas rising from the solution<br>
in the upper section of the reactor is circulated back into the suspension of solution, solids and gas. Leaching is performed in the<br>
presence of both divalent and trivalent iron and preferably with the dissolved copper acting as a catalyst to promote leaching. The<br>
conditions are adjusted to be such that the pyrite of the ore essentially does not dissolve.</td>
