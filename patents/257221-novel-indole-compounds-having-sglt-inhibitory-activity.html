				<td>DESCRIPTION INDOLE DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel indole derivatives possessing activity as inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT) found in the intestine or kidney.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Diet therapy and exercise therapy are essential in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. When these therapies do not sufficiently control conditions of patients, insulin or anti-diabetic agents are used. At the present, biguanides, sulfonylureas, insulin-sensitizing agents and a-glucosidase inhibitors are used for anti-diabetic agents. However, these anti-diabetic agents have various side effects. For example, biguanides cause lactic acidosis, sulfonylureas cause significant hypoglycemia, insulin-sensitizing agents cause edema and heart failure, and a-glucosidase inhibitors cause abdominal bloating and diarrhea. Under these circumstances, new anti-diabetic drugs that eliminate these side effects are anticipated.<br>
Recently, it has been reported that hyperglycemia participates in the onset and progression of diabetes mellitus. This theory is called glucose toxicity theory. Namely, chronic hyperglycemia leads to decrease of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, the plasma glucose level is elevated, and as a result, diabetes mellitus is self-exacerbated [cf., Diabetologia, vol. 28, p. 119 (1985); Diabetes Care, vol. 13, p. 610 (1990), etc.]. Based on this theory, it is expected that normalization of plasma glucose level interrupts the aforementioned self-exacerbating<br><br>
cycle and the prevention or treatment of diabetes mellitus can be achieved.<br>
It is considered that one method for the treatment of hyperglycemia is to excrete an excess amount of glucose directly into urine so that the blood glucose concentration can be normalized. For example, by inhibiting sodium-dependent glucose transporters being present at the proximal convoluted tubule of kidney, the re-absorption of glucose at the kidney is inhibited whereby the excretion of glucose into urine can be promoted and the blood glucose level can be decreased. In fact, it is confirmed that by continuous subcutaneous administration of an SGLT inhibitor, phlorizin, to diabetic animal models, the blood glucose level thereof can be normalized, and that by keeping the blood glucose level normal for a long time, the insulin secretion and insulin resistance can be improved [cf., Journal of Clinical Investigation, vol. 79, p. 1510 (1987); ibid., vol. 80, p. 1037 (1987); ibid., vol. 87, p. 561 (1991), etc.].<br>
In addition, by treating diabetic animal models with an SGLT inhibitor for a long time, insulin secretion response and insulin sensitivity of the animal models are improved without incurring any adverse affects on the kidney or imbalance in blood levels of electrolytes, and as a result, the onset and progress of diabetic nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy are prevented [cf., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 42, p. 5311 (1999); British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 132, p. 578 (2001) , etc.].<br>
In view of the above, SGLT inhibitors are expected to improve insulin secretion and insulin resistance by decreasing the blood glucose level in diabetic patients and to prevent the onset and progress of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications.<br>
WO 01/27128 discloses aryl C-glycosides having the following structure:<br><br><br>

The compounds of formula (I) of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be prepared by deprotecting compounds of formula (II):<br><br>
wherein R5 is a protecting group for a hydroxy group, and the other symbols are the same as defined above, followed by converting the resulting compound into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, if desired.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are believed to be novel and form a further aspect of this invention.<br>
In the compounds of formula (II), the protecting group for a hydroxy group can be selected from conventional protecting groups for a hydroxy group, and examples of such protecting group include benzyl, alkanoyl such as acetyl, and alkylsily such as trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl. Further, the protecting group for a hydroxy group may form acetal<br><br>
or silylacetal together with adjacent hydroxy groups. Examples of such protecting group include an alkylidene group such as isopropylidene and sec-butylidene, a benzylidene group, and a dialkylsilylene group such as di-tert-butylsilylene group. Preferably, R5 is alkanoyl such as acetyl.<br>
The deprotection can be carried out according to kinds of the protecting group to be removed, and conventional methods such as reduction, hydrolysis, acid treatment, and fluoride treatment, can be used for the deprotection.<br>
For example, when a benzyl group is to be removed, the deprotection can be carried out by (1) catalytic reduction using a palladium catalyst (e.g., palladium-carbon and palladium hydroxide) under hydrogen atmosphere in a suitable inert solvent (e.g., methanol, ethyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate) ; (2) treatment with an dealkylating agent such as boron tribromide, boron trichloride, boron trichloride • dime thylsulfide complex, or iodotrimethylsilane in an inert solvent (e.g., dichloromethane); or (3) treatment with an alkylthiol such as ethanethiol in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g., boron trifluoride * diethyl ether complex) in a suitable inert solvent (e.g., dichloromethane).<br>
When a protecting group is removed by hydrolysis, the hydrolysis can be carried out by treating the compounds of formula (II) with a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, and sodium ethoxide) in a suitable inert solvent (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methanol, ethyl alcohol, and water).<br>
Acid treatment can be carried out by treating the compounds of formula (II) with an acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid) in a suitable solvent (e.g., methanol, and ethyl alcohol).<br>
In case of the fluoride treatment, it can be carried out by treating the compounds of formula (II) with a fluoride (e.g., hydrogen fluoride,  hydrogen fluoride-pyridine,  tetrabutyl-<br><br>
ammonium fluoride, etc.) in a suitable inert solvent (e.g., acetic acid, alcohols (methanol, ethyl alcohol, etc.)/ acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran).<br>
The deprotection reaction can be preferably carried out at lowered, ambient or elevated temperature, for example, from 0°C to 50°C, more preferably from 0°C to room temperature.<br>
The compound of the present invention thus obtained may be isolated and purified by a conventional method well known in the organic synthetic chemistry such as recrystallization, column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and the like.<br>
The compound of formula (II) can be prepared in accordance with steps described in Schemes 1-3.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W. Greene et al., "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999. The protecting groups may be removed at a subsequent step using methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>

The condensation can be carried out, according to the Friedel-Crafts acylation well known in the art, in a suitable solvent in the presence of a Lewis acid.<br>
Examples of the Lewis acid include aluminum chloride, boron trifluoride • diethyl ether complex, tin(IV) chloride, and titanium tetrachloride.<br>
The solvent can be selected from any one which does not disturb the Friedel-Crafts reaction, and examples of the solvent include halogenoalkanes such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and dichloroethane.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at lowered, ambient or<br><br>
elevated temperature, for example, from ~30°C to 60°C. Step 2:<br>
A compound of formula (III) can be prepared by reducing the compound of formula (IV).<br>
The reduction can be carried out by treating the compound (IV) with a reducing agent in a suitable solvent.<br>
Examples of the reducing agent include borohydrides (e.g., sodium borohydride  with  or  without  cerium(III)  chloride heptahydrate,  sodium  triacetoxyborohydride)  and  aluminum hydrides (e.g., lithium aluminum hydride, and diisobutyl aluminum hydride).<br>
The solvent can be selected from any one which does not disturb the reaction and examples of the solvent include ethers(e.g., tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, and dioxane), alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethyl alcohol and 2-propanol) and a mixture of these solvents.<br>
The reduction reaction can be carried out at lowered, or ambient temperature, for example, from ™30°C to 25°C. Step 3:<br>
A compound of formula (II) can be prepared by reducing the compound of formula (III).<br>
The reduction of the compound (III) can be carried out by treatment with a silane reagent or a borohydride in the presence of an acid in a suitable solvent or without a solvent.<br>
