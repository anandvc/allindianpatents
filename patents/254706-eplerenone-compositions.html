EPLERENONE COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compound eplerenone as an active ingredient, methods of treatment comprising administering such pharmaceutical compositions to a subject in need thereof, and the use of such compositions in the manufacture of medicaments.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The compound methyl hydrogen 9,lla-epoxy-17a-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-7a,21-dicarboxylate, y-lactone (also referred to herein as eplerenone) was first reported in Grob et al., U.S. Patent 4,559,332 which describes and claims a class of 9,11-epoxy steroid compounds and their salts together with processes for the preparation of such compounds. These 9,11-epoxy steroid compounds are described as aldosterone antagonists that can be administered in a therapeutically effective amount to treat pathological conditions associated with hyperaldosteronism such as hypertension, cardiac insufficiency and cirrhosis of the liver. U.S. Patent 4,559,332 contains general references to formulations for the administration of these 9,11-epoxy steroid compounds such as tablets and capsules.<br>
Ng et al., WO 98/25948 later disclosed additional synthetic processes for the preparation of a similar class of 9,11-epoxy steroid compounds and their salts, including eplerenone. Both U.S. Patent 4,559,332 and WO 98/25948 are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Eplerenone has the structure:<br><br><br>
Spironolactone, however, has antiandrogenic activity that can result in gynecomastia and impotence in men, and weak progestational activity that produces menstrual irregularities in women. Accordingly, there is interest in the development of additional active aldosterone antagonists such as eplerenone that do not interact with other steroid receptor systems such as glucocorticoid, progestin and androgen steroid receptor systems and/or that provide for a broader range of treatment. Commercial formulations of spironolactone (sold under the name Aldactone™) contain 25, 50 or 100 mg doses of spironolactone in a matrix comprising, among other carrier materials, calcium sulfate dihydrate as a diluent, maize starch as a disintegrant, polyvidone K-30 as a binding agent, magnesium stearate as a lubricant, flavor, colorant, and coating ingredients that include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyethylene glycol 400.<br><br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has been found that pharmaceutical compositions comprising the active ingredient eplerenone in a daily dosage amount from about 10 mg to about 1000 rag are unique compositions exhibiting superior performance as aldosterone receptor blockers, Such pharmaceutical compositions exhibit superior activity, potency, safety and therapeutic effectiveness at this dosage range. These compositions provide eplerenone to a patient at a dosage that is sufficient to provide prolonged blocking of aldosterone receptors and thus confer the desired therapeutic benefit while maintaining a safe clearance time. Undesirable side-effects such as, but not limited to, gastrointestinal irritation, antiandrogenic and progestational activity are also minimized with the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
These pharmaceutical compositions are advantageously used to block aldosterone receptors and, among other pharmacological actions, can increase sodium and water excretion with a concomitant potassium-sparing effect. Such compositions can be specifically employed for the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure; hypertension (especially the management of mild to moderate hypertension); edema associated with liver insufficiency; post-myocardial infarction; cirrhosis of the liver; stroke prevention; and reduction of heart rate for subjects exhibiting an accelerated heart rate. These pharmaceutical compositions exhibit, among other features, (i) improved selectivity for<br><br>
aldosterone receptors, (ii) reduced binding affinity to the progesterone and androgen receptor, and (iii) reduced interference from plasma proteins.<br>
Besides being useful for human treatment, these compositions are also useful for veterinary treatment of companion animals, exotic animals and farm animals, including mammals, rodents and the like. More preferred animals include horses, dogs, and cats.<br>
Unformulated eplerenone administered in capsule form is not well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, a need exists for suitable eplerenone dosage forms.   The J pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide these dosage forms and exhibit! one or more superior properties relative to unformulated eplerenone and/or other compositions comprising eplerenone. These superior properties include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:<br>
(I)	improved bioavailability;<br>
(2 ) improved solubility of the pharmaceutical composition;<br>
(3)	decreased disintegration times for immediate release oral dosage forms;<br>
(4)	decreased dissolution times for immediate release oral dosage forms;<br>
(5)	improved dissolution profiles for controlled release oral dosage forms;<br>
(6)	decreased tablet friability;<br>
(7)	increased tablet hardness;<br>
(8)	improved safety for oral dosage forms;<br>
(9)	reduced moisture content and/or hygroscopicity for oral dosage forms;<br>
(10)	improved composition wettability;<br>
(II)	improved particle size distribution of eplerenone;<br>
(12)	improved composition compressibility;<br>
(13)	improved composition flow properties;<br>
(14)	improved chemical stability of the final oral dosage form;<br>
(15)	improved physical stability of the final oral dosage form;<br>
(16)	decreased tablet size;<br>
(17)	improved blend uniformity;<br>
(18)	improved dose uniformity;<br>
(19)	increased granule density for wet granulated compositions;<br>
(20)	reduced water requirements for wet granulation;<br><br>
(21)	reduced wet granulation time; and/or<br>
(22)	reduced drying time for wet granulated mixtures.<br>
Eplerenone Dosage of Pharmaceutical Composition<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise eplerenone in an amount from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise eplerenone in an amount from about 20 mg to about 400 mg, more preferably from about 25 mg to about 200 mg, and still more preferablyvfrom about 25 mg to about 150 mg.<br>
Treatment of Specific Conditions and Disorders<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful where administration of an aldosterone receptor blocker is indicated. It has been found that these compositions are particularly effective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure; hypertension (especially the management of mild to moderate hypertension); edema associated with liver insufficiency; post-myocardial infarction; cirrhosis of the liver; stroke prevention; and reduction of heart rate for subjects exhibiting an accelerated heart rate.<br>
For the treatment of heart failure, the pharmaceutical composition preferably provides a daily dosage of eplerenone in the amount of about 25 mg to about 200 mg, more preferably about 25 mg to about 75 mg, and still more preferably about 50 mg.  A daily dose of about 0.33 to 2.67 mg/kg body weight (based upon an average body weight of about 75 kg), preferably between about 0.33 and about 1.00 mg/kg body weight and most preferably 0.67 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day, preferably one dose per day.<br>
For the treatment of hypertension, the pharmaceutical composition preferably provides a daily dosage of eplerenone in the amount of about 50 mg to about 300 mg, more preferably about 50 mg to about 150 mg, and still more preferably about 100 mg.  A daily dose of about 0.67 to 4.00 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 0.67 and about 2.00 mg/kg body weight and most preferably about 1.33 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day, preferably one dose per day.<br>
For the treatment of edema associated with liver insufficiency, the pharmaceutical composition preferably provides a daily dosage of eplerenone in the amount of about 50 mg<br><br>
to about 500 mg, more preferably about 100 mg to 400 about mg, and still more preferably about 300 mg.  A daily dose of about 0.67 to 6.67 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 1.33 and about 5.33 mg/kg body weight and most preferably about 4.00 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day, preferably one dose per day.<br>
It has been found that the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide a therapeutic effect as aldosterone receptor blockers in humans over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after oral administration.<br>
In general, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide a daily dosage of eplerenone sufficient to cause an increase in blood serum renin and aldosterone levels in humans over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after oral administration. Specifically, these compositions provide a daily dosage of eplerenone sufficient to cause an average increase in blood serum renin concentrations over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after ingestion of the composition of at least about 10% . Similarly, these compositions provide a daily dosage of eplerenone sufficient to cause an average increase in blood serum aldosterone concentrations over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after ingestion of the composition of at least about 50%.<br>
It also has been found that the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide a daily dosage of eplerenone sufficient to cause an average increase in the urinary logl0 (sodium/potassium) ratio in humans over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after ingestion of the composition.<br>
It also has been found that the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide a daily dosage of eplerenone sufficient to cause an average decrease in diasystolic blood pressure in humans over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours, preferably about 24 hours, after ingestion of the composition of at least about 5%.<br>
Unit Dosages<br>
Dosage unit forms of the pharmaceutical compositions may typically contain, for example, 10, 20, 25, 37.5, 50, 75,100,125,150,175, 200, 250, 300, 350 or 400 mg of eplerenone. Preferred dosage unit forms contain about 25, 50 or 100 mg of eplerenone. The<br><br>
dosage unit form may be selected to accommodate the desired frequency of administration used to achieve the specified daily dosage. The amount of the unit dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition that is administered and the dosage regimen for treating the condition or disorder will depend on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the condition or disorder, the route and frequency of administration, and thus may vary widely.<br>
It has been found, however, that the efficacy of the required daily dosage of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention does not appear to materially differ for once-a-day administration relative to twice-a-day administration with respect to the compositions described in this application. It is hypothesized that the compositions of the present invention deliver an amount of eplerenone sufficient to inhibit a protracted genomic response caused by aldosterone binding to the aldosterone receptor site. Interruption of aldosterone binding by eplerenone prevents aldosterone-induced gene product synthesis resulting in an extended period of functional aldosterone receptor blockade that does not require a sustained plasma eplerenone concentration.   Accordingly, once-a-day administration is preferred for such tablets for convenience of administration.<br>
Preparation of Eplerenone<br>
The eplerenone of the novel pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be prepared using the methods set forth in Grob et ah, U.S. Patent 4,559,332 and Ng et ah, WO 98/25948, particularly scheme 1 set forth in Ng. et ah, WO 98/25948.<br>
Form of Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise eplerenone in association with one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, excipients and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as "carrier materials"). The carrier materials must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and must not be deleterious to the recipient. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for administration by any suitable route by selection of appropriate carrier materials and a dosage of eplerenone effective for the treatment intended. For example, these compositions may be prepared in a form suitable for<br><br>
administration orally, intravascularJy, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly (IM) or rectally. Accordingly, the carrier material employed can be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose composition, for example, a tablet, which can contain from about 1 % to about 95%, preferably about 10% to about 75%, more preferably about 20% to about 60%, and still more preferably about 20% to about 40%, by weight of eplerenone. Such pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy, consisting essentially of admixing the components.<br>
Oral Administration<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may contain a desired amount of eplerenone and be in the form of, for example, a tablet, a hard or soft capsule, a lozenge, a cachet, a dispensable powder, granules, a suspension, an elixir, a liquid, or any other form reasonably adapted for oral administration, Such a pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a discrete dosage unit containing a predetermined amount of eplerenone, such as tablets or capsules. Such oral dosage forms may further comprise, for example, buffering agents. Tablets, pills and the like additionally can be prepared with enteric coatings. Unit dosage tablets or capsules are preferred.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include, for example, lozenges comprising eplerenone in a flavored base, such as sucrose, and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising eplerenone in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include phannaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise, for example, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Examples of suitable liquid dosage forms include, but are not limited, aqueous solutions comprising eplerenone and P-cyclodextrin or a water soluble derivative of p-cyclodextrin such as sulfobutyl ether p-cyclodextrin; heptakis-2,6-di-0-methyl- P-cyclodextrin; hydroxypropyl- p-cyclodextrin; and dimethyl- P-cyclodextrin.<br><br>
Administration Bv Injection<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be administered by injection (intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or jet). Such injectable compositions may employ, for example, saline, dextrose, or water as a suitable carrier material. The pH of the composition may be adjusted, if necessary, with suitable acid, base, or buffer. Suitable bulking, dispersing, wetting or suspending agents, including mannitol and polyethylene glycol (such as PEG 400), may also be included in the composition. A suitable parenteral composition can also include eplerenone in injection vials. Aqueous solutions can be added to dissolve the compound prior to injection.<br>
Rectal Administration<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in the form of a suppository or the like. Such rectal formulations preferably contain eplerenone in a total amount of, for example, 0.075 to 30% w/w, preferably 0.2 to 20% w/w and most preferably 0.4 to 15% w/w. Carrier materials such as cocoa butter, theobroma oil, and other oil and polyethylene glycol suppository bases can be used in such compositions. Other carrier materials such as coatings (for example, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose film coating) and disintegrants (for example, croscarmellose sodium and crosslinked povidone) can also be employed if desired.<br>
As indicated above, these pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association eplerenone and the carrier material or carriers materials. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binding agent, lubricant, inert diluent and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets can be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br><br>
Carrier Materials<br>
As noted above, for therapeutic purposes, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise eplerenone in a desired amount in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier materials appropriate to the indicated route of administration.  Oral dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention preferably comprise eplerenone in a desired amount admixed with one or more carrier materials selected from the group consisting of diluents, disintegrants, binding agents and adhesives, wetting agents, lubricants, anti-adherent agents and/or other carrier materials. More preferably, such compositions are tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may be in the form of immediate release capsules or tablets, or may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided, for example, in a dispersion of eplerenone in hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.<br>
Injectable dosage forms preferably are adapted for parenteral injection. Preferably, these dosage forms comprise eplerenone in aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions, such as eplerenone suspended or dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various buffers. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration.<br>
The selection and combination of carrier materials used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provides compositions exhibiting improved performance with respect to, among other properties, efficacy, bioavailability, clearance times, stability, compatibility of eplerenone and carrier materials, safety, dissolution profile, disintegration profile and/or other pharmacokinetic, chemical and/or physical properties. The carrier materials preferably are water soluble or water dispersible and have wetting properties to offset the low aqueous solubility and hydrophobicity of eplerenone. Where the composition is formulated as a tablet, the combination of carrier materials selected provides tablets that may exhibit, among other properties, improved dissolution and disintegration profiles, hardness, crushing strength, and/or friability.<br><br>
Diluents<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention optionally may comprise one or more diluents as a carrier material. Suitable diluents may include, either individually or in combination, such diluents as lactose USP; lactose USP, anyhydrous; lactose USP, spray dried; starch USP; directly compressible starch; mannitol USP; sorbitol; dextrose monohydrate; micrpcrystalline cellulose NF; dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate NF; sucrose-based diluents; confectioner's sugar; monobasic calcium sulfate monohydrate; calcium sulfate dihydrate NF; calcium lactate trihydrate granular NF; dextrates NF (e.g., Emdex); Celutab; dextrose (e.g., Cerelose); inositol; hydrolyzed cereal solids such as the Maltrons and Mor-Rex; amylose; Rexcel; powdered cellulose (e.g., Elcema); calcium carbonate; glycine; bentonite; polyvinylpyrrolidone; and the like. The present pharmaceutical compositions comprise one or more diluents in the range of about 5% to about 99%, preferably about 25% to about 90%, and more preferably about 40% to about 80%, of the total weight of the composition. The diluent or diluents selected preferably exhibit suitable compressibility and pre-compression flow properties.<br>
Lactose and microcrystalline cellulose, either individually or in combination, are preferred diluents. Both diluents are chemically compatible with eplerenone. The use of extragranular microcrystalline cellulose (that is, microcrystalline cellulose added to a wet granulated composition after the drying step) in addition to intragranular microcrystalline cellulose (that is, microcrystalline cellulose added to the composition during or before the wet granulation step) can be used to improve hardness and/or disintegration time. Lactose, especially lactose monohydrate, is particularly preferred. Lactose typically provides pharmaceutical compositions having suitable eplerenone relea&amp;e rates, stability, pre-compression flowability, and drying properties at a relatively low diluent cost.<br>

The present pharmaceutical compositions comprise one or more disintegrants in the range of about 0.5% to about 30%, preferably about 1% to about 10%, and more preferably about 2% to about 6%, of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Croscarmellose sodium is a preferred disintegrant for tablet formulations, preferably in the range of about 1% to about 10%, preferably about 2% to about 6%, and more preferably about 5%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Binding Agents and Adhesives<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention optionally may comprise one or more binding agents or adhesives as a carrier material.   Such binding agents and adhesives preferably impart sufficient cohesion to the powders to allow for normal processing such as sizing, lubrication, compression and packaging, but still allow the tablet to disintegrate and the composition to dissolve upon ingestion. Suitable binding agents and adhesives may include, either individually or in combination, such binding agents and adhesives as acacia; tragacanth; sucrose; gelatin; glucose; starch; cellulose materials such as, but not limited to, methylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (e.g., Tylose); alginic acid and salts of alginic acid; magnesium aluminum silicate; polyethylene glycol; guar gum; polysaccharide acids; bentonites; polyvinylpyrrolidone; polymethacrylates; hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC); hydroxypropylcellulose (Klucel); ethylcellulose (Ethocel); pregelatinized starch (such as National 1511 and Starch 1500).

Methoxy content of the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose typically may range up to about 15% to 35%, while hydroxypropyl content typically may range up to about 15%, preferably about 2% to about 12%.<br>
Wetting Agents<br>
Eplerenone is largely insoluble in aqueous solution. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention optionally may comprise one or more wetting agents as a carrier material, particularly for tablet formulations. Such wetting agents preferably maintain eplerenone in solution and improve the relative bioavailability of the pharmaceutical composition. Suitable wetting agents may include, either individually or in combination, such wetting agents as oleic acid; glyceryl monostearate; sorbitan mono-oleate; sorbitan monolaurate; triethanolamine oleate; polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate; polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate; sodium oleate; and sodium iauryl sulfate.

Eplerenone Particle Sim<br>
While the pharmaceutical compositions are effective for broad range of particle sizes for the inital eplerenone starting material used in the compositions, it has been found that reduction of the particle size can improve eplerenone bioavailablity. Accordingly, the D,,, particle size (that is, the particle size of at least 90% of the particles) of the eplerenone used as a starting material in the composition preferably is less than about 200 microns, more preferably less than about 150 microns, still more preferably less than about 100 microns, and still more preferably less than 90 microns.

Granulatinn Particle Size and Flow Properties<br>
While the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be prepared, for example, by direct encapsulation or direct compression, they preferably are wet granulated prior to encapsulation or compression. Wet granulation, among other matters, densities the compositions resulting in improved flow properties, improved compression characteristics and easier metering or weight dispensing of the final compositions. The particle size of the granulation is not narrowly critical, the important parameters being that the average particle size of the granules preferably allows for convenient handling and processing and, for tablets, permits the formation of a directly compressible mixture that forms pharmaceutical^ acceptable tablets. The desired tap and bulk densities of the granulation are normally<br><br>
between from about 0.3 g/ml to about 1.0 g/ml, preferably between about 0.4 g/ml to about 0.8 g/ml.<br>
Hardness<br>
For tablet formulations, the pharmaceutical composition in an amount sufficient to make a uniform batch of tablets is subjected to tableting in a conventional production scale tableting machine at normal compression pressure (for example, about 1 KN to about 50 KN). Any tablet hardness convenient with respect to handling, manufacture, storage and ingestion may be employed. Hardness in the range of about 3.5 kp to about 22 kp is typically acceptable, with about 3.5 kp to about 9 kp preferred for 25 mg tablets, about 5 kp to about 13 kp preferred for 50 mg tablets, and about 8 kp to about 22 kp preferred for 100 mg tablets.

Controlled Release Oral Formulations<br>
Oral delivery of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can include controlled release formulations, including controlled release formulations well known in the art, providing prolonged or sustained delivery of the drug to the gastrointestinal tract by any number of mechanisms. Such prolonged or sustained release mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, pH sensitive release from the dosage form based on the changing pH of the small intestine; slow erosion of a tablet or capsule; retention in the stomach based on the physical properties of the formulation; bioadhesion of the dosage form to the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract; or enzymatic release of eplerenone from the dosage form. The intended effect is to extend the time period over which eplerenone is delivered to the site of action by manipulation of the dosage form. Thus, enteric-coated and enteric-coated controlled release formulations are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The controlled release compositions comprise eplerenone in a desired amount, preferably in a range as previously discussed above, that is, in an amount of about 10 mg to about 1000 mg, more preferably about 20 mg to 400 mg, still more preferably about 25 mg to 200 mg, and still more preferably about 25 mg to 150 mg. Preferred controlled release compositions are in the form of tablets or capsules, particularly tablets or capsules comprising eplerenone in an amount of 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg. The controlled release compositions may or may not be in a single dosage form. Such controlled release compositions, however, preferably are in a single dose oral form. A once-a-day controlled<br><br>
release tablet or capsule typically comprises eplerenone in a range of about 25 mg to about 150 mg.<br>
A controlled-release dosage form as defined in US Pharmacopeia XXII includes extended release dosage forms that allow at least a twofold reduction in dosing frequency as compared to the drug presented as a conventional dosage form and delayed release dosage forms which release the drug at a time other than promptly after administration. The controlled release composition may be, and preferably is, a sustained release or delayed/modified release form.<br>
One type of controlled release composition, for example, achieves controlled release by use of a matrix tablet composition. Suitable matrix forming materials are waxes (e.g., carnauba, bees wax, paraffin wax, ceresine, shellac wax, fatty acids, and fatty alcohols); oils, hardened oils or fats (e.g., hardened rapeseed oil, castor oil, beef tallow, palm oil, and soya bean oil); polymers (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, methacrylates (PMMA), and carbomer); alginates; xanthum gums; and other carrier materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Other suitable matrix tableting materials include, but are not limited to, microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and ethyl cellulose. Other types of controlled release compositions may achieve controlled release by use of granulates, coated powders, pellets, or the like, by use of multi-layering, and/or by used of suitable coatings. Still other controlled release compositions include an osmotic pump (such as described in GB 2207052 published January 25,1989), or combinations of the above.<br>
Suitable coating materials for use in the preparation of controlled release compositions include, but are not limited to, any pharmaceutically acceptable polymer such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetates, polymethacrylates containing quaternary ammonium groups or other pharmaceutically acceptable polymers, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinyl alcohol; monomelic materials such as sugars including lactose, sucrose, fructose and mannitol; salts including sodium chloride, potassium chloride and derivatives; organic acids including furmaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid and tartaric acid and mixtures thereof; enteric polymers including hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, shellac,<br><br>
zein, and polymethacrylates containing carboxyl groups. These polymers may be applied as solutions or latexes. Other barriers may be used such as waxes.<br>
The coating composition may or may not be plasticized according to the properties of the coating blend such as the glass transition temperature of the main component or mixture of components or the solvent used for applying the coating compositions. Suitable plasticisers can be added from about 0% to about 50% by weight of the coating composition. Such plasticizers include, for example, the group consisting of diethyl phthalate, citrate esters, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, acetylated glycerides, and castor oil.<br>
Tablets or capsules containing eplerenone may be coated directly to produce a controlled release dose, or may comprise a plurality of coated cores containing eplerenone. As used herein, the term "core" refers to an element of the composition containing eplerenone and various carrier. Each core may contain an amount of eplerenone in the range of about 0.1% to 95%, preferably about 10% to 80%, by weight based on the total weight of the core. The core typically may be about 200 um to 1700 urn in diameter. A pellet is a coated core with the coating being any suitable coating.<br>
These controlled release compositions may be made by prilling, spray drying, pan coating, melt granulation, granulation, wurster coating, tangential coating, top spraying, tableting, extruding, coacervation and the like. The particle size of the controlled release components in the dosage form depends on the technology used. The particle sizes could range from submicron to 500 um for powder technologies (mixtures, spray drying, dispersions, and the like); 5 urn to 1700 urn for coating technologies (wurster, top spray, bottom spray, spray drying, extrusion, layering, and the like); and 1 mm to 20 mm for tableting technologies. The controlled release forms of eplerenone are then combined into a single dosage such that the amount of eplerenone in the composition of the invention provides the desired dosage. Standard coating procedures, such as those described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (1990), may conveniently be used.<br>
The compositions may include eplerenone in an immediate release form in association with eplerenone in a controlled release form. The immediate release form of such compositions may include an amount of eplerenone that is about 0.5% to about 90% of the total amount of eplerenone of the composition, with the controlled release form containing the remainder of the eplerenone. As a result, the final composition provides an amount of<br><br>
eplerenone for immediate release following administration and an additional amount of eplerenone for controlled release.<br>
The following non-limiting example illustrates the uses of the components listed above in producing a composition in accordance with the invention.<br>
Where the composition of the invention is in the form of a pellet product, the pellets may be presented in a sachet, capsule or tablet. The non-limiting example below describes pellets (particle sizes 200 urn to 1700 urn) in a capsule. All the quoted ranges are % w/w.<br>
A plurality of elements containing eplerenone, or cores, are prepared by extrusion/spheronization, or by layering eplerenone (or a blend of eplerenone with other carrier materials) onto inert carriers by various processes. The cores themselves could be immediate release or controlled release depending on the materials and method of manufacture. The cores may contain the drug at the required potency according to the particular eplerenone dose, required size, required presentation, and subsequent processes (coating and the like). The cores may contain drugs in the range of about 0.1% to about 100%, depending on the required dose, potency, manufacturing method, and other properties.<br>
An extruded core would typically include eplerenone and, for example, a diluent/disintegrant such microcrystalline cellulose (in the range about 0.5% to about 99.9%), a binding agent such as hydroxypropyl cellulose (in the range about 0.5% to about 50%); a filler such as lactose (in the range of about 0.5% to about 90%); and other carrier materials. An extruded core may, where desired, only contain drug and binding agent.<br>
An extruded core with controlled release properties would typically contain eplerenone and a swelling/gelling polymer such as hydroxypropyl cellulose (in the range about 0.5% to about 50%), or a hydrophobic material such as cetylalcohol (in the range of about 10% to about 90%). A layered core would contain eplerenone and an inert carrier such as a sugar sphere (in the range about 10% to about 90%) with a binding agent (in the range about 0.1% to about 50%). The core may or may not contain diluents, wetting agents and other additives. The binding agent may be chosen to achieve immediate release (such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and the like), controlled release (such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate butyrate and the like), or delayed/modified release (for example, enteric binding materials such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate and the like).<br><br>
A portion of the final dosage form may be immediate release cores made by the above described processes. Alternatively, the immediate release cores may be coated with a rapidly disintegrating or dissolving coat for aesthetic, handling, or stability purposes. Suitable materials include polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and polymethacrylates containing free amino groups. Such materials may be with or without plasticisers, antitack agents and/or diluents. An addition of about 3% of the weight ofthecoreas coating material is generally regarded as providing a continuous coat for this size range.<br>
The controlled release portion of the dose may be provided by a controlled release core as described above, a controlled release core which is further modified by overcoating, or an immediate release core which is modified by overcoating.<br>
A typical coating composition for making the controlled release component would contain an insoluble matrix polymer in an amount of about 15% to about 85% by weight of the coating composition, and a water soluble material in an amount of about 15% to about 85% by weight of the coating composition. Optionally, an enteric polymer in an amount from about 0.1% to about 100% by weight of the coating composition may be used or included. Suitable insoluble matrix polymers include ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetates, and polymethacrylates containing quaternary ammonium groups or other pharmaceutically acceptable polymers. Suitable water soluble materials include polymers such as polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol; monomelic materials such as sugars (e.g., lactose, sucrose, fructose, mannitol and the like); salts (e.g., sodium chloride, potassium chloride and the like); organic acids (e.g., fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid and the like); and mixtures thereof. Suitable enteric polymers include hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, shellac, zein, polymethacrylates containing carboxyl groups, and the like.<br>
The coating composition may or may not be plasticized according to the properties of the coating blend such as the glass transition temperature of the main component or mixture of components or the solvent used for applying the coating compositions. Suitable plasticisers can be added from about 0.1 % to about 50% by weight of the coating composition. Such plasticisers may be selected from, for example, the group consisting of<br><br>
diethyl phthalate, citrate esters, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, acetylated glycerides, acetylated citrate esters, dibutylsebacate, castor oil and the like.<br>
The coating composition may or may not include a filler. The filler may comprise about 0.1 % to about 100% by weight based on the total weight of the coating composition. The filler may be an insoluble material such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, talc, kaolin, alumina, starch, powdered cellulose, Microcrystalline cellulose, polacrilm potassium, and the like.<br>
The coating composition may be applied as a solution or latex in organic solvents or aqueous solvents of mixtures thereof Where solutions are applied, the solvent is present in an amount of about 25% to about 99%, preferably about 85% to about 97%, by weight based on the total weight of dissolved solids. Suitable solvents are water, lower alcohol, lower chlorinated hydrocarbons, ketones or mixtures thereof. Where latexes are applied, the solvent is present in an amount from about 25% to about 97%, preferably about 60% to about 97%, by weight based on the quantity of polymeric material in the latex. The solvent may be predominantly water.<br>
A suitable tablet formulation may include eplerenone together with a swelling/gelling polymer such as L-hydroxypropyl cellulose admixed with a filler such as Microcrystalline cellulose. The tablet carrier materials may or may not be processed (i.e., spray dried) together, prior to compression. Matrix tablets of this type often exhibit a rapid initial release until the polymers swell and gel, which induces controlled release for the remainder of the drug.<br>
The quantity of immediate release and duration of controlled release can be varied by altering the quantities of the carrier materials used. If the immediate release component is not large enough, a quantity of eplerenone can be included in a rapidly dissolving outer coat of polymers such as Polyethylene glycol or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. A typical matrix tablet would contain the swelling/gelling polymer in an amount from about 5% to about 70% by weight based on the total weight of the tablet, and a diluent in an amount from about 15% to about 90% by weight based on the total weight of the tablet. Additional diluents may be included in amounts from approximately 0.1% to about 65% by weight based on the total weight of the tablet. These may be soluble materials such as lactose, mannitol, sorbitol and the like, or insoluble materials such as tribasic calcium phosphate powdered cellulose or any of the various starches (corn, wheat, potato and the like). Additionally, the tablets may<br><br>
contain a lubricant in an amount from about 0.1 % to about 8% by weight based on the total weight of the tablet. Lubricants may be selected from metal stearates, stearic acid, hydrogenated oils, such as soya bean oil or castor oil, sodium stearyl fumate, polytetrafluoroethylene, talc and the like. The tablets may be coated for aesthetic, handling or stability purposes, or to increase the quantity of the immediate release portion of eplerenone. In this latter case, eplerenone is dissolved or suspended in die coating solution and sprayed onto the tablets until the desired quantity of eplerenone has been added. Suitable coating materials include polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sugar, waxes, or mixtures of these. The material may be added to any desired thickness but weight gains in the range about 1% to about 20% are typical, preferably about 2% to about 10%, and more preferably about 2% to about 5%. The coat may or may not be plasticized. A plasticiser may be present in an amount from about 0.1% to about 50% by weight based on the total weight of the table of the coating material. Examples of plasticisers are diethyl phthalate, citrate esters, acetylated citrate esters, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, dibutylsebacate, acetylated monoglycerides, castor oil and the like).<br>
The coating composition may include an antitack agent such as talc, kaolin, titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, alumina, starch, polacrilin potassium, microcrystalline cellulose or the like).<br>
The coating materials may be applied to the eplerenone particles, processed eplerenone particles (i.e. cores, granules), finished tablets, or finished capsules.<br>
The coating composition may or may not include a filler. The filler may comprise about 0.1% to about 100% by weight based on the total weight of the coating composition and may be an insoluble material such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, talc, kaolin, alumina, starch, powdered cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polacrillin potassium. The coating composition may contain other ingredients such as dyes and waxes.<br>
The coat may be applied as a solution or suspension from aqueous or organic solvents using solution concentrations and equipment familiar to these skilled in the art. The coating composition may be applied as a solution or latex in organic solvents or aqueous solvents or mixtures thereof. Where solutions are applied the solvent is present in an amount of about 25% to about 99%, preferably about 85% to about 97%, by weight based on the total weight of dissolved solids. Suitable solvents are water, lower alcohols, lower chlorinated<br><br>
I hydrocarbons, ketones, or mixtures thereof. Where latexes are applied, the solvent is present in an amount of about 25% to about 97%, preferably about 60% to about 97%, by weight based on the quantity of polymeric material in the latex. The solvent may be pi^ominantly water.<br>
Alternatively, the controlled release component of a tablet may be provided in the form of controlled release pellets and the immediate release component may be included in the body of the tablet. Such a tablet disintegrates to release the immediate release drug and the controlled release pellets. Pellets may be present in an amount from about 1% to about 60%, preferably about 5% to about 50%, and more preferably about 5% to about 40%, by weight of the tablet. Suitable matrix materials for tablets of this type are microcrystalline cellulose, starches and the like.<br>
The immediate release form of the eplerenone may be presented in a fast dissolving dosage form. The immediate release form may be in the form of a solid or molecular dispersion of the active within a polymer matrix. The polymer matrix may be selected from biologically acceptable polymers such as a cellulose ether, for example ethyl cellulose, or cellulose ester, for example cellulose acetate butyrate and the like. The immediate release form may simply be particles of deposited on a core containing eplerenone.<br>
The composition of the invention, where it is in a tablet or like form, may include the two forms of the eplerenone as separate components, for example, in a multi-layer tablet, wherein one or more layers include the eplerenone in a controlled release form. Alternatively the composition of the invention may be in the form of a tablet wherein the immediate release form is present in the shell and the controlled release form constitutes the core. Alternatively, the two forms of the eplerenone may be dispersed throughout the tablet.<br>
The composition of the invention may be produced by providing a core containing the eplerenone controlled release component coated with an enteric or delayed release coating. The core can be in the form of beads compressed to a tablet. The coated core may then be compressed into tablets along with a powder mixture containing additional eplerenone, or filled in combination with uncoated eplerenone into a capsule shell. As a result, the final composition provides an amount of eplerenone for immediate release following administration and an additional amount of eplerenone for controlled release.<br>
The controlled release form of the eplerenone is such as to provide sustained release of eplerenone. Preferably, the controlled or sustained release form provides a therapeutic<br><br>
effect over a period greater than about 12 hours, with a sustained therapeutic effect period of 12 to 24 hours being especially preferred.<br>
The controlled release form may be in the form of coated beads or granules of eplerenone. The coated eplerenone may be combined with uncoated or lightly coated eplerenone to provide a controlled release composition of the present invention. The term "lightly coated" as used in the description means a rapidly disintegrating coating for aesthetic, handing or stability purposes. These then may be filled into capsules or formed into tablets. Microencapsulation may also be used to produce the controlled release form of the eplerenone.<br>
The coating or matrix material may be any suitable material. The coating or matrix material may be a polymer or a wax. The wax may be selected from any suitable wax or wax-like material including natural oil and fat and hardened oils such as hardened rapeseed oil, hardened castor oil, hardened beef tallow, palm oils and the like; waxes such as camauba wax, bees wax, paraffin wax, ceresine wax, shellac wax or a fatty acid.<br>
Additional controlled release formulations can be prepared by appropriate modification of the formulations and methods disclosed in, for example, Jao et al., U.S. Patent 5,190,765; Jao et al., U.S. Patent 5,160,744; Wong et al., U.S. Patent 5,082,668; Ayer et al., U.S. Patent 4,847,093; EP 572942 A2 published December 8,1993; EP 284039 A2 published September 28,1988; EP 238189 Al published September 23,1987; W094/27582 published December 8,1994; W092/13547 published August 20,1992; and WO92/00729 published January 23,1992.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is a controlled release oral dosage form, preferably a tablet or capsule, wherein the release of eplerenone is controlled by the utilization of a hydrophilic matrix that releases eplerenone at a relatively constant rate over a period of several hours. This hydrophilic matrix can be prepared, for example, by incorporating hydroxypropyl methylcellulose into the formulation in combination with the other carrier materials. The amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose required will depend upon the release rate desired. Illustrative compositions having various in vitro dissolution rates are described in the examples below. In a typical formulation, the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is combined with eplerenone and other carrier materials, and then high shear wet granulated, fluid bed dried, blended and compressed into a tablet dosage<br><br>
form. Where hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is incorporated into the hydrophilic matrix to provide a controlled release dosage form, the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose used preferably is a high molecular weight (or high viscosity) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. The term "high molecular weight (or high viscosity) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose" refers to those hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses having a 2% viscosity (that is, the viscosity of a 2% solution of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in water at 20°C) in the range of about 3,500 cps to about 5,600 cps.<br>
When the tablet is exposed to aqueous media, such as in the gastrointestinal tract, the tablet surface wets and the polymer begins to partially hydrate forming an outer gel layer. This outer gel layer becomes folly hydrated and begins to erode into the aqueous fluids. Water continues to permeate toward the core of the tablet allowing another gel layer to form beneath the dissolving outer gel layer. These successive concentric gel layers sustain uniform release of eplerenone by diffusion from the gel layer and exposure through tablet erosion.<br>
In general, increasing the concentration of the polymer in the matrix increases the viscosity of the gel that forms on the tablet surface and causes a decrease in diffusion and release of eplerenone. Typical two hour controlled release formulations (that is, formulations that release about 50% of the eplerenone in vitro within about two hours of ingestion) comprise about 2% to about 20%, preferably about 3% to about 17%, and more preferably about 4% to about 14%, high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcelluolose by weight of the composition. Typical four hour controlled release formulations (that is» formulations that release about 50% of the eplerenone in vitro within about four hours of ingestion) comprise about 5% to about 45%, preferably about 7% to about 35%, and more preferably about 8% to about 28%, high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcelluolose by weight of the composition. Typical six hour controlled release formulations (that is, formulations that release about 50% of the eplerenone in vitro within about six hours of ingestion) comprise about 10% to about 45%, preferably about 12% to about 35%, and more preferably about 14% to about 35%, high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcelluolose by weight of the composition.<br>
Changes in the tablet size and shape can affect the surface to volume ratio of the tablet and therefore the drug release kinetics from the hydrophilic matrix of the tablet. In general, it was discovered that release of eplerenone from the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention was enhanced when tablet size decreased and/or tablet shape changed from<br><br>
round to caplet. It was also discovered that particle size of the polymer influences the rate at which eplerenone is released from the tablet. As the polymer particle size decreases, hydration of the polymer occurs more rapidly on the tablet surface resulting in slower drug release. Further, because tablet coating can alter eplerenone release kinetics, the effect of the coating on drug release should be considered for coated tablets. Testing of the controlled release tablets of the present invention indicated that release of eplerenone from the tablet is substantially independent of tablet compression force for compression forces between about 10kNtoabout40kN.<br>

Methods of Treatment<br>
The present invention also is directed to therapeutic methods of treating a condition or disorder where treatment with an aldosterone receptor blocker is indicated, the methods comprising the oral administration of one or more of the pharmaceutical compositions previously described above to a patient in need thereof.  The dosage regimen to prevent, give relief from, or ameliorate the condition or disorder preferably corresponds to once-a-day or twice-a-day oral dosages, and more preferably to the 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg eplerenone oral unit dosages discussed above, but may be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These include the type, age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the patient and the severity of the disease. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed may vary widely and therefore deviate from the preferred dosage regimen set forth above.<br>
Initial treatment of a patient suffering from a condition or disorder where treatment with an aldosterone receptor blocker is indicated can begin with the dosages indicated above. Treatment should generally be continued as necessary over a period^fseyeral weeks to several months or years until the condition or disorder has been controlled or eliminated. Patients undergoing treatment with the compounds or compositions disclosed herein can be routinely monitored by any of the methods well known in the art to determine the effectiveness of therapy. Continuous analysis of such data permits modification of the treatment regimen during therapy so that optimal effective amounts of compounds of the present invention are administered at any point in time, and so that the duration of treatment can be determined as well. In this way, the treatment regimen/dosing schedule can be rationally modified over the course of therapy so that the lowest amount of eplerenone exhibiting satisfactory effectiveness is administered, and so that administration is continued only so long as is necessary to successfully treat the condition or disorder.<br><br>
The present invention further encompasses the use of eplerenone and a cellulosic earner material in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of aldosterone mediated conditions or disorders.<br>
Method For Preparation Of Formulation<br>
The present invention also is directed to methods for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising eplerenone. Where tablets or capsules are desired, wet granulation, dry granulation or direct compression or encapsulation methods can be employed.<br>
Wet granulation is the preferred method of preparing tablets from the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. In the wet granulation process, the eplerenone (and, if desired, any of the other carrier materials) is initially milled or micronized to the desired particle size using a conventional mill or grinder. As previously discussed, reduction of the Dw eplerenone particle size (that is, the size of at least 90% of the eplerenone particles) to less than about 200 microns, preferably less than about 150 microns, and more preferably less than about 90 microns, can materially increase the bioavailability of the eplerenone.<br>
The milled or micronized eplerenone is then blended, for example in a high shear mixer granulator, planetary mixer, a twin-shell blender or sigma mixer, with one or more of the carrier materials. Typically, the drug is blended with the diluent(s), disintegrant(s), binding agent(s) and, optionally, wetting agent(s) in this step although it may be possible to add all or a portion of one or more of the carrier materials in a later step. For example, where microcrystalline cellulose is employed as a diluent, it has been discovered that addition of a portion of the microcrystalline cellulose during this blending step and the addition of the remaining portion after the drying step discussed below will increase the hardness and/or decrease the friability of the tablets produced. In this situation, preferably about 40% to about 50% of the microcrystalline cellulose is added intragranularly and about 50% to about 60% of the microcrystalline cellulose is added extragranularly.  In addition, this step of the process preferably comprises the blending of eplerenone, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and, optionally, sodium lauryl sulfate.    It has been discovered that blending times as short as three minutes can provide a dry powder mixture having a sufficiently uniform distribution of eplerenone.<br><br>
Water is then added to the dry powder mixture and the mixture is blended for an additional period of time. The water can be added to the mixture at once, gradually over a period of time, or in several portions over a period of time. The water preferably is added gradually over a period of time, preferably at least about three to about five. An additional period of mixing, generally at least about one to about three minutes, after the water addition is complete appears to ensure the uniform distribution of the water in the mixture and results in a suitable wet granulated mixture. An increase in mixing time typically has not been observed to affect tablet properties such as hardness. It is generally preferred that the wet granulated mixture comprise about 25% to about 45% water by weight. Although a higher or lower water content may be acceptable for certain formulations, a lower water content generally reduces the effectiveness of the step in producing granules having the desired compressibility and flowability properties while a higher water content generally generally causes an increase in granule size.<br>
The wet granulated mixture is then dried, for example, in an oven or a fluidized bed dryer, preferably a fluidized bed drier. If desired, the wet granulated mixture can be wet milled, extruded or spheronized prior to drying, although wet milling is preferred. For the drying process, conditions such as inlet air temperature and drying time are adjusted to achieve the desired moisture content for the dried mixture.  Increasing moisture content from about 2% to about 4% was observed to decrease tablet hardness.<br>
To the extent necessary, the dry granules are then reduced in size in preparation for compression. Conventional particle size reduction equipment such as oscillators or fitz mills can be employed.<br>
The dry granules are then placed in a suitable blender such as a twin-shell blender and the lubricant, anti-adherent agent and any additional carrier materials are added. Although blending times will depend in part upon the process equipment used, it has been discovered that blending times of at least about 5 to 25 minutes are generally preferred. In a preferred embodiment of this step of the invention, talc and the remaining portion of microcrystalline cellulose are added to the granules and the mixture blended for an additional period of time, preferably a period of time sufficient to achieve a blend uniformity relative standard deviation value of about 6% or less. Magnesium stearate is then added to the mixture and the mixture blended for an additional period of time. As noted above, where the diluents include microcrystalline cellulose, the addition of a portion of the microcrystalline cellulose during<br><br>
this step has been found to materially increase tablet hardness. In addition, increasing the amount of magnesium stearate was observed to decrease tablet hardness and increase friability and dissolution time.<br>
This blended mixture is then compressed into tablets (or encapsulated if capsules are to be prepared) to the desired weight and hardness using appropriate size tooling. Conventional compression and encapsulation techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be employed. Where coated tablets are desired, conventional coating techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be employed.<br>

Example 9: Oral Solution<br>
A series of oral solutions is prepared containing 2.5 mg/L of eplerenone and having the following composition: 20% ethanol v/v; 10% propylene glycol v/v; 30% to 70% glycerol v/v; and 30% to 70% water v/v.<br>
Another series of oral solutions is prepared containing 2.5 mg/L of eplerenone and further comprising ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin and 70% w/w sorbitol.<br>
Another oral solution is prepared in the following manner. A 15% hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin solution (20 mL) is added to a bottle containing eplerenone (100 mg). The bottle containing the mixture is placed in a temperature controlled water bath/shaker at 65°C<br><br>
and shaken for 20 minutes. The bottle is removed from the water bath and allowed to cool at room temperature for about five minutes. Apple juice (60 mL, commercially available) is added to the mixture in the bottle and the contents of the bottle gently swirled.<br>
The oral solutions of this example are particularly useful in the treatment of, for example, non-ambulatory patients, pediatric patients and patients that have difficulty taking solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. Example 10<br>
Tablets containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone and having the composition set forth in Table 10A were prepared by wet granulation (total batch size of 70 g). These 100 mg dose tablets had an average disintegration time of about 16 minutes and an average tablet hardness of about 16kpto 17 kp.<br><br>
The composition set forth in Table 10A was then modified by adjusting the Ac-Di-Sol weight fraction of the composition to values from 2% to 5% while maintaining the weight fraction ratio of lactose/A vicel at 25/37.5.   Tablets containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone and having these modified compositions were prepared by wet granulation (total batch size of 70 g). The mean disintegration results for these 100 mg dose tablets are reported in Table 10B below. An increase of the Ac-Di-Sol weight fraction to 5% resulted in a reduction in<br><br>
disintegration time to less than 10 minutes where no other change was made to the composition.<br><br>
The composition was then further modified as set forth in Table IOC to evaluate the effect on disintegration time of adding the disintegrant extragranularly (that is, the ingredient is added after the wet granulated mixture has been dried) as well as intragranularly (that is, the ingredient is present in the mixture during the wet granulation step).   The weight fraction ratio of lactose/Avicel for these compositions also was adjusted within the range of 43/17.5 to 45/17.5 to increase the compressibility of the compositions. Tablets containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone and having these modified compositions were prepared by wet granulation (total batch size of 70 g). The mean disintegration results for these 100 mg dose tablets are reported in Table    below. The addition of 5% Ac-Di-Solorthe addition of 1.5% Ac-Di-Sol intragranular/1.5% Ac-Di-Sol extragranular/10% Avicel improved disintegration time up to about seven to nine minutes. The Explotab brand of sodium starch glycolate used in the compositions is commercially available from Mendel.<br><br>
The batch sizes for the 2% Ac-Di-Sol intragranular/1% Ac-Di-Sol extragranular composition and the 5% Ac-Di-Sol intragranular composition discussed above were scaled up from 70 g to 2 kg. Tablets containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone and having these compositions were prepared by wet granulation. The experimental results for these 100 mg dose tablets are reported in Table 10D below. The terra "Granulation Time" as used in this example and throughout the other examples of this application means the total time for water addition and post-addition mixing.<br><br><br>
A decrease in tablet hardness was observed for the tablets prepared from the 2 kg batches relative to the tablets prepared from the 70 kg batch. In view of this decrease in tablet hardness, the 5% Ac-Di-Sol intragranular composition was modified by removing 10% intragranular Avicel and replacing it with 10% extragranular Avicel.  Tablets containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone and having the 5% Ac-Di-Sol intragranular composition or the 5% Ac-Di-Sol intragranular/7.5% intragranular Avicel/10% extragranular Avicel composition were prepared by wet granulation (total batch sizes of 2 kg). The experimental results for these 100 mg dose tablets are reported in Table 10E below. Removing 10% intragranular microcrystalline cellulose and replacing it with 10% extragranular microcrystalline cellulose resulted in (i) decreased density, (ii) increased tablet hardness, (iii) decreased disintegration time, and (iv) decreased water requirements for the wet granulation step.<br><br><br><br>
The experimental results for these 100 mg dose tablets are reported in Table 10G below. Scale-up of this formulation was achieved without a drop in tablet hardness while maintaining disintegration time at about seven minutes.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 14<br>
Tablets containing a 100 mg dose or a 200 mg dose of eplerenone and having one of the compositions set forth in Table 14A below were prepared by wet granulation (total batch size of 1 kg). In addition, tablets containing a 100 mg dose or a 200 mg dose of eplerenone and having formulation C set forth in Table 14A were prepared by wet granulation (total batch size of 2 kg).<br><br><br>
Tablets prepared from the 2 kg batch (Formulation C) exhibited a loss of tablet hardness and compressibility relative to tablets prepared from the 1 kg batch {Formulation C). Average tablet hardness for the 100 mg dose tablets prepared from the 2 kg batch was about 7 kp. Average tablet hardness for the 200 mg dose tablets prepared from the 1 kg batch was about 9 kp. In comparative tests, it was noted that placebo granulations with a high microcrystalline cellulose weight fraction (for example, about 5.5%) did not compress into tablets. With respect to the 2 kg batch, it also was observed that the granulation time of about 10 to 12 minutes resulted in an increased loss of water due to evaporation during granulation relative to the 1 kg batch.<br>
Tablets were then prepared containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone and having the composition of Formulation C above or the composition of Formulation C above wherein the lactose and Avicel weight fractions were reversed. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation (total batch size of 70 g) using different granulation times. Tablet compression<br><br>
was carried out on an F3 single punch press.  As shown in Table 14B below, the combination of longer granulation times and higher microcrystalline cellulose content resulted in a loss of hardness. Sensitivity to granulation conditions decreased when the lactose/microcrystallirie cellulose ratio was adjusted from 10/35.5 to 30.5/15.<br><br><br><br>
eplerenone were prepared by wet granulation in a scaled-up process (total batch sizes of 2 kg and 10 kg). The tablets had the same compositions as set forth in Table 14C above except that the 2 hour CR and 4 hour CR tablet compositions had high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Methocel K4M Premium) weight fractions of 6% and 12%, respectively, and microcrystalline cellulose weight fractions of 19.5% and 17.5%, respectively. Tables 14D, 14E and 14F report the experimental results. Dissolution profiles can be further adjusted by appropriate selection of high molecular weight hydroxypropyl methylcellulose concentrations. In addition, dissolution time decreases as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose particle size increases.  This is likely due to poor hydration of the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose matrix as particle size increases. Smaller particle size, on the other hand, appears to cause rapid hydration of the matrix and therefore slower drug release rate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Wet Granulation: The dry powder mixture was wet granulated using USP water. The main blade and chopper blade of the blender were placed on the fast speed setting. Five kilograms of water was added to the mixture over a period of about three minutes using a Masterflex water pump, model 7524-00(24" tubing). The rate of water addition was about 1.66 kg/minute. The wet mixture was blended for an additional minute to ensure the uniform distribution of the water in the granulation. The wet granulated mixture was about 38% water by weight.<br>
Drying: The wet granulation was placed in a Freund Flo-coater (FLF-15) fluid bed dryer. The inlet air temperature was adjusted to about 68°C and the granulation was dried in the fluid bed dryer to reduce the moisture content to between 0.5% to 2.5%. Moisture content was monitored using a Computrac Moisture Analyzer.<br>
Dry Screening: The dry granules were passed through a fitz mill with a 20# screen, knives forward, and 2400 rpm speed.<br>
Blending and Lubrication: The dry granules were then placed in a PK 2 cubic foot V-blender. The talc and extragranular Avicel 101 were placed on top of the granules and the mixture blended for about 10 minutes. The magnesium stearate was placed on top of the mixture and the mixture blended for an additional three minutes.<br>
Compression: The granules were then compressed on a Killian table press to the desired weight and hardness using appropriate size tooling. The target weight, size and hardness for 25, 50 and 100 mg tablets was as set forth in Table 22B below:<br><br><br>
Film Coating: Sterile water for irrigation was placed in a stainless steel container equipped with an electric mixer with a stainless steel impeller (Lightnin TSM 2500). The mixer was turned on at an appropriate speed. Opadry, white (YS-1-18027-A) was slowly added to the vortex while avoiding the formation of foam to provide a solution having an Opadry to water weight ratio of 15:85. Mixing continued for an additional 30 minutes or until all the material was dispersed and a homogeneous suspension observed. Constant slow stirring was maintained during the coating process. Coating of the tablets was carried out in the conventional manner using a Vector Hi Coater VHC-1355 with 35 L coating pan with two spray guns.<br><br><br>
Dry Mixing: A 60 L Baker Perkins blender was loaded with the lactose, eplerenone, Avicel, Methocel K4M, and Pharmacoat 603 in this order.   These materials were mixed for three minutes with the main blade on the slow main blade setting and the chopper blade on the slow chopper blade setting.<br>
Wet granulation: The dry powder mixture was wet granulated using USP water. The main blade and chopper blade of the blender were placed on the fast speed setting. About 3.1 kg of water was added to the mixture over a period of about three minutes using an Aeromatic water pump. The rate of water addition was about 995 g/minute. The wet mixture was blended for an additional minute to ensure the uniform distribution of the water in the granulation. The wet granulated mixture was about 31% water by weight.<br>
Drying: The wet granulation was placed in an Aeromatic fluid bed dryer. The inlet air temperature was set at about 60 °C and the granulation was dried in the fluid bed dryer to<br><br>
reduce the moisture content to between 1% to 3%. Moisture content of the granules was monitored using a Computrac Moisture Analyzer.<br>
Dry Screening: The dry granules were passed through a fitz mill (D6A) with 20# screen, knives forward and medium speed (1500-2500 rpm). The milled granules were collected in a polyethylene bag.<br>
Lubrication: The dry granules were placed in a PK 2 cubic foot V-blender. The talc was placed on top of the granulation and blended for 5 minutes. The magnesium stearate was then placed on top of the granulation and blended for 3 minutes. The granulation was discharged from the blender into a fiber drum lined with double polyethylene bags.<br>
Compression: The granulation was compressed on a Korsch tablet press to the desired weight and hardness using 12/32" round std concave tooling. Target weight was 333.3 mg and target hardness was 11 -13 Kp for 100 mg tablets.<br>
Film Coating: USP water was added to a stainless steel container and stirred by an electric mixer with a stainless steel impeller at slow speed. Opadry (white: ys-l-18027-A) was slowly added to the vortex. The stirring speed was incrreased as necessary to disperse the opadry in the water 10% opadry/90% water w/w) while avoiding the formation of foam. Mixing continued for 30 min or until all the material was dispersed and a homogeneous suspension was observed. The suspension was kept under constant slow stirring during coating.<br>
Coating: A Compulab Coater with 36" coating pan and one spray gun was used. The atomization air was set at 45 psi. The tablets were weighed and the amount of the coating suspension required to be sprayed in order to give 3% weight gain for tablets was determined. The tablets were loaded in the pan and the air flow set to 700 cubic feet per minute. The tablets were allowed to warm up for approximately 10 minutes by jogging the pan every two minutes. The inlet air temperature was set at 65°C. The exhaust temperature obtained was about 45°C. Rotation of the pan at 10 rpm was initiated and spraying starting. The spray rate was set at 50 g/min. The process was monitoring by checking and recording the coating parameters at each time interval. The coating process continued until the required quantity of<br><br>
coating suspension was sprayed, at which time spraying was discontinued. Pan rotation continued for an additional two to five minutes. The air heater was turned off and the pan rotation stopped. The tablets were allowed to cool for 10 minutes and the pan was jogged every two minutes during cooling. The coated tablets were discharged from the coating pan into fiber drums lined with double polyethylene bags.<br>
Example 24: Single Dose Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study<br>
The pharmacokinetics, safety and antialdosterone activity of single 10, 50,100, 300 and 1000 mg oral doses of eplerenone were evaluated in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.   It was determined that in plasma eplerenone exists in equilibrium with the inactive open lactone ring form of eplerenone. The pharmacokinetics of this inactive open lactone ring form of eplerenone was also evaluated. The study employed seven parallel dose groups of eight healthy male humans. Each subject received a single dose of one of the following: (i) a 10 mg dose of eplerenone (one 10 mg dose capsule), (ii) a50mg dose of eplerenone (two 25 mg dose capsules), (iii) a 100 mg dose of eplerenone (one 100 mg dose capsule), (iv) a 300 mg dose of eplerenone (three 100 mg dose capsules), (v) a 1000 mg dose of eplerenone (five 200 mg dose capsules), (vi) a 50 mg dose of spironolactone, or (vii) a placebo.  The pharmacokinetic profiles were evaluated using the measured blood and urine levels of eplerenone, the open lactone ring form of eplerenone and spironolactone. Antialdosterone activity was determined based on urine levels of sodium and potassium following repeated administration of fludrocortisone. Safety was determined on the basis of laboratory tests, vital signs, and the occurrence and types of adverse events.<br>
The eplerenone capsules administered corresponded to the capsules (or combinations of the capsules) disclosed in Examples 4, 5, 7 and S above. The placebo was a conventional capsule containing lactose.   The spironolactone used in the study was obtained from Searle Canada (Oakville, Ontario). The fludrocortisone used in the study consisted of commercially available fludrocortisone tablets (Florinef®, Squibb BY).<br>
The subjects, who underwent a ten hour food fast prior to administration of the dose, received a single oral dose of one of the study medications together with about 180 mL of water at 0800 hours. All subjects received a 1.0 mg dose of fludrocortisone nine hours before administration of the study medication; a 0.5 mg dose of fludrocortisone at the time of administration of the study medication; a 0.1 mg dose of fludrocortisone at 2,4, 6, 8,10,12 and 14 hours after administration of the study medication; and a 0.5 mg dose of<br><br>
fludrocortisone 16 hours after administration of the study medication. Each dose of fludrocortisone was administered with 150 mL of water except for the 1.0 mg dose which was administered with 200 mL of water.<br>
A 12-lead ECG was obtained prior to dosing (within one hour) and at 2, 3, 4 and 24 hours after administration of the study medication. Body temperature (oral), respiratory rate, and pulse rate and blood pressure (after sitting for three minutes) were obtained obtained prior to dosing (within one hour) and at 0.25,0.5,1,2,4, 8,12, and 24 hours after administration of the study medication.   Blood samples were collected at -0.25 (predose), 0.5,1, 2, 3,4, 6, 8, 12,16, 24,28, 32, 48, 72 and 96 hours post dose. Urine samples were collected for the following periods: -9 to 0; 0 to 2; 2 to 4; 4 to 6; 6 to 8; 8 to 10; 10 to 12; 12 to 14; 14 to 16; and 16 to 24 hours.<br>
The plasma samples collected from subjects dosed with eplerenone were assayed for concentrations of eplerenone and the open lactone ring form of eplerenone. The plasma samples of the subjects dosed with spironolactone were assayed for concentration of spironolactone and its active metabolites canrenone, 7cc-thiomethylspirolactone, and 6(1-hydroxy-7a-thiomethylspirolactone. A subset of plasma samples was also assayed for testosterone levels. The urine collected was analyzed to determine concentrations and amounts of eplerenone and the open lactone ring form of eplerenone, the amount of sodium and potassium excreted, and the urinary log10 (sodium/potassium) ratio. The mean results obtained from the subjects tested are reported in Tables 24A through 24J below. There were no clinically significant changes in physical examinations, vital signs or clinical laboratory results. All adverse events were mild in severity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
eplerenone reconstituted in 80 mL of an apple juice/hydroxypropyl- P-cyclodextrin mixture. The subjects swallowed about 200 mL of water one, two and three hours postdose. A 12-lead ECG was obtained prior to dosing (within one hour) and at 2, 3, 4 and 24 hours after administration of the study medication. Body temperature (oral), respiratory rate, and pulse rate and blood pressure (after sitting three minutes) were obtained obtained prior to dosing (within one-half hour) and at 0.5,1,4, and 24 hours after administration of the study medication.  Blood samples were collected at -0.5 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36,48, 72 and 96 hours post dose. Urine samples were collected for the following periods: -12 to 0; 0 to 2; 2 to 4; 4 to 8; 8 to 12; 12 to 24; 24 to 48; 72 to 96; 96 to 120; 120 to 144; and 144 to 168 hours. Individual fecal samples were collected beginning immediately after dosing and continuing through 0800 hours on day 8. In addition, one predose fecal sample was provided. Saliva samples were taken at 0.5 hour predose and at 0.5,1,2,4,6,12, and 24 hours postdose. Breath samples were taken at 0.5 hour predose and at 1,2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,24, 36,48 and 72 hours postdose.<br>
The data show that elimination of eplerenone is by metabolism and not excretion of unchanged eplerenone. The mean percentages of the dose excreted as total radioactivity in urine and feces were 66.6% and 32.0%, respectively. The majority of urinary and fecal radioactivity was due to metabolites and less than 15% was due to eplerenone. The mean percentages of the dose excreted in urine as eplerenone and its open lactone ring form were 1.65% and 4.98%, respectively.   The mean percentages of the dose excreted in feces as eplerenone and its open lactone ring form were 0.807% and 2.46%, respectively. There were no clinically significant changes in physical examinations, vital signs or clinical laboratory test results. There were no serious adverse effects.<br>
There were no detectable concentrations of total radioactivity in the breath collected at any of the time points from any of the subjects. The mean percentage of total radioactivity bound to plasma proteins in the 1.5 hour plasma samples was 49.4%. The mean concentration of total radioactivity in these samples was 2.39 jig/mL. When [14C]eplerenone was spiked into the control plasma, which had been frozen, the percentage of eplerenone bound was 40.4% at a concentration of 14.5 ^ig/mL.<br>
The mean results of selected tests are reported in Tables 25A, 25B, 25C and 25D below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 26: Bioavailability Study<br>
The bioavailability and safety of five different formulations (each containing a 100 mg dose of eplerenone ) were evaluated in an open-label, randomized, single dose, five-way crossover study of a group of healthy adult humans. The subjects received five single doses of 100 mg of eplerenone administered as (i) one eplerenone 100 mg immediate release capsule, (ii) one eperenone 100 mg immediate release tablet, (iii) one eplerenone 100 mg controlled release tablet with a 50% in vitro dissolution time of two hours, (iv) one eplerenone 100 mg controlled release tablet with a 50% in vitro dissolution time of four hours, and (iv) one eplerenone 100 mg controlled release tablet with a 50% in vitro dissolution time of six hours.  A total of 13 subjects began the study with nine subjects completing all five treatments. Treatments were separated by seven days.   The specific pharmaceutical compositions of each formulation are reported in Table 26A.<br><br><br><br>
days 1, 8,15, 22 and 29 in one of five randomized treatment sequences (ABDCE, BCAED, CDEAB, DECBA, and EABDC). The medication was admininstered together with about 180 mL of water at 0800 hours.   Blood samples were collected at-0.5 (predose), 0.5,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,10,12,16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post dose. Urine samples were collected and pooled between the hours of 0-24 and 24-48 hours postdose. Analyses of the separated plasma and urine for eplerenone and its inactive open lactone ring form were performed at Phoenix International Life Sciences, Quebec, Canada. Plasma and urinary concentrations of eplerenone and its inactive open lactone ring form were determined using a validated high performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC") procedure for the inactive open lactone ring form. The lower limits of detection in urine were approximately 50 ng/mL for both eplerenone and the inactive form. The mean results obtained are reported in Tables 26B, 26C, 26D and 26E below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 27: Effect of Food Study<br>
An open-label randomized, cross-over study was employed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of eplerenone under fasted and fed conditions, and the safety and tolerability of eplerenone. Safety was assessed based on adverse events, vital signs and clinical laboratory tests. Twelve healthy male subjects were randomized to receive a single 100 mg doses of eplerenone on days 1 and 8 under (i) fasted conditions, or (ii) immediately following a high-fat breakfast. The subjects were orally adniiriistered a single 100 mg dose of eplerenone in the form of the capsule described in Example 7, together with approximately 200 to 240 mL of water at 0800 hours on days 1 and 8. Subjects randomized to receive a high-fat breakfast were to completely ingest the meal within 20 minutes prior to dosing. The high-fat meal contained approximately 33 g protein, 75 g fat, 58 g carbohydrates and 1000 calories.   Blood samples were collected at -0.5 (predose), 0.5,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,12,16, 24,28, 32,48 and 72 hours post dose and analyzed to determine the concentration of eplerenone and its open lactone ring form. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or physical examinations. All adverse events were mild in severity. The mean results are reported in Tables 27A and 27B below.<br><br><br><br><br>
For both eplerenone and its open ring lactone form, the high-fat meal led to a reduction in C^ and an increase in T^,, but had minimal or no measurable effect upon AUCo_M and lm. The results indicate that the high fat meal had minimal effect on the extent of eplerenone absorption, but it did decrease the rate of absorption. Accordingly, dosing of eplerenone may be made without regard for meal time, as the effect of food appears to have minimal clinical significance.<br>
Example 28: Multiple Dose Study<br>
Multiple oral dose tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of several dosages of eplerenone were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, rising oral dose, sequential panel study of 40 healthy male subjects (five groups of eight subjects). The study medication was administered in three sequential dose panels, with each panel including eplerenone, spironolactone and placebo. A single dose of 100 mg (one 100 mg dose), 300 mg (three 100 mg dose capsules) or 1000 mg dose eplerenone (five 200 mg dose capsules), 1000 mg dose of spironolactone, or placebo was administered on Day 1. The 100 mg and 200 mg dose capsule corresponded to those described in Examples 7 and 8, respectively. Following a 48-hour interval, the study drug was administered once a day for 11 days. Antialdosterone activity was determined following a fludrocortisone challenge on Days 12-13. Plasma pharmacokinetic results are reported in Table 28 below:<br><br><br>
Eplerenone plasma concentrations were detectable at 24 hours postdose for all dosing groups. Plasma concentrations of eplerenone and mean dose-adjusted AUC values following either single or multiple doses indicate a lack of dose proportionality within the 100 mg to 1000 mg dosage range.    Results for the open ring lactone form were consistent with dose<br><br>
proportionality following single or multiple doses. Overall, there was no significant or dose-related accumulation of either eplerenone or its open ring lactone form.<br>
Excretion of total eplerenone (that is, eplerenone and its open ring lactone form) in the urine represented approximately 5% of the dose for all doses administered. Urinary excretion of total eplerenone occurred almost entirely within the first 24 hours after dosing. Eplerenone significantly increased the urinary log]0 (sodium/potassium) at doses of 100 mg to 1000 mg following single dose administration. There was, however, no sustained increase in urinary log]0 (sodium/potassium) values following multiple dose administration of either eplerenone or spironolactone. Serum sodium and potassium concentrations were not significantly changed following single doses of eplerenone, but transient reductions in sodium concentrations and increases in potassium concentrations were noted following multiple dose administration. Eplerenone produced dose-related increases in mean plasma renin (active and total) levels and serum aldosterone levels, but did not show any consistent, sustained or dose-related effects on most serum sex hormone and thyroid profiles.<br>
Example 29: Treatment of Hypertension Study<br>
The safety and efficacy of a range of doses of eplerenone in the treatment of hypertension relative to placebo were evaluated in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-lead-in, parallel group study. Spironolactone 50 mg BID was included as the active reference drug. Four hundred and seventeen patients were randomized to one of eight treatments: (i) placebo BID; (ii) eplerenone 50 mg QD; (iii) eplerenone 100 mg QD; (iv) eplerenone 400 mg QD; (v) eplerenone 25 mg BID; (vi) eplerenone 50 mg BID; (vii) eplerenone 200 mg BID; and (viii) spironolactone 50 mg BID.   The primary efficacy variable was the change in cuff diastolic blood pressure (sitting) measured at trough plasma levels after eight weeks of double blind treatment. The secondary variables measured were the change in trough cuff systolic blood pressure (sitting), change in 24 hour mean diastolic blood pressure, and change in 24 hour mean systolic blood pressure. The primary and secondary efficacy variables were analyzed to compare BID versus QD dosing regimens for each eplerenone dose group, and both eplerenone and spironolactone versus placebo. Changes in plasma renin and serum aldosterone after eight weeks of dosing were also analyzed as secondary measures of efficacy.<br>
All eplerenone doses lowered cuff diastolic and systolic pressures from baseline after eight weeks of treatment compared to placebo. Greater reductions in diastolic and systolic<br><br>
blood pressure were observed with increasing doses of eplerenone. In general, equivalent reductions in blood pressure values were associated with the QD and BID dosing regimens. There was, however, a trend toward greater reduction with the BID dosing regimen. Similar changes were observed in the 24 hour trough ambulatory blood pressures. Over the course of the study, the mean change in heart rate from baseline was minimal in all treatment groups, with the largest mean increase and decrease in heart rate being +2 beats/minute and -1.8 beats/minute, respectively. Consistent with aldosterone receptor antagonism, there were increases in aldosterone in both the eplerenone and spironolactone treatment groups compared to placebo as well as increases in both total and active renin levels. Safety was assessed by comparing the incidence of adverse events, withdrawals, and the results of urinalysis, hematology and biochemistry laboratory tests across the treatment group to the placebo group.<br>
There were small but consistent increases in potassium and decreases in sodium in all of the eplerenone treatment groups. There were increases in BUN, uric acid levels and decreases in urine pH compared to placebo in the eplerenone treatment groups. Each eplerenone dosing regimen was well tolerated by the subjects. No adverse side effects were observed at 1000 mg, the highest dose administered.<br>
The specific pharmaceutical compositions of each eplerenone capsule are reported in Examples 5, 6, 7 and 8. The placebo was a conventional capsule containing lactose.   The spironolactone used in the study was obtained from Searle Canada (Oakville, Ontario).<br>
The mean results obtained from the subjects tested are reported in Tables 29A and 29B below.<br><br><br>
An average decrease in diastolic blood pressure of about 5% or greater was observed over an interval of about 12 to 24 hours after administration of the study medication.<br><br><br>
Example 30: Effect of Eplerenone Particle Size<br>
The effect of the particle size of the eplerenone starting material used in the pharmaceutical composition on eplerenone plasma concentrations and relative bioavailability was studied in a dog model. Four heathy female beagle dogs weighing between 8 to 12 kg were intragastrically aa^nininistered one immediate release capsule containing the formulation described in Table 30A below followed by about 10 mL of water.<br><br><br>
The dogs were fasted for 15 to 20 hours prior to administration of the capsule and were not fed again until at least 4 hours after dose administration. Blood samples (approximately 3 mL) were collected by venipuncture in chilled tubes containing heparin at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after dose administration. The blood samples were immediately placed on ice. Separation of plasma from the blood samples was complete after about 15 minutes of centrifugation. The resulting plasma samples were frozen at about -20°C and stored until analyzed. Analysis was performed using an LC/MS/MS procedure.<br>
This experiment was conducted using the same four dogs for three formulations that were identical except for the particle size of the eplerenone starting material. The three formulations tested used eplerenone starting materials having a Dw particle size (that is, at least 90% of the particles were) less than about 212 microns, less than about 86 microns, and less than about 36 microns, respectively.    A minimum of a five day wash-out period was allowed between administration of each of the formulations. Reducing the Dw particle size of the eplerenone starting material from about 212 microns to above 86 microns increased relative bioavailability by almost 100%. The mean results are reported in Tables 30B and 30C below.<br><br><br>
