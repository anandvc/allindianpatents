FABRIC TREATMENT COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to a process to form a fabric<br>
treatment product which exhibits improved stability.  In particular, the invention relates to the production of a fabric treatment product that contains a substantially non-10  aqueous, comprising less than 20% by weight of water liquid composition, especially a unit dose product.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
15  Product formats for fabric cleaning compositions have<br>
traditionally included liquids (viscous or thin), solids, such as powders, granules, small capsules or tablets. Recently, so called unit dose products are experiencing increasing success with consumers, because they eliminate<br>
20  the need for manipulating, and possibly spilling, liquids or powders and simplify the use of a correct dose of the cleaning product for the required purpose.  An example of this product format is the liquid unit dose capsule.<br>
25  Liquid unit dose capsules offer the consumer a convenient way to use pre-measured detergent for laundering purposes, for example, by way of a water soluble package containing a so-called non-aqueous liquid detergent composition, the water soluble package dissolving in the wash to release the<br>
30  detergent composition inside.  Such products provide a controllable measured dosing format.  It prevents over¬dosage and as such has environmental benefits.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/107215<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2007/001296<br>
 <br>

Consumers are also interested in having multi-purpose products, for example, detergent compositions that not only clean fabrics but that also have an additional benefit.  An example of this is a detergent composition which also 5  conditions the fabrics.<br>
Prior Art<br>
A number of technologies that offer such a benefit are<br>
10      'known,   such as  the use of clays, silicones or cationic polymers.  WO-A-2004/056958 (P&amp;G) discloses a cationic silicone or a cationic modified guar gum in a low aqueous composition to provide cleaning and softening.  A disadvantage of these compositions is that guar gum<br>
15  derivatives are difficult to incorporate into non-aqueous<br>
formulations that are rich in surfactants.  When non-aqueous product formats are formulated with high levels of cationic polymers, the products prove unstable and separate on standing.  This is undesirable in view of the difficulties<br>
20  involved in the process of filling sachets with an unstable composition, and also because the phase separation inside the sachet after preparation will lead to a product that is unsightly to the consumer.  Separation of the phases of the unit dose product leads to uneven dosing in the wash and<br>
25  hence; an inefficient product which is undesirable to the consumer.<br>
WO-A-2004/056958 also discloses the processes used to make such non-aqueous compositions, whereby a fabric cleaning 30  system is prepared first by combining all fabric cleaning ingredients, with a fabric softening composition prepared<br>
 <br>

separately and thereinafter combined with the fabric cleaning system to form the final product.<br>
A similar process for formulation is outlined in a brochure 5  on a series of conditioning cationic polymers marketed by Amerchol, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company.  This brochure discloses formulating with cationic polymers and advises formation of a pre-mix solution of cationic polymer in water followed by addition of this pre-mix to the 10  surfactant -<br>
Our co-pending application WO-A-2004/069979 discloses laundry compositions containing cationic charged polymers that besides cleaning also give softening during the wash. 15  Preferred polymers are those which arise from natural sources, such as cellulose.<br>
The two-part processes disclosed by the prior art are suitable for stable aqueous liquid detergent formulations. 20<br>
There still remains a need for stable non-aqueous unit dose compositions offering fabric cleaning in addition to other fabric benefits such as fabric conditioning, and processes for making them.  There further remains a need for the<br>
2	5  production of non-aqueous unit dose compositions that are<br>
not highly viscous, so that the final formulated products are filled more easily.<br>
  Accordingly an object of the invention is to provide a<br>
3	0  process for the production of a unit dose, fabric treatment<br>
product comprising a non-aqueous liquid fabric treatment<br>

composition wherein the fabric treatment composition shows favourable characteristics, including improved stability, while offering the consumer one or more fabric treatment benefits in addition to fabric cleaning. 5<br>
We have now found that this can be' achieved by way of the process leading to the product of the present invention.  In particular, it has been found that stable, low viscosity liquid formulations having improved stability and suitable 10  for use in a unit dose product format can be produced by a process comprising certain sequential steps, pertaining to the order of addition of the ingredients of the formulation.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed towards a process for the preparation of a non-aqueous liquid fabric treatment 5  composition comprising no more than 20% by weight of water, characterised in that the process comprises:-<br>
a)	provision of a pre-mix comprising cationic cellulosic<br>
polymer, water and optional" solvent;<br>
10  b)  admixture of the pre-mix with at least one anionic surfactant; and c)  subsequent addition of non-ionic surfactant;<br>
wherein the steps a) to c) are performed sequentially.<br>
15<br>
By'the term sequentially, we mean the process steps a) to c) are performed in the order a), b), and then c).  This does not exclude additional process steps from being incorporated in between the aforementioned process steps.  According to<br>
2 0  the invention, it is also possible to incorporate other process steps, or additional ingredients, for example incorporation of additional solvent in between steps a) and<br>
b)	or b) and c), as long as the steps a) to c) are performed<br>
in that required order.<br>
25<br>
The non-aqueous liquid<br>
By "non-aqueous", or "so-called non-aqueous", it is meant that the amount of water present in the liquid composition 30  is below the level at which the package would dissolve through contact with its contents.  The liquid fabric<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/107215<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2007/001296<br>
 <br>

treatment composition comprises no more than 2 0%, preferably no more that 15%, still more preferably no more than 10%, by weight of total product of water.<br>
5  The viscosity of the liquid composition is suitably at least 25 mPaS but no more than 10,000 mPaS. . Viscosity is measured on a Bohlin rheometer with cone-plate 4°/40 geometry at 25°C at a shear rate of 21 s-1.<br>
10  The Cationic Cellulosic Polymer<br>
The term "cationic cellulosic polymer" refers to polymers having a cellulosic backbone and an overall positive charge. Cellulose is a polysaccharide with glucose as its monomer, 15  specifically it is a straight chain polymer of D-<br>
glucopyranose units linked via β -1,4 glycosidic bonds and is a linear, non-branched polymer.  The cationic cellulosic polymers present in the compositions of the invention have a modified cellulosic backbone, modified in  that additional<br>
2	0  chemical groups have been reacted with some of the free<br>
hydroxyl groups of the cellulosic backbone to give an overall positive charge to the modified cellulosic monomer unit.<br>
25  A preferred class of cationic cellulosic polymers suitable<br>
for this invention are those that have a cellulosic backbone modified to incorporate a quaternary ammonium salt. Preferably the quaternary ammonium salt is linked to the cellulosic backbone by a hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl<br>
3	0  group.  Preferably the charged nitrogen of the quaternary<br>
ammonium salt has one or more alkyl group substituents.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/107215<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2007/001296<br>
 <br>
Typical examples of preferred cationic cellulosic polymers include cocodimethylammonium hydroxypropyl oxyethyl cellulose, lauryldimethylammonium hydroxypropyl oxyethyl cellulose, stearyldimethylammonium hydroxypropyl oxyethyl cellulose, and stearyldimethylammonium hydroxyethyl cellulose; cellulose 2-hydroxyethyl 2-hydroxy 3-(trimethyl ammonio) propyl ether salt, polyquaternium-4, polyquaternium-10, polyquaternium-24 and polyquaternium-67 or mixtures thereof.<br>
10<br>
More preferably the cationic cellulosic polymer is .... polyquaternium-10.  Suitable commercial cationic cellulosic polymer products for use according to the present invention are marketed by the Amerchol Corporation, a subsidiary of 15  The Dow Chemical Company, under the trade name UCARE Polymer LR-400.<br>
The term cationic cellulosic polymer can include a single polymer or a mixture of different polymers.<br>
20 . .<br>
Any suitable counterion may be- used with the cationic cellulosic polymer.  Preferred counterions for the cationic cellulosic polymer include: the halides {chloride, bromide, and jiodide) , hydroxide, phosphate, sulphate, hydrosulphate,<br>
25  ethyl sulphate, methyl sulphate, formate, and acetate.<br>
Many of the aforementioned cationic polymers can be synthesised in, and are commercially available in, a number of different molecular weights.  In order to achieve optimal 30  cleaning and softening performance from the product, it is desirable that the cationic cellulosic polymer used in this<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/107215<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2007/001296<br>
 <br>
-   9   -<br>
invention be of an appropriate molecular weight.  Without wishing to be bound by  theory, it is believed that polymers that are too high in mass can entrap soils and prevent them from being removed.  The use of cationic polymers with an 5  average molecular weight of less than about 850,000 Daltons, and especially those with an average molecular weight of less than 500,000 Daltons can help to minimise this effect without significantly reducing the softening performance of properly formulated products.  On the other hand, polymers 10  with a molecular weight of about 10,000 Daltons or less are believed to be too small to give an effective softening benefit.<br>
Provision of the cationic cellulosic polymer pre-mix<br>
15<br>
According to the invention, the pre-mix is provided which comprises cationic cellulosic polymer, water and optional solvent.  Preferably the pre-mix comprises cationic<br>
    cellulosic polymer, water and one or more additional<br>
20  solvents.  The cationic cellulosic polymer should be present in the resulting pre-mix in a dissolved state.  By a dissolved state is herein defined as the chosen polymer being soluble to the extent of at least 90% by weight of the polymer in the chosen water or water/solvent mix at 25°C.<br>
2 5  The solvent for dissolution of the cationic cellulosic<br>
polymer can be water alone, or water in combination with one or more other solvents as long as the combination will dissolve the polymer and that the water level of the final formulated detergent composition is low enough to not<br>
30  interfere with the integrity of the water soluble packaging. Additional water or other solvent(s) can be added at any<br>
 <br>

time during, the process, as long as the total amount of water is in accord with the term "non-aqueous" as defined herein.  The total amount of solvent in the liquid fabric detergent can be added as one portion to form the pre-mix, 5  or split up into numerous portions to be added during the process.  For the provision of the polymer pre-mix the cationic cellulosic polymer can be added as a solid.  An example of this is addition of polymer in powder form or granule form.  Alternatively to facilitate dosing of the 10  polymer in a large-scale process, the polymer can be added as a dispersion in a non-solvent (in which the polymer is not soluble).  This can be thought of as an addition of a slurry of the cationic cellulosic polymer.<br>
15  Solvent<br>
In addition to water, the non-aqueous liquid fabric treatment compositions of the invention comprise one or more additional solvents.  As stated earlier, the cationic<br>
20  cellulosic polymer pre-mix comprises the polymer, water and optional solvent.  Preferably the pre-mix comprises polymer, water and solvent as this facilitates having a higher amount of the polymer present in the pre-mix.  Depending on the level of polymer required in the composition, it is possible<br>
25' " to dissolve an amount of cationic cellulosic polymer in<br>
water alone, with or without the aid of heating, and then further on in the process to add suitable solvent to bring the total amount of water in the composition down to a level which can be classed as non-aqueous as hereinbefore<br>
3 0  mentioned.  Such suitable solvents are miscible with water. Suitable solvents include alcohols, ethers, polyethers,<br>

polyols, alkylamines, alkanol amines and fatty amines, alkyl (or fatty) amides and mono-and di- N-alkyl substituted derivatives thereof, alkyl (or fatty) carboxylic acid lower alkyl esters, ketones, aldehydes, glycerides, and non-ionic 5  surfactants such as alkoxylated alcohols or mixtures<br>
thereof.  Preferred solvents are selected from the group consisting of pentanediols, butanediols, propanediols, such as 1,3-propane diol, alkanol amines, di-alkyl ethers, polyethylene glycols, alkyl ketones (such as acetone) and<br>
10  glyceryl trialkylcarboxylates (such as glyceryl tri¬acetate) , glycerol, and sorbitol or mixtures thereof.  Even more preferred solvents are butanediols, propanediols or a mixture thereof.  The most preferred solvent for use in the composition of the present invention is monopropylene glycol<br>
15   (MPG) .<br>
Preferably, the solvent is present in the liquid composition in an amount of at least 10% by weight, more preferably from 15% to 50% by weight. 20<br>
Water activity of pre-mix<br>
The term 'water activity' describes the equilibrium amount of water available for hydration of materials at a certain 25  temperature.  Numerous devices can measure this parameter directly, while some devices measure a parameter called equilibrium relative humidity (%ERH).  The water activity (usually given the parameter Aw) is related to equilibrium relative humidity (%ERH) by the equation<br>
30<br>
%ERH - 100 x Aw<br>

WO 2007/107215<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2007/001296<br>
 <br>
-   12   -<br>
A value for water activity of 1 indicates pure water, whereas zero indicates total absence of water.<br>
The water activity of a pre-mix comprising cationic 5  cellulosic polymer and water will be different from that of a pre-mix comprising polymer, water and solvent-  When a pre-mix is provided comprising polymer, water and solvent, then preferably the water activity of the pre-mix is from 0.2 to 0.7, more preferably from 0.3 to 0.7. 10<br>
Water activity values pertaining to the invention and<br>
mentioned herein -are measured at a temperature of 20°C unless otherwise stated, and are easily measured by numerous water activity measuring devices, an example of which is the 15  HygroPalm AW obtainable from Rototronic AG of Switzerland.<br>
Optional heating of pre-mix<br>
The process of the invention requires that a pre-mix is 20  provided comprising cationic cellulosic polymer, water and optional solvent.  The cationic cellulosic polymer is present in the pre-mix in a dissolved state as hereinbefore defined.  To facilitate formation of the pre-mix comprising the cationic cellulosic polymer in a dissolved state, the 25  components of the pre-mix can  be added together and the resulting mixture heated to a temperature of up to 70°C. Preferably the temperature is from 25°C to 60°C,   more preferably the temperature is from 35°C  to 55°C.<br>

 <br>
PCT/EP2007/001296<br>
 <br>
--    13   -<br>
Alternatively, the water, solvent or water and solvent mixture can be heated before addition of the cationic cellulosic polymer to facilitate incorporation of the polymer in a final dissolved form up to the temperature 5  ranges recited above.  The resulting temperature of the<br>
provided pre-mix is up to 70°C." Surfactants<br>
10  These may be in liquid form or as solid dissolved or dispersed in the substantially non-aqueous liquid composition.<br>
Anionic Surfactant<br>
15<br>
The anionic surfactant of step b) of the aforementioned process of the invention is added to the pre-mix comprising cationic cellulosic polymer, water and optionally solvent of step a) of the process.  If the pre-mix itself, or any<br>
2 0  components that make up the pre-mix have been heated to<br>
facilitate dissolution of the cationic cellulosic polymer, then preferably the anionic surfactant is added when the pre-mix is at room temperature.  The anionic surfactant according to the present invention can be a single anionic<br>
25  surfactant or a mixture of anionic surfactants.  the addition of anionic surfactant to the pre-mix at room temperature can become important when the anionic surfactant is produced lin-situ' by addition of acid and base as two components to the pre-mix.  This is because this<br>
30  neutralisation reaction will generally be exothermic, producing heat, which may need to be controlled.<br>

The process of the invention requires at least one anionic    surfactant to be added to the cationic cellulosic polymer pre-mix before addition of non-ionic surfactant.  It is possible to add one such anionic surfactant to the pre-mix 5  and add another anionic surfactant later on in the process. It is also possible to add the anionic  surfactant in two or more portions at different times as long at least one anionic surfactant is added to the cationic cellulosic polymer pre-mix before addition of non-ionic surfactant.<br>
10<br>
The anionic surfactant can be added pre-formed to the cationic cellulosic polymer pre-mix, or be made in-situ.  By in-situ, it is meant that one component of the anionic surfactant is added first, then the second component is<br>
15  added, with the added components then forming the anionic surfactant by reacting together.  When the anionic surfactant is made in-situ, preferably the counter-cationic species (the neutralising species for the anionic species) is added to the pre-mix before the anionic component is<br>
20.  added.  Preferably the neutralising species is organic in<br>
nature.  An illustrative example is to add the acid form of an anionic surfactant (LAS acid) and neutralise in-situ with a base.  In this case, it is preferable to add the base {the counter-cationic species) to the  pre-mix first, and then add<br>
25  the acid form of the anionic surfactant.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants are the linear alkyl benzene -sulfonate (LAS) materials. Such surfactants and their preparation are described for example in U.S. Patents 30  2,220,099 and 2,477,383, incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred are the sodium, potassium and mono-,<br>

Licquid Unit Dose<br>
A liquid unit dose fabric treatment composition is made up of a packaging material which encapsulates a set dose of 5  liquid cleaning composition.  The amount of this liquid cleaning composition in the package, i.e. the unit dose volume,'may for example be from 10 ml to 100 ml, e.g. from 12.5 ml to 75 ml, preferably from 15 ml to 60 ml, more preferably from 20 ml to 55 ml.  The substantially non-10  aqueous liquid composition effectively provides a cleaning ■ function when released into the wash liquor.  The unit dose liquid fabric treatment composition can take various product forms, for example a capsule or sachet.<br>
15  Liquid Unit Dose - Packaging Materials<br>
The packaging material of the unit dose composition should fulfil the role of a stable encapsulation material to keep the integrity of the product whole, while also being a<br>
20  material which will dissolve or otherwise dispense the cleaning composition contained within at temperatures associated with laundry conditions.  For the purposes of the present invention, which concerns a non-aqueous liquid fabric treatment composition, the encapsulating material can<br>
25  be a water soluble package formed from a water soluble film.<br>
The water soluble film effectively comprises a water soluble polymer.  As used herein, the term "water soluble polymer" refers to a polymer that dissolves and/or dispenses 3 0  completely in water within 3 0 minutes with agitation, e.g.<br>
by means of hand, stick or other stirrer or under the action<br>

of a mechanical washing machine and at a relevant temperature.  A "relevant temperature" is one at which the consumer will need to dissolve or disperse the polymer component at the beginning of, or during a cleaning process. 5  A polymer is to be regarded as dissolving or  dispersing at a "relevant temperature" if it does so under the aforementioned conditions at a temperature anywhere in the range of from 20°C to 60◦C.<br>
10  Preferred water soluble polymers are those capable of being cast into a film or solid mass and may for example as described in Davidson and Sittig, Water-Soluble Resins,   Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York (1968) .      The water-soluble polymer should have such characteristics, such as<br>
15  strength and heat-sealability, to permit machine handling during the processes of making the water soluble package. Preferred water-soluble resins include polyvinyl alcohol and copolymers thereof, cellulose ethers, polyethylene oxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymaleic anhydride and copolymers<br>
20  thereof, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellulose, acrylamide and copolymers thereof, polyethyleneimine, ethyl hydroxyethylcellulose, ethyl methylcellulo^e, hydroxyethyl methylcellulose.  In this context, it is nested that co¬polymers can be made of 2 or more types of monomers.<br>
25<br>
Water-soluble, polyvinyl alcohol film-forming resins are most preferred for use in the packaging material of the unit dose fabric treatment product.<br>
Polyvinyl alcohols (PVA) preferred for use herein have an 30  average molecular weight anywhere between 1,000 and 100,000,<br>

preferably between 5,000 and 250,000, for example between 15,000 and 150,000.  Hydrolysis, or alcoholysis, is defined as the percent completion of t-he reaction where acetate groups on the resin are substituted with hydroxy1, -OH, 5  groups.  A hydrolysis range of from 60-99% of polyvinyl alcohol film-forming resin is preferred, while a more preferred range of hydrolysis is from about 70-90% for water-soluble, polyvinyl alcohol film-forming'resins.  The most preferred range of hydrolysis is 80-89%.  As used in<br>
10  this application, the term "polyvinyl alcohol" includes polyvinyl acetate compounds with levels of" hydrolysis disclosed herein.  The water-soluble resin film should be formulated so as to substantially completely dissolve in 50°G water with acjitation within about thirty minutes,<br>
15  preferably within about 15 minutes in 50°C water with<br>
agitation, and most preferably within about 5 minutes in 50°C water with agitation.<br>
Suitable PVA films for use in a package according to the 20      invention are commercially available and described, for<br>
example, in EP-B- 291,198.  PVA films for use in a package according to the invention can be made by the copolymerisation of vinyl acetate and a carboxylate-containing monomet (for example acrylic, ma.ieic or itaconic 25  acid or acid esteir) , followed by partial {for example up to about 90%) hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide.<br>
Suitable water soluble films can also be made from blends of two or more polyme;rs/copolymers as mentioned above, and 3 0  having different Compositions or molecular weights.<br>

The water soluble film may further comprise the following minor ingredients: anti-blocking agents, such as silica, fillers (e.g.starch and talc), colourants, release agents and surfactants. 5<br>
Generally speaking, the water soluble film of the invention incorporates a plasticizer system containing one or more plasticizers.  Plasticizers suitable for use with PVA-based films have -OH groups in common with the -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-10  CH (OH) -polymer chain of the film polymer.  Their mode of<br>
functionality is to introduce short chain hydrogen bonding with the chain hydroxyl groups and thus weaken adjacent chain interactions which inhibits swelling of the aggregate polymer mass - the first stage.of film dissolution.<br>
Water itself is a suitable plasticizer for any of the films recited herein-  Other suitable plasticizers are selected from the group consisting of pentane diols, butane diols, propane diols, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, sorbitol,<br>
20  diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and dipropylene glycol.  The plasticizer system may suitably include a plasticizer material which is the same chemical compound as any solvent in the liquid composition.  Furthermore, said plasticizer material may be effectively the main plasticizer<br>
25  in the film.<br>
The total amount of plasticizer in the film (i.e. per unit weight of film) may vary considerably according to the film type and plasticizer type.  It could for example be in the 30  range of from 0.1% to 50%, e.g. 10% to 45%, such as 20% to<br>
40% by weight.  In PVA-based films which are preferably used<br>

in the present invention, the plasticizer system is desirably present in a total amount of above   10% hy  weight.<br>
Encapsulation Methods 5<br>
(a)	Horizontal form-fill-seal<br>
Water soluble films based on PVA can be made according to any of the horizontal form-fill-seal methods described in<br>
10  any of WO-A-00/55044, WO-A-00/55045, WO-A-00/55046, WO-A-00/55068, WO-A-00/55069 and WO-A-00/55415. During the forming, filling and sealing steps of this process, it may be desirable to maintain the relative humidity at a reasonable level.  This is done to maintain<br>
15  the heat sealing characteristics of the film.  When handling thinner films, it may be necessary to reduce the relative humidity to ensure that the films have a relatively low degree of plasticisation and are therefore stiffer and easier to handle.<br>
20<br>
(b)	Vertical Form-Fill-Seal<br>
In the vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) technique, a continuous tube of flexible plastics film is extruded.  It 25  is sealed, preferably by heat or ultrasonic sealing, at the bottom, filled with the liquid composition, sealed again above the liquid film and then removed from the continuous tube, e.g. by cutting.<br>
30   (c)  Rotary Form-Fill-Seal<br>

Alternatively,a rotary form-fill-seal technique may be used.  In this technique, forming, filling and sealing of water soluble packages is carried out using a rotary drum that has forming cavities or recesses on its curved surface.<br>
5<br>
Instead of heat sealing as described above, solvent sealing, ultrasonic sealing or any other type of sealing known in the art could be applied for producing the package of the present invention.  When solvent sealing is used and the 10  film contains PVA, an aqueous solution or water are preferably used as a solvent.<br>

5 Example C - Preparation of non-aqueous detergent formulation with a cationic cellulosic softness polymer using the prior-art route as disclosed in WO-A-2004/056958__at pg 38<br>
In this route, quoted in the above reference at pg. 3 8 as a 0  preferred way to make fabric treatment compositions, a pre-mix of cationic polymer was made in MPG-water solution with the following composition, this can be thought of as a fabric softening system with the following ratio of ingredients:-5<br>
Polymer   4.1% Water    25.6% MPG       70.3%<br>
0  This pre-mix (fabric softening system) was added to the formulation as in example A (a typical fabric cleaning system) except that only half the MPG was added in the surfactant mix.- the other half came with the pre-mix to give the same composition as in Example B-  The ratio of<br>
5 pre-mix to the rest of the formulation was 11.5:88.5. This formulation had a slimy appearance and also proved unstable after some time because the polymer precipitated.<br>

Both formulations of this example were made by dissolving the polymer into the MPG and the water to form a pre-mix, the water activity of the pre-mix was measured to be 0.33 measured at 20°C on a HygroPalm AW obtainable from Rototronic 5  AG of Switzerland as stated earlier.<br>
The percentage composition of the pre-mix was:-<br>
2.0<br>
MPG 85.3% 10  LR-400 polymer Water 12.7%.<br>
The inclusion level of the MPG, Polymer and water pre-mix would be 23.1% of the total weight of the formulation, but<br>
15  it is also possible to make the formulation in situ.  In this example, the pre-mix was heated to a temperature of 45°C.  The following two orders of addition was used, with the ingredients of ingredients done sequentially according to table 4.  The anionic surfactants were added first in<br>
20  formulation 1A, while for comparative purposes in<br>
formulation IB, the non-ionic surfactant was added first. This second formulation was discontinued during the process as a polymer precipitate had already formed.  The formulation details for this example are stated in table 4.<br>
