				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to handpump attachable defluoridation plant.To overcome the excess fluoride problem ,several agencies has came forward with defluoridation techniques. Out of these the activated alumina based technique appears to be the prospective most acceptable defluoridation method.In India,in rural areas,almost every village consists of hand pump for domestic use of water. Due to non availability of nearby potable water source it is demand of the time to develop a suitable defluoridation technique at the hand pump itself.<br>
Effects of excess fluoride consumption:<br>
Fluoride poisoning and the biological response leading to ill effects depends on the<br>
concentration of fluoride in drinking water.<br>
Fluorosis , a disease caused by excess intake of fluoride,is a slow progressive,<br>
crippling malady dimention.The tissues affected by fluoride are<br>
Dental,Skeletal,Non skeletal<br>
Expectant mothers and lactating mothers are the most vulnerable groups.<br>
TABLE<br>
Different fluoride doses(long term ingestion through water)and their effects on<br>
human body<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Fluoride problem in Rajasthan:<br>
Approx.24.71 % (year 2001 )villages/habitations of Rajasthan have been identified as having excess fluoride(&gt;1.5 ppm) in drinking water<br>
Removal of fluoride from water<br>
Several methods have been suggested for removing excessive fluorides in drinking water.These may be broadly divided into two types 1 Those based upon exchange process or adsorption .<br>
The material used in contact beds includes processed bone,natural or synthetic tricalcium phosphate,hydroxy    apatite,magnesia,activated    alumina,activated    carbon    and    ion exchanger.Natural materials includes brick powder, saw dust etc. 2.Those based upon addition of chemicals during treatment.<br>
Chemical treatment methods include the use of either the aluminium salts or lime or magnesium salts. Other methods include addition of material like magnesia,calcium<br>
phosphate,bentonite,   fuller's   earth,mixing and their separation from water by settling<br>
and filtration.<br>
All these methods are not free from draw backs like high initial cost, lack of selectivity<br>
for   fluoride,poor   fluoride   removing   capacity,separation   problem,expertisation   in<br>
regeneration.<br>
Till to  date the  activated alumina based defluoridation technique  appears to be<br>
satisfactory over other techniques.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
I IT Kanpur plant:<br>
In March 1996 the IIT Kanpur reported the development of the hand pump attachable defluoridation plant based on Activated Alumina(AA).<br>
The line diagram 1 explains various parts of the plant.For installation of this plant,the sprout level of handpump is raised by 1.5 m from the normal level by adding additional pedestals.A bypass arrangement is provided to draw raw water directly for non drinking purposes.The raw water is introduced from bottom side of the plant against gravity and the treated water is taken out from the upper side.<br>
Disadvantages of prior art:<br>
The prior art has following disadvantages.<br>
1. the flow of raw water is from the bottom side.Due to this, the retained turbid material<br>
on the bottom side can not be removed.<br>
2.Due to reverse flow arrangement,removal of regenerants requires lot of raw water.<br>
3. The sprout level of the handpump was raised by 1.5m from the normal level by adding<br>
pedestals.A brick masonry platform of 1.5m height was constructed to facilitate the<br>
operation of the handpump. All these arrangements enhanced the hardship of the user.The<br>
extra raised height of the handpump increased the number of strokes.<br>
4.Due to reverse flow arrangement, hard handpump strokes are required to raise the<br>
whole water volume.<br>
Objects of our invention:<br>
1 Flow of raw water is from the top side.Due to this,the retained turbid material can be<br>
easily removed from the top side.<br>
2.Due to gravity flow arrangement and drain out system from the bottom side, removal<br>
of regenerants requires very less quantity of raw water.<br>
3. The original ordinary height of the hand pump is sufficient to work with. Original<br>
iiuurbu of hand pump strokes are unaffected.<br>
4.Due to gravity flow arrangement, hardship with strokes is unaffected.<br>
Due to these, the plant is user friendly.<br>
Summary<br>
From the outlet of the HP,a pipe is taken out.Intermittent to this pipe,a bypass is provided to take out water for non drinking purposes.On the other end of this pipe,the said pkatis attached.Water filters through AA and gravels by gravity and through sipflfning action,it is taken out through outlet valve.The level of the outlet valve is at the top level of the AA.A waste water drain valve is provided at the bottom for use at the time of regeneration of AA.This drain valve can also be used for backwashing(if required). Due to these arrangements,the problems faced in the prior art ,have been completely removed.<br>

Fig.2: Perspective view, showing defluoridisation plant according to one of the embodiment of the invention<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
a.Prior art(Ref.fig.l)<br>
The sprout level(l) of hand pump is raised by 1.5 meters from the normal level by adding additional pedestals. A bypass arrangement(2) is provided to draw raw water directly from the hand pump for non drinking purpose. From the bottom side(3),the raw water enters into the treatment plant.After passing through pebbles(4) and activated alumina bed(5),the treated water comes out of the plant in the form of overflow(6).With the help of a valve(7),the treated water is taken out.<br>
Invention(Ref.fig.2)<br>
From the outlet of the HP,a pipe(l) is taken out.Intermittent to this pipe,a bypass(8) is provided to take out water for non drinking purposes.On the other end of this pipe,the said plant is attached.In between this pipe,a valve(14) is provided for taking the raw (untreated) water into the plant.Water filters through AA(3) and gravels(4) by gravity and through siphoning action,it is taken out through outlet valve(7).The siphoning pipe is fixed with the help of clamps(13)The level of the outlet valve is at the top level of the AAA waste water drain valve/plug (11) is provided at the bottom (5)for use at the time of regeneration of AA.This drain valve can also be used for backwashing(if required).The plant also consists of turbid water drain(lO) and an air vent (9) for taking out the raw water overflow /vacuum air. A cover (12) is also placed on the top side of the plant.<br>
