Description<br>
Isolation/Shut-off Valve<br>
The invention relates to an isolation/shut-off for cryogenic/low temperature mediums with a housing, a valve seating arranged in the housing and an isolation/valve flap controlling the valve seating, which is pivot-mounted in the housing, where on the housing at least one flange for fastening the isolation valve is designed in a pipeline.<br>
Such low temperature-isolation valves are used for isolating/shutting-off of pipelines in which cryogenic mediums, for instance liquid natural gas, liquid hydrogen, liquid air or their constituents, especially liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen or liquid helium.<br>
For fastening the cryogenic-isolation valve in the pipeline, the housing of the isolation valve is equipped with a fastening-flange each on both pipe-side ends. In known cryogenic-isolation valves, the fastening-flange is designed as screw-flange, where the fastening-flange is formed by a ring-shaped flange component provided on the outer circumference of the housing, which is designed with passage bores for seating of the fastening bolts.<br>
Such fastening flange however calls for a high degree of design effort. Moreover, for sealing the isolation valve against leakage in the area of the fastening flange, a sealing device is necessary, for instance, a ring seal/gasket that causes also a high degree f design effort because of the cryogenic-application.<br>
In known cryogenic-isolation valves, the valve seating and the isolation flap can be mounted or dismantled in longitudinal direction of the housing. Thus, for maintenance of the isolation valves, the valves must be detached/removed from the pipeline with the use of the fastening flange, in order to be able to dismantle the valve seating and the isolation flap from the housing. This results in a high maintenance expenditure for the isolation valve.<br>
The above invention is focused on the task to present a cryogenic-isolation valve which offers the generic characteristics referred to at the outset, resulting in a lesser design effort/expenditure and maintenance cost. This task is solved by the invention thereby that the flange of the housing is designed as weld-flange for fastening the isolation valve in the pipeline with the use of a weld-jointing, especially a butt-weld jointing, and that the housing is equipped with a housing opening for assembly and/or disassembly of the isolation flap. With the use of a weld-flange, whereby the housing is jointed with the use of a weld-jointing, especially a butt-weld jointing, with the pipeline, a leakage-free connection of the<br>
 <br>
housing and thereby the isolation valve with the pipeline can be achieved with lesser design expenditure, and a safe/secure operation of the isolation valve can be facilitated. Moreover, through the assembly or disassembly of the isolation flap through the housing-opening, a lesser maintenance cost can be achieved. In this context, the housing remains connected with a pipeline and the isolation flap can be mounted or dismounted in a simple manner through the housing opening.<br>
Particular advantages emerge if as per a design form of the invention, the valve seating is designed on a valve-component, which is detachably fastened in the housing with the use of a flange, specially a screw flange, whereby the valve-component can be mounted and/or dismounted through the housing opening. The valve seating-component can be mounted and dismounted through the housing opening easily in or from the housing arranged on the pipeline for purposes of maintenance. Further, as a result of this, it is easily possible to arrange different valve seatings and/or sealing systems in the housing, as a result of which the isolation valve can be matched easily to different deployment/application conditions.<br>
The housing opening is provided purposefully perpendicular to the rotation axis of the isolation flap, because of which a simple assembly and disassembly of the shut-off valve and the valve seating-component is facilitated through the housing opening.<br>
Special advantages accrue if according to a design form of the invention, the housing diameter of the housing in the area of the weld flange corresponds to the dia of the pipeline. As a result of this, the housing can be connected with a pipeline easily with a butt-weld joint, whereby damages to the isolation flap and the valve seating during the welding can be effectively prevented.<br>
As per a preferred further development of the invention, the isolation flap is in functional contact with a drive shaft, mounted in a bearing component, whereby the bearing component is fastened detachably to the housing in the area of the housing opening. The isolation flap can be located and pivot-mounted in the housing easily with the use of a bang component fastened to the housing. The drive shaft purposefully has a shaft segment mounted in the bearing-component and a shaft segment mounted in the housing, whereby the isolation flap is fastened to the shaft segments in a detachable manner. Through such a divided drive shaft, on which the isolation flap is detachably fastened, whereby one shaft segment is mounted in the bearing component and one shaft segment is mounted opposite to the bearing component in the housing, a large flow cross section can be achieved easily in the pipeline under an open isolation flap.<br>
 <br>
To the extent that a drive device remaining in functional contact with the drive shaft is fastened to the bearing-component, as per a preferred further development of the invention, an advantageous and simple configuration/arrangement of the drive device for driving the shut-off flap is obtained.<br>
According to a preferred design form of the invention, a fastening flange, especially a screw flange is designed on the housing opening, for clamping the bearing component. With such a fastening flange, the bearing component, in which the drive shaft equipped with the isolation flap is mounted and on which the drive device is located, can be easily fixed to the housing. In so far as between the fastening flange and the bearing component as per a preferred further development of the invention a centering-device and/or sealing device is provided, the bearing component with a drive shaft and the isolation flap can be easily centered opposite to the housing provided with the valve seating, and thus a sealing of the housing opening against leakages can be achieved. A very little design cost is involved for the centering- and/or sealing-device if the centering-and/or sealing-device is designed as a projection provided in a surrounding groove, according to a design form of the invention.<br>
To the extent, a blind flange is detachably fastened to the fastening flange provided on the housing opening as per a further development of the invention, the housing opening can be closed/shut-off with very little design expenditure, in case of a dismantled bearing component and thus dismantled isolation flap and where applicable, dismantled valve seating component for the purpose of maintenance- or test-work, in order that further operation visualized for the plant with the pipeline can be facilitated.<br>
Special advantages emerge as per the further development of the invention; a fastening device for the detachable fastening of a testing instrument is designed on the housing in the area of the weld flange. With such a fastening device, after the creation of the isolation valve and before the assembly of the housing, a testing instrument can be fastened easily in the pipeline, in order to be able to carry out a test, especially a permeability test of the isolation valve. After the test of the isolation valve, no further mechanical processing of the isolation valve, especially of the housing in the area of the weld flange is hereby necessary,<br>
Purposefully, the fastening device is designed as a surrounding groove arranged on the housing. On a fastening device created by a groove, the testing instrument can be located with a lesser manufacturing cost.<br>
 <br>
After the assembly of the housing in the pipeline and thus after the welding of the housing with the pipeline, a verification, especially a permeability- and functional-test of the isolation flap and of the valve seating can be easily carried out, if a test housing is planned in which the bearing component equipped with the isolation flap and the valve seating component are attached. After the dismantling of the bearing component with the drive shaft, the drive device and the isolation flap as well as of the valve seating component through the housing opening from the housing welded with the pipeline and a fastening of the valve seating component and of the bearing component provided with the isolation flap, the drive device, a permeability- and functional-test of the isolation flap and of the valve seating component can be carried out in the test housing with very little design expenditure.<br>
Further advantages and details of the invention are explained on the basis of the design examples illustrated in the figures.<br>
Figure 1	a perspective illustration of the invention-based isolation valve<br>
Figure 2	Isolation valve in the longitudinal section<br>
Figure 3	detail X of figure 2 in an enlarged illustration, and<br>
Figure 4	the isolation valve in an assembly- or disassembly-view<br>
An invention-based cryogenic-isolation valve 1, for instance designed as double-eccentric-shut-off valve, is illustrated in figure 1. The isolation valve 1 has a housing 2 in which an isolation flap 3, capable of controlling a valve seating 5, is pivot-mounted around a rotation axis D. The rotation damper/flap 3 in the isolation position is illustrated in figure 2. With the use of a drive shaft 4, divided with reference to the longitudinal axis L, covering a shaft segment 4a and shaft segment 4b, on which the isolation flap 3 is detachably fastened, the isolation flap 3 can be rotated parallel to the longitudinal axis L and thereby parallel to the flow direction in a through-flow position.<br>
As per the invention, the housing 2, at the pipe-side-ends, illustrated on the right left in figure 2, is equipped with flanges designed as weld-flanges 10a, 10b, using which the housing 2 can be fastened in a pipeline coaxial to the longitudinal axis L (not illustrated). The housing dia DM of the housing 2 in the area of the weld flange 10a, 10b in this context corresponds to the pipe diameter of the pipeline (as shown in figure 3) so that the weld joint can be designed as butt-weld-joint.<br>
Further, on the housing 2, as per the invention, a housing opening 11 is designed perpendicular to the rotary axis D, through which the shut-off flap can be mounted or disassembled.<br>
 <br>
A ring-shaped valve seating component 6 is arranged in housing 2, on which the valve seating 5 is formed. In the housing 2, a ring-shaped flange 7 extending itself inward, is designed for fastening the valve seating component 6. The flange is designed as screw-flange whereby the valve seating component 6 is fixed to the flange 7 with the use of fastening bolts 8. Between the isolation flap 3 and the valve seating element 6, a sealing system (not illustrated), for example, a so called block- and bleed- sealing system, can be arranged.<br>
The shaft segment 4b of the drive shaft 4 is pivot-mounted in housing 2, whereby the housing 2 is provided with a corresponding bearing-bore.<br>
For bedding the shaft segment 4a, a bearing component 12 is planned which can shut/close the housing opening 11. The bearing component 12 in this context is fastened detachably on the housing 2 in the area of the housing opening 11 with a ring-shaped fastening flange 13 designed on the housing opening 11. The fastening flange 13 is designed as screw flanged, whereby the bearing component 12 can be fastened to the housing 2 with fastening bolts 14.<br>
Between the fastening flange 13 and the bearing component 12, a centering- and a sealing-device 15 is planned, which is formed by surrounding grooves designed in the fastening flange 13 and a projection formed on the bearing component 12 and engaging itself with a groove.<br>
Further, a tube-shaped carrier-component 17 is attached on the bearing component 12 using a ring-shaped fastening flange 16 designed as screw flange and equipped with fastening bolts 22, on which a drive device 19, staying in functional contact with the drive shaft 4 and thereby the isolation flap 3, is detachably attached with the use of a ring-shaped fastening flange 18, designed as screw flange and equipped with fastening bolts 23.<br>
The weld-flange 10a designed on the housing 2, is formed by a circumferential groove located on the outer circumference of the housing 2, whereby in the area of the circumferential groove a testing instrument/device, is formed by the fastening device 20 which in turn formed by groove 21, as can be seen from figure 3.<br>
For assembling the isolation valve in the pipeline, the housing 2 is connected with the pipeline using the weld-flange 10a, 10b and butt-weld-joints. Hereby, a leak-free connection of the housing 2 with the pipeline can be achieved without additional sealing device and with very little design expenditure. The isolation flap and the valve seating component 6 can be mounted and dismantled through the housing opening 11.<br>
 <br>
The bearing component 12 in which the drive shaft 4a is mounted, on which the isolation flap and the drive shaft 4b are attached, and on which the drive device 19 is fastened using the carrier component 17, as well as the valve seating component 6 can be attached with the pipeline before or after the welding of the housing 2 using the fastening bolts 14,8 located on flanged 13,7.<br>
In order to carry out especially a permeability test of the isolation valve 1 in the pipeline before assembling the housing 2, a testing device is fixed, for instance, using a clamp joint, on the fastening devices 20 formed in the area of the weld-flange 10a, 10b. With such a testing device which can be fixed on the isolation valve with fastening flanges 20, a test, especially a permeability test of the isolation valve 1 can be easily carried out after the production of the isolation valve 1 and before the assembly of the housing 2 in the pipeline.<br>
After the assembly of the housing 2 in the pipeline and thus after the welding of the housing 2 with the pipeline using the weld flange 10a, 10b, a verification especially a permeability- and functional-test of the valve 3 under the valve seating 5 can be carried out easily, if a test housing is proposed in which the bearing-component 12 equipped with the shut-off flap 3 and the valve seating component 6 are detachably fixed. For this purpose, the bearing component 12 are to be detached from the fastening flange 13 using the fastening bolts 14, as a result of which the isolation flap 3 located on the bearing component 12 through the drive shaft 4a together with the drive shaft 4b can be disassembled through the housing opening 11 from the housing 2. After loosening the fastening bolts 8 of the flange 7, the valve seating component 6 can be similarly disassembled from the housing 2 through the housing opening 11.<br>
The bearing component 12 equipped with the drive shafts 4a,4b, the isolation flap 3 as well as the drive device 19 and valve seating component 6 can be accordingly arranged in a test housing, as a result of which a permeability- and functional-test of the shut-off flap 3 and of the valve seating component 6 can be carried out with little design effort. With the valve seating component 6 and the bearing component 12, on which the isolation flap is fixed, removed from the housing 2, the housing opening 11 can be closed by a blind flange which can be fixed to the fastening flange 13 with fastening bolts 14. Thereby, the housing opening 11 can be closed easily enabling a further operation of a plant with a pipeline.<br>
