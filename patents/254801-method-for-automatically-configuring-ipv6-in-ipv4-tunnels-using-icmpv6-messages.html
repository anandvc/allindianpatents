FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of communication with Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). Further, this invention relates to a method for automating the configuration of IPv6 packets encapsulated in an IPv4 packet (IPv6-in-IPv4) tunnels using new ICMPv6 (Internet Control Messages for IPv6) message types to facilitate the communication between multiple IPv6-clouds separated by IPv4 Network. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for configuring tunnel end point using ICPMv6. It is pertinent herein to refer to co-pending application number 1473 CHE 2004.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
IPv4 to IPv6 Transition is currently in the infant stage. Hence, many IPv6 networks are coming up and there is need for connectivity between these clouds through IPv4 backbone. A number of IPv4 to IPv6 Transition mechanisms such as Tunneling, Translation and Dual-Stack Transition Mechanisms are currently being used to enable IPv4 and IPv6 to co-exist and co-work during the transition phase. Tunneling is the most common transition mechanism deployed worldwide. IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels between the clouds establish the IPv6 connectivity transparently to the IPv6 nodes in the clouds over IPv4 backbone/infrastructure.<br>
There is a growing awareness among the standards committees like IETF, 3GPP and 3GPP2 to make efforts to develop and deploy methods to automate the process of establishing IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels so that isolated IPv6 networks or hosts can obtain connectivity to other such IPv6 networks or hosts over IPv4 backbone networks with very minimal changes to existing protocols and equipments.<br>
Presently there are mainly two methods generally employed for the configuration.<br>
f. Manual configuration<br>
In the case of manual configuration, bi-directional IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels have to<br><br>
be configured to reach each and every IPv6 network that attaches to the IPv4<br>
backbone / infrastructure.<br>
2.  Configuration on DHCPvB Servers ttian a Router<br>
This method is found published as an IETF draft from HP &amp; Samsung. According to this method the tunnel end-point configuration list is maintained at the DHCPv6 servers and shared with the nodes belonging to the same network as the DHCPv6 server.<br>
Even though the above-mentioned methods are satisfactory in accomplishing the objectives, they have some limitations. Needless to mention here that the manual method is tedious, requires the presence of network administrator at all times and proper co-ordination. Similarly for the configuration using DHCPv6, it calls for manual configuration on each site on DHCPv6 server than having it on a router. In view of the above drawbacks in state of the art, the present invention proposes a method for configuring tunnel end-point on Dual-Stack (IPv4/IPv6) Border Routers (BR) belonging to isolated IPv6 clouds that joins / attaches to IPv4 backbone / infrastructure, using new ICMPv6 message types.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to provide a method to automate the configuration of tunnel end-points on Dual-Stack (IPv4/IPv6) Border Routers when a new IPv6 cloud network joins IPv4 backbone.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an almost zero-configuration solution wherein Border Routers belonging to isolated IPv6 clouds joins / attach to IPv4 backbone / infrastructure<br>
It is also an object of the invention to employ IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation / decapsulation to send / receive the ICMPv6 messages.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for automating the configuration of<br><br>
IPv6-in-IPv4 (IPv6 packets encapsulated in an IPv4 packet) tunnels using ICMPv6 messages (Internet Control Messages for IPv6) pursuant to the configuration of tunnel end-point information by the administrator on the Main Border Router to facilitate IPv6 connectivity for the new cloud IPv6 nodes in a system having two or more Border Routers (BR) connected through IPv4 with one of them designated as Main Border Router (MBR), the method comprising the steps of,<br>
a)	Main Router sending ICMPv6 CTEP Information message to all the existing clouds (border routers) of the tunnel network;<br>
b)	Border routers of the existing clouds configuring the IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel to the new cloud upon receiving the above said ICMPv6 CTEP Information message, and sending ICMPv6 CTEP Acknowledgement back to Main Border Router; and<br>
c)	Main Border Router sending the total configuration to the new cloud's border router so as to facilitate its integration with the system.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts an example scenario where the method of the present invention is helpful.<br>
Figure 2 shows the operation and message sequence when a new IPv6 network attached to R3 joins the IPv4 backbone comprising of R1 and R2.<br>
Figure 3 shows the operation and message sequence when a new IPv6 network attached to R4 joins the IPv4 backbone comprising of R1, R2 and R3.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The method according to the invention can be used to automate the process of configuhng tunnel end-points for IPv6-in-IPv4 Tunnels between Dual-Stack Border Routers, attached to IPv6 networks, over IPv4 backbone. This method uses new ICMPv6 message types for carrying such configuration information. The dual-stack border router exchanges the ICMPv6 messages as soon as the administrator configures the tunnel end-point of a newly attached IPv6 network. The method uses IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation/decapsulation to send/receive the ICMPv6 messages defined in this invention. The invention proposes to automate the configuration of tunnel-endpoints when a new IPv6 network joins IPv4 backbone. This method tries to provide an almost zero-configuration solution.<br>
If there exists an n-cloud mesh topology IPv4 network and (n+1)th network cloud wants to attach to the n-cloud mesh then the no. of manual configurations = 2*n.<br>
According to the invention, we assume the presence of Border Routers with Dual-Stack (supports both IPv4 and IPv6) capability. One of the Border Routers (BR) is designated as Main Border Router with respective administrator's perspective. These border routers will act as default/gateway routers for one or more IPv6 networks connected to its downstream links. The upstream links from these border routers are connected to IPv4 backbone networks.<br><br>
The following broad steps are involved in the proposed invention:<br>
A.	Admin configures the New Network's data on the Main Border Router.<br>
B.	Main Router sends ICMPv6 CTEP Info Message to all the existing clouds<br>
(border routers) of the tunnel network<br>
C.	The existing clouds' border routers after receiving this ICMPv6 CTEP Info<br>
Message, configure IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel to the new cloud and send ICMPv6<br>
CTEP Ack back to Main Border Router.<br>
D.	Main Border Router also sends the total configuration to the new cloud's<br>
border router.<br>
The method will be triggered when the administrator configures the tunnel end-point information at the main border router. The details procedures are described below.<br>
