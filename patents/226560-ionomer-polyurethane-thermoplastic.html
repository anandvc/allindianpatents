				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The  present  invention  refers  to  a  new  ionomeric thermoplastic polyurethane that can be obtained and handled in solid  form  and  which  is  susceptible  to  being  easily transformed in an aqueous dispersion with an ionic character. State of the Art<br>
Among those thermoplastic polyurethanes, those which are normally referred to by the initials TPU, the water dispersible ionomeric type, known for some time, are based on the incorporation of monomers having ionizable groups, both cationic, for example neutralizable or quaternizable tertiary amine groups, and anionic, for example free carboxylic or sulfonic groups susceptible to being neutralized with bases in an aqueous medium.<br>
US Patent number 3,479,310, published in 1969, discloses said TPU type and a wide range of monomers incorporating ionizable moieties, although only specific TPU examples incorporating monomer units with cationic character groups are included, mainly N-methyl diethanol amine.<br>
Said patent indicates that the monomer incorporating the ion group can be introduced in a prepolymer which is .subsequently dispersed in an aqueous medium with the neutralizing agent, with the object of proceeding to its definitive polymerization. It also indicates that the polyurethane mass can be obtained, and once the polymerization has finished, add a water miscible organic solvent, acetone •for example, and disperse the dissolved mass in water and a neutralizing agent to obtain the ready-to-use TPU aqueous dispersion once the organic solvent has been eliminated.<br>
The ionomeric TPU aqueous dispersions have numerous fields of application, among which their use as industrial adhesives can be mentioned, for example in the footwear industry,  and their use as coating materials for flexible<br>
substrates, such as fabrics and materials imitating the skin, and rigid substrates, such as in industrial paints and varnishes.<br>
US Patent number 3,412,054 discloses water-dilutable polyurethanes by means of the reaction of polyisocyanates with hydroxylated carboxylic acids of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is hydrogen, hydroxymethyl or alkyl of up to 20<br>
carbon  atoms,   2,2-di(hydroxymethyl)propionic  acid  being<br>
mentioned as preferred, also known as 2,2-dimethylol propionic<br>
acid, or simply dimethylol propionic acid or DMPA.<br>
These monomers are incorporated to the polyurethane by means of conventional processes disclosed in said patent, the water and neutralizing agent being incorporated in the final part of the process for obtaining the aqueous dispersions.<br>
US Patent number 4,956,438 discloses that the monomer ^jrotaining ion groups is incorporated to a prepolymer, neutralized in an aqueous medium, then proceeding to extend the polymer chain in said medium. In other words, the disclosed process directly leads to obtaining the TPU aqueous dispersion.<br>
This technique, with different variants, is that which is normally used in manufacturing TPU dispersions, such as that also disclosed in US Patent number 5,155,163, disclosing the following process:<br>
1)	preparing  the  prepolymer  by  reaction  of  the diisocyanate, the polyol solvent and DMPA,<br>
2)	partial  extension  of  the  prepolymer  with  a  low molecular weight diol, if desired<br>
3)	neutralizing the carboxylic groups with a base,<br>
4)	dispersing or emulsifying the polymer in water,<br>
5)	definitive chain extending with a low molecular weight diamine, and<br>
6) adjusting the ratio of solids and the viscosity of the dispersion.<br>
Thus, the disclosed technique indicates that the ionomeric TPU aqueous dispersions are obtained within an integrated polymerization process, or as a final step thereof, or by carrying out the dispersion in water and the neutralization on a prepolymer prior to the definitive extension of the polymer chains, this latter being the most commonly used technique.<br>
This implies that the user of the TPU aqueous dispersions, which do not usually coincide with the manufacturer of the polymers, must acquire and store the prepared aqueous dispersions, which normally have large amounts of water, normally higher than 50% by weight, making the transport and storage thereof more costly and wears down the stability of the polymer.<br>
US Patent number 4,276,044 discloses a solution for solving said drawback, focused on obtaining TPU aqueous solutions (not dispersions) and only applicable in a specific case from among the multiple applications of water dispersible TPUs, specifically in the finish of textiles. Said patent discloses polymers prepared as from the following monomers:<br>
(a)	organic diisocyanates with molecular weight of 160-300,<br>
(b)	tri- and/or tetra-ethylene glycol,<br>
(c)	optionally, other glycols with molecular weight of 62-200, and<br>
(d)	glycols with molecular weight lower than 500 containing carboxylic or sulfonic groups,<br>
in a ratio of NCO/OH equivalents lower than 1:1, the carboxylic or sulfonic groups being at least partially converted to carboxylate or sulfonate groups after the reaction, and characterized in that they contain<br>
(e)	from 25 to 40% by weight ujethane groups,<br>
(f)	from 0.03 to 1.5% by weight hydroxyl groups,<br>
(g)	from 10 to 80 milliequivalents per 100 g carboxylate<br>
and/or sulfonate groups, and (h) from 10 to 40% by weight incorporated tri- and/or tetra-<br>
ethylene  glycol  units,  either  between  two  urethane<br>
groups, or between a urethane group and a hydrogen.<br>
These polymers contain a very high ratio of polar carboxylic and/or sulfonic groups and can be directly dissolved in water by means of adding a base, for their use in the finish for textiles. The patent indicates that the polymers object thereof can be obtained in the form of hardened resins that are easily water soluble, which can be stored and supplied to the final user so that said user can prepare the aqueous solution.<br>
It is clear that the polymers disclosed in US patent number 4,276,044 do not alone constitute a solution to the posed drawback, although only for obtaining TPUs capable of forming aqueous solutions, not dispersions, with an application in a particular case from among the numerous fields of application of TPUs. Therefore, the drawback of finding alternative solutions that are also viable for their use in different fields of application of TPUs persists. Object of the Invention<br>
Part of the object of the present invention are new ionomeric thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) susceptible to being stored an3~TTandTe"d in soTicT form for the subsequent use thereof in the preparation of TPU aqueous dispersions, which have an application as industrial adhesives and as materials<br>

Eventually, the carboxylic and sulfonic groups of the ionomeric glycols can be neutralized with a counter-anion, for example with tertiary aliphatic amines with a C!-C6 chain, aromatic amines and heterocyclic compounds such as morpholine and piperidine.<br>
The preferable weight ratio of the ionomeric glycol with regard to the total weight of the reacting monomers is comprised between 0.5% and 2%.<br>
In the case that one of the difunctional polyols used contained ionizable carboxylic or sulfonic groups, the ratio of extending ionomeric glycols is adjusted so that the total of the ionizable anion moieties of the finished polymer does not exceed what the same would contain in the case that the single monomer containing them were the ionomeric glycol and said glycol were at a weight ratio of 3% with regard to the total weight of the reacting monomers, preferably not higher<br>
than 2%.<br>
The polymerization reaction temperature is preferably maintained between 190° C and 260° C, more preferably between 235° C and 250° C. The reaction time, which equals the continuous residence time of the mass in the reactor, is preferably comprised between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, more preferably between 1 and 2 minutes.<br>
Once the reaction has finished, the product is cut or molded in a melted state, such that it hardens in the desired shape when cooled. It is preferred to carry out a hot extrusion at a temperature that permits cutting the mass in the form of pearls which, when cooled, harden and acquire a transparent or opaque aspect, depending on the nature of the TPU.<br>
Object of the invention are those ionomeric TPUs whose features significantly coincide with those obtained by means of the reaction conditions and the aforementioned monomers, therefore the TPUs that were eventually obtained by means of another type of process, for example discontinuous batch processes, also form part of the object of the invention in the case that said TPUs significantly coincide with said features.<br>
Also object of the invention is a process for preparing the previously described ionomeric TPUs, which is characterized in that it comprises the following steps:<br>
(A)	mixing the different monomers in a continuous reactor, in the absence of solvents, in the presence of a polymerization catalyst and at a temperature comprised between 180° C and 300° C,<br>
(B)	keeping the residence time of the reaction mass in the continuous reactor for a time interval comprised between 30 seconds and 5 minutes, and<br>
(C)	shaping and cooling the obtained product.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably kept between 190° C and 260° C, more preferably between 235° C and 250° C. The<br>
residence time of the mass in the continuous reactor is preferably comprised between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, more preferably between 1 and 2 minutes.<br>
The polymerization catalyst is preferably a tin or bismuth salt with a C6-C22 aliphatic carboxylic acid, for example tin octanoate.<br>
It is also preferred to add an antioxidant to the reaction mixture, for example those of the IRGANOX type, preferably those with a phenolic structure, and those of the TINUVIN type, preferably stearically hindered amines or benzotriazoles.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in a twin screw extruder with the shape of a reactor, regulating its rotational speed such that the advance of the reaction mass permits the previously mentioned residence times.<br>
The product can be extruded and cut at a temperature comprised between 180° C and 230° C, depending on the mean molecular weight thereof, in order to obtain hardened pearls after cooling and consisting of a transparent or opaque aspect.<br>
The thus obtained ionomeric TPUs object of the invention can be handled, stored, for example in bags, drums or boxes, and transported with no problems, since they have a structure, hardness and stability that are very suitable for this.<br>
Aqueous dispersions can be easily obtained from said ionomeric TPUs, in which the free carboxylic and/or sulfonic moieties are at least partially neutralized with a base, having an application in different industrial fields, such as adhesives and coating for flexible and rigid surfaces.<br>
Said dispersions have the aspect of a whitish or bluish translucent liquid with a solid content comprised between 30% and 60% by weight, preferably between 35% and 55% by weight, and with a pH comprised between 6 and 10, preferably between 7 and 9.<br>
The  process  for preparing  the  ionomeric  TPU  aqueous<br><br>
dispersions object of the invention is characterized in that it comprises the following steps:<br>
(A)	dissolving the TPU in a water miscible organic solvent, heating if necessary to obtain dissolution,<br>
(B)	adding water and an inorganic or organic base in a sufficient quantity so that the pH of the final obtained dispersion is comprised between 6 and 10,<br>
(C)	distilling the organic solvent and adding more water until obtaining a dispersion with a solid content comprised between 30% and 60% by weight.<br>
The water miscible organic solvent can be any which, maintaining said condition, is capable of dissolving the ionomeric TPU, even with heat. Although this indication is enough for the skilled person in the art, acetone, tetrahydrofurane, pyrrolidone and dimethylformamide can be mentioned among other solvents, acetone being the preferred solvent for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
The amount of organic solvent to be used in each case will depend on factors such as the composition of the monomers of the polymer and the molecular weight thereof, but in any case, it must be enough to obtain a practically complete dissolution, even with heat.<br>
The base in step (B) is preferably added dissolved in the water and can be an organic or inorganic type. Among those organic bases, those which can be mentioned, among others, without going into great detail, are Ci~C6 chain aliphatic amines, such as triethylamine, eventually hydroxylated, aromatic amines and the heterocyclic compounds such as morpholine and piperidine. Among the inorganic bases, ammonium hydroxides or alkaline and/or alkaline-earth metal hydroxides, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide, can be mentioned, and also base-character salts, carbonates and bicarbonates of alkaline metals being among those that can be mentioned, for example sodium or potassium carbonates.<br><br>
The amount of base to be added depends on the pH one wishes to obtain in the aqueous dispersion, being preferable an amount of base providing a pH in the final product comprised between 7 and 9. If desired, buffering systems can be added that help set the pH in the desired zone.<br>
Once the neutralization reaction has finished, the organic solvent is eliminated by means of distillation, which is aided by the choice of a solvent with a relatively low boiling point, such as acetone.<br>
Once the solvent is eliminated, more water is added to complete the volume, eventually together with a non-ionic surfactant, up to reaching a dispersion with the desired solid content, preferably comprised between 35% and 55% by weight.<br>
The examples which follow below are explained for the purpose of providing a sufficiently clear and complete explanation of the present invention for the skilled person in the art, but they should not be considered limiting of the essential aspects of the object thereof, as they have been explained in the previous sections of this description. Examples<br>
Examples 1 to 5      Obtaining ionomeric TPUs a) General synthesis method<br>
The different monomers are mixed in a twin screw extruder with the shape of a reactor, provided with heating, at a temperature comprised between 235° C and 250°, and from 20 to 200 ppm over the total weight of tin octanoate, in the case that an aromatic diisocyanate is used, or from 300 to 500 ppm of the same catalyst in the case that an aliphatic diisocyanate is used. If desired, a small amount of an IRGANOX type antioxidant is added, preferably with a phenolic structure, or of the TINUVIN type, preferably stearically hindered amines or benzotriazoles.<br>
The mass is made to advance through the reactor by means of the rotational speed, maintaining the previously indicated temperature, such that the residence time of the reaction mass<br><br>
in the reactor is comprised between 1 and 2 minutes.<br>
At the outlet of the extruder, the product is cut in the shape of pearls, cooled and dried, it therefore being possible to proceed to the packaging and storage thereof, b) Obtained ionomeric TPUs<br>
Following the previously explained general synthesis method, the ionomeric TPUs of examples 1 to 5 are prepared, which are obtained from the monomers detailed in table 1.<br>
Table 1.- Examples 1 to 5<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Examples 6 to 10     Obtaining the aqueous dispersions a) General preparation method<br>
Acetone is introduced in a suitable reactor, provided with heat, reflux condenser and distillation system, and next, while stirring, the TPU pearls obtained in examples 1 to 5 are<br>
introduced. It is heated up to the acetone reflux temperature and the stirring continues until obtaining the complete dissolution. Next, water in which sodium hydroxide has been dissolved is added to the dissolution and the neutralization reaction is maintained for another hour between 50 and 60° C.<br>
Once the neutralization has finished, the acetone is distilled, and while the acetone is distilled, more water is added in which a non-ionic surfactant was previously dissolved, preferably polyoxyethylenated of 80 moles of ethylene oxide, at the same speed with which the acetone is distilled.<br>
An ionomeric TPU aqueous dispersion is obtained in this manner having a pH comprised between 6 and 10 and is a bluish-white color, b) Obtained ionomeric TPU dispersions<br>
