The invention relates to a herbicidal emulsifiable concentrate composition.<br>
Dinitroanihne herbicides such as pendimethalin and trifluralin, and oxyacetamide herbicides such as fluthiamid are known in the art. Combination treatments using these types of herbicides are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,968,342 and 5,759,955; and in German Application No. 19720367. However, emulsifiable concentrate compositions comprising dinitroanihne and oxyacetamide herbicides are not known in the art.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,898,075 relates to stabilized liquid compositions containing m-biscarbamates and organic acids. U.S. Patent 2,954,396 describes a method for stabilizing carbamate esters with certain hydrolysis inhibitors. However, neither U.S. Patent 3,898,075 nor U.S. Patent 2,954,396 describe any method for the stabilization of oxyacetamide herbicides.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide stable emulsifiable concentrate compositions of dinitroanihne herbicides and oxyacetamide herbicides.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the description below.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The scope of the invention should not be deemed limited by the examples, but encompasses the entire subject matter defined m the claims.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of emulsifiable concentrate compositions<br>
A mixture of a 60% calcium dodecylbenzene sulfonate solution in isobutanol commercially available as SOPROPHOR' 70 from Rhodia, Milan, Italy (53. Og, 5.00% on a weight basis), a C12 ethoxylated fatty alcohol containing 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole commercially available as RHODASURF" 870 from Rhodia, Milan, Italy (32.Og, 3.00% on a weight basis), a silicone antifcam commercially available as SILCCLAFSE' 431 from Rhodia, Lyon, France (O.lg, 0.01% on a weight basis) ,   and an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture (C10-C13) aromatics having a distillation range of abouc 22 6-279°C commercially available as SOLVSSSO 200 from Exxon, Fareham, Hants, United Kingdom (557.0g, 52.29% on a weight basis) is stirred until homogeneous. Molten pendimethalin (333.3g, 90% real, 31.33% on a weight basis) and a molten butyl capped ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer  commercially available as WITCONOL' NS 500K from Witco SA, Saini:-Pierre Les Elbeuf, France (21.Og, 2.00% on a weight basis) are added to the mixture with stirring.  Solid fluthiamid (66.7g, 90% real, 6.27% on a weight basis) is then added to the mixture and the mixture is scirred until all of the solids dissolve.  An 85% phosphoric-acid solution (l.Og, 0.10% on a weight basis) is added to the mixture, with stirring until homogeneous, zo obtain the emulsifiable concentrate composition identified as composition number 1 in Table I.<br>
Using essentially the same procedure, the emulsifiable concentrate compositions identified as composition numbers 2 to 14 in Table I are obtained.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2 Evaluation of storage stability of test compositions<br>
Samples of test compositions identified in Table I and a comparative composition identified below are placed in glass bottles.  The bottles are capped and placed in a temperature controlled storage incubator. After completing the required storage period; the samples are removed and assayed for pendimethalin and fluthiamid content.  The active ingredient content: is expressed as a percentage relative to the active ingredient content prior to storage (% Initial Content).  The results are summarized in Table II.<br>
As can be seen from the data in Table II, fluthiamid is more stable in the emulsifiable concentrate compositions of the present invention which contain phosphoric acid than the comparative emulsifiable concentrate composition which does net contain phosphoric acid.<br>
