This invention relates to air jets as used in the textile industry for the purpose of intermingling filaments, twisting, texturing and combining textile yarns. Such jets usually have a channel running through the body of the jet through which the yarn or yarns travel to be subjected to the effect of a transversely directed jet of air.<br>
One of the problems associated with air jets of this type is that of threading the yarn or yarns through the yarn channel in the jet body. The original methods of threading using a needle or weight attached to the yarn were very time consuming and are not acceptable for modern high speed yarn processing machines. There are many jet designs which incorporate a threading slot communicating with the yarn channel over the length of the jet body, but such slots can impair the air flow in the yarn channel, create a tendency for the yarns to migrate into the slot, thereby preventing correct processing of the yarn, or even allow the yam to escape from the jet. To avoid such problems, various arrangements have been devised for opening the jet to expose the yarn channel for access from the outside of the jet for yarn threading purposes and then for closing the jet to commence yarn processing. In one known type of jet, the yarn channel is in a central part of the jet body which is arranged to slide laterally relative to upper and lower parts, thereby exposing the channel and simultaneously closing the air inlet to the sliding central part to stop the flow of air into the yarn channel. This involves one surface sliding under pressure across a seal, which leads to rapid wear of the seal. Furthermore, the pivoted lever mechanism used to produce the sliding motion puts considerable stresses on the parts and in consequence is also prone to wear. Therefore, such an arrangement leads to high maintenance costs. In addition, this type of jet is very bulky and space for air jets in textile machines is restricted. Another type of opening air jet involves an upper part of the jet rotating relative to the lower part to expose the yarn channel in the lower part and simultaneously stop the flow of air through the lower part to the yarn channel. Such an arrangement has the serious disadvantage that the air inlet must be offset from the yarn channel in order that it can be closed by the rotated upper part when the channel is exposed for threading purposes, and in consequence during yarn processing the path of air from the inlet through the two parts of the jet to the yarn channel involves several changes of direction. This seriously reduces the air flow and its pressure when it reaches the yarn channel, thereby reducing the processing effectiveness of the air jet. Another problem is that exposing the yarn channel before the air is switched off and switching the air on whilst the yarn channel is still exposed can cause the yarn or at least some filaments to be blown out of the channel with the possibility of snagging on adjacent machine parts. In addition, maintaining satisfactory sealing of the resulting tortuous yam path through the two parts of the jet is difficult.<br><br>
2<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an air jet which avoids, or at least reduces to an appreciable extent, the disadvantages of the known air jets.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an air jet having a base and an operating part, the base having a yarn channel therein and an air inlet having a sealing surface and communicating with the yarn channel, the operating part being movable relative to the base between an operating position in which the operating part covers the yarn channel and a threading position in which the yarn channel is exposed, characterised by a valve member disposed in the air inlet and a connecting part connecting the valve member and the operating part, whereby movement of the operating part between the operating position and the threading position causes the valve member to move into and out of contact with the sealing surface to open and close the air inlet.<br>
Preferably the axis of the air inlet intersects the longitudinal axis of the yarn channel. The axis of the air inlet may be inclined to the longitudinal direction of the yarn channel at an angle of between 70° and 90°, preferably substantially 80° in the direction of travel of a yarn through the yarn channel.<br>
The air inlet may comprise a connecting bore and a counterbore having a larger diameter than that of the connecting bore. The connecting bore may communicate with the yarn channel and the counterbore may be adapted to receive an air supply connector. The valve member may comprise a valve head<br><br>
2A <br>
located in the counterbore and adapted to seal the air inlet at the transition from the counterbore to the connecting bore. The valve member may also comprise an arm disposed in the base so as to be movable therein, having the valve head at one end thereof. The connecting part may comprise a pin located in the base to have one end thereof in contact with the arm and the other end in contact with a cam surface provided on the operating part. The cam surface may be positioned whereby the valve member closes the air inlet prior to the operating part moving sufficiently to expose the yarn channel.<br>
The operating part may be mounted on the base to rotate relative thereto, and may rotate about an axis which is offset from and substantially perpendicular to the yarn channel. The valve member may close the air inlet when the operating part has rotated through 30° from the operating position, and may fully open the air inlet when the operating part has rotated to within 10° of the operating position. A stop arrangement may be provided to limit the rotation of the operating part to substantially 90°. The stop arrangement may comprise an upstanding wall on the base with which the operating part is in contact when the operating part is in the operating or threading position. One of two substantially mutually perpendicular sides of the operating part may be in contact with the wall when the operating part is in the operating or threading position. The operating part may comprise a handle portion. The operating part may be resiliently biased towards the base.<br><br>
3 One embodiment of the invention will now be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is an exploded view of an air jet in the operating configuration, Fig. 2 is a dual sectional view of the jet in the operating configuration, and Fig. 3 is a part sectional view of the jet in threading configuration.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown an air jet 10 for the purpose of intermingling filaments, twisting, texturing or combining textile yarns. The air jet 10 comprises a base 11, consisting of a base block 11a and a base plate 11b, and an operating part 12, consisting of a handle part 12a and a top plate 12b. Base block 11a and handle part 12a may be made of aluminium alloy, brass or plastics material. Base plate 11b and top plate 12b, which in use are mutually in contact and slide relative to each other, may be made of stainless steel, carbide, alumina or ceramic material for wear resistance. A screw 13, on which is a spring 14, fits into a bore 15 in the handle part 12a to secure the parts 12a, 12b, 11b and 11a together. The spring 14, compressed between the head of the screw 13 and the base of the bore 15, ensures that the required pressure is maintained between the top'plate 12b and the base plate 11b, whilst allowing relative movement between the operating part 12 and the base 11.<br>
Extending across the base plate 11b is a yarn channel 16. A small bore 17 intersects the yarn channel 16 coaxially to provide an air inlet to the channel 16, and the bore 17 is inclined to the longitudinal direction of the yarn channel 16 by<br><br>
3A an angle A to assist in forwarding the yarn through the channel 16. The angle A may be between 0° and 20°, preferably substantially 10°. The bore 17 communicates with a connecting bore 18 in the base block 11a, which in turn communicates with a counterbore 19 having a larger diameter than that of the connecting bore 18. The bores 17, 18 and 19 are all in axial alignment with the yarn channel 16 so that the air travels along a relatively straight path through the base 11. An air supply connector 20 is received in the counterbore 19.<br>
Also opening into the connecting bore 18 is a groove 21 formed in the base block 11a. Received in the groove 21 and the bores 18, 19 is a valve member 22 formed with a valve head 23 and an arm 24. The valve head 23 is disposed in the counterbore 19 and the arm 24 extends along the groove 21. Around the valve head 23 is an O-ring seal 25. A pin 26 is located in a bore 27 in the base plate 11 b, the bottom of the pin 26 being in contact with the arm 24 as it extends along   the   groove 21. The   top   of  the   pin 26 is either received in a recess<br><br>
4 28 formed in the underside 29 of the top plate 12b or is in contact with that underside 29,<br>
depending upon the position of the operating part 12 relative to the base 11, as is described<br>
below.<br>
An upstanding wall 30 is provided at the rear of the base block 11 a to provide a stop to limit the rotational motion of the operating part 12 relative to the base 11. Edge 31 of the top plate 12b is in contact with the wall 30 when the operating part 12 is in the operating configuration, and edge 32 of the top plate 12b is in contact with the wall 30 when the operating part 12 is in the threading configuration.<br>
Operation of the air jet 10 will be more clearly understood by consideration of Figs. 2 and 3. In Fig. 2, the air jet 10 is in the operating configuration. In this configuration the top plate 12b covers the yarn channel 16. The underside 29 of the top plate 11b pushes downwardly on the pin 26 which in turn pushes downwardly on the arm 24. This pressure causes the valve head 23 to move away from the lower end of the connecting bore 18, thereby allowing air to pass from the air inlet connector 20, around the valve head 23 and subsequently through the bores 18 and 17 to the yarn channel 16.<br>
For threading, the handle part 12a is rotated through 90°, about the axis of the screw 13 which is offset from and perpendicular to the yarn channel 16, to the threading configuration shown in Fig. 3. When this occurs, a lip 33 on the handle part 12a ensures that the top plate 12b moves with the handle part 12a. The yarn channel 16 is thereby exposed to allow access from outside the air jet 10 for laying the yarn or yarns into the channel 16.. At the same time, the movement of the operating part 12 allows the pin 26 to ride up an inclined cam surface 34 to be received in the recess 28 in the top plate 12b. The pressure of the air on the valve head 23 forces the valve member 22 to rise, so that the arm 24 pushes the pin 26 upwardly into the recess 28. This movement of the valve member 22 brings the sealing ring 25 into sealing engagement with the transition region between the counterbore 19 and the connecting bore 18, thereby stopping the air flow from the air inlet connector 20 to the yarn channel 16. On returning the handle part 12a to the operating position shown in Fig. 2, the inclined cam surface 34 pushes the pin 26 and the valve member 22 downwardly again thereby opening the air gap around the valve head 23.<br>
The position of the cam surface 34 is such that the pin 26 rides up the cam surface 34 and reaches the bottom of the recess 28 in the top plate 12b within 30° of rotation of the operating part 12 from the operating position shown in Fig. 2. This avoids the problem of the yarn being blown out of the yarn channel 16 since the channel 16 is only exposed when the valve head 23<br><br>
5 is in contact with the lower end of the connecting bore 18 and the air is switched off.  Similarly,<br>
to ensure correct operation of the air jet 10 even if the operating part 12 is not fully moved to<br>
the operating position, the pin 26 rides down the cam surface 34 onto the bottom surface 29 of<br>
the top plate 12b to switch the air fully on when the operating part 12 is within 10° of the<br>
operating position.<br>
By means of the invention a relatively compact air jet is provided which has many advantages over the known air jets.. Movement of the operating part does not involve sliding of one part of the jet over a seal and does not introduce significant stresses on the parts of the jet, thereby reducing the wear and maintenance of the jet. Also the path of the air through the air jet is substantially straight so that no sealing problems arise and there is no loss of air flow or pressure at the yarn channel. Other embodiments of air jet in accordance with the invention will be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art. For example, the motion of the operating part relative to the base may be linear, such as along slides, instead of rotational, without introducing the problems of the known sliding arrangement. The configuration of the valve member 22, connecting bore 18 and counterbore 19 may differ from that described above, e.g. the connecting bore 18 may be dispensed with and valve head 23 may seal with its upper surface against the underside of the base plate 11 b instead of the connecting bore/counterbore interface as described above. Alternatively, the connecting bore 18 may be of larger diameter than the counterbore 19 so that the air pressure opens the valve member 22 upwardly when the operating part 12 is in the operating configuration and the motion of the operating part 12 to the threading configuration closes the valve member 22 downwardly instead of the reverse arrangement described above.<br><br>
