Background of the invention:<br>
The invention pertains to the field of solar water heater, more particularly to a high efficient water heater. Precisely this invention relates to a high efficient, compact solar water heater with interconnected fins.<br>
The main object of the invention is to design a novel Solar water heater which is unique in constrcution The novelty designed water heater wilt be cheaper as compared to Sotar water heaters known in the art.<br>
Further one of the design parameter of the solar water heater is such that the factor namely even when there is sudden evacuation of water from the storage tank, it will not shrink and hence the draw back of shrinkage when there is a vacuum in the storage tank is eliminated.<br>
The present invention relates to solar water heater, and more particularly, by incorporating high efficient heat exchange made of with inter connected fins in a novel manner to get high efficiency and to make a compact system. Since the interconnected fins are incorporated around the stainless tubes, these water can be used for cooking and drinking. The use of the existing solar water heater is to heat water for bathing and/or for commercial use, but, it cannot be used for cooking and drinking. The main object of this invention is to use this invention for multipurpose including cooking and drinking. And the present invention is very compact and economical and it can be installed even on flats etc. The present solar water heater available is bigger in size, so it cannot be installed on flats and it is costlier also.<br><br><br>
Now the inventor has developed a novel solar water heater. These novel solar water heater will heat the water speedily within a short span of time.<br>
The object of this invention is to heat the water for multipurpose including drinking and cooking purpose.<br>
Another object of this invention is thai it is compact and can be installed on flats.<br>
Another object of this invention is to overcome the draw back of shrinkage of water tank <br>
when there is vacuum in the tank.<br>
Another main object of this invention is to provide a very cost effective solar water heater.<br>
Summary of this invention:<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide very economical compact solar water heater, for multipurpose including drinking and cooking.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a solar water heater comprising of plurality of heat exchanger with interconnected metallic fins having contact with metallic pipe provided for water flow, wherein metallic pipe being surrounded by the said interconnected fins; an inside insulated outer case closed with transparent glass on the top; a vertical storage tank with insulation in the outer side, water inlet and outlet, water suction and discharge header, and gazer, the heat exchanger is transposed into an inside insulated outer case, the top of the outer case is covered with transparent glass supported by retainers; collector is connected with vertical storage tank wherein water inlet and out 1^8 Bre provided.<br>
Figure 1 of the drawing shows the construction details of this novel Solar water heater.<br><br>
The present invention has an out side insulated storage tank(l). The storage tank(l) is<br>
insulated(3) as referred in Fig -lA.<br>
Figure 2-, shows the construction details of the solar collector.<br>
Figure -3, shows the constraction details of the heat exchanger..<br>
There is a lid(4) on the top of the tank which can be opened as and when required The tank is vertical in size so as to improve the efficiency of heat transfer and also very easy to install on walls, floor etc.<br>
There is a heat exchanger (2), refer fig -2- which is made of Black Chromium coated copper, or aluminum, or nicole fins (5) (Refer Fig-3) which are interlocked with each other to increase the heat transfer. Through the copper fins stainless steel tube (6) is passed These stainless steel tubes are surrounded by the fins(5) very tightly. So the stainless tubes are very much in contact with the copper fins there by increase the heat transmission. The fins are made in such a way to keep them interlocked, inter connected with each other (Refer Fig No. 3 mark (19)). This heat exchanger (2) is being transposed into an inside and insulated (7) outer casing(9). The top of the outer casing (9) is closed with transparent glass(8) and supported by retainers (16). The retainers(16) so provided, protects the glass from breakage when the air in the collector is evacuated<br>
The air inside the solar collector is evacuated there by loss of temperature due to convension is reduced The casing is very air tight so that vacuum will be maintained inside the casing. This collected is connected to the water storage tank (1) through pipe connections (11 &amp; 12) (Refer Fig No. 1).<br>
When sunlight falls on the collector (10), the temperature of the interconnected metallic fins(5) start raising there by the heat of the interconnected fins is transmitted to the metallic water pipe(6) and the temperature of the water in the pipe goes up and this<br><br>
water enters into the insulated tank (1), since the collector is kept in a slopped anner, the hot water in the storage tank goes up, so that the cold water will come down and enters in to the collector(10). This phenomena is repeated<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I claim<br>
1.	A solar water heater comprising of plurality of heat exchanger with<br>
interconnected metallic fins having contact with metallic pipe provided for water<br>
flow, wherein metallic pipe being surrounded by the said interconnected final  an<br>
inside insulated miter case closed with transparent glass on the top; a vertical<br>
storage tank with insulation in the outer side , water inlet and outlet, water<br>
suction and discharge header, and gazer, the heat exchanger is transposed into an<br>
inside insulated outer case, the top of the oouter case is covered with transparent<br>
glass supported by retainers; collector is connected with vertical storage tank wherein water inlet and out lets are provided.<br>
2.	A solar water heater as claimed in claim 1 wherein plurality of heat exchanger<br>
made of interconnected metallic fins having contact with the metallic pipe<br>
provided for water flow.<br>
3.	A solar water heater as claimed in claim 1 wherein a outside insulated, vertical<br>
storage tank provided with water inlet, outlet, gazer, water suction and discharge<br>
header.<br>
4.	A solar water heater as claimed in claim 1 wherein an inside insulated, outer<br>
casing, closed with transparent glass on the top.<br>
5.	A Solar water heater substantially as herein described and illustrated by way of<br>
accompanying drawing.<br><br></td>
