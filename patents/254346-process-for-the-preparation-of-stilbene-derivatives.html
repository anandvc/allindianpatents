Process for the preparation of stilbene derivatives<br>
The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the preparation of styryl derivatives. More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a novel process for the preparation of resveratrol and piceatannol, and esters thereof.<br>
Resveratrol as occurring in nature, by systematic name: 3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene, is a known compound which has gained interest because of its biological properties, see, e.g., International patent application WO 01/60774. Piceatannol, also a known compound, is 3,3' 4,5' tetrahydroxystilbene.<br>
Processes for the preparation of resveratrol have been disclosed, inter alia, in WO 01/60774 and Tetrahedron Letters 43 (2002) 597-598. The latter reference describes a process wherein resveratrol is prepared by a multistep reaction sequence starting with 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and involving a Heck reaction of 3,5-dihydroxystyrene with 4-acetoxy-iodobenzene in a yield of 70 %. The process of the present invention utilizes a more readily available starting material and proceeds in less steps and superior yield, thus providing a technically more attractive approach to resveratrol and piceatannol and derivatives, such as esters, thereof.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is concerned with a process for the preparation of resveratrol and piceatannol and esters thereof which comprises reacting a compound of the formula I<br><br>
WO 2005/023740	PCT/EP2004/009669<br><br>
with the compound of the formula II<br><br>
wherein Z and Z  are, independently, protected hydroxy groups; Z is hydrogen or Z ; and one of A and B is vinyl and the other is chloro or bromo; to obtain a compound of the formula III<br><br>
wherein Z and Z1 are as above, and R1 is hydrogen or Z1;<br>
cleaving the hydroxy protecting groups from the compound of the formula III to obtain resveratrol or piceatannol, if desired, converting the so-obtained resveratrol or piceatannol into an ester and, if further desired, isomerizing (E)-resveratrol or ester thereof or (E)-piceatannol or ester thereof to obtain the corresponding (Z)-isomer.<br>
The terms "resveratrol" and "piceatannol"as used herein denote the (E) as well as the (Z) isomer and mixtures thereof. In a preferred aspect, the present invention is concerned with the preparation of the (E) isomers. More preferably, the present invention is concerned with the preparation of (E)-resveratrol.<br>
The protecting groups in the hydroxy groups Z and Z1 may be any cleavable protecting groups. Examples of such protecting groups are electron-withdrawing groups, e.g., acyl groups such as straight or branched alkanoyl groups, especially acetyl, or aroyl groups, e.g., benzoyl; carbonate groups such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl and benzyloxy-carbonyl; as well as carbamate groups, e.g., methylcarbamoyl; and sulfonates, e.g., toluenesulfonate or methansulfonate. Further examples of protecting groups Z and Z1 are<br><br>
WO 2005/023740<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009669<br><br>
non electron-withdrawing groups such as acetal groups e.g., methoxymethylene, ethoxyethylene, methoxymethyl, benzyloxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyi, 1-ethoxyethyl and 1-methoxy-l-methylethyl, or silyl ethers such as trimethylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl. The introduction and cleavage of such protecting groups is well known in the art, see, e.g. T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts (eds.) Protective groups in organic synthesis. 3rd edition, John Wiley 1999.246-287 and citations therein.<br>
The reaction of a compound of the formula I with a compound of the formula II can be carried out under conditions known per se for a Heck reaction. Suitably, about equimolar amounts of the compounds of formulas I and II are used. As a solvent for the reaction, any inert organic solvent can be used, examples of such solvents being organic solvents, e.g. hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethers such as dioxan, nitriles such as acetonitrile, ketones such as acetone, and amides such as dimethyiformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone. Further, the reaction is suitably carried out in the presence of a base which may be an inorganic base, e.g., a carbonate or hydrogencarbonate such as sodium carbonate or hydrogen-carbonate, tert phosphates such as K3PO4, or an organic base, e.g., an amine such as triethyl amine or diisopropyl ethylamine; or an alkali acetate such as sodium acetate. The base is used in an at least equimolar amount, based on the reactant I and II, respectively. Further, according to general conditions for a Heck reaction, a catalyst comprising a Pd source, such as palladium acetate or Pd(dba)2 and a stabilizing ligand e.g. a phosphine such as tri-o-tolylphosphine, or an ammonium salt, such as tetrabutylammonium chloride, are added. Moreover, palladium catalysts and palladacycles e.g. oxime-derived palladadium<br>
complexes or trans-di(|i-acetato)-bis[o-tolylphosphino)benzyl]palladiumll (see e.g. Advanced synthesis and catalysis 344 (2002), 172-183 and Journal of Organometallic chemistry 576 (1999), 23-41) proved to be convenient Pd sources.<br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at normal or elevated pressure and at elevated temperature, e.g. at a temperature up to the boiling point at the appropriate pressure of the solvent used and in an inert atmosphere, e.g. under argon.<br>
The so-obtained compound of the formula III can be converted into resveratrol or an ester thereof by cleaving the protecting group and, if desired, esterification of the hydroxy groups. The cleavage of the protected hydroxy groups Z and Z1 can be accomplished by methods known per se, as cited above. Cleavage of a protected hydroxy group, e.g., an acetoxy group, can be achieved e.g. by basic hydrolysis such as treatment with alcoholic alkali hydroxide at elevated temperature. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the<br><br>
WO 2005/023740	PCT/EP2004/009669<br>
t<br>
protected hydroxy groups are acetoxy groups and are hydrolyzed under substantially neutral conditions. Such hydrolysis of a compound of formula III wherein Z and Z1 or Z, Z1 and R1 are acetoxy, can be effected by treatment with ammonium acetate, e.g., by adding an aqueous solution (up to 60 %) of ammonium acetate to a solution of the compound of formula III in an appropriate solvent, e.g. methanol or ethanol at about room temperature or elevated temperature up to the boiling point, see also Tetrahedron 59 (2003) 1049-1054. After cleavage of the protecting groups, resveratrol and piceatannol, respectively, can be isolated from the reaction mixture by acidification (after basic hydrolysis) and extraction with an organic solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate. If desired, resveratrol and piceatannol can be converted into an ester by esterification with the appropriate acid or a reactive derivative thereof by methods known per se or can be submitted to isomerisation.<br>
Esters of resveratrol and piceatannol, respectively, may be derived from unsubstituted or substituted, straight or branched chain alkyl groups having 1 to 26 carbon atoms or from unsubstituted or substituted, straight or branched chain aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids having 1 to 26 carbon atoms.<br>
While by the process of the invention (E)-resveratrol or (E)-piceatannol is obtained as the sole or substantially the sole reaction product, the (E)-isomer can, if desired, be isomerized to the (Z)-isomer by known methods, see, e.g., Agric. Food Chem. 43; 1995; 1820-1823.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the compound of formula I as used in the above reaction is prepared from a compound of the formula IV<br>
wherein Z is as above. <br>
More particularly, in accordance with that aspect of the invention, a compound of formula<br>
I is prepared by reducing a compound of formula IV to obtain a compound of the formula<br>
V<br><br><br><br>
WO 2005/023740<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009669<br><br>
of formula VI wherein Y is bromo. Treatment of a compound of formula VI with a dehydrohalogenating agent such as LiBr/Li2CO3 produces a compound of formula I. Dehydration of a compound of formula V to yield a compound of formula I may also be achieved by esterifying the hydroxy group with a reactive sulfonic acid derivative such as a mesyl or tosyl halogenide or anhydride to yield a compound of formula VI wherein Y is the sulfonyloxy portion of the sulfonic acid derivative used to esterify the hydroxy group in compound IV. Further, a compound of formula V can be reacted with an alkyl chloroformate, e.g. ethyl chloroformate to yield a compound of formula VI wherein Y is alkyl-O-CO-O-.<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula VI wherein Y is an ester group to a compound of formula I is suitably carried out in an appropriate inert, acid-stable organic solvent, which maybe an apolar solvent e.g., a hydrocarbon such as toluene, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, or a polar solvent, such as an ester, e.g-, ethyl acetate; or an amide, e.g. DMF or NMP or dimethylsulfoxide, at temperatures up to the boiling point of the solvent used. Said conversion may also be carried out in gas phase,<br>
e.g., at temperatures up to 800 °C, if desired, also in a continuous mode. The pyrolytic elimination of a leaving group Y from the compound VI is especially suited in case of Y representing alkyl-OCOO-. It will be appreciated that suitable conditions for the cleavage of a particular leaving group can be readily determined by those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula VI are novel compounds and as such are also an object of the present invention.<br>
Further, the conversion of a compound of formula V to a compound of formula I may be accomplished also directly by treatment of the compound of formula V with inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid or hydrogensulfates, or phosphoric acid; or organic acids such a formic acid, or p-toluene sulfonic acid; or acidic ion exchange resins which maybe used in catalytic amounts or in amounts up to equimolar amounts.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention further.<br>

PCT/EP2004/009669<br><br>
After flushing the solution twice with 3 bar nitrogen the catalyst was removed by filtration over Hyflo Super Cel®. Evaporation of the solvent left 19.2 g of a slightly brown oil, which was further purified by flash-chromatography on silica gel using n-hexane/ ethyl acetate (5:2) as eluent mixture giving 18.4 g of l-(l-hydroxyethyl)-3&gt;5-diacetoxybenzene as a colorless oil (81 mmol, GC 98%).<br>
Example 2<br>
10 g (42 mmol) of l-(l-hydroxyethyl)-3,5-diacetoxybenzene in 80 ml of DMF were placed into a 250 ml 2-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The flask was flushed thoroughly with argon and the mixture was cooled down to 0°C. A solution of 4.06 ml (42 mmol) of phosphorous tribromide in 30 ml CH2CI2 was slowly added and the reaction was allowed to complete within three hours at 0°C. CH2CI2 was evaporated and elimination of hydrogen bromide from the intermediate l-(l-bromoethyI)-3,5-diacetoxybenzene was achieved using 21.38 g (0.24 mol) lithium bromide and 20.74 g lithium carbonate (0.28 mol). The mixture was stirred at 120°C for 18 hours under a slight argon stream, then poured into 150 ml of ethyl acetate and extracted in two portions against 300 ml ice water. The organic layer was washed with brine and saturated NH4CI solution and dried over MgS04 giving 5.18 g (56%) of the desired product, 3,5-diacetoxystyrene, and 3.14 g (42%) of monoacetoxystyrene.<br>

The solvent evaporated in vacuo to give 8.27 g of 3,5-diacetox))-l-(l-methylsulfonyl)-ethylbenzene with a purity of 80.7 % (GC).<br>
Example 13<br>
5 g 3,5-diacetoxy-l-(l-methylsulfonyl)-ethylbenzene are (13.06 mmol) were dissolved in 20 ml toluene and 1.75 ml of diisopropyamine (12.41 mmol, 0.95 eq) were added slowly at room temperature under stirring. The mixture was heated to 180°C for 3.5 hours and after cooling to room temperature the solution was extracted twice against 60 ml saturated ammonium chloride solution. Afterwards, the organic layer was washed with 50 ml water and dried over magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gave 2.9 g of 3,5-diacetoxystyrene (86%) with a purity of 85% (determined by GC).<br>
Example 14<br>
0.57 g (3 mmol) of 3,4-dihydroxy-bromobenzene (synthesized according to Journal of Material Chemistry 10(7), 2000,1519-1526, from commercially available 3,4-dimethoyx-bromobenzene. 0.57 g (3 mmol) were dissolved in 0.31 ml (3.78 mmol) pyridine. 6.6 mmol acetic anhydride were added dropwise to the reaction mixture while stirring. The reaction was carried out at 60°C for three hours. The mixture was diluted with 5 ml of ethyl acetate and extracted once against 5 ml 1N HC1. The organic layer was washed twice with saturated ammonium chloride solution and dried over magnesium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent 0.79 g (2.9 mmol, 97 %) 3,4-diacetoxybromobenzene were obtained with a purity of 99 %.<br>
Example 15<br>
A 10 ml Schlenk tube equipped with magnetic stirrer is charged with 218 mg (0.8 mmol) 3, 4-diacetoxybromobenzene, 176 mg (0.84 mmol) 3,5-diacetoxystyrene, 187 mg potassium carbonate (0.9 mmol) and 0.22 mg (0.1 mol%) of the acetophenon-oxim derived<br><br>
WO 2005/023740	PCT/EP2004/009669<br>
palladium catalyst CAS No. 32679-19-9 as used in Example 9. The tube was evacuated and flushed with argon three times and 1 ml de-aerated DMF was added under inert conditions. The reaction was carried out with stirring for 19 hours at 150°C. Work-up was conducted following the procedure of Example 5 and to give (E)-3, 3', 4'5-tetraacetoxystilbene.<br>
Example 16<br>
2.6 g (17.5 mmol) 2-mercaptopyridine-l-oxid was dissolved in 30.0 ml bromotrichlorornethane and heated to reflux. A mixture of 4.04 g (15 mmol) 3, 5-diacetoxybenzoylchloride and 433 mg (2.5 mmol) 2, 2'-azobisisobutyronitril dissolved in 30.0 ml bromotrichlorornethane were added dropwise at the same temperature. After additional 2 hours of refluxing the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuum. Chromatographic purification over silica gel employing a 9:1 (v/v) mixture of n-hexane and ethyl acetate as eluting agent yielded 2.4 g of 3, 5-diacetoxybromobenzene (8.7 mmol, 58 %).<br>
Example 17<br>
A 10 ml Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 218 mg (0.8 mmol) 3, 5-diacetoxybromobenzene, 136 mg (0.84 mmol) 4-acetoxystyrene, 187 mg potassium carbonate (0.9 mmol) and 0.22 mg (0.1 mol%) of the acetophenon-oxim derived palladium catalyst CAS No. 32679-19-9 as used in Example 9. The tube was evacuated and    flushed with argon three times and 1 ml de-aerated DMF was added under inert<br>
conditions. The reaction was carried out under stirring for 15 hours at 150°C. Work-up was conducted following the procedure of Example 4 and to give (E)-3,4' 5-triacetoxystilbene.<br>
Example 18<br>
2.10 g (6.0 mmol) triacetoxystilbene were dissolved under reflux in 19.3 ml methanol and 39 ml ammonium acetate solution (25 %) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for three hours at the same temperature and afterwards the methanol was distilled off. By cooling to 5 °C the product crystallized and could be filtered off. 1.33 g (5.82 mmol, 97 %) resveratrol were obtained as a pure compound. The mother liquor was purified by extraction with methyl-butyl-ether and neutralized with ammonia. After concentration under reduced pressure the solution was used again for the described reaction.<br><br>
