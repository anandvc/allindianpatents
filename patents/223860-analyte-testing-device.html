				<td>ANALYTE TESTING DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a testing device for testing analytes in samples of bodily<br>
fluid and storing and analysing lifestyle data, which may not be analyte related. A<br>
preferred use of the testing device is for testing the glucose level in the blood of<br>
individuals, including people with diabetes. Lifestyle data may, for example, comprise data<br>
related to the food consumption, exercise level, medication intake or other health related<br>
data of an individual. An example of a use for such a testing device is by physicians, who<br>
routinely need to make an assessment of an individual's lifestyle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucose monitoring is a fact of everyday life for diabetic individuals. The accuracy of<br>
such monitoring can significantly affect the health and ultimately the quality of life of the<br>
person with diabetes. Generally, a diabetic patient measures blood glucose levels several<br>
times a day to monitor and control blood sugar levels. Failure to test blood glucose levels<br>
accurately and on a regular basis can result in serious diabetes-related complications,<br>
including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage and blindness. There are a<br>
number of electronic devices currently available which enable an individual to test the<br>
glucose level in a small sample of blood. One such glucose meter is the OneTouch®<br>
Profile ™ glucose meter, a product which is manufactured by Lifescan.<br>
In addition to glucose monitoring, diabetic individuals often have to maintain tight control<br>
over their lifestyle, so that they are not adversely affected by, for example, irregular food<br>
consumption or exercise. In addition, a physician dealing with a particular diabetic<br>
individual requires detailed information on the lifestyle of the individual to provide<br>
effective treatment or modification of treatment for controlling diabetes. Currently, one of<br>
the ways of monitoring the lifestyle of an individual with diabetes has been for the<br>
individual to keep a paper logbook of their lifestyle. Another way is for an individual to<br>
simply rely on remembering facts about their lifestyle and then relay these details to their<br>
physician on each visit.<br>
The aforementioned methods of recording lifestyle information are inherently difficult,<br>
time consuming and possibly inaccurate. Paper logbooks are not necessarily always<br>
carried by an individual and may not be accurately completed when required. Such paper<br>
logbooks are small and it is therefore difficult to enter detailed information requiring<br>
detailed descriptors of lifestyle events. Furthermore, an individual may often forget key<br>
facts about their lifestyle when questioned by a physician who has to manually review and<br>
interpret information from a hand-written notebook. There is no analysis provided by the<br>
paper logbook to distil or separate the component information. Also, there are no graphical<br>
reductions or summary of the information. Entry of data into a secondary data storage<br>
system, such as a database or other electronic system, requires a laborious transcription of<br>
information, including lifestyle data, into this secondary data storage. Difficulty of data<br>
recordation encourages retrospective entry of pertinent information that results in<br>
inaccurate and incomplete records.<br>
Moreover, a diabetic individual often has to keep a plurality of devices on their person for<br>
diagnosis and treatment, for example both glucose level monitoring equipment and<br>
medication. Hence, having to carry paper records of their lifestyle is an added unwanted<br>
burden and entry of data therein is very time consuming.<br>
There currently exist a number of portable electronic devices that can measure glucose<br>
levels in an individual and store the levels for recalling or uploading to another computer<br>
for analysis. On such device is the Accu-Check™ Complete™ System from Roche<br>
Diagnostics, which provides limited functionality for storing lifestyle data. However, the<br>
Accu-Check™ Complete™ System only permits a limited selection of lifestyle variables to<br>
be stored in a meter. Also, there are only three navigation buttons on the meter, which<br>
makes it difficult to input lifestyle data. There is a no intelligent feedback from values<br>
previously entered into the meter and the user interface is unintuitive for an infrequent user<br>
of the meter.<br>
Therefore, what is required is an electronic device for logging and analysing lifestyle data,<br>
which does not increase the number of devices an individual has to keep on their person<br>
and is also more intuitive and easier to use than other devices, thereby encouraging an<br>
individual to record information related to their lifestyle. Lifestyle data should be taken to<br>
mean any quantifiable information which might affect or represent an individual's physical<br>
condition. Examples of lifestyle data are food consumption, physical exertion (e.g.<br>
exercise), medication intake and health checks performed on the individual.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing and in accordance one aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a testing device for testing an analyte in a sample of bodily fluid, comprising:<br>
memory for storing data, said data being analyte data related to analyte<br>
measurements carried out by the meter and lifestyle data;<br>
initiation means for initiating entry of data related to a specific category of lifestyle<br>
data;<br>
navigation means for entry and navigation of said data; and<br>
transfer means for transferring said data to said memory.<br>
Such a testing device provides simple and effective recordal of both analyte and lifestyle<br>
related data in a single, compact device. Input of lifestyle data can be initiated simply<br>
through use of the initiation means, without having to first perform an analyte<br>
measurement. Of course, it will be appreciated that the testing device could be used to<br>
measure only analyte levels, such as glucose levels for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes,<br>
without the added lifestyle functionality impinging on the usability of the testing device.<br>
Conversely, the testing device could also be used for diagnosis and treatment of diseases<br>
other than diabetes, either independently or in combination with diabetes tracking.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will be described below relative to an illustrative embodiment.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be implemented in a<br>
number of different applications and embodiments and is not specifically limited in its<br>
application to the particular embodiment depicted herein. In particular, the present<br>
invention will be discussed below in connection with sampling blood, although those of<br>
ordinary skill will recognise that the device could be modified to be used with other types<br>
of fluids or analytes besides glucose.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a testing device (100) for testing glucose levels in the<br>
blood of an individual. The testing device (100) externally includes initiation means (102)<br>
for initiating entry of data related to a specific category of lifestyle data, specifically<br>
function-specific buttons (108, 110, 112, 114), and navigation means (104) for entry and<br>
navigation of data, specifically navigation buttons (118, 120, 122). Lifestyle data is any<br>
information which is related to the everyday lifestyle of an individual. In the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 1, lifestyle data is divided into four categories, namely food, medication,<br>
health and exercise categories, which relate respectively to food intake, medication use, the<br>
occurrence of health check-ups and general health condition and exercise levels of an<br>
individual. Further included on the testing device is a liquid crystal display screen (106) for<br>
displaying measured glucose levels and facilitating entry of lifestyle related information<br>
into the testing device (100).<br>
Each category of lifestyle data has an associated function-specific button, operation of<br>
which immediately initiates a sequence for entry of data corresponding to the category of<br>
lifestyle to which the operated function-specific button relates. The categories to which<br>
each of the function-specific buttons (102) relate are shown on the surface of the function-<br>
specific buttons (102) by a graphical representation. The food category is represented on a<br>
food function-specific button (108) by a conventional "knife and fork" icon. There are<br>
similar suitable representations on a medication function-specific button (110), health<br>
function-specific button (112) and an exercise function-specific button (114). In an<br>
alternative embodiment, the function-specific buttons may have tactile icons on their<br>
surfaces, such tactile icons facilitating operation of the testing device by partially sighted<br>
or blind individuals. Operation of one of the function-specific buttons (102) when the<br>
testing device (100) is switched off, immediately switches the testing device on and<br>
initiates a sequence for entry of data.<br>
The function-specific buttons (102) ensure that a user of the testing device (100) does not<br>
need to navigate through a complex and unfamiliar menu system to enter lifestyle data.<br>
Instead, to immediately enter an applicable data entry sequence, a user merely needs to<br>
press one of the function-specific buttons (102). The required function specific-button is<br>
easily determinable from the graphical icon on the button's surface. An information button<br>
(116) is another function-specific button, but it does not relate to a specific category of<br>
lifestyle data. Instead, pressing the information button (116) immediately allows a user to<br>
view and analyse data stored in the testing device (100). Such data may be any data stored<br>
in the testing device (100), for example previously measured glucose levels or entered<br>
lifestyle information.<br>
The navigation buttons (104) comprise an OK button (118), a back button (120) and a<br>
cursor button (122) and facilitate entry and analysis of data stored in the testing device by<br>
enabling a user to navigate through a user interface (250) displayed on the display screen<br>
(106). The cursor button is bi-directional and has an upwards operative section (122a) and<br>
a downwards operative section (122b).<br>
The testing device (100) is switched on by pressing any one of the function-specific<br>
buttons (102) or the back button (120). In addition, the testing device (100) is<br>
automatically switched on when a test-strip is inserted into test-strip port (124) for<br>
measurement of a glucose level in a sample of blood placed on the test-strip. The testing<br>
device (100) can be switched off by holding down the back button (120) for a pre-defined<br>
period of time. The display screen of the testing device (106) includes a backlight, which<br>
can be switched on or off by holding down the OK button (118) for a pre-defined period of<br>
time.<br>
Additionally, there is a communication port (126) on one side of the testing device (100)<br>
which accepts a connector attached to a connecting lead, thereby allowing the testing<br>
device (100) to be linked to an external device such as a personal computer. The personal<br>
computer, running appropriate software, allows entry and modification of set-up<br>
information (e.g. the current time and date and language), as well as being able to perform<br>
other analysis and display functions performed by the testing device (100). In addition, the<br>
personal computer may be able to perform advanced analysis functions or transmit<br>
transferred data to another personal computer, optionally via the Internet, for improved<br>
diagnosis and treatment at a remote location. This way, improved treatment and diagnosis<br>
of diabetes by a medical practitioner is facilitated by being able to link the testing device<br>
(100) with the personal computer.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2a, the internal layout of the testing device (100) is shown. Internally, the<br>
testing device comprises a processor (200), which, in the testing device of Fig. 1, is a 32-<br>
bit RISC microcontroller. The processor is bi-directionally connected via I/O ports (214)<br>
to memory (202), which, in the testing device of Fig. 1, is an EEPROM. Also connected to<br>
the processor (200) via I/O ports (214) are the communication port (126), the navigation<br>
buttons (104), the function-specific buttons (102) and a display screen driver (236). The<br>
communication port (126) is serially connected to the processor (200), thereby enabling<br>
transfer of data between the memory (202) and an external device, such as a personal<br>
computer. The navigation buttons (104) and the function-specific buttons (102) are<br>
directly connected to the processor (200). The processor (200) controls the display screen<br>
(106) via the display screen driver (236).<br>
An Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) (204) implements electronic circuitry<br>
required to facilitate measurement of a glucose level from a sample of blood on a test-strip<br>
inserted into the test-strip port (124). For the purpose of internal crosschecking, analogue<br>
voltages can be supplied to the ASIC (204) and measured from the ASIC (204) by the<br>
processor (200) through an internal A/D converter (216).<br>
The processor (200) further comprises internally: a processor core (208), a ROM (210)<br>
containing computer code, RAM (212) and a clock (218), which provide control circuitry<br>
for components, which are connected externally to the processor (200) to the I/O ports<br>
(214) and the A/D converter (216).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2b, a layer structure of the functional aspects of the testing device (100) is<br>
shown. User interface generation means (252) generates a user interface (250) on the<br>
display screen (106) of the testing device (100). The navigation means (104) (specifically<br>
the navigation buttons (104) in the described embodiment) and the initiation means (102)<br>
(specifically the function-specific buttons (102) in the described embodiment) allow a user<br>
to interact with the user interface (250). Transfer means (258), on instruction from the user<br>
interface generation means (252), transfers data stored in the memory (202) back to the<br>
user interface generation means (252) for display in the user interface (250). Analysis<br>
means (254), under instruction from the user interface generation means (252), performs an<br>
analysis on data stored in the memory (202) and returns results of the analysis to the user<br>
interface generation means (252) for display in the user interface (250). When measured<br>
glucose levels are outside a pre-defined range, prompt means (256) instructs the user<br>
interface generation means (252) to display a message prompting a user of the testing<br>
device (100) to enter lifestyle data following measurement of a glucose level from a<br>
sample of blood on a test strip inserted into the testing device (100).<br>
Fig. 3 shows a generic user interface (250) generated by the user interface generation<br>
means (252) and displayed on the display screen (106). Selectable objects (304) are<br>
displayed in the user interface (250). The user interface generation means (252) adapts the<br>
user interface (250) on operation of the navigation means (104), which in the presently<br>
described embodiment, are the navigation buttons (104).<br>
The selectable objects (304) are highlighted by operating the cursor button (122). The user<br>
interface generation means (252) adapts the user interface (250) such that the selectable<br>
objects (304) are highlighted in turn. In the embodiment shown, the selectable objects<br>
(304) are highlighted by a highlight bar (306), which inverts the contents of a rectangular<br>
area surrounding a highlighted selectable object (308). A title (314) and a graphical icon<br>
(316) related to the most recently operated function-specific button (102) are displayed in<br>
the user interface (250). Both the title (314) and the graphical icon (316) correspond to the<br>
current screen being displayed in the user interface (250). Operation of the cursor button<br>
(122) on its upwards or downwards operative section (122a, 122b) will move the highlight<br>
bar (306) up or down through the selectable objects (304) respectively. However, it will be<br>
readily appreciated that a selectable object (308) could also be considered as highlighted<br>
by being the only selectable object (308) displayed in the user interface (250) at a given<br>
time. In such a case, operation of the cursor button (122) on its upwards or downwards<br>
operative section (122a, 122b) would cause the user interface generation means (252) to<br>
adapt the user interface (250) so that the current highlighted selectable object (308)<br>
becomes hidden and either the previous or next selectable object (312, 310) is displayed.<br>
The highlighted selectable object (308) is selected by activating the OK button (118).<br>
In general navigation of the user interface (250) described herein, operation of the back<br>
button (120), unless otherwise specified, generally causes the user interface generation<br>
means (252) to return the user interface (250) to a previous state of the user interface (250),<br>
prior to the previous operation of the OK button (118), thereby ensuring data stored in the<br>
memory (202) remains unchanged from its state prior to operation of the OK button (118).<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, activation of one of the function-specific buttons (102) relating to a<br>
specific category of lifestyle data starts a lifestyle data entry sequence (400) for the specific<br>
category of lifestyle data. A generalised lifestyle data entry sequence (400) is described<br>
below with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
For each category of lifestyle data, the user interface generation means (252) generates a<br>
user interface (250) to query whether the current lifestyle data being input is for the present<br>
time and date or for another time and date. Two selectable objects (304), namely time<br>
options (402) are displayed in the user interface (250). Option A (402a) shows the current<br>
time and date and option B (402b) displays the message "Other time". Throughout the<br>
lifestyle data entry sequence (400), a title (314) and a graphical icon (316), both<br>
corresponding to the category of lifestyle data selected by operation of one of the function<br>
specific buttons (102), are shown in the user interface (250). Thus, a user of the testing<br>
device (100) can immediately recognise whereabouts in the user interface (250) they are.<br>
Hence, ease of use and navigation of the user interface (250), especially in combination<br>
with operation of the back button (120), is improved.<br>
If option A (402a) is selected, the current date and time is used as time and date<br>
information for storing with lifestyle data entered in the current lifestyle data entry<br>
sequence (400).<br>
If option B (402b) is selected, the user interface generation means (252) starts a date and<br>
time selection sequence to set the time and date information for storing with lifestyle data<br>
entered in the current lifestyle data entry sequence (400). The date and time selection<br>
sequence comprises: the user interface generation means (252) displaying selectable dates<br>
on the display screen (106), selection of a date, the user interface generation means (252)<br>
then displaying selectable times of day on the display screen (106) and selection of a time<br>
of day for entry of lifestyle data.<br>
Following selection of the date and time information, the user interface generation means<br>
(252) modifies the user interface (250) to display selectable objects (304) which are<br>
selectable sub-category options (404) for each category of lifestyle data. The user interface<br>
generation means (252) is responsive to selection of one of the selectable sub-category<br>
options (404), such that a further set of selectable objects, specifically selectable value<br>
options (406), which are appropriate for a selected sub-category option (404a), are<br>
displayed in the user interface (250). It will be appreciated that the selectable value<br>
options (406) can be displayed alongside the selectable sub-category options (404) or in a<br>
separate screen in the user interface (250) entirely.<br>
On selection of a highlighted selectable value option (410), selectable values (408), which<br>
may be numerical or descriptive, can be viewed and selected as described above. The<br>
selectable values (408) are shown either alongside the selectable value options (406), as<br>
shown in Fig. 3, or in a separate screen in the user interface (250). Operation of the back<br>
button (120) allows a user to highlight other selectable value options (406), without a<br>
selectable value being selected for the current selected sub-category option (404a). Once<br>
all desired selectable value options have been selected (i.e. an entire list of selectable value<br>
options has been scrolled through or had values entered), the transfer means (258), which<br>
is responsive to the user interface generation means (252), recognising that the OK button<br>
(118) has been operated, transfers one or more values (408) for the given sub-category of<br>
lifestyle data directly into the memory (202) of the testing device (100). Optionally, there<br>
may be a dedicated "Save" selectable value option (412), selection of which immediately<br>
transfers one or more values (408) for the given sub-category of lifestyle data directly into<br>
the memory (202) of the testing device (100). If one or more values, which are descriptive,<br>
have been entered, then a numerical value acting as a pointer to the descriptive value is<br>
transferred into the memory (202).<br>
One of the sub-category options (404), value options (410) and/or values (408) may<br>
labelled "-------", selection of which skips entry of data for the selected lifestyle category,<br>
sub-category option or value option respectively by inserting a null value into the memory<br>
(202). Thus, there is a common approach for entry and editing of data in different lifestyle<br>
categories, which all have different sub-categories and support different types of data.<br>
Hence, it is easy to learn how to use the testing device (100) for manipulation and viewing<br>
of different types of data.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5a, the generalised lifestyle data entry sequence (400) is now described in<br>
detail specifically in relation to entry of lifestyle data in the food category. Upon operation<br>
of the food function-specific button (108), the time options (402), as described above, are<br>
displayed in the user interface (250). Having selected the time and date, food sub-category<br>
options (514), specifically labelled "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Snack" and "Alcohol"<br>
are displayed in the user interface (250) for selection. One of the food sub-category<br>
options is labelled "-------", selection of which skips entry of data and displays a logbook<br>
(560) in the user interface (250) (see below). On initial display of the food sub-category<br>
options (514), a default food sub-category option (515) is highlighted, the default food sub-<br>
category option (515) being determined by comparing pre-defined meal times with the<br>
current time. Thus, the user interface (250) provides for intelligent interaction between a<br>
given user and the testing device (100)<br>
Selection of one of the food sub-category options (514), corresponding to "Breakfast",<br>
"Lunch", "Dinner" and "Snack" displays selectable food value options (516) in the user<br>
interface (250) labelled "Carbs", "Fats", "Calories" and "Proteins", relating to<br>
carbohydrate, fat, calorific energy and protein intake. Each of the selectable food value<br>
options (516) can be highlighted in turn by operation of the cursor button (122) and<br>
selected by operation of the OK button (118). Food values (518) can be entered for one or<br>
more of the selectable food value options (516) (as described above). Any food values<br>
(518) that are selected and entered are stored in the memory (202) following entry of the<br>
last of the food values (518) (i.e. the food value relating to protein intake).<br>
Selection of the "Alcohol" food sub-category option (517) immediately transfers a pointer<br>
corresponding to a unit of alcohol consumption into the memory (202), without displaying<br>
selectable value options (516) in the user interface (250).<br>
Following entry of lifestyle data for the food category, the logbook (560) (see below) is<br>
displayed in the user interface (250).<br>
Referring to Fig. 5b, the generalised lifestyle data entry sequence (400) is now described in<br>
detail specifically in relation to entry of lifestyle data in the medication category. Upon<br>
operation of the medication function-specific button (110), the time options (402), as<br>
described above, are displayed in the user interface (250). Having entered the time and<br>
date information, medication sub-category options (524), nominally labelled "Pill A", "Pill<br>
B", "Insulin A", "Insulin B", "Pump Bolus" and "Pump Daily Total" are displayed in the<br>
user interface (250) for selection. One of the medication sub-category options (524) is<br>
labelled "Exit Meds Entry", selection of which skips the entry of data and displays the<br>
logbook (560) in the user interface (250) (see below). Some of the aforementioned<br>
medication sub-category options (524) are customisable through a set-up sequence<br>
(described below) and need not necessarily relate to medication which is specifically for<br>
treatment of diabetes.<br>
Selection of one of the medication sub-category options (524) displays one or more<br>
selectable medication value options (526) in the user interface (250). Each of the selectable<br>
medication value options (526) can be selected by operation of the OK button (118) so that<br>
medication values (528) can be highlighted and selected for one or more of the selectable<br>
medication value options (526) corresponding to one of the selected medication sub-<br>
category options (524). Entered medication values (528) are stored in the memory (202)<br>
with a pointer to the selected medication sub-category and the time and date information.<br>
Previously selected medication values (528) are used as default medication values, in that a<br>
previously entered medication value for a given selectable medication value option and a<br>
given time of day (as specified in a set-up sequence of the testing device (see below))<br>
becomes the medication value which is initially highlighted upon selection of a given<br>
selectable medication value option (526). Thus, the user interface (250) provides for<br>
intelligent interaction between a given user and the testing device (100). Additionally, use<br>
of the cursor key (122) is minimised. Accordingly, the general usability of the testing<br>
device (100) is improved.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5c, the generalised lifestyle data entry sequence (400) is now described in<br>
detail specifically in relation to entry of lifestyle data in the health category. Upon<br>
operation of the health function-specific button (112), the time options (402), as described<br>
above, are displayed in the user interface (250). Having selected the time and date<br>
information, health sub-category options (534), specifically labelled "Health Notes" and<br>
"Health Checks" are displayed in the user interface (250) for selection.<br>
Selection of the "Health Notes" health sub-category option (534a), displays in the user<br>
interface (250) additional selectable health values (538) labelled "Stress", "Feel Hypo",<br>
"Illness", "Menses", "Vacation" and "Other". Selection of one of the selectable health<br>
values (538) immediately transfers a corresponding comment with the time and date<br>
information into the memory (202). Following entry of lifestyle data for the "Health<br>
Notes" health sub-category option (534a), the logbook (560) (see below) is displayed in the<br>
user interface (250).<br>
 Selection of the "Health Checks" health sub-category option (534b), displays in the user<br>
interface (250) selectable health value options (536) labelled "Ketones", "HbAlc",<br>
"Microalbumin", "Cholesterol", "Blood pressure", "Eye Exam", "Foot Exam", "Weight /<br>
Height" and "Dr. Visit".<br>
Selection of one of the selectable health value options (536) labelled "Ketones", "HbAlc",<br>
"Microalbumin", "Cholesterol", "Blood pressure" or "Weight / Height" displays one or<br>
more selectable health values (538), thereby permitting entry of one or more appropriate<br>
numerical values, which might be measured analyte levels, blood pressure, weight or<br>
height. Other possible analyte levels could also be measured, such as High Density<br>
Lipoprotein (HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) or triglyceride levels, for which there<br>
would be appropriate selectable health value options (536). Any entered health values<br>
(538) are stored in the memory (202) with the time and date information and a pointer to a<br>
corresponding health value option.<br>
Previously selected health values (538) are used as default health values, in that a<br>
previously entered health value for a given selectable health value option becomes the<br>
health value (538) which is initially highlighted upon selection of a given selectable health<br>
value option (536). Thus, the user interface (250) provides for intelligent interaction<br>
between a user and the testing device (100). Additionally, use of the cursor key (122) is<br>
minimised. Accordingly, the general usability of the testing device (100) is improved.<br>
Selection of one of the selectable health value options (536) labelled "Eye Exam", "Foot<br>
Exam" or "Dr. Visit" causes a confirmation message (539) to be displayed in the user<br>
interface (250), requesting confirmation that a marker for one of these aforementioned<br>
selectable health value options (536) should be input into the memory (202). Further<br>
operation of the OK button (118) immediately stores in the memory (202) a marker for the<br>
selected health value option with the time and date information.<br>
Following entry of lifestyle data for the health category labelled "Health Checks", the<br>
aforementioned health value options (536) for the "Health Checks" health sub-category<br>
(534b) are again displayed in the user interface (250). This way, further health-checkup<br>
related information can be immediately entered, if required.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5d, the generalised lifestyle data entry sequence (400) is now described in<br>
more detail specifically in relation to entry of lifestyle data in the exercise category. Upon<br>
operation of the exercise function-specific button (114), the time options (402), as<br>
described above, are displayed in the user interface (250). Having selected the time and<br>
date, selectable exercise value options (546), specifically labelled "Exercise" and<br>
"Duration" are displayed in the user interface (250) for selection (there are no exercise sub-<br>
category options for entry of lifestyle data in the exercise category).<br>
For the "Exercise" selectable exercise value option (546a), selectable exercise type values<br>
(548a) corresponding to an intensity of exercise can be selected, specifically "Mild",<br>
"Moderate" and "Hard". Additionally there is a selectable exercise value labelled as "------<br>
", selection of which skips the entry of data and displays a logbook (560) in the user<br>
interface (250) (see below). Following selection of one of the selectable exercise duration<br>
values (548a), the "Duration" selectable exercise value option (546b) is highlighted and<br>
selectable exercise duration values (548b) corresponding to a duration of exercise can be<br>
entered. Similarly, there is a numerical value labelled "------", selection of which skips the<br>
entry of data and displays a logbook (560) in the user interface (250) (see below).<br>
Following selection of one of the selectable exercise duration values (548b) by operation<br>
of the OK button (118), the values for the exercise intensity and duration are transferred to<br>
the memory (202).<br>
Following entry of lifestyle data for the exercise category, the logbook (560) (see below) is<br>
displayed in the user interface (250).<br>
Referring to Fig. 6a, the user interface (250) displays menu options (600) upon operation<br>
of the information button (116). The information button (116) is referred to as a<br>
"FastFacts" button and the menu options (600) are collectively referred to as a "FastFacts<br>
Menu".<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6a, the menu options (600) are entitled: "Logbook",<br>
"Glucose by Meals", "Glucose Analysis", "Insulin Intake", "Hypo Info", "Food<br>
Averages", "Health Checks" and "Help".<br>
Selection of the "Logbook" menu option (601) causes a logbook (see below) to be<br>
displayed in the user interface (250).<br>
Selection of the "Glucose by Meals" menu option (602) allows measured glucose levels to<br>
be displayed for each day prior to the current day. The analysis means (254) averages<br>
measured glucose levels stored in the memory (202) and displays on the display screen<br>
(106) for each day in one of the following four time-period categories: (a) before and after<br>
breakfast; (b) before and after lunch; (c) before and after dinner; and (d) night. The time-<br>
periods for the aforementioned categories are pre-defined through a set-up sequence of the<br>
testing device (see below).<br>
Selection of the "Glucose Analysis" menu option (604) causes further menu options to be<br>
displayed relating to the analysis of measured glucose levels. Measured glucose levels<br>
stored in the memory (202) can be displayed graphically (i.e. points plotted on a graph of<br>
date against measured glucose level) or in tabular form. The analysis means (254) receives<br>
measured glucose levels from the memory (202) and passes analytical results to the user<br>
interface generation means (252) for displaying or plotting graphically on the display<br>
screen (106). Measured glucose levels for each day can be displayed or the time of day can<br>
be selected (i.e. before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner,<br>
after dinner or night) such that only measured glucose levels for these particular time<br>
periods of day are plotted on the display screen (106). In addition, values for averages of<br>
all glucose levels stored in the memory (202) can be calculated over a number of different<br>
time periods (e.g. 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days) and all displayed together on the display<br>
screen (106).<br>
A user can easily navigate back for re-selection of the time period by operation of the back<br>
button (120). A longer or shorter time period can then be highlighted by operation of the<br>
cursor button (122) and selected by operation of the OK button (118) to view different<br>
results. Repetition of this procedure can help identify treatment trends or the impact of<br>
changes in treatment or lifestyle and its impact on measured glucose levels over time.<br>
In a similar manner, values for averages of all glucose levels stored in the memory (202)<br>
can be calculated for each time period of a day (as mentioned above) and displayed on the<br>
display screen (106). Moreover, values for averages of all glucose levels stored in the<br>
memory (202) can be calculated over a number of different time periods and displayed for<br>
three exercise periods, specifically "before exercise", "during exercise" and "after<br>
exercise". Another analysis method allows range information to be displayed on the<br>
display screen. Such range information shows the proportions of averaged measured<br>
glucose levels which are above, within or below pre-defined ranges. Such ranges are<br>
determined in a testing device set-up sequence (see below). The range information is<br>
viewed as a percentage either before or after one of four pre-defined meal time-period<br>
categories (i.e. breakfast, lunch, dinner or night).<br>
Selection of the "Insulin Intake" menu option (606) causes further menu options to be<br>
displayed relating to the intake of insulin, data for which has been entered through prior<br>
operation of the medication function-specific button (110). In particular, the intake of<br>
different amounts of different types of insulin specified in a set-up sequence of the testing<br>
device (see below) can be viewed as average amounts over a given time period or as total<br>
amounts on each day prior to the current day. Analysis means (254) processes the stored<br>
insulin data. In addition, the total and average intake of insulin can be viewed on the<br>
display screen (106). Specifying the type of insulin may include specifying whether the<br>
insulin is given through a syringe or pump, or taken as a pill or inhaled.<br>
Selection of the "Hypo Info" menu option (608) allows incidents of the diabetic "hypo"<br>
condition to be viewed. The "hypo" condition is pre-defined in the testing device set-up<br>
sequence (as described below) as a configurable glucose level below which a diabetic<br>
individual is considered as being "hypo". The incidents of the diabetic "hypo" condition<br>
are viewed as the number of incidents which have occurred in a chosen time period for<br>
each of the following times of day: before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after<br>
lunch, before dinner, after dinner and night.<br>
Selection of the "Food Averages" menu option (610), allows averages for previously<br>
entered data stored in the memory (202) relating to food consumption of an individual to<br>
be displayed on the display screen (106). The analysis means (254) processes stored food<br>
related data according to options selected in the user interface (250) through operation of<br>
the navigation buttons (104). Carbohydrate and fat levels, calorific content and protein<br>
intake for each predefined time-period: "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner" and "Snack" can<br>
be averaged by the analysis means (254) over selected time-periods and displayed on the<br>
display screen (106).<br>
Selection of the "Health Checks" menu option (612) allows averages for entered data<br>
stored in the memory (202) relating to health checkups of an individual to be displayed on<br>
the display screen (106). Displayed in the user interface (250) are the selectable health<br>
value options (536) relating to health checkups of an individual, along with the date of the<br>
last checkup and a value measured at the last checkup.<br>
Selection of the "Help" menu option (614) (not shown in Fig. 6a), causes contact<br>
information for help in using the testing device (100) to be displayed on the display screen<br>
(106). For example such contact information may read "Contact LifeScan Customer<br>
Service or visit the Website at www.LifeScan.com".<br>
Referring to Fig. 6b, a logbook (560) is displayed in the user interface (250) following<br>
selection of the "Logbook" menu option (601). Date and time records (650) stored in the<br>
memory (202) are displayed in the user interface (250) with associated data records (652),<br>
such as stored glucose levels and/or lifestyle data. Glucose levels are displayed with<br>
associated glucose comments (654) (see below). Operation of the navigation buttons (104)<br>
allows each data record (652) to be scrolled though in date and time order, with each<br>
record for a particular date and time being highlighted in turn, before the next time and<br>
date and corresponding records are displayed in the user interface (250). Each data record<br>
(652) can be highlighted in turn by the navigation buttons (104) and selected by operation<br>
of the OK button (118). Selection of a glucose data record (656) allows a glucose<br>
comment (see below) to be entered for the selected glucose data record. Selection of a<br>
lifestyle data record (658) displays two options, labelled "Edit" and "Delete", selection of<br>
which allows the selected lifestyle data record to be edited or deleted easily with few<br>
operations of the navigation buttons (104). The sequence for editing of lifestyle data is<br>
similar to the generalised lifestyle data entry sequence (400) described above, except that<br>
previously entered values for the lifestyle data record being edited are pre-selected by the<br>
user from the logbook (560).<br>
Operation of one of the function-specific buttons (102) corresponding to a particular<br>
category of lifestyle data, whilst viewing the logbook (560), allows immediate entry of<br>
lifestyle data using the time and date currently being shown in the user interface (250).<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, a testing sequence (700) for measuring a glucose level (708) of an<br>
individual is shown. A test-strip is inserted into the test-strip port (124), which<br>
immediately turns on the testing device (100). A default code (702) relating to calibration<br>
parameters used with the testing device for a particular type of test-strip is displayed in the<br>
display screen (106). The code (702) can be changed by operation of the cursor button<br>
(122) and selected by operation of the OK button (118). If a particular type of test-strip<br>
has previously been used with the testing device (100) on a pre-defined number of<br>
occasions, then the corresponding code (702) of the test-strip is stored in the memory (202)<br>
and used as a default code (702), which is initially displayed in the display screen (106) of<br>
the testing device (100) following insertion of a test-strip into the test-strip port (124).<br>
Unless the code (702) is changed, as described above, then after a pre-defined time period,<br>
then default code (702) is automatically selected without a user having to operate the OK<br>
key (102). However, following selection of the code (702), operation of the back button<br>
(120) allows a user to reselect the code (702).<br>
Following selection of the code (702), one of a plurality of messages (706) is displayed on<br>
the display screen (106), requesting a blood sample to be applied to the test-strip. At this<br>
stage, operation of the cursor button (122) cycles through three messages (706) on the<br>
display screen (106), specifically "Apply Blood", "Alternate Site" and "Control Solution".<br>
This way, the testing device (100) can recognise for each individual measured glucose<br>
level (708) that a control solution is being applied to the test-strip or that blood is being<br>
taken from an alternate site on an individual. Normally, blood samples would be taken<br>
from the same bodily location on an individual. However, sometimes another location, an<br>
"alternate site", might be used, for example if the one bodily location becomes sensitive or<br>
inconvenient. For example, an alternate site might refer to an upper arm location if a lower<br>
arm location is normally used. If an alternate site for sampling of blood is used, it is<br>
important that this is recognised, particularly when analysis of the measured glucose levels<br>
is being performed at a later stage. Such information could be used in any future general<br>
investigation, using a number of people, into any differences in analyte levels in blood<br>
samples extracted from different locations on the body.<br>
When an appropriate message is displayed on the display screen (106), a solution, blood or<br>
otherwise, can be applied to the test-strip. Measurement of a glucose level in the solution<br>
takes place following application of the solution to the test-strip. The measured glucose<br>
level (708) is displayed in the display screen (106) and stored in the memory (202)<br>
together with the date and time of day and whether the blood sample was taken from an<br>
alternate site on an individual. If the measured glucose level (708) lies outside a pre-<br>
defined target range, then the prompt means (256) instructs the user interface generation<br>
means (252) to display a message (709) in the user interface (250) prompting a user of the<br>
testing device (100) to press the OK button (118), so that lifestyle data in the form of<br>
glucose comments (see below) which are associated with the measured glucose level (708)<br>
can be entered. Two pre-defined target ranges can be specified for each meal time,<br>
specifically for a period before and after each meal time. Thus, by pressing one of the<br>
navigation buttons (104), in this case the OK button (118), lifestyle data can be entered<br>
immediately. This way, when the measured glucose level (708) is outside a pre-defined<br>
target range (as specified in the testing device set-up sequence (see below)) a user is<br>
automatically prompted to enter a glucose comment. Thus, improved diagnosis on out-of-<br>
range glucose levels can made by a physician at a later stage.<br>
If the measured glucose level (708) additionally lies below a pre-defined glucose "Hypo"<br>
level, then a further message is displayed on the display screen (106) querying whether a<br>
user of the testing device (100) should consider having a snack.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, operation of the OK button (118), following measurement of a glucose<br>
level, immediately starts a glucose comment insertion sequence (800). Glucose comments<br>
(654) are descriptive comments which fall into one of a number of glucose comment sub-<br>
categories (802), specifically a food comment sub-category, a health comment sub-<br>
category and an exercise comment sub-category. The glucose comments (654) are stored<br>
in the memory with an associated measured glucose level (708) and are displayed in the<br>
logbook (560). Thus, the status of an individual's food intake, health or exercise level can<br>
be immediately entered at the time of measurement of a glucose level. Additionally, the<br>
glucose comment insertion sequence (800) can be initiated from the logbook (560) by<br>
operation of the OK button (118) when a glucose data record (656) is highlighted in the<br>
user interface (250).<br>
Each of the glucose comment sub-categories (802) can be highlighted in turn by operation<br>
of the cursor button (122) and selected by operation of the OK button (118). For each of<br>
the glucose comment sub-categories (802), there are a number of different glucose<br>
comments (654) which can be highlighted by operation of the cursor button (122) and<br>
selected by operation of the OK button (118). For each of the glucose comment sub-<br>
categories (802), one of the glucose comments (654) can be selected, except for the health<br>
comment sub-category (802b), for which, following insertion of one health glucose<br>
comment, causes the user interface (250) to be adapted such that an additional health<br>
glucose comment can be inserted. This way, up to six health glucose comments can be<br>
selected and stored with the measured glucose level (708) in the memory (202).<br>
For the food glucose comment sub-category (802a), the following food glucose comments<br>
(654a) can be selected and stored in the memory (202): "Bef Brkft", "Aft Brkft", "Bef<br>
Lunch", "Aft Lunch", "Bef Dinner", "Aft Dinner" and "Night", corresponding to before<br>
breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner and night.<br>
For the health glucose comment sub-category (802b), the following health glucose<br>
comments (654b) can be selected and stored in the memory (202): "Stress", "Feel Hypo",<br>
"Illness", "Menses", "Vacation" and "Other", having self-explanatory meanings. For the<br>
exercise glucose comment sub-category (802c), the following exercise glucose comments<br>
(654c) can be selected and stored in the memory (202): "Before", "During" and "After",<br>
having self-explanatory meanings.<br>
Also displayed in the user interface (250) with the glucose comment sub-categories is a<br>
"Save" option (802d), which can be highlighted by operation of the cursor button (122).<br>
Selection of the "Save" option (802d) causes the transfer means (258) to transfer the<br>
measured glucose level (708), with any glucose comments (654) which have been entered,<br>
into the memory (202) with time and date information.<br>
The testing device (100) has a set-up sequence which is initiated when the testing device<br>
(100) is used for the first time or when the OK button (118) and the back button (120) are<br>
operated together. The set-up sequence allows customisation of the operation of the testing<br>
device (100) through the user interface (250). Customisable settings are stored in the<br>
memory (202) for use in data entry, display or analysis. In particular, the following are<br>
examples of customisable settings: the language used in the user interface (250), the<br>
current time and date, the number of doses and types of insulin taken by an individual<br>
using the testing device (100), whether an insulin pump is used by a user using the testing<br>
device (100) and the number and type of different pills taken by an individual using the<br>
testing device. Additionally, the times of day for different meal periods (i.e. before<br>
breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner and night)<br>
can be set. Glucose level ranges which are displayed as horizontal lines on any graphs<br>
displayed by the testing device (100) in the display screen (106) can be specified for<br>
"before" and "after" meal periods. Furthermore, a "Hypo" level can be set, which specifies<br>
a glucose level used to compare against measured glucose levels and generate a warning if<br>
a measured glucose level (708) is below this "Hypo" level.<br>
The prompt means (256) can also immediately generate non-customisable warnings on the<br>
display screen (106) for high measured glucose levels (above 600 mg/dL) and low<br>
measured glucose levels (below 20 mg/dL).<br>
In conclusion, the testing device of the present invention significantly reduces the obstacles<br>
associated with maintaining an accurate record of an individual's lifestyle. The present<br>
invention promotes frequent monitoring for diabetic individuals by providing a simple,<br>
efficient way of recording, not only blood glucose levels, but also other information which<br>
is likely to affect an individual's prognosis. By logging glucose and lifestyle information in<br>
the manner described herein, the testing device provides and effective medication recordal<br>
system. For instance, in the United States the device meets the requirements of the<br>
National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) Health Plan Employer Data and<br>
Information Set (HEDIS®). HEDIS® provides standardised performance measures for<br>
providing individuals with information needed to reliably compare the performance of<br>
managed health care plans.<br>
It will of course be understood that the present invention has been described purely by way<br>
of example only and that modifications of detail can be made within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
