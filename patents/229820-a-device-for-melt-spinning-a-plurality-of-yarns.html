Device for melt spinning a plurality of yarns<br>
The invention relates to a device for melt spinning a plurality of yarns in accordance with the precharacterising clause of Claim 1.<br>
A generic device is known from EP 0 285 736 Al.<br>
In the known device, for melt spinning synthetic yarns, a plurality of spinning jets is arranged in two respective parallel rows next to one another. The spinning jets are connected to a source of melt such that a multifilament yarn is extruded from each of the spinning jets. The spinning jets are arranged within a heated spinning beam. Below the spinning beam there is constructed a cooling device having a double cooling shaft such that a separate cooling shaft is associated with each of the rows of jets. After cooling, the yarns of both rows of jets are guided in a common collecting plane so that they run through one or more treatment stages in a treatment device in the form of a sheet of yarns. After the treatment, the yarns are conventionally wound onto spools in a winding device.<br>
In order to obtain the highest possible productivity when spinning the yarns, the yarn lines in such devices are conventionally monitored for yarn breakage, with the result that the shortest possible interruptions to processing can be achieved. In addition to the purely monitoring function, analyses are moreover desirable in order to find possible causes of yarn breakage. In the known device, however, there is the problem that the yarns extruded from the spinning jets are all guided together in a common collecting plane. Thus, the yarn lines between the spinning<br><br>
jets and the winding device may at any time have different constructions in the treatment device, with the result that there is no way of associating the events detected in connection with the yarn lines with the further analysis.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a device for melt spinning a plurality of yarns of the generic type in which the yarns extruded through the spinning jets of both rows of jets may be identified at any time along their yarn lines until they are wound onto spools.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by a device having the features of the precharacterising clause of Claim 1, in that the yarns of one of the rows of jets (A) and the yarns of the other row of jets (B) are kept' in a predetermined order by at least one guide means in the collecting plane.<br>
So that the events detected for each yarn line during manufacture of the synthetic yarns, such as yarn breakage, can be associated with one of the rows of spinning jets or one of the spinning jets of the rows of spinning jets, in accordance with the invention the yarns in the collecting plane are kept in a predetermined order by a guide means. Thus, a particular position is associated with each of the yarns within the sheet of yarns. As long as the sheet of yarns is guided together- through the individual treatment stages of the treatment device, each yarn can be associated at any time with the respective spinning jets, on the basis of its position.<br><br>
In accordance with advantageous further developments, orders may for example be formed in which the sheet of yarns of one of the rows of jets may be guided into the collecting plane next to the sheet of yarns of the adjacent row of jets. In this arrangement, the partial sheets of yarns may be guided out of the collecting plane together by a take-off godet or separately by two take-off godets. For this purpose, the guide means advantageously has two groups of yarn guides which are associated with the partial sheets of yarns. The yarn guides could be held by the guide means in a common guide plane or indeed in two adjacent guide planes.<br>
However, it is also possible to guide the yarns of the two rows of jets next to one another, alternately, in the collecting plane. Different variants on the orders can in principle be maintained.<br>
When a plurality of yarns is manufactured from two parallel rows of jets, particular care must be taken that the yarn guidance and in particular the deflection of the yarns are kept the same as far as possible in all the yarns of the sheet of yarns, since otherwise differences in tension and hence differences in quality may occur. In a particularly advantageous further development of the invention, the collecting plane is therefore constructed in the centre of the parallel rows of jets. The yarns of both rows of jets are deflected to the same extent for guidance into the collecting plane.<br>
Because of the plurality of yarns within a spinning station, the winding device for each spinning station is preferably formed by a spooling frame having two winding<br><br>
units or by respective spooling frames each having a winding unit. This means that compact winding units suitable for high spooling speeds can be formed.<br>
In order to wind the sheet of yarns of a row of jets onto spools as far as possible simultaneously, it is further proposed that the sheet of yarns taken off after treatment is divided over the winding units such that the yarns of the one row of jets and the yams of the other row of jets are wound onto spools in a predetermined association. In this arrangement, the association is preferably selected such that the yarns of one of the rows of jets are all wound onto a spool spindle of one of the winding units.<br>
In order to make the separation between the rows of jets as narrow as possible, the further development of the invention in which the cooling device has at least one double cooling shaft which contains a separate cooling shaft for each row of jets and a central pressure chamber between the cooling shafts is particularly advantageous. In this arrangement, the central pressure chamber formed in the double cooling shaft is provided with blowing air by way of an air duct arranged laterally next to the machine longitudinal side, in order to supply the cooling shafts. The air duct may be connected to the pressure chamber of the double cooling shaft by way of transverse attachment pieces.<br>
So that the sheets of yarns associated with the rows of jets can run securely and very smoothly into the collecting plane, both cooling shafts of the double cooling shaft open into a common downward shaft.<br><br>
In this arrangement, advantageously cohesion of the yarns is achieved in the individual yarns of the two sheets of yarns by two separate lubricating devices even before they enter the collecting plane.<br>
Another preferred further development of the invention is characterised in particular in that the spinning jets are divided into groups by the formation' of a plurality of longitudinal modules, with each group being kept the same as regards the arrangement of its spinning jets and the temperature control of the spinning jets. The passage formed between the longitudinal modules results in each longitudinal module being capable of operation from both longitudinal sides of the machine. This means that short piecing times can in particular be achieved at the beginning of processing or after an interruption to processing, since an operative can supply the spinning jets of both rows of jets of a longitudinal module.<br>
The spinning jets of the longitudinal modules are advantageously divided into a plurality of spinning stations, with a respective double cooling shaft of the cooling device being associated with each of the spinning stations and having a cooling shaft for each row of jets. This means that intensive cooling can be provided for the freshly extruded multifilament yarns. A spinning station can in this case have up to twelve, sixteen or twenty spinning jets in two rows of jets, with for example four spinning stations being capable of forming a longitudinal module.<br>
The further development of the invention in which the longitudinal modules are each formed by a box-shaped jet<br><br>
carrier which is heated by a heat transfer medium and is supplied with a heat transfer medium at the end facing the passage by way of an inlet and an outlet is particularly advantageous for uniform temperature control of the spinning jets within the longitudinal module. Moreover, a heat transfer medium circuit aligned in the longitudinal direction can be produced in a simple manner if the box-shaped jet carrier is provided with a slight incline aligned with the longitudinal side of the machine. There is a further advantage in the fact that the free spaces formed by the passages inside the device are advantageously Usable for supply lines and power units.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below by way of an example embodiment of a device according to the invention for melt spinning a plurality of yarns, with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Fig, 1 to Fig. 3 show diagrammatically a plurality of views of an example embodiment of the device according to the . invention, having a plurality of spinning stations;<br>
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show diagrammatically an example embodiment of a guide means for dividing the yarns in the collecting plane;<br>
Fig. 6 shows diagrammatically a further example embodiment of a guide means for distributing the yarns in the collecting plane;<br>
Fig. 7 shows diagrammatically an example embodiment of the winding device of the device from Fig. 1; and<br><br>
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show diagrammatically further example embodiments for guiding and treating a sheet of yarns.<br>
In Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, an example embodiment of the device according- to. the invention, having a plurality of spinning stations for melt spinning a plurality of yarns, is illustrated in different views. Here, Fig. 1 shows a view of a machine longitudinal side of the overall device, Fig. 2 shows a detail of the overall device from Fig. 1, having two spinning stations, and Fig. 3 shows a view of a spinning station transverse to the machine longitudinal side. The description below applies to all the figures, except where reference is made expressly to one of the figures.<br>
The device is held by a multiple-level machine frame 1 which is merely indicated as a lateral support in Figures 1, 2   and 3. A plurality of longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are arranged next to one another along the machine longitudinal side in an upper level of the machine frame 1. The longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 each contain a plurality of spinning jets 4 which are arranged in two parallel rows of jets A and B.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 arranged along the machine longitudinal side are in each case separated from one another by a passage D. The passage D between the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 in this case extends over all the levels of the machine frame 1.<br>
The longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are each formed by a box-shaped jet carrier 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. Inside the<br><br>
box-shaped j et carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 are arranged the spinning jets 4 associated with the longitudinal module, the distributor pumps 5 connected to the spinning jets 4 and further melt distributing devices not illustrated here. To heat the components guiding the melt, the jet carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 are each attached to a heat transfer medium circuit. For this purpose, an inlet 11 and an outlet 12 are arranged at the end faces 33 of the jet carriers 8.1, 8.2  and 8.3. The outlet 12 is in each case constructed in the lower region of the jet carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, with the jet carriers held is a- slightly inclined arrangement so that the heat transfer medium occurring as condensate can be guided away in a simple manner. The supply lines of the  inlet 11 and the outlet 12 are advantageously constructed in the region of the passages D.<br>
The devices arranged above the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 for melt production and melt distribution are not illustrated. For example, the components guiding the melt of a plurality of longitudinal modules may be supplied from one extruder.<br>
Each of the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 is divided into a plurality of spinning stations. The design and construction of the spinning stations is explained in more detail below by way of the longitudinal module 2.1, with reference to Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
Each of the spinning stations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 includes a total of twelve spinning jets 4 which are divided evenly over the two rows of jets A and B. The spinning jets of the rows of jets A and B are connected to<br><br>
a respective - distributor pump 5. Each of the distributor pumps 5 has a drive shaft 6 coupled to a drive (not illustrated here). A polymer melt is supplied to the distributor pumps 5 by way of a respective melt connection point 7.<br>
In the example embodiment illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the spinning jets of a spinning station are fed from two separate distributor pumps. However, it is also possible, for example with an overall number of six or eight spinning jets in two rows of jets, to supply all the spinning jets from one distributor pump. Here, it should be expressly pointed out that the number of spinning jets for each spinning station is given by way of example.<br>
Below the jet carriers 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 there is arranged a cooling device 13. The cooling device 13 has in each case a double cooling shaft 14 for each spinning station. Thus, the double cooling shafts 14.1, 14.2, 14.3 and 14.4 are associated with the spinning stations 3.1 to 3.4 of the first longitudinal module 2.1.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, each of the double cooling shafts 14.1 to 14.4 is formed by two separate cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2 which are associated with the spinning jets 4 of the row of jets A and the row of jets B. The double cooling shafts 14.1 to 14.4 have between the cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2 a respective pressure chamber 16. Between the cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2 and the pressure chamber 16 there are formed the blowing walls 17.1 and 17.2, with the result that a stream of transversely directed cooling air is generated in the cooling shafts 15.1 and 15.2. The pressure chambers 16 of the double<br><br>
cooling shafts 14.1  to 14.4 are attached to a central air duct 20 in the lower region by way of an air connection point 18 and a transverse attachment piece 19. The air duct 20 extends laterally parallel to the machine longitudinal side and supplies all the double cooling shafts of the cooling device 13. The transverse attachment pieces 19 connected to the air duct 2 0 are arranged in the lower region of the cooling device 13 between the spinning stations. The lower region of the cooling device 13 is in each case formed by a downward shaft, and these are labelled by the reference numerals 34.1, 34.2, 34.3 and 34,4 for the first longitudinal module 2.1. The downward shafts 34.1 to 34.4 in this arrangement have a downwardly tapering shape, so that the free spaces produced between the spinning stations are used to receive the transverse attachment pieces 19, The fact that the blown air is supplied laterally has the particular advantage that the rows of spinning jets A and B can be arranged with as narrow a separation from one another as possible. This means that an air supply through the centre plane extending between the rows of jets A and B can be dispensed with.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 3, in the lower region of the double cooling shaft 14.1 a respective lubricating device 23.1 and 23.2 are associated with each cooling shaft 15.1 and 15.2. In this arrangement, the lubricating device 23,1 is associated with the spinning jets 4 of the rows of jets A, with the result that at the end of cooling the extruded multifilament yarns 9 of the row of jets A are coated with a lubricant by the lubricating device 23.1. Accordingly, the yarns 10 extruded from the spinning jets of the row of jets B are lubricated by the lubricating device 23.2. After lubrication, the yarns 9 and 10 are guided together in a<br><br>
common collecting plane 35 to form a sheet of yarns 22. For this purpose, a guide means 21 is arranged on the outlet side of the downward shaft 34.1. In this arrangement, a predetermined order of the yarns is maintained within the sheet of yarns 22 by the guide means 21. The distribution of the yarns 9 and 10 in the sheet of yarns 22 will be explained in more detail below.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, a treatment device 24 is arranged below the cooling device 13. The treatment device 24 has a plurality of treatment modules 36, with one of the treatment modules 3 6 being associated with each spinning station. Taking the example of the first longitudinal module 2.1, the treatment" modules 36.1 to 36.4 are associated with the spinning stations 3.1 to 3.4. The treatment modules are equipped with devices such as godets, godet units, intermingling devices, yarn cutters, heating devices, lubricating devices and so on, depending on the type of yarn to be produced. In the example embodiment illustrated, by way of illustrative example two godets 25.1 and 2 5.2 are shown.<br>
Within the treatment device, the collecting plane 35 in which the sheet of yarns 22 is guided is turned through 90° at the transition from the guide means 21 to the point at which it runs onto the first godet 25.1. This means that the yarns on the godet 25.1 are guided in a plane which is directed substantially transversely to the longitudinal direction of the machine.<br>
Below the treatment device 24 there is arranged the winding device 26, which comprises a plurality of winding units. Thus, associated with each spinning station there are in<br><br>
each case two winding units 27.1 and 27.2. The winding units 27.1 and 27.2 may in this arrangement take the form of a spooling frame or the form of two spooling frames set up next to one another. In the example embodiment illustrated, the winding units 27.1 and 27.2 are constructed on in each case synchronously driven spooling frames 37.1 and 37.2. The winding device 26 is thus formed from a plurality of spooling frames 37. In each of the winding units 27.1 and 27.2, the yarns of the sheet of yarns 22 are wound onto a respective spool 32..The spools 32 are tensioned on a spool spindle 2 9.1 for this purpose. The spool spindle 29.1 is held in each winding unit 27.1 and 27.2 by a respective spooling revolver 28. The spooling revolver 2 8 carries a spool spindle 2 9.2 arranged offset by 180°. By rotating the spooling revolver, the yarns of the sheet of yarns 22 can thus be wound continuously onto spools. A contact pressure roller 3 0 bears against the periphery of the spools 32. A traversing device arranged upstream of the contact pressure roller, for guiding the yarns to and fro in order to form cross-wound bobbins, is not illustrated in more detail here.<br>
Before the point where the sheet of yarns 22 enters the winding units 27,1 and 27.2, a respective double guide rail 31 is provided for each spinning station to divide the yarns of the sheet of yarns 22. In this arrangement, an association established at the rows of spinning jets A and B or at the spinning jets of the rows of jets A and B is maintained by the double guide rail 31. Further explanations about the division of the sheet of yarns and the selected association will be given below.<br><br>
In the device illustrated in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, the cooling device 13, the treatment device 24 and the winding device 2 6 for each of the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are identical in construction. In operation, a polymer melt, for example based on polyester, is produced by one or more melt sources. The polymer melt is guided to the distributor  pumps 5 of the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 by way of a distribution system (not described in more detail). The polymer melt is conveyed to the associated spinning jets 4 at positive pressure through the distributor pumps. -Each of the spinning jets 4 has on its underside a plurality of jet bores through which a bundle of fine filaments is extruded for each yarn. Thus, each of the spinning jets of the device produces a multifilament yarn. The yarns spun within a spinning station for each row of jets are then cooled in the double cooling shaft provided for each spinning station and, after cooling, brought together with the yarns of the adjacent row of jets to form a common sheet of yarns 22. Before they are brought together, the yarns 9 of the row of jets A and the yarns 10 of the row of jets B are wetted with a fluid by the associated lubricating devices 23.1 and 23.2 and then brought together by the guide means 21 for each spinning station to form the sheet of yarns 22. The yarns of the sheet of yarns are guided parallel to one another at a small spacing through a respective treatment module 3 6 and then, after treatment, wound onto spools by two winding units.<br>
In devices of this kind, on the one hand regular maintenance of the spinning jets and on the other hand the piecing of freshly spun yarns after an interruption to processing or at the start of processing have to be<br><br>
performed by an operative. As a result of providing the spinning jets, it becomes possible for an operative to change between the longitudinal sides of the machine quickly and simply. As indicated in Fig. 3, an operative at the middle level can rapidly operate the longitudinal modules 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 from both longitudinal sides of the machine. For this purpose, it is possible to change longitudinal sides through the passage D between the longitudinal modules. Because of the short distance between the longitudinal sides, very short interruptions to processing are achieved even after yarn breakage at one of the spinning stations.<br>
A further advantage of the device can be seen in the fact that supply lines and additional units such as lubricant conveying devices can advantageously be integrated within the passage D between adjacent longitudinal modules. This allows a very compact, space-saving device to be provided. For example, a second line of longitudinal modules could be arranged directly next to the device illustrated in Fig. 1. In this way, whole buildings can advantageously be equipped with longitudinal modules of this kind, arranged in rows and taking up. 30 to 40% less space than conventional devices.<br>
For the monitoring of such devices, conventionally each of the yarns is monitored along its yarn line. In case there is a yarn breakage, sensor means are provided which supply appropriate signals to a control device. Monitoring devices of this kind are particularly important to enable high-quality yarns to be manufactured in the whole device. However, monitoring of this kind, and analysis of the event occurring within a yarn line, make it necessary to know<br><br>
which spinning station or which spinning jet produced the yarn. It is hence necessary to maintain a predetermined order as the yarns are guided together out of the two rows of jets so that the entire yarn line can be retraced from the winding unit to the spinning jet.<br>
To this end,. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show diagrammatically an example embodiment of a guide means for guiding the yarns of both rows of jets within a spinning station, such as could be used in the example embodiment of the device according to the invention from Fig. 1. The division and the spinning station could for example take the form of the spinning station labelled with the reference numeral 3.1 in Fig. 2. Here,  Fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a view of the spinning station up until the formation of a sheet of yarns 22, and Fig. 5 shows diagrammatically a cross-sectional view of the spinning station. Where no express reference is made to one of the figures, the description below applies to both figures.<br>
A total of twelve spinning jets are divided evenly over two rows of jets A and B on the jet carrier 8.1 (illustrated in part). Accordingly, six yarns are produced from the spinning jets 4 of the row of jets A; these are labelled with the reference numeral 9. The yarns 10 of the row of jets B are accordingly extruded through the spinning jets of the row of jets B. The yarns 9 and 10 are guided in parallel inside the cooling shafts (not illustrated here) to the lubricating devices 23.1 and 23.2. In this arrangement, the lubricating devices 23.1 and 2 3.2 are in the form of lubricating rollers. The lubricating devices may, however, also be formed by individual lubricating pins which each wet one yarn.<br><br>
Once the yarns 9 and 10 have been wetted, they are guided in a common collecting plane 35. In the collecting plane 35, the guide means 21 arranges the yarns 9 and 10 into a sheet of yarns 22 in which the twelve yarns arranged next to one another have a predetermined order. In the example embodiment illustrated in Fig. 4, the yarns 10 of the row of jets B and the yarns 9 of the row of jets A are each guided next to one another as a partial sheet of yarns. The guide means 21, which is arranged below the downward shaft, is formed by a yarn guide rail having two groups of yarn guides 38. The yarn guides 38 of one of the groups are associated with the  yarns 9 of the row of jets A and the yarn guides 3 8 of the other group are associated with the yarns 10 of the row of jets B.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the collecting plane 35 is arranged in the central region between the spinning jets of the row of jets A and the row of jets B. This means that uniform deflection of the yarns is achieved in both rows of jets. Thus, yarns having the same physical properties may also advantageously be produced.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a further example embodiment of a guide means for dividing the yarns in the sheet of yarns, such as could be used in the example embodiment of the device according to the invention from Fig. 1. The example embodiment from Fig. 5 is identical to the example embodiment from Fig. 4, so only the differences will be explained at this point. When the yarns 9 of the row of jets A and the yarns 10 of the row of jets B are divided, the guide means 21 is used to determine by means of separate yarn guides 3 8 an order within the sheet of yarns<br><br>
22 which alternately guides a yarn 9 of the row of jets A and a yarn 10 of the row of jets B next to one another. This produces an order AB AB AB in accordance with the rows of jets. The transition of the sheet of yarns 22 to the treatment device is thus defined such that the provenance of the yarns is known at each point and at each moment within the treatment.<br>
When synthetic yarns are manufactured, the yarn quality is very highly determined by the respective winding procedure. Thus, particular associations between the spinning jets and the winding stations may be advantageous to produce uniform yarn qualities. Fig. 6 indicates, by way of an example embodiment of a winding unit such as could be used for example in the device illustrated in Fig. 1, how the yarns of the sheet of yarns are divided after treatment among the individual winding units.<br>
The winding units 27.1 and 27.2 are in this case constructed within a spooling frame. The spooling frame has two spooling revolvers 28.1 and 28.2. Each of the spooling revolvers carries two spool spindles 2 9.1 and 2 9.2. Associated with the spooling revolvers 28.1 and 28.2 is in each case a contact pressure roller 30.1 and 30.2. Above the contact pressure rollers 3 0.1 and 3 0.2 there is provided a double guide rail 31 which has on both longitudinal sides a respective yarn guide parallel to the spool spindles for each winding station. Double winders of this kind are known per se and are described for example in DE 100 45 473 Al. The reader is thus referred to this printed citation for a further description of the spooling frame.<br><br>
After treatment, the sheet of yarns 22 is divided by the double guide rail 31 in accordance with a predetermined association among the individual winding units 27.1 and 27.-2. In this arrangement, the yarns 9 of the row of jets A and the yarns 10 of the row of jets B are separated out of the sheet of yarns 22 and supplied respectively to the winding units 27.1 and 27.2. Thus, the yarns 9 of the row of jets A are wound onto the spool spindle 29.1 of the winding unit 2 7.1, and the yarns 10 of the row of jets B are wound onto the spool spindle 29.2 of the winding unit 27.2 to form bobbins. Each of the yarns within the sheet of yarns 22 is thus identifiable at any point between the spinning jets and the winding device. It is thus possible to perform monitoring and control of the device using simple means.<br>
The device illustrated in Fig. 1 is given by way of example as regards the construction of its treatment device and the winding device. For example, all the yarns of a spinning station could be taken up together by a spooling frame having a single winding unit. The construction of the treatment device is substantially dependent on whether fully drawn yarns (FDY), pre-oriented yarns (POY), highly oriented yarns (HOY) or crimped fibres (BCF) are being manufactured. The treatment device may optionally be fitted with units for this.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 show further example embodiments of treatment modules such as could be used in the spinning unit shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In the example embodiment illustrated in Fig. 8, the treatment module of a spinning station is formed by two<br><br>
godet units having a total to tour godets. A first godet unit having the godets 25.1 and 25.2 is associated with a partial sheet of yarns having the yarns 9 of the row of jets A. The second godet unit, arranged in mirror symmetry with respect to the first godet unit and having the godets 25.3 and 25.4, is associated with the partial sheet of yarns having the yarns 10 of the row of jets B. The partial sheets of yarns are guided by a double guide rail 31. However, guidance directly by a guide means in the collecting plane would also be possible. For this purpose, two groups of yarn guides could be held on both sides of a guide rail so that the partial sheets of yarns were separated at the same time as they are fed out of the spinning device.<br>
Associated with the godets 25.1 and 25.2 is a winding unit 27.1, and associated with the godets 25.3 and 25.4 is a second winding unit 2 7.2. The winding units 27.1 and 27.2 may in this case be formed by a spooling frame 3 7 as . illustrated or by two separate spooling frames. In this example embodiment, the spooling frame 37 is substantially identical to the previous example embodiment from Fig. 7. In contrast to the example embodiment from Fig. 7, in this case the two winding units 27.1 and 27.2 are arranged symmetrically next to one another so that the spooling revolvers 28.1 and 28.2 are drivable in the same direction of rotation for winding the spools 32.<br>
The example embodiment illustrated in Fig. 8 shows an arrangement of the treatment device in which the yarns may be guided at the smallest possible angles of deflection on being drawn out of the spinning device. The godet units and<br><br>
the winding units are preferably driven synchronously. In this case, double units may advantageously also be used.<br>
In the example embodiment illustrated in Fig. 9, the treatment module is formed by two godet units arranged symmetrically next to one another. The first godet unit, having the godets 25.1 and 25.2, is associated with the partial sheet of yarns having the yarns 9 of the row of jets A and the second godet unit, having the godets 25.3 and 25.4, is associated with the partial sheet of yarns having the yarns 10 of the row of jets B. In this arrangement, the guide means 21 is arranged directly upstream of the godet units and is formed by a guide rail having two groups of yarn guides 38. In this arrangement, the groups of yarn guides 3 8 are arranged in the collecting plane such that the partial sheets of yarns are separated at the same time.<br>
9<br>
In order to wind spools, the yarns 9 and 10 could be taken up by a spooling frame in accordance with the example embodiment from Fig. 7 or in accordance with the example embodiment from Fig. 8.<br>
To make the yarn deflections as small as possible, it is possible for the godet unit having the godets 25.1 and 2 5.2 and the godet unit having the godets 25.3 and 25.4 to be arranged in planes offset from one another. In this arrangement, the amount of the offset between the godet units may be selected such that once the partial sheets of yarns are separated, the yarns may be guided to the downstream godets 25.1 and 25.3 without spatial deflection.<br><br>
The treatment devices illustrated in the above-mentioned example embodiments are given by way of example as regards the design and construction of the individual units. In principle, a pair of godets may also be used to guide the yarns with multiple wrapping and with intermingling devices upstream of, between or downstream of the godets. Moreover, the treatment devices may advantageously be combined with aids such as yarn cutters, yarn suction removal equipment and monitoring sensors.<br><br>
