				<td>INDUCTION FURNACE WITH IMPROVED EFFICIENCY COIL SYSTEM<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/260,241, filedJanuaiy 8, 2001.<br>
The present invention relates generally to electric induction furnaces and more particularly to induction furnaces having improved efficiency coil systems.<br>
Electric induction furnaces are used to heat and melt metals and other electrically conductive materials. An induction furnace utilizes an induction coil that is powered from an ac power source. Alternating current flowing through the coil creates a magnetic field that is applied to the electrically conductive charge placed inside of the furnace's crucible. Eddy currents induced by the field in the charge can be used to heat, melt and superheat the charge. The magnetic coupling between the induction coil and charge is analogous to a magnetic transformer coupling. However an induction coil has a much higher leakage inductance than the leakage inductance of a magnetic transformer. Consequently an induction furnace's power factor is extremely low, typically ranging from 0.08 to 0.15, lagging and, therefore, an extremely inefficient load.<br>
The conventional coreless induction furnace consists of a copper water-cooled helical coil with a ceramic crucible containing the charge. Alternating current in the coil generates a magnetic field that induces current into the conductive charge. As illustrated in FIG. l(a), the induction furnace 1OO can be viewed as a loosely coupled transformer where the turns of the primary coil are magnetically coupled to a single turn formed by the conductive melt 102. In the figure, Ic represents the coil current and Im represents the current in the molten bath. Therefore, it can be assumed that the ratio of the current induced into the melt to the current in the coil approximates the number of coil turns.  Maximum<br><br>
current density is induced on the circumference of the melt, with current exponentially decaying into the melt depth towards the center of the crucible.<br>
The rate of decay is defined by a constant, namely the depth of current penetration into the metal, Am, as defined (in meters) by the following equation:<br><br><br><br><br>
where Dm ~ resistivity of the molten metal (in ohms/m);<br>
Ho • Hm = the product of absolute and relative permeability (with jio = 4« x 10-7 and Hm, the relative permeability of the metal, in H/m); and<br>
/«• the frequency of the coil current (in Hertz).<br>
Induction furnaces are usually designed to satisfy the condition that the depth of current penetration into the metal is much less than the radius of the melt (Am « rm).<br>
The conventional shape of the melt is cylindrical. Most of the induced current is flowing in the outer layer of the melt with thickness equal to the depth of penetration, Am. The resistance, Rm, (in ohms) of this layer can be estimated by the following equation:<br><br><br>
=0.0125<br><br>
where<br>
Rm = resistance of the melt (in ohms);<br>
rm = radius of the melt;<br>
hm = height of the melt;<br>
pm, Am and f are as previously defined.<br><br>
Induction furnaces are principally single-phase devices. The supplied electric power is typically distributed over balanced three-phase lines. For optimal operation, induction furnaces operate at frequencies typically in the range of 100 to 10,000 Hertz. These frequencies are needed to maintain an optimal Am/rm ratio for electromagnetic stirring of molten metal in the furnace.<br>
Solid state power converters generate the power at required frequency, voltage and current for induction furnaces. These converters utilize power semiconductors (such as SCR, IGBT or IGCT topologies). The solid state static power converter resolves the phase balancing problem. Input 3-, 6-, or 12-phase line voltages are rectified before being inverted into a single-phase medium-frequency electrical current. Full-wave rectification of multi-phase line voltage produces a low harmonic distortion on feeding electrical lines, thus eliminating the need for line filters. As illustrated in PIG. l(b), the power converter consists of three major sections:<br>
an ac to dc rectifier and dc filter;<br>
a dc to ac medium-frequency inverter; and<br>
a bank of tuning capacitors.<br>
Power supplied to the furnace is controlled automatically by varying the commutation timing of the inverter's solid state switching components. This timing determines the operating frequency, phase and amplitude of the furnace current.<br>
There are two conventional implementations of static solid-state power converters, namely a current-fed inverter with a parallel capacitor bank and a voltage-fed inverter with series capacitor bank. FIG. 2(a) illustrates a furnace system utilizing a current-fed converter. PIG. 2(b) illustrates a furnace system utilizing a current-fed converter with series/parallel tank capacitors. FIG.2(c) and FIG. 2(d) illustrate furnace systems utilizing a voltage-fed converter in full bridge and half configurations, respectively. Each of these power supply topologies<br><br>
comprises a rectifier and filter section 11O; a solid state inverter section 12O; and a tuning capacitor section 130. While the generally recognized symbol for an SCR is used in these set of figures, other solid state switching devices can be utilized in these applications.<br>
In the current-fed inverter, as illustrated in FIG. 2(a), the power factor correction capacitor bank is usually connected in parallel to the furnace coil. The term "capacitor bank" is used here to designate one or more capacitors connected in series or parallel to be the equivalent circuit as shown in the figures. Both the capacitor bank and the coil are connected into the diagonal of a full-bridge inverter. This connection allows the reactive component of the coil current to bypass the inverter's solid state switching components. However, the inverter is exposed to the full furnace voltage. The values of inverter voltage may be higher or lower than the dc voltage on the rectifier. Therefore, dc rectifier and inverter sections must be decoupled by reactors. The reactors supply the inverter with constant dc current. They are acting as a filter and reservoir of energy. The inverter converts dc current into square wave current that is supplied to a parallel resonant circuit.<br>
The furnace power in current-fed inverter systems is controlled by varying both inverter timing and dc voltage. When inverter voltage falls below dc rectifier potential, the output power cannot be controlled by variation in inverter commutation frequency alone. Additional control of the injected dc current is carried out by regulating the conduction phase angle of the rectifier SCRs. Such regulation will introduce distortion into the feeding electrical line unless filters are provided.<br>
The main advantage of the parallel resonant inverter is that only part of the coil current is passed via solid state switching devices, thus saving the number of semiconductor devices. The inverter controls only part of the coil current. This, however, limits the controllability of the inverter. Using the smoothing dc reactors as temporary energy accumulators causes difficulties in starting the inverters. The energy in the reactors is kinetic<br><br>
(analogous to the energy of a flywheel) — it exists only when the dc current flows from the rectifier to the inverter. To accumulate the necessary energy in the smoothing dc reactor, a special starter network is used. When the parallel inverter is stopped, the energy from this reactor is expended using the solid state switches of the inverter as a crow bar circuit.<br>
The advantage of lower current in the inverter solid state switching devices is offset by a high voltage to which these devices are exposed. This often requires stacking the devices in series, which in turn necessitates special dynamic voltage dividers. For small current-fed inverters connected to standard low voltage lines, a series/parallel connection of capacitors is used, as illustrated in FIG. 2(b), rather than a parallel resonant circuit.<br>
From the standpoint of electric circuit theory, voltage-fed series resonant inverters, as illustrated in PIG. 2(c), represent a duality circuit to the current-fed parallel converter. The current smoothing reactors in the dc line are replaced by dc voltage filter capacitors. The output parallel resonant circuit is replaced by a series resonant circuit. The voltage on the inverter is constant and equal to the output voltage of the ac to dc rectifier. The full coil current flows through the inverter's SCRs and tuning capacitor bank. Such a configuration provides excellent controllability of the system. By controlling the timing of commutation of the inverter solid state switching devices, it is possible to rapidly change (within one oscillation period) the amount of energy circulating in the resonant circuit.<br>
The potential electrical energy in the dc filter capacitor bank may be indefinitely maintained regardless of inverter status. During each cycle, the reactive power is flowing either from the filter to the furnace via the solid state switching devices or from the furnace to the filter via anti-parallel diodes.<br>
Due to good controllability of the inverter section, there is no need to control dc voltage. Since phase control is not applied to the rectifier, the input power factor on the feeding line is relatively constant. No ac phase correction capacitors or line filters are required. Practical implementation<br><br>
of series resonant converters is even more simplified by utilizing a half-bridge inverter scheme as illustrated in FIG. 2(d).<br>
A current-fed inverter operates with higher voltage, while a voltage-fed inverter operates with low voltage but full coil current. The voltage-fed inverter has better controllability and stores reactive energy entirely in the capacitors, which have lower losses than the dc reactors of the current-fed inverter. In all of these prior art configurations for induction furnace systems, the furnace coil is, as noted above, an extremely inefficient electrical load. Therefore, there exists the need for a higher efficiency coil system for an induction furnace.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is an apparatus for and method of heating and melting electrically conductive material in the crucible of an induction furnace system that includes a passive induction coil surrounding a partial section of the crucible. The passive induction coil is connected to a capacitor to form an L-C tank circuit. An active induction coil, surrounding a partial section of the crucible is supplied ac current from an ac power source. The ac current generates a first magnetic field that heats and melts the electrically conductive material and, by magnetic coupling with the passive coil, induces an induced current in the passive coil. This induced current generates a second magnetic field that heats and melts the electrically conductive material. The resistance of the L-C tank circuit is reflected into the circuit of the active induction coil to increase the efficiency of the induction furnace system. These and other aspects of the invention are set forth in the specification and claims.<br>

Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements there is shown in FIG. 3(a) and FIG. 3(b), in accordance with the present invention, one example of an induction furnace system 10 utilizing a high efficiency coil system.<br>
Coil Li (active coil) is connected at its end terminals to ac power source 2O that is operating at a controllable voltage and frequency to produce current Ii in coil Li. Coil La (passive coil) is connected to capacitor Ca to form a parallel L-C tank circuit. The magnetic field created by the flow of current in coil Li creates a flux field that is magnetically coupled to coil La (as indicated by mutual inductance M in the figures), which induces<br><br>
current Is in coil La. The induced current la has the same frequency as current h. The magnetic fields created by current flowing in coils Li and La will inductively heat and melt electrically conductive material 12 placed in the crucible 13.<br>
The magnitude and phase of la also depends up the selected impedance values of coil La and capacitor Ca in the tank circuit formed by these components.<br>
The voltage across coil La generates a back voltage on coil Li, which opposes the supply voltage that controls the flow of current Ii in Li. As a result, coil Li draws less current from the inverter while the induction furnace system 10 generates the same magnitude of power, thus allowing downsizing of electrical components for the power supply while maintaining the same level of heating and melting power.<br>
Further the reactance of capacitor Ca in the tank circuit substantially improves the low lagging power factor of the induction coil to provide a higher efficiency coil system.<br>
While a voltage-fed half-bridge converter with series tank capacitor is used in FIG. 3(a), FIG. 3(b) illustrates a more general example of the induction furnace system of the present invention wherein the converter (power supply) is genetically identified as element 21. In FIG. 3(a), which for this example of the invention is configured as a half-bridge converter, capacitor Ci is shown as a distributive capacitance across the half-bridge, whereas in FIG. 3(b) capacitor Ci is generally shown as a single circuit element.<br>
The high efficiency coil system of the present invention can be utilized with various types of power supply topologies, such as (but not limited to) series resonant voltage-fed converters and converters utilizing pulse width modulation, to take advantage of the improved efficiency coil system.<br>
The present invention can be further appreciated by the vector diagram shown in FIG. 1O. In the figure, with respect to the active coil<br><br>
circuit, vector OV represents current Ii in active coil Li as illustrated FIG. 3(a) through PIG. 3(c). Vector OA represents the resistive component of the active coil's voltage, IiRi (Ri not shown in the figures). Vector AB represents the inductive component of the active coil's voltage, uLiIi (where o equal 2n times f, the operating frequency of the power supply). Vector BC represents the voltage, c*MIa, induced by the passive coil La onto active coil Li. Vector CD represents the voltage, Ii/oCi, on series capacitors Ci connected between the inverter section of the power supply and active coil Li. Vector OD represents the output voltage, Vinv, of the inverter (terminals 3 and 4 in PIG. 3(a)).<br>
With respect to the passive coil circuit, vector OW represents current la in passive coil La that is induced by the magnetic field produced by current Ij. Vector OP represents the resistive component of the passive coil's voltage, laRa (Ra not shown in the figures). Vector FE represents the inductive component of the pasive coil's voltage, oLala. Vector EG represents the voltage, oMIi, induced by the active coil Li onto passive coil La- Vector GO represents the voltage, la/oCa, on capacitor Ca, which is connected across passive coil La.<br>
The active coil circuit is driven by voltage source, Vinv, while the passive coil loop is not connected to an active energy source. Since the active and passive coils are mutually coupled, vector BC is added to vector OB, which represents the voltage (Vnim) across an active furnace coil in the absence of a passive capacitive furnace coil circuit, to result in vector OC, which is the voltage (Vfera) across an active furnace coil with a passive capacitive furnace coil circuit of the present invention. The resultant furnace voltage, Vtum, with a smaller lagging power factor angle, <p angle between the x-axis and vector oc than conventional furnace as represented by ob in dashed lines illustrated pig. there is a power factor improvement of></p>
In the present invention, the inductive impedance in the passive coil is substantially compensated for by the capacitive impedance (i.e.,<br><br>
l/oC2). The uncompensated resistive component, Ra, in the passive coil circuit is reflected into the active coil circuit by the mutual inductance between the two circuits, and the effective active coil circuit's resistance is increased, thus improving the power factor angle, or efficiency of the coil system.<br>
Further the power factor angle, *F, for the output of the inverter improves by A*P as illustrated by the angle between vector OJ (the resultant vector (V uw) of resistive component vector OA and capacitive component vector AJ in the absence of a passive furnace coil circuit) and vector OD (the resultant vector (Vin») of resistive component vector OH and capacitive component vector HD with the passive furnace coil circuit of the present invention).<br>
In another example of the high frequency coil system of the present invention, as shown in PIG. 3(c), coils Li and La can be fully or partially overlapped to increase the mutual inductance M between the two coils.<br>
As shown in PIG. 4 for one example of the present invention, coils Li and La have two distinct resonant frequencies at approximately 144 Hertz and 166 Hertz, respectively. The same frequency approximations for resonance of coils Li and La ignores the minor frequency offsets for resonance of the two coils that is shown in PIG. 4.<br>
In FIG. 4, the P1B curve (shown in dot-dashed line) illustrates the magnitude of power in the coil Li circuit and the P2B curve (shown in dashed line) illustrates the magnitude of the power in the coil La circuit. The PZn curve (shown in solid line) represents the summation of power in the coil Li and coil La circuits. Power control can be achieved by varying the output frequency (fn) of the power supply between dc and the frequency at which resonance occurs for coil Li (in this example, approximately 144 Hertz).<br>
FIG. 5 shqws for one example of the present invention, the effect of the frequency (fn) of the power supply, on the magnitude of the load<br><br>
impedance (Zn), in ohms, at terminals 1 and 2 as shown in FIG. 3(a) and FIG.3(b)<br>
FIG. 6 shows for one example of the present invention, the effect of the frequency (fn) of the power supply, on the power factor (Pfn) of the load circuit at terminals 1 and 2 as shown in FIG. 3(a) and FIG.3(b). FIG. 6 illustrates the improved coil load power factor that can be achieved in one example of the present invention by operating the power supply in a range below the first resonant frequency of approximately 144 Hertz.<br>
FIG. 7 shows for one example of the present invention, the effect of the frequency (fn) of the power supply, on the magnitude of the load reactance (Xa), in ohms, at terminals 1 and 2 as shown in FIG. 3|a) and FIG. 3{b)<br>
Electromagnetic stirring of the molten material in the crucible can be adjusted by replacing capacitor Ca of the passive reactance with a capacitor having a different value of reactance to change the resonant point in the parallel L-C tank circuit formed by coil La and capacitor Ca. In some applications, where the L-C tank circuit is located near the bottom of the crucible, capacitor Ca is selected to minimize turbulence caused by excessive electromagnetic stirring near the bottom of the crucible to avoid removal of refractory material from the crucible that settles at the bottom of the molten material and contaminates it. Alternatively, capacitor Ca can be an adjustable capacitor bank wherein the capacitance of capacitor Ca can be easily adjusted.<br>
FIG. 8(a) and FIG. 8(b) show an alternative example of the induction furnace system of the present invention wherein tuning capacitor Ca is connected across a partial section, I*, of coil L, which is connected at its end terminals (1 and 2) to the output of the power supply 2O in FIG. 8(a) or power supply 21 in FIG. 8(b).  In this example, coil L functions as an autotransfomer with power applied across the entire coil. The L-C tank circuit formed by partial coil section Lb and capacitor Ca improves the overall efficiency of the induction coil circuit.<br><br>
FIG. 9(a) and FIG. 9|b) shows another alternative example of the induction furnace system of the present invention wherein tuning capacitor Ca is connected across the end terminals of coil L, which has a partial section, I*, connected to the output of the power supply 2O in FIG. 9(a) or power supply 21 in FIG. 9(b). In this example, coil L functions as an autotransfomer with power applied across a partial section of the entire coil. The L-C tank circuit formed by induction coil L and capacitor Ca improves the overall efficiency of the induction coil circuit.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates another example of the present invention wherein crucible 9O comprises an open-ended thermally insulated material surrounded by induction coils. While the crucible 9O is shown as generally cylindrical in shape, the open-ended crucible may be otherwise configured as long as it allows electrically conductive material 92 pass through the crucible. The electrically conductive material may be, but is not limited to, a billet that passes through the crucible whereby the billet is inductively heated or melted. The crucible and the electrically conductive material may be oriented in other directions than that shown in FIG. 11, for example, horizontally rather than vertically. In this example, the coils, parallel L-C tank capacitor and power supply are similar to those in FIG. 3(a). This open-ended crucible can be used with any other examples of the present invention.<br>
Other active and passive coil arrangements are within the scope of the disclosed invention. For example, either multiple active and/or multiple passive coil circuits maybe be utilized in various configurations having one or more overlapped coils and/or one or more non-overlapped coils. Further the active and passive coils may be alternatively arranged around the height of the crucible. For example, the passive coil may be disposed above the active coil.<br>
While one type of power supply is shown in the figures for use with the high efficiency coil system of the invention, other power supply topologies, such as power supplies employing pulse width modulation<br><br>
techniques, can be used to the advantage of the coil system of the induction furnace system of the present invention.<br>
The examples of the invention include reference to specific electrical components. One skilled in the art may practice the invention by substituting components that are not necessarily of the same type but will create the desired conditions or accomplish the desired results of the invention. For example, single components may be substituted for multiple components or vice versa.<br>
