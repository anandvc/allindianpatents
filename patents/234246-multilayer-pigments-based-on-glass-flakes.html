				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Multilayer pigments based on glass flakes<br>
The present invention relates to multilayer pigments based on glass flakes,<br>
to a method for the production of such pigments and their use in plastics,<br>
paints, coatings, powder coatings, inks, printing inks, glasses, ceramic<br>
products, agriculture foils, for laser-marking of papers and plastics and in<br>
cosmetic formulations.<br>
Lustre pigments or special-effect pigments are employed in numerous<br>
fields in industry, especially in the sector of automotive finishes, in<br>
decorative coatings, in plastics, in paints, in printing inks and in cosmetic<br>
formulations.<br>
Multilayer interference pigments with alternating layers of high and low<br>
refractive index are known. They differ in respect of the carrier material and<br>
of the material of the individual layers, and in the preparation process. The<br>
layers are prepared either by precipitation in a wet process or by vapor<br>
deposition or sputtering under vacuum. The layers applied to the carrier or<br>
to a release layer are all optically active and contribute to the development<br>
of the interference colors.<br>
U.S.P. 4,434,010 discloses a multilayer interference pigment consisting of<br>
a central layer of a reflective metal, such as aluminum, and alternating<br>
layers of two transparent dielectric materials of high and low refractive<br>
index respectively, such as titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide, for<br>
example. This multilayer pigment is used preferably for counterfeit-<br>
protected products like securities or banknotes.<br>
JP H7-759 discloses a multilayer interference pigment with metallic lustre,<br>
for which a substrate is coated with alternate layers of titanium dioxide and<br>
silicon dioxide. The substrate comprises flakes of aluminum, gold or silver,<br>
or of mica or glass, with a coating of metals. The depth effect which is<br>
characteristic of and desired for interference pigments, however, cannot be<br>
generated. This is because of the total reflection of the light at the metal<br>
layer which forms the core. Consequently, the interference effect remains<br>
limited to the layers which are located on top of the metal layer.<br>
Furthermore, the lack of transparency of the substrate greatly restricts<br>
options for combinations with further pigments in applications-related<br>
formulations.<br>
U.S.P. 3,438,796 and U.S.P. 5,135,812 describe, for example, metal lustre<br>
pigments having a central essentially non-transparent aluminum film<br>
coated on both sides in alternation with dielectric films of low refractive<br>
index, such as silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride, and with partially<br>
transparent metal films, such as films of chromium or aluminum, for<br>
example. Owing to the preparation process, the central metal film of these<br>
pigments is coated only on the top and bottom sides of the platelets, while<br>
the side areas constitute broken edges and lie open towards the medium.<br>
DE 44 05 494, DE 44 37 753, DE 195 16 181 and DE 195 15 988 disclose<br>
lustre pigments prepared by coating metal platelets, especially aluminum<br>
flakes, with metal oxide layers of low refractive index, such as with a silicon<br>
dioxide layer, and with non-selectively absorbing metal oxide layers or<br>
metal layers of high refractive index, using CVD or wet chemical<br>
techniques.<br>
Lustre pigments based on metal substrates frequently have good<br>
properties, including good hiding , but the result on application, such as in<br>
the paint, for example, is a "hard" metallic lustre, which is frequently<br>
undesired.<br>
Lustre pigments based on transparent platelet-shaped substrates which<br>
do not have this "hard" metallic lustre are the subject of WO 93/12182.<br>
Mica flakes are covered with a metal oxide layer of high refractive index,<br>
such as TiO2, and with a nonselectively absorbing layer. Depending on the<br>
thickness of the TiO2 layer, when viewed straight on these pigments exhibit<br>
a particular interference colour which becomes increasingly weaker as the<br>
viewing angle becomes more oblique and which finally flips to gray or<br>
black. The interference color does not change, but a decrease is found in<br>
the color saturation.<br>
JP 1992/93206 claims lustre pigments on the basis of glass flakes or mica<br>
particles which are covered with a reflecting metal layer and with<br>
alternating layers of SiO2 and TiO2.<br>
EP 0 753 545 A2 discloses lustre pigments based on multiply coated, non-<br>
metallic, platelet-shaped substrates which are of high refractive index and<br>
which are at least partially transparent to visible light and have at least one<br>
layer assembly comprising a colorless coating of low refractive index and a<br>
reflective coating which absorbs selectively or nonselectively.<br>
Disadvantages of this invention are the technically very complex and costly<br>
preparation process and the frequent difficulty in reproducing the pigments<br>
in the desired product quality.<br>
U.S.P. 3,331,699 discloses that glass flakes may be coated with a<br>
translucent layer of particles of metal oxide having a high index of<br>
refraction, such as titanium dioxide, provided there is first deposited on the<br>
glass flakes a nucleating substance which is insoluble in the acidic solution<br>
from which the translucent layer of metal oxide is deposited. The patent<br>
does not mention that smooth transparent films, not particles, are<br>
necessary for quality interference pigments to be developed. The patent<br>
teaches that the nature of the glass is not critical, but that the presence of<br>
the nucleated surface is critical. It is further stated that there are only a<br>
small number of metal oxide compounds which are insoluble in the acidic<br>
solution and capable of forming a nucleated surface on the glass flakes; tin<br>
oxide and a fibrous boehmite form of alumina monohydrate are the only<br>
two such materials disclosed. As demonstrated in the examples below,<br>
products prepared according to the teachings of this patent are poor in<br>
quality.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,436,077 teaches a glass flake substrate which has a metal<br>
covering layer on which is formed a dense protective covering layer of a<br>
metal oxide such as titanium dioxide. In this patent, the nature of the glass<br>
is unimportant, the metallic coating provides the desired appearance and<br>
the overcoating of the metal oxide is present to protect the metallic layer<br>
from corrosive environments.<br>
For the preparation of pearlescent pigments the transparency and the<br>
thickness of the platy substrate are very important. For the first time<br>
EP 0 289 240 B1 discloses the manufacturing of extremely thin glass<br>
flakes at reasonable costs. According to the claimed process the glass<br>
flakes can be made in any desired composition, e. g., from pure SiO2 and<br>
also in any thickness tailored for the intended application down to below<br>
1.0 µm.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the problems of the<br>
prior art and to provide novel multilayer pigments which have<br>
advantageous application properties.<br>
Surprisingly, an interference pigment has now been found which is based<br>
on multiply coated glass flakes and comprises a particular arrangement of<br>
optically functional layers by means of which particular optical effects are<br>
achieved.<br>
The invention therefore provides interference pigments on the basis of<br>
multiply coated glass flakes which contain at least three alternating layers<br>
with a high and a low refractive index.<br>
Preferably the layer structure is as of follows:<br>
(A) a coating having a refractive index n &gt; 1.8,<br>
(B) a coating having a refractive index n = 1.8, and<br>
(C) a coating having a high refractive index n &gt; 1.8<br>
and, if desired,<br>
(D) an outer protective layer.<br>
The invention also provides the pigments of the invention for the use in<br>
paints, lacquers, printing inks, plastics, agricultural foils, ceramic materials,<br>
glasses and cosmetic formulations and for the use in laser-marking of<br>
papers and plastics.<br>
Preferred glass flakes have a thickness of less than 1 µm, preferably 
µm. Especially preferred are glass flakes with a thickness of 
Glass can be classified for example as A glass, C glass, E glass, ECR<br>
glass. For the present invention quartz glass is preferred but this glass is<br>
very expensive.<br>
Suitable glass flakes preferably prepared according to EP 0 289 240 B1<br>
are characterized in that they contain an average particle size in the range<br>
of 5 -1000 µm, preferably in the range of 5 - 150 µm. Preferred glass<br>
flakes have an average particle size in the range of 5 -150 µm and a<br>
thickness of 0.1 - 0.8 µm, preferably of 0.2 - 0.5 µm. The aspect ratio of<br>
glass flakes is in the range of 10 - 300, preferably in the range of 50 - 200.<br>
The glass flakes can be coated in the same way as conventional pearl<br>
lustre pigments. Coatings with a metal oxide may be accomplished by any<br>
known methods, such as hydrolysis of a metal salt by heating or under<br>
alkaline conditions, which deposits hydrated metal oxide, followed by<br>
calcination. In general, the procedure involves the dispersing of the thin<br>
glass flake particles and combining that dispersion with a precursor which<br>
forms a hydrous metal oxide film coating on the flakes.<br>
The thickness of the individual layers of high and low refractive index on<br>
the base substrate is essential for the optical properties of the pigment. For<br>
a pigment with intensive interference colors, the thickness of the individual<br>
layers must be adjusted precisely with respect to one another.<br>
If n is the refractive index of a thin layer and d its thickness, the<br>
interference colour of this layer is defined by the product n d (n d =<br>
optical thickness). The colors which result from such a film under<br>
perpendicular light incidence in reflected light result from an intensification<br>
of the fight of wavelength<br><br>
and by an attenuation of the light of wavelength<br><br>
where N is a positive integer.<br>
The variation in color which results with increasing film thickness is a<br>
consequence of the intensification or attenuation of certain light<br>
wavelengths through interference. If two or more layers in a multilayer<br>
pigment possess the same optical thickness, the color of the reflected light<br>
becomes more intense as the number of layers increases. In addition,<br>
it is possible through an appropriate choice of layer thickness to achieve a<br>
particularly strong variation of color as a function of the viewing angle. A<br>
pronounced, so-called color flop is developed. The thickness of the<br>
individual layers, preferably metal oxide layers, irrespective of their<br>
refractive index, depends on the field of use and is generally from 10 to<br>
1000 nm, preferably from 15 to 800 nm and, in particular, 20 to 600 nm.<br>
The multilayer pigments of the invention preferably feature a coating (A) of<br>
high refractive index in combination with a colorless coating (B) of low<br>
refractive index and located thereon a coating of high refractive index. The<br>
pigments can comprise two or more, identical or different combinations of<br>
layer assemblies, although preference is given to covering the substrate<br>
with only one layer assembly (A) + (B) + (C). In order to make the color flop<br>
more intense the pigment of the invention may comprise up to 4 layer<br>
assemblies, although the thickness of the combined layers on the substrate<br>
should not exceed 3 µm.<br>
The glass particles can be coated with three or more layers, preferably with<br>
3,4, 5, 6 or 7 layers from the group consisting of metal oxides, metal<br>
suboxides, metal fluorides, metal oxyhalides, metal sulfides, metal<br>
chalcogenides, metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, metal carbides, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Especially preferred are glass flakes coated with 3, 5 or 7<br>
layers. The layer packet (A) and (B) may be present in the standard layer<br>
assembly (A) + (B) + (C) up to four times.<br>
The layer (A) of high refractive index has a refractive index n &gt; 1.8,<br>
preferably n &gt; 2.1. Materials suitable as the layer material (A) are all<br>
materials known to the skilled worker which are of high refractive index, are<br>
filmlike and can be applied homogeneously to the substrate particles.<br>
Particularly suitable materials are metal oxides, metal sulfides or metal<br>
oxide mixtures, such as TiO2, Fe2O3, TiFe2O5, Fe3O4, BiOCI, CoO, Co3O4,<br>
Cr2O3, VO2, V2O3, Sn(Sb)O2l ZrO2, ZnO or SnO2, iron titanates, iron oxide<br>
hydrates, titanium suboxides (reduced titanium species having oxidation<br>
states from 
mixtures or mixed phases of these compounds with one another or with<br>
other metal oxides.<br>
Metal sulfide coatings are preferably selected from sulfides of tin, silver,<br>
lanthanum, rare earth metals, preferably cerium, chromium, molybdenum,<br>
tungsten, iron, cobalt and/or nickel.<br>
The thickness of the layer (A) is 10 - 550 nm, preferably 15 - 400 nm and,<br>
in particular, 20 - 350 nm.<br>
Colorless materials of low refractive index suitable for the coating (B) are<br>
preferably metal oxides or the corresponding oxide hydrates, such as SiO2,<br>
MgF2, AI2O3, AIO(OH), B2O3 or a mixture of these metal oxides, The<br>
thickness of the layer (B) is 10 - 1000 nm, preferably 20 - 800 nm and, in<br>
particular 30 - 600 nm.<br>
Materials particularly suitable for the coating (C) of high refractive index are<br>
colorless or colored metal oxides such as TiO2, Fe2O3, TiFe2O5, Fe3O4,<br>
BiOCI, CoO, CO3O4, Cr2O3, VO2, V2O3, Sn(Sb)O2, ZrO2, ZnO or SnO2, iron<br>
titanates, iron oxide hydrates, titanium suboxides, bismuth vanadate, cobalt<br>
aluminate, and also mixtures or mixed phases of these compounds with<br>
one another or with other metal oxides. The TiO2 layers additionally can<br>
contain absorbing material, e.g. carbon, or coated therewith. Also of<br>
particular interest are multiply coated glass flakes whose TiO2 coating (C)<br>
is partially reduced and which as well as unchanged TiO2 contains reduced<br>
titanium species having oxidation states from 
Ti3O5, Ti2O3 through TiO, titanium oxynitrides and also titanium nitride). It is<br>
also possible to use colorless high refractive materials, for example metal<br>
oxides such as zirconium dioxide, in particular titanium dioxide, which have<br>
been colored with selectively absorbing colorants, by incorporation of<br>
colorants in the metal oxide layer, by doping thereof with selecTively<br>
absorbing metal caTions or by coaTing the metal oxide layer with a colorant<br>
like for example prussian blue or carmine. The thickness of the layer (C) is<br>
10 - 550 nm, preferably 15-400 nm and, in parTicular, 20 - 350 nm.<br>
In addiTion to the standard layer packet (A) + (B) + (C), in which the layer<br>
packet of (A) + (B) may be present up to four Times in the pigment of the<br>
invenTion, there are other preferred embodiments. For instance, between<br>
the substrate (S) and the layer (A), between the layer (A) and (B), between<br>
layer (B) and (C) and/or between layer (C) and the top layer (D) the<br>
pigment of the invenTion may have a further absorbing or nonabsorbing<br>
layer [(S1), (A1), (B1), (C1)]. The thickness of the interlayers is 1 - 50 nm,<br>
preferably 1-40 nm and, in parTicular, 1-30 nm. The invenTive pigments<br>
may contain a plurality of idenTical or different combinaTions (layer packets)<br>
of(A) + (B).<br>
The mulTilayer coated glass flakes obtained in this way are characterised in<br>
that at least three homogeneous layers are surrounding the uniform thin<br>
glass flakes.<br>
Preferred effect pigments of the present invenTion are given in the<br>
following:<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + Fe2O3<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2/Fe2O3<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + (Sn,Sb)O2<br>
glass flakes + (Sn,Sb)O2 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + Fe2O3 + SiO2 + (Sn,Sb)O2<br>
glass flakes + TiO2/Fe2O3 + SiO2 + TiO2/Fe2O3<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + MoS2<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + Cr2O3<br>
glass flakes + Cr2O3 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + Fe2O3 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + AI2O3 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + Fe2TiO5 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + Fe2Ti05/TiO2<br>
glass flakes + TiO suboxides. + SiO2 + TiO2 suboxides<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2+SiO2+TiO2+ Prussian Blue<br>
glass flakes + TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
glass flakes + TiO2+SiO2+TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2 + SiO2 + TiO2<br>
and if desired,<br>
(D) an outer protecTive layer.<br>
A parTicularly preferred embodiment is the coaTing of the glass flakes with<br>
the following layer assembly:<br>
(S1) opTional, SnO2<br>
(A) TiO2 or Fe2O3<br>
(B) SiO2<br>
(B1) opTional, SnO2<br>
(C) TiO2<br>
(D) final coaTing related to applicaTion<br>
CoaTing the substrates with layers (A) and (C) with a high refracTive index<br>
and, if desired, further colored or colorless coaTings produces pigments<br>
whose color, gloss, hiding power and angular dependence of perceived<br>
color can be varied within wide limits.<br>
The pigments of the invenTion are easy to produce by virtue of the<br>
generaTion of three or more interference layers of high and low refracTive<br>
index, precisely defined thickness and smooth surface on the thin glass<br>
flakes. In case of layers with different metal oxides or metal oxide mixtures<br>
the sequences of high refracTive index layers in the mulTilayer stack can be<br>
arranged arbitrary as long as a low refracTive index layer is present in<br>
between.<br>
The metal oxide layers are preferably applied by wet-chemical means, it<br>
being possible to use the wet-chemical coaTing techniques developed for<br>
the producTion of pearl lustre pigments; techniques of this kind are<br>
described, for example, in DE 14 67 468, DE 19 59 988, DE 20 09 566,<br>
DE 22 14 545, DE 22 15 191, DE 22 44 298, DE 23 13 331, DE 25 22 572,<br>
DE 31 37 808, DE 31 37 809, DE 31 51 343, DE 31 51 354, DE 31 51 355,<br>
DE 32 11 602, DE 32 35 017, DE 38 42 330 or else in further patent<br>
documents and other publicaTions.<br>
Layers of TiO2 can be in the ruTile or anatase modificaTion. Preferred are<br>
TiO2 (ruTile) layers. Titanium dioxide layers can be also reduced by known<br>
means, e.g. ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbon vapor and mixtures thereof<br>
or metal powders, as described in EP 0 735 114, DE 34 33 657, DE 41 25<br>
134, EP 0 332 071, EP 0 707 050 or WO 93/19131. Mixed iron oxide/<br>
Titanium dioxide layers can be made either by subsequent precipitaTion or<br>
by co-precipitaTion of the individual metal oxides. In the case of wet<br>
coaTing, the substrate parTicles are suspended in water, and hydrolysable<br>
metal salts are added at a pH which is appropriate for hydrolysis and is<br>
chosen such that the metal oxides or metal oxide hydrates are precipitated<br>
directly onto the platelets without any instances of side precipitaTion. The<br>
pH is kept constant usually by simultaneous metered addiTion of a base<br>
and/or acid. Subsequently, the pigments are filtered off, washed and dried<br>
and, if desired, calcined, with the opTion to adjust the calcinaTion<br>
temperature in respect of the parTicular coaTing present. In general, the<br>
calcinaTion temperatures are between 250 and 1000 °C, preferably<br>
between 350 and 900 °C. If desired, the pigments may be calcined before<br>
being resuspended for the applicaTion of further layers by precipitaTion.<br>
CoaTing can also take place in a fluidized-bed reactor by means of gas-<br>
phase coaTing, in which case it is possible, for example, to make<br>
appropriate use of the techniques proposed in EP 0 045 851 and<br>
EP 0 106 235 for preparing pearl lustre pigments.<br>
The metal oxide of high refracTive index used is preferably Titanium dioxide<br>
and/or iron oxide, and the metal oxide of low refracTive index preferably<br>
used is silicon dioxide.<br>
For the applicaTion of the Titanium dioxide layers, preference is given to the<br>
technique described in US 3,553,001.<br>
An aqueous Titanium salt soluTion is added slowly to a suspension of the<br>
substrate to be coated, heated to about 50-100 °C, and a substanTially<br>
constant pH of about 0.5 - 5 is maintained by simultaneous metered<br>
addiTion of a base, for example aqueous ammonia soluTion or aqueous<br>
alkali metal hydroxide soluTion. As soon as the desired layer thickness of<br>
the TiO2 precipitate has been reached, the addiTion of both Titanium salt<br>
soluTion and base is terminated.<br>
This technique, also referred to as the TitraTion process, is notable for the<br>
fact that it avoids an excess of Titanium salt. This is achieved by supplying<br>
to the hydrolysis only that quanTity per unit Time which is necessary for<br>
uniform coaTing with the hydrated TiO2 and which can be received per unit<br>
Time by the available surface area of the parTicles to be coated. Hereby, the<br>
formaTion of hydrated Titanium dioxide parTicles not precipitated onto the<br>
surface to be coated can be minimized.<br>
The applicaTion of the silicon dioxide layers can be performed, for example,<br>
as follows: A potassium or sodium silicate soluTion is metered into a heated<br>
(50-100 °C) suspension of the substrate that is to be coated. The pH is<br>
held constant at about 6 - 9 by simultaneous addiTion of a dilute mineral<br>
acid, such as HCI, HNO3 or H2SO4. As soon as the desired layer thickness<br>
of SiO2 has been reached, the addiTion of the silicate soluTion is terminated.<br>
The suspension is subsequently sTirred for about 0.5 h.<br>
To enhance the light and weather stability it is frequently advisable,<br>
depending on the field of applicaTion, to subject the mulTilayer coated glass<br>
flakes to a surface treatment. Useful surface treatments and<br>
aftertreatments include for example the processes described in DE-C 22<br>
15 191, DE-A 31 51 354, DE-A 32 35 017 or DE-A 33 34 598, DE 40 30<br>
727 A1, EP 0 649 886 A2, WO 97/29059, WO 99/57204, US 5,759,255.<br>
This surface treatment further enhances the chemical stability of the<br>
pigments and/or facilitates the handling of the pigment, especially its<br>
incorporaTion into various applicaTion media.<br>
MulTilayer pigments generated in this way yield opTically highly improved<br>
effect pigments at comparaTively low costs with<br>
- superior brilliance<br>
- clear and intense colors<br>
- intense color travel<br>
- alternaTively high performance opTical filter properTies<br>
- very good transparency (important in mixed formulaTions)<br>
and therefore suited for pracTically all applicaTions known in the field of<br>
pigments. At the same Time their shape and parTicle size can be freely<br>
tailored for an opTimum performance.<br>
Especially the last menTioned aspect is of high importance as for many<br>
applicaTions it is absolutely necessary to adjust the parTicle shape. For<br>
cosmeTic use, it is necessary to reduce the size and the thickness to achieve<br>
a smooth and silky appearance. For automoTive paints or prinTing inks it is a<br>
must to reduce the parTicle sizes down to below 40 urn or even 20 urn in<br>
diameter. This of course means that the thicknesses must follow this trend to<br>
maintain an aspect raTio needed for attracTive effects. For these examples<br>
therefore thicknesses of the substrate of 
The glass flakes made by the above menTioned process fulfill these<br>
requirements. Furthermore they show a superior planarity and smoothness<br>
(surface microstructure) which can be expressed by the raTio BET (specific<br>
surface area) to WCA (water covering area) as described for aluminum<br>
pigments in U.S.P. 4,936,913 and U.S.P. 5,127,951. The values are around 3<br>
which indicate the opTimum suitability of the material. The high quality of<br>
these flakes also explains the observed high transparency of pigments made<br>
therefrom.<br>
The preferred designs for the invenTive mulTilayer pigments are:<br>
&gt; 3 - 
10-35 µm, and<br>
&gt; 0.2 - 
&gt; 3 - 
&gt; 0.2 - 
The effect pigments of the present invenTion are advantageously useful for<br>
many purposes, such as the coloring of plasTics, glasses, ceramic<br>
products, agricultural foils, decoraTive cosmeTic formulaTions and in<br>
parTicular coaTings, especially automoTive coaTings, and inks, including<br>
prinTing inks. All customary prinTing processes can be employed, for<br>
example offset prinTing, intaglio prinTing, bronzing, flexographic prinTing.<br>
The effect pigments of the present invenTion are also advantageously<br>
useful for these purposes in admixture with filler pigments or transparent<br>
and hiding white, colored and black organic and anorganic pigments and<br>
also with convenTional transparent, colored and black luster pigments<br>
based on metal oxide coated mica, TiO2 flakes, SiO2 flakes or AI2O3 flakes<br>
and coated or uncoated metal pigments, BiOCI pigments, platelet shaped<br>
iron oxides, or graphite flakes. The invenTive pigments can be further<br>
coated with organic or inorganic layers to yield combinaTion pigments.<br>
AddiTionally, the invenTive pigment mixture can contain organic or inorganic<br>
colorants, thixotropic agents, wetTing agents, dispersing agents, water,<br>
organic solvent or solvent mixtures, etc.<br>
The pigment mixture of the invenTion is simple and easy to handle. The<br>
pigment mixture can be incorporated into the system in which it is used by<br>
simple sTirring. Laborious milling and dispersing of the pigments is not<br>
necessary.<br>
The coated glass flakes of the invenTion can be used for pigmenTing and/or<br>
coaTing materials, prinTing inks, plasTics, agricultural films, button pastes,<br>
for the coaTing of seed, for the coloring of food, coaTings of medicaments or<br>
cosmeTic formulaTions. The concentraTion of the pigments in the system in<br>
which it is to be used is generally between 0.01 and 50 % by weight,<br>
preferably between 0.1 and 5 % by weight, based on the overall solids<br>
content of the system. This concentraTion is generally dependent on the<br>
specific applicaTion.<br>
PlasTics comprising the pigment mixture of the invenTion in amounts of 0.1<br>
to 50 % by weight, in parTicular from 0.5 to 7 % by weight, are frequently<br>
notable for a parTicular brilliance.<br>
In the coaTing sector, especially in automoTive finishing, the pigments<br>
according to the invenTion are employed in amounts of 0.5 to 10 % by<br>
weight.<br>
In the pigmentaTion of binder systems, for example for paints and prinTing<br>
inks for intaglio, offset or screen prinTing, the pigment is incorporated into<br>
the prinTing ink in amounts of 2 - 50 % by weight, preferably 5-30 % by<br>
weight and in parTicular 8 -15 % by weight.<br>
The invenTion likewise provides pigment preparaTions comprising mulTilayer<br>
coated glass flakes, opTionally effect pigments, binders and, if desired,<br>
addiTives, said preparaTions being in the form of substanTially solvent-free,<br>
free-flowing powders or granules. Such granules contain up to 95 % by<br>
weight of the invenTive pigments. A pigment preparaTion in which the<br>
mulTilayer coated glass flakes of the invenTion are pasted up with a binder<br>
and with water and/or an organic solvent, with or without addiTives, and in<br>
which the paste is subsequently dried and brought into a compact<br>
parTiculate form, e.g. granules, pellets, briquettes, a masterbatch or tablets,<br>
is parTicularly suitable as a precursor for prinTing inks.<br>
The present invenTion therefore also provides formulaTions containing the<br>
pigments of the invenTion.<br>
In order to further illustrate the invenTion, various non-limiTing examples are<br>
set forth below. In these, as well as throughout the balance of this<br>
specificaTion and claims, all parts and percentages are by weight and all<br>
temperatures are in degrees cenTigrade unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
100 g glass flakes with a maximum diameter of 40 µm (average 22 urn)<br>
and an average thickness of 0.5 µm (refracTive index 1.5) are suspended in<br>
21 deionized water. Under vigorous sTirring the slurry is heated to 75 °C<br>
and the coaTing is started by feeding an aqueous soluTion of SnCl4<br>
represenTing an amount of 3 % of SnO2 relaTive to the glass flakes within<br>
0.5 h. As soon as pH 2,0 is reached 32 % NaOH soluTion is simultaneously<br>
fed in to keep the pH at this value.<br>
The slurry is kept sTirring for 15 min before the feeding of aqueous TiCl4<br>
soluTion (400 g TiCM H2O) is started. The pH is kept constant at 2.0 with<br>
NaOH. It is conTinued unTil the desired colour is achieved. The slurry is kept<br>
sTirring for again 15 min.<br>
By slowly adding NaOH the pH is raised to 8.0 before the feeding of 1,35<br>
ml/min of 10% sodium silicate soluTion (from 74 ml of sodium silicate<br>
soluTion with 8 % Na and 27 % SiO2 diluted with 170 ml of deionized water)<br>
is started. The amount necessary for a proper layer thickness has to be<br>
exactly calculated because it is not opTically visible during the coaTing<br>
process. After again sTirring for 15 min the pH is lowered with 10 % HCI to<br>
2.0 and the second coaTing of TiO2 is carried out like the first one unTil the<br>
desired end point is reached. The slurry is kept sTirring for one more hour,<br>
then filtered off, washed free from salts, dried, calcined at 800 °C (for 30<br>
minutes) and sieved.<br>
From the pigment yielded a draw down is made to measure the colorisTic<br>
properTies. It shows a highly brilliant clear color effect combined with a<br>
superior transparency. Especially in the shallow observaTion angle of the<br>
black background it nearly "disappears".<br>
Example 2 (comparaTive example)<br>
This is carried out in the same way like Example 1. Instead of glass flakes<br>
mica of the same parTicle size distribuTion is used.<br>
The effect on the draw down of the finished pigment is brilliant and color<br>
intense but it does not exhibit the unique clearness and parTicularly the<br>
transparency in the shallow angle shown by the glass flakes based<br>
mulTilayer pigments.<br>
Example 3<br>
100 g glass flakes with a maximum diameter of 40 |jm (average 22 urn)<br>
and an average thickness of 0.8 urn (refracTive index 1.5) are suspended in<br>
2 I of deionized water. The suspension is heated to 75 °C, adjusted to a pH<br>
of 1.8 with dilute hydrochloric acid, first of all coated with SnO2 by adding<br>
3.3 ml/min of SnCI4 soluTion (from 2.2 g of SnCI4 and 7.5 ml of cone,<br>
hydrochloric acid in 100 ml of deionized water). The pH is held constant<br>
using 32 % sodium hydroxide soluTion.<br>
STirring is conTinued for 15 minutes and then coaTing with TiO2 is carried<br>
out under the same pH/temperature condiTions by adding 1.5 ml/min of<br>
TiCI4 soluTion (400 g of TiCl4l) and keeping the pH constant with 32 %<br>
sodium hydroxide soluTion. CoaTing is interrupted after the second-order<br>
green end point is reached, sTirring is conTinued for 15 minutes, the pH is<br>
adjusted to 8.0 with diluted sodium hydroxide soluTion (over the course of<br>
about 15 minutes), and then sTirring is conTinued for 10 minutes more.<br>
CoaTing with SiO2 is then carried out by adding 3 ml/min of dilute sodium<br>
silicate soluTion (from 7.3 g of sodium silicate soluTion with 8 % Na and<br>
27 % SiO2 and 80 ml of deionized water) without pH compensaTion.<br>
Afterwards, sTirring is conTinued for 15 minutes, the pH is readjusted to 1.8<br>
with dilute hydrochloric acid (over the course of about 10 minutes) and a<br>
second TiO2 layer is applied as described above by adding TiCl4 soluTion.<br>
CoaTing is interrupted after the third-order green comparison end point has<br>
been reached, sTirring is conTinued for 15 minutes, and then the pigment is<br>
filtered off, washed, dried and calcined at 850 °C for 30 minutes.<br>
The pigment obtained has an intense green interference color. The division<br>
of the TiO2 layers is as follows:<br>
1st layer: about 170 nm<br>
2nd layer: about 85 nm<br>
Total layer: about 260 nm.<br>
The thickness of the SiO2 interlayer is about 5 nm.<br>

32 % sodiµm hydroxide and then sTirring is conTinued for 15 min. more.<br>
Coating with SiO2 is carried out by adding 2 ml/min sodiµm silicate soluTion<br>
with 13.5 % SiO2 (from 196 g sodiµm silicate soluTion with 27 % SiO2 and<br>
196 ml deionized water). The pH is held constant using 15 % hydrochloric<br>
acid.<br>
STirring is conTinued for 30 min., the pH is adjusted to 1.8 by adding 1<br>
