				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of and device for rotary casting and a foundry plant. Methods and devices of said type are known from EPO 656 819 wherein a mould with a downwardly opening ingate is moved together with a casting container with an upwardly opening aperture, whereupon melt for one casting operation is filled into the casting container whereupon the mould together with the casting container is rotated by approximately 180° around a horizontal axis, so that the melt reaches the mould. In this case, the casting container is filled via a filling aperture which is provided with a special closure.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a method and device which improve productivity when using said method for mass production purposes. The objective is achieved by providing a method of rotary casting, wherein a mould with an upwardly pointing ingate end is mounted on a base plate, the finished mould is rotated with the base plate by approximately 180° around a horizontal rotational axis, so that the ingate end points downwardly, a casting container with an upwardly positioned aperture end is filled with melt for one casting operation, the casting container, by means of its aperture end, is sealingly coupled to the downwardly pointing ingate end of the mould, the mould with the contacting casting<br>
container is rotated by approximately 180° around a horizontal axis, so that the melt reaches the mould, whereupon the casting container is released from the coupled position and removed from the mould.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a device for rotary casting, having a mould mounted on a base plate and provided with an ingate pointing away from the upper face of the base plate, having bearing means for the base plate in which the base plate is supported so as to be rotatable around a horizontal rotational axis by at least 180°, having a casting container whose aperture can be positioned so as to point towards the upper face of the base plate, having moving means for the casting container by means of which the casting container with its aperture can be sealingly coupled to the downwardly pointing ingate of the mould and is rotatable together with the mould around a horizontal rotational axis by at least 180° and, in the rotated position, can be removed from the upwardly pointing ingate of the mould.<br>
In accordance with the inventive method and the inventive device, the mould - either manually or partly in an automated way - can be assembled easily and quickly, i.e. assembling the mould is simplified and easily controllable. Furthermore, because the casting container is filled away from the mould, the controlling ability has been improved and there is a greater degree of safety when filling the casting container which does not require a special closure mechanism. By rotating the mould after it has been assembled and by coupling the casting container from below, i.e. by coupling the aperture of the casting container to the ingate of the mould, there are achieved the possibilities and advantages of rotary casting, i.e. when subsequently rotating back or further<br>
rotating the mould with the coupled casting container around a horizontal axis, the casting operation is calm and turbulence-free. For the purpose of accelerating the process further and for preparing the next casting operation, the casting container can be removed upwardly from the mould whose ingate now points downwardly. By proceeding in this way, it also becomes possible to place a pressure hood on to the upwardly opening ingate and optionally on to feeders now positioned at the top end and to improve the solidification process by applying gas pressure. Said gas pressure is preferably applied after a complete, hardened surface layer has formed in the mould.<br>
In principle, the mould can consist entirely of moulded material parts included comprising a base plate consisting of moulded material, i.e. the mould can consist of a so-called core package wherein all the surfaces of the mould cavity are formed of cores. The mould can also be erected on a base plate made of metal and, optionally, contain side walls made of metal into which there are inserted inner cores consisting of moulded material and which are upwardly sealed by a cover core made of moulded material, i.e. the mould can form a so-called semi-die. Finally, the mould can be provided entirely in the form of a permanent mould with a metallic base plate and metallic side walls and a metallic cover into which the required moulded material cores are inserted, i.e. the mould can be provided in the form of a die.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the finish-assembled mould without the coupled-on casting container is rotated around the same horizontal axis as the mould with the coupled-on casting container, and it is advantageous that the mould on its own and the mould together with the coupled-on casting container,<br>
in each case, is rotated around an axis which passes through the mould and is positioned near the base plate; this is to ensure that the entire assembly is supported approximately in the centre of gravity.<br>
The method is preferably carried out in such a way that, for the purpose of coupling and removing the casting container to and from the mould , the casting container carries out a radial movement relative to the horizontal rotational axis and that, for the purpose of transferring the casting container into a filling position, it carries a pivoting movement around the axis of said radial movement. In this way the necessary separation of the casting container from the mould can be achieved by simple movement sequences, so that the operations of assembling the mould and filling the casting container can overlap in terms of time.<br>
The inventive device is preferably characterised in that the device comprises a bogie with two cheek parts in which there are supported swivel pins between which the base plate is suspended. Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment, the casting container is displaceable on a column which is arranged radially relative to the horizontal swivel pins, with the column, especially, being slid on to one of the swivel pins. For putting said pivot movement into effect, the column is preferably provided with an attached radial pivot arm which is rotatable around the axis of the column and to which the casting container is secured directly .<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that, at its ingate end, the mould comprises at least one ingate aperture and one gas discharge line which both assume different angular positions relative to the horizontal rotational axis. In addition, the casting<br>
container can comprise an intermediate wall which, in a position wherein the casting container is coupled to the mould, extends parallel to the horizontal rotational axis, which enters the melt and ends at a distance from the base of the casting container. When feeding the melt into the casting container on one side of the intermediate wall and when rotating the casting container around 180° towards said side, said intermediate wall succeeds in holding back and wiping off oxide layers. By means of its aperture, the casting container coupled to the mould is able to cover both the ingate and the ventilation aperture of the mould, with these two openings being positioned on different sides of said intermediate wall.<br>
The inventive device can preferably be used in a foundry plant ]<br>
in such a way that at least two inventive devices are associated with a melting furnace with a dispensing ladle and<br>
i are movable each to and fro in a linear movement between a<br>
casting station at the melting furnace and at least one<br>
solidification station. The assembly and removal of the mould "preferably also take place in the casting station where all<br>
the handling elements are combined. However, it is also possible to provide a separate station for assembling and<br>
Removing the mould. If the casting system comprises two<br>
devices, it is referred to as a tandem system and if there are<br>
three devices, it is referred to as a tridem system, with the latter constituting the acceptable maximum.<br>
According to a further embodiment, a plurality of inventive devices can be included in a foundry plant in such a way that they are associated with a melting furnace with a dispensing ladle and can be transferred on a circular track from one casting station to at least one solidification station. This is referred to as a carousel casting system. In this case,<br>
too, the casting station can form the mould assembly and mould removal station. However, in the case of the carousel casting system it is advisable to provide a mould assembly and mould removal station which is separate from the solidification station.<br>
In an embodiment which deviates from the foundry plant mentioned first, a melting furnace with the associated dispensing ladle can be combined with two inventive devices in such a way that these are firmly assembled in a linear arrangement and that the dispensing ladle can be moved to and fro between said devices and the melting furnace. In this way, it is possible to simplify the transport and handling facilities.<br>
The above-mentioned latter foundry system can be varied in that a melting furnace with the associated dispensing ladle can be combined with a plurality of inventive devices and arranged in a circular formation in such a way that the dispensing ladle can be pivoted to and fro between the melting furnace and the devices. For a larger number of devices, this is more advantageous than a linear arrangement.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of rotary casting, wherein a mould with an upwardly pointing ingate end is mounted on a base plate, subsequently the finished mould is rotated together with the base plate by approximately 180° around a horizontal rotational axis, so that the ingate end points downwardly, a casting container with an upwardly positioned aperture end is filled with melt for one casting operation, subsequently the casting container, filled with melt, by means of its aperture end, is sealingly coupled to the downwardly pointing ingate end of the mould, the mould with the contacting casting container is rotated by approximately 180° around a horizontal axis, so that the melt reaches the mould, whereupon the casting container is released from the coupled position and removed from the mould.<br>
The present invention also provides a device for rotary casting having a mould mounted on a base plate and provided with an ingate pointing away from the upper face of the base plate, having bearing means for the base plate in which the base plate is supported so as to be rotatable around a horizontal rotational axis by at least 180°, having a casting container whose aperture can be positioned so as to point towards the upper face of the base plate, having moving means for the casting container by means of which the casting container with its aperture can be sealingly coupled to the downwardly pointing ingate of the mould and in the rotated position, can be removed from the upwardly pointing ingate of the mould and moving means by means of which the casting container is rotatable together with the mould around a horizontal rotational axis by at least 180°.<br>
A preferred embodiment of an inventive device is illustrated in the accompanying drawings and will be described below:<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of an inventive device. Figure 2 is a plan view of an inventive device.<br>
Figure 3 is a partial illustration of an inventive device in the form of a cross-section, in a first position.<br>
Figure 4 is a partial illustration of an inventive device in the form of a cross-section in a second position.<br>
Figure 5 is a mould with a coupled casting container in six different phases.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 will be described jointly below. An inventive device 11 comprises a bogie 12 which is provided with a base plate 13 and two cheek parts 14, 15. A shorter swivel pin 17 is supported in a bearing 16 in the cheek part 14. A longer swivel pin 19 is supported in a bearing 18 in the cheek part 15. A rotary drive 20 acts on the swivel pin 19. The two swivel pins are positioned co-axially on a horizontal rotational axis 21. Between the swivel pins 17, 19 there is inserted a multi-part base plate 22 which is rotatable together with the swivel pins around the rotational axis 2l On the base plate 22 there is assembled a mould 23 whose ingate end 36 points upwardly in the position as illustrated. Two setting cylinders 24, 25 act on side parts 26, 27 of the mould 23 which are displaceable relative to the base plate 22, and are securely connected to said base plate 22. Furthermore, the base plate 22 is shown to comprise a setting cylinder 28 which acts on an end part 29 of the mould 23, which end part 29 is pivotable relative to the base plate 22.<br>
A cover core 31 closes the mould at its upper end. Underneath the base plate 22 there is provided a setting cylinder 32 by means of which ejectors 33,34 passing through the base plate can be actuated. Furthermore, a column 38 securely connected to the base plate 22 is slid on to the swivel pin 19. The column 38 is telescopic and can be moved out towards the column axis 39 by means of a setting cylinder 45, with the<br>
moved-out position being shown. At said column 38 there is arranged a pivot arm 41 which is aligned substantially radially relative to the column axis 39 and which comprises a base plate 42 to which there is attached a casting container 43 whose aperture end 46 points downwardly. The pivot arm 41 can be rotated around the column axis 39 by means of a rotary motor 44. From the position as illustrated, the column 38 can be shortened towards the horizontal rotational axis 21, so that the casting container 43 with the lower aperture end 46 is lowered to the upper ingate end 36 of the mould 23. This movement takes place when the casting container is filled and when the mould 23 and the casting container 43 are rotated around the horizontal rotational axis 21 by 180° relative to the illustration. Prior filling of the casting container preferably takes place in a position wherein the casting container is rotated around the column axis 39 by 90° out of the position as illustrated in dashed lines in Figure 2 on the one hand and in a position wherein it is additionally rotated around the horizontal rotational axis by 180°. After the casting container 43 has been filled, it is pivoted by the pivot arm 41 back into the relative position relative to the mould 23 as illustrated in Figure 1, but with the entire assembly being rotated by 180° relative to the illustrated position. Thereafter, the column is shortened by the setting cylinder 45, so that the upper aperture end 46 of the casting container 43 rests against the downwardly positioned ingate end 36 of the mould 23. Thereafter, the entire assembly in its coupled position is rotated by 180: while the casting operation takes place. Thereafter, the casting container 43-by moving out the column 38 - is returned into the illustrated position. For mould removing purposes, the casting container 43 has to be pivoted back by approximately 90: into the position illustrated by dashed lines in Figure 2.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 will be described jointly. They each show the mould 23 and the casting container 43 in the configuration relative to each other referred to by the dashed lines in Figure 2. with the mould 23 being shown in a cross-section and the casting container 43 in a longitudinal section. The column 38 with the column axis 39 and the pivot arm 41 are only shown symbolically. In this embodiment, the column 38 cannot be shortened, but the casting container 43 can be displaced by means of a setting cylinder 45" relative to the pivot arm 41. The casting container 43 comprises a central longitudinal wall 49 which ends at a distance from the base 50. The mould 23 comprises a multi-part base plate 22, the side parts 26, 27, a plurality of inner cores 30 which are arranged in several layers one above the other on the base plate 22, as well as a cover core 31. The plurality of inner cores 30 are clamped in within a continuous power flow between the base plate 22 and the cover core 31. At the side parts 26, 27, there can be seen mould projections 47, 48 which hold some of the inner cores 30 additionally against the base plate 22. The side parts 26, 27 are displaceable by the setting cylinders 24, 25 relative to the base plate 22, with the suspension means of the setting cylinders not being shown here. The side parts 26, 27 can be removed from one another by means of the setting cylinders 24, -2.5. Thereafter, the mounting of the inner cores 30 on the base plate 22 can take place. Thereafter - as indicated by oppositely directed arrows - the side parts 26, 27 can be returned to enable same to reach the position as illustrated. Thereafter, the cover core 31 is laid down and held by locking elements 51, 52 which, for the purpose of mounting the cover core relative to the side parts 26, 27, can be pushed back and which, after the cover core ,31 has been laid down, can be moved forward into the position as illustrated in which they<br>
hold the cover core 31 relative to the inner cores 30 and the side parts 26, 27. In the base plate 22 it is possible to identify ejectors 35 which, for mould removing purposes, can be actuated by the setting cylinder 32. The base plate 22 and thus the entire mould 23 is rotatable around the horizontal axis 21 which is positioned perpendicularly relative to the drawing plane. This applies in the same way to the column 38 which supports the pivot arm 41 carrying the casting container 43. The casting container 43 can be displaced in parallel with the column axis 39 by means of the setting cylinder 45" relative to the pivot arm 41.<br>
Figure 4 shows the finish-assembled mould 23 in its position after completion. The casting container 43 is suspended upside-down, is removed by the setting cylinder 45" from the mould 23 and, by means of the pivot arm 41 on the column 38, it is pivoted by 90° out of its position for coupling and casting purposes.<br>
In Figure 4, the mould 23, together with the column 38 and the casting container 43, is rotated by 180° around the horizontal rotational axis 21 relative to the position according to Figure 3. The casting container 43 is still in the position relative to the mould 23 as shown in Figure 1, but is now upwardly open and is filled by a dispensing ladle 53 with melt 54 .. for one casting operation. Thereafter, the casting container 43 is pivoted by the pivot arm 41 relative to the column 38, so that the casting container 43 under the mould 23 comes to rest in front of the column 38. The casting container 43 is then lifted by means of the setting cylinder 45" against the mould 23, so that the casting container 43, by means of its aperture end 46, sealingly rests against the ingate end 36 of the mould 23. In its relative position achieved in this<br>
way, the mould 23, together with the coupled casting container 43, continues to be rotated around the horizontal rotational axis 21 by 180°. The melt 54 measured so as to comprise the correct amount for the mould cavity 37 of the mould 23, then flows through an ingate 55 into the mould cavity 37, with gas being able to escape from a gas exit 56 into the casting container 43.<br>
After completion of the rotational operation and thus of the casting operation, i.e. after the position of the mould 23 according to Figure 1 has again been reached, the casting container 43 is lifted by the setting cylinder 45" off the mould 23 and rotated by the pivot arm 41 back into the position as illustrated in Figure 3. After completion of the solidification process, the removal of the mould can commence by retracting the side parts 26, 27.<br>
Figure 5 shows different phases of the casting operation, and first, the details identifiable in all the individual illustrations will be mentioned once again. On the one hand, there are shown the mould 23 with the base plate 22, the side parts 26, 27, the inner cores 30 and the cover plate 31" which, together, from the mould cavity 37. In this embodiment, the side parts 26, 27 consist of a moulded material whereas the cover plate 31" is a permanent mould part. At the cover plate 31 it is possible to identify claws 57, 58 by means of which the casting container 43 can be fixed to the mould 23. In the cover plate 31" there are provided two ingate apertures 55, 59 and two gas exits 56, 60. The casting container 43 is shown to comprise an outer shell 61, a lining 62 and an intermediate wall 49, as well as the liquid melt 54.<br>
Illustration a shows the starting position after the casting container 43 has been coupled to the mould 23. It can be assumed that the melt can be filled into the casting container 43 to the left of the intermediate wall 49, so that oxide layers and the like are held back on this side of the intermediate wall 49, whereas to the right of the intermediate wall 49, there is formed an oxide-free melt skin.<br>
In illustration b, the assembly consisting of the mould 23 and the casting container 43 is rotated by 45° around the rotational axis 21. The melt 54 begins to enter the mould cavity through the ingate aperture 55. The melt impurities are held back by the intermediate wall 49. This position can be reached after 2 seconds for example.<br>
In illustration c, the assembly consisting of the mould 23 and the casting container 43 is rotated by 60° around the rotational axis 21. The melt 54 now, additionally, begins to enter the mould cavity through the ingate aperture 59. The melt impurities are still held back by the intermediate wall 49. This position can be reached after 4 seconds, for example.<br>
In illustration d, the assembly consisting of the mould 23 and the casting container 43 is rotated by 90° around the rotational axis 21. The melt 54 is now located below the intermediate wall 49. The melt impurities float above both ingate apertures 55, 59. This position can be reached after 5 seconds, for example.<br>
In illustration e, the assembly consisting of the mould 23 and the casting container 43 is rotated by the rotational axis 21.<br>
The melt 54 occupies the mould cavity 37 almost fully. This position can be reached after 8 seconds.<br>
In illustration f, the end of the casting operation has been reached after the unit consisting of the mould 23 and the casting container 43 has been rotated by 180° around the horizontal rotational axis 21. The melt impurities can by now have reached regions which act as risers and which are removed when the casting is machined. All gases entered the casting container through the gas exits 56, 60, so that the ingate was not disturbed at any time.<br><br>
