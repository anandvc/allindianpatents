Due to excellent activity, the compounds of formula I may be used in cultivation of all plants where infection by phytopathogenic fungi is not desired, e.g cereals, solanaceous crops, vegetables, legumes, apples, vine.<br>
The invention further provides a fungicidal composition which comprises an active ingredient, which is at least one compound of formula I as defined above, and one or more earners. A method of making such a composition is also provided which comprises bringing a compound of formula I as defined above into association with the camer(s). Such a composition may contain a single active ingredient or a mixture of several active ingredients of the present invention it is also envisaged that different isomers or mixtures of isomers may have different levels or spectra of<br><br>
11<br>
activity and thus compositions may comprise individual isomers or mixtures of isomers<br>
A composition according to the invention preferably contains from 0 5% to 95% by weight (w/w) of active ingredient(s)<br>
A earner in a composition according to the invention is any matenal with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated (which locus may be. for example, a plant, seed, soil, or water in which a plant grows), or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including material which is normally a gas but which has been compressed to form a liquid<br>
The compositions may be manufactured into e.g. emulsion oremulsifiable concentrates, solutions, oil in water emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, suspension concentrates, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, aerosols, micro-capsules, gels, tablets and other formulation types by well-established procedures These procedures include intensive mixing and/or milling of the active ingredients with other substances, such as fillers, solvents, solid earners, surface active compounds (surfactants), and optionally solid and/or liquid auxiiianes and/or adjuvants. The form of application such as spraying, atomizing, dispersing or pounng may be chosen like the compositions according to the desired objectives and the given circumstances<br>
Solvents may be aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. Solvesso® 200, substituted naphthalenes, phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl or dioctyl phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g cyciohexane or paraffins, alcohols and glycols as well as their ethers and esters, e g. ethanol, ethyleneglycol mono- and dimethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as N-methyI-2-pyrrolidone, ory-butyrolactone, higher aikyi pyrrolidones, e g. n-octylpyrrolidone or cyclohexylpyrrolidone, epoxidized plant oil esters, e.g methylated coconut or soybean oil ester and water Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable<br>
Solid earners, which may be used for dusts, wettable powders, water dispersibie granules, or granules,.may be mineral fillers, such as calcite, tale, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. The physical properties may be improved by addition of highly dispersed silica gel or polymers Carriers for granules may be porous<br><br>
12<br>
material, e g. pumice, kaolin, sepiolite, bentonite, non-sorptive earners may be calcite or sand Additionally, a multitude of pre-granulated inorganic or organic matenals may be used, such as dolomite or crushed plant residues<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surfactant facilitates this process of dilution Thus, preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surfactant For example, the composition may contain at two or more earners, at least one of which is a surfactant<br>
Surfactants may be nonionic, anionic, cationic or zwitterionic substances with good dispersing, emulsifying and wetting properties depending on the nature of the compound according to general formula I to be formulated Surfactants may also mean mixtures of individual surfactants<br>
Wettable powders of this invention suitably contain 5 to 90% w/w of active ingredient, and in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 to10% w/w of dispersing and wetting agents and, where necessary, 0 to 10% w/w of stabilizer(s) and/or other additives such as penetrants or stickers Dusts may be formulated as a dust concentrate    ' having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and may be diluted in the field with further solid earner to give a composition usually containing 0.5 to 10% w/w of active ingredient Water dispersible granules and granules of this invention typically have a size between 0 15 mm and 2 0 mm and may be manufactured by a variety of techniques Generally, these types of granules will contain 0 5 to 90% w/w active ingredient and 0 to 20% w/w of additives such as stabilizer, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents   Emuisifiable concentrates may contain, in addition to a solvent or a mixture of solvents, 1 to 80% w/v active ingredient, 2 to 20% w/v emulsifiers and 0 to 20% w/v of other additives such as stabilizers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are suitably milled so as to obtain a stable, non-sedimenting flowable product and preferably contain 5 to 75% w/v active ingredient, 0.5 to 15% w/v of dispersing agents, 0.1 to 10% w/v of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 to 10% w/v of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which<br><br>
13<br>
the active ingredient is substantially insoluble, certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation and crystalization, or as antifreeze agents.<br>
Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting the formulated product according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the invention<br>
Of particular interest in enhancing the duration of the protective activity of the compounds of this invention is the use of a earner which will provide slow release of the pesticidal compounds into the environment of a plant which is to be protected.<br>
The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be increased by including an adjuvant in the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient but is not itself significantly biologically active The adjuvant can either be included in the formulation as a coformulant or carrier, or can be added to the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient<br>
As a commodity, the compositions preferably may be in a concentrated form, whereas the end user generally employs diluted compositions The compositions may be diluted to a concentration down to 0.001% of active ingredient The doses usually are in the range from 0.01 to 10 kg a.i./ha<br>

The following examples further illustrate the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited solely to the particular examples given below.<br><br>
18<br>
Example 1<br>
Resolution of 1.1,1-trif!uoroprop-2-yiamine<br>
To D(-)-tartanc acid ( 25 5 g, 0.17 mol) in methanol ( 250 ml) is added racemic tnflucroisopropyl amine ( 38 g, 0 34 mo!) as a methanolic solution ( 100 mi) After the addition of half of the amine a white precipitate forms After the addition is complete the mixture is bnefly heated to reflux It is then allowed to cool to ambient The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and the salt is isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo The obtained product (36 g) is then recrystallized from boiling methanol (170 ml) to yield 29 0 g of the salt which is finally recrystallized from 140 ml methanol to furnish a final yield of 25 5 g (S)-tnfluoroisopropyl amine D(-)-tartrate<br>
For the preparation of the target compound the amine is then liberated from the salt by placing the salt in a distillation apparatus and carefully adding aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide with heating and stirring<br>
Liberation of the D(-)-tartrate gives nse to an amine with a negative optical rotation [a]D27 -3 67 ( c = 10, methanol) It is noteworthy that the optical rotation inverts for the hydrochlorides [a]D27 +4.26 ( c= 10, methanol)<br>
Determination of the enantomeric purity<br>
In a small vial approx. 7 mg of the tartrate is dissolved in 0.6 ml CDCI3. Aqueous sodium hydroxide (50%, 3 drops) is added and the two phase mixture is shaken vigorously for 10 seconds. The organic layer is then separated via a pasteur pipette and filtered through a small plug of cotton directly into the NMR-tube. (S)-(+)-1-(9-anthryl)-2,2,2-trifluoro ethanol (21 mg) is added and the 1H-NMR spectrum (400 MHz ) is recorded . The ratio of the enantiomers is determined by integration of the signals of the methyl group at 1.20 ppm ( R-enantiomer) and 1.17ppm(S-enantiomer) The enantiomenc excess of the S-enantiomer is &gt; 85 %<br>
Example 2<br>
5-Chloro-6-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)-7-N-[(S)-(1,1,1-trifluoroprop-2-yIamino)]-1,2,4-triazolo[1.5a]pyrimidine<br>
A mixture of (S)-1,1,1-trifluoroprop-2-ylamine (4.2 mmoles) obtained according to example 1 and dtchloromethane (10 ml) is added to a mixture of 5,7-<br><br>
19<br>
dichloro-6-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl}-1,2,4-triazolo[1.5a]pyrimidine (1 4 mmoles, obtained from diethyl 2,4,6-trifluorophenylmalonate and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole as described rn EP 0 770 615) and dichloromethane (30 ml) under stirnng The reaction mixture is stirred 16 hours at room temperature subsequently washed two times with 1 N hydrochtonc acid and once with water The organic layer is separated, dned with anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure Treatment of the resulting light brown oil with tert -butyl methyl ether (50 ml) yields beige crystals having a melting point of 117-121 °C and an enantiomenc excess of &gt; 98 %<br>
Examples 3-18<br>
The following examples (Table 1, structure and melting point) are synthesized analogously to Examples 1 and 2<br><br>
(CH* indicates that the compound has an enantiomeric excess of at least 80 % with respect to the (S)-isomer)<br><br><br><br>
Biological Investigations<br>
A.       Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration by Test Compounds in the Serial Dilution Test with Vanous Phytopathogenic Fungi<br>
The MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) value, which indicates the lowest concentration of the active ingredient in the growth medium which causes a total inhibition of myecelial growth, is determined by senal dilution tests using Microtiter plates with 24 or 48 wells per plate. The dilution of the test compounds in the nutrient solution and the distnbution to the wells is carned out by a TECAN RSP 5000 Robotic Sample Processor The following test compound concentrations are used. 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.39, 0.78, 1 56, 3.13, 6.25, 12 50, 25 00, 50.00 and 100 00 mg/ml. For preparation of the nutrient solution, V8 vegetable jutce (333 ml) is mixed with calcium carbonate (4.95 g), centrifuged, the supernatant (200 ml) diluted with water (800 ml) and autoclaved at 121 0C for 30 min<br><br>
21<br>
The respective inocula (Altemaria solani, ALTESO, Botrytis cinerea, BOTRCI; Gurgnardia bidwellii, GUIGBI, Cochliobulus sattvus. COCHSA, Leptosphaena nodorum, LEPTNO, Phytophthora infestans, PHYTIN, Magnaporthe grisea f sp oryzae, PYRIOR, Pyrenophora teres, PYRNTE; Phomopsis viticola, PHOPVl, Pseudopeziza tracheiphila, PSEUTR, Rhizoctonia solani, RHIZSO,) are added into the wells as spore suspensions (50 ml, 5x105/ml) or agar slices (6 mm) of an agar culture of the fungus<br>
After 6-12 days incubation at suitable temperatures (18-25°C), the MIC values are determined by visual inspection of the plates The results of these tests in comparison with the corresponding racemic compound are shown in tables il to IV<br>

B.        Determination of the efficacy of Test Compounds in greenhouse trials The efficacy of the (R/S)-racemate and the (S)-enantiomer was also<br>
investigated in-vivo in greenhouse tnals against several cereal diseases and<br>
diseases of dicotyledonous crops The curative and residual activity as well as the<br>
systemicity of both the compounds was assessed<br>
Both showed fungicidal activity against the diseases tested (Tables V to<br>
