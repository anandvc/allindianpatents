				<td>ALCOHOL BASED ANTI-MICROBIAL COMPOSITIONS WITH COSMETIC<br>
APPEARANCE<br>
This application is related to my U.S. patent applications, Serial Numbers 08/XXX,XXX, entitled ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOSITION; and O8/YYY,YYY, entitled LOW TACK LOTION, GELS AND CREAMS, all concurrently filed herewith and which are assigned to assignee of the present invention and incorporated toy reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
The present invention relates to anti-microbial compositions, more particularly to alcohol-containing eationic antimicrobial compounds that are compatible with emollients and cationic compounds thereby providing lotion-like appearance and properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alcohols and alcohol-containing mixtures are known-to possess bactericidal activity and to prevent nosocomial. infections in hospital settings between patients, nurses and doctors. The use of alcohol based compositions is declining due to their inherent dehydrating properties which is caused by the denaturing and delipidizxng of the skin"s lipid molecules. It is appreciated in the art that lipids in stratum corneum. of the skin are important in the barrier properties.<br>
In an attempt to address the dehydration and delipidization problem, attempts have been made to minimize the dehydration effects of the alcohol systems. US Patent Number 5,288,486 discloses the use of polymeric viscosifying agents which have been added to. the compositions to reduce evaporation and provide moisturization. While this approach has reduced the evaporation rate of the alcohol, the compositions lack the feel, moisturization and non-greasy texture sought by medical professionals.<br>
It would be highly desirable to provide an effective alcohol-containing antimicrobial composition that possesses the feel and moisturizing attributes of a hand cream and lotion. It is also desirable to use chemical ingredients that provide the appearance of moisturizing products to overcome the perceived drying of topical, alcohol-containing formulations. These two aspects in any product or a formulation would provide multi-functions, such as antibacterial efficacy, mildness, moisturization and protection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a highly effective antimicrobial composition that also possesses moisturizing attributes and does not become greasy to the touch. In particular, one aspect of the invention provides an aqueous antimicrobial composition comprising alcohol, an effective amount of a antimicrobial compound, particularly cationic compounds, and a carbomer polymer, the composition having a viscosity of greater than 5,0CC centipoise.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention the antimicrobial composition additionally is provided with an effective amount of phenylethyl dimethicone, stearoxy-trimethylsilane and stearyl alcohol to provide an opaque, milky white lotion.<br>
In a third embodiment of the invention the<br>
antimicrobial formulation additionally contains an effective amount of cetyl lactate and (C12-C15) alkyl lactates and/or an effective amount of cyclomethicone. The addition of these, ingredients allows the formulation to incorporate more essential oils and volatile compounds which improves the overall performance of the composition.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for disinfecting surfaces by contacting the surface with an effective amount of the antimicrobial composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antimicrobial alcohol-containing compositions containing a carbomer polymer, a cationic antimicrobial compound and a preferably a silicone wax. A complexing agent may additionally be provided. The balance of the composition is water, typically from about 15 to about 40 percent by weight.<br>
The alcohols useful in the present invention include n-propyl and iso-propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. The alcohols are typically employed at a level of from about 40 to about 80 percent by volume, preferably from about 60 to about 75 percent by volume. Ethyl alcohol is typically used in the present invention from about 2 0 to about 5 5 weight percent, preferably from about 30 to about 50 and moat preferably from about 35 to about 48 weight percent. When a mixture of alcohols are employed ethyl alcohol is typically used from 20-55 weight percent, iso-propyl alcohol from about 5 to about 30 weight percent and rs-propyl alcohol from about 2 to about 40 weight percent. More preferably the amount of ethyl alcohol is from about 30 to about 50 weight percent, iso-propyl alcohol from about 8 to about 20 weight percent and n-propyl alcohol from about 4 to about 20 weight percent.<br>
The antimicrobial cationic compositions suitable for use in the present invention include cationic compounds which are well know in the art. Suitable compounds include benzethonium chloride, bensalkonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium chloride, bisdequalinium chloride, cetylalkonium<br>
chloride, methyl benzethonium chloride, phenoctide, tibe2onium iodide, triclobisonium chloride, laurolinium acetate, mixtures thereof and the like. The present invention overcomes the destability problem encountered when cationic compounds are mixed with carbomer polymers. The total cationic compound level is typically from about 0.05 to about 0.5, preferably from about 0.08 to about 0.3 percent by weight, and most preferably from about 0.09 to about 0,2 weight percent.<br>
The present invention also employs thickening agents of acrylic acid which are crosslinked with an unsaturated polyfunctional agent such as polyallyl ether of sucrose. These acrylic acid functionalized polymers, commonly known as carbomers, are disclosed in US Pat. Nos. 2,798,053 and 3,133,865 herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The selection of the proper carbomer provides the antimicrobial formulation with the desired viscosity values.<br>
In order to have the desired feel the viscosity of the formulation must have a value of greater than about 5,000 centipoise. More preferably the formulations will have a viscosity of from about 9,000 to about 22,000 and most preferably from about 11,000 to about 20,000 centipoise as measured at 25CC.<br>
A thickening agent, which is an addition agent comprised of an acrylic acid polymer crosslinked with an unsaturated polyallyl ether of sucrose is employed. The polymers are used in an amount sufficient to obtain a gelled composition of viscosity in the desired range.<br>
A number of these polymers, known in the art as carbomers are commercially marketed by B.F. Goodrich,<br>
(Cleveland, Ohio) such as CARBOFOL® 934, 940 and 941; and by R.I.T.A. (Crystal Lake, IL)as ACRITAMER® 934,940 and 941,<br>
respectively- Typically the carbomer compounds are used from about 0.2 to about 2.0 percent by weight, and are preferably employed at a level of from about 0.4 to about 0.7 by weight of the total antimicrobial composition.<br>
A preferred carbomer polymer, among several preferred carboraers,is R.I.T.A, ACRITAMER® 505E, a polyvinyl carboxy polymer crosslinKed with ethers of pcntacrythritol.<br>
ACRITAMER® 505B is preferred as a gelling agent or viscosity enhancer because it provides a transparent or translucent gel in the present invention.<br>
The most preferred carbomer is ULTREZ® 10 (available from BF Goodrich)an oil in water emulsion of a modified acrylic copolymer comprising of a major portion of a monoolefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer or its anhydride having a length of from about 3 to 6 carbon atoms and a minor portion of a C1-C30 chain acrylate or methacrylate ester monomer wherein the carboxylic acid or its anhydride is from about 80 to about 99% by weight and the a C8-C30.; chain acrylate or methacrylate ester monomer is from about 1% to about 20% by weight. The polymer is described in US Pat. Number 5,004,598, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The present invention provides surprising and unexpected results in that contrary to the disclosure provided in its literature,. ULTREZ® 10 provides excellent viscosity in the presence of ions. This is surprising in that ULTREZ® 10 product literature discloses that the product is not stable, and should be used in combination with other polymers which have good performance in the presence of ions.<br>
Optionally other thickening agents nay also be employed so long as the resulting composition does not leave a<br>
residue on the skin that is overly sticky and has acceptable tactile characteristics, suitable agents are known in the art and include gums, substituted gums such as propylene glycol ether of guar gums, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
In addition to the above identified materials in the formulation it is highly desirable to include other ingredients in order to enhance the performance or feeling of the composition. These ingredients include carrier materials such as phenylethyl dimethicone (commercially<br>
available as SILSOFT® PEDM), dimethicone, and cyclomethicone. Phenylethyl dimethicone is employed of from about 0.1 to about 2.0 percent by weight, preferably from 0.1 to about 1.0 and most preferably from 0.25 to about 0.5 weight percent. Cyclomethicone is typically used from about 0.6 to about 5.0, preferably from about 0.75 to about 2.0 and most preferably from about 0.8 to about 1.5 weight percent. The addition of the carrier component improves the stability of the dispersion of the formulation and allows a stable lotion formulation. For example, the elimination of the carrier agent will allow the silicone wax (stearcxy-trimethyl silane) to be deposited on the hands of the user.<br>
Other useful ingredients include lubricants such as phenylethyl dimethicone, a polymeric silicone, which is advantageously employed to disperse other ingredients. In absence of this compound, waxes such as Dow Corning Wax® 580,(a mixture of stearyloxytrimethylsilane and stearyl alcohol) was found to be incompatible with other ingredients. When such formulations are applied on to hands, "flaking" was observed. Flaking is generally believed to occur due to the crystallization of the wax upon the quick evaporation of low volatile components, i.e. the alcohol and cyclomethicone.<br>
Optionally, the present invention also employs complexing agents at a level of from 0.05 to about 0.5 percent by weight. Suitable complexing agents include ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and various salts of EDTA, including sodium, disodium, potassium, calcium and the like.<br>
In order to provide skin compatible and non-irritating formulation pH adjusters are employed to gel the carbomex and provide a pH that is neutral to slightly acid (pH about 5.7-about 7.0). Other ingredients include essential oils such as lemon grass oil, Australian tree tea oil, thyme oil, lavender oil, clove oil and the like. The essential oils are used at a level of from. about 0.1 to about 5.0%. The essential oils increase the emoiliency, penetration and moisturization properties of the present invention.<br>
In the present invention, the stability to the addition of other ingredients such as essential oils, waxes, high boiling solvents such as iso-propyl alcohol (82.50C), n-propyl alcohol (97.2°C) is relatively low. The instability manifests itself in the reduction of the viscosity of the formulation and is also called "load" on to the carbomer. Due to this load, particularly at high alcohol concentrations a phenomenon known as "balling" is observed upon application to the hands. Balling is the process of forming small balls believed to be consisting of carbomer and other ingredients of the formulations. similar observations are not made when the high alcohol content product is applied after rinsing the hands with water followed by toweling, it is believed that balling occurs when there is a limited amount of water present in the formulation. In these limited water circumstances it is believed that the carbomer becomes hydrated with skin moisture while icnic molecules acting on carbomer and skin<br>
electrolytes, the load on the carbomer becomes too great which results in the balling of the carbomer and other inqredients in the hand.<br>
Due to the high alcohol levels found in the formulations, the present invention is effective as a dirt indicators and dirt remover. However, unlike other alcohol-based formulations the present invention is also capable of providing moisturize to the hands due to the incorporation of high levels of emollients and natural oils. Formulations containing higher amounts of water (20-40% by volume) and lower percentage of alcohols (50-60% by volume) didn"t exhibit such a phenomenon but observed an improvement in the lotion appearance, i.e. opaque, milky white appearance.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the incorporation of a wax enhances the lotion appearance to a buttery look of base formula with ULTREZ® 10. For example, stearoxy trimethyl stearate is typically used from about 0.01 to about 1.0, preferably from 0.02 to about 0.5 and most preferably from 0.025 to about 0.1 weight percent. Cetyl iactate is used from about 0.3 to about 1.5, preferably from about 0.4 to about i.O and most preferably from 0.4 to about 0.8 weight percent. C12-C15 alkyl lactates are used from about 0.2 to about 2.0, preferably from 0.4 to about 1.5 and most preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.25 weight percent. Experimental formulations have revealed preferred components and their proportions to obtain stable formulations without flaking and/or balling.<br>

The amount of highly volatile substances such as alcohols, like ethyl alcohol and other components such as ULTREZ 10, Dow Corning® 580 Wax, cyclomethicone, phenylethyl dimethicone and essential oils, are dependent on the load. The level of these components is an important factor to obtain stable and formulations having the desired viscosity. The preferred ratio of the components of the invention are silicone wax, such as stearoxytrimethylsiiane 0.1%/ phenylethyl dimethicone 1.0%/ carbomer 2.3%/ cyclomethicone 5.6% with the remainder of the composition containing primarily alcohol and water, with other ingredients provided at lower levels.<br>

These compositions are not limited to the cleansing of surfaces but may also be extended to scrubs, hand disinfectants, incontinence, home health care, wound healing and wound care products and consumer products. In particular the present invention is useful in disinfecting hands, infected sites, presurgical cutaneous sites, acne sites and injection sites, such where vaccines, shots, and catheters are to be provided. An effective amount of the composition is applied to the area which is to be disinfecteo. Typically, from about 0.5 to.about 10 milliliters, preferably from about 1.0 to about 8, and most preferably form about 2.5 to about, 5 millilitersof the<br>
antimicrobial composition is applied. This amount of the antimicrobial composition is found to be" effective, to provide a loglc reduction of 2 or more in the microbe population.<br>
In addition the present invention is well suited for disinfecting hard surfaces such as tables, countertcps, operation room equipment and the like. The formulations of the present invention are non-irritating and not skin sensitizers. Surprisingly and unexpectedly the compositions of the present invention were also found to be moisturizing.<br>
This is surprising in that the compositions contain high levels, more than 50% by weight, of alcohol which are known<br>
to be drying to the skin.<br>

Formulation 12 Instead of the 70% ethyl alcohol used in Formulation 11, the 70% was made up of ethyl alcohol/iso-propyl alcohol/n-propyl alcohol in a 40:25:5 ratio. The viscosity of the resulting formulation was 8,820. Example 4<br>
Formulation 13 A formulation was prepared with the<br>
following components: ethyl alcohol 62; ULTREZ® 10 0.55; glycerin 0.5; cyclomethicone (245) 1.25; dimethicone (225) 1.0; Dow Corning® 58C wax 0.025; SILSOFT® PEDM 0.2; CERAPHYL-41 1.0; CERAFKYL-28 0.5; phenoxyethanol 0.5, benzalkor.ium chloride (50% active) 0.2, PHOSPHOLXPID CDM 0.05; GERMABEN-II 0.1; AMP-95. The viscosity of the formulation was 17,300.<br>
Formulation 14 Formulation 13 was used as a standard<br>
formulation using ethyl alcohol 70, ULTREZ®-10 0.6, glycerin 1.5, cyclomethiccne (245) 0.5, dirr.ethicore (245) 1.0, Dow Corning® 580 wax C.25, SILSOFT® PEDM l.0, CERAPHYL-28 0.5, CERAPHYL-41 0.5. The phenoxyethanol 0.5, benzaikomun chloride (50% active) 3.2, PHOSPHOLIPID CDM 0.05; GERMAL PLUS 0.1 was replaced with chiorhexidine gluconate (208) solution) at 0.5%. The resulting solution turned watery, with a viscosity of less than about 100.<br>
Formulation 15 Formulation 14 was used and the chiorhexidine gluconate was replaced with about 0.1 COSMOCIL®. The resulting solution had a viscosity of less than about 100.<br>
Compositions containing ULTREZ® 10 with charged molecules like bensethonium chloride and benzalkonium chloride at different concentrations did nor demonstrate any significant stability or viscosity effects. Other antimicrobial compounds such as guanides, including<br>
chlorhexidine glucor.ate and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB, COSMOCIL®) at different concentrations destabilised the compositions, resulting in the undesirably low viscosities. Example 5<br>
Compositions of the present invention were tested for irritation and sensitivity. The following,formulations were prepared: formulation 16 deionized water 28.7, ethyl alcohol 62,<br>
ULTRE2® 10 0.45, glycerin 0.5, cyclomethicone 1.25, Dow Corning® 580 Wax 0.025, 3ILSOFT® PEDM 0.2, CERAPHYL®-28 0.5, CERAFHYL®-41 1.0, AYP 95 (pH adjuster) as needed, 190 6 AD MOD I 0.1. Formulation 17 deionized water 27.7, ethyl alcohol 62,<br>
ULTREZ® 10 0.55, glycerin 0.5, cyclomethicone 1.25, Dow Corning 580 Wax 0-025, SILSOFT® PEDM 0.2, CERAE&gt;KYL®-28 0.5, CERAPKYL®-41 1.0, AM? 95 (pH adjuster) as needed, 1906 AD MOD I 0.06, phenoxy ethanol 0.5, benzalkonium chloride (508 active) 0.16, benzethonium chloride 0.08, PHOSFHOLIPID CDM 0.05, GERMALL Plus 0.1, GERMABEN II 0.1.<br>
Prior to study the subjects were screened to assure thar they met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Each subject was provided with a schedule of the study activities. The Induction Phase consisted of nine (9) consecutive applications of -he study material and subsequent: evaluations of the study sites were assessed, prior to the applications of the patches, the sites were outlined with a skin marker, e.g., gentian violet. The subjects were required to remove the patches approximately 24 hours after application. The subjects returned tc the facility at 48 hour intervals to have the sites evalcaec<br>
and identical patches reapplied. following the ninth evaluation, the subjects were dismissed for a 10-14 day rest period. After the rest period, the challenge period was initiated during the 6th week of the study with the identical patches applied to the sites previously unexposed to the study. These patches were removed by subjects after 24 hours and the sites graded after additional 24-hour and 48 hour periods. The gradings were done 48 and 72 hours after application. To be considered a completed case, a subject must have nine (9) applications and no less than eight (8) subsequent readings during induction and one (1) product application and two (2) readings during the challenge. Of the 101 subjects that completed the study, there was no evidence of sensitization or irritation tc the formulations. Example 6<br>
The two formulations employed in Example 5 above were investigated to determine their moisturizing capabilities. Fifteen subjects appliea the formulations to the dry skin on the lateral aspect of the lower leg. The moisturizattion of the skin was measured using the SKICON® Skin Surface Hydrometer. The results indicated that Formulation 17 behaved similarly to the untreated control indicating that the formulation was non-drying. Formulation 16 was found to be similar to Formulation 17 but slightly more drying. 3oth formulations were surprising in that for formulations containing high levels of alcohol the products were nor. found to possess significant drying effects.<br>
