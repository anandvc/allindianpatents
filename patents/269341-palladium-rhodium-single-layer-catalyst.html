Description<br>
The invention relates to a three-way catalyst with outstanding catalytic activity and<br>
aging stability for the cleaning of the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines.<br>
Three-way catalysts are used in large numbers for the cleaning of the exhaust gases of<br>
internal combustion engines operated under essentially stoichiometric conditions. They<br>
are capable of converting the three significant pollutants from the engine, specifically<br>
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, simultaneously to harmless<br>
components. Frequently, double-layer catalysts are used, which enable a separation of<br>
different catalytic procedures and hence an optimal balance of the catalytic effects in the<br>
two layers. Catalysts of this kind are described, for example, in EP 0 885 650 and<br>
EP 1046 423.<br>
Double-layer catalysts have the disadvantage that their production is more expensive<br>
than that of single-layer catalysts. Moreover, double-layer catalysts have a tendency to<br>
an increased exhaust gas backpressure compared to single-layer catalysts, which is at<br>
the expense of the performance of the internal combustion engines and the fuel<br>
consumption thereof. There have therefore always been efforts to obtain the good<br>
catalytic properties of double-layer catalysts by means of single-layer catalysts, as far as<br>
possible without tradeoffs. Single-layer three-way catalysts are known, for example,<br>
from WO 98/09726, EP 1 138 382 and EP 1 541 220.<br>
The constantly rising demands on reducing the emissions of internal combustion<br>
engines necessitate constant further development of the catalysts with regard to catalytic<br>
activity, aging stability and production costs. It was therefore an object of this invention<br>
to provide a catalyst which has further-reduced lightoff temperatures and improved<br>
thermal stability coupled with lower production costs compared to the prior art<br>
catalysts.<br>
This object is achieved by a catalyst according to the claims. The catalyst has a single<br>
catalytically active coating on an inert catalyst support of ceramic or metal. The catalyst<br><br>
is characterized in that it comprises an active aluminum oxide and a first and a second<br>
cerium/zirconium mixed oxide, the first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide being activated<br>
with rhodium and having a higher zirconium oxide content than the second<br>
cerium/zirconium mixed oxide which is catalytically activated with palladium.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the wording "a support material is activated with<br>
a catalytically active element" means that the catalytically active element has been<br>
deposited in highly disperse form on the surface of the support material accessible by<br>
impregnation.<br>
By virtue of the combination of the properties mentioned, the catalyst has very good<br>
lightoff performance and possesses a high thermal stability. Moreover, the catalyst has a<br>
low exhaust gas backpressure and the production costs thereof are lower than those of a<br>
corresponding double-layer catalyst.<br>
The active aluminum oxide and the cerium/zirconium mixed oxides are introduced into<br>
the coating as pulverulent solids. The thermal stability of both mixed oxides can be<br>
improved by stabilizing them with at least one oxide of the elements selected from the<br>
group consisting of iron, manganese, tin, titanium, silicon, yttrium, lanthanum,<br>
praseodymium, neodymium, samarium and mixtures thereof. The amount of the doping<br>
elements, calculated as the oxide, is preferably between 1 and 15 and especially<br>
between 5 and 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the stabilized mixed oxide.<br>
The first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide preferably has a weight ratio of cerium oxide to<br>
zirconium oxide of 0.5 to 0.1, and the second cerium/zirconium mixed oxide preferably<br>
has a weight ratio of cerium oxide to zirconium oxide of 0.8 to 1.2. The specific surface<br>
area of these materials is advantageously within a range between 50 and 100 m2/g.<br>
The active aluminum oxide may be stabilized with 1 to 10% by weight of lanthanum<br>
oxide, based on the total weight of aluminum oxide plus lanthanum oxide. A further<br>
improvement in the thermal stability of the catalyst can be achieved when active<br>
aluminum oxide and the cerium/zirconium mixed oxides are additionally impregnated<br>
with strontium oxide and/or barium oxide.<br><br>
Usually, the catalyst support is a honeycomb with a volume V, which has parallel flow<br>
channels for the exhaust gases of the internal combustion engine, the wall surfaces of<br>
the flow channels being coated with the catalyst and the concentration of the palladium<br>
based on the volume of the honeycomb being between 0.1 and 10g and the<br>
concentration of the rhodium between 0.01 and 1 g. In a particular embodiment of the<br>
catalyst, the first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide may also be catalytically activated with<br>
palladium in addition to rhodium. In a further embodiment, both cerium/zirconium<br>
mixed oxides may also be activated with platinum.<br>
The noble metal concentrations which should actually be employed depend on the<br>
desired pollutant conversions. The highest concentration values reported here are<br>
required to comply with the strict emissions standards for SULEVs (SULEV = Super<br>
Ultra-Low Emission Vehicles).<br>
To coat the catalyst support with the catalytically active layer, it is necessary to prepare<br>
a coating suspension which comprises all constituents of the desired catalytic layer<br>
either directly or in the form of precursors thereof which are converted to their ultimate<br>
form by the final calcination of the coating.<br>
The two cerium/zirconium mixed oxides can be coated separately with precursor<br>
compounds of rhodium or palladium by known impregnation processes. Preference is<br>
given to using the water-soluble compounds rhodium nitrate and palladium nitrate. The<br>
materials thus precoated can then be suspended in water together with aluminum oxide.<br>
The suspension is ground in wet form until the solids of the suspension have a mean<br>
particle size of about 3 to 5 µm. Thereafter, the honeycombs are coated with this<br>
suspension by known methods, dried and calcined. This production process guarantees<br>
that palladium and rhodium are deposited separately on different support materials.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide is<br>
first suspended in water. A solution of a precursor compound of rhodium, preferably<br>
rhodium nitrate, is added to this suspension. Thereafter, the pH of the suspension is<br>
raised to a value of about 6 with a base, for example tetraethylammonium hydroxide<br>
(TEAH), in order to precipitate the rhodium nitrate. Subsequently, the second<br>
cerium/zirconium mixed oxide is suspended in the suspension and a solution of a<br><br>
precursor compound of palladium is added. This lowers the pH of the suspension into<br>
the strongly acidic range. Further addition of a base raises the pH back to about 6 and<br>
thus precipitates the palladium onto both mixed oxides. Thereafter, aluminum oxide is<br>
added to the suspension and the suspension is finally, as already described, ground and<br>
applied to the catalyst support body. The catalyst thus prepared does not contain any<br>
alkaline earth metals.<br>
Alternatively, a basic solution of barium hydroxide and/or strontium oxide can first be<br>
initially charged. The first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide is added to this solution and<br>
suspended in the solution. Thereafter, a solution of rhodium nitrate, for example, is<br>
added to the suspension, which precipitates the rhodium onto the first cerium/zirconium<br>
mixed oxide owing to the basicity of the suspension. Thereafter, the second<br>
cerium/zirconium mixed oxide is supplied to the suspension, followed by a palladium<br>
nitrate solution. Finally, aluminum oxide is added to the suspension and the suspension,<br>
as already described, is ground and applied to the catalyst support body. Use of barium<br>
hydroxide or strontium hydroxide as the base for the precipitation of rhodium nitrate<br>
causes barium oxide or strontium oxide to remain in the coating after the final<br>
calcination.<br>
In the catalysts manufactured according to the last two production variants, both<br>
rhodium and palladium are present on the particles of the first cerium/zirconium mixed<br>
oxide.<br>
The invention is illustrated in detail hereinafter with reference to the examples and the<br>
figures. The figures show:<br>
Figure 1: Comparison of the lightoff temperatures of a prior art catalyst with catalysts<br>
according to different embodiments<br>
Figure 2: Maximum conversions of the catalysts of figure 1<br>
Comparative example<br>
A catalyst according to EP 1 541 220 was prepared. To this end, a suspension of barium<br>
sulfate in water was first prepared. 1% by weight nitric acid was added to this<br><br>
suspension and the pH was thus lowered to about 5. Thereafter, a γ-aluminum oxide<br>
stabilized with 3% by weight of lanthanum oxide was added, followed by a<br>
cerium/zirconium mixed oxide with a zirconium oxide content of 50% by weight, and<br>
the pH was kept approximately constant by means of nitric acid during the addition.<br>
After the addition of 10% by weight of sucrose, the suspension was ground, and then<br>
palladium nitrate and rhodium nitrate were added. After a maturing time of one hour, a<br>
cordierite honeycomb was coated with the suspension, dried and calcined. The<br>
honeycomb had a cell density of 93 cm"2, a diameter of 14.4 cm and a length of<br>
10.2 cm. The finished catalyst contained the following amounts of coating:<br>
80	g/1	of lanthanum-stabilized aluminum oxide<br>
75	g/1	of cerium/zirconium mixed oxide (70% by weight of zirconium oxide)<br>
0.18	g/1	of rhodium (on all solid components)<br>
0.88	g/1	of palladium (on all solid components)<br>
Example 1<br>
An inventive catalyst was prepared as follows:<br>
A zirconium-rich cerium/zirconium mixed oxide (70% by weight of zirconium oxide)<br>
was suspended in water, and then rhodium nitrate was stirred into the suspension.<br>
TEAH was used to raise the pH of the suspension back to a value of about 6. Thereafter,<br>
a cerium/zirconium oxide with 50% by weight of zirconium oxide was added to the<br>
suspension, and palladium nitrate was stirred into the suspension. The pH was raised to<br>
6 again with TEAH, before a y-aluminum oxide stabilized with 3% by weight of<br>
lanthanum oxide was added to the suspension. Subsequently, the suspension was ground<br>
and a honeycomb was coated therewith as in the comparative example, dried and<br>
calcined. The finished catalyst contained the following amounts of coating:<br>
80 g/1 of lanthanum-stabilized aluminum oxide<br>
35 g/1 of first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide (70% by weight of zirconium<br>
oxide)<br>
40 g/1 of second cerium/zirconium mixed oxide (50% by weight of zirconium<br>
oxide)<br><br>
0.18 g/1 of rhodium (on first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide)<br>
0.88 g/1 of palladium (on first and second cerium/zirconium mixed oxide)<br>
Example 2<br>
A further inventive catalyst was prepared as follows:<br>
Barium hydroxide was dissolved in water. The cerium/zirconium mixed oxide with 70%<br>
by weight of zirconium oxide was suspended in this solution, and rhodium nitrate was<br>
added to the suspension. Thereafter, the cerium/zirconium oxide with 50% by weight of<br>
zirconium oxide was dispersed in the suspension, and palladium nitrate was stirred into<br>
the suspension. After the addition of the aluminum oxide, the pH was adjusted to the<br>
value of 6 with acetic acid. Finally, the suspension was ground and a honeycomb was<br>
coated therewith, dried and calcined as in the comparative example. The finished<br>
catalyst contained the following amounts of coating:<br>
80 g/1 of lanthanum-stabilized aluminum oxide<br>
2 g/1 of barium oxide<br>
35 g/1 of first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide (70% by weight of zirconium<br>
oxide)<br>
40 g/1 of second cerium/zirconium mixed oxide (50% by weight of zirconium<br>
oxide)<br>
0.18 g/1 of rhodium (on first cerium/zirconium mixed oxide)<br>
0.88 g/1 of palladium (on first and second cerium/zirconium mixed oxide)<br>
Testing of the catalysts<br>
Before the testing, all catalysts were exposed to hydrothermal aging in a furnace at a<br>
temperature of 985°C for the duration of 16 hours.<br>
After the aging, the catalysts were examined on an engine test bench with regard to<br>
lightoff temperatures and maximum conversions.<br>
Figure 1 shows the comparison of the lightoff temperatures. The two inventive catalysts<br>
have, after aging, significantly lower lightoff temperatures for the conversion of the HC<br>
(hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide) and NOx (nitrogen oxide) pollutants than the<br><br>
comparative catalyst. The diagram of figure 2 shows the maximum conversions<br>
achieved with the catalysts.<br>
The catalysts had a backpressure of 18.3 mbar at a gas temperature of 30°C and an air<br>
mass flow of 345 kg/h. This backpressure is about 15% below the backpressure of a<br>
comparable double-layer catalyst.<br><br>
