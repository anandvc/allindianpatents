				<td>TITTLE  OF  THE   INVENTION:<br>
Diffuser And An Aeration Apparatus Equipped With Such A Diffuser<br>
FIELD OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a diffuser and, in particular, a diffuser that is suited for use in an aeration apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
There are various applications in which aeration apparatus are required. For example, it has been demonstrated that ponds used in aquaculture produce in greater abundance as oxygen levels in such ponds are increased. It is believed that the efficiency of the aeration apparatus used is tied to the efficiency of the diffuser used with the apparatus.<br>
Soviet Union Patent 1699959 discloses a diffuser having a cylindrical body with an outer surface and an inner surface defining a blind bore.  The blind bore has an open attachment end adapted for connection to a conduit and a closed impaction end.  The body has radial slots, whereby fluids are diffused radially from the body through the slots.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is required is a diffuser that will improve the efficiency of an aeration apparatus.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a diffuser which includes a cylindrical body having an outer surface and an inner surface defining a blind bore. The blind bore has an open attachment end adapted for connection to a conduit and a closed impaction<br><br>
2<br>
end.   The body has radial slots,  whereby fluids are diffused radially from the body through the slots;<br>
The diffuser, as described above, has proven to be effective for use in aeration of water for aguaculture. There  are,  however,  a  number of  refinements  to  the diffuser which will now be described that further improve performance efficiency.<br>
)      It has been determined that better results can be<br>
obtained by lengthening the slots so that they are arcuate<br>
and extend around the outer surface of the cylindrical<br>
body.  It has been determined that the diffuser operates<br>
best in a vertical orientation.  It has been determined<br>
that it is better to have the slots converge from the<br>
inner surface to the outer surface.  This increases the<br>
exit velocity of fluids diffused from the body through the<br>
slots.  It has been determined that it is better when the<br>
slot configuration includes a central slot, a lower slot<br>
and an upper slot.  The central slot discharges a first<br>
fluid stream substantially horizontally.  The lower slot<br>
is positioned below the central slot and discharges a<br>
second fluid stream at an upward angle to impinge upon the<br>
first fluid stream.  The upper slot is positioned above<br>
the central slot and discharges a third fluid stream at a<br>
downward angle to impinge upon the first fluid stream.<br>
The impinging streams provide the best results, as the<br>
impact promotes aeration.  Experiments have been conducted<br>
with respect to the angle of the slots.  It is preferred<br>
that the lower slot be angled at an upward angle of<br>
between 28 and 38 degrees and the upper slot is angled at<br>
a downward angle of between 28 and 38 degrees.  A. narrower<br>
recommended optimum range has the lower slot angled at an<br>
upward angle within a narrower range of about 32 to 34<br>
degrees and the upper slot angled at a downward angle<br><br>
3 within a narrower range of about 32 to 34 degrees.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an aeration apparatus which includes a primary conduit adapted for connection to a water source and a secondary conduit adapted for connection to a gas source. The gas is either oxygen gas or a gas that contains oxygen. A venturi is in fluid communication with both the primary conduit and the secondary conduit. The venturi is adapted to inject gas containing oxygen carried by the secondary conduit into water carried by the primary conduit. A diffuser, as previously described, is provided with the open attachment end of the blind bore connected to the primary conduit.<br>
The preferred gas source is an oxygen generator, as it viewed as being more cost effective and practical in remote installations than oxygen tanks.<br>
It is preferred that the diffuser be positioned in a diffusion chamber from which the water is drained. This allows the aerated water to be carried by discharge lines a physical distance away from the diffuser. In the absence of the diffusion chamber, the aeration apparatus would only be capable of aerating water in the immediate vicinity of the diffuser. the diffusion chamber temporarily confines the water and oxygen filled environment, so that the oxygen cannot escape prior to being mixed with the water and thereby further promotes aeration.<br>
It is preferred that the diffuser be mounted on a floating support. This facilitates using as the water source a pump mounted on the floating support. The pump has an intake positioned to draw water from a body of<br><br>
water on which the floating support is floating.<br>
Although beneficial results may be obtained through the use of the aeration apparatus, as described above, the method of anchoring the aeration apparatus can have an effect on performance. The aeration apparatus must be anchored in a manner that will maintain it in a stable upright condition. However, aeration apparatus must be able to adjust as water levels rise and fall. Even more Â¦beneficial results may, therefore, be obtained when the floating support has anchor pins. The floating support is able to travel up and down the anchor pins as the water level rises and falls.<br>
Although beneficial results may be obtained through the use of the aeration apparatus, as described above, it is preferred that the intake for the pump be enclosed within a screen, thereby preventing debris floating in the body of water from being drawn into the pump.<br>
Although beneficial results may be obtained through the use of the aeration apparatus, as described above, the oxygen generator becomes less and less efficient as nitrogen builds up within the filtration sieve. Even more beneficial results may, therefore, be obtained when purge tanks are provided with purge lines extending from the purge tanks to the oxygen generator. This enables oxygen to be cycled periodically from the purge tanks to the oxygen generator to purge the oxygen generator.<br>
Although beneficial results may be obtained through the use of the aeration apparatus, as described above, in order to maximum space utilization within the apparatus it is preferred that the purge tanks also serve as floats for the floating support.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A diffuser generally identified by" reference numeral 10 will now be described with reference to FIGURES 1 through 4. An aeration apparatus generally identified by reference numeral 100 into which diffuser 10 is incorporated will now be described with reference to FIGURES 5 through 10.<br>
Structure and Relationship of Parts of Diffuser: Referring to FIGURE 2, diffuser 10 has a cylindrical body 12 with an outer surface 14 and an inner surface 16 defining a blind bore 18. Blind bore 18 has an open attachment end 20 and a closed impaction end 22. Open attachment end 20 has internal threads 24 positioned along inner surface 16 which are adapted for connection to a conduit as will hereinafter be further described. Referring to FIGURE 1, body 12 has radially extending accurate slots 26. Referring to FIGURE 2, fluids strike closed impaction end 22 and then are diffused radially from body 12 through slots 26. Referring to FIGURE 3' slots 2 6 converge from inner surface 16 to outer surface 14. This increases exit the exit velocity, of fluids diffused from body 12 through slots 26. Referring to FIGURE 4, slots 26 are arranged in a configuration that includes a central slot 28, a lower slot 30 and an upper slot 32. Central slot 28 discharges a first fluid stream 34 substantially horizontally. Lower slot 30 is positioned below central slot 28 and discharges a second fluid stream 36 at an upward angle to impinge upon first fluid stream 34. Upper slot 32 is positioned above central slot 28 and discharges a third fluid stream 38 at a downward angle to impinge upon first fluid stream 34. It is preferred that lower slot 30 be angled at an upward angle of between 23 and 38 degrees and that upper slot 32<br><br>
7<br>
is angled at a downward angle of between 28 and 38 degrees. These angles have been demonstrated to achieve beneficial results. Optimization is believed to be achieved when lower slot 30 is angled at an upward angle within a narrower range of about 32 to 34 degrees and upper slot 32 is angled at a downward angle within a narrower range of about 32 to 34 degrees. For best results, it has been determined that diffuser 10 should be positioned in a substantially vertical orientation as illustrated in FIGURE 1.<br>
There will now be described a preferred form of aeration apparatus 100 into which diffuser 10 is incorporated.<br>
Structure and Relationship of Parts of Aeration Apparatus;<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5, aeration apparatus 100 includes a floating support 112 with purge tanks 114 that serve as floats for support 112. Referring to FIGURES 6 and 7, a diffusion chamber 116 is mounted on floating support 112. An oxygen generator 118 is also mounted on floating support 112 and discharges oxygen into diffusion chamber 116. Referring to FIGURE 7, a pump 120 is mounted on support 112, Referring to FIGURE 8, pump 120 has an intake 122. Referring to FIGURE 7, in this particular embodiment pump 120 (including intake 122) is positioned below floating support 112- It will be appreciated that from this position pump 120 is able to draw water from a body of water 126 on which floating support 112 is floating. It will appreciated that pump 120 need not be a  submersible pump as long as intake 122 for the pump is submerged. Referring to FIGURES 7and 8, pump 120 has a discharge 128.  Referring to FIGURE 1, a primary conduit<br><br>
8<br>
121 is connected to discharge 128, so that primary conduit 121 is kept supplied with water by pump 120.  A secondary conduit 123 is kept supplied with oxygen gas by oxygen generator 118.  A venturi 125 is in fluid communication with both primary conduit 121 and secondary conduit 123. Venturi 125 is adapted to inject oxygen gas carried by secondary conduit 123 into water carried by primary conduit 121.  Diffuser 10 is positioned within diffusion chamber  116 in a substantially vertical  orientation. Attachment end 20 of body 12 of diffuser 10 is connected to primary conduit 121.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 7, diffusion chamber 116 has several drain passages 156. Each of drain passages 156 is coupled to a discharge line 156 which carries water that has been aerated a physical distance from floating support 112. It will be appreciated that any number of drain passages 156 and discharge lines 158 can be used, although beneficial results have been obtained with four.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 8, intake 122 for pump 120 is enclosed within a screen 132 so as to prevent debris in body of water 126 from being drawn into pump 120.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5 and 10, purge lines 160 extend from purge tanks 114 to oxygen generator 116.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 9, oxygen generator 118 includes a control box 164, a motor 166, a blower 168, an exhaust intake 170 and a sieve bed 172.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 5 and 7, floating support 112 has anchor pins 162. Floating support 112 is able to travel up and down anchor pins 162 as the water level of<br><br>
9<br>
body of water 126 rises and falls.<br>
Operation:<br>
The use and operation of diffuser 10 and aeration apparatus 100 will now be described with reference to FIGURES 1 though 10. Referring to FIGURE 5, aeration apparatus 100 is placed in body of water 126 where aeration of water is required. Referring to FIGURE 6, aeration apparatus 100 is kept afloat on body of water 126 by purge tanks 114 which are mounted to floating support 112. Referring to FJSUKES 5 and 7, anchoring pins 162 are used to anchor aeration apparatus 100 in a stable upright condition. Floating support 112 is able to travel up and down anchoring pins 162 as water levels in body of water 126 rise and fall.<br>
Once suitably anchored, aeration apparatus 100 can be<br>
activated. Referring to FIGURE 8, upon activation water from body of water 126 is drawn in through intake 122 of pump 120 and discharged through discharge 128. Referring to FIGURE 1 water passes under pressure up primary conduit 121. Oxygen supplied by oxygen generator 118 passes under pressure along secondary conduit 123. Venture 125 injects oxygen into the watet passing along priiaary conduit 121. Referring to FIGURE 2, the aerated water passes from primary conduit 121 into blind bore 18 of diffuses 10. The path of the aerated water is blocked by closed impaction end 22. The aerated water strikes impaction end 22 of diffuser 10. This impact with impaction end 22 promotes aeration. Water then exits blind bore 18 through slots. 26. Referring to FIGURE 3, in view of the fact slots 26 converge from inner surface 16 to outer surface 14, the velocity of the aerated water increases as it is diffused from body 12 through slots 26.   Referring to<br><br>
10<br>
FIGURE 4, lower slot 30 discharges second fluid stream 36 at an upward angle to' impinge upon first fluid stream 34 from central slot 28, Upper slot 32, similarly, discharges third fluid stream 38 at a downward angle to impinge upon first fluid stream 34. The impact of the impinging streams further enhances aeration of the water.<br>
Diffuses 10 discharges into diffusion chamber 116. Oxygen which otherwise might escape to atmosphere is contained within diffusion chamber 116 thereby further enhancing aeration of the water. Referring to FIGURE 7, water is drained from diffusion chamber 116 through drain passages 156 and carried by discharge lines 158 a physical distance from support 112.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5, purge lines 160 enable oxygen to be cycled periodically from purge tanks 114 to purge oxygen generator 118. Referring to FIGURE 9, sieve bed 172 absorbs nitrogen as air passes through and must be regenerated by purging the accumulated nitrogen. Every second cycle, approximately 15% of the oxygen is cycled back into oxygen generator 118 to purge sieve bed 172 of accumulated nitrogen.<br><br>
