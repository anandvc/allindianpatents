I!        Field of invention:<br>
Sequence of Process for Manufacturing of Cotton Yarns in Textile Industries<br>
III        Background of invention with regard to the drawbacks associated with the prior art:<br>
Among all the fibres used for apparel manufacture, cotton is considered as one of the best due to its superior physical and mechanical properties such as tensile properties, moisture absorbency, surface characteristics and its compatibility with many other natural and synthetic fibres. Technological development has enabled the textile industry to produce numerous types of yarns and fabrics with specified quality.<br>
In a highly competitive global trade environment governed by WTO agreements, the issues like quality, eeo-friendliness and social responsibility are going to determine the market access to a greater extent. For meeting best quality of textile product, the raw material is one of the important tool for achieving the same. In textile, the basic raw material is fibre. Apart from the other factors the quality of fibres will decide the process performance and also the quality of the out put products.<br>
In general the people from the cotton ginning industry purchase the harvested cotton locules or kapas from different places but they do not give consideration to the weight of the kapas and its related fibre (lint) properties. But the weight of kapas significantly affects the physical properties of the fibre. Due to this, the variations of fibre properties in the particular fibre groups are very high. This is very clear from fig. 1. Due to the above reason, the process performance in the yarn manufacture and quality aspects in yarn and fabrics are limited. Also the maintenance of consistency in yarn and fabric quality is limited.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram shows the reasons for variation of fibre properties with in the particular group<br><br>
Therefore, for creating a way to reduce the variation of fibre properties within the particular fibre groups and also to get excellent fibre, yarn and fabric quality using the available raw material, new process or operation was used namely "process for categorization of fibre with respect to their physical properties" in addition to the existing sequence of process in cotton yarn manufacturing which is shown in fig. 2 (Reference: 'Motivate Series - Textiles' by Andrea Wynne, page no. 72). The new process or operation is not only helpful in categorizing fibres with respect to their physical properties but also in the categorization of seeds with respect to uwii weight. This helps in getting best / heavier seeds for planting. This leads to reduced weight variation of kapas within the particular harvest group. By using the new process or operation we can easily achieve the categorization of fibres with respect to their physical properties, so that the ranges of variation of fibre properties are reduced. This leads to production of excellent yam quality without the need for the combing operation when processing every categorized groups of kapas separately from ginning to spinning (carded process).<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram shows the existing cotton yarn manufacturing sequence of process<br>
IV       Object of invention:<br>
1.	Categorization of fibres with respect to their physical properties.<br>
2.	Correct and effective utilization of raw material for producing particular quality of yarn and fabric.<br>
3.	To produce excellent quality of yam and fabric without using the combing process.<br>
4.	Categorization of seeds with respect to their weight and selection of best seeds for planting.<br><br>
5.	To reduce the weight variation of kapas from particular harvested cotton groups.<br>
6.	To reduce the shade variation of dyed fibre, yarn and fabric.<br>
7.	To improve the efficiency and process performance in the spinning and weaving industry.<br>
8.	To produce quality products with reduced cost of manufacturing.<br>
9.	Maintenance of consistent fibre, yarn and fabric quality.<br>
V        Summary of invention:<br>
Categorization of fibres with respect to their physical properties namely length, strength, fineness, maturity and nep (cnt/g) can be achieved by grouping or categorizing the kapas with respect to their weights from particular variety or different varieties prior to ginning.<br>
For proving the same, MUC5 Indian cottons were collected, grown and harvested at three locations in Tamil Nadu at Rajapalayam. The locations were about 6 miles apart.<br>
The individual kapas of each location was separately grouped with four different ranges of kapas weights. The various grouped or categorized kapas were ginned separately and their ginned seed and lint (fibre) were collected. The properties of lint with respect to their weight group of seeds are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Categorization of kapas with respect to their weight by another four varieties<br><br>
was done using the same process. The AFIS results of fibres related to their kapas weight are shown in Table 3, 4, 5 and 6. From the result It is very clear that, by separating the kapas with respect to their weights, we can easily categorize the different quality of fibres (at least three different fibre groups) and different weight of seeds.<br>
Therefore from a single variety cotton, it is possible to produce at least three different ranges of yarn counts with excellent quality and improved process performance. Due to the categorization of kapas with respect to their weights prior to ginning, the textile industries can achieve excellent improvement in the process of yarn and fabric manufacturing.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram shows the brief idea about the kapas categorization<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the various steps according to the method of this invention with reference to kapas categorization<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram illustrating the various steps according to the method of this invention with reference to locules categorization<br>
Fig. 6 is a block diagram gives brief idea about the method of categorization of locules<br>
VI       Description of invention with reference to drawings:<br>
Grouping or categorization of fibres (at least three groups) within the variety or between the varieties with respect to their pnysical properties and grouping or categorization of seeds with respect to their weight can be achieved very easily by categorization of kapas with respect to their weight. Due to this the range of variation within the categorized fibre groups are very much reduced. The superior yarn quality can be achieved by processing categorized fibre groups separately with varying process parameters from ginning to spinning (carded yarn process). This is very clear<br><br>
from fig. 3. But the categorization of kapas can be achieved by two different ways, which is shown in fig. 4 and 5. The details of locules categorization 1, 2, and 3 are shown in fig. 6. The categorization of fibres by locules is important because individual kapas weights in the particular locules are almost same, the results are shown in Table 7.8 &amp; 9.<br>
Because the collection of various groups of ginned lint (fibres) was done with respect to their kapas weights, tne fibres of varying properties could be separated ea$ify. Therefore the variations in the fibre properties are found to be very less. This is the essential requirement for producing best quality of yarn and fabric with excellent process performance.<br>
Due to the collection of various groups of ginned seeds with respect to their weights, it is easy to collect the required seeds (seeds from heavier kapas groups) for planting and other purpose. But only heavier seeds should be used for planting, so that the variations in the harvested kapas with respect to their weights is reduced. This leads to simplification of the process, "categorization of kapas with respect to their weight'. In addition, this process makes the mentioned categorization a worthful and economically viable process for producing best quality yarn and fabric with best process performance. Similarly due to the reduction of variation in fibre properties it is possible to achieve consistency of fibre, yarn and fabric quality. Therefore, using the present process it is possible to produce zero defect yarn and fabric with the utilization of available raw material using the above mentioned operations.<br><br><br><br>
