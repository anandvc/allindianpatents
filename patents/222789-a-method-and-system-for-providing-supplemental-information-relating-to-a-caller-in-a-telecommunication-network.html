				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING MOBILE CALLER<br>
INFORMATION TO A SPECIAL NUMBER SERVICE STATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to telecommunication networks, and especially to<br>
telecommunication networks involving calls from mobile calling instruments to special<br>
number service stations. An example of such a call from a mobile calling instrument to a<br>
special number service station is a call from a cellular phone, from a Voice over Internet<br>
Protocol (VoIP) calling instrument or from another wireless or otherwise mobile device to<br>
an emergency service station such as a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) in an<br>
emergency service call system.<br>
An emergency service call system, commonly known in the United States as an<br>
E9-1-1 System, will be employed herein as an exemplary preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Other special number systems are deployed and would benefit from the<br>
present invention. Examples of such other special number systems include (by way of<br>
example and not by way of limitation) non-emergency police or fire call systems,<br>
telephone network maintenance call systems and commercially established special<br>
numbers (e.g., "dial 'GOTDC' on your AT&amp;T Wireless phone for tickets").<br>
A basic 9-1-1 (Emergency Services) System provides for programming with<br>
special 9-1-1 software a telephone company end office (also known as a "central office"<br>
or a "Class 5 office") to route all 9-1-1 calls to a single destination. The single destination<br>
is termed a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). In such an arrangement, all<br>
telephones served by the central office would have their 9-1-1 calls completed to the<br>
PSAP. However, the areas served by respective telephone company central offices do not<br>
line up with the political jurisdictions that determine the boundaries for which PSAP may<br>
be responsible. That is, a municipal fire department or police department may<br>
geographically include an area outside the area served by the central office, a condition<br>
known as underlap. Likewise, the municipal fire or police department may encompass an<br>
area of responsibility that is less expansive than the area served by the central office, a<br>
situation known as overlap. Further, the original basic 9-1-1 systems did not provide any<br>
identification of the caller; the PSAP human operator had to obtain such information<br>
verbally over the line after the call was connected. The major shortcoming of the basic 9-<br>
1-1 systems was that they could not support interconnection to other telecommunication<br>
providers such as independent telephone service companies, Alternate Local Exchange<br>
Carriers (ALECs), or wireless carriers. The "basic" nature of the basic 9-1-1 system also<br>
indicates that the system does not have Automatic Location Information (ALI) capability<br>
or Automatic Number Identification (ANI) capability with a call back capability.<br>
Similar abbreviated number systems are in place for handling emergency service<br>
calls in countries other than the United States. The abbreviated number system established<br>
in Canada is the foreign system most similar to the system established in the United<br>
States. There are other abbreviated number calling systems in place in the United States<br>
and abroad for such purposes as handling municipal information and services calls (3-1-1)<br>
and for other purposes. All of these special or abbreviated number call systems that have<br>
geographic-based content suffer from similar shortcomings in their abilities to<br>
automatically place incoming calls to an action-response facility geographically proximate<br>
to the locus of the caller. It is for this reason that the 9-1-1 emergency call system of the<br>
United States is employed for purposes of this application as a preferred embodiment of<br>
the system and method of the present invention.<br>
Automatic Number Identification (ANI) is a feature for 9-1-1 services that allows<br>
the caller's telephone number to be delivered with the call and displayed at the PSAP.<br>
This ANI feature is sometimes referred to as Calling Party Number (CPN). The feature is<br>
useful for identifying the caller and, if the caller cannot communicate, for callback. A<br>
signaling scheme known as Centralized Automatic Message Accounting (CAMA),<br>
originally used to identify the originator of a long distance call for billing purposes, was<br>
adapted to facilitate ANI delivery to the PSAP.<br>
The availability of the caller's telephone number to the PSAP (the ANI feature)<br>
led quickly to providing the caller's name and address as well. This was straightforwardly<br>
accomplished using the subscriber information stored by telephone companies based upon<br>
telephone number since the 1980's. New equipment at the PSAP enabled queries of an<br>
Automatic Location Information (ALI) database using the caller's number provided by the<br>
ANI feature to ascertain name and address information. The ALI databases are typically<br>
maintained by the respective telephone company serving the PSAP. This was an<br>
improvement, but a problem still remained where several telephone company central<br>
offices served a town or county. Other problems also developed with the growing volume<br>
of mobile callers using wireless phones, satellite phones and communications over the<br>
Internet. Information regarding the locus of the origin of the call merely identified the<br>
locus where the call entered the wireline network; even such limited location information<br>
is not always provided. No indication was presented to identify the geographic location of<br>
such mobile callers.<br>
As the situation of multiple central offices serving a PSAP occurred more<br>
frequently, it was clear that it was inefficient to build communication trunks from several<br>
central offices to a PSAP. As a result the 9-1-1 Tandem was developed. With that<br>
equipment, trunks from central offices are concentrated at a tandem office (a 9-1-1<br>
Tandem) from which a single trunk group serves a given PSAP. Often a 9-1-1 tandem<br>
comprises an otherwise common Class 5 telephone system end office (EO), with added<br>
software to configure it for 9-1-1 operations. Such concentration of trunks reduces size<br>
and cost of PSAP equipment. The tandem is a telephone company switch that provides<br>
an intermediate concentration and switching point. Tandems are used for many purposes,<br>
including intra-LATA (Local Access and Transport Area) toll calls, access to other local<br>
exchange carriers (LECs), and access to long distance carriers and telephone operators.<br>
A significant development in 9-1-1 services has been the introduction of Enhanced<br>
9-1-1 (E9-1-1). Some of the features of E9-1-1 include Selective Routing, ANI, ALI,<br>
Selective Transfer and Fixed Transfer. Selective Transfer enables one-button transfer<br>
capability to Police, Fire and EMS (Emergency Medical Service) agencies appropriate for<br>
the caller's location listed on the ALI display. Fixed Transfer is analogous to speed<br>
dialing. Enhanced 9-1-1 services also permit provisioning supplemental data or<br>
information regarding calling parties, such as allergies to medications, presence of pets,<br>
infants or handicapped persons at the premises or similar information useful to responding<br>
to emergency service personnel.<br>
Selective Routing is a process by which 9-1-1 calls are delivered to a specific<br>
PSAP based upon the street address of the caller. Selective Routing Tandems do not<br>
directly use address information from the ALI database to execute decisions regarding<br>
which PSAP to connect. Recall that emergency services (Police, Fire and EMS) are<br>
typically delivered on a municipality basis. Often there will be one Police Department<br>
(e.g., municipal, county or state), but there may be several Fire Departments and EMS<br>
Agencies. The town will be divided into response areas served by each respective agency.<br>
The response areas are overlaid and may be defined as geographic zones served by one<br>
particular combination of Police, Fire and EMS agencies. Such zones are referred to as<br>
Emergency Service Zones (ESZ). Each ESZ contains the street addresses served by each<br>
type of responder. The ESZs are each assigned an identification number (usually 3-5<br>
digits), known as Emergency Service Numbers (ESN).<br>
The Assignment of ESZs and corresponding ESNs enables the compilation of<br>
selective routing tables. The street addresses are derived from a Master Street Address<br>
Guide (MSAG), a database of street names and house number ranges within associated<br>
communities defining Emergency Service Zones (ESZs) and their associated Emergency<br>
Service Numbers (ESNs). This MSAG enables proper routing of 9-1-1 calls by the 9-1-1<br>
Tandem; this is Selective Routing as implemented in an E9-1-1 system. Thus, the<br>
telephone company must have an MSAG valid address to be assigned the appropriate<br>
ESN for selective routing purposes and that information must be added to the E9-1-1 ALT<br>
database. It is by using such information that the selective routing capability of the<br>
Selective Routing Tandem can properly route an E9-1-1 call to the correct PSAP. If the<br>
information is not available in the ALI database, the record is placed into an error file for<br>
further manual handling.<br>
A portion of the ALI database may be loaded into a Selective Routing Data Base<br>
(SRDB) for use by the 9-1-1 Tandem. The SRDB may be located in the Tandem, in an<br>
adjunct processor, or in the ALI database.<br>
Reliability is a very important factor considered in designing 9-1-1 systems. One<br>
approach to providing reliability is to provide diversely routed trunk groups from each<br>
central office to its respective 9-1-1 Tandem. Preferably, each trunk group is large enough<br>
to carry the entire 9-1-1 traffic load for the respective central office. However, some<br>
systems are designed with less than full traffic capacity on trunk groups to "choke" or<br>
"congestion manage" incoming calls to a tandem in order to avoid overloading a PSAP.<br>
In some arrangements, parallel 9-1-1 Tandems are provided so that a central office has<br>
capable 9-1-1 Tandem ready for use (albeit with 50% call handling capacity) without<br>
interruption if one of the 9-1-1 Tandems fails. Switched bypass to an alternate 9-1-1<br>
Tandem, commonly using digital crossover switches, is another approach to providing<br>
reliability in 9-1-1 systems.<br>
Another approach to providing redundancy and robustness for a 9-1-1 system is<br>
the employment of Instant Network Backup (INB). Using INB, if a call does not<br>
complete to the 9-1-1 network for any reason (e.g., trunk failure, facility problem, 9-1-1<br>
Tandem failure or port failure), the INB takes over and completes the call to a<br>
predesignated 7- or 10-digit number. Using this INB alternate path, ANI and ALI<br>
information are not delivered, but the call is completed to a local public safety agency,<br>
usually the local PSAP.<br>
The interface between Operator handled calls and a 9-1-1 system is addressed in<br>
several ways. One system provides a direct connection between an Operator Tandem and<br>
the 9-1-1 Tandem. The operator forwards the call with the caller's ANI to the 9-1-1<br>
Tandem. The 9-1-1 Tandem treats the call as though the caller had dialed the call. A<br>
second way to effect the desired interface is by using pseudo numbers. A pseudo number<br>
is a number that, when dialed, will reach a specific PSAP as a 9-1-1 call. Pseudo numbers<br>
have some special ALI information associated with them; for example, there may be a<br>
pseudo number associated with each municipality in a state. Dialing the pseudo number,<br>
usually from outside the LATA (Local Access and Transport Area), will generate a 9-1-1<br>
to the PSAP for that municipality. The ALI display will indicate that it is a third parry<br>
conference call from an unknown address in that town. The caller is not identified, but<br>
the call goes to the PSAP where the caller is believed, or claims, to be. Pseudo numbers<br>
are useful for Alternate Local Exchange Carrier (ALEC) or Competitive Local Exchange<br>
Carrier (CLEC) operators who may be located anywhere in the country.<br>
A third method for effecting an interface for operator handled calls with a 9-1-1<br>
system is through the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), dialing the directory<br>
number for the PSAP. This is often referred to as the "back door" number by ALEC and<br>
CLEC operators.<br>
The advent of wireless communications and other mobile phone capabilities (e.g.,<br>
VoIP phones) has further exacerbated the difficulty of ascertaining caller location in<br>
telecommunication systems. The "patchwork" solutions described above regarding 9-1-1<br>
systems have been mirrored in other special or abbreviated number systems to a<br>
significant extent. The "patchwork" solutions have created a capability-limited<br>
telecommunication system that cannot ascertain geographic information as fully or as<br>
easily as it should for all types of callers. This capability limitation has been especially<br>
felt in connection with calls made from mobile telephone instruments. The system is<br>
overly dependent upon human intervention to properly route calls to appropriate receivers,<br>
such as a proper PSAP. New modes of communication, such as Voice Over Internet<br>
Protocol (VoIP) and wireless communication instruments including wireless phones,<br>
wireless Personal Computers (PCs), wireless Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices<br>
and other mobile instruments, further contribute to telecommunication traffic not<br>
identifiable regarding geographic origin using present telecommunication routing systems.<br>
Similar limitations will likely occur in other abbreviated number, or other special<br>
number, telephone systems handling location-based calls with resulting adverse<br>
limitations. Other such abbreviated number systems include emergency call systems in<br>
countries other than the United States, abbreviated number calling systems for reaching<br>
telephone maintenance services, abbreviated number calling systems for municipal<br>
information and services, and similar systems.<br>
Provisioning of supplemental information to a special number service station (e.g.,<br>
a PSAP in an emergency service call system) regarding a call originating from a mobile<br>
calling instrument is particularly difficult. Even with precise location information<br>
regarding locus of the origin of the call, such as would be available, for example, when<br>
the calling instrument has a Global Positioning System (GPS) capability, does not fulfill<br>
the need for availability of supplemental information regarding the calling party. Such<br>
supplemental information may include (by way of example and not by way of limitation)<br>
medical needs of the caller like allergies to medicines, or a request to notify specified<br>
personnel in the case of an emergency, or other information unique to the calling party<br>
that may be useful to responding emergency personnel. Other wireless systems, such as<br>
Automatic Collision Notification systems (ACN; one such system is referred to as<br>
ONSTAR™) may find it useful to alert responding emergency personnel that an infant or<br>
an invalid may be in an automobile involved in an accident. No systems are presently<br>
available to effect provisioning such supplemental information to a responding service<br>
station (e.g., a PSAP) for mobile instrument-originated calls. Mobile instrumentoriginated<br>
calls may include mobile telephone devices, wireless Personal Computers<br>
(PCs), wireless Personal Digital Assistant devices (PDAs), pager devices and other<br>
wireless-communication capable devices, whether capable of one-way or two-way<br>
communication. The present invention is also beneficial for other calling equipment<br>
having no particular fixed position, such as Voice over Internet Protocol phone devices<br>
(VoIP phones).<br>
There is a need for a system and method for providing particular information<br>
relating to a caller placing a call from a mobile calling instrument to a special number<br>
service station in a telecommunication network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A system for providing particular information relating to a caller placing a call<br>
from a mobile calling instrument to a special number service station in a<br>
telecommunication network includes: (a) an information store for storing a body of<br>
information including the particular information identified as relating to the caller; and (b)<br>
an interface unit communicatingly coupled at least with the information store and the<br>
special number service station. The interface unit responds to a query identifying the<br>
calling instrument from the special number service station by retrieving the particular<br>
information from the information store and communicating the particular information to<br>
the special number service station.<br>
A method for providing particular information relating to a caller placing a call<br>
from a mobile calling instrument to a special number service station in a<br>
telecommunication network includes the steps of: (a) providing an information store for<br>
storing a body of information including the particular information identified as relating to<br>
the caller; (b) providing an interface unit communicatingly coupled at least with the<br>
information store and the special number service station; (c) operating the interface unit to<br>
respond to a query identifying the calling instrument from the special number service<br>
station by retrieving the particular information from the information store; and (d)<br>
communicating the particular information to the special number service station.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a system and method<br>
for providing particular information relating to a caller placing a call from a mobile<br>
calling instrument to a special number service station in a telecommunication network.<br>
Further objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the<br>
following specification and claims when considered in connection with the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which like elements are labeled using like reference numerals in the various<br>
figures, illustrating the preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating the preferred embodiment of<br>
the system of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating the preferred embodiment of the method of the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating the preferred embodiment of<br>
the system of the present invention. In FIG. 1, a telecommunication arrangement 10<br>
includes a network 12 for effecting telecommunications among callers and called parties.<br>
A mobile calling instrument 14 is wirelessly coupled with a transceiving tower 16.<br>
Mobile calling instrument 14 is represented in FIG 1 as a cellular phone, but may as well<br>
be any of several mobile calling instruments such as, by way of example and not by way<br>
of limitation, wireless Personal Computers (PCs), wireless Personal Digital Assistant<br>
devices (PDAs), pager devices and other wireless-communication capable devices,<br>
whether capable of one-way or two-way communication, and other calling equipment<br>
having no particular fixed position, such as Voice over Internet Protocol phone devices<br>
(VoIP phones).<br>
Transceiving tower 16 is coupled with a mobile switching center 18. Mobile<br>
switching center 18 recognizes the call received from mobile calling instrument 14 as a<br>
special number call (e.g., an emergency service E9-1-1 call) and conveys the special<br>
number call via network 12 to a telecommunication switch 20. Network 12 may be<br>
embodied in a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or in another network,<br>
including private networks and Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet.<br>
Mobile calling instrument 14 may access a network such as an Internet Protocol network<br>
without involving transceiving tower 16 or mobile switching center 18. Switch 20 maybe<br>
a specialized switch configured especially for handling special number calls. An example<br>
of such a switch is a 9-1-1 Tandem for handling E9-1-1 emergency service calls in the<br>
United States. It is such an emergency service call that is employed in this disclosure as a<br>
preferred embodiment exemplary of the system and method of the present invention.<br>
However, other special number calls are intended as being within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Switch 20 couples the call received from mobile calling instrument 14 via network<br>
12 with one or more special number service stations 22, 24, 26. Special number service<br>
stations 22, 24, 26 are embodied in public safety answering points PSAP1, PSAP2,<br>
PSAPn in exemplary emergency service E9-1-1 telecommunication arrangement 10<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. Mobile switching center 18 is also preferably coupled with a mobile<br>
positioning center 30. Mobile positioning center 30 is coupled with at least one<br>
location/position determining unit(s) 32. Part of the call information received from<br>
mobile calling instrument 14 by mobile switching center 18 preferably includes position<br>
indicating information that may employ, by way of example and not by way of limitation,<br>
Global Positioning System (GPS) information or other position-indicating information<br>
that relates to the locus of mobile calling instrument 14. Mobile positioning center 30 and<br>
location/position determining unit(s) 32 cooperate to employ position indicating<br>
information received from mobile switching center 18 to provide to mobile switching<br>
center 18 an indication of the locus of mobile calling unit 14. The locus maybe indicated<br>
in a latitude-longitude format or in another format. The locus indicating information may<br>
be included in call information (e.g., call set-up or call routing information) that<br>
accompanies calls traversing network 12 in order to aid network 12 in determining which<br>
switch 20 to which to route the extant call. Locus indicating information may also be<br>
employed by switch 20 to select which special number service station 22, 24, 26 should<br>
receive the extant call. It is important to route the extant call to an appropriate special<br>
number service station 22, 24,26 (e.g., PS API, PSAP2, PSAPn) for providing the service<br>
requested by the extant call. In the exemplary call system illustrated in FIG. 1, PS API is<br>
the appropriate recipient of the extant call placed by mobile calling instrument 14, based<br>
upon the locus of mobile calling instrument 14.<br>
PS API is coupled with an Automatic Location Information (ALI) unit 40 and<br>
communicates with ALI unit 40 to ascertain location and other information relating to any<br>
caller associated with the locus of mobile calling instrument 14. ALI units in land line<br>
calling scenarios involving E9-1-1 calling typically contained stored information relating<br>
to address of the location of the calling instrument and other supplemental information<br>
relating to the locus of the calling instrument. Supplemental information in such land line<br>
E9-1-1 systems typically included details regarding such things as allergies suffered by<br>
residents at the calling instrument locus, pets or infants or invalids residing at the calling<br>
instrument locus, or other details that could be useful to responding emergency service<br>
personnel. The present invention fulfills a need for supplemental information availability<br>
to responding special number service stations, such as PSAPs, that has heretofore been<br>
unavailable for mobile calling instruments.<br>
A supplemental information store apparatus 50 is coupled with ALI unit 40,<br>
Supplemental information store apparatus 50 includes a supplemental information store<br>
52 in which information is stored in a manner that is retrievable according to individual<br>
callers. Supplemental information store 52 is coupled with an interface unit 54. Interface<br>
unit 54 is preferably coupled with ALI unit 40 and responds to queries posed by PSAP1 to<br>
ALI unit 40 or relayed by ALI unit 40 to provide supplemental information stored in<br>
supplemental information store 52 for a caller identified in the extant query.<br>
Identification of the caller is preferably effected using phone number information or call<br>
routing information or a combination of such identifying information. ALI unit 40 is<br>
coupled with mobile positioning center 30 so that responses provided by ALI unit 40 to<br>
PS API may include locus indicating information relating to mobile calling instrument 14,<br>
if desired. Alternatively, interface unit 54 may be coupled with mobile positioning center<br>
30 so that responses provided to ALI unit 40 may include locus indicating information<br>
relating to mobile calling instrument 14, if desired. The alternate nature of this<br>
connection between interface unit 54 and mobile positioning center 30 is indicated by a<br>
dotted line 58 coupling interface unit 54 and mobile positioning center 30. Another<br>
alternative permits interface unit 54 to be coupled directly with PS API (or other PSAPs)<br>
directly without including a connection with ALI unit 40. It is preferred that the coupling<br>
arrangement shown in FIG. 1 be employed to take advantage of already existing<br>
connections between PSAPs and ALI units in emergency service systems in the United<br>
States.<br>
Information for storing in supplemental information store 52 is provided to<br>
supplemental information store 52 via an update interface unit 56. Using update interface<br>
unit 56, information entries and updates may be provided for supplemental information<br>
store 52 current using any of a variety of communication milieux. Thus, by way of<br>
example and not by way of limitation, information owners 62, 64, 66 may deliver<br>
information to supplemental information store 52 via update interface unit 56 using an<br>
Internet Protocol network such as the Internet 60, via a Personal Computer (PC) entering<br>
information into a website or via e-mail (not shown in detail in FIG. 1), using a wireless<br>
access device such as a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) 65 or using a Voice over<br>
Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone 67. Alternatively, information owners 62, 64, 66 may<br>
deliver information to update interface unit 56 via a telecommunication network such as a<br>
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 70 using a telephone 72 or a facsimile<br>
instrument 74. Other communication venues 78 may also be employed to provide<br>
information for storing or updating in supplemental information store 52, such as via US.<br>
Mail or other communication means. A call center 71 may be provided to facilitate calls<br>
placed to update interface unit 56, if desired. The alternate nature of providing call center<br>
71 is indicated in FIG. 1 by depicting call center 71 using a dotted line format.<br>
Supplemental information store apparatus 50 is preferably a centrally located<br>
facility that can be accessed by special number service stations such as PSAP1<br>
nationwide. Alternatively, supplemental information storage apparatus 50 may be<br>
embodied in distributed storage facilities that are updated from home storage facilities,<br>
similar to arrangements for storing visiting callers numbers in a Visitors' Location<br>
Register (VLR) maintained by a cellular telecommunication system for callers roaming in<br>
a coverage area.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating the preferred embodiment of the method of the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 2, a method 100 for providing particular information relating<br>
to a caller placing a call from a mobile calling instrument to a special number service<br>
station in a telecommunication network begins at a START locus 102. Method 100<br>
continues with the step of providing an information store for storing a body of<br>
information, as indicated by a block 104. The body of information includes the particular<br>
information identified as relating to the caller. Method 100 continues with providing an<br>
