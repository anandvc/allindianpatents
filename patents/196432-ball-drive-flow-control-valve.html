The object of this invention is to eradicate the defects of the existing system and to develop a foolÂ¬proof device for the equal water distribution, which not only allows the stipulated rate of flow or prevents the illegal tapping of water but also stops the return flow from the sewage, which is a major problem for the society in the contamination of drinking water. It is also the object of the invention to have device, which is very simple in construction, easy for operation and also available at affordable cost.<br>
The structural changes and modification are the improvements of the invention to over come the problems associated with the invention. The modification in the existing device is done at the outlet area of the valve for regulate water supply at the stipulated quantity according to the high pressure or illegal tapping by electric motor. In this system, a notch has provided at the inner orifice of the outlet which allows the stipulated rate of supply at the time of high pressure or in case of illegal tapping of water by electric motors. That is if the rate of flow of supply exceeds in maximum pressure the ball is stressed beyond and thereby closes the outlet inner orifice and the notch controls the flow of water discharge to the specified rate.<br><br>
The another change to the existing device has done in the external body, at the both neck portion of the valve. Two tamper proof grooves(under cut ) are provided at the both neck portion to avoid tampering attempt to remove the ball by the end users in order to draw more water.<br>
According to the above, the Apparatus for controlling and regulating the flow of drinking Water in Public drinking water distribution system through pipe lines, that is actuated by ball drive flow control system at the predetermined pressures; comprising, an external main body, main flow path having a ball within the said body to regulate and control the predetermined quantity of water; Said main flow path having an Inlet and Outlet for flow of water, through the Inlet the flow lifts the ball at the main flow path; water flows through the specified flow path inside the body wherein ball is moved by upstream pressure according to variable pressure rate and controls the discharge of water to the designed flow rate through the outlet; said out let has a notch provision for high pressure flow control such that the ball is lifted up due to higher pressure and closes the outlet inner orifice and the notch controls the flow of water discharge to the specified rate.<br>
Now the invention will be more clearly described with the figures of the drawings which accompany the complete specification.<br>
The following of the drawings shows another embodiment wherein the position of the ball under different working condition is illustrated.<br>
Fig.l of the drawing shows the sectional view of flow control valve for house service connection.<br>
Fig.2 of the drawing shows the first working condition at minimum operating pressure 0.01 kgf (10 cm Head). It is seen from the drawings that the S.S. Ball is lifted up when flow enters in to the flow control valve.<br>
Fig.3 of the drawings shows the working condition of flow control valve wherein the ball is nearly in the middle of the flow path. The normal operating pressure at this condition is around 3.0 m Head to 6.0 m Head. It is to be noted that the S.S. Ball floats at appropriate levels to allow the designed quantity of water.<br>
Fig.4 of the drawings shows the 3rd working condition wherein the ball is nearly at the outlet of the flow control valve at this working condition, the pressure level will be 6.0 m Head and above. This condition is comparable to a situation of using electric suction motor. Here the flow is designed such that the flow is allowed only through the notch.<br>
