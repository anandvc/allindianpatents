Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) comprise the acid addition and base salts thereof.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucurbnate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochlorlde/chlorlde, hydrobromlde/bromide, hydroiodlde/iodide, Isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmltate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts..<br>
Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.<br>
Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts. For a review on suitable salts, see "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use" by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by one or more of three methods:<br>
(i)       by reacting the compound of formula (I) with the desired acid or base; (ii)       by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of<br>
formula (I) using the desired acid or base; or (iii)       by converting one salt of the compound of formula (I) to another by reaction with an appropriate<br>
acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.<br>
All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionlsatlon in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
The compounds of the Invention may exist In both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate1 is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the Invention and one or more Pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water.<br><br>
Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion<br>
complexes wherein the drug and host are present in stolchlometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also<br>
included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which<br>
may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionised, partially<br>
ionised, or non-ionised. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by<br>
Haleblian (August 1975).<br>
Hereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) include references to salts, solvates and complexes<br>
thereof and to solvates and complexes of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention Include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, including all<br>
polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and Isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and<br>
tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I).<br>
As indicated, so-called 'pro-drugs' of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the<br>
invention.  Thus  certain  derivatives of compounds  of formula (I) which  may have little or no<br>
pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into<br>
•<br>
compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives<br>
are referred to as 'prodrugs'. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in "Pro-drugs as<br>
Novel Delivery Systems", Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and "Bioreversible<br>
Carriers  in Drug Design",  Pergamon  Press,  1987 (ed.  E.  B.  Roche, American  Pharmaceutical<br>
Association).<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate<br>
functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled In the<br>
art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, In "Design of Prodrugs" by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the Invention include<br>
(!)        where the compound of formula I contains a carboxylic acid functionality, an ester thereof, for<br>
example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of<br>
formula (I) is replaced by (C1-C8)alkyl; and<br>
(ii)       where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality, an amide<br>
thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino<br>
functionality of the compound of formula (I) is/are replaced by (C1-C10)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of<br>
other prodrug types may be found In the aforementioned references.  Moreover, certain compounds of<br>
formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula (I).<br>
Also included within the scope of the Invention are metabolites of compounds of formula (I), that is,<br>
compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance<br>
with the invention include<br>
(i)        where the compound of formula (I) contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof<br>
(-CH3 -&gt;-CH2OH): (ii)       where the compound of formula (I) contains an aikoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (-OR -<br>
&gt; -OH); (ill)      where the compound of formula (I) contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative<br>
thereof (-NR1R2 -&gt; -NHR1 or -NHR2);<br><br>
(iv)      where the compound of formula (I) contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative<br>
thereof (-NHR1 -&gt; -NH2); (v)       where the compound of formula (I) contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph -&gt; •<br>
PhOH); and (vi)       where the compound of formula (I) contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (-<br>
CONH2 -&gt; COOH).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereolsomers. Where a compound of formula (I) contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I) containing, for example, a keto group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereolsomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), Including compounds exhibiting more than one type of Isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.<br>
Cis/trans Isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled In the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chlral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chlral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantlomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamlne. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>
The present invention includes all crystal forms of the compounds of formula (I) Including racemates and racemic mixtures (conglomerates) thereof. Stereolsomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art - see, for example, "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds" by E. L Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, New York, 1994).<br>
The present Invention includes all pharmaceutlcally acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates In nature.<br><br><br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds- of the invention include isotopes of<br>
hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 38CI, fluorine, such as<br>
18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 1SN, oxygen, such as 15O, 170 and 18O,<br>
phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as 35S.<br>
Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I), for example, those incorporating a radioactive<br>
Isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, I.e.<br>
3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation<br>
and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier Isotopes such as deuterium, I.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages<br>
resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage<br>
requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful In Positron<br>
Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotoplcally-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques<br>
known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying<br>
Examples and Preparations using an appropriate Isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled<br>
reagent previously employed.<br>
Pharmaceutlcally acceptable solvates in accordance with the Invention include those wherein the solvent<br>
of crystallization may be isotoplcally substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, de-DMSO.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are Intermediate compounds as hereinafter defined, all salts,<br>
solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore<br>
for compounds of formula (I). The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and<br>
crystal habits thereof.<br>
When preparing compounds of formula (I) In accordance with the invention, It is open to a person skilled<br>
in the art to routinely select the form of intermediate which provides the best combination of features for<br>
this purpose. Such features include the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the Intermediate<br>
form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on Isolation.<br>
Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or<br>
amorphous products or may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully<br>
crystalline. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as<br>
precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio<br>
frequency drying may be used for this purpose.<br>
They may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or<br>
in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be<br>
administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutlcally acceptable exclplents.<br>
The term 'excipient' is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention.<br>
The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of<br>
administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods<br>
for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for<br><br>
their preparation may be found, for example, in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", 19th Edition<br>
(Mack Publishing Company, 1995).<br>

Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
Suitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in US Patent No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in "Pharmaceutical Technology On-line", 25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298. The compounds of the Invention may also be administered directly Into the blood stream, Into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques. Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a'sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water. The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by<br><br>
lyophilisatlon, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled In the art.<br>
The solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be Increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents. Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be Immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thlxotroplc liquid for administration as an Implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations Include drug-coated stents and poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.<br>
The compounds of the Invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, derm ally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose Include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, Implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulslons. Llposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be Incorporated - see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999). Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, Iontophoresis, phonophoresls, sonophoresls and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. PowderjectTM, Bioject™, etc.) injection. Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be Immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the. form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellent, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bloadheslve agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin. The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbltan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactlc acid. Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product Is mlcronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenlsation, or spray drying.<br>

may vary from 1µ1 to 100µl. A typical formulation. may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene<br>
glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of<br>
propylene glycol Include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Suitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin<br>
sodium,  may be added to those formulations of the Invention  intended for inhaled/intranasal<br>
administration.<br>
Formulations for Inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified<br>
release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-,<br>
controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>
In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which<br>
delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a<br>
metered dose or "puff" containing from 2 to 30mg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose<br>
will typically be in the range 50 to 100mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as<br>
divided doses throughout the day.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a<br>
suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives<br>
may be used as appropriate.   Formulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be<br>
immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-,<br>
controlled-, targeted and programmed release.<br>

of drops of a micronised suspension or solution In isotonlc, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations<br>
suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel<br>
sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or<br>
vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid,<br>
polyvinylalcohol,  hyaluronic acid, a celluloslc polymer, for example,  hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for<br>
example, gelan gum, may be Incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride.<br>
Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis. Formulations for ocular/aural administration<br>
may be formulated to be Immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include<br>
delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.<br>
The compounds of the Invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as<br>
cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to<br>
improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the<br>
aforementioned modes of administration.   Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be<br>
generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion<br>
complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be<br>
used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser.   Most commonly used for these<br>
purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins,' examples of which may be found In International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br>
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined In the form of a kit suitable for coadminlstration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like. The kit of the invention Is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid. For administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention Is typically in the range 50mg to 100mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration and efficacy. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from 50mg to 100mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein. These dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60kg to 70kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, references herein to "treatment" include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.<br>

Sexual dysfunction (SD) is a significant clinical problem which can affect both males and females. The causes of SD may be both organic as well as psychological. Organic aspects of SD are typically caused by underlying vascular diseases, such as those associated with hypertension or diabetes mellitus, by prescription medication and/or by psychiatric disease such as depression. Physiological factors include fear, performance anxiety and interpersonal conflict. SD impairs sexual performance, diminishes self-esteem and disrupts personal relationships thereby inducing personal distress. In the clinic, SD disorders have been divided into female sexual dysfunction (FSD) disorders and male sexual dysfunction (MSD) disorders (Meiman et al, J. Urology, 1999,161.5-11).<br>
FSD can be defined as the difficulty or inability of a woman to find satisfaction in sexual expression. FSD is a collective term for several diverse female sexual disorders (Leiblum, S.R. (1998). Definition and classification of female sexual disorders. Int. J. Impotence Res., 10, S104-S106; Berman, J.R., Berman, L. &amp; Goldstein, I. (1999). Female sexual dysfunction: Incidence, pathophysiology, evaluations and treatment options. Urology, 54, 385-391). The woman may have lack of desire, difficulty with arousal or orgasm, pain with intercourse or a combination of these problems. Several types of disease, medications, injuries or psychological problems can cause FSD. Treatments in development are targeted to treat specific subtypes of FSD, predominantly desire and arousal disorders.<br>
The categories of FSD are best defined by contrasting them to the phases of normal female sexual response: desire, arousal and orgasm (Leiblum, S.R. (1998). Definition and classification of female sexual disorders, Int. J. Impotence Res., 10, S104-S106). Desire or libido is the drive for sexual expression. Its manifestations often include sexual thoughts either when in the company of an interested partner or when exposed to other erotic stimuli. Arousal is the vascular response to sexual stimulation, an important component of which Is genital engorgement and includes increased vaginal lubrication, elongation of the vagina and increased genital sensation/sensitivity. Orgasm Is the release of sexual tension that has culminated during arousal.<br>
Hence, FSD occurs when a woman has an inadequate or unsatisfactory response in any of these phases, usually desire, arousal or orgasm. FSD categories Include hypoactlve sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorders and sexual pain disorders. Although the compounds of the invention will improve the genital response to sexual stimulation (as in female sexual arousal disorder), in doing so it may also improve the associated pain, distress and discomfort associated with intercourse and so treat other female sexual disorders.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there Is provided the use of a compound of the Invention In the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and sexual pain disorder, more preferably for the treatment or prophylaxis of sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder, and sexual pain disorder, and most preferably in the treatment or prophylaxis of sexual arousal disorder.<br>
Hypoactlve sexual desire disorder is present if a woman has no or little desire to be sexual, and has no or few sexual thoughts or fantasies. This type of FSD can be caused by low testosterone levels, due either to natural menopause or to surgical menopause. Other causes include illness, medications, fatigue, depression and anxiety.<br>
Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is characterised by inadequate genital response to sexual stimulation. The genitalia do not undergo the engorgement that characterises normal sexual arousal.<br><br>
The vaginal walls are poorly lubricated, so that intercourse is painful. Orgasms may be impeded. Arousal disorder can be caused by reduced oestrogen at menopause or after childbirth and during lactation, as well as by illnesses, with vascular components such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. Other causes result from treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants eg SSRIs or antihypertensive agents. Sexual pain disorders (includes dyspareunla and vaginlsmus) is characterised by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.<br>
The prevalence of FSD is difficult to gauge because the term covers several types of problem, some of which are difficult to measure, and because the interest in treating FSD is relatively recent. Many women's sexual problems are associated either directly with the female ageing process or with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.<br>
Because FSD consists of several subtypes that express symptoms in separate phases of the sexual response cycle, there is not a single therapy. Current treatment of FSD focuses principally on psychological or relationship issues. Treatment of FSD is gradually evolving as more clinical and basic science studies are dedicated to the investigation of this medical problem. Female sexual complaints are not all psychological in pathophyslology, especially for those individuals who may have a component of vasculogenic dysfunction (eg FSAD) contributing to the overall female sexual complaint. There are at present no drugs licensed for the treatment of FSD. Empirical drug therapy includes oestrogen administration (topically or as hormone replacement therapy), androgens or mood-altering drugs such as buspirone or trazodone. These treatment options are often unsatisfactory due to low efficacy or unacceptable side effects.<br>
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) IV of the American Psychiatric Association defines Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) as being:<br>
"a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity adequate lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement. The disturbance must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty."<br>
The arousal response consists of vasocongestlon in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia. The disturbance causes marked distress and/or Interpersonal difficulty. FSAD is a highly prevalent sexual disorder affecting pre-, peri- and post menopausal (±HRT) women. It is<br>
associated with concomitant disorders such as depression, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and UG<br>
disorders.<br>
The primary consequences of FSAD are lack of engorgement/swelling, lack of lubrication and lack of<br>
pleasurable genital sensation. The secondary consequences of FSAD are reduced sexual desire, pain<br>
during intercourse and difficulty in achieving an orgasm.<br>
Male sexual dysfunction (MSD) is generally associated with either erectile dysfunction, also known as<br>
male erectile dysfunction (MED) and/or ejaculatory disorders such as premature ejaculation, anorgasmia<br>
(unable to achieve orgasm) or desire disorders such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (lack of interest<br>
In sex).<br>
PE is a relatively common sexual dysfunction in men. It has been defined in several different ways but the<br>
most widely accepted is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV one which states:<br><br>
"PE is a lifelong persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, upon or shortly after penetration and before the patient wishes it. The clinician must take Into account factors that affect duration of the excitement phase, such as age, novelty of the sexual partner or stimulation, and frequency of sexual activity. The disturbance causes marked distress of interpersonal difficulty."<br>
The International Classification of Diseases 10 definition states:<br>
'There is an Inability to delay ejaculation sufficiently to enjoy lovemaking, manifest as either of the following: (1) occurrence of ejaculation before or very soon after the beginning of intercourse (if a time limit is required: before or within 15 seconds of the beginning of intercourse); (2) ejaculation occurs In the absence of sufficient erection to make intercourse possible. The problem Is not the result of prolonged abstinence from sexual activity"<br>
Other definitions which have been used include classification on the following criteria:<br>
•	Related to partner's orgasm<br>
•	Duration between penetration and ejaculation<br>
•	Number of thrust and capacity for voluntary control<br>
Psychological factors may be involved In PE, with relationship problems, anxiety, depression, prior sexual failure all playing a role.<br>
Ejaculation Is dependent on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Efferent Impulses via the sympathetic nervous system to the vas deferens and the epididymis produce smooth muscle contraction, moving sperm Into the posterior urethra. Similar contractions of the seminal vesicles, prostatlc glands and the bulbouretheral glands Increase the volume and fluid content of semen. Expulsion of semen is mediated by efferent impulses originating from a population of lumber spinothalamic cells In the lumbosacral spinal cord (Coolen &amp; Truitt, Science, 2002, 297. 1566) which pass via the parasympathetic nervous system and cause rhythmic contractions of the bulbocavernous, ischiocavernous and pelvic floor muscles. Cortical control of ejaculation is still under debate in humans. In the rat the medial pre-optlc area and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus seem to be involved in ejaculation.<br>
Ejaculation comprises two separate components - emission and ejaculation. Emission is the deposition of seminal fluid and sperm from the distal epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles and prostrate into the prostatic urethra. Subsequent to this deposition Is the forcible expulsion of the seminal contents from the urethral meatus. Ejaculation is distinct from orgasm, which is purely a cerebral event. Often the two processes are coincidental.<br>
A pulse of oxytocin In peripheral serum accompanies ejaculation In mammals. In man oxytocin but not vasopresstn plasma concentrations are significantly raised at or around ejaculation. Oxytocin does not induce ejaculation itself; this process Is 100% under nervous control via α1-adrenoceptor/sympathetic nerves originating from the lumbar region of the spinal cord. The systemic pulse of oxytocin may have a role In the peripheral ejaculatory response. It could serve to modulate the contraction of ducts and glandular lobules throughout the male genital tract, thus influencing the fluid volume of different ejaculate components for example. Oxytocin released centrally Into the brain could Influence sexual behaviour, subjective appreciation of arousal (orgasm) and latency to subsequent ejaculation.<br><br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I), without the proviso, in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of sexual dysfunction, preferably male sexual dysfunction, most preferably premature ejaculation.<br>
It has been demonstrated in the scientific literature that the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus increases during pregnancy, most markedly before the onset of labour (Gimpl &amp; Fahrenhote, 2001, Physiological Reviews, 81 (2), 629-683.). Without being bound by any theory It is known that the inhibition of oxytocin can assist in preventing preterm labour and in resolving complications In labour. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I), without the proviso, In the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of preterm labour and complications in labour,<br>
Oxytocin has a role in feeding; ft reduces the desire to eat (Arlettl et a/,, Peptides, 1969,10, 89). By Inhibiting oxytocin it is possible to increase the desire to eat. Accordingly oxytocin inhibitors are useful in treating appetite and feeding disorders.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (!), without the proviso, in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of appetite and feeding disorders.<br>
Oxytocin Is implicated as one of the causes of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Analysis of prostate tissue have shown that patients with BPH have Increased levels of oxytocin (Nicholson &amp; Jenkin, Adv. Exp. Meet, &amp; Biol, 1995,395,529). Oxylocln antagonists can help treat this condition. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I), wihout the proviso, in the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of b&amp;nign prostatic hyperplasia.<br>
Oxytocin has a role in the causes of dysmenorrhoea due to its activity as a uterine vasoconstrictor (Akerlund, Ann. NY Acad, Sci., 1994,734, 47). Oxytocin antagonists can have a therapeutic effect on this condition.<br>
Accordingly, a further aspect of the Invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I), without the proviso, In the preparation of a medicament for the prevention of treatment of dysmenorrhoea.

The crystal structure was determined by Single Crystal X-Ray diffraction at room temperature and ambient relatiye humidity using a Bruker SMART APEX Single Crystal X-Ray diffractometer and Mo Ka radiation. Intensities were integrated (SMART y5.622 (control) and SAINT y6.02 (integration) software, Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wl 1994) from seyeral series of exposures where each exposure coyered 0.3° in co, with an exposure time of 30 s and the total data set was more than a sphere. Data were corrected for absorption using the multiscans method (SADABS, Program for scaling and correction of area detector data, G. M. Sheldrick, Uniyersity of Gfittlngen, 1997 (based on the method of R. H. Blessing, Acta Cryst. 1995, A51, 33-38)).<br>

The X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature using a Bruker AXS D4 powder X-ray diffractometer (Cu Ka radiation) fitted with an automatic sample changer, a theta-theta goniometer, automatic beam diyergence slits, a secondary monochromator and a scintillation counter. The powder was mounted on a 12mm diameter a silicon wafer specimen holder. The sample was rotated while being irradiated with Copper Kot1 X-rays (wayelength = 1.5406 Angstroms) with the X-ray tube operated at 40ky/40mA. The analyses were performed with the goniometer running in continuous mode set for a 5 second count per 0.02° step oyer a two theta range of 2° to 55°. The PXRD pattern of Example 25A exhibited the following characteristic diffraction peaks<br><br>
Calculation of the Powder X-Ray Diffraction Pattern from the Crystal Structure<br>
26 angles, d-spacings and relatiye intensities (Table I) were calculated from the single crystal structure of<br>
Example 25A using the "Reflex Powder Diffraction" module of Accelrys MS Modelling™ [yersion 3.0].<br>
Pertinent simulation parameters were:<br>
Wayelength = 1.5406 A (Cu Ka)<br>
Polarisation Factor = 0.5<br>
Pseudo-yoigt Profile (U = 0.01, y = -0.001, W = 0.002)<br>
The calculated pattern represents that of a pure phase of Example 25A since it Is deriyed from a single crystal structure. A comparison of the measured and calculated patterns is shown in Figure I and demonstrates that the bulk is represented by the single crystal structure.
