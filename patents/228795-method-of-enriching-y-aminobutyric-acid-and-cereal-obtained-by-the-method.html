				<td>METHOD FOR ENRICHING γ-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID AND CEREAL OBTAINED<br>
BY THE METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for enriching<br>
y-aminobutyric acid and grain obtained by the method.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
It has previously been known that a food material<br>
containing enriched γ-anmobutyric acid is obtained by<br>
immersing in water at least one member selected from the group<br>
consisting of rice germ, germ-containing rice bran, rice with<br>
germ, wheat germ, and wieat-germ-containing wheat gluten,<br>
under conditions consisting of a pH between 2.5 and 7.5 and<br>
a temperature of 50°C or lower (refer to Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 7-213252, for example).<br>
According to the ai orementioned Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open Nc. 7-213252, it has been discovered<br>
that glutamic acid, which is a precursor substance of<br>
y-aminobutyric acid, is contained at a high concentration in<br>
the surface portions of germ, rice grain, and wheat, and that<br>
such glutamic acid is rapidly converted to y-aminobutyric acid<br>
when it is immersed in vater.<br>
However, in the method described in the aforementioned<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-213252, since<br>
y-aminobutyric acid is specifically enriched only in the germ<br>
portion or bran layer, such y-aminobutyric acid is impaired<br><br>
during grain polishing.  In addition, since germ or the like<br>
is immersed in water at 500C or lower for approximately 8 hours,<br>
the growth of microorganisms is activatedafter such immersion,<br>
and there is a risk of causing putrefaction. In order to solve<br>
such problems, it is possible to apply a method of immersing<br>
brown rice in water containing dissolved oxygen of 20 ppm or<br>
more to enrich γ-aminobut.yric acid (refer to Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-open No. 2000-300196, for example), or a<br>
method of intermittently adding hot water at 50°C or lower<br>
to brown rice in a dark room using a hot water shower, without<br>
immersion in water, in ordsr to adjust humidity and temperature,<br>
thereby preventing the undesirable odors caused by<br>
fermentation during germination (refer to Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2000-291423, for example).<br>
However, the method described in the aforementioned<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-300196, which<br>
comprises immersing browr. rice in water containing dissolved<br>
oxygen of 20 ppm or more to enrich γ-aminobutyric acid, has<br>
been problematic in that immersion is carried out for 16 hours<br>
while exchanging water every 6 hours to increase the dissolved<br>
oxygen, thereby causing complicated operations. Moreover,<br>
in the method described in the aforementioned Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open No. 2 000-291423, which comprises<br>
intermittently adding hot weather at 50°C or lower to brown rice<br>
using a hot water shower, in order to produce germed brown<br>
rice, since the water absorption rate of rice grain has not<br>
been considered, there has been a risk of causing grain break.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Taking into consideration the aforementioned problems,<br>
it is a technical object, of the present invention to provide<br>
a method of adding water to grain to suppress denaturation<br>
of such grain, such as grain break, thereby significantly<br>
enriching y-aminobutyric acid contained therein, and to<br>
provide grain obtained by the above method.<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, thepresent<br>
invention relates to a technical means for slowly adding water<br>
to dry grain, the water content of which has previously been<br>
adjusted between 10% and 15%, at a water addition rate of 0.5%<br>
to 2 .0%/h, in order to provide a water content of 2 0% to 3 0%;<br>
placing the grain into a r.ank; and tempering it for 2 to 10<br>
hours.<br>
By this technical mecins, when water is added to grain,<br>
the water addition rate is limited to 0.5% to 2. 0%/h. Thus,<br>
the water absorption rate of grain becomes slow, and<br>
denaturation of the grain, such as grain break, is suppressed.<br>
At the same time, high physiological activity, utilization<br>
of the properties of germ with a high water absorption rate,<br>
and aerobic properties can be secured. Accordingly, as<br>
compared with the conventional method involving immersion in<br>
water, this technical means is able to significantly enrich<br>
γ-aminobutyric acid.<br>
In addition, when water is added to the above described<br>
dry grain, cloudy water droplets having a particle diameter<br>
of 0.1 mm or less are attached to the surface thereof so that<br><br>
slow addition of water is carried out, thereby allowing the<br>
water content to shift from the surface of the grain to its<br>
interior.<br>
Moreover, the above described hydrated grain may be<br>
tempered, while outside air may be introduced into the tank<br>
and ventilation may be provided.<br>
Furthermore, a gramineous (glasslike) plant such as rice,<br>
wheat, or corn, may be used as the above described dry grain.<br>
When brown rice is used as the above described, dry grain,<br>
water may be added to the brown rice having a water content<br>
previously adjusted to approximately 14%, at a rate of less<br>
than 0.5%/h, until the water content thereof reaches 17%, and<br>
after the water content thereof exceeds 17%, the water addition<br>
rate may be gradually increased, to a rate of 0.5% to 2.0%/h.<br>
As stated above, according to the present invention, water<br>
is slowly added to harvested and dried grain having a water content<br>
previously  adjusted   to 10% to 15% at a water addition rate of<br>
0.5% to 2.0%/h, in  order ~o provide a water content of 20% to 30%.<br>
Thereafter, the grain is placed into a tank, followed by<br>
tempering for 2 to 10 hours . Accordingly, when water is added<br>
to the grain, the water addition rate is limited to 0.5% to<br>
2 . 0%/h, so that the water absorption rate of the grain becomes<br>
slow. Thus, while suppressing denaturation of the grain, such<br>
as grain break, γ-aminobuyric acid can be enriched in the<br>
albumen portion thereof. Thus, γ-aminobutyric acid enriched<br>
in the albumen portion is not damaged by grain polishing or<br>
the subsequent processing.<br><br>
Accordingly, even when the grain is processed into the<br>
form of rice with germ, polished rice, or rice flour,<br>
y-aminobutyric acid is maintained at a high concentration.<br>
Moreover, since the aerobic properties of grain are<br>
maintained in this methcd, y-aminobutyric acid can be<br>
significantly enriched, as compared with the conventional<br>
method involving immersion in water. In contrast, intheprior<br>
art technique, when y-aminobutyric acid is generated only in<br>
the germ portion or bran ] ayer of grain, such y-aminobutyric<br>
acid is almost completely ost by rice polishing or processing<br>
(refer to Table 1 below).<br>
Furthermore, when wa;er is added to the above described<br>
dry grain, cloudy water d::oplets having a particle diameter<br>
of 0.1 mm or less are attached to the surface thereof so that<br>
slow addition of water is carried out. Thus, fine water<br>
droplets that are much mo::e smaller than the water droplets<br>
provided by the conventional hot.water shower are attached<br>
to the surface of the grain, and thereafter, the water content<br>
is uniformly absorbed into the cell tissues of the grain.<br>
Accordingly, denaturation of the grain, such as grain break,<br>
can be suppressed.<br>
The hydrated grain obtained in that way is tempered, while<br>
outside air is introduced into the tank and ventilation is<br>
provided. Hence, an increase in he temperature in the tank<br>
is suppressed, in order to prevent degeneration of the grain,<br>
and at the same time, toxic gas generated in the tank can be<br>
eliminated.<br><br>
When brown rice is used as the above described dry grain,<br>
water is added to the brown rice having a water content<br>
previously adjusted to approximately 14%, at a rate of less<br>
than 0.5%/h, until the water content thereof reaches 17%.<br>
After the water content thereof exceeds 17%, the water addition<br>
rate is gradually increased to a rate of 0 .5% to 2 . 0%/h. Thus,<br>
the water absorption rate of the grain is suppressed until<br>
the water content of the brown rice reaches 17%, and<br>
denaturation of the grain, such as grain break, can be thereby<br>
prevented. When such brown rice water content exceeds 17%,<br>
the water absorption rate is increased, so that grain<br>
containing enriched γ-aminobutyric acid can be obtained in<br>
a shorter time than is usual.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION of THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 is a process chart showing one embodiment of a<br>
method of enriching γ-aminobutyric acid (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "GABA"). FIG. 2 is a view showing the relationship<br>
between the water content of brown rice and a water addition<br>
rate.<br>
Hereafter, the method of enriching GABA of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
With regard to grain used as a raw material, gramineous<br>
(glasslike) plants such as rice, wheat or corn, or cereals<br>
containing a large amount of protein, such as soybeans, can<br>
be used.  When brown rice  is used a such grain,  for example,<br>
harvested  and  dried  grain  having  a  water  content  previously<br>
adjusted  to  approximately  14%  is  used  (step  1  in  FIG.l).<br>
Subsequently,  water  is  slowly  added  to  such  a  raw  material,<br>
resulting in a water contert between 20% and 30% (step 2 in FIG.l).<br>
In order not to  cause  denaturation of grain, such as grain break,<br>
with regard to such a treatnent to slowly add water to grain,<br><br>
water is added to the gredn at a rate of increasing the water<br>
content of the grain to 0. 5% per hour (0.5%/h), until the water<br>
content thereof reaches .'.7% . After the water content thereof<br>
exceeds 17%, the water addition rate is gradually increased,<br>
and water is added at a rate between 0 . 5% and 2 . 0%/h (see FIG.<br>
2) . It is desired that a preferred water addition method<br>
comprise spraying water to form cloudy water droplets and<br>
attaching the water droplets on the surface of brown rice.<br>
The diameter of such a cloudy water droplet is preferably set<br>
at 0.1 mm or less.<br>
After completion of such water addition, the grain is<br>
transferred into a tank or the like, and tempering (which means<br>
an operation to leave grain for a certain period of time in<br>
order to achieve the equ.-iibration of the water added to the<br>
grain) is then carried out for 2 to lO hours (step 3 in FIG.<br>
1) . The optimum envirormental temperature is between 16°C<br>
and 24°C during such tempering. If outside air is introduced<br>
into the tank and ventilation is provided, the environment<br>
becomes more preferable. The temperature of water is the same<br>
as the temperature of rvnning water, and it is unnecessary<br>
to adjust the pH thereo::. A series of operations can be<br>
sufficiently carried out at a room, temperature of approximately<br>
20°C. After completion cf the tempering, the grain is dried<br>
by a conventional drying nethod, unti1 it has a. water content<br>
suitable for rice polishincr (step 4 in FIG. 1) . Thereafter,<br>
it is possible to apply a rice polishing method (step 5 in<br>
FIG. 1) or a method of pclishing the rice while maintaining<br><br>
a high water content of the grain after completion of the<br>
tempering (step 6 in Fig. 1) . Otherwise, it may also be<br>
possible that the grain after completion of the tempering be<br>
heated as appropriate, without grain polishing, in order to<br>
process it in the form of parboiled rice or pregelatinized<br>
rice.<br>
In the case of the grain obtained in that way, a GABA<br>
content and a magnesium content in the albumen thereof at a<br>
"polished rice yield of 90% are significantly higher than those<br>
of normal white rice.<br>
Subsequently, an example of a device for carrying out<br>
the method of enriching CABA will be described with reference<br>
to FIGS. 3 and 4. FIG. 3 is a schematic front view showing<br>
a device for carrying out the method of enriching GABA. FIG.<br>
4 is a schematic side visw showing a water-spraying device.<br>
In FIG. 3, reference numeral 1 denotes a water-spraying<br>
device. The water-spraying device 1 comprises, as main<br>
components, a grain elevator 3 provided in a machine casing<br>
2,	dual storage tanks 4,5 for storing the grain elevated by<br>
the grain elevator 3, a belt conveyor 6 for transporting the<br>
grain discharged from the storage tanks 4,5 in the form of<br>
a layer, and a rotary ba.:rel 7 for adding water to the grain<br>
transported by the belt conveyor 6.<br>
A raw material-supplying hopper 8 for supplying grain<br>
as a rawmaterial is provided at the bottom of the grain elevator<br>
3,	and a falling gutter 9 equipped with a bidirectional valve<br>
is provided at the top of the grain elevator 3 .  In the above<br><br>
falling gutter 9, a supply pipe 10 directed towards the storage<br>
tank 4 and a supply pipe 11 directed towards the storage tank<br>
5 are provided. At the bottom of the storage tanks 4,5, an<br>
opening and closing shutters 12,13 are provided, whereby the<br>
grain is fallen at an appropriate flow rate.<br>
The belt conveyor 5 is formed by winding an endless<br>
conveyor belt 6c around a ;?air of sprockets 6a, 6b. Asupplying<br>
gutter 14 for supplying grain into the rotary barrel 7 is<br>
providedat the transportation terminating portion of the belt<br>
conveyor 6 . In the suppl /ing gutter 14 , a water content sensor<br>
42 for surveying the water content of grain before being<br>
supplied into the rotary barrel 7 is provided. The type of<br>
this water content sensor 42 is not particularly limited, as<br>
long as it is able to precisely measure the water content of<br>
grain. Examples of such a water content sensor may include<br>
an electric resistance type, a capacitance type, and a near<br>
infrared radiation type<br>
The surrounding portion of the above rotary barrel 7 is<br>
supported by a plurality of motor rollers 15 in a rotatable<br>
manner. In addition, in the rotary barrel 7, the grain<br>
supplying side is disposed at a higher position, and the grain<br>
discharging side is disposed at a lower position. On the grain<br>
discharging side of the rotary barrel 7, there is provided<br>
a discharging gutter 17 equipped with a switching valve 16<br>
for discharging the grain in order to use it to the next step<br>
or for circulating the grain to the water-spraying device 1.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a plurality of impellers 18 are<br>
provided on the internal surface of the above rotary barrel<br>
7 along the direction of the length thereof. When grain is<br>
supplied into the rotary barrel 7, the grain is lifted up by<br>
the impellers 18 as a result of the rotation of the barrel<br>
7, and it is then fallen imnediately before reaching the upper<br>
portion, so that the grain can be stirred. An atomizer 19<br>
is provided in the barrel 7 . As such an atomizer 19, a two-phase<br>
flow nozzle for atomizing liquid utilizing a high-speed flow<br>
such as compressed air, or a device for atomizing a liquid<br>
into the form of particles with a diameter of 0.1 mm or less<br>
by ultrasonic wave oscillation and then suspending the<br>
particles in the air current in the form of fog using a fan,<br>
can also be adopted. In the present embodiment, a two-phase<br>
flow nozzle for generating- fine fog with a mean particle<br>
diameter between 10 and 50 µm was used as the atomizer 19 (for<br>
example, model BIMV02, manufactured by Ikeuchi Company).<br>
In FIG. 3 , reference numeral 2 0 denotes a tempering tank.<br>
This tempering tank comprises a tank portion 21, a supply valve<br>
22 provided at the upper portion of the tank portion 21, a<br>
supply hopper 23 that is collected with the supply valve 22,<br>
a discharge valve 24 provided at the bottom portion of the<br>
tank portion 21, a discharge- gutter 25 that is connected with<br>
the discharge valve 24, and a ventilator 26 for taking fresh<br>
air such as outside air into the tank portion 21. An air<br>
incorporating port 27 and an air discharging port 28 are<br>
provided on the tank portion 21. The above ports are connected<br><br>
with the above ventilato:: 26 via circulation pathways 29, 30,<br>
respectively. The ventilator 26 has a simple structure, which<br>
comprises a dust prevent..ve filter 31 for eliminating dusts<br>
from outside air and a fan 32 for aspirating fresh outside<br>
air and supplying it to :he tank portion 21. For example,<br>
ventilation can be carried out in the tank portion 21 at an<br>
air quantity of 6 m3/ton•1. Reference numeral 33 denotes a<br>
transportation means for connecting the water-spraying device<br>
1 in the previous step w:.th the tempering tank 20.<br>
Moreover, in FIG. 3, reference numeral 34 denotes a grain<br>
polisher. This grain polisher comprises a polishing<br>
trochanter 35, which is a:tached to a main axis (not shown<br>
in the figure) and has a polishing roll, and a bran-removing<br>
polishing tube 3 6 having a porous wall, which is provided around<br>
the above polishing trochanter 35. A polishing chamber 37<br>
is provided in a space between the polishing trochanter 35<br>
and the bran-removing polishing tube 36. Also, a discharge<br>
port (not shown in the figu:re) is provided at the end portion<br>
of the polishing chamber 37 . Moreover, an external resistance<br>
38	comprising a resistance board for pressing towards the above<br>
discharge port and an anchor is provided. Reference numeral<br>
39	denotes a supply hopper o:: the grain polisher 34, reference<br>
numeral 40 denotes a polished product-discharging gutter of<br>
the grain polisher 34, and reference numeral 41 denotes a<br>
transportation means for connecting the tempering tank 2 0 in<br>
the previous step with the grain polisher 34.<br><br>
Hereafter, the actions of the devices shown in FIGS. 3<br>
and 4 will be described. Grain used as a raw material having<br>
a water content previously adjusted to approximately 14%, is<br>
supplied from the raw material-supplying hopper 8. The grain<br>
is elevated by the grain elevator 3, and it is then stored<br>
in the storage tanks 4,5. Thereafter, the grain discharged<br>
from the storage tanks 4, 5 is transported by the belt conveyor<br>
6	in the form of a layer, and it is then supplied into the<br>
rotary barrel 7 via the supplying gutter 14 . The rotary barrel<br>
7	rotates at a rate of 6 to 12 revolutions /minute in order<br>
to stir the grain, and at the same time, water is added by<br>
the atomizer 19 in the from of fine fog with a mean particle<br>
diameter between 10 and 5 3 µm. During this step, water is<br>
added, while the water content of the grain is surveyed by<br>
the water content sensor 42 provided in the supplying gutter<br>
14. That is to say, water is added, while the grain is<br>
circulated via the grain elevator 3. Thus, water is added<br>
to the grain at a water addition rate of 0. 5%/h until the water<br>
content thereof reaches 17% . After the water content thereof<br>
exceeds 17%, the water addition rate is gradually increased<br>
to a rate of 0.5% to 2.0%/h When the water content reaches<br>
20% to 30%, circulation of the grain is terminated, in order<br>
to terminate the water addition, and the grain is discharged<br>
from the discharging gutter 17.<br>
Thereafter, the grain having a water content between 2 0%<br>
and 3 0% is supplied to the sapply hopper 23 of the tempering<br>
tank 20 by  the transportation means 33. The grain supplied<br><br>
to the supply hopper 23 is accumulated and stored in the tank<br>
portion 21 by opening the supply valve 22. The grain<br>
accumulated and stored in. this way is then subjected to<br>
tempering for 2 to 15 hcurs. The optimum environmental<br>
temperature applied durir.g such tempering is between 16°C and<br>
24°C. In order to incorpoi ate outside air into the tankportion<br>
21, the ventilator 2 6 may be operated, in order to carry out<br>
ventilation. That is, when the fan 32 is operated, outside<br>
air, from which dusts have been removed by the dust preventive<br>
filter 31, is incorporated, and the outside air is then supplied<br>
to the tank portion 21 via the circulation pathway 29. The<br>
air is then discharged from the tank portion 21 via the<br>
circulat ion pathway 30 . Herein, the air quantity is 6m3/ton-h<br>
or less, for example. After completion of the tempering, the<br>
grain is discharged from that tempering tank 20 by the discharge<br>
valve 24 through the discharge gutter 25.<br>
The grain tempered in the tempering tank 20 is supplied<br>
to the supply hopper 39 of the grain polisher 34 by the<br>
transportation means 41, followed by grain polishing. That<br>
is to say, the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 indicates a method<br>
for directly polishing the grain with a high water content<br>
(a water content between 2 0% and 30%) obtained after completion<br>
of the tempering (refer to step 6 in FiG.'l). However, the<br>
grain polishing method is not limited thereto, and a<br>
commercially available gra:.n-drying machine may be provided<br>
as a pre-step of the grain polisher 34. The tempered grain<br>
with a high water content is supplied to the polishing chamber<br><br>
37 of the grain polisher 34, and it is then polished by the<br>
polishing trochanter 35. In addition, since the discharge<br>
port of the polishing chamber 37 is compressed by the external<br>
resistance 38, the inside of the polishing chamber 37 becomes<br>
a moderately high-pressure state, so that a bran layer or germ<br>
can be peeled, thereby conducting grain polishing.<br>
In the case of the c-rain obtained in that way, when a<br>
white rice yield is 90%, for example, a GABA content and a<br>
magnesium content in albunen are significantly increased, as<br>
compared with normal whi :e rice.<br>
Example 1<br>
Brown rice was used as ,i rawmaterial, and the water content<br>
thereof had previously been adjusted to approximately 14%.<br>
Thereafter, slow water addition was carried out, in order to<br>
provide a water content of 20% to 30%. In order not to cause<br>
rice break, such a slow wa~:er addition treatment was carried<br>
out at a rate of 0.5%/h, until the water content reached 17%.<br>
After the water content exceeded 17%, the water addition rate<br>
was gradually increased to a rate of 0.5% to 0.9%/h. As such<br>
water to be added, drinkable water such as running water,<br>
distilled water, well water, acidic water,, or electrolytic<br>
saline water, is preferabLe. In particular, when<br>
sterilization is also intended, a hypochlorite solution having<br>
an effective chlorine concentration between 0.1 ppm and 50<br>
ppm may also be used. A preferred water addition method<br>
comprises spraying water, in order to add cloudy water droplets<br>
onto the surface of brown rice. The diameter of such an<br><br>
atomized water droplet was set at 0.1 mm or less. After<br>
completion of such water addition, the brown rice was<br>
transferred into a tank or the like, followed by tempering<br>
for 2 to 10 hours. The optimum environmental temperature<br>
during such tempering was ;;et between 16°C and 24°C, and outside<br>
air was introduced into the tank for ventilation. As a water<br>
temperature, the temperature of running water was applied.<br>
The control of a pH thereof was not necessary. A series of<br>
operations were carried out at a room temperature of<br>
approximately 20°C. After completion of the tempering, the<br>
brown rice or husk was dried by a conventional drying method,<br>
until the water content thereof was adjusted to a degree<br>
suitable for hulling and polishing. Thereafter, the brown<br>
rice or husk was subjected to hulling and polishing.<br>
In the case of the polished rice obtained in that way,<br>
when a yield was 90%, the GABA content in the albumen thereof<br>
was approximately 20 times increased as comparedwith that<br>
of normal white rice (see FIG. 5) . The magnesium content in<br>
the albumen thereof was approximately 3 times increased, as<br>
compared with that of normal white rice, when a yield was 90%<br>
(see PIG. 6).<br>
Example 2<br>
Brown rice ("Hoshinoyume" or "Kirara")  was used as a raw<br>
material, and the water cor. tent thereof had previously been<br>
adjusted to approximately 14%. Thereafter, slow water<br>
addition was carried out, ir. order to provide a water content<br>
of 20% to 3 0%. In order not to cause rice break, such a slow<br><br>
water addition treatment was carried out at a rate of 0.5%/h,<br>
until the water content reached 17%. After the water content<br>
exceeded 17%, the water addition rate was gradually increased<br>
to a rate of 0.5% to 0.9%/h. As such water to be added, running<br>
water or distilled water is preferably used. When<br>
sterilization is also intended, ahypochlorite solution having<br>
an effective chlorine concentration between 0.1 ppm and 50<br>
ppm may also be used. A preferred water addition method<br>
comprises spraying water, ;.n order to add cloudy water droplets<br>
onto the surface of brown rice. The diameter of such an<br>
atomized water droplet wc.s set at 0.1 mm or less. After<br>
completion of such water addition, the brown rice was<br>
transferred into a tank or.  the like, followed by tempering<br>
for 2 or 3 hours . The optimum, environmental temperature during<br>
such tempering was set between 16C'C and 24°C, and outside air<br>
was introduced into the tank for ventilation. As a water<br>
temperature, the temperature of running water was applied.<br>
The control of a pH thereof was not necessary. A series of<br>
operations were carried out at a room temperature of<br>
approximately 20°C. After completion of the tempering, the<br>
brown rice or husk was subjected to evaporation by heating<br>
at 130°C for 3 minutes. It was then dried by a conventional<br>
drying method, until the water content thereof was adjusted<br>
to a degree suitable for hulling and polishing. Thereafter,<br>
the brown rice or husk was subjected to hulling and polishing.<br>
In the case of the pol-.shed rice obtained in that way,<br>
when a yield was 90%, the GABA content thereof was 4.3 times<br><br>
in the albumen portion thereof, the GABA content in the germ<br>
potion thereof was 4.4 times, and the GABA content in the bran<br>
layer portin thereof was 1.2 times increased, as compared<br>
with the case where no enrichment treatment was carried out<br>
(refer to Table 1) . In terms of the disintegration rate of<br>
rice grain obtained in the. case where the obtained brown rice<br>
was immersed in water for 24 hours, the present production<br>
method was compared with ;he conventional production method<br>
of immersing grain in water for enrichment. As a result, it<br>
was found that the disintegration rate of the conventional<br>
production method was 79% whereas that of the present<br>
production method was 10%. Accordingly, using the present<br>
production method, the form of rice can be maintained even<br>
during rice boiling, and as a result, brown rice that is<br>
excellent in terms of appearance and taste, having only a slight<br>
extent of elution of starch, can be obtained.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Wheat grain was used ,as a raw material, and the water<br>
content thereof had previously been adjusted to approximately<br>
12%. Thereafter, slow watei addition was carried out, inorder<br>
to provide a water content of 21% to 25%.  In order not to<br><br>
cause denaturation of the wheat grain, such a slow water<br>
addition treatment was carried out by the aforementioned spray<br>
method at a water addition rate of 1.0% to 2.0%/h, until the<br>
water content reached 21% to 3 0%. As such water to be added,<br>
running water was used. After completion of such water<br>
addition, the wheat grain. was transferred into a tank or the<br>
like, followed by tempering for 3 to 10 hours. The optimum<br>
environmental temperature during such tempering was set<br>
between 7°C and 13°C, and outside air was introduced into the<br>
tank for ventilation. After completion of the tempering, the<br>
wheat grain was dried by a conventional drying method, until<br>
the water content thereof was adjusted to a degree suitable<br>
for milling. Thereafter, che wheat grain was subjected to<br>
milling.<br>
When the wheat flour obtained in that way was compared<br>
with commercially availabl.e wheat flour F, the GABA content<br>
was approximately 3.8 timss increased (see FIG. 7).<br>
Example 4<br>
Corn grain was used as a rawmaterial, and the water content<br>
thereof had previously been adjusted to approximately 14%.<br>
Thereafter, slow water addition was carried out, in order to<br>
provide a water content of 1.5% to 30%. In order not to cause<br>
denaturation of the corn girain, such a slow water addition<br>
treatment was carried out by the aforementioned spray method<br>
at a water addition rate oif 1.2% to 2.0%/h. As such water<br>
to be added, running water was used. After completion of such<br>
water addition, the corn grain was transferred into a tank<br><br>
or the like, followed by tempering for 5 to 15 hours. The<br>
optimum environmental temperature during such tempering was<br>
set between 10°C and 3 0°C, and outside air was introduced into<br>
the tank for ventilation. After completion of the tempering,<br>
the corn grain was dried by a conventional drying method, until<br>
the water content thereof was adjusted to a degree suitable<br>
for hulling, germremovaL, milling, and grinding. Thereafter,<br>
the corn grain was subjected to hulling, germ removal, milling,<br>
and grinding.<br>
When the corn grain obtained in that way was compared<br>
with corn grain obtained by continuous immersion, the GABA<br>
content was approximately 1.9 to 2.3 times increased (see FIG.<br>
8) .<br>
