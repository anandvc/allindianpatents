				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention includes compounds that are described by general formula (I), its stereoisomers, its radioisotopes, its N-oxides, its polymorphs, its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, its pharmaceutical^ acceptable solvates, its useful bio-active metabolites and any suitable combination of the above.<br><br>
Further the present invention also includes the processes for preparing such compounds of the general formula (I), its stereoisomers, its radioisotopes, its N-oxides, its polymorphs, its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts, its pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, its useful bio-active metabolites and also includes any suitable combination of the above.<br>
The invention also describes various methods of administering the compounds described by general formula (I), i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms and the use of such compounds and compositions in either therapy or diagnosis.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention are 5-HT (Serotonin) ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists. The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention, by the virtue of its chemical characteristic, could either independently or simultaneously modulate the melatonin receptor i.e. either these compounds are melatonergic ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists, or they interact with both 5-HT as well as melatonin receptor.<br>
Thus, compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are useful for treating diseases wherein activity of either 5-HT (Serotonin) and/or melatonin is modulated to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Hence, the compounds of general formula (I) of this invention could also be useful in treating the psychotic, affective, vegetative and psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia and the extrapyramidal motor side effects of other antipsychotic drugs; neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting; and in modulation of eating behavior and thus are useful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. Background of the Invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in numerous diseases and conditions, which originate from central nervous system. Such CNS diseases and conditions are linked to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other bodily states. (References: Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotoninergic Neuronal Systems, in "Biology of Serotoninergic Transmission", ed. by Osborne N. N., J Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. (1982), 221-247; Boullin D. J., et. al., in "Serotonin in Mental Abnormalities", International Association for The Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency, Wiley, Checester, 1978, pp. 1-340; Barchas J. et. al., in "Serotonin and Behavior", Academic Press, NY (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in the peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is a lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotoninergic systems. Particularly, preferred are those compounds, which have receptor-specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, such as anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, certain neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References: Gershon M. D. et. al., 5- Hydroxytryptamine and enteric neurons, in the book: The Peripheral Actions of 5- Hydroxytryptamine, edited by J. R. Fozard. New York: Oxford, 1989, p. 247-273; Saxena P. R., et. al., Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990), supplement 15, p. 17-34).<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HTI_7) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been formally classified (References: Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990), 14, 35; and Hoyer D. et al, Pharmacol. Rev. (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-type identity, distribution, structure and function suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The 5-HT6 receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma et al, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-327; and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276). Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the 5-HTe receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Roth et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. (1994), 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol. Pharmacol, 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT6 receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17/18,1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that the compound, which antagonizes 5-HTe receptors, will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system. It has also been reported that antagonism of 5-HT6 receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal (WO 03/066056 A1).<br>
There is very strong evidence that Melatonin is important for the regulation of a variety of neural and endocrine functions, especially those that exhibit circadian and circannual rhythmicity. Great interest therefore lies in the possibility of making available to the clinician melatonin analogues that are metabolically more stable and have an agonist or antagonist character and of which the therapeutic effect may be expected to be superior to that of the hormone itself. PCT patent application gives extensive literature on studies with Melatonin and potential therapeutic application of various ligands reported till date.<br>
Those various effects are exerted via the intermediary of specific Melatonin receptors. Molecular biology studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of receptor sub-types that are capable of binding that hormone (Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1995, 16, p. 50; WO 97 04094). Melatonin acts on the CNS to affect neural mechanisms through receptors located in the brain. Additionally, a number of studies indicate the existence of direct effects of Melatonin in peripheral organs via peripheral melatonin receptors. Melatonin receptors are present in the heart, lungs, prostate gland, gonads, white blood cells, retina, pituitary, thyroid, kidney, gut and blood vessels (Withyachumnarnkul et al. Life Sci, 12 65, 1986). Three Melatonin receptor subtypes have been identified so far MT-I , MT-2 and Mel 1 c (Barreft et al, Biol. Signals Recept, 1999, 8: 6-14).<br>
There is evidence suggesting both Melatonin agonists and antagonists would be of potential therapeutic use for a variety of maladies and conditions.

The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention are 5-HT (Serotonin) ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists. The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention, by the virtue of its chemical characteristic, could either independently or simultaneously modulate the melatonin receptor i.e. either these compounds are melatonergic ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists, or they interact with both 5-HT as well as melatonin receptor.<br>
Thus, compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are useful for treating diseases wherein activity of either 5-HT (Serotonin) and/or melatonin is modulated to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Hence, the compounds of general formula (I) of this invention could also be useful in treating the psychotic, affective, vegetative and psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia and the extrapyramidal motor side effects of other antipsychotic drugs; neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting; and in modulation of eating behavior and thus are useful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. Background of the Invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in numerous diseases and conditions, which originate from central nervous system. Such CNS diseases and conditions are linked to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other bodily states. (References: Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotoninergic Neuronal Systems, in "Biology of Serotoninergic Transmission", ed. by Osborne N. N., J Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. (1982), 221-247; Boullin D. J., et. al., in "Serotonin in Mental Abnormalities", International Association for The Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency, Wiley, Checester, 1978, pp. 1-340; Barchas J. et. al., in "Serotonin and Behavior", Academic Press, NY (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in the peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is a lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotoninergic systems. Particularly, preferred are those compounds, which have receptor-specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, such as anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, certain neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References: Gershon M. D. et. al., 5- Hydroxytryptamine and enteric neurons, in the book: The Peripheral Actions of 5- Hydroxytryptamine, edited by J. R. Fozard. New York: Oxford, 1989, p. 247-273; Saxena P. R., et. al., Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990), supplement 15, p. 17-34).<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (5-HTI_7) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been formally classified (References: Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990), 14, 35; and Hoyer D. et al, Pharmacol. Rev. (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-type identity, distribution, structure and function suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The 5-HT6 receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma et al, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-327; and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276). Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the 5-HTe receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Roth et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. (1994), 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol. Pharmacol, 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT6 receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17/18,1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that the compound, which antagonizes 5-HTe receptors, will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system. It has also been reported that antagonism of 5-HT6 receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal (WO 03/066056 A1).<br>
There is very strong evidence that Melatonin is important for the regulation of a variety of neural and endocrine functions, especially those that exhibit circadian and circannual rhythmicity. Great interest therefore lies in the possibility of making available to the clinician melatonin analogues that are metabolically more stable and have an agonist or antagonist character and of which the therapeutic effect may be expected to be superior to that of the hormone itself. PCT patent application gives extensive literature on studies with Melatonin and potential therapeutic application of various ligands reported till date.<br>
Those various effects are exerted via the intermediary of specific Melatonin receptors. Molecular biology studies have demonstrated the existence of a number of receptor sub-types that are capable of binding that hormone (Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1995, 16, p. 50; WO 97 04094). Melatonin acts on the CNS to affect neural mechanisms through receptors located in the brain. Additionally, a number of studies indicate the existence of direct effects of Melatonin in peripheral organs via peripheral melatonin receptors. Melatonin receptors are present in the heart, lungs, prostate gland, gonads, white blood cells, retina, pituitary, thyroid, kidney, gut and blood vessels (Withyachumnarnkul et al. Life Sci, 12 65, 1986). Three Melatonin receptor subtypes have been identified so far MT-I , MT-2 and Mel 1 c (Barreft et al, Biol. Signals Recept, 1999, 8: 6-14).<br>
There is evidence suggesting both Melatonin agonists and antagonists would be of potential therapeutic use for a variety of maladies and conditions.
