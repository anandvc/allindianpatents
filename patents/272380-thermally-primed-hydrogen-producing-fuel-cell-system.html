THERMALLY PRIMED HYDROGEN-PRODUCING FUEL CELL SYSTEM<br>
Related Application<br>
The present application claims priority to similarly entitled U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 11/229,365, which was filed on September 16, 2005. The<br>
complete disclosure of the above-identified patent application is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for all purposes.<br>
Field of tlie Disclosure<br>
The present disclosure is directed generally to hydrogen-producing fuel cell<br>
systems, and more particulai'ly, to hydrogen-producing fuel processing systems with<br>
thennally primed hydrogen-producing regions.<br>
Background of the Disclosure<br>
As used herein, a fuel processing assembly is a device or combination of devices<br>
that produces hydrogen gas from one or more feed streams that include one or more<br>
feedstocks. Examples of fuel processing assemblies include steam and autothermal<br>
reformers, in which the feed stream contains water and a carbon-containing feedstock,<br>
such as an alcohol or a hydrocarbon. Fuel processors typically operate at elevated<br>
temperatures. In endothermic fuel processing reactions, such as in steam reforming fliel<br>
processing assemblies, the heat required to heat at least the hydrogen-producing region of<br>
the fuel processing assembly to, and maintain the region at, a suitable hydrogen-<br>
producing temperature needs to be provided by a heating assembly, such as a burner,<br>
electrical heater or the lilce. When burners are used to heat the fuel processor, the burners<br>
typically utilize a combustible fuel stream, such as a combustible gas or a combustible<br>
liquid.<br>
In a hydrogen-producing fuel processing assembly that utilizes a steam reformer,<br>
or steam reforming region, hydrogen gas is produced from a feed stream that includes a<br>
carbon-containing feedstock and water. Steam reforming is performed at elevated<br>
temperatures and pressures, and a steam reformer typically includes a heating assembly<br>
that provides heat for the steam reforming reaction. Illustrative but not exclusive uses of<br>
the heat include maintaining the reforming catalyst bed at a selected refonning<br>
temperature, or temperature range, and vaporizing a liquid feed stream prior to its use to<br>
produce hydrogen gas. One type of heating assembly is a burner, in which a combustible<br>
fuel stream is combusted with air. In a hydrogen-producing fuel processing assembly that<br>
utilizes an autotliemial lefonner, or autothermal reforming region, hydrogen gas is<br>
produced from a feed stream that includes a carbon-containing feedstock and water,<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
2<br>
which is reacted in the presence of air. Steam and autothermal reformers utilize<br>
reforming catalysts tliat are adapted to produce hydrogen gas from tlie above-discussed<br>
feed streams when tlie hydrogen-producing region is at a suitable hydrogen-producing<br>
temperature, or within a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature range. The product<br>
hydrogen stream from the hydrogen-producing region may be purified, if needed, and<br>
thereafter used as a fuel stream for a fuel cell slack, which produces an electric current<br>
from the product hydrogen stream and an oxidant, such as air. This electric current, or<br>
power output, from the fuel cell stack may be utilized to satisfy the energy demands of an<br>
energy-consuming device.<br>
A consideration with any hydrogen-producing fuel cell system is the time it takes<br>
to begin generating an electric current from hydrogen gas produced by the fuel cell<br>
system after there is a need to begin doing so. In some applications, it may be acceptable<br>
to have a period of time in which there is a demand, or desire, to have tlie fuel cell system<br>
produce a power output to satisfy an applied load, but in which the system is not able to<br>
produce the power output. In other applications, it is not acceptable to have a period<br>
where the applied load from an energy-consuming device cannot be satisfied by the fuel<br>
cell system even though there is a desire to have this load satisfied by the system. As an<br>
illustrative example, some fuel cell systems are utilized to provide backup, or<br>
supplemental power, to an electrical grid or other primary power source. When the<br>
primary power source is not able to satisfy the applied load thereto, it is often desirable<br>
for the backup fiiel cell system to be able to provide essentially instantaneous power so<br>
that the supply of power to the energy-consuming devices is not interrupted, or not<br>
noticeably interrupted.<br>
Fuel cells typically can begin generating an electric current within a very short<br>
amount of time after hydrogen gas or anotlier suitable fuel and an oxidant, such as air, is<br>
delivered thereto. For example, a fuel cell stack may be adapted to produce an electric<br>
current within less than a second after the flows of hydrogen gas and air are delivered to<br>
the fuel cells in the fijel ceil stack. Inclusive of the time required to initiate the delivery of<br>
these streams from a source containing the hydrogen gas and air, the time required to<br>
produce the electric current should still be relatively short, such as less than a minute.<br>
However, hydrogen-producing fuel cell systems that require the hydrogen gas to first be<br>
produced, and perhaps purified, prior to being utilized to generate the desired power<br>
output take longer to generate this power output. When the fuel processing assembly is<br>
already at a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature, the fuel cell system may be able to<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
3<br>
produce the desired power output from hydrogen gas generated by the fuel processing<br>
assembly witliin a few minutes, or less. However, v/hen the hydrogen-producing fuel<br>
processor of tlie fuel cell system's fuel processbg assembly is not already at a desired<br>
hydrogen-producing temperature, the required time will be much longer. For example,<br>
when started up from an ambient temperature of 25° C, it may take thirty minutes or more<br>
to properly start up the fuel processing assembly and to produce the desired power output<br>
from hydrogen gas produced by the fuel processing assembly.<br>
Conventionally, several dijfferent approaches have been taken to provide<br>
hydrogen-producing fliel cell systems that can satisfy an applied load while the associated<br>
hydrogen-producing &amp;el processing assembly is started up from its off, or unheated and<br>
inactive, operating state, heated to a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature, and<br>
thereafter utilized to produce and optionally purify the required hydrogen gas to produce a<br>
power output to satisfy the applied load. One approach is to include one or more batteries<br>
or other suitable energy storage devices that may be used to satisfy the applied load until<br>
the fuel cell system can produce a sufficient power output to satisfy the applied load.<br>
Typically, this approach also requires that the fuel cell system include suitable chargers to<br>
recharge the batteries during operation of the fuel cell system. This approach is effective,<br>
especially for lower power demands of 1 kW or less, so long as the wei^t and size<br>
requirements of the battery, or batteries, is acceptable. In portable fuel cell systems and<br>
fuel cell systems that are designed to satisfy greater applied loads, such as loads of 10 kW<br>
or more, it may not be practical to utilize batteries to satisfy an applied load for the time<br>
required for the fuel processing assembly to be started up. Another approach is for the<br>
fuel processing assembly to include a hydrogen storage device that is sized and otherwise<br>
configured to store a sufficient amount of hydrogen gas to supply the fuel cell stack while<br>
the fuel processing assembly is started up. Tj^ically, this approach also requires that the<br>
fuel cell system include suitable compressors and other control and regulation structure to<br>
recharge the storage device. This approach is also effective, but requires that tlie space,<br>
additional equipment and expense of including the storage device and associated<br>
components is acceptable.<br>
In some applications, it may be desirable to be able to produce a desired power<br>
output from hydrogen gas produced by the fiiel processing assembly of a hydrogen-<br>
producing fuel cell system without requiring either stored hydrogen or stored power to be<br>
used to satisfy the applied load wliile tlie fuel processing assembly is started up from' an<br>
inactive, or off, operating state and heated to a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature.<br>

and to hydrogen-producing fuel cell systems that include the same. The thermally primed<br>
fuel processing assemblies include at least one hydrogen-producing region, such as may<br>
be adapted to produce hydrogen gas by a steam reforming or autothermal reforming<br>
process utilizing a suitable refonning catalyst. At least the hydrogen-producing region is<br>
housed witliin an internal compartment of a heated containment structure. In some<br>

the internal compartment with the hydrogen-producing region. In some embodiments, the<br>
containment structure is adapted to heat and maintain the internal compartment at or<br>
above a threshold temperature, or within a selected temperature range, which in some<br>

power Dutput and/or not producing a power output to satisfy an applied load to the<br>
system. In some embodiments, the fuel cell sj'stem is adapted to provide backup, or<br>
supplemental, power to a primary power source that is adapted to provide power to at<br>

Detailed Description and Best Mode of the Disclosure<br>
A thermally primed fuel processing assembly is shown in Fig. 1 and is indicated<br>
generally at 10. Thermally primed fuel processing assembly 10 includes a thermally<br>
primed fuel processor 12 that is adapted to produce a product hydrogen stream 14<br>
containing hydrogen gas, and preferably at least substantially pure hydrogen gas, from<br>
one or more feed streams 16. Feed stream 16 includes at least one carbon-containing<br>
feedstock 18, and may include water 17. Fuel processor 12 is any suitable device, or<br>
combination of devices, that is adapted to produce hydrogen gas from feed stream(s) 16.<br>
Accordingly, fuel processor 12 includes a hydrogen-producing region 19, in which a<br>
hydrogen gas is produced using any suitable hydrogen-producing mechanism(s) and/or<br>
process(es). The product hydrogen stream may be delivered to a fuel cell stack 40, which<br>
is adapted to produce an electric current, or power output, 41 from hydrogen gas and an<br>
oxidant, such as air. An air stream is illustrated at 43 in Fig. 1 and may be delivered to<br>
the fuel cells in the stacic via any suitable mechanism"or process. Systems according to<br>
the present disclosure that include at least one fuel cell stack and at least one thermally<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCTAJS2006/033027<br>
6<br>
primed fuel processing assembly that is adapted to produce hydrogen gas for tlie at least<br>
one fuel cell stack may be referred to as thermally primed hydrogen-producing fuel cell<br>
systems. Altliough a single fuel processor 12 and/or a single fuel cell stack 40 are shown<br>
in Fig. 1, it is within the scope of the disclosure that more tlian one of either or botli of<br>
these components, and/or subcomponents thereof, may be used.<br>
Thermally primed fuel processing assembly 10 includes a hydrogen-producing<br>
region 19 that is housed within a heated containment structure, or heated containment<br>
assembly, 70 and which is adapted to produce hydrogen gas from the one or more feed<br>
streams by utilizing any suitable hydrogen-producing mechanism(s). As discussed in<br>
more detail herein, containment structure 70 defines an internal compartment 72 into<br>
which at least the hydrogen-producing region of the fuel processing assembly is located.<br>
The containment structure includes a heating assembly that is adapted to heat and<br>
maintain tlie internal compartment, and structures contained therewithin, to a threshold<br>
temperature, or temperature range. This threshold temperature, or temperature range may<br>
correspond to a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature, or temperature range, for the<br>
fiiel processing assembly to produce hydrogen gas in its hydrogen-producing region. The<br>
containment structure may also be referred to as a heated containment system, and/or a<br>
positively heated thermal reservoir that contains at least the hydrogen-producing region of<br>
the fijel processing assembly.<br>
Feed stream(s) 16 may be delivered to the hydrogen-producing region of<br>
thermally primed fuel processor 12 via any suitable mechanism. While a single feed<br>
stream 16 is shown in solid lines in Fig. 1, it is within the scope of the disclosure that<br>
more than one stream 16 may be used and that these streams may contain the same or<br>
different feedstocks. This is schematically illustrated by the inclusion of a second feed<br>
stream 16 in dashed lines in Fig. 1. When feed stream 16 contains two or more<br>
components, such as a carbon-containing feedstock and water, the components may be<br>
delivered in the same or different feed streams. For example, when the fuel processor is<br>
adapted to produce hydrogen gas from a carbon-containing feedstock and water, these<br>
components are tjpically delivered in separate streams, and optionally (at least until both<br>
streams are vaporized or otherwise gaseous), when they are not miscible with each other,<br>
such as sho%vn in Fig. 1 by reference numerals 17 and 18 pointing to different feed<br>
streams. When the carbon-containing feedstock is miscible with water, the feedstock is<br>
typically, but is iiut required to be, delivered with the water component of feed stream 16,<br>
such as shown in Fig. 1 by reference numerals 17 and 18 pointing to the same feed stream<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
7<br>
16. For example, when the fuel processor receives a feed stream containing water and a<br>
water-soluble alcohol, such as methanol, these components may be premixed and<br>
delivered as a single stream.<br>
In Fig. 1, feed stream 16 is shown being delivered to fuel processor 12 by a<br>
feedstock delivery system 22, which schematically represents any suitable mechanism,<br>
device or combination thereof for selectively delivering the feed stream to the fuel<br>
processor. For example, the delivery system may include one or more pumps that are<br>
adapted to deliver the components of stream 16 fi-om one or more supplies. Additionally,<br>
or alternatively, feedstock delivery system 22 may include a valve assembly adapted to<br>
regulate the flow of the components from a pressurized supply. The supplies may be<br>
located external of tlie fuel processing assembly, or may be contained within or adjacent<br>
the assembly. When feed stream 16 is delivered to the fuel processor in more than one<br>
stream, the streams may be delivered by the same or separate feedstock delivery systems.<br>
Hydrogen-producing region 19 may utilize any suitable process or mechanism to<br>
produce hydrogen gas from feed stream(s) 16. The output stream 20 from the hydrogen-<br>
producing region contains hydrogen gas as a majority component. Output stream 20 may<br>
include one or more additional gaseous components, and thereby may be referred to as a<br>
mixed gas stream that contains hydrogen gas as its majority component. As discussed,<br>
examples of suitable mechanisms for producing hydrogen gas from feed stream(s) 16<br>
include steam reforming and autothermal reforming, in which reforming catalysts are<br>
used to produce hydrogen gas from a feed stream 16 containing a carbon-containing<br>
feedstock 18 and water 17. Examples of suitable carbon-containing feedstocks 18 include<br>
at least one hydrocarbon or alcohol. Examples of suitable hydrocarbons include methane,<br>
propane, natural gas, diesel, kerosene, gasoline and the like. Examples of suitable<br>
alcohols include methanol, ethanol, and polyols. such as ethylene glycol and propylene<br>
glycol.<br>
Steam reforming is one example of a hydrogen-producing mechanism that may be<br>
employed in hydrogen-producing region 19 in which feed sfream 16 comprises water and<br>
a carbon-containing feedstock. In a steam reformmg process, hydrogen-producing<br>
region 19 contains a suitable steam reforming catalyst 23, as indicated in dashed lines in<br>
Fig. 1. In such an embodiment, the fuel processor may be referred to as a steam reformer,<br>
hydrogen-producing region 19 may be referred to as a reforming region, and output, or<br>
- mixed gas, stream 20 may be referred to as a refomiate stieain. As used herein, reforming<br>
region 19 refers to any hydrogen-producing region utilizing a steam reforming hydrogen-<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
S<br>
producing mechanism. Examples of suitable steam reforming catalysts include copper-<br>
zinc formulations of low temperature shift catalysts and a cliromium fonnulation sold<br>
under the trade name KMA by Siid-Chemie, although others may be used. Tlie other<br>
gases that may be present in the refonnate stream include carbon monoxide, carbon<br>
dioxide, methane, steam, and/or unreacted carbon-containing feedstock.<br>
Steam reformers tj'pically operate at temperatures in the range of 200° C and<br>
900° C, and at pressures in the range of 50 psi and 300 psi, although temperatures and<br>
pressures outside of this range are within the scope of the disclosure. When the carbon-<br>
containing feedstock is methanol, the hydrogen-producing steam reforming reaction will<br>
typically operate in a temperature range of approximately 200-500° C. Illustrative subsets<br>
of this range include 350-450° C, 375-425° C, and 375-400° C. When the carbon-<br>
containing feedstock is a hydrocarbon, ethanol, or a similar alcohol, a temperature range<br>
of approximately 400-900° C will typically be used for the steam reforming reaction.<br>
Illustrative subsets of this range include 750-850° C, 725-825° C, 650-750° C,<br>
700-800° C, 700-900° C, 500-800° C, 400-600° C, and 600-800° C. It is within the scope<br>
of the present disclosure for the hydrogen-producing region to include two or more zones,<br>
or portions, each of which may be operated at the same or at different temperatures. For<br>
example, when the hydrogen-production fluid includes a hydrocarbon, in some<br>
embodiments it may be desirable to include two different hydrogen-producing portions,<br>
with one operating at a lower temperature than the other to provide a pre-reforming<br>
region. In such an embodiment, the fuel processing system may alternatively be<br>
described as including two or more hydrogen-producing regions. Feed stream 16 is<br>
typically delivered to reforming region 19 of fuel processor 12 at a selected pressure, such<br>
as a pressure within the illustrative pressure range presented above. Thermally primed<br>
fuel processing assemblies according to the present disclosure may therefore be adapted<br>
to maintain at least the hydrogen-producing region of the fuel processor at or above a<br>
threshold hydrogen-producing temperature tliat corresponds to one of the above-presented<br>
illustrative temperatures, and/or within a selected threshold temperature range that<br>
corresponds to one of the above-presented illustrative temperature ranges.<br>
Another suitable process for producing hydrogen gas in the hydrogen-producing<br>
region 19 of thermally primed fuel processor 12 is autothermal reforming, in which a<br>
suitable autothermal reforming catalyst is used to produce hydrogen gas from water and a<br>
carbon-containing feedstock in the presence of air. When autothermal reforming is used,<br>
the thermally primed fuel processor flirther includes an air delivery assembly 68 that is<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCTAJS2006/033027<br>
9<br>
adapted to deliver an air stream to the hydrogen-producing region, as indicated in dashed<br>
lines in Fig. 1. Thermally primed fliel processing assemblies may be adapted to maintain<br>
hydrogen-producing regions that utilize an autothermal reforming reaction at one of the<br>
above-presented illustrative temperatures, or temperature ranges, discussed with respect<br>
to hydrogen-producing steam reforming reactions. Autotliermal hydrogen-producing<br>
reactions utilize a primary endothermic reaction that is utilized in conjunction with an<br>
exothermic partial oxidation reaction tlmt generates heat within the hydrogen-producing<br>
region upon initiation of the initial hydrogen-producing reaction. Accordingly, even<br>
though autothermal hydrogen-producing reactions include an exothermic reaction, a need<br>
still exists to initially heat the hydrogen-producing region to at least a minimum suitable<br>
hydrogen-producing temperature.<br>
The product hydrogen stream 14 produced by the fuel processing assembly may<br>
be delivered to a fuel cell stack 40. A fuel cell stack is a device that produces an<br>
electrical potential from a source of protons, such as hydrogen gas, and an oxidant, such<br>
as oxygen gas. Accordingly, a fuel cell stack may be adapted to receive at least a portion<br>
of product hydrogen stream 14 and a stream of oxygen (which is tj'pically delivered as an<br>
air stream), and to produce an electric current therefrom. This is schematically illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1, in which a fuel cell stack is indicated at 40 and produces an electric current, or<br>
power output, which is schematically illustrated at 41. Fuel cell stack 40 contains at least<br>
one, and typically multiple, fuel cells 44 that are adapted to produce an electric current<br>
fit&gt;m an oxidant, such as air, oxygen-enriched air, or oxygen gas, and the portion of the<br>
product hydrogen stream 14 delivered thereto. The fiiei cells typically are joined together<br>
between common end plates 48, which contain fluid delivery/removal conduits, although<br>
this construction is not required to all embodiments. Examples of suitable fiiel cells<br>
include proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and alkaline fuel cells. Others<br>
include solid oxide fiiel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, and molten carbonate fuel cells.<br>
The electric current, or power output, 41 produced by stack 40 may be used to<br>
satisfy the energy demands, or applied load, of at least one associated energy-consuming<br>
device 46. Illustrative examples of devices 46 include, but should not be limited to, tools,<br>
lights or lighting assemblies, appliances (such as household or other appliances),<br>
households or other dwellings, offices or other commercial establishments, computers,<br>
signaling or communication equipment, etc. Similarly, fuel cell stack 40 may be used to<br>
satisfy^tiie-powei requirements of fuel cell system 42, which may be referred to as the'<br>
balance-of-plant power requu-ements of the fuel cell system. It should be understood that<br>
 <br>

device 46 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 and is meant to represent one or more<br>
devices, or collection of devices, that are adapted to draw electric cun-ent from, or apply a<br>
load to, the fuel cell system.<br>
As discussed, heated containment structure 70 is adapted to heat and maintain at<br>
least the hydrogen-producing region of the thermally primed fuel processor at a suitable<br>
hydrogen-producing temperature, such as at one of tlie illustrative temperatures discussed<br>
above and/or +/- 25° C of these illustrative temperatures. An illustrative example of a<br>
suitable containment structure 70 is schematically illustrated hi Fig. 2. As shown, the<br>
containment structure defines an enclosure 84 containing internal compartment 72, which<br>
is sized to receive, or house, at least the hydrogen-producing region of fuel processor 12.<br>
The enclosure includes walls 86, which preferably include internal surfaces 88 that define<br>
an at least substantially, if not completely, closed boundary around the internal<br>
compartment. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that walls 86 may have the<br>
same or different thicknesses, sizes, shapes, and the like. Similarly, it is not required that<br>
the enclosure have a rectilinear configuration, with Fig. 2 merely intended to provide an<br>
illustrative schematic example.<br>
The walls and/or other portions of enclosure 86 preferably are insulated to reduce<br>
the thermal load, or energy demand, to heat and maintain the internal compartment at the<br>
selected temperature. Although not required, it is within the scope of the present<br>
disclosure that the enclosure, such as walls 86, is/are sufficiently insulated that the<br>
exterior surface 90 thereof is maintained at or below a threshold external temperature<br>
while the internal compartment is maintained at one of the suitable threshold hydrogen-<br>
producing temperatures discussed herein. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable<br>
threshold external temperatures include temperatures of less than 100° C, thresholds of<br>
less than 75° C, less than 50° C, and less than 25° C. As discussed, these external<br>
temperatures are not required, and the exterior of the enclosure may be at temperatures<br>
that exceed these illustrative examples without departing from the scope of the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
It is within the scope of the present disclosure that the enclosure 84 may include<br>
one or more vents or other air-circulation passages. It is also within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure that the only fluid passages between the internal compartment and<br>
exterior of the enclosure is through defined inlet and outlet conduits, or ports, such as to<br>
deliver feed stream(s) to tlie hydrogen-producing region, to withdraw the hydrogen-<br>
containing stream(s) from the enclosure, and/or to deliver air to into the compartment and<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
11<br>
to withdraw exhaust from tlie enclosure. This is somewhat schematically illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2, in which a feed stream port is indicated at 92, a product hydrogen port is indicated<br>
at 94, an air inlet port is indicated at 96, and an exhaust port is indicated at 98. More than<br>
one of the illustrated examples of possible ports may be mcluded in any containment<br>
structure according to the present disclosure. Similarly, the structure may include one or<br>
more ports in addition to, or instead of, one or more of the illustrative ports described<br>
above.<br>
\Vhen the fluid streams that are delivered into or withdrawn from a particular<br>
structure within the internal compartment, such as instead of the internal compartment<br>
generally, the ports may be associated with one or more fluid conduits 100 that define<br>
prescribed flow paths for the fluids within the compartment. For example, feed port 92<br>
includes a fluid conduit that delivers the feed stream to the hydrogen-producing region.<br>
This conduit may define or otherwise form at least a portion of a vaporization region 102,<br>
in which a feed stream that is delivered as a liquid stream is vaporized prior to being<br>
delivered into contact with the reforming catalyst in hydrogen-producing region 19. In<br>
some embodiments, the vaporization region may be contained within the hydrogen-<br>
producing region, with the feed stream being \'aporized prior to being delivered into<br>
contact with the reforming catalyst. In some embodiments, the feed stream may be a<br>
gaseous stream when introduced into the internal compartment and therefore may not<br>
need to be vaporized in a vaporization region within the compartment. Also shown in the<br>
illustrative example shown in Fig. 2 is a conduit 100 through which the hydrogen gas<br>
from the hydrogen-producing region is delivered to hydrogen port 94, which is in fluid<br>
communication with the fuel cell stack..<br>
Fig. 2 also illustrates that heated containment structures 70 according to the<br>
present disclosure also include, or optionally are in thermal communication with, a<br>
heating assembly 110 that is adapted to heat die internal compartment to at least a<br>
threshold temperature, such as a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature, during periods<br>
in which the hydrogen-producing region is not producing hydrogen gas but in which it is<br>
desirable to maintain the hydrogen-producing region in a primed operating state. As<br>
discussed, this primed, or thermally primed, operating state may be an operating state in<br>
which at least the hydrogen-producing region is maintained at, or within, a suitable<br>
hydrogen-producing temperature or range of temperatures. It is within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure that heating assembly 110 may be configured to only heat the internal<br>
compartment (and its contents) when the hydrogen-producing region is not producing<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
12<br>
hydrogen gas. However, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that the<br>
heating assembly may be configured to heat the internal compartment (and its contents)<br>
until the hydrogen-producing region begins producing hydrogen gas and/or until the fuel<br>
cell stack begins producing a sufficient power output to satisfy the applied load to the fuel<br>
cell system. As a further illustrative example, the heating assembly may be configured to<br>
continue heating the internal compartment and its contents for a selected time period after<br>
the above-discussed events occur (or are detected). As still a further example, the heating<br>
assembly may be adapted to continue to provide heat to the internal compartment (and its<br>
contents) regardless of whether the hydrogen-producing region is producing hydrogen gas<br>
and/or the fuel cell stack is producing an electric current, such as if the internal<br>
compartinent, or a selected region thereof, falls below the threshold temperature (or falls<br>
below this temperature by more than a selected temperature range).<br>
As illustrated in the schematic example shown in Fig. 2, the containment structure<br>
includes a heating assembly 110 that is adapted to heat the internal compartment 72 of the<br>
containment structure, and accordingly, to heat the hydrogen-producing region and any<br>
other structure contained in the internal compartment to the selected threshold<br>
temperature. In solid lines in Fig. 2, heating assembly 110 is illustrated being located<br>
within enclosure 84 and external of the internal compartment 72 of the containment<br>
structure. As discussed, this configuration is not required and it is within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure that the heating assembly may be partially or completely positioned<br>
external of enclosure 84 and/or within internal compartment 72, as schematically<br>
represented in dashed lines in Fig. 2.<br>
A suitable structure for heating assembly 110 is an electrically powered<br>
heater 112, such as resistance heater that is powered by a suitable power source, such as a<br>
battery, an electrical grid, a generator, or any other suitable power source adapted to<br>
provide electrical power to the heater. Heater 112 may, but is not required to, generate a<br>
heating fluid stream 116 that is delivered into tlie internal compartment, such as when the<br>
heater receives an air stream 118 that is heated and delivered into the internal<br>
compartment. Heater 112 and/or any other suitable heating assembly 110 may include<br>
one or more heating elements, or heat sources, 114 that may be positioned in any suitable<br>
location relative to the internal compartment of the containment structure. For example,<br>
the heating assembly may include at least one heating element that is within, or which<br>
extends at least partially within, the internal compartment. Additionally or alternatively.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCTAJS2006/033027<br>
13<br>
the heating assembly may include one or more compartments that extend completely, or<br>
at least partially, within one or more walls 86 of tlie containment structure.<br>
As a further illustrative, non-exclusive example, heating assembly 110 may<br>
include a combustion region 120 that generates a heating fluid stream 116 in the form of a<br>
combustion exhaust stream that may be delivered to the intemal compartment to heat the<br>
compartment and structures contained herein. The combustion region may be within the<br>
containment structure, within the internal compartment, or may be external the<br>
containment structure. In at least this latter example, the combustion exhaust stream may<br>
be delivered to the intemal compartment through one or more fluid conduits, such as may<br>
extend through at least one wall of the containment stiicture to deliver the combustion<br>
exhaust stream into the intemal compartment.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates an example of a containment structure 70 that includes, or is in<br>
thermal communication with, a heating assembly 110 that includes an electrically<br>
powered heater 112. As shown, heater 112 is in electrical communication with a power<br>
source 130 that is adapted to provide sufficient power to the heater to enable the heater to<br>
heat the intemal compartment to tlie selected threshold temperature and to thereafter<br>
maintain this temperature and/or a suitable temperature range of the selected threshold<br>
temperature, such as ± 5°C, ± 10° C, or ± 25° C of this temperature. The heating<br>
element(s) 114 of the electrical heater may extend in any suitable position relative to the<br>
intemal compartment. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of which include positions<br>
along or within one or more of the walls 86 of the enclosure and/or within intemal<br>
compartment 72. As illustrated in dashed lines in Fig. 3, the electrical heater may receive<br>
an air stream 118, with the heater heating this stream to produce a heating fluid stream<br>
that is delivered into the intemal compartment to heat at least the hydrogen-producing<br>
region of the thermally primed fuel processing assembly'.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an example of a containment stmcture 70 that includes, or is in<br>
thermal communication witli, a heating assembly 110 that includes a combustion region<br>
120 that is adapted to receive and combust a combustible fuel stream 122 in the presence<br>
of air, such as from an air stream 118, to produce a heating fluid stream 116 in the form<br>
of a combustion exhaust stream. Fuel stream 122 may include any suitable combustible<br>
fuel, with illustrative examples including gaseous and liquid ftiels. Further illustrative<br>
examples include feed stream 16, carbon-containing feedstock 18, hydrogen or other<br>
gases produced by the hydrogen-producing itgiou, pixjpane, natuitil gas, gasoline,<br>
kerosene, diesel, and the like. The combustion region may be adapted to receive and<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
14<br>
combust a particular fuel or type of fuel. The combustion region may include an igniter,<br>
or other suitable ignition source, 124 that is adapted to initiate combustion of the fuel<br>
stream, with it being within the scope of the present disclosure that the igniter is in<br>
electrical communication with a power source 130 that is adapted to selectively actuate<br>
the igniter. In addition to the previously discussed examples of suitable power sources,<br>
the igniter may be adapted to be powered by a flywheel or ultracapacitor.<br>
As discussed above with respect to Fig. 2, heating assemblies may be positioned<br>
external, within, and/or internal of the enclosure that defines the internal compartment of<br>
tlie containment structure. Accordingly, the illustrative examples of electrical heaters and<br>
combustion regions shown in Figs. 3 and 4 may be implemented at least partially, if not<br>
completely, external of the enclosure, within the enclosure, or within the internal<br>
compartment. As also discussed, at least when it is located external of the enclosure, the<br>
heating assembly may include at least one fluid conduit to selectively deliver a heating<br>
fluid stream to the internal compartment or otherwise into thermal communication with<br>
the internal compartment to provide the desired heating of the compartment and its<br>
contents. It is further witliin the scope of the present disclosure that the internal<br>
compartment may include one or more subcompartments, may include one or more heat<br>
deflection structures, thermal baffles or barriers, fans or circulation members, and/or other<br>
temperature-modulating structures that selectively define regions of higher and lower<br>
temperatures within the internal compartment. These optional temperature-modulating<br>
structures are schematically illustrated, individually and in combination, in Fig. 2 at 134.<br>
In Figs. 1-4, thermally primed fuel processing assembly 10 has been described as<br>
including at least a hydrogen-producing region 19 tliat is positioned within the internal<br>
compartment of a heated containment structure 70 according to the present disclosure. In<br>
each of these Figures, reference numeral 136 is also presented in dashed lines to indicate<br>
that other components of the fuel processing assembly may be located within the internal<br>
compartment and therefore heated and maintained at a selected threshold temperature<br>
and/or within a selected temperature range by heating assembly 110. When present in the<br>
internal compartment, these components of the fuel processing assembly should be<br>
configured to withstand the temperature that is' maintained within the compartment by<br>
heating assembly 110. An example of an additional component of the thermally primed<br>
fuel processing that, when present, may be (but is not required to be) housed within<br>
compartment" 72 is a vaporization region, such as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2<br>
at 102. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that vaporization region 102, when<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
15<br>
present, may be otlierwise configured and may, in some embodiments, be located within a<br>
common shell, or housing, with the hydrogen-producing region in the internal<br>
compartment. In Fig. 2, the shell, or housing, tliat contains the hydrogen-producing<br>
region within the internal compartment is indicated at 104,<br>
Another example of a component of fuel processing assembly 10 that may (but is<br>
not required to) be present in internal compartment 72 is a heating assembly 140 that is<br>
adapted to heat at least the hydrogen-producing region when the hydrogen-producing<br>
region is in a hydrogen-producing operating state. An illustrative example of such a<br>
heating assembly is indicated schematically in Fig. 5. Heating assembly 140 may be<br>
referred to as a second, or secondary, or active operating state heating assembly. WHien<br>
present in a particular embodiment of assembly 10, the hydrogen-producing heating<br>
assembly is adapted to combust a fuel stream 142 to generate a combustion stream 144 to<br>
maintain at least the hydrogen-producing region 19 of fiiel processing assembly 10 at a<br>
suitable hydrogen-producing temperature or range of temperatures. In some<br>
embodiments, this secondary heating assembly may be referred to as a burner. In some<br>
embodiments, the secondary heating assembly may be adapted to additionally or<br>
alternatively heat other portions of the fuel processing assembly, such as a membrane<br>
module or other purification region, catalyst region, etc. Heating assembly 140 may<br>
utilize air that is delivered by air stream 118 to support combustion, and may utilize an<br>
igniter or other suitable ignition source, such as discussed previously with respect to<br>
combustion region 120. Fuel stream 142 may include any suitable combustible fuel. As<br>
discussed, illustrative examples include various gaseous fuels, such as various<br>
combustible gaseous streams produced by the fuel processing assembly, gaseous carbon-<br>
containing feedstocks, liquid carbon-containing feedstocks, and combustible fuel streains<br>
containing any of these components. While not required to all embodiments, it is within<br>
the scope of the present disclosure that the fuel stream may include, or even be<br>
completely formed fixim, at least a portion of output stream 20. It is further which the<br>
scope of the present disclosure that this gaseous fuel stream may be supplemented with<br>
additional fuel that is delivered to the heating assembly from external the compartment,<br>
such as via a suitable port.<br>
It is within the scope of the present disclosure that the hydrogen-producing region<br>
may utilize a process that inherently produces sufficiently pure hydrogen gas for use as a<br>
fuel stream for fuel ceU stack 40. WTien the output stream contains sufficiently pure'<br>
hydrogen gas and/or sufficiently low concentrations of one or more non-hydrogen<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
16<br>
components for use as the fuel stream for fiiel cell stack 40, product hydrogen stream 14<br>
may be formed directly from output stream 20. However, in many hydrogen-producing<br>
processes, output stream 20 will be a mixed gas stream that contains hydrogen gas as a<br>
majority component along with other gases. Similarly, in many applications, tlie output<br>
stream 20 may be substantially pure hydrogen gas but still contain concentrations of one<br>
or more non-hydrogen components that are harmful or otherwise undesirable in the<br>
application for which the product hydrogen stream is intended to be used.<br>
For example, when stream 14 is intended for use as a fuel stream for a fiiel cell<br>
stack, such as stack 40, compositions that may damage the fuel cell stack, such as carbon<br>
monoxide and carbon dioxide, may be removed from the hydrogen-rich stream, if<br>
necessary. For many fuel cell stacks, such as proton exchange membrane (PEM) and<br>
alkaline fuel cell stacks, the concentration of carbon monoxide is preferably less than<br>
10 ppm (parts per million). Preferably, the concentration of carbon monoxide is less than<br>
5 ppm, and even more preferably, less than 1 ppm. The concentration of carbon dioxide<br>
may be greater than that of carbon monoxide. For example, concentrations of less than<br>
25% carbon dioxide may be acceptable in some embodiments. Preferably, the<br>
concentration is less tlian 10%, and even more preferably, less than 1%. While not<br>
required, especially preferred concentrations are less than 50 ppm. The acceptable<br>
minimum concentrations presented herein are illustrative examples, and concentrations<br>
other than those presented herein may be used and ai-e within the scope of the present<br>
disclosure. For example, particular users or manufecturers may require minimum or<br>
maximum concentration levels or ranges that are different than those identified herein.<br>
Accordingly, thermally primed fuel processing assembly 10 may (but is not<br>
required to) further include a purification region 24, in which a hydrogen-rich stream 26<br>
is produced fix&gt;m the output, or mixed gas, stream from hydrogen-producing region 19.<br>
Hydrogen-rich stream 26 contains at least one of a greater hydrogen concentration than<br>
output stream 20 and a reduced concentration of one or more of the other gases or<br>
impurities that were present in the output stream. In Fig. 6, the illustrative example of a<br>
thermally primed fiiel processing assembly shown in Fig. 2 is shown including at least<br>
one purification region 24. Purification region 24 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6,<br>
where output, or mixed gas, stream 20 is shown being delivered to an optional<br>
purification region 24. As shown in Fig. 6, ai least a portion of hydrogen-rich stream 26<br>
forms product hydrogen stream 14. Accordingly, hydrogen-rich stream 26 and product<br>
hydrogen stream 14 may be the same stream and have the same compositions and flow<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
17<br>
rates. However, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that some of the<br>
purified hydrogen gas in hydrogen-rich stream 26 may be stored for later use, such as in a<br>
suitable hydrogen storage assembly, and/or consumed by the fuel processing assembly.<br>
Purification region 24 may, but is not required to, produce at least one byproduct<br>
stream 28. When present, byproduct stream 28 may be exhausted, sent to a burner<br>
assembly or other combustion source (such as a hydrogen-producing heating assembly),<br>
used as a heated fluid stream, stored for later use, or otherwise utilized, stored or disposed<br>
of. It is within the scope of the disclosure that bj'product stream 28 may be emitted from<br>
the purification region as a continuous stream responsive to the delivery of output stream<br>
20 to the purification region, or intermittently, such as in a batch process or when the<br>
byproduct portion of the output stream is retained at least tempomrily in the purification<br>
region.<br>
Purification region 24 includes any suitable device, or combination of devices,<br>
that ai-e adapted to reduce the concentration of at least one component of output<br>
stream 20. In most applications, hydrogen-rich stream 26 will have a greater hydrogen<br>
concentration than output, or mixed gas, stream 20. However, it is also within the scope<br>
of the present disclosure that the hydrogen-rich stream will have a reduced concentration<br>
of one or more non-hydrogen components that were present in output stream 20, yet have<br>
the same, or even a reduced overall hydrogen concentration as the output stream. For<br>
example, in some applications where product hydrogen stream 14 may be used, certain<br>
impurities, or non-hydrogen components, are more harmful than others. As a specific<br>
example, in conventional fuel cell systems, carbon monoxide may damage a fiiel cell<br>
stack if it is present in even a few parts per million, while other non-hydrogen<br>
components that may be present in stream 20, such as water, will not damage the stack<br>
even if present in much greater concentrations. Therefore, in such an application, a<br>
suitable purification region may not increase the overall hydrogen concentration, but it<br>
will reduce the concentration of a non-hydrogen component that is harmful, or potentially<br>
harmful, to the desired application for the product hydrogen stream.<br>
Illustrative examples of suitable devices for purification region 24 include one or<br>
more hydrogen-selective membranes 30, chemical carbon monoxide (or other impurity)<br>
removal assemblies 32, and pressure swing adsorption systems 38. It is within the scope<br>
of the disclosure that purification region 24 may include more than one type of<br>
purification device, and that these devices may have tiie same or different structures<br>
and/or operate by the same or different mechanisms.<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
18<br>
Hydrogen-selective membranes 30 are permeable to hydrogen gas, but are at least<br>
substantially, if not completely, impermeable to other components of output stream 20.<br>
Membranes 30 may be formed of any hydrogen-permeable material suitable for use in tlie<br>
operating environment and parameters in which purification region 24 is operated.<br>
Examples of suitable materials for membranes 30 include palladium and palladium alloys,<br>
and especially thin films of such metals and metal alloys. Palladium alloys have proven<br>
particulariy effective, especially palladium with 35 wt% to 45 wt% copper. A palladium-<br>
copper alloy that contains approximately 40 wt% copper has proven particularly effective,<br>
although other relative concentrations and components may be used within the scope of<br>
the disclosure.<br>
Hydrogen-selective membranes are typically formed fi-om a thin foil that is<br>
approximately 0.001 inches thick. It is within tlie scope of the present disclosure,<br>
however, tliat the membranes may be formed from other hydrogen-permeable and/or<br>
hydrogen-selective materials, including metals and metal alloys other than those<br>
discussed above as well as non-metallic materials and compositions, and that the<br>
membranes may have thicknesses tliat are greater or less than discussed above. For<br>
example, the membranes may be made thinner, with cominensurate increase in hydrogen<br>
flux. Examples of suitable mechanisms for reducing the thickness of tlie membranes<br>
include rolling, sputtering and etching. A suitable etching process is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,152,995, the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for all purposes. Examples of various membranes, membrane configurations,<br>
and methods for preparing the same are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,221,117,<br>
6,319,306, and 6,537,352, the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for all purposes.<br>
Chemical carbon monoxide removal assemblies 32 are devices that chemically<br>
react carbon monoxide and/or other undesirable components of stream 20, if present in<br>
output stream 20, to form other compositions that are not as potentially harmful.<br>
Examples of chemical carbon monoxide removal assemblies include water-gas shift<br>
reactors and other devices that convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and<br>
methanation catalyst beds that convert carbon monoxide and hydrogen to methane and<br>
water. It is within the scope of the disclosure that fuel processing assembly 10 may<br>
include more than one type and/or number of chemical removal assemblies 32.<br>
Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a chemical process in which gaseous<br>
impurities are removed from output stream 20 based on the principle that certain gases,<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
19<br>
under the proper conditions of temperature and pressure, will be adsorbed onto an<br>
adsorbent material more strongly than other gases. Typically, it is tlie impurities that are<br>
adsorbed and removed from output stream 20. The success of using PSA for hydrogen<br>
purification is due to the relatively strong adsorption of common impurity gases (such as<br>
CO, CO2, hydrocarbons including CH4, and No) on the adsorbent material. Hydrogen<br>
adsorbs only very wealdy and so hydrogen passes through the adsorbent bed while the<br>
impurities are retained on the adsorbent material. Impurity gases such as NH3, H2S, and<br>
H2O adsorb very strongly on the adsorbent material and are removed from stream 20<br>
along with other impurities. If the adsorbent material is going to be regenerated and these<br>
impurities are present in stream 20, purification region 24 preferably includes a suitable<br>
device that is adapted to remove these impurities prior to deliveiy of stream 20 to the<br>
adsorbent material because it is more difficult to desorb these impurities.<br>
Adsorption of impurity gases occurs at elevated pressure. When the pressure is<br>
reduced, the impurities are desorbed from the adsorbent material, thus regenerating the<br>
adsorbent material. Typically, PSA is a cyclic process and requires at least two beds for<br>
continuous (as opposed to batch) operation. Examples of suitable adsorbent materials<br>
that may be used in adsorbent beds are activated carbon and zeolites, especially 5 A<br>
(5 angstrom) zeolites. The adsorbent material is commonly in the form of pellets and it is<br>
placed in a cylindrical pressure vessel utilizing a conventional packed-bed configuration.<br>
Other suitable adsorbent material compositions, forms, and configurations may be used.<br>
PSA system 38 also provides an example of a device for use in purification<br>
region 24 in which the byproducts, or removed components, are not directly exhausted<br>
from the region as a gas stream concurrently with the purification of the output stream.<br>
Instead, these byproduct components are removed when the adsorbent material is<br>
regenerated or otherwise removed from the purification region.<br>
In the illustrative, non-exclusive embodiment sliown in Fig. 6, purification region<br>
24 is shown in solid lines within internal compartment 72 and as a separate structure from<br>
the housing 104 that contains hydrogen-producing region 19. It is witliin the scope of the<br>
disclosure that housing 104 may additionally or alternatively include a purification region<br>
24 in addition to hydrogen-producing region 19, with the purification region(s) being<br>
adapted to receive the mixed gas, or reformate, stream produced in the hydrogen-<br>
producing region. It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that the fiiel<br>
processing assembly may include a purification region 24 that is external of the<br>

the thennally primed fuel processing assemblies described, illustrated and/or incorporated<br>
herein may be, but are not required to be, implemented with one or more of the<br>
purification regions described, illustrated, and'or incorporated herein.<br>
In the context of a fuel processor, or fuel processmg assembly, that is adapted to<br>
produce a product hydrogen stream that will be used as a feed, or fuel, stream for a fuel<br>
cell stack, the fuel processor preferably is adapted to produce substantially pure hydrogen<br>
gas, and even more preferably, the fuel processor is adapted to produce pure hydrogen<br>
gas. For the purposes of the present disclosure, substantially pure hydrogen gas is greater<br>
than 90% pure, preferably greater than 95% pure, more preferably greater than 99% pure,<br>
and even more preferably greater than 99.5% pure. Suitable fuel processors for producing<br>
streams of at least substantially pure hydrogen gas are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,319,306, 6,221,117, 5,997,594, 5,861,137, pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
09/802,361, which was filed on March 8, 2001 and is entitled 'Tuel Processor and Systems<br>
and Devices Containing the Same," and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/407,500,<br>
which was filed on April 4,2003, is entitled "Steam Reforming Fuel Processor," and which<br>
claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/372,258. The complete<br>
disclosures of the above-identified patents and patent applications are hereby incorporated by<br>

Fig. 7 illustrates another example of a fuel cell system 42 that includes a<br>
thennally primed fuel processing assembly 10 according to the present disclosure. Fig. 7<br>
is intended to illustrate additional components that may, but are not required in all<br>
embodiments, be included in system 42 and/or assembly 10. In other words, it is within<br>
the scope of the present disclosure that thermally primed fliel processing assemblies and<br>
fuel cell systems containing the same may include additional components besides those<br>
described and/or illustrated herein, such as one or more suitable, controllers, flow<br>
regulating devices, heat exchangers, heating/cooling assemblies, fuel/feed supplies,<br>
hydrogen storage devices, energy storage devices, reservoirs, filters, and the like.<br>
Fuel cell stack 40 may receive all of product hydrogen stream 14. Some or all of<br>
stream 14 may additionally, or alternatively, be delivered, via a suitable conduit, for use<br>
in another hydrogen-consuming process, burned for fuel or heat, or stored for later use.<br>
As an illustrative example, a hydrogen storage device 50 is shown in Fig. 7. Device 50 is<br>
adapted to store at least a portion of product hydrogen stream 14. For example, when the<br>
demand for hydrogen gas by stack 40 is less than the hydrogen output of fiiel processor<br>
12, the excess hydrogen gas may be stored in device 50. Illustrative examples of suitable<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCTAJS2006/033027<br>
21<br>
hydrogen storage devices include hydride beds and pressurized tanlcs. Although not<br>
required, a benefit of fuel processing assembly 10 or fuel cell system 42 including a<br>
supply of stored hydrogen gas is that this supply may be used to satisfy the hydrogen<br>
requirements of stack 40, or the other application for which stream 14 is used, in<br>
situations when thennally primed fuel processor 12 is not able to meet these hydrogen<br>
demands. Examples of these situations include when the fuel processor is offline for<br>
maintenance or repair, and when the fuel cell stack or application is demanding a greater<br>
flow rate of hydrogen gas than the maximum available production from the fuel<br>
processor. Additionally or alternatively, the stored hydrogen may also be used as a<br>
combustible fuel stream to heat the fuel processing assembly or fuel cell system. Fuel<br>
processing assemblies that are not directly associated with a fuel cell stack may still<br>
include at least one hydrogen storage device, thereby enabling the product hydrogen<br>
streams from these fuel processing assemblies to also be stored for later use.<br>
Thermally primed fiiel cell system 42 may also include a battery or other suitable<br>
energy storage device 52 that is adapted to store the electric potential, or power output,<br>
produced by stack 40 and to utilize this stored potential to provide a power source (such<br>
as one or more of the previously described power sources 130). For example, device 52<br>
may be adapted to provide power to one or more of an igniter, pump (such as to supply<br>
feed stream 16), blower or other air propulsion device (such as to deliver air stream 118),<br>
sensor, controller, flow-regulating valve, and the like. Device 52 may be a rechargeable<br>
device, and fuel cell system 42 may include a charging assembly that is adapted to<br>
recharge the device. It is also withm the scope of the present disclosure that device 52<br>
may be present in system 42 but may not be adapted to be recharged by system 42.<br>
Similar to the above discussion regarding excess hydi-ogen gas, fuel cell stack 40 may<br>
produce a power output in excess of that necessary to satisfy the load exerted, or applied,<br>
by device 46, including the load required to power fuel cell system 42. In flirther<br>
similarity to the above discussion of excess hydrogen gas, this excess power output may<br>
be used in other applications outside of the fuel cell system and/or stored for later use by<br>
the fuel cell system. For example, the battery or other storage device may provide power<br>
for use by system 42 during periods in which the system is not producing electricity<br>
and/or hydrogen gas.<br>
WTien fuel cell system 42 includes a hydrogen storage device 50, the hydrogen<br>
storage device may be designed, sized, or otherwise adapted to not be able to satisfy the<br>
hydrogen demands of the fuel cell stack duiing a time period that is equal to the time<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/IJS2006/033027<br>
22<br>
period in which it would take the fiiel cell system to start up from an unheated operating<br>
state (i.e., if the system was implemented without a thermally primed fuel processing<br>
assembly). This response time may be referred to as a start up response time, in that it<br>
includes the time required to heat at least the hydrogen-producing region to a suitable<br>
hydrogen-producing temperature. This start up response time is contrasted with tlie time<br>
required to produce hydrogen gas from the thermally primed fuel processing assembly<br>
that has been maintained at a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature, and then to<br>
generate a power output therefrom. This response time may be referred to a thermally<br>
biased response time.<br>
Therefore, while not required, the fuel cell system may include a hydrogen<br>
storage device that has insufficient capacity, even when fully charged, to provide<br>
sufficient amounts of hydrogen gas to provide the hydrogen gas required by the fuel cell<br>
stack to satisfy the applied load thereto during a time period that is equal to the time that<br>
would otherwise be required to start up the fuel cell system from an off, or unheated,<br>
operating state. As further illustrative examples, the maximum capacity of the hydrogen-<br>
storage device may be selected to be less than 75%, less than 50% or even less then 25%<br>
of this potential hydrogen demand. Expressed in slightly different terms, during a time<br>
period that corresponds to the time it would take to start up the fuel cell stack from an<br>
unheated operating state (i.e., if the thennally primed fuel processor assembly was not<br>
present or operational), the fuel cell stack may require a volume of hydrogen gas to<br>
generate a sufficient power output to satisfy the applied load thereto, with this volume<br>
exceeding the capacity of the hydrogen storage device, and optionally exceeding the<br>
capacity of the hydrogen storage device by at least 25%, 50%, 75%, or even 100% of its<br>
capacity.<br>
Similarly, when fuel cell system 42 includes an energy storage device 52, such as<br>
a battery, capacitor or ultracapacitor, flywheel, or the like, this device may have a<br>
maximum charge that is less tlian the power output that would be required to satisfy the<br>
applied load to the fuel cell stack during a time period that corresponds to the time that<br>
would be required to startup the fuel cell system from an unheated, off operating state<br>
(i.e., if the thermally primed fuel processing assembly was not present). It is within the<br>
scope of the present disclosure that this maximum charge may be less than tlie required<br>
power output by at least 25%, 50%, 75%, or more. Expressed in slightly different terms,<br>
during a time period that corresponds to the time it v^'ould take to start up the ftiel cell<br>
stack fixDm an unheated (off and/or unprimed) operating state (i.e., if the thermally primed<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCTAJS2006/033027<br>
23<br>
fuel processing assembly was not present), the energy-consuming device may demand, or<br>
require, a power output tiiat exceeds the maximum (i.e., fully charged) capacity of the<br>
energy-storage device.<br>
This intentional undersizing of devices 50 and/or 52 is not required, especially<br>
since these components are not required to all embodiments. However, the above<br>
discussion demonstrates that it is within the scope of the present disclosure to include a<br>
hydrogen storage device and/or energy storage device while still requiring tlie heated<br>
containment assembly for the system to be properly operational. A related consideration<br>
is the cost and/or space required for these components if they were sized to provide a fuel<br>
cell system that did not include a heated containment structure according to the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
In Fig. 7, optional flow-regulating structures are generally indicated at 54 and<br>
schematically represent any suitable manifolds, valves, controllers, switches and the like<br>
for selectively delivering hydrogen gas and the fuel cell stack's power output to device 50<br>
and battery 52, respectively, and to draw the stored hydrogen and stored power output<br>
therefrom. Also shown in Fig. 7 is an optional, and schematically illustrated, example of<br>
a power management module 56 that is adapted to regulate the power output from the fuel<br>
cell stack, such as to filter or otherwise normalize the power output, to convert the power<br>
output to a higher or lower voltage, to convert the power output from a DC power output<br>
to an AC power output, etc.<br>
Thennally primed fuel processing assemblies, and fuel cell systems incorporating<br>
the same, may also include or be in communication with a controller that is adapted to<br>
selectively control the operation of the assembly/system by sending suitable command<br>
signals and/or to monitor the operation of the assembly/system responsive to input from<br>
various sensors. A controller is indicated in dash-dot lines at 58 in Fig. 7 as being in<br>
communication with energy-storage device 52 (and/or power source 130) to indicate that<br>
the controller may be adapted to be powered thereby. It is also within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure that the controller, when present, is powered by another suitable power<br>
source. The controller may be a computerized, or computer-implemented controller and<br>
in some embodiments may include software and hardware components. The controller<br>
may be a dedicated controller, in that it is primarily adapted to monitor and/or control the<br>
operation of the fuel cell system or fuel processing assembly. It is also witliin the scope<br>
of the present disclosure that the controller, when present, may be adapted to pertbnn<br>
other functions.<br>

In Fig. 8, a thermally primed fuel cell system 42 (i.e., a fuel cell system that<br>
includes a tliermally primed fuel processing assembly 10) according to the present<br>
disclosure is shown being adapted to provide backup power to an energy-consuming<br>
device 46 that is adapted to be powered by a primary power source 200. In other words,<br>
when the primary power source is operational, it satisfies the load applied by energy-<br>
consuming device 46. While primary power source 200 is operational and available to<br>
satisfy the applied load from energy-consuming device 46, the heated containment<br>
structure of thermally primed fuel processing assembly 10 may be operational to maintain<br>
at least the hydrogen-producing region 19 of the fuel processor at a threshold hydrogen-<br>
producing temperature range and/or within a threshold hydrogen-producing temperature<br>
range, such as those described and/or incorporated herein. In such a configuration, fuel<br>
cell system 42 is configured to provide backup, or supplemental, power to the energ}'-<br>
consuming device, such as when the primary power source is not operational or is<br>
otherwise not available or able to satisfy the applied load from the energy-consuming<br>
device. In Fig. 8, only portions of system 42 are shown, and it is within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure that system 42 may include any of the components, subcomponents,<br>
and/or variants described, illustrated and/or incorporated herein.<br>
When configured to provide backup power to an energy-consuming device 46,<br>
system 42 may be configured to detect the operational state of the primary power source<br>
via any suitable mechanism and/or may be adapted to initiate the production of hydrogen<br>
gas (and thereby initiate the generation of power output 41) responsive to detecting an<br>
applied load to the ftiel cell system from the energy-consuming device. When system 42<br>
includes, or is in communication with a controller, the controller may include at least one<br>
sensor that is adapted to detect whether a load is being applied to the thermally primed<br>
hydrogen-producing fuel cell system from the energy-consuming device, and/or whether<br>
the primary power source is providing any (or sufficient) power to the energy-consuming<br>
device. Responsive at least in part to this detection, the controller may initiate the<br>
production of hydrogen gas by sending one or more suitable command signals to the<br>
feedstock delivery system to cause stream(s) 16 to be delivered to the hydrogen-<br>
producing region of the fuel processing assembly. The controller may be adapted to<br>
perform various diagnostics, or system integrity checks responsive to the detection that<br>
system 42 is needed to provide a power output to satisfy an applied load fix&gt;m the energy-<br>
consuming device. As discussed, the controller may be a computerized, or computer-<br>
implemented controller that is adapted to perform various control and/or monitoring<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCTAJS2006/033027<br>
25<br>
functions and/or which may include hardware and software components, may include a<br>
microprocessor, and/or may include a digital or analog circuit. The controller, when<br>
present, may also simply include a sensor or detector that is adapted to send a command<br>
signal to feedstock delivery system 22 responsive to detecting that there is a need for<br>
system 42 to being producing a power output.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 8, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that at least<br>
the heating assembly 110 of, or associated with, the heated containment structure may be<br>
adapted to be powered by the primary power source when the primary power source is<br>
available to satisfy the applied load of the energj'-consuming device. Accordingly, when<br>
the primary power source is operational, it may be configured to supply the applied load<br>
of the energy-consuming device, while also providing power to at least the heating<br>
assembly of the thermally primed fuel processing system of fuel cell system 42. In such a<br>
configuration, the fuel cell system may be maintained in its "primed" operational state, in<br>
which at least the hydrogen-producing region thereof is maintained at a suitable<br>
temperature for producing hydrogen gas therein responsive to the delivery of a suitable<br>
feed stream(s) thereto. However, because the power requirements of the fuel cell system<br>
are satisfied by the primary power source while the primary power source is operational,<br>
the fuel cell system does not need to generate a sufficient, or even any, power output<br>
while in its primed operational state. Similarly, the fiiel processing assembly may not be<br>
generating any hydrogen gas while in this operational state, even though it is being<br>
maintained at a suitable temperature, or witliin a suitable temperature range, for<br>
generating hydrogen gas.<br>
When, and if, the primary power source fails, is offline, or otherwise is unable to<br>
satisfy the applied load of the energy-consuming device, the thermally primed fuel cell<br>
system is able to generate a power output to satisfy this applied load. Furthermore,<br>
because the fuel processing assembly was maintained at a suitable temperature (or<br>
temperature range) for generating hydrogen gas, the time required to begin generating the<br>
required power output will be considerably less than if tlie fuel processing assembly was<br>
instead maintained at an unheated, or off, operational state. For example, the thermally<br>
primed fuel cell system may be able to satisfy the applied load in less then a few minutes,<br>
such as less then three minutes, less than two minutes, less then one minute, or even less<br>
than fortj'-five seconds, inclusive of any diagnostics or other self-checks performed by a<br>
controller of the system. Expressed in sliglitly different terms, thermally biased<br>
hydrogen-producing fuel cell systems may have a thermally biased response time to begin<br>
 <br>
WO 2007/037856	PCT/US2006/033027<br>
26<br>
generating a power output from hydrogen gas produced in the system, with this response<br>
time being less than a few minutes, less than two minutes, less than one minute, less than<br>
forty-five seconds, etc. This response time will be much shorter than a comparative start<br>
up response time if the hydrogen-producing fael cell system was not a thennally biased<br>
hydrogen-producing fuel cell system.<br>
As discussed above, thermally primed fuel cell systems according to the present<br>
disclosure may include a hydrogen-storage device and/or an energy-storage device that is<br>
undersized for a fuel cell system tliat does not include a thermally primed fuel processing<br>
assembly, such as an assembly that includes a heated containment structure according to<br>
the present disclosure. However, the hydrogen storage device and/or energy-storage<br>
device may be sized to provide the required hydrogen gas and/or power output during the<br>
much shorter time period that elapses for the thermally primed fuel cell system to begin<br>
generating a sufficient power output to satisfy the applied load of energy-consuming<br>
device 46. For example, this may enable the fuel cell system to provide an<br>
uninterruptible backup power supply (UPS) for the energy-consuming device.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Thermally primed fuel processing assemblies and hydrogen-producing fuel cell<br>
systems containing the same are applicable to the fuel processing, fuel cell and other<br>
industries in which hydrogen gas is produced, and in the case of fuel cell systems,<br>
consumed by a fuel cell stack to produce an electric current.<br>
