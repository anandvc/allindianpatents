PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF THIAZOLIDINEDIONE DERIVATIVES AND INTERMEDIATES<br>
The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the preparation of thiazolidinedione derivatives, especially with the preparation of 5-{4-[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-benzo[b]thiophen-7-ylmethyl}2,4-thiazolidinedioneandits salts. 5-{4-[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-bertzo[b]thiophen-7-ylmethyl} 2,4-thiazolidinedione and its salts are pharmaceutically active compounds. These compounds are known in the art and are described for example in International Patent Application WO 94/27995.

However, these methods include a large number of individual reaction steps. Further, the methods known in the art exhibit a low yield, which makes them unsuitable for the commerciallarge scale production of 5-{4- [2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-benzo[b]thiophen-7-ylmethyl}2,4-thiazoIidinedione.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that using the process according to the present invention 5-|4-[2-(5-Methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-benzo[b]thiophen-7-ylmethyl}2,4-thiazoh'dinedione can be prepared with less process steps under moderate conditions with an outstanding yield.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Methyl (£)-3-methoxy-2-pentenoate<br>
A 250-ml 2-necked round-bottomed flask was equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer and an argon inlet. To a mixture of 30.00 g of methyl 3-oxovalerate (0.225 mol) and 125 ml of methyl orthoformate (121.1 g, 1.12 mol) was added under stirring 7.5 g of amberlist 15. The reaction was slightly exothermal at beginning and the temperature reached 31°C. A check with Drager test tube indicated the development of carbon monoxide. The suspension was stirred at rt for 3 h and then filtered into a 500-ml 4-necked pear-shaped flask equipped with an oil bath, a thermometer, an argon inlet, a 20-cm Vigreux column with a distillation head, a vacuum pump with vacuum controller and a cold trap. The volatile components of the reaction mixture were removed by distillation at a still temperature between 37 and 48°C and a pressure between 250 and 40 mbar. The head temperature reached max 30°C. The residue, 31.3 g Methyl (£J-3-methoxy-2-pentenoate as a yellow oil was used without purification in the next step (theor. amount 32.5 g calculated as enol ether).<br><br>
Example 2 Methyl rac-(£)-4-bromo-3-metlioxy-pent-2-enoate<br>
A 500-m] 4-necked pear-shaped flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a cooler, an argon inlet and an oil bath was charged under argon with 31.2 g of crude methyl (E)-3-methoxy-2-pentenoate (ca. 0.217 mol), 10.45 g of N-bromo succinimide (5S.7 mmol), 0.47 g of 2,2,-azobis(2-methylpropionitriIe) (2.86 mmol) and 100 ml of carbon tetrachloride. The resulting yellow suspension was heated for 10 min with an 80°C oil bath to give an almost colorless suspension. Then three additional portions consisting each of 10.45 g of NBS, 0.47 g of AIBN and 35 ml of carbon tetrachloride, in total 31.35 gofiSI-bromo succinimide (0.176 mol), 1.41 gof 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (8.59 mmol) and 105 ml of carbon tetrachloride were added in 5 min time intervals at the same temperature. 20 min after the last addition of reagents (total reaction time was 45 min) the oil bath was removed and the reaction mixture cooled under stirring with an ice bath for ca. 30 min. The suspension was filtered with suction and the filter cake washed with a total of 90 ml of carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate was rotary evaporated to dryness (50°C, 10 mbar) to give 49.7 g of crude methyl r<ic- amount g as an orange oil. this material was used without purification in the next step.></ic-><br>
Example 3 Methyl 2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl) acetate<br>
A 200-ml 4-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a<br>
distillation head, a vacuum controller, an argon inlet and an oil bath was charged with<br>
24.7 g of crude methyl rac-{E)-4-bromo-3-methoxy-pent-2-enoate (ca. 0.107 mol), 19.91 g<br>
of benzamide (0.161 mol) and 57 ml of toluene. The orange suspension was stirred and<br>
heated with an oil bath at 120°C. At a still temperature of 111CC low boiling componentes<br>
started to distill. The head temperature reached 103°C after ca. 1 h and was 65°C after 6 h.<br>
After 9 h the oil bath was removed and the reaction mixture stirred over night at rt.<br>
Thereafter the toluene was removed at 60°C bath temperature and a pressure between 300<br>
and 70 mbar. After cooling to rt, SO ml of methanol and 0.60 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid<br>
monohydrate were added and the brown solution stirred at reflux (ca. 73°C) for 2 h.<br>
Subsequently 2.5 g of charcoal and 50 ml of methanol were added, the mixture was stirred<br>
for 30 min, filtered with suction through Dicalite Speedex and rotary evaporated to<br>
dryness (50°C, 8 mbar, 30 min). The orange semi-solid residue was treated under argon<br>
with 250	ml of toluene and 55 ml of sat. aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The<br>
resulting suspension was stirred in an ice bath for 0.5 h, the precipitated benzamide was filtered off with suction and the filter cake was washed three times with 50 ml portions, a total of 150 ml of ice cold toluene and with little water. The combined aqueous phases {pH = 8)were extracted in a separatory funnel with SO ml of toluene. Thereafter the combined organic phases were washed twice with 50 ml, a total of 100 ml of deionized water, dried (Na2S04) and rotary evaporated (50°C, 10 mbar, 1 h) to give 21.8 g of crude Methyl 2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl)acetate (theor. amount 24.7 g) as a red-brown oil, which can be used without purification in subsequent steps.<br><br>
