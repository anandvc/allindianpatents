FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method, system and device for fractional energy consumption measurement with high precision and accuracy with reducing the least count of conventional energy meter having a blinking light emitting diode (LED) at rated impulses per kw-hr in variable duty cycle applications, such as, for precise measurement of power consumption of a fractional horse power (TEFC) motor with variable duty cycle connected to various types of electric equipments<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solid-state electrical energy meters or electromechanical energy meters, also referred to as 'watt-hour meter', are used on a wide spread basis in commercial and industrial applications. With the conventional system , it is difficult task to measure the fractional power consumed by a.c, high torque, electric (TEFC) motor connected to the system through power belt, for example, in sewing machine wherein the high speed motor consumes the power whenever the sewing machine is switched on for the particular period. The consumption during a period of eight hours fall in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 kw-hr. The least count of existing energy meters is in the order of 0.1 kw-hr. If the measurement is desired for 30 minutes then the total power consumption would be in the range of 0.03 to 0.05 kw-hr. This poses a serious difficulty in the measurement of such a low amount of energy consumed.<br>
There is a further long felt need for providing a device with extremely small least count which would display even the fractional amount of energy that is being used by fractional HP high torque, electric drive during a small portion of time. There is also a long felt need for having a device and method which would solve consumer concern for saving /monitoring electric power consumption by obtaining the continuous display of actual electric power being consumed by the electric product/unit running at the instance.<br>
The present invention intends to remedy the drawbacks of the presently available conventional system by providing method, system and device for measurement and continuous display of fractional amounts of electrical energy with high precision and accuracy in domestic as well as industrial environment<br><br><br>
THE OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to solve this problem encountered in the measurement and continuous display of fractional amount of electrical energy by providing the method , system and device for such measurements with high precision and accuracy along with having the proper display system for the same.<br>
The another object of the invention is to provide the method and device for reducing the least count of conventional energy meter having a blinking light emitting diode (LED) at rated impulses per kw-hr in variable duty cycle applications so as to enable measuring accurately even the very small amounts of electric energy being consumed at the particular instance/ interval or over a range of time and display the same continuously.<br>
The yet another object of the present invention is to provide the method and system , wherein the power consumption of the circuit is not contributing to the actual power measurement for true and exact power consumption of an electric drive<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the novel method and system for measuring fractional electrical energy consumption of a load and a device for the same. A presently preferred embodiment of an invention comprises of an electro mechanical single phase AC electrical watt-hour meter affixed to a power inlet of a A.C. mains, an optocoupler being connected in parallel to a blinking light emitting diode (LED) for optically coupling pulses with the help of electronic circuit for the purpose of counting and further digital display through wave shaping network, counter and digital display for displaying the number of impulses for determining the amount of fractional energy consumed , D.C. supply backup with resetting and on/off switch. This becomes very handy and low cost measuring device for error free energy measurement.<br>
The invention further provides the new and easy-to-operate display device , the said device displaying the minute amount of energy that is being used in fractional H.P. by high torque, electric drive during a small portion of time, with extremely small least count with a fraction of energy equal to the reciprocal of number of<br><br>
impulses per kw-hr rated by the existing energy meter, where the power consumption of the circuit is not contributing to the actual power measurement for true and exact power consumption of an electric drive.<br>
A presently preferred embodiment of an electrical energy meter consists solely of electronic component which measures the power taken by an electrical load connecting to an alternating source of electricity supply in such a manner that the power sensed or energy accumulated is in agreement with the same measurements as performed by a conventional electrical energy meter at the accuracy of the order of existing single phase energy meter used.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawing. Figure 1 illustrates a circuit diagram (block diagram) of a device comprising electric energy meter along with main features of the system provided in the present invention. For the purpose of illustrating invention, the drawing shows an embodiment that is presently preferred.

DETAILED DESCRD7TION OF INVENTION<br>
The various energy meters with blinking LED available in India produce (are producing ) (the) impulses of the order of 2400, 3200 or 6400 for each kw - hr which can be used in the present invention wherein these pulses are coupled to wave shaping circuit by optical coupler for electrical isolation. The least count of the said setup reduces to 1/N kw-hr , where 'N' is the number of pulses produced per kw-hr from a selected energy meter. Thus, if the selected energy meter produces 3200 pulses per kw-hr, the least count will be ultimately converted to 1/3200 i.e. to 0.000312 kw-hr, resulting into precise measurement of power consumption to this extent in a fractional HP motor. The present invention thus provides precise measurement of consumed electric power of the electric drives.<br>
The present invention further provides a digital re-settable counter (11,8). The circuit (figure 1) is powered by using DC backup.<br>
An optocoupler is a combination of LED and a photodiode. LED emits light by passing a current through it. The emitted light can be quickly turned on and off by altering the voltage drop across a LED. A photodiode is used as an light receiver. When light is received/sensed, the current starts to flow through it. The voltage drop across the photodiode will dropped, if the light is present, that is, light is translated into a proportional digital signal.<br>
In Figure 1, the existing electric meter with blinking, 'light emitting diode' (LED) (2), which is connected by input terminal (1) to A.C. mains and output terminal of (2) is connected to a load (3) for measurement of fractional energy consumed by the load (3). The optocoupler (4) is connected in parallel across the blinking, 'light emitting diode' (LED) of the energy meter (2). The LED is blinking at the rate of 'N' impulses per kw-hr. These pulses/impulses are optically coupled by the optocoupler (4) to the additional unit (5 to 12), providing an electrical isolation between the additional unit and energy meter (2).<br>
The pulses are smoothened out by virtue of the filter and wave shaping network (as shown in fig 1 comprising 5, 6, and 7). The distortion free pulses are coupled to 'N' digit resettable counter (11, 8) for continuously counting the impulses generated by the LED inside the energy meter (2).<br>
The direct readout of accumulated impulses for a set time period is available<br><br><br>
in the form of display from a digital display (9) cascaded to a counter (8).<br>
An additional unit (4 to 12) is powered by independent D.C. batteries (10) through an operating switch (12) for retaining the accuracy and high precision and true measurement of actual consumption of load (3).<br>
The present invention gives additional advantage due to DC backup, which retains the digital display even in case of power failure.<br>
The important feature of the invention is that the power consumption of circuit is not contributing to the actual power measurement for true and exact power consumption of electric drive, maintaining the accuracy of the existing single phase energy meter.<br>
It is important aspect of the present invention that working of the invention does not need changing the existing setup of electrical energy meters which, in any case, would not be feasible and affordable for our country.<br>
The present invention holds very good for measuring power consumption of any electrical equipment of any type of load , i.e., reactive or inductive in domestic as well as industrial environment at considerably lower cost with high accuracy and precision . It is highly suitable for the purpose of electrical energy measurement and display in the fields of research, industrial experimentation, optimization and planning of energy consumption in industrial operations, specific fractional energy applications/calibrations in various industrial purposes, monitoring electrical consumptions etc.<br>
The invention described herein and illustrated with the help of drawing, however, is not limited to the description by way of examples and drawing, but covers all the embodiments, variants permissible under the scope of invention also. Thus, the invention provides a method, device and system for measuring fractional electrical energy consumption of a load comprising an energy meter (2) affixed to a power inlet of a A.C. mains and output terminal to load (3), characterized by optocoupler (4) being connected in parallel to a blinking light emitting diode (LED) for coupling impulses to additional unit (4-12) through wave shaping network (5, 6, 7), a reset switch (11), a counter (8) along with a digital display (9) for displaying the number of impulses for determining the amount of fractional energy consumed.<br><br><br>
