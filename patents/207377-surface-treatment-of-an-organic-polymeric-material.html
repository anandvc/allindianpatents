SURFACE TREATMENT OF AN ORGANIC POLYMERIC MATERIAL<br>
    The present  invention  relates  to a  method  of forming a coating comprising silicon oxides on a substrate surface by incorporating organosilicon-containing additives in the substrate and plasma treating the substrate surface.    The use of plasma treatment techniques to modify substrate surfaces is well known; in general, a substrate is treated by placing it within a reactor vessel and subjecting it to a plasma discharge.  The effect on the surface depends largely upon the gaseous material present within the reactor during the plasma discharge.  For example, plasma treatment may activate species on the substrate surface which augment adhesion  of  the  substrate  with  other  materials,   or deposition of materials onto the substrate surface.  Plasma treatment of siloxane substrates results in formation of silicon  oxides,  hereinafter  defined  as  "SiOx",  on  the surface  of  the  siloxane.    SiOx  coated  substrates  are desirable  because  the  SiOx may,  for  example,  provide  a barrier to permeation of gases, vapours, odours, etc, into the substrate,  and may augment adhesion of the substrate with or to other materials.<br>
 When two materials are blended together they will segregate if their respective surface energies are sufficiently different and according to their miscibility. The material having the lower surface energy will migrate to the surface of the material having the higher surface energy, and non-miscibility of the materials will enhance segregation. Two  classes of materials which have sufficiently different surface energies to result in segregation when blended together are organic polymers and siloxanes. Siloxanes have a surface energy sufficiently-lower than most organic polymers to result in migration of the siloxane to the surface of the organic polymer with<br><br>
WO 01/40359	PCT/GBOO/04603<br>
2<br>
which it is blended. Thus, a method of forming an SiOx layer on an organic polymeric substrate is to blend the substrate with a siloxane, allow the siloxane to migrate to the substrate surface, and then plasma treat the substrate surface. The incorporation of polysiloxanes into organic polymers is described in, for example, GB patent number 1257304.<br>
 In Polym. Mater. Sci. Eng. 1988, 59 (934-940), Arnold et al disclose polyimide-polydimethylsiloxane copolymers suitable for use in space flight applications. Where the copolymers are exposed to aggressive oxygen environments, such as low earth orbit atmospheres, a ceramic-like silicate protective layer is formed on the surface of the copolymer. US Patent Number 5,693,928 discloses a method of forming a diffusion barrier on an article made from a polymer blend of a high surface energy polymer and an excess of a low surface energy material, for example a silane or siloxane, characterised by the high level of miscibility of the constituents. The article is treated with reactive oxygen (ozone) and UV radiation to form the diffusion barrier. We have found an improved method of plasma treatment of a substrate surface wherein the substrate contains organosilicon-containing additives to form a coating on the surface which comprises SiOx groups. Such SiOx containing coatings can provide enhanced barrier, antioxidant and adhesive properties to the substrate surface.<br>
 According to the present invention there is provided a method of forming a coating on a substrate surface which coating comprises SiOx groups by plasma treatment of the surface, wherein the substrate comprises a blend of an organic polymeric material and a organosilicon-<br><br>
WO 01 /40359	PCT/GB00/04603<br>
3<br>
containing additive which is substantially non-miscible with the organic polymeric material.<br>
[0007]    Herein "substantially non-miscible" means that the organosilicon-containing additive and the organic material have sufficiently different interaction parameters so as to be  non-miscible  in  equilibrium  conditions.    This  will typically,  but  not  exclusively,  be  the  case  when  the Solubility   Parameters   of   the   organosilicon-containing additive and the organic material differ by more than 0.5 MPa1/2.     For  example, . in  the  case  of  a  homopolymer organosilicon-containing additive in an organic polymeric material this can result in micro phase separation fl-20^un), and in the  case of a  copolymer organosilicon-containing additive in an organic polymeric material this can result in nano phase separation (10-50nm).<br>
[0008]    The substrates used in the method of the present invention comprise a blend of an organic polymeric material and   an   organosilicon-containing   additive   which   is substantially  non-miscible  with  the  organic  polymeric material.        Suitable    organic    materials    include polycarbonates,  polyurethanes,  polyolefins  (for  example polypropylenes   and   polyethylenes), "  polyvinylchloride, polyesters   (for   example   polyalkylene   terephthalates), polymethacrylates  (for  example  polymethylmethacrylate  and polymers    of    hydroxyethylmethacrylate),    polyepoxides, polysulphones, polyphenylenes, polyetherketones, polyimides, polyamides,  polystyrenes,  phenolic,  epoxy  and  melamine-formaldehyde  resins,  and  blends  and  copolymers  thereof. Preferred organic polymeric materials are polyolefins,  in particular polyethylene and polypropylene.-<br>
[0009]    The organosilicon-containing additives for use in the present invention may be, for example, fluids, gums or resins, and include those additives which comprise units of<br><br>
WO 01/40359	PCT/GB00/04603<br>
4<br>
the formulae (SiO4/2),  (RSiO3/2) ,  {R2SiO2/2} and/or (R3SiO1/2) wherein each group R is independently selected from hydrogen atoms, hydroxyl groups, and substituted and unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups.  Preferred hydrocarbon groups are those having from one to eight carbon atoms and include alkyl groups, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl groups and isomers thereof, alkenyl groups, e.g. vinyl, allyl and hexenyl groups, and aryl groups, e.g. phenyl  groups.    Suitable  substituted hydrocarbon  groups include   aminoalkyl,    epoxyalkyl, .   (meth)acryloxyalkyl, isocyanoalkyl,  trifluoroalkyl  (e.g.  trifluoropropyl),  and perfluoroalkyl (e.g. perfluorobutylethyl) groups.  Preferred organosilicon-containing additives include linear siloxanes of  the  formula  R1aR3-aSiO-(R1bR2-bSiO) c-SiR3-aR1a  and  cyclic siloxanes of the formula (R1bR2-bSiO) d wherein R is an alkyl group, preferably methyl, R1 is an alkyl group, preferably methyl, a hydrogen atom, alkenyl group, preferably vinyl, or hydroxyl group ais0to3, b is 0 to 2, cisanOor an integer,  for  example  an  integer  between  10  and  105, preferably between  100 and  10,000,  and d is  3  to 10, preferably A to 6.   Particularly preferred siloxanes are polydimethylsiloxane,)  a,?, co-dihydroxy~polydimethylsiloxane.and a, co-divinylpolydimethylsiloxane.    Suitable  organosilicon- containing resins  for use in the method of the present invention include polysilsesquioxane resins.<br>
[0010] Suitable organosilicon-containing additives tor use in the method" of the present invention also include copolymers of siloxanes and organic polymers. Suitable copolymers include A-B-A, B-A-B, A-B, (A-B)n and A-graft-B copolymers, wherein A is the organic polymer, B is the siloxane, and n is a positive integer. Preferred copolymers include copolymers of polyethylene and polypropylene with polydimethylsiloxane.<br><br>
WO 01/40359	PCT/GBOO/04603<br>
5<br>
[0011] The organosilicon-containing additive must be present in the substrate in an amount sufficient to form a SiOx coating on the substrate surface following plasma treatment. An amount of organosilicon-containing additive of less than 50% by weight of the substrate is sufficient, for example 25% by weight or less, preferably 10% by weight or less, for example from 2.5 . to 5% by weight. N.B. where the additive comprises organosilicon-containing and non-organosilicon-containing components, for example as in the case of a copolymer of organic polymer and siloxane, the stated percentages are for the organosilicon-containing component alone.<br>
[0012] The specific organic polymeric material and organosilicon-containing additives to be employed for a particular substrate will depend on the use to which the substrate is to be put. For example, we have found that plasma treated substrates in which the organosilicon-containing additive is a high molecular weight siloxane gum tend to have useful adhesive properties, whereas plasma treated substrates in which the organosilicon-containing additive is a low molecular weight siloxane fluid or copolymer tend to promote formation of a thicker SiOx coating, which o may enhance surface barrier properties'. In general, substantially all blends of organic polymeric materials and organosilicon-containing additives which are non-miscible therewith are usable in the method of the present invention and result in the formation of SiOx on the substrate surface.<br>
[0013] The substrate for use in the method of the present invention may be prepared by mixing the organosilicon-containing additive with the organic polymeric material. Mixing may be achieved by any means conventional in the art for such procedures. For example, the organic polymeric material may be obtained in the form of pellets which can be<br><br>
WO 01/40359	PCT/GBOO/04603<br>
6<br>
added to a hopper which feeds into apparatus for processing the pellets  and  forming the  substrate,  for example  an extruder.    When  using  an  extruder,  the  organosilicon-containing additive may be sprayed onto the pellets in the hopper, or alternatively may be added to the extruder itself via an entry port.  The pellets are melted in the extruder, wherein the organosilicon-containing additive mixes with the organic polymeric material melt.   It is during the melt process that the organosilicon-containing additive migrates to the surface of the substrate.  The substrate may then be formed downstream, e.g. by film blowing or casting, blow moulding, injection moulding, injection blow moulding, sheet extrusion,   cable  sheathing,   fibre  extrusion,  profile extrusion, formation into pellets or foams, and such other means as are conventional in the art.   The substrate may itself form a coating on a substrate, for example a coating on a metal article.    Pellets of  the organic polymeric material  may  be  pre-prepared,  e.g.  pellets  of  organic polymeric  material   already   containing   organosilicon- containing additive may be prepared for future use.  These pellets may then be used as is conventional in the art for; forming the substrate without the need for the additional step  of  mixing  the  organosilicon-containing  additive therewith..'<br>
[0014]    According to the method of the present invention, once the substrate has been formed the surface thereof is plasma treated.  Many different plasma treatment processes are known, and any oxidative treatment process which can convert  the  organosilicon-containing  additive  on  the substrate surface to SiOx is suitable for use in the method, of the present  invention.   Suitable oxidative treatment processes include, for example, 02, UV, VUV, IR, ozone, and plasma  (including  d.c,  low  frequency,  high  frequency, microwave, ECR, corona, dielectric barrier and atmospheric<br><br>
WO 01/40359	  	PCT/GB00/04603<br>
glow discharge) treatment processes.  The gas for use in the plasma treatment process may be,  for example,  an oxygen-containing gas, e.g. O2 H2O, NO2, and air, or an inert gas; however,  when the  latter  is  used  in plasma  treatment processes etching of the substrate surface may also occur and hence oxygen-containing gasses,  in particular O2 and air,  are  preferred.    Gas  pressure  may be  atmospheric pressure or lower, for example, from 10Nm-2 to lOOONm-2. [0015]    The duration of the plasma treatment will depend upon the particular substrate in question and the desired degree  of  conversion  of  organosilicon  compound  on  the surface of the substrate to SiOx, and this will typically be the order of seconds.<br>
[0016] Plasma treatment of the substrate surface may be performed with substrate heating and/or pulsing of the plasma discharge. The substrate may be heated to a temperature up to and below its melting point. Substrate heating and plasma treatment may be cyclic, i.e. the substrate is plasma treated with no heating, followed by-heating with no plasma treatment, etc., or may be simultaneous, i.e. substrate heating and plasma treatment occur together. A particularly preferred plasma treatment process involves pulsing the plasma discharge with constant heating of the substrate. The plasma discharge is pulsed to have a particular "on" time and "off" time. The on-time is typically from 10 to lOOOOµs, preferably 100 to lOOOµs, and the off-time "typically from 1000 to 1OOOO?S, preferably from<br>
1000 to 2000µs.<br>
[0017] Surface plasma treatment of a substrate comprising an organic polymeric material which contains an organosilicon-containing additive as described herein can. improve the surface barrier, antioxidant and/or the adhesive properties of the substrate surface.   For example, plasma<br><br>
WO 01/40359	PCT/GB00/04603<br>
8<br>
surface treatment can facilitate further modification of the substrate surface, for example modification by the introduction of additional functionalities onto the substrate surface by grafting of materials containing such additional functionalities (e.g. chlorosilanes, alkoxysilanes, and titanates), thereonto. Adhesive properties of the substrate surface can also be enhanced, for example by providing enhanced adhesion of coatings and laminates thereto and by providing improved paintability and/or printability. Improved adhesion of the coating to the substrate surface may also impart useful release properties to the substrate, for example to enable the coafed substrate to be used as a release liner, such as fox self-adhesive labels.<br>
[0018] The present invention will now be described in detail by way of example.<br>
