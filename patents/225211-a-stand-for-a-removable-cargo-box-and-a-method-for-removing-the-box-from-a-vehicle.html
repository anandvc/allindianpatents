				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a utility transport tractor that combines with an<br>
agricultural tractor the capability to transport materials and in particular to a<br>
stand for supporting a removable vehicle cargo box and method for removing an<br>
remounting the cargo box.<br>
BACKGROUNG OF INVENTION<br>
Agricultural tractors are designed primarily to supply power to agricultural<br>
implements and to produce a continuous draft force in the direction of travel to<br>
enable soil engaging implements to perform their intended function. Agricultural<br>
tractors must be designed with sufficient downwards force acting on the drive<br>
wheels to produce the desired draft force. Often this results in a vehicle having<br>
drive wheels that are larger than the non-drive wheels to accommodate the large<br>
downwards force on the drive wheels. Agricultural tractors differ from cargo<br>
carrying vehicles such as trucks in that trucks do not need to produce a<br>
continuous draft load. A truck only needs to produce a draft when pulling a load<br>
during period of acceleration and deceleration.<br>
An agricultural tractor, designed primarily to produce a draft load, has limited, if<br>
any ability to carry cargo. A farmer must use a truck or a wagon hitched to a<br>
tractor to haul cargo. Other cargo hauling utility vehicles, such as a John Deere<br>
Gator utility vehicles can also be used. Tracks and utility vehicles,, lower, have<br>
shortcoming when working with agricultural implements. They do not have the<br>
tractive ability of an agricultural tractor and are generally not equipped with a<br>
three-point hitch. In small farm operation where it is not practical to buy several<br>
pieced of equipment, it is beneficial to have a utility transport: tractor that<br>
combines the typical features of an agricultural tractor with the capability to<br>
carry cargo. Past attempts to combine tractors and tracks have forcsed on<br>
adding a three-point hitch to a truck. These products suffer from poor<br>
performance in pulling an implement and often lack visibility typical of a tractor,<br>
especially visibility of the hitch.<br>
The utility transport tractors have been developed that modify an agricultural<br>
tractor to add a cargo box while maintaining the typical features of an<br>
agricultural tractor that provide for the continuous draft force and include a<br>
three-point hitch for pulling an implement. At times, however, an operator will<br>
desire to operate the vehicle without the cargo box. While a cargo box can<br>
removably mounted to the tractor, a convenient means of handling the cargo<br>
box during removal and mounting and for storage of the cargo box after removal<br>
is rill needed.<br>
0BJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a stand for a removable cargo<br>
box and a method for removing a cargo box from the vehicle with which the<br>
recited problems are overcome and the desires are met. In particular it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a device and a method for removable<br>
mounting the cargo box to a vehicle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a cargo box stand to mount the cargo box on and<br>
removing the cargo box-from a vehicle and a method for using the stand.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the stand consists of separate left and right legs that<br>
are left and right mirror images of one another. Each leg includes a support<br>
member having a base to hold the support member in an upright position. A<br>
cargo box attachment member is pivotally mounted to the support member for<br>
rotation about a pivot and is adapted to attach to the cargo box. A vehicle<br>
attachment member is also mounted to the support member and is adapted to<br>
be attached to the vehicle, in this case a vehicle, to hold the leg in place relative<br>
to the vehicle while removing and remounting the cargo box. A latch holds the<br>
cargo box attachment member in a fixed rotational position relative to the<br>
support member.<br>
Removal of the dumping cargo box in its lowered position begins by first<br>
attaching the legs to the respective left and right frame rails of the cargo box by<br>
the cargo box attachment members and subsequently attaching the legs to the<br>
vehicle frame by the vehicle attachment members respectively. The cargo box is<br>
then detached from the vehicle frame at the cargo box pivot point after which<br>
the box is raised to a tilted position by using the lift cylinders normally used for<br>
raising the cargo box. When the vehicle, the legs lock the box attachment<br>
member to the support member with the box in the inclined position. The lift<br>
cylinders are subsequently uncoupled from the cargo box and the vehicle<br>
attachment member is uncoupled from the vehicle. At this point, the cargo box is<br>
supported solely on the legs and the vehicle can be moved forward away from<br>
the cargo box. The cargo box is later remounted to the vehicle by reversing the<br>
above steps.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Fig 1. the utility transport tractor with the stand of the present<br>
invention is used is shown and designated generally at 10. The tractor 10 has a<br>
front hood 12 covering an engine, rear drive wheels 14 on a rear axle 15 and<br>
front wheels 16 on an axle 17, all part of a tractor chassis 19. The front wheels<br>
16 can be driven or non-driven. An operator's station 18 is located forward of the<br>
rear wheels and includes a center operator's seat 20 and left and right passenger<br>
seats 22, 24. A cargo box 26 is located rearward of the operator's station 18 and<br>
generally above the rear axle 15 and rear wheels 14. A three-point hitch 28 (Fig.<br>
2) is mounted behind the rear axle 15 and beneath the cargo box 26. The three-<br>
point hitch 28 includes a pair of lower draft links 30 and an upper link 32 in a<br>
conventional manner for a three-point hitch.<br>
The cargo box 26 has a generally horizontal floor 34, an upright front wall 36,<br>
left and right side wall 38 and a tailgate 40. The cargo box side walls 38 form<br>
wheel wells for the rear wheels 14 with a portion of the cargo box 26 being<br>
disposed above each rear wheel 14. Fenders 43 are attached to the tractor<br>
chassis 19 and are shaped to fit partially within the wheel wells. The cargo box<br>
26 has a pair of rails 108 made of metal. The floor 34 and the bottom portions of<br>
the side-walls are also made of metal. The upper portions of the side walls, the<br>
front wall 36 and the tailgate 40 are molded of plastic. The plastic panels resist<br>
dents and are molded with color to avoid the need to be painted.<br>
The tractor 10 has a pair of frame rails 50 extending lengthwise of the tractor in<br>
the rear portion of the tractor. The frame rails 50 include rear pivot mounting<br>
bosses 52 adjacent to the rear of the frame rails 50. Hydraulic lift cylinders 54<br>
are coupled to the frame rails 50 through mounting brackets 56 and 58. The lift<br>
cylinders 54 extend to raise the cargo box 26 from its horizontal position to an<br>
inclined dump position in a well known manner. The lift cylinders 54 are attached<br>
to mounting bosses 60 fastened to the cargo box rails 108. Likewise, the cargo<br>
box 26 carries pivot mounting bosses 62 with box 26 to the pivot mounting<br>
bosses 52 of the tractor frame. Removable pivot pins 64 are used to attach the<br>
cargo box26 at the pivotal mount. Similar pivot pins (not shown) are used to<br>
attach the lift cylinders 54 to the cargo box 26.<br>
The right hand leg of the bed stand is shown in Fig. 4 and designated generally<br>
as 70. The leg 70 has an support member 72 coupled to a base 74 to hold the<br>
support member 72 in an upright orientation. The support member 72 is of a two<br>
piece construction, having a lower portion 76 and an upper portion 78 coupled<br>
together by a bolt (not shown) extending through aligned apertures 80 and 82.<br>
The two piece construction enables the height of the support member 72 to be<br>
adjusted.<br>
A cargo attachment member 84 is pivotally mounted to the upright support<br>
member 72 about a pivot pin 86 at the upper end of the support member 72. An<br>
upper portion 88 of the box attachment member 84 is shaped as an open "C -<br>
shaped" channel that receives the frame rail 108 of the cargo box 26 as<br>
described below. A pair of pins 90 are inserted vertically through the "C-shaped"<br>
proportion 88 and through the cargo box rails to couple te cargo box attachment<br>
member 84 to the cargo box rails 108.<br>
The leg 70 also includes a vehicle attachment member 92 fastened to the<br>
support member 72 by the pivot pin 86 and extending outward to a distal end<br>
94. The distal end 94 has an aperture 96 through which the vehicle attachment<br>
member 92 is attached to the tractor 10 by a pin or bolt (not shown) extending<br>
through the aperture 96 and through the aperture 98 at the rear of the tractor<br>
frame rails 50. A two piece brace 100 extends from the distal end 94 of the<br>
vehicle attachment member 92 and downward to the upright support member 72<br>
to provide additional stability to the leg 70 when mounting and removing the<br>
cargo box 26 to and from the tractor 10. The brace 100 is also of a two piece<br>
construction to enable the length of the brace 100 to be adjusted. The aperture<br>
102 in the lower piece of the brace are slightly elongated to assist in adjusting<br>
the length of the brace 100.<br>
A spring biased latch pin 110 is carried by the box attachment member 84 and is<br>
biased against a latch plate 112. The latch plate 112 has an slot 114 at one end<br>
thereof. As the cargo box 26 is raised to an inclined dump position, the pin 110<br>
slides across the surface of the latch plate 112 until it reaches the slot 114 and<br>
then extends through the slot 114 in the latch plate 112.<br>
With reference again to Fig. 2, the floor 34 of the cargo box 26 has a fixed front<br>
portion 104 and a rotatable rear portion 106. The rear portion 106 rotates about<br>
a laterally extending pivot axis and can be titled forward and upward as shown in<br>
Fig. 2. Once the rear portion 106 of the cargo box floor 34 has been rotated to<br>
the raised position, the left and right legs 70 are moved into positioned and<br>
coupled to the cargo box 108 by the pins 90. The vehicle attachment members<br>
92 are then coupled to the two frame rails 50 of the tractor to secure the legs 70<br>
to the tractor.<br>
The cargo box pivot pins 64 are moved so that the cargo box is only coupled to<br>
the tractor through the lift cylinders 54. The Cylinders 54 are then extended to<br>
raise the cargo box 26 to the inclined position shown in Figure 5 until the latch<br>
pins 110 reach the slots 114 and extend through the slots 114. The cylinders 54<br>
are then slightly retracted until the pins 110 rest on the ends of the slots 114.<br>
The load acting through the attachments of the lift cylinders 54 is thus relieved,<br>
enabling the cylinder attachment pins to be removed more easily. The cylinders<br>
54 are then uncoupled from the cargo box 26. This results in the cargo box 26<br>
being completely uncoupled from the tractor 10. The vehicle attachment<br>
members 92 are then uncoupled from the tractor frame. Once this is done, the<br>
tractor 10 can be moved forward, away from the cargo box 26 and the stand 70,<br>
leaving the cargo box 26 supported on the stand 70 for later remounting to the<br>
tractor 10. The cargo box 26 is remounted to the tractor 10 by reversing the<br>
above steps.<br>
Storing the cargo box in an inclined position helps to ensure that the cargo box is<br>
free from the cargo before it is stored on the stand and prevents filling the cargo<br>
box with cargo prior to remounting the cargo box on the tractor. This minimizes<br>
the weight carried by the cargo box stand.<br>
Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various<br>
modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as<br>
defined in the accompanying claims.<br>
