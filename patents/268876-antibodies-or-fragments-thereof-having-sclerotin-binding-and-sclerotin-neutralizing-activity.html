BINDING AGENTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to epitopes of sclerostin protein, including<br>
human sclerostin protein, and binding agents (such as antibodies) capable of binding to<br>
sclerostin or fragments thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Two or three distinct phases of changes to bone mass occur over the life of an<br>
individual (see Riggs, West J. Med. 154:63-77 (1991)). The first phase occurs in both men and<br>
women and proceeds to attainment of a peak bone mass. This first phase is achieved through<br>
linear growth of the endochondral growth plates and radial growth due to a rate of periosteal<br>
apposition. The second phase begins around age 30 for trabecular bone (flat bones such as the<br>
vertebrae and pelvis) and about age 40 for cortical bone (e.g., long bones found in the limbs) and<br>
continues to old age. This phase is characterized by slow bone loss and occurs in both men and<br>
women. In women, a third phase of bone loss also occurs, most likely due to postmenopausal<br>
estrogen deficiencies. During this phase alone, women may lose an additional bone mass from<br>
the cortical bone and from the trabecular compartment (see Riggs, supra).<br>
Loss of bone mineral content can be caused by a wide variety of conditions and<br>
may result in significant medical problems. For example, osteoporosis is a debilitating disease<br>
in humans and is characterized by marked decreases in skeletal bone mass and mineral density,<br>
structural deterioration of bone, including degradation of bone microarchitecture and<br>
corresponding increases in bone fragility (i. e., decreases in bone strength), and susceptibility to<br>
fracture in afflicted individuals. Osteoporosis in humans is generally preceded by clinical<br>
osteopenia (bone mineral density that is greater than one standard deviation but less than 2.5<br>
standard deviations below the mean value for young adult bone), a condition found in<br>
approximately 25 million people in the United States. Another 7-8 million patients in the United<br>
States have been diagnosed with clinical osteoporosis (defined as bone mineral content greater<br>
than 2.5 standard deviations below that of mature young adult bone). The frequency of<br>
osteoporosis in the human population increases with age. Among Caucasians, osteoporosis is<br>
predominant in women who, in the United States, comprise 80% of the osteoporosis patient<br>
pool. The increased fragility and susceptibility to fracture of skeletal bone in the aged is<br>
aggravated by the greater risk of accidental falls in this population. Fractured hips, wrists, and<br>
vertebrae are among the most common injuries associated with osteoporosis. Hip fractures in<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
particular are extremely uncomfortable and expensive for the patient, and for women, correlate<br>
with high rates of mortality and morbidity.<br>
Although osteoporosis has been regarded as an increase in the risk of fracture due<br>
to decreased bone mass, few of the presently available treatments for skeletal disorders can<br>
increase the bone density of adults, and most of the presently available treatments work<br>
primarily by inhibiting further bone resorption rather than stimulating new bone formation.<br>
Estrogen is now being prescribed to retard bone loss. However, some controversy exists over<br>
whether patients gain any long-term benefit and whether estrogen has any effect on patients<br>
over 75 years old. Moreover, use of estrogen is believed to increase the risk of breast and<br>
endometrial cancer. Calcitonin, osteocalcin with vitamin K, or high doses of dietary calcium,<br>
with or without vitamin D, have also been suggested for postmenopausal women. High doses of<br>
calcium, however, often have undesired gastrointestinal side effects, and serum and urinary<br>
calcium levels must be continuously monitored (e.g., Khosla and Riggs, Mayo Clin. Proc.<br>
70:978982, 1995).<br>
Other current therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis include bisphosphonates<br>
(e.g., Fosamax™, Actonel™, Bonviva™, Zometa™, olpadronate, neridronate, skelid, bonefos), .-■■<br>
parathyroid hormone, calcilytics, calcimimetics (e.g., cinacalcet). statins, anabolic steroids,<br>
lanthanum and strontium salts, and sodium fluoride. Such therapeutics, however, are often<br>
associated with undesirable side effects {see Khosla and Riggs, supra).<br>
Sclerostin, the product of the SOST gene, is absent in sclerosteosis, a skeletal<br>
disease characterized by bone overgrowth and strong dense bones (Brunkow et al., Am. J. Hum.<br>
Genet., 68:577-589,2001; Balemans et al., Hum. Mol. Genet., 10:537-543,2001). The amino<br>
acid sequence of human sclerostin is reported by Brunkow et al. ibid and is disclosed herein as<br>
SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disclosed herein are compositions and methods that can be used to increase at<br>
least one of bone formation, bone mineral density, bone mineral content, bone mass, bone<br>
quality and bone strength, and that therefore may be used to treat a wide variety of conditions in<br>

bone mass, bone quality and bone strength is desirable. The present invention also offers other<br>
related advantages described herein.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to regions of the human sclerostin protein that<br>
contain epitopes recognized by antibodies that also bind to full-length sclerostin, and methods of<br>
making and using these epitopes. The invention also provides binding agents (such as<br>
antibodies) that specifically bind to sclerostin or portions of sclerostin, and methods for using<br>
such binding agents. The binding agents are useful to block or impair binding of human<br>
sclerostin to One or more ligand.<br>
Recombinant human sclerostin/SOST is commercially available from R&amp;D<br>
Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2006 cat# 1406-ST-025). Additionally, recombinant mouse<br>
sclerostin/SOST is commercially available from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2006<br>
cat# 1589-ST-025). Research grade sclerostin binding monoclonal antibodies arc commercially<br>
available from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA; mouse monoclonal: 2006 cat#<br>
MAB1406; rat monoclonal: 2006 cat# MAB1589). U.S. PatentNos. 6,395,511 and 6,803,453,<br>
and U.S. Patent Publications 20040009535 and 20050106683 refer to anti-sclerostin antibodies<br>
generally.<br>
As used herein, the term human scierostin is intended to include the protein of<br>
SEQ ID NO:1 and allelic variants thereof. Sclerostin can be purified from 293T host cells that<br>
have been transfected by a gene encoding sclerostin by elution of filtered supernatant of host cell<br>
culture fluid using a Heparin HP column, using a salt gradient. The preparation and further<br>
purification using cation exchange chromatography are described in Examples 1 and 2.<br>
Binding agents of the invention are preferably antibodies, as defined herein. The<br>
term "antibody" refers to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof, An antibody may<br>
comprise a complete antibody molecule (including polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric,<br>
humanized, or human versions having full length heavy and/or light chains), or comprise an<br>
antigen binding fragment thereof. Antibody fragments include F(ab')2, Fab, Fab', Fv, Fc, and<br>
Fd fragments, and can be incorporated into single domain antibodies, single-chain antibodies,<br>
maxibodies, minibodies, intrabodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv<br>
(See e.g.,, Hollinger and Hudson, 2005, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9,1126-1136). Antibody<br>
polypeptides are also disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,703,199, including fibronectin polypeptide<br>
monobodies. Other antibody polypeptides are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication<br>
2005/0238646, which are single-chain polypeptides.<br>
Antigen binding fragments derived from an antibody can be obtained, for<br>
example, by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody, for example, pepsin or papain digestion of<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
whole antibodies according to conventional methods. By way of example, antibody fragments<br>
can be produced by enzymatic cleavage of antibodies with pepsin to provide a 5S fragment<br>
termed F(ab')2. This fragment can be further cleaved using a thiol reducing agent to produce<br>
3.5S Fab' monovalent fragments. Optionally, the cleavage reaction can be performed using a<br>
blocking group for the sulfhydryl groups that result from cleavage of disulfide linkages. As an<br>
alternative, an enzymatic cleavage using papain produces two monovalent Fab fragments and an<br>
Fc fragment directly. These methods are described, for example, by Goldenberg, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,331,647, Nisonoff et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 89:230,1960; Porter, Biochem.J.<br>
73:119,1959; Edelman et al, in Methods in Enzymology 1:422 (Academic Press 1967); and by<br>
Andrews, S.M. and Titus, J.A. in Current Protocols in Immunology (Coligan J.E., et al., eds),<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (2003). pages 2.8.1-2.8.10 and 2.10A.1-2.10A.5. Other methods<br>
for cleaving antibodies, such as separating heavy chains to form monovalent light-heavy chain<br>
fragments (Fd), further cleaving of fragments, or other enzymatic, chemical, or genetic<br>
techniques may also be used, so long as the fragments bind to the antigen that is recognized by<br>
the intact antibody.<br>
An antibody fragment may also be any synthetic or genetically engineered<br>
protein. For example, antibody fragments inciude isolated fragments consisting of the light<br>
chain variable region, "Fv" fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light<br>
! chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy variable<br>
regions are connected by a peptide linker (scFv proteins).<br>
Another form of an antibody fragment is a peptide comprising one or more<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody. CDRs (also termed "minimal<br>
recognition units", or "hypervariable region") can be obtained by constructing polynucleotides<br>
that encode the CDR of interest. Such polynucleotides are prepared, for example, by using the<br>
polymerase chain reaction to synthesize the variable region using mRNA of antibody-producing<br>
cells as a template (see, for example, Larrick et al, Methods: A Companion to Methods in<br>
Enzymology 2:106, 1991; Courtenay-Luck, "Genetic Manipulation of Monoclonal Antibodies,"<br>
in Monoclonal Antibodies: Production, Engineering and Clinical Application, Ritter et al.<br>
(eds.), page 166 (Cambridge University Press 1995); and Ward et al, "Genetic Manipulation<br>
and Expression of Antibodies," in Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications, Birch<br>
et al, (eds.), page 137 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995)).<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the binding agent comprises at least one CDR as<br>
described herein. The binding agent may comprise at least two, three, four, five or six CDR's as<br>
described herein. The binding agent further may comprise at least one variable region domain of<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
an antibody described herein. The variable region domain may be of any size or amino acid<br>
composition and will generally comprise at least one CDR sequence responsible for binding to<br>
human sclerostin, for example CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3 and/or the light chain CDRs<br>
specifically described herein and which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework<br>
sequences. In general terms, the variable (V) region domain may be any suitable arrangement of<br>
immunoglobulin heavy (VH) and/or light (VL) chain variable domains. Thus, for example, the V<br>
region domain may be monomeric and be a VH or VL domain, which is capable of independently<br>
binding human sclerostin with an affinity at least equal to 1 x 10-7M or less as describedbelow.<br>
Alternatively, the V region domain may be dimeric and contain VH-VH, VH-VL, or VL-VL,<br>
dimers. The V region dimer comprises at least one VH and at least one VL chain that may be<br>
non-covalently associated (hereinafter referred to as VH). If desired, the chains may be<br>
covalently coupled either directly, for example via a disulfide bond between the two variable<br>
domains, or through a linker, for example a peptide linker, to form a single chain Fv (scVH).<br>
The variable region domain may be any naturally occurring variable domain or an<br>
engineered version thereof. By engineered version is meant a variable region domain that has<br>
been created using recombinant DNA engineering techniques. Such engineered versions include<br>
those createdj for exampie, from a specific antibody variable region by insertions, deletions, or<br>
changes in or to the amino acid sequences of the specific antibody. Particular examples include<br>
engineered variable region domains containing at least one CDR and optionally one or more<br>
framework amino acids from a first antibody and the remainder of the variable region domain<br>
from a second antibody.<br>
The variable region domain may be covalently attached at a C-terminal amino<br>
acid to at least one other antibody domain or a fragment thereof. Thus, for example, a VH<br>
domain that is present in the variable region domain may be linked to an immunoglobulin CHI<br>
domain, or a fragment thereof. Similarly a VL domain may be linked to a CK domain or a<br>
fragment thereof. In this way, for example, the antibody may be a Fab fragment wherein the<br>
antigen binding domain contains associated VH and VL domains covalently linked at their<br>
C-termini to a CHI and CK domain, respectively. The CHI domain may be extended with<br>
further amino acids, for example to provide a hinge region or a portion of a hinge region domain<br>
as found in a Fab' fragment, or to provide farther domains, such as antibody CH2 and CH3<br>
domains.<br>
As described herein, binding agents comprise at least one of these CDRs. For<br>
example, one or more CDR may be incorporated into known antibody framework regions (IgGl,<br>
IgG2, etc.), or conjugated to a suitable vehicle to enhance the half-life thereof. Suitable vehicles<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
include, but are not limited to Fc, polyethylene glycol (PEG), albumin, transferrin, and the like.<br>
These and other suitable vehicles are known in the art. Such conjugated CDR peptides may be<br>
in monomeric, dimeric, tetrameric, or other form. In one embodiment, one or more water-<br>
soluble polymer is bonded at one or more specific position, for example at the amino terminus,<br>
of a binding agent.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, a binding agent comprises one or more water<br>
soluble polymer attachments, including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene<br>
glycol, or polypropylene glycol. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835, 4,496,689, 4,301,144,<br>
4,670,417, 4,791,192 and 4,179,337. In certain embodiments, a derivative binding agent<br>
comprises one or more of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other<br>
carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol<br>
homopolymers, a polypropylene oxjde/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols<br>
(e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of such polymers. In certain<br>
embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymer is randomly attached to one or more side<br>
chains. In certain embodiments, PEG can act to improve the therapeutic capacity for a binding<br>
agent, such as an antibody. Certain such methods are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
. 6,133,426, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.<br>
It will be appreciated that a binding agent of the present invention may have at<br>
least one amino acid substitution, providing that the binding agent retains binding specificity.<br>
Therefore, modifications to the binding agent structures are encompassed within the scope of the<br>
invention. These may include amino acid substitutions, which may be conservative or non-<br>
conservative, that do not destroy the sclerostin binding capability of a binding agent.<br>
Conservative amino acid substitutions may encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid<br>
residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis<br>
in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of<br>
amino acid moieties. A conservative amino acid substitution may also involve a substitution of<br>
a native araino acid residue with a normative residue such that there is little or no effect on the<br>
polarity or charge of the ammo acid residue at that position.<br>
Non-conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one<br>
class of amino acids or amino acid mimetics for a member from another class with different<br>
physical properties (e.g. size, polarity, hydrophobicity, charge). Such substituted residues may<br>
be introduced into regions of the human antibody that are homologous with non-human<br>
antibodies, or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule.<br>
Moreover, one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened<br>
using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants could be used to gather<br>
information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular<br>
amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants<br>
with such a change may be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such<br>
routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further<br>
substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.<br>
' A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of the polypeptide as<br>
set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art<br>
may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by<br>
targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can<br>
identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides.<br>
In certain embodiments, even areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure<br>
may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological<br>
activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.<br>
Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies<br>
identifying residues in similar polypeplides thai are important for activity or structure. In view of<br>
such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that<br>
correspond to amino acid residues which are important for activity or structure in similar<br>
proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such<br>
predicted important amino acid residues.<br>
One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino<br>
acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information,<br>
one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with<br>
respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may<br>
choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the<br>
protein, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules.<br>
A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of<br>
secondary structure. See Moult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al,<br>
Biochemistry, 13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al, Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et<br>
al, Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., 47:45-148 (1978); Chou et al, Ann. Rev. Biochem.,<br>
47:251-276 and Chou et al, Biophys. J., 26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer programs are<br>
currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting<br>
secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40%<br>
often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database<br>
(PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential<br>
number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et at., Nucl. Acid. Res.,<br>
27(l):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner et al, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 7(3):369-<br>
376 (1997)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that<br>
once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become<br>
dramatically more accurate.<br>
Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include "threading" (Jones,<br>
D., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., 7(3):377-87 (1997); Sippl et al, Structure, 4(1):15-19 (1996)),<br>
"profile analysis" (Bowie et al, Science, 253:164-170 (1991); Gribskov et al., Meth. Enzym.,<br>

"evolutionary linkage" (See Holm, supra (1999), and Brenner, supra (1997)).<br>
In certain embodiments, variants of binding agents include glycosylation variants<br>
wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the amino<br>
acid sequences of a parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, variants comprise a greater or a<br>
lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. An N-linked glycosylation<br>
site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue<br>
designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid<br>
residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked<br>
carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an<br>
existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked<br>
carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are<br>
naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional<br>
preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are<br>
deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino<br>
acid sequence. Cysteine variants may be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a<br>
biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies.<br>
Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically<br>
have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.<br>
Desired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can<br>
be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. In certain<br>
embodiments, amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of antibodies<br>
to sclerostin, or to increase or decrease the affinity of the antibodies to sclerostin described<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
herein.<br>
According to certain embodiments, preferred amino acid substitutions are those<br>
which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter<br>
binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (4) confer or<br>
modify other physiochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. According to<br>
certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments,<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in<br>
certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming<br>
intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution<br>
typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g.,<br>
a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or<br>
disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of<br>
art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures<br>
and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)):<br>
Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York,<br>
N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et al. Nature 354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
In certain embodiments, binding agents of the invention may be chemically<br>
bonded with polymers, lipids, or other moieties.<br>
The binding agents may comprise at least one of the CDRs described herein<br>
incorporated into a biocompatible framework structure. In one example, the biocompatible<br>
framework structure comprises a polypeptide or portion thereof that is sufficient to form a<br>
conformationally stable structural support, or framework, or scaffold, which is able to display<br>
one or more sequences of amino acids that bind to an antigen (e.g., CDRs, a variable region,<br>
etc.) in a localized surface region. Such structures can be a naturally occurring polypeptide or<br>
polypeptide "fold" (a structural motif), or can have one or more modifications, such as additions,<br>
deletions or substitutions of amino acids, relative to a naturally occurring polypeptide or fold.<br>
These scaffolds can be derived from a polypeptide of any species (or of more than one species),<br>
such as a human, other mammal, other vertebrate, invertebrate, plant, bacteria or virus.<br>
Typically the biocompatible framework structures are based on protein scaffolds<br>
or skeletons other than immunoglobulin domains. For example, those based on fibronectin,<br>
ankyrin, lipocalin, neocarzinostain, cytochrome b, CP1 zinc finger, PST1; coiled coil, LACI-D1,<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
Z domain and tendramisat domains may be used (See e.g., .Nygren and Uhlen, 1997, Current<br>
Opinion in Structural Biology, 7, 463-469).<br>
In preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that the binding agents of the<br>
invention include the humanized antibodies described herein.. Humanized antibodies such as<br>
those described herein can be produced using techniques known to those skilled in the art<br>
(Zhang, W., et al, Molecular Immunology. 42(72):1445-1451,2005; Hwang W. et al, Methods.<br>
36(1):35-A2, 2005; Dall'Acqua WF, et al., Methods 36(J):43-6Q, 2005; and Clark, M.,<br>
Immunology Today. 21(8):391-402, 2000).<br>
Additionally, one skilled in the art will recognize that suitable binding agents<br>
include portions of these antibodies, such as one or more of CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, CDR-<br>
L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 as specifically disclosed herein. At least one of the regions of CDR-<br>
Hl, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 may have at least one ammo acid<br>
substitution, provided that the binding agent retains the binding specificity of the non-substituted<br>
CDR. The non-CDR portion of the binding agent may be a non-protein molecule, wherein the<br>
binding agent cross-blocks the binding of an antibody disclosed herein to sclerostin and/or<br>
. neutralizes sclerostin. The non-CDR portion of the binding agent may be a non-protein<br>
molecule in which the binding agent exhibits a similar binding pattern to human sclerostin<br>
peptides in a "human sclerostin peptide epitope competition binding assay" as that exhibited by<br>
at least one of antibodies Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C, Ab-D, Ab-1, Ab-2, Ab-3, Ab-4, Ab-5, Ab-6, Ab-<br>
7, Ab-8, Ab-9, Ab-10, Ab-11, Ab-125 Ab-13, Ab-14, Ab-15, Ab-16, Ab-17, Ab-18, Ab-19, Ab-<br>
20, Ab-21, Ab-22, Ab-23, and Ab-24, and/or neutralizes sclerostin. The non-CDR portion of the<br>
binding agent may be composed of amino acids, wherein the binding agent is a recombinant<br>
binding protein or a synthetic peptide, and the recombinant binding protein cross-blocks the<br>
binding of an antibody disclosed herein to sclerostin and/or neutralizes sclerostin. The non-<br>
CDR portion of the binding agent may be composed of amino acids, wherein the binding agent<br>
is a recombinant binding protein, and the recombinant binding protein exhibits a similar binding<br>
pattern to human sclerostin peptides in the human sclerostin peptide epitope competition binding<br>
assay (described hereinbelow) as that exhibited by at least one of the antibodies Ab-A, Ab-B,<br>
Ab-C, Ab-D, Ab-1, Ab-2, Ab-3, Ab-4, Ab-5, Ab-6, Ab-7, Ab-8, Ab-9, Ab-10, Ab-11, Ab-12,<br>
Ab-13, Ab-14, Ab-15, Ab-16, Ab-17, Ab-18, Ab-19, Ab-20, Ab-21, Ab-22, Ab-23, and Ab-24,<br>
and/or neutralizes sclerostin.<br>
Where an antibody comprises one or more of CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3,<br>
CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 as described above, it may be obtained by expression from a<br>
host cell containing DNA coding for these sequences. A DNA coding for each CDR sequence<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
may be determined on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the CDR and synthesized together<br>
with any desired antibody variable region framework and constant region DNA sequences using<br>
oligonucleotide synthesis techniques, site-directed mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction<br>
(PCR) techniques as appropriate. DNA coding for variable region frameworks and constant<br>
regions is widely available to those skilled in the art from genetic sequences databases such as<br>
GenBank®. Each of the above-mentioned CDRs will be typically located in a variable region<br>
framework at positions 31-35 (CDR-H1), 50-65 (CDR-H2) and 95-102 (CDR-H3) of the heavy<br>
chain and positions 24-34 (CDR-L1), 50-56 (CDR-L2) and 89-97 (CDR-L3) of the light chain<br>
according to the Kabat numbering system (Kabat et al., 1987 in Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, USA).<br>
Once synthesized, the DNA encoding an antibody of the invention or fragment<br>
thereof may be propagated and expressed according to any of a variety of well-known<br>
procedures for nucleic acid excision, ligation, transformation, and transfection using any number<br>
of known expression vectors. Thus, in certain embodiments expression of an antibody fragment<br>
may be preferred in a prokaryotic host, such as Escherichia coli (see, e.g., Pluckthun et al., 1989<br>
Methods Enzymol. 178:497-515). In certain other embodiments, expression of the antibody or a<br>
fragment thereof may be preferred in a eukaryotic host cell, including yeast (e.g.,<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomycespombe, and Pichiapastoris), animal cells<br>
(including mammalian cells) or plant cells. Examples of suitable animal cells include, but are<br>
not limited to, myeloma (such as a mouse NSO line), COS, .CHO, or hybridoma cells. Examples<br>
of plant cells include tobacco, corn, soybean, and rice cells.<br>
One or more replicable expression vectors containing DNA encoding an antibody<br>
variable and/or constant region may be prepared and used to transform an appropriate cell line,<br>
for example, a non-producing myeloma cell line, such as a mouse NSO line or a bacteria, such<br>
as E. coli, in which production of the antibody will occur. In order to obtain efficient<br>
transcription and translation, the DNA sequence in each vector should include appropriate<br>
regulatory sequences, particularly a promoter and leader sequence operatively linked to the<br>
variable domain sequence. Particular methods for producing antibodies in this way are generally<br>
well-known and routinely used. For example, basic molecular biology procedures are described<br>
by Maniatis et al. {Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory, New York, 1989; see also Maniatis et al, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,<br>
New York, (2001)). DNA sequencing can be performed as described in Sangeref al. (PNAS<br>
74:5463, (1977)) and the Amersham International pic sequencing handbook, and site directed<br>
mutagenesis can be carried out according to methods known in the art (Kramer et al., Nucleic<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
Acids Res. 12:9441, (1984); Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488-92 (1985); Kunkel et al,<br>
Methods in Enzymol. 154:367-82 (1987); the Anglian Biotechnology Ltd handbook).<br>
Additionally, numerous publications describe techniques suitable for the preparation of<br>
antibodies by manipulation of DNA, creation of expression vectors, and transformation and<br>
culture of appropriate cells (Mountain A and Adair, J R in Biotechnology and Genetic<br>
Engineering Reviews (ed. Tombs, M P, 10, Chapter 1, 1992, Intercept, Andover, UK); "Current<br>
Protocols in Molecular Biology", 1999, F.M. Ausubel (ed.), Wiley Interscience, New York).<br>
Where it is desired to improve the affinity of antibodies according to the<br>
invention containing one or more of the above-mentioned CDRs can be obtained by a number of<br>
affinity maturation protocols including maintaining the CDRs (Yang et al, J. Mol. Biol, 254,<br>
392-403, 1995), chain shuffling (Marks et al, Bio/Technology, 10, 779-783, 1992), use of<br>
mutation strains of E. coll (Low et al, J. Mol. Biol, 250, 350-368, 1996), DNA shuffling<br>
(Patten et al, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 8, 724-733, 1997), phage display (Thompson et al, J.<br>
Mol. Biol, 256, 7-88, 1996) and sexual PCR (Crameri, et al, Nature, 391,288-291,1998). All<br>
of these methods of affinity maturation are discussed by Vaughan et al. {Nature Biotechnology,<br>
16,535-539,1998).<br>
Other antibodies according to the invention may be obtained by conventional<br>
immunization and cell fusion procedures as described herein and known in the art. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies of the invention may be generated using a variety of known techniques. In general,<br>
monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific antigens may be obtained by methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art (see, for example, Kohler et al, Nature 256:495, 1975; Coligan et al<br>
(eds.), Current Protocols in Immunology, 1:2.5.12.6.7 (John Wiley &amp; Sons 1991); U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. RE 32,011, 4,902,614, 4,543,439, and 4,411,993; Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A<br>
New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Plenum Press, Kennett, McKearn, and Bechtol (eds.)<br>
(1980); and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press (1988); Picksley et al, "Production of monoclonal antibodies against proteins<br>
expressed in E. coli" in DNA Cloning 2: Expression Systems, 2nd Edition, Glover et al (eds.),<br>
page 93 (Oxford University Press 1995)). Antibody fragments may be derived therefrom using<br>
any suitable standard technique such as proteolytic digestion, or optionally, by proteolytic<br>
digestion (for example, using papain or pepsin) followed by mild reduction of disulfide bonds<br>
and alkylation. Alternatively, such fragments may also be generated by recombinant genetic<br>
engineering techniques as described herein..<br>
Monoclonal antibodies can be obtained by injecting an animal, for example, a rat,<br>
hamster, a rabbit, or preferably a mouse, including for example a transgenic or a knock-out, as<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
known in the art, with an immunogen comprising human sclerostin of SEQ ID NO:1, or a<br>
fragment thereof, according to methods known in the art and described herein. The presence of<br>
specific antibody production may be monitored after the initial injection and/or after a booster<br>
injection by obtaining a serum sample and detecting the presence of an antibody that binds to<br>
human sclerostin or peptide using any one of several immunodetection methods known in the art<br>
and described herein. From animals producing the desired antibodies, lymphoid cells, most<br>
commonly cells from the spleen or lymph node, are removed to obtain B-lymphocytes. The B<br>
lymphocytes are then fused with a drug-sensitized myeloma cell fusion partner, preferably one<br>
that is syngeneic with the immunized animal and that optionally has other desirable properties<br>
(e.g., inability to express endogenous Ig gene products, e.g., P3X63 - Ag 8.653 (ATCC No. CRL<br>
1580); NSO, SP20) to produce hybridomas, which are immortal eukaryotic cell lines. The<br>
lymphoid (e.g., spleen) cells and the myeloma cells may be combined for a few minutes with a<br>
membrane fusion-promoting agent, such as polyethylene glycol or a nonionic detergent, and<br>
then plated at low density on a selective medium that supports the growth of hybridoraa cells but<br>
not unfused myeloma cells. A preferred selection media is HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin,<br>
thymidine). After a sufficient time, usually about one to two weeks, colonies of cells are<br>
observed. Single colonies are isolated, and antibodies produced by the cells may be tested for<br>
binding activity to human sclerostin, using any one of a variety of immunoassays known in the<br>
art and described herein. The hybridomas are cloned (e.g., by limited dilution cloning or by soft<br>
agar plaque isolation) and positive clones that produce an antibody specific to sclerostin are<br>
selected and cultured. The monoclonal antibodies from the hybridoma cultures may be isolated<br>
from the supematants of hybridoma cultures. An alternative method for production of a murine<br>
monoclonal antibody is to inject the hybridoma cells into the peritoneal cavity of a syngeneic<br>
mouse, for example, a mouse that has been treated (e.g., pristane-primed) to promote formation<br>
of ascites fluid containing the monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and<br>
purified by a variety of well-established techniques. Such isolation techniques include affinity<br>
chromatography with Protein-A Sepharose, size-exclusion chromatography, and ion-exchange<br>
chromatography (see, for example, Coligan at pages 2.7.1-2.7.12 and pages 2.9.1-2.9.3; Baines<br>
et al, "Purification of Immunoglobulin G (IgG)," in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 10,<br>
pages 79-104 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1992)). Monoclonal antibodies may be purified by<br>
affinity chromatography using an appropriate ligand selected based on particular properties of<br>
the antibody (e.g., heavy or light chain isotype, binding specificity, etc.). Examples of a suitable<br>
ligand, immobilized on a solid support, include Protein A, Protein G, ananticonstant region<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
(light chain or heavy chain) antibody, an anti-idiotype antibody, and a TGF-beta binding protein,<br>
or fragment or variant thereof.<br>
An antibody of the present invention may also be a human monoclonal antibody.<br>
Human monoclonal antibodies may be generated by any number of techniques with which those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art will be familiar. Such methods include, but are not limited to,<br>
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of human peripheral blood cells (e.g., containing B<br>
lymphocytes), in vitro immunization of human B cells, fusion of spleen cells from immunized<br>
transgenic mice carrying inserted human immunoglobulin genes, isolation from human<br>
immunoglobulin V region phage libraries, or other procedures as known in the art and based on<br>
the disclosure herein. For example, human monoclonal antibodies may be obtained from<br>
transgenic mice that have been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to<br>
antigenic challenge. Methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic mice are<br>
described, for example, by Green et al., Nature Genet. 7:13, 1994; Lonberg et al, Nature<br>
368:856, 1994; Taylor et al., Int. Immun, 6:519, 1994; U.S. Patent No. 5,877,397; Bruggemann<br>
et al, 1997 Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 8:455-58; Jakobovits et al., 1995 Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.<br>
764:525-35. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain locus are introduced<br>
into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of<br>
the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci (see also Bruggemann et al, Curr. Opin.<br>
Biotechnol. 8:455-58 (1997)). For example, human immunoglobulin transgenes may be<br>
mini-gene constructs, or transloci on yeast artificial chromosomes, which undergo B<br>
cell-specific DNA rearrangement and hypermutation in the mouse lymphoid tissue. Human<br>
monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by immunizing the transgenic mice, which may then<br>
produce human antibodies specific for sclerostin. Lymphoid cells of the immunized transgenic<br>
mice can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas according to the methods<br>
described herein. Polyclonal sera containing human antibodies may also be obtained from the<br>
blood of the immunized animals.<br>
Another method for generating human antibodies of the invention includes<br>
immortalizing human peripheral blood cells by EBV transformation. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,464,456. Such an immortalized B cell line (or lymphoblastoid cell line) producing a<br>
monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to sclerostin can be identified by immunodetection<br>
methods as provided herein, for example, an ELISA, and then isolated by standard cloning<br>
techniques. The stability of the lymphoblastoid cell line producing an anti-sclerostin antibody<br>
may be improved by fusing the transformed cell line with a murine myeloma to produce a<br>
mouse-human hybrid cell line according to methods known in the art {see, e.g., Glasky et al.,<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
Hybridama 8:377-89 (1989)). Still another method to generate human monoclonal antibodies is<br>
in vifro immunization, which includes priming human splenic B cells with human sclerostin,<br>
followed by fusion of primed B cells with a heterohybrid fusion partner. See, e.g., Boerner et al,<br>
1991 /. Immunol. 147:86-95.<br>
In certain embodiments, a B cell that is producing an anti-human sclerostin<br>
antibody is selected and the light chain and heavy chain variable regions are cloned from the B<br>
cell according to molecular biology techniques known in the art (WO 92/02551; US patent<br>
5,627,052; Babcook et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 93:7843-48 (1996)) and described herein.<br>
B cells from an immunized animal may be isolated from the spleen, lymph node, or peripheral<br>
blood sample by selecting a cell that is producing an antibody that specifically binds to<br>
sclerostin. B cells may also be isolated from humans, for example, from a peripheral blood<br>
sample. Methods for detecting single B cells that are producing an antibody with the desired<br>
specificity are well known in the art, for example, by plaque formation, fluorescence-activated<br>
cell sorting, in vitro stimulation followed by detection of specific antibody, and the like.<br>
Methods for selection of specific antibody-producing B cells include, for example, preparing a<br>
single cell suspension of B cells in soft agar that contains human sclerostin. Binding of the<br>
specific antibody produced by the B cell to the antigen results in the formation of a complex,<br>
which may be visible as an immunoprecipitate. After the B cells producing the desired antibody<br>
are selected, the specific antibody genes may be cloned by isolating and amplifying DNA or<br>
mRNA according to methods known in the art and described herein.<br>
An additional method for obtaining antibodies of the invention is by phage<br>
display. See, e.g., Winter et al, 1994 Annu. Rev. Immunol 12:433-55; Burton et al, 1994 Adv.<br>
Immunol. 57:191-280. Human or murine immunoglobulin variable region gene combinatorial<br>
libraries may be created in phage vectors that can be screened to select Ig fragments (Fab, Fv,<br>
sFv, or multimers thereof) that bind specifically to TGF-beta binding protein or variant or<br>
fragment thereof. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; Huse et al, 1989 Science 246:1275-81;<br>
Sastry et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5728-32 (1989); Alting-Mees et al, Strategies in<br>
Molecular biology 3:1-9 (1990); Kang et al., 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:4363-66;<br>
Hoogenboom et al., 1992 7. Molec. Biol 227:381-388; Schlebusch et al., 1997 Hybridoma<br>
16:47-52 and references cited therein. For example, a library containing a plurality of<br>
polynucleotide sequences encoding Ig variable region fragments may be inserted into the<br>
genome of a filamentous bacteriophage, such as M13 or a variant thereof, in frame with the<br>
sequence encoding a phage coat protein. A fusion protein may be a fusion of the coat protein<br>
with the light chain variable region domain and/or with the heavy chain variable region domain.<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
According to certain embodiments, immunoglobulin Fab fragments may also be displayed on a<br>
phage particle (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,698,426).<br>
Heavy and light chain immunoglobulin cDNA expression libraries may also be<br>
prepared in lambda phage, for example, using MmmunoZap™(H) and MmmunoZap™(L)<br>
vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, California). Briefly, mRNA is isolated from a B cell population,<br>
and used to create heavy and light chain immunoglobulin cDNA expression libraries in the<br>
XImmunoZap(H) and WmmunoZap(L) vectors. These vectors may be screened individually or<br>
co-expressed to form Fab fragments or antibodies (see Huse et al, supra; see also Sastry et al,<br>
supra). Positive plaques may subsequently be converted to a non-lytic plasmid that allows high<br>
level expression of monoclonal antibody fragments from E. coli.<br>
In one embodiment, in a hybridoma the variable regions of a gene expressing a<br>
monoclonal antibody of interest are amplified using nucleotide primers. These primers maybe<br>
synthesized by one of ordinary skill in the art, or may be purchased from commercially available<br>
sources. (See, e.g., Stratagene (La jolla, California), which sells primers for mouse and human<br>
variable regions including, among others, primers for VHa. VHb, VHC, VHd, CHI, VL and CL<br>
regions.) These primers may be used to amplify heavy or light chain variable regions, which<br>
may then be inserted into vectors such as Irnrnur.oZAP™H or ImmunoZAP™L (Stratagene).<br>
respectively. These vectors may then be introduced into E. coli, yeast, or mammalian-based<br>
systems for expression. Large amounts of a single-chain protein containing a fusion of the VH<br>
and VL domains may be produced using these methods (see Bird et al, Science 242:423-426,<br>
1988).<br>
Once cells producing antibodies according to the invention have been obtained<br>
using any of the above-described immunization and other techniques, the specific antibody<br>
genes may be cloned by isolating and amplifying DNA or mRNA therefrom according to<br>
standard procedures as described herein. The antibodies produced therefrom may be sequenced<br>
and the CDRs identified and the DNA coding for the CDRs may be manipulated as described<br>
previously to generate other antibodies according to the invention.<br>
Preferably the binding agents specifically bind to sclerostin. As with all binding<br>
agents and binding assays, one of skill in this art recognizes that the various moieties to which a<br>
binding agent should not detectably bind in order to be therapeutically effective and suitable<br>
would be exhaustive and impractical to list. Therefore, for a binding agent disclosed herein, the<br>
term "specifically binds" refers to the ability of a binding agent to bind to sclerostin, preferably<br>
human sclerostin, with greater affinity than it binds to an unrelated control protein. Preferably<br>
the control protein is hen egg white lysozyme. Preferably the binding agents bind to sclerostin<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
with an affinity that is at least, 50, 100,250, 500, 1000, or 10,000 times greater than the affinity<br>
for a control protein. A binding agent may have a binding affinity for human sclerostin of less<br>
than or equal to 1 x 10-7M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-8M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-9M, less<br>
than or equal to 1 x 10-10M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-11 M, or less than or equal to 1 x 10-12 M.<br>
Affinity may be determined by an affinity ELISA assay. In certain embodiments,<br>
affinity may be determined by a BIAcore assay. In certain embodiments, affinity may be<br>
determined by a kinetic method. In certain embodiments, affinity may be determined by an<br>

Sclerostin binding agents of the present invention preferably modulate sclerostin<br>
function in the cell-based assay described herein and/or the in vivo assay described herein and/or<br>
bind to one or more of the epitopes described herein and/or cross-block the binding of one of the<br>
antibodies described in this application and/or are cross-blocked from binding sclerostin by one<br>
of the antibodies described in this application. Accordingly such binding agents can be<br>
identified using the assays described herein.<br>
In certain embodiments, binding agents are generated by first identifying<br>
antibodies that bind to one more of the epitopes provided herein and/or neutralize in the cell-<br>
based and/or in vivo assays described herein and/or cross-block the antibodies described in this<br>
application and/or are cross-blocked from binding sclerostin by one of the antibodies described<br>
in this application. The CDR regions from these antibodies are then used to insert into<br>
appropriate biocompatible frameworks to generate sclerostin binding agents. The non-CDR<br>
portion of the binding agent may be composed of amino acids, or may be a non-protein<br>
molecule. The assays described herein allow the characterization of binding agents. Preferably<br>
the binding agents of the present invention are antibodies as defined herein.<br>
It will be understood by one skilled in the art that some proteins, such as<br>
antibodies, may undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications. The type and extent of<br>
these modifications often depends on the host cell line used to express the protein as well as the<br>
culture conditions. Such modifications may include variations in glycosylation, methionine<br>
oxidation, diketopiperizine formation, aspartate isomerization and asparagine deamidation. A<br>
frequent modification is the loss of a carboxy-terminal basic residue (such as lysine or arginine)<br>
due to the action of carboxypeptidases (as described in Harris, RJ. Journal of Chromatography<br>
705:129-134,1995).<br>

Antibodies disclosed herein bind to regions of human sclerostin which are<br>
important for the in vivo activity of the protein. Binding of an antibody to sclerostin can be<br>
correlated with increases in, for example, the bone mineral density achieved by use of the<br>
antibody in vivo such as described in Examples 5 and 9 (mice) and Example 12 (monkey).<br>
Increases in at least one of bone formation, bone mineral content, bone mass, bone quality and<br>
bone strength can also be achieved by use of the antibody in vivo such as described in Examples<br>
5 and 9 (mice) and Example 12 (monkey). Since the binding of an antibody to sclerostin is<br>
primarily determined by its CDR sequences, an antibody for practicing the invention may be<br>
generated with all or some of the disclosed CDR sequences in an appropriate framework,<br>
wherein the antibody retains the ability to bind specifically to.sclerostin, and can be expected to<br>
achieve increases in, for example, bone mineral density. Such antibodies are useful in the<br>
treatment of human or animal conditions that are caused by, associated with, or result in at least<br>
one of low bone formation, low bone mineral density, low bone mineral content, low bone mass,<br>
low bone quality and low bone strength. Methods of constructing and expressing antibodies and<br>

sclerostin of less than or equal to 1 x 10-7M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-8M, less than or equal to<br>
1 x 10-9M, less than or equal to 1 x 10-10M, less than or equal to 1 x 1O-11 M, or less than or equal<br>
to 1x 10-12M.<br>
The affinity of a binding agent such as an antibody or binding partner, as well as<br>
the extent to which a binding agent (such as an antibody) inhibits binding, can be determined by<br>
110<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art using conventional techniques, for example those described by<br>
Scatchard et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad Sci. 51:660-672 (1949)) or by surface plasmon resonance<br>
(SPR; BIAcore, Biosensor, Piscataway, NJ).Eor-sur-face plasmon resonance target moteeules<br>
are immobilized on a solid phase and exposed to ligands in a mobile phase running along a flow<br>
cell. If ligand binding to the immobilized target occurs, the local refractive index changes,<br>
leading to a change in SPR angle, which can be monitored in real time by detecting changes in<br>
the intensity of the reflected light. The rates of change of the SPR signal can be analyzed to<br>
yield apparent rate constants for the association and dissociation phases of the binding reaction.<br>
The ratio of these values gives the apparent equilibrium constant (affinity) (see, e.g., Wolff et<br>
al., Cancer Res. 53:2560-65 (1993)).<br>
An antibody according to the present invention may belong to any immunoglobin<br>
class, for example IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, or IgA. It may be obtained from or derived from an<br>
animal, for example, fowl (e.g., chicken) and mammals, which includes but is not limited to a<br>
mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or other rodent, cow, horse, sheep, goat, camel, human, or other<br>
primate. The antibody may be an internalizing antibody. Production of antibodies is disclosed<br>
generally in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0146888 Al.<br>
Characterization Assays<br>
In the methods described above to generate antibodies according to the invention,<br>
including the manipulation of the specific Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C, Ab-D, and Antibody l-24(Ab-l<br>
to Ab-24) CDRs into new frameworks and/or constant regions, appropriate assays are available<br>
to select the desired antibodies or binding agents (i.e. assays for determining binding affinity to<br>
sclerosttn; cross-blocking assays; Biacore-based "human sclerostin peptide epitope competition<br>
binding assay;" MC3T3-E1 cell based assay; in vivo assays).<br>
Epitope Binding Assays<br>
Mature form human sclerostin is a 190 amino acid glycoprotein with a<br>
cystine-knot structure (Figures 8 and 9). In addition to the cystine-knot structure, the protein is<br>
characterized as having three loops designated as Loop 1, Loop 2 and Loop 3. Human sclerostin<br>
was subjected to proteolytic digestion to produce fragments. Briefly, using different proteases,<br>
including trypsin, aspN, and lysC, fragments with various cleavage sites and sizes were<br>
generated. The sequences and mass for various human sclerostin peptides were determined.<br>
Antibody protection was evaluated to determine the effect on accessibility for proteolysis,<br>
111<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
including clipped site masking and peptide shifting. Finally, a BIAcore-based "human sclerostin<br>
peptide epitope competition assay" was performed.<br>
Exposure of sclerosti  to trypsin cleavage resulted in a pattern of peptide<br>
fragments as summarized in Figure 13. The fragments are referred to as T19.2, T20, T20.6, and<br>
T21-22. As shown schematically in Figure 19B, the T20.6 epitope is a complex of four separate<br>
peptide sequences which are joined by the three disulfide bonds of the cystine-knot region. Two<br>
of the peptides are joined by two disulfide bonds. The other two peptides are linked by one<br>
disulfide bond that, schematically, bisects the first two polypeptides.<br>
The T20.6 epitope that was generated by trypsin digestion retains the<br>
cystine-knot structure of the native polypeptide and is recognized by antibodies Ab-C and Ab-D.<br>
A derivative of epitope T20.6 consists of the cystine-knot region and amino acids 58-64, 73-81,<br>
112-117 and 138-141 in sequence position with reference to SEQ ID NO.l. This derivative<br>
epitope is shown in Figure 21. An epitope comprising the cystine-knot region may have one or<br>
more amino acids that is present in the T20.6 epitope (Figure 19B) but not present in the T20.6<br>
derivative epitope (Figure 21).<br>
Another epitope-containing region was identified in the Loop 2 region of human<br>
sclerostin (Figure 19A) and is recognized by antibodies Ab-A and Ab-B. A Loop 2 epitope<br>
comprises amino acids 86-111 of SEQ ID NO:1 (C4GPARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPDFRC5,<br>
SEQ ID NO:6). Sterically, with reference to full-length sclerostin of SEQ ID NO:1, the Loop 2-<br>
containing structure is defined at one end by. a disulfide bond between cysteine at position 86<br>
(C4) and cysteine at position 144 (C8), and at the other end by a disulfide bond between cysteine<br>
at position 111 (C5) and cysteine at position 57 (Cl).<br>
The peptides generated by aspN cleavage of human sclerostin are shown in<br>
Figure 12. In the Figure, these peptides are designated as AspNl4.6, AspN18.6, and AspN22.7-<br>
23.5, and are also referred to herein as N14.6, N18.6, and N22.7-23.5, respectively.<br>
One group of antibodies exhibits a specific pattern of binding to certain epitopes<br>
as evidenced by a Biacore-based "human sclerostin peptide epitope competition binding assay."<br>
Briefly, the antibody is preincubated with the epitope to be tested, at concentrations that will<br>
saturate the epitope-binding sites on the antibody. The antibody is then exposed to sclerostin<br>
bound to a chip surface. After the appropriate incubation and washing procedures, a pattern of<br>
competitive binding is established. As shown in Figure 18, exemplary antibody Ab-D bound to<br>
sclerostin molecules attached to the surface of the chip. Preincubation of antibody Ab-D with<br>
sclerostin decreased the binding of the antibody to the sclerostin on the chip to close to zero.<br>
Preincubation with a peptide consisting of epitope T19.2 showed that T19.2 did not compete<br>
112<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
with sclerostin for antibody binding. However, preincubation with any one of the epitopes<br>
designated T20, T20.6, T21-22, or N22.7-23.5 abolished a large proportion of the binding of<br>
antibody to sclerostin on the chip. In contrast, preincubation of the antibody with any one of the<br>
epitopes designated T19.2, N14.6 or N18.6 did not abolish the ability of the antibody to bind to<br>
sclerostin. A second exemplary antibody with this binding profile (Fig. 17) is Ab-C.<br>
Antibody Ab-D therefore is exemplary and representative of a group of<br>
antibodies that bind to the epitopes T20, T20.6, T21-22, and N22.7-23.5, and have minimal<br>
detectable binding to epitopes T19.2, N14.6 and N18.6, as measured by the ability to block<br>
antibody binding to sclerostin. Antibodies having this characteristic binding pattern may or may<br>
not share amino acid sequence in one or more regions of the antibody molecule. Antibody<br>
similarity is determined functionally such as by the ability to bind to sclerostin following<br>
preincubation with each of the epitopes described above. Antibodies that exhibit a binding<br>
pattern similar or identical to that of antibody Ab-D are included in the invention. By "similar<br>
to" is meant, for example, the antibody will exhibit binding to each of the polypeptides T20,<br>
T20.6, T21-22 andN22.7-23.5 whereby this binding will specifically compete out at least 50%<br>
of the antibody's binding to sclerostin that would otherwise occur in the absence of<br>
preincubation with sclerostin or a sclerostin peptide. The antibody will also exhibit little or no<br>
detectable binding to polypeptides Tl 9.2, N14.6 and N18.6, resulting in a reduction of 30% or<br>
less of the binding that would occur in the absence of preincubation with sclerostin or a<br>
sclerostin peptide.<br>
For example, without being bound by a particular mechanism, the antibody<br>
binding pattern of Figure 18 suggests that the epitope space to which antibody Ab-D and other<br>
antibodies having the epitope binding pattern of Ab-D bind consists of a polypeptide comprising<br>
the cystine-knot region of sclerostin.<br>
Thus, as disclosed herein and with reference to Figure 19B, an exemplary T20.6<br>
epitope comprises four peptide chains attached via three separate disulfide bonds. Peptide chain<br>
SAKPVTELVC3SGQC4GPAR (SEQ ID NO.3) is attached to peptide chain<br>
LVASC7KC8KRLTR (SEQ ID NO:5) by disulfide bonds from C3 to C7, and from C4 to C8.<br>
Peptide chain DVSEYSC1RELHFTR (SEQ ID NO:2) is attached to peptide chain<br>
WWRPSGPDFRC5IPDRYR(SEQ ID NO:4) by a disulfide bond from Cl to C5. The<br>
polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs:3 and 5 remain associated with the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs:2<br>
and 4 through a steric construct whereby the C1-C5 bond crosses the plane of the C4-C8 and<br>
C3-C7 bonds and is located between them, as illustrated in Figure 19B.<br>
113<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
As disclosed herein and with reference to Figure 21, an exemplary derivative<br>
epitope of T20.6 comprises four peptide chains attached via three separate disulfide bonds.<br>
Peptide chain SAKPVTELVC3SGQC4 (SEQ ID NO.70) is attached to peptide chain<br>
LVASC7KC8 (SEQ ID NO:71) by disulfide bonds from C3 to C7, and from C4 to C8. Peptide<br>
chain C1RELHFTR (SEQ ID NO:72) is attached to peptide chain C5IPDRYR (SEQ ID NO:73)<br>
by a disulfide bond from Cl to C5. The polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs:70 and 71 remain<br>
associated with the polypeptides of SEQ ED NOs:72 and 73 through a steric construct whereby<br>
the C1-C5 bond crosses the plane of the C4-C8 and C3-C7 bonds and is located between them,<br>
as illustrated in Figure 21.<br>
Antibody Ab-A is exemplary and representative of a second group of antibodies<br>
that have a characteristic binding pattern to human sclerostin peptides that is distinct from that<br>
obtained for antibodies Ab-C and Ab-D. Ab-A and the group of antibodies it represents bind to<br>
the N22.7-23.5 epitope and have minimal detectable binding to epitopes T19.2, T20, T20.6,<br>
T21-22, N14.6 or N18.6, as measured by the ability to block antibody binding to sclerostin (Fig<br>
15). A second exemplary antibody with this binding profile (Fig. 16) is Ab-B. Antibodies<br>
having this characteristic binding pattern may or may not share amino acid sequence in one or<br>
more regions of the antibody molecule. Antibody similarity is determined functionally such as<br>
by the ability to bind to sclerostin following preincubation with each of the epitopes described<br>
above. Antibodies that exhibit a binding pattern similar or identical to that of antibody Ab-A are<br>
included in the invention. By "similar to" is meant, for example, the antibody will exhibit<br>
binding to the N22.7-23.5 polypeptide whereby this binding will specifically compete out at<br>
least 50% of the antibody's binding to sclerostin that would otherwise occur in the absence of<br>
preincubation with sclerostin or a sclerostin peptide. The antibody will also exhibit little or no<br>
detectable binding to polypeptides T19.2, T20, T20.6, T21-22, N14.6 and N18.6, resulting in a<br>
reduction of 30% or less of the binding that would occur in the absence of preincubation with<br>
sclerostin or a sclerostin peptide.<br>
For example, without being bound by a particular mechanism, the antibody<br>
binding pattern of Figure 15 suggests that the epitope space to which antibody Ab-A and other<br>
antibodies having the epitope binding pattern of Ab-A bind consists of a polypeptide comprising<br>
the Loop 2 region of sclerostin. Thus, as disclosed herein and with reference to Figure 19 A, the<br>
Loop 2 region can be described as a linear peptide, but it acquires a tertiary structure when it is<br>
present in native sclerostin or a cystine-knot-containing portion of sclerostin in which the native<br>
disulfide bond structure is maintained. The linear or tertiary structure of the Loop 2 epitope can<br>
affect antibody binding thereto, as discussed in the Examples. A Loop 2 region can comprise<br>
114<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
the following amino acid sequence: C4GPARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPDFRC5 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:6). "C4" refers to a cysteine residue located at position 86 with reference to SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
"C5" refers to a cysteine residue located at position 111 with reference to SEQ ID NO: I. In<br>
native sclerostin protein, C4 is linked to a cysteine at position 144 (C8) by a disulfide bond, and<br>
C5 is linked to a cysteine at position 57 (Cl) by a disulfide bond. Epitopes derived from the<br>
Loop 2 region include CGPARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPS (SEQ ID NO:63);<br>
GPARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSG (SEQ ID NO:64); PARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGP (SEQ ID<br>
NO:65); ARLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPD (SEQ ID NO:66); RLLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPDF<br>
(SEQ ID NO:67); LLPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPDFR (SEQ ID NO:68); and<br>
LPNAIGRGKWWRPSGPDFRC (SEQ ID NO:69)<br>
CROSS-BLOCKING ASSAYS<br>
The terms "cross-block", "cross-blocked" and "cross-blocking" are used<br>
interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an antibody or other binding agent to interfere<br>
with the binding of other antibodies or binding agents to sclerostin.<br>
The extent to which an antibody or other binding agent is able to interfere with the<br>
binding of another to sclerostin, and therefore whether it can be said to cross-block according to -<br>
the invention, can be determined using competition binding assays. One particularly suitable<br>
quantitative assay uses a Biacore machine which can measure the extent of interactions using<br>
surface plasmon resonance technology. Another suitable quantitative cross-blocking assay uses<br>
an ELISA-based approach to measure competition between antibodies or other binding agents in<br>
terms of their binding to sclerostin.<br>
BIACORE CROSS-BLOCKING ASSAY<br>
The following generally describes a suitable Biacore assay for determining<br>
whether an antibody or other binding agent cross-blocks or is capable of cross-blocking<br>
according to the invention. For convenience reference is made to two antibodies, but it will be<br>
appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the sclerostin binding agents described herein.<br>
The Biacore machine (for example the Biacore 3000) is operated in line with the manufacturer's<br>
recommendations.<br>
Thus in one cross-blocking assay, sclerostin is coupled to a CM5 Biacore chip<br>
using standard amine coupling chemistry to generate a sclerostin-coated surface. Typically 200-<br>
800 resonance units of sclerostin would be coupled to the chip (an amount that gives easily<br>
115<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
measurable levels of binding but that is readily saturable by the concentrations of test reagent<br>
being used).<br>
The two antibodies (termed A* and B*) to be assessed for their ability to cross-<br>
block each other are mixed at a one to one molar ratio of binding sites in a suitable buffer to<br>
create the test mixture. When calculating the concentrations on a binding site basis the molecular<br>
weight of an antibody is assumed to be the total molecular weight of the antibody divided by the<br>
number of sclerostin binding sites on that antibody.<br>
The concentration of each antibody in the test mix should be high enough to<br>
readily saturate the binding sites for that antibody on the sclerostin molecules captured on the<br>
Biacore chip. The antibodies in the mixture are at the same molar concentration (on a binding<br>
basis) and that concentration would typically be between 1.00 and 1.5 micromolar (on a binding<br>
site basis).<br>
Separate solutions containing antibody A* alone and antibody B* alone are also<br>
prepared. Antibody A* and antibody B* in these solutions should be in the same buffer and at<br>
the same concentration as in the test mix.<br>
The test mixture is passed over the sclerostin-coated Biacore chip and the total<br>
amount of binding recorded. The chip is then treated in such a way as to remove the bound<br>
antibodies without damaging the chip-bound sclerostin. Typically this is done by treating the<br>
chip with 30 raM HC1 for 60 seconds.<br>
The solution of antibody A* alone is then passed over the sclerostin-coated<br>
surface and the amount of binding recorded. The chip is again treated to remove all of the bound<br>
antibody without damaging the chip-bound sclerostin.<br>
The solution of antibody B* alone is then passed over the sclerostin-coated<br>
surface and the amount of binding recorded.<br>
The maximum theoretical binding of the mixture of antibody A* and antibody B*<br>
is next calculated, and is the sum of the binding of each antibody when passed over the<br>
sclerostin surface alone. If the actual recorded binding of the mixture is less than this theoretical<br>
maximum then the two antibodies are cross-blocking each other.<br>
Thus, in general, a cross-blocking antibody or other binding agent according to<br>
the invention is one which will bind to sclerostin in the above Biacore cross-blocking assay such<br>
that during the assay and in the presence of a second antibody or other binding agent of the<br>
invention the recorded binding is between 80% and 0.1% (e.g. 80% to 4%) of the maximum<br>
theoretical binding, specifically between 75% and 0.1% (e.g. 75% to 4%) of the maximum<br>
theoretical binding, and more specifically between 70% and 0.1% (e.g. 70% to 4%) of maximum<br>
SEA 1802823vl 60117-225	116<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
theoretical binding (as just defined above) of the two antibodies or binding agents in<br>
combination.<br>
The Biacore assay described above is a primary assay used to determine if<br>
antibodies or other binding agents cross-block each other according to the invention. On rare<br>
occasions particular antibodies or other binding agents may not bind to sclerostin coupled via<br>
amine chemistry to a CM5 Biacore chip (this usually occurs when the relevant binding site on<br>
sclerostin is masked or destroyed by the coupling to the chip). In such cases cross-blocking can<br>
be determined using a tagged version of Sclerostin, for example N-terminal His-tagged<br>
Sclerostin (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2005 cat# 1406-ST-025). In this particular<br>
format, an anti-His antibody would be coupled to the Biacore chip and then the His-tagged<br>
Sclerostin would be passed over the surface of the chip and captured by the anti-His antibody.<br>
The cross blocking analysis would be carried out essentially as described above, except that after<br>
each chip regeneration cycle, new His-tagged sclerostin would be loaded back onto the anti-His<br>
antibody coated surface. In addition to the example given using N-terminal His-tagged<br>
Sclerostin, C-terminal His-tagged sclerostin could alternatively be used. Furthermore, various<br>
other tags and tag binding protein combinations that are known in the art could be used for such<br>
a cross-blocking analysis (e.g. HA tag with anti-HA antibodies; FLAG tag with anti-FLAG<br>
antibodies; biotin tag with streptavidin).<br>
ELISA-BASED CROSS-BLOCKING ASSAY<br>
The following generally describes an ELISA assay for determining whether an<br>
anti-sclerostin antibody or other sclerostin binding agent cross-blocks or is capable of cross-<br>
blocking according to the invention. For convenience, reference is made to two antibodies (Ab-<br>
X and Ab-Y), but it will be appreciated that the assay can be used with any of the sclerostin<br>
binding agents described herein.<br>
The general principal of the assay is to have an anti-sclerostin antibody coated<br>
onto the wells of an ELISA plate. An excess amount of a second, potentially cross-blocking,<br>
anti-sclerostin antibody is added in solution (i.e. not bound to the ELISA plate). A limited<br>
amount of sclerostin is then added to the wells. The coated antibody and the antibody in<br>
solution compete for binding of the limited number of sclerostin molecules. The plate is washed<br>
to remove sclerostin that has not been bound by the coated antibody and to also remove the<br>
second, solution phase antibody as well as any complexes formed between the second, solution<br>
phase antibody and sclerostin. The amount of bound sclerostin is then measured using an<br>
117<br><br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
appropriate sclerostin detection reagent. An antibody in solution that is able to cross-block the<br>
coated antibody will be able to cause a decrease in the number of sclerostin molecules that the<br>
coated antibody can bind relative to the number of sclerostin molecules that the coated antibody<br>
can bind in the absence of the second, solution phase, antibody.<br>
This assay is described in more detail further below for Ab-X and Ab-Y. In the<br>
instance where Ab-X is chosen to be the immobilized antibody, it is coated onto the wells of the<br>
ELISA plate, after which the plates are blocked with a suitable blocking solution to minimize<br>
non-specific binding of reagents that are subsequently added. An excess amount of Ab-Y is<br>
then added to the ELISA plate such that the moles of Ab-Y sclerostin binding sites per well are<br>
at least 10 fold higher than the moles of Ab-X sclerostin binding sites that were used, per well,<br>
during the coating of the ELISA plate. Sclerostin is then added such that the moles of sclerostin<br>
added per well are at least 25-fold lower than the moles of Ab-X sclerostin binding sites that<br>
were used for coating each well. Following a suitable incubation period the ELISA plate is<br>
washed and a sclerostin detection reagent is added to measure the amount of sclerostin<br>
specifically bound by the coated anti-sclerostin antibody (in this case Ab-X). The background<br>
signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated antibody (in this<br>
case Ab-X), second solution phase antibody (in this case Ab-Y), sclerostin buffer only (i.e. no<br>
sclerostin) and sclerostin detection reagents. The positive control signal for the assay is defined<br>
as the signal obtained in wells with the coated antibody (in this case Ab-X), second solution<br>
phase antibody buffer only (i.e. no second solution phase antibody), sclerostin and sclerostin<br>
detection reagents. The ELISA assay needs to be run in such a manner so as to have the positive<br>
control signal be at least 6 times the background signal.<br>
To avoid any artifacts (e.g. significantly different affinities between Ab-X and<br>
Ab-Y for sclerostin) resulting from the choice of which antibody to use as the coating antibody<br>
and which to use as the second (competitor) antibody, the cross-blocking assay needs to be run<br>
in two formats:<br>
1)	format 1 is where Ab-X is the antibody that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-Y is<br>
the competitor antibody that is in solution<br>
and<br>
2)	format 2 is where Ab-Y is the antibody that is coated onto the ELISA plate and Ab-X is<br>
the competitor antibody that is in solution.<br>
118<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
Ab-X and   Ab-Y are defined as cross-blocking if, either in format 1 or in format 2,<br>
the solution phase anti-sclerostin antibody is able to cause a reduction of between 60% and<br>
100%, specifically between 70% and 100%, and more specifically between 80% and 100%, of<br>
the sclerostin detection signal (i.e. the amount of sclerostin bound by the coated antibody) as<br>
compared to the sclerostin detection signal obtained in the absence of the solution phase anti-<br>
sclerostin antibody {i.e. the positive control wells).<br>
An example of such an ELISA-based cross blocking assay can be found in<br>
Example 7 ("ELISA-based cross-blocking assay").<br>
CELL BASED NEUTRALIZATION ASSAY<br>
Mineralization by osteoblast-lineage cells in culture, either primary cells or cell<br>
lines, is used as an in vitro model of bone formation. Mineralization takes from about one to six<br>
weeks to occur beginning with the induction of osteoblast-lineage cell differentiation by one or<br>
more differentiation agents. The overall sequence of events involves cell proliferation,<br>
differentiation, extracellular matrix production, matrix maturation and finally deposition of<br>
mineral, which refers to crystallization and/or deposition of calcium phosphate. This sequence<br>
of events starting with cell proliferation and differentiation, and ending with deposition of<br>
mineral is referred to herein as mineralization. Measurement of calcium (mineral) is the output<br>
of the assay.<br>
MC3T3-E1 cells (Sudo H, Kodama H-A, Amagai Y, Yamamoto S, Kasai S.<br>
1983. In vitro differentiation and calcification in a new clonal osteogenic cell line derived from<br>
newborn mouse calvaria. J. Cell Biol. 96:191-198) and subclones of the original cell line can<br>
form mineral in culture upon growth in the presence of differentiating agents. Such subclones<br>
include MC3T3-E1-BF (Smith E, Redman R, Logg C, Coetzee G, KasaharaN, Frenkel B. 2000.<br>
Glucocorticoids inhibit developmental stage-specific osteoblast cell cycle. J. Biol. Chem.<br>
275:19992-20001). For both the MC3T3-E1-BF subclone as well as the original MC3T3-E1<br>
cells, sclerostin can inhibit one or more of the sequence of events leading up to and including<br>
mineral deposition (i.e. sclerostin inhibits mineralization). Anti-sclerostin antibodies that are<br>
able to neutralize sclerostin's inhibitory activity allow for mineralization of the culture in the<br>
presence of sclerostin such that there is a statistically significant increase in deposition of<br>
calcium phosphate (measured as calcium) as compared to the amount of calcium measured in the<br>
sclerostin-only (i.e. no antibody) treatment group. The antibodies used in the cell based<br>
mineralization assay experiments shown in Figures 22,23 and 24 have molecular weights of<br>
about 145 Kd and have 2 sclerostin binding sites per antibody molecule,<br>
119<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
When funning the assay with the goal of determining whether a particular anti-<br>
sclerostin antibody or anti-sclerostin binding agent can neutralize sclerostin (i.e., is a sclerostin<br>
neutralizing antibody or derivative thereof, or is a sclerostin neutralizing binding agent), the<br>
amount of sclerostin used in the assay needs to be the minimum amount of sclerostin that causes<br>
at least a 70%, statistically significant, reduction in deposition of calcium phosphate (measured<br>
as calcium) in the sclerostin-only group, as compared to the amount of calcium measured in the<br>
no sclerostin group. An anti-sclerostin neutralizing antibody or an anti-sclerostin neutralizing<br>
binding agent is defined as one that causes a statistically significant increase in deposition of<br>
calcium phosphate (measured as calcium) as compared to the amount of calcium measured in the<br>
sclerostin-only (i.e. no antibody, no binding agent) treatment group. To determine whether an<br>
anti-sclerostin antibody or an anti-sclerostin binding agent is neutralizing or not, the amount of<br>
anti-sclerostin antibody or anti-sclerostin binding agent used in the assay needs to be such that<br>
there is an excess of moles of sclerostin binding sites per well as compared to the number of<br>
moles of sclerostin per well. Depending on the potency of the antibody, the fold excess that may<br>
be required can be 24, 18, 12, 6, 3, or 1.5, and one of skill is familiar with the routine practice of<br>
testing more than one concentration of binding agent. For example, a very potent anti-sclerostin<br>
neutralizing antibody or anti-sclerostin neutralizing binding agent will be able to neutralize<br>
sclerostin even when there is less than a 6-fold excess of moles, of sclerostin binding sites per<br>
well as compared to the number of moles of sclerostin per weii. A less potent anti-sclerostir.<br>
neutralizing antibody or anti-sclerostin neutralizing binding agent will be able to neutralize<br>
sclerostin only at a 12,18 or 24 fold excess. Sclerostin binding agents within this full range of<br>
potencies are suitable as neutralizing sclerostin binding agents. Exemplary cell based<br>
mineralization assays are described in detail in Example 8.<br>
Anti-sclerostin antibodies and derivatives thereof that can neutralize human<br>
sclerostin, and sclerostin binding agents that can neutralize human sclerostin may be of use in<br>
the treatment of human conditions/disorders that are caused by, associated with, or result in at<br>
least one of low bone formation, low bone mineral density, low bone mineral content, low bone<br>
mass, low bone quality and low bone strength.<br>
IN VIVO NEUTRALIZATION ASSAY<br>
Increases in various parameters associated with, or that result from, the<br>
stimulation of new bone formation can be measured as an output from in vivo testing of<br>
sclerostin binding agents in order to identify those binding agents that are able to neutralize<br>
sclerostin and thus able to cause stimulation of new bone formation. Such parameters include<br>
120<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
various serurn anabolic  markers [e.g. osteocalcin, P1NP (n-terminal propeptide of type 1<br>
procollagen)], histomorphoraetric markers of bone formation (e.g. osteoblast surface/bone<br>
surface; bone formation rate/bone surface; trabecular thickness), bone mineral density, bone<br>
mineral content, bone mass, bone quality and bone strength. A sclerostin neutralizing binding<br>
agent is defined as one capable of causing a statistically significant increase, as compared to<br>
vehicle treated animals, in any parameter associated with, or that results from, the stimulation of<br>
new bone formation. Such in vivo testing can be performed in any suitable mammal (e.g.<br>
mouse, rat, monkey). An example of such in vivo testing can be found in Example 5 (In vivo<br>
testing of anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibodies").<br>
Although the amino acid sequence of scterostin is not 100% identical across<br>
mammalian species (e.g. mouse sclerostin is not 100% identical to human sclerostin), it will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art that a sclerostin binding agent that can neutralize, in vivo,<br>
the sclerostin of a certain species (e.g. mouse) and that also can bind human sclerostin in vitro is<br>
very likely to be able to neutralize human sclerostin in vivo. Thus, such a human sclerostin<br>
binding agent (e.g. anti-human sclerostin antibody) may be of use in the treatment of human<br>
conditions/disorders that are caused by, associated with, or result in at least one of low bone<br>
formation, low bone mineral density, low bone mineral content, low bone mass, low bone<br>
quality and low bone strength. Mice in which homologous recombination had been used to<br>
delete the mouse sclerostin gene and insert the human sclerostin gene in its place (i.e. human<br>
sclerostin gene knock-in mice or human SOST knock-in mice) would be an example of an<br>
additional in vivo system.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions are provided, comprising one of the<br>
above-described binding agents such as at least one of antibody Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C, Ab-D and<br>
Ab-1 toAb-24 to human sclerostin, along with a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable<br>
carrier, excipient, or diluent. Pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment are<br>
disclosed in copending Application Serial No. 10/868,497, filed June 16,2004, which claims<br>
priority to Serial No. 60/478,977, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The development of suitable dosing and treatment regimens for using the<br>
particular compositions described herein in a variety of treatment regimens, including e.g.,<br>
subcutaneous, oral, parenteral, intravenous, intranasal, and intramuscular administration and<br>
formulation, is well known in the art, some of which are briefly discussed below for general<br>
purposes of illustration.<br>
121<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
In certain applications, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be<br>
delivered via oral administration to an animal. As such, these compositions may be formulated<br>
with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard- or<br>
soft-shell gelatin capsule, or they may be compressed into tablets, or they may be incorporated<br>
directly with the food of the diet.<br>
In certain circumstances it will be desirable to deliver the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions disclosed herein subcutaneously, parentsrally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or<br>
even intraperitoneally. Such approaches are well known to the skilled artisan, some of which<br>
are further described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,543,158; U.S. Patent No. 5,641,515 and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,399,363. In certain embodiments, solutions of the active compounds as free<br>
base or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a<br>
surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid<br>
polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and<br>
use, these preparations generally will contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Illustrative pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of •<br>
sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (for example, see U.S. Patent No. 5,466,468). In all<br>
cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It '<br>
must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against<br>
the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a<br>
solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or<br>
vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as<br>
lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and/or by the<br>
use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be facilitated by various<br>
antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid,<br>
thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be<br>
brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example,<br>
aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In one embodiment, for parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, the<br>
solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic<br>
122<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection,<br>
a sterile aqueous medium that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light<br>
of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl<br>
solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of<br>
infusion, (see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th ed., pp. 1035-1038 and<br>
1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the<br>
subject being treated. Moreover, for human administration, preparations will of course<br>
preferably meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and the general safety and purity standards as required by<br>
FDA Office of Biologies standards.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compositions disclosed herein may<br>
be formulated in a neutral or salt form. Illustrative pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include the<br>
acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with<br>
inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as<br>
acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can<br>
also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium,<br>
calcium, .or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine,<br>
histidine, procaine and the "like. Upon formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner<br>
compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective.<br>
The carriers can further comprise any and all solvents, dispersion media,<br>
vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying<br>
agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such media and<br>
agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any<br>
conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic<br>
compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into<br>
the compositions. The phrase "pharmaceutically-acceptable" refers to molecular entities and<br>
compositions that do not produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to<br>
a human.<br>
In certain embodiments, liposomes, nanocapsules, microparticles, lipid particles,<br>
vesicles, and the like, are used for the introduction of the compositions of the present invention<br>
into suitable host cells/organisms. In particular, the compositions of the present invention may<br>
be formulated for delivery either encapsulated in a lipid particle, a liposome, a vesicle, a<br>
123<br><br>
I<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
nanosphere, or a nanoparticle or the like. Alternatively, compositions of the present invention<br>
can be bound, either covalently or non-covalently, to the surface of such carrier vehicles.<br>
The formation and use of liposome and liposome-like preparations as potential<br>
drug carriers is generally known to those of skill in the art (see for example, Lasic, Trends<br>
Biotechnol. 16(7):307-21, 1998; Takakura, Nippon Rinsho 56(3):691-95,1998; Chandran et al.,<br>
Indian J. Exp. Biol. 35(8):801-09, 1997; Margalit, Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 12(2-<br>
3):233-61, 1995; U.S. Patent No. 5,567,434; U.S. Patent No. 5,552,157; U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,565,213; U.S. Patent No. 5,738,868 and U.S. Patent No. 5,795,587, each specifically<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The use of liposomes does not appear to be<br>
associated with autoimmune responses or unacceptable toxicity after systemic delivery. In<br>
certain embodiments, liposomes are formed from phospholipids that are dispersed in an aqueous<br>
medium and spontaneously form multilamellar concentric bilayer vesicles (also termed<br>
multilamellar vesicles (MLVs)).<br>
Alternatively, in other embodiments, the invention provides for<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable nanocapsule formulations of the compositions of the present<br>
 invention. Nanocapsules can generally entrap compounds in a stable and reproducible way (see, '<br>
for example, Quintanar-Guerrero et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 24(12):1113-28, 1998). To<br>
avoid side effects due to intracellular polymeric overloading, such ultrafine particles (sized<br>
around 0.1µm) may be designed using polymers able to be degraded in vivo. Such particles can<br>
be made as described, for example, by Couvreur et al., Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst.<br>
5(l):l-20,1988; zurMuhien et al., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. 45(2):149-55, 1998; Zambauxet<br>
al., 7. Controlled Release 50(1-3):31-40, 1998; and U.S. Patent No. 5,145,684.<br>
In addition, pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be placed<br>
within containers, along with packaging material that provides instructions regarding the use of<br>
such pharmaceutical compositions. Generally, such instructions will include a tangible<br>
expression describing the reagent concentration, as well as within certain embodiments, relative<br>
amounts of excipient ingredients or diluents (e.g., water, saline or PBS) that may be necessary to<br>
reconstitute the pharmaceutical composition. •<br>
The dose administered may range from 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
As will be evident to one of skill in the art, the amount and frequency of- administration will<br>
depend, of course, on such factors as the nature and severity of the indication being treated, the<br>
124<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
desired response, the "condition of the patient, and so forth. Typically, the compositions may be<br>
administered by a variety of techniques, as noted above.<br>
Increases in bone mineral content and/or bone mineral density may be<br>
determined directly through the use of X-rays (e.g., Dual Energy X-ray Absorptometry or<br>
"DEXA"), or by inference through the measurement of 1) markers of bone formation and/or<br>
osteoblast activity, such as, but not limited to, osteoblast specific alkaline phosphatase,<br>
osteocalcin, type 1 procollagen C propeptide (PICP), total alkaline phosphatase (see Cornier,<br>
Curr. Opin. in Rheu. 7:243(1995)) and serum procollagen 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP)<br>
and/or 2) markers of bone resorption and/or osteoclast activity including, but not limited to,<br>
pyridinoline, deoxypryridinoline, N-telopeptide, urinary hydroxyproline, plasma tartrate-<br>
resistant acid phosphatases, and galactosyl hydroxylysine; (see Cornier, id), serum TRAP 5b<br>
(tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b) and serum cross-linked C-telopeptide (sCTXI).<br>
The amount of bone mass may also be calculated from body weights or by using other methods<br>
(see Guinness-Hey, Metab. Bone Dis. Relat. Res. 5:177-181, 1984).Animals and particular<br>
animal models are used in the art for testing the effect of the compositions and methods of the<br>
invention on, for example, parameters of bone loss, bone resorption, bone formation, bone<br>
strength or bone mineralization that mimic conditions of human disease such as osteoporosis and<br>
osteopenias. Examples of such models include the ovariectomized rat model (Kalu, D.N., The<br>
ovariectomized rat model of postmenopausal hone loss. Bone and Mineral 15:175-192 (1991);<br>

osteopenia and osteoporosis. J. Musculoskel. Neuron. Interact. 1:193-207 (2001)).<br>
Particular conditions which may be treated by the compositions of the present<br>
invention include dysplasias, wherein growth or development of bone is abnormal and a wide<br>
variety of causes of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone loss. Representative examples of such<br>
conditions include achondroplasia, cleidocranial dysostosis, enchondromatosis, fibrous<br>

Compositions of the present invention may also be useful for improving<br>
outcomes in orthopedic procedures, dental procedures, implant surgery, joint replacement, bone<br>
grafting, bone cosmetic surgery and bone repair such as fracture healing, nonunion healing,<br>
delayed union healing and facial reconstruction. One or more compositions may be<br>
administered before, during and/or after the procedure, replacement, graft, surgery or repair.<br>
The invention also provides a diagnostic kit comprising at least one anti-<br>
sclerostin binding agent according to the present invention. The binding agent may be an<br>
antibody. In addition, such a kit may optionally comprise one or more of the following:<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Recombinant Expression of Sclerostin<br>
Recombinant human sclerostin/SOST is commercially available from R&amp;D<br>
Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2006 cat# 1406-ST-025). Additionally, recombinant mouse<br>
sclerostin/SOST is commercially available from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2006<br>
cat# 1589-ST-025).	, .<br>
Alternatively, the different species of sclerostin can be expressed transiently in<br>
serum-free suspension adapted 293T or 293EBNA cells. Transfections can be performed as 500<br>
mL or 1L cultures. The following reagents and materials are available from Gibco BRL (now<br>
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Catalog numbers are listed in parentheses: serum-free DMEM<br>
(21068-028); DMEM/F12 (3:1) (21068/11765); IX Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement<br>
(51500-056); IX Pen Strep Glut (10378-016); 2mM 1-Glutamine (25030-081); 20 mM HEPES<br>
(15630-080); 0.01% Pluronic F68 (24040-032). Briefly, the cell inoculum (5.0-10.0 X 105<br>
cells/mL X culture volume) is centrifuged at 2,500 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove the<br>
conditioned medium.<br>
The cells are resuspended in serum-free DMEM and centrifuged again at 2,500<br>
RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C. After aspirating the wash solution, the cells are resuspended in<br>
growth medium [DMEM/F12 (3:1) + IX Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium Supplement + IX Pen<br>
Strep Glut + 2mM L-Glutamine + 20 mM HEPES + 0.01% Pluronic F68] in a 1L or 3L spinner<br>
flask culture. The spinner flask culture is maintained on magnetic stir plate at 125 RPM which<br>
is placed in a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. The mammalian<br>
127<br><br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
expression plasmid UNA (e.g. pcDNA3.1, pCEP4, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad,<br>
CA), containing the complete coding region (and stop codon) of sclerostin with a Kozak<br>
consensus sequence (e.g., CCACC) directly 5' of the start site ATG, is complexed to the<br>
transfection reagent in a 50 mL conical tube.<br>
The DNA-transfection reagent complex can be prepared in 5-10% of the final<br>
culture volume in serum-free DMEM or OPTI-MEM. The transfection reagents that can be used<br>
for this purpose include X-tremeGene RO-1539 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN),<br>
FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,<br>
Carlsbad, CA) and 293fectin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 1-5 ug piasmid DNA/mL culture is<br>
first added to serum-free DMEM, followed by 1-5 µl transfection reagent/mL culture. The<br>
complexes can be incubated at room temperature for approximately 10-30 minutes and then<br>
added to the cells in the spinner flask. The transfection/expression can be performed for 4-7<br>
days, after which the conditioned medium (CM) is harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for<br>
60 minutes at 4°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF RECOMBINANT SCLEROSTIN<br>
Recombinant sclerostin was purified from mammalian host cells as follows. All<br>
purification processes were carried out at room temperature. One purification scheme was used<br>
to purify various species of sclerostin, including murine and human sclerostin. The purification<br>
scheme used affinity chromatography followed by cation exchange chromatography.<br>
Heparin Chromatography<br>
The mammalian host cell conditioned medium (CM) was centrifuged in a<br>
Beckman J6-M1 centrifuge at 4000 rpm for lhour at 4°C to remove cell debris. The CM<br>
supernatant was then filtered through a sterile 0.2 urn filter. (At this point the sterile filtered CM<br>
may be optionally stored frozen until purification.) If the CM was frozen, it was thawed at the<br>
following temperatures, or combination thereof: 4°C, room temperature or,warm water.<br>
Following thawing the CM was filtered through a sterile 0.2 urn filter and optionally<br>
concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration (TFF) using a 10 kD molecular weight cut-off<br>
membrane. The CM concentrate was filtered through a sterile 0.2 µm filter and then loaded onto<br>
a Heparin High Performance (Heparin HP) column (GE Healthcare, formerly Amersham<br>
128<br><br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
Biosciences) reqquired   in PBS. Alternatively, the filtered CM supernatant may be loaded<br>
directly onto the Heparin HP column equilibrated in PBS.<br>
After loading, the Heparin HP column was washed with PBS until the absorbance<br>
at 280 nm of the flow-through returned to baseline (i.e., absorbance measured before loading<br>
CM supernatant). The sclerostin was then eluted from the column using a linear gradient from<br>
150 mM to 2M sodium chloride in PBS. The absorbance at 280 nm of the eluate was monitored<br>
and fractions containing protein were collected. The fractions were then assayed by Coomassie-<br>
stained SDS-PAGE to identify fractions containing a polypeptide that migrates at the size of<br>
glycosylated sclerostin. The appropriate fractions from the column were combined to make the<br>
Heparin HP pool.<br>
Cation Exchange Chromatography<br>
The sclerostin eluted from the Heparin HP column was further purified by cation<br>
exchange chromatography using SP High Performance (SPHP) chromatography media (GE<br>
Healthcare, formerly Amersham Biosciences). The Heparin HP pool was buffer exchanged into<br>
PBS by dialysis using 10,000 MWCO membranes (Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer). The dialyzed<br>
Heparin HP pool was then loaded onto an SPHP column equilibrated in PBS. After loading, the<br>
column was washed with PBS until the absorbance at 280 nm of the flow-through returned to<br>
baseline. The sclerostin was then eluted from the SPHP column using a linear gradient from 150<br>
mM to 1.M sodium chloride in PBS. The absorbance at 280 nm of the eluate was monitored and<br>
the eluted sclerostin was collected in fractions. The fractions were then assayed by Coomassie-<br>
stained SDS-PAGE to identify fractions containing a polypeptide that migrates at the size of<br>
glycosylated sclerostin. The appropriate fractions from the column were combined to make the<br>
SPHP pool.<br>
Formulation<br>
Following purification, the SPHP pool was formulated in PBS by dialysis using<br>
10,000 MWCO membranes (Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer). If concentration of sclerostin was<br>
necessary, a centrifugal device (Amicon Centricon or Centriprep) with a 10;000 MWCO<br>
membrane was used. Following formulation the sclerostin was filtered through a sterile 0.2 µm<br>
filter and stored at 4°C or frozen.<br>

A series of overlapping peptides (each peptide being approximately 20-25 amino acids<br>

NO:98). The peptides were designed such that they all contained a reduced cysteine residue; an<br>
additional cysteine was included at the C-terminus of each peptide which did not already contain<br>
one in its sequence. This enabled the peptides to be bound to the assay plates by covalent<br>
coupling, using commercially available sulfhydryl binding plates (Costar), at a concentration of<br>
lµg/ml, in phosphate buffered saline (PBS: pH 6.5) containing I mM EDTA. Following<br>
incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, the plates were washed three times with PBS<br>
containing 0.5% Tween 20. The plates were blocked by incubation with a PBS solution<br>
containing 0.5% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then washed<br>
three times in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20.<br>
Antibodies to be tested were diluted to lµg/ml in PBS containing 0.5%<br>
fish skin gelatin and incubated with the peptide-coated plates for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
Excess antibody was removed by three washes with PBS, 0.5% Tween 20. The plates were then<br>
incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted<br>
appropriately in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20) and capable of binding to the antibody of<br>
interest. The plates were then washed three times: once with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20,<br>
and twice with PBS. Finally the plates were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase<br>
chromogenic substrate (TMB-Stable Stop, RDI) for 5 minutes at room temperature, the color<br>
development was stopped with acid, and the plates' optical density measured at 450nm.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
IDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN SCLEROSTIN EPITOPES<br>
Sclerostin structure<br>
Mature form (signal peptide removed) human sclerostin is a 190 amino acid<br>
protein (Figure 8). Figure 9 shows a schematic of the general structure of sclerostin with an N-<br>
terminal arm (from the N-terminal Q to Cysteinel) and a C-terminal arm (from Cysteine8 to the<br>
terminal Y). Sandwiched in between these two arms there is the cystine-knot structure and three<br>
loops which are designated Loopl, Loop2 and Loop 3. The four disulfide bonds in sclerostin<br>
are Cysl at sequence position 57 linked to Cys5 at sequence position 111 (referred to as C1-C5),<br>
Cys2 at sequence position 71 linked to Cys6 at sequence position 125 (referred to as C2-C6),<br>
Cys3 at sequence position 82 linked to Cys7 at sequence position 142 (referred to as C3-C7),<br>
Cys4 at sequence position 86 linked to Cys8 at sequence position 144 (referred to as C4-C8).<br>
The eight-membered ring structure is formed via C3-C7 and C4-C8 disulfide bonding. This ring<br>
structure, together with the C1-C5 disulfide bond penetrating through the ring, forms a typical<br>
cystine-knot. C2-C6, which is not part of the cystine-knot, brings two large loop structures, loop<br>
1 (residues 57 to 82) and loop 3 (residues 111 to 142) close together. Loop 2 goes from C4<br>
(residue 86) to C5 (residue 111).<br>
Experimental<br>
The general approach for characterizing the epitopes bound by anti-sclerostin<br>
monoclonal antibodies involved fragmenting human Sclerostin into peptides with different<br>
proteases, determining the sequence of the various human sclerostin peptides, isolating these<br>
peptides and testing each of them for their ability to bind to a particular monoclonal antibody<br>
132<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
using a Biacore based human sclerostin peptide epitope competition binding assay.". The<br>
resulting data permitted the location of the binding epitope to be determined.<br>
The peptide digests were subjected to HPLC peptide mapping; the individual<br>
peaks were collected, and the peptides identified and mapped by matrix assisted laser desorption<br>
mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and electrospray ionization LC-MS (ESI-LC-MS) analyses<br>
and/or by N-terminal sequencing. All HPLC analyses for these studies were performed using a<br>
reverse-phase C8 column (2.1 mm i.d. x 15 cm length). HPLC peptide mapping was performed<br>
with a linear gradient from 0.05% trifloroacetic acid (mobile phase A) to 90% acetonitrile in<br>
0.05% trifuoroacetic acid. Columns were developed over 50 minutes at a flow rate of 0.2<br>
ml/min.<br>
Trvpsin and AspN Endoproteinase Digestions<br>
Mature form human sclerostin was digested with trypsin, which cleaves after<br>
arginine and lysine, or with AspN. About 200 µg of sclerostin at 0.5-1.0 mg/ml was incubated<br>
in PBS (pH 7.2) for 20 hrs at 37°C with 8 µg of either trypsin or AspN.<br>
Trvpsin digestion<br>
HPLC chromatography of the trypsin digests yielded several major peaks<br>
(Fig. 10A). Sequence analysis was conducted on the peptide peaks recovered from HPLC after<br>
trypsin digestion. On-line ESI LC-MS analysis of the peptide digest was also performed to<br>
determine the precise mass of the peptides that were separated by HPLC. The identity of the<br>
peptides present in the peptide peaks was thus determined (Fig. 11). Figure 13 shows the<br>
alignment of various peptide sequences (T19.2, T20, T20.6, T21-22) along the sclerostin<br>
sequence. The number following each T (e.g., T19.2) reflects the retention time. T19.2 contains<br>
two peptides (one from loop 1 and one from loop 3) linked by the C2-C6 disulfide bond. T20<br>
contains two peptides held together by the cystine-knot structure, with intact loops 1 and 3 held<br>
together by the C2-C6 disulfide and with most of loop 2 absent. T20.6 contains four sequences<br>
held together by the cystine-knot structure, but is missing part of loop 1 and 3 (the T19.2 part)<br>
and is missing most of loop 2. T21-22 is almost identical to T20 but has 3 additional amino<br>
acids in the loop 2 region.<br>
AspN Digestion<br>
HPLC chromatography of the AspN digests yielded several major peaks<br>
(Fig. 10B). Sequence analysis was conducted on the peptide peaks recovered from HPLC. On-<br>
133<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
line ESILC-MS analysis of the peptide digest was also performed to determine the precise mass<br>
of the peptides that were separated by HPLC. The identity of the peptides present in the peptide<br>
peaks from the AspN digestion was thus determined (Fig. 12). Figure 14 shows the alignment<br>
of various peptide sequences (AspN14.6, AspN18.6, AspN22.7-23.5) along the sclerostin<br>
sequence. The number following each AspN (e.g. AspN18.6) reflects the retention time.<br>
AspN14.6 contains three short peptides from both the N- and C-terminal arms of sclerostin,<br>
while AspN18.6 is a larger peptids from the N-terminal arm of sclerostin. AspN22.7-23.5<br>
contains a single peptide fragment of 104 amino acids the encompasses all eight cysteines (the<br>
four disulfide bonds), the cystine-knot and all of loops 1,2 and 3.<br>
The strategy for characterizing the epitopes was to use these various trypsin and<br>
AspN generated human sclerostin peptides and determine which peptides could still be bound by<br>
the various Antibodies (Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C and Ab-D). Specifically this was tested in a<br>
Biacore-based "human sclerostin peptide epitope competition binding assay" where the binding<br>
of a particular monoclonal antibody to human sclerostin immobilized on the Biacore chip was<br>
determine in the presence or absence of each of the various isolated trypsin and AspN HPLC<br>
peptide fractions. In the absence of any competing peptides, the particular monoclonal antibody<br>
was able to bind the human sclerostin on the chip and produce a resonance unit, RU, response.<br>
Preincubation of the particular monoclonal antibody with intact human sclerostin in solution,<br>
followed by testing of binding to the chip, demonstrated that the binding of the Mab to human<br>
sclerostin in solution prevented  the binding of the Mab to the human sclerostin on the chip, thus<br>
validating the general principal of this competition assay.<br>
This general procedure was repeated individually for each peptide. A robust RU<br>
response was taken to indicate that the particular peptide being tested could not bind the Mab in<br>
solution (hence the Mab was free to bind the human sclerostin that had been immobilized on the<br>
chip). Conversely, the absence of a robust RU response indicated that the Mab was able to bind<br>
the sclerostin peptide in solution. These binding patterns, couple with the known identity of the<br>
various sclerostin peptides, were used to determine the epitopes of sclerostin that were bound by<br>
anti-sclerostin antibodies Ab-A, Ab-B, Ab-C and Ab-D.<br>
BIACORE-BASED HUMAN SCLEROSTIN PEPTIDE EPITOPE COMPETITION BINDING ASSAY<br>
Preparation of human sclerostin surface:<br>
Immobilization of mature form human sclerostin to a BIAcore sensor chip (CM5)<br>
surface was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, carboxyl groups on the<br>
134<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
sensor chip surfaces were activated by injecting 60 µL of a mixture containing 0.2 M N-ethyl-<br>
N'-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS).<br>
Human sclerostin was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0 at a concentration of 20 ug/mL<br>
followed by injecting over the activated CMS surface. Excess reactive groups on the surfaces<br>
were deactivated by injecting 60 uL of 1 M ethanolamine. Final immobilized levels were ~<br>
5000 resonance units (RU) for the human sclerostin surface. A blank, mock-coupled reference<br>
surface was also prepared on the sensor chips.<br>
Binding specificity analysis:<br>
IX Phosphate-buffered saline without calcium chloride or magnesium chloride<br>
was from Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. Bovine serum albumin, fraction V, IgG-free was<br>
from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. Each Mab (2 nM) was separately incubated with 20 nM<br>
human sclerostin or a particular human sclerostin peptide (note: there are 3 unlinked peptides in '<br>
AspN14.6) in sample buffer (IX PBS + 0.005% P-20 + 0.1 mg/mL BSA) before injection over<br>
the immobilized human sclerostin surface. The flow rate for sample injection was 5 uL/min<br>
followed by surface regeneration using 1 M NaCl in 8 mM Glycine, pH 2.0 at 30 uL/min for 30<br>
seconds. The data was analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.2r and is presented in Figure 15 (Ab-A),<br>
Figure 16 (Ab-B), Figure 17 (Ab-C) and Figure 18 (Ab-D).<br>
Loop 2 and T20.6 epitopes:<br>
The sclerostin peptide binding pattern for two representative antibodies (Ab-A<br>
and Ab-B) were virtually identical (Fig. 15 and Fig. 16) and showed that both of these<br>
Antibodies could only bind the AspN22.7-23.5 peptide. The unique difference between<br>
AspN22.7-23.5 and all the other sclerostin peptides is that AspN22.7-23.5 contains an intact<br>
loop 2. This shows that Ab-A and Ab-B bind the loop 2 region of sclerostin thus defining the<br>
loop 2 epitope (Fig. 19A). The sclerostin peptide binding pattern for Ab-C and Ab-D were<br>
virtually identical to each other (Fig. 17 and Fig. 18) but completely distinct from that found for<br>
Ab-A and Ab-B. Of the peptides tested in this Example, the most diminutive peptide that Ab-C<br>
and Ab-D could bind to was the T20.6 peptide. This result defines the T20-6 epitope (Fig. 19B).<br>
Protease protection assay:<br>
The general principle of this assay is that binding of a Mab to sclerostin can result<br>
in protection of certain specific protease cleavage sites and this information can be used to<br>
determine the region of sclerostin to where the Mab binds.<br>
135<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
"T20.6 derivative I (cystine-knot + 4 arms)" epitope:<br>
Figure 20 shows the HPLC peptide maps for a human sclerostin Ab-D complex<br>
(Fig 20A: human sclerostin was preincubated at a 1:1 molar ratio with Ab-D prior to digestion<br>
with trypsin as described above) and human sclerostin alone (Fig 20B: human sclerostin was<br>
digested with trypsin as described above). The peptide peaks of T19.2 and T20.6 in Figure 20A<br>
showed a clear reduction in their respective peak height, as compared to Figure 20B. This<br>
reduction in peak heights was accompanied by an increase in peak height for peptides T20 and<br>
T21-22. These data indicate that basic amino acid residues in loop 1 and loop 3, which in the<br>
absence of Ab-D were cleaved by trypsin to generate peptides T19.2 and T20.6, were resistant to<br>
cleavage by trypsin when Ab-D was prebound to sclerostin. The presence of T20, T20.6 and<br>
T21-22 indicates that loop 2 was still cleaved efficiently when Ab-D was prebound to sclerostin.<br>
These data indicate that Ab-D bound on the loop 1 and loop 3 side of the T20.6 epitope thus<br>
defining the smaller "T20.6 derivative 1 (cystine-knot + 4 arms)" epitope shown in Figure 21.<br>

• ,	EXAMPLE 6<br>
SCREENING ASSAY FOR ANTIBODIES THAT BLOCK BINDING OF AN ANTIBODY<br>
TO HUMAN SCLEROSTIN<br>
Human sclerostin was coupled to a CM5 Biacore chip using standard amine<br>
coupling chemistry to generate a sclerostin coated surface. 300 resonance units of sclerostin<br>
were coupled to the surface.<br>
The antibodies to be-tested were diluted to a concentration of 200ug/ml in HBS-<br>
EP buffer (being 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4,150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.065% (v/v) Surfactant<br>
P20) and then mixed in a one to one molar ratio (on a binding site basis) to generate the test<br>
mixture. This test mixture thus contained each antibody at a concentration of lOOug/ml (1.3um<br>
on a binding site basis). Separate solutions containing each of the antibodies in the test mix<br>
alone were also prepared. These solutions contained the individual antibodies in HBS-EP buffer<br>
at a concentration of 100µg/ml (1.3um on a binding site basis).<br>
137<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
20µL of the test mixture was passed over the sclerostin-coated chip at a flow rate<br>
of 10 µL/min and the amount of binding recorded. The chip was then treated with two 60<br>
second pulses of 30 mM HC1 to remove all of the bound antibody. A solution containing only<br>
one of the antibodies of the test mixture (at L.3µM in the same buffer as the test mixture on a<br>
binding site basis) was then passed over the chip in the same manner as the test mixture and the<br>
amount of binding recorded. The chip was again treated to remove all of the bound antibody and<br>
finally a solution containing the other antibody from the test mixture alone (at 1.3µM in the<br>
same buffer as the test mixture on a binding site basis) was passed over the chip and the amount<br>
of binding recorded.<br>
The table below show the resu its irom cross-blocking assays on a range of<br>
different antibodies. The values in each square of the table represent the amount of binding (in<br>
RU) seen when the antibodies (at 1 .3µM on a binding site basis) or buffer indicated in the top<br>
row of the table were mixed with the antibodies (at 1.3µM on a binding site basis) or buffer<br>
indicated in the first column of the table.<br><br>
Using the mean binding value (in RU) for each combination of antibodies in the<br>
above table (since each combination appears twice) it is possible to calculate the percentage of<br>
the theoretical binding shown by each combination of antibodies. The theoretical binding being<br>
calculated as the sum of the average values for the components of each test mixture when<br>
assayed alone (i.e., antibody and buffer).<br><br>
From the above data it is clear that Ab-4, Ab-A and Ab-19 cross-block each<br>

other. Similarly Ab-13 and Ab-3 cross block each other.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
ELISA-BASED CROSS-BLOCKING ASSAY<br>
Liquid volumes used in this example would be those typically used in 96-well<br>
plate ELISAs (e.g. 50-200 µl/well). Ab-X and Ab-Y, in this example are assumed to have<br>
molecular weights of about 145 Kd and to have 2 sclerostin binding sites per antibody molecule.<br>
An anti-sclerostin antibody (Ab-X) is coated (e.g. 50u of 1 µg/ml) onto a 96-well ELISA plate<br>
[e.g. Corning 96 Well EIA/RIA Flat Bottom Microplate (Product # 3590), Corning Inc., Acton,<br>
MA] for at least one hour. After this coating step the antibody solution is removed, the plate is<br>
washed once or twice with wash solution (e.g., PBS and 0.05% Tween 20) and is then blocked<br>
using an appropriate blocking solution (e.g., PBS, 1% BSA, 1% goat serum and 0.5% Tween 20)<br>
and procedures known in the art. Blocking solution is then removed from the ELISA plate and a<br>
second anti-sclerostin antibody (Ab-Y), which is being tested for it's ability to cross-block the<br>
coated antibody, is added in excess (e.g. 50µl of 10µg/ml) in blocking solution to the appropriate<br>
wells of the ELISA plate. Following this, a limited amount (e.g. 50 µl of 10 ng/ml) of sclerostin<br>
in blocking solution is then added to the appropriate wells and the plate is incubated for at least<br>
one hour at room temperature while shaking. The plate is then washed 2-4 times with wash<br>
solution. An appropriate amount of a sclerostin detection reagent [e.g., biotinylated anti-<br>
sclerostin polyclonal antibody that has been pre-complexed with an appropriate amount of a<br>
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate] in blocking solution is added to the<br>
ELISA plate and incubated for at least one hour at room temperature. The plate is then washed<br>
at least 4 times with wash solution and is developed with an appropriate reagent [e.g. HRP<br>
substrates such as TMB (colorimetric) or various HRP luminescent substrates]. The background<br>
signal for the assay is defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated antibody (in this<br>
case Ab-X), second solution phase antibody (in this case Ab-Y), sclerostin buffer only (i.e. no<br>
sclerostin) and sclerostin detection reagents. The positive control signal for the assay is defined<br>
as the signal obtained in wells with the coated antibody (in this case Ab-X), second solution<br>
phase antibody buffer only (i.e. no second solution phase antibody), sclerostin and sclerostin<br>
detection reagents. The ELISA assay needs to be run in such a manner so as to have the positive<br>
control signal be at least 6 times the background signal.<br>
To avoid any artifacts (e.g. significantly different affinities between Ab-X and<br>
Ab-Y for sclerostin) resulting from the choice of which antibody touse as the coating antibody<br>
and which to use as the second (competitor) antibody, the cross-blocking assay needs to be run<br>

sclerostin antibody (i.e. the positive control wells).<br>
In the event that a tagged version of sclerostin is used in the ELISA, such as a N-<br>
terminal His-tagged Sclerostin (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2005 cat# 1406-ST-<br>
025) then an appropriate type of sclerostin detection reagent would include an HRP labeled anti-<br>
His antibody. In addition to using N-terminal His-tagged Sclerostin, one could also use C-<br>
terminal His-tagged Sclerostin. Furthermore, various other tags and tag binding protein<br>
combinations that are known in the art could be used in this ELISA-based cross-blocking assay<br>
(e.g.;  HA tag with anti-HA antibodies; FLAG tag with anti-FLAG antibodies; biotin tag with<br>
streptavidin).	■ .<br>

CELL BASED MINERALIZATION ASSAY FOR IDENTIFYING AGENTS<br>
ABLE TO ANTAGONIZE SCLEROSTIN ACTIVITY<br>
Introduction<br>
Mineralization by osteoblast-lineage cells in culture, either primary cells or cell<br>
lines, is used as an in vitro model of bone formation. Mineralization takes from about one to six<br>
weeks to occur beginning with the induction of osteoblast-lineage cell differentiation by one or<br>
more differentiation agents. The overall sequence of events involves cell proliferation,<br>
differentiation, extracellular matrix production, matrix maturation and finally deposition of<br>
mineral, which refers to crystallization and/or deposition of calcium phosphate. This sequence<br>
of events starting with cell proliferation and differentiation, and ending with deposition of<br>
mineral is referred to herein as mineralization. Measurement of calcium .(mineral) is the output<br>
of the assay.<br>
140<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCTAJS2006/016441<br>
Deposition of mineral has a strong biophysical characteristic, in that once mineral<br>
"seeds" begin to form, the total amount of mineral that will be deposited in the entire culture can<br>
sometimes be deposited quite rapidly, such as within a few days thereafter. The timing and<br>
extent of mineral deposition in culture is influenced, in part, by the particular osteoblast-lineage<br>
cells/cell-line being used, the growth conditions, the choice of differentiation agents and the<br>
particular lot number of serum used in the cell culture media. For osteoblast-lineage cell/cell-<br>
line mineralization cultures, at least eight to fifteen serum lots from more than one supplier<br>
should be tested in order to identify a particular serum lot that allows for mineralization to take<br>
place.<br>
MC3T3-E1 cells (Sudo H et al., In vitro differentiation and calcification in a new<br>
clonal osteogenic cell line derived from newborn mouse calvaria. J. Cell Biol. 96:191-198) and<br>
subclones of the original cell line can form mineral in culture upon Growth in the presence of<br>
differentiating agents. Such subclones include MC3T3-E1-BF (Smith E, Redman R, Logg C,<br>
Coetzee G, Kasahara N, Frenkel B. 2000. Glucocorticoids inhibit developmental stage-specific<br>
osteoblast cell cycle. J Biol Chem 275:19992-20001).<br>
Identification of Sclerostin Neutralizing Antibodies<br>
MC3T3-E1-BF cells were used for the mineralization assay. Ascorbic acid and<br>
B-glycerophosphate were used to induce MC3T3-E1-BF cell differentiation leading to mineral<br>
deposition. The specific screening protocol, in 96-well format, involved plating cells on a<br>
Wednesday, followed by seven media changes (as described further below) over a 12-day period<br>
with most of the mineral .deposition taking place in the final approximately eighteen hours (e.g.<br>
Sunday night through Monday). For any given treatment, 3 wells were used (N=3). The<br>
specific timing, and extent, of mineral deposition may vary depending, in part, on the particular<br>
serum lot number being used. Control experiments will allow such variables to be accounted<br>
for, as is well know in the art of cell culture experimentation generally.<br>
In this assay system sclerostin inhibited one or more of the sequence of events<br>
leading up to and including mineral deposition (i.e., sclerostin inhibited mineralization). Anti-<br>
sclerostin antibodies that were able to neutralize sclerostin's inhibitory activity allowed for<br>
mineralization of the culture in the presence of sclerostin such that there was a statistically<br>
significant increase in deposition of calcium phosphate (measured as calcium) as compared to<br>
the amount of calcium measured in the sclerostin-only (i.e., no antibody) treatment group. For<br>
statistical analysis (using MS Excel and JMP) a 1-way-ANOVA followed by Dunnett's<br>
comparison was used to determine differences between groups. Group means for each data set<br>
141<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
were considered significantly different when the P value was less than 0.05 (P 
representative result from running this assay is shown in Figure 22. In the absence of<br>
recombinant mouse sclerostin, the sequence of events leading up to and including mineral.<br>
deposition proceeded normally. Calcium levels in each treatment group are shown as means ±<br>
Standard Error of the Mean (SEM). In this exemplary experiment calcium levels from the<br>
calcium assay were -31 µg/ml. However, addition of recombinant mouse sclerostin caused<br>
inhibition of mineralization, and calcium was reduced by ~ 85%. Addition of anti-sclerostin<br>
monoclonal antibody Ab-19 or Ab-4 along with the recombinant sclerostin resulted in a<br>
statistically significant increase in mineral deposition, as compared to the sclerostin-only group,<br>
because the inhibitory activity of sclerostin was neutralized by either antibody. The results from<br>
this experiment indicate that Ab-19 and Ab-4 are sclerostin neutralizing monoclonal antibodies<br>
(Mabs).<br>
Figure 23 shows a very similar result using recombinant human sclerostin and<br>
two humanized anti-sclerostin Mabs. Figure 24 also shows a very similar result using<br>
recombinant human sclerostin and mouse and humanized anti-sclerostin Mabs as indicated.<br>
The antibodies used for the experiments shown in Fig 22, 23 and 24 have<br>
molecular weights of about 145 Kd and have 2 sclerostin binding sites per antibody molecule.<br>
A detailed MC3T3-E1-BF cell culture protocol is described below.<br>

Alpha-MEM is usually manufactured with a 1 year expiration date. Alpha-MEM that was not<br>
older than 6-months post-manufacture date was used for the cell culture.<br>
Expansion Medium (Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu) was prepared as follows:<br>
142<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
A 500 mL bottLe of FBS was thawed and filter sterilized through a 0.22 micron filter.<br>
100 mis of this FBS was added to 1 liter of Alpha-MEM followed by the addition of 10 mis of<br>
100x PenStrepGlutamine. Unused FBS was aliquoted and refrozen for later use.<br>
Differentiation Medium (Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu, + 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid, + 10<br>
mM beta-glycerophosphate) was prepared as follows:<br>
100 mis of Differentiation Medium was prepared by supplementing 100 mis of Expansion<br>
Medium with ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate as follows:<br>
Stock cone	Volume	Final Cone.<br>
(see below)<br>
Ascorbic acid	10mg/ml	0.5 mis	100 µg/ml (50ug/ml + 50µg/ml)<br>
P-glycerophosphate 1M	1.0 mis	10 mM<br>
Differentiation Medium was made by supplementing Expansion Medium only on<br>
the day that the Differentiation media was going to be used for cell culture. The final<br>
concentration of ascorbic acid in Differentiation medium is 100 µg/ml because Alpha-MEM<br>
already contains 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid stock solution (10 mg/ml) was made and<br>
aliquoted for freezing at -80°C. Each aliquot was only used once (i.e. not refrozen). Beta-<br>
glycerophosphate stock solution (1 M) was made and aliquoted for freezing at -20°C. Each<br>
aliquot was frozen and thawed a maximum of 5 times before being discarded.<br>
Cell Culture for expansion of MC3T3-E1-BF cells.<br>
Cell culture was performed at 37°C and 5% CO2. A cell bank was generated for<br>
the purposes of screening for sclerostin neutralizing antibodies. The cell bank was created as<br>
follows:<br>
One vial of frozen MC3T3-E1-BF cells was thawed by agitation in a 37°C water<br>
bath. The thawed cells were put into 10 mis of Expansion Medium (Alpha-<br>
MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu) in a 50 ml tube and gently spun down for 5 minutes. The cells<br>
were then resuspended in 4 mis of Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu. After determining the<br>
number of cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, 1 x 106 cells were plated in 50 mis<br>
Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media in one TI75 flask.<br>
When this passage was confluent (at approximately 7 days), the cells were<br>
143<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
trypsinized witH trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 raM EDTA), gently spun down for 5<br>
minutes and then resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu. After determining<br>
the number of cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, cells were plated at 1 x 106 cells in 50<br>
mis Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media per one T175 flask. The number of T175 flasks<br>
used for plating at this point depended upon the total cell number available and the desired<br>
number of flasks that were to be taken forward to the next passage. Extra cells were frozen<br>
down at l-2x106 live cells/ml in 90%FBS/10%DMSO.<br>
When this passage was confluent (about 3-4 days), the cells were trypsinized with<br>
trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0-53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and then<br>
resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu. After determining the number of<br>
cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, cells were plated at 1 x 106 cells in 50 mls Alpha-<br>
MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media per one-T175 flask. The number of T175 flasks used for<br>
plating at this point depended upon the total cell number available and the desired number of<br>
flasks that were to be taken forward to the next passage. Extra cells were frozen down at 1-<br>
2xl06 live cells/ml in 90%FBS/10%DMSO.<br>
When this passage was confluent (about 3-4 days), the cells were trypsinized with<br>
trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and then<br>
resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu. After determining the number of<br>
cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, cells were plated at 1 x 106 cells in 50 mls Alpha-<br>
MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu media per one T175 flask. The number of T175 flasks used for<br>
plating at this point depended upon the total cell number available and the desired number of<br>
flasks that were to be taken forward to the next passage. Extra cells were frozen down at 1-<br>
2x106 live cells/ml in 90%FBS/10%DMSO.<br>
When this passage was confluent (about 3-4 days), the cells were trypsinized with<br>
trypsin/EDTA (0.05% Trypsin; 0.53 mM EDTA), gently spun down for 5 minutes and then<br>
resuspended in 5 mls Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu. After determining the number of<br>
cells using trypan blue and hemacytometer, the cells were frozen down at 1-2x10 live cells/ml<br>
in 90%FBS/10%DMSO. This "final passage" of frozen cells was the passage that was used for<br>
the screening assay.<br>
Cell Culture for mineralizing MC3T3-E1-BF cells.<br>
Cell culture was performed at 37°C and 5% CO2. It is desirable to minimize<br>
temperature and % CO2 fluctuations during the mineralization cell culture procedure. This can<br>
144<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
be achieved by minimizing the time that plates spend out of the incubator during feeding and<br>
also by minimizing the number of times the incubator door is opened and closed during the<br>
mineralization cell culture procedure. In this regard having a tissue culture incubator that is .<br>
dedicated exclusively for the mineralization cell culture (and thus not opened and closed more<br>
than is necessary) can be helpful.<br>
An appropriate number of "final passage" vials prepared as described above were<br>
thawed by agitation in a 37°C water bath. The thawed cells were put into 10 mls of Expansion<br>
Medium (Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu) in a 50 ml tube and gently spun down for 5<br>
minutes. The cells were then resuspended in 4 mls of Alpha-MEM/10%FBS/PenStrepGlu.<br>
After determining the number of cells by trypan blue and hemacytometer, 2500 cells were plated<br>
in 200 microliters of Expansion media per well on collagen I coated 96-well plates (Becton<br>
Dickinson Labware, cat # 354407).<br>
To avoid a mineralization plate-edge effect, cells were not plated in the outermost<br>
row/column all the way around the plate. Instead 200 microliters of PBS was added to these<br>
wells.<br>
Exemplary cell culture procedure<br>
In the following procedure, the starting day for plating the cells is indicated to be<br>
a Wednesday. If a different day of the week is used as the starting day for plating the cells, that<br>
day will trigger the daily schedule for removing and adding media, during the entire process as<br>
indicated below. For example, if the cells are plated on a Tuesday, media should not be<br>
removed and added on the first Friday and Saturday, nor on the second Friday and Saturday.<br>
With a Tuesday start, the plates would be prepared for the calcium assay on the final Sunday.<br>
Cells were plated on a Wednesday at 2500 cells in 200 µl of Expansion media.<br>
On Thursday all of the Expansion media was removed and 200 ul of differentiation Media was<br>
added.<br>
On Friday 100 µl of media was removed and 100 µl of fresh Differentiation Media was added.<br>
On Monday 100 µl of media was removed and 100 µl of fresh Differentiation Media was added.<br>
On Tuesday 100 µl of media was removed and 100 µl of fresh Differentiation Media was added.<br>
On Wednesday 100 µl of media was removed and 100 µl of fresh Differentiation Media was<br>
added.<br>
On Thursday 100 µl of media was removed and 100 ul of fresh Differentiation Media was<br>
added.<br>
145<br><br>
WO 2006/119107	PCT/US2006/016441<br>
On Friday 100 µl of media was removed and 100 µl of fresh Differentiation Media was added.<br>
On the following Monday plates were prepared for the calcium assay as follows:<br>
Plates were washed once with 10 mM Tris, HC1 pH 7-8.<br>
Working under a fume hood, 200 u.1 of 0.5 N HCl was added per well. Plates were then frozen<br>
at-80°C.<br>
Just prior to measuring calcium, the plates were freeze-thawed twice, and then<br>
trituration with a multichannel pipette was used to disperse the contents of the plate. The<br>
contents of the plate was then allowed to settle at 4oC for 30 minutes at which point an<br>
appropriate amount of supernatant was removed for measuring calcium using a commercially<br>
available calcium kit. An exemplary and not-limiting kit is Calcium (CPC) Liquicolor, Cat. No.<br>
0150-250, Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX.<br>
In this cell based assay, sclerostin inhibits one or more of the sequence of events<br>
leading up to and including mineral deposition (i.e. sclerostin inhibits mineralization). Thus, in<br>
experiments where sclerostin was included in the particular cell culture experiment, the<br>
recombinant sclerostin was added to the media starting on the first Thursday and every feeding<br>
day thereafter. In cases where an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody (Mab) was being tested<br>
for the ability to neutralize sclerostin. i.e. allow for mineralization by neutralizing sclerostin's<br>
ability to inhibit mineralization, the Mab was added to the media starting on the first Thursday<br>
and every feeding day thereafter. According to the protocol, this was accomplished as follows:<br>
the Mab was preincubated with the recombinant sclerostin in Differentiation media for 45-60<br>
minutes at 37°C and then this media was used for feeding the cells.<br>
Described above is a 12-day mineralization protocol for MC3T3-E1-BF cells.<br>
Using the same reagents and feeding protocol, the original MC3T3-E1 cells (Sudo H, Kodama<br>
H-A, Amagai Y, Yamamoto S, Kasai S. 1983. In vitro differentiation and calcification in a new<br>
clonal osteogenic cell line derived from newborn mouse calvaria. J Cell Biol 96:191-198) which<br>
we obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (RCB 1126, RIKEN BioResource Center 3-1-1<br>
Koyadai,Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki 305-0074 Japan) took longer to mineralize (20 days total for<br>
mineralization) than the MC3T3-E1-BF cells. Mineralization of the original MC3T3-E1 cells<br>
was inhibited by recombinant sclerostin and this inhibition was blocked using a sclerostin<br>
neutralizing antibody.<br>

CD45RB"' TRANSFER MODEL OF COLITIS IN SCID MICE<br>
Summary of model<br>
Injection of the CD45RBhigh subset of CD4+ T cells into C.B-17 scid mice results<br>
in chronic intestinal inflammation with characteristics similar to those of human inflammatory<br>
bowel disease (D3D). Diarrhoea and wasting disease is noted 3-5 weeks after cell transfer with<br>
severe leukocyte infiltration into the colon accompanied by epithelial cell hyperplasia and<br>
granuloma formation. C.B-17 scid mice which receive the reciprocal subset of CD4+ cells, those<br>
which express CD45RBlow, do not exhibit colitis and have a weight gain indistinguishable from<br>
uninjected scid mice. In addition to colitis symptoms, the CD4+ CD45RBhigh T cell transfer<br>
model of colitis is accompanied by a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), thought to be<br>
primarily through inflammatory mechanisms rather than dietary malabsorption (Byrne, F. R. et<br>
al., Gut 54:78-86,2005).<br>
Induction of colitis and inflammation-induced bone loss<br>
Spleens were taken from female balb/c mice and disrupted through a 70µm cell<br>
strainer. The CD4+ population was then enriched by negative selection with Dynabeads using<br>
antibodies against B220, MAC-1, CD8 and I-Ad. The enriched population was then stained with<br>
FITC conjugated anti-CD4 and PE conjugated anti-CD45RB and fractionated into<br>
CD4+CD45RBhigh and CD4+CD45RBlow populations by two-color sorting on a Moflo<br>
(Dakocytomation). The CD45RBhigh and CD45RBlow populations were defined as the brightest<br>
staining 40% and the dullest staining 20% of CD4+ cells respectively. 5 x 105 cells were then<br>
injected i.p. into C.B-17 scid mice on day 0 and the development of colitis was monitored<br>
through the appearance of soft stools or diarrhoea and weight loss. Bone mineral density<br>
measurements were taken at the termination of the study (day 88).<br>
Effect of anti-Sclerostin treatment on colitis symptoms and BMP<br>
Ab-A IgG was dosed at 10mg/kg s.c. from the day prior to CD4+CD45RBhigh cell<br>
transfer and compared with mice which received the negative control antibody 101.4 also dosed<br>
at lOmg/kg s.c. The antibodies were dosed weekly thereafter. A group of mice which received<br>
non-pathogenic CD4+CD45RBlow cells and were dosed with 10mg/kg 101.4 was studied as a<br>
control. At the termination of the study (day 88) the bone mineral density was measured and<br>

sections of the colon taken for analysis of cell infiltration and assessment of histological<br>
damage.<br>
a)	No effect on colitis symptoms<br>
Typical colitis symptoms such as weight loss and infiltration of inflammatory<br>
cells into the colon were unaffected by treatment with Ab-A. Similarly there was no<br>
improvement of histological damage to the colon after treatment with Ab-A.<br>
b)	Inhibition of inflammation-induced loss of bone mineral density.<br>
On day 88 after transfer of cells into C.B-17 scid mice, the bone mineral density<br>
was measured (total BMD, vertebrae BMD and femur BMD). In comparison to control mice<br>
which received CD4+CD45RBlow non-pathogenic cells, mice which received CD4+ CD45RBhigh<br>
T cells and the negative control antibody 101.4 had reduced bone mineral density, as shown in<br>
Figure 25. In contrast, no reduction in BMD was noted after treatment with Ab-A. Total,<br>
vertebrae and femur measurements of BMD were significantly higher in mice receiving CD4+<br>
CD45RBhigh T cells and treated with Ab-A than mice receiving CD4+ CD45RBhigh T cells and<br>
treated with 101.4 (P

KINEXA-BASED DETERMINATION OF AFFINITY (KD) OF ANTI-SCLEROSTIN ANTIBODIES FOR HUMAN<br>
SCLEROSTIN<br>
The affinity of several anti-sclerostin antibodies to human sclerostin was assessed by a solut-<br>
equilibrium binding analysis using KinExA® 3000 (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, ID). For thes<br>
measurements, Reacti-Gel 6x beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were pre-coated with 40 µg/ml human<br>
sclerostin in 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6 at 4°C overnight. The beads were then blocked with 1 mg/m<br>
BSA in 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 4°C for two hours. 10 pM, 30 pM, or 100 pM of the antibody was<br>
mixed with various concentrations of human sclerostin, ranging in concentration from 0.1 pM to 11<br>
and equilibrated at room temperature for over 8 hours in PBS with 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 0.005% P2(<br>
The mixtures were then passed over the human sclerostin coated beads. The amount of bead-bounc<br>
anti-sclerostin antibody was quantified using fluorescent Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse-IgG or<br>
fluorescent Cy5-labeled goat anti-human-IgG antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove,<br>
for the mouse or human antibody samples, respectively. The amount of fluorescent signal measure<br>
was proportional to the concentration of free anti-sclerostin antibody in each reaction mixture at<br>

BLACORE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE AFFINITY OF HUMANISED ANTI-SCLEROSTIN ANTIBODIES<br>
FOR HUMAN SCLEROSTIN.<br>
The BIAcore technology monitors the binding between biomolecules in real time and<br>
without the requirement for labelling. One of the interactants, termed the ligand, is either	:<br>
immobilised directly or captured on the immobilised surface while the other, termed die analyte,<br>
flows in solution over the captured surface. The sensor detects the change in mass on the sensor<br>
surface as the analyte binds to the ligand to form a complex on the surface. This corresponds to<br>
the association process. The dissociation process is monitored when the analyte is replaced by<br>
buffer. In the affinity BIAcore assay, the ligand is the anti-sclerostin antibody and the analyte is<br>
sclerostin.<br>

Assay Method<br>
The assay format was capture of the anti-sclerostin antibody by immobilised anti-human IgG-Fc<br>
then titration of the sclerostin over the captured surface.<br>
An example of the procedure is given below:<br>
BIA (Biamolecular Interaction Analysis) was performed using a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB).<br>
Affinipure F(ab')2 Fragment goat anti-human IgG, Fc fragment specific (Jackson<br>
ImmunoResearch) was immobilised on a CM5 Sensor Chip via amine coupling chemistry to a<br>
capture level of ~4000 response units (RUs). HBS-EP buffer (10mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M<br>
NaCl, 3 mM EPTA, 0.005 % Surfactant P20, BIAcore AB) containing 1 mg/mL CM-Dextran<br>
was used as the running buffer with a flow rate of 10 µl/min, A 10 µl injection of the anti-<br>
sclerostin antibody at ~5 µg/mL was used for capture by the immobilised anti-human IgG-Fc.<br>
Antibody capture levels were typically 100-200 RU. Sclerostin was titrated over the captured<br>
anti-sclerostin antibody at various concentrations at a flow rate of 30 µL/min. The surface was<br>
regenerated by two 10 µL, injections of 40 mM HC1, followed by a 5 µL injection of 5 mM<br>
NaOH at a flowrate of 10µL/min.<br>
Background subtraction binding curves were analysed using the BIAevaluation software<br>
(version 3.2) following standard procedures. Kinetic parameters were determined from the<br>
fitting algorithm.<br>
The kinetic data and calculated dissociation constants are given in Table 2.<br>

IN VIVO TESTING OF ANTI-SCLEROSTIN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES IN CYNOMOLGOUS MONKEYS<br>
Thirty-three, approximately 3-5 year old, female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca<br>
fascicularis) were used in this 2- month study. The study contained 11 groups:<br>
Group 1: vehicle (N=4)<br>
Group 2: Ab-23 (N=2, dose 3 mg/kg)<br>
Group 3: Ab-23 (N=3, dose 10 mg/kg)<br>
Group 4: Ab-23 (N=3, dose 30 mg/kg)<br>
Group 5: Ab-5 (N=3, dose 3 mg/kg)<br>
Group 6: Ab-5 (N=3, dose 10 mg/kg)<br>
Group 7: Ab-5 (N=3, dose 30 mg/kg)<br>
Group 8: Ab-14 (N=3, dose 3 mg/kg)<br>
Group 9: Ab-14 (N=3, dose 10 mg/kg)<br>
Group 10: Ab-14 (N=3, dose 30 mg/kg)<br>
Group 11: Parathyroid Hormone (1-34) [PTH (1-34)] (N=3, dose 10 ug/kg)<br>
All dosing was subcutaneous. PTH (1-34) was dosed everyday, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs)<br>
were dosed twice (first dose at the beginning of the study and second dose at the one month time<br>
point). For assessment of bone parameters (e.g. bone mineral density) pQCT (peripheral<br>
quantitative computed tomography) and DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans were<br>
performed prior to the beginning of the study (to obtain baseline values) and after a month (prior<br>
to the second dose of Mab) and finally at the end of the study (2-month time point) at which<br>
point the monkeys were necropsied for further analysis (e.g. histomorphometric analysis).<br>
Animals were fiuorochrome labeled (days 14,24, 47, and 57) for dynamic histomorphometry.<br>
Serum was collected at various time points during the study [day 1 pre-dose (the day of the first<br>
Mab dose), day 1 twelve hours post-dose, day 2, day 3, day 5, day 7, day 14, day 21, day 28, day<br>
29 twelve hours post-dose (day 29 was the day of the second and final Mab dose), day 30, day<br>
31, day 33, day 35, day 42, day 49 and day 56].<br>
Three bone-related serum biomarkers were measured using commercially available kits:<br>
Osteocalcin (OCD (DSL Osteocalcin Radioimmunoassay Kit; Diagnostic Systems Laboratories,<br>
Inc.,Webster,TX,USA)<br>
N-terminal Propeptide of Type 1 Procollagen (P1NP) (PINP Radioimmunoassay Kit; Orion<br>

C-telopeptide fragments  of collagen type I al chains (sCTXD (Serum CrossLaps® ELISA;<br>
Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S, Herlev, Denmark).<br>
pQCT and DXA scans yielded data on various bone parameters (including bone<br>
mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content) across numerous skeletal sites (including<br>
tibial metaphysis and diaphysis, radial metaphysis and diaphysis, femur neck, lumbar vertebrae).<br>
Analysis of this bone data (percent change from baseline for each animal) and the anabolic (OC,<br>
P1NP) serum biomarker data (percent change from baseline for each animal) revealed<br>
statistically significant increases, versus the vehicle group, in some parameters at some of the<br>
time points and doses for each Mab. This bone parameter data, serum biomarker data, as well as<br>
the histomorphometric data, indicated that each of the 3 Mabs (Ab-23, Ab-5 and Ab-14) was<br>
able to neutralize sclerostin in cynomolgous monkeys. This activity was most robust for Ab-23<br>
and Ab-5, particularly at the highest dose (30 mg/kg), with a clear increase in bone formation<br>
(anabolic effect) as well as net gains in bone (e.g. BMD). Statistically significant increases in<br>
bone parameters and anabolic histomorphometric parameters were also found for the positive<br>
control group (PTH (1-34)).<br>
Serum bone formation markers (P1NP, osteocalcin) were increased (p
vehicle (VEH)) at various time points and doses, but particularly in the 30 mg/kg groups for Ab-<br>
23 and Ab-5. Histomorphometric analysis revealed dramatic increases (p
formation rates in cancellous bone at lumbar vertebra and proximal tibia (up to 5-fold increase),<br>
as well as at the endocortical surface of the femur midshaft (up to 10-fold increase) at the higher<br>
doses of Ab-23 and Ab-5. Trabecular thickness was increased with high dose Ab-23 and Ab-5<br>
in lumbar vertebrae (&gt;60%, p
change from baseline, was increased (p
23, 30 mg/kg), and lumbar vertebrae (Ab-5, 30 mg/kg). The increases in areal BMD at the<br>
lumbar vertebrae were accompanied by increases in vertebral strength (97% increase in vertebral<br>
maximal load for Ab-23, 30 mg/kg; p
prior to Mab dosing were statistically similar across all groups. In summary, short-term<br>
administration of sclerostin-neutralizing Mabs in cynomolgous monkeys resulted, in part, in<br>
increases in bone formation, BMD and vertebral bone strength.<br>
From the foregoing, although specific embodiments of the invention have been<br>
