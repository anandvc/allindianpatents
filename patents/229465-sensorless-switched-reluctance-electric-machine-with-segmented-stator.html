				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to electric machines and, more particularly to<br>
sensorless switched reluctance electric machines including segmented staters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Reluctance electric machines, such as motors and generators,<br>
typically include a stator that is mounted inside a machine housing and a rotor that is<br>
supported for rotation relative to the stator. Reluctance electric machines produce<br>
torque as a result of the rotor tending to rotate to a position that minimizes the<br>
reluctance (or maximizes the inductance) of the magnetic circuit The reluctance is<br>
minimized (and the inductance is maximized) when the salient rotor poles are aligned<br>
with the energized salient stator poles. A drive circuit generates a set of stator<br>
winding currents that are output to the stator pole windings and that create a<br>
magnetic field. The rotor rotates in response to the magnetic field. In synchronous<br>
reluctance electric machines, the windings are energized at a controlled frequency.<br>
In switched reluctance electric machines, the drive circuit and/or transducers detect<br>
the angular position of the rotor. The drive circuit energizes the stator windings as a<br>
function of the sensed rotor position. The design and operation of switched<br>
reluctance electric machines is known in the art and is discussed in T.J.E. Miller,<br>
"Switched Reluctance Motors and Their Control", Magna Physics Publishing and<br>
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0003] Conventional switched reluctance electric machines generally<br>
include a stator with a sold stator core or a laminated stator. The laminated stator<br>
includes a plurality of circular stator plates that are punched from a magnetically<br>
conducting material. The stator includes pairs of diametrically opposed stator poles<br>
that project radially inward. The rotor also includes pairs of diametrically opposed<br>
rotor poles. Windings or coils are typically disposed about the stator poles. The<br>
windings that are wound around any two diametrically opposed stator poles are<br>
connected in series or in parallel to define a machine phase or a phase coil.<br>
[0004] By passing current through the phase coil, magnetic fields are<br>
established about the stator poles and torque is produced as the energized phase<br><br>
ooil attracts a pair of rotor poles into alignment. The current in the phase coils to<br>
generated in a predetermined sequence to create the magnetic field that produce<br>
continuos rotating torque on the<br>
to the phase coil is known as the active stage. At a predermined point, either as<br>
the rotor poles become aligned with the stator poles or el sons point prior thereto,<br>
the current in the phase coil is commulated to prevent braking torque from acting on<br>
the rotor poles. Ones the commutation point is reached, the oorrent is switched to<br>
another phase col. During the inactive stage, the current is slowed to classipate from<br>
the phase coil.<br>
[0005] In order to maintain torque on the rotor, it is important to maintain<br>
the Proper relationship between the possition of the rotor and the active stage of each<br>
machine phase.If the active is initialed and/or commmulated early or too<br>
late with respect to the position of the rotor, the torque on to rotor will vary and/or<br>
fee machine will not operate at optimum efficiency.<br>
[0006] The drive circuits of conventtonai switched reluctants electric<br>
machine control the current in the phase cob. The drive circuits maintain the<br>
proper relationship between the active stage of the machine phases and the position <br>
of the rotor by continously sensing rotor position. There are two distinct appreance<br>
for detecting the angular position of the rotor, In a "sansar" approach, an external<br>
physical sensor senses the angular position of the rotor. For example, a rotor<br>
position transducer (RPT) with a half effect sensor or an optical sensor physically<br>
sense the angular position of the rotor. In a "sensorless"approach,electronics that<br>
are associated with the drive circut derive the angular rotor position without an<br>
externed physical sensor.<br>
[0007] Them are many problems that are associated won switched<br>
relutance electric machines that employ the sensed approach. The RPT typically<br>
includes a sensor board with one or mors sensors and a shuttre that is coupled to<br>
and rotates with the shaft of the rotor. The shutter includes a plurality of shutter teeth<br>
that pass through optical sensors as the rotor rotates- Becauae the angular rotor<br>
position is critical to proper operation, sophisticated alignment<br>
ensure that the sensor board of the RPT is properly positioned with respect to the<br>
housing and the stator. Missalignment of the sensor board la (mown to degrade the<br>
performance of the electric machine. Unfortunately, utilization of these complex<br>
alignment techniques increases the manufacturing costs for switched reluctance<br>
eiectric machines equipped wtth RPTs.<br><br>
[0008] The RPTs also increase the overall size of the switched reluctance<br>
electric machine, which can adversely impact machine and product packaging<br>
requirements. The coats of the RPTs often place switched reluctance electric<br>
machines at a competitive disadvantage in applications that are suitable for open<br>
loop induction motors that do not require RPTs. Another drawback with RPTs<br>
Invokes field servicing of the switched reluctance electric machines. Specifically<br>
wear elements, such as me bearings, that are located within the enclosed rotor<br>
housing may need to be repaired or replaced To reach the wear oiornsnts. an end<br>
shield must be removed from the housing. Because alignment of the sensor board is<br>
critical, replacement of the end shield often requires the use of complex realignment<br>
techniques.When the aliognment techniques are improperly performed by the <br>
technician. the sensor board is misaligned and the motor's performence is adversely<br>
impacted.<br>
[0008] Various methods for dkepensty with the RPT have been proposed. <br>
several of these are reviewed in "Seneorless Methods for Determining the Rotor<br>
Position of Switched Reluctance Motors" by W F %Ray and IH Al Bahadly, published<br>
in the proceeding of The European Power Electronics Conferance, Brighton,UK,<br>
13-16 Sep 1993. VbL 6, pp 7-13, hereby incorporated by reference. Many of these<br>
methods propoeed for toe rotor position estimation use the measurement of phase<br>
flux-inkage (i.e. the integral of applied voltage with respect to time) and current in<br>
one or more phasee. Position is calculated using knowledge of the variation in<br>
inductance of Ihe machine as a function of angle and currant The storage of this<br>
data Involves the use of a large memory array and/or additional system overheads<br>
for interpolation of data between stored points.<br>
[0010] In U. S. Patent Nos. 6.777,416 to Kolomeitsev, 6,011,368 to<br>
Katoatol et at, and 6.107.772 to Uu et at, which are Incorporated by reference, a<br>
drive circuit measures the dee time of current in a ststor wincing between two<br>
predetermined current levels. The drive circuit calculates the inductance of the<br>
phase col from the current dee time. The drive oka* estimates toe angular position<br>
of the rotor from the inductaanc of the phase coil.The drive circuit adjusts the active<br>
stage of the phase art based on the rotor position. OS. Pat Noc 5,962,117 to<br>
Taylor et at. and 5383.485 to MeWhom, which are incorporated by reference,<br>
likewise monitor current in unenergtod windings to determine the inductance of the<br>
phase coil and toe position of the rotor. In U.S. Pat No. 4.772,839 to MacMinn,<br>
which is incorporated by reference, a drive circuit simultaneously measures changes<br><br>
in the currant in two unwonted phases. The drive circuit derives rotor position<br>
estimates for each phase and combines the rotor position estimates into a combined<br>
(0011] Some methods make use of this data at low speeds where<br>
"choping"current control is the dominant control strategy for varying the developed<br>
torque. These methods usually employ diagnontic.<br>
productive phases (i.e. those phases which are not energized directly from the power<br>
supply at a particular moment). A method suited to low-speed operation to proposed<br>
by N M Mvungr and J M tephenson in 'Accurate Sensorless Rotor Position<br>
Detection in a S R Motor", published in Proceeding of the European Power<br>
Eectronics Conference, Frenze. Itely. 1991, Vol. 1, pp 390-393, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[0012] In U.S. Pat No. 4,959,596 to MacMinn, at al., which is incorporated<br>
by reference, a drive circuit employs a phase inductanee sensing technique to<br>
indirectly estimate rotor position. Voltage sensing pulses are output to an unexcited<br>
phase. The voltage sensing pulses cause a change in phase current that inversely<br>
proportional to the instantanneous phase inductance. Cornmutation time is<br>
determined by comprising the change in phase current to a threshold current U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5V589.518 to Vilunic which is incorporated by reference, also discloses a<br>
drive circuit that employs diagnostic pulses.<br>
[0013] Other methods employ the 'singls-pulse" mode of energization at<br>
higher speeds. The current and inductance waveforms, over a phase inductance<br>
period, are morror ikages of the monitoring waveforms.These methods monitor me<br>
operating voltages and currants of an active phase without interfering with normal<br>
operation. A typical higher speed method to desribed in OS. Patent No. 5,173,650<br>
to Hedlund,which is hereby incorporated by referance .<br>
[0014] Both the chopping and single-pulse modes described above are<br>
normally used whan the converter apptfee a feed value of supply voltage to the<br>
phase windings. A further control strategy is the pulse width modulated (PWM)<br>
mods, where one or more switches are switched rapidly to effectively produce a<br>
supply vottage that is proportional to the duty cycle of me PWM waveform. This<br>
allows the use of single-pulse current waveforms at much lower speeds than would<br>
be possible on the full supply voltage. The current waveform is made up of a large<br>
number of segments, carrespondng to the current carried by the switches and<br>
diodes respectfully.<br><br><br>
[0015] Having to store a two-dimensional array of machine data in order to<br>
operate without a position sensor is an obvious disadvantage. Alternative methods<br>
have been proposed, which avoid the need for the majority of angularly referenced<br>
information and instead store data at one angle only. One such method described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,467,025 to Ray which is hereby incorporated by reference. This<br>
method senses the phase flux-linkage and currents a predefined angle by adjusting<br>
the diagnostic point via the calculated deviation away from a desired point Two one-<br>
dimentional tables are stored in the preferred embodiment, one of flux-linkage<br>
versus current at a referenced rotor angle and another of the deferential of flux-<br>
Iinkage with respect to rotor angle versus current By monitoring phase voltage and<br>
current, the deviation away from a predicted angle can be assessed, with the aid of<br>
the look-up tables. and system operation can be adjusted accordingly. However,<br>
such methods, although reducing the amount of information which has to be stored,<br>
still have to detect or compute the flux-limkage at a specific rotor angle and may be<br>
sensitive to repeatability or manufacturing tolerances to the machine.	t<br>
[0016] A similar approach is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,793,179 to<br>
Watkins, hereby incorported by reference, where the arrival of the rotor at the peak<br>
of the inductance profile is predicted and the system is then put into a freewheeling<br>
mode, during which the gradient of the current is measured. While this method<br>
works well in the absence of noise, it is not robust enough to disregard false readings<br>
produced by noise. Though the current waveform may be relatively immune to<br>
induced noise, a drive that uses a PWM voltage supply generates a noisy current<br>
waveform. The method disclosed by Watkins '179 also must be used with a<br>
converter circuit that is capable of freewheeling.<br>
[0017] Other attempts to overcome these deficiencies are described in"A<br>
New Rotor Position Estimation Method for Swsched ReJuctarwe Motors using PWM<br>
Voltage Control", by Gallegos-Lopez. G. Kjaer, PC &amp; Miller, TJE, in Proc EPE'97. 7th<br>
European Cont on Power Electronics and Applications, 8-10 Sept 1997, Trondheim,<br>
Norway, Vol. 3, pp 580-585, hereby incorporated by reference. This method<br>
continuously samples the current waveform and attempts to detect the change in<br>
gradient that is produced by the start of pole overlap and the consequent sudden rise<br>
in inductance of the phase. The basic method described by Gallegoe-Lopez el al<br>
involves detecting the point of pole overlap for monitoring (or pole separation for<br>
generating) by detecting the point where the rate of change of the current waveform,<br>
with respect to time, is zero. The detector includes a differentiator, a oomparator and<br><br>
a single shot multivibrator. The differentiator differentiates the current signal so that<br>
at the point of zero di/dt the differentiator output is zero. The comparator detects this<br>
zero output and tips state. The system does not require either stored magnetization<br>
data or an interval of freewhilling. The system does current feedback and does not<br>
work ratably in the presence of noise. Improvements to this system include samping<br>
and storage of over several intervals and interpolation to reduce the effects of false<br>
detection caused by noise.<br>
[0018] When seining the angular rotor position using the sensoriess<br>
approach, variations in the electrical characteristics of the individual stator pole<br>
windings can adversely impact the ability of the sensoriess drive circurts to correctly<br>
derive the angular position of the rotor. Most of the sensoriess approaches measure<br>
the resistance and/or inductance of the windings. If the resistance and/or inductance<br>
varies from one stator winning to <br>
derive the angular position of the rotor. This problem is made worse if the windings<br>
on the stator poles creep or move over time. When this occurs, the cross section of<br>
the stator winnings changes, which changes the inductance and resistance of the <br>
stator pole winding.<br>
[0019] There are several conventional methods for<br>
on the stator of a swiched reluctance electric machine. The wincing wire can be<br>
initially wound and transferred onto the stator poles. Transfer winding tends to leave<br>
excess winding wire or loops around axial ends of the stator poles. Transfer winding<br>
can typically utilize approximately 60-65% of available stator slot area. Needle<br>
wincing employs a needs that winds the wire directly on the stator poles. The<br>
needle, however, takes up some of the stator slot area, which reduces slot fill to<br>
approximately 50%. The positioning of winding wire on the stator poles using these<br>
methods varies from one stator pole to the next Winding creep and other assembly<br>
variations also impact the inductance and resistance of the winning wire over time,<br>
which makes it difficult to accurately perform "sensortess" control due to the non-<br>
conformity of the salient stator poles.<br>
(0020] While the design of switched reluctance electric machines is<br>
relatively mature, there are several areas requiring improvement Specifically, it is<br>
desirable to improve the uniformity of the electrical characteristics of the stator of<br>
switched reluctance electric machines. It is also desirable to eliminate the need for<br>
RPTs in switched reluctance electric machines to decrease the cost and to improve<br>
both durability and serviceability.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0021] A sensorises swithed reluctance electric machine according to the<br>
invention includes a rotor and a segmented stator having a plurality of stator segment<br>
assamblles. The stator segment assmbies define salient stator poles and inter-poler<br>
stator slots. Each of the stator segment assemblles includes <br>
winding wire that is wound around the stator segment core. The rotor defines a plurality<br>
of rotor poles. The rotor tends to rotate relative to the stator to a ratational position that<br>
maxizes the inductance of an energized winding. A sensorless drive circuit derives<br>
rotor position and energizes the warning wire around the stator segment aasembles<br>
based on the derived position of the rotor.<br>
[0022] According to other features of the invention, the atator segment core<br>
includes a plurality of stator passe. Each stator plate has an outer rim section and a<br>
tooth-shaped pole seofon. The stator segment assembles includs an end cap<br>
assembly that includes a pair of end caps that are secured to opposes ends of the<br>
stator segment core. A pair of retainer plates connect the end caps on opposite sides of<br>
the stator segment core. The end cap assembly defines an annular rention channel<br>
within which the winding wire is wound. The retention channel faciliates improved<br>
precision in the winding process and tends to reduce winding creep during use.<br>
[0023] By proving a segmented stator with the end cap assembly in the<br>
switched reluctance electric machine, the present invention improves the torque density<br>
of the switched reluctance electric machine. As a result, the torque output of the<br>
swashed reluctance electric machine can be increased and/or the dimensions of the<br>
switched reluctanoa atactic machine can be reduced tor a given torque output In<br>
addition, the satator segment assemblies can be manufactured with a greater electrical<br>
uniformity. The inductance and resistance of fhe individual stator segments and the<br>
stator are also more uniform. Ssneoriess techniques can be used more effecetively<br>
when the inductance and resistance characteristics of the atator are more uniform.<br>
Sensorless rotor posion sensing techniques lower the manufacturing costs of the<br>
switched reluctance electric machine when compared to sensed rotor position<br>
techniques and improve reliability and serviceability in the field.<br>
[0024] Other objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the<br>
specification, the claims and the drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0043] The following delailed description embodiments provides preferred exemplary<br>
embodiments only and is not intended to limt the scope, applicability or configuration<br>
of the present invention. Rather, the detailed description of the preferred exemplary <br>
embodiments will provide those sidlled in the art with an enabling description for<br>
implemnting the preferred exemplary embodiments of the persent invention. It will be<br>
understood that various changes may be mde in the function and f arrrranment of the<br>
elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the<br>
[0044] The stator of the switched reluctance etectric machine accoroing to<br>
the present invention has highly uniform electrical characteristics. The segmented<br>
stator and the end cap asseblyaccording to the invention allow more precise winding<br>
of the stator poles and retention of the winding during use.As a result of the more<br>
uniform electrical characteristics, sensorless measurement techniques for deriving<br>
rotor position can be employed more successfully. The sensorless switched<br>
reluctance machine can be manufactured at a lower cost with improved reliaability and<br>
serviceability.<br>
[0045] referring now to FIG.1, a sensorless drive circiut 10 is connected to a<br>
switched reluctance electric machine 12. The sensorless drive circuit 10 derives the<br>
position of the rotor in a sensorless manner, In other words, tha sensorless drive<br>
circuit 10 lacks a physical sensor such as the RPT. The sensorless drive circuit 10<br>
includes an application specific integarted circuit (ASIC), a controller, a processor,<br>
memory (such as read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash<br>
memory, etc.), hardwired circuitry, and/or combination thereof.<br>
[0046] Referring now to FIG. 2, a sensoless drive circuit 10-1 includes a<br>
commutating circuit 14, a lookup table 16, a current sensor 18, and a flux sensor 20.<br>
The sensorless drive circuit 10-1 senses the phase frux-linkage and current at a<br>
predefined angle using the current sensor 18 and the flux eensor 20. Two one-<br>
dimensional tables are stored in the lookup table 16. By monitoring phase voltage and<br>
current, the deviation away from a pricted angle can be assweed with the and of the<br>
lookup table and system operation can be adjusted accordingly.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIGs. 3A and 3B, a sensorless drive circuit 10-2<br>
includes a commulating circuit 22, a current sensor 24, a slope calculating drouft 26,<br>
and a stope storage circuit 2a As can be seen to RG. 38, aa the rotor pole<br>
approaches the stator pole with an energized stator winding..CUrrent increases to a<br><br>
maximum value that occurs when the leading edge of the rotor tooth is aligned with<br>
the trailing edge of the stator pole. By monitoring the slope of the current as it<br>
transitions from a positive value to zero to a negative value, the position of the rotor<br>
pole can be identified.<br>
[0048] reffering now to FIG. 4A, a sensorless drive circuit 10-3 includes an<br>
inductance measuring circuit 30, a rotor position determining circuit 32, and a<br>
commulating circuit 34. As can be seen in FIG.4B,the inductance of the machine with<br>
its phase cols varies front a minimum to a maximum value as a function of angular<br>
rotor position. The senaodess drive circuit 10-3 employs this property when deriving<br>
the position of the rotor. The Inductance of the machine with its phase cols varies in<br>
approximatly Iinear fashion between the maximum and minimum idcuctance values.<br>
Using the relationship set forth in FIG.4B,the rotor position to determine<br>
angular position of the rotor and employs the rotor position to determine the<br>
commulating timing of the phase coils.<br>
[0040] The inductance measuring circuit 30 measures the inductance of one<br>
or more unenergized phase coils. The rotor position determining circuit 32 derives the<br>
angular position of the rotor based on the inductance measurement and outouts rotor<br>
position signal to the commuting circuit 34. The commulatating circuit 34 calculates the<br>
optimum commulation angle to deenergize one or more coils and to energize one or<br>
more other phase cols based in part on the derived rotor position signal<br>
[0050] Referring now to HG. 5, a sensorless drive circuit 10-4 for the<br>
sensoriess switched reluctance electric machine 12 includes a putse generator 52, a<br>
sensing circuit 54, a rotor position estimating <br>
The rotor position eatlrnafing drcuit 56 triggers the pulse generator 52 to output<br>
diagnostic pulses to one or more phase cote of the sensorless switched reluctance<br>
electric machine 12. The sensing circuit 54 senses changes in the phase cument of<br>
the phase coil and outputs a phase current change signal to the rotor position<br>
estimating circuit 58. The rotor position estimating circuit 56 derives the angular rotor<br>
position from the sensed phase current change signal and outputs a rotor position<br>
signal to the commulating circuit 58. The commulating circuit 58 determines the<br>
optimum angle to de-energize one or more phase coils and to energize one or more<br>
other phase coils.<br>
[0051] As can be appreciated by skilled artisans, other sensoriess drive<br>
circuits may be employed. For example, the specific sensoriess drive circuits set forth<br>
in the U.S. Patents that are identified above may be employed. The switched<br><br>
reluctance electric machine ,that is a set forth in moredetail below, is particularly suitable<br>
for sensorless operation due to its uniform electrical characteristics.<br>
[0062] Referring now to the remaining drawings, the sensorless switched<br>
reluctance machine 12 is shown to include a housing 112, a segmented stator 114<br>
mounted in the housing 112, and a rotor 118 supported for rotation rotative to the<br>
segmnted stator 114.In accordance with the present invention,the segmented<br>
114 includes a plurality of stator segment asset rites 118 that can be individually<br>
assembled and subsequently combined with additional stator segment assemblies to<br>
provide the segmanted stator 114. As wilt be detailed, each stator segment assembly<br>
118 includes a stator segment core 120, an end cap assembly 122, and winding wire<br>
124 that is wound around the stator segment core 120 and the end cap assembly 122.<br>
The end cap assembly 122 insulates the ends of the stator segment core 120 and<br>
provides retention for additional turns of the winding wire 124.<br>
[0063] Preferring prirmarlly to FIGs. 6, 7A and 78, the stator aegment core<br>
120 iicludae a sold core or a slack of individual stator plates 126. Each stator ptate<br>
126 includes an outer rim section 128 and a tooth-ehapedpoto section 130. An outer<br>
edge surface 132 of the outer rim section 128 is shaped for mounting to a/i imer wafl<br>
surface 134 of the housing 112. Each outer rim section 128 has a tongue projection<br>
136 formed on one edge surface 138 and a groove 140 on Is opposes edge surface<br>
142. This tongue and groove arrangement helps align the stator segment helps align the<br>
during manufacturing. Because the stator segment assemblies are press fit or hot<br>
dropped into the housing, the tongue and groove arrangement can be omitted. Each<br>
pole section 130 of the stator plates 126 has an arcuate inner edge surface 144 and a<br>
pair of circumferencially-xtending projections 146.<br>
[0054] As previously mentioned, the stator segment core 120 to defined by a<br>
plurality of stator plates 126 that are stacked together. The stator plates 126 are die<br>
cut from thin sheets of magnetically conductive material. During the die cutting<br>
operation, a first pair of ate 150 are cut into the outer rim section 120 end a second<br>
pair of slits 152 are cut into toe pole section 130 and central portions between the slits<br>
are deformed. The ate 150 are transverse in alignment relative to the ete 152. The<br>
stator plates 126 that form the stator segment core 120 are stacked and press fit This<br>
operation results in the stator plates 126 being releasably interconnected to define the<br>
stator segment core 120.<br>
[0055] The rotor 116 is shown to include a circular rim section 154 and a<br>
plurality of tooth-shaped pole sections 156 that project radially from toe rim section<br><br>
154. A circular bore 158 is formed in the rotor 116 and may include keyways 160. A<br>
rotor shaft (not shown) is received by the circular bore 156 of the rotor 116. In the<br>
particular embodiment shown, the rotor 116 has eight equaly-spaced rotor pole<br>
sections 156 and the segmented stator 114 has twelve eaually-spaced pole sections<br>
130. other rotor pole and stator pole combinations one also contemplated. In addition,<br>
each rotor pole section 156 has an arcuate outer edge surface 162 that defines an at<br>
gap 163 with respect to its arcuate Inner edge surface 144 on the pole sections 130 of<br>
the stator segment core 120.<br>
0056]referrong to FIG.7B,tooth width W1, projection with W2, and stator<br>
pole arc Bs are shown. As a result of segmenting the stator, the designer of the<br>
switched reluctance electric machine has gerater flexibility in designing the dimensions<br>
of the stator segment assembles. The slot opening dimension between radially Inner<br>
ends of the stator teeth restricts the projection width W2 when needle and transfer<br>
wiving method are employed This restriction is eliminated when the segmented<br>
stator assemblies are employed because the stator teeth can be wound individually<br>
before being assembled Into the stator.<br>
[0057] The tooth width W1 determmines the magnetic flux denaity in the stator<br>
tooth and how much area is available for winding wire in the inter-polar stator slot. The<br>
designer of the switched reluctnce electric machine can select the tooth witdh W1 so<br>
that it is sufficient to accomodate the maximum anticipated magnetic flux in the stator<br>
poles, but is not wider than necessary. By optimizing the tooth width W1, the slot area<br>
is increased, which slows additional winding wire. By increasing the current carrying<br>
capacity of the windings without causing overheating, the torque density of the<br>
switched reluctance electric machine can be improved. The design of the stator plates<br>
also depends on other factors such as the type of steel that is selected,the axial length<br>
of the stator stack, the opening speed, the overall size of the motor, and the desired<br>
magnetic flux density in the stator teeth.<br>
[0068] Referring to FIG. 8, the stator segment assembly 118 is shown fully<br>
assembled to include the stator segment core 120, the end cap assembly 122 and the<br>
winding wire 124. The end cap assembly 122 is made from magnetically peomeable<br>
material and includes a first end cap 164A, a second end cap 164B and a pair of<br>
elongated winding retainer section 166A and 166B. The first end cap 164A is located<br>
at one end of the stator segment core 120 and the second end cap 1648 to located at<br>
the opposite end of the stator segment core 120. The winding retainer sections 166A<br>
and 166B interconnect the first and second end caps 164A and 164B and are located<br><br>
adjacent to the projections 146 near the racially inner end of the pole sections 130 of<br>
the stator segment core 120. Preferably, the end cape 164A and 1848 are similar in<br>
configuration. Likewise, it is preferable that the retainer sections 166A and 166B are<br>
similar in configuration. Snap-in connections are contamplated for connecting the<br>
opposite ends of each retainer section 166A and 166B to the end caps 164A and<br>
164B. Additionally, it is contamplated that adhesives are used for bonding the end<br>
caps 164A and 1648 to the opposite ends of the stator segment core 120 and the<br>
retainer sections to aides of the stator segment core 120. The end caps 164A and<br>
164B and the retainer sections 166A and 166B can also be molded as an integral end<br>
cap assembly 122, Since the first end cap 164A is similar to the second end cap<br>
164B, the following description of the components will use reference numerals with an<br>
"A" suffix for the first end cap 164A and the reference numerals for similar components<br>
of the second end cap 164B will be identical with a"B" suffix.<br>
[0059] Terminals 170 and 172 are shown in FIGs. 8 and 10A to be mounted<br>
in slots 174 and 176 (FIG. 10C) formed in an end surface 178A of the first end cap<br>
164A. One end of the winding wire of 124 is connecred to the first terminal 170 while an<br>
opposite end of the waving wire 124 is connected to the second terminal 172.<br>
Insulating malarial 177 is shown to be positioned to cover winding wire 124 on both<br>
lateral sides of stator oore 120, The insulating meterial 177 is also positioned (but not<br>
shown) between the stator segment core 120 and the winding wire 124.<br>
[0060] Referring to FIG. 9, the sensorless drive circuit 10 is shown<br>
connected vie connecting wires 162,184 and 186 tom a printed circuit board 188. The<br>
printed circus board 186 is circular and has a plurality of radially outwardly projecting<br>
terminal pads 190. Each terminal pad 190 has conductive terminal slots 192 and 194<br>
arranged to accept installation of the terminals 170 and 172 for each stator segment<br>
assembly 118.<br>
[0061] To more dearly illustrate the structure of the end cap assembly 122,<br>
FIG. 10A shows the stator segment assembly 118 prior to the winding wire 124 being<br>
wound thereon. The first end cap 164A incfudee an outer section 196A and an inner<br>
section 200A interconnected by a hub section 202A. all defining a common faoe<br>
surface 204A. The face surfece 204A abuts and is boridsd to an axial end surface 206<br>
of the stator segment oore 120. Similarty, the face surface 2048 of second end cap<br>
164B abuts and is bonded to an end surface 208 of the stator segment core 120.<br>
When the first end cap 164A is secured to the stator segment oore 120, its outer<br>
section 198A extends sightly radially inward with respect to the outer rim section 128 <br><br>
and is parallel to the outer rim section 128. The hub section 202A is signed with pole<br>
section 130 and the inner section 200A is aligned with and extends laterally beyond the<br>
inner edge surface 144 and the projections 146. A similar alignment is provided when<br>
the second end cap 164B is secured to the opposte end surface 206 of the stator<br>
segment core 120. Moreoverr, the width of the sections 202A and 202B is less than or<br>
equal to the width of the pole sections 130 of the stator segment core 120. The<br>
opposte ends of the retainer sections 166A and 1668 are connected to the face<br>
surfaces 204A and 2048 of the end caps 164A and 1648. respectively, adjacent to<br>
their inner sections 200A and 200B. As such, the end cap assembly 122 defines a<br>
continuous annular channel within which the winding wire 124 can be precisely<br>
installed and maintained.<br>
[0062] FIG.10B shows the innner section 200A of the first endcap 164Aand<br>
the inner section 2008 of the second end cap 184B to be rectangular to shape. It is<br>
contemplated, however, that other configurations (i.e. semi-circular, square, tapered,<br>
etc) could be used. As a further option, the retainer sections 166A and 168B could be<br>
provided as a cantilevered section that is irtegrally fomed win the end caps 164A or<br>
1648 and adapted for connection to the inner section of the opposite end cap. To<br>
reduce the weight of the end cap assembly 122 or to make the molding process easier,<br>
lateral axial grooves 210 and a central axial groove 212 can be formed on the outer<br>
section of the end cape 164A and 164B. Likewise, a cavity 214 can also be formed to<br>
provide additional weight reduction or to make the molding process easier.<br>
[0063] Referring now to FIG3s. 11A, 11B and 11C, an alternative cap<br>
assembly 222 is shown for connection to the stator segment core 120 and supporting<br>
the winding wire 124. Reference numerals from FlGs. 10A, 10B and IOC will be used<br>
where appropriate to identify similar elements. Specifically, the first end cap 224A is<br>
generally simitar to the first end cap 164A. The alternative end cap assembly 222<br>
includes an additional pari of retainer of retainer sections. An outer retainer section 226A extends<br>
axially from the common face surface 204A adjacent to the outer section 196A for<br>
connection to the outer section 196B of the second endcap 224a An outer retainer<br>
section 226B likewise extends axially from its common face surface 204B for<br>
connection to common face surface 204A of first end cap 224A. The outer retainer<br>
sections 226A and 2268 provide additional support for the end cap assembly 122. The<br>
outer retainer sections 226A and 2268 fill the arcuate inner edge 230 of the outer rim<br>
section 128. As a result, a substantially right angle projection to pote section 130 is<br>
formed. The outer retainer sections allow more precise control of the winding and<br><br>
minizes damage that may be caused by a sharp edge defined by inner edge 230<br>
and the edge surface 138 and 142. The outer rattier section 226A and 2268 have<br>
a tepered profile to male with the profile of inner arcuate wall surfaces 230 (FIG.7A) of<br>
the outer rim secfion 128.<br>
[0064] As can be appreciated from the foregeing, the sensorless switched<br>
reluctancs machine according to the invention has improved torqus density due to the<br>
segmented stator and the pradisely wound stotor segment assmeblies. The stator<br>
segment assemblies in the electric machine can be produced with a greater electrical<br>
uniformity and with lower varitions in inductance and resistance, As a result,<br>
sensorless rotor position sensing techniques can be employed more effectively, which<br>
dramatically lowers the manufacturing costs and improves rliability and serviceability<br>
in the field. Because the manufacturing tolerance of the stator segments have been<br>
improved, less costly sensorless drive circuit can be employed and/or more accurate<br>
control can be achieved. In addtion, the end cap assemblies acording to the<br>
invention prevent winding creep and further hato improve the electrical uniformity of the<br>
stator segment assemblies during use.<br>
[0065] Those sidlled in the art can now appeciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachinge of the present invention can be implemented in a<br>
variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in connection<br>
with particaular examples thereof, the true eoope of the invention should not be so<br>
limited since other modafication will becoms apparent to the sidlled practitioner upon<br>
