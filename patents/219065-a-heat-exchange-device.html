The present invention relates to improvements made<br>
to fib rising booths intended for the fabrication of<br>
glass filaments. It will he recalled that a fiberisdng<br>
booth is, in a way known per se, made up of at least<br>
one bushing pierced with a plurality of holes through<br>
which molten gla3s flows to form a web of glass<br>
filaments.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is aimed<br>
at a heat exchanger device designed to be positioned<br>
underneath the bottom of the bushing the latter being<br>
itself situated within the fiberizing booth.<br>
Now, operating a fiberising booth is actually a<br>
particularly complex process in the course of which<br>
numerous physico-chemical parameters are constantly<br>
monitored, in this respect, it is pointed out in<br>
particular that the temperature at the bottom of the<br>
bushing is one of the most important parameters in<br>
obtaining an optimum filament as it is actually this<br>
that governs the viscosity of the glass.<br>
To this end, it is therefore necessary to cool the<br>
underside of the bushing so as to set the temperature<br>
of the cones of glass fibers.<br>
Furthermore; other phenomena influence the<br>
temperature of the cone of filaments and require the<br>
incorporation of heat exchanger devices underneath the<br>
bottom of the bushing.<br>
Thus, in a fiberizing booth, the movement of the<br>
filaments carries along the air trapped in the web<br>
toward the outside of the booth, anil this causes air to<br>
be sucked from the outside toward the inside of the web<br>
underneath the bottom of the bushing. It is necessary<br>
to supply fresh air to compensate for this lack of air<br>
underneath the bottom of the bushing so as to ensure<br>
uniform heat exchange with the glass cones and the<br>
bottom of the bushing, thus making it possible to<br>
improve the uniformity of the filament thickness.<br>
A first family of known heat exchanger devices<br>
which are able to influence the temperature at the<br><br>
-2-<br>
bottom of the bushing but do not perform the air supply<br>
function consists of an array of fins farming combs.<br>
Each of the fins is made of a bar made of a material<br>
with excellent heat exchange coefficients (particularly<br>
in terms of conduction}, one of the free ends of each<br>
bar being connected to a manifold secured to the<br>
fiberizing booth at the underside at the bushing and<br>
provided with a heat transfer circuit thus allowing the<br>
heat energy extracted by conduction to be taken away,<br>
the glass filaments passing between the gaps at the<br>
comb.<br>
Although, it meets the current requirements in<br>
terms of the Cooling of the underside of the bushing,<br>
this first family of devices cannot be read across to<br>
bushings with a high throughput. Problems associated<br>
with the geometry of the fiberiaing booths (the<br>
dimensions of the area of the booth intended to<br>
accommodate the bushing are set by construction) make<br>
it difficult to envisage mounting these devices on<br>
bushings comprising a great many (several thousand]<br>
orifices, this problem being all the more exacerbated<br>
when, in addition, additional air needs to be supplied,<br>
something that is essential in high-throughput<br>
bushings.<br>
Also known is a second family of heat exchanger<br>
devices which perform both the function of cooling the<br>
cone of glass and the function of supplying air. These<br>
are blowing fins. The latter are also configured as a<br>
comb and situated underneath the bottom of the bushing,<br>
the glass filaments passing through the gaps between<br>
the rows of fins.<br>
Cooling fins ore known from patents US 3 150 946<br>
and Us 3 345 147. Now, according no those documents,<br>
the fins are made from a metal gauze which is folded<br>
into a tube to form the fin. However, folding deforms<br>
some of the holes in the mesh. These are then no longer<br>
the same size and the flow generated by blowing is no<br>
longer uniform.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
Patent US 5 693 us discloses a suction fin device<br>
that increases the convecced heat exchange underneath<br>
the bottom of the bushing, The sucking of air through<br>
the fins generates uniform flow under the bushing and<br>
improves the stability of the fiberizing. By contrast,<br>
the sucking-in of air through the fins encourages the<br>
deposition of airborne substances (dust) of the surface<br>
of the fins and the ingress of dust and water droplets<br>
into the web, and these are factors known to contribute<br>
to the instability of the web.<br>
Patents US 4 214 884 and US 4 310 602 relate to<br>
fins made from a thin sheet of solid nickel. The holes;<br>
with identical and precise dimensions, are obtained<br>
using a photochemical or electrolytic process.<br>
In spite of the care taken in manufacturing these<br>
holes, their density is not enough to guarantee the<br>
optimum air flow conditions (uniformity) that will<br>
guarantee the stability of the web of glass filaments.<br>
The present invention therefore aims to alleviate<br>
these disadvantages by proposing a heat exchanger<br>
device intended to be positioned underneath the bottom<br>
of a bushing, particularly a high-throughput bushing,<br>
this heat exchanger device being designed ta guarantee<br>
optimum fiberizing conditions for the web of filaments<br>
passing through said bushing.<br>
To this end, the heat exchanger device that is the<br>
subject of the invention, comprising at least one fin<br>
provided with means for blowing a fluid, is<br>
characterized in that the blowing means are uniform and<br>
consist of at least one of the walls of said fin, said<br>
wall having open porosity.<br>
By virtue of these arrangements it is possible to<br>
obtain optimum cooling of the cone of glass leaving the<br>
bottom of the bushing using a convection movement<br>
resulting from the blowing of the fluid.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention recourse<br>
may also possibly be had to one and/or other of the<br>
following treasures;<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
-	the open porosity of the wall is between 5 and<br>
30% and preferably between 10 and 25% and more<br>
preferably still between 15 and 20%,<br>
-	the fin is of parallelepipedal overall shape and<br>
tubular cross section and has a permeability measured<br>
 with air at a pressure of 0.5 bar and at 0°C lying in<br>
the range from 200 to 1500 Sm2/h/m2, particularly lying<br>
in the range from 300 to 600 Sm2/h/m2, and preferably<br>
lying in the range between 500 and 600 Sm2/h/m2 ,<br>
-	the blowing fluid velocity field is symmetric<br>
across the open porosity wall,<br>
-	at least one of the walls of the heat exchanger<br>
device is obtained by sintering a metal powder,<br>
- the metal powder is based on a mixture of<br>
powdered stainless steel, brass and nickel, with a<br>
particle size smaller than 100 µm and preferably with a<br>
particle size lying within the range from 10 to 80 µm,<br>
-	the porosity of the fin based on metal powder is<br>
Of the order of 17%,<br>
-	at least one of the walls of the heat exchanger<br>
device is obtained by laminating a metal gauze,<br>
-	the lamination comprises 3 to 13, particularly 3<br>
to 6, layers of metal gauze,<br>
-	the fluid is air at a pressure of between 0.1<br>
and 6 bar, preferably between 0.2 and 4 bar,<br>
-	the blowing fluid results from the vaporization<br>
within the fin of a fluid that was initially in the<br>
liquid state,<br>
-	the heat exchanger device is provided with an<br>
auxiliary cooling circuit.<br>
	other features and advantages of the invention<br>
will become apparent in the course of the following<br>
description of one of its embodiments, given by way of<br>
non-limiting example with reference to the attached<br>
drawings, In the drawings.<br>
-	Figure 1 is a perspective view of a heat exchanger<br>
device according to the invention.<br>
-	Figure 2 is a curve illustrating the change in<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
throughput of a bushing as a function of the increase<br>
in the set point temperature of the bushing, and for<br>
various cooling air flow rates through the fin,<br>
- Figure 3 is a curve illustrating the change in<br>
thennal power likely to be removed by a blowing fin as<br>
a function of the blowing fluid flow rate and as a<br>
function of the temperature difference between a point<br>
on the fin and the blown air.<br>
- Figures 4 and 5 are photographs illustrating the<br>
change in shape of the cone for various blowing fluid<br>
temperatures and flow rates, for two different<br>
positions of the cone on the fin.<br>
figure 1 depicts the heat exchanger device 1<br>
according to the invention. This device essentially<br>
comprises a plurality of fins 2 (to make the drawing<br>
essiar to understand, just two fins have been depicted)<br>
and a manifold 3. Each of the fins, at one of its free<br>
ends, is secured by known means (welding, brazing,<br>
banding) to one of the walls of the manifold so as to<br>
form a comb in this particular embodiment. It goes<br>
without saying that this heat exchanger device may<br>
adopt different configurations other than that of a<br>
comb; it may thus be in the form of a frame or portion<br>
of a frame incorporating said fins.<br>
This heat exchanger device is intended to be<br>
positioned underneath and near the bottom of a bushing<br>
in a fiberising booth. The spacing between the fins<br>
corresponds roughly to the separation of the fiberizing<br>
nozzles situated at the bottom of the bushing so that<br>
the filaments of molten glass pass more or less in a<br>
plane positioned such that it is coplanar with and<br>
equidistant between two juxtaposed fins.<br>
Each fin is of roughly parallelepipedal shape with<br>
a tubular cross section and has short and long walls 4,<br>
5 parallel to one another in pairs, the long walls 4,<br>
5, however, being intended to face the filaments. In<br>
the example depicted in figure 1, the fin is of<br>
rectangular cross section and the interior passage 6<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
defined between the walls 4, 5 of the fin allows a<br>
compressed blowing fluid (such as air or nitrogen for<br>
example) to paas. This blowing fluid is subjected<br>
beforehand to a treatment to remove any harmful<br>
particles which might tend to clog the pores of the fin<br>
(air from which oil and dust have been removed) . The<br>
blowing fluid may also result from the vaporization of<br>
a fluid initially in the liquid state (water, alcohol,<br>
ethylene glycol, acetone, this fluid being used pure or<br>
as a mixture). this vaporization taking place within<br>
che fin: this type of blowing fluid is advantageous<br>
because it makes it possible to use the latent heat of<br>
vaporization of the fluid. Each of the passages of each<br>
of the fins is connected to the manifold when the comb<br>
is produced, the comb itself being provided at the<br>
manifold with a device for connection to the blowing<br>
fluid distributed to the fiberizing booth.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention,<br>
the fin is obtained by sintering a metal powder,<br>
particularly a mixture of powdered stainless steel,<br>
brass and nickel, the parcicle size of which is smaller<br>
than 100 µm and preferably lies in the range from 10 to<br>
80 µm.<br>
The open, porosity sought with this type of powder<br>
is in the range between 5 and 30% and preferably<br>
between 10 and 25% and more preferably still between 15<br>
and 20% and more or less around 17%.<br>
The thickness of the tubular walls of the fin is<br>
more or less, around l mm.<br>
using these fins it has been possible to measure,<br>
across each to the long faces of the fin, a<br>
permeability to air measured at 0.5 bar and 0°C in the<br>
range from 300 to 1500 Sm2/h/m2, particularly in the<br>
range from 300 to 800 Sm2/h/m2 and preferably in the<br>
range from 500 to 600 Sm2/h/m2, which represents flow<br>
speeds of between 0.08 and 0.2 m/s in the case of the<br>
first range of permeability values. The operating<br>
pressure of the fin and therefore of the comb which<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
incorporates at least one of these fins is between 0-1<br>
and 6 bar, preferably between 0.2 and 4 bar.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the fin is<br>
obtained by laminating a metal gauze, between at least<br>
3 and 18 layers, particularly between at lease 3 and 6<br>
layers of gauze assembled by compression or by<br>
sintering. The mesh size of the gauze lies more or less<br>
in the range from 1 to 30 µm.<br>
The open porosity sought with this lamination of<br>
metal gauze lies in the range from 5 to 30 % and<br>
preferably between 10 and 25% and more preferably still<br>
between 15 and 20%.<br>
Likewise, using these fins, it has been possible<br>
to measure on each of the long faces of the fin a<br>
permeability to air at 0.5 bar and at 0°C in the range<br>
from 300 to 1500 Sm2/h/m2, particularly in the range<br>
from 300 to 800 Sm2/h/m2, preferably in the range from<br>
500 to 600 Sm2/h/m2 which represents flow speeds of<br>
between 0.08 and 0.2 m/S (in the case of the first<br>
range of permeability values) . The operating pressure<br>
of the fin and therefore of the comb incorporating at<br>
lease one of these fins is between 0.1 and 6 bar,<br>
preferably between 0.2 and 4 bar.<br>
Using this method of fabrication it has been<br>
possible to determine a certain number of<br>
characteristics regarding the flow of the bloving fluid<br>
through each side of the long wills, of the fin.<br>
Hemce, Figure 2 shows the change in throughput of<br>
the bushing as a function of the increase in the set<br>
point temperature of the bottom of the bushing for<br>
various blowing fluid flow rates through a wall of the<br>
fin. The data relating to the bushing illustrated in<br>
Figure 5 et seq, are given by way of indication, the<br>
bushing in question being a laboratory bushing fed with<br>
alkali resistant glass cullor.<br>
The chroughpic of the bushing increases<br>
progressively as the pushing set point temperature<br>
increases. At the maximum temperature (1475oC that the<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
bushing can withstand, by adjusting the blowing flow<br>
rate a maximum bushing throughput of 47.2 kg/day is<br>
observed. This is 211 higher than the maximum<br>
throughput that can be achieved with conventional fins<br>
(39.1 kg/day) , The gain in throughput using the blowing<br>
fins is therefore very great. It should the pointed out<br>
that this maximum throughput is limited rather by the<br>
maximum set point temperature of the bushing (1475°C)<br>
at which temperature the alloy of which the pushing is<br>
made melts.<br>
The increase in the throughput of the pushing is<br>
not only dependent on the temperature of the blowing<br>
fluid, which provides cooling of the fins by<br>
convection, when the blowing fluid passes through the<br>
porous walls of the fins, the fresh blown fluid<br>
(entering the fins at 20°C) efficiently coals the fins<br>
and is able to keep the fin temperature relatively low<br>
dependent an the blowing flow rate. This low<br>
temperature of the blowing fins allows at the seme time<br>
an increase in the radiation heat exchange between the<br>
eones and the blowing fins. In order to give an idea of<br>
the cooling capability of the blowing fins, Figure 3<br>
sets out the thermal power that can be removed by a<br>
blowing fin as a function of the blowing fluid flow<br>
rate, assuming an air temperature around the cones of<br>
100oC. 200oC and 300oC, respectively. It can be pointed<br>
out that, if a fin blows a blowing fluid (in this<br>
instance air) at a flow rate of 5 m3/h, it is able to<br>
remove 130 W at 100°C, 280 W at 200oC and 450 W at<br>
300oC. This data should be compared with the cooling<br>
capability of a fin known from the prior art, the<br>
latter cooling capability being limited to around 100<br>
watts.<br>
Although increasing the throughput of a bushing is<br>
one of the users' main objectives it is nevertheless<br>
important to loss sight of the fact that this<br>
increase must not be had at the expense of the<br>
stability of the bushing, and mainly the stability of<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
the cones formed underneath the bottom of the bushing.<br>
Now, ccne stability is dependent on the cone<br>
temperature, this temperature itself being dependent on<br>
the flow rate of the blowing fluid and on its<br>
homogeneity.<br>
As can be seen in Figures 4 and 5, it is observed<br>
that when the set point temperature increases the ccne<br>
depicted in Figure 4 becomes increasingly hot. It<br>
progressively regains its volume and becomes<br>
increasingly straight. In the case of the cone depicted<br>
in Figure 5, the blowing by the fins is more gentle and<br>
the cone is wider. when the set point temperature<br>
increases, the cone enlarges and begins to spill over<br>
around the nozzle. Upwards of 1465oC the air flow rate<br>
has to be increased in order to stabilise the<br>
fiberizing, An extremely advantageous phenomenon is<br>
observed: the cone is very stable and there is<br>
practically no longer any of the pulsation of the cone<br>
that is found with fins of the prior art. Fiberizing<br>
can be achieved stably even when the cone spills over<br>
around the nozzle. When the cone is extremely hot,<br>
pulsation reappears and a small increase in blowing is<br>
immediately able to calm this instability. In addition,<br>
during tests, it was found that the shape of the cones<br>
could very easily and very flexibly be varied by<br>
altering the flow rate blown through the fins. This<br>
offers the advantage of a great potential for adjusting<br>
the thickness of the filament.<br>
Of course, other embodiments not depicted in the<br>
figures may be conceived of particularly in terms of<br>
the shapes, cross sections and outlines of the fins.<br>
Likewise, in terms of the heat exchanger device and<br>
according to an alternative form, also not depicted in<br>
the figures, provision is made for a cooling circuit to<br>
be incorporated in the manifold in order to remove<br>
additional heat energy by circulating a heat transfer<br>
fluid (such as water for example).<br>
The invention described above offers numerous<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
advantages:<br>
•	It increases the cooling of the cone of glass and<br>
the. bottom of the bushing by the blowing of the<br>
fins. This makes it possible to widen the<br>
fiberizing temperature range. Fiberising becomes<br>
less critical and more stable;<br>
•	It avoids the deposition of airborne substances on<br>
the surfaces of the fins by blowing. It makes it<br>
possible to provide fins that are more efficient<br>
and more economical for the fiberizing of glass<br>
filaments. The production of filaments can thus<br>
mainly or entirely dissociate itself from the<br>
disruption of periodic cleaning of the fins, thus<br>
improving productivity;<br>
•	It provides fins the heat absorption rate of which<br>
can be adjusted, allowing optimum heat absorption<br>
under all operating conditions;<br>
•	It supplies an additional means for precisely<br>
adjusting the thickness of the filaments by<br>
adjusting the blowing pressure;<br>
•	It immediately, using fresh air blown through the<br>
fins, compensates for the air sucked out of the<br>
fiberizing region by the drawing of the filaments,<br>
making it possible to reduce ox prevent the<br>
ingress of air from the outside toward the inside<br>
of the web of filaments in this sensitive region.<br>
Fiberizing can thus dissociate itself from the<br>
effects of turbulent or transient disturbances in<br>
the flow of air outside the web of filaments (for<br>
example: the movement of dust). The air flow<br>
conditions in the fiberizing region become more<br>
stable and easier to control.<br>
•	with uniform and homogeneous blowing fins it is<br>
therefore possible to fiberize at a higher<br>
temperature and to reduce the fiberizing tension<br>
while at the same time maintaining the stability<br>
of the bushing.<br><br>
