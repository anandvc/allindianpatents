ORIGINAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE 1NVENT80N ^<br>
The present invention relates to tubular jacket, receiver tube and parabolic trough<br>
collector for solar energy<br>
) A known parabolic trough collector comprises a single axis parabolic<br>
mirror and a receiver tube, which is arranged at the focus of the parabolic mirror.<br>
The mirror usually has a width of from 5 to 6 m. The receiver tube comprises a<br>
preferably radiation selective inner tube section, which is also called the absorber<br>
tube, and an outer tubular jacket made of glass for insulation. Mirror and receiver<br>
1) tube are directed toward the sun, so that the solar radiation always is directed<br>
normal to the aperture plane and ideally the radiation falling on the mirror is<br>
guided to the receiver tube.<br>
Focusing errors and thus geometrically dependent optical losses occur in •<br>
parabolic trough collectors due to various factors. For example, the mirror<br>
i ) elements have a certain total shape tolerance or also waviness, which leads to<br>
focusing errors. The positioning of the mirror elements during assembly is only<br>
possible within certain tolerances. Also self-deformation, manufacturing and<br>
assembly tolerances of the steel structure, on which the parabolic trough<br>
•<br>
collector is built, must be considered. Last, but not least, wind occurring in the<br>
2) vicinity of the parabolic trough collector leads to deformation of the entire '<br>
structure and thus to focusing errors. •<br>
Currently attempts have been made to minimize optical losses by<br>
defocusing with the help of secondary concentrators mounted on the receiver<br>
2<br>
tube. Already there has been an experimental use of a secondary planar<br>
^ reflector. An additional arrangement of a parabolic mirror with a secondary<br>
concentrator in the form of a metallic reflector has been described in WO<br>
97/00408. A zig-zag-shaped metal sheet has been used as a secondary<br>
5 concentrator according to H. Price, et al, Journal of Solar Energy Engineering,<br>
Volume 124, p. 109-125 (2002).<br>
When a highly reflective material, e.g. a polished metal sheet, is used for<br>
the secondary concentrator, it is important to put it in the tubular jacket in a<br>
vacuum, in order to protect it from dirt and aging. The secondary concentrator<br>
1) can be mounted either on the tubular jacket or on the absorber tube. The<br>
absorber tube is shaded by mounting the secondary concentrator above the<br>
absorber tube on the side facing away from the mirror. When the secondary<br>
concentrator is wider than the absorber tube, also a part of the mirror is shaded.<br>
If the secondary concentrator is attached to the tubular jacket, a part of the<br>
1: i radiation, which falls on the side of the secondary concentrator facing away from<br>
the mirror, is lost, since the tubular jacket and the absorber tube are thermally<br>
decoupled. It is possible to use a portion of this radiation when the secondary<br>
concentrator is attached to the absorber tube and is made absorbing on the side<br>
facing away from the mirror. Because of that feature more radiation can be<br>
20 utilized. At the same time however the increase in the absorber surface area<br>
increases the thermal losses.<br>
The increase of the interceptor factor (the fraction of the radiation, which<br>
falls on the absorber tube), which is achieved by the secondary concentrator, is<br>
3<br>
4<br>
necessarily accompanied with radiation losses on account of the above-<br>
^ mentioned disadvantages. No significant improvement of the interceptor factor<br>
may therefore be achieved in total.<br>
) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a tubular jacket for a<br>
parabolic trough collector, which helps to provide the highest possible interceptor<br>
factor, thus increasing the amount of solar energy that is collected.<br>
1) It is another object of the present invention to provide a receiver tube for a<br>
parabolic trough collector, which helps to collect more solar radiation than<br>
conventional receiver tubes of the prior art and has the highest possible<br>
interceptor factor.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a parabolic trough<br>
1; collector for solar energy, which has a receiver tube with the highest possible<br>
interceptor factor.<br>
According to the present invention the tubular jacket or jacket tube for a<br>
parabolic trough collector has structural elements, which focus sunlight on an<br>
absorber tube arranged in the tubular jacket or jacket tube, by deflection and/or<br>
2) detraction of the sunlight.<br>
According to the present invention a receiver tube for a parabolic trough<br>
collector comprises a tubular jacket and an absorber tube arranged in the tubular<br>
jacket. The tubular jacket has structural elements, which focus sunlight on the<br>
4<br>
absorber tube arranged in the tubular jacket, by deflecting and/or detracting<br>
^ sunlight.<br>
According to the present invention the parabolic trough collector for solar<br>
energy comprises a parabolic mirror having a focal point and a receiver tube<br>
5 arranged at the focal point of the parabolic mirror. The receiver tube comprises<br>
an absorber tube and a tubular jacket around the absorber tube, wherein the<br>
tubular jacket comprises structural elements, which focus sunlight on the<br>
absorber tube arranged in it, by deflecting and/or detracting sunlight.<br>
Because of the focusing structural elements in the tubular jacket,<br>
1) radiation, which would enter from a certain angular range through a smooth or<br>
unstructured tubular jacket and leave again without impinging on the absorber<br>
tube, now is directly guided to the absorber tube surface. This especially<br>
concerns rays, which come to the tubular jacket from the outside region of the<br>
parabolic mirror, as well as rays, which impinge directly on the tubular jacket from<br>
i 5 the sun. The structural elements of the tubular jacket are preferably formed to<br>
particular focus the rays that reach the tubular jacket from the outer region of the<br>
parabolic mirror on the absorber tube. The optical structuring of the tubular jacket<br>
causes an optical widening of the absorber tube similar to a magnifying effect for<br>
the above-mentioned angular range. Depending on the size and spatial<br>
20 distribution of the mirror errors an increase of the optical efficiency of about 1 to 3<br>
% can be achieved.<br>
With larger mirror and assembly errors the increase of the optical<br>
efficiency can turn out to be still higher. The use of a tubular jacket according to<br>
5<br>
the invention can also accommodate higher tolerances in mirror manufacture and<br>
A assembly, which leads to clearly reduced costs.<br>
An additional advantage of the tubular jacket according to the invention is<br>
that the thermal load is distributed somewhat uniformly over the absorber tube.<br>
: &gt; Parabolic trough collectors have the undesirable property that the side of the<br>
absorber tube facing the mirror is many times more strongly irradiated than the<br>
side facing away from the mirror. Because of this property usually temperature<br>
gradients arise over the tube circumference, which lead again to material stress<br>
and deformation. Because of the focusing, especially of the rays falling directly<br>
1) on the tubular jacket and rays that are axially remote from the absorber tube, the<br>
side of the absorber tube facing away from the mirror is somewhat more strongly<br>
irradiated when the tubular jacket according to the invention is used.<br>
The focusing structural elements of the tubular jacket advantageously can<br>
be a plurality of lenses, a plurality of polyhedrons, and especially preferably a<br>
15 plurality of prisms. These types of optical elements have the property of focusing<br>
on the interior of the tubular jacket and thus on the absorber tube.<br>
The focusing structural elements can be provided by a suitably structured<br>
foil, which is mounted on the inner or outer side of the tubular jacket. The<br>
mounting on the outside is changed more easily from a manufacturing<br>
20 engineering standpoint. In order to protect the foil from weathering effects and<br>
dirt the foil can be attached to the inner side of the tubular jacket prior to<br>
assembly. When the foil is to be attached, the fact that the foil is optically coupled<br>
6<br>
to the tubular jacket should be considered. It can, for example, be glued or<br>
^ laminated.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the tubular jacket is a drawn glass tube. The<br>
focusing structural elements are constant or do not change in the longitudinal<br>
5 direction along the tubular jacket in the drawn glass tube. Lens-shaped structural<br>
elements are obtained e.g. by a wavy structuring of the inner and/or outer wall of<br>
the glass tube. Prismatic or prism-shaped structural elements were obtained by a<br>
substantially zig-zag structuring of the inner and/or outer wall of the glass tube.<br>
In practice with the prismatic structural elements a rounding off of the prisms can<br>
] 0 be avoided only to the extent of the current engineering capabilities.<br>
Preferably the tubular jacket has an antireflective coating on at least one<br>
of the inner side and outer side. Because of that it is guaranteed that a maximum<br>
portion of the radiation impinging on the tubular jacket is guided to the absorber<br>
tube and not reflected to the outside.<br>
: 5 It has proven advantageous to provide structured regions only over at<br>
least one segment. For example, the structuring is interrupted at least partially in<br>
the region in which the radiation falls directly on the absorber tube without<br>
deflection by the focusing structural elements of the tubular jacket on the side<br>
facing the sun. An arrangement in which the structural elements are provided in<br>
: 10 the tubular jacket symmetrically in two strips on respective opposite sides of the<br>
normal axis of the parabolic mirror in angular regions of 20° to 105°, especially of<br>
35° to 65°, is particularly preferred.<br>
7<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the parabolic trough collector the receiver<br>
^ tube is displaced somewhat relative to the focal point in the direction of the<br>
parabolic mirror by a distance equal to about half the spacing between the<br>
tubular jacket and the absorber tube. Because of that displacement losses from<br>
) radiation, which misses the absorber tube, in that it passes under the receiver<br>
tube, namely between the receiver tube and the mirror, are reduced. The result is<br>
that thermal load is distributed more equally over the absorber tube, so that a<br>
smaller temperature gradient over the tube circumference, and thus smaller<br>
deformation and material stresses, result.<br>

^ DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In figure 1 a parabolic mirror 1 and a receiver tube 2 are illustrated. The<br>
: i receiver tube 2 Is arranged at the focus of the parabolic mirror 1 in the<br>
arrangement shown in Fig. 1. Incident radiation on the side of the receiver tube<br>
facing the sun always impinges in the normal direction, since the mirror 1 and the<br>
receiver tube 2 are pointed exactly toward the position of the sun. Radiation<br>
impinges at an angle between 160° and 180° on the side of the receiver tube 2<br>
10 facing the mirror. The arrows in Fig. 1 show the incidence angles.<br>
In Fig. 2 a conventional receiver tube 2 is shown, which comprises an<br>
absorber tube 4 and a tubular jacket 3. The radiation beam 5,5' is a beam, which<br>
passes comparatively far from the optic axis of the collector, while the radiation<br>
beam 6,6' is a beam, which passes comparatively close to the axis. Both beams<br>
15 pass through the tubular jacket 3 without striking the absorber tube 4.<br>
In Fig. 3 the focussing error due to mirror deformation is illustrated by<br>
example. The losses arise principally in the outer region of the parabolic mirror 1,<br>
since the error has a greater effect because of the greater distance to the<br>
receiver tube 2. Because of the greater distance between the mirror 1 and the<br>
2 3 receiver tube 2 an incident beam spreads to a greater beam cross-section in the<br>
case of a comparatively far beam 8 (as measured with respect to the optic axis<br>
0) than in the case of a comparatively near beam 7. As usual the deformation of<br>
the mirror 1 is greater at the edges of the mirror than at its center because of the<br>
10<br>
undesirable load distribution. The mirror error additionally increases with<br>
^ increasing distance from the optical axis 0 because of that. The focusing error<br>
has diverse consequences. Radiation beam 8, which falls on the tubular jacket 3<br>
from the edge region of the mirror, passes through it to a part on the upper side<br>
) facing away from the mirror. Radiation beam 7, which is directed at the mirror<br>
center, falls on the receiver tube 2 almost without any losses. Beams, which pass<br>
through the tubular jacket 3 before they reach the mirror 1, fall in part on the<br>
absorber tube 4. A further part leaves the tubular jacket 3, without falling on the<br>
absorber tube 4 and is guided toward the mirror 1. However because of the<br>
13 tubular jacket 3 the beams are partially deflected strongly, so that they miss the<br>
absorber tube 4 after reflection at the mirror 1.<br>
In Fig. 4 a receiver tube 2 is shown, which comprises an absorber tube 4<br>
and a tubular jacket 3 structured in certain segments. In the embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 4 the structuring in the region a of the tubular jacket 3, in which the<br>
15 radiation comes directly from the sun to the absorber tube 4 without additional<br>
deflection, is omitted. That is region a is not structured. Moreover the structuring<br>
is omitted in the region of the tubular jacket 3 facing the mirror. Since the<br>
incoming beam angle space on the side facing the mirror is almost completely<br>
filled, no significant increase of the interceptor factor can be achieved by<br>
20 structuring this region. Especially in the lower tubular jacket region, in which the<br>
radiation falls on the absorber tube 2 from an angular range near 180°, a small<br>
local reduction in the interceptor factor might even result.<br>
It has been shown that at least one segment or region designated by c<br>
11<br>
should be structured, which means the structuring or structure elements should<br>
^ be provided in an angular region of 35° to 65° to the normal axis N of the<br>
parabolic mirror surface. An additional increase of the interceptor factor can be<br>
achieved when the segments designated by b and d are provided with structural<br>
) elements or structured. This corresponds to an angular range of 20° to 105° to<br>
the normal axis N of the parabolic mirror surface. Assuming a mirror angular<br>
error of e.g. 4 to 5 mrad, an increase of interceptor factor of up to 3 % may be<br>
achieved.<br>
In Fig. 5a to 5d specific embodiments of tubular jacket 3 according to the<br>
i ) invention are illustrated in cross section to show the structured elements 9a to 9d<br>
for focussing more radiation on absorber tube 4. Three tubular jackets 3 of Figs.<br>
5a, 5b and 5c have structural elements or structuring 9a, 9b, 9c only in a certain<br>
angular region. A lens-shaped structuring or lens-shaped structural elements 9a<br>
are shown in Fig. 5a. A prism-shaped structuring or prism-shaped structural<br>
15 elements 9b are shown in Fig. 5b. Zig-zag shaped structural elements 9c are<br>
shown in Fig. 5c. The structural elements shown in Fig. 5d, which are prismshape,<br>
are provided on a foil 19 that is placed on the outside of the tubular jacket<br>
3. In other embodiments the foil may be placed on the inside of the tubular<br>
jacket. These structural elements or structuring in these embodiments provide an<br>
20 optimized interceptor factor. The boundary surfaces are selected so that as great<br>
as possible focussing on the absorber tube is attained for a given incidence<br>
angle and mirror error.<br>
12<br>
In Fig. 6a the path of rays is shown in a receiver tube 2 comprising a<br>
^ conventional glass tubular jacket 3 of a given thickness and an absorber tube 4.<br>
I The ray path shown In Fig. 6a is for a beam that is comparatively far from the<br>
optic axis. Individual rays, which do not reach the absorber tube 4, occur<br>
5 especially in the part 3' of the tubular jacket 3 facing away from the mirror 1.<br>
Furthermore a gentle defocusing effect of the part 3' of the tubular jacket 3 is<br>
observed. It is caused by the given thickness of the tubular jacket 3 and by the<br>
difference between the index of refraction of glass and air or glass and vacuum.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig, 6b the tubular jacket 3 includes zig-zag structural<br>
13 elements 2' according to the invention, especially in the angular region 90° to 20°<br>
to the normal axis N. The zig-zag surface shape or profile, like an arrangement<br>
of prisms, acts on the incident radiation that is comparatively far from the axis so<br>
that a large part of the othenwise defocused incident radiation is guided to the<br>
absorber tube 4.<br>
15 Figs. 7a and 7b show the same arrangement as in Figs. 6a and 6b, but for<br>
radiation which falls directly from the sun on the receiver tube 2 comprising the<br>
absorber tube 4 and the tubular jacket 3. The ratio of the radiation, which falls on<br>
the absorber tube 4 and which is deflected away from it, corresponds to the ratio<br>
of the cross-sectional areas in a longitudinal section through the absorber tube 4<br>
2) and through the tubular jacket 3 (Fig. 6a). Furthermore the defocusing effect of<br>
the part 3' of the tubular jacket 3 on the normal radiation is especially clear. Of<br>
course even using the tubular jacket 3 according to the invention with the<br>
structured region not all rays are guided to the absorber tube 4. However the<br>
13<br>
portion of the radiation incident on the tubular jacket 3 that reaches the absorber<br>
g | tube 4 can be significantly increased.<br>
' This effect is also clearly understandable with the help of the graphical<br>
illustrations in Figs. 8a and 8b. Fig. 8a shows the dependence of the local<br>
5 interceptor factor in percent on the distance to the optic axis in millimeters. The<br>
solid curve corresponds to the curve obtained with a conventional or prior art<br>
unstructured tubular jacket. The dashed curve corresponds to the curve obtained<br>
using a tubular jacket with the focussing structural elements according to the<br>
invention. A definite increase of the interceptor factor for radiation coming directly<br>
1) from the sun (spacing to the optic axis of about 0 mm) and for radiation that is<br>
spaced in a region comparatively far, about 2000 mm, from the axis is observed.<br>
Also the interceptor factor is increased by the focussing structural elements in the<br>
tubular jacket between about 1 % (incident angle between 0° and 10°) and about<br>
3 % (incidence angle between 50° and 60°).<br>
15 In Fig. 9 a preferred arrangement of the receiver tube 2 comprising the<br>
absorber tube 4 and the tubular jacket 3 in relation to the parabolic mirror 1 is<br>
sketched. Conventionally the receiver tube 2 is arranged at the focal point F.<br>
According to the invention, in order to reduce the number of rays that miss the<br>
absorber tube by passing under the receiver tube 2, the receiver tube 2 (i.e. its<br>
2) center or the center of the absorber tube) is displaced from the focal point F in<br>
the direction of the parabolic mirror 1 by a distance equal to about half of the<br>
spacing d between the tubular jacket 3 and the absorber tube 2.<br>
14<br>
In certain embodiments the tubular jacket 3 may be provided with an<br>
(^ antireflective coating on an inside surface 17 as shown in Fig. 7b and/or on an<br>
outside surface 11 as shown in Fig. 6b.<br>

jacket over respective angular range of 20° and 65° on opposite sides of said normal axis (N) to<br>
focus sunlight that is reflected from the outer region of the parabolic mirror on said absorber tube<br>
(4),<br>
whereby said structural elements focus sunlight that falls direct on the receiver tube from<br>
the sun but which would otherwise be reflected away from the absorber tube without the<br>
presence of the structural elements as well as sunlight that is reflected from the parabolic mirror<br>
but which would otherwise not reach said absorber tube without the presence of the structural<br>
elements on said absorber tube.<br>

plurality of prisms (9b, 9c).<br>
5. The tubular jacket as defined in claim 1, further comprising a structured foil<br>
including said structural elements.<br>
w 6. The tubular jacket as defined in claim 1, wherein said structural elements do not change<br>
in a longitudinal direction along the tubular jacket.<br>
7. The tubular jacket as defined in claim 1, further comprising an antireflective coating (11,<br>
17) on at least one of an inside surface and an outside surface of the tubular jacket.<br>
8. A receiver tube for a parabolic trough collector, said receiver tube comprising an<br>
absorber tube (4) and a tubular jacket (3) according to claim 1 arranged around the absorber tube<br>
(4); wherein said structural elements (9a, 9b, 9c, 9d) that focus sunlight on said absorber tube<br>
arranged in the tubular jacket.<br>
9. The receiver tube as defined in claim 8 , wherein said structural elements comprise a<br>
plurality of lenses, prisms and/or polyhedral elements arranged in at least one segment (b, c, d)<br>
around the tubular jacket.<br>
10. The receiver tube as defined in claim 8, wherein said tubular jacket comprises a foil (19)<br>
including said structural elements.<br>
11. The receiver tube as defined in claim 8, wherein said tubular jacket comprises an<br>
antireflective coating (11, 17) arranged on an outside surface and/or an inside surface of the<br>
tubular jacket.<br>
12. A parabolic trough collector for solar energy, said parabolic trough collector comprising<br>
a parabolic mirror (1) having a focal point (F); and<br>
a receiver tube (2) arranged at said focal point (F) to receive solar radiation reflected<br>
from the parabolic mirror;<br>
wherein said receiver tube (2) comprises an absorber tube (4) and a tubular jacket (3)<br>
according to claim 1 arranged around the absorber tube (4), and said structural elements (9a, 9b,<br>
9c, 9d) focus sunlight on said absorber tube arranged in the tubular jacket.<br>
I,<br>
W 13. The parabolic trough collector as defined in claim 12, wherein said structural elements<br>
comprise a plurality of lenses, prisms and/or polyhedral elements arranged in at least one<br>
segment (b, c, d) around the tubular jacket.<br>
14. The parabolic trough collector as defined in claim 12, wherein said structural elements do<br>
not change in a longitudinal direction along the receiver tube (2).<br>
15. The parabolic trough collector as defined in claim 12, wherein said receiver tube (2) is<br>
positioned in relation to said parabolic mirror (1), so that a center of said receiver tube (2) is<br>
displaced in a direction toward said parabolic mirror (1) from said focal point (F) by a distance<br>
equal to about half of a spacing (d) between said tubular jacket (3) and said absorber tube (4).<br>
