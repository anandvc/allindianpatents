				<td>A FLUID DIE USEFUL IN MAKING SOFT FILM AND A METHOD OF<br>
MAKING A FILM THEREOF<br>
[0001] Embodiments of present invention are directedio the improved coverstocks, the<br>
method of making improved soft films, and the apparatus used in the method<br>
such as a fluid die useful in making soft film. Embodiments of the present<br>
invention also relate to an improved personal care coverstock such as a topsheet<br>
for use in body contacting articles such as baby diapers, adult incontinent<br>
absorbent articles, sanitary napkins or panty liners, facial wipes, body wipes, and<br>
the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] It is known to vacuum-form two-dimensional sheets to create three-<br>
dimensional formed films, by causing a softened or molten polymer sheet to<br>
conform to the shape of a forming screen. Commonly utilized apertured<br>
formed film topsheets are disclosed in, for example U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,929,135, 4,324,246, 4,342,314, 4;252,516, 4,535,020, 5,591,510, and U.S.<br>
Pat. Appl. No. 10/082,040 filed February 20, 2002. The formed films<br>
described in these publications are formed by application of a fluid pressure<br>
differential where the fluid preferably is air to thereby cause the polymer<br>
sheet to conform to the screen and also to cool. A preferred feature of these<br>
formed films is that the polymer crystallizes, or "sets" after the molten<br>
polymer has been formed. The resultant formed film therefore is said to have<br>
"memory." Memory enables the formed film to regain its original form after<br>
non-deforming forces are applied to it, for example while the film is stored in<br>
the form of a wound roll. A disadvantage of vacuum formed films is that the<br>
body contacting surface of the film my have a plastic feeling that can feel<br>
both sticky and hot to the wearer of the article.<br>
[0003] It also is known to utilize high pressure water jet systems, known as<br>
hydroforming systems, to cause two-dimensional polymeric films to conform<br>
to forming screens in order to create three-dimensional films. U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,609,518, 4,629,643, 4,695,422, 4,778,644, and 4,839,216, all to Curro<br>
(referred to herein as "Curro") and assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble, and U.S.<br><br><br>
Pat. Nos. 5,770,144, 6,022,607, and 6,240,817 assigned to McNeil, describe<br>
a multitude of film designs created by the combination of forming screens<br>
using high pressure water jet systems. In these systems, pressurized water is<br>
ejected from nozzles projecting water onto the surface of a polymeric film<br>
causing it to conform to the surface of an underlying support screen. The<br>
screen has indentations or perforations disposed on its surface. As the screen<br>
rotates it causes subsequent portions of the film to pass under the water jet<br>
causing subsequent portions of the film to conform to the screen. An<br>
advantage of this method of making formed films is that the number of<br>
protrusions that can be made in a specific surface area of film is greater than<br>
what is possible in a vacuum formed film process. Another advantage is that<br>
by utilizing water to deform crystalline film high levels of energy are applied<br>
to the film thereby causing more work and making the film softer. A<br>
disadvantage of known hydroformed films is that liquid jets apply forming<br>
energy unevenly across the film surface causing variation in the important<br>
film properties that limits the functionality of the film.<br>
[0004] The description herein of certain advantages and disadvantages of known<br>
materials, and methods of their preparation, is not intended to limit the scope<br>
of the present invention. Indeed, the present invention may include some or<br>
all of the methods and materials described above without suffering from the<br>
same disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] It is a feature of an embodiment of the invention to improve the functional<br>
performance of hydroformed films by providing a film with improved<br>
properties. It is another feature of an embodiment of the invention to provide<br>
a cost effective method of making improved hydroformed soft film. It is an<br>
additional feature of an embodiment of the invention to provide an apparatus<br>
that improves hydroforming efficiency and quality, and lowers equipment<br>
and film production cost.<br><br>
[0006] Embodiments of the inventions described herein are directed to improved<br>
hydroforming methods and to an apparatus for forming films. A preferred<br>
embodiment comprises use of a liquid die to apply forming energy to a film<br>
while the film is positioned over a screen with indentations.<br>
[0007] Additional embodiments of the inventions described herein also are directed<br>
to improved films resulting from the application of the methods described<br>
herein, whereby the films exhibit less variation in their properties and are less<br>
costly to produce than films made with liquid jets using the same screens.<br>

wall, a trailing wall, and two side walls, the housing encompassing at least the fluid feed channel and<br>
the profiling blocks, wherein the profiling blocks are configured to consistently provide a higher<br>
pressure at the leading wall while water is flowing through the fluid feed channel.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of making a film comprising : supplying a precursor<br>
film ; pressing the precursor film against a surface of a screen provided with indentations ; passing<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] Set forth below are definitions of some of the terms and expressions used herein.<br>
[0023] The term "substantially means that a given property or parameter (such as the<br>
surface angle) may vary by about 30% from the stated value. As used herein and in<br>
the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural reference<br>
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to "a<br>
protuberance" includes a plurality of such protuberances, and a reference to "an<br>
aperture" is a reference to one or more apertures and equivalents thereof known to<br>
those skilled in the art, and so forth.<br>
[0024] As used herein, the phrase "areas immediately surrounding the region of maximum<br>
fluid discharge" means a surface area surrounding the region of maximum fluid (i.e.<br>
liquid) and/or solid waste discharge and extending approximately 1 inch in all<br>
directions from that region. The term "periphery" "peripheral areas" or "areas<br>
peripheral to" means the surface area other than the area of maximum fluid discharge<br>
and the areas immediately surrounding it.<br>
[0025] The term "multiplicity" as used in conjunction with various parameters and<br>
properties of the protuberances such as elevation angle, surface angle, and<br>
permeability, means that individual protuberances have a particular value for each<br>
parameter or property (rather than multiple values of each parameter in a single<br>
capillary), but different protuberances with different respective parameters or<br>
properties can be placed in a given area. Of course, as discussed herein, multiple<br>
protuberances having substantially the same value of a given parameter or property<br>
may be grouped together in a given area (or region).<br>
[0026] The expression "regulated pattern" means regions of protuberances in the film (and<br>
therefore in the component(s) of the absorbent article that include the film) where a<br>
selected property or selected properties of the protuberances are repeatably<br>
controlled, i.e., the property or properties is or are controlled to achieve a desired<br>
partem of the selected property or properties. If a region comprises a regulated<br><br><br>
pattern of protuberances, it does not necessarily mean that all protuberances in that<br>
region have exactly the same property (or properties) that was selected, to be<br>
controlled. It means that the selected property is varied in a designed, prescribed<br>
manner (or pattern) to substantially achieve a particular formula. Each region has<br>
only one regulated pattern. For example, two regions where the protuberances in<br>
both regions have the same properties, except elevation angle, are two regions (or<br>
zones) each having a unique regulated pattern that is different from the regulated<br>
pattern in the other zone. The properties that can be selected to be controlled<br>
include: elevation angle, surface angle, vapor permeability, liquid permeability,<br>
compression resistance, surface areas of one or both openings of the protuberances,<br>
length of the protuberances, texture of the walls of the sidewall of the protuberances<br>
and shape of protuberances.<br>
[0027] The term "permeability" refers to the permeability of a fluid (e.g., a vapor or a<br>
liquid).<br>
[0028] The term "coverstock" refers to at least one of the outer webs of an article. In the<br>
case of an absorbent article, "coverstock" typically will denote the body contacting<br>
outer web. Coverstock webs can be film webs, nonwovens webs, laminate webs and<br>
apertured laminate webs.<br>
[0029] The term "web" refers to a material capable of being wound into a roll. Webs can be<br>
film webs, nonwoven webs, laminate webs, apertured laminate webs etc.<br>
[0030] The term "sheet" typically refers to a curtain of extruded molten polymer that has not<br>
solidified into a film.<br>
[0031] The term "film" refers to a web made by extruding molten polymeric material and<br>
then cooling the material to form a solid polymeric web. Films can be monolayer<br>
films, coextruded films, coated films, and composite films. Coated films are films<br>
comprising a monolayer or coextruded film that are subsequently coated (extrusion<br>
coated, impression coated, printed) with a thin layer of the same or different material<br>
to which it is bonded. Composite films are films comprising more than one film<br>
where the at least two films are bonded in a bonding process. Bonding processes<br>
may incorporate adhesive layers between the film layers.<br><br><br>
[0032] The term "panel" means a square or rectangularly shaped sheet of steel or similar<br>
material. The term "plate" means a bonded stack of panels. The term "perforation"<br>
as used herein refers to an aperture in the screen. In term "indentation" as used<br>
herein refers to a recess located at least on the outermost surface of a screen.<br>
Indentations may connect the outermost surface and the innermost surface of the<br>
screen to create perforations in the screen. In other words, perforations are<br>
indentations but indentations are not necessarily perforations.<br>
[0033] The expression "minimum width" as used herein to describe apertures, perforations,<br>
or indentations, means the minimum distance possible between any two edges<br>
measured on the plane of the aperture (or perforation or indentation). The minimum<br>
width of a circle is its diameter. The minimum width of an ellipse is the length of its<br>
minor axis. The minimum width of a slot is the distance between its parallel straight<br>
edges. A "slot" denotes an elongated ellipse having a major and minor axis.<br>
Accordingly, the minimum width of a slot also is the length of its minor axis.<br>
[0034] The term "screen" as used herein refers to a three-dimensional molding apparatus<br>
comprising indentations used to form protuberances in films. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment screens comprise tubular members, having a width and a<br>
diameter. In alternative embodiments screens comprise belts having a width and a<br>
length. The transverse direction is the direction parallel to the width of the screen.<br>
The machine direction is the direction parallel to the direction of rotation of the<br>
screen, and is perpendicular to the transverse direction.<br>
[0035] The term "protuberance" can be defined with reference to a three-dimensional<br>
member comprising an apertured base portion located in the plane of the first surface<br>
of the film and a sidewall portion extending generally in the direction of the second<br>
surface of the film. Each base portion has a sidewall portion. Sidewall portions<br>
terminate in "ends" located in the plane of the second surface of the film. A<br>
protuberance extends from the first surface to the second surface, and is comprised<br>
of the aperture in the base portion in the first surface, the sidewalls, and the end in<br>
the second surface. The ends of the protuberances may be apertured or unapertured.<br>
An apertured protuberance also is referred to herein as an aperture.<br><br><br>
[0036] The apertures in the base portions of the protuberances, also called "primary<br>
apertures", are preferably in the shape of polygons, e.g., squares, hexagons,<br>
pentagons, ellipses, circles, ovals, slots, etc., in a regulated or random pattern. The<br>
protubered ends if apertured are called "secondary apertures", and are preferably in<br>
the shape of polygons, e.g., squares, hexagons, pentagons, ellipses, circles, ovals,<br>
slots, etc. Protuberances in the film preferably correspond to indentations in the<br>
screen, and apertured protuberances in the film correspond to perforations in the<br>
screen.<br>
[0037] The prefix "macro" as used herein refers to structural features or elements that are<br>
readily visible to a normal human eye when the perpendicular distance between the<br>
viewer's eye and the plane of the web is about 30 centimeters (cm.). Conversely, the<br>
prefix "micro" is utilized to refer to structural features or elements that are not<br>
readily visible to a normal human eye when the perpendicular distance between the<br>
viewer's eye and the plane of the web is about 30 cm.<br>
[0038] In general, the coverstock of certain embodiments of the invention should have soft<br>
feel, and good liquid acquisition and rewet prevention to maintain a dry surface and<br>
thereby keep the skin of the wearer dry. The absorbent core typically should provide<br>
enough absorbent capacity and allow the flow of vapor and/or air through the<br>
coverstock. The backsheet should prevent liquid passage while being sufficiently<br>
breathable. Furthermore, the individual elements of the absorbent article (i.e. the<br>
topsheet, the optional distribution layer, the absorbent core and the backsheet) can be<br>
joined together to form an absorbent garment, using any techniques known in the art<br>
so that the final article has the desired comfort and performance level. Suitable<br>
absorbent garments are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,798,603,<br>
5,176,668, 5,176,672, 5,192,606, and 5,509,915, the disclosures of each of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Those skilled in the art are capable<br>
of using the coverstocks described herein in any suitable absorbent article.<br>
[0039] Radel, U.S. Patent 4,508,256, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety, discloses a method of making a forming screen (the "PEL"<br>
method) by etching flat metal panels and stacking those panels in a manner such that<br><br><br>
the openings in the panels align to form passageways in the stack. The center axis of<br>
the passageways is positioned at a 90° angle from a plane parallel to the surface of<br>
the stack. In other words, the passageways are aligned perpendicularly to the surface<br>
of the stack. The stacked panels then are honded to form a plate, and subsequently<br>
the plates are rolled and welded to form a cylindrical tube or screen. The<br>
passageways in the resulting screens are also aligned perpendicularly to the surface<br>
of the screens. Screens produced by this method are referred to as PEL screens.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,562,932 and 5,718,928, the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
by reference herein in their entireties, disclose an improved method for producing<br>
PEL screens capable of forming angled or curved protuberances.<br>
[0040] U.S. Pat. No. 4,252,516, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, describes a screen comprising a series of generally hexagonal-shaped<br>
depressions attached at their edges having elliptical-shaped holes centered therein<br>
and sloping sidewalls. The holes at the inner surface of the screen are elliptical in<br>
shape and oriented so that the major axis is aligned in the machine direction. The<br>
minor axis of the ellipse is oriented in a direction perpendicular to the major axis.<br>
The preferred elliptical hole has a major axis length of from about 24 mils to about<br>
26 mils and a minor axis length of from about 17 mils to about 19 mils; most<br>
preferably, the major axis has a length of 25 mils and minor axis has a length of 18<br>
mils. The ratio of the preferred major axis to the minor axis length is 1.4.<br>
[0041] One of the earlier methods for vacuum perforation of a polymeric film is disclosed in<br>
Zimmerli, U.S. Pat. No. 3,054,148, the entire disclosure of which incorporated<br>
herein by reference. Zimmerli describes a stationary drum having a screen mounted<br>
around the outer surface of the drum and adapted to freely rotate thereon. A<br>
plasticized thermoplastic material is applied onto the screen. A vacuum chamber is<br>
employed beneath the screen to create a pressure differential between the respective<br>
surfaces of the thermoplastic sheet to be perforated to cause the plasticized sheet<br>
material to flow into openings provided in the screen and thereby cause a series of<br>
openings, holes or perforations to be formed in the plastic sheet. Zimmerli discloses<br>
a method for making a film with tapered protuberances. A variety of methods and<br><br><br>
apparatus including different types of perforating screens have been developed over<br>
the years since Zimmerli's invention for making apertured films. Examples of such<br>
methods and apparatus are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,155,693, 4,252,516,<br>
4,508,256, and 4,509,908, the entire disclosures of each of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0042] Figure 1 illustrates a liquid jet hydroforming process similar to that described in<br>
detail in Curro, U.S. Patent 4,629,643, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
by reference herein. In the Curro liquid jet hydroforming process, a film 1 of a<br>
polymeric material is fed either from a supply roll or from a cast-extrusion station or<br>
die onto the surface of a screen 14 that rotates about a stationary vacuum chamber<br>
16. A high pressure jet 13 of liquid, preferably at least about 800 psig, is directed by<br>
a liquid nozzle 12 at the exposed surface of a substantially smooth, flat film<br>
intermediate a pair of baffles 15 as the web traverses the vacuum chamber. The jet<br>
of liquid 13 typically has a spray radius, a cross-section of which is indicated by the<br>
letter "t" in Figure 1. The jet of liquid causes the smooth flat film to assume the<br>
general contour of the pattern of the woven wire screen (e.g., a knuckle pattern., or<br>
the like) to create a formed film 2. In addition, because the interstices formed by the<br>
intersecting filaments are unsupported, the fluid jet causes rupture at those portions<br>
of the film coinciding with the interstices in the forming structure. The film 1 can be<br>
brought into contact with the surface of screen 14 by roller 10, and the formed film<br>
removed from screen 14 by roller 11. The hydroforming method results in the<br>
formation of micro-apertures having volcano-shaped sidewalls with relatively thin,<br>
irregularly shaped petals about their periphery. The outermost extremities of the<br>
petals are substantially thinner due to the elongation that occurs just prior to rupture<br>
of the film by the high pressure liquid jet.<br>
[0043] Figure 2 is a schematic of a hydroforming jet system in greater detail. For clarity the<br>
screen is not shown, and like reference numerals denote like embodiments. A<br>
plurality of nozzles 12 are shown. Each nozzle typically is fed by a liquid feed<br>
channel, in this case a feed pipe 17. Each feed pipe is fed by a manifold 18 that is<br>
connected to a liquid delivery pipe 19. Figure 3 depicts a liquid jet 13 having a<br><br><br>
pattern footprint and a length. The jewel is the orifice of the nozzle, called "jewel"<br>
because it is typically an insert that is fit into a nozzle frame, and the insert is<br>
typically made of jewels like sapphire, ruby or diamond in order to provide the<br>
nozzle with durability and strength. The footprint of the liquid jet is determined by<br>
the shape of the jewel. An elliptical jewel shape creates an elliptical footprint, a<br>
circular jewel shape creates a circular footprint, and so on. In Figure 3, the length "1"<br>
of the jet pattern represents the major axis of the ellipse and the width of the pattern<br>
"w" represents the minor axis of the ellipse.<br>
[0044] It is known that a typical nozzle delivers liquid jets consisting of liquid droplets.<br>
Each droplet has a mass, direction, and a velocity. As the jet pattern length<br>
increases, the droplets separate and become distinct from each other. Droplets with<br>
a direction substantially parallel to the centerline of the nozzle, or central droplets,<br>
have the highest energy delivery potential. The footprint zone impacted by central<br>
droplets is referred to as the central forming region. As the direction changes, either<br>
away from the centerline in the machine direction, away from the centerline in the<br>
transverse direction, or away from the centerline in various degrees in both<br>
directions, the energy delivery potential of each droplet decreases. One reason for<br>
the loss of energy delivery potential is that as droplets collide with each other some<br>
energy is lost in the collision. Particularly in the area where patterns overlap, the<br>
droplets of one pattern collide with the droplets of another pattern. Since these non-<br>
central, or peripheral, droplets have less kinetic energy anyway, the additional loss<br>
can result in a significant loss of film forming capacity that can create variation in<br>
the characteristics of the formed film. The footprint zone impacted by peripheral<br>
droplets is referred to as the peripheral forming region. "When a plurality of nozzles<br>
are used the individual liquid jet footprints generated by each nozzle combine to<br>
produce a footprint that reflects the type of nozzles selected, and the position of<br>
various nozzles relative to each other and to the screen. Figure 4 illustrates various<br>
footprints labeled A-E, which are described in more detail below:<br>
[0045] A: A footprint created by 4 elliptical shaped jewels with the major axes of each<br>
jewel aligned in a common centerline with the other jewels and in a direction<br><br><br>
parallel to the transverse direction. The patterns overlap in a manner similar to that<br>
shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0046] B: A footprint created by 4 elliptical shaped jewels with the major axes of each<br>
jewel aligned at 45° to a direction that is parallel to the transverse direction. The<br>
central forming regions are located closer together than the central forming regions<br>
in pattern A, therefore the film variation is reduced compared to pattern A.<br>
[0047] C: A footprint created by 4 elliptical shaped jewels with the major axes of each<br>
jewel aligned in a common centerline with the other jewels and in a direction<br>
parallel to the machine direction.<br>
[0048] D: A footprint created by 4 circular shaped jewels with the major axes of each<br>
jewel aligned in a common centerline with the other jewels and in a direction<br>
parallel to the machine direction.<br>
[0049] E: A footprint created by eight elliptical shaped jewels, four aligned with their<br>
major axes in a common centerline and in a direction parallel to the transverse<br>
direction, and the other four aligned with their major axes in a common centerline<br>
and in a direction parallel to the transverse direction. The common centerlines are<br>
parallel and spaced apart in the machine direction by a distance substantially<br>
equivalent to 1/2 the thickness of the pattern footprint, and offset in the transverse<br>
direction by a distance substantially equivalent to 1/2 the width of the pattern<br>
footprint.<br>
[0050] Liquid jet systems are "discretely parallel" systems because increasing the width of a<br>
system only requires addition of nozzles and the corresponding addition of liquid<br>
(i.e., discrete, as compared to continuous, additions). When the nozzle design,<br>
number of nozzles, liquid pressure, and liquid temperature is constant, a system can<br>
deliver a given amount of forming energy. Rearranging the position of the nozzles<br>
does not change the forming energy capacity of the system, it only rearranges how<br>
the energy is delivered - wider footprint at lower line speed or narrower footprint at<br>
higher line speed (Figure 4 A-C). To increase the system's capacity, more nozzles<br>
must be added.<br><br>
[0051] System forming requirements typically are determined by the screen, the material<br>
composition of the film, film temperature and line speed; Once the requirements are<br>
defined, nozzle selection and quantity combinations can be determined to create a<br>
liquid jet system having the appropriate energy delivery capacity. Liquid<br>
temperature affects film temperature. As a result, when it is desired to increase the<br>
productive capacity of a machine, there is no "economy of scale1' - nozzles and liquid<br>
must be added in a number and amount proportional to the desired productivity<br>
increase.<br>
[0052] A limitation of liquid jet systems is that as the number of nozzles increase, liquid<br>
management difficulty increases by the corresponding increase in liquid channels,<br>
liquid manifolds, and manifold design complexity. When the machine can not<br>
accommodate additional nozzles and manifolds the machine forming capacity<br>
becomes constrained.<br>
[0053] Figure 5 is a schematic of a liquid die 100 and film forming system of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention. Unlike the liquid jet systems described previously, the<br>
liquid die system is not a discrete parallel system: rather, it is a continuous parallel<br>
system. Liquid can enter the die cavity 101 at one or a plurality of liquid feed<br>
channels 17 served from a common or multiple manifolds (see, Figure 6B). Liquid<br>
exits the die cavity and passes through the film coincident with perforations in the<br>
forming screen 14. Alternatively or in combination, liquid may exit the die 100<br>
through channels in the leading and trailing walls of the die. The leading wall is the<br>
wall aligned in the transverse direction that is positioned upstream of the trailing<br>
wall, and the trailing wall is the wall aligned in the transverse direction that is<br>
position downstream of the leading wall.<br>
[0054] In Figure 5, a film 1 of a polymeric material is fed either from a supply roll or from a<br>
cast-extrusion station onto the surface of a screen 14 that rotates about a stationary<br>
vacuum chamber 16. A continuously supplied mass of liquid, preferably water, is<br>
directed by a liquid die 100 at the exposed surface of a substantially smooth, flat film<br>
intermediate a pair of baffles 15 as the web traverses the vacuum chamber. The<br>
liquid pressure causes the smooth flat film to assume the pattern of indentations and<br><br><br>
perforations in the screen 14. Subsequently the formed film 2 is removed from the<br>
screen, dried and wound.<br>
[0055] Figure 6A is a cross-section lateral view of the liquid die 100 of an embodiment of<br>
the invention, and Figure 6B is a cross-section top view of the die 100, highlighting<br>
a preferred embodiment that utilizes a plurality of liquid feed channels 17.<br>
[0056] Figure 7 is a cross-section of a preferred embodiment of a liquid die 100 of the<br>
invention. Liquid enters the die through liquid feed channels 17 and impacts a first<br>
liquid profiling block 102 that directs a first liquid mass generally in the direction of<br>
the leading die wall. While not intending on being bound by any theory, the<br>
inventors believe that water fills the rear cavity, defined by the first and second<br>
profiling blocks 102,103, together with the die wall that faces away from the screen.<br>
The filled rear cavity receives additional water and equalizes water conditions along<br>
the entire length of the rear cavity. A second water mass then passes between the<br>
parallel surfaces of the profiling blocks 102, 103, and into the front cavity 101 of the<br>
die propelled by the pressure in the rear cavity. It is believed that the second water<br>
mass has less velocity than the first water mass. The front cavity 101 is defined by<br>
the first and second profiling blocks 102, 103, together with the leading and trailing<br>
die walls, and the die opening.<br>
[0057] The die is positioned such that the leading, trailing, and side walls are positioned in<br>
close proximity to the film passing by it, so that liquid will continue to enter the<br>
front cavity at a faster rate than it leaves it, thereby filling the front cavity. It is<br>
: believed that as additional liquid mass enters the front cavity, pressure is built up and<br>
liquid mass begins to exert pressure on the passing film. Once pressure increases<br>
sufficiently, the film begins to aperture. Alternatively if it is not desired that the film<br>
aperture then liquid will be permitted to exit by controlling the distance between the<br>
die and the film, or by controlling liquid exit channels built into the trailing die wall.<br>
Pressure on the film is exerted over the entire width of the cavity 101, which causes<br>
the film forming process over the entire cavity 101 width. The inventors believe that<br>
pressure would be higher at the top portion of cavity 101 than the bottom portion<br>
(i.e., the leading die wall has a higher pressure). This would cause film to rupture at<br><br>
the top and continue deformation as the web passes over the bottom portion of the<br>
cavity 101.<br>
[0058] Given the particular design of the fluid die of the invention, the inventors believe<br>
that fluid may enter the fluid die and exit without first filling the front cavity of the<br>
die. That is, the pressure exerted by the incoming fluid may be sufficient to force the<br>
fluid out of the die and aperture the film.<br>
[0059] A person skilled in the art will recognize how to vary the die width to extend the<br>
length of time that liquid mass applies pressure onto film —called "dwell-time." As<br>
a result of the improved design, the forming capacity is no longer limited by the<br>
nozzle design, by the number of nozzles, or by the space available to add manifolds<br>
and liquid feed channels. Instead, forming capacity is controlled by the die design<br>
and the water supply. Figure 8 depicts two pressure footprints from liquid die<br>
cavities 101 of equal length, with footprint A having a narrower width and footprint<br>
B having a wider width. The dark areas show areas of higher water pressure and the<br>
light areas show areas of less pressure. The arrows indicate direction of film<br>
movement. At equal line speeds, footprint A has a shorter dwell-time than footprint<br>
B, therefore it has less forming capacity.<br>
[0060] Adjustable profiling blocks preferably are employed as shown in Figure 9 to make<br>
the die 100 even more practical. Profiling blocks as shown can be positioned nearer<br>
or further away from the film, and can be locked into position by block locking bolts<br>
93. In addition, a liquid channel feed control bolt 94 is shown that can be used to<br>
throttle liquid flow through a liquid feed channel. As the die length increases,<br>
producing even flow though all the liquid flow channels becomes increasingly<br>
difficult to predict and manage, therefore the feed control bolts enable on-line<br>
adjustments to facilitate operation. The die shown in Figure 9 is comprised of two<br>
parts, the upper die block 91 and the lower die block 92. Both die blocks are secured<br>
together to form a liquid die 100.<br>
[0061] Figure 10 illustrates a preferred integral liquid die 100 of the invention comprising<br>
built-in liquid feed channels 96 and a built-in manifold 95. The arrows indicate<br>
points of liquid supply. Although the manifold and liquid feed channels are shown<br><br><br>
to have constant width and to bend at right angles, a main advantage of an integral<br>
liquid die is that the channels can be made of continuously varying diameter or<br>
cross-section, and can easily be built at any number of bending radiuses. The<br>
flexibility of the integral liquid die enables design to minimize energy losses through<br>
the die, and facilitates thermal insulation.<br>
[0062] Other embodiments of the invention are illustrated in Figures 11, 12, and 13. Figure<br>
11 illustrates a fluid die 100 having relatively uniformly positioned profiling blocks.<br>
These profiling blocks provide relatively uniform pressure across the entire width of<br>
the cavity 101. Figure 12 illustrates a fluid die 100 having profile blocks configured<br>
to provide higher pressure at the lower portion of cavity 101. In Figure 12, the upper<br>
profiling block has a triangular cross-section, whereas the cross-section of the lower<br>
profiling block has more of a pentagon shape. Figure 13 illustrates a fluid die 100<br>
that is essentially the reverse of Figure 12. In Figure 13, the lower profiling block<br>
102 is triangular shaped directing fluid flow to the upper portion of cavity 101,<br>
whereas the upper profiling block 103 has more of a pentagon shape. The<br>
embodiment depicted in Figure 13 provides higher pressure at the upper portion of<br>
cavity 101, or at the leading wall of fluid die 100.<br>
[0063] Usually the film of the invention is made from a polymer, such as polyethylene, e.g.,<br>
low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) or a<br>
mixture of LDPE and LLDPE, polypropylene, and combinations thereof. In one<br>
embodiment the film is made from a mixture of at least about 10% by weight, or<br>
about 10% to about 50% by weight of medium density polyethylene (MDPE) and the<br>
remainder LDPE, LLDPE or a blend of LDPE and LLDPE. The film may also be<br>
made from a mixture of at least 10% by weight, or about 10% to about 50% by<br>
weight of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and the remainder LDPE, LLDPE or a<br>
blend of LDPE and LLDPE. Each of the material formulations can include<br>
additional materials, usually in small percentages relative to the polymer, for<br>
example processing aids, colorants (e.g. whiteners), surfactants, and other known<br>
additives and adjuvants.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
[0064] A 0.001 inch thick flat polyethylene film was formed at a line speed of 150 feet per<br>
minute using the liquid the shown in Figure 7. The liquid used was water, at 175°<br>
Fahrenheit and 130 psi. The die length was 11.5 inches wide. The screen used had a<br>
hexagonal pattern of circular perforations made by metal punching, the screen<br>
having the following dimensions: 0.062 in. diameter holes; 0.036 in. thick; 60<br>
degree array and 41% open area. The die was capable of suitable making a formed<br>
film that essentially mirrored the shape of the screen.<br>
