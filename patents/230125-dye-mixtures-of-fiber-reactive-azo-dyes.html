				<td>BLACK DYE MIXTURES OF FIBER REACTIVE AZO DYES AND USE THEREOF<br>
FOR DYEING MATERIAL CONTAINING HYDROXY-AND/OR CARBOXAMIDO<br>
GROUPS<br>
The present invention relates to the feld of fiber-reactive dyes. It describes black<br>
mixtures of fiber-reactive dyestuffs and use thereof for dyeing hydroxy- and/or<br>
carboxamido-containing fiber materia.<br>
Various patent documents disclose dye mixtures of fiber reactive dyes and their<br>
use for dyeing hydroxy- and/or carboxamido-containing fiber material in black<br>
shades. Examples are US 5,445,654 and US 5,611,821, KR 94-2560 and Sho 58-<br>
160362. However the dyeing properties of these dye mixtures in view of special<br>
application methods, as well as their aoplicability to fiber material and the<br>
fastness properties of the dyed material, are in need of improvement in some<br>
instances. Additionally most known mixtures of reactive dyestuffs have to be dyed<br>
in the presence of 50 to 100 g/l of electrolyte salts. The patent documents WO<br>
98/42784, WO 98/42785, WO 93/18224 and US 5,330,539 describe dyes which<br>
can be dyed in the presence of low amounts of salt but in the absence of salt they<br>
give dyeings having only very poor color strengths.<br>
As due to ecological and economic reasons the contamination of dye-house<br>
waste-water has to be reduced there is a demand for reactive dyestuffs, which are<br>
applicable in the presence of low amounts or even in the absence of electrolyte<br>
salts giving dyeings of a high color strength.<br>
It has now been found that mixtures comprising reactive dyes of formula (I) and<br>
(II) meet these requirements.<br>
The present invention thus provides dye mixtures comprising one or more<br>
reactive dyes of the general formula (I)<br><br><br>

contained in the mixture in a mixing ratio of 10 to 70% by weight, preferably in a<br>
mixing ration of 90% :10% by weight to 40%:60% by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the 3 present invention may also comprise one or more<br>
red monoazo dye of the general formulae (14) or (15) in up to 10 % by weight<br><br>
where M and D2 are each as destined above. Particularly preferably D2 is 4-(2-<br>

and (15) can be synthesised by the standard methology, or are partly formed during<br>
the synthesis of compound (I). They are generally added as shading components.<br>
Dyestuffs of formula (I) are known from EP-A-1046677 and dyestuffs of formula<br>
(II) are well known from KR 84-2785, EP-A-08311, DE-A-3915305, US<br>
5,349,057, WO 9963005-A1, EP-B-0557841, EP-B-0808343 , US 823,926, DE-A-<br>
1 265 698, DE-A-19 43 904, F R 2 019 394.CA-A-519 978.<br>
The dye mixtures of the invention can be prepared in solid or in liquid (dissolved)<br>
form. In solid form they generally contain the electrolyte salts customary in the<br>
case of water-soluble and in particular fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium<br>
chloride, potassium chloride .and sodium sulfate, and also assistants customary in<br>
commercial dyes, such as biffer substances capable of establishing a pH in<br>
aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium borate,<br><br>
sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrato, sodium dihydrogenphosphate and<br>
disodiumhydrogenphosphate, smell amounts of siccatives or if, they are present<br>
in liquid, aqueous solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type<br>
customary in print pastes), substances which ensure the permanence of these<br>
preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
In general, the dye mixtures will take the form of dye powders containing from 10<br>
to 80 % by weight, based on the dye powder or preparation, of a strength-<br>
standardizing colorless diluent electrolyte salt. These dye powders may in<br>
addition contain the abovementioned buffer substances in a total amount of up to<br>
10%, based on the dye powder If the dye mixtures of the invention are present in<br>
aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions is up to about<br>
50 % by weight, for example between 5 and 50 % by weight, the electrolyte salt<br>
content of these aqueous solutions preferably being below 10 % by weight, based<br>
on the aqueous solution; the acueous solutions (liquid preparations) can in<br>
general contain the abovement oned buffer substances in an amount of up to 5 %<br>
by weight, preferably up to 2 % by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures of this invention can be obtained in a conventional manner, for<br>
instance by mechanically mixing the individual dyes in solid form or in form of<br>
aqueous solutions in the requied proportions, or by synthesis by means of the<br>
customary diazotization and coupling reactions using appropriate mixtures of a<br>
diazo and the coupling components in a manner familiar to those skilled in the art<br>
and the necessary proportion;;.<br>
Thus, if the diazo components with the groups D1 and D21 according to the<br>
general formulae (I) and (II) a-e the same (D1 = D21), one option is for example to<br>
prepare aqueous suspensions of a mixture of a red monoazo dye according to the<br>
general formula (14) with the meanings of M and D2 described above, and an<br>
optionally N-substituted 2-Arr ino-7-surfo-5-naphthol or 2-Amino-6-sulfo-8-<br>
naphthol as coupling comporents, then coupling in a one-pot reaction with a<br>
diazotised aniline or naphthy amine compound of the formula D1 - NH2, with the<br>
meanings of D1 described above, at a pH between 4 and 8 forming a mixture of<br>
disazo dyes conforming to the formula (I) and monoazo dyes conforming to the<br>
formula (II)<br><br>
The final dyestuff can be isolated from the solution in the conventional manner, for<br>
example by salting out with an electrolyte salt, such as sodium chloride or potassium<br>
chloride, or by spray-drying.<br>
The red monoazo-dyes of general formulae (14) can be prepared by diazotizing an<br>
amino compound D2 - NH2, with the meanings of D2 described above, in a<br>
conventional manner in a strongl/ acid medium and then carrying out the first<br>
coupling reaction of 1-amino-8-naphthol-3,6-disulfonic acid or 1-amino-8-naphthol-<br>
4,6-disulfonic acid with the diazo component at a pH below 2.<br>
Dye mixtures in which the dye chromophores contain for example not only a<br>
-chloroethylsulfonyl or -thiosulfatoethylsulfonyl or (l-suifatoethylsulfonyl group but<br>
also proportions with vinylsulfonyl groups cannot only be prepared by the above<br>
mentioned method using approoriate vinylsulfonyl starting anilines or<br>
naphthylamines, but also by reacting the dye mixture in which Z is a -chloroethyl, -<br>
thiosulfatoethyl, or -sulfatoeth/l group with an amount of alkali required for only part<br>
of these groups and converting partly said -substituted ethylsulfonyl groups into<br>
vinylsulfonyl groups. This procedure is carried out by generally known methods of<br>
converting -substituted ethylsulfonyl groups into the vinylsulfonyl group.<br>
The solution of the dye mixtures according to the invention obtained during<br>
synthesis of their individual azo dyes can also be used for dyeing directly as a<br>
liquid preparation, if appropria:e after addition of a buffer substance and if<br>
appropriate also after concentration or dilution.<br>
The reactive dye mixtures according to the invention have fiber-reactive<br>
properties and possess very good dye properties. They can therefore be used for<br>
dyeing hydroxyl- and/or carbcxamido-containing material, especially fiber<br>
material, paper and also leather.<br>
The present invention therefc re also provides for the use of the inventive dye<br>
mixtures for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials,<br>
or methods for their application on these substrates. This includes mass<br>
coloration, for example films composed of polyamide. and printing. The materials<br><br>
are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials, especially in the form of<br>
textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yams;, as in the form of hanks or wound<br>
packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example<br>
cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers,<br>
such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for<br>
example staple viscose and filament viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materia s are for example synthetic and natural<br>
polyamides and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool<br>
and other animal hairs, silk, leather, nyIon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The inventive reactive dye mixtures can be applied to and fixed on the substrates<br>
mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques<br>
known for water-soluble dyes, especially fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
For instance, on cellulose fibem they produce by the exhaust method from a long<br>
liquor using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts, such as<br>
sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good color yields and<br>
excellent color build-up combined with high fixation yields. Dyeing is earned out in<br>
an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and 105°C, optionally at<br>
temperatures of up to 120°C under superatmospheric pressure, and optionally in<br>
the presence of customary dye.-ing auxiliaries. One possible procedure is to<br>
introduce the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat the bath to the<br>
desired dyeing temperature and to complete the dyeing process at that<br>
temperature. The neutral salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the inventive<br>
reactive dye mixtures may also, if desired, only be added to the bath after the<br>
actual dyeing temperature has been reached.<br>
However, the inventive reactive dye mixtures are also very useful for saltless or<br>
low-salt dyeing and can thus he dyed for example without any salt at low depth of<br>
shade, with very little salt such as not more than 5 g/l electrolyte salt at medium<br><br>
depth of shade and with not more than 10 g/l electrolyte salt at higher depths of<br>
shade, and in all cases strong dyeings are obtained.<br>
Low depths of shade for the purposes of this invention are depths of shade<br>
involving not more than 2 percent by weight of dye being used, based on the<br>
substrate. Medium depths of shaoe are to be understood as meaning more than 2<br>
to not more than 4 percent by weight of dye and higher depths of shade are to be<br>
understood as meaning more than 4 to not more than 10 percent by weight of<br>
dye, based on the substrate.<br>
This provides for partly distinct reductions not only of the effluent loading of<br>
dyehouse wastewaters but also of the associated costs.<br>
The padding process likewise provides excellent color yields coupled with high<br>
fixation yields and very good color build-up on cellulose fibers, the dye mixture<br>
being allowed to become fixed an the material by batching at room temperature or<br>
at elevated temperature, for example at up to approximately 60°C, by steaming or<br>
using dry heat in a conventional manner.<br>
Similarly, the customary printirg processes for cellulose fibers, which can be<br>
carried out either single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste<br>
comprising sodium carbonate or some other acid-binding agent and a reactive<br>
dye-mixture of the invention and by subsequent steaming at 100 to 103°C, or two-<br>
phase, for example by printing with print paste comprising a neutral or weakly<br>
acidic print colour and subsecuent fixation either by passing the printed material<br>
through a hot electrolyte-comorising alkaline bath or by overpadding with an<br>
alkaline electrolyte-comprising padding liquor with subsequent batching of the<br>
alkali-overpadded material or subsequent steaming or subsequent treatment with<br>
dry heat, produce strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white<br>
ground. The outcome of the prints is not greatly affected by variations in the fixing<br>
conditions.<br>
The fixation yields obtained with the inventive reactive dye mixtures are very high<br>
not only in dyeing but also in printing.<br><br>
When fixing by means of dry heat n accordance with the customary thermofix<br>
processes, hot air from 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam<br>
at 101 to 103°C it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure<br>
steam at temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the inventive reactive dye<br>
mixtures on the cellulose fibers include for example water-soluble basic salts of<br>
the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids and<br>
likewise compounds which liberate alkali in the heat. Especially suitable are the<br>
alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or<br>
organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the sodium and<br>
potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents include for example sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium<br>
hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate, waterglass or trisodium phosphate.<br>
Treating the inventive dye mixtures with the acid-binding agents with or without<br>
heating, binds the dyes chemically to the cellulose fiber. Cellulose dyeings in<br>
particular, following the custorr ary aftertreatment by rinsing to remove unfixed dye<br>
portions exhibit very good wet fastnesses, in particular since such unfixed dye<br>
portions are easily washed off on account of their good solubility in cold water.<br>
Dyeings on polyurethane and polyamide fibers are customarily carried out from an<br>
acidic medium. For instance, the dyebath may include acetic acid and/or<br>
ammonium sulfate and/or acetic acid and ammonium acetate or sodium acetate<br>
in order to obtain the desired oH. To achieve useful levelness for the dyeing, it is<br>
advisable to add customary leveling aids, for example based on a reaction<br>
product of cyanuric chloride with three times the molar amount of an<br>
aminobenzenesulfonic acid aid/or an aminonaphthaienesulfonic acid or based on<br>
a reaction product of for example stearylamine vvith ethylene oxide. Generally the<br>
material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a temperature of about 40°C,<br>
agitated therein for some tirm, and the dyebath is then adjusted to the desired<br>
weakly acidic pH. preferably with acetic acid, and the actual dyeing is carried out<br><br>
at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the dyeings can also be carried<br>
out at boiling point or at temperatures of up to 120°C (under pressure).<br>
The dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber materials in particular, as already<br>
mentioned, have high color strength, good light- and wet fastnesses and also<br>
good hot press and crock fastnessses. Particularly noteworthy are the high yields<br>
of fixation obtainable on celluloso fiber materials, which can be above 90%, and<br>
also the very good color build-up, including the exhaust method using reduced<br>
neutral salt quantities or dispensing with salt altogether, depending on the depth<br>
of shade, i.e., depending on the amount of dye used. A further advantage of the<br>
inventive reactive dye mixtures is the ease with which portions unfixed in the<br>
printing or dyeing process are washed off, as a result of which the wash of the<br>
printed or dyed cellulose fiber materials can be accomplished with smaller<br>
amounts of wash liquor and, as the case may be, energy-saying temperature<br>
control during the wash.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and<br>
percentages are by weight, uniess otherwise stated. Parts by weight relate to<br>
parts by volume as the kilogram relates to the liter. The compounds described in<br>
the examples in terms of a formula are indicated in the form of the sodium salts<br>
as in general they are prepared and isolated in the form of their alkali metal salts,<br>
such as lithium, sodium or potassium salts, and used for dyeing in the form of this<br>
salts. The starting compounds, and components mentioned in the form of the free<br>
acid in the examples hereinbelow may be used in the synthesis as such or<br>
similarly in the form of their saits, preferably alkali metal salts.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
85 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder which contains the navy-dyeing<br>
disazo dye of the formula (lA)<br><br>
in a proportion of 70% are mechanically mixed with 15 parts of an electrolyte-<br>
containing dye powder which contains the orange-dyeing monoazo dye of the<br>
formula (HA) in a 75% proportion<br><br>
The resulting dye mixture according to the invention, when employed according to<br>
the application and fixing methods customary in the art for fiber-reactive dyes,<br>
produces for example on cellulose fiber materials dyeings and prints in deep black<br>
shades.<br>
Example 2<br>
80 parts of an electrolyte-containing dye powder which contains the navy-dyeing<br>
disazo dye of the formula (1A in a proportion of 75% and 20 parts of an electrolyte-<br>
containing dye powder which contains the orange-dyeing monoazo dye of the<br>
formula (HA) in a 60% proportion are dissolved in 700 parts of water and the resulting<br>
dye solution is adjusted to pH 5.5 - 6.5. Evaporating this solution affords a dye<br>
mixture which produces deep black shades on cellulosic materials when employed<br><br>
according to the application and fixing methods customary in the art for fiber-reactive<br>
dyes.<br>
Example 3<br>
a)	A suspension of 281 parts of 4-(fi-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)-aniline in 650 parts of ice-<br>
water and 180 parts of 30 % aqueous hydrochloric acid is diazotized with 173 parts<br>
of 40% strength aqueous sodiurr, nitrite solution. 319 parts of 1-amino-8-napthol-3,6-<br>
disulfonic acid are added and the first coupling forming a red monoazo dye according<br>
to the general formula (14) is carried out at a pH between 1 and 1.3 and at a<br>
temperature below 20°C. Durinc the reaction the pH is maintained with about 140<br>
parts of sodium bicarbonate.<br>
b)	In a separate vessel to a suspension of 500 parts of 4-amino-N-(3-(-<br>
sulfatoethylsulfonyl)-phenyl)-benzamide in 2750 parts of ice-water, adjusted to pH<br>
6.5-7 with about 90 parts of sodium carbonate, are added 217 parts of 40% strength<br>
aqueous sodium nitrite solution. This suspension is pumped into a slurry of 780 parts<br>
of ice, 630 parts ice-water and 450 parts concentrated hydrochloric acid. After stirring<br>
for 2 hours at 5-10°C excess r itrite is destroyed using sulfamic acid and the resulting<br>
diazo suspension is pumped into solution (a). Immediately afterwards 70 parts of 6-<br>
acetylamino-1-hydroxynaphth alene-3-sulfonic acid are added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The pH is raised to 5-6 by addition of sodium carbonate at a temperature below 25°C<br>
and after the coupling is complete the 85:15 mixture of the dyes (IB)jand (IIB) is<br>
isolated by spray-drying.<br>
Alternatively the obtained dye solution can be buffered at pH 5.5 - 6 by adding a<br>
sodium phosphate buffer. By further diluting with water or by evaporating the<br>
solution, this liquid dye mixture can then be standardized to the desired strength for a<br>
liquid preparation.<br>
The dye mixture affords deep black shades on cellulosic materials.<br><br><br>
