				<td>MODULATORS OF MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS<br>
CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
[001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application no. 60/602,731, filed on<br>
August 19,2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The present invention relates to modulators of muscarinic receptors. The present invention<br>
also provides compositions comprising such modulators, and methods therewith for treating<br>
muscarinic receptor mediated diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] The neurotransmitter acetylcholine binds to two types of cholinergic receptors: the<br>
ionotropic family of nicotinic receptors and the metabotropic family of muscarinic receptors.<br>
Muscarinic receptors belong to the large superfamily of plasma membrane-bound G protein<br>
coupled receptors (GPCRs). To date, five subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1-M5) have been<br>
cloned and sequenced from a variety of species, and show a remarkably high degree of homology<br>
across species and receptor subtype. These M1-M5 muscarinic receptors are predominantly<br>
expressed within the parasympathetic nervous system which exerts excitatory and inhibitory control<br>
over the central and peripheral tissues and participate in a number of physiologic functions,<br>
including heart rate, arousal, cognition, sensory processing, and motor control.<br>
[004] Muscarinic agonists such as muscarine and pilocarpine, and antagonists, such as atropine<br>
have been known for over a century, but little progress has been made in the discovery of receptor<br>
subtype-selective compounds, thereby making it difficult to assign specific functions to the<br>
individual receptors. See, e.g., DeLapp, N. et ah, "Therapeutic Opportunities for Muscarinic<br>
Receptors in the Central Nervous System," J. Med. Chem., 43(23), pp. 4333-4353 (2000); Hulme,<br>
E. C. etal., "Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes," Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol, 30, pp. 633-673<br>
(1990); Caulfield, M. P. et ah, "Muscarinic Receptors-Characterization, Coupling, and Function,"<br>
Pharmacol. Ther., 58, pp. 319-379 (1993); Caulfield, M. P. et al, International Union of<br>
Pharmacology. XVII. Classification of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors," Pharmacol. Rev., 50,<br>
pp. 279-290 (1998), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[005] The Muscarinic family of receptors is the target of a large number of pharmacological<br>
agents used for various diseases, including leading drugs for COPD, asthma, urinary incontinence,<br>
glaucoma, Alzheimer's (AchE inhibitors). Despite the large therapeutic value of this family,<br>
cholinergic drugs are limited by the lack of selectivity of these agents, with significant activation of<br>
the parasympathetic autonomous system and elevated incidence of adverse effects. The molecular<br>
cloning of the muscarinic receptors and the identification of the physiological role of specific<br><br>
isoforms using knock-out mice, nas recently delineated novel opportunities for selective muscarinic<br>
ligands, and has helped to define the selectivity profile that is required for enhanced efficacy and<br>
reduced side effects.<br>
[006] There is a need for modulators of muscarinic receptors M1-M5. There is also a need for<br>
methods for treating muscarinic receptor-mediated diseases.<br>
[007] There is also a need for modulators of muscarinic receptors that are selective as to<br>
subtypes M1-M5.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[022] As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated.<br>
I.	DEFINITIONS<br><br>
[023] As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated, for<br>
purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic<br>
Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed. Additionally,<br>
general principles of organic chemistry are described in "Organic Chemistry", Thomas Sorrell,<br>
University Science Books, Sausolito: 1999, and "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry", 5th Ed.,<br>
Ed.: Smith, M.B. and March, J., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York: 2001, the entire contents of which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[024] The term "muscarinic receptor," without a prefix specifylng the receptor subtype, refers to<br>
one or more of the five receptor subtypes M1-M5.<br>
[025] The term "modulating" as used herein mean's increasing or decreasing, e.g. activity, by a<br>
measurable amount. Compounds that modulate muscarinic activity by increasing the activity of the<br>
muscarinic receptors are called agonists. Compounds that modulate muscarinic activity by<br>
decreasing the activity of the muscarinic receptors are called antagonists. An agonist interacts with<br>
a muscarinic receptor to increase the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in<br>
response to endogenous ligand binding. An antagonist interacts with a muscarinic receptor and<br>
competes with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor to<br>
decrease the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to endogenous<br>
ligand binding.<br>
[026] The phrase "treating or reducing the severity of a muscarinic receptor mediated disease"<br>
refers both to treatments for diseases that are directly caused by muscarinic activities and<br>
alleviation of symptoms of diseases not directly caused by muscarinic activities. Examples of<br>
diseases whose symptoms may be affected by muscarinic activity include, but are not limited to,<br>
CNS derived pathologies including cognitive disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder<br>
(ADHD), obesity, Alzheimer's disease, various dementias such as vascular dementia, psychosis<br>
including schizophrenia, mania, bipolar disorders, pain conditions including acute and chronic<br>
syndromes, Huntington's Chorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Downs<br>
Syndrome, Pick disease, clinical depression, Parkinson's disease, peripheral disorders such as<br>
'reduction of intra ocular pressure in Glaucoma and treatment of dry eyes and dry mouth including<br>
Sjogren's Syndrome, bradhycardia, gastric acid secretion, asthma, GI disturbances and wound<br>
healing.<br>

than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected<br>
from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. A ring<br>
substituent, such as a heterocycloalkyl, may be bound to another ring, such as a cycloalkyl, to form<br>
a spiro-bicyclic ring system, e.g., both rings share one common atom. As one of ordinary skill in<br>

some embodiments, a stable compound or chemically feasible compound is one that is not<br>
substantially altered when kept at a temperature of 40 °C or less, in the absence of moisture or other<br>
chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.<br>
[081] As used herein, an effective amount is defined as the amount required to confer a<br>
therapeutic effect on the treated patient, and is typically determined based on age, surface area,<br>
weight, and condition of the patient. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans<br>
(based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described by Freireich et al., Cancer<br>
Chemother. Rep., 50: 219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately determined from<br>
height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, New<br>
York, 537 (1970). As used herein, "patient" refers to a mammal, including a human.<br>

available starting materials using methods known in the art. Exemplary synthetic routes to<br>
produce compounds of formulae (I and II), are provided below in Preparations A-F and Schemes<br>
1-10. For simplicity of illustration, schemes 1-10 depict only a single R1 substituent on the<br>
fused phenyl ring of formulae I and II, the compounds of this invention may include 1 to 4 R1<br>
substituents on the fused phenyl ring.<br>
[0155] Scheme 1 below depicts general conditions for the synthesis of compounds of formula<br>
(I)-<br><br><br>
[0156] The reaction of amine (A) with an appropriate aldehyde or ketone under reductive<br>
amination conditions (step a), typically using NaBH(OAc)3 in DCE/AcOH/TEA at room<br>
temperature, may be used to provide the desired compounds of formula I. For less reactive<br>
ketones, more forcing conditions may be used. For example, the treatment of the amine (A) and<br>
the ketone in a neat solution of Ti(OiPr)4, followed by treatment with NaBH4 in MeOH, may be<br>
used to provide the desired compounds of formula I. See Abdel-Magid, A.F. et al., "Reductive<br>
Amination of Aldehydes and Ketones with Sodium Triacetoxyborohydride. Studies on Direct<br>
and Indirect Reductive Amination Procedures," J. Org. Chem., 61, pp. 3849-3862 (1996) and<br>
the references sited therein.<br>
[0157] Alternatively, the of spiroamine of type A may be alkylated with an alkyl halide in the<br>
presence of an appropriate base to provide the desired compounds of formula I. Typically, the<br>
amine (A) is reacted with an alkyl iodide, bromide, or chloride in the presence of an appropriate<br>
base to yleld compounds of formula I. Bases may be organic such as triethylamine, or inorganic<br>
such as Na2CO3 or Cs2CO3. Typical reaction solvents include but are not limited to DMF,<br>
acetone, and acetonitrile.<br>

the compounds of the present invention. A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" means any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester, or other derivative of a compound of the<br>
present invention which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (directly or<br>
indirectly) a compound of this invention or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Preferred<br>
prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when<br>
such compounds are administered to a mammal or which enhance delivery of the parent<br>
compound to a biological compartment relative to the parent species.<br>
[0176] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle" refers to a non-toxic<br>
carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle that does not destroy the pharmacological activity of the compound<br>
with which it is formulated. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that<br>
may be used in the compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers,<br>
alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer<br>

acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used<br>
surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifylng agents or bioavailability enhancers<br>
which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or<br>
other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.<br>
[0181] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be orally<br>
administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules,<br>
tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly<br>
used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also<br>
typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and<br>
dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is<br>
combined with emulsifylng and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or<br>
coloring agents may also be added.<br>
[0182] Alternatively, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be<br>
administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by<br>
mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at room temperature but<br>
liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such<br>
materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
[0183] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be<br>
administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily<br>
accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
[0184] Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository<br>
formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may<br>
also be used.<br>
[0185] For topical applications, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be<br>
formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one<br>
or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol,<br><br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifylng wax and water. Alternatively, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream<br>
containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan<br>
monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl<br>
alcohol and water.<br>
[0186] For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated as<br>
micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in<br>
isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a preservative such as benzylalkonium<br>
chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may<br>
be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
[0187] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be<br>
administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as<br>
solutions in saline, employlng benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption<br>
promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
[0188] Most preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention are<br>
formulated for oral administration.<br>
[0189] The amount of the compounds of the present invention that may be combined with the<br>
carrier materials to produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the<br>
host treated, the particular mode of administration. Preferably, the compositions should be<br>
formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of the modulator can<br>
be administered to a patient receiving these compositions.<br>
[0190] It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any<br>
particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate<br>
of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of<br>
the particular disease being treated. The amount of a compound of the present invention in the<br>
composition will also depend upon the particular compound in the composition.<br>
[0191] Depending upon the particular condition, or disease, to be treated or prevented,<br>
additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat or prevent that condition,<br>
may also be present in the compositions of this invention. As used herein, additional therapeutic<br><br>
[0198] According to an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method of<br>
treating or reducing the severity of a disease in a patient, wherein said disease is selected from<br>
pain, psychosis (including schizophrenia, hallucinations, and delusions), Alzheimer's disease,<br>
Parkinson's disease, glaucoma, bradhycardia, gastric acid secretion, asthma, or GI disturbances.<br>
[0199] According to a preferred embodiment, the present invention is useful for treating or<br>
reducing the severity of psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, pain, or Parkinson's disease.<br>

Vn. PREPARATIONS AND EXAMPLES<br>
[0201] In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the following<br>
examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes<br>
only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner.<br>
Preparation A: Synthesis of iV-(ethoxycarbonyl)-8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1 ]octane-3-carbaldehyde<br><br>
[0202] Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (6 mmol, 6 mL of 1 M solution in THF) was added to a<br>
suspension of 2.06 g (6.0 mmol) of methoxymethyltriphenylphosphonium chloride in 6 mL of<br>
THF at 0 °C under argon. After stirring at 0 °C for 15 min, the resulting dark red solution was<br>
added via syringe to a solution of 0.79 g (4.0 mmol) of JV-(ethoxycarbonyl)tropinone (6) in 8 mL<br>
of THF at 0 °C and then stirred at room temerature for 4 h (an orange color persisted). The<br>
reaction mixture was quenched by adding sat aq. NaCl (15 mL) and then extracted with ether<br>
(25 mL x 3). The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4. The solid residue<br>
obtained after solvent evaporation was loaded onto a short silica gel column (3.5 cm x 4 cm) to<br>
remove the phosphorous impurities. The product was eluted with ether. After the solvent was<br>
evaporated, the product enol ether was obtained as a brown oil which was used in the next step<br>
without further purification.<br>
[0203] The enol ether intermediate was dissolved in a solution of 12 mL of 2 N HCl and 20 mL<br>
of acetonitrile, and stirred at room temperature for 16 h. After removing the acetonitrile on a<br>
rotary evaporator, the aqueous solution was extracted with ether (25 mL x 3). The combined<br>
organic extracts were washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3 (15 mL x 2), sat. aq. NaCl (15 mL) and then<br>
dried over Na2SO4. After the solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was purified by<br>
chromatography (SiC&gt;2, 10%-20% EtOAc in Hexane as eluent). iV-(ethoxycarbonyl)-8-aza-<br>
bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-3-carbaldehyde (0.65 g) was obtained as a colorless oil in an approximately<br><br>

[0204] Bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carbaldehyde was prepared using an analogous procedure as for<br>
Intermediate 1 from commercially available bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-one. The crude products<br>
were used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Preparation C: Synthesis of 7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-carbaldehyde<br><br>
[0205] To a stirred solution of furan (9) (15 mL, 200 mmol) and acrolein (13) (6.7 mL, 100<br>
mmol) in DCM (25 mL) was slowly added AICI3 (666 mg, 5 mmol) under argon at -43 °C (dry<br>
ice/isopropanol bath). The reaction mixture was stirred at -43 °C under argon for 30 min, and<br>
then quenched with sat. aq. K2CO3 (50 mL). After the reaction mixture was gradually warmed<br>
to room temperature, it was extracted with ether (200 mL x 5). The combined ether extracts<br>
were washed with sat. aq. K2CO3 (200 mL x 2) and sat. aq. NaCl (200 mL x 2), dried over<br>
MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give 2.6 g of oily crude product 7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-<br>
5-ene-2-carbaldehyde which was used in the next step without further purification. See<br>

Functional mobilization of intracellular calcium to determine muscarinic receptor activity:<br>
[0273] CHO cells expressing muscarinic receptors (M1 to Ms) are grown as monolayers in tissue<br>
culture flasks at 37° C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and passaged every 3-5<br>
days. The growth media is Dulbecco's modified eagles medium (DMEM, Gibco Cat# 12430-<br>
054), containing 25 mM Hepes and supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, cat#<br>
SH30071.03), 0.1 mM of MEM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO, Cat# 11140-050), 1 mM<br>
MEM Sodium Pyruvate (GIBCO Cat# 11360-070) and 100 units/ml of Penicillin G and 100<br>
/ig/ml of Streptomycin (GIBCO Cat# 15140-122). The recombinant muscarinic receptor cell<br>
lines are grown under antibiotic pressure with media containing 25 /ig/ml zeocin and 500 /Jg/ml<br>
G418 (Ml-CHO), 4 fig/ml puromycin, 50 /ig/ml zeocin and 2.5 /ig/ml blasticidin (M2 and M4-<br>
CHO) or 50 /ig/ml zeocin and 4 jig/ml puromycin (M3 and M5-CHO).<br>
[0274] Cells are harvested at 80-90% confluence using Versene (GIBCO Cat# 15040-066),<br>
collected by centrifugation and seeded 18-24 hrs prior to running the calcium assay at a density<br>
of 5,000-10,000 cells/well in back-walled, clear-bottomed 384-well plates (BD Biocoat, poly-D-<br>
lysine, Cat#356663). The day of the experiment, the cells are washed with a plate washer<br>
(Bioteck Instruments, ELX 405) using bathl buffer (140-mM NaCl, 4.5-mM KCl,2-mM CaCl2,<br>
1-mM MgCk, 10-mM Hepes-Na, 10-mM Glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH) containing 1 mM<br>
Probenecid. Next, the calcium dye Fluo-3 (25 jd/well of Fluo-3 AM at 4 µM, Molecular Probes<br>
F-1241, in Bath 1 buffer containing 1 mM Probenecid) is added to the 25 µl of Bath 1 remaining<br>
in each well after the plate wash and the dye is loaded at 37°C in the tissue culture incubator for<br>
60-90 min. The fluorescent dye is removed using the plate washer with Bath 1 containing 1 mM<br>
Probenecid, leaving 25 /d/well of this solution after the wash. Alternatively, cells can be loaded<br>
with the calcium indicator from Molecular Devices (Calcium 3 Assay Reagents, Cat # R7181)<br>
adding 5 /tl of a 5X solution dye in Bath 1 containing 1 mM Probenecid (10 ml per dye flask<br>
cat# R7182 to generate a solution 20X) to 20 µl of the same buffer. After loading for 60 min, the<br>
experiment can be run without having to remove the dye.<br>
[0275] Compounds are prepared at a 2x fold concentration in a 96-well plate (round bottom,<br>
Costar Corning cat# 3656), by reconstituting the pre-spotted compounds in bath 1 containing 1<br>
mM probenecid. The final concentration DMSO is 0.5 %, and the amount of DMSO is<br>
normalized across the assay plate. To determine an agonist action of the compounds on<br>
muscarinic receptors, the reconstituted compounds are added (25 µl compound/well) to the cell<br>
assay plate (containing 25 µl/well) using the multi-channel robotic system of the FLIPR 3<br>
Instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine a functional inhibitory action of<br>
the compounds on muscarinic receptors, the reconstituted compounds are added (25 µl<br><br>
compound/well) to the assay plate and pre-incubated for 15 min prior to adding 25 µl of<br>
Carbachol at 3X the EC80 for each muscarinic subtype. Alternatively, the compounds can be<br>
co-applied simultaneously with the agonist. In both assay modes, the fluorescence is recorded<br>
for 60 sec (excitation wavelength is 488 nM and emission wavelength 540 nm) using the FLEPR<br>
3 instrument<br>
[0276] The potency, efficacy and selectivity of the muscarinic compounds were evaluated by<br>
screening the compound activity across the whole family (M1 to M5 cells). Compounds were<br>
also screened for activity on other proteins such as other GPCRs and ion channels to determine<br>
selectivity on M4 receptors.<br>
[0277] The compounds of the present invention were found to modulate the M1 and/or M4<br>
muscarinic receptors selectively over the other receptor types.<br>
[0278] Examples of activities and efficacies of the muscarinic compounds of formulae (I and II)<br>
on modulating M1 and M4 receptors are shown below in Table 2. The compound activity for the <br>
M1 and M4 receptor is illustrated with "xxx" if activity was measured to be less than 0.1 uM,<br>
"xx" if activity was measured to be between 0.1 µM and 1.0 µM, and "x" if activity was<br>
measured to be greater than 1.0 µM. The efficacy for M1 and M4 modulation is illustrated with<br>
"xxx" if efficacy was calculated to be greater than 85 %, "xx" if efficacy was calculated to be<br>
between 85% and 65%, and "x" if efficacy was calculated to be less than 65 %.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
