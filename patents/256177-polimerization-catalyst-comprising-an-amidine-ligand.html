				<td>POLYMERIZATION CATALYST COMPRISING AN AMIDINE LIGAND<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a polymer<br>
comprising at least one aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbyl C2.2o olefin in the presence of<br>
an ionic catalyst comprising an organometallic compound, an activator and optionally a<br>
scavenger. The invention further relates to a new catalyst, a method for the preparation<br>
of this catalyst and polymers prepared with the process of the invention.<br>
A process for the preparation of a polymer comprising at least one<br>
aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbyl C2.2o olefin in the presence of a catalyst, an activator,<br>
and optionally a scavenger is known from US 6,114,481. US 6,114,481 discloses a<br>
process for the copolymerization of ethylene and at least one additional alpha olefin<br>
having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms characterized in that said process employs a catalyst<br>
system for olefin polymerization comprising:<br>
an organometallic complex of a group 4 metal; and<br>
an activator.<br>
A disadvantage of this known process is the relatively low activity of<br>
the catalyst. The aim of the current invention is to provide a process for the preparation<br>
of a polymer with a catalyst having a higher activity than the catalyst in the known<br>
process.<br>
This aim is achieved in that the organometallic compound is a<br>
compound according to formula 1:<br>
MLjX(p.(qv+r))<br>
Yr (formula 1)<br>
where:<br>
M is a metal of group 3 -13 or the lanthanide series, and p is the valency of the metal<br>
M;<br>
A represents a neutral or anionic spectator ligand whose valency v is 0,1 or 2 and q is<br>
an integer denoting the number of spectator ligands A;<br>
Z is an optional bridging moiety, and n is the integer number of parallel bridging<br>
moieties Z; Y is an amidine-containing spectator ligand represented by formula 2:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein the amidine-containing ligand is covalently bonded to the<br>
metal M via the imine nitrogen atom, and Sut^ is a substituent comprising a group 14<br>
atom through which Bub-1 is bonded to the imine carbon atom. Sub2 is a substituent<br>
comprising a heteroatom of group 15-16, through which Sub2 is bonded to the imine<br>
carbon atom;<br>
r is an integer &gt; 0;<br>
L is an optional neutral Lewis basic ligand, and j is an integer denoting the number of<br>
neutral ligands L; and<br>
X is an anionic ligand.<br>
in the process of the invention the activity of the catalyst is<br>
significantly higher than in the known process. An additional advantage is that the<br>
catalyst used in the process of the invention can be manufactured at lower costs than<br>
the catalyst used in the known process.<br>
Processes for the preparation of a polymer of at least one aliphatic or<br>
aromatic hydrocarbyl C2.2o olefin are fairly well known in the art. These processes are<br>
generally conducted by contacting at least one olefinic monomer with a catalyst and<br>
optionally a scavenger in the gas phase or in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon<br>
solvent. Suitable solvents are a C5.12 hydrocarbon which may be substituted by a C^<br>
alkyl group, such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, isomers and mixtures thereof,<br>
cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, pentamethyl heptane and hydrogenated naphtha.<br>
The process of the invention may be conducted at temperatures from about 20° C to<br>
about 250° C, depending on the product being made.<br>
An olefinic monomer is understood to be a molecule containing at<br>
least one polymerizable double bond.<br>
Suitable olefinic monomers are C2.20 olefins. Preferred monomers<br>
include ethylene and C3.12 alpha olefins which are unsubstituted or substituted by up to<br>
two d.6 alkyl radicals, C8.12 vinyl aromatic monomers which are unsubstituted or<br>
substituted by up to two substituents selected from the group consisting of CM alkyl<br>
radicals, and C4.12 straight chained or cyclic hydrocarbyl radicals which are<br>
unsubstituted or substituted by a CM alkyl radical. Illustrative non-limiting examples of<br>
such a-olefins are propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-<br>

The monomer may also be a polyene comprising at least two double<br>
bonds. The double bonds may be conjugated or non-conjugated in chains, ring<br>
systems or combinations thereof, and they may be endocyclic and/or exocyclic and<br>
may have different amounts and types of substituents. This means that the polyene<br>
may comprise at least one aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic group, or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>

(including its isomers).<br>
All of the above-mentioned monomers may be further substituted with<br>

spectator ligands A. The valency v of A is 0, 1, or 2. Examples of monoanions are<br>
carbanions, silylanions, germylanions, amides, phosphides, imines, and chalconides.<br>

like.<br>
The spectator ligand A is preferably an imine ligand, a chalconide, or<br>

cyclopentadienyl group, but in which at least one of the C atoms in the 5-ring of the<br>
cyclopentadienyl has been replaced by a hetero atom, which heteroatom may be<br>
chosen from group 14, 15 or 16. If there is more than one heteroatom present in the 5-<br>
ring of the hetero ligand, these heteroatoms may be the same or different. More<br>
preferably, the heteroatom is chosen from group 15, while yet more preferably the<br>
heteroatom is phosphorus.<br>

thereof. The bridging group Z may consist of linear, cyclic fragments, spiro ring<br>
systems, or combinations thereof. Examples of a carbon containing Z group may be a<br>
hydrocarbon group with 1-20 carbon atoms, e.g. alkylidene, arylidene, biarylene, aryl<br>
alkylidene, etc. Examples of such groups are methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene,<br>
phenylene, naphthylene, biphenylene, binaphthylene. Examples of silicon-containing<br>
groups are dimethylsilyl, diethylsilyl, dipropylsilyl, including its isomers, (substituted)<br>
diphenylsilyl, dimethoxysilyl, diethoxysilyl, dipropoxysilyl, and diphenoxysilyl.<br>
In the organometallic compound used in the process of the invention<br>
Y is an amidine-containing spectator ligand, and r is an integer with r &gt; 0. An amidinecontaining<br>
spectator ligand is a ligand that is represented by formula 2. The amidinecontaining<br>
ligand is covalently bonded to the metal via the imine nitrogen atom. This<br>
means that the imine nitrogen atom of the imine does not have any substituents but the<br>
imine carbon atom. Sub! comprises a group 14 atom through which Sub-i is bonded to<br>
the imine carbon atom. Sub2 comprises a heteroatom of group 15-16, through which<br>
Sub2 is bonded to the imine carbon atom. Preferably this atom is selected from the<br>
group of nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen or sulfur. Subi preferably represents a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical, optionally substituted with heteroatoms of group 13-17, or a silyl<br>
radical, optionally substituted with group 13-17 atoms.<br>
Sub2 preferably is an amide, imide, phosphide, phospinimide, oxide,<br>
sulphide radical, optionally substituted with hydrocarbyl radicals or silyl radicals as<br>
described for Su^. Sub! or Sub2 may be bonded to the bridging moiety Z or may be<br>

In the organometallic compound used in the process of the invention<br>
L is optionally a neutral Lewis basic ligand, and j is an integer denoting the number of<br>
neutral ligands L. The ligand L may be present in the organometallic compound for<br>
reasons of stability. If the ligand L is present, L is an ether, a thioether, a tertiary amine,<br>
a tertiary phosphane, an imine, or a bi-, or oligodentate, comprising an ether, a<br>
thioether, a tertiary amine, or a tertiary phosphane functional group, or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable ethers are tetrahydrofuran and diethylether. Suitable<br>
thioethers are thiophene, diethylsulfide, and dimethylsulfide. Suitable tertiary amines<br>
are trialkylamines, pyridine, bipyridine, TMEDA, and (-)-sparteine). Suitable tertiary<br>
phosphanes are triphenylphoshine, trialkylphosphanes. Suitable of (mines are<br>
ketimines, guanidines, iminoimidazolidines, phosphinimines, amidines and the like.<br>
Suitable bidentate ligands are diimines, alkyl or aryldiphoshanes, dimethoxyethane.<br>
Suitable oligodentate ligands are triimines (such as tris(pyrazolyl)alkanes), cyclic<br>
multidentate ligands comprising heteroatoms of group 13-17, including crown ethers<br>
optionally having heteroatoms of group 13-17, azo-crown ethers optionally having<br>
heteroatoms of group 13-17, phospha-crown ethers optionally having heteroatoms of<br>
group 13-17, crown ethers having combinations of heteroatoms of group 15-16<br>
optionally having heteroatoms of group 13-17 and crown ethers containing<br>
heteroatoms of group 14-17 or combinations thereof.<br>
In the catalyst used in the process of the invention, X is an anionic<br>
ligand. Each anionic ligand, X, bonded to M, may be independently selected from the<br>
group consisting of hydride, halide, alkyl, silyl, germyl, aryl, amide, aryloxy, alkoxy,<br>
phosphide, sulfide, acyl, pseudo halides such as cyanide, azide, and acetylacetonate,<br>
or a combination thereof. Preferably, X is a hydride or a moiety selected from the group<br>
consisting of monoanionic spectator ligands, halide, alkyl, aryl, silyl, germyl, aryloxy,<br>
alkoxy, amide, siloxy and combinations thereof (e.g. alkaryl, aralkyl, silyl substituted<br>
alkyl, silyl substituted aryl, aryloxyalkyl, aryloxyaryl, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyaryl, amidoalkyl,<br>
amidoaryl, siloxyalkyl, siloxyaryl, amidosiloxyalkyl, haloalkyl, haloaryl, etc.) having up to<br>
20 non-hydrogen atoms.<br>
Preferred anionic ligands X include halides and hydrocarbyl anions. A<br>
preferred halide is chloride. In one embodiment of the invention hydrocarbyl groups are<br>
anionically charged hydrocarbyl groups. In addition to the usual definition of a<br>
hydrocarbyl group, in this application a hydrocarbyl group also comprises a hydride<br>
group. The hydrocarbyl groups optionally contain heteroatoms of group 13-17.<br>
Preferred hydrocarbyl groups include hydride, alkyl-, aryl-, aralkyl-, alkaryl-, substituted<br>
vinyl- and substituted allylgroups. More preferred hydrocarbyl groups include hydride,<br>
alkyl-, aryl-, aralkyl- and alkaryl groups. Most preferred hydrocarbyl groups include<br>
alkyl-, aryl-, aralkyl- and alkaryl groups. Examples of such most preferred hydrocarbyl<br>
groups are methyl, benzyl, methyltrimethylsilyl, phenyl, methoxyphenyl,<br>
dimethoxyphenyl, N,N-dimethylaminophenyl, bis (N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl,<br>
fluorophenyl, difluorophenyl, trifluorophenyl, tetrafluoropheny, perfluorophenyl,<br>
trialkylsilylphenyl, bis(trialkylsilyl)phenyl, tris(trialkylsilyl)phenyl and the like.<br>
The number of ligands (X and L) depends on the valency of the metal<br>
.and the stability of the organometallic compound. The organometallic compound may<br>
be monomeric, oligomeric or a cluster. The number of anionic ligands equals the<br>
valency of the metal used. The number of neutral ligands on the organometallic<br>
reagent may range from 0 to the amount that satisfies the 18-electron rule, as known in<br>
the art.<br>
An additional advantage of the process of the invention is that<br>
extremely high molecular weight polyolefins can be prepared. This is particularly<br>
advantageous in a process for the preparation of ultrahigh molecular weight<br>
polyethylene with a weight average molecular weight of more than 400,000 g/mol<br>
(UHMWPE) and for an ethylene/a-olefin polyene copolymer or an ethylene/a-olefin<br>
/non-conjugated polyene terpolymer.<br>
In the process of the invention the catalyst comprises an activator.<br>
Activators for single-site catalysts are fairly well known in the art. These activators often<br>
comprise a group 13 atom, such as boron or aluminium. Examples of these activators<br>
are described in Chem. Rev., 2000, 700, 1391 by E. Y-X. Chen and T.J. Marks. A<br>
preferred activator is a borate, a borane or an alkylaluminoxane<br>
(e.g.methylaluminoxane (MAO)).<br>
In the process of the invention the catalyst optionally comprises a<br>
scavenger. A scavenger is a compound that reacts with impurities present in the<br>
process of the invention, which are poisonous to the catalyst. A scavenger in an<br>
embodiment of the invention can be a hydrocarbyl of a metal or metalloid of group 1-13<br>
or its reaction products with at least one sterically hindered compound containing a<br>
group 15 or 16 atom. Preferably, the group 15 or 16 atom of the sterically hindered<br>
compound bears a proton. Examples of these sterically hindered compounds are tertbutanol,<br>
/so-propanol, triphenylcarbinol, 2,6-di-terf-butylphenol, 4-methyl-2,6-di-ferfbutylphenol,<br>
4-ethyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 2,6-di-terf-butylanilin, 4-methyl-2,6-di-tertbutylanilin,<br>
4-ethyl-2,6-di-teA?-butylanilin, HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane), diisopropylamine,<br>
di-terf-butylamine, diphenylamine and the like. Some non-limiting<br>
examples of scavengers are butyllithium including its isomers,<br>
dihydrocarbylmagnesium, trihydrocarbylaluminium, such as trimethylaluminium,<br>
triethylaluminium, tripropylaluminium (including its isomers), tributylaluminium<br>
(including its isomers) tripentylaluminium (including its isomers), trihexyl aluminium<br>
(including its isomers), triheptyl aluminium (including its isomers), trioctyl aluminium<br>
(including its isomers), hydrocarbylaluminoxanes and hydrocarbylzinc and the like, and<br>
their reaction products with a sterically hindered compound or an acid, such as HF,<br>
HCI, HBr, HI.<br>
The invention further relates to a catalyst for the preparation of a<br>
polyolefin.<br>
Catalysts for the preparation of polyolefins are known from US<br>
6,114,481. In US 6,114,481 a catalyst system is disclosed that comprises an<br>
organometallic complex containing a ketimine ligand. The disadvantage of this catalyst<br>
is its low activity in olefin polymerization. An example of a catalyst comprising a special<br>
ketimine is the iminoimidazolidine comprising catalyst described in WO-A-02070560.<br>
However, although the activity of this catalyst is improved compared to the ketimine<br>
catalyst, the preparation of iminoimidazolidine catalyst comprises more reaction steps<br>
using highly toxic cyanogen bromide, which may liberate the highly toxic hydrocyanic<br>
acid. One of the aims aim of the invention is to provide a low-cost catalyst that is highly<br>
active in olefin polymerization and avoids the use of highly toxic starting materials or<br>
intermediates.<br>
This aim is achieved with the organometallic compound according to<br>
claim 4.<br>
Amidinate-containing organometallic compounds of Ti are described<br>
by Zambelli et. al. in Macromolecules, 2003, 5451-5458. The difference between an<br>
amidine containing ligand, covalently bonded to the metal ion and an amidinate (both<br>
groups comprising a first and a second nitrogen atom, which in case of the amidine<br>
may also be another group 15 or 16 atom) is, that the imine nitrogen atom (the first<br>
nitrogen atom) of the amidine is unambiguously covalently bonded to the metal ion,<br>
while the second nitrogen atom has no interaction with the metal ion.<br>
The interaction of the two nitrogen atoms of the amidinate ligand is<br>
illustrated in scheme 1 below. Scheme 1 clearly indicates that both nitrogen atoms<br>
have a bounding interaction with the metal ion (the latter is not shown in the scheme),<br>
which is comparable to the r|3Pd-a!lyl bond as known in the art.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Another diference is that the imine nitrogen of amidine is formally negatively charged,<br>
while the imine nitrogen of the amidinate in the resonance structure is formally neutrally<br>
charged. In the third resonance structure of scheme 1 both nitrogen atoms are<br>
negatively charged.<br>
A third difference is that the imine nitrogen of the amidine cannot have a substituent,<br>
while both nitrogen atoms of the amidinate have substituents.<br>
The invention also relates to a supported catalyst which comprises a<br>
organometallic compound of formula 1, a supporting material and optionally a<br>
scavenger and/or an activator.<br>
A supporting material is defined as an inorganic or organic compound<br>
that does not dissolve in the inert hydrocarbon solvent in which the process of the<br>
invention is carried out. Suitable inorganic supports include silica, magnesium halides,<br>
such as MgF2, MgCI2, MgBr2l Mgl2, zeolites, and alumina. Suitable organic supports<br>
include polymers. Some non-limiting examples of polymeric supports are polyolefins<br>
such as polystryrene, polypropylene and polyethylene, polycondensates such as<br>
polyamides and polyesters and combinations thereof.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the production of the<br>
organometallic compound of formula 1. In this process a organometallic reagent of<br>
formula 3 is contacted with an amidine-containing ligand precursor according to<br>
formula 2, with<br>
(formula 3),<br>
wherein M is a metal from group 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, or a metal from the lanthanide series,<br>
and p is the valency of the metal M,<br>
L is a neutral Lewis based ligand bonded to M, and j represents an integer denoting the<br>
number of neutral ligands L, and<br>
X is an anionic ligand bonded to M.<br>
An amidine-containing ligand precursor can be a metal salt of an<br>
amidine, an amidine, or the HB adduct of an amidine.<br>
If a metal salt of an amidine according to formula 4 is used, the<br>
process as described above can be carried out as such, with<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Sub! and Sub2 are groups as described above, and G is a group comprising a<br>
metal of group 1, 2, or 13 or a group comprising Si, Ge, Sn or Pb. If G represents a<br>
group with a metal of group 1, group G may further contain Lewis basic ligands as<br>
defined for L. If group G contains a metal of group 2, the group G contains a second<br>
anionic ligand. This anionic ligand may be another negatively charged amidine ligand<br>
or an anionic ligand as defined forX. If the group G contains an atom of group 13, this<br>
atom can further be substituted with two groups which each can be either an amidine12<br>
containing ligand or an anionic group as defined for X, or combinations thereof. If group<br>
G comprises an atom chosen from the series of Si, Ge, Sn or Pb, this atom can be<br>
substituted with three hydrocarbyl groups, optionally containing at least one hetero<br>
atom of group 13-17.<br>
If the process is carried out with an amidine according to formula 5,<br>
or its HB adduct,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Sub1 and Sub2 are groups as described above, the process is carried out in<br>
the presence of at least 1 equivalent of a base with respect to the organometallic<br>
reagent.<br>
If the process is carried out with the HB adduct of an amidinecontaining<br>
ligand according to formula 5, the process has to be carried out in the<br>
presence of at least two equivalents of a base. The advantage of the HB adduct of the<br>
amidine-containing ligand is that its stability towards hydrolysis is significantly higher<br>
than for the metal salt of formula 4 or the amidine of formula 5.<br>
Methods for the preparation of amidine ligands and the metal salt<br>
thereof are well known in the art.<br>
Some non-limiting examples of B are halides, such as fluoride,<br>
chloride, bromide, or iodide, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, phosphate, hydrogen<br>
phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, carbonate, hydrogen carbonate, aromatic or<br>
aliphatic carboxylates, cyanide, tetrafluoroborate, (substituted) tetraphenylborates,<br>
fluorinated tetraarylborates, alkyl or aryl sulfonates.<br>
If the method for the preparation of the catalyst is carried out in the<br>
presence of a base, suitable bases include amines, phosphanes, carboxylates (for<br>
example potassium acetate), fluorides, hydroxides, cyanides, amides and carbonates<br>
of Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, ammonium and the group 2 metals Mg, Ca, and Ba, the alkali<br>
metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) phosphates and the phosphate esters (eg. C6 H5<br>
OP(O)(ONa)2 and related aryl and alkyl compounds) and their alkoxides and<br>
phenoxides, thallium hydroxide, alkylammonium hydroxides and fluorides. Some of<br>
these bases may be used in conjunction with a phase transfer reagent, such as<br>
tetraalkylammonium salts or crown ethers. Stronger bases may also be applied, for<br>
example carbanions such as hydrocarbanions and hydrides of group 1, group 2, group<br>
12 or group 13 elements. The alkalimetals of group 1 may also be applied as a base. If<br>
the spectator ligand is a diacidic spectator ligand, at least two equivalents of a base are<br>
required.<br>
Preferred bases include amines, organolithium compounds, or<br>
organomagnesium compounds, alkali metals, group 1 hydrides or group 2 hydrides.<br>
More preferred bases are mono-, di-, or trialkylamines or aromatic<br>
amines, organolithium compounds, organomagnesium compounds, sodium hydride or<br>
calcium hydride. In this application, aromatic amines are understood to be compounds<br>
having a nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring system or mono-, di-, or triarylamines.<br>
Even more preferred bases are triethylamine, pyridine,<br>
tripropylamine, tributylamine, 1,4-diaza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, pyrrolidine or piperidine<br>
organolithium compounds, or organomagnesium compounds. Examples of<br>
organomagnesium compounds are methylmagnesium halides, phenylmagnesium<br>
halides, benzylmagnesium halides, biphenylmagnesium halides, naphthylmagnesium<br>
halides, tolylmagnesium halides, xylylmagnesium halides, mesitylmagnesium halides,<br>

Examples of organolithium compounds are methyllithium,<br>
phenyllithium, benzyllithium, biphenyllithium, naphthyllithium, lithio-dimethylresorcinol<br>
and lithio-N,N-dimethylaniline.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment of the process of the invention the<br>
neutral ligand L can be the base. In this case, depending on the number of neutral<br>
ligands and the number of required equivalents of a base, there is no need, or a<br>
reduced need, for an added base. Examples of L serving as a base are mono-, bi- or<br>
multidentate amines, momo-, bi-, or multidentate phoshanes, aza or phospha-crown<br>
ethers, or combinations thereof.<br>
In order to obtain an organometallic compound that can be activated<br>
by advanced activators, such as boron comprising activators (boranes, borates), the<br>
anionic ligand X in the organometallic compound has to be a hydrocarbyl group. The<br>
process for the preparation of the organometallic compound is therefore optionally<br>
carried out in the presence of a hydrocarbylating agent. In this application,<br>
hydrocarbylating agents are understood to be nucleophilic groups comprising a metalcarbon<br>
bond, a metalloid-carbon bond or a metal or metalloid hydride bond. The<br>
number of equivalents required for a process for the preparation of a hydrocarbylated<br>
organometallic compound is at least the number of the anionic ligands X that has to be<br>
replaced by a hydrocarbylating agent. Suitable hydrocarbylating agents are tri- or<br>
tetrahydrocarbyl boron, tri- or tetrahydrocarbyl aluminium, tri- or tetrahydrocarbyl<br>
gallium, tri- or tetrahydrocarbyl indium and di- or tetrahydrocarbyl tin, or the reaction<br>
products of these hydrocarbylating agents with sterically hindered alcohols, thiols,<br>
amines or phosphanes.<br>
Preferably the hydrocarbylating agent comprises a metal or a<br>
metalloid chosen from group 1, 2, 11, 12, 13 or 14. Examples of hydrides from metals<br>
or metalloids of group 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14 are lithium hydride, sodium hydride,<br>
potassium hydride, calcium hydride, magnesium hydride, copper hydride, zinc hydride,<br>
cadmium hydride, borane, aluminum hydride, gallium hydride, silicon hydride,<br>
germanium hydride and tin hydride.<br>
More preferably the hydrocarbylating agent comprises Li, Mg, Zn, or<br>
Al.<br>
Examples of Li-containing hydrocarbylating agents are methyllithium,<br>
phenyllithium, benzyllithium, biphenyllithium, naphtyllithium, lithio-dimethylresorcinol,<br>
and lithio-N,N-dimethylaniline.<br>
Examples of magnesium-containing hydrocarbylating agents are<br>
methylmagnesium halide, phenylmagnesium halide, benzylmagnesium halide,<br>
biphenylmagnesium halide, naphtylmagnesium halide, tolylmagnesium halide,<br>
xylylmagnesium halide, mesitylmagnesium halide, dimethylresorcinolmagnesium<br>
halide, N,N-dimethylanilinemagnesium halide, dimethylmagnesium,<br>

Examples of aluminium-containing hydrocarbylating agents are<br>
diisobutylaluminium hydride, CrC2o trihydrocarbyl aluminium, and hydrocarbyl<br>
aluminoxanes.<br>
The process for the preparation of the organometallic compound<br>
according to the invention is preferably carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents are<br>
solvents that do not react with the organometallic reagent or the organometallic<br>
compound formed in the process of the invention. Examples of suitable solvents are<br>
aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, amides of the<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acids and primary or secondary amines, DMSO, nitromethane,<br>
acetone, acetonitrile, benzonitrile, ethers, polyethers, cyclic ethers, lower aromatic and<br>
aliphatic ethers, esters, pyridine, alkylpyridines, cyclic and primary or secondary<br>
amines, and mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents include aromatic or aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof.<br>
The process for the preparation of the catalyst according to the<br>
invention is carried out by contacting an amidine-containing ligand with an<br>
organometallic reagent of formula 3. The desired organometallic compound is often<br>
formed instantaneously. Excess of a base may be applied without negative effects on<br>
the reaction product.<br>
During the reaction, a salt is formed. The reaction mixture as<br>
obtained by contacting an amidine-containing ligand with an organometallic reagent<br>
according to formula 3 can be used as a catalyst in a polyolefin polymerization without<br>
an additional filtration step if the salt formed during the reaction is compatible with the<br>
polymerisation process. If a salt free organometallic compound is required, the salt can<br>
be removed by filtration. Depending on the solubility of the organometallic compound,<br>
the mixture may be heated and then filtered. An advantage of the present invention is<br>
that the filtrate may be used as such without further purification in a following process,<br>
such as a hydrocarbylation step or a polymerization process. If desired, the<br>
organometallic compound may be isolated by distillation of the solvent, by precipitation<br>
or by crystallization from a suitable solvent.<br>
Preferably, the process of the invention is carried out in the presence<br>
of a boron-containing or aluminium-containing co-catalyst in the presence of a catalyst<br>
according to the invention, which is formed in situ in the polymerization equipment.<br>
The invention further relates to polymers obtainable with the catalyst<br>
of the invention.<br>
