This invention relates to a flavoured chewing gumlet and a process of manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A common chewing gum or bubble gum contains sugar, humectants, plasticizers, and different flavors besides the gum base as the main carrier or vehicle. In sugarless product other ingredients such as aspartame are used to substitute sugar.<br>
In countries like India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka it is very popular to consume a product which comprises of ingredients like Magnesium Carbonate, areca nut and gambier - a resinous plant product not safe for human consumption. In India the mixed product is commonly known as Tan masala' and 'Gutkha'(containing tobacco ). Both the products have been found to cause sub-mucous fibrosis and leads to oral cancer on continuous consumption.<br>
In the tropical Asian countries, chewing betel nut in the form of areca quid is also quite popular. This type of Areca quid mainly consists of Areca nut (betel nut), lime paste (in India known as chuna), a resinous extract from the matrix of Acacia tree (in India known as Kattha or catechu).All these are spread over betel leaf and the whole quid is consumed along with the betel leaf, which is known as 'pan' in India.<br>
The consumption of betel nut in the form of Areca quid has many disadvantages like and the most important one is it generates a bright thick red colored fluid which mixes with the saliva and has to be expectorated which causes pollution to the environment.<br>
The object of this invention is to overcome said disadvantages by providing flavoured chewing gumlet which will provide pan flavour, katha flavour, clove flavour, cardamom flavour, safforan and other such desired flavours.<br>
To achieve said objective this invention provides a process of preparing flavoured chewing gumlet comprising:<br>
mixing 20-30% by wt. gum base, 15-30% by wt. of filler and 12.5-16.5 % by<br>
wt of dough forming medium to form a mixture,<br>
warming said mixture at 50-80oC to soften said gum base to fonn dough,<br><br>
adding 0.05 - 0.88% by wt. of flavouring agents as herein described in said dough,<br>
adding another 15-30% by wt. of filler and sweetening agent with menthol and<br>
mixing it for 1-2 minutes,<br>
adding further 15-30% by wt. of filler, 0.05-0.88% by wt. of flavouring agent<br>
and 3.0-8.0% by wt. of hardener in said dough,<br>
heating said dough at 35-50°C to get a softened mass,<br>
said softened mass is then off loaded into trays and allowed to cool to ambient<br>
temperature to obtain cooled mass,<br>
the cooled mass is then cut into loaves of specific size and fed to extruder at<br>
temperature 35-45oC to form desired sheets of said mass,<br>
said sheets are stored at 12-25oC and 25-40% RH for 8-24 hours beforedown<br>
sizing to obtain gumlet,<br>
coating said gumlets with 0.5-2%o b y wt o f edible adhesive gum in a sugar<br>
syrup 58-68%) and drying to obtain partially coated gumlets,<br>
finally, further coating said partially coated gumlets by sugar syrup, gum<br>
solution and flavouring agent and drying,<br>
said coated gumlets are kept under 22-25^^0 and 35-45% RH for 2-4 hours and<br>
thereafter polishing said coated gumlets with a layer of wax and packing.<br>
The said filler is powdered D-sorbitol or powdered sugar or powdered maize starch or mixture thereof.<br>
The said dough forming medium is selected from liquid glucose, liquid sorbitol or malitol syrup.<br>
The hardener is calcium carbonate in powder form having particle size 250-450 microns.<br>
The flavouring agent is selected from pan flavour, katha flavour, clove flavour, cardamom flavour, safforan, peppermint and combination thereof.<br>
The said coating is dried at temperatures not exceeding 25oC and using chilled air at a velocity of not more than 450 cfm for a period not exceeding 2-4 minutes.<br><br>
The said wax layer consists of camauba wax, bees wax and paraffin wax and is applied to a pan for coating the gumlet.<br>
Polishing of gum with layer of wax is carried out for 15-60 minutes or till such time as the surface of coated gum shines uniformly all round.<br>
The said coated sheets are sized down to pillow shape gumlet having a dimension of 4-6 mm X 4-6 mm x 2-4 mm thickness.<br>
The pan flavour comprises pan masala powder, pan masala liquid with additional flavours cardamom special and peppermint oil.<br>
The coating flavouring agent is pan masala Uquid when the flavouring agent used in pan<br>
flavour.<br>
The flavouring agent is katha flavour which comprises pan masala powder, pan masala Uquid with added flavouring agent cardamom special and peppermint oil.<br>
The coating flavouring agent is katha premix pan tobacco and pan leaf when the flavouring agent used is katha flavour.<br>

The chewing gum of the present invention as in examples 1 to 3 are compared with the control example 4 for the following attributes:<br><br><br>
PRODUCT SMOOTHNESS<br>
1-	Product Smoothness is an attribute that is related to the degree of smoothness to a<br>
consumer feeling the outer portion of the gumlet. In a scale of 10 example 3 delivers a<br>
smoothness of 7.3, example 2 a smoothness of 7.9, example 1 delivers a smoothness of<br>
9.4 which is much higher than that delivered by control example 4 which is 6.5.<br>
SALIVA GENERATION<br>
2-	Saliva Generation is the saliva formed during intake of the chewing gum. Example 3<br>
generates saliva of 7.3 cc, example 2 to generates saliva of 7.0cc, example 1 leads to<br>
saliva generation of 6.8 cc which are much lower than that by control example 4 which is<br>
7.6 cc.<br>
LINGERING EFFECT<br>
The lingering effect is the time interval when the user feels the urge to consume another pack. The effect of the chewing gum lingers for 56 minutes in example 3, 90 minutes for example 2, 90 minutes for example I which are much higher than the control example 4 where effect lingers for only 48 minutes<br>
The lingering effect is higher for the examples 1, 2, 3 in comparison to example 4 leads to the fact that test enhancer has an important role to improve the product quality.<br><br>
LINGERING EFFECT<br>
The lingering effect is the time interval when the user feels the urge to consume another pack. The effect of the chewing gum lingers for 56 minutes in example 3, 90 minutes for example 2, 90 minutes for examplel which are much higher than the control example 4 where effect lingers for only 48 minutes<br>
The hngering effect is higher for the examples 1,2,3 in comparison to example 4 leads to the fact that test enhancer has an important role to improve the product quality.<br>
CHEWING PROPERTY &amp; OVERALL TASTE<br>
Chewing property and overall taste was determined in a scale of 10. Example 3,2 &amp; 1 revealed values 7.6, 7.9 and 8.7 respectively as against 7.6 for example 4 with respect to Chewing property whereas for Overall Taste the values were 7.5 ,7.8 , 8.8 for Example 3,2 &amp; 1 as against 7.4 for Example 4.<br>
Thus considering all aspects of the experiments done, we find that the catechu containing chewing gum of the present invention is superior to the control sample 4.<br>
Pan flavor and Supari flavors are nothing but food grade aroma chemicals such as Geranoil, Linalool, etc. and oils such as clove  oil etc; extracts such as Resinoid Benzoin etc.<br>
We are mixing the ingredients to make a gum. We do not see any chemical reaction except change in property of the gum.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This invention relates to a flavoured chewing gumlet and a process of manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A common chewing gum or bubble gum contains sugar, humectants, plasticizers, and different flavors besides the gum base as the main carrier or vehicle. In sugarless product other ingredients such as aspartame are used to substitute sugar.<br>
In countries like India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka it is very popular to consume a product which comprises of ingredients like Magnesium Carbonate, areca nut and gambier - a resinous plant product not safe for human consumption. In India the mixed product is commonly known as Tan masala' and 'Gutkha'(containing tobacco ). Both the products have been found to cause sub-mucous fibrosis and leads to oral cancer on continuous consumption.<br>
In the tropical Asian countries, chewing betel nut in the form of areca quid is also quite popular. This type of Areca quid mainly consists of Areca nut (betel nut), lime paste (in India known as chuna), a resinous extract from the matrix of Acacia tree (in India known as Kattha or catechu).All these are spread over betel leaf and the whole quid is consumed along with the betel leaf, which is known as 'pan' in India.<br>
The consumption of betel nut in the form of Areca quid has many disadvantages like and the most important one is it generates a bright thick red colored fluid which mixes with the saliva and has to be expectorated which causes pollution to the environment.<br>
The object of this invention is to overcome said disadvantages by providing flavoured chewing gumlet which will provide pan flavour, katha flavour, clove flavour, cardamom flavour, safforan and other such desired flavours.<br>
To achieve said objective this invention provides a process of preparing flavoured chewing gumlet comprising:<br>
mixing 20-30% by wt. gum base, 15-30% by wt. of filler and 12.5-16.5 % by<br>
wt of dough forming medium to form a mixture,<br>
warming said mixture at 50-80oC to soften said gum base to fonn dough,<br><br>
adding 0.05 - 0.88% by wt. of flavouring agents as herein described in said dough,<br>
adding another 15-30% by wt. of filler and sweetening agent with menthol and<br>
mixing it for 1-2 minutes,<br>
adding further 15-30% by wt. of filler, 0.05-0.88% by wt. of flavouring agent<br>
and 3.0-8.0% by wt. of hardener in said dough,<br>
heating said dough at 35-50°C to get a softened mass,<br>
said softened mass is then off loaded into trays and allowed to cool to ambient<br>
temperature to obtain cooled mass,<br>
the cooled mass is then cut into loaves of specific size and fed to extruder at<br>
temperature 35-45oC to form desired sheets of said mass,<br>
said sheets are stored at 12-25oC and 25-40% RH for 8-24 hours beforedown<br>
sizing to obtain gumlet,<br>
coating said gumlets with 0.5-2%o b y wt o f edible adhesive gum in a sugar<br>
syrup 58-68%) and drying to obtain partially coated gumlets,<br>
finally, further coating said partially coated gumlets by sugar syrup, gum<br>
solution and flavouring agent and drying,<br>
said coated gumlets are kept under 22-25^^0 and 35-45% RH for 2-4 hours and<br>
thereafter polishing said coated gumlets with a layer of wax and packing.<br>
The said filler is powdered D-sorbitol or powdered sugar or powdered maize starch or mixture thereof.<br>

The chewing gum of the present invention as in examples 1 to 3 are compared with the control example 4 for the following attributes:<br><br><br>
PRODUCT SMOOTHNESS<br>
1-	Product Smoothness is an attribute that is related to the degree of smoothness to a<br>
consumer feeling the outer portion of the gumlet. In a scale of 10 example 3 delivers a<br>
smoothness of 7.3, example 2 a smoothness of 7.9, example 1 delivers a smoothness of<br>
9.4 which is much higher than that delivered by control example 4 which is 6.5.<br>
SALIVA GENERATION<br>
2-	Saliva Generation is the saliva formed during intake of the chewing gum. Example 3<br>
generates saliva of 7.3 cc, example 2 to generates saliva of 7.0cc, example 1 leads to<br>
saliva generation of 6.8 cc which are much lower than that by control example 4 which is<br>
7.6 cc.<br>
LINGERING EFFECT<br>
The lingering effect is the time interval when the user feels the urge to consume another pack. The effect of the chewing gum lingers for 56 minutes in example 3, 90 minutes for example 2, 90 minutes for example I which are much higher than the control example 4 where effect lingers for only 48 minutes<br>
The lingering effect is higher for the examples 1, 2, 3 in comparison to example 4 leads to the fact that test enhancer has an important role to improve the product quality.<br><br>
LINGERING EFFECT<br>
The lingering effect is the time interval when the user feels the urge to consume another pack. The effect of the chewing gum lingers for 56 minutes in example 3, 90 minutes for example 2, 90 minutes for examplel which are much higher than the control example 4 where effect lingers for only 48 minutes<br>
The hngering effect is higher for the examples 1,2,3 in comparison to example 4 leads to the fact that test enhancer has an important role to improve the product quality.<br>
CHEWING PROPERTY &amp; OVERALL TASTE<br>
Chewing property and overall taste was determined in a scale of 10. Example 3,2 &amp; 1 revealed values 7.6, 7.9 and 8.7 respectively as against 7.6 for example 4 with respect to Chewing property whereas for Overall Taste the values were 7.5 ,7.8 , 8.8 for Example 3,2 &amp; 1 as against 7.4 for Example 4.<br>
Thus considering all aspects of the experiments done, we find that the catechu containing chewing gum of the present invention is superior to the control sample 4.<br>
Pan flavor and Supari flavors are nothing but food grade aroma chemicals such as Geranoil, Linalool, etc. and oils such as clove  oil etc; extracts such as Resinoid Benzoin etc.<br>
We are mixing the ingredients to make a gum. We do not see any chemical reaction except change in property of the gum.<br></td>
