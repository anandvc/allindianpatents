				<td>The present invention relates to production of nitrogen fixer and phosphate solubilizer microbial strains to promote soil health and to reduce the load of chemical fertilizer for the growth of tea plants.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to the preparation of a bio fertilizer comprising nitrogen fixer and a group of phosphate solubilizers.<br>
It is known to use different types of chemical fertilizer for the enhancement or growth of tea plants. Chemical fertilizers can be a various types, namely<br>
Nitrogen - Urea, Ammonium Sulphate<br>
Phosphatic Fertilizer - Rock Phosphate, Super Phosphate. The known chemical fertilizers in the soil has some inherent disadvantages. The chemical fertilizers- gradually kills the microbes in the soil which ultimately leads to reduction of production of tea plantation. Another disadvantages associated with the use of chemical fertilizers is the enhancement of the growth of unwanted micro organisms which ultimately effects the growth of tea plants.<br>
It has therefore been endeavour of the applicant to invent a fertilizer substitute which will at least reduce the load of chemical fertilizers in the production of tea.<br>
: 2 :<br><br>
It Is known that the blo fertilizers is a combination<br>
of nitrogen fixers and phosphate soiubilizers. A nitrogen<br>
fixer fixes the atmospheric nitrogen and mobilise it into<br>
the soil  at the rate of 20-40 kg/ha and a phosphate<br>
soiubiiizers soluhilizes the insoluble phosphates present<br>
in the soil to the tune of 30-50 kg P2O5/ha. The bio fertilizer<br>
oof the present invention  supplement  the use of chemical<br>
fertilizer for the required need of nutrient for the growth<br>
of tea plant.<br>
According to this invention acid tolerant nitrogen fixers and phosphate solubilizers are isolated, mass cultured and inundated into the field through a cost effective production process thereof.<br>
In the prior art the use of chemical fertilizers in the growth of tea crops had lead to some major disadvantages-<br>
a)	Reduction of fertilizer utilizations capacity of the<br>
Plants;<br>
b)	Pollution of ground Mater;<br>
c)	Detorioration soil health.<br>
d)	Population build up of undesired microblal flora.<br>
3<br><br>
It is known that the use of bio fertilizer in the growth of tea crops is not free from defects. The known disadvantages in using the bio fertilizers are as follows:<br>
i)  The life of the bio fertilizer is not more than 90<br>
days; ii)  The known fertilizer do not have the. adequate acid<br>
tolerance and ability to cope with the acid tea soil<br>
content; iii)  In the known bio fertilizer there is limitation in<br>
the establishment of nitrogen fixers and also the<br>
phosphate solubilizers; iv)  Due to the variation of nitrogen fixation or mobilizing<br>
phosphates  from region to region the known bio<br>
fertilizer is not as effective as a chemical fertilizer; v)  Fixation and mobilization of known bio fertilizers<br>
are dependent  on  the abiotic factors which is<br>
responsible for the insufficient growth of tea crops;<br>
and vi)  Conventional bio fertilizers is known to have low<br>
effectiveness and short life effect on the soil.<br>
4<br><br>
To mitigate the aforesaid drawbacks of the conventional bio fertilizer and also the chemical fertilizers it has been the endeavour of the applicant to invent an improved bio fertilizer containing a nitrogen fixer and a group of efficient phosphate solubilizers of improved characteristics.<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to produce an improved bio fertilizer having better efficacy in the growth of plants, particularly the tea crops.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to sustair low energy input in the soils.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to improve the soil health, particularly for the growth of tea plants.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided improved bio fertilizer which comprises a nitrogen fixer and a group of phosphate solubilizer in a equal ratio.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove a nitrogen fixer is Azotobacter chroococcum (BAH).<br>
5<br><br>
The nitrogen fixer as mentioned herein above and also the phosphate solubilizers are prepared separately before mixing them in preparing the bio fertilizer of the present invention.<br>
The production process of nitrogen fixer ( GGL R&amp;D BA14 ) in modified Ashby's medium comprises the following steps;<br>
1)	Transferring the stock culture Azotobacter chroococcum (BA14) into<br>
mother culture medium;<br>
2)	Allowing the mother culture medium to grow for 3-7 days;<br>
3)	Transferring the grown mother culture to main culture medium ; and<br>
4)	Allowing the mother culture medium to go for another 3-7days to<br>
obtain the Azotobacter Chroococcum (BAH)<br>
The phosphate solubilizer is a mixture of Bacillus subtilis (BB15), Pseudomonas putida (BP19), Asperqlliue awamorl (FA16) and Asperqillus flavus (FA18) in a ratio of 5:2:2:1.<br>
Bacillus subtilis (BB15) and Pseudomonus putida (BP19) are prepared in a manner as described hereinabove in respect of Azotobacter cbroococcum (BAH) using a medium essentially containing molasses and yeast in mother culture and main culture medium,<br>
6<br><br><br>
However, Asperqillus awamorl (FA16) and Asperqillus flavus(FA18) (Molasses or Yeast medium) are prepared by transferring the stock culture to mother culture medium and allowing the mother culture to grow for 15 days. Transferring the grown mother culture to main culture medium and allowing it to grow again for another 15 days to obtain Aspergi1lus awamori (FA16) and Aspergillus flavus (FA18).<br>
Nitrogen fixer (Azotobacter chroococcum) and phosphate solubilizer (Bacillus subtilis. Pseudomonas putida. Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus flavus) were separately isolated from the native tea soil and subcultured in a modified medium from the Ashby's medium and Pikovskaya's medium respectively. During the mass culturing process amide in the form of a salt is added to the nitrogen fixer medium to increase the growth of cells and also strains were cultured at a room temperature between 25-30°C.<br>
Bacterial and fungal cultures are allowed to grow over a period of 5-15 days. Cultures Bacillus subtllls(BB15),<br>
purtida(BPl,9),<br>
Pseudomonas     Aspergillus awamorl(FA16)  and<br>
Asperqillus flavus(FA18) are mixed in a ratio of 5:2:2:1 to form a homogeneous suspension of phosphate solubillzers.<br><br>
Stock cultures of Bacillus subtilbs (BB15), Pseudomonas puttda (BP19), Aspergillus awamorl (FA16) and Asperglllus flavus (FA18) can also be grown separately on Plate Count Agar (PCA) and Yeast Glucose Agar (YGA). The starter cultures were however inoculated to Molasses and yeast medium to create mass culture of the product. The said mass culture shall have to be maintained at room temperature upto the period of around 15-20 days to obtain the desired cells or spores of the cultures.<br>
The bio fertilizer, ie. The nitrozen fixer and phosphate solubilizers are used at the rate of 30-50 litres and 20-40 litres/ha/yr as ground application by using knapsack sprayer fitted with herbicide nozzle. The applicant has found that by applying bio fertilizer alongwith chemical fertilizer in the soil for the growth of tea plants, the rate of plant growth can be increased to a substantial extent upto 13 to 23%. This will be evident from the following examples.<br>
Example - I<br>
An experiment was conducted in Lakhipara Tea Garden with an area of 2.34 ha each in treatment and untreated control plots with the following:-<br>
a) The control plot received reduced dose of nitrogenous<br>
8<br><br>
fertilizer (Urea) and phosphatic fertilizer (rock phosphate) together with potash input as required in 2 splits.<br>
reduced b)  The treatment plot was applied with 70% of the <br>
dose of nitrogenous fertilizer and 50% of phosphatic fertilizer together with potash as per the above. The reduced dose of notrogenous and phosphatic fertilizer was supplemented with 30 litres of live culture of nitrogen fixers and 20 litres live culture of phosphate solubilizers per hactre in two equal splits.<br>
The yield interns of green leaf weight for doth the plots were maintained separately which exhibited 6159 kg and 6910 kg for control and treatment plots respectively.<br>
Example - II<br>
Another experiment was conducted in a different Tea Garden of Doors with control and treatment area of 2.145 hactres each with same doses of nitrogenous and phosphatic<br>
4<br>
fertilizer for control plot and reduced doses of nitrogenous<br>
9<br><br>
And phosphatie fertilizer supplemented with 30 litres/ha of nitrogen fixer culture and 20 litres/ha of phosphate solubilizer culture in treatment plot yielded 2826 kg and 2939 kgs of green leaf respectively.<br>
In both the experiments conducted in two different gardens of Doors region exhibited better result in treatment plots in comparison to the conventional control plots.<br>
Further, other experiments conducted with the nitrogen fixer and phosphate solubilizers elsewhere by us also proved encouraging.<br>
Experiments conducted in group gardens for one pruning cycle i.e 3 (Three) years with conventional fertilizer application dosages and reduced dosages of nitrogenous fertilizer to the tune of 30 kg/ha and phosphatic fertilizer to the tune of 50 kg/ha respectively suppiimented with 30-40 litres each of nitrogen fixer and phosphate soiubilizer microbials strains proved to be beneficial in terms of yield of green leaf.<br>
The reduced dosage of chemical fertilizer did not showed any detrimental effect instead the treatment plots supplemented with liquid biofertilizers applied on soil have showed 13-23% of yield increase. This proved the capacity of microbials to suppliment the requirement of nitrogen and phosphorus for normal plant growth and vigore.<br>
