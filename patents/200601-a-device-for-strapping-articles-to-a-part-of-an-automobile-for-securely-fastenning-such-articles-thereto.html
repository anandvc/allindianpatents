This invention relates to a device for strapping articles to a part of an automobile, more particularly, though not exclusively, two wheeler motor vehicles, for securely fastening such articles there to.<br>
Known to the art are satchels fixed to the top of the fuel tank of motor cycles which are intended for carrying articles, such as, documents, a comb, and so on. However such satchels are not suited to carry bigger objects like books and other articles of large size. Besides, such satchels detract from the general appearance of the vehicle.<br>
Also known to the art are hooks welded to the body of the vehicle below the pillion from which the articles to be carried are slung from a bag fixed to a hook. However, such devices again make the vehicle appear ungainly.<br>
It is an object of this invention to propose a device for strapping articles to a part of an automobile, and also for unstrapping such articles, whenever required, quickly and easily. The articles, once strapped in position, are held securely in place. The size of the articles that can be carried is comparatively greater than the size of die articles carried by devices such as the fuel tank satchels. Furthermore, the strap, when not in use, is out of sight<br><br>
since the device proposed herein is generally intended to be mounted below the fuel tank of the vehicle or some such place.<br>
The foUowmg further description of this invention will disclose various other features of the proposed device.<br>
The device for strapping articles to a part of an automobile for securely fastening such articles thereto, according to this invention, comprises a rotatably mounted shaA, the first portion of the shafl having a belt wound around it, with the inner end of the belt fixed to the first portion of the shaft and the outer end of the belt free; a hook, attached to the said free end of the belt, for engaging with an eye fixed to, or near, the said part; a coil spring, accommodated in a housing, the first end of the spring being fixed to the second portion of the shaft, widi the second end of the spring being attached to the housmg, whereby the belt is enabled to unwind from, and rewind on, the shaft, under spring tension, the belt, in its unwound state, strapping the said articles securely to the said part, whenever the hook is engaged with the said eye.<br>
The proposed device will now be described in greater detail widi reference to the accompanying drawings<br><br>
which illustrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation one of various possible embodiments of this invention. In the drawmgs,<br>
Fig.l illustrates an exploded view of the embodiment<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the unwound belt with the hook engaging with the eye.<br>
Fig54 illustrates articles strapped to the fuel tank of a two wheeler motor vehicle<br>
And Fig. 4 illustrates the appearance of the general<br>
«<br>
assembly of the embodiment.<br>
A rotatably mounted shaft S has a Hrst portion SI with a a belt B wound around it. The inner end of the beh B (not illustrated) is fixed to the portion SI of the shaft and the outer end B2 of the belt is free.<br>
A hook H is attached to the said free end B2 of the belt for engaging with an eye E fixed to or near, the part of M of the vehicle where the articles are to be strapped.<br>
A coil spring C is accommodated in a housing T, one end of the spring being fixed to the second portion S2 of<br><br>
the shaft, with the other end of the spring being attached to the housing T. The second portion S2 of the shaft is supported within the housing T. The first portion of the shaft SI is supported between side plates PI and P2 and held in place by a clamp D. The plates PI and P2 are located by the pins Q.<br>
From the foregoing description it will be seen that the belt is enabled to unwind from, and rewind on, the shaft, under the tension of the coil spring C.<br>
The belt B is unwound by manudly pulling on it and rewound by manually releasing it, when it reverts to its unwound state under the tension of the coil spring C.<br>
In its unwound state, the belt B is made to strap the articles A placed, for instance, on the fuel tank G of the vehicle and the hook H engaged with the eye £. The tension of the coil spring causes the belt B to strap the articles A tightly and securely in place on the fuel tank. Whenever the articles A are to be removed, all that is necessary to be done is disengage the hook H from the eye E and release the belt. The belt now reverts to its unwound state under the tension of the coil spring C.<br><br>
The device proposed herein is unobtrusive when installed. It is brought into use only when necessary; otherwise it is out of sight. It is quick and effective in performance. It is simple in construction and easy to operate.<br>
From what has been just described and illustrated, it will be clear that other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible, without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A device for strapping articles to a part of an<br>
automobile for securely fastening such articles<br>
thereto, comprising a rotatably mounted shaft, the first<br>
portion of the shall having a belt wound around it,<br>
with the inner end of the belt fixed to the first portion<br>
of the shaft and the outer end of the belt free; a hook<br>
attached to the said free end of the belt, for engaging<br>
with an eye fixed to, or near, the said part; a coil<br>
spring, accommodated in a housmg, the first end of<br>
the spring being fixed to the second portion of the<br>
shaft, with the second end of the spring being attached<br>
to the housing, whereby the belt is enabled to unwind<br>
from, and rewind on, the shaft, under sprmg tension,<br>
the belt, in its unwound state, stapping the said<br>
articles securely to the said part, whenever the hook<br>
is engaged with the said eye.<br>
2.	A device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the  second<br>
portion of the shaft is supported within the housing.<br>
3.	A device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein<br>
the first portion of the shaft is supported between two<br>
side plates and held in place by a clamp.<br><br>
4.	A device as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the belt is<br>
located between the two side plates and retained in<br>
position therebetween.<br>
5.	A device for strapping articles to a part of an<br>
automobile for securely fastening such articles thereto,<br>
substantially as herein described and illustrated with<br>
reference to in the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
