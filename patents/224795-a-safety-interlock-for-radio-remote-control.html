				<td>FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a safety interlock for radio remote control of a<br>
mobile equipment, like a crane.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Safety is an important aspect of any mobile equipment. It becomes very critical<br>
when the equipment is operated remotely. In remote operation, in case of any<br>
failure, it should not lead to any motion for fail-safe operation. To ensure this,<br>
the control drop (Off) is interlocked with link failure, wrong data, watch dog,<br>
carrier detect and low battery.<br>
Link failure is the condition when the wireless communication channel between<br>
a transmitter and receiver is broken. This may be due to a weak signal<br>
generated from the transmitter unit or the distance between the transmitter and<br>
receiver is more than the range of the transmitter.<br>
The data from the transmitter unit is sent to the receiver unit in form of packets.<br>
Each packet consists of 8 bytes of the data. First byte and the last byte is the<br>
start byte and end byte. These values are fixed. The sixth and seventh byte is<br>
the checksum. In the receiving end the received data match along with<br>
checksum. If the data do not match the condition is known as wrong data.<br><br>
In addition to the main programmable logic controller (PLC) of the system there<br>
is a watchdog programmable logic controller (PLC) which monitors the health of<br>
the main programmable logic controller (PLC). In case this programmable logic<br>
controller (PLC) observes any abnormality in the main programmable logic<br>
controller (PLC) the control off circuit is activated.<br>
Carrier detect is an inbuilt feature of radio modules. When the receiver detects<br>
the carrier signal from the transmitter the carrier detect pin at receiver end goes<br>
high. The high and low of carrier detect pin indicates the presence or absence of<br>
carrier signal of transmitter at receiver end.<br>
The microprocessor circuitry inside the remote unit needs certain minimum<br>
voltage. This transmitter unit is powered with a rechargeable battery. When the<br>
battery voltage goes below a certain level the microprocessor circuitry may<br>
behave in an erratic fashion. This state of battery is known as Battery Low.<br>
It is expected that the above protection should stop the crane in case of failure<br>
of remote system. However, there is no feedback from the end operation i.e.<br>
direction and main contactor operation. In case, due to any reason, the direction<br>
contactor picks up without any motion command issued by the remote system<br>
the crane can start moving.<br>
Presently there is no system to prevent such situation. In such condition,<br>
operator can only stop the crane either by pressing control off, emergency or<br>
simply switching off the transmitter (switching off transmitter shall activate<br>
carrier detect and in-turn activate control off).<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore, is to ensure that in the event<br>
of a failure, signals are generated indicating that all motion commands are at<br>
zero and that all the directional contacts are at off conditions.<br>
To achieve these and other objects, a programmable logic controller (PLC) is<br>
provided for generating an output to represent the all command zero output.<br>
The logic in the programmable logic controller (PLC) first checks whether any<br>
motion command has been received from the transmitter end. If there is no<br>
motion command of any of the drive this output will remain off or low. As soon<br>
as any motion command is given this will be on or high.<br>
For the other requirement, normally closed auxiliary contacts of directional<br>
contacts are used. In addition to this two contactors are used to complete the<br>
interlock.<br>
Directional contactors and normally closed (NC) contacts for long travel forward<br>
(LTF) motion, long travel reverse (LTR) motion, cross travel forward (CTF)<br>
motion, cross travel reverse (CTR) motion, main hoist hoisting (MHH) motion,<br>
main hoist lowering (MHL) motion, auxiliary hoist hoisting (AHH) motion, and<br>
auxiliary hoist lowering (AHL) motion are found in the crane drive panels. These<br>
contacts are activated when the respective motions are activated.<br>
Control relay zero (CRZ) contactor will be high if any of the two contacts<br>
directional relay zero (DRZ) or all command zero (ANZ) is high. The high<br>
condition of the relay indicates that in programmable logic controller (PLC)<br>
indicated by all command zero (ANZ) as well as in actual field indicated by<br>
directional relay zero (DRZ) none of the directional relay is activated. This<br>
means that neither the motion command has been sent by the user nor any<br>
motion command is being executed by the actual field contacts.<br>
The new interlock circuit does not put extra burden on contactor cost. For<br>
generating the directional relay zero (DRZ) contact the free auxiliary contacts of<br>
the directional relays can be used. Normally in cranes these contacts are not<br>
being used elsewhere and are therefore free. Similarly all command zero contact<br>
can be generated without any extra cost attached to it. The only contactor cost<br>
is of two additional contactors, directional relay zero (DRZ) contactor and all<br>
command zero (ANZ) contactor.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a safety interlock for radio remote control<br>
of a mobile equipment, like a crane, comprising : a programmable logic controller<br>
(PLC) for generating an output to represent an all command zero output (ANZ)<br>
to indicate that the motion commands are at zero; a plurality of normally closed<br>
(NC) auxiliary contacts of directional contacts used for generating a directional<br>
relay zero (DRZ) signal representing that all directional contacts are at off<br>
position; and two contactors, a first directional relay zero (DRZ) condition<br>
contactor, and a second all command zero (ANZ) output condition contactor to<br>
complete the interlock.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the interlock logic circuit.<br>
Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of control power circuit.<br>
Figure 3 shows the programmable logic controller (PLC) of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows the auxiliary contacts of the directional relays for the respective<br>
motion of long travel forward (LTF), long travel reverse (LTR), cross travel<br>
forward (CTF), cross travel reverse (CTR), main hoist hoisting (MHH), main hoist<br>
lowering (MHL), auxiliary hoist hoisting (AHH), auxiliary hoist lowering<br>
(AHL).These contacts are normally closed (NC) contacts. When none of the<br>
motion is activated, the directional relay zero (DRZ) contactor connected to it is<br>
high. Now as explained earlier the all command zero (ANZ) is the programmable<br>
logic controller (PLC) contact indication for no motion command received. If<br>
there is no motion command of any of the drive this output will remain off or<br>
low. As soon as any motion command is given, this will be on or high.<br>
Figure 2 shows in schematic form the control power circuit. In normal operation<br>
of the crane (manual operation) when control on is pressed the power will flow<br>
through control off (C-OFF), change over (CH), control on (COON), change over<br>
(CH), other interlocks to main contact (MC) coil. This will energize the main<br>
contact (MC) after the release of control on (C-ON) switch power will flow<br>
through control off (COOFF), change over (CH), main contact (MC), other<br>
interlocks to main contact (MC) coil. When system is changed over to remote<br>
operation change over (CH) contact becomes open and control off remote (C-<br>
OFF(R ) becomes closed. After control on (C-ON) is pressed power will flow<br>
through control off (C-OFF), control off remote (C-OFF(R), control relay zero<br>
(CRZ), control on remote (C-ON), other interlocks and main contact (MC). And<br>
after the release of remote control on button through control off (C-OFF),<br>
control off remote (C-OFF( R), control relay zero (CRZ), main contact (MC), other<br>
interlocks and main contact (MC). As we have seen from above that control relay<br>
zero (CRZ) will remain high as long as there is power flow through either<br>
directional relay zero (DRZ) or all. command zero (ANZ). In case any of the<br>
crane contact is high but system has not issued any command the control relay<br>
zero (CRZ) will drop which will in turn drop the main contact (MC) of the crane.<br>
Please note that control off (C-OFF(R ) and control on remote (C-ON (R ) indicate<br>
the control ON and control OFF of radio remote system.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the PLC used in the present invention for generating an<br>
output to represent an all command zero (ANZ) to indicate that the motion<br>
commands are at zero.<br>
The PLC comprises a set of electrical contact having input and a separate set of<br>
contacts for the outputs. The way in which the input signals are processed can<br>
be programmed into the device, through an arrangement called the read only<br>
memory (ROM). The programming is conventionally known as the "Ladder<br>
Logic", and typically comprises of the arithmetic operators [+/-/*/Exp/Log etc)<br>
and logical operators [If/And/Nand/Or/Nor etc].<br>
In the present invention, the PLC logic comprises of processing the<br>
Long/Cross/Hoist increments sent by the Radio Remote Control device. Each<br>
time that a signal is received it changes the contact status of Long/Cross/Hoist<br>
Zero in the PLC. The Outputs comprise the All Zero Motion (ANZ) contact. The<br>
signal progresses in the sequence LTZ ? CTZ ? MHZ ? AHZ ? Cont1?<br>
OnDelay Timer? ANZ. The delay circuits implement calls to an internal clock,<br>
and the specific time [3 Sec], is coded into the program.<br>
The circuit is very simple and easy to implement. The circuit only uses free<br>
auxiliary contacts of the directional relay and two additional contactors.<br>
This improves the safe working condition of remote control cranes. As in this<br>
circuit the feedback is taken directly from the main output, any fault in between,<br>
generated from any intermediate circuit shall force the system to trip and put the<br>
equipment in to the fall safe condition. This is the crane is prevented from<br>
moving without any directional command. In case such a condition occurs the<br>
circuit trips the control power preventing any further motion in any direction.<br>
