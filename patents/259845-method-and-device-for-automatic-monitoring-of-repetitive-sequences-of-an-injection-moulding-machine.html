				<td>Method and Device for Automatic Monitoring of Repetitive Sequences<br>
of an Injection Moulding Machine<br>
Technical Scope<br>
The invention pertains to a method for monitoring repetitive sequences of an injection<br>
moulding machine and/or handling devices for injection moulding machines and<br>
identification of fluctuations or errors with respect to the sequence, and also a device for<br>
monitoring and repetitive sequences of injection moulding machine and/or handling<br>
devices of injection moulding machines and identification of fluctuations or errors with<br>
respect to the sequence.<br>
State-of-the-art Technology<br>
A first characteristic feature of injection moulding machines lies therein that sequences<br>
with several assembly groups, partly independent and partly working in a coordinated<br>
manner, are involved with movable parts. In the centre of the injection moulding<br>
machine is the casting mould. The mould lock is an independent assembly group, with<br>
which the movable mould half is brought into a closed position for casting readiness, and<br>
after the injection moulded parts have been cast and sufficiently cooled again, brought to<br>
the open position. On the opposite side of the machine, the injection aggregrate is<br>
arranged. The injection worm can be guided to the fixed mould half and after completion<br>
of the injection sequence again guided away. It is a pre-requisite, that for the working<br>
position a really large force is required:<br>
In case of mould closing, the force must be so large that the melting pressure<br>
required in the mould of say 1000 - 2000 bar may not open the mould halves, so<br>
that fluid melt can exit between the mould halves.<br><br>
2<br>
In case of the aggregrate pressing, similarly it holds good, that the pressing force<br>
has to be so large that between the injection nozzle and the corresponding mould<br>
entry opening no gap is created and no fluid melt can exit.<br>
In both cases it is almost an art to be able to select the pressing or closing forces<br>
sufficiently large, but however not unnecessarily large. Therefore one endeavours<br>
for an optimum pressing force within a highest run and a lowest run. Independent<br>
of the optimum force, it has to be ensured that in automatic operation no machine<br>
damages occur. The closing mechanism should not apply the mould closing force<br>
"blindly", if for example entire injection moulded parts or plastic residues of the<br>
previous injection cycle are still adhering to the mould half. In case of the<br>
injection nozzle there should not be any solidified plastic melt between the mould<br>
and the injection nozzle. In both cases a "blind" automatic movement sequence<br>
of the mould closing or the drive up movement of the nozzle can result in an<br>
erroneous situation or even cause damages to the concerned construction element.<br>
At least in the case of the mould lock, nowadays a mould lock safety is a pre-<br>
requisite. The mould lock safety is supposed to, in the case of any fluctuations in<br>
movement sequence, e.g. not regular increases in mould lock forces, immediately<br>
introduce an emergency stop for the mould movement.<br>
DE 43 45 034 shows such a mould protection safety mechanism. As solution the<br>
following are suggested:<br>
a)	slowing down of the closing movement to 20% or 10% in the region shortly<br>
before contact of both mould halves;<br>
b)	measuring and storing the effective force requirement of all forces acting against<br>
the movement of the mould half till contact, particularly frictional forces, in a first<br>
closing sequence, so that<br>
c)	every following mould protection phase can be controlled and monitored on the<br>
basis of the tolerance range laid down, and in case of excess forces to introduce a<br>
stop immediately.<br><br>
3<br>
At the same time, one starts on the basis of an ideal force. Any fluctuation, generally an<br>
increase in closing force, is detected as error and accordingly an emergency stop is<br>
introduced.<br>
In EP 0 25 987 it is suggested that the pressure- or force graph be monitored and<br>
optimised during its stroke movement, e.g. the tool carrier, according to the already<br>
described closing movement, especially with respect to the traverse part or the<br>
corresponding rate values.<br>
Both solutions have the disadvantage that the control of the drive movement and the drive<br>
safety is conducted together, i.e. on the basis of the same agents. The drive safety is<br>
dependent on the proper functioning of the control of the drive movement as well as its<br>
sensor agents.<br>
EP 0 296 183 too deals with a method for protection of moulds in injection moulding of<br>
plastics, during closing. The mobile mould half is moved with a pre-given speed profile<br>
against the fixed mould and the hydraulic closing pressure is restricted to a value that lies<br>
above its standard value by a pre-determined adjustable amount. For this, it is suggested<br>
that the standard value has been laid down by continuous measurement of the time<br>
sequence of the hydraulic pressure, at least in the locking phase of the closing movement<br>
of a previous closing sequence, and the pressure progression is monitored during its<br>
closing sequence. The closing sequence is always interrupted if the hydraulic pressure in<br>
the pressure progression lies above the measured standard value by a pre-determined<br>
amount. As a special extension, it is further suggested that the pressure progression in<br>
the immediately preceding closing sequence be selected as standard value. EP 0 096 183<br>
suggests a constant tolerance range that makes sense only in a particular situation, mainly<br>
in the locking phase of the closing movement of the mould tool. The preceding phases<br>
cannot be protected in this way.<br>
Another solution often use in the part is that a fixed value is selected for the mould<br>
protection. The advantages of such solutions lie on the simplicity on the one hand and,<br><br>
4<br>
on the other hand, in the fact that no computer-/storage agents are required. The big<br>
disadvantages however are that the drive safety is disproportionately insensitive and can<br>
be applied only for the actual mould protection. In all solutions according to the state-of-<br>
the-art technology an earlier identification of errors is hardly possible.<br>
A second characteristic feature is the cyclic progression of individual sequences. At least<br>
observed from outside, all movements, sequences and progressions repeat themselves<br>
from cycle to cycle apparently without any changes. The higher the quality demand and<br>
the automation degree, the more one can identify the variation in the progression in the<br>
individual parameters. In the state-of-the-art technology one tries to at least counter a<br>
part of the variation through more and more perfectionist regulation, or to reduce the<br>
variation to an acceptable extent. Here two problem areas crop up, in the first case with<br>
moved parts, in the second case without moved parts:<br>
•	In a regulated sequence, for example in injection, one parameter is always<br>
regulated, e.g. the speed of movement of the injection axis. This results in an<br>
injection pressure on the melt. The injection pressure is monitored with respect to<br>
adherence to pre-given ranges.<br>
•	A second problem area lies in sequences without moved parts. An example for<br>
this is the intermediate circuit voltage of inverters. Even here a particular range is<br>
monitored.<br>
It is interesting that in all mentioned characteristic features the critical parameters are<br>
monitored. This can be a highest value or a lowest value. With the help of the<br>
corresponding sensors or rated values of concerned components, corresponding alarm<br>
signals are giving to the machine control mechanism in case of exceeding or falling<br>
below, on the basis of which an immediate switching off or a stop action can be released.<br>
However, the fact that at least in the case of serious fluctuations during which an<br>
immediate switching off or immediate stop has to be introduced, it often takes place too<br>
late. If the limits are set too close then this could lead to several unnecessary switch-offs.<br><br>
5<br>
The solutions according to the state-of-the-art technology do not allow any earlier<br>
identification of discontinuity, fluctuations or errors in sequence.<br>
It is now the task of this invention to look for a method as well as a device that can be<br>
generally applied, and which with the maximum possible sensitiveness allows an<br>
automatic monitoring safety of repetitive sequences, particularly the drive movement in<br>
injection moulding machines, i.e. a high safety for an emergency stop, however no<br>
unnecessary stop of the drive movements and early identification of errors.<br>
Presentation of the Invention<br>
The method as per the invention has the characteristic feature that in normal production<br>
the repetitive sequence of at least a part process is pre-given and a measurable parameter<br>
influenced by the part process is identified with respect to the sequence monitoring in<br>
short scanning intervals and compared with limit values that are formed from several<br>
earlier scanned values of the same sequence through an algorithm.<br>
The device as per the invention has the characteristic feature that in normal production<br>
the repetitive sequence or progression can be pre-given, and the device has storage-<br>
/computer agents, particularly sensor agents, through which measurable parameters<br>
influenced within a part process can be automatically identified with respect to the<br>
sequence monitoring in short scanning intervals and can be compared to limit values that<br>
have been formed from several earlier determined scanned values of the same sequence<br>
through an algorithm.<br>
It is very interesting that the new invention allows three new solution paths.<br>
1)	One can realise a drive path safety working with very high standard.<br>
2)	In individually regulated sequences, e.g. injection, the respective not regulated<br>
parameters can be monitored according to the invention.<br><br>
6<br>
3) However, even in components without moved parts, e.g. the inverter voltage can<br>
be monitored according to the invention.<br>
As will be described below, the new invention not only monitors the moment of an error<br>
but, works on the basis of earlier similar sequences and already identifies occurring<br>
defects. One takes the preceding results and assesses at every moment in a predicted<br>
manner any possible developing error, whereby the sensitivity with respect to an alarm or<br>
interruption decision is automatically adapted to the process control for monitoring and<br>
maximum possible sensitivity, however without erroneous activation.<br>
It has been determined by the inventors that according to the first solution path the basic<br>
requirement of monitoring of drive movement in the state-of-the-art technology has not<br>
been adequately considered. The basic requirement lies in the special uniqueness of<br>
injection moulding machine, in which almost all movements are determined by the<br>
sequence/progression of the injection moulding process. In the movable axes of the<br>
injection moulding machine one does not know the classical division of almost forced-<br>
less drive up to the working position and thereafter a greater use of the working tool, e.g.<br>
in a milling or boring machine. The drive up itself can already be afflicted with great<br>
problems. The problems of any nature occur in the interior of the machine, partly even<br>
completely within the tool.<br>
The objective of automatic monitoring therefore has to be:<br>
•	Monitoring of individual or all sequence phases for movements forward and<br>
backward;<br>
•	Monitoring and drive safety without erroneous activation;<br>
•	For normal production no purely empirical input of limiting values should be<br>
used; rather during an automatic operation a self-optimisation should be possible<br>
to match up to all possible normal operating conditions.<br>
•	The pre-requisite has to be created, that a maximum sensitivity be automatically<br>
in the process dispersions, from shot to shot.<br><br>
7<br>
The new invention therefore foresees that repetitive drive movements are monitored by<br>
movable components of the injection moulding machine and/or handling devices of<br>
injection moulding machine with the help of momentary actual values of pressure/force<br>
determined in scanned intervals at least in part sections of the drive movement. This<br>
includes a constant optimisation of the drive safety. Division of the part section is<br>
absolutely important, so that the drive safety in each situation can be adapted over the<br>
entire drive part.<br>
The invention allows a large number of advantageous extensions. For this, please refer to<br>
the claims 4 to 17 and 19 to 25. Interval limiting values or group limiting values are<br>
determined with the algorithm and laid as a basis of the following cycle. This has the<br>
decisive advantage that - as in the state-of-the-art technology - it is not a single safety<br>
range that is laid down for the entire drive movement, but from situation to situation a<br>
momentary optimum limiting value is provided, whether it be for a start of the normal<br>
and often almost force-less shifting movement or the great force build up at the end of the<br>
movement, like e.g. during form locking or while pressing on the injection nozzle.<br>
The group limiting values are statistically determined and obviously used as prescribed<br>
values for forming an operation reference graph, whereby the determination takes place<br>
at least over several cycles. This means that the limiting values are adapted in each<br>
situation over the drive path, which ensures a maximum safety for example with respect<br>
to possible accidents, whether it is pertaining to persons or machine parts.<br>
A central concept of the new solution lies in the assessment of a group of scanned values.<br>
This allows us to measure, analyse the pressure-Zforce values in scanned intervals of<br>
milliseconds or fractions of seconds and then to immediately react according to the<br>
situation. In this way fluctuations in the highest progression (peaks) as well as in the<br>
lowest progression within a group of group limiting values can be optimally considered.<br>
whereby each group includes several scanned intervals, e.g. ten or more. A further very<br>
important point is that the individual scanned values are evaluated for monitoring the<br>
drive movement as a function of the group limiting values. A scanned value is therefore<br><br>
8<br>
evaluated not with the individual preceding scanned value at the same point but as a<br>
function of an entire group of earlier limiting values. There is further the possibility that<br>
the number of scanned values per group and the location of the group along the drive<br>
movement can be determined according to the situation.<br>
Another advantageous extension concept is that fluctuations in the highest progression<br>
(peaks) are determined within a group of successive scanned values and changes in the<br>
group limiting values from cycle to cycle<br>
a)	are considered immediately for the following cycle in case of increase in the<br>
scanned values; and<br>
b)	considered with delay in case of drop in the scanned values.<br>
An increase in scanned value in peak run could announce a danger situation. One has to<br>
react immediately. A drop would then hardly mean any danger, so that a delay would be<br>
justified.<br>
The situation is reversed in lowest run. Fluctuations in lowest run are determined within<br>
a group of successive scanned values and changes in group limiting values from cycle to<br>
cycle<br>
a)	are considered in a delayed manner for the following cycle in case of increase in<br>
scanned values; and<br>
b)	considered immediately in case of drop in scanned values.<br>
If one falls short of the required lowest run for the function, then generally the sequence<br>
function is no longer guaranteed. Depending on the progression of the drive path it could<br>
be advantageous to calculate comparative limiting values for one or more groups. The<br>
individual limiting values for monitoring the scanned values are formed from the group<br>
limiting values with a calculating function.<br>
From several successive scanned values a group limiting value is determined and from all<br>
determined group limiting values a reference graph is formed. The number of scanned<br><br>
9<br>
values per group and the position or the moment of the group in the sequence is laid<br>
down according to the situation in a part process. It is however also possible, that<br>
comparative limiting values are determined only in part regions of the drive movement.<br>
The reference graph has the big advantage that a part of or the entire drive path is<br>
monitored for all local situations, without continuously having to do calculations<br>
unnecessarily. The group scanned values for monitoring the drive movement are<br>
continuously evaluated as a function of the reference graph.<br>
According to another very advantageous extension concept, during the first drive<br>
movement while commissioning the machine a start reference graph with a start safety is<br>
laid down, whereby for the following cycle the start reference graph is self-adapted stage-<br>
wise and reduced to an operation comparison graph. During first commissioning it is<br>
important that one does not immediately switch off on account of any small defect/error<br>
due to safety measures. It is a pre-requisite that the erector is here also part of the<br>
monitoring, with the highest degree of attention. For one or more scanning groups, on<br>
the basis of the comparison limiting values a tolerance is laid down for alarm or<br>
interruption decision for continuing the movement. A switch-off is decided statistically<br>
or if required on the basis of experience, whereby the tolerance is preferably laid down in<br>
such a way that for two or more instances of exceeding the start comparison limiting<br>
value, a signal is given out to the machine control mechanism for interrupting the<br>
movement. The new solution allows adaptation of the sensitivity with respect to an alarm<br>
or interruption decision automatically to the process dispersions with the objective of<br>
monitoring with the highest possible sensitivity, however without erroneous activation.<br>
According to another advantageous solution path, it is suggested that an absolute drive<br>
path safety be laid down with pre-given fixed limiting values for the scanned values,<br>
whereby with the fixed limiting values also an upper limit can be laid down for the peak<br>
run of the adaptive comparative values that can be laid down. In this way the client is<br>
free to drive continuously with the absolute drive path safety corresponding to the<br>
solution in the state-of-the-art technology. He has the advantage of, on the one hand,<br>
having reliable employees and, on the other hand, a mechanical safety against damages to<br><br>
10<br>
the machine parts. There is also the possibility that the user for example works while<br>
commissioning with absolute drive path safety and only later switches on an automatic<br>
drive path safety, during which the movement over at least a part or the entire drive<br>
movement is ensured without adjustments.<br>
It has been found out by the inventors that the drive safety has to be organised<br>
independent of or separately from the control and regulation instructions for the drive<br>
movement. The momentary pressure-Aforce actual values have to be continuously<br>
determined. By pressure-Vforce actual values one understands values that set in as<br>
reaction to the movement, e.g. in the form of local carrier-, system- or bearing loads. It<br>
can also be a hydraulic pressure or a motor torque. It is very important that dynamic<br>
forces from acceleration as well as retardation and frictional forces, on the one hand, and<br>
real defects, e.g. crack in a lubrication film or erroneous retention of whole or part of<br>
injected parts, on the other hand, can be determined. All reactive forces acting against<br>
the desired movement have to be determined and accordingly the real actual values of the<br>
reaction forces against the drive movements will have to be determined. A disturbance<br>
can also be in the form of lubricating film that it badly formed. If it has to do with<br>
relatively small masses to be moved like ejectors, however with significant forces for the<br>
corresponding function, then the running motor current consumption would be sufficient.<br>
If it has to do with large masses to be moved, then the actual reactive forces from the<br>
movement, whether it is on fixed or moved component, have to be determined.<br>
A core concept of a new invention is that the drive safety is at the same time completely<br>
active in the 'background' already in the first injection cycle, without the operator having<br>
to adjust anything. In practice, a new tool is built in by the erector. He can then through<br>
service points check and align not only the movement progression but also the<br>
adaptability of the tool halves to one another. This generally takes place manually. It is<br>
not at all significant, as to what extent automatic agents are playing a role in monitoring.<br>
It is important that determination of the scanned values is involved for manual operation<br>
or semi-automatic operation. Scanning of the resistance forces takes place in any case, so<br>
that values above the drive path are stored already for the first injection cycle. The drive<br><br>
11<br>
safety should preferably be part of the machine control mechanism and can be released<br>
only by trained personnel, e.g. for service jobs. For the regular working purpose the<br>
drive safety is always active already in the erection phase and continuously determines<br>
the relevant reactive pressures and/or forces.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous extension, the path of the movable parts is<br>
divided into several small individual situations and the drive movement is protected with<br>
respect to the following individual situation. Thus the drive safety can work according to<br>
the situation and allows protection of the movement through at least one part or the entire<br>
drive movement without any adjustment. This gives the distinctive advantage that any<br>
drive situation can be determined and monitored:<br>
starting<br>
constant movement<br>
acceleration/retardation<br>
acting of huge inertia forces of the concerned masses.<br>
Another very interesting concept is that the pressure-/force values are measured and<br>
analysed in the range of milliseconds or fractions of milliseconds. Measurement and<br>
analysis require one or more high capacity computers because a decision is taken within<br>
several milliseconds.<br>
The new solution suggests that already during first commissioning of the moved parts the<br>
pressure -/force values be measured and analysed, whereby the drive safety is designed in<br>
an adaptable or learnable manner in such a way, that situations can be pre-given on the<br>
basis of an input of earlier similar cases, or that errors during first test runs are detected<br>
by the erector himself and prevented. Here one can see the advantages of the drive safety<br>
according to situations. For example, the first very short starting peak can be handled<br>
specially and on exceeding a pre-given fixed safety value, unnecessary stop can be<br>
prevented. The same hold goods even for strong acceleration and retardation of large<br>
masses. In the concrete extension it is suggested that the pressure-/force measured values<br>
be measured and analysed during each drive movement, whereby for every section or<br><br>
12<br>
individual situation a reference point is calculated and from the result of the reference<br>
point a reference graph is formed, especially by linear interpolation. The reference graph<br>
is equipped for all special situations. A compulsive result is that the safety march for an<br>
emergency stop at least for the most important situation is selected differently. It is also<br>
important that not every short-term force or pressure in fact can already release an<br>
emergency stop, but for example two or three impacts above the set limit would only<br>
release a movement stop. The pressure-/force measured values are continuously analysed<br>
during each drive movement and a possible error situation is determined according to an<br>
algorithm, whereby the algorithm itself determines an error situation. The algorithm can<br>
be a simple safety ratio number or a mathematical formula. The repetitive drive<br>
movement is pre-given with the help of the machine control mechanism independent of<br>
the drive safety. The drive safety determines error situations and on occurrence of an<br>
error situation gives the machine control mechanism the corresponding signals for<br>
introducing or preparing the necessary measures. The pressure-/force monitoring for the<br>
drive safety takes place independent of the pressure- and/or force sensors that the<br>
machine control mechanism uses for the drive movement. This holds good at least for<br>
the mould lock as well as the aggregate movement. The drive safety is particularly used<br>
for the movable part of the mould locking. As the greatest masses and forces of the<br>
injection moulding machine come into play here, a reactive force or a reactive pressure is<br>
determined, whether it be on the directly loaded part, the standstill part or the movable<br>
part of the mould locking. This can be in the region of the fixed mould clamping plate of<br>
the locking mechanism or the drive plate. The new solution is however suitable as drive<br>
safety for all moved parts, e.g. for the aggregate shifting, the axial or rotating movement<br>
of the plasticization or extruding worm and/or the movable parts, the ejector and/or the<br>
core draws and/or the devices for injection moulded parts removal from the open mould<br>
and/or for parts of a shot pots.<br>
The injection moulding machine control mechanism has a storage agent for storing the<br>
optimum sensitivity determined for a special injection job and instruction data for a<br>
subsequent new injection job, in such a way that at the beginning of a first injection cycle<br>
the drive safety is already laid in such a way that the injection job can be carried out<br><br>
13<br>
without pre-setting the drive safety, so that for each subsequent job with the same<br>
injection moulding tool one can start with the optimum sensitivity determined<br>
beforehand. The learning drive safety is a part of the basic software and can be used by<br>
different axes with different measuring and regulating parameters. It can be the learning<br>
drive safety also for injection pressure monitoring while injecting instead of the present<br>
two-stage monitoring. Further application examples could be monitoring of the speed of<br>
the injection axes during post-pressure and monitoring intermediate circuit voltage during<br>
a cycle or a phase of the cycle.<br>
According to the second solution path a respective not-regulated parameter, particularly a<br>
speed, a pressure, a force, a path or a torque of a sequence or progression is monitored.<br>
The big advantage is that the experience of the past is completely taken into account in<br>
the monitoring concept and thus the requirement of best possible safety along with least<br>
possible occurrence of error quota is ensured.<br>
According to the third solution path the cyclic progression of a component without<br>
moved parts is monitored. Depending on the component, it could be monitoring of the<br>
current (A) or the voltage (V) of say the inverter.<br>

Ways and Execution of the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 and 2 show purely schematically the progression of the scanned values 1 that are<br>
taken in scanned intervals 2. The scanned interval 2 can, as shown in the example, be in<br>
milliseconds. It is however possible that the scanned interval 2 amounts to a greater time<br>
range of lesser or more than 1 millisecond. A very interesting point is the combination of<br>
several scanning intervals 2 into scanning groups 3. Theoretically for each scanned value<br>
1 a limiting value 4 can be determined on the basis of the corresponding algorithm. The<br>
new solution however goes in a different way, in that scanning groups 3 are formed as<br>
one can see in fig. 2. The new invention suggests that group limiting values 5 be<br>
determined on scanning groups 3. Only from the group limiting values 5 comparative<br>
limiting values 6 and from the comparative limiting values 6 a reference graph 7 is<br><br>
15<br>
determined. As one can see in fig. 2, the scanning groups 3 do not necessarily have to<br>
have the same number of scanning intervals. For example, in the start phase few scanned<br>
value can be determined or many scanned values in shorter time. For a uniform drive<br>
movement the number of scanning intervals can accordingly be the much greater. At the<br>
end of the drive movement a situation can prevail like during the start. In the practical<br>
example an operation reference graph 7 is set higher by a minimum value of say Sn &gt; 0.5<br>
KN than from a theoretical reference graph obtained. For the start a start reference graph<br>
8 is laid down that lies higher than the operation reference graph 7 by a safety value "S'according to fig. 8, with a start correction value 9.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the group limiting value formation as first step for formation of the<br>
reference graph. For each scanning group respectively the highest scanned value is<br>
selected for forming a group limiting value.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a second step in the formation of the reference graph. If the desired value<br>
parameters are changed (position, speed) then the reference graph has to be structured<br>
afresh. In the first cycle the fine tool safety does not work, as information has to be<br>
collected first. As during the first commissioning still no reference graph exists in the<br>
sense of the invention, one works with an absolute drive path safety, e.g. according to the<br>
solution in the state-of-the-art technology. As in the first cycle always irregularities and<br>
run-ins occur, the information for the reference graph has to be collected over several<br>
cycles, so that a statistically representative statement can be made. In order to prevent<br>
erroneous activation of the tool safety during the phase where adequate information<br>
(number of cycles) has not yet been collected, a start safety value "S" is added to the<br>
reference graph, which ensures that fluctuations do not lead to an erroneous release of the<br>
tool safety.<br>
Fig. 5 shows of the interpolation of the intermediate value of the reference graph.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the reference graph with the measured pressure -<br>
/force/actual values. Exceeding the reference graph is counted in sequence. Each<br><br>
16<br>
shortfall of the reference graph sets the counter back. If the counter for example reaches<br>
three exceedings in succession, then the criterion "exceeding'" is considered to have<br>
happened, so that immediately a corresponding signal is given out to the machine control<br>
mechanism.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a suggestion for optimising the sensitivity of the drive safety. Through run-<br>
in effects the drive resistance can become lesser and regular. So that the reference graph<br>
can also learn run-in effects, the algorithm shown in fig. 7 can be used. For each time<br>
slot it is checked whether the following condition is always fulfilled:<br>
Reference graph R 1ST signal-learning correction value L 
If this condition is fulfilled during the entire slot, then a counter belonging to the time slot<br>
is increased by +1. When the counter reaches the learning duration P (number of cycles),<br>
the reference graph in this time slot is corrected (subtraction) by 1/2 learning correction<br>
value.<br>
If the condition is not fulfilled in a cycle, then the counter is set back to 0. Meaningful<br>
values for the tool safety are:<br>
Learning duration T =- 100 cycles<br>
Learning correction value = 0.1 kN<br>
Fig. 8 shows structuring of the reference graph. While starting the tool closing there are<br>
great dispersions, as the start position of the tool closing movement can disperse up to 0.2<br>
mm. Especially after manual operation the start position cannot be reproduced.<br>
Moreover, the drive resistances are higher after longer standstill periods, as a lubrication<br>
film has to first get formed again. After standstill periods greater than stand time Tl not<br>
only the learnt reference graph is used, which in this situation could be very sharp, but<br>
one proceeds as in the case of the structuring of the reference graph, except that one starts<br>
with value 1. So that while starting, the position uncertainties that could not be<br><br>
17<br>
statistically learnt (due to manual operation) do not lead to erroneous releases of the tool<br>
safety, one generally does not release the tool safety during the first T<br>
STARTVERZOGERUNG (start delay) during tool closing. T Startverz --= 50 ms.<br>
Adaptive drive safety: if the machine is operated the first time with the new tool, then the<br>
control mechanism knows very little about the force measuring signal to be expected<br>
during the tool movement. This measured signal is complex and without additional<br>
information can only be evaluated in a rudimentary manner. In this situation only a<br>
simple limiting value can come in question. During the first movement only a simple<br>
limiting value "basis drive safety" is effective.<br>
First movement means: the first movement after changing the parameters that can<br>
influence the force measuring signal:<br>
•	tool movement and tool position parameters<br>
•	eventually pressing on the aggregate, ejector, handling (indirect influence).<br>
The actual tool safety in the sense of the state-of-the-art technology is active only over<br>
the last one-third of the tool stroke, so that adequately high sensitivity can be attained.<br>
One can think of defining an own limiting value for the erection movements as the<br>
sensitivity could increase due to the low speeds. This basis drive safety is effective in all<br>
operating conditions while closing the tool. If after parameter changes the machine is<br>
operated the first time in such a way that the movement of the tool over the entire stroke<br>
in automatic mode (not tilt operation) drives with production speed, then the force<br>
progression can be analysed and a limiting graph can be calculated from it. This graph<br>
contains the information about the force progression of the closing movement for the<br>
given conditions. These movement cycles repeat themselves at random, but are mainly<br>
identical, however differ, in that each graph contains statistical variations than can lead to<br>
erroneous activation of monitoring.<br>
An important task of the algorithm that makes formation of the reference curve and the<br>
evaluation of the error condition possible is, on the one hand, to take into consideration<br><br>
18<br>
these dispersions and achieve a high sensitivity, however on the other hand, to rule out<br>
erroneous releases. Additionally there are run-in effects, temperature-related forces and<br>
influences that are dependent on the structure of the lubricating film. Till today, for this<br>
the operator had to fall back empirically on the limit by always increasing the sensitivity<br>
till he determined the erroneous activation. Thereafter the sensitivity is somewhat<br>
reduced and it was hoped that now there would no longer be any erroneous activation,<br>
which generally also functioned for an operating point. The observations hold good for<br>
all movements.<br>
User's point of view:<br>
The user does not have to adjust or set anything. There is a configuration level where the<br>
algorithm can be parametered in order to be in command of special cases.<br>
Parameter: maximum force during closing movement<br>
FXXX=50kN(l -99kN)<br>
Default: 5% of the maximum closing force<br>
Parameter: percentage of the stroke with active tool safety<br>
YXXX-30%(0- 100%)<br>
Default: 30% of the programmed stroke.<br>
Sensitivity test of the drive safety:<br>
As the entire optimisation takes place in a hidden manner and an operator does not have<br>
to contribute anything to it, there could be the desire to quantify the result of<br>
optimisation. For this a simple test is suitable: in the automatic cycle an error (defined<br>
force signal) is superimposed on the actual force signal without allowing the algorithm to<br>
learn this. By changing this error a release can be generated and hence it can be forecast,<br>
at which sensitivity level the activation threshold for the actual production cycle lies.<br>
The error can be set with respect to the amplitude and the position of the drive path<br>
through parameters.<br><br>
19<br>
The operator gets three parameters:	test switch on/off<br>
Position of the drive path at which the error<br>
effect gets released becomes the force<br>
amplitude of the error.<br>
Limits for adaptation:<br>
On the one hand, adapting to the actual situation is a strength of the applied algorithm; on<br>
the other hand, slow changes that the adaptation can follow should not lead to attaining<br>
impermissible operating ranges. If for example, during a traverse draw the lubrication<br>
gets worse and worse, with each cycle the friction becomes greater till ultimately the<br>
traverse draw "eats up". In order to avoid this undesirable effect, limits are laid down<br>
within which the algorithm can adapt itself. On exceeding this limit a corresponding<br>
error case is generated and the error reaction released; information for detecting a drive<br>
safety case and test of reaction of the test safety.<br>
If the monitoring gets activated, a system alarm is generated and the following<br>
parameters are given: position and speed at release point. Both these values permit an<br>
assessment of the remaining brake path and can be evaluated with the optical result of a<br>
jammed part. If the part is crushed very strongly, then the speed at the release point has<br>
to be reduced. The speed at the release point is the only parameter at the disposal of the<br>
operator in order to influence the result of a drive safety case. Ideally, the experiments<br>
for optimisation of the reaction can be done, without parts getting jammed. This<br>
possibility can be offered, in that the operator can release a drive safety occurrence in the<br>
production without a part getting jammed.<br>
On the basis of information of the system alarms it can be assessed whether a speed at the<br>
release point is too high or has to be increased further so that an optimum cycle time can<br>
be attained.<br><br>
20<br>
The operator gets three parameters:	test switching on/off<br>
Position of the drive path at which the error<br>
is released becomes force amplitude of the<br>
error (amplitude to be set at maximum).<br>
Reaction to drive safety cases:<br>
The reaction constitutes the quickest possible delay of the movement till standstill<br>
without damaging the drive or shifting the machine. Depending on whether the<br>
movement can be completely stopped or there is still a residual speed during crushing of<br>
the part, there occurs a force peak that acts on the tool. In order to have, apart from the<br>
result of the crushed part, a quantifiable magnitude for the occurrence, a system alarm is<br>
given out with the parameters force of the force speed and the corresponding position.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a practical example for a measured value progression over the entire<br>
movement of the closing tool with an optimally adapted reference graph.<br>
The invention is presented below on the basis of drive safeties of the closing movement<br>
of the mould lock, particularly the tool safety. In principle, each linear axis can be<br>
monitored in the manner described here, irrespective of whether the drives are hydraulic,<br>
electrical or pneumatic. The force information is obtained from a force receiver, a<br>
differential pressure measurement through cylinders, oil engines or pneumatic engine or<br>
from the torque information of electrical drives. It is obvious that not all these variants<br>
deliver the same quality of monitoring.<br>
The objective of tool safety is, during a closing sequence not to allow any damaging<br>
forces to act on the tool due to undesired occurrences (generally jammed plastic parts).<br>
This pre-requires that such occurrences be identified and that one reacts fast enough. In<br>
order to identify the occurrence, the force that acts on the movable mould plate is<br>
measured on the toggle lever by expansion measuring strips. As jammed parts typically<br>
allow the force to increase continuously till the tool movement get stopped, the release<br>
sensitivity influences the stop sequence only to the extent that one reacts a few ms earlier<br><br>
21<br>
or later. It is very important that no erroneous releases occur because they lead to<br>
bothersome production interruptions that cannot be tolerated. As the tool movement<br>
continuously generates inertia forces due to acceleration and retardation that the sensor<br>
measures, a way has to be found to filter out these forces. For this purpose, the actual<br>
situation has to be first determined. During the first determination of the situation the<br>
tool safety is not yet sensitive. According to the new solution always a minimum tool<br>
safety has to be active. After determining the actual situation a sensitive tool safety can<br>
become effective. The tool safety can be sensitive only if slow changes, e.g. friction or<br>
thermal changes, can be filtered out. This however has the intrinsic danger that creeping<br>
changes would never lead to activation of the tool safety. Therefore, a limitation of the<br>
adaptation has to be foreseen, so that traverse draws with insufficient lubrication can lead<br>
to activation before they eat up.<br>
Movements from other axes (ejector, aggregate, handling etc.) can also have effects on<br>
the signal offeree measurement through the inertia forces, which has to be taken into<br>
account. After a tool safety occurrence is detected, a stop reaction is released. The<br>
reaction speed of the drive determines the result: the faster one can apply the brakes the<br>
lesser the crushing force gets built up, the kinetic energy is taken up by the drive instead<br>
of by the crushed part and the sensitive tool.<br>
For this two tasks have to be fulfilled:<br>
•	Reliable detection of the drive safety errors without erroneous release;<br>
•	Quick stopping of the drive in order to limit the crushing force.<br>
In order to be able to detect the drive safety errors, the measured values from the force<br>
signal have to be compared with reference values.<br>
•	In all operating conditions an error situation has to be identified by the force<br>
progression.<br>
•	In the operating condition of production an optimum sensitivity to error situations<br>
has to be achieved without manual intervention. Erroneous releases cannot be<br>
tolerated.<br><br>
22<br>
• Creeping changes are filtered out up to an adjustable limit.<br>
For each of the above mentioned three cases own reference values have to be determined.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the situation during injection. During the injection sequence the speed of<br>
the injection axis is regulated and it results in an injection pressure. This is obtained from<br>
the mechanical (tool, worm geometry etc.) and the physical (temperature of the melt,<br>
velocity etc.) surroundings. Here the injection pressure is used as the parameter to be<br>
monitored and a learning graph is plotted. The method of plotting the comparative graph<br>
is the same as for the tool safety, because the same software code is used. The distance<br>
between the comparative graph and the starting phase is accordingly adjusted through a<br>
configuration.<br>
Fig. 11 shows the situation during post-pressure. During the post-pressure phase the<br>
pressure is regulated and this results in the movement of the injection axis. The speed or<br>
the path can be measured as the magnitude to be monitored and monitored with the help<br>
of a comparative graph. Even here the comparative graph(s) is/are plotted over the speed<br>
or the path with the same piece of software. Only the initial magnitude/parameter is not a<br>
force but a speed or a position. In this example it could be meaningful to monitor not<br>
only the upper limit but also the lower limit. For this one requires two comparative<br>
graphs, one above and one below the actual value progression. Both the graphs are<br>
created independent of one another with the same algorithm.<br>
Fig. 12 schematically shows an injection aggregate.<br>
Fig. 13 schematically shows the components for the intermediate circuit voltage. The<br>
objective is to monitor the intermediate circuit voltage over a single cycle and from cycle<br>
to cycle. The result can also be used for quality monitoring.<br>
Fig. 14 shows monitoring of the intermediate circuit voltage over a cycle. The graphic<br>
shows a possible progression of intermediate circuit voltage, over which a comparative<br><br>
23<br>
graph can be laid. The initial parameter for the drive safety is in this case a voltage.<br>
Here too it would be meaningful to monitor the upper and lower limit.<br>
Fig. 15 symbolically shows an injection moulding machine 30. Out of the several<br>
individual components "X" only the following are indicated: drive or axis, mould<br>
movement 31, ejector 32, movable mould or tool 33, worm 34, linear drive of the worm<br>
(linear axis) 35 and rotation drive of the worm (rotation axis) 36, aggregate 37, protective<br>
cover 38.<br>
Fig. 16 shows fig. 2 of EP 0 025 987. In this solution according to the state-of-the-art<br>
technology the drive safety is at the same time integrated into the control mechanism of<br>
the drive path of the tool carrier. The vertical axis is marked "O", whereby P represents<br>
the time intervals. The horizontal axis Q is the time axis. According to EP 0 025 987 the<br>
progression of the curve R is adapted in an optimum manner to a pre-given value. In the<br>
region marked T and U first upper values either pre-given by a computer or manually<br>
determined are given, so that in the following injection cycle corrected graphs T or U set<br>
in.<br>
Fig. 17 shows fig. 1 of EP 0 096 193 and depicts a solution for tool safety frequently<br>
applied in the state-of-the-art technology. Setting of the device requires conducting of a<br>
closing sequence with empty tool with a minimum pressure progression po(t) and with<br>
pre-given data of a fixed tolerance value and the tolerance range Pfs(t) obtained from it.<br>
In this way any hindrance of closing can be immediately identified and the signal for<br>
immediate ending of the closing sequence can be used.<br><br>

23.	Device as per one of the claims 18 to 22,<br>
in which the movable parts pertain to the specific axes of a PET-machine for<br>
producing pre-forms, particularly a removal robot and/or a hand over station<br>
and/or a cooling station.<br>
24.	Device as per one of the claims 18 to 23,<br>
in which the sequence or progression pertains to the voltage (V) and/or the<br>
current (A).<br>
25.	Device as per one of the claims 18 to 24,<br>
in which the injection moulding machine control mechanism has storage agents<br>
for storing an optimum sensitivity determined for a specific injection moulding<br>
job and data instructions for a subsequent new injection moulding job in such a<br>
way that the drive safety is already laid while beginning a first injection cycle in<br>
such a way that the injection moulding job can be carried out with complete drive<br>
safety without pre-setting the drive safety.<br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a device and method for<br>
automatically monitoring repetitive operational sequences on injection molding machines and/or on handling units to injection molding machines,<br>
and for identifying abnormalities or disruptions with regard to the operational sequence. During normal production operation, the repetitive<br>
operational sequence of at least one<br>
partial process is provided, and a<br>
measurable quantity (1), which is<br>
influenced by the partial process,<br>
regarding the operational sequence<br>
monitoring is automatically recorded<br>
in short sampling intervals (2). The<br>
sampled values are compared with<br>
limit values (6) that were formed, by<br>
using an algorithm, from a multitude<br>
of previous sampled values of the<br>
same operational sequence. The<br>
sensitivity is automatically adapted to<br>
the process variations with regard to<br>
a decision to alert or terminate. This<br>
novel solution permits the carrying<br>
out of monitoring with the highest<br>
possible sensitivity, however, without<br>
a negative response, e.g. repetitive<br>
traveling motion, but also for operational sequences without moving parts such as the d.c. link voltage in converters or during<br>
controlled processes for monitoring a quantity that is not controlled.<br></td>
