				<td>VEHICLE MOUNTED PLASTICS DRUM FOR CONCRETE MIXING AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE<br>
THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to concrete mixing apparatuses and more particularly relates to a<br>
vehicle mounted plastics drum for mixing concrete and a methods manufacture thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The building industry makes widespread use of concrete mixing trucks for transportation of<br>
ready mixed concrete to sites for concrete   poors.   These trucks typically comprise a large<br>
mixing assembly including a mixer drum mounted to the vehicle and which is connected to a<br>
mixer drive for mixing concrete contents during transportation and for discharge of the contents<br>
on site. The drive system comprises a gear box which takes power from the vehicle motor and<br>
which applies a mixing torque to the drum imparting axial rotation to the drum with the torque<br>
being adjustable depending upon the operating requirements. The above general arrangement is<br>
described in United States patent 4,585,356 which discloses a concrete mixer truck having a<br>
mixer drum adapted to be rotated by the traction motor of the vehicle through an auxiliary<br>
transmission of the traction motor transmission.<br>
According to the known vehicle mounted mixing assemblies, the mixing drum is typically of<br>
heavy duty steel construction and is disposed at approximately 10 to 15 degrees from horizontal.<br>
The drum is fitted with internal vanes or mixing blades defining an archimedian spiral so that as<br>
the drum rotates in a first direction the concrete held therein is mixed and as the drum is rotated<br>
in the opposite direction, the concrete is discharged from the drum via an elevated discharge<br>
orifice under the reverse action of the internal spiral vanes. The drum is disposed such that the<br>
drive end is lowest and the discharge end is highest relative to a generally horizontal plane of the<br>
vehicle.<br>
While steel drums have been in use for many years, they suffer from a number of attendant<br>
disadvantages, relating to their cost of manufacture and replacement, working life, wear<br>
characteristics, weight and volume.<br>
Steel drums are expensive to manufacture due to their labour intensive construction which<br>
involves rolling steel sheets into conical portions and cylinders which once fabricated are then<br>
welded to form the finished tank. The archimedian spirals formed from flat sheets are then<br>
welded into position inside the drum. As concrete is a highly abrasive material, internal surfaces<br>
of steel drums are subject to significant wear abrasion. This occurs particularly on the surfaces<br>
which take slump impact, sliding friction and shear load leading to eventual wearing out of the<br>
drum.<br>
Typically, a steel drum used every day might last three to five years, thereafter requiring<br>
replacement at significant cost. The abrasion of internal surfaces is increased where there are<br>
changes of slope in the drum walls usually where the segments of the drum are joined<br>
The mixing blades are welded to the internal surface of the drum causing sharp angled recesses<br>
in which concrete can gather and eventually build up degrading the internal surface and<br>
providing a catchment for further unwanted build up of concrete. By its nature, a steel surface is<br>
relatively smooth and whilst this may be desirable for the purpose of preventing concrete build<br>
up on the walls of the drum, the interface between the concrete and steel wall is an area of<br>
abrasion rather than concrete mixing.<br>
Ideally, mixing of concrete should take place throughout the whole mix, but in the steel drums,<br>
optimum mixing does not take place at the boundary layer and in crevices in which concrete<br>
may collect. In fact, due to the nature of the factional interface between the steel surface and<br>
concrete boundary layer, laminar flow occurs resulting in little or no mixing at the boundary<br>
layer. The reason for this is that the aggregate in the concrete slides and abrades ( with reduced<br>
or no mixing)  rather than rotates to facilitate mixing. Thus there are 'dead' spots in the mix where no mixing takes place and where there is an increased potential for unwanted collection of concrete. In addition to the above problems associated with the use of steel mixing drums, there are cost and weight factors which add to inherent inefficiencies in use of steel drums. Due to the dead weight of the steel drum, its volume must be restricted so the combination of the dead weight and concrete weight must be maintained within the maximum allowable loading limits for the vehicle to which the drum is attached The inventor to considered the possibility of using a lightweight material such as plastics for construction of a concrete mixing drum as a substitute for steel whilst recognising that there were numerous structural and manufacturing difficulties to be overcome in making the transition to plastics not the least of which was the production of a drum which could withstand the high static and dynamic loadings to which truck mounted mixing drums are subject to in normal operation. If the weight of the drum could be reduced without compromising and possibly increasing drum volume the weight reduction could be taken up with additional concrete thereby increasing the pay load.<br>
There are variety of concrete mixing drum arrangements disclosed in the prior art none of which as far as the inventor is aware anticipate the arrangements to be described herein. United States patent 4,491,415 discloses a lightweight, pear shaped rotary mixing device open at one end and having an axially elongated socket at the large end. The drum is rotatably supported on a unitary base having a transversely extended forward end and an upwardly and angularly extending rear end providing a bearing portion detachably engagable with the socket to rotatably<br>
support the drum at an inclination of about 35 degrees. The drum has a plurality of axially extending radial fins for lifting contents in rotation thereof and is preferably fashioned from<br>
molded plastics material either as a unitary body or as a plurality of interfitting parts. The drum described in this patent is for light duty operation and does not have the structural and materials characteristics necessary for heavy duty concrete mixing operations. United States Patent 5,118,198 discloses a cement mixing apparatus with a cradle support assembly and including a polyethelyne cement mixing drum held and supported by a cradle arm assembly formed of cradle base support braces and upright cradle arms which interfit into cradle arm recesses which are preformed with the polyethylene drum. A bull gear drives the polyethylene drum. The drum disclosed in this patent is intended for light duty cement operations and does not address the structural and manufacturing requirements for heavy duty operations. United States patent 5,492,401 discloses a concrete mixer with a mixing drum consisting of high density crosslinked polyethylene material. The drum includes a bottom supported buy a conventional rigid metal pan secured to the external surface thereof to rigidiry the plastic drum and extend the life expectancy of the plastic drum by enabling the concrete mixer to be used to complete a mixing job at a job site even though movement of the concrete mix within the drum during repetitive mixing cycles may ultimately wear a hole through the bottom of the plastic drum. Paddle assemblies are positioned interiorly of the drum and oriented to maintain minimum splashing during the mixing operation. Not only is the drum disclosed in this patent unsuitable   for heavy duty vehicle mounted operation the patent in fact teaches a means to accommodate a wear failure on site whereby a hole could be worn through the wall of the drum.<br>
Whilst the prior art teaches use of plastics drums for small cement mixing operations it does not teach the use of such materials as a substitute for steel in heavy duty operations. Conventional wisdom suggests that use and manufacture of plastics concrete mixing drums for heavy duty<br>
operations such as vehicle mounted drum mixing  is not advisable in view of the significant<br>
static and dynamic loadings to which the drum will be subject in normal operations.<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to provide an alternative vehicle mounted rotating cement or<br>
concrete mixing drum fabricated from plastics materials which overcomes the aforesaid<br>
disadvantages of the prior art and which not only improves the concrete mixing characteristics<br>
but prolongs the life of the drum in comparison to its steel equivalent and allows an increase in<br>
concrete carrying capacity of the drum commensurate with the reduction in drum dead weight<br>
thereby resulting in an increase in pay load for potentially each vehicle journey and without<br>
breach of the boundary requirements of the vehicle.<br>

Figure 1 shows an elevation view of a known steel mixing drum 1 which is typically constructed from separate prefabricated sections 2, 3 and 4 which are welded together at seams 5, 6 and 7. At seams 5, 6 and 7 the welded joints which are subject to concentrated wear due to<br>
the change in surface direction at the join. The concentrated wear points in the prior art steel drums reduces the working life of the drums necessitating costly repair or replacement. Steel drums are fabricated from rolled flat sheets which form cones and a cylinder which are then joined together by welding. Archimedian spirals are then welded to the inner surface of the drum resulting in a high specific gravity vessel whose self weight reduces the amount of concrete which can be carried by the vehicle to which it is attached. As previously indicated, the steel drums suffer from a number of disadvantages including susceptibilny to abrasion at the junctions of the cylindrical and conical sections and the tendency for unwanted concrete build up at the sharp comers and crevices formed by the mixing blades. In addition, the smooth internal surface of the steel drum promotes sliding abrasion and inhibits mixing at the boundary layer due to the low coefficient of friction at the concrete/metal interface.<br>
Figure 2 shows an external profile of a fibre reinforced composite concrete mixing drum 8 according to one embodiment of the invention. The drum includes an internal archimedian spiral formed by helical Wades or vanes which mix concrete during rotation of the drum in one direction and discharge concrete when the drum is rotated in an opposite directioa The drum is generally pear shaped and includes an opening 9 at one end for entry and discharge of concrete. The arrangement of figure 2 is arrived at by application of the method aspect of the invention which will be described in detail below. Drum 8 is constructed from a fibre reinforced plastic structural shell with an elastomeric interior having a surface property which imparts abrasion resistance to the concrete but increases the mixing at the boundary layer of the concrete and drum wall by forced rotation of aggregate. A preferred method of construction of the drum will now be described in detail. Whilst the embodiment described employs three mould parts it will be appreciated that the drum may be constructed from a lesser or greater number of parts. It has<br>
been found however, that a three part construction is preferable in view of the shape of the finished drum. According to the preferred embodiment, drum 8 is constructed from three mould parts 10, 11 and 12 according to the following methodology. Figure 3 shows typical profiles of mold parts 13, 14 and 15 wherein part 13 is constructed to engage a drive system mounted on a vehicle for rotating said drum, part 14 is an intermediate section which engages parts 13 and 15. Part 15 includes a discharge opening through which mixed concrete is discharged.     The first step in the construction of the mixing drum is the preparation of the mold from which the drum will be produced. The mold is preferably constructed in three parts as this enables ease of extraction form mold formers and also allows for the formation of mixing drums of different sizes according to requirements.   For instance the length of the drums can be increased by changing the size of intermediate section 14. Mold sections 13, 14 and 15 are each formed in separate molds from expanded polystyrene beads. Steam heat is applied through slots in each mold thereby fusing the beads against the mold surface. The polystyrene surface finish of the mold may be improved by the application of a fast drying liquid.  The external profile of the mould parts when joined provide the mold for the inner surface of the drum. The mold profile includes helical grooves which are the inverse of helical mixing blades which extend from an inner surface of the finished drum.<br>
Figure 4 shows an assembled mold mounted on a cantilevered mandrel 17. The mold sections include mating dowels which align corresponding parts of the mold profiles and are clamped together with an adhesive. Figures 5a -d show the first stages of preparation of the drum. At the commencement of this stage the mold is mounted on mandrel 17 which is capable of axial rotation. The operation of the mold is computer controlled and employs a robot which rotates the mandrel The mold surface is prepared with a release agent which will enable release of the<br>
mold from the drum on completion of the method steps.    A spray head 18 delivers a polyurethane elastomer to the surface of the mold which forms an inner layer of the drum. The spray is applied normal to the surface of the drum which will at this stage be rotating according to parameters fed into the computer. As the mold rotates on the mandrel the spray head moves to follow the mold surface and in particular the path of the grooves. A computer program controls the delivery of the polymer to the mold surface. The application of the polyurethane elastomer to the surface of the mold takes place in two stages. First, the spray is applied to the grooves of the mold which will form the helical blades of the drum. Spray head 18 follows the contour of the helix about the mold and deposits a uniform coating onto the sides of the blades with an additional thickness deep in the groove which will form the helical spiral blade tip.  The additional material provides abrasion resistance during operation. In the second part of the spray operation, spray head 18 is changed to spray the polyurethane elastomer normal to the surface of the mold according to the required thickness. Additional polyurethane may be sprayed where additional thickness is required in areas of high wear. If required, multiple coats may be deposited in one or both stages. According to one embodiment one or more of any additional layers may be differentially coloured with to provide wear indicators. A white <br>
igment in the surface layer may be provided for cleaning and inspection after use.    The polyurethane is allowed to gel following which a chemical layer is sprayed onto the polyurethane surface to ensure bonding with the next fibre reinforced composite layer. Prior to application of the fibre reinforced layer, a rope formed of multiple glass fibre strands is delivered from a dispensing creel into the grooves of the spiral helix. This part of the operation is represented by figure 5d. The rope is drawn through a bath of resin and is lead through a guide eye to fall into the blade groove. Tensiomng of the rope pulls it into the groove.   When the repor<br>
hardens it becomes a high strength reinforcing bar along the full length of the helical spiral. The polyurethane which is sprayed onto the mold by this stage generally conforms to shape of the mold except for bridging that is required between the groove walls.   In the example of Figure 6, there is shown an enlarged profile section of a typical mixing blade . Each blade comprises an elastomeric layer 20 which forms the inner surface of the drum. A coupling layer 21 is applied over the elastomeric layer following which a structural layer 22 is applied inside the concave recess 23. This process is completed for each section of spiral at a join whereupon, a further coupling layer 25 is applied to the remainder of the outer surface of the drum over which is applied a structural layer 26 which is preferably a fibre reinforced composite to form a structural shell. Included deep inside recess 23 is a continuous filament and resin rope 35.<br>
A rigid shell is required to bridge across the helical groove and this is provided by sprayed composite resin and chopped glass strands completing the structural layer 26. The sprayed resin is hand rolled followed by clamping then inflation of the mold before the polyurethane has gelled. Figures 7a-c show an end elevation view of the mold clamping and inflation steps. Figure 7a shows the clamping assembly 30 in the open configuration. Mold and partially completed plastics drum is represented by broken line 31. Before the composite of resin and chopped glass strands has gelled the mold is located on clamp assembly 30 whereupon arms 32 and 33 are closed over the composite . As shown in figure 5c. After clamping, the mold is inflated to ensure complete contact with the fibre reinforced composite layer. The mold and drum 31 are stored for four hours until the resin is sufficiently cured for the next stage. Figure 8 shows the mold and drum 31 stored for demolding. Figure 9 shows drum 31 inside grit chamber 32 in which a grit jet is traversed over the shell surface to prepare a surface which is chemically<br>
receptive to the bonding of the next stage.    The next step involves filament winding of a fibre reinforced structural layer. A winding arrangement as shown in figure 10 is arranged to wind resin wetted fibre rovings around a rotating former. The tensile strength of the windings which may be in the order of 600 MPa. Figure 10 shows drum 31 mounted for rotation on a computer controlled winding machine to enable winding of glass rovings  34.   To obtain the optimum physical properties of the filament wound structure the fibres are aligned to the loads imposed in use of the finished drum. Typical loadings on the drum are axial bending under weight of wet concrete, an applied dynamic load at the drive end of the drum, driving torque and support loads at the discharge trunion rolls. The winding pattern of the filaments aligns the fibres at 10 degrees at mid span to withstand bending stresses, increasing in angle and in wall thickness towards the discharge end to accommodate applied roller loads.<br>
According to one embodiment the winding machine has three motor drives   which rotate mandrel 17, move carriage parallel to the mandrel axis and a third motion at right angle to this. The rovings which line the drum are drawn through the resin bath and applied to the surface of the drum as a wide ribbon comprising thousand of tensioned fibres. The composite is applied by winding filament about the drum over the coupling layer 25 to form a fibreglass matrix with high strength properties sufficient to withstand normal operating loads applied during mixing and transporting concrete.   The windings overlap until   the required   thickness is reached. The surface of the drum is covered with wet resin and small irregularities which need to be addressed to provide the external finish.    As a result of this construction, the spiral mixing blades inside the drum are hollow with high bending and shear resistance during mixing operations. The inner elastomeric surface is highly resistant to abrasion by concrete yet it is softer and lighter than the steel     equivalent.  The higher resistance to abrasion is facilitated by the natural elastic<br>
deformation of the elastomer which absorbs the kinetic energy of the concrete particles without gouging of the surface material. In addition, due to the property of the inner surface which will preferably be polyurethane, the concrete will be mixed rather than slide at the boundary layer ensuring efficient mixing of the concrete throughout the mix and reduction of abrasion due to the smooth curves throughout the interior of the drum. In a further step, the structural layer is finished with a smooth pigmented resin which is applied utilising a clamp similar to that used for completion of the resin layer Figures 1 la and b show a two step process for application of a gel coat. Shell 40 is larger than shell 30 to accommodate the additional layer of the windings. As shown in figure 12 drum 31 is adapted with a stiffening ring 43 which distributes loads from trunion rollers incorporated on the vehicle on which the drum is to be mounted. This stage allows application of a corporate livery or alternative indicia into the structure of the finished drum. To achieve this shell parts 41 and 42 are printed with a selected livery and sprayed with a background gel coat. After gelation a light layer of reinforced composite is applied and allowed to set. The shells re prepared in advance of the operation of application of the fibreglass windings while the resin is still liquid whereupon the shells are clamped around the windings thereby extruding out any excess resin. The shell mold assembly is mounted vertically and atwo part compound is injected into the track ring mold space. Figure 13 shows the orientation of the drum 31 during this step. Once the resin has gelled, the shell molds are removed and the discnage end overwind is trimmed and a polyurethane drip flange is bonded at the discharge end. The final step involves removal of the mold remaining inside the drum followed by closure of the mandrel hole and cosmetic finishing. The mandrel is removed and the hole fitted with a pipe connection. The drum is stood vertically and acetone which dissolves the polystyrene is pumped out of the intenor which is then cleaned and washed. The drum is then finished by removal of<br>
any resin flash. Figure 14 shows a cross section of an end region of a drum 50 including between spiral section 51 and wall 52 a baffle 53 imparting rigidity to the drum. The baffle plate is preferably glued into position. Figure 15 shows a cross section of a typical interface between a concrete mix 54 and a steel wall 55. Due to the inherent smoothness of the steel surface 56 the concrete tends to slide and abrade rather than mix. Figure 16 shows a cross section of a typical interface between a concrete mix 57 and an elastomeric boundary layer 58. As shown by arrows 59 the aggregate in the mix rotates due to the friction between concrete 57 and surface 58. The rotation avoids excessive abrasion of the surface 58 and enhances concrete mixing. Furthermore, as surface 58 is able to deflect, energy is dissipated by the inherent elasticity of the surface contributing to the reduction in wear. According to the preferred embodiment, the spiral blades inside the drum range varying between 0.5 and 2 metre pitch. At the drive end of the drum the spirals are approximately 2 metre pitch.  The blades are reinforced by chopped strand, woven cloth or filament winding. The moulds may allow for a variety of helix pitches of the blades. Preferably, the radius of the root of the blade is   greater than 10mm to avoid unwanted accumulation of set concrete.     Furthermore, the blades are strengthened by their molding integrally with the wall of the drum and have a stiffness factor which will sustain all applied normal operating loads. In an alternative embodiment, the internal blades may be detachably fixed to the wall of the drum.<br>
An alternative method for construction of a fibre reinforced drum is shown in Figures 17a-o. Figure 17a shows a profiles of half mold part 60 which is coupled with a corresponding half to form completed mold 61.    The first step in the construction of the mixing drum is the preparation of the mold from which the drum will be produced.       The size of the drum may be changed by changing the dimensions of the mold. Mold section are each formed from separate<br>
molds from expanded polystyrene beads. Steam heat is applied through slots in each mold thereby fusing the beads against the mold surface. The external profile of the mould parts when joined provide the mold for the inner surface of the drum. The mold profile includes helical grooves which are the inverse of helical mixing blades which extend from an inner surface of the finished drum.<br>
Figure 17b shows an assembled mold mounted on a cantilevered mandrel 62. The mold sections include mating dowels which align corresponding parts of the mold profiles and are clamped together with an adhesive. Figure 17c shows mold 61 at a stage during which the polystyrene surface finish of the mold may be improved by the application of a fast drying liquid. Figures 17d -g show the first stages of preparation of the plastics drum according to the embodiment to be described. The mold is mounted on mandrel 62 which is capable of axial rotation. The operation of the mold is computer controlled and employs a robot which rotates the mandrel. The mold surface is prepared with a release agent which will enable release of the mold from the drum on completion of the drum.   A spray head 63 delivers a polyurethane elastomer to the surface of the mold which forms an inner layer of the drum.<br>
The spray is applied normal to the surface of the drum which will at this stage be rotating according to parameters fed into the computer. As the mold rotates on the mandrel the spray head moves to follow the mold surface and in particular the path of the grooves. The application of the polyurethane elastomer to the surface of the mold takes place in two stages. First, the spray is applied to the grooves of the mold which will form the helical blades of the drum. Figures 18a-f shows the various stages of construction of a solid core blade arrangement according to an alternative embodiment. Spray head 63 follows the contour of the helical groove 64 about the mold and deposits a uniform coating of polyurethane 65 against wall 66 terminating<br>
in the region of groove bottom 67.    The layer applied includes a return portion 68 which provides a bed 69 into which is laid continuous glass fibre reinforced elastomer 70. Return portion 68 will form the helical blade tip and this will be strengthened by the glass fibre elastomer 70. Figure 18c shows an additional layer of polyurethane 71 sprayed over glass fibre elastomer 70 thereby completing the blade profile.   The additional material strengthens the blade. In a second part of the spray operation, spray head 63 is changed to spray the polyurethane elastomer normal to the surface of the moid according to the required thickness.   Additional polyurethane may be sprayed where additional thickness is required in areas of high wear. If required, multiple coats may be deposited in one or both stages. To ensure that the solid core blade profile is retained during the second spraying operation, the cavity formed by   helical groove 64 is covered by polyurethane mold insert 72 as shown in figure 18d. A   layer of polyurethane 73 is then sprayed over insert mold 72 and also over the outside of drum 61. This is followed by the application of a chopped glass layer 74. Figure 17e represents the stage of blade reinforcement and preparation and figure 17f represents the stage of application of the polyurethane coating over the outside of the drum following completion of the blade profile. According to one embodiment one or more of any additional layers may be differentially coloured with to provide wear indicators. A white pigment in the surface layer may be provided for cleaning and inspection after use.   The polyurethane is allowed to gel following which a chemical layer is sprayed onto the polyurethane surface as represented by figure 17g to ensure bonding with the next fibre reinforced composite layer. A   coupling layer is applied to the remainder of the outer surface of the drum over which is applied a structural layer  which is preferably a fibre reinforced composite to form a structural shell. A rigid shell is required and this is provided by sprayed composite resin and chopped glass strands completing the structural<br>
layer. The sprayed resin is hand rolled followed by clamping as shown in figures 17 i, j and k. Figures 17j and k show the clamping assembly 80   in the open and closed configurations respectively. Mold and partially completed plastics drum 68 is shown in figure 17j. Before the composite of resin and chopped glass strands has gelled the mold is located on clamp assembly 80 whereupon arms 82 and 83 are closed over the composite layer.  After clamping, the mold may be inflated to ensure complete contact with the fibre reinforced composite layer. The mold 61 and drum 81 are stored for four hours until the resin is sufficiently cured for the next stage. Casting of a track ring and application of a drip flange area as previously described. The inner mold is removed as previously described and this includes removal of mold insert 72. Figure 18f shows a typical solid core blade profile 84   as described above. The blade satisfies strength requirements and is reinforced by curves in the blade profile as the blade traverses the helix about the finished drum interior. Preferred material of construction for the solid core blade will be sprayed SP85 polyurethane elastomer ( 85 shore A). Preferred reinforcing of the solid blade is high tensile glass fibre CC60 elastomer .   Preferably, the tensile reinforcement is continuous along the length of the blades.<br>
Figures 19a-p show an alternative method of construction of a plastics drum including an injection molding step. A number of the steps according to this embodiment, are substantially the same as for the corresponding steps described with reference to figures 17a-o. The methods, however differ firstly in relation to the method of construction of the helical blade. Figures 19a-e show a mold 90 mounted on mandrel in the usual manner. Blade reinforcement operation represented by Figure 19 e is shown in more detail in Figures 20a-f. A spray head (not shown) follows the contour of the helical groove 99 about the mold 90 and deposits a uniform bed polyurethane 101 against contoured base 102 at the bottom of groove<br>
103. As illustrated in figure 20a, bed 101 is trowelled prior to setting with a profiled trowel head 103 and this forms a molded recess 104 into which is laid continuous glass fibre reinforced elastomer 105 as shown in figure 20b. Bed 101 will form the helical blade tip and this will be strengthened by the glass fibre elastomer 105 along the length of the helical blade. The reinforcing elastomer 105 is prior to installation placed in a resin matrix under tension. Figure 20c shows inserted in groove 100 a polyurethane insert 106 which leaves a space between the insert and wall 107. The resulting space defines the final profile shape of a solid core blade. As shown in figure 20d, spacer blocks 107 are applied to the surface 107 of mold 90 over which is placed an external mold 108 as shown in figure 20e. The spacer blocks are preferably made of polyurethane which is the same material to be injected onto the cavity  formed by the insert mold 106 and external mold 108.   This arrangement corresponds to the steps illustrated by figures 19f-h.   The mold 90 is preferably disposed vertically for injection molding of the inner layer of the drum. Figure 19g shows mold shell 108 in an open configuration and figure 19 h shows mold shell 108 closed for injection molding of polyurethane elastomer 109.   Injection of cold setting polyurethane resin into the mold cavity bonds to the extruded elastomer and the atrix of the tensile member and forms the rest of the blade and the elastomeric interior of the concrete mixer. Figure 19i shows partially completed drum 120 inside grit chamber 121 in which a grit jet is traversed over the shell surface to prepare a surface which is chemically receptive to the bonding of the next stage.    The next step involves filament winding of a fibre reinforced structural layer. A winding arrangement as shown in figure 19j is arranged to wind resin wetted fibre rovings 122 around a rotating former. While the resin is still wet, the gel coated external mold 123 is closed over the structural shell to form the external surface of the mixer. This mold includes a track ring for injection of material therein to form a track ring 124.<br>
Drip ring 126 may then be fitted. The mold 123 is removed to expose the drum and the internal mold 90 is then disolved or broken up for removal. The tensile strength of the windings may be in the order of 600 MPa. Figure 19j shows drum 120 mounted for rotation on a computer controlled winding machine to enable winding of glass rovings 122. To obtain the optimum physical properties of the filament wound structure the fibres are aligned to the loads imposed in use of the finished drum. Typical loadings on the drum are; axial bending under weight of wet concrete, an applied dynamic load at the drive end of the drum, driving torque and support loads at the discharge trunion rolls. The winding pattern of the filaments aligns the fibres at 10 degrees at mid span to withstand bending stresses, increasing in angle and in wall thickness towards the discharge end to accommodate applied roller loads.<br>
The rovings which line the drum are drawn through the resin bath and applied to the surface of the drum as a wide ribbon comprising thousand of tensioned fibres. The composite is applied by winding filament about the drum over the bonding layer to form a fibreglass matrix with high strength properties sufficient to withstand normal operating loads applied during mixing and transporting concrete. The windings overlap until the required thickness is reached. The surface of the drum is covered with wet resin and small irregularities which need to be addressed to provide the external finish. As a result of this construction, the spiral mixing blades inside the drum are solid with high bending and shear resistance during mixing operations. The inner elastomeric surface is highly resistant to abrasion by concrete yet it is softer and lighter than the steel equivalent. The higher resistance to abrasion is facilitated by the natural elastic deformation of the elastomer which absorbs the kinetic energy of the concrete particles without gouging of the surface material. In addition, due to the property of the inner surface which will preferably be polyurethane, the concrete will be mixed rather than slide at the boundary layer<br>
ensuring efficient mixing of the concrete throughout the mix and reduction of abrasion due to the smooth curves throughout the interior of the drum. In a further step, the structural layer is finished with a smooth pigmenled resin which is applied utilising a clamp similar to that used for completion of the resin layer. Figures 19k and 1 show a two step process for application of a gel coat. Shell 123 is larger than shell 108 to accommodate the additional layer of the windings. As shown in figures 19m and n drum 120 is adapted with a stiffening ring 124 which distributes loads from trunion rollers incorporated on the vehicle on which the drum is to be mounted. The stages illustrated in figures 19 k and 1 allows application of a corporate livery or alternative indicia into the structure of the finished drum as previously described. To achieve this, shell parts 123a and 123b are printed with a selected livery and sprayed with a background gel coat. After gelation a light layer of reinforced composite is applied and allowed to set. The shells are prepared in advance of the operation of application of the fibreglass windings while the resin is still liquid whereupon the shells are clamped around the windings thereby extruding out any excess resin.   The shell mold assembly is mounted vertically and a two part compound is injected into a track ring mold space. Figure 19m shows the orientation of the drum 120 during this step. Once the resin has gelled, the shell molds are removed and the discharge end overwind is trimmed and a polyurethane drip ring 125 is bonded at the discharge end. The final step involves removal of the mold remaining inside the drum followed by closure of the mandrel hole and cosmetic finishing. The mandrel is removed and the hole fitted with a pipe connection. The rum is stood vertically as illustrated in figure 19o and acetone which dissolves the polystyrene is pumped out of the interior which is then cleaned and washed. The drum is then finished by removal of any resin flash. Figure 20f shows a cross sectional view of a completed blade 110 with mold 90 and mold shell 108 removed. The free end of the blade is enlarged relative to the<br>
blade thickness to contain the reinforcing tensile member within the elastomer and to protect the tensile fibres from abrasion as concrete is mixed.<br>
As an alternative to the hollow blades previously described with reference to figures 5 and 6, solid core blades may be used. As the solid core blades which are in the form of a two start helix of variable pitch, application of tension to the high strength reinforcing member will tend to move the member towards the axis of the mixer. This movement is restrained by the radial tension in in the blade material. Concrete loads applied to the blades during mixing and discharge will induce tension in the tensile member in the blade interior so that the concrete loads are carried by tension alone on the components in the mixer. Because the blade material is a low modulus elastomenc material and the blade is restrained by the member along its interior edge and the attachment to the mixer shell along its outer edge the concrete loads will deflect the blade into a sail shaped surface cupped to contain the concrete. This effect is accentuated by curving the interior edge of the blade in the direction of motion of the concrete towards the closed end in the mixing zone and the open end in the concrete discharge zone. Preferably, the tensile member is formed of continuous fibres, such as glass, carbon and aramid reinforcing a reason matrix such as polyurethane, epoxy, polyester or vinylester. The fibres are placed under light tension during manufacturing process so they are uniformly loaded to give maximum strength. Reference in the specification to blades includes reference to a single helical blade along the length of a drum, a two start blade, a multiple start blade arrangement, vanes, paddles and any suitable member for internal mixing of concrete.<br>
The polyurethane elastomer is formed on the exterior of rigid molds. Because the drum is a flask shaped vessel with the outlet smaller than the maximum diameter according to one embodiment this molding method requires separate molds which can be withdrawn towards the<br>
maximum diameter. In this case the molding must be joined which increases manufacturing costs. In an alternative embodiment of the method of construction of the drum a disposable rigid mold of a plastic foam is formed in an external mold. The composite mixer is them formed around the exterior of this foam mold which is then broken up or dissolved to remove it from the drum as previously described.<br>
At the drive end of the drum there is provided a steel ring which is molded into the drum structure and proportioned to suit drive equipment. The arrangement is such that it will resist relative rotation between the ring and the fibre reinforced drum under applied torque. The drum also comprises a track ring, which transmits the vessel loading to the support rollers and is constructed from fibre reinforced plastic formed integral with the structural shell of the vessel. It is anticipated that the plastics drum will outlast its steel equivalent under the same working conditions by more than 10 years. The wall strength will be in the order of 600MPa at a thickness of approximately 8mm comprising approximately 2-8mm polyurethane and 2-8mm fibreglass winding. According to one embodiment, the elastomeric layers may be of contrasting colours to enable detection of wear spots.<br>
A further advantage in the use of plastics for the mixing drums lies in the thermal properties of the plastics material. Hot conditions are undesirable for concrete mixing as they accelerate hydration reducing concrete workability which is an essential property required immediately following a concrete pour. In very hot climates, the conventional steel vehicle mounted mixing drums conduct high heat loads which increase heat at the concrete boundary layer due to contact with the super heated drum wall causing unwanted accelerated hydration. This phenomenon is difficult to avoid with steel drums as the conductivity of steel leads to high conductive heat transfer from the outer skin of the drum to the inner wall which is normally in contact with the<br>
concrete. In some hot climates, ice is placed in the steel drums in an attempt to arrest temperature increase inside the drum.   As concrete hydration is an exothermic reaction, it is sensitive to external temperatures. Accordingly it is desirable that the concrete temperature remains acceptably low to ensure a satisfactory level of workability and to retard hydration. Steel drums heat up significantly and conduct heat through their thickness making the concrete vulnerable to the vagaries of temperature variation.   Overheating of the concrete mix is a problem to be avoided and has in accordance with one aspect provided a method of manufacture of a plastics drum to take the place of the conventional steel drums thereby reducing the unwanted effects of high thermal conductivity typical of the steel drums.   The plastics drum allows the concrete to remain workable inside the drum for longer periods compared to concrete in steel mixing drums under the same external temperature conditions and transporting concrete. The structural exterior shell is significantly strengthened by the process of filament winding which produces a structure with many   times the strength and stiffness of random fibre composites. At the drive end of the drum the steel ring which is moulded into the drum structure is proportioned to suit drive equipment. The arrangement is such that it will resist relative rotation between the ring and the fibre reinforced drum under applied torque.  The track ring, transmits the vessel loading to the support rollers and is constructed from fibre reinforced plastic formed integral with the structural shell of the vessel.<br>
