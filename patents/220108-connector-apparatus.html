				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a connector apparatus. More particularly, it relates to a connector apparatus for interconnecting at least two electronic equipments. Description of the Related Art<br>
The radio transmission technique for transmitting data signals exploiting infrared rays is extensively applied for remote control for video or audio equipment such as a television receiver or tape recorder. In keeping up with coming into widespread use of the information processing system, such as a personal computer, this sort of the radio signal transmission technique is also applied as a transmission technique for data signals, for interconnecting a main computer unit and its peripheral or terminal devices. The design statement for this sort of the signal transmission technique  is prescribed as Infra-red Data Association (IrDA) standard.<br>
The radio signal transmission system under the IrDA standard is characterized by low output, directivity with the center angle of 15°, short-range communication up to 1 m and one—for- one or one-for—N inter—equipment interconnection. Therefore, the radio signal transmission based on the IrDA<br>
standard has a number of meritorious effects, such that data transmission can be done easily by installing the equipments loaded with the corresponding functions in proximity to each other, that painstaking interconnection operations or mistaken interconnections may be eliminated, that spatial efficiency may be improved by eliminating numerous connection cables, and that power source processing can be simplified by electrically separating the equipments from one another.<br>
The equipment conforming to the IrDA standard, as described above, include an IR emitting devices and PIN photodiodes (light-receiving elements) as a light-emitting module and as a light receiving element, respectively, and a data transmission/reception unit in a casing of the equipment for facing the light-emitting and light-receiving elements. The transmission unit of the data transmission/reception device includes, along with the light emitting element for converting an electrical signal into a light signal and outputting the resulting light signal, a modulator for transforming data signals transmitted from a communication controller UART into electrical signals and a<br>
transmission/.reception circuit for driving the light emitting element.<br>
The receiving unit of the data transmission/reception device is made up of the light receiving element for transferring a light signal into an electrical signal and a<br>
reception circuit for amplifying and wave-shaping the photo-tectrical signal received by the light receiving element. In the IrDA standard, a state devoid of IR signal is defined as ael, while a state in which an IR pulse pf 1.6 s to 3/16 bit    time has been detected is defined as aeO. Therefore, the<br>
	-...     --•"'"<br>
  receiving unit includes an IR filter for reducing white noise, removing optical noise, such as IR light of a non-specified wavelength or extraneous light, and for correctly detecting the specified IR rays.<br>
Meanwhile, a computer system is made up of a main computer unit 1 and plural peripheral devices, such as a monitor 2, a keyboard 3, a printer 4 or an external memory 5, as shown in Fig.l, and data signals can be transmitted between these unit or devices. To this end, various system equipments are usually interconnected by a connector cable, such that a number of connection cables are required to deteriorate the spatial efficiency, while raising various inconveniences, such as mistaken interconnections.<br>
In such computer systems, transmission of data signals between the unit or devices making up the system can be performed without using connection cables by exploiting the radio signal transmission system for data signals employing infrared rays based on the  above-described IrDA standard, as shown in Fig.1.<br>
On the other hand, portable equipments, such as notebook type personal computers or portable information terminal quipments, also have come into widespread use. In these portable equipments, attempts are being made for introducing a radio signal transmission system for data signals by employing the above-mentioned IrDA standard enabling transmission of data signals between associated unit or devices without the necessity of providing dedicated connection cables.<br>
The radio signal transmission system for data signals, based on the IrDA standard, has such defects that the data signal transmission distance is as short as approximately 1 m, power consumption is large and the system is weak against optical noise. The  radio signal transmission system for data signals, based on the IrDA standard, has an additional defect that, since there is no means for confirming that data transmission is being performed correctly between the unit or devices, the user feels uneasy as to whether or not data communication is actually proceeding correctly.<br>
For example, in the  above-described computer system, it is extremely difficult to install the unit or devices making up the system so that the data transmission/reception devices will be located within the center angle of 15°. Therefore, in the computer system, plural data transmission/reception devices are provided in the main computer unit 1, as shown in Fig.l, so that the peripheral devices, namely the monitor 2, keyboard 3, printer 4 or the external memory 5 will be<br><br>
interconnected in a one-for-one relationship with the main Computer unit 1 as the center. The 'result is that the main computer unit 'l is complex and bulky in size, while being costly.<br>
Moreover, the  above-described computer system has a ^drawback that the unit or devices are placed on respective table in a disorderly state, such that, if documents or files are placed between the main computer unit 1 and the peripheral devices or if the user extends his or her hand or arm into the space between the unit and the peripheral devices., data signal transmission is interrupted transiently. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a connector apparatus which resolves the above-mentioned problems. ti<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a connector apparatus for interconnecting at least two electronic equipments each having an input/output unit<br>

Referring to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
In the following description, a connector apparatus for interconnecting electronic equipments, such as a personal computer and a printer as a peripheral device, is taken as an example.<br>
The connector apparatus embodying the present invention is connected to two electronic equipments 30, 30 constructed in accordance with design statements conforming to the IrDA standard for enabling exchange of data signals between these equipments 30, 30 in accordance with the IrDA standard. Figs.2 to 4 illustrate a first embodiment of the present invention in which a connector apparatus 10 is made up of a pair of optical fibers 11, 12, a pair of fitting members 13A, 13B in which are inserted and secured both ends 19, 20 of the optical fibers<br>
11, 12, and a pair of magnet members 14A, 14B. The fitting members 13A, 13B constitute fitting means fitted to a data transmission/reception unit 30A of each equipment 30.<br>
For the optical fibers 11, 12, multi-mode optical fibers 50 to 100 m in diameter, frequently used for transmission of data signals in general, are used. Each of the optical fibers 11, 12 is made up of a core and a cladding surrounding the outer periphery of the core, in a known manner. The light entering one ends 19A, 20A of the optical fibers 19, 20 are conducted in the optical fibers 19, 20 substantially without leakage to outside so as to be radiated at the opposite ends 19B, 20B. Moreover, the optical fibers 11, 12 are sufficiently flexible over their entire lengths. The optical fibers 11, 12 may have their outer peripheral surfaces covered with a protective coating.<br>
Each of the fitting members 13A, 13B is molded from an electrically insulating synthetic resin material substantially in the shape of a rectangular block, and has a major surface 15A and an opposite side major surface 15B though which are bored first optical fiber fitting holes 16A, 16B and second optical fiber fitting holes 17A, 17B spaced apart from the holes 16A, 16B in the longitudinal direction (in the up-and-down direction in Figs. 2 and 3).<br>
Each of these fitting members 13A, 13B has a longitudinal lateral side 18A formed as an arcuately-contoured peripheral<br><br>
surface and an opposite lateral side 18B formed as a planar peripheral surface, thus presenting a substantially horse-shoe shape non-symmetrical with respect to the longitudinal direction, as shown in Fig.2.  With the fitting member 13A, the first fitting hole 16A of the arcuately-contoured peripheral lateral surface 18A is used for transmission, while the second fitting hole 17A of the planar peripheral lateral surface 18B is used for reception, as shown in Fig.4. Similarly, with the fitting member 13B, the first fitting hole 16B of the arcuately—contoured peripheral lateral surface ISA is used for transmission, while the second fitting hole 17B of the planar peripheral lateral surface 18B is used for reception, as shown in Fig.4.<br>
Therefore, the lateral sides 18A, 18B of the fitting member 13A in the longitudinal direction constitute portions setting the relative position of the optical fibers 11, 12 with respect to a light emitting element 35 and a light receiving element 36 of an electronic equipment 30, as will be explained subsequently.  Meanwhile, the outer peripheral edges of the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B are chamfered so as to operate for guiding the fitting members when the fitting members are fitted into the data transmission/reception unit 30A of the electronic equipment 30, as will be explained subsequently.<br>
With the  above—described fitting members 13A, 13B, both<br>
ends 19, 20 of the optical fibers 11, 12 are introduced from the major surfaces 15B into the first fitting holes 16A, 16B and the second fitting holes 17A, 17B to the side of the opposite major surfaces 15A so as to be secured in position. In this case, the ends 19A, 19B, 20A and 20B of the optical fibers 11, 12 are exposed to outside at the major surfaces 15A.<br>
The end 19A of the optical fiber 11 is inserted and secured in the first fitting hole 16A of the arcuately-contoured lateral surfaces 18A of the fitting member 13A, while the end 20A of the opposite side optical fiber 12 is inserted and secured in the second fitting hole 17A of the planar lateral surfaces 18B thereof, as shown in Figs.3 and 4.<br>
The optical fibers 11, 12 are twisted partway so as to be guided from the fitting member 13A towards the opposite side fitting member 13B so that the ends 19A, 19B, 20A and 20B thereof are inserted and held in the first fitting holes 16A, 16B and in the second fitting holes 17A, 17B, respectively, as shown in Figs.3 and 4. The end 20B of the optical fiber 12 is inserted and held in the first fitting hole 16A of the arcuately-contoured lateral side 18A of the fitting member 13B, as shown in Figs.3 and 4. The end 19B of the optical fiber 11 is inserted and held in the first fitting hole 17B of the planar lateral side 18B of the fitting member 13B, as shown in Figs.3 and 4.<br>
The ends 19A, 19B, 20A and 20B of the optical fibers 11, 12 are held and secured by the fitting members 13A, 13B so that the arcuately-contoured lateral sides 18A and the planar lateral side 18B serve as the transmission side end and as the reception side end, respectively. Stated differently, when the fitting members 13A, 13B are fitted to the data transmission/reception unit 30A of the electronic equipment 30, as later explained,  the arcuately-contoured lateral sides 18A and the planar lateral side 18B of the fitting members 13A, 13B constitute position setting portions for setting the relative positions of the optical fibers 11, 12. These position setting portions inhibit rotation of the fitting members 13A, 13B when the fitting members 13A, 13B are fitted to the data transmission/reception unit 30A, as indicated by arrow A in Figs.2 and 4. In addition, the position setting portions set the orientation of the fitting members 13A, 13B in the up-and-down direction. The indication aetransmission and Eereception. is inscribed on the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B in association with the first fitting holes 16A, 16B and the second fitting holes 17A, 17B, respectively, as shown in Fig.4.<br>
The magnet members 14A, 14B are larger in outer size and thinner in thickness than the fitting members 13A, 13B, respectively, and are unified to the fitting members 13A, 13B by outsert molding. Therefore, the magnet members 14A, 14B<br>
constitute flanges extended on the entire outer rim portions thereof beyond the outer periphery of the fitting portions 13A, 13B, respectively.  These magnet members 14A, 14B are magnetized in the direction of thickness thereof so that the magnetic polarities of the magnet member 14A associated with the fitting member 13A are reversed from those of the magnet member 14B associated with the fitting member 13B.<br>
Referring to Figs.3 and 4, the magnet member 14A associated with the magnet member 13A has its major surface 21A magnetized to an N polarity, while having its opposite side major surface 21B magnetized to an S polarity. On the other hand, the magnet member 14B associated with the magnet member 13B has its major surface 21A magnetized to an S polarity, while having its opposite side major surface 21B magnetized to an N polarity.<br>
Of course, the magnet members 14A, 14B may be molded in a frame shape as distinct members from the fitting members 13A, 13B and secured to the outer periphery of the fitting members 13A, 13B. In this case, the magnet members 14A, 14B are molded to the same shape and in a 180° rotated position to the fitting members 13A, 13B.  The magnet members 14A, 14B may be formed as plates each having a pair of through-holes traversed by the optical fibers 11, 12 and secured to the major surfaces 15B of the fitting members 13A, 13B.<br>
Since the magnet members 14A, 14B are magnetized so that<br>
the mutually facing major surfaces 22A, 22B and the mutually Opposite major surfaces 21A, 21B are of opposite polarities, the magnet members can be magnetically assembled and secured together by abutting the major surfaces 21A, 21B or the  major surfaces 22A, 22B together when the connector apparatus 10 is not in use.  The connector apparatus 10 can be assembled together compactly without the necessity of using a fastener or the like so that there is no risk of an unneeded force being applied to the connector apparatus thus possibly destructing the optical fibers 11, 12.<br>
The equipment 30 making up the computer system, such as a main computer unit 1 or the peripheral devices 2 to 5, has mounted on a portion of a casing 31 thereof the data transmission/reception unit 30A on which is loaded the  above-described connector apparatus 10, as shown in Fig.2.  This data transmission/reception unit 30A is made up of a casing 31, having a fitting hole 32, a circuit board 34 mounted within the casing 31, a data transmission board 35 mounted on the circuit board 34, a light emitting element 36 and a light receiving element 37 loaded on the data transmission board 35, and an infrared filter 38.<br>
The casing 31 constituting the data<br>
transmission/reception unit 30A of the  equipment 30 is formed of a magnetic material, such as by a metallic plate.  A magnetic material is classified into a ferromagnetic material<br>
which is magnetized by an external magnetic field with less ease but which, once magnetized, continues to be magnetized even on removal of the external magnetic field, and a soft magnetic material which is magnetized with ease by the external magnetic field  and which is readily demagnetized on removal of the external magnetic field. The casing 31 is formed of soft magnetic material having high magnetic permeability and low coercivity, such as soft iron or permalloy.   For meeting the demand for lightness in weight and improved productivity, the entire casing 31 may be formed of a non-magnetic synthetic resin material and at least the data transmission/reception unit 30A may be insert-molded or otherwise affixed to the casing 31.<br>
The fitting hole 32 is formed in the casing 31 so as to be substantially coextensive as the outer shape of the fitting member 13 of the connector apparatus 10. The fitting hole 32 is generally elongated and horse-shoe shaped in the longitudinal direction  and has an inner lateral side 33A in the longitudinal direction thereof formed as an arcuately-contoured surface and an opposite side inner lateral surface 33B in the same longitudinal direction formed as a planar surface, as shown in Fig.2.  Thus the fitting hole 32 permits the connector apparatus 10 to be connected to the equipment 30 only when one of the fitting members 13A, 13B is inserted therein in the correct position.<br>
The fitting hole 32 may be constituted as a bottomed<br>
racess for holding the data transmission board 35 on the recessed bottom. Alternatively, the fitting hole 32 may be designed to hold the light emitting element 36 and the light receiving element 37 on its bottom.<br>
The casing 31 has a reinforcement rib 39 formed on the entire rim portion of the inner surface extending along the opening edge of the fitting hole 32, as shown in Fig.2.  This reinforcement rib 39 operates for reinforcing the opening of the fitting hole 32 and for permitting the fitting members 13A, 13B to be fitted in the fitting hole 32 in stable state. The reinforcement rib 39 may be formed by plural ribs partially protuberantly formed along the opening edge of the fitting hole 32.<br>
The circuit board 34 is constituted by a circuit board having loaded thereon a control circuit or a transmission circuit of the equipment 30. The circuit transmission board 35 is arranged at an end of the circuit board 34 proximate to the inner surface of the casing 31. The data transmission board 35 is sized to close the fitting hole 32 and set upright on the circuit board 34 for facing the fitting hole 32. The data transmission board 35 has mounted thereon the light emitting element 36 and the light receiving element 37 facing outside via the fitting hole 32.<br>
On the data transmission board 35 are mounted a<br><br>
modulation circuit for converting data signals sent from the transmission controller UART of the equipment 30, not shown, into electrical signals, and a transmission circuit designed for driving the light emitting element 36. The modulation circuit and the transmission circuit are connected to the light emitting element 36. On the data transmission board 35 is also mounted a reception circuit, not shown, connected to the light receiving element 37 for amplifying and wave-shaping photo-electric data signals received by the light receiving element 37.  The above-mentioned circuits may also be mounted on the circuit board 34. The above-mentioned circuits may also be directly mounted on the circuit board 34 via terminals, not shown, with the light emitting element 36 and the light receiving element 37 facing the fitting hole 32.<br>
The IR filter 38 is arranged on the inner surface of the casing 31 for closing the fitting hole 32. The IR filter 38 is mounted with respect to the light receiving element 37 for reducing the white noise or cutting optical noise, such as IR light of a non-specified wavelength or extraneous light, and for correctly detecting the specified IR rays. If the casing 31 is formed by, for example, a metallic plate, the IR filter 38 may be secured to the inner surface of the metal plate or assembled thereto via a magnet holder. If the casing 31 is molded from a synthetic resin, the IR filter 38 is assembled to a metallic plate having a fitting hole 32 and which is<br>
unified to the casing 31.<br>
Among the plural equipments 30, data signals are exchanged based on the IrDA protocol via the connector apparatus 10 loaded on the data transmission/reception units 30A. The connector apparatus 10 is connected to the equipments 30 by having the fitting member 13 fitted in the fitting hole 32 formed in  the data transmission/reception unit 30A. In this case, the  connector apparatus 10 can be inserted into the  data transmission/reception unit 30A only when the fitting member 13 fits into the fitting hole 32. The connector apparatus 10 is loaded on the equipments 30 with the fitting member 13A fitting in the fitting hole 32 under the magnetic force of the magnet member 14A acting on the casing 31, as shown for example in Fig.2.  When the connector apparatus 10 is mounted in this manner on the equipment 30, the fitting member ISA faces the data transmission board 34 via the IR filter 38.<br>
With the connector apparatus 10, the fitting member 13A is connected to the data transmission/reception unit 30A of the main computer unit 1 shown in Fig.l, while its other fitting member 13B is connected to the data<br>
transmission/reception unit 30A of the printer 4. The one end 19A of the first optical fiber 11 of the fitting member 13A faces the light emitting element 36 of the main computer unit 1, while the opposite end 20A of the second optical fiber 12<br>
of the opposite side fitting member 13B faces the light<br><br>
receiving element 37.  The opposite side end 19B of the first optical fiber 11 of the opposite side fitting member 13B faces the light receiving element 37 of the printer 4, while the opposite side end 20B of the second optical fiber 12 faces the light emitting element 36.<br>

The infrared light derived from the data signals is conducted through the inside of the first optical fiber 11 efficiently without optical loss to the opposite end 19B so as to be radiated to outside. The infrared light is received by the light receiving element 37 on the printer 4.<br>
Also, with the connector apparatus 10, if data signal are transmitted from the printer 4 to the main computer unit 1, the light emitting element 36 of the printer 4 is turned on and off based on the data signals for conducting the outgoing infrared light via the end 20B into the inside of the first optical fiber 11. The infrared light derived from the data signals is conducted through the inside of the first optical fiber 11 efficiently without optical loss to the end 20A so as<br>
to be radiated to outside. The infrared light is received by the light receiving element 37 on the  main computer unit 1. The connector apparatus 10 permits the data signals to be transmitted in this manner between the  main computer unit 1 and the printer 4 by the fitting members 13A, 13B provided on both sides of the connector apparatus 10 being fitted to the data transmission/reception unit 30A of the printer 4.<br>
Referring to Figs.5 and 6, a connector apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention is explained. A connector apparatus 50 according to the second embodiment has a first lens member 51 for light collection and a second lens ember 52 for light collection mounted on the fitting member 13 in association with the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical fiber 12, respectively. In the following description of the connector apparatus 50, the parts or components which are the same or equivalent to those of the connector apparatus 10 of the previous embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals and the corresponding description is omitted for simplicity.<br>
The connector apparatus 50 has, on the major surface 15A of the fitting member 13 thereof, a first recess 53 and a second recess 54 in register with the first optical fiber fitting hole 16 and the second optical fiber fitting hole 17, respectively. In these first and second recesses 53, 54 are mounted the first lens member 51 and the second lens member<br>
52, respectively, so that the lens surfaces thereof are directed to outside, as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
The first lens member 51 and the second lens member 52 are each made up of a semispherical lens portion, a fitting portion formed upright on the back side of the lens portion and a fiber fitting hole bored for extending from an end face of the fitting portion towards the lens portion. The first lens member 51 and the second lens member 52 are loaded on the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members ISA, 13B by having the fitting portions thereof fitted in the first recess 53 and in the second recess 54, respectively.<br>
With the first lens member 51 and the second lens member 52, thus fitted on the fitting members 13A, 13B, the ends 19A, 19B of the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical fiber 12 are inserted into the associated fiber fitting holes. In this case, the ends 19A, 19B of the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical fiber 12 are positioned n register with the focal points of the lenses of the first lens member 51 and the second lens member 52.<br>
With the connector apparatus 50, constructed as described above, the fitting members 13A, 13B are fitted to the data transmission/reception units 30A of the printer 4 and the main computer unit 1 in order to permit data signal transmission between the main computer unit 1 and the printer 4. The connector apparatus 50 conducts the infrared light radiated in<br>
the main computer unit 1 or the printer 4 shown in Fig.l by the light emitting element 36 being turned on and off based on the data signals via the first lens member 51 or the second lens member 52 to the first optical fiber 11 or the second optical fiber 12, respectively.<br>
With the connector apparatus 50, since the ends 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B of the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical fiber 12 are positioned facing the focal points of the first lens member 51 or the second lens member 52, respectively, as described above, the infrared light derived from the data signals are conduced in the condensed state to the inside of the first optical fiber 11 or the second optical fiber 12. Thus the connector apparatus 50 transmits the infrared light derived from the data signals highly efficiently between the main computer unit 1 and the printer 4.<br>
Referring to Fig.7, a connector apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. In the present embodiment, the connector apparatus 60 is constructed so as to be compact in the transporting or storage state and so as to prevent destruction of the ends 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B of the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical fiber 12. In the following description of the connector apparatus 60, the parts or components which are the same as or equivalent to those of the connector apparatus 10 of the previous embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals<br>
and the corresponding description is omitted for simplicity. a  With the  connector apparatus 60 of the third embodiment, shown in Fig.7, one major surfaces 21A, 21B of the magnet members 14A, 14B constituting the suction surfaces for the data transmission/reception units 30A of the equipments 30 are protruded from the one major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B. Stated differently, the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B of the connector apparatus 60 constituting the suction surfaces for the data transmission/reception units 30A of the equipments 30 are recessed for avoiding direct exposure of the ends 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B of the first optical fiber 11 or the second optical fiber 12 to the suction end faces.  The major surfaces 21A, 21B constituting the suction surfaces of the magnet members 14A, 14B are magnetized to mutually opposite polarities, as described previously.<br>
Although not shown, the fitting holes 32 of the data transmission/reception units 30A of the equipments 30, to which is connected the connector apparatus 60, are designed as stepped holes. That is, the fitting holes are formed by annular recesses, on which the major surfaces 21A, 21B of the fitting members 13A, 13B are abutted, and annular protrusions disposed on an inner peripheral side of the annular recesses and onto which are abutted the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B. Of course, the annular protrusions<br>
are disposed in their entirety inwardly of the surfaces 31 of the equipments 30.<br>
When transported or stored, the  above-described connector apparatus 60 is assembled compactly, without the necessity of providing a fastener or the like, by abutting the major surfaces 21A, 21B of the magnet members 14A, 14B for magnetically coupling to each other. Since the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B of the connector apparatus 60 are designed as recesses, the major surfaces 21A, 21B of the magnet members 14A, 14B are intimately contacted with and coupled in this state to the casings 31. Therefore, the intimate contact between the magnet members 14A, 14B of the connector apparatus 60 may be maintained more reliably.<br>
Since the major surfaces 15A of the fitting members 13A, 13B of the connector apparatus 60 are designed as recesses, the ends 19A, 19B, 20A, 20B of the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical fiber 12 are not exposed directly to outside to prevent possible injury to these ends. Moreover, since the intimate contact is assured by the magnet members 14A, 14B in the state in which the fitting members 13A, 13B of the connector apparatus 60 are fitted in the fitting holes 32 of the data transmission/reception units 30A of the equipments 30, it becomes possible to reduce any adverse effects by extraneous light to improve transmission precision of data signals.<br>
Fig.8 shows a connector apparatus according to a fourth erbodiment of the present invention. In the connector apparatus 70 of the present fourth embodiment, the fitting members 13A, 13B are combined with the magnet members 14A, 14B in a state in which the relative positions of the optical fibers 11, 12 are positively demarcated from each other, while the fitting members 13A, 13B are positively fitted in the fitting holes 32 of the data transmission/reception units 30A of the equipments 30 for preventing incorrect mounting. In the following description of the connector apparatus 70, the parts or components which are the same as or equivalent to those of the connector apparatus 10 of the previous embodiment are again denoted by the same reference numerals and the corresponding description is omitted for simplicity.<br>
With the connector apparatus 70, the fitting members 13A, 13B are designed substantially in an elongated horse-shoe shape, and are connectable to the equipments 30 only when the arcuately-contoured lateral sides 18A and the planar lateral sides 18B thereof are matched to the arcuately-contoured inner peripheral sides 33A and the planar inner peripheral sides 33B of the fitting holes 32 of the equipments 30. The connector apparatus 70 is mounted on the data transmission/reception units 30A of the equipments 30 in a state in which the fitting members 13A, 13B and the magnet members 14A, 14B have prescribed the first optical fiber 11 and the second optical<br>
fiber 12 by the arcuately-contoured lateral sides 18A and the phanar lateral sides 18B thereof and by the polarities of the major surfaces 21A, 21B.<br>
With the present connector apparatus, since the magnet members 14A, 14B in the elongated rectangular shape are protruded around the rims of the fitting members 13A, 13B, the state of the fitting members cannot be checked in the course of the mounting operation. If the fitting operation for the connector apparatus is done while the operator is unawares of the unfittable state, the fitting members 13A, 13B, fitting holes 32 or the optical fibers 11, 12 tend to be destroyed.<br>
The connector apparatus 70 is formed integrally with discriminating portions 71A,  71B of mutually different shapes on at least one lateral sides of the magnet members 14A, 14B for preventing the incorrect mounting. With the connector apparatus 70, the discriminating portion 71A is formed by providing the magnet member 14A with an arcuately-contoured recess, while the discriminating portion 71B is formed by forming two arcuately-shaped recesses in the opposite side magnet member 14B. Although the discriminating portions 71 are not limited to the arcuately-shaped recesses, they preferably are distinguishable from appearance or on physical contact.<br>
With the discriminating portion 71A, it can be confirmed that the end 19A of the first optical fiber 11 is the transmitting side and the end 20A of the second optical fiber<br>
12 is the receiving side, while the fitting surface of the magnet member 14A is an N-pole. With the discriminating portion 71B, it can be confirmed that the end 19B of the first optical fiber 11 is the receiving side and the end 20B of the second optical fiber 12 is the transmitting side, while the fitting surface of the magnet member 14B is an S-pole.<br>
In the connector apparatus 80, shown in Fig.9, the magnet members 14A, 14B are formed with fitting surfaces, while portions of the major surfaces 21 are formed with polarity-indicating portions 81A, 81B for indicating magnetic polarities. For example, the polarity indicating portion 81A including pole indication aeNjE and a sole mark is provided on the major surface 21A of the magnet member 14A, while the polarity indicating portion 81B including pole indication aeS/E and two  marks is provided on the major surface 21B of the magnet member 14B.<br>
The polarity indicating portion 81A of the magnet member 14A indicates that the end 19A of the first optical fiber 11 is the transmitting side, the end 20A of the second optical fiber 12 is the receiving side and the fitting surface of the magnet member 14A is an N-pole. With the  polarity indicating portion 81A, it can be confirmed that the end 19B of the first optical fiber 11 is the receiving side, the end 20B of the second optical fiber 12 is the transmitting side and the fitting surface of the magnet member 14B is an S-pole.<br>
Although the connector apparatus of the  above-described embodiments of the connector apparatus is provided with a pair of optical fibers 11, 12, the present invention is not limited as to the particular number of the optical fibers. Although the respective connector apparatus are so designed that the fitting members 13A, 13B are designed in a horse-shoe shape, and the arcuately-contoured lateral sides 18A and the planar lateral sides 18B thereof are engaged with the arcuately-contoured inner peripheral sides 33A and the planar inner lateral sides 33B of the fitting holes 32 of the equipments 30, respectively, for mounting the connector apparatus in position, the present invention is not limited to this particular shape of the fitting members 13A, 13B and the fitting holes 32 of the equipments 30.  For example, the fitting members 13A, 13B and the fitting holes 32 can be formed in the vertically or horizontally non-symmetrical shape .<br>
Although the fitting portions of the  above-described embodiments of the connector apparatus are formed by the fitting members 13A, 13B and the magnet members 14A, 14B assembled to both ends of the optical fibers 11, 12, fitting members may also be formed integrally by combining the fitting members and the magnet members from a synthetic resin material admixed with magnetic powders. In this case, the unitary fitting members may be formed  on the outer peripheral<br>
portions thereof integrally with retention flanges slightly lagger in size than the outer size of the fitting holes 32 of the equipment 30.<br>
Although the connector apparatus described above are used in a one-for-one relationship with the main computer unit 1 and the printer 4, it is to be noted that the connector apparatus may also be mounted on plural data<br>
transmission/reception units 30A mounted on the main computer unit 1. These connector apparatus make it possible to transmit data signals, based on the IrDA standard, among plural peripheral devices, such as the monitor 2, keyboard 3 or the external storage device 5.<br>
It is to be noted that, if the connecting side apparatus and the connected side apparatus are installed with the data transmission/reception units 30A facing each other in accordance with the IrDA standards, transmission of data signals can be done between the connecting and connected apparatus without using the  above-described connector apparatus. It is therefore unnecessary in the  above—described computer system to provide the  data transmission/reception units 30A in all of the main computer unit 1 and the peripheral devices 2 to 5 for connectabi1ity of the connector apparatus. The apparatus 30 may also be a notebook—type personal computer, any one of a variety of portable information terminal equipments, or a electronic notebook.<br>
The apparatus may also be a general telephone in which the data communication function for communication of data signals with the host computer is loaded and which is connected to the  above-described portable equipment for enabling data communication. Since the data<br>
transmission/reception units 30A for the general telephone is configured simply as a recess in appearance, immunity from mischief by an ill-intended person may be assured.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
