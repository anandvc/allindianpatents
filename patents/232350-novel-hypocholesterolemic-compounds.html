NOVEL HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIC COMPOUNDS;<br>
LIPIDEON	BIOTECHNOLOGY	AG,	A<br>
CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS HERMANN-HILTBRUNNER-WEG 25, 8713 UERIKON, SWITZERLAND.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY    DESCRIBES   THE    INVENTION AND   THE   MANNER   IN   WHICH   IT   IS   TO   BE PERFORMED. 1<br><br>
4<br>
The present invention relates to novel hypocholesterolemic compounds useful in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and for the reduction of cholesterol levels as well as to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds alone or in combination with other active agents.<br>
Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease represents the major cause for death and cardiovascular morbidity in the western world. Risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history, male gender, cigarette smoke as well as serum cholesterol. Elevated concentrations of serum cholesterol have been demonstrated by a number of clinical studies to be a major contributing factor in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which is characterized by the formation of cholesterol-containing plaques in the aorta and lesser arteries.<br>
In mammals, 1/3 of the serum cholesterol is derived from exogenous dietary sources which enters the body through absorption in the intestine and 2/3 of the serum cholesterol are derived through endogenous de novo synthesis in the liver involving a complex set of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and regulatory mechanisms .<br>
Recently it has been shown that intestinal cholesterol absorption is an energy-independent, protein-mediated process (Hauser, H. et al, Biochemistry  1998, 37,   17843-17850; Schulthess, G. et al, Biochemistry 2000,   39,   12623-12631;   Werder, M. et al, Biochemistry 2001, 40,   11643-11650) rather than a passive diffusion process. The proteins facilitating intestinal cholesterol absorption were identified as two brush border membrane-resident scavenger receptors (Hauser, H. et al, Biochemistry 1998, 3 7,<br>
2<br><br>
^.7843-17850; Werder, M. et al, Biochemistry  2001, 40,   11643-11650) . Both in vitro  and in vivo  animal experiments confirmed the presence of these two scavenger receptors in the intestinal BBM and proved that they are responsible for the protein-mediated cholesterol uptake.<br>
Various 2-azetidinone compounds have been reported as being useful in lowering cholesterol and/or in inhibiting the formation of cholesterol-containing lesions in mammalian arterial walls: For example WO 93/02048, WO 94/17038, WO 95/08532, PCT/DS95/03196, U.S. Pat. No.5,633,246 describe 2-azetidinone compounds with different substituents at the 3-position, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,470 discloses 2-azetidinones having varying substituents at the 4 position.  Other azetidinone derivatives include for example elastase inhibitory substituted azetidinones disclosed in European Patent 199,630Bl and European Patent Application 337,549A1.  The most prominent representative of these 2-azetidinones, Ezetimibe (also known under trade names Zetia™<br>
and Ezetrol®) , has been in use as a cholesterol-lowering drug in monotherapy and in dual therapy combined with a statin.  It is the first representative of the new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by targeting the two scavenger receptors in the intestinal brush border membrane described above.<br>
However, it has been shown that the 2-azetidinones upon administration are readily absorbed and extensively metabolized into the pharmalogically active glucuronide of which over 95% remained in the intestinal wall upon direct administration as the glucuronide (van Heek, M. et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000, 129, 1748-1754). In addition side effects such as allergic reactions including rash and angiodema have been reported.<br>
Applicants have now discovered that the compounds of the present invention with the structural characteristics as depicted in<br>
3<br><br>
formula I and in particular formulas II and III are able to inhibit the protein-mediated process mentioned above by which cholesterol absorption is mediated, while overcoming the above described disadvantages of compounds known in the art.  Thus the compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and for the reduction of cholesterol levels.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention thus relates to novel hypocholesterolemic compounds of formula I, and 'in particular to compounds of formulas II and III having a four- or five-membered ring, respectively.<br>

Compounds of formula I and in particular compounds of formulas II and III may be prepared using methods of preparation kwnon in the art and are described in the following paragraphs:<br>
The 2-azetidinone portions of the compounds of formula II can be prepared by known methods, such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,365, 5,756,470, 5,767,115, 5,846,966, 6,207,822, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/279,288 filed Mar. 28, 2001, and PCT Patent Application WO 93/02048, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.  Compounds of formula IIa according to the invention may then be obtained by further linkage<br>
3<br><br>
to appropriate carbohydrate structures using literature procedures as illustrated by the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula lib may be obtained through conversion of ]3-lactams to thiolactarns, most commonly performed with Lawes-son's reagent (Verkoyen, C. and Rademacher, P. Chem.   Ber.   1985, 118,   653-660; Yde, B. et al. Tetrahedron 1984, 40,   2047-2052; Steliou, K.; Mrani, M. J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc.   1982, 104,   3104-3106; Clader, J. W. et al. J.  Med.   Chem.   1996, 39,   3684-3693).<br>
Compounds of formula lie may be obtained through conversion of 8-lactams to azetidines, which may be achieved by a number of wellknown methods in the art, such as (1) direct one-step reduction with reducing agents of the composition A1HXC13-X, such as chlorodihydroalane or alane (Jackson, M. B. et al. Aust.    J. Chem.   1983, 36,   779), or diborane (Jackson, M. B. et al.; Aust. J.    Chem.    1983, 36,    779-788), AlHCl2 and DIBAL-H (Yamashita, M. and Ojima, I. J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc.   1983, 105,   6339-6342; Ojima, I. et al. J". Org.   Chem.   1991, 56,   5263-5277); and (2) cyclodehydra-tion of 1,3-amino alcohols using various methods (Sohar, P. et al. Chem.   Soc.   Perkin  Trans.   2  2000, 287-293; Suga, H. et al. S. J". Am.    Chem.    Soc.    1994, 116,    11197-11198; Barluenga, J. et al. Tetrahedron  1996, 52,   3095-3106; Obika,  S.  et al. Tetrahedron Lett.   2003, 44,   5267-5270) as also outlined in the Examples.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula Ilia is effected as outlined in Scheme I through initial Sharpless asymmetric amino hy-droxylation reaction of the desired trans-l,2-disubstituted al-kenes (Demko, Z. P. et al. Org. Lett. 2000, 2, 2221-2223; O'Brien, P. Angrew. Chem. Int. Edit. Engl. 1999, 38, 326-329; Bodkin, J. A.; McLeod, M. D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 2002, 2733-2746), followed by chromatographic separation to obtain the desired regioisomeric product. Subsequent cleavage of the para-toluene sulfonamide group furnishes a primary amine which upon Buchwald-Hartwig arylation reaction (Hartwig, J. F. Ace. Chem. Res.   1998, 31,   852-860; Wolfe, J. P.; Wagaw, S.; Marcoux, J. F.;<br>
14<br><br>
Buchwald, S. L. Ace.    Chem.    Res.    1998, 31,    805-818) and subsequent exposure to triphosgene eventually leads" to the formation of the desired oxazolidinones of formula Ilia. Alternatively, they can be accessed as outlined in the Examples.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of formula Ille may be obtained e.g. as illustrated in Scheme II using known methods in the art (Mish, M. R. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 8379-8380; Guerra, F. M. et al. Org. Lett. 2000, 2, 4265-4267) . Alternatively, compounds in which sp2 is not a covalent bond can be synthesized as demonstrated in the Examples.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
	15<br><br><br>
 The preparation of pyrazolidinones of formula IIIc proceeds in an analogous strategy to that reported in the literature as illustrated in Scheme III (Lou, B. S. et al. J". Org.   Chem.   1995, 60,   5509-5514; Tomkinson, N. C. 0. Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds   (2nd Edition),   Asymmetric Catalysis,   Ed.   M.   Sainsbury 2001, 5,   199-258).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It has been found that the use of sulfonate linkages in e.g. the Rb or Sp3 group, i.e. linking carbohydrates to the phenylene <br>
ring is particularly beneficial in that the S=0 double bonds in the linkages may function as hydrogen bond acceptors compared to the more non-polar nature of a C-glycoside linkage. Such linkages have not yet been reported to link carbohydrates to other kinds of molecules. Furthermore the linkages are non-hydrolyzable, i.e. the carbohydrates are not hydrolyzed off.<br>
It has further been shown that the compounds of the invention display superior pharmacological activities and are able to overcome the drawbacks of known cholesterol-lowering agents using well-established methods in the art, e.g. evaluation of their IC50 value for cholesterol uptake in rabbit brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) as well as in Caco-2 cells (Hauser, H. et al. Biochemistry  1998, 37,   17843-17850; Schulthess, G. et al, Biochemistry 2000, 39,   12623-12631; Werder, M. et al, Biochemistry  2001, 40,   11643-11650; Boffelli, D. et al. FEBS Lett.   1997,<br><br>
411,   7-11) (see also Table I).<br>
Thus, the compounds of the invention, e.g. compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, exhibit pharmacological activity and are, therefore, useful as pharmaceuticals.  The compounds of the invention have been shown to effectively inhibit cholesterol absorption and are therefore useful in the treatment and/or prevention of atherosclerosis and of the reduction of cholesterol levels.<br>
Thus in yet a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of treatment and/or prevention of atherosclerosis, of the reduction of cholesterol levels and of treating or preventing a vascular condition, comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of formula I and in particular a compound of formulas II and III.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I can be used, for example, in the form of pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically effective amount of the active ingredient, if appropriate together with inorganic or organic, solid or liquid, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers suitable for enteral, e.g. oral, or parenteral administration. Accordingly, tablets or gelatin capsules are used that contain the active ingredient together with diluents, typically lactose, dextrose, saccharose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or lubricants, e.g. diatomaceous earth, talcum, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Tablets may also contain binders, typically magnesium aluminium silicate, starches, typically corn starch, wheat starch, rice starch or arrow root starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellu-lose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and, if desired, disintegrators, typically starches, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, e.g. sodium alginate, and/or effervescent mixtures, or absorbents, colourants, flavourings and<br><br>
^Sweeteners.<br>
Thus in another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, and in particular a compound of formulas II and III (and optionally other therapeutically effective agents), and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the treatment or prevention of artherio-sclerosis or for the reduction of cholesterol levels.<br>
The terms "effective amount" and "therapeutically effective amount" mean that amount of a compound of formula I and in particular compounds of formulas II and III (and optionally other therapeutically effective agents), that will elicit a biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or mammal, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the condition or disease being treated and the prevention, slowing or halting of progression of one or more conditions, for example atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia .<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions so obtained which, if desired, contain further pharmacologically active substances, are prepared in a manner known per se by conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, solution or lyophilising methods and contain from about 0.1% to 100%, preferably from about 1% to about 50%, lyophilisate to about 100%, of active ingredient.<br>
The compounds, compositions and treatments of the present invention can be administered by any suitable means which produce contact of these compounds with the site of action in the body, for example in the plasma, liver or small intestine of a mammal or human.  Thus the novel compounds of formula I may also be used in the form of compositions for parenteral, oral, transdermal administration or infusion solutions. Such solutions are preferably isotonic aqueous solutions or suspension which, e.g. in the case of lyophilised compositions that contain the active ingredient by itself or together with a carrier, such as manni-<br><br>
%ol, can be prepared before use. The pharmaceutical compositions can be sterilised and/or can contain excipients, typically preservatives, stabilisers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilisers, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the invention relates to a kit comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I and in particular a compound of formulas II and III in a p/harmaceutically acceptable carrier (and optionally an effective amount of another therapeutically effective agent), optionally in separate compartments.<br>

Materials and Methods: Reactions in anhydrous solvents were all performed using oven dried glassware under an atmosphere of argon. Reagent grade solvents were all purchased from chemical companies and used without prior purification. For chromatic purification, technical grade solvents were distillated prior to use. TLC was performed using Machery-Nagel Alugram Sil G/UV254 TLC plates and visualized with ultraviolet light at 254 nm and 12 g phosphor molybdic acid in 250 mL EtOH or 10% H2S04 in MeOH (v/v) . Chromatographic purification of products was accomplished using dry column vacuum chromatography on Merck Silica Gel 60 (15 - 40 um) according to literature procedures (Pedersen, D. S. and Rosenbohm, C. Synthesis 2001, 2431-2434); fractions containing product were pooled, the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was dried under high vacuum to give the product. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300MHz apparatus operating at 300 MHz and 75 MHz for XE  and 13C,<br>

Respectively, and chemical shifts (5) were referenced to the internal solvent signals. IR-Spectra were recorded in CHC13 on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum RX I FT-IR apparatus (thin films on NaCl plates) and are reported as absorption maxima in cm-1. Elemental analysis was performed by the Mikroelementaranalytisches Labora-torium at the ETH, Zurich. High resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was recorded in positive ion mode.<br>
