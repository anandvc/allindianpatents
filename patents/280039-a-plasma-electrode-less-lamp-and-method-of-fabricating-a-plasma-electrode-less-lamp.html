				<td>[0001] EXTERNAL RESONATOR/CAVITY ELECTRODE-LESS PLASMA LAMP<br>
AND METHOD OF EXCITING WITH RADIO-FREQUENCY ENERGY<br>
[0002] PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
[0003] The present invention is a non-provisional patent application, claiming the<br>
benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/723,144, filed on October<br>
04,2005, entitled, "External Resonator/Cavity Electrode-less Plasma Lamp and<br>
Method of Exciting with Radio-Frequency Energy."<br>
[0004] FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0005] The field of the present invention relates to devices and methods for generating<br>
light, more particularly to the field of plasma lamps, and still more particularly to<br>
plasma lamps driven by a radio-frequency source without the use of internal<br>
electrodes or surrounding dielectric bodies that enhance electromagnetic field<br>
coupling. Additionally, the field of the present invention relates to devices and<br>
methods where the lamp is not incorporated or a subset of a microwave resonator, a<br>
cavity or a waveguide, in particular the lamp and resonator or cavity structure are<br>
not geometrically contiguous.<br>
[0006] BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[0007] Plasma lamps provide extremely bright, broadband light, and are useful in<br>
applications such as projection systems, industrial processing, and general<br>
illumination. The typical plasma lamp manufactured today contains a mixture of gas<br>
and trace substances that are excited to form a plasma. Plasma interaction with the<br>
trace substance (Selenium or other) gives rise to light in the UV, visible, and near<br>
infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gas ionization resulting in<br>
plasma formation is accomplished by passing a high-current through closely-spaced<br>
electrodes contained within the vessel that is the gas fill reservoir. This<br>
arrangement, however, suffers from electrode deterioration due to sputtering, and<br>
therefore exhibits a limited lifetime.<br>
 <br>
[0008]<br>
[0009] Electrode-less plasma lamps driven by microwave sources have been disclosed<br>
in the prior art For example, both U.S. Patent Number 6.617.806B2 (Kirkpatrick<br>
et. al.) and US Patent Application Number US2001/0035720A1 (Guthrie et. al.)<br>
disclose similar basic configurations of a gas fill encased either in a bulb or a sealed<br>
recess within a dielectric body forming a waveguide, with microwave energy being<br>
provided by a source such as a magnetron and introduced into the waveguide and<br>
heating the plasma resistively. U.S. Patent Number 6,737,809B2 (Espiau et. al.)<br>
discloses a somewhat different arrangement whereby the plasma-enclosing bulb and<br>
the dielectric cavity form a part of a resonant microwave circuit with a microwave<br>
amplifier to provide the excitation.<br>
[00010] In each of the embodiments described above, a dielectric or metal/dielectric<br>
waveguiding body forming—whether deliberately or unwittingly—a resonant cavity<br>
surrounding the bulb containing the plasma is used. The driving microwave energy<br>
is introduced into the waveguide body using various probing means well-known to<br>
those skilled in the art of microwave engineering. The waveguide body surrounding<br>
the bulb brings with it a host of difficulties including wasted light, lamp size related<br>
to resonance or excitation frequency, manufacturing obstacles, and related costs.<br>
These obstacles are overcome by the approach presented herein.<br>
[00011] SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
[00012] This invention provides distinct advantages over electrode-less plasma lamps in<br>
the background art. Firstly, using an external resonator or cavity structure enables<br>
lamp operation at frequencies well below lGHz, lowering lamp cost and extending<br>
the range of lamp applications. Removal of the lamp from the dielectric waveguide<br>
body furthermore allows increased light harvesting, a serious drawback of the<br>
approaches previously discussed in the art. Finally, by removing the fundamental<br>
compromise between dimensions of the dielectric waveguide body and operating<br>
frequency, it is possible to substantially reduce lamp size to again extend the<br>
 <br>
applications range. Moreover, in addition to these three substantial advantages,<br>
these lamps still form bright, spectrally stable sources that exhibit energy efficiency<br>
and prolonged lifetimes. Rather than incorporating the gas fill (lamp) as a subset of<br>
the dielectric waveguiding body, the lamp is capacitively driven by an external<br>
resonant circuit that delivers the required field to the gas fill to sustain the plasma.<br>
[00013] Briefly, the lamp includes an amplified RF source operating in the frequency<br>
range between approximately 10MHz to 10GHz and emitting powers approximately<br>
as great as 10W. The lamp further includes an external resonator in the<br>
embodiment of a lumped circuit or dielectric cavity (an example of which might be<br>
a can resonator), which follows the RF source and is intended to provide the<br>
necessary potential drop to sustain the plasma. In its simplest implementation the<br>
resonant circuit comprises a parallel resistor, capacitor, inductor network, but is not<br>
limited to this configuration, and all other configurations are meant for inclusion by<br>
extension. The lamp further includes a closed vessel; the approximate diameter of<br>
the vessel might be 6 mm, but, as can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art, this size varies depending on the application. This closed vessel contains the<br>
gas fill. Portions of the outside walls of the vessel can be coated or in intimate<br>
mechanical contact with a metallic layer used to capacitively couple the RF energy<br>
to the plasma.<br>
[00014] An outline for producing light with the lamp includes, but is not limited to, the<br>
steps: a) RF/microwave energy is directed at a resonator, which is not<br>
geometrically contiguous with (detached from) the glass fill, the resonator may be<br>
in the form of a lumped circuit or distributed structure; b) field probes situated at<br>
positions where the field strength is maximum in the resonator direct the RF energy<br>
to the bulb; and c) the RF energy is capacitively coupled to the plasma through the<br>
metallic contacts on the gas fill vessel.<br>
 <br>
[00015] In one aspect, the lamp comprises an electromagnetic resonator and an<br>
electromagnetic radiation source conductively connected with the electromagnetic<br>
resonator. A first field probe and second field probe are conductively connected<br>
with the electromagnetic resonator. The lamp also includes a gas-fill vessel not<br>
contiguous with (detached from) the electromagnetic resonator with a closed,<br>
transparent body. The transparent body has an outer surface and an inner surface,<br>
the inner surface forming a cavity. The gas fill vessel is capacitively coupled with<br>
the first field probe and the second field probe. A fiuorophor is contained within the<br>
cavity of the gas-fill vessel. The fiuorophor fluoresces when electromagnetic<br>
radiation from the electromagnetic radiation source resonates inside the<br>
electromagnetic resonator, which capacitively couples the electromagnetic radiation<br>
to the fiuorophor.<br>
[00016] In another aspect, the lamp includes a first conductor and a second conductor<br>
that form a transmission line. Each conductor has a conductor probe end<br>
conductively connected with a field probe and a conductor vessel end connected<br>
with the gas fill vessel. Thus the transmission line formed by the two conductors<br>
capacitively couples electromagnetic radiation into the gas-fill vessel.<br>
[00017] In yet another aspect, the first conductor and the second conductor are<br>
constructed and arranged to impedance-match the electromagnetic resonator to the<br>
gas-fill vessel.<br>
[00018] In yet another aspect, the lamp includes an impedance-matching network. The<br>
impedance-matching network conductively connects the first field probe with the<br>
gas fill vessel and the second field probe with the gas-fill vessel. Thus the<br>
impedance-matching network enables a substantially maximal amount of energy to<br>
be transferred to the gas-fill vessel when energy is stored in the electromagnetic<br>
resonator.<br>
 <br>
[00019] In yet another aspect, the gas-fill vessel contains a gas. The electromagnetic<br>
resonator capacitively couples the electromagnetic radiation to the fluorophor by<br>
inducing the gas to become a plasma, which then transfers energy to the fluorophor,<br>
causing the fluorophor to fluoresce.<br>
[00020] In yet another aspect, the electromagnetic radiation source is a tunable<br>
oscillator, which is tuned to maximize light output<br>
[00021 ] In yet another aspect, the electromagnetic resonator is a lumped circuit<br>
comprising lumped circuit components.<br>
[00022] In yet another aspect, the electromagnetic resonator is a distributed structure.<br>
[00023] In yet another aspect, the electromagnetic resonator comprises both lumped<br>
circuit components and distributed structures.<br>
[00024] In yet another aspect, the electromagnetic resonator is tunable, whereby the<br>
electromagnetic resonator is tuned to maximize light output<br>
[00025] In yet another aspect, the gas-fill vessel includes a covered portion of its outer<br>
surface. A refractory veneer is connected with the covered portion of the outer<br>
surface of the gas-fill vessel, and a conductive veneer is connected with the<br>
refractory veneer so that the refractory veneer is between the covered portion and<br>
the conductive veneer. Either the first field probe or the second field probe is<br>
conductively connected with the conductive veneer. In this aspect, the refractory<br>
veneer acts as a diffusion barrier between the gas-fill vessel and the conductive<br>
veneer.<br>
[00026] In yet another aspect, the outer surface of the gas-fill vessel's transparent body<br>
includes a reflective portion and a non-reflective portion. Emitted light is made to<br>
 <br>
reflect from the reflective portion and escape through the non-reflective portion,<br>
forcing the light to escape into a substantially smaller solid angle.<br>
[00027] Finally, the present invention also comprises a method for forming and using the<br>
device. The method for forming the device comprises a plurality of acts of forming<br>
and attaching the various parts as described herein.<br>

[00052] (2)	Specific Aspects<br>
[00053] FIG. 1 illustrates a general/generic embodiment of the electrode-less lamp. An<br>
electromagnetic resonator 110 is driven by an electromagnetic radiation source 120,<br>
the radiation being in the microwave/RF portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
The RF/microwave energy stored in the electromagnetic resonator 110 gives rise to<br>
large electric fields, which are sampled by a field first field probe 140 and second<br>
field probe 150. As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, it does not<br>
matter which of the field probes is designated "first" or "second." Subsequently the<br>
electric field is distributed to the gas-fill vessel 130, which is not geometrically<br>
contiguous with (detached from) the electromagnetic resonator 110. The gas-fill<br>
vessel 130 includes a cavity 160 that contains a gas. The gas transitions into a<br>
plasma state under the presence of the RF energy; this gas is normally a noble gas<br>
but is not limited to one of the noble gases. Subsequent energy transfer between the<br>
plasma and the fluorophor (light emitter), also included in the gas-fill vessel 130,<br>
gives rise to intense visible, UV, or infrared radiation, usable in a multitude of<br>
lighting applications.<br>
[00054] In one embodiment, the RF/microwave electromagnetic radiation source 120<br>
comprises an energy source followed by several stages of amplification so that the<br>
overall power delivered to the electromagnetic resonator 110 is in the 10 to 200W<br>
range, although powers outside this range might be necessary depending on the<br>
application and would also be accessible with this invention. Although the<br>
electromagnetic radiation source 120 is shown as an agglomeration of solid state<br>
electronics, it may also comprise other sources known to one of ordinary skill in the<br>
art. In another embodiment, the RF/microwave electromagnetic radiation source<br>
120 comprises an RF/microwave oscillator. Feedback between the amplification<br>
 <br>
stages 210 and the electromagnetic resonator 110 is used to build up a sustained RF<br>
energy source that drives the electromagnetic resonator 110 and consequently the<br>
gas-fill vessel 130.<br>
[0005 5] The electromagnetic resonator 110 can be embodied as a distributed<br>
RF/microwave structure, such as a can resonator, or as a lumped circuit, such as a<br>
parallel RLC network. In the case of a distributed resonator, the RF/microwave<br>
electric field varies in amplitude as a function of position within it In this case, the<br>
first and second field probes 140 and 150 are positioned so as to sample the<br>
maximum field amplitude within the electromagnetic resonator. For a lumped<br>
parallel resonator the field is independent of position along it and first and second<br>
field probes 140 and 150 can be placed arbitrarily. The electromagnetic resonator<br>
110 has a distinctive frequency behavior enabling energy storage over a limited<br>
frequency range. In the case of a distributed structure this frequency range is<br>
determined by geometry and material parameters, whereas in the case of a lumped<br>
resonator, this same frequency of operation is determined by circuit topology and<br>
component values.<br>
[00056] As can be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, plasma lamp operation<br>
substantially near 100MHz enables RF energy distribution with minimal impact<br>
from parasitics, which are non-idealities in the components used to distribute<br>
energy. These parasitics are typically a function of frequency and increase in<br>
severity with increasing frequency. Additionally, by operating at a lower frequency,<br>
lamp cost can be reduced enabling penetration of this technology into the existing<br>
lamp socket markets. However, operation in this frequency range places a<br>
constraint on lamp geometry/material parameters in order to effectively couple RF<br>
energy into the plasma, thereby limiting the range of applications. As operational<br>
frequency is increased this constraint is relaxed enabling the use of smaller light<br>
bulbs, In particular as high-frequency, high-power amplifiers mature, dropping<br>
 <br>
their cost, operation substantially near l0GHz 'will facilitate effective light point<br>
sources, which are desirable in many high-end applications.<br>
[00057] FIG. 2A illustrates an embodiment of the plasma electrode-less lamp where the<br>
electromagnetic resonator 110 is a lumped resonator 200. In this case the lumped<br>
resonator 200 comprises a parallel RLC circuit that stores the energy delivered by<br>
the amplification stages 210 and consequently develops a large potential drop. This<br>
implementation is preferred in the lower operating frequency range of the lamp.<br>
RF/microwave energy is delivered to the gas-fill vessel 130, which gives off intense<br>
radiation. In this embodiment amplification stages 210 are driven by an<br>
RF/microwave source 120 at the resonance frequency of the electromagnetic<br>
lumped resonator 200. Lamp operation at frequencies substantially less than 100<br>
MHz enables RF distribution with minimal parasitic impact, which makes the use of<br>
simple cabling to deliver RF energy to the gas-fill vessel feasible.<br>
[00058] FIG. 2B illustrates an embodiment of the plasma electrode-less lamp with a<br>
tunable lumped resonator 240. As with FIG. 2A, the resonator is driven by an<br>
electromagnetic radiation source 120 and amplification stage 210 combination. An<br>
RF/microwave sensor 230 measures the amount of energy not delivered to the gas-<br>
fill vessel 130 and provides feedback to a tuning circuit 220. In turn, the tuning<br>
circuit adjusts the tunable lumped resonator's 240 resonance frequency to maximize<br>
the energy delivered to the gas-fill vessel 130. This enables a reduction in wasted<br>
RF energy and therefore provides enhanced lamp efficiency. Feedback approaches<br>
are not limited to lumped resonators and can be extended to distributed structures.<br>
[00059] FIG 3 illustrates an embodiment of the plasma electrode-less lamp incorporating<br>
a Dielectric Resonant Oscillator (DRO) 330. In this case RF/microwave energy is<br>
sustained through feedback-induced oscillation. The DRO 330 couples energy to<br>
and from the electromagnetic resonator 110 through coupling structures 350 and<br>
360. The sampled RF/microwave field is fed back to the amplification stages 210,<br>
 <br>
in so doing the sample signal passes through delay elements 340 and loss elements<br>
320. Provided the amplification stages can overcome the loop loss, oscillation will<br>
initiate at a frequency determined by the physical and geometrical properties of the<br>
resonator. First and second field probes 140 and 150 are positioned to sample the<br>
maximum electric field within the electromagnetic resonator 110; the sampled field<br>
is subsequently delivered to the gas-fill vessel 130. As can be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, by separating the dielectric resonator (electromagnetic<br>
resonator 110) from the bulb (gas-fill vessel 130), the lamp design becomes much<br>
• more flexible. As operating frequency is lowered, the size of the dielectric<br>
resonator needed increases, but by using much higher dielectric constant materials<br>
one can actually maintain or reduce the size of the dielectric resonator without<br>
concern about thermal mismatch between the dielectric resonator material and the<br>
bulb.<br>
[00060] FIG. 4A illustrates one possible embodiment of a gas-fill vessel 130. It<br>
comprises a transparent body 400a with an inner surface 400b and outer surface<br>
400c. The transparent body can be made of quartz or some other suitably<br>
transparent and refractory material. A refractory veneer 420 covers a portion of the<br>
gas-fill vessel 130. This refractory veneer 420 can be made of suitable dielectrics,<br>
non-limiting examples of which include alumina, barium titanium oxide, titanium<br>
oxide, and silicon nitride; the refractory veneer could also be made from a refractory<br>
metal, non-limiting examples of which include tungsten, tantalum and titanium. A<br>
conductive veneer 410 is affixed onto the dielectric veneer 420; the conductive<br>
veneer 410 serves as a metal electrode. Radiation escapes the gas-fill vessel<br>
through the transparent body 400a. RF energy is capacitively coupled to the gas<br>
within the gas-fill vessel 130 through the conductive veneers 410, which act as<br>
metallic electrodes.<br>
[00061 ] FIG. 4B shows a second embodiment of the gas-fill vessel 130, in which it is<br>
formed with a trapezoidal geometry. The gas and fluorophor (light emitter) are<br>
 <br>
enclosed by quartz side walls of the transparent body 400a. The ends of the<br>
trapezoidal cavity of the gas-fill vessel 130 are capped by a refractory veneer 420<br>
(dielectric diffusion barrier), on which has been deposited a conductive veneer 410<br>
(metallic electrode). The conductive veneer 410 and refractory veneer 420 form<br>
optical surfaces from which light reflects with minimal scattering and absorption.<br>
Additionally the gas-fill vessel 130 has a reflective portion 430, which can be made<br>
by depositing metal or dielectric layers on the quartz side walls of the transparent<br>
body 400a; the reflective portion enhances light harvesting as it exits through the<br>
transparent portion 440 of the gas-fill vessel 130.<br>
[00062] As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, although the above description<br>
utilized many specific measurements and parameters, the invention is not limited<br>
thereto and is to be afforded the widest scope possible. Additionally, although the<br>
device is described as being used as a lamp which produces visible light for<br>
illumination, it is not intended to be limited to this region of the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum and can be incorporated into a wide array of devices for a large variety of<br>
uses, including uses which require illumination in the ultra-violet and infrared<br>
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
