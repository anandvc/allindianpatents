				<td>This invention relates to novel cyclohexyl sulphones<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of compounds, their salts, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, processes for making them and their use in therapy of the human body. In particular, the invention relates to novel sulphones which modulate the processing of APP by -secretase, and hence are useful in the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Although primarily a disease of the elderly, affecting up to 10% of the population over the age of 65, AD also affects significant numbers of younger patients with a genetic predisposition. It is a neurodegenerative disorder, clinically characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive function, and pathologically characterized by the deposition of extracellular proteinaceous plaques in the cortical and associative brain regions of sufferers. These plaques mainly comprise fibrillar aggregates of -amyloid peptide (A ). The role of secretases, including the putative -secretase, in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to form A \ is well documented in the literature and is reviewed, for example, in WO 01/70677.<br>
There are relatively few reports in the literature of compounds with inhibitory activity towards -secretase, as measured in cell-based assays. These are reviewed in WO 01/70677. Many of the relevant compounds are peptides or peptide derivatives.<br>
The present invention provides a novel class of non-peptidic compounds which are useful in the treatment or prevention of AD by modulating the processing of APP by the putative    -secretase, thus arresting the production of Ai .<br>

For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, such as the conventional tableting ingredients known to those<br><br>
skilled in the art, e.g. as described in WO 01/70677, and formed into unit dosage forms. Typical unit dosage forms contain from 0.1 to 500 mg, for example 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg, of the active ingredient.

The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils, as described in WO 01/70677.<br>
The present invention also provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof for use in a method of treatment of the human body. Preferably the treatment is for a condition associated with the deposition of p-amyloid. Preferably the condition is a neurological disease having associated p-amyloid deposition such as Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Also disclosed is a method of treatment of a subject suffering from or prone to Alzheimer's disease which comprises administering to that subject an effective amount of a compound according to formula I or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
For treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, a suitable dosage level is about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, and especially about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day. In some cases, however, dosage outside these limits may be used.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which m is 0 and Z is C02R2a or CON(R2a)2 may be prepared by coupling of a carboxylic acid (1) with (respectively) R2aOH, or HN(R2a)2, <br><br>
where Ar1, Ar2, Rlc and R2a have the same meanings as before. Any of the standard<br>
coupling techniques may be used, including the use of coupling agents such as<br>
dimethylaminopyridine,	hydroxybenzotriazole,	dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,<br>
carbonyldiimidazole and the like. In one preferred method, the acid is converted to the corresponding acid chloride (e.g. by treatment with oxalyl chloride in DMF solution) and reacted directly with the desired nucleophile. In another preferred method, the acid is converted to an active ester derivative such as the pentafluorophenol ester (e.g. by coupling with the phenol in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodiimide), and this intermediate is reacted with the desired nucleophile.<br>
The acids (1) are available by hydrolysis of the esters (2), typically under alkaline conditions such as treatment with LiOH in ethanol solution:<br><br>
where R represents alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, and Ar , Ar and R c have the same meanings as before.<br>
The esters (2) are available by reduction of the alkylidene derivatives (3), optionally followed by alkylation with (Ci-4alkyl)-L where L is a leaving group (especially bromide or iodide) when RIC is other than H:<br><br>
where Arl, Ar2 and R2 have the same meanings as before. The reduction may be carried out using sodium borohydride and nickel(II) chloride in ethanol, while the optional alkylation may be effected by treating the ester (2, Rlc = H)) with strong base (e.g. sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide) in an aprotic solvent at low temperature, followed by treatment with (Cl-4alkyl)-L and warming to room temperature. If desired, the unsaturated esters (3) may be hydrolysed to the corresponding acids and converted to amides by reaction with HN(R2a)2 prior to reduction of the olefinic bond.The unsaturated esters (3) are available from condensation of a ketone (4) with Ph3P=CHC02R2:<br><br><br>
1	")	*?<br>
where Ar, Ar and R have the same meanings as before, while the ketones (4) are available by decarboxylation of the enols (5), which in turn are formed by reaction of a sulphone (6) with at least two equivalents of an acrylate (7):<br><br>
where Ar, Ar and R have the same meanings as before. The decarboxylation may be accomplished by heating at 150°C in DMSO in the presence of sodium chloride and water, while reaction of (6) with (7) may be carried out at ambient temperature in an inert solvent such as THF in the presence of strong base such as potassium t-butoxide.<br>
The sulphones (6) are prepared by oxidation of thioethers Ar2-CH2-SArl (8), which in turn are formed by reaction of thiols ArlSH (9) with benzyl derivatives Ar2CH2-L (10), where L is a leaving group such as chloride or bromide and Arl and Ar2 have the same meanings as before. The reaction between (9) and (10) takes place in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, while the oxidation of (8) to (6) is conveniently effected by m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, also in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane. Compounds of formula I in which m is 0 and Z is CN or OR2a may be obtained by reaction of a sulphonate ester (11) with (respectively) cyanide ion or R2aOH:<br><br>
where L1 represents a sulphonate leaving group (such as mesylate, tosylate or triflate) and Ar1, Ar, R,c and R2a have the same meanings as before. The displacement reaction may be carried out in DMF at elevated temperature, e.g. about 80°C.    When the<br><br>
nucleophile is R"aOH, it is advantageous to generate the corresponding anion by treatment with sodium hydride prior to reaction with (11).<br>
The sulphonates (11) are prepared by reaction of the alcohols (12) with the appropriate sulphonyl chloride (e.g. under anhydrous conditions at low temperature in the presence of a tertiary amine).<br><br>
The alcohols (12) are available from the hydroboration of alkenes (13):<br><br>
wherein Ar1, Ar2 and R,c have the same meanings as before. The process typically involves reaction with borane in THF at room temperature, followed by treatment with alkaline hydrogen peroxide and separation of the desired cis isomer by chromatography. Alkenes (13) are available from ketones (4) by condensation with Ph3P=CHRlc where R,c has the same meaning as before.<br>
An alternative route to the alcohols (12) in which Rlc is H involves reduction of a ketone (4) (e.g. using borohydride) to the corresponding secondary alcohol (14), converting said alcohol (14) to the corresponding mesylate (or equivalent leaving group), effecting nucleophilic displacement with cyanide ion, hydrolysing the resulting nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid, followed by reduction to the primary alcohol. The hydrolysis is typically carried out under acid conditions (e.g. in a mixture of acetic acid and cone. HC1 at 110°C) and the reduction is conveniently carried out by sequential treatment with isobutyl chloroformate and borohydride in THF.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which m is 1 and R,b is H or Ci^alkyl may be obtained via oxidation of an alcohol (12) to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone, and elaboration of the carbonyl group thereof in the manner described previously in connection with conversion of the ketones (4) into compounds of formula I in which m is 0. For example, oxidation of the alcohols (12) wherein Rlc is H provides the corresponding    cyclohexanecarboxaldehydes,    which    may    be    condensed    with<br><br>
Ph3P=zC02Et to provide ethyl esters of 2-cyclohexylpropenoic acids. These in turn may be hydrogenated to the corresponding ethyl 2-cycIohexylpropanoates, which optionally may be subjected to alkylation, and/or to hydrolysis to the corresponding acids, and/or converted to a variety of amide or alternative ester derivatives.<br>
Where they are not themselves commercially available, the starting materials and reagents employed in the above-described synthetic schemes may be obtained by the application of standard techniques of organic synthesis to commercially available materials.<br>
It will be appreciated that many of the above-described synthetic schemes may give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers. In particular, certain products may be formed as mixtures of cis and trans isomers in which a particular ring substituent is on the same or opposite side of the ring as the arylsulphonyl group. Such mixtures may be separated by conventional means such as fractional crystallisation and preparative chromatography.<br>
Certain compounds according to the invention may exist as optical isomers due to the presence of one or more chiral centres or because of the overall asymmetery of the molecule. Such compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The novel compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques such as preparative HPLC, or the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyI-l-tartaric acid, followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The novel compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.<br>
During any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br><br>
Suitable methods of assaying the level of activity of compounds of the present invention towards -secretase are disclosed in WO 01/70677 and in Biochemistry, 2000, 39(30), 8698-8704.<br>
The Examples of the present invention all had an ED50 of less than 10 M, preferably less than 1 M and most preferably less than lOOnM in at least one of the above-referenced assays.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention.<br>
