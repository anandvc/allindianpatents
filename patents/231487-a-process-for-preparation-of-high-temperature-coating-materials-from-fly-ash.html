				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of high temperature coating<br>
materials from fly ash. This invention will be useful for high temperature coating on mild<br>
steel and stainless steels components such as tube spacers and hangers, platen super<br>
heater in power generating system and like.<br>
Fly ash which is one of the by-product of pulverised coal fired thermal power plants in<br>
India, poses environmental problems and needs proper utilization .There are 82 such<br>
thermal power plants in India . Although 15-25% of the total fly ash produced in our<br>
country is effectively utilized yet huge amount of this industrial waste (around 200<br>
million tons annually) are unutilized. Fly ash is available at a very cheap rate around<br>
Rs.30-357. per tonne and an efficient fly ash utilization programme will prevent/minimize<br>
environmental pollution to a great extent.<br>
The high temperature coating materials involve use of phosphates, borates, silicates,<br>
silicates-chromate and oxides. Oxide coating such as aluminide or alumina coating on<br>
nickel/cobalt base super alloys work at high temperature &amp; under corrosive<br>
environments. However, high temperature coatings on alloys, especially iron-base alloys<br>
need attention as they find many applications in chemicals plants, petroleum refineries,<br>
thermal power units, coal gasification plants etc. Coatings for this purpose are generally<br>
prepared from oxides of aluminium, silicon, chromium, zirconium, titanium, or<br>
transitional metal carbides, silicides, borides, nitrides, silicates and borates. The major<br>
drawbacks of the above processes are either lengthy or uneconomic or resources are not<br>
cheap. Some of the demerits of these coating materials are: (i) although aluminide<br>
coatings are suitable under ordinary oxidising conditions on steels, under hot corrosive<br>
environment ,i.e., power generating units using low grade fossil fuel, these coating<br>
materials do not show satisfactory results because of formation of non-protective NaAlC<br>
and alkali tri-ironsulphate (A.U.Malik and Sharif Ahmed, Anti-Corrosion, September,<br>
1984, p4), (ii) silicon based coatings find limited applications due to impairment of the<br>
coatings by formation of low melting Fe-Si-O compounds and poor mechanical stability<br>
(P.Felin and E.Prdoes, Werkstoff Korros, 23, 627 (1972). Further, these coatings<br>
sometimes have excessive swelling effect, poor spreadability and compatibility. Coating<br>
based on aluminium phosphate have poor adherance to the substrate. Oxides such as<br>
A12O3 and ZrO2 have limited protection efficiency(45-75%) at 500°C-700°C. In other<br>
words, efficiency decreases at temperatures more than 600°C. Other oxides such as ZnO,<br>
Cobalt oxide and Kaoline do not provide sufficient protection. Moreover the above said<br>
coatings for high temperature applications are costly from economic as well as processing<br>
point of view.<br>
Reference may be made to an U.S. patent No. 012514, wherein a fire retardant coating<br>
composition has been made consisting of fly ash up to 50 percent using costly chemicals<br>
like vinyl acrylic type emulsion polymer, plasticiser, preservative, fungicide, fiber glass<br>
flakes, inorganic pigment, amorphous silica, colloidal silica and surfactant. The<br>
application has not mentioned about high temperature oxidation resistance properties of<br>
the coating as well as metal surface on which it will be applied. The above process is<br>
non-economic and time consuming. The present invention provides an easy and<br>
economic process for development of a high temperature coating materials from fly ash<br>
which can be suitably used on the mild steel as well as 304 grade stainless steel for<br>
protection from high temperature oxidation.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation<br>
of high temperature coating materials from fly ash which obviates the drawbacks as<br>
detailed above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to utilize the fly ash, an industrial<br>
waste, for preparation of high temperature coating material and thereby reducing the<br>
industrial pollution.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of high<br>
temperature coating materials from fly ash, the said process comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) mixing the fly ash powder with water and filtering to remove carbon<br>
particles,<br>
(ii) mixing the above said filtered material with dilute inorganic acid of strength<br>
ranging between 0.5 - 4.ON and stirring the mixture for a period of 30-40<br>
minutes and washing with water,<br>
(iii) filtering the above said mixture and adding a mixture of alkali oxide and<br>
alkali solution of alkali carbonate or alkali hydroxide to the resultant<br>
solution and stirring for a period of 20-30 minutes at a temperature of 80°-<br>
120°C followed by cooling at temperature of 20-30°C,<br>
(iv) mixing 0.1-5% rare earth salt solution to above said mixture under stirring<br>
for a period of 20-30 minutes,<br>
(v) mixing binder material to the above said resultant mixture to obtain the<br>
desired coating slurry.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the fly ash powder used have the following<br>
composition:<br>
SiO2 60-65 wt%<br>
A12O3 25-30 wt%<br>
Fe2O3 2-5 wt %<br>
TiO2 1-2 wt%<br>
CaO 1-4 wt%<br>

In an another embodiment the inorganic acid used is selected from the group consisting<br>
ofH2S04,HCland HNO3.<br>
In yet another embodiment the alkali oxide used is selected from the group consisting of<br>
sodium oxide, calcium oxide and potassium oxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment the alkali solution used is alkali carbonate or alkali hydroxide<br>
selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium<br>
carbonate and potassium carbonate.<br>
In yet another embodiment the rare earth salt solution is selected from rare earth chloride<br>

The novelty of the present invention is use of fly ash which is an industrial waste for high<br>
temperature coating material for protection of steel from high temperature and the<br>
process is novel, easy and economic for preparation of high temperature coating materials<br>
having protection efficiency of about 80-95%.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
About 500 gm. of fly ash collected from the thermal power boiler station was mixed with<br>
100 ml of distilled water and stirred and filtered. The mass was treated with 20ml of<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid of 2N concentration for 30 minutes and again washed with<br>
distilled water and filtered 30 gm. of CaO was added to the filtered mass and then<br>
digested with l.ON calcium hydroxide solutions for 30-60 minutes and allowed to cool to<br>
room temperature. Then 5 ml of 2% solution of rare earth chloride was added to the<br>
above slurry and stirred again. 20 gm. of sodium silicate was added to this slurry .<br>
Mechanically polished mild steel plate specimens (10x5x0.3 cm.) were cleaned,<br>
degreased with acetone and dried. Slurry made as above was coated on the surface of<br>
these plates by hand brush and allowed to dry in air. The coated plates were warmed for<br>
20 minutes and put in a muffle furnace at 600°C for 6hrs.and then allowed to cool in air<br>
at room temperature. Surface deterioration, loss in weight and efficiency of protection has<br>
been observed and determined respectively. It has been found that protection efficiency<br>
of coating obtained from fly ash is 85% where as case of uncoated specimen, scale<br>
formation was 40%.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
750 gm of fly ash collected as above was treated with water, stirred and filtered. The<br>
filtered mass was added to 50 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid of strength 3N and 100 ml of<br>
distilled water was then added to it and stirred for 10 minutes and filtered. 50 gm of<br>
calcium oxide was then added to the filtered mass and mixed properly. 10ml of 2.5%<br>
cerium nitrate salt solution was added to this mix and digested with 50 ml of calcium<br>
hydroxide solution of strength 2N for 45minutes and 150ml of distilled water was then<br>
added and again stirred for 30 minutes. 45 gm of binding material then added and slurry<br>
was obtained. Mild steel plates (10cmx5cmx0.3cm) were polished up to 600 grit finish,<br>
degreased with acetone, cleaned and dried. Slurry prepared as above was then applied<br>
over these plates by hand brush and dried. These coated and uncoated mild steel plates<br>
were initially warmed 25 minutes before heating in a muffle furnace at 800°C for 4-6 hrs<br>
and then air cooled. Scale formation, surface deterioration of coated as well as uncoated<br>
plates were noted. Loss in weight was determined. Protection efficiency was found to be<br>
75-80% for fly ash coated plates where as scale formation in case of uncoated plates was<br>
50-70% respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
600 gm of fly ash was used for slurry preparation and treated with water, stirred and<br>
filtered. Then 30ml of hydrochloric acid of strength 2.5N was added to the mass and<br>
stirred for 30 minutes and filtered. 30 gm of calcium oxide was added to the mass and<br>
then digested for 20 minutes and then cooled. 40ml of calcium hydroxide solution was<br>
then added and again stirred. 6ml of 4% cerium chloride salt was added and stirred<br>
again. 20 gm of sodium silicate was added to this slurry. Stainless steel like 304 grade<br>
plates (3cmxlcmxx0.3cm) were mechanically polished up to 600 grit finish and<br>
degreased with acetone, cleaned and dried. Slurry made from fly ash was applied by hand<br>
brush over these plates and dried in air. The coated and uncoated stainless steel plates<br>
were then warmed for 10-20 minutes and heated in a muffle furnace at 800°C for 2-4 hrs<br>
and air cooled. Surface deterioration and scale formation were noted. Loss in weight and<br>
protection efficiency was determined. Protection efficiency of coated material was 80-<br>
95% and scale formation in uncoated materials was 30-50% respectively as shown in(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
