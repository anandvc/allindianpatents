				<td>AN APPARATUS FOR MEASURING A TISSUE ANALYTE<br>
SUCH AS GLUCOSE, IN VIVO<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to the calibration and maintenance of glucose<br>
analyzers. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of alternative site<br>
glucose determinations to improve algorithm development, calibration, and/or quality<br>
control of noninvasive or implantable glucose analyzers.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
Diabetes is a chronic disease that results in improper production and utilization of<br>
insulin, a hormone that facilitates glucose uptake into ceils. While a precise cause of<br>
diabetes is unknown, genetic factors, environmental factors, and obesity appear to<br>
play roles. Diabetics have increased risk in three broad categories; cardiovascular<br>
heart disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Diabetics may have one or more of the<br>
following complications: heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, kidney<br>
disease, neuropathy (nerve disease and amputations), retinopathy, diabetic<br>
ketoacidosis, skin conditions, gum disease, impotence, and fetal complications.<br>
Diabetes is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Moreover, diabetes is<br>
merely one among a group of disorders of glucose metabolism that also includes<br>
impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperinsulinemia, or hypoglycemia.<br><br>
DIABETES PREVALENCE AND TRENDS<br>
Diabetes is an ever more common disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)<br>
estimates that diabetes currently afflicts 154 million people worldwide. There are 54<br>
million people with diabetes living in developed countries. The WHO estimates that<br>
the number of people with diabetes will grow to 300 million by the year 2025. In the<br>
United States, 15.7 million people or 5.9 per cent of the population are estimated to<br>
have diabetes. Within the United States, the prevalence of adults diagnosed with<br>
diabetes increased by six percent in 1999 and rose by 33 percent between 1990 and<br>
1998. This corresponds to approximately eight hundred thousand new cases every<br>
year in America. The estimated total cost to the United States economy alone<br>
exceeds $90 billion per year. Diabetes Statistics. National Institutes of Health,<br>
Publication No. 98-3926, Bethesda, MD (November 1997).<br>
Long-term clinical studies show that the onset of complications can be significantly<br>
reduced through proper control of blood glucose levels. The Diabetes Control and<br>
Complications Trial Research Group, The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on<br>
the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent<br>
diabetes mellitus, N Eng J of Med , 329:977-86 (1993); U.K. Prospective Diabetes<br>
Study (UKPDS) Group, Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or<br>

with type 2 diabetes, Lancet. 352:837-853 (1998V. and Y. Ohkubo, H. Kishikawa, E.<br>

complications in Japanese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a<br>
randomized prospective 6-year study, Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 28:103-117 (1995).<br>
A vital element of diabetes management is the self-monitoring of blood glucose<br>
levels by diabetics in the home environment. However, current monitoring<br>
techniques discourage regular use due to the inconvenient and painful nature of<br>
drawing blood through the skin prior to analysis. The Diabetes Control and<br>
Complication Trial Research Group, supra. As a result, noninvasive measurement of<br>
glucose has been identified as a beneficial development for the management of<br>
diabetes. Implantable glucose analyzers eventually coupled to an insulin delivery<br>
system providing an artificial pancreas are also being pursued.<br>
GLUCOSE MEASUREMENT HISTORY, APPROACHES, AND TECHNOLOGIES<br>
Diabetes treatment has progressed through several stages. The combined<br>
development of insulin therapy and in-home glucose determination led to a radical<br>
improvement in the lives of diabetics. Home glucose determination has also<br>
progressed through its own succession of stages. Urine tests for glucose have given<br>
way to the invasive fingerstick glucose determinations that are more accurate but<br>
somewhat painful, also presenting a possible biohazard. The development of<br>
alternative site glucose determinations has somewhat mitigated the pain aspects, but<br>
may have introduced a new difficulty as a result of temporal and spatial differences<br>
in glucose between the well perfused fingertip and the less well perfused alternative<br>
sites. Additionally, the biohazard issue remains. Current research is focusing on the<br>
development of noninvasive technologies that will totally eliminate the pain<br><br><br>
associated with glucose determination and fluid biohazard issues. Finally,<br>
considerable progress has been made in implantable or full-loop systems<br>
incorporating both glucose determination and insulin delivery that will result in the<br>
realization of an artificial pancreas. Blood glucose determination may currently be<br>
categorized into four major types:<br>
•	traditional invasive;<br>
•	alternative invasive;<br>
•	noninvasive; and<br>
•	implantable.<br>
Due to the wide use of these modes of measurement and somewhat loose utilization<br>
of terminology in the literature, a detailed summary of the terminology for each mode<br>
of measurement is provided here in order to clarify usage of the terms herein.<br>
In the medical field, the term 'invasive' is customarily applied to surgical methods<br>
and procedures, generally involving at least some trauma or injury to the tissue, such<br>
as cutting, in order to achieve their object. However, in the glucose determination<br>
field, the term 'invasive' is defined relative to noninvasive. 'Noninvasive' clearly<br>
describes methods, invariably signal-based, in which no biological sample or fluid is<br>
taken from the body in order to perform a glucose measurement. 'Invasive' then<br>
means that a biological sample is collected from the body. Invasive glucose<br>
determinations may then be further broken into two separate groups. The first is a<br>
'traditional invasive' method in which a blood sample is collected from the body from<br>
an artery, vein, or capillary bed in the fingertips or toes. The second is an<br>
'alternative invasive' method in which a sample of blood, interstitial fluid, or biological<br><br><br>
fluid is drawn from a region other than an artery, vein, or capillary bed in the<br>
fingertips or toes.<br>
1. Traditional Invasive Glucose Determination<br>
There are three major categories of traditional (classic) invasive glucose<br>
determinations. The first two utilize blood drawn with a needle from an artery or<br>
vein, respectively. The third consists of capillary blood obtained via lancet from the<br>
fingertip or toes. Over the past two decades, this has become the most common<br>
method for self-monitoring of blood glucose.<br>
Common technologies are utilized to analyze the blood collected by venous or<br>
arterial draw and finger stick approaches. Glucose analysis includes techniques<br>
such as colorimetric and enzymatic glucose analysis. The most common enzymatic<br>
based glucose analyzers utilize glucose oxidase, which catalyzes the reaction of<br>
glucose with oxygen to form gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide as shown by<br>
equation 1, infra. Glucose determination includes techniques based upon depletion<br>
of oxygen in the sample either through the changes in sample pH, or through the<br>
formation of hydrogen peroxide. A number of colorimetric and electro-enzymatic<br>
techniques further utilize the reaction products as a starting reagent. For example,<br>
hydrogen peroxide reacts in the presence of platinum to form the hydrogen ion,<br>
oxygen, and current; any of which may be utilized indirectly to determine the glucose<br>
concentration, as in equation 2.<br><br><br><br>
It is noted that a number of alternative site methodologies such as the<br>
THERASENSE FREESTYLE (THERASENSE, INC., Alameda CA) collect blood<br>
samples from regions other than the fingertip or toes. These technologies are not<br>
herein referred to as traditional invasive glucose meters unless the sample is drawn<br>
from the fingertip or toes despite having similar chemical analyses such as the<br>
colorimetric or enzymatic analysis described above. However, the same device<br>
utilized to collect blood via lancet from sample sites consisting of the fingertip or toe<br>
is a traditional invasive glucose analyzer.<br>
2. Alternative Invasive Glucose Determination<br>
There are several alternative invasive methods of determining glucose<br>
concentration. A first group of alternative invasive glucose analyzers have a number<br>
of similarities to the traditional invasive glucose analyzers. One similarity is that<br>
blood samples are acquired with a lancet. Obviously, this form of alternative<br>
invasive glucose determination while unsuitable for analysis of venous or arterial<br>
blood, may be utilized to collect capillary blood samples. A second similarity is that<br>
the blood sample is analyzed using chemical analyses that resemble the colorimetric<br>
and enzymatic analyses describe above. The primary difference, however, is that in<br>
an alternative invasive glucose determination the blood sample is not collected from<br>
the fingertip or toes. For example, according to package labeling, the<br>
THERASENSE FREESTYLE meter may be utilized to collect and analyze blood from<br>
the forearm. This is an alternative invasive glucose determination due to the location<br>
of the lancet draw. In this first group of alternative invasive methods based upon<br><br><br>
blood draws with a lancet, a primary difference between the alternative invasive and<br>
traditional invasive glucose determination is the location of the site of blood<br>
acquisition from the body. Additional differences include factors such as the gauge<br>
of the lancet, the depth of penetration of the lancet, timing issues, the volume of<br>
blood acquired, and environmental factors such as the partial pressure of oxygen,<br>
altitude, and temperature. This form of alternative invasive glucose determination<br>
includes samples collected from the palmar region, base of thumb, forearm, upper<br>
arm, head, earlobe, torso, abdominal region, thigh, calf, and plantar region.<br>
A second group of alternative invasive glucose analyzers is distinguished by their<br>
mode of sample acquisition. This group of glucose analyzers has a common<br>
characteristic of acquiring a biological sample from the body or modifying the surface<br>
of the skin to gather a sample without utilization of a lancet for subsequent analysis.<br>
For example, a laser poration based glucose analyzer utilizes a burst or stream of<br>
photons to create a small hole in the skin surface. A sample of substantially<br>
interstitial fluid collects in the resulting hole. Subsequent analysis of the sample for<br>
glucose constitutes an alternative invasive glucose analysis, whether or not the<br>
sample was actually removed from the created hole. A second common<br>
characteristic is that a device and algorithm are utilized to determine glucose from<br>
the sample. Herein, the term alternative invasive includes techniques that analyze<br>
biosamples such as interstitial fluid, whole blood, mixtures of interstitial fluid and<br>
whole blood, and selectively sampled interstitial fluid. An example of selectively<br>
sampled interstitial fluid is collected fluid in which large or less mobile constituents<br>
are not fully represented in the resulting sample. For this second group of alternative<br>
invasive glucose analyzers sampling sites include: the hand, fingertips, palmar<br><br><br>
region, base of thumb, forearm, upper arm, head, earlobe, eye, chest, torso,<br>
abdominal region, thigh, calf, foot, plantar region, and toes. A number of<br>
methodologies exist for the collection of samples for alternative invasive<br>
measurements including:<br>
•	Laser poration: In these systems, photons of one or more wavelengths are<br>
applied to skin creating a small hole in the skin barrier. This allows small<br>
volumes of interstitial fluid to become available for a number of sampling<br>
techniques;<br>
•	Applied current: In these systems, a small electrical current is applied to the<br>
skin allowing interstitial fluid to permeate through the skin;<br>
•	Suction: In these systems, a partial vacuum is applied to a local area on the<br>
surface of the skin. Interstitial fluid permeates the skin and is collected.<br>
In all of the above techniques, the analyzed sample is interstitial fluid. However,<br>
some of these same techniques can be applied to the skin in a fashion that draws<br>
blood. For example, the laser poration method can result in blood droplets. As<br>
described herein, any technique that draws biosamples from the skin without the use<br>
of a lancet on the fingertip or toes is referred to as an alternative invasive technique.<br>
In addition, it is recognized that the alternative invasive systems each use different<br>
sampling approaches that lead to different subsets of the interstitial fluid being<br>
collected. For example, large proteins might lag behind in the skin while smaller,<br>
more diffusive, elements may be preferentially sampled. This leads to samples<br>
being collected with varying analyte and interferent concentrations. Another<br>
example is that a mixture of whole blood and interstitial fluid may be collected.<br>
These techniques may be utilized in combination. For example the SOFT-TACT,<br><br><br>
also known as the SOFTSENSE (ABBOT LABORATORIES. INC. Abbot Park ID.<br>
applies suction to the skin followed by a lancet stick. Despite the differences in<br>
sampling, these techniques are referred to as alternative invasive techniques<br>
sampling interstitial fluid.<br>
The literature occasionally refers to the alternative invasive technique as an<br>
alternative site glucose determination or as a minimally invasive technique. The<br>
minimally invasive nomenclature derives from the method by which the sample is<br>
collected. As described herein, the alternative site glucose determinations that draw<br>
i<br>
blood or interstitial fluid, even _ microliter, are considered to be alternative invasive<br>
glucose determination techniques as defined above. Examples of alternative<br>
invasive techniques include the THERASENSE FREESTYLE when not sampling<br>
fingertips or toes, the GLUCOWATCH (CYGNUS, INC., Redwood City CA) the ONE<br>
TOUCH ULTRA (LIFESCAN, INC., Milpitas CA), and equivalent technologies.<br>
A wide range of technologies serve to analyze biosamples collected with alternative<br>
invasive techniques. The most common of these technologies are:<br>
• Conventional: With some modification, the interstitial fluid samples may be<br>
analyzed by most of the technologies utilized to determine glucose<br>
concentrations in serum, plasma, or whole blood. These include<br>
electrochemical, electroenzymatic, and colorimetric approaches. For<br>
example, the enzymatic and colorimetric approaches described above may<br>
also be used to determine the glucose concentration in interstitial fluid<br>
samples;<br><br><br>
• Spectrophotometries A number of approaches for determining the glucose<br>
concentration in biosamples, have been developed that utilize<br>
spectrophotometry technologies. These techniques include: Raman and<br>
fluorescence, as well as techniques using light from the ultraviolet through the<br>
infrared [ultraviolet (200 to 400 nm), visible (400 to 700 nm), near-IR (700 to<br>
2500 nm or 14,286 to 4000 cm1), and infrared (2500 to 14,285 nm or 4000 to<br>
700 cm'1)].<br>
As used herein, the term invasive glucose analyzer encompasses both traditional<br>
invasive glucose analyzers and alternative invasive glucose analyzers.<br>
3. Noninvasive Glucose Determination<br>
There exist a number of noninvasive approaches for glucose determination. These<br>
approaches vary widely, but have at least two common steps. First, an apparatus is<br>
utilized to acquire a signal from the body without obtaining a biological sample.<br>
Second, an algorithm is utilized to convert this signal into a glucose determination.<br>
One type of noninvasive glucose determination is based upon spectra. Typically, a<br>
noninvasive apparatus utilizes some form of spectroscopy to acquire the signal or<br>
spectrum from the body. Utilized spectroscopic techniques include, but are not<br>
limited to: Raman and fluorescence, as well as techniques using light from ultraviolet<br>
through the infrared [ultraviolet (200 to 400 nm), visible (400 to 700 nm), near-IR<br>
(700 to 2500 nm or 14,286 to 4000 cm'1), and infrared (2500 to 14,285 nm or 4000 to<br>
700 cm'1)]. A particular range for noninvasive glucose determination in diffuse<br>
reflectance mode is about 1100 to 2500 nm or ranges therein. K. Hazen, Glucose<br>
Determination in Biological Matrices Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, doctoral<br><br><br>
dissertation, University of Iowa (1995). It is important to note that these techniques<br>
are distinct from the traditional invasive and alternative invasive techniques listed<br>
above in that the sample interrogated is a portion of the human body in-situ, not a<br>
biological sample acquired from the human body.<br>
Typically, three modes are utilized to collect noninvasive scans: transmittance,<br>
transfleqtance, and/or diffuse reflectance. For example the signal collected, typically<br>
consisting of light or a spectrum, may be transmitting through a region of the body<br>
such as a fingertip, diffusely reflected, or transflected. Transflected here refers to<br>
collection of the signal not at the incident point or area (diffuse reflectance), and not<br>
at the opposite side of the sample (transmittance), but rather at some point on the<br>
body between the transmitted and diffuse reflectance collection area. For example,<br>
transflected light enters the fingertip or forearm in one region and exits in another<br>
region typically 0.2 to 5 mm or more away depending on the wavelength utilized.<br>
Thus, light that is strongly absorbed by the body such as light near water absorbance<br>
maxima at 1450 or 1950 nm would need to be collected after a small radial<br>
divergence and light that is less absorbed such as light near water absorbance<br>
minima at 1300,1600, or 2250 nm may be collected at greater radial or transflected<br>
distances from the incident photons.<br>
Noninvasive techniques are not limited to using the fingertip as a measurement site.<br>
Alternative sites for taking noninvasive measurements include: a hand, finger,<br>
palmar region, base of thumb, forearm, volar aspect of the forearm, dorsal aspect of<br>
the forearm, upper arm, head, earlobe, eye, tongue, chest, torso, abdominal region,<br>
thigh, calf, foot, plantar region, and toe. It is important to note that noninvasive<br><br><br>
techniques do not have to be based upon spectroscopy. For example, a<br>
bioimpedence meter would be considered a noninvasive device. Within the context<br>
of the invention, any device that reads a signal from the body without penetrating the<br>
skin and collecting a biological sample is referred to as a noninvasive glucose<br>
analyzer. For example, a bioimpedence meter is a noninvasive device.<br>
An alternative reference method is a reference determination made at a location on<br>
the body not including the fingertips and toes. An alternative reference includes both<br>
an alternative invasive measurement and an alternative site noninvasive<br>
measurement. Hence, an alternative site noninvasive measurement is a noninvasive<br>
measurement made at physiological sites excluding the fingertips and toes.<br>
4. Implantable Sensor for Glucose Determination<br>
There exist a number of approaches for implanting a glucose sensor into the body<br>
for glucose determination. These implantables may be utilized to collect a sample<br>
for further analysis or may acquire a reading or signal from the sample directly or<br>
indirectly. Two categories of implantable glucose analyzers exist: short-term and<br>
long-term.<br>
As referred to herein, a device or a collection apparatus is at least a short-term<br>
implantable (as opposed to a long-term implantable) if part of the device penetrates<br>
the skin for a period of greater than 3 hours and less than one month. For example,<br>
a wick placed subcutaneously to collect a sample overnight that is removed and<br>
analyzed for glucose content representative of the interstitial fluid glucose<br>
concentration is referred to as a short term implantable. Similarly, a biosensor or<br><br><br>
electrode placed under the skin for a period of greater than three hours that reads a<br>
signal indicative of a glucose concentration or level, directly or indirectly is referred to<br>
as at least a short-term implantable device. Conversely, devices described above<br>
based upon techniques like a lancet, applied current, laser poration, or suction are<br>
referred to as either a traditional invasive or alternative invasive technique as they do<br>
not fulfill both the three hour and skin penetration parameters. As described herein,<br>
long-term, implantables are distinguished from short-term implantables by having the<br>
criteria that they must both penetrate the skin and be utilized for a period of one<br>
month or longer. Long term implantables may remain in the body for many years.<br>
Implantable glucose analyzers vary widely, but have at least several features in<br>
common. First, at least part of the device penetrates the skin. More commonly, the<br>
entire device is imbedded into the body. Second, the apparatus is utilized to acquire<br>
either a sample of the body or a signal relating directly or indirectly to the glucose<br>
concentration within the body. If the implantable device collects a sample, readings<br>
or measurements on the sample may be collected after removal from the body.<br>
Alternatively, readings or signals may be transmitted from within the body by the<br>
device or utilized for such purposes as insulin delivery while in the body. Third, an<br>
algorithm is utilized to convert the signals into readings directly or indirectly related to<br>
the glucose concentration. An implantable analyzer may read signals from one or<br>
more of a variety of body fluids or tissues including but not limited to: arterial blood,<br>
venous blood, capillary blood, interstitial fluid, and selectively sampled interstitial<br>
fluid. An implantable analyzer may also collect glucose information from skin tissue,<br>
cerebral spinal fluid, organ tissue, or through an artery or vein. For example, an<br>
implantable glucose analyzer may be placed transcutaneously, in the peritoneal<br><br><br>
cavity, in an artery, in muscle, or in an organ such as the liver or brain. The<br>
implantable glucose sensor may be one component of an artificial pancreas.<br>
Examples of implantable glucose monitors follow. One example of a CGMS<br>
(continuous glucose monitoring system) is a group of glucose monitors based upon<br>
open-flow microperfusion. Z. Trajanowski, G. Brunner, L Schaupp, M. Ellmerer, P.<br>
Wach, T-Pieber, P. Kotanko, F. Skrabai, Open-flow microperfusion of subcutaneous<br>
adipose tissue for on-line continuous ex vivo measurement of glucose concentration,<br>
Diabetes Care, 20:1114-1120 (1997). Another example utilizes implanted sensors<br>
that comprise biosensors and amperometric sensors. Z. Trajanowski, P. Wach, R.<br>
Gfrerer, Portable device for continuous fractionated blood sampling and continuous<br>
ex vivo blood glucose monitoring, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 11:479-487 (1996).<br>
Another example is the MINIMED CGMS (MEDTRONIC, INC., Minneapolis MN).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED TECHNOLOGY<br>
GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION MEASURED AT FINGERTIP VS. ALTERNATIVE<br>
SAMPLING LOCATIONS<br>
Many authors claim that alternative site glucose concentrations are equivalent to<br>
fingerstick glucose determination. A number of examples are summarized below:<br>
Szuts, et al. conclude that measurable physiological differences in glucose<br>
concentration between the arm and fingertip could be determined, but that these<br>
differences were found to be clinically insignificant even in those subjects in whom<br>
they were measured. E. Szuts, J. Lock, K. Malomo, A. Anagnostopoulos, Althea,<br><br><br>

McGarraugh, Alternate site glucose testing: a crossover design, Diabetes<br>

factors such as pain and frequency of testing will impact the study.<br>

states. N. Peled, D. Wong, S. Gwalani, Comparison of glucose levels in capillary<br>

Based upon a study utilizing fast acting insulin injected intravenously, Jungheim, et<br>
al. suggested that to avoid risky delays in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia<br><br><br>
detection, monitoring at the arm should be limited to situations in which ongoing<br>
rapid changes in the blood glucose concentration can be excluded. K. Jungheim, T.<br>

K. Jungheim; T. Koschinsky, Risky delay of hypoglycemia detection by glucose<br>
monitoring at the arm, Diabetes Care, 24:1303-1304 (2001). The use of intravenous<br>
insulin in this study was criticized as creating physiological extremes that influence<br>
the observed differences. G. McGarraugh, Response to Jungheim and Koschinsky,<br>
Diabetes Care, 24:1304:1306 (2001).<br>
Equilibration Approaches<br>
While there exist multiple reports that glucose concentrations are very similar when<br>
collected from the fingertip or alternative locations, a number of sampling<br>
approaches have been recommended to increase localized perfusion at the sample<br>
site to equilibrate the values just prior to sampling. Several of these approaches are<br>
summarized below:<br>
Pressure: One sampling methodology requires rubbing or applying pressure to the<br>
sampling site in order to increase localized perfusion prior to obtaining a sample via<br>
lancet. An example of this is the FREESTYLE blood glucose analyzer<br>
(THERASENSE, INC., supra). G. McGarraugh, S. Schwartz, R. Weinstein, Glucose<br>
Measurements Using Blood Extracted from the Forearm and the Finger,<br>

Schwartz, R. Weinstein, Physiological influences on off-finger glucose testing,<br>
Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics, 3:367-376 (2001).<br><br><br>
Heating: Heat applied to the localized sample site has been proposed as a<br>
mechanism for equalizing the concentration between the vascular system and skin<br>
tissue. This may be to dilate the capillaries allowing more blood flow, which leads'<br>
towards equalization of the venous and capillary glucose concentrations.<br>
Alternatively, vasodilating agents such as nicotinic acid, methyl nicotinamide,<br>
minoxidil, nitroglycerin, histamine, capsaicin, or menthol can be utilized to increase<br>
local blood flow. M. Rohrscheib, C. Gardner, M. Robinson, Method and apparatus<br>
for noninvasive blood analyte measurement with fluid compartment equilibration,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,240,306 (May 29,2001).<br>
Vacuum: Applying a partial vacuum to the skin at and around the sampling site prior<br>
to sample collection has also been utilized. A localized deformation in the skin may<br>
allow superficial capillaries to fill more completely. T. Ryan, A study of the epidermal<br>
capillary unit in psoriasis, Dermatologica, 138:459-472 (1969). For example, ABBOT<br>
LABORATORIES, INC. utilizes a vacuum device at one-half atmosphere that pulls<br>
the skin up 3.5 mm into their device. ABBOT maintains this deformation results in<br>
increased perfusion that equalizes the glucose concentration between the alternative<br>
site and the fingertip. R. Ng, Presentation to the FDA at the Clinical Chemistry &amp;<br>
Clinical Toxicotogy Devices Panel Meeting, Gaithersburg MD (October 29, 2001).<br>
Calibration:<br><br>
Glucose analyzers require calibration. This is true for all types of glucose analyzers<br>
such as traditional invasive, alternative invasive, noninvasive, and implantable<br>
analyzers. One fact associated with noninvasive glucose analyzers is the fact that<br>
they are secondary in nature, that is, they do not measure blood glucose levels<br>
directly. This means that a primary method is required to calibrate these devices to<br>
measure blood glucose levels properly. Many methods of calibration exist.<br>
Calibration of Traditional Invasive Glucose Analyzers:<br>
Glucose meters or analyzers may be calibrated off of biological samples such as<br>
whole blood, serum, plasmas, or modified solutions of these samples. In addition,<br>
glucose analyzers may be calibrated with a range of whole blood samples, modified<br>
whole blood samples, blood simulants, phantoms, or a range of chemically prepared<br>
standards. Typically, these samples have glucose concentrations that span the<br>
desired functionality range of the glucose analyzer. For glucose analyzers, this is<br>
approximately 70 to 400 mg/dL Some go further into the hypoglycemic range, down<br>
to 40 or even 0 mg/dL, while some go well into the hyperglycemic range, up to 700<br>
or 1000 mg/dL<br>
Calibration of Alternative Invasive Glucose Analyzers:<br>
Alternative invasive glucose analyzers utilize many of the invasive glucose<br>
calibration procedures. When calibrating the alternative invasive glucose meters that<br>
utilize biological fluids such as blood or interstitial fluid as a reference, relatively<br>
minor modifications to the traditional calibration approaches may be required.<br>
Calibration of Noninvasive Glucose Analyzers:<br><br>
One noninvasive technology, near-infrared spectroscopy, provides the opportunity<br>
for both frequent and painless noninvasive measurement of glucose. This approach<br>
involves the illumination of a spot on the body with near-infrared (NIR)<br>
electromagnetic radiation, light in the wavelength range 700 to 2500 nm. The light is<br>
partially absorbed and scattered, according to its interaction with the constituents of<br>
the tissue. The actual tissue volume that is sampled is the portion of irradiated<br>
tissue from which light is transflected or diffusely transmitted to the spectrometer<br>
detection system. With near-infrared spectroscopy, a mathematical relationship<br>
between an in vivo near-infrared measurement and the actual blood glucose value<br>
needs to be developed. This is achieved through the collection of in vivo NIR<br>
measurements with corresponding blood glucose values that have been obtained<br>
directly through the use of measurement tools like the HEMOCUE (YSI<br>
INCORPORATED, Yellow Springs OH), or any appropriate and accurate traditional<br>
invasive reference device.<br>
For spectrophotometric based analyzers, there are several univariate and<br>
multivariate methods that can be used to develop the mathematical relationship<br>
between the measured signal and the actual blood glucose value. However, the<br>
basic equation being solved is known as the Beer-Lambert Law. This law states that<br>
the strength of an absorbance/reflectance measurement is proportional to the<br>
concentration of the analyte which is being measured, as in equation 3,<br><br><br>
where A is the absorbance/reflectance measurement at a given wavelength of light, ε<br>
is the molar absorptivity associated with the molecule of interest at the same given<br>
wavelength, b is the distance that the light travels, and C is the concentration of the<br>
molecule of interest (glucose).<br>
Chemometric calibration techniques extract the glucose signal from the measured<br>
spectrum through various methods of signal processing and calibration including one<br>
or more mathematical models. The models are still developed through the process<br>
of calibration on the basis of an exemplary set of spectral measurements known as<br>
the calibration set and associated set of reference blood glucose values based upon<br>
an analysis of fingertip capillary blood or venous blood. Common multivariate<br>
approaches requiring an exemplary reference glucose concentration vector for each<br>
sample spectrum in a calibration include partial least squares (PLS) and principal<br>
component regression (PCR). Many additional forms of calibration are known, such<br>
as neural networks.<br>
Because every method has error, it is desirable that the primary device used to<br>
measure blood glucose be as accurate as possible to minimize the error that<br>
propagates through the mathematical relationship developed. While it appears<br>
reasonable to assume that any FDA-approved blood glucose monitor should be<br>
suitable, for accurate verification of the secondary method, a monitor having a<br>
percentage error of less than 5 percent is desirable. Meters with increased<br>
percentage error such as 10 percent may also be acceptable, though the error of the<br>
device being calibrated may increase.<br><br>
Although the above is well-understood, one aspect that is forgotten is that secondary<br>
methods require constant verification that they are providing consistent and accurate<br>
measurements when compared to the primary method. This means that a method<br>
for checking blood glucose values directly and comparing those values with the<br>
given secondary method is required. Such monitoring is manifested in quality<br>
assurance and quality control programs. Bias adjustments are often made to a<br>
calibration. In some cases the most appropriate calibration is selected based upon<br>
these secondary methods. S. Malin, T. Ruchti, Intelligent system for noninvasive<br>
blood analyte prediction, U.S. Patent No. 6,280,381 (August 28, 2001). This<br>
approach is also known as validation.<br>
The Problem;<br>
Calibration of a noninvasive glucose analyzer entails some complications not<br>
observed in traditional invasive glucose analyzers. For example, spectroscopic or<br>
spectrophotometric based noninvasive glucose analyzers probe a sample that is not<br>
entirely whole blood or interstitial fluid. Photons penetrate into the body, interact with<br>
body layers and/or tissues and are detected upon reemerging from the body.<br>
Hence, many possible interferences exist that do not exist in a prepared reference or<br>
calibration sample. In addition, the interferences and matrices encountered are part<br>
of a living being and hence are dynamic in nature. For these reasons, indirect<br>
calibration is often attempted with traditional invasive reference glucose<br>
determinations collected from the fingertip. This approach, however, introduces<br>
errors into the noninvasive analyzer that are associated with sampling the reference<br>
glucose concentration. One key source of error is the difference between glucose<br>
concentrations at the site tested by the noninvasive glucose analyzer and the<br><br><br>
reference site sampled with an invasive technology. Thus, it would be an important<br>
advance in the art to provide methods for calibrating and maintaining signal-based<br>
analyzers that addressed the negative effect on their accuracy and precision that<br>
results from calibrating them based on invasive reference samples taken at sites<br>
distant from the site of noninvasive sampling.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides methods for utilizing either alternative invasive glucose<br>
determinations or alternative site noninvasive glucose determinations for calibrating<br>
noninvasive or implantable glucose analyzers. Use of an alternative invasive or<br>
alternative site noninvasive glucose determination in the calibration allows for<br>
minimization of errors built into the glucose analyzer model, including errors due to<br>
sampling, methodology, and error due to temporal and spatial variation of glucose<br>
concentration within the subject's body. In addition, the method provides conversion<br>
of glucose concentrations determined from noninvasive or alternative reference<br>
determinations into traditional invasive glucose determinations. As described herein,<br>
the use of an alternative invasive or noninvasive glucose determination for<br>
calibration is also understood to include their utilization for glucose determination,<br>
prediction, calibration transfer, calibration maintenance, quality control, and quality<br>
assurance.<br>
The use of alternative invasive or alternative site noninvasive reference<br>
determinations provides a means for calibrating on the basis of glucose<br><br><br>
determinations that reflect the matrix observed and the variable measured by the<br>
analyzer more closely. Statistical correlations between noninvasive and alternative<br>
invasive glucose determinations and traditional invasive glucose determinations may<br>
then be utilized to adjust alternative site noninvasive or alternative invasive glucose<br>
concentrations to traditional invasive glucose concentrations. The invention also<br>
provides an apparatus in which a invasive stick meter is coupled to a noninvasive<br>
glucose, analyzer for calibration, validation, adaptation, and safety check of the<br>
calibration model embodied in the noninvasive analyzer.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention reduces the error in the reference glucose concentration for<br>
the calibration of glucose sensors and therefore leads to a more accurate, precise,<br>
and robust glucose measurement system.<br>
DIFFERENCE IN TRADITIONAL INVASIVE AND ALTERNATIVE INVASIVE<br>
GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION<br>
Initially, differences between traditional invasive and alternative invasive glucose<br>
determinations are demonstrated. It is demonstrated here that the differences<br>
between the alternative invasive glucose concentration from a site such as the<br>
forearm and the glucose concentration from a traditional invasive fingerstick vary as<br>
a function of at least time and location. Additional parameters include sampling<br>
methodology, physiology, and glucose-analyzer instrumentation.<br>
EXAMPLE #1<br>
In a first example, variation of glucose concentration at locations in the body is<br>
demonstrated at fixed points in time. A total of twenty diabetic subjects were run<br>
through one of two glucose profiles each having two peaks so that the resulting<br><br><br>
curves formed the shape of an 'M,' shown in part in Figure 1, over a period of eight<br>
hours. Thus, glucose concentration started low at around 80 mg/dL, was increased<br>
to approximately 350 mg/dL, and was brought back to about 80 mg/dL in a period of<br>
about four hours. The cycle was immediately repeated to form an 'M'-shaped<br>
glucose concentration profile. These profiles were alternately generated with intake<br>
of a liquid form of carbohydrate (50 -100 g) or intake of a solid form of carbohydrate<br>
(50 - 100g) in combination with insulin to generate the two excursions of the 'M'<br>
profile. Traditional invasive fingertip capillary glucose concentrations were<br>
determined every 15 minutes throughout the 8-hour period. Each fingertip<br>
' determination was immediately followed by an alternative invasive capillary glucose<br>
determinations wherein samples were collected from the volar aspect of the subject's<br>
right and then left forearms. The resulting data set included 1920 data points (20<br>
subjects * 3 sites/15 minutes * 32 draws/day). J. Fischer, K. Hazen, M. Welch, L.<br>
Hockersmith, J. Coates, Comparisons of capillary blood glucose concentrations from<br>
the fingertips and the volar aspects of the left and right forearms, American Diabetes<br>
Association, 62nd Annual Meeting, (June 14, 2002). The 'M'-shaped profiles<br>
described above may be induced according to procedures previously set forth in L.<br>
Hockersmith, A method of producing a glycemic profile of predetermined shape in a<br>
test subject, U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 09/766,427 (January 18, 2001), the<br>
entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
Four partial 'M' profiles from the above study are presented here. In Figure 1,<br>
alternative invasive glucose concentrations measured at the forearm are<br>
demonstrated to have both a dampened and a lagged profile versus the traditional<br>
invasive fingertip glucose concentrations. For this individual, when the glucose<br><br><br>
concentration was rising the forearm glucose concentrations are observed to be<br>
substantially dampened, that is lower than the corresponding fingertip glucose<br>
concentration. For example, at the 90 minute mark the fingertip glucose<br>
concentration of 234 mg/dL is more than 100 mg/dL higher than either the left or<br>
right forearm glucose concentration of 123 and 114 mg/dL, respectively. In addition,<br>
the peak glucose concentration observed at the fingertip of 295 mg/dL is both larger<br>
and occurred 30 minutes earlier than the peak forearm glucose concentration of 259<br>
mg/dL. Finally, the forearm glucose concentrations have a small lag versus the<br>
fingertip glucose concentrations. Figure 2 presents another glucose profile in which<br>
many of the same effects just described are observed but to a lesser degree. For<br>
example, the rising glucose concentrations of the alternative invasive forearm<br>
glucose concentrations are still less than those of the traditional invasive fingertip<br>
glucose concentrations, but the difference is smaller. A dampening and lag of the<br>
alternative invasive peak are still observed. One measure of dampening is the range<br>
of traditional invasive glucose concentrations minus the range of alternative invasive<br>
glucose concentrations. In addition, the lag is more pronounced than in the previous<br>
figure. Figure 3 demonstrates another example in which the forearm glucose<br>
concentrations closely track those of the fingertip glucose concentrations. Finally,<br>
Figure 4 demonstrates a historesis effect as a subject moves through subsequent<br>
glucose excursions. That is, a lag observed in a forearm may still be observed at a<br>
later time. In this case, dampening of the forearm glucose concentration is observed<br>
at a glucose minimum relative to that of the fingertip glucose concentration. The<br>
effects observed above are representative as a whole of the glucose profiles<br>
observed in the study outlined above.<br><br><br>
As in Figure 5, alternative invasive glucose determinations collected from the volar<br>
aspect of each subject's left and right forearm are plotted against the time-<br>
associated traditional invasive fingertip reference glucose concentration for all<br>
subjects in a concentration correlation plot overlaid with a Clarke error grid. The<br>
standard error of the forearm glucose concentrations versus the fingertip glucose<br>
concentration is relatively large at 37.7 mg/dL with an F-value of 4.43. The best fit of<br>
the data-yields a slope of 0.76 and an intercept of 41.4 mg/dL. This is consistent<br>
with dampened and delayed forearm glucose profiles relative to the fingertip and<br>
results in only 73.8% of the points falling in the 'A' region of the Clarke error grid.<br>
The glucose determinations collected from the volar aspect of each subject's left and<br>
right forearm are plotted against each other for all subjects on a Clarke error grid in<br>
i<br>
Figure 6. The standard error of the left forearm glucose concentrations versus the<br>
right forearm glucose concentration is reduced to 17.2 mg/dL with an F-value of<br>
16.0. The best fit of the data yields a slope of 0.96 and an intercept of 8.3 mg/dL.<br>
This is consistent with a reduction in the dampening and delay of left forearm<br>
glucose profiles relative to the right forearm glucose concentrations and results in<br>
95.8 percent of the points falling in the 'A' region of the Clarke error grid. A slope of<br>
0.96, combined with the low standard error, indicates that the capillary blood glucose<br>
values of the left and right volar forearm would be similar.<br>
These data suggest several conclusions:<br>
• during a glucose excursion, substantial differences are often observed<br>
between the capillary blood glucose of the untreated forearm and the fingertip;<br><br><br>
•	fast changes in blood glucose concentration magnify differences between the<br>
measured blood glucose concentration of the fingertip and forearm while the<br>
relative errors are proportional to the glucose concentration;<br>
•	during periods of rapid change in blood glucose concentration, differences<br>
between the forearm and fingertip give rise to a higher percentage of points in<br>
less desirable regions of the Clarke error grid;<br>
•	the measured blood glucose concentrations of the volar aspect of the left and<br>
right forearms appear similar; and<br>
•	finally, these findings are consistent with the phenomenon of decreased<br>
perfusion into the forearm versus that of the fingertip, leading to a dampening<br>
and/or lag in the glucose profile.<br>
These conclusions are consistent with those reported in the circulatory physiology<br>
literature and that relating to sampling approaches of alternative invasive glucose<br>
analyzers. It has been reported that blood flow in the fingers is 33±10 mL/g/min at<br>
20°C while in the leg, forearm, and abdomen the blood flow is 4-6 mL/g/min at 19-<br>
22°C. V. Harvey, Sparks, skin and muscle, in: Peripheral Circulation. P. Johnson,<br>
ed., p.198, New York (1978). This is consistent with the observed differences in<br>
localized blood glucose concentration. When glucose concentrations vary rapidly a<br>
difference develops throughout the body in local blood glucose concentrations as a<br>
result of differences in local tissue perfusion. For example, the blood flow in the<br>
fingers of the hand is greater than in alternative sites. This means that the blood<br>
glucose in the fingertips will equilibrate more rapidly with venous blood glucose<br>
concentrations. Furthermore, the magnitude of differences in local glucose<br>
concentrations between two sites is related to the rate of change in blood glucose<br><br><br>
concentrations. Conversely, under steady-state glucose conditions, the glucose<br>
concentration through-out the body tends to be uniform.<br>
An additional study demonstrated that localized variations in the glucose<br>
concentration in the dorsal versus volar aspect of the forearm are small versus<br>
differences between the glucose concentrations observed in either forearm region<br>
versus that of the fingertip. J. Fischer, K. Hazen, M. Welch, L. Hockersmith, R<br>
Guttridge, T. Ruchti, physiological differences between volar and dorsal capillary<br>
forearm glucose concentrations and finger stick glucose concentrations in diabetics,<br>
American Diabetes Association, 62nd Annual Meeting (June 14,2002).<br>
Another study demonstrated very small localized variation in glucose concentration<br>
within a region such as the dorsal aspect of the forearm with observed differences<br>
approximating the scale of the error observed in the reference method. The glucose<br>
concentrations in the forearm are not observed to vary within three inches laterally or<br>
axially from a central point of the forearm.<br>
In addition to differences in perfusion, the local permeability of tissue to diffusion and<br>
the local uptake of glucose during exercise or other activity can cause non-uniform<br>
distribution of glucose in the body. Finally, when the noninvasive variable and the<br>
reference glucose concentration are not measured simultaneously, an additional<br>
error can occur when glucose is varying in the body.<br>
Physiology<br>
The following physiological interpretations are deduced from these studies:<br><br>
•	during times of glucose change, the glucose concentration as measured on<br>
the arm can lag behind that of the fingertip;<br>
•	a well-recognized difference between the fingertip and the forearm is the rate<br>
of blood flow;<br>
•	differences in circulatory physiology of the off-finger test sites may lead to<br>
differences in the measured blood glucose concentration;<br>
•	on average, the arm and finger glucose concentrations are approximately the<br>
same, but the correlation is not one-to-one. This suggests differences<br>
between traditional invasive glucose concentrations and alternative invasive<br>
glucose concentrations are different during time periods of fasting and after<br>
glucose ingestion;<br>
•	the relationship of forearm and thigh glucose levels to finger glucose is<br>
affected by proximity to a meal. Meter forearm and thigh results during the<br>
sixty and ninety minute postprandial testing sessions are consistently lower<br>
than the corresponding finger results;<br>
•	differences are inversely related to the direction of blood glucose<br>
concentration change;<br>
•	rapid changes may produce significant differences in blood glucose<br>
concentrations measured at the fingertip and forearm; and<br>
•	for individuals, the relationship between forearm and finger blood glucose may<br>
be consistent. However, the magnitude of the day-to-day differences has<br>
been found to vary. Finally, interstitial fluid (ISF) may lead plasma glucose<br>
concentration in the case of falling glucose levels due to exercise or glucose<br>
uptake due to insulin.<br><br><br>
Utilization of the Difference in Traditional Invasive and Alternative Invasive Glucose<br>
Concentration<br>
The discrepancy between the glucose level at the non-invasive measurement site<br>
versus the reference concentration presents a fundamental issue in relation to<br>
calibration. A calibration is generally a mathematical model or curve that is used to<br>
convert the noninvasively measured variable such as absorbance, voltage, or<br>
intensity to an estimate of the glucose concentration. Determination of the<br>
calibration is performed on the basis of a set of paired data points composed of<br>
noninvasive variables and associated reference blood glucose concentrations<br>
collected through a blood draw. Any error introduced by the reference method is<br>
propagated into any error associated with the indirect method as an uncertain,<br>
imprecise, and/or biased calibration.<br>
Method<br>
The invention provides a method of developing a calibration based on either<br>
traditional or alternate invasive reference glucose measurements. The percentage<br>
error in the reference glucose concentration is reduced through the application of<br>
one or more techniques that improve correspondence between the reference<br>
glucose concentration and the glucose concentration reflected in the variable<br>
measured by the sensor, herein referred to as the "sensor variable", thus producing<br>
a superior exemplary set of calibration data for calculating the calibration curve or<br>
model. Both noninvasive and implantable glucose analyzers require a calibration<br>
because they rely on measurement of glucose indirectly from a blood or tissue<br>
property, fluid, parameter, or variable. While the target application is typically an<br><br><br>
optical sensor, any device that measures glucose through a calibration falls within<br>
the scope of the invention. Examples of such systems include:<br>
•	near-infrared spectroscopy (700-2500 nm), O. Khalil, Spectroscopic and<br>
clinical aspects of non-invasive glucose measurements," Clin Chem, 45:165-<br>
77(1999);<br>

•	mid-infrared spectroscopy;<br>
•	Raman spectroscopy;<br>

•	spectroscillating thermal gradient spectrometry, P. Zheng, C. Kramer, C.<br>

•	impedance based glucose determination;<br>
•	nuclear magnetic resonance;<br>
•	optical rotation of polarized light;<br>
•	radio wave impedance;<br>
•	fluid extraction from the skin;<br>
•	glucose oxidase and enzymatic sensors;<br>
•	interstitial fluid harvesting techniques (e.g. microporation or application of a<br>
small electric current) or glucose electrode; and<br>
•	microdialysis.<br>
As previously described, the calibration set constitutes a set of paired data points<br>
collected on one or more subjects; and generally includes glucose concentrations<br><br><br>
that span the expected range of glucose variation. Each paired data point includes a<br>
reference glucose value and an associated value or values of the sensor variable.<br>
The invented method relies on a variety of processes that improve the reference<br>
values of the calibration set, which can be used independently or together.<br>
First is a process for calibrating using a calibration set of paired data points including<br>
a reference glucose value from a traditional invasive method or an alternative<br>
invasive method and a noninvasive sensor measurement. This first process is<br>
based on the recognition that glucose tends to be uniform throughout the tissue<br>
under steady state conditions and that perfusion is the dominant physiological<br>
process leading to differences in glucose under dynamic situations. Within the<br>
context of this first process, a number of techniques are suggested for improving<br>
reference values with respect to their corresponding sensor values:<br>
•	Paired data points are collected at intervals that allow determination of the<br>
rate of glucose change. For example, traditional invasive glucose<br>
determinations and noninvasive signals may be generated every 15 minutes<br>
for a period of four hours. The resulting calibration set is limited to paired data<br>
points with a corresponding rate of glucose change less than a specified<br>
maximum level.<br>
•	Calibration data is collected during periods of stasis or slow change in glucose<br>
concentration. The rate of acceptable change in glucose concentration is<br>
determined on the basis of the tolerable error in the reference values. For<br><br><br>
example, a rate of change of 0.5 mg/dL/minute may be found to be<br>
acceptable;<br>
•	Under dynamic conditions, the circulation at a measurement site is perturbed,<br>
both for an alternative invasive measurement site for calibration and later for<br>
measuring glucose utilizing an alternative invasive glucose analyzer.<br>
Enhancement of circulation in the forearm or alternate testing site, for<br>
example, causes the local glucose concentrations to approach those of the<br>
fingertip. As described above, methods for perturbing circulation may include<br>
ultrasound, or a variety of surface applications that cause vasodilatation,<br>
mechanical stimulation, partial vacuum, and heating;<br>
•	Patients are screened according to the discrepancy between their traditional<br>
invasive glucose concentration at a fingertip or toe and an alternative invasive<br>
glucose determination at the alternative invasive site. For example, subjects<br>
with significant discrepancy between the glucose concentration in the fingertip<br>
and the local tissue volume sampled through a near-infrared device, such as<br>
a forearm, would not be used for calibration. Subjects having a small<br>
difference in glucose concentration between the traditional invasive and<br>
alternative invasive measurement site would be used for calibration. On this<br>
basis subjects are further screened for device applicability for subsequent<br>
glucose predictions; and<br>
Using post-processing techniques, the sensor's estimate of the glucose<br>
concentration is corrected. The method utilizes an estimate of the time lead<br>
or lag between the two glucose concentrations from a cross-correlation or<br>
time series analysis and a correction using an interpolation procedure. A<br><br><br>
similar correction would correct for a dampening of the noninvasive signal<br>
relative to a traditional invasive signal.<br>
In a second process, careful site selection assures that reference values reflect the<br>
concentration of glucose in the sensor variable. According to this process, blood,<br>
serum, plasma, interstitial draws, or selective interstitial sample acquisitions are<br>
taken from a tissue site that is either near the sensor sample site or has been<br>
designed/determined to reflect the sample site. For example, when noninvasive<br>
(sensor) near-infrared measurements are taken for calibration on a forearm, it is<br>
possible in some individuals to collect a capillary blood draw from an alternative<br>
invasive sample site such as the same forearm or from the opposite forearm. The<br>
blood draws are taken in a manner that maintains perfusion equivalence to the<br>
noninvasive sample site.<br>
It is noted that alternative invasive glucose determinations acquire samples from<br>
varying depths. Some acquire interstitial fluid from just below the epidermal later<br>
while others penetrate into capillary blood or subcutaneous fluids. Because a<br>
noninvasive glucose analyzer can be tuned to sense glucose concentrations from<br>
different depths, a logical choice of a reference device is an alternative invasive<br>
analyzer sampling from a similar depth in the skin. For example, a near-IR glucose<br>
analyzer functioning in the 2100 to 2300, 1550 to 1800, or 1100 to 1350 nm region<br>
acquires signal from approximately 1.5, 3, and 5 mm, respectively. Similarly, a<br>
glucose analyzer functioning within 50 nm of 1450, 1900 or 2500 nm samples at<br>
depths of less than 1 mm. Hence, noninvasive technologies that rely on tissue<br>
volumes primarily including the epidermis indirectly measure primarily interstitial<br><br><br>
glucose concentrations and may benefit from alternative invasive glucose analyzers<br>
sampling the interstitial fluid from the epidermis versus an alternative invasive<br>
glucose analyzer that samples blood from the dermis.<br>
Finally, glucose varies dynamically through time in individuals. When a glucose<br>
determination through a blood or interstitial sample cannot be taken simultaneously<br>
with the sensor variable an error can exist due to the time differential. A technique<br>
for reducing this error is based on interpolation and extrapolation of the reference<br>
glucose values to the time the sensor variable was collected.<br>
INSTRUMENTATION<br>
Noninvasive<br>
A number of technologies have been reported for measuring glucose noninvasively<br>
that involve the measurement of a tissue related variable. Examples include but are<br>
not limited to far-infrared absorbance spectroscopy, tissue impedance, Raman, and<br>
fluorescence, as well as techniques using light from the ultraviolet through the<br>
infrared [ultraviolet (200 to 400 nm), visible (400 to 700 nm), near-IR (700 to 2500.<br>
nm or 14,286 to 4000 cm-1), and infrared (2500 to 14,285 nm or 4000 to 700 cm-1)].<br>
These techniques share the common characteristic that they are indirect<br>
measurements of glucose. A calibration is required in order to derive a glucose<br>
concentration from subsequent collected data. In the past, capillary finger blood<br>
glucose and venous blood glucose have been utilized to generate these calibrations.<br>
However, as has been shown, these traditional invasive glucose determinations do<br>
not always represent the glucose concentration at the sampled site.<br><br><br>
A number of spectrometer configurations are possible for collecting noninvasive<br>
spectra of body regions. Typically, a spectrometer, also called a sensor, has one or<br>
more beam paths from a source to a detector. A light source may comprise a<br>
blackbody source, a tungsten-halogen source, one or more LED's, or one or more<br>
laser diodes. For multi-wavelength spectrometers a wavelength selection device<br>
may be utilized or a series of optical filters may be utilized for wavelength selection.<br>
Wavelength selection devices comprise dispersive elements such as one or more<br>
plane, concave, ruled, or holographic grating. Additional wavelength selective<br>
devices include an interferometer, successive illumination of the elements of an LED<br>
array, prisms, and wavelength selective filters. However, variation of the source<br>
such as varying which LED or diode is firing may be utilized. Detectors may in the<br>
form of one or more single element detectors or one or more arrays or bundles of<br>
detectors. Single element or array detectors maybe fabricated from InGaAs, PbS,<br>
PbSe, Si, MCT (mercury-cadmium-tellurium), or the like. Light collection optics such<br>
as fiber optics, lenses, and mirrors are commonly utilized in various configurations<br>
within a spectrometer to direct light from the source to the detector by way of a<br>
sample. The mode of operation may be transmission, diffuse reflectance, or<br>
transflectance. Due to changes in performance of the overall spectrometer,<br>
reference wavelength standards are often scanned. Typically, a wavelength<br>
standard is collected immediately before or after the interrogation of the tissue, but<br>
may also occur at times far removed such as when the spectrometer was originally<br>
manufactured. A typical reference wavelength standard would be polystyrene or a<br>
rare earth oxide such as holmium, erbium, or dysprosium oxide.<br><br><br>
The interface of the glucose analyzer to the tissue includes a patient interface<br>
module and light such as near-infrared radiation is directed to and from the tissue<br>
either directly or through a light pipe, fiber-optics, a lens system, or a light directing<br>
mirror system. The area of the tissue surface to which near-infrared radiation is<br>
applied and the area of the tissue surface the returning near-infrared radiation is<br>
detected from are different and separated by a defined distance and their selection is<br>
designed to enable targeting of a tissue volume conducive to measurement of the<br>
property of interest. The patient interface module may include an elbow rest, a wrist<br>
rest, and/or a guide to assist in interfacing the illumination mechanism of choice and<br>
the tissue of interest. Generally, an optical coupling fluid is placed between the<br>
illumination mechanism and the tissue of interest to minimize specular reflectance<br>
from the surface of the skin.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the sensor 700, shown in Figure 7, is a spectroscopic<br>
measurement system that includes a tungsten halogen near-infrared radiation<br>
source, a wavelength selection filter 702 passing 1100 to 1900 nm light, fiber optics<br>
703 for conveying the source photons to an in-vivo skin sample, an interface 704 to<br>
the forearm of a patient, fiber optic collection optics 705 for gathering diffusely<br>
reflected and transflected radiation from the skin to a grating, and an InGaAs array<br>
706 to detect the radiation, electronic means 707 for converting the resulting signal<br>
into a glucose concentration and a display (not shown). D. Klonoff, Noninvasive<br>
blood glucose monitoring, Diabetes Care, 20:3:433 (March, 1997).<br><br>
The sample site constitutes the point or area on the subject's body surface the<br>
measurement probe contacts and the specific tissue irradiated by the spectrometer<br>
system. Ideal qualifies for a sample site include: 1) homogeneity, 2) immutability;<br>
and 3) accessibility to the target analyte. Noninvasive glucose analyzers commonly<br>
use the fingertip as a sampling site. However, several alternative sampling sites are<br>
possible, including the abdomen, upper arm, thigh, hand (palm or back of the hand)<br>
or ear lobe, in the preferred embodiment, the volar part of the forearm is used. In<br>
addition, while the measurement can be made in either diffuse reflectance or diffuse<br>
transmittance mode, the preferred method is diffuse reflectance. Scanning of the<br>
tissue can be done continuously when the tissue area being tested is not affected by<br>
pulsation effects, or the scanning can be done intermittently between pulses.<br>
The collected signal (near-infrared radiation in this case) is converted to a voltage<br>
and sampled through an analog-to-digital converter for analysis on a microprocessor<br>
based system and the result displayed.<br>
Implantable:<br>
In an alternate arrangement, the system or a portion of the system is implanted, and<br>
the measurement is made directly on soft tissue, muscle, a blood vessel or skin<br>
tissue within the body. In this configuration, the measurement is made in a manner<br>
that is non-invasive to the probed tissue although the system or a portion of the<br>
system is implanted within the body. For example, the peritoneal cavity is a suitable<br>
location for implantation and both the probing signal source and detection system<br>
are implanted. In the preferred embodiment, telemetry is employed to transfer data<br>
or actual analyte readings to a remote location outside the body. Alternately, a<br><br><br>
transcutaneous connector is employed. After transfer, the data or concentration are<br>
then processed and displayed to the user or heath care provider. Three different<br>
embodiments of the implanted system are disclosed. The first, a consumer version,<br>
is used for incremental or continuous applications requiring intensive analysis of<br>
body analytes (e.g., glucose). A particularly useful application is nocturnal<br>
monitoring of glucose and detection or prediction of hypoglycemic events. In the<br>
second, the system is employed in a health care facility and the analyte is monitored<br>
via a computer or health care provider. A third embodiment of the implanted system<br>
is for use in a closed-loop insulin delivery system. In this embodiment the system is<br>
a sub-component of an artificial pancreas and used to monitor glucose levels for<br>
insulin dosage determination via an insulin pump.<br>
In implantable embodiments, an alternative invasive or noninvasive reference<br>
glucose concentration or set of concentrations may be utilized with paired<br>
implantable signals in order to calibrate an implantable glucose analyzer. This is<br>
essentially the same as utilizing an alternative invasive glucose analyzer to calibrate<br>
a noninvasive glucose analyzer as discussed above. Utilization of an alternative<br>
invasive or noninvasive reference is beneficial in instances when the implantable<br>
glucose analyzer is sampling fluids or tissues that have perfusion similar to that of<br>
the alternative invasive sites. For example, a semi-implantable device may be<br>
placed into the subcutaneous tissue or an implantable device may be placed into the<br>
peritoneal cavity. Both of these regions may have dampened and lagged glucose<br>
concentrations that are similar to alternative invasive glucose determinations or<br>
noninvasive glucose determinations from regions that are not well perfused. Hence,<br><br><br>
the reference values will more closely represent the implantable signals. This will aid<br>
in calibration design and maintenance as above.<br>
CORRECTION OF ALTERNATIVE INVASIVE TO TRADITIONAL INVASIVE<br>
GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION<br>
In building a glucose calibration model, a number of measurement parameters must<br>
be considered. The selection of measurement parameters will greatly affect<br>
predicted glucose concentrations from subsequent spectra. For example, for<br>
glucose determination based on near-IR spectral measurements, parameters include<br>
sample selection, preprocessing step selection, and actual model parameters such<br>
as the number of factors in a multivariate model. In view of the demonstrated<br>
difference in glucose concentration between traditional and alternative<br>
measurements, selection of the appropriate set of glucose reference concentrations<br>
is also important.<br>
For example, a model may be based on a calibration set that utilizes alternative<br>
invasive forearm glucose concentrations from the dorsal aspect of the forearm and<br>
near-IR noninvasive glucose determinations from the forearm. By using such a<br>
model to predict glucose concentrations from subsequent spectra, the subsequent<br>
measurements for a large number of subjects will correspond to the values of the<br>
calibration set more closely than if the calibration set were based on traditional<br>
invasive glucose determinations from a fingertip. The importance of parameter<br>
selection is described in greater detail below. Furthermore, a method for correcting<br>
measurements based on a calibration set of traditional invasive glucose<br><br><br>
determinations to approximate those based on a set of alternative invasive<br>
determinations is provided.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A single calibration model was applied to 4,980 noninvasive spectra collected from<br>
the volar.aspect of the forearm of twenty-six subjects covering 233 unique visits<br>
utilizing nine instruments collected over a period of eight months. Each subject was<br>
tested every fifteen minutes for a period of approximately eight hours. The resulting<br>
glucose predictions were compared to both traditional invasive reference fingertip<br>
and alternative invasive reference forearm glucose concentrations.<br>
A concentration correlation plot of the predicted glucose concentrations versus the<br>
forearm reference glucose concentrations is presented in Figure 8. A Clarke error<br>
grid analysis for this data demonstrates that 81.9 and 17.9 percent of the data falls<br>
into the A and B region, respectively. Thus, 99.8 percent of the data are predicted<br>
clinically accurately versus the alternative invasive reference forearm glucose<br>
concentrations. However, as shown in Figure 9, accuracy diminishes when plotted<br>
against the corresponding traditional invasive reference fingertip glucose<br>
concentrations. Clarke error grid analysis still results in 96.9% of the data in the 'A'<br>
or 'B' regions; however, only 51.5% fall into the 'A' region. The correction<br>
methodology follows:<br>
For each subject, lag of the predicted glucose concentration versus reference<br>
glucose concentrations for both fingertip and forearm determination is<br><br><br>
calculated. In order to account for the difference between the predicted<br>
values and the reference, a phase correction is calculated using a cross-<br>
covariance based algorithm by sliding the x-axis (time vector) of the predicted<br>
values a fixed amount to synchronize the predicted and reference values. A<br>
histogram of the resultant lags is presented in Figure 10. Lags for the forearm<br>
are observed to range up to sixty-two minutes. The peak of the lag for the<br>
comparison against the forearm and the fingertip is approximately ten and<br>
33.6 minutes, respectively. This indicates that the model substantially tracks<br>
the forearm glucose concentrations better than glucose concentrations from<br>
the fingertip, a result of the model being built with forearm glucose<br>
concentrations.<br>
For each subject, a magnitude correction is calculated comparing the<br>
predicted glucose concentrations to each of the fingertip and forearm glucose<br>
concentration reference profiles. The magnitude correction constitutes the<br>
difference between the glucose concentration ranges of the predicted and<br>
reference values. It is observed that the average difference between the<br>
predicted and reference glucose concentrations is less for the forearm<br>
reference glucose determinations than it is for the fingertip reference glucose<br>
determinations. A ratio of the range of the predicted values versus the range<br>
of the reference values is calculated for each subject's visit. A histogram of<br>
the resulting ratios representative of the magnitude difference is presented in<br>
Figure 11. The histogram demonstrates ratios closer to one for the forearm<br>
glucose concentration range with peak values for the forearm and fingertip of<br>
0.71 and 0.55, respectively.<br><br><br>
A third parameter not utilized in this particular model is a correction of the<br>
frequency of glucose profile versus time. Thus, the rate of glucose increase<br>
to a peak value and the rate of a subsequent decline may differ for traditional<br>
invasive glucose determinations and alternative invasive glucose<br>
determinations, and this profile shape difference or period may be corrected.<br>
It is here noted that specific examples of parameter calculations are presented, but<br>
that those skilled in the art will immediately appreciate that the lag, dampening, and<br>
frequency parameters and similar parameters utilized to characterize population<br>
differences may be calculated in a number of ways, any of which are consistent with<br>
the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, phase correction may be<br>
performed with techniques such as a Bessel filter, warping of the time axis and re-<br>
sampling, development of a wavelet-based model and subsequent time<br>
compression, or shifting. Similarly, magnitude correction may be performed with a<br>
simple multiplication factor after centering the data to either the mean or single data<br>
point, a multiplication factor dependent upon the rate of change, a multiplication<br>
factor dependent upon time, a multiplication factor dependent upon the tissue state,<br>
or a multiplication factor dependent upon the type of diabetes or class of tissue.<br>
Additionally, it is noted that incomplete vectors may still be utilized to determine<br>
these or similar parameters.<br>
A multi-step correction method may then be implemented utilizing one or more of<br>
these parameters. In one example, a shift correction is followed by a magnitude<br>
correction. First, the mean shift value of 33.6 minutes is subtracted from the<br><br><br>
prediction time vector. Second, a magnitude correction is performed, initially, the<br>
shift corrected data is mean centered. Then, the resulting glucose concentrations<br>
are divided by 0.55. Finally, the mean of the shift corrected data is added to the<br>
resulting vector of data.<br>
The two-step correction with parameters of a shift adjustment of 33.6 minutes and a<br>
scaling factor of 0.55 produced above is here applied to a set of 7 daily visits from a<br>
total of 3 subjects representing noninvasive spectra collected from 3 near-IR glucose<br>
analyzers. The fingertip reference glucose concentrations and noninvasively<br>
predicted glucose concentration profiles are presented in Figure 12. The<br>
noninvasive glucose concentrations predicted from spectra collected from the<br>
forearm are clearly damped and lagged versus the corresponding traditional invasive<br>
glucose determinations. The corresponding concentration correlation plot overlaid<br>
with a Clarke error grid is presented in Figure 13. The algorithm corrected glucose<br>
profiles and corresponding concentration correlation plot is presented in Figures 14<br>
and 15, respectively. Notably, the lag and dampening have been greatly reduced.<br>
The respective statistics for the uncorrected and corrected glucose concentrations<br>
reveal an obvious improvement in accuracy. The statistics for the uncorrected and<br>
corrected glucose concentrations are Clarke 'A' region: 49.7 and 80.5%; r: 0.78 and<br>
0.96, F-value: 2.38 and 10.9, standard error 54.4 and 26.0 mg/dL, respectively.<br>
The two-step correction demonstrated above was applied to the entire data set. The<br>
corrected predicted fingertip glucose concentrations are presented in a concentration<br>
correlation plot superimposed onto a Clarke error grid, Figure 16. The corrected<br>
glucose concentrations result in 97.8% of the points falling into the 'A' or 'B' region of<br><br><br>
the Clarke error grid. The correlation coefficient, F-Value, and r value each showed<br>
a corresponding increase. In addition, the algorithm allows conversion back and<br>
forth between forearm and fingertip glucose concentrations.<br>
While the preceding description has been directed primarily to calibration sets that<br>
include invasive reference measurements, embodiments of the invention are<br>
possible, that employ noninvasive reference measurements. The above data<br>
emphasize the importance of taking reference measurements at a site having<br>
perfusion equivalence to the sampling site. Accordingly, the principles previously<br>
discussed are equally applicable to calibrations developed using noninvasive<br>
reference measurements, rather than invasive reference measurements.<br>
INTEGRATED GLUCOSE ANALYZER<br>
An integrated glucose analyzer 1700 that utilizes alternative invasive or traditional<br>
invasive glucose determinations in combination with noninvasive measurements is<br>
shown in Figure 17.<br>
The invention includes a first component 1701 that measures an analytical signal<br>
from the body to determine the body's glucose concentration. Numerous<br>
noninvasive devices have been described above. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, a near-infrared spectrometer configured for a noninvasive diffuse<br>
reflectance measurement from the forearm may be utilized. The first component<br>
1701 includes a control and processing element 1703 for executing computer-<br><br><br>
readable instructions and at least one storage element 1704, such as a memory,<br>
having executable program code embodied therein for converting a series of<br>
reflected near-IR signals, collected from the forearm or other tissue site, into a<br>
corresponding series of blood glucose values.<br>
A second component 1702, that provides either a traditional invasive or alternative<br>
glucose measurement, is electronically coupled 1706a and b to the first component.<br>
Preferably, the second component provides measurements having five percent error<br>
or less.<br>
The above program code also includes code for:<br>
•	extracting the data from the traditional second component 1702;<br>
•	storing the invasive blood glucose values extracted from the second<br>
component 1702 in the storage element 1704 of the first component 1701;<br>
and<br>
•	using the stored invasive blood glucose values for calibration, calibration<br>
assignment, validation, quality assurance procedures, quality control<br>
procedures, adjustment, and/or bias correction, depending on the current<br>
mode of operation.<br>
For example, in the case of calibration, finger stick-based blood glucose values<br>
are collected concurrently with noninvasive spectra to form a calibration set of<br>
paired data points. The set is used to calculate a mathematical model suitable<br>
for determination of blood glucose on the basis of a noninvasive measurement,<br>
such as a spectrum. As a second example, in the case of bias adjustment,<br><br><br>
invasive blood glucose determinations are collected with the first noninvasive<br>
glucose determination of the day and utilized to adjust the noninvasive glucose<br>
concentration to the reference glucose determination. The adjustment parameter<br>
is utilized until a new invasive reference glucose determination is collected.<br>
The above program code also includes code for:<br>
• prpviding a comparison and evaluation of the finger stick blood glucose value<br>
to the blood glucose value obtained from the noninvasive near-infrared diffuse<br>
reflectance measurement.<br>
In one embodiment, information is communicated to the first component 1701 from<br>
the second component 1702. Alternatively, the second component 1702 may<br>
containing processing and storage elements, instead of the first component.<br>
Noninvasive glucose measurements are configured to operate in modes<br>
(transmission, diffuse reflectance, and transflectance) as described above on body<br>
parts as described above.<br>
Finally, although the preferred embodiment employs fingerstick measurements, any<br>
measurement having sufficient accuracy and precision can be used as the reference<br>
measurement.<br>
There is a pronounced disadvantage to conventional systems, in which a primary<br>
device and a secondary device are separate and distinct from each other.<br>
Secondary measurements must be compared to primary measurements, in order to<br>
validate the secondary measurements. Conventionally, comparison requires the<br><br><br>
consumer to manually input a blood glucose value from the primary device<br>
(traditional or alternative invasive glucose analyzer) into the secondary device<br>
(noninvasive or implantable glucose analyze) for comparison. An inherent risk to<br>
such an approach is the improper input of the primary glucose value into the<br>
secondary device, thus resulting in an invalid comparison.<br>
Advantageously, the integrated glucose analyzer eliminates the necessity for the<br>
patient to manually input an invasive measurement for comparison with the<br>
noninvasive measurement. A second advantage is the ability to utilize a single case<br>
for both components with a similar power supply and display. This results in fewer<br>
elements that a person with diabetes need carry with them. An additional advantage<br>
is a backup glucose analyzer in the event of the noninvasive glucose analyzer failing<br>
to produce a glucose value as may be the case with very high or hypoglycemic<br>
glucose concentrations. A third advantage is traeeability. The time difference<br>
between a reference glucose determination from an invasive meter and a<br>
corresponding noninvasive glucose reading may be critical in establishing a<br>
correction to an algorithm such as a bias. An automated transfer of the glucose<br>
value and the associated time greatly reduces risks in usage of a noninvasive<br>
analyzer that requires such a correction. Finally, the transfer of glucose and time<br>
information into the noninvasive analyzer digital storage means eases subsequent<br>
analysis and data management by the individual or a professional.<br>
This technology may be implemented in healthcare facilities including, but not limited<br>
to: physician offices, hospitals, clinics, and long-term healthcare facilities. In<br>
addition, this technology would be implemented for home-use by consumers who<br><br><br>
desire to monitor their blood glucose levels whether they suffer from diabetes,<br>
impaired glucose tolerance, impaired insulin response, or are healthy individuals.<br>
Additionally, an embodiment is possible in which the first and second components<br>
are separate analyzers, the first component configured to measure glucose<br>
noninvasively, and the second component configured to perform either alternate<br>
invasive or traditional invasive measurements. In the current embodiment, first and<br>
second components are electronically coupled by means of a communication<br>
interface, such as RS232 or USB (universal serial bus). Other commonly-known<br>
methods of interfacing electrical components would also be suitable for the<br>
invention,, such as telemetry, infrared signals, radiowave, or other wireless<br>
technologies. Either embodiment provides the above advantages of eliminating the<br>
possibility of invalid measurements by doing away with the necessity of manual data<br>
entry.<br>
Although the invention has been described herein with reference to certain preferred<br>
embodiments, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other applications may<br>
be substituted for those set forth herein without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
the present invention. Accordingly, the invention should only be limited by the claims<br>

as a glucose monitor, and a communication interface (1706a); said first and<br>
second components electromagnetically coupled through a comunication link;<br>
and, means for using said reference measurement to optimize calibration of said<br>
apparatus in a calibration model comprising: a computer program means for<br>
optimizing said calibration, said program means embodied in said memory<br>
means; and a processing element configured to execute said program means,<br>
wherein said first component is adapted to collect non-invasive signals at an<br>
alternative sample site on a body located at a region other than body's fingure<br>
tips and toes, wherein said second component is adapted to make invasive<br>
measurements at a time corresponding to each of said one or more non-invasive<br>
signals from the first component, wherein said calibration model is adapted to<br>
control sample site disparity error in calibration of said non-invasive<br>
measurement using paired data points for analyte analysis at alternative sample<br>
site with substantially identical tissue matrix so that the discrepancy between<br>
analyte concentration at said alternative sample site and said alternative<br>
reference measurement site is reduced or eliminated.</td>
