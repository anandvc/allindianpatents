				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a super-conductive coil in a synchronous<br>
rotating machine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a support<br>
structure for super-conducting field windings in the rotor of a synchronous machine.<br>
Synchronous electrical machines having field coil windings include, but are not<br>
limited to, rotary generators, rotary motors, and linear motors. These machines<br>
generally comprise a stator and rotor that are electromagnetically coupled. The rotor<br>
may include a multi-pole rotor core and one or more coil windings mounted on the<br>
rotor core. The rotor cores may include a magnetically-permeable solid material, such<br>
as an iron-core rotor.<br>
Conventional copper windings are commonly used in the rotors of synchronous<br>
electrical machines. However, the electrical resistance of copper windings (although<br>
low by conventional measures) is sufficient to contribute to substantial heating of the<br>
rotor and to diminish the power efficiency of the machine. Recently, super-<br>
conducting (SC) coil windings have been developed for rotors. SC windings have<br>
effectively no resistance and are highly advantageous rotor coil windings.<br>
Iron-core rotors saturate at an air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
Known super-conductive rotors employ air-core designs, with no iron in the rotor, to<br>
achieve air-gap magnetic fields of 3 Tesla or higher. These high air-gap magnetic<br>
fields yield increased power densities of the electrical machine, and result in<br>
significant reduction in weight and size of the machine. Air-core super-conductive<br>
rotors require large amounts of super-conducting wire. The large amounts of SC wire<br>
add to the number of coils required, the complexity of the coil supports, and the cost<br>
High temperature SC coil field windings are formed of super-conducting materials<br>
that are brittle, and must be cooled to a temperature at or below a critical temperature,<br>
e.g., 27°K, to achieve and maintain super-conductivity. The SC windings may be<br>
formed of a high temperature super-conducting material, such as a BSCCO<br>
(BixSrxCaxCuxOx) based conductor.<br>
Super-conducting coils have been cooled by liquid helium. After passing through the<br>
windings of the rotor, the hot, used helium is returned as room-temperature gaseous<br>
helium. Using liquid helium for cryogenic cooling requires continuous reliquefaction<br>
of the returned, room-temperature gaseous helium, and such reliquefaction poses<br>
significant reliability problems and requires significant auxiliary power.<br>
Prior SC coil cooling techniques include cooling an epoxy-impregnated SC coil<br>
through a solid conduction path from a cryocooler. Alternatively, cooling tubes in the<br>
rotor may convey a liquid and/or gaseous cryogen to a porous SC coil winding that is<br>
immersed in the flow of the liquid and/or gaseous cryogen. However, immersion<br>
cooling requires the entire field winding and rotor structure to be at cryogenic<br>
temperature. As a result, no iron can be used in the rotor magnetic circuit because of<br>
the brittle nature of iron at cryogenic temperatures.<br>
What is needed is a super-conducting field winding assemblage for an electrical<br>
machine that does not have the disadvantages of the air-core and liquid-cooled super-<br>
conducting field winding assemblages of. for example, known super-conductive<br>
rotors.<br>
In addition, high temperature super-conducting (HTS) coils are sensitive to<br>
degradation from high bending and tensile strains. These coils must undergo<br>
substantial centrifugal forces that stress and strain the coil windings. Normal<br>
operation of electrical machines involves thousands of start-up and shut-down cycles<br>
over the course of several years that result in low cycle fatigue loading of the rotor.<br>
Furthermore, the HTS rotor winding should be capable of withstanding 25% over-<br>
speed operation during rotor balancing procedures at ambient temperature, and<br>
notwithstanding occasional over-speed conditions at cryogenic temperatures during<br>
power generation operation. These over-speed conditions substantially increase the<br>
centrifugal force loading on the windings over normal operating conditions.<br>
SC coils used as the HTS rotor field winding of an electrical machine are subjected to<br>
stresses and strains during cool-down and normal operation. They are subjected to<br>
centrifugal loading, torque transmission, and transient fault conditions. To withstand<br>
the forces, stresses, strains and cyclical loading, the SC coils should be properly<br>
supported in the rotor by a coil support system. These support systems hold the SC<br>
coil(s) in the HTS rotor and secure the coils against the tremendous centrifugal forces<br>
due to the rotation of the rotor. Moreover, the coil support system protects the SC<br>
coils, and ensures that the coils do not prematurely crack, fatigue or otherwise break.<br>
Developing support systems for HTS coil has been a difficult challenge in adapting<br>
SC coils to HTS rotors. Examples of coil support systems for HTS rotors that have<br>
previously been proposed are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,548,168; 5,532,663;<br>
5,672,921; 5,777,420; 6,169,353, and 6,066,906. However, these coil support<br>
systems suffer various problems, such as being expensive, complex and requiring an<br>
excessive number of components. There is a long-felt need for a HTS rotor having a<br>
coil support system for a SC coil. The need also exists for a coil support system made<br>
with low cost and easy-to-fabricate components.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A coil support structure having tension rods and U-shaped channel housings is<br>
disclosed for mounting SC coils inside the vacuum space of a HTS rotor The tension<br>
rods span opposite sides of a coil. Channel housings are attached to both ends of the<br>
tension rod and wrap around a side portion of the coil. The coil is supported by the<br>
tension rods and channel housings with respect to centrifugal and other forces that act<br>
on the coil.<br>
The HTS rotor may be for a synchronous machine originally designed to include SC<br>
coils. Alternatively, the HTS rotor may replace a copper coil rotor in an existing<br>
electrical machine, such as in a conventional generator. The rotor and its SC coils are<br>
described here in the context of a generator, but the HTS coil rotor is also suitable for<br>
use in other synchronous machines.<br>
The coil support system is useful in integrating the coil support system with the coil<br>
and rotor. In addition, the coil support system facilitates easy pre-assembly of the coil<br>
support system, coil and rotor core prior to final rotor assembly. Pre-assembly<br>
reduces coil and rotor assembly time, improves coil support quality, and reduces coil<br>
assembly variations.<br>
In a first embodiment, the invention is a rotor comprising a rotor core and a super-<br>
conducting (SC) racetrack coil winding. A coil support system comprises tension<br>
rods that span between the coil winding and channel housings that secure the coil<br>
winding to both ends of each tension rod.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is a rotor for a synchronous machine<br>
comprising: a rotor with internal vacuum; a super-conducting coil winding extending<br>
around at least a portion of the rotor, the coil winding having a pair of side sections on<br>
opposite sides of the rotor, at least one tension rod extending between the pair of side<br>
sections of the coil winding and through conduits in the rotor; and a coil housing at<br>
each of opposite ends of the tension rod, wherein the coil housing wraps around the<br>
coil winding and is attached to the tension rod.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method for supporting a super-conducting<br>
coil in the rotor of a synchronous machine comprising the steps of: extending a<br>
tension bar through a conduit in the rotor; inserting a bracket housing over a portion<br>
of the coil; and attaching an end of the tension bar to the bracket housing.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is a rotor for a synchronous machine<br>
comprising: a rotor core having a conduit orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
rotor core and parallel to a plane defined by the HTS coil; a super-conducting (SC)<br>
coil in a planar racetrack shape parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rotor core; a<br>
tension rod fitting inside the conduit aperture; and a coil housing for minimizing the<br>
bending strains, tensile strains, or bending and tensile strains on the HTS coil.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 shows an exemplary synchronous generator machine 10 having a stator 12<br>
and a rotor 14. The rotor includes field winding coils that tit inside the cylindrical<br>
rotor vacuum cavity 16 of the stator. The rotor tits inside the rotor vacuum cavity of<br>
the stator. As the rotor turns within the stator, a magnetic field 18 (illustrated by<br>
dotted lines) generated by the rotor and rotor coils moves/rotates through the stator<br>
and creates an electrical current in the windings of the stator coils 19. This current is<br>
output by the generator as electrical power.<br>
The rotor 14 has a generally longitudinally-extending axis 20 and a generally solid<br>
rotor core 22. The solid core 22 has high magnetic permeability, and is usually made<br>
of a ferromagnetic material, such as iron. In a low power density super-conducting<br>
machine, the iron core of the rotor is used to reduce the magnetomotive force (MMF),<br>
and, thus, minimize the amount of super-conducting (SC) coil wire needed for the coil<br>
winding. For example, the solid iron rotor core may be magnetically saturated at an<br>
air-gap magnetic field strength of about 2 Tesla.<br>
The rotor 14 supports at least one longitudinally-extending, racetrack-shaped, high-<br>
temperature super-conducting (HTS) coil winding 34 (See Fig. 2). The HTS coil<br>
winding may be alternatively a saddle-shape or have some other shape that is suitable<br>
for a particular HTS rotor design. A coil support system is disclosed here for a<br>
racetrack SC coil winding. The coil support system may be adapted for coil<br>
configurations other than a racetrack coil mounted on a solid rotor core.<br>
The rotor includes a collector shaft 24 and a drive end shaft 30 that bracket the rotor<br>
core 22, are supported by bearings 25. The end shafts may be coupled to external<br>
devices. For example, rhe end collector shaft 24 has a cryogen transfer coupling 26 to<br>
a source of cryogenic cooling fluid used to cool the SC coil windings in the rotor.<br>
The cryogen transfer coupling 26 includes a stationary segment coupled to a source of<br>
cryogen cooling fluid and a rotating segment which provides cooling fluid to the HTS<br>
coil. The collector end shaft 24 also includes a collector 78 for electrically connecting<br>
to the rotating SC coil winding. The drive end shaft 30 of the rotor may be driven by<br>
a power turbine coupling 32.<br>
FIGURE 2 shows an exemplary HTS racetrack field coil winding 34. The SC field<br>
winding coils 34 of the rotor includes a high temperature super-conducting (SC) coil<br>
36. Each SC coil includes a high temperature super-conducting conductor, such as a<br>
BSCCO (BixSrxCaxCuxOx) conductor wires laminated in a solid epoxy impregnated<br>
winding composite. For example, a series of BSCCO 2223 wires may be laminated,<br>
bonded together and wound into a solid epoxy impregnated coil.<br>
SC wire is brittle and easy to be damaged. The SC coil is typically layer wound SC<br>
tape that is epoxy impregnated. The SC tape is wrapped in a precision coil form to<br>
attain close dimensional tolerances. The tape is wound around in a helix to form the<br>
racetrack SC coil 36.<br>
The dimensions of the racetrack coil are dependent on the dimensions of the rotor<br>
core. Generally, each racetrack SC coil encircles the magnetic poles of the rotor core,<br>
and is parallel to the rotor axis. The coil windings are continuous around the<br>
racetrack. The SC coils form a resistance-free electrical current path around the rotor<br>
core and between the magnetic poles of the core. The coil has electrical contacts 114<br>
that electrically connect the coil to the collector 78.<br>
Fluid passages 38 for cryogenic cooling fluid are included in the coil winding 34.<br>
These passages may extend around an outside edge of the SC coil 36. The<br>
passageways provide cryogenic cooling fluid to the coil and remove heat from the<br>
coil. The cooling fluid maintains the low temperatures, e.g., 27°K, in the SC coil<br>
winding needed to promote super-conducting conditions, including the absence of<br>
electrical resistance in the coil. The cooling passages have an input and output fluid<br>
provides lateral stiffness to the coils which provides rotor dynamics benefits.<br>
Moreover, the lateral stiffness permits integrating the coil support with the coils so<br>
that the coil can be assembled with the coil support prior to final rotor assembly. Pre-<br>
assembly of the coil and coil support reduces production cycle, improves coil support<br>
quality, and reduces coil assembly variations. The racetrack coil is supported by an<br>
array of tension members that span the long sides of the coil. The tension rod coil<br>
support members are pre-assembled to coil.<br>
The HTS coil winding and structural support components are at cryogenic<br>
temperature. In contrast, the rotor core is at ambient "hot" temperature. The coil<br>
supports are potential sources of thermal conduction that would allow heat to reach<br>
the HTS coils from the rotor core. The rotor becomes hot during operation. As the<br>
coils are to be held in super-cooled conditions, heat conduction into the coils is to be<br>
avoided. The rods extend through apertures, e.g., conduits, in the rotor but are not in<br>
contact with the rotor. This lack of contact avoids the conduction of heat from the<br>
rotor to the tension rods and coils.<br>
To reduce the heat leaking away from the coil, the coil support is minimized to reduce<br>
the thermal conduction through support from heat sources such as the rotor core.<br>
There are generally two categories of support for super-conducting winding: (i)<br>
provides lateral stiffness to the coils which provides rotor dynamics benefits.<br>
Moreover, the lateral stiffness permits integrating the coil support with the coils so<br>
that the coil can be assembled with the coil support prior to final rotor assembly. Pre-<br>
assembly of the coil and coil support reduces production cycle, improves coil support<br>
quality, and reduces coil assembly variations. The racetrack coil is supported by an<br>
array of tension members that span the long sides of the coil. The tension rod coil<br>
support members are pre-assembled to coil.<br>
The HTS coil winding and structural support components are at cryogenic<br>
temperature. In contrast, the rotor core is at ambient "hot" temperature. The coil<br>
supports are potential sources of thermal conduction that would allow heat to reach<br>
the HTS coils from the rotor core. The rotor becomes hot during operation. As the<br>
coils are to be held in super-cooled conditions, heat conduction into the coils is to be<br>
avoided. The rods extend through apertures, e.g., conduits, in the rotor but are not in<br>
contact with the rotor. This lack of contact avoid the conduction of heat from the<br>
rotor to the tension rods and coils.<br>
To reduce the heat leaking away from the coil, the coil support is minimized to reduce<br>
the thermal conduction through support from heat sources such as the rotor core.<br>
There are generally two categories of support for super-conducting winding: (i)<br>
"warm" supports and (ii) "cold" supports. In a warm support, the supporting<br>
structures are thermally isolated from the cooled SC windings. With warm supports,<br>
most of the mechanical load of a super-conductmg (SC) coil is supported by structural<br>
members spanning from cold to warm members.<br>
In a cold support system, the support system is at or near the cold cryogenic<br>
temperature of the SC coils. In cold supports, most of the mechanical load of a SC<br>
coil is supported by structural members which are at or near a cryogenic temperature.<br>
The exemplary coil support system disclosed here is a cold support in that the tension<br>
rods and associated housings that couple the tension rods to the SC coil windings are<br>
maintained at or near a cryogenic temperature. Because the supporting members are<br>
cold, these members are thermally isolated, e.g., by the non-conduits through<br>
the rotor core, from other "hot" components of the rotor.<br>
An individual support member consists of a tension rod 42 (which may be a bar and a<br>
pair of bolts at either end of the bar), a channel housing 44, and a dowel pin 80 that<br>
connects the housing to the end of the tension rod. Each channel housing 44 is a U-<br>
shaped bracket having legs that connect to a tension rod and a channel to receive the<br>
coil winding 34. The U-shaped channel housing allows for the precise and convenient<br>
assembly of the support system for the coil. A series of channel housings may be<br>
positioned end-to-end along the side of the coil winding. The channel housings<br>
collectively distribute the forces that act on the coil, e.g., centrifugal forces, over<br>
substantially the entire side sections 40 of each coil.<br>
The channel housings 44 prevent the side sections 40 of the coils from excessive<br>
flexing and bending due to centrifugal forces. The coil supports do not restrict the<br>
coils from longitudinal thermal expansion and contraction that occur during normal<br>
start/stop operation of the gas turbine. In particular, thermal expansion is primarily<br>
directed along the length of the side sections. Thus, the side sections of the coil slide<br>
slightly longitudinally with respect to the channel housing and tension rods.<br>
The transfer of the centrifugal load from the coil structure to a support rod is through<br>
the channel housing that fits around the coil outside surface and side straight sections,<br>
and is doweled by pins 80 to a wide diameter end of the tension rod. The U-shaped<br>
channel housings are formed of a light, high strength material that is ductile at<br>
cryogenic temperatures. Typical materials for channel housing are aluminum,<br>
Inconel, or titanium alloys, which are non-magnetic. The shape of the U-shaped<br>
housing may be optimized for low weight and strength.<br>
The dowel pin 80 extends through apertures in the channel housing and tension rod.<br>
The dowel may be hollow for low weight. Locking nuts (not shown) are threaded or<br>
attached at the ends of the dowel pin to secure the U-shaped housing and prevent the<br>
sides of the housing from spreading apart under load. The dowel pin can be made of<br>
high strength lnconel or titanium alloys. The tension rods are made with larger<br>
diameter ends 82 that are machined with two flats 86 at their ends to fit the U-shaped<br>
housing and coil width. The flat ends 86 of the tension rods abut the inside surface of<br>
the HTS coils, when the rod, coil and housing are assembled together. This assembly<br>
reduces the stress concentration at the hole in the tension rod that receives the dowel.<br>
The coil support system of tension rods 42, channel housings 44 and split-clamp 58<br>
may be assembled with the HTS coil windings 34 as both are mounted on the rotor<br>
core 22. The tension rods, channel housings and clamp provide a fairly rigid structure<br>
for supporting the coil windings and holding the coil windings in place with respect to<br>
the rotor core.<br>
Each tension rod 42 extends through the rotor core, and may extend orthogonally<br>
through the axis 20 of the rotor. Conduits 46 through the rotor core provide a passage<br>
through which extend the tension rods. The diameter of the conduits is sufficiently<br>
large to avoid having the hot rotor walls of the conduits be in contact with the cold<br>
tension rods. The avoidance of contact improves the thermal isolation between the<br>
tension rods and the rotor core.<br>
The rotor core 22 is typically made of magnetic material such as iron, while the rotor<br>
end shafts are typically made of non-magnetic material such as stainless steel. The<br>
rotor core and end shafts are typically discrete components that are assembled and<br>
securely joined together by either bolting or welding.<br>
The iron rotor core 22 has a generally cylindrical shape suitable for rotation within the<br>
rotor cavity 16 of the stator 12. To receive the coil winding, the rotor core has<br>
recessed surfaces 48, such as flat or triangular regions or slots. These surfaces 48 are<br>
formed in the curved surface 50 of the cylindrical core and extending longitudinally<br>
across the rotor core. The coil winding 34 is mounted on the rotor adjacent the<br>
recessed areas 48. The coils generally extend longitudinally along an outer surface of<br>
the recessed area and around the ends of the rotor core. The recessed surfaces 48 of<br>
the rotor core receive the coil winding. The shape of the recessed area conforms to<br>
the coil winding. For example, if the coil winding has a saddle-shape or some other<br>
shape, the recess(es) in the rotor core would be configured to receive the shape of the<br>
winding.<br>
The recessed surfaces 48 receive the coil winding such that the outer surface of the<br>
coil winding extend to substantially an envelope defined by the rotation of the rotor.<br>
The outer curved surfaces 50 of the rotor core when rotated define a cylindrical<br>
envelope. This rotation envelope of the rotor has substantially the same diameter as<br>
the rotor cavity 16 (see Fig. 1) in the stator.<br>
The gap between the rotor envelope and stator cavity 16 is a relatively-small<br>
clearance, as required for forced flow ventilation cooling of the stator only, since the<br>
rotor requires no ventilation cooling. It is desirable to minimize the clearance<br>
between the rotor and stator so as to increase the electromagnetic coupling between<br>
the rotor coil windings and the stator windings. Moreover, the rotor coil winding is<br>
preferably positioned such that it extends to the envelope formed by the rotor and,<br>
thus, is separated from the stator by only the clearance gap between the rotor and<br>
stator.<br>
The end sections 54 of the coil winding 34 are adjacent opposite ends 56 of the rotor<br>
core. A split-clamp 58 holds each of the end sections of the coil windings in the rotor.<br>
The split clamp at each coil end 54 includes a pair of opposite plates 60 between<br>
which is sandwiched the coil winding 34. The surface of the clamp plates includes<br>
channels 116, 118 (Fig. 11) to receive the coil winding and connections 112, 114 to<br>
the winding.<br>
The split clamp 58 may be formed of a non-magnetic material, such as aluminum or<br>
lnconel alloys. The same or similar non-magnetic materials may be used to form the<br>
tension rods, channel housings and other portions of the coil support system. The coil<br>
support system is preferably non-magnetic so as to preserve ductility at cryogenic<br>
temperatures, since ferromagnetic materials become brittle at temperatures below the<br>
Curie transition temperature and cannot be used as load carrying structures.<br>
The split clamp 58 is surrounded by, but is not in contact with collar 62. There is a<br>
collar 62 at each end of the rotor core 22, although only one collar is shown in<br>
FIGURE 3. The collar is a thick disk of non-magnetic material, such as stainless<br>
steel, the same as or similar to the material, that forms the rotor shafts. Indeed, the<br>
collar is part of the rotor shaft. The collar has a slot 64 orthogonal to the rotor axis<br>
and sufficiently wide to receive and clear the split clamp 58. The hot sidewalls 66 of<br>
the slot collar are spaced apart from the cold split clamp so they do not come in<br>
contact with each other.<br>
The collar 62 may include a recessed disk area 68 (which is bisected by the slot 64) to<br>
receive a raised disk region 70 of the rotor core (see opposite side of rotor core for<br>
raised disk region to be inserted in opposite collar). The insertion of the raised disk<br>
region on the end 56 of the rotor core into the recessed disk 68 provides support to the<br>
rotor core in the collar, and assists in aligning the rotor core and collars. In addition,<br>
the collar may have a circular array of bolt holes 72 extending longitudinally through<br>
the collar and around the rim of the collar. These bolt holes correspond to matching<br>
threaded bolt holes 74 that extend partially through the rotor core. Threaded bolts 75<br>
(see Fig. 5) extend through these longitudinal bolt holes 72, 74 and secure the collars<br>
to the rotor core.<br>
FIGURE 4 is a first cross-sectional view of the rotor core and collar. FIGURE 5 is a<br>
second cross-sectional view of the rotor and collar that is orthogonal to the first view.<br>
The electrical and cooling fluid conduits are shielded by a thin walled tube 76 that<br>
extends along the rotor axis from one of the coil end sections 54 and through a collar<br>
62. The cooling conduits in the tube 76 connect to the input and output ports 112 of<br>
the cooling passage 38 on the coil winding to the cryogenic transfer coupling 26. An<br>
electrical coupling 114 to the coil is provided at same end section of the coil as the<br>
cooling coupling 26.<br>
The side sections 40 of the racetrack-shaped coil winding 34 are supported by the<br>
series of tension rods 42 that extend through the conduits 46 in the rotor core. The<br>
tension rods are non-magnetic, straight bars that extend between opposite side<br>
sections of the same coil, or between side sections of the two coils. The tension rod<br>
may be formed of a high strength non-magnetic alloys, such as Inconel X718. The<br>
tension rods have at each end a coupling with a channel housing 44 that wraps around<br>
and holds the side 40 of the coil winding. The channel housings 44 and the tension<br>
rods 42 may provide an adjustment of the tension applied to the side sections of the<br>
coil windings. For example, the tension rods may be formed of a tension bar that<br>
extends through the rotor core and has at each end a threaded opening to receive a<br>
tension bolt. The tension bolts may each have a flat iace 86 that abuts the coil<br>
winding.<br>
The coil winding 34 is supported by the tension rods 42 (only one of which is shown<br>
in FIG. 4) that span opposite side sections 40 of the coil. The channel housing 44 is<br>
connected by a dowel pin 80 to the end of the tension rod. For illustrative purposes,<br>
the left side of FIGURE 6 shows the tension rod without a channel housing.<br>
Similarly, the upper side of FIGURE 4 shows the tension rod 46 without a channel<br>
housing; whereas, the lower side shows a channel housing attached to the tension rod.<br>
Tension rods 42 extend through the conduits 46 in the rotor core 22. These conduits<br>
have increased diameters at their respective ends 88. These expanded ends 88 receive<br>
the insulator tube 52 which is formed as a sleeve on the tension rod. The insulator<br>
tubes thermally shield the tension rods 42 from the hot rotor core 22.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 5, the conduits 46 extend perpendicularly through the rotor axis<br>
and are symmetrically arranged along the length of the core. The number of conduits<br>
46 and their arrangement on the rotor core and with respect to each other is a matter<br>
of design choice.<br>
The rotor core may be encased in a metallic cylindrical shield 90 that protects the<br>
super-conducting coil winding 34 from eddy currents and other electrical currents that<br>
surround the rotor and provides the vacuum envelope as required to maintain a hard<br>
vacuum around the cryogenic components of the rotor. The cylindrical shield 90 may<br>
be formed of a highly-conductive material, such as a copper alloy or aluminum.<br>
The SC coil winding 34 is maintained in a vacuum. The vacuum may be formed by<br>
the shield 90 which may include a stainless steel cylindrical layer that forms a vacuum<br>
vessel around the coil and rotor core. The FIGURE 7 is a cross-sectional diagram<br>
taken perpendicular to the rotor axis and showing an enlarged portion of the rotor core<br>
22, tension rod 42, coil winding 34 and associated structures. The flat end 86 of the<br>
tension rod abuts an inside surface of the coil winding 34. The opposite end of the<br>
tension rod (not shown in Fig. 7) abuts a similar inside surface of the opposite side of<br>
the coil winding. Thus, the tension rod spans between the coil winding and provides a<br>
fixed surface 86 which supports the coil winding.<br>
Each tension rod 42, although typically cylindrical along its length, has flat ends 86,<br>
which permit close attachment to the coil winding and U-shaped channel housing 44.<br>
Each tension rod is connected to a channel housing 44 by a dowel pin 80. which<br>
prevents the housing from sliding radially outward from the tension rod. The channel<br>
housing prevents centrifugal force from bending or warping the coil while the rotor is<br>
rotating. Locking nuts (not shown) are threaded at the ends of the dowel pin 80 to<br>
secure the housing 44 side legs 106 from spreading apart under load. The dowel pin<br>
can be made from high strength Inconel or titanium alloys. Each tension rod 42 fits<br>
inside a non-contact conduit 46, such that the tension rod does not intentionally<br>
contact the rotor core. At the end of each tension rod, there may be an insulating tube<br>
52 that fastens the coil support structure to the hot rotor and reduces conduction heat<br>
transfer therebetween. Additionally, there may a lock-nut 84 threaded on tension rod<br>
42 that connects to the insulating tube 52, and is used to secure and adjust the position<br>
of rod 42 inside the conduit 46. The lock-nut 84 and the tube 52 secure the tension<br>
rod and channel housing to the rotor core while minimizing the heat transfer from the<br>
hot rotor to the housing structure.<br>
The insulator tube is formed of a thermal insulative material. One end of the tube<br>
may include an external ring 120 that abuts the wall of the conduit 88. The other end<br>
of the tube includes an internal ring 122 that engages the lock-nut 84 holding the<br>
tension rod. Heat from the rotor would have to conduct through the length of the<br>
insulator tube 52 and the lock nut 84 before reaching the tension rod. Thus, the<br>
insulator tube thermally isolates the tension rod from the rotor core.<br>
The coil winding is also supported by the channel housing 44 (see Fig. 8). The<br>
channel housing supports the coil winding against centrifugal forces (arrow 100 in<br>
Fig. 7) and tangential torque forces (arrow 102). The channel housing may be formed<br>
of non-magnetic metallic materials, such as aluminum, Inconel, and titanium alloys.<br>
The channel housing is held in place on the tension rod by dowel 80 that extends<br>
through an aperture 104 in the end of the tension rod. The legs 106 of the channel<br>
housing may be thick and have ribs to provide structural support around the apertures<br>
108 that receive the dowel. Centrifugal forces arise due to the rotation of the rotor.<br>
Tangential forces may arise from acceleration and deceleration of the rotor, as well as<br>
torque transmission. Because the sides 40 of the coil winding are encased by the<br>
channel housings 44 and the ends 86 of the tension bars, the sides of the coil winding<br>
are fully supported within the rotor.<br>
A support bracket 124 is provided to assist the tension rods and channel housing<br>
withstand the large radial forces that can result when a grid fault condition occurs.<br>
The radial support may be a rectangular box that fits around the sides 40 of the coil<br>
winding and extends over the split-clamp 58. The support bracket include a pair of<br>
side walls that are dovetailed into a slot in the recessed surface. The side-walls extend<br>
from the rotor core surface 48 to the shell 90 and provides structural strength to the<br>
shell.<br>
FIGURES 9 to 11 show schematically the assembly process for the coil support<br>
structure and coil winding in the rotor. As shown in FIGURE 9, before the rotor core<br>
is assembled with the collars and other components of the rotor, the tension rods 42<br>
are inserted into each of the conduits 46 that extend through the rotor core. The<br>
insulator tube 52 at each end of each tension rod is placed in the expanded end 88 at<br>
each end of the conduits 46. The tube 52 is locked in place by a retainer locking-nut<br>
84. When the tension rods are assembled in the rotor core 22, the coil windings are<br>
ready to be inserted onto the core.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 10, the SC coil 36 is inserted onto the rotor core such that the<br>
flat ends 86 of the tension rods 42 abut the inside surface of the side sections 40 of the<br>
SC coil. Once the winding has been inserted over the ends of the tension bar, the<br>
channel housings 44 are inserted over the SC coil. The channel housings are secured<br>
to the ends of the tension bars by inserting dowels 80 through the apertures in the<br>
tension rod and channel housing 104, 108, respectively.<br>
The channel housing 44 includes a slot 110 along its upper inside surface which<br>
receives the cooling conduit 38 and holds that conduit against the coil 36.<br>
The plurality of channel housings effectively hold the coil in place without affectation<br>
by centrifugal forces. Although the channel housings are shown as having a close<br>
proximity to one another, the housings need only be as close as necessary to prevent<br>
degradation of the coil caused by high bending and tensile strains during centrifugal<br>
loading, torque transmission, and transient fault conditions.<br>
The channel housings and tension rods may be assembled with the coil winding<br>
before the rotor core and coils are assembled with the collar and other components of<br>
the rotor. Accordingly, the rotor core, coil winding and coil support system can be<br>
assembled as a unit before assembly of the other components of the rotor and of the<br>
synchronous machine.<br>
FIGURE 11 shows the assembly of the split clamp 58 that is formed by clamp plates<br>
60. The clamp plates 60 sandwiched between them the end sections 64 of the coil<br>
winding. The split clamp provides structural support for the ends of the coil winding<br>
34. The plates 60 of the split clamp include on their inside surfaces channels 116 that<br>
receive the coil winding. Similarly, the plates include channels 118 for the<br>
input/output lines 112 for the gases and for the input and output current connections<br>
1 !4 to the coil. Once the coil supports, coil, collar and rotor core are assembled, this<br>
unit is ready to be assembled into the rotor and synchronous machine.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment, but on the<br>
