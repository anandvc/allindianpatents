The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for radio-frequency communication to separate first and second mobile terminals and particularly but not exclusively to apparatus for providing data communication over a radio frequency channel in addition to voice, image or other data communication.<br>
In a known radio frequency communication system, for example the INMARSAT-A (TM) Satellite Communication System, as described for example in "Satellite Communications: Principles and Applications", Calcutta and Tetley, 1st edition 1994, users are connected to a public service telephone network (PSTN) through a satellite link to provide voice, facsimile and circuit switched data communication services. Attempts have been made to add a packet switched data service, in which users share a single channel, to the existing services available through IKNIARSAT-A. However, this requires the allocation of additional traffic channels, which adds to the cost of the system.<br>
The document GB-A-2 232 562 describes a digital mobile telephone system with a data communications function. If a data communication is asymmetric, time slots, which are not needed for communication in one direction, are reassigned for data transmission in the opposite direction. The time slots may be reassigned to a different data terminal. However, such a system requires reallocation of part of a physical channel assigned for communication in one direction so as to change the direction and/or data terminal to which that part is assigned.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
communication system in which a first station is arranged selectively to transmit<br>
a principal signal and a data signal. The first station establishes a<br>
communication channel to a second station and begins to	<br><br>
transmit the principal signal to the second earth station. However, during a period in which no information can be transmitted to the second station, the first station transmits the data signal in such a way that it may be decoded by a third station and may also be received by the second station without affecting the information decoded by the second station.<br>
During voice communication, a proportion of the time during which a channel is kept open is unused, for example when a user is listening without talking, so that the user's transmit channel carries only noise. Likewise, in a facsimile communication, a terminal, which &gt; receives facsimile data only transmits during the handshaking phases of the communication; at other times its transmit channel is unused.<br>
In embodiments of the invention the available bandwidth of the communication channel is used with greater efficiency, and a data communication service  may be provided concurrently with another service.<br>
Preferably, the principal signal comprises a voice or facsimile signal.<br>
Where the principal signal is a voice signal the data signal is transmitted during periods of silence.  The first<br>
earth station may transmit a silence code which is decoded<br><br>
by the second earth station to reproduce silence or low-<br><br>
level noise during a voice communication.  Preferably, the<br>
third earth station interprets the silence code as a signal to receive data.<br>
Alternatively, the first earth station may transmit a<br>
signal which is reproduced by the second earth station as<br>
acceptable (e.g. low-level) noise or silence but which is<br>
decoded by the third earth station as data, during the<br>
periods of silence.	l<br>
Where the principal signal is a facsimile signal, the first station may detect whether the second earth station is   facsimile data and therefore does not need to receive anvil facsimile data.  The first station transmits<br><br>
the signal including the data signal in such a way tilt it does not activate the facsimile terminal at the second earth station, but activates the third earth station to receive data.<br>
By the above measures, tile second and third stations may receive data concurrently, with the second earth station only decoding the principal signal and the third earth station only decoding the data, but without interference between the signals. This aspect of the present invention extends in particular to the first station, the third station, apparatus within the first or third station which implement the essential features of the present invention and any method performed by such apparatus.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of encoding data not derived from a voice signal such that it appears to relate to a voice signal to a voice decoder but can be decoded to reproduce the data by a data decoder, and apparatus for performing said method.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method in which a duplex channel assigned to a facsimile communication is shared so teat, when a facsimile terminal is transmitting facsimile data in one direction, data is transmitted in the other direction for decoding by a data decoder in such a way that the facsimile terminal is not interrupted by the data.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of radio-frequency communication to separate first and second mobile terminals, the method comprising storing data (D) for transmission to said second mobile terminal, setting up a communication (S) with said first mobile terminal via a radio-frequency channel; detecting an absence of information in said communication (S); and transmitting one or more data packets derived from said data (D) and addressed to said second mobile terminal in said radio-frequency channel during said absence.<br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for radio-frequency communication to separate first and second mobile terminals, comprising storing means for storing data (D) for transmission to said second mobile terminal; set-up means for setting up a communication (S) with said first mobile terminal via a radio-frequency channel (C): detecting means for detecting an absence of information in said communication (S); and transmitting means for transmitting one or more data packets derived from said data (D) and addressed to said second mobile terminal in said radio-frequency channel during said absence.<br>

Figure 1 shows schematically a communication system in which a network station, such as a land earth station (LE;S) 4 is connected to a public service telephone network (PSTN) 2. The LES 4 is arranged to provide a satellite link between a number of users connected to the PSTN 2 and a number of user terminals, such as mobile earth stations (MES) which are able to receive and decode signals S transmitted by the LES 4 via a satellite, and to encode and transm.it signals to the LES 4 via the satellite. Figure 1 shows a first MES 6 and a second MES 8, both in com.munication with the LES 4 by means of a single channel<br>
r' K’ .<br>
Tne nature of the channel C d'::;:p6-nds '::n the addr’essing technique used.   For example,  in a Single clianriel per<br><br>
carrier (SCPC) system, a channel corresponds to a single carrier frequency in a half duplex syst:,i;!m or a pair of carrier frequencies in a full duplex, system. In a TDMA system, a channel corresponds to a predetermined time slot in a repeating time frame of a tranainission at a particular frequency or set of frequencies. In .a CDMA syestem, a channel corresponds to a transmission encoded with a predetermined code. The present invention does not depend on the addressing system used.<br>
The LES 4 also receives data D, addressed to the second MES 8, from the PSTN 2. The data D is stored at the LES 4 until it can be transmitted. Th(3 data D may alternatively have been entered directly at the LES 4 or previously received from an MES.<br>
In order to establish a communications link with the first MES 6, the LES 4 transmits a predetermined calling code identifying the first MES 6 on an LES signalling channel. The calling code includes a service--ty]:)e code which identifies whether a voice, facsimile or data transmission is to follow. The first MES 6 acknowledges the calling code on an MES signalling channel if it is ready to communicate. A communications link is then allocated by an independent network control station.<br>
If the LES 4 receives data D addressed to the second MES 8, it transmits a predetermined data addressing code on the LES signalling channel and the second MES 8 acknowledges the data addressing code if it is ready to receive the data. The data addressing code includes information on the communications link which will be used for data transmission.<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figures 1 to 7. In this embodiment, a packet switched data service is provided in addition to a voice communication service such as the INMARSAT-M (TM) system as also described .::: the Calcutt and Tetley reference above.<br>
First, a call is sec up between the LES 4 and the<br><br>
first MES 6 (step 102) .   The call may be initiated by either the LES 4 or the first MES 6.<br>
During the call, a voice signal V is receivad from the PSTN 2 by a codec 10 of the LES 4. Details of the codec 10 used in the INMARSAT-M (TM) system are described for example in the Calcutt and Tetley reference. This codec 10 uses an Improved Multi-Band Excitation (IMBE) algorithm, shown schematically in Figure 3. The voice signal V is analysed by a pitch estimation stage 46 which estimates the fundamental frequency   of the voice signal V. A voiced/unvoiced determination stage 4 8 evaluates the voicing measure of each of a number of non-overlapping frequency bands of the voice spectrum and generates a set of decisions Vj’ as to whether the voice signal. V is voiced or unvoiced in each band. A spectral amplitude estimation stage 50 determines the spectral envelope M, of each frequency band according to whether the band is determined to be voiced or unvoiced. The values ui’, V,,, M’ are encoded for each 20 ms frame of speech to form a series of vectors Uo to U7. Error correction information is added prior to radio frequency modulation and transmission.<br>
However, if the codec 10 does not: detect any vocal characteristics in the voice signal V, i \: sets the first six bits of vector UQ to 110010 (decimal .50) to form a silence code.<br>
In the first MES 6, another coderc 52 decodes the values of w’, V’. and M’ and synthesises unvoiced and voiced speech signals at unvoiced speech synthesizer 54 and voiced speech synthesizer 56 respectively. The outputs of the synthesizers 54 and 56 are added to produce a synthesised speed signal Vg. Alternatively, if the codec 52 receives the silence code, it generates low level "comfort" noise and does not decode any other information.<br>
The LES 4 includes a packet data interface unit 12 which normally receives encoded dal:a froni the codec 10 and sends the encoded data (step 106) to a raiio frequency (RF) modulator 14  for transmission by an antenna 16  to a<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
