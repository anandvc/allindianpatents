The present invention relates to a rear combination lamp installation structure in a motorcycle.<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle in which a rear combination lamp having a bulb for a tail lamp and a pair of bulbs for winkers is disposed in a rear cowl having an opening which can be closed with a passenger's seat and covering a rear portion of a body frame so that the rear portion of the rear combination lamp faces the rear from the rear end of the rear cowl. More particularly, the invention relates to improvement in a structure of attaching a rear combination lamp.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Conventionally, a structure of a motorcycle in which a<br><br>
rear combination lamp is disposed in a rear cowl so that the rear portion of the rear combination lamp faces the rear from the rear end of the rear cowl is already known by, for example, Japanese Patent Application No. 2000-280947.<br><br>
[Problem to be solved by the Invention]<br>
In the conventional structure, the rear combination lamp is fastened to the body frame together with the rear cowl. At the time of replacing a bulb for a tail lamp and bulbs for winkers, the rear combination lamp has to be  detached together with the rear cowl from the body frame, so that maintenance work is complicated.  Although there may be a method of fixing the base of the rear combination lamp to the body frame and detachably attaching a lens to the base in order to solve such complication, a fitting screw or the like is disposed on the outer face of the lens and there is the possibility that marketability from the viewpoint of appearance deteriorates.  <br>
The present invention has been achieved in consideration of such circumstances and its object is to provide a structure of attaching a rear combination lamp in a motorcycle, which allows a work of replacing a bulb for a tail lamp and bulbs for winkers to be easily performed while avoiding deterioration in marketability from the viewpoint of appearance.  [Means for solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the object, according to the invention of Claim 1, in a motorcycle in which a rear cowl having an opening formed<br><br><br>
in its upper portion, that can be closed by a passenger's seat, and covering a rear portion of a body frame, and a rear fender disposed below the rear cowl and covering a rear wheel from above are attached to the rear portion of the body frame, and a rear combination lamp having a bulb for a tail lamp and a pair of bulbs for winkers is disposed in the rear portion of the rear cowl so that the rear portion of the rear combination lamp faces to the rear from a rear end of the rear cowl, between a lower portion of the rear combination lamp and the rear fender, the rear combination lamp having the bulb for the tail lamp and the pair of bulbs for winkers which can be replaced while lenses remain attached when the rear combination lamp is detached from the rear cowl, a joining mechanism is provided which joins the rear combination lamp to the rear fender while switching a joining state between joint according to an operation of pushing the rear combination lamp into the rear cowl and cancellation of joint according to an operation or pulling out the rear combination lamp from the rear cowl to the rear, and a stay provided on the rear combination lamp is disposed in a position in which the stay faces upward through an opening in the rear cowl and is fastened to the body frame by a fastening member which can be fastened from above.<br>
With the configuration of the invention of Claim 1, fastening of the stay provided on the rear combination lamp to the body frame is canceled by the operation of unfastening the fastening member via the opening in the rear cowl, the opening being in a state where its closed state by the<br><br><br>
passenger's seat is canceled, the joint by the joining mechanism is canceled by the operation of pulling out the rear combination lamp from the rear cowl to the rear, and the lower portion of the rear combination lamp is detached from the rear fender, thereby enabling the whole rear combination lamp to be pulled out from the rear cowl to the rear.  From the rear combination lamp pulled out from the rear cowl, the bulb for the tail lamp and the pair of bulbs for winkers can be replaced while the lenses remain attached. At the time of attaching the rear combination lamp, it is sufficient to perform an operation reverse to the pulling operation.  Therefore, while improving marketability from the viewpoint of appearance by avoiding a member for maintenance from being disposed on the outer face of the lenses, attachment and detachment of the whole rear combination lamp are facilitated, and a work of replacing the bulb for the tail lamp and the bulbs for winkers can be easily performed.<br>
According to the present invention of Claim 2 , in addition to the configuration of the invention of Claim 1, the rear cowl is constructed by a pair of right and left side cowls covering the rear combination lamp from both sides and a center cowl fastened to the both side cowls and covering the rear combination lamp from above, the center cowl capable of being fastened or unfastened from the inner side, and the rear cowl is attached to the rear portion of the body frame. With the configuration, when a part of the rear cowl covering the rear combination lamp is damaged, the whole rear cowl does not have<br><br><br>
to be replaced. Moreover, the part for fastening the center cowl to the both side cowls can be prevented from appearing on the outer face of the rear cowl. It can also contribute to improvement in marketability from the viewpoint of appearance.<br>

The retaining nail 82b is movable while being deflected in the grommet 81 by the action of external force to the rear combination lamp 41 in the travel direction of the body frame F. The retaining nail 82b is retained by the front<br><br>
end of the grommet 81 in accordance with an operation of pushing the rear combination lamp 41 into the rear cowl 38 and cancels the retention with the front end of the grommet 81 in accordance with an operation of pulling the rear combination lamp 41 from the rear cowl 3 8 to the rear side ina retained state . Therefore, in a state where fitting to the body frame F of the stay 51 is canceled, as shown in Fig. 6, the rear combination lamp 41 can be detached from the rear cowl 38 to the rear.<br>
The rear combination lamp 41 is supported by the body when the front portion of the stay 51 provided on the rear combination lamp 41 in a connected row arrangement is fastened to the body frame F and right and left two parts in the lower portion of the rear combination lamp 41 are joined to the rear fender 39 by the joining mechanisms 80.  In order to suppress vertical vibrations of the rear portion of the rear combination lamp 41, a projection 85 projected toward the top face in the center portion of the base 42 of the rear combination lamp 41 is integrally in contact with the inner face of the center portion in the width direction of the center cowl 58 in the rear cowl 38. An elastic member 86 attached to the projection 85 is elastically in contact with the top face of the center portion of the base 42.<br>
The action of the embodiment will now be described. The stay 51 provided on the rear combination lamp 41 is disposed in a position so as to face upward in the opening 55 of the rear cowl 3 8 and is fastened to the body frame F by the bolt<br><br>
74 which can be fastened from above. Between the rear fender 3 9 attached to the body frame F and the lower portion of the rear combination lamp 41, a pair of joining mechanisms 80 is provided which joins the rear combination lamp 41 to the rear fender 39 while switching a joining state between joint according to an operation of pushing the rear combination lamp 41 into the rear cowl 38 and cancellation of joint according to an operation of pulling out the rear combination lamp 41 from the rear cowl 3 8 to the rear.<br>
Therefore, fastening of the stay 51 provided on the rear combination lamp 41 to the body frame F is canceled by the operation of unfastening the bolt 74 via the opening 55 in the rear cowl 38 in a state where the opening 55 is not closed by the pillion seat 27, the joint by the joining mechanisms 80 is canceled by the operation of pulling out the rear combination lamp 41 from the rear cowl 38 to the rear, and the lower portion of the rear combination lamp 41 is detached from the rear fender 39, thereby enabling the whole rear combination lamp 41 to be pulled out from the rear cowl 38 to the rear.<br>
Moreover, in a state where the rear combination lamp 41 is detached from the rear cowl 38, the bulbs 43 for the tail lamp and the bulbs 45 for winkers can be replaced while the inner lenses 44 and 46 and outer lens 47 remain attached. The bulb 49 for the license plate can be replaced while the lens 50 for the license plate remains attached.<br><br>
At the time of attaching the rear combination lamp 41, by performing an operation reverse to the pulling operation, the rear combination lamp 41 can be assembled to the body.<br>
As a result, while improving marketability from the viewpoint of appearance by avoiding a member for maintenance from being disposed on the outer face of the outer lens 47, attachment and detachment of the whole rear combination lamp 41 are facilitated, and a work of replacing the bulbs 43 for the tail lamps, the bulbs 45 for winkers, and the bulb 49 for the license plate can be easily performed.<br>
Moreover, the rear cowl 3 8 is constructed by the pair of right and left side cowls 57 and 57 covering the rear combination lamp 41 from both sides and the center cowl 58 fastened to the side cowls 57 and 57 and covering the rear combination lamp 41 from above.  Consequently, when a part of the rear cowl 38 covering the rear combination lamp 41 is damaged, the whole rear cowl 3 8 does not have to be replaced.<br>
Furthermore, the center cowl 58 is fastened to the side cowls 57 and 57 so as to be fastened or unfastened from the inner side, so that the portions for fastening the center cowl 58 to the side cowls 57 and 57 are prevented from appearing on the outer face of the rear cowl 38. Thus, it can contribute to improvement in marketability from the viewpoint of appearance.<br><br><br>
The embodiments of the present invention have been described above.  The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments but the design can be variously modified without departing from the present invention described in the scope of claims.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
