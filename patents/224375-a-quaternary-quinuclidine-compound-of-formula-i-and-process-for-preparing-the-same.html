This alkylation reaction may be carried out by two different experimental procedures, a) and b)which are described below. In particular method b) provides a new experimental process, using solid phase extraction methodologies, that allows the parallel preparation of several compounds. Methods a) and b) are described in the experimental section. Compounds of general Formula II which are not commercially available have been prepared by synthesis according to standard methods. For example, compounds wherein n = 0 and A= -0-,-S-or -NR6, wherein R6 is as defined above, were obtained by reaction of the corresponding aromatic derivative or its potassium salt with an alkylating agent of general formula Y-(CH2)m-X, wherein X may be a halogen and Y may be a halogen or a sulphonate ester. In other examples, compounds of general Formula II, where n&gt;=l were synthesised from the corresponding alcohol derivative of general Formula IV by known methods.<br>
Compounds of general Formula III may be prepared by three<br><br>
different methods c,d and e illustrated in the following scheme and detailed in the experimental section.<br>

In human therapy, the dose of the compound of general formula (I) depend on the desired effect and duration of treatment; adult doses are generally between 3 mg and 300 mg per day as tablets and 10 /ug and 800 ^g per day as inhalant composition.<br>
Pharmacological Action<br>
The following examples demonstrate the excellent pharmacological activities of the compounds of the present invention. The results on human muscarinic receptors binding and in the test on bronchospasm in guinea pig, were obtained as described below.<br>
Human muscarinic receptor studies.<br>
The binding of [3H]-NMS to human muscarinic receptors was performed according to Waelbroek et al (1990) (1) . Assays were carried out at 25°C. Membrane preparations from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary-Kl cells (CHO) expressing the genes for the human muscarinic receptors Hm3 were used.<br>
For determination of IC50, membrane preparations were suspended in DPBS to a final concentration of 89 ug/ml for the Hm3 subtype. The membrane suspension was incubated with the tritiated compound for 60 min. After incubation the membrane fraction was separated by filtration and the bound radioactivity determined. Non specific binding was determined by addition of 10~" M atropine. At least six concentrations were assayed in duplicate to generate individual displacement curves.<br><br>

Our results show that the compounds of the present invention have affinities for the M3 receptors which are very similar to the reference compounds.<br>
The compounds of the invention preferably have high affinities for muscarinic M3 receptors (HM3), preferably human muscarinic receptors. Affinity levels can typically be measured by in vitro assays, for example, as described above.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention have an IC50 (nM) value for M3 receptors of less than 35, preferably less than 25,20 or 15, more preferably less than 10,8 or 5.<br>
Test on bronchospasm in guinea pig<br>
The studies were performed according to Konzett and Rossler (2). Aqueous solutions of the agents to be tested were nebulized and inhaled<br>
by anaesthetized ventilated male guinea pigs (Dunkin-Hartley). The bronchial response to intravenous acetylcholine challenge was determined before and after drug administration and the percent change in pulmonary resistance at several time-points.<br>
2. Konzett H., Rossler F. Versuchsanordnung zu Untersuchungen ander bronchialmuskulatur. Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmacol. 195: 71-74 (1940)<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibited the bronchospasm response to acetylcholine with high potency and a long duration of action.<br>
From the above described results one of ordinary skill in the art can readily understand that the compounds of the present invention have excellent antimuscarinic activity (M3) and thus are useful for the treatment of diseases in which the muscarinic M3 receptor is implicated, including respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, asthma and rhinitis, urinary diseases such as urinary incontinence and pollakinuria in neuripenia pollakinuria, neurogenic bladder, nocturnal enuresis, unstable bladder, cystospasm and chronic cystitis and gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis and diverticulitis.<br>
The present invention further provides a compound of formula CD or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formula (I) for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, in particular for the treatment of respiratory, urinary or gastrointestinal disease.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of respiratory, urinary or gastrointestinal disease.<br>
Further, the compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) can be used in a method of treating respiratory, urinary or gastrointestinal disease, which method comprises administering to a human or animal patient in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I).<br>
