				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of stable natural green colorant from the skin of fresh green pepper berries.<br>
There is a considerable interest around the world in the development of food colours from natural sources as alternates for synthetic colorants. Natural green colorant has been made using specific raw materials such as alfalfa, spinach, algae, olive skin, palm fibre, kiwi fruit, cereal grasses, carrot tops etc.<br>
In this process, the green pepper berries obtained directly or as a byproduct from the process of making white pepper is stabilised to retain the green colour and the colour is then subsequently extracted.<br>
Chlorophyll, the green pigment of plants, is extracted and widely used as a natural colouring matter in various food items. Patent literature on the preparation of chlorophyll colorants can be classified into categories namely, extraction with organic solvents such as alcohol or acetone, aqueous extraction, production of alkali metal salts of chlorophyll, preparation of oil solutions and stabilisation of chlorophyll.<br>
Reference may be made to USSR Patent No.342,628 (1972) chlorophyll-carotene paste which deals with the preparation of chlorophyll-carotene paste from evergreen plant materials using an organic solvent such as trichloroethylene.<br>
Reference may be made to UK Patent No. 1,358,052 (1971), process for producing edible powders which deals with the preparation of edible powder from green leaves of barley and wheat wherein the extracted green juice is<br>
neutralised to pH 7.2 and spray dried to get an edible powder for use in the preparation of food items like ice cream.<br>
Reference may be made to Japan Patent No. 72,020,473 (1972), preventing discoloration of chlorophyll on heating which deals with the stabilisation of an alcoholic chlorophyll extract from barley leaf and spray drying. The spray dried powder was extracted with ethanol, clarified with sodium bicarbonate , evaporated and diluted with water. The PH of the extract adjusted to 7.2 prevented discolouration on heating.<br>
Reference may be made to Japan Patent No.72,034,718 (1972), stabilized chlorophyll containing food colorant which deals with the preparation of edible chlorophyll colorant suitable for food use. using lauryl sulphate, diamine salts and propylene glycol.<br>
Reference may be made to Japan Patent No. 74,052,826 (1974), preparation of natural chlorophyll, which deals with the preparation of chlorophyll colorant for food use from chopped grass leaves by extraction with acetone, neutralisation with an aqueous alkaline solution and extraction with ether followed by low-pressure distillation.<br>
Reference may be made to Japan Patent No. 80,157,659 (1980) simultaneous extraction of chlorophylls and carotenoids from algae as food-coloring agents ,which deals with the simultaneous extraction and subsequent preparation of chlorophyll and carotenoids from algae using a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophyllic solvents followed by concentration and drying.<br>
Reference may be made to Japan Patent No. 80,007,702 (1982) green food colorant from vegetables which deals with the preparation of chlorophyll based green colour wherein a green vegetable is soaked in 1% sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, frozen ,thawed pressed and subsequently dried.<br>
Reference may be made to French Patent (1976), process for obtaining vegetable extracts from moist vegetable material which deals with the method of making edible oily or fat soluble vegetable extract such as carotene or chlorophyll concentrate from wet vegetable waste such as olive skin, nettles or palm fiber by extraction with an organic solvent with a boiling point less than 60°C and a solubility of 20-40% in water.<br>
Reference may be made to Netherland Patent (1973)y method of preserving vegetables which deals with the stabilisation of the green vegetable such as green peas, sprout or calabrese is carried out by heating the raw vegetable to at least 50°C in an aqueous solution containing 0.01 to 0.1% (w/v) of cationogenic, alkyl-substituted, quaternary, nitrogen compound such as cetylethylmorpholinoethyl sulfonate. This treatment prevents the conversion of chlorophyll to pheophytin.<br>

The novelty of the present invention is that the chlorophyll present in hitherto unexplored edible plant source, namely fresh green pepper skin is stabilised and subsequently processed to get a green colorant for food use.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples which should not, however, be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.Processing conditions with reference to two examples are given below.<br>
Example 1<br>
One kg of fresh pepper spikes were destalked manually and cleaned using running cold water to get 770 gm cleaned berries. The berries were immersed in 2 liters of water in a steam jacketed kettle and temperature was raised to 98°c and held for 20 minutes. The blanched berries were then washed with running cold water and passed through a pulper to obtain 400 gm of pulp which was treated with 400 ml of 1% solution of potassium meta bisulphite in water and held for 4 hours at a pH of 3.5. The pH of the separated [pulp was raised to 10 by the addition of sodium carbonate solution, held for 20 minutes, washed and pressed to retrieve the colour stabilised wet pulp(160g) Colour stabilised wet pulp (80g) was extracted with 240 ml of acetone and desolventised to get 2.5 gm colorant in paste form. The other part of the colour stabilised pressed wet pulp (80g ) was dried at 45°C for 4 hours to obtain a dry powder (40g) which was extracted with 200 ml of aqueous acetone and desolventised to get 2.5 gm colorant as a resinous mass.<br>
Example 2<br>
Five hundred gram of fresh pepper spikes were destalked manually and cleaned using running cold water to get 400 gm of berries. The berries were subjected to a temperature of 170°c for 3 minutes cooled to room temperature<br>
and passed through a pulper to get 160 gm pulp which was treated with 160 ml of 0.5% solution of potassium meta bisulphite and held for 4hours at a pH of 4.0 . Separated pulp was treated with sodium carbonate solution to pH of 10 for 30 minutes and washed and pressed and dried at 50° C for 4 hours to retrieve 40 g pulp. The dry pulp was extracted with 200 ml of aqueous alcohol and desolventised to get 2.5 gm colorant as a resinous mass. The main advantages of the present process invention are<br>
(a)	It is possible to get a natural green colorant for food use from an edible<br>
plant material which was not explored so far for this purpose.<br>
(b)	The chlorophyll in the plant material is stabilised, pungent constituents<br>
co-occuring with the pigment are removed and the bland stabilised skin<br>
is used for colour extraction, either as such or after drying .<br>

of making white pepper is suitably processed for colour extraction.<br><br><br><br>
