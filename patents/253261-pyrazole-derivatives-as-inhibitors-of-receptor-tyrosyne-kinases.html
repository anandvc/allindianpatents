				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrazole derivatives, their pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use. In addition, the present invention relates to therapeutic methods for the treatment and prevention of cancers and to the use of these pyrazole derivatives in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the treatment and prevention of cancers. Background of the invention<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK's) are a sub-family of protein kinases that play a critical role in cell signalling and are involved in a variety of cancer related processes including cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. Currently up to 100 different RTK's including tropomyosin-related kinases (Trie's) have been identified.<br>
Trie's are the high affinity receptors activated by a group of soluble growth factors called neurotrophins (NT). The Trie receptor femily has three niembers - TrkA, TrkB and TrkC Among the NTs there are (i) nerve growth factor (NGF) which activates TrkA, (ii) team-derived growth factor (BDNF) and NT-4/5 which activate TrkB and (iii) NTS which activates TrkC. Each Trk receptor contains an extra-cellular domain (tigand binding), a trans-membrane region and an mtra-celhilar domain (including kmase domain). Upon binding of the ligand, the kinase catalyzes auto-phosphorylation and triggers downstream signal transduction pathways.<br>
Trie's are widely expressed in neuronal tissue during its development where Trie's are critical for the maintenance and survival of these cells. A post-embryonic role for the Trk/neurotrophin axis (or pathway), however, remains in question. There are reports showing that Trie's play important role hi both development and function of the nervous system (Patapoutian, A. et al Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 2001,11,272-280).<br>
In the past decade, a considerable number of literature documentations linking Trk signalling with cancer have published. For example, while Trie's are expressed at low levels outside the nervous system in the adult, Trk expression is increased in late stage prostate cancers. Both normal prostate tissue and androgen- dependent prostate tumours express low levels of Trk A and undetectable levels of Trk B and C. However, all isoforms of Trk receptors as well as their cognate ligands are up-regulated in late stage, androgen-independent prostate cancer. There is additional evidence that these late stage prostate cancer<br><br>
cells become dependent on the Trk/oetnrotrophin axis for their survival Therefore, Trie inhibitors may yield a class of apoptosis-indncing agents specific for androgen- independent prostate cancer (Weeraratna, A. T. et al The Prostate, 2000,45,140-148).<br>
Furthermore, very recent literature also shows mat over-expression, activation, amplification and/or mutation of Trie's are associated with secretory breast carcinoma (Cancer Cell, 2002,2,367-376), colorectal cancer (Bardelli et al Science, 2003,300,949-949) and ovarian cancer (Davidson, B. et al Clinical Cancer Research, 2003, 9,2248-2259).<br>
There are a few reports of selective Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Cephalon described CEP-751, CEP-701 (George, D. et al Cancer Research, 1999, 59,2395-2341) and other indolocarbazole analogues (WO0114380) as Trk inhibitors. It was shown mat CEP-701 and/or CEP751, when combined with surgically or chemically induced androgen ablation, offered better efficacy compared with mono-therapy alone. GlaxoSmithKhne disclosed certain oxmdole compounds as TrkA inhibitors in WO0220479 and WO0220513. Recently, Japan Tobacco reported pyrazotyl condensed cyclic compounds as Trk inhibitors (JP2003231687A).<br>
In addition to the above, Vertex Pharmaceuticals have described pyrazole compounds as inhibitors of GSK3, Aurora, etc. in WO0250065, WO0262789 and WO03027111; and AstraZeneca have reported pyrazole compounds as inhibitors against IGF-1 receptor kinase (W00348133). Summary of tine invention<br>
La accordance with the present invention, the applicants have hereby discovered novel pyrazole compounds, or pharmaceuticalry acceptable salts thereof, which possess Trk kinase inhibitory activity and are accordingly useful for their anti-proliferation and/or proapoptotic (such as anti-cancer) activity and in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said pyrazole compounds, or phannaceutically acceptable salts thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of an anti-proliferation and/or proapoptotic effect in warm-blooded animals such as man.<br>
Also in accordance with the present invention the applicants provide methods of using such pyrazole compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the treatment of cancer.<br>
The properties of the compounds claimed in this invention are expected to be of value in the treatment of disease states associated with cell proliferation such as cancers (solid<br><br>
tumours and leukaemia), fibroproliferative and differentiative disorders, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, atherosclerosis, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, bone diseases and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of the invention are expected to be of value in the treatment or prophylaxis of cancers selected from oesophageal cancer, myeloma, hepatocellular, pancreatic, cervical cancer, ewings tumour, neuroblastoma, kaposis sarcoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, hmg cancer - non. small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and small cell hmg cancer (SCLC), gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and leukaemia; particularly ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and hmg cancer - NSCLC and SCLC; more particularly prostate cancer; and more particularly hormone refractory prostate cancer.

It win be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituentsm the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications eimer prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.<br>
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where<br><br>
protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or f-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifbxxoacetic add and an aryfane&amp;oxycarboayl group such as abenzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladhim-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example bacon tris(tnffaacoac**ate). A suitaU^ for a primary ammo group is, for example, a pbrbaloyi group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dime&amp;vlaminorm&gt;pylaminc, or withhydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as tiifluoroacetic<br><br>
acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art. Definitions<br>

Utility<br>
The compounds of the present invention have utility for the treatment of cancer by inhibiting the tyrosine kinases, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B. Methods of treatment target tyrosine kinase activity, particularly the Trk activity and more particularly Trk A and B activity, which is involved in a variety of cancer related processes. Thus, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B, are expected to be active against neoplastic disease such as carcinoma of the breast, ovary, lung, colon, prostate or other tissues, as well as leukemias and lymphomas, tumours of the central and peripheral nervous system, and other tumour types such as melanoma, fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly the Trk inhibitors and more particularly Trk A and B inhibitors are also expected to be useful for the treatment other proliferative diseases including but not limited to autoimmune, inflammatory, neurological, and cardiovascular diseases.<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention have been shown to inhibit tyrosine kinases, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B, as determined by the Trie B Assay described herein.<br>
Compounds provided by this invention should also be useful as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit tyrosine kinases, particularly the Trks and more particularly Trk A and B. These would be provided hi commercial kits comprising a compound of this invention TrkB Assay Format<br>
TrkB kinase activity is being measured against its ability to phosphorylate synthetic tyrosine residues within a generic polypeptide substrate using homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRJF) technology. The intracellular domain of a HIS-tagged human TrkB kinase was expressed in SF9 cells and purified using standard nickel column chromatography. After the kinase is incubated with a biotinylated substrate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for 50 minutes at room temperature, the kinase reaction is stopped by the addition of 60 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The reaction is performed in 384 well microtitre plates and reaction products are detected with the addition of strepavidin-linked and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies using the Tecan Ultra Evolution Microplate Fluometer after an additional 3-hour incubation at room temperature.<br>
