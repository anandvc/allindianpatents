				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a structure and method for increasing the heat transfer<br>
rate particularly in the center and corners of endwinding cavities to increase<br>
overall cooling effectiveness in generator and rotor endwinding.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The power output rating of dynamoelectric machines, such as large turbo-<br>
generators, is often limited by the ability to provide additional current through<br>
the rotor field winding because of temperature limitations imposed on the<br>
electrical conductor insulation. Therefore, effective cooling of the rotor winding<br>
contributes directly to the output capability of the machine. This is especially true<br>
of the rotor end region, where direct, forced cooling is difficult and expensive<br>
due to the typical construction of these machines. As prevailing market trends<br>
require higher efficiency and higher reliability in lower cost, higher-power density<br>
generators, cooling the rotor end region becomes a limiting factor.<br>
Turbo-generator rotors typically consist of concentric rectangular coils mounted<br>
in slots in a rotor. The end portions of the coils (commonly referred to as<br>
endwindings), which are beyond the support of the main rotor body, are typically<br>
supported against rotational forces by a retaining ring. Support blocks are placed<br>
intermittently between the concentric coil endwindings to maintain relative<br>
position and to add mechanical stability for axial loads, such as thermal loads.<br>
Additionally, the copper coils are constrained radially by the retaining ring on<br>
their outer radius, which counteracts centrifugal forces. The presence of the<br>
spaceblocks and retaining ring results in a number of coolant regions exposed to<br>
the copper coils. The primary coolant path is axial, between the spindle and the<br>
bottom of the endwindings. Also, discrete cavities are formed between coils by<br>
the bounding surfaces of the coils, blocks and the inner surface of the retaining<br><br>
ring structure. The endwindings are exposed to coolant that is driven by<br>
rotational forces from radially below the endwindings into these cavities. This<br>
heat transfer tends to be low. This is because according to computed flow<br>
pathlines in a single rotating endwinding cavity from a computational fluid<br>
dynamic analysis, the coolant flow enters the cavity, traverses through a primary<br>
circulation and exits the cavity. Typically, the circulation results in low heat<br>
transfer coefficients especially near the center of the cavity. Thus, while this is a<br>
means for heat removal in the endwindings, it is relatively inefficient.<br>
Various schemes have been used to route additional cooling gas through<br>
the rotor end region. All of these cooling schemes rely on either (1) making<br>
cooling passages directly in the copper conductors by machining grooves or<br>
forming channels in the conductors, and then pumping the gas to some other<br>
region of the machine, and/or (2) creating regions of relatively higher and lower<br>
pressures with the addition of baffles, flow channels and pumping elements to<br>
force the cooling gas to pass over the conductor surfaces.<br>
Some systems penetrate the highly stressed rotor retaining ring with radial holes<br>
to allow cooling gas to be pumped directly alongside the rotor endwindings and<br>
discharged into the air gap, although such systems can have only limited<br>
usefulness due to the high mechanical stress and fatigue life considerations<br>
relating to the retaining ring.<br>
If the conventional forced rotor end cooling schemes are used, considerable<br>
complexity and cost are added to rotor construction. For example, directly cooled<br>
conductors must be machined or fabricated to form the cooling passages. In<br>
addition, an exit manifold must be provided to discharge the gas somewhere in<br>
the rotor. The forced cooling schemes require the rotor end region to be divided<br>
into separate pressure zones, with the addition of numerous baffles, flow<br>
channels and pumping elements-which again add complexity and cost.<br><br><br>
If none of these forced or direct cooling schemes are used, then the<br>
rotor endwindings are cooled passively. Passive cooling relies on the<br>
centrifugal and rotational forces of the rotor to circulate gas in the blind, dead-<br>
end cavities formed between concentric rotor windings. Passive cooling of<br>
rotor endwindings is sometimes also called "free convection" cooling.<br>
Passive cooling provides the advantage of minimum complexity and<br>
cost, although heat removal capability is diminished when compared with the<br>
active systems of direct and forced cooling. Any cooling gas entering the<br>
cavities between concentric rotor windings must exit through the same<br>
opening since these cavities are otherwise enclosed - the four "side walls" of<br>
a typical cavity are formed by the concentric conductors and the insulating<br>
blocks that separate them, with the "bottom" (radially outward) wall formed by<br>
the retaining ring that supports the endwindings against rotation. Cooling gas<br>
enters from the annular space between the conductors and the rotor spindle.<br>
Heat removal is thus limited by the low circulation velocity of the gas in the<br>
cavity and the limited amount of the gars that can enter and leave these<br>
spaces.<br>
In typical configurations, the cooling gas in the end region has not yet<br>
been fully accelerated to rotor speed, that is, the cooling gas is rotating at part<br>
rotor speed. As the fluid is driven into a cavity by means of the relative<br>
velocity impact between the rotor and the fluid, the heat transfer coefficient is<br>
typically highest near the spaceblock that is downstream relative to the flow<br>
direction - where the fluid enters with high momentum and where the fluid<br>
coolant is coldest. The heat transfer coefficient is also typically high around<br>
the cavity periphery. The center of the cavity receives the least cooling.<br>
Increasing the heat removal capability of passive cooling systems will<br>
increase the current carrying capability of the rotor providing increased rating<br>
capability of the generator whole maintaining the advantage of low cost,<br>
simple and reliable construction.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,644,179, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
describes a method for augmenting heat transfer by increasing the flow velocity<br>
of the large single flow circulation cell by introducing additional cooling flow<br>
directly into, and in the same direction as, the naturally occurring flow cell. While<br>
this method increases the heat transfer in the cavity by augmenting the strength<br>
of the circulation cell, the center region of the rotor cavity was still left with low<br>
velocity and therefore low heat transfer. The same low heat transfer still persists<br>
in the corner regions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above-mentioned needs are addressed by the present invention, in which<br>
enhanced cooling of generator rotors is achieved by the use of flow-through<br>
spaceblocks to promote better flow circulation in the normally starved cavity<br>
center and corners, thus increasing the flow heat transfer rate. The invention<br>
further relates to the use of coolant flow deflectors to enhance coolant flow into<br>
and from the cooling cavities.<br>
Accordingly, as an embodiment of the invention, a gas cooled<br>
dynamoelectric machine is provided that comprises a rotor having axially<br>
extending coils, endwindings, and at least one spaceblock located between<br>
adjacent the endwindings so as to define first and second cavities adjacent the<br>
spaceblock between mutually adjacent endwindings. At least one of the<br>
spaceblocks has at least one passage defined therethrough to provide for cooling<br>
flow communication between the first and second cavities through the<br>
spaceblock. The number of passages in each spaceblock may be appropriately<br>
determined by the circumferential position of the spaceblock.<br>
By providing a flow of cooling gas between the mutually adjacent cavities, the<br>
flow-through passage(s) improve the inherent gas flow patterns generated by<br><br>
the rotating endwindings. This results in increased heat removal capability while<br>
maintaining low cost, simplicity and reliable construction. In addition, the<br>
improved passive cooling system will increase the current carrying capability of<br>
the rotor, producing an increased output rating for the generator.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, a flow deflector is provided<br>
either on the upstream side or the downstream side, or both sides, of the<br>
spaceblock(s) to direct coolant fluid flow radially outwardly into the respective<br>
cooling cavity, in the case of the upstream flow deflector, or to encourage a<br>
smooth and continuous return flow to the annular region, in the case of the<br>
downstream flow deflector. The combination of both flow-through passages and<br>
deflectors, according to a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, will<br>
promote flow of high momentum coolant in the cavities thus reducing or<br>
eliminating regions of stagnant or low momentum flow at the cavity corners and<br>
center, in particular.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings wherein identical reference numerals denote<br>
the same elements throughout the various views, FIGURES 1 and 2 show a<br>
rotor 10 for a gas-cooled dynamoelectric machine, which also includes a<br>
stator 12 surrounding the rotor. The rotor includes a generally cylindrical body<br>
portion 14 centrally disposed on a rotor spindle 16 and having axially<br>
opposing end faces, of which a portion 18 of one end face is shown in<br>
FIGURE 1. The body portion is provided with a plurality of circumferentially-<br>
spaced, axially extending slots 20 for receiving concentrically arranged coils<br>
22, which make up the rotor winding. For clarity, only five rotor coils are<br>
shown, although several more are commonly used in practice.<br>
Specifically, a number of conductor bars 24 constituting a portion of the<br>
rotor winding are stacked in each one of the slots. Adjacent conductor bars<br>
are separated by layers of electrical insulation 22. The stacked conductor<br>
bars are typically maintained in the slots by wedges 26 (FIGURE 1) and are<br>
made of a conductive material such as copper. The conductor bars 24 are<br>
interconnected at each opposing end of the body portion by end turns, which<br>
extend axially beyond the end faces to form stacked endwindings 28. The<br>
end turns are also separated by layers of electrical insulation.<br><br><br>
Referring specifically to FIGURE 1, a retaining ring 30 is disposed<br>
around the end turns at each end of the body portion to hold the endwindings<br>
in place against centrifugal forces. The retaining ring is fixed at one end to<br>
the body portion and extends out over the rotor spindle 16. A centering ring<br>
32 is attached to the distal end of the retaining ring 30. It should be noted that<br>
the retaining ring 30 and the center ring 32 can be mounted in other ways, as<br>
is known in the art. The inner diameter of the centering ring 32 is radially<br>
spaced from the rotor spindle 16 so as to form a gas inlet passage 34 and the<br>
endwindings 28 are spaced from the spindle 16 so as to define an annular<br>
region 36. A number of axial cooling channels 38 formed along slots 20 are<br>
provided in fluid communication with the gas inlet passage 34 via the annular<br>
region 36 to deliver cooling gas to the coils 22.<br>
Turning to FIGURE 2, the endwindings 28 at each end of the rotor 10<br>
are circumferentially and axially separated by a number of spacers or<br>
spaceblocks 40. (For clarity of illustration, the spaceblocks are not shown in<br>
FIGURE 1). The spaceblocks are elongated blocks of an insulating material<br>
located in the spaces between adjacent endwindings 28 and extend beyond<br>
the full radial depth of the endwindings into the annular gap 36. Accordingly,<br>
the spaces between the concentric stacks of the end turns (hereinafter<br>
endwindings) are divided into cavities. These cavities are bounded on the top<br>
by the retaining ring 30 and on four sides by adjacent endwindings 28 and<br>
adjacent spaceblocks 40. As best seen in FIGURE 1, each of these cavities<br>
is in fluid communication with the gas inlet passage 34 via the annular region<br>
36. A portion of the cooling gas entering the annular region 36 between the<br>
endwinding 28 and the rotor spindle 16 through the gas inlet passage 34 thus<br>
enters the cavities 42, circulates therein, and then returns to the annular<br>
region 36 between the endwinding and the rotor spindle. Air flow is shown by<br>
the arrows in FIGURES 1 and 3.<br>
The inherent pumping action and rotational forces acting in a rotating<br>
generator cavity produce a large single flow circulation cell, as schematically<br>
7<br><br><br>
shown in FIGURE 3. This flow circulation cell exhibits its highest velocity near<br>
the peripheral edges of the cavity, leaving the center region inadequately<br>
cooled due to the inherently low velocity in the center region of the cavity. As<br>
can be seen from FIGURE 3, large areas of the corner regions are also<br>
inadequately cooled because the circular motion of the flow cell does not<br>
carry cooling flow into the corners.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 6, there is illustrated a partial section of the<br>
rotor endwinding showing endwinding cavities 142, 144, 146, 148 with the<br>
direction of rotation indicated by arrow X. In an embodiment of the invention,<br>
each spaceblock 150, 152, 154, 156, 158 is provided with at least one flow-<br>
through passage 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182,<br>
184, 186 for providing a communicating flow between mutually adjacent<br>
cooling cavities, most preferably at least at the center and radially outer<br>
corner regions of the cooling cavities for increasing heat removal. The flow-<br>
through passages preferably extend between respective radially central<br>
portions of the mutually adjacent cooling tavities. Another preferred area of<br>
coolant flow is adjacent the radially outer end of the spaceblock to<br>
communicate flow between otherwise generally stagnate corner regions of the<br>
respective cooling cavities.<br>
As described in greater detail below, the passages extend from the<br>
downstream side of each respective upstream adjacent cavity to the upstream<br>
side of the respective downstream adjacent cavity and thus provide passages<br>
through which cooling gas can flow between the mutually adjacent cavities.<br>
Thus, each flow-through passage lies generally transverse to the length of its<br>
spaceblock, generally circumferentially with respect to the rotor.<br>
As can be seen from the illustrated embodiment, the preferred location<br>
and number of flow-through passages in each spaceblock is dependent upon<br>
the circumferential position of the spaceblock with respect to the endwinding<br>
leading and trailing ends. As also clearly shown in FIGURE 6, the preferred<br>
orientation of the flow-through passages is also dependent upon the<br><br><br><br>
circumferential location. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
circumferentially outermost spaceblocks 150, 158 of the endwinding assembly<br>
respectively include first and second flow-through passages, one 162, 186 for<br>
directing coolant flow to/from into the generally radially central portion of the<br>
coolant cavity 142, 148 and one 160, 184 for directing coolant flow to/from the<br>
radially outer comer regions of the adjacent cooling cavity 142, 148. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated in FIGURE 6, these flow-through passages are<br>
inclined at an angle of less than 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the respective spaceblock 150, 158 to direct flow generally<br>
circumferentially and radially, outwardly in the case of the leading spaceblock<br>
150, and inwardly in the case of the trailing spaceblock 158.<br>
Referring again to the embodiment of FIGURE 6, the spaceblock 152<br>
downstream from the leading spaceblock 150 has three passages 164, 166,<br>
168 defined therethrough, one passage 164 to flow coolant to the radially<br>
outer comer regions of the cavity 144, and passages 166, 168 disposed to<br>
flow coolant from/to the central region of the respective adjacent cavities 142,<br>
144. in this example, the flow-through passages of the second spaceblock<br>
152 are oriented generally circumferentially of the rotor axis, at an angle of<br>
about 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis of spaceblock 152. In<br>
the illustrated embodiment, furthermore, an upstream flow deflector(s) 188, as<br>
discussed in greater detail below, is provided on the upstream surface 194 of<br>
the spaceblock 152 for deflecting flow from the annular region 36 into the<br>
cavity 142, to augment the coolant flow therein.<br>
The next adjacent, middle or intermediate spaceblock 154 includes four<br>
circumferentially disposed flow-through passages 170, 172, 174, 176, three<br>
disposed in positions generally corresponding to those of the second<br>
spaceblock and the fourth circumferential flow-through passage 176 provided<br>
adjacent the radially inner extent of the endwinding 28. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, upstream and downstream flow deflectors 188, 190, as<br>
discussed in greater detail below, are provided on the upstream and<br><br><br>
downstream surfaces 196, 198 of the intermediate spacebiock 154, and the<br>
radially innermost passage 176 is disposed just radially outside the radially<br>
outer extent of the deflector structures 188,190.<br>
The next adjacent, fourth spaceblock 156 of the illustrated embodiment<br>
includes three flow-through passages 178, 180, 182 which are disposed in<br>
radial positions generally corresponding to those of the second spaceblock<br>
154. In the presently preferred embodiment, these passages are generally<br>
circumferentially disposed, at an angle of about 90 degrees with respect to the<br>
longitudinal axis of spaceblock 156. As discussed in greater detail below, a<br>
downstream flow deflector 190 is provided on the downstream surface 200 of<br>
the fourth spaceblock to guide and direct at least some of the flow from<br>
passage 182 to annular region 36, to flow under and about downstream<br>
adjacent spaceblock 158.<br>
As noted above, to increase coolant flow into the respective<br>
endwinding cavities, in accordance with a further feature of the presently<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one of the spacebiocks is<br>
provided with a flow deflector 188 on the forward facing or upstream surface<br>
thereof, which is on the downstream side of the upstream adjacent cavity,<br>
and/or a flow deflector 190 on the rearward facing or downstream surface<br>
thereof, which is on the upstream side of the downstream adjacent cavity, with<br>
respect to the direction of coolant flow across the bottom of the cavity. The<br>
flow deflector(s) are provided at the radially inward end of the respective<br>
spaceblock. The forward facing or upstream flow deflector 188 is provided for<br>
increasing the amount of cooling fluid forced into the cavity, thereby<br>
increasing the coolant flow inside the cavity, to thereby increase heat removal<br>
from the respective cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, the upstream flow<br>
deflector extends in an upstream direction from the spaceblock a distance of<br>
at least about 20% and more preferably about 20 - 40% of the circumferential<br>
dimension of the respective cavity radially inner end. Further, in the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the flow deflector 188 extends downwardly, that is radially<br><br><br><br>
inwardly, so as to capture about one half of the radial dimension of the gap 37<br>
that is defined between the spaceblock and the spindle 16.<br>
More specifically, each upstream flow deflector includes a generally<br>
continuously curved upper surface 202 terminating at a radially inner edge<br>
204. As illustrated, the radially inner edge of the flow deflector, which defines<br>
a flow intercepting line along at least a portion of the depth of the spaceblock,<br>
extends below the radially inner surface of the spaceblock so as to intercept<br>
and redirect flow otherwise destined for the gap 37 between the spaceblock<br>
and the spindle 16. The surface 206 of the flow deflector downstream of the<br>
radially inner edge 204 defines a generally gradual transition to the radially<br>
inner surface of the respective spaceblock.<br>
To guide and direct the flow into the respective cavity and along the<br>
respective spaceblock, as shown by coolant flow arrows A, the curved upper<br>
surface 202 of the flow deflector 188 extends upwardly along the respective<br>
spaceblock upstream surface a distance greater than the distance by which<br>
the flow deflector extends below the spaceblock radially inner surface.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, each downstream flow deflector 190, like<br>
the upstream flow deflectors, extends in a downstream direction from the<br>
surface of the spaceblock a distance of at least about 20% and more<br>
preferably about 20 - 40% of the circumferential dimension of the respective<br>
cavity radially inner end. Further, in the illustrated embodiment, the flow<br>
deflectors 190 extend downwardly, that is radially inwardly, to a downstream<br>
edge 208 that is about one half of the radial dimension of the gap 37 that is<br>
defined between the spaceblock and the spindle, to guide and direct coolant<br>
flow thereto and around and about the downstream adjacent spaceblock<br>
radially inner end, as shown by coolant flow arrows B.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment, each flow deflector 188, 190 is<br>
provided to span a substantial portion of the depth or axial dimension of the<br>
cavity, for example, at least about 75% and more preferably on the order of<br><br><br>
100% of the depth of the cavity. In the alternative, however, each flow<br>
deflector can extend only a part depth or part axially of the spaceblock so as<br>
to leave at least one bypass flow region for flow to the next downstream<br>
adjacent cavity. According to this alternative, a partial depth flow deflector<br>
may be disposed to span the part depth of the cavity from adjacent one<br>
endwinding wall of the cavity, adjacent the other endwinding wall of the cavity,<br>
or generally centrally of its associated spaceblock. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, a single flow deflector 188, 190 is provided to span at least<br>
about one half of the depth of the associated spaceblock. According to a<br>
further alternate embodiment, two or more axially aligned flow deflectors may<br>
be provided, each spanning a portion of the axial dimension or depth of the<br>
cavity. In this manner, at least one bypass flow region is provided for flow to<br>
the next downstream adjacent cavity.<br>
In operation, rotor rotation will cause cooling gas to be drawn through<br>
the gas inlet 34 into the annular region 36 between the endwindings 28 and<br>
the rotor spindle 16. A kinetic pressure head will be present which will drive<br>
the cooling the gas to and along the flow deflector 188. Thus, referring to<br>
FIGURE 6, the cooling gas flows along the flow deflector 188 of spaceblock<br>
150 and along the upstream surface 192 of the spaceblock. At least a portion<br>
of that coolant gas flows into the flow-through passages 162, 160 defined in<br>
spaceblock 150. As noted above, the flow-through passages in this most<br>
upstream of the spaceblocks of the endwinding are advantageously disposed<br>
at an angle of less than 90 degrees with respect to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
spaceblock so that they are inclined. This facilitates flow radially outwardly<br>
into the downstream adjacent cavity 142.<br>
In addition to the coolant flow into cavity 142 through passages 160,<br>
162 in spaceblock 150, coolant flow is driven into and deflected into cavity<br>
142 from the annular region 36 as shown by arrow A therein. Because the<br>
deflector 188 intercepts flow that might otherwise continue into and through<br>
the gap 37 between the spaceblock 152 and spindle 16, the coolant flow<br><br><br><br>
through the respective cavity 152 is increased to thereby increase heat<br>
transfer. The coolant flow from passages 160, 162 flows generally<br>
circumferentiafly in the illustrated embodiment to spaceblock 152 where it<br>
flows into and through passages 164, 166, 168. As mentioned above, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment, spaceblock 152 has three flow-through passages, two<br>
164, 166 to receive flow from the central region and radially outer region of<br>
the cavity, and one 168 disposed to receive flow from the central and radially<br>
inner regions of the cavity. As is apparent, the generally circumferential flow<br>
provided in the illustrated embodiment substantially eliminates the coolant gas<br>
starved central and corner regions of the cavity 142 seen with the<br>
conventional circulatory flow.<br>
Referring to the next downstream adjacent cavity 144, once again, in<br>
addition to the coolant flow into the cavity through passages 164, 166, 168 in<br>
spaceblock 152, coolant flow is driven into and deflected into cavity 144 from<br>
the annular region 36 as shown by arrow A therein. Because the deflector<br>
188 intercepts flow that might otherwise continue into and through the gap 37<br>
between the spaceblock 154 and spindle 16, the coolant flow through the<br>
respective cavity is increased to thereby increase heat transfer. Meanwhile,<br>
the coolant flow from passages 164,166,168 flows generally circumferentially<br>
in the illustrated embodiment to spaceblock 154 where it flows into and<br>
through passages 170, 172, 174, 176, fn this embodiment, spaceblock 154<br>
has four passages, one 170 to receive flow from the radially outer region of<br>
the cavity, two 172,174 to receive flow generally from the central region of the<br>
cavity, and one 176 disposed to receive flow from the radially inner region of<br>
the cavity 144.<br>
Referring to the next downstream adjacent cavity 146, in the illustrated<br>
embodiment, coolant flow is generally limited to the coolant flow into the cavity<br>
through passages 170,172,174,176 in spaceblock 154, In this embodiment,<br>
the downstream spaceblock 156 has three passages 178, 180, 182, one 178<br>
to receive flow from the radially outer region of the cavity, and two 180,182 to<br><br><br>
receive flow generally from the central region of the cavity 146. Once again,<br>
the coolant flow from passages 170, 172, and 174 flows generally<br>
circumferentially in the illustrated embodiment to spaceblock where it flows<br>
into and through passages 1778, 180, 182. However, in the illustrated<br>
embodiment, at least a portion of the coolant flow from the radially innermost<br>
passage 176 flows along downstream flow deflector 190 into the annular<br>
region for flow under, around and about the radially inner end of spaceblock<br>
156.<br>
Finally, referring to the next downstream adjacent cavity 148, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment, coolant flow is generally limited to the coolant flow<br>
into the cavity through passages 178, 180, 182 in spaceblock 156. In this<br>
embodiment, the downstream spaceblock 158, as noted above, has two<br>
inclined passages 184, 186, one 184 to receive flow from the radially outer<br>
region of the cavity and one 186 to receive flow generally from the central<br>
region of the cavity. Once again, the coolant flow from passages 178, 180<br>
flows generally circumferentially in the illostrated embodiment to spaceblock<br>
158 where it flows into and through passages 184, 186. However, in the<br>
illustrated embodiment, at least a portion of the coolant flow from passage<br>
182 flows along downstream flow deflector 190 into the annular region 36 for<br>
flow under, around and about the radially inner end of spaceblock 158.<br>
As illustrated, the outlet flow from passages 184, 186 flows generally<br>
radially inwardly along the downstream surface 210 of spaceblock 158, and<br>
along flow deflector 190 into the annular region 36.<br>
It can thus be seen that with the combination of flow through the<br>
spaceblocks 150, 152, 154, 156, 158 and the deflectors 188, 190 to promote<br>
flow into the cavities 142, 144, 146, 148, increased coolant flow is provided,<br>
particularly to the normally coolant flow starved regions of the cavities,<br>
including the central regions and the radially outward regions of the cavities.<br><br><br><br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is<br>
presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is<br>
to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed<br>
