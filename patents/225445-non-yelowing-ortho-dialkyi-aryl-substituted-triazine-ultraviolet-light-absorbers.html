				<td>NON-YELLOWING ORTHO-DIALKYL ARYL SUBSTITUTED TRIAZINE<br>
ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT ABSORBERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The invention relates generally to novel pyrimidines and triazines ultraviolet<br>
light absorbers containing a phenolic aromatic group(s) and a non-phenolic aromatic<br>
group(s), wherein the non-phenolic aromatic group(s) are substituted with hydrocarbyl<br>
groups that are ortho to each other, and their use as protectants against degradation by<br>
environmental forces, including ultraviolet light, actinic radiation, oxygen, moisture,<br>
atmospheric pollutants, and combinations thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Exposure to sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet radiation is known to<br>
cause degradation of a variety of materials, especially polymeric materials. For example,<br>
polymeric materials such as plastics often discolor and may become brittle as a result of<br>
exposure to ultraviolet light. Accordingly, a large body of art has been developed directed<br>
towards materials such as ultraviolet light absorbers and stabilizers that are capable of<br>
inhibiting such degradation.<br>
 A class of materials known to be ultraviolet light absorbers are<br>
o-hydroxyphenyltriazines, in which at least one substituent on the 1, 3, or 5 carbon of the<br>
triazine ring is a phenyl group with a hydroxyl group ortho to the point of attachment to the<br>
triazine ring. In general this class of materials is well known in the art.<br>
 For example, United States Patent No. 3,843,371 discloses<br>
hydroxyphenyltriazines for use in photographic materials.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,896,125 discloses hydrbxyphenyl triazines light<br>
stabilizers for organic polymeric substrates.<br>
 The use of hydroxyphenyltriazines alone or in combination with other light<br>
stabilizers such as hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, benzophenones, oxanilides,<br>
cyanoacrylates, salicylates, and hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), for the<br>
stabilization of polymers is also well known. For example, United States Patent Nos.<br>
4,853,471, 4,921,966, 4,973,701, and 4,973,702 disclose such combinations.<br><br>
 Typically, the aforementioned aryl ring with the hydroxyl group ortho to the<br>
point of attachment to the triazine ring is based on resorcinol and, consequently, this aryl<br>
ring also contains a second substituent (either a hydroxyl group or a derivative thereof)<br>
para to the point of attachment to the triazine ring. For example, United states Patents No.<br>
3,118,837 and 3,244,708 disclose p-alkoxy-o-hydroxyphenyl triazines with improved UV<br>
protection.<br>
 This para- substituent can be "non-reactive," as in the case of an alkyloxy<br>
group, or "reactive" as in the case of a hydroxyalkyloxy (active hydrogen reactive site) or<br>
(meth)acryloyl (ethylenic unsaturation reactive site) group. For the purposes of the present<br>
invention, the former are referred to as "non-bondable" triazines and the latter are referred<br>
to as "bondable" triazines.<br>
 Low volatility is an important characteristic of stabilizers used in any<br>
applications where high temperatures are encountered. High temperatures are used in the<br>
processing of thermoplastics and in the curing of thermoset resins and coatings. High<br>
temperatures are also often present in the end-use applications of the stabilized material.<br>
Low volatility will prevent loss of the stabilizer during processing, curing, and high<br>
temperature end-uses, Besides reducing losses of stabilizer during processing or curing,<br>
low volatility will minimize processing problems such as die lip build-up and plate-out.<br>
 Many polymer additives (such as ultraviolet light stabilizers) migrate out of<br>
the polymer substrate to be protected, or are adsorbed (chemically or physically) by one or<br>
more systems components (such as pigments), thereby diminishing their effectiveness.<br>
Suc.h migration and adsorption problems are examples of the general problems of lack of<br>
solubility and compatibility found for many commercial polymer additives.<br>
 Bondable triazines are well known in the art. For example, United States<br>
Patent Nos, 3,423,360,4,962,142, and 5,189,084 disclose various bondable triazines and<br>
the incorporation of these compounds into polymers by chemical bonding. Bondable<br>
stabilizers have a potential advantage in that, depending on the bondable functionality and<br>
the particular polymer system to be stabilized, they can be chemically incorporated into a<br>
polymer structure via reaction of the bondable functionality either during polymer<br>
formation (such as in the case of polymerizing monomers or a crosslinking polymer<br>
system) or subsequently with a preformed polymer having appropriate reactive<br><br>
functionality. Accordingly, due to such bonding, migration of these UV absorbers between<br>
layers of multi-layer coatings and into polymer substrates is greatly reduced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 The invention provides a new class of triazine and pyrimidine ultraviolet<br>
light absorbers containing a phenolic aromatic group(s) and non-phenolic aromatic<br>
group(s), wherein the non-phenolic aromatic groups are substituted with at least two<br><br>
hydrocarbyl groups that are ortho to each other. The triazine and pyrimidine ultraviolet<br>
light absorbers of the invention can be monomeric or oligomeric.<br>
 The triazine and pyrimidine ultraviolet light absorbers of the invention, with<br>
ortho di-hydrocarbyl substituted aromatic rings, have the advantage of being highly soluble<br>
in and compatible with many polymers and coatings while being stable to environmental<br>
degradation that has led previous UV stabilizers to turn yellow and degrade with respect to<br>
performance as UV stabilizers. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that<br>
the improved solubility and compatibility of the triazines and pyrimidines of the invention<br>
is due to the presence of hydrocarbyl groups on the non-phenolic aromatic rings. It is,<br>
however, well known that triazines and pyrimidines that have hydrocarbyl groups on the<br>
non-phenolic aromatic rings are more prone to yellowing than triazines and pyrimidines<br>
without hydrocarbyl groups. The yellowing of triazines and pyrimidines having<br>
hydrocarbyl groups on the non-phenolic aromatic rings is attributed to oxidation of the<br>
hydrocarbyl groups. Thus, many triazines and pyrimidines avoid having hydrocarbyl<br>
groups on the non-phenolic aromatic rings even though thay have superior solubility and<br>
compatibility with many polymers. Surprisingly, however, it was found that triazines and<br>
pyrimidines having hydrocarbyl groups on the non-phenolic aromatic rings that are ortho to<br>
each other are less prone to thermal yellowing and yellowing on exposure to UV light<br>
compared to triazines and pyrimidines having hydrocarbyl groups on the aromatic rings<br>
that are not ortho to each other. Even more surprising is the discovery that, the<br>
performance of the triazines and pyrimidines of the invention at inhibiting thermal<br>
degradation and UV degradation is similar or superior to triazines or pyrimidines without<br>
hydrocarbyl groups on the aromatic rings.<br>
 The triazine and pyrimidine ultraviolet light absorbers have the following<br>
general structure (I):<br>
wherein Z can be a nitrogen or a methine and at least two Z are nitrogen, to form a<br>
pyrimidine<br><br>
or triazine ring; A is an aromatic benzene ring substituted with two hydrocarbyl groups that<br>
are ortho to each other; B is a resorcinol radical bound by a cyclic carbon atom directly to<br>
the pyrimidine or triazine ring; and C can be either A or B. Preferably C is A. Preferably<br>
each Z is a nitrogen.<br>

absorbers having di-ortho alkyl substituted aromatic rings have the formula (II):<br>

 Typically, the compounds of formula (II) to (V) or (XXXIV) are added to<br>
polymeric materials to inhibit or prevent one or more of thermal or photo-degradation or to<br>
protect from the effects of ultraviolet light by screening. By screening is meant that the<br>
compounds are included in a protective composition to filter ultraviolet light. The<br>
protective composition may be, for example, a cosmetic preparation or a glass or plexiglass<br>
window.. Therefore, it is preferable that one or more of R1, R2, R3, R4, L, D, or X' is<br>
chosen so as to improve the solubility of the compound of formula (II) to (V) or (XXXIV)<br>
in the polymeric material to which it is to be added. One of ordinary skill in the art can<br>
readily recognize what structures for R1, R2, R3, R4, L, D, or X' would improve solubility in<br>
a given polymeric material. For example, it is often preferable, that R1, R2, R3, R4, L, D, or<br>
X' is similar to, i.e., has the same functional groups, as the monomelic units of the<br>
polymeric material.<br>
 The substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the invention may optionally<br>
have the added benefit of being capable of being chemically bonded to appropriate polymer<br>
systems via a functionality attached to the alkylphenyl or pyrimidine or triazine groups<br>
(e.g., by a hydroxyl, ethylenic unsaturated and/or activated unsaturated group in one or<br>
more of R1, R2, R3, R4, Y, or Y').<br>
 The term "hydrocarbyl" in the context of the present invention, and in the<br>
above formulas, broadly refers to a monovalent hydrocarbon group in which the valency is<br>
derived by abstraction of a hydrogen from a carbon atom. Hydrocarbyl includes, for<br>
example, aliphatics (straight and branched chain), cycloaliphatics, aromatics and mixed<br>
character groups (e.g., aralkyl and alkaryl). Hydrocarbyl also includes such groups with<br>
internal unsaturation and activated unsaruration. More specifically, hydrocarbyl includes,<br>
but is not limited to, such groups as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, alkenyl,<br>
cycloalkenyl and alkynyl, preferably having up to 24 carbon atoms. A hydrocarbyl chain or<br>
ring may optionally be interrupted by one or more carbonyl groups (which is/are included<br>
in the carbon count) and/or heteroatoms (such as at least one oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen or<br><br>
silicon). A hydrocarbyl group may also have one or more hydrogens replaced with a<br>
substituent commonly found in organic molecules.<br>
 The phrase "substituent commonly found in organic molecules," as used<br>
herein means non-hydrocarbyl groups that are typically found in organic molecules<br>
including, but not limited to, halides, cyano groups, amino groups, thiol groups,<br>
carboxylate groups, hydroxyl groups, sulfonate groups, nitroso groups, nitro groups, and<br>
the like.<br>
 The term "functional hydrocarbyl" in the context of the present invention,<br>
and in the above formulas, broadly refers to a hydrocarbyl possessing pendant and/or<br>
terminal reactive and/or latent reactive functionality and/or leaving groups.<br>
 The term "reactive" functionality refers to functionality that is reactive with<br>
common monomer/polymer functionalites under normal conditions well understood by<br>
those of ordinary skill in the relevant art. As non-limiting examples of a reactive<br>
functionality may be mentioned active hydrogen containing groups such as hydroxyl,<br>
amino, carboxyl, thio, amido, carbamoyl, and activated methylene; isocyanato; cyano;<br>
epoxy; ethylenically unsaturated groups such as allyl and methallyl; and activated<br>
unsaturated groups such acryloyl and methacryloyl, and maleate and maleimido (including<br>
the Diels-Alder adducts thereof with dienes such as butadiene).<br>
 The term "latent reactive" functionality within the meaning of the present<br>
invention and, as would clearly be understood by those persons of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
refers to reactive functionality which is blocked or masked to prevent premature reaction.<br>
As examples of a latent reactive functionality may be mentioned ketimines and aldimines<br>
(amines blocked, respectively, with ketones and aldehydes); amine-carboxylate salts; and<br>
blocked isocyanates such as alcohol (carbamates), oxime, and caprolactam blocked<br>
variations.<br>
 A "leaving" group within the meaning of the present invention, as would<br>
clearly be understood by those persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art, is a substituent<br>
attached to the hydrocarbyl chain or ring which during reaction is dislodged or displaced to<br>
create a valency on a carbon or hetero atom in the hydrocarbyl chain or ring, said valency<br>
being filled by a nucleophile. As examples of leaving groups may be mentioned halogen<br>
atoms such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine; protonated hydroxyl groups; quaternary<br>
ammonium salts (NT4+); sulfonium salts (ST3+); and sulfonates (OSO3T); where T is, e.g.,<br><br>
methyl or para-tolyl. Of all these classes of reactive functionality, the preferred<br>
functionality includes hydroxyl, -COOR5, -CR6=CH2, -CO-CR6=CH2, Cl, an isocyanate<br>
group, a blocked isocyanate group and -NHR5, wherein<br>
R5 is selected from hydrogen and a hydrocarbyl (preferably of up to 24 carbon<br>
atoms); and<br>
R6 is selected from hydrogen and an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (preferably<br>
hydrogen and methyl).<br>
 The term "hydrocarbylene" in the context of the present invention is a<br>
divalent hydrocarbon group in which both valencies derive by abstraction of hydrogens<br>
from carbon atoms. Included within the definition of hydrocarbylene are the same groups<br>
as indicated above for hydrocarbyl and functional hydrocarbyl with, of course, the extra<br>
valency (for example, alkylene, alkenylene, arylene, alkylaryl, etc.).<br>
 The term "functional hydrocarbylene" in the context of the present invention<br>
refers to a species of hydrocarbylene possessing pendant reactive functionality, latent<br>
reactive functionality, and/or leaving groups. The term "non-functional hydrocarbylene' in<br>
the context of the present invention refers generally to a hydrocarbylene other than a<br>
functional hydrocarbylene.<br>
 The pyrimidines and triazines in accordance with the present invention also<br>
relate to latent stabilizing compounds against actinic radiation of the general formulas (II) -<br>
(V), wherein at least one of the hydroxyl groups on the aryl ring ortho to the point of<br>
attachment to the triazine or pyrimidine ring is blocked, that is, wherein at least one X is<br>
other than hydrogen. Such latent stabilizing compounds liberate the-effective stabilisers by<br>
cleavage of the O-X bond, e.g., by heating or by exposure to UV radiation. Latent<br>
stabilizing compounds are desirable because they have many favorable properties, i.e.,<br>
good substrate compatibility, good color properties, a high cleavage rate of the O-X bond,<br>
and a long shelf life. The use of latent stabilizing compounds is further described in United<br>
States Patent Nos. 4,775,707, 5,030,731, 5,563,224 and 5,597,854, which are incorporated<br>
herein for all purposes as if fully set forth.<br>
 Latent stabilizing compounds comprising pyrimidines and triazines in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be prepared from compounds of the general<br>
formulas (I) - (V), wherein at least one X is hydrogen, by subjecting said compounds to a<br><br>
further reaction to form latent stabilizing compounds, as described in the immediately<br>
preceding incorporated references.<br>
 As examples of blocking groups X may be mentioned one or more of the<br>
following groups: allyl, -CORa, -SO2Rb, -SiRcRdRe, -PRfRg or -PORfRg, -CONHRh,<br>
wherein<br>
each Ra is independently selected from C1-C„ alkyl, halogen-substituted C1-C8<br>
alkyl, C5-C12 cycloalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, -CH2-CO-CH3, C1-C12 alkoxy, and<br>
phenyl or phenoxy which is unsubstituted or substituted by C1-C12 alkyl,<br>

and C1-C18 alkoxy;<br>
each Rf and Rg is independently selected from C1-C12 alkoxy, C1-C12 alkyl, C5-C12<br>
cycloalkyl, and phenyl or phenoxy which is unsubstituted or substituted by<br>
C1-C12 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, halogen and/or benzyl; and<br>
each Rh is independently selected from C1-C8 alkyl, C5-C12 cycloalkyl, C2-C8<br>
alkenyl, -CH2-CO-CH3, and phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by<br>
C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, halogen and/or benzyl.<br>
The reaction to give the latent stabilizing compounds of the present<br>
invention of the general formula (I) through (V), in which X is allyl, -GORa. -SO2Rb,<br>
-SiRcRdRe, -PRfc8, or -PORfR8, can be carried but, for example;by reaction of me<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) through (IV), wherein at least one X is hydrogen with<br>
the corresponding halides such as allyl chloride, Cl-CORa, Cl-SO2Rb, Cl-SiRcRdRe,<br>
Cl-PRfRg, or Cl-PORfRg. The reaction to give the latent stabilizing compounds of the<br>
present invention of the general formulas (II) through (IV) in which X is -CONHRh can be<br>
carried out, for example, by reaction of the compounds of the general formulas (II) through<br>
(V), wherein at least one X is hydrogen with the corresponding isocyanates. Furthermore,<br>
acylated compounds can be obtained by reaction of the compounds of the general formulas<br>
(II) through (V), wherein at least one X is hydrogen with anhydrides, ketenes, or esters,<br>
such as lower alkyl esters, as is well known to one skilled in the art. The above-described<br>
reagents may be used in approximately equimolar amounts or in excess, for example, from<br><br>
2 to 20 mol with respect to the hydroxyl groups desired to be made latent in the starting<br>
compound of the general formula (II) through (V).<br>
 Catalysts customarily used for acylation, sulfonylation, phosphonylation,<br>
silylation, or urethanation reactions may be used in forming the latent stabilizing<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention. For example, acylation and<br>
sulfonylation reaction catalysts such as tertiary or quaternary amines including, but not<br>
limited to, triethylamine, dimethylaminopyridine, or tetrabutylammonium salts, may be<br>
used for forming these latent stabilizing compounds.<br>
 The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a solvent, such as<br>
relatively inert organics, e.g., hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride or chloroform, or ethers such as tetrahydrofuran<br>
or dibutyl ether, with or without a solvent. Alternatively, the reagent(s) may be employed<br>
as the solvent. The reaction temperature is usually between room temperature and about<br>
150°C, for example, up to the boiling point of the solvent when a solvent is used.<br>
 Further preferred embodiments may include any combination of the<br>
parameters mentioned above.<br>
Methods of Preparation<br>
 The triazines and pyrimidines having di-ortho hydrocarbyl substituted<br>
aromatic rings of the invention can be prepared by a Friedel-Crafts reaction of an aromatic<br>
moiety (XXX) with a halogen substituted triazine or pyrimidme-compound (XXXI)<br>
wherein each Z is independently nitrogen or methine, and at least two Z are nitrogen, as<br>
illustrated in Scheme I.<br>
Scheme I<br><br><br>
wherein the term "Lewis acid," as used herein, means any electron pair acceptor as is well<br>
known to those or ordinary skill in the art. Lewis acids include, but are not limited to,<br>
aluminum halides, alkylaluminum halides, boron halides, tin halides, titaniurn halides, lead<br>
halides, zinc halides, iron halides, gallium halides, arsenic halide, copper halides, cadmium<br>
halides, mercury halides, antimony halides, and the like. Preferred Lewis acids include<br>
aluminum trichloride, aluminum tribromide, trimethylaluminum, boron trifluoride, boron<br>
trichloride, zinc dichloride, titanium tetrachloride, tin dichloride, tin tetrachloride, or a<br>
mixture thereof; and Hal is bromine, chlorine, or iodine; and R1 and R2 are defined above<br>
and are attached to the aromatic moiety ortho to each other. Preferably, the Lewis acidis<br>
used with a promotor such as disclosed in WQ 00/29392, the contents of which are<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
 In compound (XXXIII) L, X, R3, and R4 are as defined above. Substitution<br>
of either L or X, or both for an alkyl group or hydroxy blocking group can be conducted<br>
before or after the second step. One of ordinary skill in the art with little or no<br>
experimentation can easily determine the conditions to substitute either L or X, or both.<br>
 The relative amounts of the reactants are as follows. The amount of<br>
compounds of Formula (XXXI) should be an amount sufficient to react with the aromatic<br><br>
compound of Formula (XXX) to produce compound of Formula (XXXII). The amount of<br>
aromatic compound of Formula (XXX) is important to ensure that a sufficient amount of<br>
aromatic compounds of Formula (XXXII) is synthesized without excessive amounts of<br>
undesired side products such as trisaryl triazine or trisaryl pyrimidine. Moreover, excess<br>
amounts of aromatic compounds can lead to undesired product distributions enriched in<br>
mono- and tris-aryl triazines, or mono- and tris-aryl pyrimidines thus, making product<br>
separation and purification difficult and resource consuming.<br>
 The amount of aromatic compounds (XXX) should be an amount sufficient<br>
to synthesize the 2-halo-4,6-bisaryl-l,3,5-triazine or 2-halo-4,6-bisarylpyrimidine.<br>
Preferably, there should be between about 1 to about 5 mol equivalents of aromatic<br>
compound of Formula (XXX) to compound of Formula (XXXI). Preferably, there should<br>
be between about 0.5 to about 2.5 mol equivalents of compound of Formula (XXXIII) to<br>
compounds of Formula (XXXII).<br>
 The amount of Lewis acid, used in the reaction should be an amount<br>
sufficient to transform the 2,4,6-trihalo-l,3,5-triazine or 2,4,6-trihalo-pyrimidine to the<br>
preferred 2-halo-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine or 2-halo-4,6 bisarylpyrimidine, respectively.<br>
The amount of Lewis acid should be between about 0.5 to about 500 mol equivalents.<br>
Preferably, the amount of Lewis acid should be between about 0.75 to about 10 mol<br>
equivalents, and most preferably between about 1 to about 5 mol equivalents.<br>
 The reaction should run for a sufficient amount of time, at a sufficient<br>
temperature and pressure to synthesize the desired triazine or pyrimidine compound. The<br>
preferred reaction time for the synthesis of compounds of Formula (XXXII), i.e., the first<br>
step, is between about 5 minutes and about 48 hours, more preferred between about 15<br>
minutes and about 24 hours. The preferred reaction time for the synthesis of compounds of<br>
Formula.(II), i.e,the second step, is between about 10 minutes and-about 24 hours, more<br>
preferably time is between about 30 minutes and about 12 hours. The reaction pressure is<br>
not critical and can be about 1 atm or higher if desired. Preferably, the reaction is carried<br>
out under an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. One of ordinary skill in the art with little<br>
or no experimentation can readily determine the optimum temperature to obtain the desired<br>
product. Representative reaction conditions for preparing the compounds of formula (II)<br>
are provided in the examples.<br><br>
 The reaction may be a step-wise process or a one-step process. As used<br>
herein, the term "step-wise" means a reaction sequence wherein a series of reactions are<br>
conducted, the first reaction producing compounds of Formula (XXXII) and being carried<br>
out to between about 50% to about 100% completion prior to addition of a compound of<br>
Formula (XXXIII) to produce compounds of Formula (II). Preferably the reaction is<br>
carried out to between about 70% to about 100% completion prior to addition of compound<br>
of Formula (XXXIII), and more preferably to between about 75% to about 100%<br>
completion.<br>
 The step-wise process comprises mixing at least one Lewis acid, and<br>
compounds of Formula (XXXI) with one or more of the desired aromatic compounds of<br>
Formula (XXX), preferably until the reaction is between about 70% to about 100%<br>
completed. Thereafter, the product of Formula (XXXII) is isolated and purified. The<br>
aromatic compound of Formula (XXXIII) is then added to the purified product of Formula<br>
(XXXII) along with a Lewis acid to synthesize the compounds of Formula (II). The<br>
step-wise sequence allows for the isolation, purification, and storage of compounds of<br>
Formula (XXXII) prior to subsequent reaction with aromatic compounds of Formula<br>
(XXXIII).<br>
 Compounds of the formula (XXXII) are novel intermediates that can be<br>
used to prepare the triazine or pyrirmidine compounds of the invention. Thus, the present<br>
invention is also directed to the 2-halo-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine and<br>
2-halo-4,6-bisarylpyrimidine of structure (XXXII) wherein the aryl groups have two<br>
hydrocarbyl groups that are ortho to each other.<br>
 To synthesize compounds of Formula (II) the preferred addition time of the<br>
aromatic compound of Formula (XXXIII) to the reaction mixture is between about 5<br>
minutes to about 10-hours, more preferred addition time is between about 10 minutes to<br>
about 5 hours, and most preferred addition time is between about 15 minutes to about 2<br>
hours.<br>
 The Lewis acid should be present in amounts sufficient to react with the<br>
number of halogens being substituted on compounds of Formula (XXXI). A range of<br>
between about 1 to about 5 mol equivalents of Lewis acid can be used. The preferred<br>
Lewis acid is aluminum chloride. A preferred amount of Lewis acid is between about 2 to<br>
about 4 mol equivalents to halo-triazine or halo-pyrimidine.<br><br>
 The synthesis of compounds of Formula (III), (IV), or (V) can be performed<br>
by methods commonly known in the art. One of ordinary skill in the art with little or no<br>
experimentation can determine the appropriate conditions to obtain the polymer product<br>
desired.<br>

 Among polymeric compounds, preference is given to the polycarbonates,<br>
polyesters, polyamides, polyacetals, polyphenylene oxides, and polyphenylene sulfides. In<br>
particular the novel triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can be used to stabilize<br>
aliphatic polyamides, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates.<br>
 The novel triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can also be used with<br>
aliphatic polyamide polymers. An "aliphatic polyamide" is a polyamide characterized by<br>
the presence of recurring carbonamide groups as an integral part of the polymer chain<br>
whichare separated from one another by at least two aliphatic carbon atoms. Illustrative of<br>
these polyamides are those having recurring monomelic units represented by the general<br>
formula:<br>
-NHC(O)RC(0)NHR1 - or -NH-R-C(O)<br>
or a combination hereof in which R and R1 are the same or different and are alkylene<br>
groups of at least about two carbon atoms, preferably alkylene having from about 2 to<br>
about 12 carbon atoms. Exemplary of such polyamides are polyamides formed by the<br>
reaction of diamines and diacids such as poly (tetramethylene adipamide)(nylon 4,6),<br>
poly(hexamethylene adipamide) (nylon 6,6), poly (hexamcthylene azelamide) (nylon 6,9),<br>
poly(hexamethylene sebacamide) (nylon 6,10), poly(heptamethylene pimelamide) (nylon<br><br>
8,8), poly(nonamethylene azelamide) (nylon 9,9), poly(decamethylene azelamide) (nylon<br>
10,9), and the like. Also illustrative of useful aliphatic polyamides are those formed by<br>
polymerization of amino acids and derivatives thereof, as for example lactams. Illustrative<br>
of these useful polyamides are poly(4-aminobutyric acid) (nylon 4), poly(6-aminohexanoic<br>
acid) (nylon 6), poly(7-aminoheptanoic acid) (nylon 7), poly(8-aminoocatanoic acid)<br>
(nylon 8), poly(9aminononanoic acid) (nylon 9), poly(10-aminodecanoic acid) (nylon 10),<br>
poly(11-aminoundecanoic acid) (nylon 11), poly(12-aminododecanoic acid) (nylon 12),<br>
and the like. Blends of two or more aliphatic polyamides may also be employed.<br>
 Copolymers formed from any combination of the recurring units of the<br>
above referenced aliphatic polyamides can be used. By way of illustration and not<br>
limitation, such aliphatic polyamide copolymers include caprolactam/hexamethylene<br>
adipamide copolymer (nylon 676,6), hexamethylene adipamide/caprolactam copolymer<br>
(nylon 6, 6/6), hexamethylene adipamide/hexamemylene-azelamide copolymer (nylon<br>
6,6/6,9), and copolymers formed from recurring units of the above referenced aliphatic<br>
polyamides with aliphatic/aromatic polyamide recurring units may also be used. Examples<br>
of such copplyamides are nylon 6/6T; nylon 6,6/6, T; nylon 6/10T; nylon 6/12T; nylon<br>
6,10/6,T etc.<br>
 Preferred aliphatic polyamides for use in-the practice of this invention are<br>
poly(caprolactam), poly(7-aminoheptanic acid), poly(tetramethylene adipamide),<br>
poly(hexamethylene adipamide), and mixtures thereof. The particularly preferred aliphatic<br>
polyamides are poly(caprolatam), poly(hexamethylene adipamide), poly(tetramethylene<br>
adipamide), and mixtures thereof.<br>
 Aliphatic polyamides useful in the practice of this invention may be<br>
obtained from commercial sources or prepared in accordance with known preparatory<br>
techniques. For example, polycaprolactam may be obtained from Honeywell Inc. of<br>
Morristown, NJ and poly(hexamethylene adipamide) may be obtained from E.I. DuPont De<br>
Nemours and Company Inc. of Wilmington, DE.<br>
 The number average molecular weight of the aliphatic polyamide may vary<br>
widely. Usually, the aliphatic polyamide is of film forming molecular weight that is<br>
sufficiently high to form a free standing film and sufficiently low to allow melt processing<br>
of the blend into a film. Such number average molecular weights are well known to those<br>
of skill in the film art and are usually at least about 5,000 as determined by the formic acid<br><br>
viscosity method. In this method, a solution of 9.2 wt. concentration of aliphatic<br>
polyamide in 90% formic acid at 25°C is used. In the preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, the number average molecular weight of the aliphatic polyamide is from about<br>
5,000 to about 1,000,000 and in the particularly preferred embodiments is from about<br>
10,000 to about 100,000. Amongst the particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred<br>
are those in which the molecular weight of the aliphatic polyamide is from about 20,000 to<br>
about 40,000.<br>
 Polyurethane (PUR) elastomer products ("spandex") can be stabilized<br>
against discoloration and loss of elasticity during UV light exposure with combinations of<br>
UV absorbers according to the invention and hindered amine light stabilizers. Spandex<br>
fibers is a PUR elastomer product, which requires very specific UV absorber and hindered<br>
amine light stabilizers properties in order to achieve optimum performance. UV absorbers<br>
of the triazine class of mis invention can be combined with polymeric hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers (HALS) to provide outstanding performance in achieving the desired properties<br>
for the Spandex fiber applications.<br>
 The triazine UV absorber of the invention, used alone or in combination<br>
with HALS provides the following properties in the Spandex fiber application: (1) low<br>
color contribution at typical use levels in the range of about 0.5-2.0%; (2) sufficient MW,<br>
thermal stability and low volatility for fiber processing and thermal exposure conditions;<br>
(3) high compatibility and permanence; (4) prevent discoloration and loss of elasticity<br>
during exposure to UV light energy; (5) low extraction by water and dry cleaning solvents;<br>
(6) low color development during exposure to atmospheric pollutants, NOx, SOx,<br>
hydrocarbons, etc.; (7) low interaction with sea water and pool chemicals; (8) low<br>
interaction and color development with typical phenolic antioxidants used for the thermal<br>
stabilization of Spandex fibers; and (9) low interaction with copper based antioxidant<br>
systems used in Nylon fibers for Nylon/Spandex fabrics.<br>
 The triazine UV absorber with or without the polymeric HALS provides<br>
outstanding stabilization with minimum negative effect on secondary performance<br>
properties, such as low color development during NOx exposure and low interaction with<br>
copper based antioxidant systems using in Nylon fibers.<br><br>
As noted above, any of the triazine compounds disclosed herein can be used<br>
to impart one or more of the properties described above to Spandex fibers when added<br>
thereto in a stabilization effective amount.<br>
Preferably, these triazine compounds are added in combination with<br>
polymeric HALS. The polymeric HALS is preferably poly[(6-morpholino-s-triazine-2,4-<br>
diyl)[2,2,6,6,-tetramemyl-4-pipridyl)imino]-hexamethylene[(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-<br>
piperidyl)imino]]. Most preferably, the polymeric HALS is the methylated (M) version of<br>
the above HALS, which is sold by Cytec Industries, Inc. of West Paterson, N.J. as<br>
CYASORB®UV-3529 light stabilizer. Other polymeric HALS disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
4,331,586 are also suitable.<br>
Spandex fibers are made from a polyurethane (PUR) prepolymer prepared<br>
from a diisocyanate and a glycol. There are four basic processes used to convert the PUR<br>
prepolymer into the fiber product These processes are Solution Dry Spinning, Solution<br>
Wet Spinning, Melt Extrusion, and Reaction Spinning. The above UV stabilizer alone or<br>
in combination with HALS would be suitable for use in any or all four processes.<br>
Spandex fibers may contain a processing antioxidant system, such as a<br>
phenolic antioxidant, or a phenolic/phosphite antioxidant combination. In addition,<br>
pigments, such as TiO2 are commonly used in the fiber products.<br>
The triazine UV absorber alone or with M-HALS can be dissolved into<br>
DMF or DMAC and added to the PUR prepolymer solution prior to solution fiber spinning<br>
processes. Also, the combination can be extrusion compounded into the PUR compound<br>
used in the melt spinning process.<br>
Preferred polycarbonates are understood to be those polymers the<br>
constitutional repeating unit of which corresponds to the formula:<br><br>
wherein A is a divalent phenolic radical. Examples of A are given inter alia in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,960,863 and DE-A-3 922,496. A can be derived, for example, from hydroquinone,<br>
resorcinol, dihydroxybiphenylene, or bisphenols in the broadest sense of the term, such as<br>
bis(hydroxyphenyl)alkanes, cycloalkanes, sulfides, ethers, ketones, sulfones, sulfoxides,<br><br>
?,?'-bis(hydroxyphenyl)-diisopropylbenzenes, for example the compounds 2,2-bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane, 2,2-bis(3,5-<br>
dichIoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, or from the<br>
compounds of the formula:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 In one embodiment, the preferred resins are polycarbonates based on<br>
dihydric phenols such as 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (bisphenol A), 2,4-bis (4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylbutane, 1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-cyclohexane, 2,2-bis-(3-<br>
chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol, and 1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
3,3,5 -trimethylcyclohexane.<br>
 Also preferred are polycarbonate copolymers incorporating two or more<br>
phenols, branched polycarbonates wherein one or more polyfunctional aromatic<br>
compounds is reacted with the dihydric phenol(s) and carbonate precursor, and polymer<br>
blends of which polycarbonate comprises a significant portion of the blend.<br>
 U.S. Patent No. 5,288,788 describes polycarbonates and polyester<br>
carbonates, especially aromatic polycarbonates, for example those based on 2,2-bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propane or 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane.<br>
 The novel pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention can also be<br>
employed in multilayer systems. In such systems, a polymer composition having from<br>
about 0.1 to 20 percent by weight and preferably having a relatively high content of the<br>
novel pyrimidines and triazines of the invention, for example, from about 5 to 15 percent<br>
by weight, is applied in a thin film (typically between about 5 to 500 ?m and preferably<br>
from about 10 to 100 ?m thick) to a shaped article made from a polymer containing little or<br>
no ultraviolet stabilizers. Such composition may be applied at the same time as the shaping<br>
of the base structure, for example by coextrusion. Alternatively, application can also be<br>
made to the ready-formed base structure, for example by lamination with a film or by<br>
coating with a solution. The outer layer or layers of the finished article have the function<br>
of a UV filter, which protects the interior of the article from UV light. The outer layer<br>
preferably contains about 0.1 to 20 percent, preferably about 1 to 15 percent and more<br>
preferably about 2 to 10 percent by weight of the outer layer composition, of at least one of<br>
the pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention.<br>
 British Patent Application No. 2,290,745 describes a number of methods<br>
that have been developed to concentrate UV absorbers near or at the surface of polymeric<br>
materials. These include surface impregnation (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,309,220,<br>
3,043,709,4,481,664 and 4,937,026) and coating a plastic article with solutions containing<br>
thermoplastic resins and UV absorbers (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,668,588 and<br>
4,353,965). Both techniques suffer from drawbacks including requiring additional<br><br>
processing steps (i.e. applying, drying or curing), and encounter difficulties associated with<br>
the handling of large processed articles. An additional drawback, particularly relevant to<br>
polycarbonate sheet production, is the detrimental effect such post addition treatment<br>
would have on the surface of the polymeric substrate.<br>
 As described in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,872, application of surface layers<br>
via coextrusion takes place in a known manner in known coextrusion equipment as taught<br>
in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,487,505 and 3,557,265. Coextrusion is a well recognized method of<br>
producing laminated thermoplastic materials by simultaneously extruding various numbers<br>
of layers which form a single composite material. U.S. Patent No. 4,540,623 describes<br>
coextruded materials of at least forty layers. Other methods produce as few as two or three<br>
different layers.<br>
 The novel triazines and pyrimidines of the invention may be incorporated<br>
into the thermoplastics of the surfaces layer by standard methods such as dry mixing the<br>
additives with granular resin prior to extruding. The layer including the triazines and<br>
pyrimidines of the invention may be applied to one or both sides of the thermoplastic<br>
article.<br>
 Laminated thermoplastic articles which contain additional layers such as a<br>
water resistant layeras found in U.S. Pat. No. 4;992,322 are also part of the present<br>
invention.<br>
 The core layer and the coating layer may be the same or different<br>
thermoplastic resin including polyesters, polyester carbonates, polyphenylene oxide,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polypropylene, polyethylene,polyacrylates,<br>
polymethacrylates and copolymers and blends such as styrene and acrylonitrile on<br>
polybutadiene and styrene with maleic anhydride, and mixtures (polyblends) of such<br>
polymers with one another or with other polymers, for example with polyolefins,<br>
polyacrylates, polydienes or other elastomers in the form of impact strength modifiers.<br>
 The novel triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can also be chemically<br>
bonded to substrates, such as polymers, thereby greatly reducing the migration of such UV<br>
absorbers, e.g., out of the substrate or away from the substrate surface. The bonding<br>
mechanism of the triazines of the present invention involves the formation of a bond<br>
(chemical and/or co-valent) between a reactive or latent functionality attached to the<br><br>
triazine or pyrimidine molecule, e.g., by a pendant vinyl or hydroxyl group, and the "host"<br>
substrate, such as a polymer.<br>
 Incorporation of the triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can be<br>
brought about by copolymerization, copolyaddition, copolycondensation, by reaction with a<br>
polymer which carries suitable functional groups, or by grafting, in a manner as disclosed<br>
in United States Patent Nos. 3,423,360 and 5,189,084 which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference as if fully set forth.<br>
 Bonding of the triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can occur by<br>
polymerization or copolymerization. In the case of the novel triazines of the present<br>
invention comprising pendant vinyl groups, polymerization or copolymerization with at<br>
least one vinyl monomer, e.g., (meth)acrylic acid, esters of (meth)acrylic acid such as<br>
methyl acrylate, amides of (meth)acrylic acid, hydroxyethylacrylate, olefins, vinyl chloride,<br>
styrene, butadiene, isoprene and acrylonitrile can be carried out to form homopolymers or<br>
copolymers in which the vinyl group is incorporated into the backbone of the polymer.<br>
Polymerization or copolymerization can be initiated by initiators, such as free radical,<br>
anionic and cationic types, or by actinic radiation, such as UV, electron beam, x-rays and<br>
gamma irradiation from a Co60 source, as is well known to those in the polymerization art.<br>
Polymerization or copolymerization can be carried out in solution, in an emulsion, in a<br>
dispersion, in the melt, or in the solid state as is well known to those in the polymerization<br>
art.<br>
Also, bonding of the triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can be<br>
brought about by copolyaddition or copolycondensation. Such incorporation can be made<br>
by addition during the synthesis of an addition polymer or copolymer or by condensation<br>
during the synthesis of a condensation polymer or copolymer by methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art. For example, compounds of the formulas (II) - (V) containing the<br>
appropriate functional groups can be incorporated into polyesters, polyamides,<br>
polyurethanes, epoxy resins, melamine resins, alkyd resins, phenolic resins, polyurethanes,<br>
polycarbonates, polysiloxanes, polyacetals and polyanhydrides, to name but a few.<br>
In addition, compounds of the formulas (II) - (V) can be bonded to a<br>
monomeric component which is then incorporated into a polymer or copolymer, e.g., by the<br>
free radical initiated addition or copolycondensation methods described above. Analogous<br>
methods are disclosed in, for example, United States Patent No. 5,459,222 (incorporated by<br><br>
reference herein for all purposes as if fully set forth) for the bonding of benzotriazole and<br>
benzophenone stabilizers to diol precursors which are then incorporated by condensation<br>
polymerization into polyurethanes and polyesters to impart UV stabilizing properties to<br>
said polymers.<br>
 Alternately, the triazines and pyrimidines of the invention may also be<br>
bonded to polymers by reaction with an oligomer and/or polymer which carries suitable<br>
functional groups. For example, at least one triazine or primidine compound comprising a<br>
vinyl pendant group can be added, optionally with at least one other vinyl monomer or<br>
compound comprising a vinyl group, to unsaturated polyester resins, unsaturated<br>
polybutadiene oligomers or unsaturated rubbers and then cured by actinic radiation or by a<br>
free radical catalyst. Or, at least one triazine or pyrimidine compound comprising a<br>
terminal functional group, such as hydroxyl or amido, may be reacted with a polymer<br>
and/or oligomer such as polyesters, polyurethanes and polydiols with reactive end-groups,<br>
partially hydrolyzed polyvinylacetate, epoxy resins, polysiloxanes, and polymers<br>
comprising maleic anhydride, either in the main chain or as a side-chain; by methods<br>
analogous to those well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
 Grafting is yet another way of bonding of the triazines and pyrimidines of<br>
the invention to polymers and/or oligomers. Grafting may be carried out in solution, in the<br>
melt, or in the solid state with the initiators or actinic radiation types discussed above for<br>
polymerization when, for example, the novel triazines and pyrimidines of the invention<br>
comprising pendant vinyl groups are used. Such substituted pyrimidines and triazines may<br>
be grafted to saturated polymers, e.g., polyolefins and their copolymers such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene and poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate), or to polymers comprising<br>
unsaturated moieties, e.g., polybutadiene, polyisoprene, ethylene-propylene-(diene<br>
monomer) terpolymers, and polystyrene and its copolymers.<br>
 The triazines and pyrimidines of the invention may be used in widely<br>
varying amounts in such applications depending upon such things as the material to be<br>
stabilized and the particular application. However, when employed as a stabilizing<br>
additive for materials such as organic polymers, the substituted pyrimidines and triazines of<br>
the invention are typically employed in amounts from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight,<br>
preferably from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, and most preferably from about 0.1 to<br>
about 5% by weight, based on the weight of the material to be stabilized. In screening<br><br>
applications such as sunscreening compositions, the triazines and pyrimidines are utilized<br>
in the same relative amounts but based on the total weight of the screening agent.<br>
 The novel stabilizers of the present invention may also be employed in a<br>
non-bondable capacity, for example, in the stabilization of thermoplastic polymers as set<br>
forth in the many of the previously incorporated references. Examples of preferred<br>
thermoplastic polymers are polyolefins and polymers comprising heteroatoms in the main<br>
chain. Preferred thermoplastic polymers are thermoplastic polymers comprising nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and/or sulphur, especially nitrogen or oxygen, in the main chain. Also of interest<br>
are compositions in which the polymer is a polyolefin, for example polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene.<br>
 Incorporation into the thermoplastic polymers can be carried out by addition<br>
of the novel triazines and pyrimidines and any further additives by methods conventional in<br>
the art. The incorporation can expediently be made before or during shaping, for example<br>
by mixing the pulverulent components or by adding the stabilizer to the melt or solution of<br>
the polymer, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compounds to the polymer, with or<br>
without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. Elastomers can also be stabilized as<br>
lattices.<br>
 The novel mixtures can also be added to the polymers to be stabilized in the<br>
form of a masterbatch or concentrate which comprises these compounds, for example, in a<br>
concentration of from about 1 to about 50%, preferably from about 3 to about 25%, and<br>
most preferably from about 5 to about 20% by weight of a polymeric resin.<br>
 The novel fixtures can expediently be incorporated into me polymeric<br>
material by any number of methods, including those conventionally employed in the art,<br>
including by, for example: a) as an emulsion or dispersion (for example to lattices or<br>
emulsion polymers); (b) as a dry mix during mixing of additional components or polymer<br>
mixtures; (c) by direct addition to the processing equipment (for example extruders,<br>
internal mixers, etc.); or (d) as a solution or melt.<br>
 The stabilized polymer compositions obtained in this way can be converted<br>
into shaped articles, for example fibers, films, tapes, sheets, sandwich boards, containers,<br>
pipes, and other profiles, by any number of conventional methods, for example hot<br>
pressing, spinning, extrusion, roto-molding, or injection molding. Therefore, the present<br><br>
invention additionally relates to the use of the polymer composition according to the<br>
invention for the production of a shaped article.<br>
Depending upon their ultimate end use, the triazines and pyrimidines of the<br>
invention may be combined with a variety of additives conventionally employed in the UV<br>
stabilizing art. Examples of such additives include but are not limited to:<br>
a. Antioxidants<br>
(i) Alkylated monophenols such as 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol; 2-tert-butyl-4,6-<br>

 The novel triazines and pyrimidines of the invention can also be employed<br>
in multilayer systems. In such systems, a polymer composition having a relatively high<br>
content of novel stabilizer, for example, from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight and<br>
preferably about 5-15% by weight, is applied in a thin film (e.g., about 5 - 500 ?m thick<br>
and, preferably, about 10 - 100 ?m thick) to a shaped article made from a polymer<br>
containing little or no ultraviolet stabilizers. Such composition may be applied at the same<br>
time as the shaping of the base structure, for example by coextrusion in a manner<br>
analogous to that described in United States Patent No. 4,948,666 (incorporated by<br>
reference herein for all purposes as if fully set forth). Alternatively, application can also be<br>
made to the ready-formed base structure, for example by lamination with a film or by<br>
coating with a solution. The outer layer or layers of the finished article have the function<br>
of a UV filter, which protects the interior of the article from UV light. The outer layer<br>
typically contains about 0.1 to about 20%, preferably about 1 to about 15%, and more<br><br>
preferably about 2 to about 10% by weight of the outer layer composition, of at least one of<br>
the substituted pyrimidine or triazine compound of the present invention.<br>
 The polymers stabilized in this way are notable for high weathering<br>
resistance, especially for high resistance to UV light. This enables them to retain their<br>
mechanical properties, and their color surface properties such as gloss and distinctness of<br>
image, for a long time even when used outside. Moreover, due to the bondable nature of<br>
the presently claimed triazine and pyrimidine compounds, migration of these UV absorbers<br>
between the layers of the multi-layer coatings can, under the appropriate circumstances, be<br>
minimized.<br>
 In another embodiment of the present invention, the novel mixtures comprising<br>
compounds of the formulas (II) - (V) can be used as stabilizers for coatings, for example<br>
for paints such as disclosed in numerous references (see, e.g., US 4,619,956, US 4,740,542,<br>
US 4,826,978, US 4,962,142, US 5,106,891, US 5,198,498, US 5,298,067, US 5,322,868,<br>
US 5,354,794, US 5,369,140, US 5,420,204, US 5,461,151, US 5,476,937, EP-0434608<br>
and EP-A-0444323). Of particular interest are coatings and paints for the automobile<br>
industry. The invention therefore also relates to those compositions which are film-<br>
forming binders for coatings. "Coating" means a free flowing composition that can be<br>
applied to the surface of an article in a thin film that then hardens to form a substantially<br>
solid surface on the article. Typically, the coating provides an interface between the article<br>
and the environment.<br>
 Such novel coating compositions comprise about 0.01 to about 20%,<br>
preferably about 0.1 to about 10%, and more preferably about 0.2 to about 10% by weight<br>
of the binder of the coating composition of one or more of the novel triazines and<br>
pyrimidines of the invention.<br>
 Multilayer systems are possible here as well (such as<br>
electrocoat/basecoat/clearcoat systems), where the concentration of the novel stabilizer in<br>
one or more of the layers, and typically the outer layer such as the clearcoat, can be<br>
relatively high, for example from about 0.01 to about 20%, preferably about 0.1 to about<br>
10%, and more preferably about 0.2 to about 5% by weight of binder.<br>
 The use of the novel stabilizer in coatings is accompanied by the additional<br>
advantage that it prevents delamination, i.e. the flaking-off of the coating from the<br>
substrate. This advantage is particularly important in the case of metallic substrates,<br><br>
including multilayer systems on metallic substrates, and particularly epoxy e-coated<br>
metallic substrates.<br>
The coatings typically include a binder that suspends pigments and other<br>
additives in the coating and allows attachment of the coating to the substrate.<br>
The binder can in principle be any binder which is customary in industry,<br>
for example those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th<br>
Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991 which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In general, it is a film-forming binder based on a thermoplastic or curable resin,<br>
predominantly on a curable resin. Examples of thermoplastic binders include acrylics,<br>
polyesters, polyurethanes, and PVC plastisols. Examples of curable binders include<br>
functional alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
 Such curable binders can be an ambient curable or a thermosetting binder.<br>
Further, in some systems it may be advantageous to add a curing catalyst to such systems.<br>
Suitable catalysts which accelerate curing of the binder are described, for example, in<br>
Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A18, p. 469, VCH<br>
Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim 1991. Preferred binders include those which comprise a<br>
functional acrylate resin and a crosslinking agent.<br>
 A wide variety of binders may be employed in such coating systems. In<br>
particular, the binder may comprise an alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine,<br>
epoxy, polyurethane resin, or blends thereof. Examples of such binders include, but are not<br>
limited to:<br>
(a) cold- or hot-crosslinkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine<br>
resins or mixtures of such resins;<br>
(b) a two-component polyurethane system comprising hydroxyl-containing<br>
acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates.<br>
isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
(c) a one-component polyurethane system comprising blocked isocyanates,<br>
isocyanurates or polyisocyanates which are deblocked during baking;<br>
(d) a two-component system comprising (poly)ketimines and aliphatic or<br>
aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>

acrylate resin or a polyacetoacetate resin or a methacrylamidoglycolate<br>
methyl ester;<br>
(f) a two-component system comprising carboxyl- or amino-containing<br>
polyacrylates and polyepoxides;<br>
(g) a two-component system comprising acrylate resins containing anhydride<br>
groups and on a polyhydroxy or polyamino component;<br>
(h) a two-component system comprising (poly)oxazolines and acrylate resins<br>
containing anhydride groups, or unsaturated acrylate resins, or aliphatic or<br>
aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
(i) a two-component system comprising unsaturated polyacrylates and<br>
polymalonates;<br>
(j) a thermoplastic polyacrylate system comprising thermoplastic acrylate<br>
resins or externally crosslinking acrylate resins in combination with<br>
etherified melamine resins; and<br>
(k) a system comprising siloxane-modified or fluorine-modified acrylate resins.<br>
Such binder-containing compositions may further comprise a curing catalyst, or an organic<br>
solvent, and may be radiation-curable. In particular, such compositions may serve as<br>
coating compositions.<br>
 Examples of suitable coating compositions containing specific binders<br>
include but are not limited to:<br>
1. paints based on ambient curable or thermosetting alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy<br>
or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, if desired with addition of a curing catalyst;<br>
2. two-component polyurethane paints based on hydroxyl-containing acrylate,<br>
polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or<br>
polyisocyanates;<br>
3. one-component polyurethane paints based on blocked isocyanates, isocyanurates or<br>
polyisocyanates which are deblocked during baking;<br>
4. two-component paints based on (poly)ketimines and aliphatic or aromatic<br>
isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>

polyepoxides;<br>
7. two-component paints based on acrylate resins containing anhydride groups and on<br>
a polyhydroxy or polyamino component;<br>
8. two-component paints based on (poly)oxazolines and acrylate resins containing<br>
anhydride groups, or unsaturated acrylate resins, or aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates,<br>
isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
9. two-component paints based on unsaturated polyacrylates and polymalonates;<br>
10. thermoplastic polyacrylate paints based on thermoplastic acrylate resins or<br>
externally crosslinlcing acrylate resins in combination with etherified melamine resins;<br>
11. paint systems based on siloxane-modified or fluorine-modified acrylate resins.<br>
 In addition to the binder and one or more triazine or pyrimidine of the<br>
invention, the coating composition according to the invention preferably further comprise<br>
one or more additional ultraviolet light absorbers including, but not limited to, those<br>
specifically listed above in section b. The additional UV absorbers may be, for example,<br>
another tris-aryl-1,3,5-triazine, a 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole, a 2-<br>
hydroxybenzophenone, an ester of an unsubstituted benzoic acid, an acrylate, an oxamide<br>
(oxanilide), or any combination of the above. Preferably, the additional UV absorber is a<br>
2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole and the weight ratio of benzotriazole to triazine or<br>
pyrimidine is from about 4:1 to 1:4. More preferably, the weight ratio of benzotriazole to<br>
triazine or pyrimidine is from about 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
 To achieve maximum light stability, it is of particular interest to add<br>
sterically hindered amines, examples of which are set out in the above-mentioned section<br>
b(vi). The invention therefore also relates to a coating composition which, in addition to<br>
the binder, the one or more triazine or pyrimidine of the invention, and, optionally,<br>
additional UV absorbers, comprises a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type.<br>
The sterically hindered amine is employed in an amount of about 0.01 to 5% by weight<br>
based on the weight of the solid binder, preferably about 0.02 to 2% by weight.<br>
One specific example of such a sterically hindered amine is a 2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethyl piperazinone containing at least one group of the formula:<br><br><br>
in which J is, for example, hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl (such as methyl), alkoxy (such as<br>
methoxy) or acyl.<br>
 More preferably the stabilizer is a 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine derivative<br>
containing at least one group of the formula:<br><br>
in which J is, for example, hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl (such as methyl), alkoxy (such as<br>
methoxy) or acyl.<br>
 Examples of tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives which can be used in<br>
combination with the present trisaryl-l,3,5-triazine compounds are given in United States<br>
Patent Nos. 4,314,933,4,344,876,4,426,471, 4,426,472, 4,619.956, 5,004,770, 5,006,577,<br>
5,064,883, 5,112,890, 5,124,378,5,106,891, 5,204,473, and 5,461,151, which are<br>
incorporated by reference herein for all purposes as if fully set forth. It is particularly<br>
expedient to employ the following tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives, as well as their N-alkyl,<br>
N-acyl, N-hydroxyl and N-alkoxy analogs (where not already included in the following<br>
list):<br>
bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) succinate, bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperid-4-yl)<br>
sebacate,<br>
bis( 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperid-4-yl) sebacate, di( 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperid-4-yl)<br>

tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) sebacate, tetra(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) butane-1,2,3,4-<br>
tetracarboxylate, tetra( 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperid-4-yI) butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate,<br>
2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-oxa-3,20-diaza-21-oxo-dispiro[5.1.11.2]heneicosane, and 8-acetyl-3-<br>
dodecyl-l,3,8-triaza-7,7,9,9-tetramethylspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione. Commercially<br>
available examples of these and other tetraalkylpipieridine derivatives include<br>
SANDUVOR® 3050, 3052, 3055, 3056, 3058, PR-31 and PR-32 (Clariant Corp.);<br>
TINUVIN® 079L, 123, 144, 292, 440L and 622LD (Ciba Specialty Chemicals);<br><br>
CHIMASORB® 119 and 944 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals); and CYASORB® UV-3346,<br>
UV 3529, UV-3853, UV-500 and UV-516 (Cytec Industries Inc.).<br>
 In addition, as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, to be<br>
suitable for coating compositions, the coating composition can also comprise further<br>
components including, but not limited to, solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, stabilizers,<br>
thixotropic agents, drying catalysts and/or leveling agents, or combinations thereof.<br>
Examples of possible components are those described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 429-471, VCH, Weinheim 1991, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
 Exemplary drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example,<br>
organometallic compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples<br>
of organometallic compounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb,<br>
Mn, Co, Zn, Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of the metal Al, Ti or Zr, or<br>
organometallic compounds such as organotin compounds, for example, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
 Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the<br>
octoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoleates,<br>
resinates or tallates, and mixtures thereof.<br>
 Examples of metal chelates are the aluminum, titanium, or zirconium<br>
chelates of acetylacetone, ethyl acetylacetate, salicylaldehyde, salicylaldoxime, o-<br>
hydroxyacetophenone, or ethyl trifluoroacetylacetate, and the alkoxides of these metals,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
 Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate<br>
or dibutyltin dioctoate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
 Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example<br>
tributylamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-<br>
ethylmorpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and salts<br>
thereof, and mixtures thereof. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for<br>
example trimethylbenzylammonium chloride. Amino-containing resins are simultaneously<br>
a binder and a curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrylate<br>
copolymers.<br><br>
 The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine, for example<br>
triphenylphosphine.<br>
 The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating<br>
compositions. In this case, the binder includes monomeric or oligomeric compounds<br>
containing ethylenically unsaturated bonds, which after application are cured by actinic<br>
radiation, i.e., converted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form. Where the system<br>
is UV-curable, it generally contains a photoinitiator as well. Corresponding systems are<br>
described in the above-mentioned publication Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial<br>
Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pages 451-453, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In radiation-curable coating compositions, the novel stabilizers can also be<br>
employed with or without additional UV light stabilizers, including sterically hindered<br>
amines.<br>
 The coating compositions according to the invention can be applied to any<br>
desired substrates, for example to metal, wood, plastic, or ceramic materials. They are<br>
preferably used as topcoats in the finishing of automobiles. If the topcoat comprises two<br>
layers, of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the<br>
novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or the lower layer or for both<br>
layers, but preferably for the upper layer.<br>
 The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by any<br>
conventional methods available to those or ordinary skill in the art, for example by<br>
brushing, spr?YIng, pouring, dipping, or electrophoresis; see also Ullmann's Encyclopedia<br>
of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 491-500, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
 Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be cured at room<br>
temperature, or may require heating. The coatings are preferably cured at a temperature of<br>
from about 50°C to 150°C, and in the case of powder coatings, even at higher<br>
temperatures.<br>
 The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention generally have<br>
excellent resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen, and heat. In particular, the<br>
presently claimed coatings provide good light stability and weathering resistance.<br>
 In particular, the coating can be part of a paint, which has been stabilized<br>
against the damaging effects of light, oxygen, and heat by adding a content of the<br><br>
compound of the formulas (II) - (V). according to the invention. The paint can be a<br>
pigmented mono-coat which comprises a film-forming binder and an organic pigment or<br>
dye, an inorganic pigment, a metallic pigment, or a mixture thereof. The paint may also be<br>
a composition which comprises a primer in adhesion to a metal or plastic substrate: a<br>
pigmented basecoat that is in adhesion to the primer and which comprises a film-forming<br>
binder and an organic pigment or dye, an inorganic pigment, a metallic pigment, or a<br>
mixture thereof; and a clear coat that is in adhesion to the base coat and which comprises a<br>
film-forming binder and optionally a transparent pigment. One especially preferred use is a<br>
paint which is a clear topcoat for automobile original equipment manufacture (OEM)<br>
and/or refinish applications.<br>
 The invention furthermore relates to a process for stabilizing a coating based<br>
on polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the<br>
coating composition one or more rriazines or pyrimidines of the invention and to the use of<br>
mixtures comprising the one or more triazines or pyrimidines of the invention in coating<br>
compositions as stabilizers against damage by light, oxygen, and/or heat.<br>
 The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent<br>
mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can otherwise be an<br>
aqueous solution or dispersion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic solvent and<br>
water. The coating composition maybe a high-solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a<br>
powder coating material).<br>
 The pigments can be inorganic, organic or metallic pigments. The novel<br>
coating compositions preferably contain no pigments and are used as a clearcoat.<br>
 Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for<br>
applications in the automobile industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat<br>
of the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible.<br>
 The triazines and pyrimidines of the invention may be applied topically by<br>
polishing a surface with a composition comprising the triazines or pyrimidines and an inert<br>
carrier such as solvent, petroleum jelly, silicone oil in water emulsions, or automotive paint<br>
wax, e.g. Carnauba wax. These topical treatment compositions may be used to stabilize<br>
coating films, fabrics, leather, vinyl and other plastics and wood.<br>
 Preference is also given to the use of the novel triazines and pyrimidines<br>
compounds in photographic materials as stabilizer against damage by light, especially by<br><br>
UV light. The invention therefore also relates to a photographic material comprising one<br>
or more triazines or pyrimidines of the invention.<br>
 The compounds according to the invention can be used for photosensitive<br>
materials of all kinds. For example, they can be employed for color paper, color reversal<br>
paper, direct-positive color material, color negative film, color positive film, color reversal<br>
film, and other materials. They are preferably used, inter alia, for photosensitive color<br>
material which comprises a reversal substrate or which forms positives.<br>
 Furthermore, the novel compounds can be combined with other UV<br>
absorbers, especially those which are dispersible in aqueous gelatin, for example with<br>
hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles (See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,853,471, 4,973,702, 4,921,966<br>
and 4,973,701), benzophenones, oxanilides, cyanoacrylates, salicylates, or acrylonitriles, or<br>
thiazolines. In this context it is advantageous to employ these further, oil-dissolved UV<br>
absorbers in the photographic material in layers other than those comprising the novel UV<br>
absorbers.<br>
 In particular, it is possible successfully to stabilize photographic materials<br>
similar to those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,518,686.<br>
 The invention therefore additionally relates to a photographic material<br>
comprising, on support, a blue-sensitive, a green-sensitive, and/or a red-sensitive silver-<br>
halide emulsion layer and, if desired, a protective layer, with a layer comprising a UV<br>
absorber being arranged above the uppermost silver-halide emulsion layer, wherein the UV<br>
absorber is one or more triazines or pyrimidines of the invention.<br>
 Preference is additionally given tophotographic materials which have a<br>
layer comprising a compound of the formula (II) - (V) above the uppermost silver-halide<br>
emulsion layer and/or between the green- and red-sensitive silver-halide emulsion layers.<br>
 Furthermore, it may be advantageous for all or some of the layers which can<br>
comprise a UV absorber to have a UV absorber mixture and/or a further UV absorber<br>
which is dispersible in aqueous gelatin, but a compound of the formula (II) - (V) must be<br>
present at least in one layer.<br>
 The novel material preferably has gelatin interlayers between the silver-<br>
halide emulsion layers.<br><br>
 Preference is given to photographic materials in which the silver halide in<br>
the blue-sensitive, green-sensitive, and/or red-sensitive layer is silver chloride bromide<br>
comprising at least 90 mol % of silver chloride.<br>
 The compounds of the formula (II) - (V). which are used in accordance with<br>
the invention, can be incorporated, alone or together with the color coupler and, if used,<br>
further additives, into the color photographic materials by dissolving the compounds<br>
beforehand in high-boiling organic solvents. It is preferred to use solvents which boil at<br>
higher than 160 °C. Typical examples of such solvents are the esters of phthalic acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid or of fatty acids; alkylamides; or phenols.<br>
 Preferred color couplers for use in the compositions of the invention;<br>
examples of such compounds; further additives such as color cast inhibitors, DIR couplers<br>
and further light stabilizers, such as UV absorbers, phenols, phosphorus (III) compounds,<br>
organometallic complexes, hydroquinones and hydroquinone ethers; and more precise<br>
details on the structure of various photographic materials, can be found, for example, in the<br>
publications EP-A-0531258 and EP-A-0520938 and in the literature cited therein.<br>
 The invention also relates to a process for the stabilization of polyolefin or<br>
polyolefin copolymer films for agricultural applications, especially greenhouse<br>
applications, this polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer film having improved light stability<br>
and pesticide resistance, comprises one or more triazines or pyrimidines of the invention<br>
and a metal oxide or hydroxide selected from oxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium and<br>
magnesium, and hydroxides of zinc, aluminum and calcium, into the polyolefin or<br>
polyolefin copolymer. A further subject of the invention is a greenhouse, characterized in<br>
that it is covered by a polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer film having improved light<br>
stability and pesticide resistance and stabilized with one or more triazines or pyrimidines<br>
of the invention and a metal oxide or hydroxide selected from oxides of zinc, aluminum,<br>
calcium and magnesium, and hydroxides of zinc, aluminum and calcium; and a process for<br>
stabilizing a polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer greenhouse film against detrimental effects<br>
of pesticides and light, oxygen and/or heat, which process comprises incorporating one or<br>
more triazines or pyrimidines of the invention and a metal oxide or hydroxide selected<br>
from oxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium and magnesium, and hydroxides of zinc,<br>
aluminum and calcium, into said greenhouse film.<br><br>
 To form a film, a quantity of the said melted composition is forced through<br>
a film die, such as a flat film die or a circular blown film die, and forming a film therefrom.<br>
In the case where the composition is used to form a film therefrom, it is contemplated that<br>
the films may be unoriented, or may be subjected to a conventional operation to impart a<br>
degree of orientation on the film. Such a film may be oriented in one direction, such as in<br>
the "machine direction" and/or the "transverse direction," or may be oriented in both<br>
directions, or "biaxially" oriented<br>
The present invention is also suitable for sheet applications.<br>
The triazines and pyrimidines of the formula (II) - (V) are suitable for the<br>
photochemical stabilization of undyed, dyed, or printed fiber materials comprising for<br>
example, silk, leather, wool, polyamide, or polyurethanes and especially cellulose-<br>
containing fiber materials of all kinds. Examples of such fiber materials are the natural<br>
cellulose fibers, such as cotton, linen, jute, and hemp and also viscose staple fiber and<br>
regenerated cellulose. Preferred textile fiber materials are those of cotton. The triazine and<br>
pyrimidine compounds of the present invention are also suitable for the photochemical<br>
stabilization of hydroxyl-containing fibers in blend fabrics, for example blends of cotton<br>
with polyester fibers or polyamide fibers. A further preferred area of application relates to<br>
the blocking or reduction of the UV radiation which passes through the above-mentioned<br>
textile materials (UV cutting) and the heightened sun protection that textile materials<br>
finished with the novel compounds of the invention offer to the human skin.<br>
 To this end, one or a number of different compounds of the formula (II) -<br>
(V) are applied to the textile fiber materialby one of the customary dyeing methods,<br>
advantageously in a quantity of 0.01 to 5% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 3% by weight and,<br>
in particular, from 0.25 to 2% by weight, based on the weight of the fiber material.<br>
 The triazine and pyrimidine compounds can be applied to the fiber material<br>
in various ways and fixed on the fiber, especially in the form of aqueous dispersions or<br>
printing pastes.<br>
 The textile fiber materials finished with the novel compounds of the formula<br>
(II) - (V) possess improved protection against photochemical breakdown of the fiber and<br>
yellowing phenomena and, in the case of dyed fibre material, are of enhanced (hot) light<br>
fastness. Particular emphasis should be drawn to the greatly improved photoprotective<br>
effect of the treated textile fiber material and, in particular, the good protective effect with<br><br>
respect to short-wave UV-B rays. This is manifested by the fact that the textile fiber<br>
material finished with the novel triazine or pyrimidine compounds of the invention have,<br>
relative to untreated fabric, a greatly increased sun protection factor (SPF).<br>
 The sun protection factor is defined as the quotient of the dose of UV<br>
radiation which damages protected skin to that which damages unprotected skin.<br>
Accordingly, a sun protection factor is also a measure of the extent to which untreated fiber<br>
materials and fiber materials treated with novel compounds of the formulas (II) - (V) are<br>
permeable to UV radiation. The determination of the sun protection factor of textile fiber<br>
materials is explained, for example, in WO94/04515 or in J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 40, 127-<br>
133 (1989) and can be carried out analogously thereto.<br>
 Yet another use of the UV absorbers according to the invention is in the<br>
stabilization of intra-ocular and contact lenses.<br>
 The inventive UV absorbers are also suitable as photoprotective agents in<br>
cosmetic preparations. The invention additionally relates, therefore, to a cosmetic<br>
preparation comprising at least one triazine or pyrimidine compound of the invention and<br>
cosmetically acceptable carriers or auxiliaries.<br>
 The novel cosmetic composition contains from 0.1 to 15% by weight,<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight, based on the overall weight of the composition, of at<br>
least one triazine or pyrimidine UV absorber of the invention and a cosmetically acceptable<br>
auxiliary.<br>
 The cosmetic composition can be prepared by physically mixing the novel<br>
UV absorber with the auxiliary by means of customary methods, for example by simply<br>
stirring together the two materials.<br>
 The cosmetic preparation according to the invention can be formulated as a<br>
water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, as an oil-in-oil alcohol lotion, as a vesicular<br>
dispersion of an ionic or nonionic amphophilic lipid, as a gel, solid stick, or as an aerosol<br>
formulation.<br>
 As a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, the cosmetically acceptable<br>
auxiliary preferably contains from 5 to 50% of an oily phase, from 5 to 20° o of an<br>
emulsifier, and from 30 to 90% water. The oil phase can comprise any oil which is suitable<br>
for cosmetic formulations, e.g., one or more hydrocarbon oils, a wax, a natural oil, a<br><br>
silicone oil, a fatty acid ester, or a fatty alcohol. Preferred mono- or polyols are ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycerol, and sorbitol.<br>
 For these cosmetic formulations, it is possible to use any conventionally<br>
employed emulsifier, e.g., one or more ethoxylated esters of naturally occurring<br>
derivatives, i.e., polyethoxylated esters of hydrogenated castor oil; or a silicone oil<br>
emulsifier such as silicone polyol; an unmodified or ethoxylated fatty acid soap; an<br>
ethoxylated fatty alcohol; an unmodified or ethoxylated sorbitan ester; an ethoxylated fatty<br>
acid; or an ethoxylated glyceride.<br>
 The cosmetic formulation can also comprise further components, for<br>
example emollients, emulsion stabilizers, skin moisteners, tanning accelerators, thickeners<br>
such as xanthan, moisture retention agents such as glycerol, preservatives, fragrances, and<br>
colorants.<br>
 The novel cosmetic formulations are notable for good protection of human<br>
skin against the damaging effect of sunlight while at the same time providing for reliable<br>
tanning of the skin.<br>
 The invention will now be illustrated by the following examples. The<br>
examples are not intended to be limiting of the scope of the present invention. In<br>
conjunction with the general and detailed descriptions above, the examples provide further<br>
understanding of the present invention.<br>
 EXAMPLES<br>
Examples and reaction schemes for producing specific examples of novel<br>
triazines of the invention in accordance with the invention are provided below. While the<br>
following examples illustrate preparations with one or more triazines of the invention<br>
compounds, one of ordinary skill will understand that these reactions may also be carried<br>
out with any of a variety of other phenyl compounds having hydrocarbyl group^ ortho to<br>
each other where, when necessary, reactive substituents on such other phenyl compounds<br>
having hydrocarbyl groups ortho to each other are protected in accordance with procedures<br>
and reagents well known and understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>

from cyanuric chloride in chlorobenzene solvent.<br><br>
 In a 3 neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a<br>
refluxing condenser, a nitrogen inlet, and a thermocouple, was added 55.3g cyanuric<br>
chloride and 750 ml chlorobenzene. The reaction flask was then cooled in an ice-bath to<br>
about 0°C and then 120.0 g of AlCl3 was slowly added with stirring. After about 5<br>
minutes, 6.0 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred for about 30 minutes at 0 °C, further cooled to about -5°C and 60.5 g of o-xylene<br>
was then added over a period of about 35-40 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
0°C for about 1 hour and then stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. Resorcinol (36.3g)<br>
was then added to the reaction mixture and the resulting mixture allowed to stir for about<br>
12 hours. The reaction mixture was then heated to about 85-90°C for 3 hours. HPLC<br>
analysis at this stage indicated completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was then<br>
cooled to about 50°C, and quenched with dilute HC1 solution. The chlorobenze solvent<br>
was removed by azeotropic distillation. The precipitated material was separated by<br><br>
filtration, washed with water, and dried to give 96 g of the product analyzed to consist<br>
mainly of the 2-(2,4-dihydroxphenyl)-4,6-(3,4- dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine along with a<br>
small amount of its isomer.<br>

formation of a new product and disappearance of the 2-(2,4-dihydroxphenyl)-4,6-(3,4-<br>
dimethylphenyl)-l,3,5-triazine. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature,<br>
diluted with methylene chloride, filtered, and the filtrate concentrated under reduced<br><br>
pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in methylene chloride, washed with water,<br>
dried, and concentrated to give 111 gm of crude product.<br>
The crude product was refluxed with acetone, and the solid filtered after cooling to room<br>
temperature, washed with acetone, and dried to give 75 gm of pure 2-(2-hydroxy-4-<br>
octyloxyphenyl-4,6-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-l,3,5-triazine, melting point 140 °C.<br>

 In a 3 neck, glass round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a<br>
refluxing condenser with nitrogen inlet and a thermocouple was added 50g cyanuric<br>
chloride and 191 ml o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). AlCl3 (108.4g) was then slowly added to<br>
the flask at room temperature. After few minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled in an<br>
ice-bath, and 6.5g of HC1 was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was<br>
allowed to warm to room temperature, stirred for 2 hours, 54.7g of o-xylene added over a 3<br>
hour period, and the reaction mixture stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction<br>
mixture was heated to about 63 °C, and 34g of resorcinol was added in four equal parts in<br>
10 minute intervals. The mixture was heated at 75-80oX for 3 hours. The reaction mixture<br>
was then cooled to room temperature and quenched with water. The o-dichlorobenzene<br>
was distilled off as an azeotrope. The precipitated solid was filtered off, washed with<br>
water, and dried to give 96 gm of crude -(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-<br>
1,3,5-triazine.<br><br>
Example 4: Preparation of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(3.4-dimethylphenynl)-1.3.5-triazine.<br><br>
 To a 3-neck round bottom glass reaction flask equipped with reflux<br>
condenser, a stirrer, and a nitrogen inlet was added 3.69g of cyanuric chloride and 50 ml o-<br>
dichlorobenzene (ODCB). AlCl3 (8.0 g) was then added to the reaction mixture at room<br>
temperature. The mixture was cooled to about 5°C using an ice bath and 0.5g of<br>

removed by azeotropic distillation. The resulting solid material was filtered and was dried<br>
overnight to give about 5.5g of a crude product. The major product was confirmed by<br>
HPLC analysis to be 2-chloro-4,6-bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-l,3,5-triazine.<br><br>
Example 5: Reaction of 2-(2,4-dihydroxphenyn-4.6-bis(3.4-dimethylphenyl)-1.3,5-<br>
triazine with ethyl chloroacetate in the presence of a base.<br>
 To a reaction flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a stirrer, and a<br>

triazine, 3.5 g potassium carbonate, 0.1 g potassium iodide, and 20 ml acetone followed by<br>
1.1 mole eq. of ethyl chloroacetate. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux, and<br>
held at reflux for 6 hours. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed the formation of<br>
a new product with almost complete conversion of the starting material. The heating was<br>
discontinued, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and filtered to provide<br>
a residue. The residue was treated with water and then extracted with methylene chloride.<br>

triazine, 3.5 g potassium carbonate, 0. 1g of Aliquat 336, and 20 ml acetone followed by 1.1<br>
mole eq. of iodobutane. The reaction mixture was then heated to reflux, and held at relfux<br>
for 6 hours. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed the formation of a new product<br>
with almost complete conversion of the starting material. The heating was discontinued,<br>
and the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was<br>
diluted with water and extracted with methylene chloride. The methylene chloride extract<br>
was washed with water, dried, and concentrated to give 2.0 g of a product identified to be<br>
4-butyl ether derivative of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-<br>
triazine.<br>

1,3,5-triazine, 4.14 g potassium carbonate, and 30 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK)<br>
followed by 1.8 g of benzenesulfonyl chloride. The reaction mixture was then heated to<br>
reflux, and held at reflux for 10 hours. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed the<br>
formation of a new product with almost complete conversion of the starting material. The<br>
heating was discontinued, and the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The<br>
reaction mixture was then diluted with methylene chloride, filtered, and the filtrate<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was treated with a mixture of<br>
1:1 methylene chloride:hexane and the resulting precipitated material collected by filtration<br><br>
and dried to give the 4-benzenesulfonate derivative that was characterized by NMR and<br>
mass spectral analysis.<br>

nitrogen inlet wad edded 3.7 g of cyanuric chloride, 50 rnL of o-dichlorobenzene, and 8.0 g<br>
of aluminum chloride. The reaction mixture was cooled to 5°C in an ice-bath, and 0.5 g of<br>
concentrated HC1 was slowly added. The ice-bath was then removed, the mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, 4 g of o-xylene was added to the reaction mixture<br>
over a period of 10 min. at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for about 16 hours. Resorcinol (2.4 g) was then added to the reaction mixture<br>
and the reaction mixture was heated to 85-90°C and held at this temperature for 2 hours.<br>
The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and 3.9 g of benzene sulfonyl<br>
chloride slowly added. The reaction mixture was heated again to 85-90°C for 5 hours, and<br>
then allowed to sit at room temperature for about 12 hours. The reaction mixture was then<br><br>
quenched with water, extracted with methylene chloride, and the organic extract<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. HPLC analysis of the residue showed that the major<br>
product was identical to the 4-benzene sulfonate derivative prepared above in Example 7.<br>
This one pot process, wherein intermediates are not isolated is a novel method to make this<br>
class of compounds.<br>
Example 9; Reaction of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4.6-bis(3.4-dimethylphenyn-1,3,5.<br>
triazine with benzoyl chloride in the presence of a base<br><br>

a new product and unreacted starting material. An additional 0.5 g of benzoyl chloride was <br>
added to the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture refluxed for an additional 10 hours.<br>
The heating was discontinued, and the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature.<br>
The reaction mixture was then diluted with methylene chloride, filtered, and the filtrate<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was further purified by column<br>
chromatography over silicia gel using a 75:25 methylene chloride.hexane mixture as the<br>
eluant. About 2.0 g of a product characterized to be the 4-benzoate derivative was<br>
recovered.<br><br>

reaction mixture was heated again to 85-90°C for 5 hours, and allowed to sit at room<br>
temperature for about 12 hours. The reaction mixture was then quenched with water,<br>
extracted with methylene chloride, and the organic extract concentrated under reduced<br><br>
pressure. HPLC analysis of the residue showed a mixture of products including the 4-<br>
benzoate ester of 2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-l,3,5-triazine. This<br>
one pot process, wherein intermediates are not isolated is a novel method to make this class<br>
of compounds.<br>

PERFORMANCE OF THE TRIAZINE LIGHT<br>
STABILIZERS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Example 12. Performance of 2-(2-hydroxy-4-octyoxylphenyl)4.6-bis(3,4-dimethylphenyl-<br>
1,3,5-triazine (Compound A) in Polycarbonate Plaques.<br>
 Compound A at a loading level of 0.35%, 0.2%, or 0.1% by weight and<br>
0.05% phosphite (Ultranox 641, commercially available from General Electric Specialty<br>
Chemicals of) Morgantown, WV was dry blended into a Lexanl01-1111 polycarbonate<br>
pellets (containing 0.5% phosphite) or Lexan 100 virgin polycarbonate flakes (both<br>
commercially available from General Electric Specialty Chemicals of Morgantown, WV).<br>
The blended material was melt mixed in a Brabender PL-2000 torque rheometer<br>
(commercially available from Pasedena Hydraulics of The City of Industry, CA) equipped<br>
with a single mixing screw extruder, 5-zone, single pass at 50-60 rpm with the temperature<br>
of zones 1-5 at 246°C, 260°C, 265°C, 295°C, and 300°C, respectively. The extrudate was<br>
cooled dried and pellitized. The pellets were injection molded into sample plaques (2<br>
inches x 2.5 inches x 125 mils) using an Arburg Allrounder 320-210-750 injection molding<br>
machine (commercially available from Arbury GmbH &amp; Co. of Lossburg, Germany) with<br>
the nozzle at 295 °C, nozzle side at 300°C, middle at 285°C, feed at 275 °C, and mold at<br>
105°C. Control plaques, without Compound A, were prepared in an identical manner.<br>
 Plaques were tested for hydrolytic stability by measuring the melt flow<br>
index of the polycarbobate plaques as g per 10 minutes, using a CSI Melt Flow Indexer 2<br>
(commercially available from Custom Scientific Instruments, a Division of Atlas Electric<br>
Devices Co. of Cedar Knolls, NJ) following ASTM D1238 method B, before and after<br><br>
being exposed to high temperature and pressure. Samples were exposed to high<br>
temperature and pressure in an AH-American Electric Pressure Sterilizer Model No. 25X<br>
(commercially available from PCI Scientific Supply Inc., of Faitfield, NJ). The autoclave<br>
was pressurized with water at 120°C for 6 hours. Sample plaques exposed to high<br>
temperature and pressure were dried over a desiccant in an oven for between 4 and 8 hours<br>
before measuring the flow index. The results of hydrolytic testing are provided in Table 1.<br><br>
 The results in Table 1 show that the Compound A had no significant effect<br>
on the stability of the polycarbonate plaques, as measured by the melt flow index. Control<br>
plaques without compound A appeared to show a distinct increase in the melt flow index<br>
after being subjected to high temperature and pressure.<br>
 Sample plaques were also subjected to xenon-arc accelerated weathering,<br>
QUV accelerated weathering, and oven aging at 130 °C. Xenon-arc accelerated weathering<br>
was carried out by exposing the sample plaques in a xenon-arc weatherometer as<br>
determined by the ASTM G-26 Standard using Test Method B. QUV (UVB-313)<br>
accelerated weathering was carried out on plaques according to the ASTM G-53 test<br>
method with a QUV Accelerated Weather Tester device (commercially available from Q<br>
Panel Laboratory Products of Cleveland, OH). Oven aging was carried out according to the<br>
ASTM 794 test method. Color as measured by yellowing index (YI) and AE was measured<br>
as a function of weathering time. Color was determined with a Macbeth Color Eye<br>
Colorimeter under laboratory conditions with illuminate C, 2° observer, specular<br>
component excluded, and UV component included.<br>
 Tables 2 to 4 show the effect of xenon-arc accelerated weathering, oven<br>
aging, and QUV (UVB-313) accelerated weathering, respectively, as measured by YI<br><br>
values, for polycarbonate plaques containing 0.35% by weight of Compound A and for<br>
control polycarbonate plaques. Table 5 show the effect on YI, AE, and ?YI (YI at time t<br>
less YI at time 0) on polycarbonate plaques including 0.35% by weight of Compound A<br>
compared to a control polycarbonate plaques that were subjected to oven aging.<br><br><br><br>
 The results in Tables 2-5 clearly shows that the polycarbonate plaques<br>
stabilized with Compound A showed superior performance compared to the polycarbonate<br>
plaque containing no stabilizer, as measured by YI, ?YI, and AE, when subjected to xenon-<br>
arc accelerated weathering, QUV (UVB-313) accelerated weathering, or oven aging. An<br>
increase in YI, ?YI or AE indicates an unfavorable discoloration of the polycarbonate.<br><br>

Plaques.<br>
 Polycarbonate sample plaques were prepared as described in Example 12<br>
containing 0.35%, 0.2%, or 0.1% by weight of Compound A or UV-1164 (commercially<br>
available from Cytec Industries of West Paterson, NJ). The sample plaques were tested for<br>
hydrolytic stability and subjected to xenon-arc accelerated weathering, QUV accelerated<br>
weathering, and oven aging at 130°C according to the procedures described in Example 12.<br>
The results of hydrolytic testing are provided in Table 6.<br><br>

xenon-arc accelerated weathering.<br>
 Table 12 shows the effect on YI values of exposing the polycarbonate<br>
pellets to severe conditions during the injection molding process used to manufacture the<br>
plaques. As noted above, plaques are typically processed with the nozzle side at 300 °C.<br>
Under the severe conditions the plaques are processed at a temperature of 340 °C with the<br>
compound filling the length of the injection molder barrel for either 40 seconds (severe 40<br>
seconds) or for 5 minutes (severe 5 minutes).<br><br>
 The results in Table 12 demonstrates that the stability of polycarbonate<br>
plaques containing 0.35% of Compound A was distinctly superior to the stability of<br>

 The results in Table 13 show that Compound A had no significant effect on<br>
the hydrolytic stability of the polycarbonate plaques. Plaques containing Tinuvin-15 77,<br>
however, appeared to show a definite increase in the melt flow index after being subjected<br>
to high temperature and pressure.<br>
 Table 14 shows a comparison of the effect of oven aging on YI values in<br>
polycarbonate plaques including 0.1% by weight of Compound A or 0.35% by weight of<br>

polycarbonate plaques containing 0.35% of Tinuvin-1577, as measured by YI values, when<br>
the plaques are subjected to oven aging at 130°C. The results demonstrate that Compound<br>
A is equally effective at stabilizing the polycarbonate plaque when Compound A is present<br>
in a much lower loading than Tinuvin-1577.<br>

are subjected to QUV accelerated weathering.<br>
 Table 16 shows the effect of severe conditions during the injection molding<br>
process used to manufacture the plaques on YI values. Severe conditions are defined as in<br>
Example 12.<br><br><br><br>
 The results in Table 16 demonstrates that the stability of polycarbonate<br>
5 plaques containing 0.35% of Compound A was significantly better than the stability of<br>

Tinuvin-1577.<br><br><br><br>
 The results in Tables 17 demonstrates that the stability of polycarbonate<br>
plaques containing 0.35%, 0.2%, or 0.1% of Compound A was significantly better than the<br><br>

plaques containing 0.35% of Tinuvin-1577, as measured by YI values, when the plaques<br>
are subjected to xenon-arc accelerated weathering.<br>
 Overall the results show that Compound A is effective at stabilizing<br>
