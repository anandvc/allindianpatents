				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a fixed-dose association of an angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), enalapril, and of a calcium channel inhibitor (CCI), nitrendipine, to a method for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition which includes said fixed-dose association and to the use thereof in the treatment of illnesses of the cardiovascular system, in particular arterial hypertension.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are presented in the form of solid single doses with fixed quantities of enalapril and nitrendipine, so that a single administration, once a day, achieves the effect for 24 hours following said dose. The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention have a therapeutic effect in the treatment of hypertension and other illnesses of the cardiovascular system when the quantities of the active ingredients, enalapril and nitrendipine, are smaller than the usual therapeutic doses of each medicament administered alone. The preparations of the invention have lower dose-related adverse effects than those which arise in the administration of larger doses of each of the active ingredients separately in order to achieve the same therapeutic effect. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention simplify the administration regime and are more acceptable to the patient.<br>
Background of the invention.<br>
International consensus exists regarding the initial treatment of slight-moderate hypertension (AHT) . Health-dietary measures are an inescapable first step in tackling the hypertense patient. If suitable control of blood-pressure figures are not achieved with these measures, a pharmacological treatment must be started.<br>
The pharmacological treatments recommended as first choice have varied over the course of recent years. Initially, these were the thiadizic diuretiess, to which 0-blockers were subsequently added, and this situation has now been extended to other pharmacological groups such as the ACE inhibitors, the CCAs and the a, -blockers. All the aforesaid pharmacological groups are of similar- efficacy in respect of control of blood-pressure fig-xres and are recognized as first-choice alternatives.<br>
Single-drug therapy remains at present compulsory practice as first step in the pharmacological, treatment of AHT. Where an initial therapy fails, the various committees of experts consider several possibilities. A satisfactory response is generally held to be that which keeps arterial tension figures below 140/90 mmHg. If this objective has not been achieved after a period of time ranging between 1 to 3 months, various possibilities are considered which, although basically similar, present some differences according to the body which proposes them.<br>
Where the initial therapy fails, the WHO recommends that the initial drug be replaced by another belonging to a different group. Where there had been a partial response, it is felt preferable to add a second drug from another group at low dosages, instead of increasing the dose of the first.<br>
Despite the undoubted benefits In terms of morbi-mortality to which the treatment of AHT gives rise, the results are not always as encouraging as might have been expected and the patient remains exposed to a greater risk<br>
of suffering cardiovascular complications tium do patients of normal arterial tension. One of the factors which contributes to this relative failure of antihypertension therapy is deficient or less than optimum control in many cases of the hypertense patient as a result of the adverse reactions associated with high doses of antihypertension medicaments and failures of compliance arising out of multiple therapy.<br>
Furthermore, 35-50% of patients suffering from hypertension do not present a satisfactory response to the initial single-medicament treatment (Medical Research Council Working Party. Trial of treatment of mild hypertension: principal results. Br. Med. J., 1985; 291: 97-104 and Moser M. The fifth report on the "oint National Committee on detection, evaluation, and trea.tment of high blood pressure: a critique. Primary Cardiol. 1993; 16: 66-73). One of the causes of this high lack of response in the treatment of AHT is the coming into actio:i of counter-regulatory mechanisms which partially limit the antihypertensive effect- When any of the arterial tension regulating systems is modified a compensatory response arises from the other factors intervening in said control. Each pharmacological group acts more specifically on one of these mechanisms, so that one of the primordial justifications for combined treatment is that of having simultaneo\is effect on more than one of the factors which give rise to arterial hypertension.<br>
Fixed-dose combinations of antihypertension medicaments should thus fulfil a triple objective: an increase of efficacy due to simultaneous action on more than one of the mechanisms regulating blood pressure; improvement in tolerance, due to their being administered in doses lower than those for each of their components separately; and improved therapeutic compliance due to a lower number of ingestions being necessary.<br>
Hence the interest in developing the association of an ACE inhibitor and a CCA by seeking a synergic action in the reduction of blood pressure, a reduction of the adverse effects inherent to the CCAs, and improved therapeutic compliance due to administration being in a single dose.<br>
The mechanism by which both active ingredients could be potentiated is complex. The CCAs give rise to a balance of negative sodium which stimulates the renin-angiotensin system, which effect is held up by the ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the administration of ACE inhibitors produces an increase of vagal tone which would offset the sympathetic activation and tachycardia induced by the CCAs of the dihydropyridine group.<br>
The choice of enalapril as ACE inhibitor in the association of the invention is due to the fact that it reduces blood pressure in all degrees of sssential and renovascular hypertension. It is at least as effective as other ACE inhibitors and other antihypertension drugs from other pharmacological groups such as diuretics, ß-blockers, CCAs and α1-blockers. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in numerous comparative clinical trials, and it has been available in many countries for several years. The dose range normally used is from 5 to 40 mg, o:2ce a day. The usual initial dose is 10 mg once a day for slight arterial hypertension and 20 mg once a day for other degrees of arterial hypertension. The usual maintenance dose is 20 mg once a day, which can be increased up to a masrimum of 40 mg once a day, depending on the individual needs of each patient. In patients who do not usually respond to single-drug therapy, another drug from a different pharmacological group can be added in order to provide an additional response.<br>
The ACE inhibitors also improve the su:rvival rate of patients with congestive heart failure and can prevent or delay the development of left-ventricle dilation and heart<br>
failure in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic left-ventricle dysfunction. The haemodynamic changes associated with both acute and long-term treatment with enalapril in patients with congestive heart failure:include reduction of systemic vascular resistance (from 20% to 45%), reduction of mean arterial pressure (from 7% to 15%), reduction of pulmonary capillary pressure (from 25% to 50%) and increased heart rate (from 25% to 30%) . Mortality and morbidity rates following long-term treatment (over one year) improve by approximately 15% in patients with slight and moderate heart failure (study by SOLVD N. Engl. J. Med. 19S7; 316: 1429-1435) and by approximately 30% in patients with severe heart failure (CONSENSUS study, N. Engl. J. Med. 15591; 325: 293-302) . The enalapril doses recommended for this purpose are 2.5 mg/day initially, increasing up to 10 to 20 mg/day depending upon the clinical response.<br>
Diabetic nephropathy is a clinical syndrome characterised by persistent proteinuria, progressive reduction of the glomerular filtration rate and increased arterial pressure. Preceding these changes there is a silent period of variable duration during which the diabetic patient shows persistent microalbuminuria. The presence of microalbuminuria is important in that it has been shown to be a predictive factor for the clinical development of diabetic nephropathy. In patients of normal tension with non-insulin-dependent or hypertense diabe;tes mellitus controlled with nifedipine, the addition of 5 mg/day enalapril significantly reduces the microalbuminuria, by 40% to 50%, over a period of 48 months. In monitoring of up to 5 years, enalapril stabilizes the microalbuminuria in patients with normal blood pressure with non-insulin-dependent diabetes better than does the placebo.<br>
The* choice of nitrendipine as CCA in the association of the invention is due to its possessing predominantly peripheral vasodilator properties, which induces sustained<br>
reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It has been observed in various clinical trials that; nitrendipine reduces blood pressure in patients with slight-moderate hypertension, and that this effect is sustained following long-term administration. In comparative trials with diuretics, ^-blockers and other CCAs nitrendipine has been observed to have similar efficacy in the control of slight-moderate arterial hypertension. Nitrendipine has been commercially available in many countries for several years. The usual initial dose in patients with slight-moderate arterial hypertension is 5 to 20 mg once a day. In function of the response the dose can be adjusted between 5 and 20 mg once or twice a day, whether in single-drug therapy or combined with a diuretic or a ß-blocker.<br>
Several associations of ACE inhibitors; and CCAs have been studied: cilazapril and nitrendipine (Nakanishi and col., Curr. Ther. Res. 1992; 52: 514-523), captopril and nitrendipine (Gennari and col., Cardiovasc Drugs. Ther. 1989; 3: 319-325), enalapril and felodipine (Morgan and col.. Kidney International 1992; 41 (suppl. 36) : S78-S81) . On the basis of these and other studies carried out on associations between ACE inhibitors and CCAs it can be concluded that combined treatment is more effective and better tolerated than single-drug treatment with each of the drugs s eparately.<br>
Also described are different associations of ACE inhibitors and CCAs, of the dihydropyridine type, for the treatment of arterial hypertension, in several patients, for example EP 488059, EP 180785, EP 265685, WO 9607400, EP 272177.<br>
It must nevertheless be taken into account that the first requirements to be considered in the development of a fixed-dose association is that both components are compatible from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic points of view.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Taking account of the aforesaid background, in this invention   a   fixed-dose   association   of   an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), enalapril, and of a calcium, channel antagonist (CCA.) , nitrendipine, was developed,  these being drags which, administered alone, have extensively demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of arterial hypertension and other cardiovascular illnesses. Moreover,  snalapril and nitrendipine belong to different pharmacological groups with antihypertensive effect, so that combined administration thereof permits simultaneous action on; more tiian one of the blood pressure regulatory mechanisms, i<br>
The present invention also ; relates to a new pharmaceutical composition and the method for preparation o£ same for oral administration oral and for use in the treatment of arterial hypertension and other illnesses of the cardiovascular system. This pharmaceutical! composition consists in a single-dose form which contains fixed quantities of enalapril and nitrendipine.<br>
The molecule corresponding to the enalapril (Formula I) possesses three chira.1 centres and: there can therefore exist in eight different enantiomeric forms. The enantiomer known by the name of enalapril and used in thiis invention is 1-(N-((S)-1-ethoxycarbonyl-3-fenilpropyl) -L-alani1)-L-prolina. Enalapril salts can be used, such .as salts with organic and inorganic acids (maleate, hydroczlorate., etc.) and salts with bases (sodium, potassium, magnesium salts).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Nitrendipine (Formula II) has one chiral centre and, therefore, can be presented in two enantiometric forms. The commercial product is nevertheless the racemic mixture of the two isomers of ethyl and methyl ester of the acid 1,4-dihydro-2, S-dimethyl-4- (3-nitrophenyl) -3,5-pyridindicarbo-xylic. Nitrendipine salts can be used with organic and inorganic acids.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The instability of enalapril maleate and the considerable insolubility of nitrendipine are known. For this reason a method has been developed, and forms the object of this invention, for preparation of a gallenic formulation which achieves good stability of the enalapril, in the form of sodium salt, and good solubility of the nitrendipine,, thereby achieving rapid release of the enalapril-nitrendipine association.: The method for preparation of the formulation consists, on the one hand, in preparation of a granulating solution by dissolving the enalapril maleate and the sodium bicarbonate in a sufficient quantity of water. On the other hand, the remaining components are mixed with the exception of a fraction of the disintegrating excipients (starch, macrocrystalline cellulose) and the lubricant (magnesium stearate). Said mixture is granulated with the aforesaid granulating solution. Following drying of the granulate a mass with a highly hydrophilic environment is obtained, which, linked with the action of the humect ant (sodium lauryl- sulphate)<br>
favours dissolving of the nitrendipine. The agglutin and wetting agent (polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium lauryl-sulphate) can as an option be incorporated into the granulating solution. A granulate is thus obtained which, following drying to a residual humidity of le*ss than 1.5%, calibration and addition of the remaining excipients, can be compressed in a conventional press to provide stable tablets with rapid release of both active ingredients.<br>
The dosage range o£ enalapril in the single fixed-dose forms of the association is between 2.5-20 mg, preferably between 10 and 20 mg. The dosage range of nitrendipine in the single fixed-dose forms fixed in the association is between 5-20 mg, preferably between 5 and 10 mg.<br>
This form of single-dose administration facilitates the ingestion regime and improves acceptance by the patient.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 below describe two different pharmaceutic formulations of the association of enalapril and nitrendipine object of the invention, together with the method for obtaining them. Example 3 describes the results of the trials on dissolution of the enalapril and nitrendipine of the formulations obtained in examples 1 and 2.<br>
Example 4 describes the pharmacological effect of the association of enalapril and nitrendipine assessed in two experimental models: a) experimentally hypertense rat and b) beagle dog with normal blood pressure.<br>
Example 5 describes the pharmacokinetic compatibility and example 6 the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention in comparative clinical trials between enalapril, nitrendipine and a solid dosage form of the fixed-dose association of enalapril and nitrendipine.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
The pharmacological effect of; the association of enalapril and nitrendipine of the invention was evaluated in two experimental models:<br>
a) Anfcihyper tensive aetivifcy in the rat experimentally hypertense by aorfcie coarctation<br>
The antihypertensive activity of the association of enalapril and nitrendipine vras tested in comparison with each one of the isolated components in an experimental model of hypertension by arterial coarction in the rat.<br>
Measurement of the arterial pressure was carried out with the animal conscious. The doses tested were as follows:<br>
-	Enalapril maleate 1 mg/kg (p.o.)<br>
-	Nitrendipine 3 mg/kg (p.o.)<br>
-	Enalapril maleate and Nitrendipine (1 and 3) mg/kg (p.o.)<br>
-	Enalapril maleate and Nitrendipine (0.5 and 1.5) mg/kg (p.o.)<br>
The control group received the carrier (CMC 1% en distilled water) , the administration volume being 10 mg/kg (p.o.) .<br>
The data obtained are shown in table 7 and figure 3. Oral administration of enalapril maleate (1 mg/kg) revealed a moderate antihypertensive effect, but sustained for up to 6 hours following administration.<br>
Oral administration of nitrendipine (3 mg/kg) produced a very marked antihypertensive effect, though not a very sustained one, with a return to basal values 4 hours following administration.<br>
Combined administration of enalapril maleate (l mg/kg, p.o.) and nitrendipine (3 mg/kg, p.o.) produced an antihypertensive effect greater than that of enalapril administered alone (1 mg/kg, p.o.). Trial at dosages lower than those initially used in the association (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg, p.o.) of enalapril maleate and nitrendipine revealed<br>
an antihypertensive effect equivalent to the dissociation (1 and 3 mg/kg, p.o.) of enalapril maleate and nitrendipine, together with a prolongation of the duration of the antihypertensive effect obtained with the individual treatments, from which it can be concluded. that the association has a synergic effect.<br>

b) Hypotensive activity in beagle dog with normal arterial tension<br>
A study was made of the hypotensive effect of the association of enalapril and nitrendipine (1:1) in beagle dog, with physiological data obtained from a 26-week study of chronic toxicity; enalapril maleate and nitrendipine (1:1) were administered at doses of 1 and 1; 3 and 3; and 6 and 6 mg/kg/day administered orally for 26 weeks in the form of capsules.<br>
Birring the treatment period the systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were recorded and the mean pressure calculated in basal conditions following 1, 4, 13 and 26 weeks of treatment. At each of these periods the arterial pressure was recorded before administration and 4 and S hours after administration. The results obtained are shown in table 8 -<br>
Oral administration of enalapril maleate and nitrendipine (1:1) for 26 weeks at the doses of 1 and 1; 3 and 3; and 6 and 6 mg/kg/day revealed aa. appreciable hypotensive effect right from the 1st week of -reatment. The maximum effect appeared 4 hours after administration and was sustained for a further 8 hours following administration.<br>
This hypotensive effect intensified over the time of treatment/ with the lowest arterial pressure recorded at 13 weeks.<br>
This study thus shows a clear pharmacological effect of the association of enalapril maleate and nitrendipine (1:1) at the doses of 1 and 1; 3 and 3; and 6 and 6 mg/kg/day (p.o.)<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
A study was made of the pharmacokinetic interaction following a single dose of 20 mg of enalapril, 20 tag of nitrendipine and the fixed-dose association of 20 mg each of enalapril and nitrendipine as active ingredients, in 24 healthy volunteers (10 men. and 14 women) . For this purpose a randomized, open and crossed clinical trial was designed, using a Latin, square of 3x3, with an off-period of 15 days between each of the treatment periods. In each treatment period 16 samples of blood were taken from each volunteer, from the basal moment up to 4-96 hours following administration, and the plasmatic concentrations of enalaprilate and nitrendipine- These date were used as the basis for calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters which measure bioavailability in magnitude (AUCinfinite) and in speed (Cmax , Cmax/AUC0infinite and Tmax,) and a statistical analysis was made (AKTOVA) to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between the means of each of these parameters- This analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the isolated ingestion of nitrendipine or enalapril and the combined ingestion of the fixed-dose association. The relative bioavailability (AUC0. infinite) of enalaprilate following combined ingestion with respect to isolated ingestion was :1.12. The relative bioavailability (AUC0-infinite) of nitrendipine following combined ingestion with respect to isolated ingestion was 0.91. It can therefore be concluded that there exists" no clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction between nitrendipine and enalapril following administration of a single dose of 20 mg of each of the active ingredients separately and in their fixed-dose association in the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A placebo-control led, open clinical trial was carried out in male patients with slight-moderate AHT, defined as systolic blood pressure values (SAID between 165 and 144 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure values (DAT) between 95 and 105 mmHg, taken in decubitus position after 5 minutes' rest. Following a two~week placebo period, the patients complying with the slight-moderate AHT criteria received treatment with 5 mg nitrendipine once a day (9 patients) or 5 mg enalapril once a day (11 psitients) for 2 weeks, at the end of which the patients who did not respond to the treatment (DAT
