				<td>TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE FILM AND DISPLAY DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
The present invention relates to a transparent conductive film and a display device in<br>
which this transparent conductive film is formed on a display screen, and more particularly,<br>
to a transparent conductive film having superior anti-static effects and electromagnetic<br>
wave shielding effects using a display screen such as a cathode ray tube or plasma display,<br>
high contrast by demonstrating black color in which dark areas are tinted with a blue hue<br>
for which the human eye most strongly senses black coloring when viewing transmitted<br>
images, and superior chemical stability, as well as a display device in which this<br>
transparent conductive film is formed on a display screen.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Since cathode ray tubes, which are one kind of display device used for the displays<br>
of television picture tubes, computers and so forth, depict characters and images on a<br>
display screen by bombarding an electron beam onto a fluorescent screen that emits red,<br>
green and blue colors, in addition to dust becoming adhered due to static electricity<br>
generated on this display screen and lowering visibility, there is also the risk of radiation<br>
of electromagnetic waves that have a detrimental effect on the environment.<br>
In addition, plasma displays for which applications have progressed for use as<br>
wall-mounted televisions have also been pointed out as having the potential to generate<br>
static electricity and radiate electromagnetic waves.<br><br>
In order to solve these problems, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First<br>
Publication No. 8-77832, for example, proposes an invention comprising a transparent<br>
metal thin film made of fine metal particles at least containing silver and having a mean<br>
particle size of 2-200 ran, and a transparent thin film having a different refractive index<br>
than said transparent metal thin film, for use as a transparent conductive film having<br>
superior electromagnetic wave shielding effects and anti-reflection effects.<br>
However, in these methods of the prior art, although electromagnetic wave shielding<br>
effects can be anticipated, the problem of absorbance of transmitted light at 400-500 nm<br>
occurring dependent on the optical transmission spectrum of silver, yellowing of the<br>
conductive film, and the hue of transmitted images being tinted with a yellow color<br>
thereby preventing the display of deep black color and resulting in decreased image<br>
contrast, as well as the problem of the surface resistance value of the conductive film<br>
rising when immersed in a chemical solution due to its low chemical stability resulting in a<br>
decrease in electromagnetic wave shielding effects and requiring that caution be used<br>
during handling, were not solved.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, the object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a transparent conductive film having superior electromagnetic wave shielding effects and<br>
anti-reflection effects, black color tinted with blue color for which the hue of transmitted<br>
images is generally considered to have a deep black color, and high chemical stability, as<br>
well as a display device in which this transparent conductive film is formed on a display<br>
screen.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the above problems, the present invention provides a transparent<br><br>
conductive film having a conductive layer at least containing ruthenium fine particles and<br>
gold fine particles or ruthenium fine particles, gold fine particles and silver fine particles.<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that as a result of a conductive layer at<br>
least containing ruthenium fine particles, and gold fine particles or ruthenium fine particles,<br>
gold fine particles and silver fine particles, the transparent conductive film has sufficient<br>
electrical conductivity for demonstrating anti-static effects and electromagnetic wave<br>
shielding effects, has satisfactory weather resistance as exemplified by salt water<br>
resistance, and when this transparent conductive film is formed on the display screen of a<br>
display device, the color tone of transmitted images are black tinted with blue resulting in<br>
natural hue and high image contrast, thereby enabling the obtaining of a display device<br>
having satisfactory visibility.<br>
The weight ratio of the ruthenium fine particles to gold fine particles in the above<br>
conductive layer is preferably within the range of 40:60 to 99:1. In addition, silver fine<br>
particles are preferably contained at 1-70 wt% relative to the total amount of ruthenium<br>
fine particles and gold fine particles.<br>
If the ratio of gold fine particles exceeds the above ratio, the refractive index of the<br>
conductive layer changes resulting in poor reflection characteristics, while if the ratio is<br>
lower than the above ratio, the problem of decreased electrical conductivity occurs.<br>
In addition, the above conductive layer is preferably formed by applying a coating<br>
containing at least ruthenium fine particles and gold fine particles or a coating containing<br>
at least ruthenium fine particles, gold fine particles and silver fine particles.<br>
As a result of containing a conductive layer formed using the above coating (to be<br>
hereinafter referred to as the "conductive layer forming coating"), the transparent<br>
conductive film of the present invention has superior anti-static effects and<br><br>
electromagnetic wave shielding effects, satisfactory weather resistance as exemplified by<br>
salt water resistance, and a coated film is obtained having extremely few film defects<br>
caused by aggregates of coating components and so forth.<br>
The transparent conductive film of the present invention may also contain a colorant<br>
Although the transparent conductive film of the present invention improves contrast<br>
as a result of the conductive layer containing ruthenium fine particles and gold fine<br>
particles which cause the color tone of transmitted images to become black tinted with<br>
blue, by containing a colorant in the above conductive layer or at least any one of the other<br>
layers, the transparent conductive film can be imparted with the function of a selective<br>
absorption filter, thereby making transmitted images of the transparent conductive film<br>
extremely vivid.<br>
At least one transparent layer having a refractive index different from that of the<br>
above conductive layer is preferably laminated for the upper layer and/or lower layer of the<br>
above conductive layer.<br>
As a result of laminating the above transparent layer, the anti-reflection performance<br>
of the transparent conductive film is improved, and entrance of external light and haze<br>
become extremely low.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a display device in which any of the<br>
above-mentioned transparent conductive films is formed on a display screen.<br>
As a result of having the above transparent conductive film formed on a display<br>
screen, this display device has superior anti-static effects and electromagnetic wave<br>
shielding effects, satisfactory weather resistance as exemplified by salt water resistance,<br>
high contrast as a result of the color tone of transmitted images demonstrating black color<br>
tinted with blue, and in the case of the conductive layer being formed by applying the<br><br>
above conductive layer forming coating, the appearance of the coated film is smooth with<br>
extremely few film defects caused by aggregates of coating components and so forth. In<br>
addition, in the case of the transparent conductive film containing a colorant, transmitted<br>
images become extremely vivid. Moreover, if the transparent conductive film has the<br>
previously mentioned transparent layer, visibility can be further improved by improving<br>
anti-reflection effects.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following provides an explanation of modes for carrying out the invention using<br>
preferable specific examples.<br>
As a result of conducting earnest research on a transparent conductive film formed<br>
by applying a coating containing metal fine particles to as to impart superior visibility and<br>
electromagnetic wave shielding effects to the display screen of a display device, the<br>
inventors of the present invention found that a transparent conductive film, in which a thin<br>
film, formed particularly using a coating in which ruthenium fine particles and gold fine<br>
particles and preferably colorant are uniformly dispersed, is heat-treated, has superior color<br>
tone and chemical stability, as well as superior electrical conductivity performance and<br>
anti-reflection performance, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.<br>
The conductive layer in the transparent conductive film of the present invention is<br>
obtained by performing heat treatment on a thin film formed using a coating containing<br>
ruthenium fine particles and gold fine particles (conductive layer forming coating), and<br>
together with having high electrical conductivity and high chemical stability, images<br>
transmitted through this conductive layer retain color tone that is comparatively close to<br>
natural light. With respect to the color tone of transmitted images in particular, the<br><br>
content of metal fine particles is such that the weight ratio of ruthenium to gold is within<br>
the range of 40:60 to 99:1, preferably within the range of 50:50 to 99:1 and more<br>
preferably within the range of 50:50 to 75:25. The color tones of ruthenium and gold<br>
alone as metals is such that Ru is absorbed in the short wavelength region (wavelength<br>
region in which blue color is emitted) and results in a so-called yellow-tinted black color,<br>
while Au exhibits blue color which is the peak of the wavelength region in which blue<br>
color is emitted). The blue-tinted black color demonstrated in the present invention can<br>
be obtained by combining these two metals. If the ratio of ruthenium to gold is greater<br>
than 40:60, blue color becomes excessively strong, and moves away from the blue-tinted<br>
black color that most strongly accentuates black color, the object of the present invention.<br>
Conversely, if the ratio of ruthenium to gold is smaller than 99:1, the effect of the addition<br>
of metal is eliminated and as a result, black color results in which the inherent yellow<br>
color of the ruthenium is stronger. In addition, the use of ruthenium and gold allows the<br>
obtaining of a transparent conductive film having superior chemical stability.<br>
In the present invention, if at least ruthenium fine particles and gold fine particles are<br>
contained in the conductive layer, although other metal particles, oxide particles, colorant<br>
and so forth may also be contained as necessary, it is preferable to additionally contain<br>
silver fine particles. Although silver fine particles cause yellowing of the conductive film<br>
and result in the hue of transmitted images having a strong yellow color if used alone,<br>
when used in combination with ruthenium fine particles and gold fine particles,<br>
transmitted images take on a black color satisfactorily tinted with blue. In addition, if<br>
silver fine particles are contained, electrical conductivity improves and a conductive film<br>
can be obtained having both superior color tone and electrical conductivity. The content<br>
of silver fine particles is preferably 1-70 wt%, more preferably 5-50 wt%, and even more<br><br>
preferably 10-30 wt%, relative to the total amount of ruthenium fine particles and gold fine<br>
particles.<br>
The particle size of the ruthenium fine particles, gold fine particles and silver fine<br>
particles used in the conductive layer forming coating is preferably within the range of<br>
1-50 nm, and more preferably within the range of 2-30 nm. If the particle size of<br>
individual metal fine particles is less than 1 nm, the properties of the fine particles as a<br>
metal are lost which is undesirable since this causes a decrease in electrical conductivity.<br>
In addition, if the particle size exceeds 50 nm, there is a strong tendency for ruthenium<br>
fine particles, gold fine particles and silver particles to aggregate in the coating, which is<br>
also undesirable since it makes it difficult to form a uniform coated film.<br>
The transparent conductive film of the present invention is able to impart the<br>
function of a selective absorption filter to the transparent conductive film by containing a<br>
colorant in at least one of any of its layers. Consequently, the main wavelength portions<br>
of the three elementary colors of red, green and blue can be selectively absorbed resulting<br>
in improved color contrast and allowing the obtaining of vivid transmitted images.<br>
Although the above colorant may be blended into any of the layers that form the<br>
transparent conductive film, in the case of blending into the conductive layer, the blended<br>
amount is 20 wt% or less, and particularly preferably 10 wt% or less, relative to the<br>
content of metal fine particles. If the blended amount exceeds 20 wt%, decreased<br>
electrical conductivity and inferior film strength are observed, thereby causing impairment<br>
of electromagnetic wave shielding effects.<br>
Examples of colorants that can be used include organic and inorganic pigments such<br>
as monoazo pigment, quiinacridone, iron oxide yellow, disazo pigment, phthalocyanine<br>
green, phthalocyanine blue, cyanine blue, flavanthrone yellow, dianthraquinolyl red,<br><br>
indanthrone blue, thioindigo bordeaux, perylene green, perylene scarlet, perylene red 178,<br>
perylene maroon, dioxadine violet, isoindoline yellow, nickel nitroso yellow, madder lake,<br>
copper azomethine yellow, aniline black, alkaline blue, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, iron<br>
oxide red, chromium oxide, iron oxide black, titanium yellow, cobalt blue, cerian blue,<br>
cobalt green, alumina white, viridian, cadmium yellow, cadmium red, vermilion, lithopone,<br>
chrome yellow, molybdate orange, zinc chromate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, calcium<br>
carbonate, lead white, ultramarine, manganese violet, emerald green, navy blue and carbon<br>
black, various types of dyes such as azo dye, anthraquinone dye, indigoid dye,<br>
phthalocyanine dye, carbonium dye, quinone imine dye, methine dye, quinoline dye, nitro<br>
dye, nitroso dye, benzoquinone dye, naphthoquinone, naphthalim'ide dye and perynone dye.<br>
These colorants can be used alone or as a combination of two or more kinds.<br>
The kind and amount of colorant used should be suitably selected according to the<br>
optical film characteristics of the corresponding transparent conductive film. Absorbance<br>
A of the transparent conductive film is typically expressed with the following equation:<br>
A = log10(Io/I) = εCD<br>
wherein, I0: incident light, I: transmitted light, C: color density, D: optical distance and E:<br>
molar absorption coefficient.<br>
A colorant having a molar absorption coefficient of ε&gt; 10 is typically used in the<br>
transparent conductive film of the present invention. In addition, although the blended<br>
amount of colorant varies dependent upon the molar absorption coefficient of the colorant<br>
used, it is preferably an amount such that the absorbance A of the laminated film and<br>
single layer film in which the colorant is blended is within the range of 0.0004-0.0969 abs.<br>
Failure to satisfy these conditions causes a decrease in transparency and/or anti-reflection<br>
effects.<br><br>
In addition to the metal fine particles mentioned above, the conductive layer in the<br>
transparent conductive film of the present invention may also contain silica fine particles<br>
having a mean particle size of 100 nm or less within the range of 1-80 wt% relative to the<br>
above metal fine particles. A conductive layer in which a film has been formed by<br>
applying the above conductive layer forming coating containing silica fine particles has<br>
remarkably improved film strength and improved scratch strength. In addition, as a result<br>
of containing silica fine particles in the conductive layer, in the case of providing one or<br>
more transparent layers in its upper layer and/or lower layer that has a refractive index that<br>
differs from the refractive index of the conductive layer, there is the advantage of<br>
improved adhesion between both layers due to the satisfactory wettability with the silica<br>
binder component of the transparent layer, while also further improving scratch strength.<br>
Silica fine particles are even more preferably contained within the range of 20-80 wt%<br>
relative to the metal fine particles from the viewpoint of achieving both improved film<br>
strength and electrical conductivity.<br>
In addition, besides the above components, the above conductive layer may also<br>
contain other components as necessary for the purpose of improving film strength and<br>
electrical conductivity, examples of which include inorganic fine particles having for their<br>
main component oxides, compound oxides or nitrides of silicon, aluminum, zirconium,<br>
cerium, titanium, yttrium, zinc, magnesium, indium, tin, antimony and gallium, and<br>
particularly oxides, compound oxides or nitrides of yttrium and tin, organic synthetic<br>
resins such as polyester resin, acrylic resin, epoxy resin, melamine resin, urethane resin,<br>
butyral resin and ultraviolet cured resins, hydrolysis products of metal alkoxides of metals<br>
such as silicon, titanium and zirconium, and organic and inorganic binder components<br>
such as silicone monomer and silicone oligomer.<br><br>
In applying the above conductive layer forming coating containing at least metal fine<br>
particles onto a substrate, any ordinary thin film coating technology can be used such as<br>
spin coating, roll coating, spraying, bar coating, dipping, meniscus coating and gravure<br>
printing. Among these, spin coating is particularly preferable since a thin film of uniform<br>
thickness can be formed in a short period of time.<br>
In addition, in addition to being inexpensive, spray coating allows the nozzle speed,<br>
nozzle height and so forth to be altered during spray coating, thereby making it possible to<br>
change the film thickness within the same plane and create a distribution of film thickness<br>
by changing these parameters. Since many of the substrates used for display screens have<br>
differences in wall thickness within their surface, if a film of uniform thickness is formed<br>
on the surface of the substrate, the distribution of transmittance within the display screen is<br>
not uniform due to the differences in wall thickness of the substrate, resulting in coarse<br>
display images that lack uniformity. Therefore, when the thickness of the inner surface<br>
of cathode ray tube panel is thinner in the center and thicker around the periphery as with<br>
the cathode ray tube panels of flat screen televisions, by making the thickness of the<br>
conductive film formed on the surface thicker in the center and thinner around the<br>
periphery, it is possible to make transmittance uniform within the display screen in which<br>
the cathode ray tube panel and conductive film are combined. Consequently, in the case<br>
of depicting images, since there is no longer any distribution of transmittance within the<br>
display screen, extremely uniform display images can be obtained.<br>
The electrical conductivity performance of the transparent conductive film required<br>
to demonstrate an anti-static function as well as electromagnetic wave shielding effects is<br>
expressed by the following Equation 1.<br>
S = 50 + 101og(1/pf) + 1.7tV"(fp)	Eq. 1<br><br>
wherein,<br>
S (dB): Electromagnetic wave shielding effects,<br>
p (Ωcm): Volumetric specific resistance of conductive film,<br>
f (MHz): Electromagnetic wave frequency, and<br>
t (cm): Film thickness of conductive film.<br>
Here, since it is preferable that film thickness t be about 1 urn (1 x 10-4 cm) or less from<br>
the viewpoint of optical transmittance, if the term containing film thickness t in Equation 1<br>
is ignored, electromagnetic wave shielding effects S can approximately be expressed with<br>
the following Equation 2:<br>
S = 50+ 101og(l/pf)	Eq. 2<br>
Here, electromagnetic wave shielding effects are larger the greater the value of S (dB).<br>
In general, although electromagnetic wave shielding effects are considered to be<br>
superior if S &gt; 60 dB, electromagnetic wave shielding effects of S &gt; 80 dB are desired<br>
with respect to the conductive films of display screens in particular. In addition, since the<br>
frequency of electromagnetic waves, which is subject to regulation, is typically within the<br>
range of 10 kHz to 1000 MHz, the electrical conductivity of transparent conductive films<br>
is required to have a volumetric specific resistance value (p) of 103 Q cm or less. Namely,<br>
the lower the volumetric specific resistance value (p) of a transparent conductive film, the<br>
more effectively it is able to shield electromagnetic waves over a broader frequency range.<br>
In order to satisfy this condition, it is necessary that the film thickness of the conductive<br>
layer in the transparent conductive film be 10 nm or more, and that it contain 10 wt% or<br>
more of metal fine particles. In the case the film thickness is less than 10 nm or the<br>
content of metal fine particles is less than 10 wt%, electrical conductivity decreases,<br>
thereby making it difficult to obtain substantial electromagnetic wave shielding effects.<br><br>
The transparent conductive film of the present invention preferably has at least one<br>
transparent layer laminated for the upper layer and/or lower layer of the above conductive<br>
layer. This transparent layer preferably has a refractive index that differs from the<br>
refractive index of the conductive layer. As a result, not only does it protect the<br>
conductive layer, but it also is able to effectively remove or diminish reflection of external<br>
light at the interlayer interface of the resulting transparent conductive film.<br>
Examples of materials used to form the transparent layer include thermoplastic,<br>
heat-cured or photo- or electron beam-cured resins such as polyester resin, acrylic resin,<br>
epoxy resin and butyral resin, hydrolysis products of the alkoxides of metals such as<br>
silicon, aluminum, titanium and zirconium, and silicone monomers or oligomers either<br>
alone or as a mixture.<br>
A particularly preferable transparent layer is an SiO2 thin film having a high surface<br>
hardness of the film and a comparatively low refractive index. Examples of materials<br>
able to form this SiO2 thin film include compounds represented with the following<br>
formula:<br>
M(OR)mR„<br>
(wherein, M represents Si, R represents a C1-C4 alkyl group, m represents an integer of 1-4,<br>
n represents an integer of 0-3, and m + n is 4), or a mixture of one or more kinds of their<br>
partial hydrolysis products. Tetraethoxysilane (Si(OC2H5)4), which is an example of a<br>
compound having the above formula, is used preferably from the viewpoints of ease of<br>
forming a thin film, transparency, adhesion with the conductive layer, film strength and<br>
anti-reflection performance.<br>
The above transparent layer may contain various resins, metal oxides, compound<br>
oxides or nitrides, or precursors able to form them as a result of baking, provided they can<br><br>
be set to a refractive index that differs from that of the conductive layer.<br>
Similar to the method used to form the conductive layer, formation of the transparent<br>
layer can be carried out by a film forming method in which a coating liquid containing the<br>
above components (to be referred to as the "transparent layer forming coating") is<br>
uniformly applied. Any ordinary thin film coating technology can be used for coating,<br>
examples of which include spin coating, roll coating, spraying, bar coating, dipping,<br>
meniscus coating and gravure printing. Among these, spin coating is a particularly<br>
preferable coating method since a thin film of uniform thickness can be formed in a short<br>
period of time. After coating, a transparent film is obtained by drying the coated film and<br>
baking with the conductive layer at 100-500°C.<br>
Since interlayer interface anti-reflection performance of a multi-layer thin film is<br>
typically determined by the refractive index and film thickness of the thin film as well as<br>
the number of laminated thin films, in the transparent conductive film of the present<br>
invention as well, effective anti-reflection performance can be obtained by designing the<br>
thicknesses of the respective conductive and transparent layers in consideration of the<br>
number of laminated layers of the conductive layer and transparent layer.<br>
In the case of a multi-layer films capable of preventing reflection, when the<br>
wavelength of the reflected light to be prevented is taken to be X, reflection can be<br>
effectively prevented by using optical film thicknesses of λ./4 and λ/4 or λ/2 and λ/4,<br>
respectively, for the high refractive index layer and low refractive index layer from the<br>
substrate side in the case of an anti-reflecting film composed of two layers.<br>
In addition, in the case of an anti-reflecting film composed of three layers, it is<br>
effective to use optical film thicknesses of λ./4, λ/2 and λ/4 in that order for the<br>
intermediate refractive index layer, high refractive index layer and low refractive index<br><br>
layer from the substrate.<br>
In consideration of production ease and economic feasibility in particular, it is<br>
preferable form on the upper layer of the conductive layer an SiO2 film (refractive index:<br>
1.46) having a comparatively low refractive index and compatible and capable of forming<br>
a hard coating at a film thickness of λ/4.<br>
In the transparent conductive film of the present invention containing a conductive<br>
layer and a transparent layer, baking of the conductive layer and transparent layer may be<br>
carried out sequentially or simultaneously. For example, the conductive layer and<br>
transparent layer can be formed simultaneously to form a low reflecting transparent<br>
conductive film by applying a conductive layer forming coating to the display screen of a<br>
display device, applying a transparent layer forming coating to its upper layer and then<br>
baking both at a temperature of 100-500°C after drying.<br>
A transparent layer having surface irregularities is preferably provided on the<br>
outermost layer of the above transparent conductive film. This irregular surface layer has<br>
the effect of imparting superior anti-glare properties to the display screen by scattering<br>
surface reflected light of the transparent conductive film. Silica is preferable for the<br>
material of this irregular surface layer from the viewpoints of surface hardness and<br>
refractive index. This irregular surface layer can be formed by applying an irregular<br>
surface layer forming coating as the outermost layer of the above transparent conductive<br>
film by various coating methods in the same manner as previously described, and<br>
simultaneously or separately baking at a temperature of 100-500°C. Spin coating is<br>
particularly preferable for the coating method of the irregular surface layer.<br>
The display device of the present invention has any of the above transparent<br>
conductive films formed on a display screen. This display device is not subjected to the<br><br>
adhesion of dust and so forth to the image display screen since static electricity on the<br>
display screen is prevented, various kinds of electromagnetic wave interference are<br>
prevented since it is shielded from electromagnetic waves, the images are bright due to its<br>
superior light transmittance, the hue of transmitted images is natural and they have high<br>
contrast, the appearance of the display screen is smooth, and there are hardly any<br>
restrictions on handling due to its high chemical stability. In addition, if the above<br>
transparent layer and/or irregular surface layer is formed in addition to the conductive<br>
layer, superior anti-reflecting effects and/or anti-glare effects are obtained with respect to<br>
external light.<br>

(Evaluation Testing)<br>
The performance of the low-reflecting transparent conductive films formed on<br>
the cathode ray tubes was tested using the devices or methods described below, or the<br>
appearance was evaluated by visual observation.<br>
Film thickness: Measured by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) observation<br>
Surface resistance: Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation "Loresta AP" (four terminal<br>
probe method)<br>
Electromagnetic wave shielding: Calculated according to the previously indicated<br>
Equation 1 based on 0.5 MHz<br>
Salt water resistance: 0.5 MHz electromagnetic wave shielding effects after<br>
immersing for 3 days in salt water<br>
Transmittance: Tokyo Denshoku Co., Ltd. Japan "Automatic Haze Meter HIII DP"<br>
Haze: Tokyo Denshoku Co., Ltd. Japan "Automatic Haze Meter HIII DP"<br>
Transmittance difference: The difference between maximum transmittance and<br>
minimum transmittance in the visible light region was determined using the Hitachi Ltd.<br>
"U-3500" self-recording spectrophotometer. (The smaller the difference between the<br>
maximum transmittance and minimum transmittance in the visible light region is, the<br>
flatter the transmittance, and the closer the hue of transmitted images approaches natural<br><br>
coloring is, and when 10% or less in particular, the dark portions of transmitted images<br>
approach black allowing the obtaining of more deeply colored images.)<br>
Transmitted color: The color (a*, b*) values of transmitted colors in the visible light<br>
region were determined using the Hitachi Ltd. "U-3500" self-recording spectrophotometer.<br>
(As the "a*","b*" color value of transmitted colors in the visible light region approaches<br>
zero, transmitted color becomes blacker. In addition, if the value of "a*" becomes<br>
negative, black color becomes tinted with blue which is most strongly perceived as black<br>
by the human eye, thereby enabling the hue of transmitted images to become more vivid.)<br>
Visible reflectance: EG&amp;G Gamma Scientific "Model C-11"<br>
Scratch test: The film surface was rubbed with the metal end of a mechanical pencil<br>
under a load of 1 kg followed by visual evaluation of the degree of scratching.<br>
O: Not scratched<br>
A: Slightly scratched<br>
x : Scratched<br>
Visibility: Overall evaluation of low reflection performance, reflected color and<br>
transmitted colors.<br>
The results of evaluation testing are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br><br>
Based on the results of Tables 1 and 2, as compared with the cathode ray tubes of<br>
Comparative Examples 1 through 3, those of Embodiments 1 through 6 can be seen to<br>
have a transmittance difference of 10% or less and hues of transmitted images that<br>
approach natural color, the dark portions of transmitted images approach black, and deep<br><br>
images are obtained. In addition, with respect to transmitted color as well, in contrast to<br>
the values of "a*", "b*" of the cathode ray tubes of Embodiments 1 through 6 approaching<br>
zero and the value of "a*" being negative, the value of "b*" of the cathode ray tubes of<br>
Comparative Examples 1 through 3 and 5 are large at 5 to 12, while the values of "a*" in<br>
Comparative Examples 2 and 4 are positive. Thus, in comparison with the cathode ray<br>
tubes of Comparative Examples 1 through 5, the cathode ray tubes of Embodiments 1<br>
through 6 have black color tinted with blue, which is most strongly perceived as black by<br>
the human eye, and the hue of the transmitted images can be understood to be vivid. In<br>
addition, in comparison with Comparative Example 2 of the prior art which only uses<br>
silver fine particles, salt water resistance can be seen to be significantly improved.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Since the transparent conductive film of the present invention has a conductive layer<br>
containing at least ruthenium fine particles and gold fine particles, in addition to having<br>
superior anti-static effects and electromagnetic wave shielding effects, it also has superior<br>
chemical stability, and when applied to the display screen of a display device, the<br>
transmitted images exhibit a black color tinted with blue and contrast is improved, thereby<br>
allowing the obtaining of vivid images having superior visibility.<br><br>
