INK-JET AUTHENTICATION MARK FOR A PRODUCT OR PRODUCT<br>
PACKAGING<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]  The invention relates to an authentication mark for application utilizing ink-jet printing to a product or product packaging that allows at least partial determination whether the product or product packaging is authentic.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002] Authentication marks are used in product packaging to protect the brand identity. Brand identity plays an important role in the marketplace. It provides a means for consumers to identify and rely on products coming from a particular source. It also provides a means for companies to attract and build goodwill with customers, thereby encouraging repeat business. Companies therefore spend billions of dollars on advertising and product development to establish such brand identity.<br>
[0003]  Authentication marks are also used in security documents, for example, in identification cards, driver licenses and bankcards. A security document normally combines a number of security features. Usually the number of security features increases with the risk and the consequences if a fake security document would be used. Additional security features are often applied by introduction of complex processes. In US 20040219287 (UCB), particles tagged with a DNA strand are used for labelling an article for security, identification and/or authentication purposes,<br>
[0004]  Frequently, it is required that the label on a product packaging or the security document contains unique information, e.g. a product serial number respectively personal information such as name, address and a passport photograph. Ink-jet printing has proven to be a very suitable technique to print variable information and images to a security document or a label of a product packaging.<br>
[0005]   US 20020105569 (HP) discloses an ink-jet printing system to create a security document using different ink types. The secure document is based on a pigment type ink printed upon a porous ink receiver to form an opaque layer, that can be removed by use of mild abrasion so as to reveal<br>
 <br>
a secure message printed earlier with a dye penetrant ink on the porous ink receiver.<br>
Pigmented ink-jet inks are also used in US 2005042396 (DIGIMARC) to assemble identification cards.<br>
US 20030194532 (3M) discloses the manufacture of secure ID badges by using ink-jet printing in an image retaining laminate assembly comprising; a first substrate comprising a first surface and one or more projections extending beyond the first surface, the projections defining a second surface of the first substrate, and a second substrate overlaying the second surface of the first substrate.<br>
In US 6837959 (AGFA) ink-jet printing is used to manufacture identification cards containing a watermark revealed by partial impregnation of a UV-curable lacquer into a porous opaque ink-receiving layer.<br>
US 2004262909 (GIESECKE &amp; DEVRIENT) discloses a method for individualizing security documents comprising the steps of; providing a document having a first, high security quality printed image (1) comprising mutually contrasting light and dark areas (la. lb), and printing at least part of the first printed image (1) with a second printed image (2), characterized in that the material selected for printing the second printed image (2) is a material that is repelled either by the dark areas (1b) or by the light areas (1a) of the first printed image (1) and is deposited in the accordingly other areas (la or lb) so that it remains only in said other areas. There have been many attempts to provide security features that are tamperproof or cannot be falsified. However, it has been the experience that after a certain period of time the counterfeiters catch up with the technology used by the industry. There is therefore a constant need to provide novel security features, which are not easy to duplicate, but still using simple processes for their application to a product or product packaging. Objects of the invention<br>
 <br>
[0011]   It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple method for the application to a product or product packaging of novel authentication marks.<br>
[0012]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide a product or product packaging having authentication marks, which are not easy to duplicate.<br>
[0013]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>

[0052] The dry thickness of the ink-receiving layer or the ink-receiving layers, in the case of multiple layers, is preferably at least 5 pm, more preferably at least at 10 pm and most preferably at least 15 pm.<br>
[0053] The different layers can be coated onto the support by any conventional coating technique, such as dip coating, knife coating, extrusion coating, spin coating, slide hopper coating and curtain coating.<br>
Supports<br>
[0054]  The support of the ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method<br>
according to the present invention can be chosen from paper type and polymeric type supports.

Other examples of useful high-quality polymeric supports for the present invention include opaque white polyesters and extrusion blends of polyethylene terephthaiate and polypropylene. Polyester film supports and especially poly(ethylene terephthaiate) are preferred because of their excellent properties of dimensional stability. When such a polyester is used as the support material, a subbing layer may be employed to improve the bonding of the ink-receiving layer to the support. Useful subbing layers for this purpose are well known in the photographic art and include, for example, polymers of vinylidene chloride such as vinylidene chloride/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid terpolymers or vinylidene chloride/methyl acrylate/itaconic acid terpolymers.<br>
[0055]  Polyolefins are preferred support:s for thermal lamination onto a substrate, which is preferably a polyolefin-coated substrate, such as polyolefin-coated paper or carton.<br>
[0056]  The support of the ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method<br>
according to the present invention may also be made from an inorganic material, such as a metal oxide or a metal (e.g. aluminium and steel).<br>
[0057] The support of the ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method<br>
according to the present invention preferably consists of the product itself or the product packaging to be foreseen with authentication marks,<br>
[0058]  In one embodiment the support of the ink receivers used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention is a transparent support. It was found that authentication marks could be created with dye based inkjet inks exhibiting a higher optical density of the main image in the uncured areas than in the cured areas, i.e. the security image, when looked at in reflection. But when one looks from the backside, i.e. through the transparent support, the main image exhibited a lower optical density than the security image. Such authentication marks can be advantageously used in security badges and identification cards.<br>

[0062]  Suitable polymeric particles include polystyrene and styrene-acrylic<br>
copolymer particles having a 0.5pm particle diameter and a 0.1pm shell.<br>
 <br>
[0063]  In one embodiment the filler acts as an opacifier rendering the ink-receiving layer non-transparent.<br>
[0054]  In another embodiment the filler has magnetic properties which can be used to Introduce additional security features,<br>
[0065] The ratio of filler to polymeric binder is preferably between 20/1 and 3/1 for preparing an ink-receiving layer with a high porosity, a so-called micro-porous or a macro-porous ink-receiving layer.<br>
Curable compounds<br>
[0066] Any monomer or oligomer may be used as the curable compound in the ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention. However in coating the ink-receiving layer from an aqueous coating composition preferably water-soluble or a water-dispersable monomers are used.<br>
[0067] A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may also be used. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used.<br>
[0068]  The curable compound(s) used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention can be any monomer and/or oligomer found in Polymer Handbook, Vol. 1 + 2. 4thth edition. Edited by J. BRANDRUP, et al. Wiley-lnterscience, 1999.<br>
[0069]  Suitable examples of monomers include: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid (or their salts), maleic anhydride; alkyl(meth)acrylates (linear, branched and cycloalkyi) such as methyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate and 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate; aryl(meth)acrylates such as benzyl(meth)acrylate and phenyl(meth)acrylate; hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylates such as hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate; (meth)acrylates with other types of functionalities (e.g. oxirane, amino, fluoro, polyethylene oxide, phosphate-substituted) such as glycidyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, trifluoroethyl acrylate,<br>
 <br>
methoxypolyethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate and<br>
tripropyieneglycol(meth)acrylate phosphate; ally! derivatives such as allyl glycfdyl ether; styrenics such as styrene, 4-methylstyrene, 4-hydroxystyrene, and 4-acetoxystyrene; (meth)acrylonitrile; (meth)acrylamides (including N-mono and N,N-disubstituted) such as N-benzyl (meth)acrylamide; maleimides such as N-phenyl maleimide, N-benzyl maleimide and N-ethyl maleimide; vinyl derivatives such as vinylcaprolactam, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylimidazole, vinylnaphthalene and vinyl halides; vinylethers such as vinylmethyl ether; and vinylesters of carboxylic acids such as vinylacetate and vinylbutyrate.<br>
initiators<br>
[0070] The ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention preferably also contains an initiator. The initiator typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable fluid may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Nonish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
[0071]  The thennal initiator(s) suitable for use in the curable fluid include tert-Amyl peroxybenzoate, 4,4-Azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid), 1,1'-Azobls(cyclohexanecarbonitrile). 2,2'-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), Benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)butane, 1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane,1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 2,5-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-Bis( tert-Butylperoxy)-2.5-dimethyl-3-hexyne, Bis(1-( tert-butylperoxy)-1-methylethyl)ben2ene, 1,1-Bis( tert-butylperoxy)-3,3.5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, tert-Butyl peracetate, tert-Butyl peroxide, tert-Butyi peroxybenzoate. tert-Butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate, Cumene hydroperoxide, Cyclohexanone peroxide, Dicumyl peroxide, LauroyI peroxide, 2,4- Pentanedlone peroxide. Peracetic acid and Potassium persulfate.<br>
[0072]  The photo-initiator absorbs light and is responsible for the production of free radicals or cations. Free radicals or cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with<br>
 <br>
polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br>
[0073]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
[0074]  A combination of different types of initiator, for example, a photo-initiator and a themial initiator can also be used.<br>
[0075]  A preferred Norrish type l-initiator is selected from the group consisting of benzoinethers, benzil ketals, a,a-dialkoxyacetophenones, a-hydroxyalkyiphenones, a-aminoalkylphenones, acylphosphine oxides, acylphosphine sulphides, a-haloketones, a-halosulfones and a-halophenylglyoxalates,<br>
[0076]  A preferred Norrish type ll-initiator is selected from the group consisting of benzophenones, thioxanthones, 1,2-diketones and anthraquinones. A preferred co-initiator is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic amine, an aromatic amine and a thiol.

[0080]   Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufficient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
[0081]  The ink-receiving layer may contain a photo-initiator system containing photo-initiator(s) and one or more sensitizer dyes that absorb light and transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizer dyes include photoreducible xanthene, fluorene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene. thiazine, oxazine, coumarin, pyronine, porphyrin, acridine, azo, diazo. cyanine, merocyanine, diarylmethyl, triarylmethyl, anthraquinone, phenylenediamine, benzimidazole, fluorochrome, quinoline, tetrazole, naphthol, benzidine, rhodamine, indigo and/or indanthrene dyes. Also suitable are optical brighteners. The amount of the sensitizer dyes is in general from 0.01 to 15 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 5 wt%, based in each case on the total dry weight of the ink-receiving layer.<br>
[0082]   In order to increase the photosensitivity further, the ink-receiving layer may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines. of titanocenes and ketoxime ethers and of acridines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known, A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved by adding dibenzalacetone or amino acid derivatives. The amount of co-initiator or co-initiators is in<br>
 <br>
general from 0.01 to 20 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 10 wt%, based in each case on the total dry weight of the ink-receiving layer.<br>
[0083]  A preferred amount of initiator is 0,01 to 20 wt%, preferably 0.5 to 15.0 wt% of the total weight of curable compound(s).<br>
Inhibitors<br>
[0084] The ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may further contain a polymerization inhibitor to restrain polymerization by heat or actinic radiation during storage.<br>
[0085]  Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants,<br>
hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acryiate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used. Of these, a phenol compound having a double bond in molecules derived from acrylic acid is particularly prefen-ed due to its having a polymerization-restraining effect even when heated in a closed, oxygen-free environment. Suitable inhibitors are. for example, Sumilizer'"M GA-80, Sumilizer™ GM and Sumilizer"^'^ GS produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.; Ciba Irgastab™ UVIO from CIBA Specialty Products and Genorad™ 16 available from RAHN.<br>
[0086] Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the sensitivity to curing, it is prefen-ed that the amount capable of preventing undesired polymerization be determined prior to coating.<br>
Surfactants<br>
[0087]  The ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity below 10 wt% based of the coating composition.<br>
Biocides<br>
[0088]  The ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may contain a biocide.<br>

sodium benzoate, sodium pyridinethion-1-oxide, ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate<br>
 <br>
and 1,2-benzisothia2oiin-3-one and salts thereof. A preferred biocide for the curable fluid is ProxeF'^GXL available from ZENECA COLOURS.<br>
[0090] A biocide is preferably added in an amount of 0.001 to 3 wt%, more preferably 0.01 to 1 wt%, each based on the total weight of the ink-receiving layer.<br>

[0093]  The colorant used in the ink-receiving layer may be cyan, magenta, yellow, red, orange, violet, blue, green, brown, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
[0094]   Suitable colorants for the ink-receiving layer used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention include those listed below for the ink-jet ink.<br>
[0095]   In one embodiment the colorant is a fluorescent colorant used to introduce an additional security feature.

Curing means<br>
[0096]  The ink-receiving layer containing the curable compound can be cured by exposing it to actinic radiation, by thermal curing and/or by electron beam curing according to a first image, the so-called "security mage". A preferred means of radiation curing is ultraviolet radiation. The actinic radiation can be applied in a spotwise fashion, e.g. a laser, or by actinic radiation through a mask.<br>
[0097]  Any ultraviolet light source, as long as part of the emitted light can be<br>
absorbed by the photo-initiator(system), may be employed as a radiation source, such as, a high or low-pressure mercury lamp, a cold cathode tube, a black light, an ultraviolet LED, an ultraviolet laser, and a flash light.<br>
 <br>
Of these, the preferred source is one exhibiting a relatively long wavelength UV-contribution having a dominant wavelength of 300-400 nm. Specifically, a UV-A light source is preferred. [0098]   UV radiation is generally classed as UV-A. UV-B, and UV-C as follows:<br>
•	UV-A: 400 nm to 320 nm<br>
•	UV-B: 320 nm to 290 nm<br>
•	UV-C: 290 nm to 100 nm.<br>
[0099]  Furthermore, it is possible to cure the security image using two light<br>
sources of differing wavelength or illuminance. For example, the first UV source can be selected to be rich in UV-C, in particular in the range of 240 nm-200 nm. The second UV source can then be rich in UV-A. e.g. a gallium-doped lamp, or a different lamp high in both UV-A and UV-B. The use of two UV sources has been found to have advantages e.g. a fast curing speed.<br>
[0100]  Thermal curing can be performed image-wise by use of a thermal head, a heat stylus, hot stamping, a laser beam, etc. If a laser beam is used, then preferably an infrared laser is used in combination with an infrared dye in the ink-receiving layer.<br>

preferably 0.01 to 1.00 wt. %, each based on the total weight of the ink-jet ink.<br>
pH adjusters<br>
[0154]  The ink-jet ink used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may contain at least one pH adjuster. Suitable pH adjusters include NaOH, KOH, NEta. NH3. HOI, HNO3 and H2SO4. Preferred pH adjusters are KOH, NaOH and H2SO4,<br>
Humectants<br>
[0155]  Suitable humectants include triacetin, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, glycerol, urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, alkyl urea, alkyl thiourea, dialkyi urea and dialkyi thiourea, diols, including ethanediols, propanediols, propanetriols, butanediols, pentanediols, and hexanediols; glycols, including propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures and derivatives thereof. A prefen'ed humectant is polyethylene glycol and added to the ink-jet ink formulation in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt% of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt% of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 4.0 to 6.0 v/l%.<br>
Other additives<br>
[0156]  In addition to the constituents, described above, the ink-jet ink may, if necessary, further contain following additives to have desired performance; evaporation accelerators, rust inhibitors, crosslinking agents, soluble electrolytes as conductivity aid, sequestering agents and chelating agents, magnetic particles to introduce additional security features,...<br>
Preparation of ink-jet ink<br>
 <br>
[0157]  The ink-jet ink used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention can be prepared by simply mixing all components when the colorant is a dye. When pigments are used, a pigment dispersion may be prepared by mixing, milling and dispersion of pigment and polymeric dispersant. Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0158]  Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
[0159]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is preferably performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat.<br>
[0160]   If the ink-jet ink used in the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention contains more than one pigment, the ink-jet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0161]  The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0162]  The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mil! grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier such as water. For ink-jet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0163]  The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and<br>
 <br>
desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0164]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill. e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0165]   In general it is desirable to make the ink-jet inks in the fomi of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the ink-jet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. If the mill grind was made in a solvent, it is diluted with water and optionally other solvents to the appropriate concentration. If it was made in water, it is diluted with either additional water or water miscible solvents to make a mill grind of the desired concentration. By dilution, the ink-jet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour,, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Overcoat layer<br>
[0166]  In a preferred embodiment, the cured and ink-jet printed ink-receiver is coated with a radiation curable coating composition. The curing of this overcoat layer may result in changes of the contrast depending on the fact if a pigmented or a dye based ink-jet ink was used to print the main image partially overlapping with the security image.<br>
[0167]  Another observation is that the overcoat layer results in the fomiation of a relief with differences of height between 5 to 10 pm. This kind of tactile printing can be used for introducing security features.<br>
[0168] In further preferred embodiment a transparent protective foil is laminated on the overcoat layer. This protective foil may contain additional security features.<br>
[0169]  An overall curing can be performed as final step on the material including said optional protective foil.<br>
Industrial applicability<br>
 <br>
[0170]  The authentication mark obtained by the ink-jet printing method according to the present invention may be used in security documents, official documents issued by governments or other official and commercial institutions, bank notes, bonds, currency notes, cheques, share certificates, stamps, tax receipts, official records, diplomas, identification documents, security tags, labels, tickets, security badges, credit cards, packaging, brands, trademarks, logos or documents suitable for attachment to and/or association with a product of substantial value such as antique objects, audio and/or visual media (e.g. compact disks, audio tapes and video tapes), chemical products , tobacco products, clothing articles, wines and alcoholic beverages, entertainment goods, foodstuffs, electrical and electronic goods, computer software, high technology machines and equipment, jewellery, leisure items, perfumes and cosmetics, products related to the treatment, diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of humans and animals, military equipment, photographic industry goods, scientific instruments and spare parts therefor, machinery and spare parts for the transport industry and travel goods.<br>

available from AGFA-GEVAERT as P100C S/S AS. EXAMPLE 1 [0174]  This example illustrates the method of ink-jet printing used to manufacture<br>
authentication marks. Preparation of the ink receiver [0175]  First a dispersion of silica, named DISP-1, was prepared by mixing the<br>
components according to Table 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0176]  The dispersion DISP-1 was then used to prepare the coating solutions COAT-1 to COAT-9 by mixing the polymer latex Co(Et-ViAc), the monomer Laromer™ PE 55 WN, the photo-initiator Irgacure™ 500 (6 \Art% with respect to the monomer content) and water according to Table 2. The concentration of the polymer latex Co(Et-ViAc) was altered to have a SiPo ratio, i.e. the ratio of wt% DISP-1 over wt% Co(Et-ViAc), varying from 7.4 to 1.7. The concentration of the monomer was also altered.<br>
 <br>
[0177] The coating solutions COAT-1 to COAT-9 were coated on PET100 by<br>
means of a coating knife (wet thickness SOpm). The coated ink-receivers REC-1 to REC-9 were then dried for 4 minutes in an oven at 60X.<br>
Curing of the ink receiver<br>
[0178] The ink receivers REC-1 to REC-9 were exposed through a photographic mask that defines security patterns (e.g. thin lines) in a CDL1502i from AGFA-GEVAERT at Level 3 (= 4000 uW/cm2) for 650 seconds.<br>
Ink-jet printing<br>
 <br>
[0179]  An EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R800 from SEIKO EPSON was used with an EPSON R800 ink-jet ink set and a printer setting "PHOTO (+ HIGH SPEED)" to print an image containing a picture of a person and some text onto the ink-receivers REC-1 to REC-9 in a way that the image was partially printed onto cured areas and partially onto uncured areas of the ink receivers REC-1 to REC-9.<br>
Result and evaluation<br>
[0180]  Authentication marks were visible on all printed samples of the ink<br>
receivers REC-1 to REC-9, The image contrast of the authentication mark increased with the SiPo ratio. However, the printed samples of REC-1 to REC-3 with the highest SiPo ratio and the highest image contrast exhibited less reliable transport in the EPSON PHOTO STYLUS™ R800 ink-jet printer. The printed samples of REC-8 and REC-9 containing lower concentrations of the UV-curable monomer exhibited authentication marks with good contrast if looked at in reflection, but with low contrast in transmission.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0181]  This example illustrates how different types of authentication marks can be obtained by using an opacifier, the application of a UV-curable overcoat layer and/or dye based or pigment based ink-jet inks.<br>
Preparation of authentication marks<br>
[0182] A first ink receiver was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 using the coating solution COAT-4. A second ink receiver was prepared that was identical to the first ink receiver except that an opacifier Ropaque™ HP91 was added to the coating solution COAT-4 in an amount of 7.5 v^%. The ink receivers were exposed through a mask and cured in the same way as in Example 1. Samples C and D were obtained by printing on the two ink-receivers in the same manner as in Example 1 with an EPSON STYLUS™ PHOTO R800 ink-jet printer using an EPSON R800 ink set, which consist of aqueous pigment based inks. For samples A and B, the ink-jet printer EPSON STYLUS™ PHOTO R300 with an aqueous dye based EPSON R300 ink set was used.<br>
Table 3<br>
 <br>
Overooat layer <br>
[0183]  A UV-curable coating composition was prepared by mixing the components according to Table 4.<br>
 <br>
samples A to D using a bar coater and a 30 pm wired bar. The samples AO, BO, CO and DO were obtained by curing the over-coated samples A to D using a Fusion DRSE-120 conveyer, equipped with a Fusion VPS/1600 lamp (D-bulb), which transported the samples under the UV lamp on a conveyer belt at a speed of 20 m/min.<br>
Result and evaluation<br>
[0185]  It was observed that different combinations of opacifier, ink-jet Ink and<br>
presence or absence of an overcoat layer resulted in different contrasts for the authentication marks.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0186]  From Table 5 it can be seen that the presence of an overcoat layer<br>
resulted in low contrast authentication marks if dye based ink-jet inks were used. In the absence of an overcoat layer, a higher contrast was observed for a dye based EPSON R300 ink-jet ink set compared to the pigment based EPSON R800 ink-jet ink set. in the presence of an overcoat layer, a good contrast was visible with pigmented ink-jet inks but not with dye based ink-jet inks.<br>
[0187]  It will be clear that these differences can be advantageously exploited to enhance the difficulty for counterfeiters to duplicate the authentication marks.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0188]  This example illustrates the use of a water-soluble monomer as radiation curable compound in the ink-receiving layer.<br>
Preparation of the ink receiver<br>
[0189]  The dispersion DISP-1 of EXAMPLE 1 was used to prepare the coating solution COAT-10 according to Table 6 by admixing the polymer latex Go(Et-ViAc), the water-soluble monomer Sartomer™ SR9035 . the photo-initiator Irgacure™ 500 (6 wt% with respect to the monomer content) and water.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0190]  The coating solution COAT-10 was coated on PET100 by means of a<br>
coating knife (wet thickness 120um), The coated ink-receiver REC-10 was then dried for 4 minutes in an oven at 60*'C.<br>
Curing of the ink receiver<br>
[0191] The ink receiver REC-10 was exposed through a photographic mask that defines security patterns (e.g. thin lines) in a CDL1502i from AGFA-GEVAERT at Level 3 (= 4000 pW/cm^) for 650 seconds.<br>
Preparation of authentication marks<br>
[0192]  Samples E and F were obtained by printing on the ink-receiver REC-10 in the same manner as in Example 1 with an EPSON STYLUS™ PHOTO R300 ink-jet printer using a dye based EPSON R300 ink set, respectively with the ink-jet printer EPSON STYLUS™ PHOTO R800 with an aqueous pigment based EPSON R800 ink set was used.<br>
[0193]  The UV-curable coating composition of Table 4 in EXAMPLE 2 was coated onto the ink-jet printed samples E and F using a bar coater and a 30 pm wired bar. The samples EO and FO were obtained by curing the over-coated samples E to F using a Fusion DRSE-120 conveyer, equipped with a Fusion VPS/1600 lamp (D-bulb), which transported the samples under the UV lamp on a conveyer belt at a speed of 20 m/min.<br>
 <br>
[0194]  The pigmented inks of the Epson R800 ink-jet ink set produced a higher contrast if the overcoat layer was present. The dye based Inks of the Epson R300 ink-jet ink set produced a high contrast with and without a cured overcoat layer.<br>
[0195]  The optical density of a homogeneous dark grey-blue image-part of<br>
sample E was measured in transmission using a MacBethTM TD904 with a green filter to be 1.17 in an uncured area and 1.39 in an cured area. The<br>
 <br>
optical density of a homogeneous blue image-part of the over-coated sample EO was measured in reflection using a MacBeth™ RD918SB with a red filter to be 1.16 in an uncured area and 0.61 in an cured area. The over-coated sample EO also exhibited a relief with differences of height between 5 to 10 pm. This kind of tactile printing can be used for introducing security features.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0196]  This example illustrates the use of UV curable Inkjet inks for printing the main image.<br>
Preparation of the ink receiver<br>
[0197]  The coated and dried ink-receiver REC-10 of EXAMPLE 3 was used.<br>
Curing of the ink receiver<br>
[0198]  The ink receiver REC-10 was exposed through a photographic mask that defines security pattems (e.g. thin lines) in a CDL1502i from AGFA-GEVAERT at Level 3 (= 4000 MW/cm2) for 650 seconds.<br>
Result and evaluation<br>
[0199]  AGORIXTM UV curable CMYK Inkjet inkset from AGFA was used to print the main image with a custom build printer equipped with a UPH™ printhead from AGFA. The inks were jetted at 8 dpd and 360x360 dpi on cured and uncured areas of the exposed and cured ink receiver REC-10, The ink receiver was then cured using a Fusion DRSE-120 conveyer, equipped with a Fusion VPS/1600 lamp (D-bulb), which transported the samples under the UV lamp on a conveyer belt at a speed of 20 m/min.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
[0201] The results of the optical density of a homogeneous green and red image-part measured in transmission using a MacBeth™ TD904 and in reflection using a MacBeth™ RD918SB with filters according to Table 8 illustrate the contrast of the created authentication marks..<br>
