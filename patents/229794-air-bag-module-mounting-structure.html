A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the<br><br>
drawings- FIG- 1 is a general side view of a motorcycle 1 using an air bag module mounting structure according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The motorcycle 1 has a frame 2 composed mainly of a head pipe<br>
3	and a pair of right and left upper tubes 2R and 2L (the right upper tube 2R being shown in FIG. 4) extending rearward from the head pipe 3 so as to be inclined down toward the rear end of the vehicle. A pair of lower tubes<br>
4	extend downward from the upper tubes 2R and 2L at a position near the head pipe 3, and an engine 15 as a driving source is fixedly hung from the lower ends of the lower tubes 4. A pair of right and left front forks 7 steerable by a handle 4 are pivotably mounted through a lower bracket 6 to the head pipe 3, and a front wheel WF is rotatably supported through its axle to the lower ends of the front forks 7. A seat frame 5 for supporting a main seat 10 and a rear seat 11 is connected to a rear portion of the frame 2. Further, a swing arm (not shown) is pivotably connected to the frame 2, and a rear wheel WR as a drive wheel is rotatably supported through its axle to the rear ends of the swing arm.<br>
[0022]<br>
The motorcycle 1 according to this preferred embodiment is provided with an air bag 50 adapted to be<br><br>
inflated into a substantially spherical shape having such a size as to cover the upper side of the main seat 10 and to touch a meter case 36 and the vicinity of a windscreen<br>
9	provided at the upper end of an upper cowl 8 in the event that an impact greater in level than a predetermined value is applied to the vehicle body. An air bag module 20 including the air bag 50 and an<br>
inflator (not shown) for generating a gas for inflating the air bag 50 is fixed through a pair of supporting stays 21 to the upper tubes 2R and 2L at positions on the front side of a rider seating position on the main seat<br>
10	in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. A pair of supporting belts 51 are connected at their upper ends to a rear portion of the air bag 50, so as to keep the air bag 50 at a proper position in effectively restraining the rider.<br>
[0023]<br>
FIG. 2 is an enlarged perspective view of an essential part of the motorcycle 1 shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2 , the same reference numerals as those shown in FIG 1 denote the same or like parts. The air bag module 20 (see FIG. 1) has a boxlike casing 23 and a substantially rectangular module cover 22 for closing the upper side of the casing 23. The inflator and the air bag 50 in its<br><br>
folded condition are accommodated in the casing 23. The air bag module 20 is installed between an ignition cover 12 and a fuel filler lid 13. The ignition cover 12 is located so as to cover the upper side of a top bridge (not shown) for connecting the handle 4 and the front forks 7. The fuel filler lid 13 is located above a fuel tank (not shown). The inflation of the air bag 50 is performed in such a manner that the gas generated from the inflator is instantaneously supplied to the air bag 50 folded in the casing 23 of the air bag module 20 and that the module cover 22 is pivotally opened about its front side by the pressure of this gas inflating the air bag 50. The supporting belts 51 are normally accommodated in their folded condition in the spaces 65 defined below a pair of right and left belt covers 14R and 14L, respectively. In concert with the inflation of the air bag 50, the supporting belts 51 forcibly open the belt covers 14R and 14L in the laterally opposite directions of the vehicle, and extend upward as shown by the broken lines in FIG. 2. [0024]<br>
While the handle 4 shown in FIG. 2 is in a left steered condition, a front lower portion of the air bag 50 in its inflated condition is stably supported at four<br><br>
positions, that is, at a first position I near a left switch portion 74L of the handle 4 in a neutral condition of the handle 4, a second position J near a right switch portion 74R of the handle 4 in the neutral condition thereof, a third position H on the meter case 36, and a fourth position K on the module cover 22. The lower ends of the supporting belts 51 are firmly secured to a vehicle body member at a position below the main seat 10 located above a top shelter 71R. [0025]<br>
FIG. 3A is a perspective view of the motorcycle 1 at the time the air bag 50 is inflated. The rear surface of the air bag 50 in its inflated condition as opposed to the rider is formed as a substantially V-shaped surface as viewed in plan, so as to effectively embrace the rider 100. As mentioned above, the air bag 50 in its inflated condition is supported not only by the supporting belts 51, but also by the whole of members located below front and lower portions of the air bag 50, including the handle 4 and the meter case 36. Further, the right and left side surfaces of the air bag 50 at its upper portion are formed with a pair of vent holes 56 (e.g., f45) for discharging the gas from the air bag 50 at a proper speed under the condition where the rider 100 is being<br><br>
restrained by the air bag 50. [0026]<br>
FIG. 3B is an enlarged side view showing a condition where the rider 100 is restrained by the air bag 5 0 in its inflated condition. As shown in FIG. 3B, the second supporting belt 58 for connecting a pair of right and left joint portions 57 so as to horizontally extend like an arch is provided below the vent holes 56. The second supporting belt 58 functions to restrict excess development of the air bag 50 in the horizontal direction at the time of restraining the rider 100. Further, a pair of right and left recessed portions X shown in FIG. 3B corresponding to the upward projections of the handle 4 at its right and left portions are formed at a lower portion of the air bag 50, and these recessed portions X contribute to effective support of the air bag 50. [0027]<br>
FIGS. 3C and 3D show sectional shapes of the air bag 50 along horizontal planes containing a point Y (rider’s head) and a point Z (rider’s breast) shown in FIG. 3B, respectively. As shown in FIGS. 3C and 3Df the sectional V-shape of the rear surface of the air bag 50 opposed to the rider 100 is formed so as to fit the<br><br>
shapes of the head and breast of the rider 100. Accordingly, the V-shaped rear surface of the air bag 50 can restrain the rider 100 more efficiently. [0028]<br>
FIG. 4 is an enlarged plan view of the essential part of the motorcycle 1 shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 4, the same reference numerals as those shown in FIGS. 1 to 3D denote the same or like parts. FIG. 4 shows a condition before inflation of the air bag 50. As shown in FIG- 4, the right and left upper tubes 2R and 2L connected to the head pipe 3 extend rearward so as to be curved convexly in the laterally opposite directions, and the air bag module 20 is located between the upper tubes 2R and 2L in such a manner that the width of the air bag module 20 falls in the space between the upper tubes 2R and 2L. Accordingly, no lateral projection from the air bag module 20 is present, so that the installed position of the air bag module 20 has no influence on the rider seating position, for example. [0029]<br>
FIG. 5A is a perspective view of the frame 2 in the motorcycle 1 shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 5A, the same reference numerals as those shown in FIGS. 1 to 4 denote the same or like parts. The frame 2 has a head member 3a<br><br>
formed with the head pipe 3 through which a stem shaft (not shown) as a pivot shaft for pivotally supporting the front forks 7 is inserted. The right and left upper tubes 2R and 2L are connected to the head member 3a. Two supporting members 30 and 31 for fixing the right supporting stay 21R of the air bag module 20 are welded to the right upper tube 2R, and one supporting member 32 for fixing the left supporting stay 21L of the air bag module 20 is welded to the left upper tube 2L. As shown in FIG. 5B, the supporting member 32 is welded through weld beads 32t and 32u to the left upper tube 2L. This welding structure is applied also to the fixation of the supporting members 30 and 31 to the right upper tube 2R. [0030]<br>
FIG, 6 is a perspective view showing a mounting structure of the air bag module 20 as viewed from the left side of the vehicle. In FIG. 6, the same reference numerals as those shown in FIGS. 1 to 5B denote the same or like parts. The air bag module mounting structure according to this preferred embodiment is characterized in that the air bag module 20 is mounted on the upper tubes 2R and 2L of the frame 2 so as to straddle the space between the upper tubes 2R and 2L. The right and left supporting stays 21R and 21L are welded to the<br><br>
casing 23 of the air bag module 20 at its lower portion. As mentioned above, the plural supporting members 30, 31, and 32 (see FIG, 5A) are welded to the upper tubes 2R and 2L. The right supporting stay 21R is fixed to the supporting members 30 and 31 by given bolts, and the left supporting stay 21L is fixed to the supporting member 32 by a given bolt. A connector 25 is provided on the front surface of the casing 23, so as to input an ignition signal to the inflator accommodated in the casing 23. [0031]<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the air bag module 20 in the motorcycle 1 according to this preferred embodiment is located at a relatively high position with respect to the upper tubes 2R and 2L. In the conventional air bag module mounting structure, there is a possibility that such a location of the air bag module 20 may cause a dead space below the air bag module 20, which dead space cannot be effectively utilized. However, in the air bag module mounting structure according to this preferred embodiment, the above problem can be solved. [0032]<br>
FIG. 7 is a perspective view showing the layout of peripheral components in relation to the air bag module 20 as viewed from the left side of the vehicle. In FIG. 7,<br><br>
the same reference numerals as those shown in FIGS. 1 to 6 denote the same or like parts. In the motorcycle 1, an air cleaner box 44 for cleaning the outside air to be introduced into the engine 15 is located so as to be interposed between the upper tubes 2R and 2L, and an upper cover 41 of the air cleaner box 44 is located above a plane corresponding to the upper surfaces of the upper tubes 2R and 2L. The air bag module mounting structure according to this preferred embodiment is characterized in that the air cleaner box 44 including the upper cover 41 is located below the air bag module 20 and that a substantially flat box-shaped audio unit 40 is installed in the space formed between the upper cover 41 of the air cleaner box 44 and the casing 23 of the air bag module 20 Accordingly, the space below the air bag module 20 as formed as the result of the optimum location of the air bag module 20 can be effectively used as an installation space for other components, so that the volume of the installation space for the air bag module 20 can be reduced. Further, in the condition where such peripheral components are located as shown in FIG, 7, another supporting stay 33 is connected between the casing 23 and the left upper tube 2L by given bolts. Accordingly, the air bag module 20 is fixed to the upper tubes 2R and 2L<br><br>
at totally four points. [0033]<br>
A left air duct 42L extending frontward from a left front portion of the air cleaner box 44 is provided to introduce the outside air into the air cleaner box 44 from its front side. The upper cover 41 of the air cleaner box 44 is fixed to a lower case 43 of the air cleaner box 44 at a plurality of fastening portions 45. A connector 43 for outputting a signal from an intake air temperature sensor provided in the air cleaner box 44 is mounted on the left side surface of the upper cover 41. Further, an FI unit supporting stay 34 for fixing an FI unit 37 as a fuel injection control device to be hereinafter described is mounted on the third supporting stay 33 at its upper portion. The audio unit 40 is floatingly fixed to four mounting holes 55 through resin rings 55a for reducing vibrations transmitted mainly from the engine 15. The mounting holes 55 are formed through the right supporting stay 21R, the third supporting stay 33, and the FI unit supporting stay 34. Further, the rear surface of the casing 23 opposed to the rider is formed with a pair of slits 24 for passing the supporting belts<br>
51. [0034]<br><br>
FIG- 8 is a sectional view of the mounting structure of the air bag module 20 as viewed from the rear side of the vehicle. In FIG- 8, the same reference numerals as those shown in FIGS. 1 to 7 denote the same or like parts. By removing the FI unit supporting stay 34 and the third supporting stay 33, the audio unit 40 can be removed from the left front side of the air bag module 20 as shown by an arrow in FIG. 8. By loosening the mounting screw 48 at each fastening portion 45 to remove the upper cover 41 in the condition where the audio unit 40 has been removed as mentioned above, an air filter 80 accommodated in the air cleaner box 44 can be removed. [0035]<br>
FIG. 9 is a perspective view of the mounting structure of the air bag module 20 as viewed from the right side of the vehicle. An air bag ECU 35 as an air bag control device for controlling the inflating operation of the air bag 50 according to information from various sensors for measuring an impact etc. applied to the vehicle body is fixed to the right supporting stay 21R by two, upper and lower bolts. The FI unit 37 fixed to the FI unit supporting stay 34 and the air bag ECU 35 are arranged so as to be diverged toward the lower side of the vehicle as viewed in the longitudinal direction of<br><br>
the vehicle. Such a location of the FI unit 37 and the air bag ECU 35 contributes to compression of a dead space and promotes a reduction in volume of the installation space for the air bag module 20. Further, a right air duct 42R for introducing the outside air into the air cleaner box 44 extends frontward from a right front portion of the air cleaner box 44. The right air duct 42R is fixed to the right supporting stay 21R. [0036]<br>
FIG. 10 is a perspective view similar to FIG. 9, showing a condition where the FI unit 37, the air bag ECU 35, the audio unit 40, and the air cleaner box 44 are removed for illustration. It is preferable to avoid the displacement and removal of the air bag module 20 even in performing the maintenance of peripheral components. In the air bag module mounting structure according to this preferred embodiment, the air bag module 20 is fixed through the supporting stays 21 to the frame 2 at four points, and one of these four fixing points is provided by a detachable fastening structure. Accordingly, the audio unit 40 and the upper cover 41 of the air cleaner box 44 can be removed from a position corresponding to this detachable fastening structure without the need for displacement or removal of the air bag module 20.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
A process of removing the peripheral components around the air bag module 20 will now be described in more detail with reference to FIGS. 7 and 8. First, the FI unit 37 (see FIG. 9) is removed from the FI unit supporting stay 34. Thereafter, the FI unit supporting stay 34 and the third supporting stay 33 spot-welded thereto are removed from the left upper tube 2L and the air bag module 20. In this condition, two of the four rings 55a for supporting the audio unit 40 on the left side thereof are removed, so that the audio unit 40 can be removed so as to be drawn out from the position corresponding to the third supporting stay 33. Thereafter, the left air duct 42L is removed from the air cleaner box 44, and all of the mounting screws 48 (see FIG. 8) at the fastening portions 45 of the air cleaner box 44 are loosened, so that the upper cover 41 of the air cleaner box 44 can be removed so as to be drawn out from the left front side thereof. As a result, the air filter 80 (see FIG. 8) whose frequency of maintenance is relatively high can be easily removed, thus ensuring high maintainability. [0038]<br>
In a normal maintenance operation, it is unnecessary to remove the air bag module 20. Accordingly,<br><br>
in the air bag module mounting structure according to this preferred embodiment, the right supporting stay 21R of the air bag module 20 is fixed to the supporting members 30 and 31 by means of torques bolts 30a and 31a, respectively, as shown in FIG. 10. Similarly, the left supporting stay 21L of the air bag module 20 is fixed to the supporting member 32 by means of a torques bolt 32a as shown in FIG. 6. These torques bolts 30a, 31a, and 32a are bolts that cannot be removed without a special tool. [0039]<br>
According to the present invention, the<br>
installation space for the air bag module can be reduced in volume, and high maintainability can be ensured. Further, various peripheral components are concentratedly arranged around the air bag module, so that the maintenance of these components can be easily performed and wiring cords can be simplified to thereby realize a reduction in number of manufacturing steps. Further, owing to mass concentration, the drivability can also be improved. The peripheral components located below the air bag module are not limited in kind and shape, and the method of fastening the air bag module to the frame is also not limited to that mentioned above, but various modifications may be made within the scope of the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
