				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a molded article which is decorated, and<br>
a production method thereof. The present invention also relates to a<br>
decorative sheet used for decorating such a molded article, and a motor<br>
vehicle provided with such a molded article.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, as a technique for decorating various kinds of molded articles,<br>
a technique for attaching a decorative sheet onto a surface of a molded<br>
article is proposed. The decorative sheet used in this technique is<br>
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.10-249999, for<br>
example.<br>
The decorative sheet disclosed in the above-identified publication<br>
includes a base member and an ink layer formed on a surface of the base<br>
member by printing. The decorative sheet is attached to a molded article<br><br>
with an adhesive. When such a decorative sheet is used, the molded<br>
article can be easily recycled as compared with the case of paint<br>
application using a coating material. In addition, such a decorative sheet<br>
can create beautiful appearance which is different from the paint<br>
application, so that a decorative quality can be improved.<br>
A conventional decorative sheet is, however, suitable for the decoration<br>
of a molded article having a flat surface, but is not suitable for the<br>
decoration of a molded article having an uneven surface. When such a<br>
decorative sheet is attached to a molded article having an uneven<br>
surface, the decorative sheet is spread so as to follow the unevenness.<br>
Therefore, if a pattern of a character, a graphic symbol, a picture, and<br>
the like is represented in part of the decorative sheet, the pattern is<br>
deformed, and the decorative appearance is uglified.<br>
The present invention has been conducted in view of the above-described<br>
problems, and the object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
decorative sheet preferably used for the decoration of a molded article<br>
having an uneven surface, a molded article to which the decorative sheet<br>
is attached, a production method thereof, and a motor vehicle provided<br>
with such a molded article.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention is not<br>
limited to the embodiments described below.<br>
A decorative sheet 10 in this embodiment is schematically shown in<br>
FIGS. 1(a) and (b). The decorative sheet 10 includes, as shown in FIGS.<br><br>
1(a) and (b), a base member 1 having a first principal surface la and a<br>
second principal surface lb which are opposite to each other, and a<br>
decoration layer 2 provided on the first principal surface la of the base<br>
member 1.<br>
The base member 1 is formed from a resin material, and typically formed<br>
from a thermoplastic resin material. The decoration layer 2 is formed<br>
from ink, or the like. The decoration layer 2 includes a pattern area 2a<br>
representing a predetermined pattern. The pattern represented by the<br>
pattern area 2a is concretely a design such as a diagram, a color-coding,<br>
or gradation, and more concretely a character shown in FIG. 2(a), a<br>
graphic symbol shown in FIG. 2(b), or a picture.<br>
FIGS. 1(a) and (b) show a case where the decoration layer 2 having the<br>
pattern area 2a in an entire face thereof is provided on part of the<br>
principal surface la. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 3, the decoration<br>
layer 2 having the pattern area 2a only in part may be provided on the<br>
entire face of the principal surface la. An area 2b other than the pattern<br>
area 2a of the decoration layer 2 is a monotone area without any pattern,<br>
for example.<br>
FIGS. 4(a), (b), and (c) show examples of the use of the decorative sheet<br>
10. The decorative sheet 10 is joined to the surface of a molded article<br>
body 21, so as to decorate the molded article 20, as shown in FIGS. 4(a),<br>
(b), and (c). The decoration layer 2 has a pattern area 2a, so that high<br>
decorating effects can be attained, as compared with a decoration layer<br>
having no pattern area 2a (a monotone decoration layer without any<br>
pattern as a whole, for example). In other words, the pattern area 2a is<br>
an area of which accuracy as decoration is more highly required than the<br>
other area of the decoration layer 2 after the joining to the molded<br>
article body 21.<br>
The molded article body 21 shown in FIG. 4(a) has a protruding portion<br>
21a of a hemispherical shape (a bowl-like shape), and the surface is<br>
uneven. Therefore, when the decorative sheet 10 is to be joined, the<br>
decorative sheet 10 is spread so as to follow the unevenness. In order to<br>
preferably perform the spread of the decorative sheet 10, typically, the<br>
joining is performed after the decorative sheet 10 is heated and softened.<br>
The decorative sheet 10 according to the present invention is provided<br>
with a spread suppressing member 3 for suppressing the spread of the<br>
pattern area 2a, as shown in FIGS. 1(a) and (b), and FIG. 3. The spread<br>
suppressing member 3 is provided in a position corresponding to the<br>
pattern area 2a. The spread suppressing member 3 in this embodiment is<br>
provided so as to overlap the pattern area 2a on the side of the second<br>
principal surface lb of the base member 1 (on the side opposite to the<br>
side on which the decoration layer 2 is provided).<br>
The spread suppressing member 3 is a member with lower spreading<br>
property than that of the base member 1, for example, so that the spread<br>
of the pattern region 2a is suppressed.<br>
Alternatively, the spread suppressing member 3 has a higher coefficient<br>
of thermal conductivity than a coefficient of thermal conductivity of the<br>
base member 1, so that the spread of the pattern area 2a is suppressed.<br>
If the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the spread suppressing<br>
member 3 is higher than the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the<br>
base member 1, a temperature of a portion of the decorative sheet 10 on<br>
which the spread suppressing member 3 is provided lowers more rapidly<br>
than the other portion after the heating. Thus, the spreading property is<br>
lowered as compared with the other portion. Therefore, the spreading of<br>
the pattern area 2a is suppressed.<br>
It is understood that the spread suppressing member 3 preferably has<br>
both of the above-described two physical properties, in order to<br>
effectively suppress the spread of the pattern region 2a.<br>
If the joining as shown in FIGS. 4(a) to (c) is performed by using a<br>
conventional decorative sheet, the pattern such as a character, a graphic<br>
symbol, or a picture is deformed, so that the beautiful appearance of the<br>
molded article is uglified.<br>
On the contrary, the decorative sheet 10 according to the present<br>
invention includes the spread suppressing member 3, so that the spread<br>
of the pattern region 2a in joining to the molded article body 21 can be<br>
suppressed. Therefore, when the decoration of the molded article is<br>
performed by using the decorative sheet 10 according to the present<br>
invention, the deformation of the pattern can be prevented, and beautiful<br>
appearance can be attained. The spread suppressing member 3 is<br>
provided so as to overlap only part of the principal surface lb of the<br>
base member 1 in accordance with the pattern area 2a (that is, provided<br>
partially with respect to the principal surface of the base member 1), so<br>
that the following property of the decorative sheet 10 for the unevenness<br>
of the surface of the molded article body 21 is hardly degraded.<br>
Hereinafter, preferable materials, structures, and layouts of the spread<br>
suppressing member 3, the decoration layer 2, and the base member 1<br>
will be described.<br>
As a material for the spread suppressing member 3, metal such as<br>
aluminum, copper, stainless can be preferably used. As the spread<br>
suppressing member 3, a foil, a film, a thin plate, or the like formed of<br>
any one of the above-mentioned metals may be preferably used.<br>
Generally, a coefficient of thermal conductivity of metal is higher than a<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity of a resin by two or three digits. For<br>
this reason, if metal is used as the material for the spread suppressing<br>
member 3, the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the spread<br>
suppressing member 3 can be sufficiently higher than the coefficient of<br>
thermal conductivity of the base member 1 formed from a resin material.<br>
Therefore, it is easy to rapidly lower the temperature of the portion of<br>
the decorative sheet 10 in which the spread suppressing member 3 is<br>
provided. Thus, it is possible to effectively suppress the spread of the<br>
pattern area 2a.<br>
The spread suppressing member 3 is not limited to that formed of metal.<br>
Since metal or a metal compound has a much higher coefficient of<br>
thermal conductivity than that of a resin, the coefficient of thermal<br>
conductivity of the spread suppressing member 3 can be higher than the<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity of the base member 1 by using a<br>
material including metal or a metal compound. As a material including<br>
metal or a metal compound, for example, a material in which filler<br>
(inorganic filler) formed from metal or a metal compound is dispersedly<br>
mixed in a resin matrix is listed. As a metal compound which<br>
constitutes filler, for example, a metal oxide such as alumina can be<br>
used.<br>
In order to rapidly lower the temperature of the portion of the decorative<br>
sheet 10 in which the spread suppressing member 3 is provided, and to<br>
effectively suppress the spread of the pattern region 2a, the coefficient<br>
of thermal conductivity of the spread suppressing member 3 is preferably<br>
equal to or 50 times, and more preferably equal to or 100 times as<br>
compared with the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the base<br>
member 1. Specifically, the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the<br>
spread suppressing member 3 is preferably 10 W/m • K or more, more<br>
preferably 15 W/m• K or more, and much more preferably 20 W/m • K.<br>
The coefficient of thermal conductivity of a resin material is about 0.2<br>
(the coefficient of thermal conductivity of polycarbonate is 0.19 W/m •<br>
K, and the coefficient of thermal conductivity of acryl resin is 0.2 W/m<br>
• K, for example). On the contrary, the coefficient of thermal<br>
conductivity of alumina is 21 W/m • K, and the coefficient of thermal<br>
conductivity of aluminum is 236 W/m • K.<br>
Alternatively, as the material for the spread suppressing member 3, a<br>
resin material can be used. If a resin material having a higher deflection<br>
temperature under load (a heat deflection temperature) than that of a<br>
resin material which forms the base member 1, or a resin material having<br>
higher rigidity than that of a resin material which forms the base member<br>
1, is used, the spreading property of the spread suppressing member 3<br>
can be lower than that of the base member 1, so that the spread of the<br>
pattern region 2a can be suppressed.<br>
A thickness of the spread suppressing member 3 is preferably 5 µm or<br>
more and 100 µm or less. If the thickness is lower than 5 µm, the<br>
strength is failed, and deformation or breakage may occur. If the<br>
thickness exceeds 100 µ m, in the case where metal is used as the<br>
material, the following property of the spread suppressing member 3<br>
with respect to the unevenness (convex and concave) of the molded<br><br>
article body 21 is sometimes insufficient. Thus, there is a fear that the<br>
spread suppressing member 3 may be peeled off in joining.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the spread suppressing member 3 preferably has a<br>
portion which overlaps the pattern area 2a (an overlap portion) 3a.<br>
When the spread suppressing member 3 has such an overlap portion 3a,<br>
the effect for suppressing the spread can be directly attained for the<br>
pattern area 2a. Thus, the spreading of the pattern area 2a can be<br>
effectively suppressed.<br>
As shown in the figure, when the spread suppressing member 3 also has<br>
a portion 3b which is positioned in an outer circumference of the overlap<br>
portion 3a (an outer circumference portion), the spreading of the pattern<br>
area 2a can be more surely suppressed. From the point of view that the<br>
spreading of the pattern area 2a is effectively suppressed, and the<br>
spreading of the portion other than the pattern area 2a is not prevented,<br>
the width of the outer circumference portion 3b of the spread<br>
suppressing member 3 is preferably 1 mm or more and 10 mm or less,<br>
and more preferably 2 mm or more and 8 mm or less.<br>
Even if the spread suppressing member 3 does not include a portion<br>
overlapping the pattern area 2a, but has a frame-like shape fringing the<br>
pattern area 2a, the spreading of the pattern area 2a can be suppressed.<br>
However, as shown in FIG. 5, the case where the spread suppressing<br>
member 3 has the portion 3a overlapping the pattern area 2a can attain<br>
higher effect for suppressing the spreading of the pattern area 2a.<br>
As a material of the decoration layer 2, ink including a resin material as<br><br>
a binder and pigment dispersed in the resin material can be used, for<br>
example. The decoration layer 2 can be formed by printing with such<br>
ink. The material of the decoration layer 2 is preferably superior in heat<br>
resistance and flexibility. The ink disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Publication No.2002-275405 has superior heat resistance and<br>
flexibility, so that the ink can be preferably used as the material for the<br>
decoration layer 2.<br>
As a resin material which forms the base member 1, a thermoplastic<br>
resin material can be suitably used, as described above. More<br>
specifically, polycarbonate (PC), acrylic resin, polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET), urethane resin, or the like can be preferably used.<br>
However, since the base member 1 is required to have rigidity as a sheet<br>
base member, it is preferred that a resin material be selected in<br>
consideration of this point. Although a thermosetting resin material can<br>
be used as the resin material which forms the base member 1, it is<br>
preferred that a thermoplastic resin material be used in view of the<br>
formability of the decorative sheet 10.<br>
A thickness of the base member 1 is preferably 100 µm or more and<br>
1000 µ m or less. If the thickness of the base member 1 is less than 100<br>
µ m, it is difficult to handle the base member as a sheet, or there may<br>
occur a disadvantageous case where the strength is not sufficient and<br>
breakage occurs in joining. If the thickness of the base member 1<br>
exceeds 1000 µ m, the following property with respect to the surface of<br>
the molded article body 21 may be deteriorated.<br>
The joining of the decorative sheet 10 may be performed, as shown in<br>
FIG. 6(a), in such a manner that the first principal surface 1a on which<br>
the decoration layer 2 is provided faces the molded article body 21, or<br>
alternatively as shown in FIG. 6(b), in such a manner that the second<br>
principal surface 1b on the opposite side to the first principal surface la<br>
faces the molded article body 21.<br>
The spread suppressing member 3 may be provided, as shown in FIGS.<br>
6(a) and (b), on the side of the second principal surface lb of the base<br>
member 1 (the side on which the decoration layer 2 is not provided), or<br>
alternatively provided, as shown in FIGS. 7(a) and (b), on the side of the<br>
first principal surface la of the base member 1 (the side on which the<br>
decoration layer 2 is provided). In the case where the spread<br>
suppressing member 3 is provided on the side of the first principal<br>
surface la, after the decoration layer 2 is formed on the spread<br>
suppressing member 3 by printing or other means, the accumulated body<br>
may be provided on the first principal surface la of the base member 1.<br>
Alternatively, the spread suppressing member 3 may be provided on both<br>
sides of the first principal surface la and the second principal surface lb<br>
of the base member 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6(a) and FIG. 7(a), when the joining is performed in<br>
such a manner that the first principal surface la on which the decoration<br>
layer 2 is provided faces the molded article body 21, the decoration layer<br>
2 is positioned between the base member 1 and the molded article body<br>
21 in the completed molded article, so that the decoration layer 2 can be<br>
advantageously protected by the base member 1.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 6(b) and FIG. 7(b), when the<br>
joining is performed in such a manner that the second principal surface<br>
1b faces the molded article body 21, the decoration layer 2 is positioned<br>
on the outer side than the base member 1. Therefore, there is an<br>
advantage that in addition to a transparent resin material or a translucent<br>
resin material, an opaque resin material can be preferably used as the<br>
resin material for forming the base member 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6(a) and FIG. 7(b), when the joining is performed in<br>
such a manner that the spread suppressing member 3 is positioned on the<br>
side opposite to the molded article body 21 with respect to the base<br>
member 1, it is possible to remove the spread suppressing member 3<br>
after the joining. It is possible to prevent the beautiful appearance from<br>
being deteriorated because the spread suppressing member 3 remains in<br>
the completed molded article. In addition, it is possible to neglect the<br>
contribution of the spread suppressing member 3 to decoration in the<br>
completed molded article, so that the material for the spread suppressing<br>
member 3 can be more freely selected (it is unnecessary to use a<br>
transparent or translucent material, for example). Thus, it is possible to<br>
preferably use various materials such as metal.<br>
Especially when the spread suppressing member 3 is provided on the<br>
side of the second principal surface 1b of the base member 1 (on the side<br>
opposite to the side on which the decoration layer 2 is provided), and the<br>
joining is performed in such a manner that the first principal surface la<br>
on which the decoration layer 2 is provided faces the molded article<br>
body 21, as shown in FIG. 6(a), both of the advantages that the<br>
decoration layer 2 can be protected by the base member 1 and that it is<br>
possible to remove the spread suppressing member 3. Thus, large merits<br>
in practical use can be attained.<br>
For the fixing of the spread suppressing member 3 and the decorative<br>
sheet 10, an adhesive is used, for example. As an adhesive, a<br>
thermoplastic resin (thermoplastic polyurethane resin or thermoplastic<br>
acrylic resin) can be used, or a thermosetting resin (an epoxy resin, for<br>
example) can be used. When the decorative sheet 10 is heated before the<br>
joining, the adhesive preferably has high heat resistance. In the case<br>
where the spread suppressing member 3 is removed after the joining, it is<br>
preferred that the adhesive used for joining the spread suppressing<br>
member 3 be easily peeled off. As an adhesive which has high heat<br>
resistance and which can be easily peeled off, an adhesive of silicone<br>
type is listed specifically.<br>
Next, a production method of a molded article using the decorative sheet<br>
10 and a production apparatus used in the production method will be<br>
described.<br>
First, a production apparatus 100 for the molded article is described with<br>
reference to FIG. 8. The production apparatus 100 includes, as shown in<br>
FIG. 8, a holding device (a holding frame) 30 for holding the decorative<br>
sheet 10, a supporting device (a supporting table) 31 for supporting the<br>
molded article body 21, a pressurizing box 32 positioned above the<br>
holding device 30 and the supporting device 31, a sealing cylinder 33 for<br>
moving up and down the pressurizing box 32, a pressurizing rubber hose<br>
34 for introducing a gas into a space below the pressurizing box 32, a<br>
heater (a far infrared heater, for example) 35 for heating the decorative<br>
sheet 10, and a vacuum vessel 36 for accommodating them.<br>
The vacuum vessel 36 includes a first vessel 36a for accommodating the<br>
holding device 30, the supporting device 31, the box 32, the cylinder 33,<br>
and the rubber hose 34, and a second vessel 36b for accommodating the<br>
heater 35. The heater 35 may be introduced into the first vessel 36a via<br>
a door 37, if required.<br>
The supporting device 31 has a plurality of openings 31a. With a<br>
vacuum pump which is externally provided, the atmospheric air is<br>
sucked through the openings 31a, thereby realizing a reduced pressure<br>
(evacuation) of the space spreading over the supporting device 31. The<br>
rubber hose 34 is connected to the outside. By introducing a gas through<br>
the rubber hose 34, the space spreading below the box 32 can be<br>
pressurized.<br>
Next, with reference to FIGS. 9 to 15, a production method of a molded<br>
article utilizing the decorative sheet 10 will be described. FIGS. 9 to 14<br>
are process sectional views schematically showing the production<br>
method of the molded article. FIG. 15 is a time chart showing an<br>
example of periods of time required for respective steps.<br>
First, the decorative sheet 10 such as shown in FIG. 1 is prepared. The<br>
decorative sheet 10 can be prepared from the above-described materials<br>
by known techniques. For example, the decorative sheet 10 can be<br>
prepared in such a manner that a decoration layer 2 is formed by printing<br>
with ink on a first principal surface 1a of a base member 1, and a spread<br>
suppressing member 3 is fixed with an adhesive on the side of a second<br>
principal surface 1b of the base member 1.<br>
In a separate step from the step of preparing the decorative sheet 10, a<br>
molded article body 21 is prepared. The molded article body 21 may be<br>
formed from a resin material, or may be formed from a metal material.<br>
Alternatively, the molded article body 21 may be formed from the other<br>
materials (formed of wood, for example). The molded article body 21<br>
may be transparent, opaque, or translucent. The molded article body 21<br>
can be prepared by a known technique. In the case where a resin<br>
material is used, the molded article body 21 can be prepared by injection<br>
molding, for example. As the resin material, both of a thermoplastic<br>
resin and a thermosetting resin can be used. Specifically, an unsaturated<br>
polyester resin, an epoxy resin, a vinyl ester resin, a polyurethane resin,<br>
and the like can be used.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 9, the molded article body 21 is placed on the<br>
supporting device 31, and the decorative sheet 10 is fixed to the holding<br>
device 30 so that the decorative sheet 10 is positioned above the molded<br>
article body 21. At this time, an adhesive is applied to a surface of the<br>
decorative sheet 10 on the side of the molded article body 21. In this<br>
embodiment, thereafter, the air in the vacuum vessel 35 is sucked<br>
through the openings 31a of the supporting device 31 by means of the<br>
vacuum pump which is externally provided. Thus, the pressure in the<br>
inside of the vacuum vessel 35 is preliminarily reduced. As the result of<br>
the pressure reduction, the internal pressure of the vacuum vessel 35 is<br>
2.7 kPa or less, for example.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 10, the decorative sheet 10 is heated by means of<br>
the heater 35, thereby softening the decorative sheet 10. At this time,<br>
the decorative sheet 10 is typically heated up to temperatures equal to or<br>
higher than a deflection temperature under load of the resin material<br>
which forms the base member 1. If the heating temperature is too low, it<br>
is difficult to deform the resin material. Therefore, the resin material<br>
may be broken in shaping (in attaching), or the shaping itself cannot be<br>
performed. If the heating temperature is too high, sags of sheet in<br>
heating remarkably occur, so that it is difficult to perform the shaping,<br>
or the appearance may be degraded because of air bubbles in the resin<br>
material. Therefore, it is preferred that the heating temperature be<br>
appropriately set in accordance with the kind of the resin material of the<br>
base member 1. When polycarbonate is used as the resin material for<br>
forming the base member 1, the decorative sheet 10 is heated up to about<br>
195°C, for example. The movement of the heater 35 from the second<br>
vessel 36b to the first vessel 36a is performed in about 3 to 5 seconds,<br>
for example. The heating by the heater 35 is performed for about 15 to<br>
30 seconds, for example.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 11, the pressurizing box 32 and the holding<br>
device 30 are moved downwardly by the cylinder 33, so that the<br>
decorative sheet 10 comes closer to the molded article body 21. The<br>
downward movement is performed in about 1 to 2 seconds, for example.<br>
In this embodiment, the decorative sheet 10 is moved downwardly.<br>
Alternatively, the supporting device 31 for supporting the molded article<br>
body 21 may be moved upwardly, so that the decorative sheet 10 comes<br>
closer to the molded article body 21.<br>
Next, as shown in FIG. 12, a pressure of a first space formed between<br>
the decorative sheet 10 and the molded article body 21 is more reduced<br>
than a pressure of a second space expanded on the opposite side to the<br>
first space with respect to the decorative sheet 10 (that is, a space<br>
formed between the decorative sheet 10 and the pressurizing box 32).<br>
As a result, the decorative sheet 10 is joined to the molded article body<br>
21, as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
Specifically, together with the reduction of pressure in the first space by<br>
means of the vacuum pump, a gas is introduced into the box 32 through<br>
the rubber hose 34, so as to pressurize the second space. As a result, the<br>
decorative sheet 10 is pressed against the molded article body 21 with a<br>
substantially uniform pressure, thereby joining the decorative sheet 10 to<br>
the molded article body 21. The pressure reduction in the first space is<br>
performed, so that the internal pressure of the first space is 2.7 kPa or<br>
less, for example. The pressurizing of the second space is performed, so<br>
that the internal pressure of the second space is about 0.2 MPa to 0.5<br>
MPa. The reduced pressure condition of the first space and the<br>
pressurized condition of the second space are retained for a<br>
predetermined period of time (for 15 seconds or more, for example). A<br>
temperature of the gas (the air, for example) introduced into the second<br>
space is about a room temperature (15°C to 30°C), for example.<br>
Next, the vacuum vessel 35 is opened, so that the internal pressure of the<br>
vacuum vessel 35 is returned to be the atmospheric pressure.<br>
Unnecessary portions of the decorative sheet 10 are cut (trimmed) with<br>
cutting means such as a rotary blade. Thereafter, the molded article<br>
body 21 is released from the supporting device 30, thereby completing a<br>
molded article 20, as shown in FIG. 14.<br>
According to the above-described production method, it is possible to<br>
perform the joining of the decorative sheet 10 to the molded article body<br>
21 (that is, the figuration of the decorative sheet 10) in a very short<br>
period of time (in 1 second or less, as exemplarily described). In<br>
addition, in joining, the decorative sheet 10 is entirely spread, but the<br>
spreading of the pattern portion 2a of the decoration layer 2 is<br>
suppressed by means of the spread suppressing member 3. Therefore,<br>
the distortion of pattern is prevented, and the beauty in appearance is not<br>
deteriorated.<br>
When the spreading property of the spread suppressing member 3 is<br>
poorer than the spreading property of the base member 1, the spreading<br>
of the pattern portion 2a is suppressed for this reason. When the<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity of the spread suppressing member 3<br>
is higher than the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the base member<br>
1, the temperature of the portion of the decorative sheet 10 in which the<br>
spread suppressing member 3 is provided (that is, the portion<br>
corresponding to the pattern area 2a) more rapidly lowers than the<br>
temperature of the other portion of the decorative sheet 10. Therefore,<br>
the joining of the decorative sheet 10 is performed in a condition where<br>
the temperature of the portion of the decorative sheet 10 corresponding<br>
to the pattern area 2a is lower than the temperature of the other portion<br>
of the decorative sheet 10. Therefore, the spreading of the pattern<br>
portion 2a is suppressed.<br>
When the heating by the heater 35 is stopped, the decorative sheet 10 is<br>
naturally cooled (allowed to cool). As a result, the above-described non-<br>
uniform temperature distribution of the decorative sheet 10 can be<br>
realized. Alternatively, more positive cooling may be performed. When<br>
the gas is introduced into the second space in joining, as in this<br>
embodiment, the introduced gas can not only pressurize the second<br>
space, but also cool the surface of the decorative sheet 10 on the side of<br>
the second space. Therefore, when the spread suppressing member 3<br>
faces the second space, the spread suppressing member 3 is cooled by<br>
the gas, so that the above-described non-uniform temperature<br>
distribution can be rapidly realized. Therefore, even in the case where<br>
the joining is performed in a very short time as described above, the<br>
spreading of the pattern area 2a can be more surely suppressed.<br>
In the case where the joining is performed so that the spread suppressing<br>
member 3 faces the second space, the spread suppressing member 3 may<br>
be removed from the molded article 20 if necessary. If the fixing of the<br>
spread suppressing member 3 is performed by means of an adhesive<br>
which can be easily peeled off, the removal can be preferably performed.<br>
It is not necessarily that the spread suppressing member 3 is directly in<br>
contact with the first principal surface la or the second principal<br>
surface lb of the base member 1. The adhesive layer typically exists<br>
between the base member 1 and the spread suppressing member 3, and<br>
additionally, another layer may be interposed. FIG. 16 is a partially<br>
enlarged view of an example of the sectional structure after the joining.<br>
In the structure exemplarily shown in FIG. 16, on the second principal<br>
surface lb of the base member 1 formed from polycarbonate, a<br>
protecting layer 8 of an acrylic resin is formed. On the protecting layer<br>
8, the spread suppressing member 3 formed of aluminum is provided<br>
with the adhesive layer 9 interposed therebetween. The protecting layer<br>
8 is positioned on the outer side than the base member 1 in the molded<br>
article 20, so that the protecting layer 8 protects the base member 1 and<br>
improves the weather resistance of the decorative sheet 10. The base<br>
member 1 has a thickness of 200 µ m to 1000 µ m, for example. The<br>
protecting layer 8 has a thickness of 5 µ m to 50 µm, for example. The<br>
spread suppressing member 3 has a thickness of 5 µ m to 100 µ mm, for<br>
example. The adhesive layer 9 has a thickness of 5 µ m to 50 µm, for<br>
example.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, on the first principal surface 1a of the base<br>
member 1, the decoration layer 2 formed of ink is provided. On the<br>
decoration layer 2, a metal layer 6 formed from tin is provided with the<br>
adhesive layer 7 interposed therebetween. Since the metal layer 6 has<br>
metallic luster, the decorative sheet 10 can exhibit colors of metallic<br>
tones (metallic color) having metallic appearance. Herein, the metal<br>
layer 6 is formed in such a manner that tin is evaporated on a carrier<br>
film 5, and the layered body is attached to the first principal surface la<br>
with an adhesive. The decoration layer 2 has a thickness of 5 µm to 50<br>
µm, for example. The metal layer 6 has a thickness of 0.25 µ m to 0.8<br>
µm, for example, and is formed from soft metal such as tin.<br>
The decorative sheet 10 shown in FIG. 16 is joined to the molded article<br>
body 21 by means of the adhesive layer 4. The adhesive layer 4 has a<br>
thickness of 5 µ m to 50 µm, for example. As described above, the<br>
spread suppressing member 3 may be provided on the side of the first<br><br>
principal surface la of the base member 1. More specifically, as shown<br>
by a dot line in FIG. 16, on the first principal surface la of the base<br>
member 1, the spread suppressing member 3 may be provided with the<br>
decoration layer 2, the adhesive layer 7, the metal layer 6, and the<br>
carrier film 5 interposed therebetween.<br>
In order to maintain the decorating effect of the pattern area 2a of the<br>
decoration layer 2 high, as shown in FIG. 17, the thickness T1 of the<br>
portion of the sheet 10 corresponding to the pattern area 2a is preferably<br>
1.1 times or more and 1.8 times or less as large as the thickness T2 of the<br>
other portion of the sheet 10. More preferably, the thickness T1 is 1.2<br>
times or more and 1.6 time or less as large as the thickness T2. When<br>
the pattern area 2a is such thin that the thickness T1 is less than 1.1<br>
times as large as the thickness T2, stepped cut may occur in the pattern<br>
area 2a due to the unevenness of the surface of the molded article body<br>
21, and desired decorating effects cannot be attained. When the<br>
thickness T1 is more than 1.8 times as large as the thickness T2, the<br>
appearance of the pattern area 2a may be distorted due to the lens effect,<br>
or the portion corresponding to the pattern area 2a (the portion is raised<br>
as compared with the other portion) may get scratched by friction.<br>
In this embodiment, the molded article body 21 which is integrally<br>
formed (in other words, which has a single member) is shown.<br>
Alternatively, a molded article may have a plurality of members which<br>
are separately molded, and the plurality of members may be mutually<br>
coupled by the joining of the decorative sheet 10.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIG. 18(a), on a surface of a molded article<br>
body 22 having a first member 22a and a second member 22b disposed<br>
on a surface of the first member 22a, the decorative sheet 10 is joined so<br>
as to cover both of the first member 22a and the second member 22b. As<br>
a result, as shown in FIG. 18(b), a molded article 20' in which the first<br>
member 22a and the second member 22b are coupled can be obtained.<br>
A relative positional relationship between the first member 22a and the<br>
second member 22b can be arbitrarily selected. For this reason, when<br>
the plurality of members 22a and 22b of the molded article body 22 are<br>
coupled by means of the joining of the decorative sheet 10, as described<br>
above, a large variety of shapes of molded articles can be obtained by<br>
using a relatively small number of molding dies. Therefore, the<br>
production of the large variety of shapes of molded articles can be easily<br>
performed at a low cost. For the first member 22a and the second<br>
member 22b, a structure for temporarily tacking them, that is, a<br>
positioning structure for determining the relative positional relationship<br>
can be provided. The positioning structure may be a protruding portion<br>
and a concave portion which are mutually engaged, for example.<br>
The molded article produced by the production method using the<br>
decorative sheet 10 is suitably used for interior or exterior of motor<br>
vehicles, exterior of home electric appliances, and the like. For<br>
example, the molded article is suitably used as a tank cover 51, a front<br>
fender 52, and a tail cowl 53 of a motorbike 50 shown in FIG. 19. As we<br>
all known, the "motor vehicles" widely indicate loco mobile<br>
conveyances or machines for transporting passengers or merchandises, or<br>
for moving things, and include a car, a motorbike, a bus, a truck, a<br>
tractor, an airplane, a motorboat, a civil engineering vehicle, and the<br>
like. The motor vehicles include not only those provided with an<br>
internal combustion engine such as a gasoline engine, but also those<br>
provided with an electric motor.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the decorative sheet of the present invention, since the<br>
spread suppressing member for suppressing the spreading of the pattern<br>
area is provided in a position corresponding to the pattern area of the<br>
