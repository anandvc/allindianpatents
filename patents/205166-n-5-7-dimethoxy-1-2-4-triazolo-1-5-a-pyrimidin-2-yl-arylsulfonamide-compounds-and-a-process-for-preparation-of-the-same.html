"N-(5,7-DIMETHOXY[l,2,4jTRIA.;OU)jl;5-a]PYRIMIDIN-2-YL) ARYLSULFONAMIDE COMPOUNDS AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF THE SAME"<br>
DOW  AGROSCIENCES   LLC,        US   company  of 9330   Zionsville   Road, Indianapolis, Indiana 46268, United States of America,<br><br><br><br>
The  following  specification   particularly describes  the  invention  and  the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to substituted benzenesulfonand.de and pyridinesulfonamide compounds, to herbicidal compositions containing the compounds, and to the utility of the compounds for the control of unwanted vegetation.<br>
The control of unwanted vegetation by means of chemical agents, i.e., herbicides, is an important aspect of modern agriculture and land management. while many chemicals that are useful for the control of unwanted vegetation are known, new compounds that are more effective generally, are more effective for specific plant species, are less damaging to desirable vegetation, are safer to man or the environment, are less expensive to use, or have other advantageous attributes are desirable.<br>
Many substituted benzenesulfonamide compounds are known and certain of them are known to possess herbicidal activity.  For example, certain N-([1,2,4]-triazolo [1,5 -a] pyrimidin-2 -yl) benzenesulfonamide compounds and their herbicidal utility were disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,638,075 and certain N-( [1,2, 4]-triazolo [1,3, 5] triazin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide compounds were disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,685,958.  In addition, certain N-( [1,2, 4] triazolo [1,5-c]pyrimidin-2-yl) benzenesulfonamide, N-( [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]-pyrimidin-2-yl)pyridinesulfonamide, N-[ [1,2,4] tri-<br><br>
azolo[l,5-a]pyridin-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide, and N-([1,2, 4] triazolo[l, 5-a]pyridin-2-yl)pyridinesulfon-amide compounds were disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,858,924.  Certain ^-phenyl arylsulfonamide compounds are also known and are known to possess herbicidal activity.  For example, certain 2\7-(substituted phenyl) [1, 2, 4] triazolofl, 5-cjpyrimi din-2-sulfonamide compounds were disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,163,995 and certain N-{substituted phenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]-pyridin-2-sulfonamide compounds were disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,571,775.<br>
It has now been found that a class of novel N-(5,7-dimethoxy[i, 2, 4] triazolo[l, 5-a]pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide compounds are potent herbicides for the control of unwanted vegetation by either pre-emergence or postemergehce application.

with a arylsulfonyl chloride compound of Formula III:<br>
The compounds of Formula I wherein T represents hydrogen can be prepared by the reaction of 2-amino-5,7-dimethoxy[l,2;4]triazolopyrimidine of Formula II:<br><br><br>
wherein A, B, D and Q are as defined for compounds of Formula I.. The reaction can be carried out by combining approximately equal molar amounts of the two compounds in a polar, aprotic solvent, such as acetonitrile, and adding pyridine.and a catalytic amount (5 to 25 molar percent of the sulfonyl chloride compound) of dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature. Additional sulfonyl chloride compound, pyridine, and dimethyl sulfoxide are added, if necessary, to complete the reaction. The reactions take from a few hours to several days to go to completion. Means to<br><br>
exclude moisture, such as a dry nitrogen blanket, are employed. The compounds of Formula I obtained, which are solids with low solubility in many common organic solvents and in water, can be recovered using conventional means.<br>
iV-(5, 7-dimethoxy[l,2,4] triazolofl, 5-a]pyrimidin-2-yl]arylsulfonamide compounds of Formula I wherein T represents other than hydrogen can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of Formula I wherein T represents hydrogen by acylation under reaction conditions known in the art for related sulfonamide acylation reactions.  Suitable acylating agents include alkanoyl chloride compounds, such as propionyl chloride or trifluoroacetyl chloride; chloroformate ester compounds, such as 2-methoxyethyl chloroformate; carbamoyl chloride compounds, such as N',N'-diallyl-carbamoyl chloride, and alkyl isocyanate compounds,' such as 2-chloroethyl isocyanate.<br><br>
The 2-amino-5,7-dimetho'xy[1,2,4] triazolo-pyrimidine of Formula II can be prepared by the reaction of N- (4, 6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl) -N --carboethoxythiourea of the formula<br><br><br>
with hydroxylamine. The reaction is typically carried out in a solvent such as ethanol and requires heating for a few hours. The hydroxylamine is typically generated by neutralization of the hydrochloride with a hindered tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethyl-amine, or an alkali metal alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide.  The desired compound of Formula II can be recovered by conventional means, such as by removal of the volatile components of the reaction mixture by evaporation, and can be purified by conventional means, such as by extraction with water and/or other solvents in which they are sparingly soluble.  The N-(4, 6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl) -N*-carboethoxythiourea starting material for this method can be obtained by treatment of 2-amino-4, 6-dimethoxypyrimidine with ethoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate. The reaction is generally carried out in an inert organic solvent at ambient temperatures. The overall method is further described in U.S. Patent 5,571,775.<br>
The 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine starting material for the method described above is known in<br>
the art.<br>
The substituted benzenesulfonyl chloride and pyridinesulfonyl chloride starting materials of Formula III can be prepared by the methods disclosed herein or by general or specific methods known in the art. Many such compounds, such as 2-methoxy-6-(tri-fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonyl chloride and 2-methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-3-pyridinesulfonyl chloride, can be<br><br><br>
prepared by lithiation of the corresponding benzene or pyridine compound, e.g., 3-(trifluoromethyl)anisole or 2-methoxy-4- (trif luoromethyl)pyridine, with butyl lithium, reaction of the phenyl or pyridinyl lithium compound obtained with dipropyl disulfide, and then chloroxidation of the resulting propylthio compound. In each of these reaction steps, conditions generally known for such processes were used. Many propyl or benzylthiobenzenes and pyridines can also be prepared by alkyla'tion of the corresponding thiophenol or 3-pyridinethiol compound using standard methods and subsequent chloroxidation.  Phenyl and pyridinyl lithium compounds, such as that derived from 1,3-dimethoxybenzene can be converted directly to the corresponding desired sulfonyl chloride compounds by reaction with sulfur dioxide and sulfuryl chloride in the presence of I^N/i^N'-tetraiaethylethylenedliaiaine. Other of the required sulfonyl chloride compounds can be prepared by diazotization of the corresponding aniline or 3-aminopyridine compounds in the presence of sulfur dioxide, copper chlorides, and concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid. Benzenesulfonyl chloride compounds, such as 2-methoxy-5-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride, can be prepared by direct chlorosulfonation of appropriate benzene compounds. 3-Alkylthiopyridine compounds having chloro substituents in the 2- and/or 4-positions can be converted to the corresponding compounds having other halo or alkoxy substituents by conventional nucleophilic displacement processes before chloroxidation to produce other pyridine-3--sulf onyl chloride compounds.  The preparation of many<br><br><br>
of the desired benzenesulfonyl chlorides and pyri-dinesulfonyl chlorides is described in U.S. Patent 5,858,924.<br>
While it is possible to utilize the N-(5,7-dimethoxy[l, 2, 4] triazolo[l, 5-a]pyimidin-2-yl)-arylsulfonamide compounds of Formula I directly as herbicides, it is preferable to use them in mixtures containing an herbicidally effective amount of the compound along with at least one agriculturally acceptable adjuvant or carrier.  Suitable adjuvants or carriers should not be phvtotoxic to valuable crops,. particularly at the concentration^ employed in applying the compositions for selective weed control in the presence of crops, and should not react chemically with the compounds of formula I or other composition ingredients. Such mixtures can be designed for application directly to weeds or their' locus or can be concentrates or formulations that are fiormally diluted with additional carriers and adjuvants before application. They can be solids, 5uch as, for example, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, or wettable powders, or liquids, ■such as, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, solutions, emulsions or suspensions-<br>
Suitable agricultural adjuvants and carriers that are useful in preparing the herbicidal mixtures of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Liquid carriers that can be employed include water, toluene, xylene, petroleum naphtha, crop oil,<br><br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, ethyl acetate, amyl acetate, butyl acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, amyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, and the like. Water is generally the carrier of' choice for the dilution of concentrates.<br>
Suitable solid carriers include talc, pyro-phyllite clay, silica, attapulgus clay, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomacecus earth, lime, calcium carbonate, bentonite clay, Fuller's earth, cotton seed hulls, wheat flour, soybean flour, pumice, wood flour, walnut shell flour, lignin, and the like.<br>
It is frequently desirable to incorporate one or more surface-active agents into the compositions of the present invention.  Such surface-active agents are advantageously employed in both solid and liquid compositions, especially those designed to be diluted with carrier before application. The surface-active agents can be anionic, cationic or nonionic in character and can be employed as emulsifying agents, wetting agents, suspending agents, or for other purposes. Typical surface active agents include salts of alkyl sulfates, such as diethanolammonium lauryl sulfate; alkylarylsulfonate salts, such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate; alkylphenol-alkylene oxide addition products, such as -nonylphenol-Cia ethoxylate; alcohol-alkylene oxide addition products, such as<br><br><br>
tridecyl alcohol-Ci5 ethoxylate; soaps, such as sodium stearate; alkyinaphthalenesulfonate salts, such as sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate,- dialkyl esters of sulfosuccinate salts, such as sodium di (2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate; sorbitol esters, such as sorbitol oleate; quaternary amines, such as lauryl trimethyl-ammqnium chloride; polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids, such as polyethylene glycol stearate; block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide,- and salts of mono and dialkyl phosphate esters.<br>
Other adjuvants commonly utilized in agricultural compositions include compatibilizing agents, antifoam agents, sequestering agents, neutralizing agents and buffers, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, odorants, spreading agents, penetration aids, sticking agents, dispersing agents, thickening agents, freezing point depressants, antimicrobial agents, and the like.  The compositions can also contain other compatible components, for example, other herbicides, herbicide safeners, plant growth regulants, fungicides, insect¬icides, and the like and can be formulated with liquid fertilizers or solid, particulate fertilizer carriers such as ammonium nitrate, urea and the like.<br>
The concentration of the active ingredients in the herbicidal compositions of this invention is generally from 0.001 to 98 percent by weight. Concentrations from 0.01 to 90 percent by weight are often employed.  In compositions designed to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient is generally present in a concentration from 5 to 98<br><br><br>
weight percent, preferably 10 to 90  weight percent. Such compositions are typically diluted with an inert carrier, such as water, before application. The diluted compositions usually applied to weeds or the locus of weeds generally contain 0.001 to 5 weight percent active ingredient and preferably contain 0.01 to 0.5 percent.<br>
The present compositions can be applied to weeds-or their locus by the use of conventional ground or aerial dusters, sprayers, and granule applicators, by addition to irrigation water, and by other conventional means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of Formula I have been found to be useful preemergence (including pre-plant) and post-emergence herbicides.  Postemergence applications are generally preferred. The compounds are effective in the control of both broadleaf and grassy weeds. While each of the N-(5, 7-dimethoxy [1,2, 4] triazolo [1,5-a] - ■ pyrimidin-2-yl)arylsulfonamide compounds encompassed by Formula I is within the scope of the invention, the degree of herbicidal activity, crop selectivity, and spectrum of weed control obtained varies depending upon the substituents and other features present. The compounds can be employed at higher, non-selective rates of application to control essentially all of the vegetation in an area. In some cases, the compounds can also be employed at lower, selective rates of application for the control of undesirable vegetation in grass crops or in broadTeaf crops,  in such<br><br>
instances, the selectivity can often be improved by the use of safeners.<br>
The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient that controls or adversely modifies the growth of plants. An herbicidally effective or vegetation controlling amount is an amount of active ingredient which causes an adversely modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, desiccation, retardation, and the like. The terms plants and vegetation are meant to include germinant seeds, emerging seedlings and established vegetation.<br>
Herbicidal activity is exhibited by the compounds of the present invention when they are applied directly to the plant or to the locus of the plant at any stage of growth or before planting or emergence. The effect observed depends upon the plant species to be controlled, the stage of growth of the plant, the application parameters of dilution and spray drop size, the particle size of solid components, the environmental conditions at the time of use, the specific compound employed, the specific adjuvants and carriers employed, the soil type, and the like, as well as the amount of chemical applied. These and other factors can be adjusted as is known in the art to promote non-selective or selective herbicidal action. Generally, it is preferred to apply the compounds of Formula I postemergence to relatively immature plants to achieve" the maximum control of weeds.<br><br><br>
Application rates of 0.001 to 1 kg/ha are generally employed in postemergence operations; for preemergence applications, rates of 0.01 to 2 kg/ha are generally employed.  The higher rates designated generally give.non-selective control of a broad variety of undesirable vegetation. The lower rates typically give selective control and, by judicious election of compounds, timing, and rates of application, can be employed in the locus of crops.<br>
The compounds of the present invention (Formula I) are often applied in conjunction with one or more other herbicides to obtain control of a wider variety of undesirable vegetation. When used in conjunction with other herbicides, the presently claimed compounds can be formulated with the other herbicide or herbicides, tank mixed with the other herbicide or herbicides, or applied sequentially with the other herbicide or herbicides. Some of the herbicides that can be employed beneficially in combination with the compounds of the present invention include substituted triazolopyrimidinesulfonamide compounds, such as diclosulam, florasulam, cloransulam-methyl, and flumetsulam. Other herbicides such as acifluorfen, bentazon, chlorimuron, clomazone, lactofen, carfentrazone-methyl, fumiclorac, fluometuron, fomesafen, imazaquin, imazethapyr, linuron, metribuzin, fluazifop, haloxyfop, glyphosate, glufosinate, 2,4-D, acetochlor, metolachlor, sethoxy-dim, nicosulfuron, clopyralid, fluroxypyr, metsulfuron-methyl, ami do sulfur on, tribenuron, and<br><br>
others can also be employed.  It is generally preferred to use the compounds in conjunction with other herbicides that have a similar crop selectivity. It is further usually preferred to apply the herbicides at the same time, either as a combination formulation or as a tank mix.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can generally be employed in combination with a wide variety of known herbicide safeners, such as cloquintocet, mefenpyr, furilazole, dichlormid, benoxacor, flurazole, fluxofenim, daimuron, dimepiperate, thiobencarb, and fenclorim, to enhance their selectivity.  Herbicide safeners that act by modifying the metabolism of herbicides in plants by enhancing the activity of cytochrome P-450 oxidases are usually especially effective. This is often a preferred embodiment of the invention. The compounds can additionally be employed to control undesirable vegetation in many crops that have been made tolerant to or resistant to herbicides by genetic manipulation or by mutation and selection. For example, crops that have been made tolerant or resistant to herbicides in general or to herbicides that inhibit the enzyme acetolactate synthase in sensitive plants can be treated.<br>

The other compounds of Table 1 were prepared similarly.<br><br>
4.     Preparation of Herbicidal Compositions<br>
Wettable Powder<br>
Barden clay (55.5 g), HiSil 233 silica (5.0 g), Polyfon H (sodium lignosulfonate; 7.0 g) , Stepaiiol ME-Dry (sodium lauryl sulfate; 7.9 g) , and Compound 1 (20."4 g) were added to a 1 quart glass Waring blender cup and thoroughly mixed at high speed.  The blended mixture was passed (one time) thru a laboratory Trost mill with the opposing jets set between 75 and 80  psi (517-551 kPa) . This produced a wettable powder of excellent wettability and suspension power. By diluting this wettable powder with water it is possible to obtain suspensions of suitable concentrations for controlling weeds.<br>
Aqueous Suspension Concentrate<br>
To prepare an aqueous suspension concentrate, deionized water (106 g) , Kelzan S (xanthan gum; 0.3 g) , Avicel CL-611 (carboxylmethyl cellulose; 0.4 g), and Proxel GXL (1, 2-benzisothiazolin-3-one; 0.2 g) were added to a blender and mixed for 30 min. Then Compound 3 (44 g) , Darvan #1 (naphthalene sulfonate; 2 g), Foamaster UDB (silicone fluid; 0.2 g) , Pluronic P-105 (ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer; 20 g), phosphoric acid (0.02 g) , and propylene glycol (16 g) were added to the same blender and mixed for 5 min. Once blended the contents were milled in an Eiger mill filled with. 1-1.25 mm lead free glass beads<br><br>
(40 mL) at 5000 rpm for 30 min. External cooling on the Eiger mill grinding chamber was maintained at 15°C.<br>
Oil-based Suspension Concentrate<br>
To a 1 quart glass Waring blender cup was added Exxon's crop oil (145.4g), Amsul DMAP 60 (dimethylaminopropane salt of dodecybenzene sulfonic acid; 4.0 g) and Attagel 50 (attapulsite clay; 4.0 g) . The mixture was thoroughly blended at high speed to insure homogeneity.  The Amsul DMAP was difficult to disperse, but eventually formed small homogeneous globules. Agrimul 70-A (ethoxylated bismethylene octylphenol; 4.0 g) and Emulsogen M (oleyl alcohol-ethylene oxide; 16.0 g) were added and thoroughly blended until the mixture was uniform in texture. Cloquintocet mexyl (5.4 g) was then blended into the mixture followed by Compound 15 (21.3 g) . The final grinding stock dispersion milled in the Eiger mill using the conditions described above for the aqueous suspension concentrate.<br>
5. Evaluation of Postemergence Herbicidal Activity Seeds of the desired test plant species were<br>
planted in Grace-Sierra MetroMix® 306 planting mixture, which typically has a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and an organic matter content of about 30 percent, in plastic pots with a surface area of 64 square centimeters. When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied. The plants were grown<br><br>
for. 7-21 days in a greenhouse with an approximately 15 hr photoperiod which was maintained at about 23-29°C " during the day and 22-28°C during the night. Nutrients and water were added on a regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000 Watt lamps as necessary.  The plants were employed for testing when they reached the first or second true leaf stage.<br>
A weighed amount of each test compound, determined by the highest rate to be tested, was placed in a 20 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3 v/v (volume/volume) mixture of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain concentrated stock solutions.  If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated.  The concentrated stock solutions obtained were diluted with an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, iso-propyl alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide, Atplus 411F crop oil concentrate, and Triton X-155 surfactant (methylenebisdiamyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol) in a 48.5:39 :'l0:1.5:1.0: 0.02 v/v ratio to obtain spray solutions of known concentration. The solutions containing the highest concentration to be tested were prepared by diluting 2 mL aliguots of the stock solution with 13 mL of the mixture and lower concentrations were prepared by dilution of appropriate smaller portions of the stock solution. Approximately 1.5 mL aliquots of each solution of known concentration were sprayed evenly onto each of the test plant pots using a DeVilbiss atomizer driven<br><br><br>
by compressed air pressure of 2 to 4 psi (140 to 280 kiloPascals) to obtain thorough coverage of each plant.  Control plants were sprayed in the same manner with the aqueous mixture. In this test an application rate of 1 ppm results in the application of approximately 1 g/ha.<br>
"The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described above and watered by sub-irrigation to prevent wash-off of the test compounds.  After 2 weeks the condition of the test plants as compared with that of the untreated plants was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100 corresponds to complete kill.  Some of the compounds tested, application rates employed, plant species tested, and results are given in Table 2.<br><br><br>

6.' Evaluation of Preemergence Herbicidal Activity<br>
Seeds of the desired test plant species were planted in a soil matrix prepared by mixing a loam soil which was composed of about 43 percent silt, 19 percent clay, and 3 8 percent sand and had a pH of about 8.1 and an organic matter content of about 1.5 percent and sand in a 70 to 30 ratio.  The soil matrix was contained in plastic pots with a surface area of 161-square centimeters. When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied.<br>
A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test compound was placed in a 20 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 8 mL of a 97:3 v/v (volume/volume) mixture of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain concentrated stock solutions.  If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The stock solutions obtained were diluted with a 99.9:0.1<br>
mixture of water and Tween® 155 surfactant (ethoxylated sorbitan fatty acid ester) to obtain application solutions of known concentration. The solutions containing the highest concentration to be tested were prepared by diluting 4 mL aliquots of the stock solution with 8.5 mL of the mixture and lower concentrations were prepared by dilution of appropriate smaller portions of the stock solution. A 2.5 mL aliquot of each solution of known concentration<br><br>
was sprayed evenly onto the soil of each seeded pot using a Cornwall 5.0 mL glass syringe fitted with a TeeJet TN-3 hollow cone nozzle to obtain thorough coverage of the soil in each pot. Control pots were sprayed in the same manner with the aqueous mixture. A highest application rate of 4.48 kg/ha is achieved when 50 mg of test compound is employed-<br>
The treated pots and control pots were placed in a greenhouse with an approximately 15 hr photoperiod which was maintained at 23-29°C during the day and 22-28°C during the night. Nutrients and water were added on a regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000 Watt lamps as necessary.  The water was added by top-irrigation. After 3 weeks the condition of the test plants that germinated and grew as compared with that of the untreated plants that germinated and grew was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100 corresponds to complete kill or no  germination.
