WIRE-COATING COMPOSITION BASED ON NEW POLYESTER AMIDE IMIDES AND POLYESTER AMIDES<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60/706,460, filed August 8,2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new wire-coating composition based on new polyester amide imides and polyester amides which provides excellent enamelled surfaces of electrically conductive wires at elevated enamelling speeds, and is useful for coating of electric conductors.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The wire-coating agents conventionally used nowadays are solutions of enamelled wire binders, such as, THEIC [tris(hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate] polyesters, polyesters, polyamides, polyamide-imides, THEIC polyester imides, polyester imides or polyurethanes in suitable organic solvents such as, cresol, phenol, benzyl alcohol, propylene carbonate or N-methylpyrrolidone, as well as diluents, such as, xylene, other substituted aromatic substances, aliphatic substances and small additions of additives, catalysts and regulators. The solvents are evaporated during thermal curing of the wire coating agents. In order to obtain a high-quality coating, it is necessary to drive out the solvents as completely as possible. In addition to the solvents, byÂ¬products of the curing reactions pass from the enamelling phase into the gas phase as occurs during crosslinking by condensation reactions.<br>
After the wire coating has passed briefly through the enamelling installation, the user of the wire coating endeavours to increase the output<br>
f enamelled electrically conductive wire as much as possible and to obtain the best possible process for the user. Even at elevated enamelling speeds, not only the solvent but also cleavage products of the crosslinking reaction have to be removed as completely as possible from the enamel in order to achieve adequate crosslinking. The oven temperature or catalysis of the crosslinking reaction or both parameters therefore have to be increased to allow substantial crosslinking despite the relatively short residence time of the wire in the oven. The faster crosslinking leads to a rapid increase in viscosity, so the dissipation of solvent and condensation products also has to take place in a much shorter period of time. The process window therefore, becomes much smaller and the stability of the wire enamelling process is significantly restricted. The occurrence of specific enamel defects, such as, bubbles or craters is thus almost inevitable.<br>
Various methods of increasing the speeds at which the wire enamels are applied to electrical conductors have been adopted in the past as shown in the following patents:<br>
EP-A 873198 discusses an enamel which represents a polyamido amine bound to low-molecular acrylates by a Michael reaction.<br>
DE-A 3133571 proposes a polyurethane wire enamelling system which contains tris(hydroxyethyi)isocyanurate in addition to a polyol and a (blocked) isocyanate component. This system allows a higher enamelling speed than a similar composition without tris(hydroxyethyi)isocyanurate. However, this method is restricted to polyurethane wire enamels.<br>
DE-A 19648830 proposes a polyester imide wire enamelling resin which allows high enamelling speeds. A polyimide is initially produced by reacting polyisocyanate or polyamine with acid or acid anhydride, is reacted with a polyol to form a polyester imide and is subsequently reacted with acid or anhydride. This polyester imide is characterised, in particular, in that it also carries a significant number of acid groups in<br>
addition to hydroxy groups. The enamelling speed is limited by the OH-COOH esterification reaction, which generally takes place more slowly than a transesterification reaction.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides wire-coating composition containing resins with nucleophilic groups as well as possibly amide group-containing resins which are capable of crosslinking with one another, comprising<br>
(A)	5 to 95% by weight of at least one resin with nucleophilic<br>
groups selected from the group consisting of OH, NHR, SH,<br>
carboxylate and CH-acidic groups,<br>
(B)	0 to 70% by weight of at least one amide group-containing<br>
resin and<br>
(C)	5 to 95% by weight of at least one organic solvent,<br>
wherein the resins of either component (A) or, if component B) is contained in the composition, component (B) contain or-carboxy-,/?-oxocycloalkyl carboxylic acid amide groups and the percent by weight of (A) -(C) adds up to 100 percent.<br>
The wire-coating composition according to the invention allows a significant increase in the enamelling speed without losing the positive properties of standard wire enamels. The wire-coating agents according to the invention are stable in storage and exhibit good adhesion to round and profiled electrically conductive wires and have adequate heat shock resistance. An extremely high surface quality is achieved with very good electrical, thermal and mechanical properties, in particular at high enamelling speeds. The enamels according to the invention surprisingly also have better adhesion and better mechanical properties than those of the prior art.<br>

In such cases, the layer thickness of the coating according to the invention can differ greatly.<br>
It is also possible to apply further coatings, for example, further insulating coatings, via the coating according to the invention. These coatings may also be used, for example, as a topcoat, to improve mechanical protection and create desired surface properties as well as providing a smooth surface. For example, compositions based on polyamides, polyamides imides and polyimides are particularly suitable as topcoats.<br>
In particular, the composition according to the.invention is also suitable as a single-layer application.<br>
According to the invention, the composition may be applied in conventional layer thicknesses. Thin layers of, for example, 5 to 10 ^m may also be applied without influencing the resistance to partial discharge achieved according to the invention nor the adhesion, strength and extensibility of the finishes. The dry layer thickness can vary, according to the standardised values for thin and thick electrically conductive wires, for example, for thin wires in low thicknesses of 5 to 10 //m, and for thick wires in thicknesses of about 75 to 89 //m.<br>

Test data according to DIN 46453 and DIN EN 60851: Polyester Imides (Examples 6.8 and 101<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
With amido ester resin:<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
With amide resin:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The tables show clearly that, the higher the content of amide group-containing resin, the better the enamels maintain their general properties when the enamelling speed is changed markedly from 38 to 48 m/min (i.e. the enamels according to the invention exhibit better performance with rapid enamelling). The comparison enamel (a), on the contrary, exhibits significant losses of performance when the enamelling speed is increased.<br>
