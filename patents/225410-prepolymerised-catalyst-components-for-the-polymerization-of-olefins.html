				<td>"PREPOLYMERIZED CATALYST COMPONENTS FOR THE POLYMERIZATION<br>
OF OLEFINS"<br>
The present invention relates to catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins<br>
CH2 = CHR, wherein R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical having 1-12 carbon atoms,<br>
the catalysts obtained therefrom and their use in the polymerization of said olefins.<br>
In particular the catalyst components of the present invention are very suitable for the<br>
preparation of crystalline propylene (co)polymers by using gas-phase, slurry or bulk<br>
(co)polymerization processes.<br>
High-yield catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins and in particular for<br>
propylene are known in the art. They are generally obtained by supporting, on a<br>
magnesium dihalide, a titanium compound and an electron donor compound as a selectivity<br>
control agent. Said catalyst components are then used together with an aluminum alkyl and,<br>
optionally, another electron donor (external) compound in the stereospecific polymerization<br>
of propylene. Depending on the type of electron donor used the stereoregularity of the<br>
polymer can vary. However, the stereospecific catalysts of interest should be able to give<br>
polypropylene (co)polymers having isotactic index, expressed in terms of xylene<br>
insolubility, of higher than 90%.<br>
Said catalyst components, and the catalysts obtained therefrom, are largely used in the<br>
plants for the (co)polymerization of propylene both operating in liquid phase (slurry or<br>
bulk) and in gas-phase. However, the use of the catalyst components as such is not<br>
completely satisfactory. Indeed, problems such as formation of polymers with irregular<br>
morphology and in particular of fines, low bulk density and low catalyst activity are<br>
experienced when plants operate with catalyst components as such.<br>
In order to solve these problems, an additional prepolymerization line may be included, in<br>
which the catalyst is prepolymerized under controlled conditions, so as to obtain<br>
prepolymerized catalysts having good morphology. After prepolymerization, the catalysts<br>
also increase their resistance in such a way that the tendency to break under polymerization<br>
conditions is decreased. As a consequence, also the formation of fines is reduced.<br>
Moreover also the activity of the catalyst and the bulk density of the final polymers results<br>
to be improved. The use of this additional line, however, makes the plant operations and<br>
design more complex and costly; in certain cases it is therefore desirable to avoid it.<br>
One of the alternative solutions is that of supplying the plants directly with a<br>
prepolymerized catalyst which can be prepared in another facility. This solution requires<br>
the preparation of a prepolymerized catalyst meeting certain requirements such as easy<br>
preparation and handling, easy stocking operability, absence or minimal reduction of<br>
activity with time (aging) preferably coupled with a basic high activity.<br>
USP 5,641,721 discloses a method for preparing a prepolymerized catalyst comprising (i)<br>
the preparation of a procatalyst composition by depositing a transition metal compound on a<br>
suitable support, (ii) mixing said procatalyst composition with a viscous substance and then<br>
prepolymerizing said procatalyst composition with a monomer in the presence of said<br>
viscous substance. The viscous substance has a viscosity of from 1000 to 15000 cP while<br>
the monomer used is propylene. Albeit it is alleged that the catalyst activity is unchanged<br>
after 5 months, it appears that the selectivity is decreased. Moreover, the prepolymerization<br>
in such a viscous substance makes the preparation of the prepolymerized catalyst complex<br>
and, in addition, leads to a low catalyst activity.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that by carrying out the prepolymerization with a<br>
specific monomer it is possible to obtain a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins which<br>
has a high catalyst activity, a high isotactic index and which is not affected by aging.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention a prepolymerized catalyst component for<br>
the (co)polymerization of olefins CH2 = CHR. wherein R is hydrogen or a C1-C12 alkyl<br>
group, characterized by comprising a solid catalyst component, comprising Ti, Mg,<br>
halogen and an electron donor compound, being capable of yielding, under standard<br>
polymerization conditions, a propylene homopolymer having an insolubility in xylene at<br>
25°C higher than 90%, which is prepolymerized with ethylene to such an extent that the<br>
amount of the ethylene prepolymer is up to 100g per g of said solid catalyst component.<br>
Preferably the amount of ethylene polymer is less than 15 g and more preferably said<br>
amount is less than 5 g per g of solid catalyst component.<br>
In particular, the catalyst components comprise a titanium compound, having at least a Ti-<br>
halogen bond and the above mentioned electron donor compound supported on a Mg halide.<br>
The magnesium halides, preferably MgCl2, in active form used as a support for Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalysts, are widely known from the patent literature. Patents USP 4,298,718 and<br>
USP 4,495,338 were the first to describe the use of these compounds in 7,iegler-Natta<br>
catalysis. It is known from these patents that the magnesium dihalides in active form used<br>
as support or co-support in components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins are<br>
characterized by X-ray spectra in which the most intense diffraction line that appears in the<br>
spectrum of the non-active halide is diminished in intensity and is replaced by a halo whose<br>
maximum intensity is displaced towards lower angles relative to that of the more intense<br>
line.<br>
The preferred titanium compounds used in the catalyst component of the present invention<br>
are TiCl4 and TiCl3; furthermore, also Ti-haloalcoholates of formula Ti(OR)n-yXy, where n<br>
is the valence of titanium and y is a number between 1 and n, can be used.<br>
The internal electron-donor compound may be selected from esters, ethers, amines and<br>
ketones. It is preferably selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl esters of monocarboxylic<br>
acids, for example benzoic acid, or polycarboxylic acids, for example phthalic or malonic<br>
acid, the said alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl groups having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
Moreover, it can be also selected from 1,3-diethers of formula (I):<br><br>
wherein RI, RII, RIII, RIV, RV and RVI equal or different to each other, are hydrogen or<br>
hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and RVII and RVIII, equal or<br>
different from each other, have the same meaning of RI-RVI except that they cannot be<br>
hydrogen; one or more of the RI-RVIII groups can be linked to form a cycle. Particularly<br>
preferred are the 1,3-diethers in which RVII and RVIII are selected from C1-C4 alkyl radicals.<br>
Examples of preferred electron-donor compounds are methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate,<br>
diisobutyl phthalate and 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene. As explained above, however,<br>
the internal electron donor compound must be selected in such a way to have a final solid<br>
catalyst component capable of producing, under the standard polymerization test disclosed<br>
below, a propylene homopolymer having an insolubility in xylene at 25°C higher than<br>
90%.<br>
The preparation of the solid catalyst component can be carried out according to several<br>
methods. According to one of these methods, the magnesium dichloride in an anhydrous<br>
state, the titanium compound and the electron donor compound of formula (I) are milled<br>
together under conditions in which activation of the magnesium dichloride occurs. The so<br>
obtained product can be treated one or more times with an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature<br>
between 80 and 135°C. This treatment is followed by washings with hydrocarbon solvents<br>
until chloride ions disappeared. According to a further method, the product obtained by co-<br>
milling the magnesium chloride in an anhydrous state, the titanium compound and the<br>
electron donor compound is treated with halogenated hydrocarbons such as 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane etc. The treatment is carried out for a time<br>
between 1 and 4 hours and at temperature of from 40°C to the boiling point of the<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon. The product obtained is then generally washed with inert<br>
hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane.<br>
According to another method, magnesium dichloride is preactivated according to well<br>
known methods and then treated with an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature of about 80 to<br>
135°C in the presence of the electron donor compound. The treatment with TiCl4 is<br>
repeated and the solid is washed with hexane in order to eliminate any non-reacted TiCl4.<br>
A further method comprises the reaction between magnesium alcoholates or<br>
chloroalcoholates (in particular chloroalcoholates prepared according to U.S. 4,220,554)<br>
and an excess of TiCl4 in the presence of an electron donor compound (I) at a temperature<br>
of about 80 to 120°C.<br>
Particularly preferred are the solid catalyst component prepared by reacting a titanium<br>
compound of formula Ti(OR)n-yXy, where n is the valence of titanium and y is a number<br>
between 1 and n, preferably TiCl4, with an adduct of formula MgCl2.pROH, where p is a<br>
number between 0,1 and 6 and R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1-18 carbon atoms. The<br>
adduct can be suitably prepared in spherical form by mixing alcohol and magnesium<br>
chloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon immiscible with the adduct, operating<br>
under stirring conditions at the melting temperature of the adduct (100-130°C). Then, the<br>
emulsion is quickly quenched, thereby causing the solidification of the adduct in form of<br>
spherical particles. Examples of spherical adducts prepared according to this procedure are<br>
described in USP 4,399,054. The so obtained adduct can be directly reacted with the Ti<br>
compound or it can be previously subjected to thermal controlled dealcoholation (80-<br>
130°C) so as to obtain an adduct in which the number of moles of alcohol is generally<br>
lower than 3 preferably between 0.1 and 2.5. The dealcoholated adduct is then suspended<br>
in cold TiCl4 (generally 0°C); the mixture is heated up to 80-130°C and kept at this<br>
temperature for 0.5-2 hours. The treatment with TiCl4 can be carried out one or more<br>
times. The internal electron donor compound can be added during the treatment with TiCl4.<br>
The treatment with the electron donor compound can be repeated one or more times.<br>
The preparation of catalyst components in spherical form is described for example in<br>
European Patent Applications EP-A-395083.<br>
The solid catalyst components obtained according to the above method show a surface area<br>
(by B.E.T. method) generally between 20 and 500 nr/g and preferably between 50 and 400<br>
nr/g, and more preferably between 100 and 400 nr/g; a total porosity (by B.E.T. method)<br>
higher than 0.2 cm3/g preferably between 0.2. and 0.6 cm3/g and more preferably from 0.3<br>
to 0.5 cm3/g. The porosity (Hg method) due to pores with radius up to 10.000A generally<br>
ranges from 0.3 to 1.5 cm3/g. preferably from 0.45 to 1 cm3/g.<br>
A further method to prepare the solid catalyst component of the invention comprises<br>
halogenating magnesium dihydrocarbyloxide compounds, such as magnesium dialkoxide or<br>
diaryloxide, with solution of TiCl, in aromatic hydrocarbon (such as toluene, xylene etc.)<br>
at temperatures between 80 and 130°C. The treatment with TiCl4 in aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
solution can be repeated one or more times, and the internal electron donor compound is<br>
added during one or more of these treatments. In any of these preparation methods, the<br>
desired internal electron donor compound can be added as such or, in an alternative way, it<br>
can be obtained in situ by using an appropriate precursor capable to be transformed in the<br>
desired electron donor compound by means, for example, of known chemical reactions<br>
such as esterification, transesterificution etc. Generally, the internal electron donor<br>
compound is used in molar ratio with respect to the MgCl2, of from 0.01 to 1 preferably<br>
from 0.05 to 0.5.<br>
As explained above the prepolymerized catalyst component can be obtained by<br>
prepolymerizing the solid catalyst component together with ethylene. The<br>
prepolymerization is normally carried out in the presence of an Al-alkyl compound.<br>
The alkyl-Al compound (B) is preferably chosen among the trialkyl aluminum compounds<br>
such as for example triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-<br>
hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. It is also possible to use mixtures of<br>
trialkylaluminum's with alkylaluminum halides, alkylaluminum hydrides or alkylaluminum<br>
sesquichlorides such as AlEt2Cl and Al2Et3Cl3.<br>
It has been found particularly advantageous to carry out said prepolymerization using low<br>
amounts of alkyl-Al compound. In particular said amount can be such as to have an Al/Ti<br>
molar ratio from 0.0001 to 50, preferably from 0.001 to 10 and more preferably from 0.01<br>
to 1.<br>
Moreover, it has also been found advantageous to carry out said prepolymerization in the<br>
absence of an external donor compound.<br>
The prepolymerization can be carried out in liquid phase, (slurry or solution) or in gas-<br>
phase at temperatures generally lower than 80°C, preferably between -20 and 50°C.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferably carried out in a liquid diluent in particular selected from<br>
liquid hydrocarbons. Among them, pentane, hexane and heptane are preferred.<br>
As explained the so obtained prepolymerized catalyst components can be used in the<br>
polymerization of olelin.s, and in particular of propylene, allowing to obtain high activity<br>
and polymers with high stereoregularity, high bulk density and very good morphology thus<br>
showing their particular suitability for the liquid (bulk or slurry) and gas-phase processes.<br>
In addition, as it is shown in the examples, aging problems are solved since the activity of<br>
the catalyst remains unaltered or even improved in some cases, after several months of<br>
time. Accordingly, the catalyst components of the invention are particularly suitable for the<br>
use in liquid or gas-phase olefin polymerization plants operating without a<br>
prepolymerization line.<br>
In particular, said olefin polymerization processes can be carried out in the presence of a<br>
catalyst comprising (A) the prepolymerized catalyst component; (B) an Al-alkyl compound<br>
of the type described above and optionally (C) one or more electron donor (external)<br>
compound.<br>
This latter can be of the same type or it can be different from the internal donor described<br>
above. Suitable external electron donor compounds include silicon compounds, ethers,<br>
esters, amines, heterocyclic compounds and particularly 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine,<br>
ketones and the 1,3-diethers of the general formula (I) given above.<br>
Another class of preferred external donor compounds is that of silicon compounds of formula<br>
Ra5Rb6Si(OR7)c, where a and b are integer from 0 to 2, c is an integer from 1 to 3 and the sum<br>
(a+b+c) is 4; R5, R6, and R7, are alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl radicals with 1-18 carbon atoms<br>
optionally containing heteroatoms. Particularly preferred are the silicon compounds in which a<br>
is 1, b is 1, c is 2, at least one of R5 and R6 is selected from branched alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl<br>
groups with 3-10 carbon atoms optionally containing heteroatoms and R7 is a C1-C10 alkyl<br>
group, in particular methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are<br>
methylcyclohexyldimethoxysilane, diphenyldimethoxysilane, methyl-t-butyldimethoxysilane,<br>
dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane, 2-ethylpiperidinyl-2-t-butyldimethoxysilane and<br>
1,1,1 .lrifluoropropyl 2-ethylpiperidinyl-dimethoxysilane, Moreover, are also preferred the<br>
silicon compounds in which a is 0, c is 3, R6 is a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl group, optionally<br>
containing heteroatoms, and R7 is methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are<br>
cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane, t-butyltrimethoxysilane and thexyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
In particular when esters of monocarboxylic acids, for example benzoates are used as<br>
internal donors also the external donor compound is selected from this class p-ethoxy-ethyl<br>
benzoate being the most preferred. In addition, a mixture of this donor with another one<br>
and in particular one selected from the class of silicon compounds can be used. In this case<br>
methylcyclohexyldimethoxysilane and dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane are most preferred.<br>
The electron donor compound (C) is used in such an amount to give a molar ratio between the<br>
organoaluminum compound and said electron donor compound of from 0.1 to 500, preferably<br>
from 1 to 300 and more preferably from 3 to 100.<br>
The above described polymerization process can be carried out under the polymerization<br>
conditions generally known in the art. Accordingly, the polymerization is generally carried<br>
out at temperature of from 20 to 120°C, preferably of from 40 to 80°C. When the<br>
polymerization is carried out in gas-phase the operating pressure is generally between 0.5 and<br>
10 MPa, preferably between 1 and 5 MPa. In the bulk polymerization the operating pressure<br>
is generally between 1 and 6 MPa preferably between 1.5 and 4 MPa.<br>
In any of the polymerization processes used (liquid or gas-phase polymerization) the catalyst<br>
forming components (A), (B) and optionally (C), can be pre-contacted before adding them to<br>
the polymerization reactor. Said pre-contacting step can be carried out in the absence of<br>
polymerizable olefin or optionally in the presence of said olefin in an amount up to 3 g per g<br>
of solid catalyst component. The catalyst forming components can be contacted with a liquid<br>
inert hydrocarbon solvent such as propane, n-hexane, or n-heptane at a temperature below<br>
about 60°C and preferably from about 0°C to 30°C for a time period of from 10 seconds to<br>
60 minutes.<br>
When n gas-phase polymerization process is used, it can be carried out according to known<br>
techniques operating in ore or more reactors having a fluidized or mechanically agitated bed.<br>
Inert fluids such as nitrogen, or low hydrocarbons like propane, can be used both as a<br>
fluidization aid and in order to improve the thermal exchange within the reactors. In addition,<br>
also techniques increasing the removal of the reaction heat comprising the introduction of<br>
liquids, optionally in mixture with gas, into the reactors, can be used. Preferably the liquids<br>
are fresh or make-up monomers. Such techniques are disclosed for example in EP-A-89691,<br>
EP-A-241947, USP 5,352,749, WO94/28032 and EPA-695313.<br>
The following examples are given in order better illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Characterization<br>
Determination of X.I.<br>
2.5 g of polymer were dissolved in 250 ml of o-xylene under stirring at 135EC for 30<br>
minutes, then the solution was cooled to 25°C and after 30 minutes the insoluble polymer was<br>
filtered. The resulting solution was evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue was dried and<br>
weighed to determine the percentage of soluble polymer and then, by difference, the X.I. %.<br>
General procedure for the standard propylene polymerization test<br>
A 4-liter steel autoclave equipped with a stirrer, pressure gauge, thermometer, catalyst-<br>
feeding system, monomer feeding lines and thermostatting jacket, was used. The reactor was<br>
charged with 0.01 g of solid catalyst component and with TEAL, and cyclohexyl-methyl<br>
dimethoxy silane in such amounts to give an Al/Donor molar ratio of 20. Moreover, 3.2 1 of<br>
propylene, and 1.5 1 of hydrogen were added. The system was heated to 70°C over 10 min.<br>
under stirring, and maintained under these conditions for 120 min. At the end of the<br>
polymerization, the polymer was recovered by removing any umeacted monomers and was<br>
dried under vacuum.<br>

Example 7 and comparison example 8<br>
The catalyst components were prepared according to the procedure of example 4 but using<br>
9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)-fluorene instead of ethyl benzoate. The characteristics of the<br>
catalyst components and the results of the propylene polymerization test procedure are<br>
reported in table 1.<br>
Ethylene Prepilymerization<br>
The catalyst components prepared according to the above procedure were prepolymerized<br>
with ethylene under the conditions reported in table 2. In comparison example 8<br>
prepolymerization was not carried out.<br>
Propylene Polymerization<br>
The catalyst components obtained were then used in the polymerization of propylene which<br>
was carried out in a bulk pilot polymerization plant under the following conditions:<br>
Al/Cat (weight ratio): 13.7<br>
Time (min.): 80<br>
Temperature (°C): 70<br>
without using an external donor The results are shown in table 3.<br>
Evaluation of aging properties<br>
The catalyst components prepared according to the examples 4 and 5 were tested for the<br>
polymerization of propylene in order to evaluate their aging properties. A first test was<br>
carried out after the prepolymerization and a further test was carried out after 120 days. All<br>
the tests were carried out according to the general standard procedure but using p-ethoxy-<br>
ethylbenzoate as external donor in an amount such as to give an Al/donor molar ratio of<br>
1.8. The results are reported in table 4.<br>
