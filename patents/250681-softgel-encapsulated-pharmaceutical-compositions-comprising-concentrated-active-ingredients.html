				<td>SOFTGEL ENCAPSULATED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING CONCENTRATED ACTIVE INGREDIENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising concentrated active ingredients. In particular, the present invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising highly concentrated pharmaceutical actives, wherein the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for incorporation into soft gelatin capsules having improved stability.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions are available in many forms including liquid and solid pharmaceutical formulations. These pharmaceutical compositions are known to be effective in treating ailments such as symptoms of the common cold and/or influenza, and can be administered in various product forms such as liquid elixirs, encapsulated soft gelatin capsules, encapsulated hard shell capsules, tablets, lozenges, and so forth.<br>
Technology related to the administration of liquid pharmaceutical compositions has advanced such that pharmaceutical compositions comprising highly concentrated active ingredients have been successfully formulated to treat cold and/or influenza-like symptoms. See, for example, U.S. Patents 5,484,606; 5,141,961; 5,641,512; and 6,251,426; WO 95/19759; WO 03/013481; and WO 95/04527. The liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising highly concentrated active typically contain a combination of polyethylene glycol and polyvinylpyrrolidone solvents to solubilize the concentrated active.<br>
The use of soft gelatin capsules (also known as "softgels") to encapsulate liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising highly concentrated active is also known. The liquid pharmaceutical compositions contained within the soft gelatin capsules are typically compositions comprising solubilized or suspended concentrated active ingredients. The soft gelatin capsules are suitable for use as vitamin supplements, for the prevention and treatment of symptoms of the common cold and/or influenza, and for other pharmaceutical treatments such as antacid capsules, benzodiazepine capsules, antiflatulent capsules, and so forth.<br>
One attempt to manufacture a soft gelatin capsule containing a liquid pharmaceutical composition that comprises a suspension of concentrated active is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,002,777. This patent relates to the encapsulation of a concentrated liquid suspension of calcium<br><br>
carbonate particles of specific size and shape, wherein the capsules are suitable for use as antacid capsules.<br>
Another attempt to manufacture a soft gelatin capsule containing a liquid pharmaceutical composition that comprises a suspension of concentrated active is the process disclosed hi U.S. Patent 6,387,400. This patent discloses a process for formulating suspensions of increased concentration of pharmaceutical active ingredients by mixing active-containing suspensions with a hydroxide ion source.<br>
Yet other attempts to manufacture soft gelatin capsules containing liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising suspensions of active ingredients are described in U.S. Patents; 5,908,636; 5,916,590; 5,919,481; and 6,024,980. These patents disclose soft gelatin capsules filled with a semi-solid containing a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical active.<br>
Still yet another attempt to manufacture soft gelatin capsules containing liquid pharmaceutical compositions that comprise concentrated active ingredients is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,360,615, which describes a solvent system comprising concentrated active and an ionizing agent wherein the solvent system is encapsulated within a softgel.<br>
There also exists prior disclosure outlining the stability effect of soft gelatin capsules comprising a hydrophilic suspension fill that contains acetaminophen. See, for example, the publication by Karunakar S., John T., Chidambaram N., and Dale K.; Banner Pharmacaps, Inc.; entitled "Effect of acetaminophen concentration, as a hydrophilic suspension fill, on the stability of soft gelatin capsules". This publication demonstrated that soft gelatin capsules comprising a high dose of acetaminophen can exhibit deteriorating physical changes such as seam widening, softening, sticking, and increase in the gelatin shell weight.<br>
Despite the state of the art in describing soft gelatin capsules filled with liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising concentrated active ingredients, there is no disclosure of such soft gelatin capsules having improved stability. It has been found that specific stabilizing agents can be incorporated into liquid compositions to provide for improved stability of the compositions and soft gelatin capsules containing the compositions. The stabilizing agents have been found to prevent or minimize negative capsule attributes such as hydrolyzation, premature dissolution, seam widening, softening, sticking, increase shell weight, or tanning of soft gelatin capsules. In addition, the stabilizing agents have been found to provide for minimal or no oxidation or degradation of the active ingredient fill or gelatin shell.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition that comprises (a) from about 55% to about 90% by weight of a suspended pharmaceutical active; (b) from about 0.001% to about 1.00% by weight of a suspended stabilizing agent; and (c) from about 9% to about 39% by weight of a solvent; wherein the composition is encapsulated within a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
It has been found that the stability of soft gelatin capsules can be improved by the incorporation of select stabilizing agents into liquid pharmaceutical compositions encapsulated within the soft gelatin capsules. It is known that liquid pharmaceutical compositions comprising concentrated active ingredients can be encapsulated within soft gelatin capsules, however, such soft gelatin capsules have a tendency to exhibit instability properties such as hydrolyzation, premature dissolution, seam widening, softening, sticking, increase shell weight, and/or tanning (hardening). It has been found that the stabilizing agents of the present invention provides for improved stability of soft gelatin capsules, especially soft gelatin capsules that contain liquid pharmaceutical compositions that comprise suspended, highly concentrated active ingredients.<br>
