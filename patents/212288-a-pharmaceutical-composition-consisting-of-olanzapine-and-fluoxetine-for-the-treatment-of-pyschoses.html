				<td>FIELD OF THE  INVENTION<br>
The present invention belongs to the fields of pharmacology,  medicine and medicinal chemistry,  and provides antipsychotic methode and compositions.<br>
Psychosea are serious mental illnesses charactarized by defective or lost contact with reality. Psychotic patients may also suffer hallucinations and delusionis as part of their disease.    Psychoses exact a tremendous emotional and economic toll on the patieite. their families,  and society as a whole.    While the mechanisms underlying these diverse disease states   are poorly understood,   recently discovered therapies are offering new hope for the treatment of psychotic patients. Progreas in the treatment of psychotic conditions his been achieved through the introduction of new,  atypical antipsychotic agents.    While the side effect profile of these atypical antipsychotics is far superior to thivt of traditional agents,  weight gain is a side effect that has bean observed in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics.<br>
These new agents,  while holding the promise of improving the lives of psychotic patients immeasural ly, may not be a sufficient to treat every psychotic patient.     Since psychotic conditions appear to have a complex etiology,  some achizophrenics wich exhibit depressive episodes during the course of their illness,  or depressed individuals which also have psychotic episodes, may not find total relief using only an atypical antipsychotic acent.<br>
2<br><br>
The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a first component which is olanzapine, and e second component which is fluoxetine hydrochloride.<br>
In  this  documient,  all temperatures are  described  in  degrees Celsius,  and all amounts, ratios of amounts  and  concentrations are described in weight units unless otherwise stated. The Compounds<br>
In the general expressions of the present invention, the first component is a compound which acts as an atypical antipsychotic The eosential , feature of an atypical antipsychotic is less acute extrapyramidal symptoms, especially dystonias, associated with therapy as compared to a typical antipsychotic such as haloperi-dol. Clozapine, the prototypical atypical antipsychotic, differs from the typical antipsychotacs with the followang characteristics: (1) greater efficacy in the treatment of overall psycho-pathology in patients with schizophrenia nonresponsive to typical antipsychotics; (2) greater efficacy in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia; and (3) less frequent and quantitatively smaller increases in serum prolactin concentrations asso-ciated with therapy (Beasley, et al . , Neuropsychopharmacology, 14(2), 111-123, (1996)). Atypical antipsychotics include, but are not 1imited to;<br>
Olanzapine, 2-methy1-4-(4-methy1-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b] [1,5]benzodiazepine,  is a known compound and is described in  US<br>
3<br><br>
Patent  No-52293S2 as being useful for the treatment  of  schizophrenia,  schi rophreni f orm  disorder, acute mams,  mild  anxiety states and psychosis. US Patent No-5229382 is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety;<br>
Clozapine. a-chloro-l 1- (4"methy l-l-piperazinyl)-5H-dibenzo[b ,e] [ 1,4]diazepine, is described in US Patent No.3539573, which is herein incorporated by reference in <br>
4<br><br><br>
its entirety.  Clinical efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia is described (Hanes, et al., Psychopharcnacol. Bull., 24, 62 (1988});<br>
Risperidone., 3-[2-[4-( 6-fluoro-l, 2-ben2isoxa20l-3-yl)piperidino]'ethyl] -2-methyl-6, 7,8, 9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido-[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one, and its use in the treatment of psychotic diseases are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,804,663, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety;<br>
Sertindole, 1-[2-[4-[5-chloro-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-lH-indol-3-yr] -1-piperidihyl]ethyl]imidazolidin-2-one, is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,710,500.  Its use in the treatment of schizophrenia is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,112,838 and 5,238,945.  U.S. Patent Nos. 4,710,500; 5,l12", 838; and 5,23 8,945 are herein incorporated by referenceâ€”in their entirety;<br>
Quetiapine, 5-[2-(4-diben2o [b, f ] [1, 4] thiazepin-ll-yl-1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]ethanol, and its activity in assays which demonstrate utility in the treatment of schizophrenia are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,879,288, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Quetiapine is typically administered as its (E)-2-butenedioate (2:1) salt; and<br>
Ziprasidone, 5-[2-[4-(1,2-benzoisothiazol-3-yl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl 6 chloro-l, 3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one, is typically administered as the hydrochloride monohydrate. The compound is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,831,031 and 5,312,925.  Its activity in assays which demonstrate utility in the treatment of schizophrenia are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,831,031.  U.S. Patent Nos. 4,831,031 and 5,312,925 are herein incorporaced by reference in their entirety.<br>
Similarly, when the invention is regarded in its broadest sense, the second component compound is a compound which functions as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.  The measurement of a compound's activity in that utility is now a standard pharmacological assay.  Wong, et al.,<br>
5<br><br><br>
Neuropsychopharmacology. 8, 337-344 (1993).  Many compounds, including those discussed at length above, have such activity, and no doubt many more will be identified in the future.  In the practice of the present invention, it is intended to include reuptake inhibitors which show 50% effective concentrations of about l000 nM or less, in the protocol described by Wong supra.     Serotonin reuptake inhibitors include, but are not limited to:<br>
Fluoxetine, N-methyl-3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropylamine, is marketed in the hydrochloride salt form, and as the racemic mixture of its two enantiomers. U.S. Patent 4,314,081 is an early reference on the compound. Robertson et al., J. Med. Chem. 31. 1412 (1988), taught the separation of the R and S enantiomers of fluoxetine and showed that their activity as serotonin uptake inhibitors is similar to each other.  In this document, the word "fluoxetine" will be used to mean any acid addition salt or the free base, and to include either the racemic mixture or either of the R and S enantiomers;<br>
Duloxetine, N-methyl-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-3-(2-thienyDpropanamine, is usually administered as the hydrochloride salt and as the (+) enantiomer.  It was first taught by U.S. Patent 4,956,388, which shows its high potency.  The word-dursxetine" will be used here to refer to any acid addition salt or the free base of the molecule;<br>
Venlafaxine is known in the literature, and its method of synthesis and its activity as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake are taught by U.S. Patent 4,761,501.  Venlafaxine is identified as compound A in that patent;<br>
Milnacip-ran (N,N-diethyl-2-aminomethyl-l-phenyicyclopropanecarboxamide) is taught by U.S. Patent 4,478,836, which prepared milnacipran as its Example 4.  The pa-tent describes its compounds as antidepressants.  Moret et al., Neuropharmacolocgy 24. 1211-19 (1985), describe its pharmacological activities as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake;<br>
6<br><br>
Citalopram, 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluoropheny1)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile, is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,136,193 as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.  Its pharmacology was disclosed by Christensen et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 41, 153 (1977), and reports of its clinical effectiveness in depression may be found in Dufour et al.. Int. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 2,   225 (1987), and Timmerman et. al.., ibid., 23 9;<br>
Fluvoxamine, 5-methoxy-l-[4-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-1-pentanone O-{2-aminoethyl)oxiine, is taught by U.S. Patent 4,085,225.  Scientific articles about the drug have been published by Claassen et. al., Brit. J. Pharmacol. 60. 505 (1977) ; and De Wilde et. al-, J, Affective Disord. 1, 249 (1982); and Benfield et. al., Drugs 32. 313 (1986);<br>
Paroxetine, trans-(-)-3-1(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yloxy)methyl] -4- (4-f luorophenyDpiperidine, may be found in U.S. Patents 3,912,743 and 4,007,196.  Reports of the drug's activity are in Lassen, Eur. J.

Many of the compounds used in this invention are amines, and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts.  Since some of the free amines of the compounds of this invention are typically oils at room temperature, it is preferable to convert the free amines to their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for ease of handling and administration, since the latter are routinely solid at room temperature.  Acids commonly employed to form such salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids, such as E-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid and the like.  Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus are the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, aerylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-l,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, p-hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-l-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like.  Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those formed with hydrochloric acid, oxalic acid or fumaric acid.<br>

Administration<br>
The dosages of the drugs used in the present invention must, in the final analysis, be set by the physician in charge of the case, using knowledge of the drugs, the properties of the drugs in combination as determined in clinical trials, and the  characteristics of the patient, including diseases other than that for which the physician is treating the patient.  General outlines of the dosages, and some preferred dosages, can and will be provided here.  Dosage guidelines for some of the drugs will first be given separately; in order to create a guideline for any desired combination, one would choose the guidelines for each of the component drugs.<br>
Olanzapine:  from about 0.25 to 50 mg, once/day; preferred, from 1 to 3 0 mg, once/day;and most preferably 1 to 25 mg once/day;<br>
Clozapine:  from about 12.5 to 900 mg daily; preferred, from about 150 to 450 mg daily;<br>
Risperidone:  from about 0.25 to 16 mg daily; preferred from about 2-8 mg daily;<br>
Sertindole:  from about .0001 to 1.0 mg/kg daily;<br>
Quetiapine:  from about 1.0 to 40 mg/kg given once daily or in divided doses;<br>
Ziprasidpne:  from about 5 to 500 mg daily; preferred from about 50 to 100 mg daily.;<br>
Fluoxetine:  from about 1 to about 80  mg, once/day; preferred, from about 10 to about 40 mg once/day; preferred for bulimia and obsessive-compulsive disease, from about 20 to about 80 mg once/day;<br>

Paroxetine:  from about 20 to about 50 mg once/day; preferred, from about 2 0 to about 3 0 mg once/day.<br>
Sertraline:  from about 20 to about 500 mg once/day; preferred, from about 50 to about 200 mg once/day;<br>
In more general terms, one would create a combination of the present invention by choosing a dosage of first and second component compounds according to the spirit of the above guideline.<br>
The adjunctive therapy of the present invention is carried out by administering a first component together with the second component in any manner which provides effective levels of the compounds in the body at the same time.  All of the compounds concerned are orally available and are normally administered orally, and so oral administration of the adjunctive combination is preferred.  They may be administered together, in a single dosage form, or may be administered separately.<br>
However, oral administration is not the only route or even the only preferred route.  For example, transdermal administration may be very desirable for patients who are forgetful or petulant about taking oral medicine.  One of the drugs may be administered by one route, such as oral, and the others may be administered by the transdermal, percutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal or intrarectal route, in particular circumstances.  The route of administration may be varied in any way, limited by the physical properties of the drugs and the convenience of the patxent and the caregiver.<br>
The adjunctive combination may be administered as a single pharmaceutical composition, and so pharmaceutical compositions incorporating both compounds are important embodiments of the present invention.  Such compositions may take any physical form which is pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
19<br><br>
but orally usable pharmaceutical compositions are particularly preferred.  Such adjunctive pharmaceutical compositions contain an effective amount of each of the compounds, which effective amount is related to the daily dose of the compounds to be administered.  Each adjunctive dosage unit may contain the daily doses of all compounds, or may contain a fraction of the daily doses, such as one-third of the doses.  Alternatively, each dosage unit may contain the entire dose of one of the compounds, and a fraction of the dose of the other compounds.  In such case, the patient would daily take one of the combination dosage units, and one or more units containing only the other compounds.  The amounts of each drug to be contained in each dosage unit depends on the identity of the drugs chosen for the therapy, and other factors such as the indication for which the adjunctive therapy is being given.<br>
The inert ingredients and manner of formulation of the adjunctive pharmaceutical compositions are conventional, except for the presence of the combination of the present invention.  The usual methods of formulation used in pharmaceutical science may be used here.  All of the usual types of compositions may be used, including tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, intranasal sprays or powders, troches, suppositories, transdermal patches and suspensions.  In general, compositions contain from about 0.5% to about 50% of the compounds in total, depending on the desired doses and the type of composition to be used.  The amount of the compounds, however, is best defined as the effective amount, that is, the amount of each compound which provides the desired dose to the patient in need of such treatment.  The activity of the adjunctive combinations do not depend on the nature of the composition, so the compositions are chosen and formulated solely for convenience and economy.  Any of the combinations may be formulated in any desired form of composition. Some discussion of different compositions will be provided, followed by some typical formulations.<br>
20<br><br>
Capsules are prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable diluent and filling the proper amount of the mixture in capsules.  The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starch of many different kinds, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders.<br>
Tablets are prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation.  Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound.  Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar.  Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful.  Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like.  Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine and the like.  Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders.<br>
A lubricant is necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils.<br>
Tablet disintegrators are substances which swell when wetted to break up the tablet and release the compound. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums. More particularly, corn and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation-exchange resins, alginic acid, guar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethylcellulose, for example, may be used, as well as sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
Enteric formulations are often used to protect an active ingredient from the strongly acid contents of the<br><br>
stomach.  Such formulations are created by coating a solid dosage form with a film of a polymer which is insoluble in acid environments, and soluble in basic environments. Exemplary films are cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate.  It is preferred to formulate duloxetine and duloxetine-containing combinations as enteric compositions, and even more preferred to formulate them as enteric pellets.<br>
A preferred duloxetine enteric formulation is a pellet formulation comprising a) a core consisting of duloxetine and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient; b) an optional separating layer; c) an enteric layer comprising hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient; d) an optional finishing layer.  This enteric formulation is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,508,276, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Tablets are often coated with sugar as a flavor and sealant.  The compounds may also be formulated as chewable tablets, by using large amounts of pleasant-tasting substances such as mannitol in the formulation, as is now well-established practice.  Instantly dissolving tablet-like formulations are also now frequently used to assure that the patient consumes the dosage form, and to avoid the difficulty in swallowing solid objects that bothers some patients.<br>
When it is desired to administer the combination as a suppository, the usual bases may be used.  Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which may be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water-miscible suppository bases comprising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use, also.<br>
Transdermal patches have become popular recently. Typically they comprise a resinous composition in which the drugs will dissolve, or partially dissolve, which is held in<br>
22<br><br><br>
contact with the skin by a film which protects the composition.  Many patents have appeared in the field recently.  Other, more complicated patch compositions are also in use, particularly those having a membrane pierced with innumerable pores through which the drugs are pumped by osmotic action.<br>

Benefit of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides the advantage of treatment of psychotic conditions and mild anxiety with the atypical antipsychotics without the concomitant weight gain typically observed with such treatment, conferring a marked<br>
26<br><br>
and unexpected benefit on the patient.  The present invention furthermore provides a potentiation of the increase in the concentration of norepinephrine observed as an effect of administration of a first component compound, by administration of a second component compound.<br>
The present invention is particularly suited for use in the treatment of bipolar disorders, mania (mixed state), schizoaffective disorders characterized by the occurance of a depressive episode during the period of illness, and depression with psychotic features.  Such disorders may often be resistant to treatment with an antipsychotic alone.<br>
The present invention also is useful for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and anorexia nervosa.  Furthermore, the present invention is useful for the treatment of the agression/violence which may be associated with certain disorders.  These disorders include, but are not limited to, mania, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, substance abuse, head injury, and mental retardation.<br>
Psychotic conditions to be treated by the present method of adjunctive therapy include schizophrenia, schizophreniform diseases, acute mania, schizoaffective disorders, and depression with psychotic features.  The titles given these conditions represent multiple disease states.  The following list illustrates a number of these disease states, many of which are classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, published by the American Psychiatric Association (DSM).  The DSM code numbers for these disease states are supplied below, when available, for the convenience of the reader.<br>
Paranoid Type Schizophrenia  295.30 Disorganized Type Schizophrenia  295.10 Catatonic Type Schizophrenia  295.20 Undifferentiated Type Schizophrenia  295.90<br>
27<br><br><br>
Residual Type Schizophrenia  295.60<br>
Schizophreniform Disorder  295.40<br>
Schizoaffective Disorder 295.70<br>
Schizoaffective Disorder of the Depressive Type<br>
Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features 296.24,<br>
296.34<br>
Psychoses are often associated with other diseases and conditions, or caused by such other conditions.  For example, they are associated with neurological conditions, endocrine conditions, metabolic conditions, fluid or electrolyte imbalances, hepatic or renal diseases, and autoimmune disorders with central nervous system involvement.  Psychoses may also be associated with use or abuse of certain substances.  These substances include, but are not limited to cocaine, methylphenidate, dexmethasone, amphetamine and related substances, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, phencyclidine, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics.  Psychotic disorders may also occur in association with withdrawal from certain substances.  These substances include, but are not limited to, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics.  The embodiments of the present invention are useful for treatment of psychotic conditions associated with any of these conditions.<br>
Microdialvsis assays of monoamines<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan or Charles River) weighing 270-300 grams are surgically implanted with microdialysis probes under chloral hydrate/pentobarbital anesthesia (170 and 36 mg/kg i.p. in 30% propylene glycol, 14% ethanol) (Perry and Fuller, Effect of fluoxetine on serotonin and dopamine concentration in rat hypothalamus after administration of fluoxetine plus L-5-hydroxytrypto-phan. Life Sci., 50, 1683-90 (1992)).  A David Kopf stereotaxic instrument is used to implant the probe unilaterally in the hypothalamus at coordinates rostral -1.5 mm, lateral -1.3 mm, and ventral -9.0 mm (Paxinos and Watson, 1986).  After a 48 hour recovery period, rats are<br>
28<br><br>
placed in a large plastic bowl with a mounted liquid swivel system (CMA/120 system for freely moving animals, Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN).  Filtered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (150 mM NaCl, 3.0 mM KCl, 1.7 mM CaC12, and 0.9 mM MgC12) is perfused through the probe at a rate of 1.0 ml/min.  The output dialysate line is fitted to a tenport HPLC valve with a 20 Âµl loop.  At the end of each 30 minute sampling period, dialysate collected in the loop is injected on an analytical column (Spherisorb 3 Âµ ODS2, 2X150 mm, Keystone Scientific).<br>
The method used to measure monoamines is as described by Perry and Fuller (1992).  Briefly, dialysate collected in the 20 Âµl loop is assayed for 5-HT, NE and DA, The 20 10.1 injection goes onto the column with a mobile phase which resolves NE, DA, and 5-HT: 75 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1.4 mM sodium octanesulfonic acid and 8% methanol, pH 4.9.  The mobile phase for the amine column is delivered with a flow programmable pump at an initial flow rate of 0.2 ml/min increasing to 0.3 ml/min at 5 min then decreasing back to 0.2 ml/min at 26 min with a total run time of 30 min.  Flow programming is used to elute the 5-HT within a 25 min time period.  The electrochemical detector (EG&amp;G, Model 400) for the amine column is set at a potential of 400 mV and a sensitivity of 0.2 nA/V.  Basal levels are measured for at least 90 minutes prior to drug administration.  The drugs are prepared in filtered deionized water (volume 0.25-0.3 ml) for administration at the desired doses.<br>
