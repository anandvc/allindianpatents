OIL BODY ASSOCIATED PROTEIN COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE<br>
This application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/373,460, filed April 18, 2002, the entire disclosure of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compositions, polypeptides and methods for reducing cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. More particularly, the invention relates to novel compositions comprising oil body associated proteins and use thereof for the prevention and treatment of elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality within the human population. This is particularly so in the United States and in Western European countries. Numerous causative factors have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease. Several of these factors include hereditary predisposition to the disease, lifestyle factors such as smoking and diet, age, gender, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, including hypercholesterolemia. A number of these factors, particularly hyperlipidemia and hypercholesteremia, contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a primary cause of cardiovascular disease.<br>
High blood cholesterol concentration is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in humans. Elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol ("LDL") and total cholesterol are directly related to an increased risk of coronary heart disease. (Anderson et al, 1987). Although high levels of total cholesterol and LDL are risk factors in developing atherosclerosis and vascular diseases, a deficiency of high density lipoprotein cholesterol ("HDL") has recently been recognized as an additional risk factor for developing these conditions. Several clinical trials support the theory of a protective role of HDL against atherosclerosis. One such study has demonstrated that, in women, every 1-mg/dl increase in HDL in the blood decreases the risk for coronary vascular disease by 3%. (Gordon et al, 1989).<br>
Studies have indicated that dietary changes can reduce cholesterol in humans. Of these, particular studies have indicated that the quality, as well as the quantity, of protein ingested<br><br>
greatly affects serum cholesterol levels. (Carol and Hamilton, 1975; Nagaoka et al, 1992; Potter, 1995). Ingestion of vegetable protein materials in place of animal protein in the diet is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, which may reflect decreases in serum cholesterol levels. Particularly, soy protein, a vegetable protein, has been shown to reduce serum cholesterol levels relative to the animal protein casein (Nagaoka et al, 1999). A more recent meta-analysis of the effects of soy protein intake on serum lipids in humans has shown that dietary soy protein is significantly related to lowering serum concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL in humans without significantly affecting HDL-cholesterol concentrations (Anderson et al, 1995).<br>
One of the agents responsible for the ability of soy protein to lower cholesterol is the high molecular weight fraction (HMF). The HMF constitutes the non-digestible portion of soy protein that remains intact after proteolytic digestion. This fraction, therefore, is composed of a number of different peptides or peptide fragments. The HMF of soy protein, in fact, has been shown to significantly reduce serum cholesterol in both animal and human studies. It is believed that the non-digestible HMF prevents the uptake of cholesterol either by the prevention of passive uptake of cholesterol by the brush border membrane or by the prevention of protein-mediated uptake of cholesterol. In contrast, the lower molecular weight fraction, a digestible fraction of soy protein, has actually been shown to increase serum cholesterol (Sugano, et al, 1988).<br>
Despite the potential therapeutic value of soy protein, and in particular the HMF, as a cholesterol lowering agent, the specific constituents responsible for its non-digestive and hypocholesterolemic activity have not been determined. A need, therefore, remains to identify these active constituents in an effort to provide a therapeutic agent that is more potent in reducing cholesterol and other risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by identifying compositions with cardiovascular health benefits. In particular, one aspect of the invention concerns the discovery that oil body associated proteins have the ability to lower cholesterol levels. While plant components, such as soy protein, have been known to have hypocholesterolemic activity, the particular constituents responsible for this activity have not been previously characterized. The current invention, therefore, relates to the discovery of the ability of oil body associated proteins, including, oleosins and egg yolk lipoproteins, to impart upon plant proteins a characteristic ability to lower cholesterol. Equally, the present invention resides in the synergistic combination of these particular components with plant material such as soy foodstuffs. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the oil body associated proteins prevent the digestion of bioactive peptides present in soy material and thereby synergistically enhance the hypocholesterolemic activity of the composition. Additionally, the present invention relates to the synergistic combination of components in combination with soy material and an additive component selected from the group consisting of a saponin, a phytoestrogen, a phospholipid, and a carbohydrate substantially resistant to digestion, or any combination thereof, to further enhance the hypocholesterolemic activity of the combination. The present invention also encompasses the therapeutic use of these peptides, either alone or in combination with other compounds, to lower total cholesterol concentration in the blood, and in particular to decrease LDL-cholesterol concentration, to inhibit the development of cardiovascular disease.<br>
Oil bodies are small, spherical, subcellular organelles encapsulating stored triacylglycerides, an energy reserve used by many plants. Although found in most plants and in different tissues, they are particularly abundant in the seeds of oilseeds, where they commonly range in size from under one micron to a few microns in diameter. Oil bodies are typically comprised of triacylglycerides and surrounded by lipoproteins and proteins. An "oil body associated protein" includes any and all of these proteins and lipoproteins which are physically associated with oil bodies. In plants, the major oil body associated proteins are oleosins. Oleosins have been cloned and sequenced from many plant sources including corn, rapeseed, carrot and cotton. Oleosins from different species typically are highly conserved.<br>
I.	Abbreviations and Definitions<br>
To facilitate understanding of the invention, a number of terms and abbreviations as used herein are defined below:<br>
HMF=high molecular weight fraction<br>
As used herein, "high molecular weight fraction" refers to the fraction of plant protein isolate which remains after hydrolytic or chemical digestion of the isolate which can be separated by centrifugation at 4,000 to 10,000 x g for 15 to 20 min at a pH 6-7.<br>
As used herein, "additive compound" refers collectively to a single compound or a group of compounds added to the composition of the invention. These compounds are selected from the group consisting of saponin, phytoestrogen, phospholipid, and carbohydrate.<br>
As used herein, the term "amino acid" is used in its broadest sense, and includes naturally occurring amino acids as well as non-naturally occurring amino acids, including amino acid analogs and derivatives. The latter includes molecules containing an amino acid moiety. One skilled in the art will recognize, in view of this broad definition, that reference herein to an amino acid includes, for example, naturally occurring proteogenic L-amino acids; D-amino acids; chemically modified amino acids such as amino acid analogs and derivatives; naturally occurring non-proteogenic amino acids such as norleucine, (P-alanine, ornithine, etc.; and chemically synthesized compounds having properties known in the art to be characteristic of amino acids.<br>
As used herein, the term "proteogenic" indicates that the amino acid can be incorporated into a peptide, polypeptide, or protein in a cell through a metabolic pathway.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" embraces salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and addition salts of free acids or free bases. The nature of the salt is not critical, provided that it is pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
As used herein, "secretion sequence" or "signal peptide" or "signal sequence" means a sequence that directs newly synthesized secretory or membrane proteins to and through membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, or from the cytoplasm to the periplasm across the inner membrane of bacteria, or from the matrix of mitochondria into the inner space, or from the stroma of chloroplasts into the thylakoid. Fusion of such a sequence to a gene that is to be expressed in a heterologous host ensures secretion of the recombinant protein from the host cell.<br>
As used herein, "polypeptide" and "oligopeptide" are used interchangeably and mean a polymer of at least 2 amino acids joined together by peptide bonds.<br>
As used herein, "sequence" means the linear order in which monomers occur in a polymer, for example, the order of amino acids in a polypeptide or the order of nucleotides in a polynucleotide.<br>
As used herein, "Comminuted whole soy beans" include, for example, a soy material formed by flaking or grinding whole soybeans, including the hull and germ of the soybeans. A comminuted whole soybean material may contain fat inherent in soy or may be defatted.<br>
As used herein, "Soy flour" includes, for example, a soy material containing less than 65% soy protein content by weight on a moisture free basis which is formed from dehulled soybeans and which has an average particle size of 150 microns or less. The term "Soy flour" may include, for example, soy milk powder. A soy flour may contain fat inherent in soy or be defatted.<br>
As used herein, "Soy grit" includes, for example, a soy material containing less than 65% soy protein content by weight on a moisture free basis which is formed from dehulled soybeans and which has an average particle size of from 150 microns to 1000 microns. A soy grit may contain fat inherent in soy or may be defatted.<br>
As used herein, "Soy meal" includes, for example, a soy material containing less than 65% soy protein content by weight on a moisture free basis which is formed from dehulled soybeans which does not fall within the definition of a soy flour or a soy grit. A soy meal may contain fat inherent in soy or may be defatted.<br>
As used herein, "Soy flakes" include, for example, a soy protein material that is a flaked soy material containing less than 65% soy protein content by weight on a moisture free basis formed by flaking dehulled soybeans. Soy flakes may contain fat inherent in soy or may be defatted.<br>
As used herein, "Soy protein concentrate" include, for example, a soy protein material prepared from high quality sound, clean, dehulled soybean seeds. Soy protein concentrate may be prepared by removing most of the oil and water soluble non-protein constituents and typically contain not less than 65% protein on a moisture free basis. In another embodiment, "Soy protein concentrate" may also be construed to additionally comprise mixtures of soy proteins and phospholipids where the total protein on a moisture free basis is between about 65 to about 90% protein. Typically, this is produced from dehulled, defatted soybeans by three basic processes: acid leaching (at about pH 4.5), extraction with alcohol (about 55-80%), and denaturing the protein with moist heat prior to extraction with water. Low water-soluble (aqueous alcohol extraction) soy protein concentrate is subjected to heat (steam injection or jet cooking) and mechanical working (homogenization) to increase solubility and functionality. When referring to mixtures of soy proteins and phospholipids where the total protein on a moisture free basis is between 65 and 90% protein, such material may be prepared by combining soy protein isolate with phospholipids or by fractionating a phospholipid:protein complex from soybeans (i.e., oil<br>
body proteins and associated phospholipids). The term "Soy protein concentrate" may include, for example, soy milk powder.<br>
As used herein, "Soy protein extract" includes, for example, soy protein concentrate or isolate enriched in certain soy proteins. A soy protein material fractionated from the whole soy protein material may be prepared, for example, from soy protein ingredient waste or whey streams (alcohol or acidic water extraction steps).<br>
As used herein, "Soy protein isolate" includes, for example, a soy protein material which is the major proteinaceous fraction of soybeans prepared from dehulled soybeans by removing the majority of non-protein compounds and preferably does not contain less than 90% protein on a moisture free basis. In yet another embodiment, "Soy protein isolate" may also be construed to additionally include soy protein materials enriched in certain types of soy proteins such as, for example, {3-conglycinins, glycinins and oleosins, or alternatively to lack certain types of soy proteins, such as oleosins. The protein is typically extracted from unheated defatted soybean flakes with water or mild alkali in a pH range of 8-9, followed by centrifuging to remove insoluble fibrous residue; adjusting resulting extract to pH 4.5 where most of the protein precipitates as a curd; separating curd by centrifugation from the soluble oligosaccharides, followed by multiple washings, neutralized with sodium or potassium hydroxide (to make it more soluble and functional), heat-treated (e.g. using jet-cooker) and spray-dried. The addition of proteases before the heat-treatment step may also be used to partially hydrolyze the proteins and improve the solubility of soy protein isolates.<br>
As used herein, "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably and mean a compound that consists of two or more amino acids that are linked by means of peptide bonds.<br>
As used herein "recombinant protein" means that the protein, whether comprising a native or mutant primary amino acid sequence, is obtained by expression of a gene carried by a recombinant DNA molecule in a cell other than the cell in which that gene and/or protein is naturally found. In other words, the gene is heterologous to the host in which it is expressed. It should be noted that any alteration of a gene, including the addition of a polynucleotide encoding an affinity purification moiety to the gene, makes that gene unnatural for the purposes of this definition, and thus that gene cannot be "naturally" found in any cell.<br>
As used herein, "targeting sequence" means in the context of proteins or peptides, "targeting sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence the presence of which results in a protein being directed to a particular destination within a cell.<br>
The phrase "therapeutically-effective" indicates the capability of an agent to prevent, or improve the severity of the disease, while avoiding adverse side effects typically associated with<br>
alternative therapies. The phrase "therapeutically-effective" is to be understood to be equivalent to the phrase "effective for the treatment or prevention", and both are intended to qualify, e.g., the amount of the compositions used in the methods of the present invention which will achieve the goal of decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease or preventing said disease while avoiding adverse side effects typically associated with alternative therapies.<br>
II.       Polypeptides of the Invention<br>
Applicants have identified sequences of polypeptides isolated from soy material, and more specifically from the HMF of soy material, that have hypocholesterolemic activity. These sequences encode peptides from glycinin or p-conglycinin. The proteins glycinin and P-conglycinin are seed storage proteins. Glycinin has an approximate molecular weight of 320 kilodaltons ("kDa") and is composed of six subunits, each of which consists of an acidic and a basic subunit. Moreover, ß-conglycinin has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa and is composed of three different kinds of subunits (α, α', and ß) in varying proportions. Glycinin and P-conglycinin type proteins are highly conserved across different plant species.<br>
One aspect of the present invention, therefore, encompasses one to several isolated polypeptides or polypeptide fragments from a glycinin protein. In one embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:l and corresponds to VFDGELQEGRVLIVPQNFVVAARSQSDNFEYVSFK.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the present invention is provided one to several isolated polypeptides or polypeptide fragments from a p-conglycinin protein. In one embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:2 and corresponds to LRMITLAIPVNKPGRFESFFL. In another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:3 and corresponds to IFVIPAGYPVWNATSHLNFFAIGI. In yet another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:4 and corresponds to LQESVIVEISKK. In still another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:5 and corresponds to QQQEEQPLEVRK. In still yet another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:6 and corresponds to NQYGHVR. In still another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:7 and corresponds to ATVILVINEGDANIELVGL. In yet another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:8 and corresponds to NILEASYDTKFEEINK. In still yet another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO: 11 and corresponds to IFVIPAGYPWVNATSDLNFFAFGI.<br>
Applicants have also identified sequences of oleosins that demonstrate hypocholesterolemic activity. Oleosins are primarily found in membrane constituents of plant oil bodies. Oleosin proteins are comprised of three domains; the two ends of the protein, N- and C-termini, are largely hydrophillic and reside on the surface of the oil body exposed to the cytosol while the highly hydrophobic central core of the oleosin is firmly anchored within the membrane and triacylglyceride. Oleosins also contain an amphipathic alpha-helical domain at or near the C-terminus. Oleosins from different species represent a small family of proteins showing considerable amino acid sequence conservation, particularly in the central region of the protein. Within an individual species, a small number of different isoforms may exist.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention, therefore, encompasses one to several isolated polypeptides-or polypeptide fragments from an oleosin protein. In one embodiment, the oleosin is P24 isoform A (P89) from soy (Accession No. P29530; SEQ ID NO: 12), which corresponds to FIG. 1. In yet another embodiment the oleosin is P24 isoform B (P91) from soy (Accession No. P29531; SEQ ID NO: 13), which corresponds to FIG. 2. In still another embodiment, the oleosin is the oil body associated protein 17 kDa oleosin (oleol7) from maize (Zea mays) (Accession No. AAA68066; SEQ ID NO: 14), which corresponds to FIG. 3. In still yet another embodiment, the oleosin is the oil body protein 16 kDa oleosin (oleol6) from maize (Zea mays) (Accession No. AAA68065; SEQ ID NO: 15), which corresponds to FIG. 4. In yet still another embodiment, the oleosin is the oleosin KD18 (KD18; L2) from maize (Zea mays) (Accession No. AAA67699; SEQ ID NO 16), which corresponds to FIG. 5. In another embodiment, the oleosin is the H. annuus oleosin (sunflower) (Accession No. CAA55348; SEQ ID NO: 17), which corresponds to FIG. 6. In still a further embodiment, the sequence of the isolated oleosin polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO:9 and corresponds to VKFITAATIGITLLLL. In yet another embodiment, the sequence of the isolated oleosin polypeptide is provided in SEQ ID NO: 10 and corresponds to YETNSSLNNPPSR.<br>
Also included in the present invention are polypeptides that have 90%, preferably 95%, more preferably 97%, and still more preferably 99% sequence homology with oleosin and the sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. A further embodiment of the invention provides polypeptides that have 90%, preferably 95%, more preferably 97%, and still more preferably 99% sequence homology with any of the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1-11.<br>
"Homology", as is well understood in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, "homology" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such<br>
sequences. "Homology" can be readily calculated by known methods including, but not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, 1987; Sequence Analysis Primer, 1991; and Carillo and Lipman, 1988. Methods to determine homology are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine homology are codified in publicly available programs. Computer programs which can be used to determine identity/homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG (Devereux et al, 1984); suite of five BLAST programs, three designed for nucleotide sequences queries (BLASTN, BLASTX, and TBLASTX) and two designed for protein sequence queries (BLASTP and TBLASTN) (Coulson, 1994; Birren, et al, 1997). The BLAST X program is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLAST Manual; Altschul et al, 1990). The well known Smith Waterman algorithm can also be used to determine homology.<br>
The present invention also relates to the isolated proteins. As used herein the term protein includes fragments, analogs and derivatives of the glycinin, p-conglycinin, or oleosin protein. The protein of the present invention can be a natural protein, a recombinant protein or a synthetic protein or a polypeptide.<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art are aware that modifications in the amino acid sequence of a peptide, polypeptide, or protein can result in equivalent, or possibly improved, second generation peptides, etc., that display equivalent or superior functional characteristics when compared to the original amino acid sequence. The present invention accordingly encompasses such modified amino acid sequences. Alterations can include amino acid insertions, deletions, substitutions, truncations, fusions, shuffling of subunit sequences, and the like, provided that the peptide sequences produced by such modifications have substantially the same functional properties as the naturally occurring counterpart sequences disclosed herein. Biological activity or function can be determined by, for example, the ability of the protein to lower total serum cholesterol as depicted in the examples below.<br>
One factor that can be considered in making such changes is the hydropathic index of amino acids. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein has been discussed by Kyte and Doolittle (1982). It is accepted that the relative hydropathic character of amino acids contributes to the secondary structure of the resultant protein. This, in turn, affects the interaction of the protein with molecules such as enzymes, substrates, receptors, DNA, antibodies, antigens, etc.<br>
Based on its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics, each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index as follows: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate/glutamine/aspartate/ asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).<br>
As is known in the art, certain amino acids in a peptide or protein can be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and produce a resultant peptide or protein having similar biological activity, i.e., which still retains biological functionality. In making such changes, it is preferable that amino acids having hydropathic indices within ±2 are substituted for one another. More preferred substitutions are those wherein the amino acids have hydropathic indices within ±1. Most preferred substitutions are those wherein the amino acids have hydropathic indices within ±0.5.<br>
Like amino acids can also be substituted on the basis of hydrophilicity. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,101 discloses that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the protein. The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to amino acids: arginine/lysine (+3.0); aspartate/glutamate (+3.0 ±1); serine (+0.3); asparagine/glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5 ±1); alanine/histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine/isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5); and tryptophan (-3.4). Thus, one amino acid in a peptide, polypeptide, or protein can be substituted by another amino acid having a similar hydrophilicity score and still produce a resultant protein having similar biological activity, i.e., still retaining correct biological function. In making such changes, amino acids having hydropathic indices within ±2 are preferably substituted for one another, those within ±1 are more preferred, and those within ±0.5 are most preferred.<br>
As outlined above, amino acid substitutions in the peptides of the present invention can be based on the relative similarity of the amino acid side-chain substituents, for example, their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, etc. Exemplary substitutions that take various of the foregoing characteristics into consideration in order to produce conservative amino acid changes resulting in silent changes within the present peptides, etc., can be selected from other members of the class to which the naturally occurring amino acid belongs. Amino acids can be divided into the following four groups: (1) acidic amino acids; (2) basic amino acids; (3) neutral polar amino acids; and (4) neutral non-polar amino acids. Representative amino acids within these various groups include, but are not limited to: (1) acidic (negatively charged) amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid; (2) basic (positively charged) amino acids such as<br>
arginine, histidine, and lysine; (3) neutral polar amino acids such as glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, cystine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; and (4) neutral non-polar amino acids such as alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine. It should be noted that changes which are not expected to be advantageous can also be useful if these result in the production of functional sequences.<br>
The term protein also includes forms of the protein to which one or more substituent groups have been added. A substituent is an atom or group of atoms that is introduced into a molecule by replacement of another atom or group of atoms. Such groups include, but are not limited to lipids, phosphate groups, sugars and carbohydrates. Thus, the term protein includes, for example, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins and phospholipoproteins.<br>
III.      Compositions and Methods of the Invention<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides compositions that are useful for treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. The composition in one embodiment encompasses a plant-based foodstuff to which isolated oil body associated protein has been added. In one embodiment of the invention, the foodstuff is soy-based. In yet another embodiment, the composition comprises an isolated soy material, an isolated oil body associated protein, and at least one additive compound selected from the group consisting of a saponin, phytoestrogen, a phospholipid, and a carbohydrate substantially resistant to digestion. In certain embodiments of the invention, an isolated oil body associated protein may be a purified fraction isolated away from plant protein. For example, isolated oil body associated protein may be enriched 1, 10, 100, 200, 1000 or more fold relative to crude plant proteins. In certain embodiments of the invention, the isolated oil body associated protein may be enriched for oil body associated protein 1,5,10,50 or 100 or more fold relative to, for example, a purified fraction such as HMF.<br>
An isolated soy material employed in the present invention may be prepared and isolated from any soy plant, to the extent the isolate soy material contains the constituents necessary for the isolated soy material to exhibit the desired hypocholesterolemic activity. Isolated soy material may comprise, for example, comminuted whole soy beans, soy flour, soy milk powder, soy grit, soy meal, soy flakes, soy concentrate, soy protein isolate, and soy protein extract. In one embodiment, the soy material is soy concentrate. In yet another embodiment, the soy material is soy protein isolate. In still a further embodiment, the soy material is soy protein extract. Any method known in the art, including those methods detailed herein, may be employed to isolate the particular soy material.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides isolated soy material enriched with certain soy proteins or peptides, such as ß-conglycinins, glycinins and oleosins. These soy materials can be prepared from isolates, concentrates, or from the waste streams of isolate and concentrate manufacture. They can also be prepared from soybeans with a modified protein composition, such as soybeans having twice the normal levels of 6-conglycinin and low levels of glycinin (as described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,171,640).<br>
Preparation of foodstuffs is well known to those of skill in the art. In the case of soy, common food usage includes, but is not limited to, products such as the seed, bean sprouts, baked soybean, full fat soy flour used in various products of baking, roasted soybean used as confectioneries, soy nut butter, soy coffee, and other soy derivatives of oriental foods. Soy protein products (e.g., meal), can be divided into soy flour concentrates and isolates which have both food/feed and industrial use. Soy flour and grits are often used in the manufacturing of meat extenders and analogs, pet foods, baking ingredients and other food products. Food products made from soy flour and isolate include baby food, candy products, cereals, food drinks, noodles, yeast, beer, ale, etc.<br>
In certain aspects of the present invention, isolated soy material which lack, or contain low amounts of, certain types of soy proteins, such as, for example, oleosins, are fortified with oil body associated proteins, such as, for example, oleosins, thereby improving or restoring the hypocholesterolemic properties of the soy protein or soy protein composition. In further embodiments of the invention, oil body associated proteins are added to a final concentration of about 0.5%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 20% or more by weight, including all intermediate ranges within these concentrations. Depending on the particular application, soy materials without oleosin, or with decreased amounts of oleosin, may be highly beneficial. For example, oleosins may be considered undesirable because they bind flavors contributing to the relatively poor flavor quality of soy foods. Moreover, oleosins are also poorly soluble and contribute to the large particle fraction when defatted soymilk is dispersed in water. In one embodiment, the oleosin may be removed by allowing the large particle fraction containing oleosin to settle in a tank or by using ultrafiltration membranes. Alternatively, the oleosins can be precipitated from soy protein isolate at pH 2.8 in the presence of sodium sulfate and calcium chloride (Samoto et al, 1998).<br>
Also encompassed within the present invention is a composition comprising an isolated soy material and an isolated oil body associated protein wherein the isolated soy material is a high molecular weight fraction ("HMF") of a soy protein isolate. The HMF employed in any of<br>
the compositions of the invention may be prepared and isolated from any plant protein isolate in which it naturally occurs to the extent the fraction possesses the desired hypocholesterolemic activity. In one embodiment, the HMF is prepared from a soy protein source. Typical soy material from which the HMF may be prepared include soy beans, dehulled soy beans, soy meal, soy flour, soy grits, soy milk powder, soy flakes (full fat and defatted), soy molasses, soy protein concentrate, soy whey, soy whey protein, and soy protein isolate. In a preferred embodiment, the HMF is prepared from a soy protein isolate.<br>
In order to prepare the HMF, the selected plant protein isolate is subjected to hydrolytic or chemical digestion. Typical agents employed for this digestion process include pepsin or microbial proteases. Typically, for example, the soy protein is incubated with the pepsin enzyme for 13 to 17 hrs, (0.2% NaCl in aqueous phase, 38° C, pH 1.1) with the pepsin enzyme being 0.5 to 5% of soy protein isolate), heat-treated for 20 min at 90°C to inactivate the pepsin, cooled on ice, adjusted to a pH of 6 to 7 with Na2CO3, and centrifuged at 4,500g for 20 min. This pellet can then be washed 3 times with water and identified. Other methods of use of pepsin enzyme are well known in the art.<br>
Microbial proteases, for example, can be Sumizyme FP (Aspergillus niger protease, enzyme activity 48800 U/gm, Shin Nippon Kagaku Kabushiki Kaisha) and incubated with the soy protein at 60°C for five hrs. When using such a solution, rather than adjusting pH, the solution is diluted with water. Centrifugation at 10,000 x g can then be carried out for 10 min. The precipitate can then be collected and identified. Additional methods are known in the art. See, for example, Hori et al. (1999).<br>
The HMF is then isolated from the digested plant protein isolate by any mean generally known in the art. In one embodiment, the HMF is isolated by centrification. Typically, the isolation process may be performed, for example, by drying (e.g., freeze drying) the fraction after centrifugation of an aqueous suspension of soy protein isolate which was treated with a microbial protease or pepsin (protease is 0.5-6% of total protein) and incubating at 30-70°C for 1-20 hrs. Additional methods are well known in the art. See, Nagoako et al., (1999).<br>
Moreover, any peptide isolated from the HMF may be employed in the composition of the invention to the extent that the peptide possesses the desired hypocholesterolemic activity. Typically, however, the peptide utilized in the composition is at least 10 amino acid residues in length, more typically is from about 10 to about 100 amino acid residues in length, and most typically is about 30 to about 80 amino acid residues in length. Also, generally speaking, the peptide is substantially hydrophobic in nature having from about over 30 weight percent to preferably about over 35 weight percent of hydrophobic amino acid composition.   In addition,<br>
the peptide employed may have 0, 1, or more amphipathic regions. Additionally, the peptide employed may have a hydrophobic surface or hydrophobic region that is a result not of a string of hydrophobic amino acids, but of the a-hehcal structure of the peptide.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a composition comprising isolated soy polypeptides isolated from the soy material wherein the soy polypeptides comprise p-conglycinin and glycinin. The structure of both |3-conglycinin and glycinin was detailed above and a detailed review of their structures is provided in Utsumi et al. (1997). Without limiting Applicants to a single theory, it is believed that these peptides impart their hypocholesterolemic activity because they are able to survive digestion and become absorbed into the blood stream or bind to bile acids. Also beneficial, though not required, is the presence of an amphipathic a-helical region within the ji-conglycinin. Without limiting the Applicants to any single theory, it is believed that the presence of an amphipathic a-helical region is beneficial because it forms a hydrophobic surface that facilitates interaction with various receptor sites important for imparting hypocholesterolemic activity.<br>
Additionally, and without limiting Applicants to any single theory, the identified polypeptides of the invention may also serve as a source of nitrogen to beneficial bacteria in the colon. These bacteria can then produce short chain fatty acids such as propionate acid which positively affect lipid metabolism. The short chain fatty acids inhibit synthesis of fatty acids in the liver, lowering the rates of triglyceride secretion and also reduce hepatic cholesterol synthesis. An aspect of the invention is the use of soy protein polypeptides to promote the production of short chain fatty acids in the colon and reduce serum cholesterol and triglycerides. The effectiveness of undigested soy polypeptides in promoting the growth of beneficial colonic bacteria will be most significant in the presence of undigested carbohydrates such as high amylose cornstarch which are an important fuel for human colonic microflora. Therefore another embodiment of the invention is the combination of soy polypeptide ingredients with sources of undigested carbohydrates to optimize the beneficial effects of polypeptides on serum cholesterol and triglycerides.<br>
One aspect of the invention, therefore, provides compositions having specific polypeptides isolated from ß-conglycinin. Generally speaking, these polypeptide sequences correspond to any one of the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, and SEQ ID NO: 11. These sequences may be isolated from P-conglycinin by a method, for example, involving (1) enzymatic hydrolysis of soy material followed by isolation of the high molecular weight fraction, e.g. by centrifugation or (2)<br>
enzymolysis of soy material followed by further purification by an ultrafiltration membrane, ion exchange resin column, and gel filtration column chromatography giving peptides of a molecular weight range of approximately 200 to about 5,000 kilodaltons (see, for example, the method detailed in Yamauchi and Suetsuna (1993). The peptides can be fractionated further by using ion-exchange chromatography (Chen et al, 1995). Alternatively, rather than isolate the individual sequences from the particular P-conglycinin subunits, it is also possible to utilize soybeans having twice the normal levels of P-conglycinin and merely isolate the p-conglycinin from the soybeans. Likewise, it is also possible to utilize the same germplasm where only a particular P-conglycinin subunit is expressed in order to obtain crude preparations of this subunit. The active peptides are then produced after consumption of the crude preparations as a result of hydrolyzation in the gut by pepsin and pancreatin, or are obtained during ingredient manufacture using microbial enzymes. Therefore, in another embodiment of the invention is provided a composition comprising a crude preparation of a particular subunit of p-conglycinin combined with an oleosin preparation.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention provides compositions having specific polypeptides isolated from glycinin. In one embodiment the composition contains a polypeptide isolated from the basic subunit of glycinin. In yet another embodiment, the composition comprises a polypeptide isolated from the B-lb subunit of glycinin. In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises a peptide isolated from glycinin which corresponds to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:l. Typically glycinin is isolated from protein sources using isolation procedures that are well known in the art. An example of these isolation procedures are those used to isolate other protein isolates, as outlined above.<br>
The compositions of the invention typically also contain an oil body associated protein. As used herein, the term "oil body associated protein" includes any protein, lipoprotein or peptide physically associated with an oil body structure or intracellular lipid particle. Generally speaking, most eukaryotic cells from species such as plants, mammals, non-mammalian cells, algae and yeast contain intracellular lipid particles. These particles are known as lipid bodies, lipid droplets or, especially in plants, oil bodies, oleosomes, or spherosomes, depending upon the species. The lipid particles of eukaryotic cells consist of a highly hydrophobic core of neutral lipids, mainly triacylglycerols and/or steryl esters, surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer with a small amount of proteins embedded. A typical composition of oil bodies isolated from maize is triacylglycerols (95%), diacylglycerols (4%), phospholipids (0.9%) and protein (1.4%).<br>
Typical oil body associated proteins useful in the compositions of the invention include oil body proteins such as oleosins in the form of apoproteins or as lipoproteins and a 34-kD soybean seed storage vacuole protein that associates with the oil bodies. One aspect of the invention, therefore, provides a composition that comprises an isolated soy material and a peptide isolated from an oil body associated protein wherein the peptide is an oleosin or a peptide fragment from an oleosin. The oleosin may be represented by the sequences of P24 Oleosin Isoform A (P89) Accession No. P29530, as is provided in SEQ ID NO: 12 and corresponding to FIG. 1, P24 Oleosin Isoform B (P91) Accession No. P29531, as is provided in SEQ ID NO: 13 and corresponding to FIG. 2, the oil body associated protein 17 kDa oleosin (oleol7) Accession No. AAA68066, as provided in SEQ ID NO:14 and corresponding to FIG. 3, the oil body protein 16 kDa oleosin (oleol6) Accession No. AAA68065, as provided in SEQ ID NO:15 and corresponding to FIG. 4, the oleosin KD18 (KD18; L2) Accession No. AAA67699, as provided in SEQ ID NO 16 and corresponding to FIG. 5, and the H. annuus oleosin Accession No. CAA55348, as provided in SEQ ID NO: 17 and corresponding to FIG. 6. More typically, the peptide employed in the composition is from a low molecular weight oleosin with an approximate molecular weight of 17 kilodaltons. In certain embodiments, the peptide is from an oleosin and will correspond to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 or SEQ ID NO: 10.<br>
The oleosin peptide employed in the composition of the invention may be isolated from intact oil bodies. Toward that end, intact oil bodies may be isolated from seeds as a source of oil body associated proteins. Methods and lists of seed types that can be used are provided, for example, in WO 00/30602. Methods for preparing oil bodies are also described in Japanese Patent App. Pub. No. 2002-101820. The oil may be extracted from the oil bodies with diethyl ether, leaving the interfaceial materials (oleosins and phospholipids) in the aqueous fraction. The phopholipids may be extracted using choroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol) or other suitable organic solvents. In particular, oleosins are isolated as the aggregated fraction (Tzen and Huang 1992). In addition, a high pH extraction may be used to remove P34 protein, if present. The P34 protein has an isoelectric pH below 6.5, and therefore, will be soluble at high pH where oleosins have their isoelectric pH and precipitate.<br>
Oleosins may also be isolated from whole soybeans soaked in water or from defatted soy flour. Oleosin may be isolated from protein sources using isolation procedures that are well known in the art. An example of these isolation procedures are those used to isolate oleosins from defatted soy flour, as outlined above. Another example is the isolation of oleosins from whole soybeans (JP 2002-101820). Additional sources of oleosins include plant cells, fungal cells, yeast cells, (Leber et al, 1994), bacterial cells, (Pieper-Furst et al, 1994) and algae cells<br>
(Roessler, 1988). In preferred embodiments of the invention, oleosins are obtained from a plant cell which includes cells from pollens, spores, seed, and vegetative plant organs in which oleosins or oil-body like organelles are present (Huang, 1992). More preferably, the oleosins of the present invention are obtained from a plant seed and most preferably from the group of plant species comprising: rapeseed (Brassica sppj, soybean (Glycine max), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), oil palm (Elaeis guineeis), cottonseed (Gossypium spp.J, groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), coconut (Cocus nucifera), castor (Ricinus cummunis), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), mustard (Brassica spp. and sinapis alba), coriander (Conundrum sativum), squach (Cucurbita maxima), lineseed/flax (Linum usitatissumum), Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), maize (Lea mays), crambe (Crambe abyssinica), and eruca (Eruca sativa).<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention encompasses a composition that comprises an isolated soy material and a peptide isolated -from an oil body associated protein wherein the peptide is a lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are noncovalent, nonstoichiometric, particulate complexes of neutral lipid, phospholipid, and protein found in both animal an plant cells. In one embodiment, the lipoprotein is a mammalian lipoprotein. In yet another embodiment, the lipoprotein is egg yolk lipoprotein (for a review of egg yolk structure, see for example, Bringe (1997), the content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.) In still another embodiment, the lipoprotein comprises a fat globulin membrane protein.<br>
Lipoproteins may be isolated from oil body associated protein sources using procedures that are well known in the art An example of these isolation procedures are those used to isolate oil body proteins or oleosins from defatted soy flour, as outlined above. Moreover, egg yolk lipoproteins may be isolated from oil body associated protein sources using isolation procedures that are well known in the art.<br>
As an example of these isolation procedures, egg yolk lipoproteins can be isolated by extracting the triglycerides and cholesterol using supercritical carbon dioxide (see for example, Bringe and Cheng, 1995). A further aspect of the invention provides a composition comprising a soy material in combination with an oil body associated protein and an additive compound. The additive compound may include any compound that therapeutically enhances the composition. Typically, however, the additive compound is selected from the group consisting of a saponin, a phytoestrogen, a phospholipid, and a carbohydrate substantially resistant to digestion. Generally speaking, without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that these additive compounds enhance the hypocholesterolemic activity of the composition by substantially preventing the digestion of cholesterol-lowering polypeptides in the isolated soy material.<br>
Because of these properties, the additive compounds of the invention increase the therapeutic capacity of the composition. In a preferred embodiment, accordingly, the compositions of the invention may have any combination of the specific additive components identified above in combination with an isolated soy material and an isolated oil body associated protein.<br>
In one embodiment, therefore, a composition of the present invention may include one to several saponins as an additive compound. The saponin may be isolated from a plant source in which it naturally occurs by any known method, such as the method of Gurfinkel et al, (2002), or it can be synthetically prepared by any known method. Any saponin is suitable for use in the current invention to the extent that the compound selected enhances the properties of the composition for use as a hypocholesterolemic agent. Typically, however, the saponin employed is isolated from a legume, such as alfalfa or soybean plants, or from oats or other plant seeds. More typically, the saponin is isolated from soybean seeds, and more specifically may be isolated from the soybean germ. Sources of saponins include, for example, soybeans, quillaja, alfalfa, and soapwart. Soy saponins include, for example, saponin A, B, E, and sapogenol A, B, and E.<br>
Moreover a composition of the invention may include one to several phytoestrogens as an additive compound. The phytoestrogen may be isolated from a plant source in which it naturally occurs by any known method, such as the method detailed in U.S. Patent No. 5,855,892 or WO 00/30663, or it can be synthetically prepared by any known method. Any phytoestrogen is suitable for use in the current invention to the extent that the compound selected enhances the properties of the composition fox use as a hypocholesterolemic agent. Typically, the phytoestrogen employed in the composition is an isoflavone. More typically, the isoflavone is genistein, daidzein (including its metabolites o-desmethylangolensin, dihydroclaidzein, and equol), biochanin A, formononetin, and their respective naturally occurring glucosides and glucoside conjugates present in soybeans or clover.<br>
A composition of the invention may also include one to several phospholipids as an additive compound. Phospholipids may be from various sources, but are typically isolated, for example, from seeds, and more typically from the oil seeds of soy plants. These include lecithin and lyso-lecithin. Additionally, phospholipids with a modified fatty acid composition can be used. Such phospholipids can be enzyme modified soy phospholipids. Enzyme modified phospholipids may be prepared, for example, from soy phospholipids (SLP; True Lecithin, Mie, Japan) by treatment with phospholipase A2 (Novo Industry, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) (Nagaoka, et al., 1999). Additionally, phospholipids with a modified fatty acid composition can be obtained from plants or plant seeds that have been genetically modified to produce phospholipids with<br>
modified fatty acid compositions. An example of a phospholipid with a modified fatty acid composition is lecithin with a modified fatty acid composition. Other methods that are well known in the art may also be used to modify the fatty acid compositions of phospholipids.<br>
Additionally, a composition of the invention may also include one to several carbohydrates. Any carbohydrate may be utilized in a composition of the invention to the extent that the compound selected enhances the properties of the composition for use as a hypocholesterolemic agent. Typically, however, the carbohydrates employed are carbohydrates that are substantially resistant to digestion. As utilized herein, "substantially resistant to digestion" when used to describe a carbohydrate is defined, in the art, to typically mean, for example, carbohydrates that are greater than about 70% resistant to digestion, preferably greater than about 80% resistant to digestion, and more preferably greater than about 90% resistant to digestion. Generally speaking, carbohydrates rich in amylose starch or fiber are particularly suitable for use in a composition. In one embodiment, for example, the carbohydrate employed in the composition is high amylose starch, oligofructose, or soy cotyledon fiber. In addition, embodiments are, for example, starches that are physically inaccessible (partly milled grains and seeds), resistant granules (raw potato, green banana, some legumes, and high amylose starches), retrograded starches (cooked and cooled potato, bread, and cornflakes), and chemically modified starches (etherized, esterified, or cross-bonded starches (used in processed foods)) (Topping and Clifton, 2001).<br>
Any combination of an isolated soy material and an isolated oil body associated protein, in the presence or absence of at least one additive compound, may be combined to form a composition of the invention. Table 1 below, for example, illustrates a number of typical formulations for different embodiments of compositions of the present invention.<br>
Table 1. Formulations of the Composition<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the composition has an isolated soy material content of not less than 50 weight percent of the composition and an oil body associated protein content of not less than 0.5 weight percent of the composition. More preferably, however, the composition has an isolated soy material content of not less than about 70 to about 90 weight percent weight percent of the composition and an oil body associated protein content of between about 1 to about 5 weight percent of the composition. When present, the additive compounds such as isoflavone or saponin compounds typically comprises not less than 10 mg/lOOg of the composition and may further comprise between about 30 to 300 mg/lOOg of the composition, Moreover, when present, the additive compounds such as phospholipids or a carbohydrate substantially resistant to digestion, typically comprises not less than 2 weight percent and may further comprise between about 10 to 50 weight percent of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be administered to a mammal as agents to prevent or treat the development of atherosclerosis and vascular disease. More specifically, the compositions of the invention may be administered to a mammal, preferably a human, to decrease the total serum cholesterol concentration, to decrease the low density lipoprotein concentration, to increase the high density lipoprotein concentration, to decrease the concentration of cholesterol in the liver, and to decrease the concentration of serum triglycerides. Generally speaking, without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the compositions of the invention exert their hypocholesterolemic activity by preventing cholesterol absorption, substantially inhibiting bile acid reabsorption, and/or may be utilized as a nitrogen source by bacteria in the colon of the mammal.<br>

V.       Examples<br>
Example 1 Identification of HMF from soy protein<br>
The polypeptides present in the HMF of soy protein have active cholesterol-lowering properties (See Example 2). Studies were conducted to identify the origin and partial sequences of these polypeptides. The methods used were as follows:<br>
A.	Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.<br>
Polyacrylimide gel electrophoresis methods were performed in accordance with methods known in the art. Several different methods were employed in the present invention, and are as follows:<br>
B.	Tris-Glycine Sodium Dodecylsulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis<br>
(SDS-PAGE)<br>
Prepare soy protein samples for analysis by freezing intact or ground soybeans and<br>
powdering them in a percussion mortar (powdering not necessary for soy protein isolates) and<br>
extracting proteins for 1 hr at room temperature using 0.03M Tris, 0.01M 2-mercaptoethanol at<br>
pH=8.0.  Prepare a 4 mg/ml solution of these proteins in SDS solubilizing solution (0.0625 M<br>
Tris, 2.3 % SDS, 5 %  ß-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8, trace of bromophenol blue as a<br>
tracking dye). Heat samples for 10 min at 70°C, cool 5 min, then centrifuge to pellet insoluble<br>
materials. Load 5 µL (20 µg) of each sample supernatant on a 10-20% total acrylamide gel (as<br>
described by Laemmli (1970) and separate by electrophoresis at 15-30 mA per gel (constant current) or 60-100 volts (constant voltage). Terminate electrophoresis when tracking dye is within 2 mm of the bottom of the gel. SYPRO Orange may be substituted for Coomassie following method number 2 in Malone et al, (2001).<br>
C       SDS-PAGE analysis by NuPAGE gel electrophoresis<br>
Prepare samples as detailed in Tris Glycine SDS-PAGE section, using 4x NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (NOVEX catalog # NP0003 as 1/4 of the sample volume, and 500mM dithiothreitol as 1/10 of the sample volume. Load 4 p.L (16 ug) of each sample supernatant on a Novex 4-12% acrylamide Bis-Tris gel. Fill Novex Xcell 2 rnini-gel tank with NuPAGE MES Running Buffer (50 mM MES, 50 mM Tris, 3.5 mM SDS, 1.025 mM EDTA, pH=7.7) and separate proteins by electrophoresis at 200 volts (constant voltage) until the tracking dye reaches the slot at the bottom of the gel. Stain gel as detailed in Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE protocol.<br>
D.	2-D PAGE of Soy proteins<br>
Extract soy proteins as detailed in Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE section. Supplement samples to contain 8M urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.35% dithiothreitol, 0.2% ampholyte, and 15% isopropanol to a final volume of 450 uL containing 0.6 to 1.05mg total protein. Use 430 uL of this solution to re-swell an 18cm pH 3-10 immobilized pH Gradient (JPG) drystrip for 24-30 hrs (cover strips with mineral oil while re-swelling). Using water-soaked electrode strips, focus the IPG strips (covered with mineral oil) for 50,000-70,000 volt-hours using the following voltage ramping approach. Begin with 1 hr at 100 volts (v), then 1 hr at 200 v, 2 hrs at 400 v, 14 hrs in a linear ramp from 400 to 10000 volts, then up to 48 hrs at 10000 volts to reach the final volt-hour total. Soak each IPG strip in 1.5 mL of sample equilibration solution (62.5 mM Tris, 2.3% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8 and a trace of bromophenol blue as a tracking dye) for 3.5 min. Drain strips, then place each on a 10-20% acrylamide Tris Glycine gel, sealing it in place using hot 1% agarose in equilibration solution. Run the second dimension gels and stain them as detailed in the Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE section.<br>
E.	In Situ Trypsinization of proteins in acrylamide gels<br>
Cut out gel bands or spots, placing them in 1500 ul siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. Wash twice with 50% methanol (30 min per wash) to remove stain. Equilibrate gel pieces in 50% acetonitrile (in 200 mM ammonium acetate pH = 8.0) for 15 min. Repeat washes twice. Wash 15 min 100% acetonitrile, then evaporate to dryness in a Speedvac. Trypsinize for 16-20 hrs at 37°C using 20 µg/mL sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega cat # V5111) in 10%<br>
acetonitrile in 200 mM ammonium acetate pH-8.0. Extract peptides with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 20 min agitating with a Nutator. Repeat extraction using 80% acetonitrile 0.1% TFA in ammonium acetate for 20 min. Repeat the last extraction for 30 min. Combine all supernatents and dry extracts in Speed-vac.<br>
F.        Trypsinization of the bands to provide tryptic polypeptides of the polypeptides present in a given band.<br>
In gel trypsin digestion of the bands in order to provide tryptic polypeptides of the<br>
polypeptides present in a given band was performed according to the following protocol:<br>
1)	Cut out gel spots, making the largest dimension of any piece less than 1 mm. Place gel pieces in 1500 µl siliconized microcentrifuge tubes.<br>
2)	Wash gel pieces with 2 or more washes (200 \x\ per tube) of 50% methanol (30 min per wash) to remove stain. Coomassie stained gels may be washed additional times to remove stain. Gel pieces may be stored in this solution. Agitate tubes using Nutator.<br>
3)	Wash gel pieces twice in 200 µl 50% acetonitrile (in 200 mM ammonium acetate pH = 8.0 - adjusted with NH40H) for 15 min per wash, then one additional wash for 30 min. Agitate using Nutator.<br>
4)	Wash 15 min 100% acetonitrile.<br>
5)	Withdraw solution from gel pieces and evaporate to dryness in Speedvac (15 min).<br>
6)	Make Trypsin stock by adding 1ml of 10% acetonitrile (in 200 mM NH40Ac, pH 7.8-8.3 - adjusted with NH40H) to a 20 µg vial of trypsin. (Promega Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin - cat# V5111 used).<br>
7)	Digest protein by adding just enough trypsin solution to cover gel pieces in each tube. Typically, 20 µl is sufficient.<br>
8)	Incubate pieces at 37°C for 16-20 hrs.<br>
9)	Cool tubes to room temperature, and microcentrifuge tubes to bring moisture to bottom.<br>
10)	Extract peptides with 200 µl 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 20 min<br>
agitating with a Nutator.<br>
11)	Save supematents  individually for  each tube,  then re-extract  using 200 jal  80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA for 15 min agitating with a Nutator.<br>
12)	Save supematents adding to that saved previously for each tube, then extract one final time using 200 ul 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA for 30 min with agitation on a Nutator.<br>
13)	Save supernatent and add to that saved previously for each tube. Dry extracts in Speed-vac.<br>
G.       MALDI-TOF analysis<br>
Tryptic polypeptides from a band were ionized using laser desorption (for MALDI) or electrospray (for LC/MS and LC/MS/MS) to create a mass spectrum. The masses of the peptides are measured as a mixture using MALDI; there is no separation of the tryptic peptides. Samples were prepared foT MALDI analysis using a slightly modified published procedure (Shevchenko et al, 1996). The samples were reconstituted by adding 10 µL 0.1% TFA to each tube containing the dried peptides. Matrix was prepared by dissolving 10 mg/mL nitrocellulose and 20 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid of a 1:1 (v:v) mixture of acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Matrix was spotted by delivering 0.5 µL of matrix solution onto the MALDI plate. Similarly, 1 uL of sample from each sample was deposited onto the spotted matrix. The sample was allowed to dry on the matrix for approximately 10 min to ensure that peptides bound to the nitrocellulose. Finally, three aqueous washes were performed by depositing 5 µL of 5% formic acid onto each spot and immediately aspirating this solution off using a vacuum line. The MALDI sample plate was then moved to the mass spectrometer for MALDI mass spectrometry analysis. The data was collected using the Voyager DE-STR (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) in the reflectron mode. The spectra were internally calibrated using known trypsin autolysis peaks. Peak lists of the tryptic peptide masses were generated, and these were searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the MS-Fit search tool in order to identify the proteins (Clauser el al, (1999).<br>
Sometimes, the match is "borderline" and requires confirmation, or the data is weak or there is simply no significant match. In these cases, nano LC/MS/MS is used. In this method, the digest mixture is injected onto a reversed-phase column so that the peptides are separated and introduced into the mass spectrometer (in this case an electrospray, tandem mass spectrometer), one at a time (or at least a couple at a time). The mass spectrometer measures the mass of the peptides, isolates the most abundant ones by filtering out everything else, and sends a peptide into a collision cell where the peptide collides with Ar gas. Peptides tend to fragment about the<br>
amide bonds, so the fragments can be indicative of the amino acid sequence. The fragmentation data can be submitted to a database searching tool, which matches the data to the protein sequence database. It uses the partial sequence and the original mass of the tryptic peptide to get a match. A protein can be identified using the MS/MS data from a single tryptic peptide with high confidence.<br>
H.       Nano HPLC<br>
Nano HPLC is used to separate the tryptic fragments from a purified protein (purified by electrophoresis) so that only one (or a few) peptides are introduced into the electrospray, tandem mass spectrometer at a time. Samples were injected into a CapLC (Waters, Milford, MA) system equipped with an autosampler, gradient and auxiliary pump. Five microliters was injected via "microliter pickup" mode and desalted on-line through a 300 µm x 5 mm C18 trapping cartridge (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The samples were desalted at high flow (30 uL/min) for 3 min. The peptides were separated on a 100 µm x 150 mm Magic C18 column (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) prior to introduction into the mass spectrometer. A typical reverse phase gradient was used from low to high organic over about 30 min. Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid and B was 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was also increased linearly with organic mobile phase. The system utilized a small split flow resulting in a column flow rate of approximately 300-700 nL/min.<br>
I.	MS/MS Analysis and Data Processinq<br>
For LC/MS/MS, there is a separation step (reversed-phase LC), so that the tryptic peptides are introduced into the mass spectrometer (ideally) one at a time. It is called MS/MS, or tandem MS, because first the mass of a peptide is measured, and then the mass of the fragments from this peptide are measured. A tryptic peptide is fragmented by collisions with a stationary gas (Ar) and the masses of the fragments are measured. This will often give the sequence of at least part of the peptide. Data dependent MS/MS studies were performed on a Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Micromass, Beverly, MA). The inlet is a modified nanospray source designed to hold a picotip (New Objective, Cambridge, MA). The collision energy used for CAD was determined based on the mass and charge state of the peptide. The data was processed by ProteinLynx version 3.4 (Micromass, Beverly, MA) to generate peak list files. The data was searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the search engine MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK).   The search engine reported the top twenty hits.<br>
Sequence data that did not match any entries in this database were searched against the dbEST database from NCBI as well as internally generated sequence databases.<br>
J.        Study 1<br>
HMF from the soy protein isolate called OBAP-rich was separated using polyacrylimide gel electrophoresis. Five polypeptide containing bands or areas of the gel were trypsinized and analyzed for amino acid sequence using mass spectroscopy (FIG. 7). The origins of the bands were identified as in Table 2:<br>

K.       Study 2<br>
The putative oleosin sequence above did not match known oleosin sequences. The sequence of the lower molecular weight soy oleosin (~18 kDa) was not known. The purpose of the following study was to determine if the above "putative oleosin" sequence was from the 18 kDa soybean oleosin. Oil-body-associated proteins (p34 protein and oleosins) were purified and separated on a polyacrylimide gel (FIG. 8). The bands were trypsinized and analysed by MS.<br>
The presence of a trypric peptide, released from the amphipathic N-terminal region of oleosin right next to the hydrophobic domain, was confirmed in a 12 kDa band isolated from HMF. The average mass per amino acid is 111.1 Daltons. Thus, the number of amino acids in a<br>
12 kDa peptide is approximately 108 amino acids. Therefore, the peptide found in HMF must also contain a portion of the hydrophobic domain of oleosin. Sequence YETNNSSLNNPPSR (SEQ ID NO: 10) represents residues 33-45 of the putative oleosin which falls just before the beginning of the hydrophobic core region of the protein.<br>
Results: Confirmed that sequence, YETNSSLNNPPSR (SEQ ID NO: 10), is found in low molecular weight soy oleosin.<br>

L.        Study 3<br>
The HMF characterized in Study 1 was made from a soy protein fraction which had little beta-conglycinin. This helped identify the glycinin subunits which are present in HMF. The following study was conducted to determine what, if any, beta-conglycinin sequences can be identified in HMF. Soybeans lacking Gl glycinins were used to make soy protein isolate and the isolate was digested with pepsin to make HMF. The HMF was separated using polyacrylimide gel electrophoresis (FIG. 9) and the bands were trypsinized and characterized using MS. Results:   Polypeptide sequences from beta-conglycinins were identified.<br>

Example 2 Effect of HMF on cholesterol uptake<br>
Caco-2 cell line is derived from a human colorectal carcinoma and is commonly used to study intestinal epithelial cell physiology. These cells have been used to study cholesterol, glucose, amino acid, vitamin, fatty acid, bile acid and drug transport processes (Hidalgo et ai, 1989); Artursson, 1990; Homan and Hamelehle, 1998). These cells express lipid and sterol metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins that are regulated similarly to those in enterocytes (Levy et ai, 1995). Also, they are known to express SR-B1, a recently identified protein that may play a role in cholesterol absorption (Werder et ai, 2001) as well as various proteins in the ATP-binding cassette transporter family which may also play a role in mediating net cholesterol uptake by intestinal epithelial cells (Taipalensuu et ah, 2001).<br>
Soy protein is the source of HMF. Briefly, soy proteins were incubated with pepsin for 17 hrs (0.2% NaCl in aqueous phase, 38°C, pH 1.1, pepsin was 5% of soy protein isolate), heat-treated for 20 min at 90°C to inactivate pepsin, cooled on ice, adjusted pH to 6.21 with 0.2 M Na2CO3 and centrifuged at 4,500g for 20 min. This pellet is washed 3 times with water and identified as HMF.<br>

B.       Cholesterol Absorption Assay<br>
Uptake of micellar cholesterol by Caco-2 cells was conducted by a modification of the method reported by Field et al. (1991). Our method is described as follows: 1. Compounds/peptides to be tested for their ability to inhibit cholesterol absorption in Caco-2 cells are dissolved as stock solutions in DMSO. Dilutions of test compounds from STOCK solutions are made in pentanol. Dilutions of compounds to be used in the Caco-2 cholesterol absorption inhibition assay should be 10X higher than the desired final dilution to be assayed, i.e pipet 2 mM solution in well to get 200 µM final in assay.  Sitostanol is used as the<br>
control cholesterol absorption inhibitor with maximal inhibition at 200 mM (0% cholesterol absorption control). Solvent only is used as the 100% cholesterol absorption (high dpm).<br>
2.	Dilutions of control and test compounds/peptides are pipetted into polypropylene shallow-well microtiter plates (Sigma M-4029) in triplicate.<br>
3.	The plates are dried in a GeneVac instrument overnight at a temperature of 35°C - 45°C. Plates are checked for complete dryness before next step.<br>
4.	The 3H-cholesterol micelle mix is prepared as follows in Trace-Clean amber vials with septa liner caps (VWR Cat No. 15900-036):<br>
To 1.0 ml of 10X STOCK micelle solution (10X Stock Micelle Solution = 50 mM Taurocholate, 1 mM Oleic Acid, 1 mM Cholesterol) add 37.5 µl 3H-Cholesterol (NEN Cat. No. NET-725) (0.75 nmol chol) = 37.5 µCi 3H-cholesterol (Solution contains 0.075% chol as radiolabel = trace). Prepare 1.8 ml per microtiter assay plate to allow for overage.<br>
5.	Pipet 15 µl/well of diluent CH3Cl:MeOH (1:1) into all wells of the dried plates to solvate the dried residue. Use the polypropylene reservoirs for this and keep reservoirs on ice to minimize evaporation of the solvent.<br>
6.	To the same plates, add 15 µl of the 3H-cholesterol mix to each well using a polypropylene reservoir on ice to contain the radiolabel solution.<br>
7.	Dry the plates in a pre-heated 37°C evaporation chamber (VWR) flushing with nitrogen gas for approx. 20-30 mins.<br>
8.	Rinse dried wells with 50 µl/well of ethyl ether and re-dry in evaporation chamber. Repeat ether rinse 1 more time and dry.<br>
9.	Place plates in vacuum dessicator overnight.<br>
10.	Pipet 150 µl room temperature Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma H-8264) into each dried well using a Quadra 96 workstation. The final concentration of micellar lipids is as follows: 5 mM taurocholate, 100 µM oleic acid, 100 uM cholesterol and 3.75 µCi/ml 3H-cholesterol (or approx. 5 µM) .<br>
11.	Seal plates with adhesive sealing tape (Packard TopSeal-A Adhesive Sealing Tape or Sigma Mylar Sealing Tape T-2162) and shake on Labline plate shaker, Model 4625, (setting=6) for at least 30 mins at room temperature to solubilize micelles.<br>
12.	Wash Caco-2 cells plated on 96 well plates (described above) 5 times with HBSS using automated cell washer. Do this JUST PRIOR to step 13. Remove any excess liquid by smacking plate on paper towels before adding the micelles in the next step.<br>
13.	Transfer 100 ul of solubilized micelles into the appropriately marked Caco-2 cell plate using the Quadra 96 workstation. Place the plate back in the 37°C incubator for 4 hr.<br>
14.	Wash cells 5 times with cold 1 mM Taurocholate in HBSS (1 mM TC) using automated cell washer.<br>
15.	Pipet 200 nl/well of scintillation cocktail (Packard MicroScint 40, Cat No. 6013641) into cell plates using Quadra 96 workstation.<br>
16.	Seal plates with heat sealing tape (Packard TopSeal-S Heat Sealing Film) and shake the plates (setting=6 at least) for at least 20 mins to mix the fluor with the cell samples.<br>
17.	Keep the plates in the dark overnight.<br>
18.	Count the dpm using a Packard TopCount NXT instrument.<br>
19.	Results are calculated as % of Control (no inhibitor) as follows:<br>
% of Control =     Test compound/peptide dpm - 200 µM sitostanol dpm      X 100 Control (no compound) dpm - 200 µM sitostanol dpm<br>
Soy HMF from various sources illustrated a dose-dependent inhibition of cholesterol uptake by Caco-2 cells (For example, see FIG. 10). The concentrations of HMF required to reduce the cholesterol uptake by 50% were between 1.2 and 2.9 mg/mL, with the exception of the beta-conglycinin test (4.7 mg/mL).<br>

To determine whether test compounds/peptides affected the solubility of 3H-cholesterol into the micellar solutions prepared for the cholesterol absorption assay (see Methods for Example 2), the following assay was performed:<br>
1.	Micelles are prepared as described in Methods to Example 2, up to and including step #11.<br>
2.	Transfer 20 jil of solubilized micelles into opaque Costar plates (Costar #3917) using the Quadra 96 workstation.<br>
3.	Pipet 200 µl/well of scintillation cocktail (Packard MicroScint 40, cat. No. 6013641) into microtiter plate wells using Quadra 96 workstation.<br>
4.	Seal plates with heat sealing tape (Packard TopSeal-S Heat Sealing Film) and shake the plates (setting=6 at least) for at least 20 mins to mix the fluor with the micelle samples.<br>
5.	Keep the plates in the dark overnight.<br>
6.	Count the dpm using a Packard TopCount NXT instrument.<br>
7.	Results are calculated as % of Control (no inhibitor) as follows:<br>
% of Control =     Test compound/peptide dpm - 200 µM sitostanol dpm      X 100 Control (no compound) dpm - 200 µM sitostanol dpm<br>
8.	If a test compound/peptide displaces 3H-cholesterol from the micelles, a decrease in the<br>
test compoufld/peptide dpm will be seen with higher concentrations of test compound/peptide. If<br>
not, the dpms in the solublized micelles should remain fairly constant over the range of dilutions<br>
of test compound/peptide tested.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates that this is in contrast to the primary mechanism of cholesterol inhibition by sitostanol.<br>
Example 4<br>
Characterization of soy protein HMF<br>
Comparisons were made of the yield of HMF from soy protein isolate fractions which have low amounts of oil body associated protein (OBAP(-)), a fraction rich in oil body associated protein (OBAP(+)) and a control. All were made from the same soybeans (variety A2247).<br>
Briefly, fractions of soy proteins were incubated with pepsin for 17 hrs (0.2% NaCl in aqueous phase, 38°C, pH 1.4, pepsin was 5% of soy protein isolate), heat-treated for 20 min at 90°C to inactivate pepsin, cooled on ice, pH adjusted to 6.21 with 0.2M Na2CO3 and centrifuged at 4,500g for 20 min. The pellet was washed 2 times with water and freeze dried. The weight of the dry pellet was compared to the weight of the original amount of soy protein isolate used in the assay to determine yield of HMF [(final weight/initial weight) x 100]. The OBAP(+) and control soy protein samples both produced HMF. However, the OBAP(-) fraction did not yield any HMF, indicating that oleosin and or components associated with oleosin (e.g. saponins, phospholipids) control the digestibility of the soy proteins.<br>
The following are the procedures utilized to fractionate soy proteins into soy protein isolates (SPI):<br>
A.	Procedure 1: OBAP(-)<br>
1.	Add 1 kg defatted soy flakes (from Cargill) into 15 kg of DI water. Adjust the pH to 7.5 with IN NaOH. Mixing at room temperature for one hour.<br>
2.	Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000g for 10 min and collect the supernatant.<br>
3.	Add Na2SO4 and CaCh into the supernatant at a concentration of 30mM, respectively.<br>
4.	Adjust the pH of the supernatant from step 3 to pH 2.8 with 2N HC1.  Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000g for 10 min. Collect the supernatant<br>
5.	Dilute the supernatant (from step 4) with DI water by 4 times (e.g., from 1 L to 4 L). Adjust the pH to 4.5 with 2N NaOH. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10 min. Collect the precipitate.<br>
6.	Redissolve the precipitate from step 5 into DI water and adjust the pH to 7.5 with 2N NaOH.<br>
7.	Spray drying the neutralized protein mixture at inlet temperature = 200°C, outlet temperature = 90-95°C.<br>
B.	Procedure 2: OBAP(+)<br>
1.	Add 1 kg defatted soy flakes (from Cargill) into 15 kg of DI water. Adjust the pH to 7.5 with IN NaOH. Mixing at room temperature for one hour.<br>
2.	Centrifuge the mixture at 10,0008 for 10 min and collect the supernatant.<br>
3.	Add Na2SO4 and CaCh into the supernatant at a concentration of 30 mM, respectively.<br>
4.	Adjust the pH of the supernatant from step 3 to pH 2.8 with 2N HC1.  Centrifuge the mixture at 10,0008 for 10 min. Collect the precipitate.<br>
5.	Redissolve the precipitate from step 4 into DI water and adjust the pH to 7.5 with 2N NaOH.<br>
6.	Spray drying the neutralized protein mixture at inlet temperature = 200°C, outlet temperature = 90-95°C.<br>
C.       Procedure 3: Control<br>
1.	Add 1 kg defatted soy flakes (from Cargill) into 15 kg of DI water. Adjust the pH to 7.5 with IN NaOH. Mixing at room temperature for one hour.<br>
2.	Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000g for 10 min and collect the supernatant.<br>
3.	Dilute the supernatant (from step 2) with DI water by 4 times (e.g., from 1 L to 4 L). Adjust the pH to 4.5 with 2N HC1. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10 min. Collect the precipitate.<br>
4.	Redissolve the precipitate from step 5 into DI water and adjust the pH to 7.5 with 2N NaOH.<br>
5.	Spray drying the neutralized protein mixture at inlet temperature = 200°C, outlet temperature = 90-95°C.<br>
In one study, the total protein contents of the samples were, OBAP(-) (94.8%), OBAP(+) (91.8%) and control (68%) (Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC, 16th Edition, 1995, 990.02, Locator #4.2.08). The yield of HMF from each fraction was determined. Results demonstrated that no HMF was yielded from the OBAP(-) sample (see Table 5). This study indicated the importance of OBAP and/or the importance of the phospholipids, isoflavones and saponins associated with this fraction in obtaining HMF, even though oil body associated proteins do not make up a large portion of the HMF.<br>
In the same study, the trypsin inhibitor activities of the OBAP(-), OBAP(+), and control soy protein isolates were 24, 31.5 and 47.5 TIU/mg, respectively (using a standard AACC method, 1995, 9th edition, method 71-10). These activities do not correlate with the yield of HMF from the samples; thus, eliminating the likelihood that the lack of trypsin inhibitor activity in OBAP(-) isolates caused the lack of HMF formation.<br>
The chymotrypsin inhibitor activities of soy protein samples also did not correlate with the yield of HMF from the samples (Table 5) (AACC, 10th edition, method 22-40).<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
Other soybean fractions were also obtained (glycinin, beta-conglycinin, intermediate) prepared at Iowa State University's pilot plant (15 kg pilot plant process #2; Wu et al, 1999). The amount of oleosin in these samples was also determined by Western blotting using an oleosin antibody (See FIG. 12). Again, it was demonstrated that the samples with higher amounts of oleosin produced much higher yields of HMF (Table 6).<br>
Samples of pepsin digested SPI (OB AP and control), undigested SPI samples (control, OBAP(-), OBAP(+)), the oil body protein preparation, and a ground soy sample of control soybean IA-2032 were resolved on 18% Tris/glycine gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes. These blots were probed with antisera to oleosin (FIG. 13). This antisera was developed in rabbit using full length oleosin protein that was overexpressed in and purified from E. coli as described in QIAexpressionist (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). These blots illustrated that the samples with higher amounts of oleosin produced much higher yields of HMF (Table 6).<br>
Example 5<br>
Effect of extraction with ethanol on HMF yield<br>
To see what extent the high yield of the intermediate fraction came from phospholipids, saponins and isoflavones, these components were extracted from the fraction using 70% ethanol and the fraction was retested for HMF yield. The result was a 50% lower yield. Addition of the extracted fraction to a low yielding fraction (glycinin) helped to improve the yield of HMF of that fraction (80%). These results (see Table 6) suggest that the ability of the HMF polypeptides to resist digestion by proteases may depend in-part on the presence of alcohol extractable components such as saponins, isoflavones and phospholipids. Result from previous examples are also included in Table 6 along with summary explanations. The conclusion from this summary was that oleosins, beta-conglycinins, alcohol extractables (phospholipids, saponins, isoflavones), and basic glycinin subunits contribute to a high yield of HMF which can function as a cholesterol-lowering material. The most important component is lipoprotein (oleosin and associated phospholipid). It is conceived that the cholesterol-lowering properties of a soy protein ingredient containing beta-conglycinins and glycinins can be enhanced by adding<br>
lipoproteins from plants (e.g., oleosins with associated phospholipids) or other sources (e.g. egg yolk lipoproteins).<br>
