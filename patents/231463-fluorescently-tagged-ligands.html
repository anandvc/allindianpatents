				<td>FLUORESCENTLY TAGGED LIGANDS<br>
The present invention relates to a library of tagged non-peptide ligands comprising<br>
one or a plurality of ligand moietie"s each linked to one or a plurality of different tag<br>
moieties; a process for the preparation thereof; a method for the rational design of a<br>
library and selection from the library of a tagged ligand; a kit comprising reactive<br>
non-peptide ligand(s) and reactive tagging substrate(s) for the preparation of the<br>
library of tagged non-peptide ligands; tagged non-peptide ligands associated with<br>
information on their pharmacology; novel tagged Ligands; novel ligand precursors<br>
and processes for the preparation thereof; the use of known and novel tagged ligands<br>
and libraries of tagged ligands in studying receptor binding such as G-protein<br>
coupled receptor (GPCR) binding or intracellular enzyme inhibition such as cyclic<br>
nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition and binding of drugs to drug transporters (eg<br>
nucleoside transporters or ATP binding gassette transporters); more specifically<br>
studying these interactions in cell populations or single cells such as acutely<br>
dispersed cells using techniques such as Confocal Microscopy and Fluorescence<br>
Activated Sorting and Fluorescence Correlation Microscopy.<br>
The adenosine-A1 receptor (A1-AR) is a GPCR which is found in a variety of tissues<br>
incfading brain heart, adipose tissue and muscle, and has been implicated in the<br>
pathophysiology of a number of conditions (Ralevic, V. and Bumstock, J (199S)<br>
Pharmacol. Rev. 50, 415).<br>
Currently the study of Ai-AR pharmacology can only be performed well in cells<br>
which can be grown in large numbers using for enample techniques such as<br>
radioligand binding. Autoradiography enables single cell studies but does not allow-<br>
direct reading of binding and can take up to 4 - 6 weeks to develop the film to obtain<br>
results of binding. To overcome this problem, a very few fluorescent ligands have<br>
been adapted for use in visualising receptors and obtaining quantitative receptor-<br>
ligand binding data in single cells, using confocal microscopy (CSLM), confocal<br>
plate readers, fluorescence polarisation plate readers, and fluorescence correlation<br>
spectroscopy (PCS). Confocal microscopy allows visualisation of a section through a<br>
cell, concentration of fluorophore at the cell edges indicates membrane receptor<br>
binding. FCS analyses the diffusion characteristics of fluorescent species, fast-<br>
diffusing free ligand can be distinguished from slowly-diffusing receptor-bound<br>
ligand and quantified simultaneously when the volume is localised to the cell<br>
membrane.<br>
McGrath et al TiPS November 1996 (Vol 17) 393 - 399 reviews the possibilities for<br>
using fluorescent ligands in place of more traditional radioactive ligands in the study<br>
of cell receptors to report the amount of ligand-receptor complex indicating the<br>
number of receptors, using confocal spectroscopy and fluorescence activated cell<br>
sorting (FACS). He states that many attempts have been made at conjugating<br>
fluorescent molecules to receptor ligands in the hope of identifying their binding<br>
sites, aimed mainly at localisation of the receptors rather than studying their<br>
properties. Some compounds are reported that fluoresce when bound to a receptor<br>
but which give low background noise in the aqueous phase. A reported objective was<br>
to produce a fluorescent drug which would remain fluorescent when bound to the<br>
receptor and would remain bound when unbound drug was washed away. Therefore<br><br>
there was a need for very high receptor binding affinity. Reviewed work includes<br>
fluorescent ligand binding to nicotinic receptors, beta adrenoceptors, opioid GPCR<br>
type receptors, histamine, neurotensin and alpha-adrenoceptors. The publication also<br>
reviews benefits of confocal microscopy. Efforts made to study the pharmacological<br>
properties of the ligands axe reported in only a few of the above cases.<br>
However very few efforts to visualise receptors or classes of receptors have been<br>
shown to work. Pharmacological properties are usually to some extent affected by<br>
linking of a fluorophore to any receptor binding ligand, and include change in<br>
binding affinity, and in activation or otherwise of receptor, ie agonist or antagonist<br>
properties. It is important that the pharmacology of the fluorescent ligand is known<br>
in any studies in order to quantify the binding results observed.<br>
In fact the synthesis of non-peptide fluorescent ligands for GPCRs presents serious<br>
problems. The few commercial non peptide fluorescent ligands for cell surface<br>
receptors that have been synthesised include histamine-BODEPY ™ FL and (pictured<br>
below) CGP12177-BODIPY ™ TMR (Molecular Probes):<br>
The BODfPY ™ (BDI) fluorophores were initially designed for attaching to proteins<br>
which present a much more uniform prospect for attaching: kits are available<br>
comprising a fluorophore and a set of reagents for universally attaching to most<br><br><br><br><br>
proteins. These give non specific attachments to any reactive site on the protein of<br>
interest and usually there is no need to know the nature or location of the attachment.<br>
However these proteins are larger molecules than the non-peptide ligands, including<br>
drugs such as XAC (xanthine 3mine congener) etc envisaged in the present<br>
invention. The ligand binding site for the many GPCR receptors is also usually deep<br>
within the transmembrane regions of the receptor and thus the challenge is to attach<br>
to the fluorophore in such a way as to retain pharmacological activity. None of these<br>
BDI fluorophores are concerned with the specific design of fluorescent<br>
agonists/antagonists with defined properties at GPCR's but rather with the<br>
fluorophore as an "add-on" probe.<br>
In summary therefore the availability of fluorescent ligands and in particular non-<br>
peptide fluorescent ligands suitable for FCS and CM binding studies is virtually non-<br>
existent. The preparation of such compounds is far from routine and few efforts have<br>
been made to establish pharmacology. McGrath above only looked at a few of the<br>
receptor types studied.<br><br>
There is moreover no unified approach in much of the prior art. Individual research<br>
has addressed fluorescent Ligand systems which are limited to specific drug classes<br>
and or to the use of specific fluorophores. Such systems are limiting in both the<br>
information which can be obtained and in the number of systems which can be<br>
investigated.<br>
Accordingly there is a need for novel selective fluorescent ligands for binding at<br>
desired receptors giving reliable and effective receptor visualisation and receptor<br>
selectivity with established pharmacology in terms of both affinity and agonist and<br>
antagonist properties.<br>
We have now applied a multidisciplinary approach to fluorescent ligand design to<br>
provide a library of rationally designed fluorescently tagged ligands and a process for<br>
preparation thereof that may be used in a method for selection of a fluorescently<br>
tagged ligand which is selective to a desired GPCR, having required defined<br>
pharmacological characteristics.<br>
The library is obtained from preferably non-peptide ligand precursors comprising<br>
chemical functionality for linking to any fluorophore to provide known or novel<br>
fluorescent ligands with linking at a desired site enabling selection of a fluorescent<br>
ligand providing retention of receptor binding capability and linking in manner not to<br>
interfere with receptor binding capability, or to modify binding capability in known<br>
manner. The linker precursors may also provide improved properties such as water<br>
solubility, on linking to a fluorescent moiety or any other desired non-hydrophilic<br>
probe.<br>
In the broadest aspect of the invention there is provided a library comprising a<br>
plurality of tagged non-peptide ligands of formula I<br><br>
including salts thereof<br>
comprising one or a plurality of same or different ligand moieties Lig each linked to<br>
a one or a plurality of same or different tag moieties Tag via same or different linker<br>
moieties L and same or different linking site or linking functionality JT and JL<br>
wherein Lig comprises a GPCR ligand, an inhibitor of an intracellular enzyme or a<br>
substrate or inhibitor of a drug transporter,<br>
L	is a single bond or is any linking moiety selected from a heteroatom<br>
such as N, O, S, P, branched or straight chain saturated or unsaturated,<br>
optionally heteroatom containing, C1-600 hydrocarbyl and<br>
combinations thereof, which may be monomelic, oligomeric having<br>
oligomeric repeat of 2 to 30 or polymeric having polymeric repeat in<br>
excess of 30 up to 300;<br>
Tag	is any known or novel tagging substrate;<br>
m	are each independently selected from a whole number integer from 1<br>
to 3;<br>
p	is 0 to 3<br><br>
characterised in that linking is at same or different linking sites in compounds<br>
comprising different Lig, JL, L JT and/or - Tag and is at different linking sites in<br>
compounds comprising same Lig, JL, L JT and/or - Tag.<br>
Preferably the library does not comprise as Lig NECA, as Tag dansylamide or NBD,<br>
as each J a single bond and as L a methylene chain of C3-12.<br>
The innovation of the present invention relates to the design of specifically tagged<br>
ligands or "drugs" eg fluorescent ligands or "drugs" with known or selectable<br>
pharmacological properties. A key to this success is that each tag or fluorophore has<br>
a specific influence on the pharmacology of the resulting product, and it is incorrect<br>
to assume that the compound will retain the properties of the precursor drug.<br>
Preferably the library is constructed by the rational design of library members<br>
representing modifications in linking sites and ligand moieties, which can be used as<br>
a basis for selection of a tagged or fluorescent ligand retaining the properties of the<br>
precursor ligand. Preferably the library comprises a plurality of defined and well<br>
characterized tagged ligands, having verified properties corresponding to those of the<br>
non-tagged ligand.<br>
A GPCR ligand may be selected from any compound which is effective as an agonist<br>
or antagonist for an adenosine receptor, a beta-adrenoceptor, a muscarinic receptor, a<br>
histamine receptor, an opiate receptor, a cannabinoid receptor, a chemokine receptor,<br>
an alpha-adrenoceptor, a GAB A receptor, a prostanoid receptor, a 5-HT (serotonin)<br>
receptor, an excitatory aminoacid receptor (e.g. glutamate). a dopamine receptor, a<br>
protease-activating receptor, a neurokinin receptor, an angiotensin receptor, an<br>
oxytocin receptor, a leukotriene receptor, a nucleotide receptor (purines and<br>
pyrimidines), a calcium-sensing receptor, a thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, a<br>
neurotensin receptor, a vasopressin receptor, an olfactory" receptor, a nucleobase<br>
receptor (e.g. adenosine), a lysophosphatidic acid receptor, a sphingolipid receptor, a<br>
tyramine receptor (trace amines), a free-fatty acid receptor and a cyclic nucleotide<br>
receptor or the like, preferably for a GPCR receptor for example a) an adenosine<br>
receptor antagonist b) an adenosine receptor agonist c) a beta-adrenoceptor agonist<br>
and d) a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. Preferably a ligand is a non-peptide ligand.<br>
An inhibitor of intracellular enzymes is preferably e) an inhibitor of an intracellular<br>
enzyme such as an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases; or a derivative<br>
or analogue mereof.<br>
A substrate of a drug transporter is any drug that is transported into or out of the cell<br>
via the transporter. An inhibitor of a drug transporter is any compound which binds<br>
to the transporter and prevents a substrate being transported. Thus, a tagged inhibitor<br>
can be used to bind to the transporter and localise it. A tagged substrate of the<br>
invention could be used to follow transport into or out of the cell and to test whether<br>
inhibitor drugs can prevent the transport of the tagged substrate. A substrate or<br>
inhibitor is preferably selected from a substrate or inhibitor of any equilibrium based<br>
drug transporters or ATP driven pumps such as a catecholamine transporter, a<br>
nucleoside transporter, an ATP-binding cassette transporter, a cyclic nucleotide<br>
transporter or the like.<br><br>
Preferably the library provides tagged ligands which are suited for surface cell<br>
receptor binding or for intracellular binding, or for penetrating or exiting live cells.<br>
Accordingly the library represents the rational design of compounds which are<br>
predicted to have retained pharmacology and properties suitable for specific binding<br>
applications.<br>
Each Tag may be independently selected from any entity which is known in the art of<br>
tagging molecules to form a marker or reporter group for detecting molecules and<br>
which may be used in analytical studies relating to the ligand, particularly for<br>
visualisation, and includes but is not limited to fluorophore tags as known in the art.<br>
An additional Tag may be present and may perform a function in situ, eg may be any<br>
laser activated Tag which is activated to have a local or targetted therapeutic or<br>
destructive effect. This allows in a first stage visualising the compound of formula I<br>
by means of a visualisation Tag, in a second stage activation of laser activated Tag,<br>
and optionally in a third stage visualising the compound of formula I or fragments<br>
thereof. For example a laser activated Tag may comprise malachite green which may<br>
be activated for targetted protein destruction.<br>
In a particular advantage, in the case that Tag is a chemical entity which might be<br>
anticipated to inhibit receptor ligand binding or to inhibit intracellular enzyme or<br>
drug transporter inhibition in or by a compound of formula I such inhibition is<br>
negated or dispelled by the presence of group L and/or of each J or by the chosen site<br>
of linking in one or more library members.<br>
Preferably one or more of each -Tag in one or more or each library compound is an<br>
entity -Fl and comprises any known or novel fluorophore, whereby the library<br>
comprises compounds of which one or more or all of which are of formula V<br>
(LigJL)m L (JT Fl)m (JT L (JLLig)m)p<br>
Preferably each compound of formula I or I' comprises one of a plurality of<br>
fluorophores and/or tags providing a library of differently fluorescently tagged<br>
ligands comprising one or a number of different fluorophores (preferably of different<br>
chemical composition, spectral characteristics etc); and/or providing a library of<br>
differently tagged ligands including at least one fluorescently tagged ligand;<br>
alternatively each compound of formula I or V comprises one of a plurality of<br>
precursor ligands Linked each to one or a plurality of different tags providing a<br>
library of same or differently tagged ligands of plural ligand type; alternatively each<br>
compound of formula I comprises one of a plurality of linkers linking a precursor<br>
ligand and at least one Tag at the same or different linking site; alternatively each<br>
compound of formula I comprises the same linker linking a precursor ligand and at<br>
least one Tag at different linking sites providing a Library of differently linked tagged<br>
ligands of different conformation or anticipated pharmacology and binding.<br>
In each case the library of the invention provides for the selection of a tagged ligand<br>
of desired binding affinity inhibition or transport at a desired receptor, intracellular<br>
enzyme or at or by a drug transporter with desired pharmacology, visualisation,<br>
mechanism or the like.<br><br><br>
wherein each JL and JT comprises J as hereinbefore defined and may be same or<br>
different and may derive from functionality originally present in Lig or L and Tag or<br>
L or a combination thereof, characterised in that linking is at same or different<br>
linking sites in compounds comprising different Lig, JL, L, JT and/or Tag, and is at<br>
different linking sites in the case of any two or more compounds comprising identical<br>
Lig, JL, L, JT and/or Tag.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the invention comprises a library of compounds of<br>
formula I as hereinbefore defined wherein Lig, JL, L, JT and Tag are the same in all<br>
compounds, and wherein the compounds differ by site of linking thereof.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the invention comprises a library of compounds of<br>
formula I or F as hereinbefore defined wherein Lig and JL are the same in all<br>
compounds and L and JT are the same or similar in all compounds and Tag is<br>
different in some or all compounds.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the invention comprises a library of compounds of<br>
formula I or F as hereinbefore defined wherein Lig- and -Tag are the same in all<br>
compounds and -L- is different in all compounds.<br>
The library may comprise from 3 to 250 tagged ligands. Preferably the library<br>
comprises from 1 to 10 families comprising 3 to 25 tagged ligands each family<br>
comprising a ligand moiety of a common ligand type and from 3 to 25 different tag<br>
moiety types at least one of which is a fluorescent tag, more preferably each of which<br>
is a different fluorescent tag; or the library comprises from 5 to 250 fluorescently<br>
tagged ligands of different ligand type and different fluorophore type.<br>
A library providing fluorescent ligands comprising different F1 is useful to enable<br>
studying binding, inhibition or transport with different colour fluorescence for<br>
example to distinguish from same colour native fluorescence or to distinguish plural<br>
types of binding site, enzyme, transporter or the like.<br>
It is known that ligands modified ie by linking to a fluorophore typically undergo a<br>
change in binding affinity, inhibition or transport and suitably the library of the<br>
invention comprises characterisation of the pharmacology of each compound<br>
including binding affinity or inhibition or transport for certain GPCRs, intracellular<br>
enzymes or drug transporters. Preferably the library includes information for each<br><br>
tagged ligand comprised in the library, relating to the pharmacology for binding to or<br>
inhibition of a GPCR receptor or to inhibition of an intracellular enzyme such as<br>
cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, or inhibition of or transport by a drug<br>
transporter including designation as agonist, antagonist, substrate or inhibitor and<br>
measure of affinity or inhibition etc, enabling quantification of results.<br>
In the prior art methods of preparing ligands the linking sites have in many cases<br>
been non-specific or unknown, as in the case of Molecular Probes ligands, or at best<br>
have been specific or known but not predetermined, designed or rationalised for a<br>
desired effect. Preferably in the library of the invention tagged ligands comprise<br>
fluorophores linked at any of a number of linking sites at which ligand receptor<br>
binding, inhibition or transport is maintained to a greater extent or is modified or<br>
inhibited to a lesser extent. Preferably the library comprises tagged ligands designed<br>
from reaction of reactive precursor ligand(s) and reactive fluorophores having<br>
reactive site chemical functionality and suited for reaction with associated reagents,<br>
for site specific reaction and linking, wherein the design is the result of extensive<br>
investigation of all or many of the possible linking sites and the resulting<br>
pharmacological characteristics and selection of one or more linking combinations<br>
which provide favorable binding, inhibition or transport characteristics.<br>
Preferably Lig is selected from<br>
a)	xanthine like structures including XAC, theophylline, caffeine, theobromine.<br>
dyphilline, enprofylline and the like; or fused biaryl structures including papaverine.<br>
dihydroquinilones such as cilostamide, dipyridamole, vinpocetine and the like: and<br>
analogues thereof;<br>
b)	adenosine like structures including AD AC, NECA and analogues thereof:<br>
c)	ethanolamine like structures including Salmeterol, salbutamol, terbutaline.<br>
quinprenaline, lobetalol. sotalol, bombuterol, fenoterol. roprotolol, tulobuterol.<br>
clenbuterol and analogues thereof;<br>
d)	oxypropanolamine like structures including CGP12177, propranolol,<br>
practolol, acebutalol, betaxolol, ICI 11S551, alprenolol, celiprolol (celectol),<br>
metoprolol (betaloc), CGP20712A, atenolol, bisoprolol, misaprolol, carvedilol,<br>
bucindolol, esmolol, nadolol, nebivolol, oxprenoiol. xamoterol, pindolol, timolol and<br>
analogues thereof;<br>
e)	xanthine like structures including XAC, theophylline, caffeine, theobromine,<br>
dyphilline, enprofylline, sildenafil, EHNA (erythro-9-(2-hydroxyl-3-nonyl)adenine),<br>
zaprinast and the like; or spiro bicyclic structures including bypyridines such as<br>
amrinone, imidazolines such as CI930, dihydropyridazinones such as indolan,<br>
rolipram, SB207499, and the like; or fused biaryl structures including papaverine,<br>
dihydroquinilones such as cilostamide, dipyridamole, vinpocetine and the like and<br>
analogues thereof.<br>
Linker L may perform a number of functions including preventing loss of affinity of<br>
a ligand when modified to comprise a fluorescent moiety, by distancing the<br>
fluorophore moiety from the ligand structure, in cases that modifying by direct<br>
linking of Lig and F1 would interfere with ligand binding, inhibition or transport in<br>
which case a linker L may be designed as a short, medium or long chain structure as<br>
appropriate.<br><br>
A library compound of formula I or I' may optionally comprise functionality J as<br>
hereinbefore defined derived from its synthesis by the reaction of one or more<br>
reactive group(s) of a linker precursor or its components, providing a linker moiety,<br>
with a reactive group of one or more ligand precursors providing a ligand moiety and<br>
reaction of one or more other reactive group(s) of the linker precursor with a reactive<br>
group of one or more tag precursors such as a fluorescent tag precursor providing a<br>
tag moiety.<br>
In a particular advantage of the present invention linker L and/or linking site or<br>
functionality J facilitates linking of fluorescent moiety and ligand, in cases that<br>
groups of respective moieties are not reactive, or that stereochemistry or other effects<br>
would inhibit linking, or that reaction of existing reactive groups in commercially<br>
available precursor ligands and fluorophores would require the inclusion of<br>
protecting groups for functionalities present therein, in which case a linker is usually<br>
derived from a short, medium or long chain structure. In a further advantage linker -<br>
L- may be derived from a tri-, terra-, penta- or hexa-functional precursor, linking 3 or<br>
more ligands Lig and tags F1, enabling modified or more complex binding, inhibition<br>
or transport and associated pharmacology, for example binding to a plurality of<br>
receptor sites to explore receptor dimerisation such as homo or heterodimerisation. In<br>
a further advantage of the invention linker L may confer properties facilitating<br>
crossing the cell membrane, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and the like as required,<br>
in which case a linker is usuolly any functionalised structure.<br>
Preferably L is selected from a saturated or unsaturated single or double bond, -O-, -<br>
S-, amine, COO-, amide, -NN- hydrazine; and saturated or unsaturated, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted C1-600, preferably C1-300, more preferably C1-100 branched or straight<br>
chain aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic and combinations thereof, any of which may<br>
comprise one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O, S, P, wherein optional<br>
substituents are selected from any C1-20 aliphatic, aromatic or alicyclic substituents<br>
any of which may comprise one or more heteroatoms as hereinbefore defined,<br>
hydroxy, thiol, halo, amine, hydrazine, oxo, cyano, carbonvl and the like..<br>
More preferably L is selected from a single bond, -O-S-, amino; and branched or<br>
straight chain C1-50 alkyl. alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxyjamino, cycloalky/, heterocyclic,<br>

aralkylamido and the like, optionally comprising one or more heteroatoms wherein<br>
heteroatoms are as hereinbefore defined, optionally substiruted as hereinbefore<br>
defined wherein substituents are selected from C1-12 aliphatic, aromatic or alicyclic<br>
substituents as defined, hydroxy, thiol, halo, amine, oxo, carbonyl, and the like.<br>

In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a kit comprising ligand<br>
precursors, linker precursors and tag precursors of formulae IV, IV', V, V and/or VI<br>
as hereinbefore defined for preparing a library of compounds of formula I as<br>
hereinbefore defined.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a fluorescent ligand of<br>
formula I or I' as hereinbefore defined or library thereof for visualising receptors or<br><br>
receptor binding, assessing pharmacological properties of the fluorescent ligand, in<br>
high throughput screening of novel chemical entities that bind to the target receptor,<br>
in inhibiting an intracellular enzyme or inhibiting a drug transporter or a substrate of<br>
a drug transporter, in studying drug transport or drugs suitable for transport, in<br>
distinguishing healthy or diseased tissue and the like. Preferably the use comprises<br>
using any fluorescence detection technique more preferably confocal microscopy or<br>
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Preferably the use allows to calculate ligand<br>
affinity constants and concentration of sub-populations of a receptor type,<br>
intracellular enzyme or drug transporter as hereinbefore defined.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for receptor binding or<br>
inhibition, intracellular enzyme inhibition or drug transport or inhibition and<br>
visualisation comprising contacting a fluorescent ligand as hereinbefore defined with<br>
a sample in manner to facilitate binding or inhibition thereof or transport thereby,<br>
and detecting changes in fluorescence or location thereof.<br>
A sample may comprise cell material, selected from cells, cell extracts, cell<br>
homogenates, purified or reconstituted proteins, recombinant proteins or synthesised<br>
proteins and the like, and includes a target for the compound of formula I. Samples<br>
comprising cell material may be derived from plants, animals, fungi, protists,<br>
bacteria, archae or cell lines derived from such organisms. Animal or plant cells used<br>
to prepare the sample may be healthy or disfunctional and are optionally used in the<br>
diagnosis of a disease such as leukaemia or cancer. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention the sample comprises mammalian cells, extracts and homogenates thereof.<br>
Preferably a sample comprises live cell material, more preferably including<br>
individual cells or sub cell compartments, most preferably comprising GPCRs,<br>
intracellular enzymes or drug transporters in living cells, membrane containing these<br>
proteins, solubilised receptors, enzymes or drug transporters or GPCR arrays. Cell<br>
material may be obtained in known manner by culturing cells or by expressing<br>
proteins in cells.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the cell material is a cell expressing a GPCR, enzyme or<br>
drug transporter. GPCR's are possibly the single most important class of targets for<br>
current and prospective drug therapies.<br>
More preferably the sample comprises GPCR receptors selected from adenosine A1 -<br>
, A2A-, A2B- and A3-receptors, β1. β2 and β3 adrenoceptors, or comprises inhibitors<br>
of intracellular enzymes such as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, most<br>
preferably CHO-cells expressing human adenosine A1 -receptor or beta-adrenoceptor<br>
or an inhibitor of an intracellular enzyme such as an inhibitor of intracellular<br>
phosphodiesterases.<br>
Cell material may be tagged prior to contact with the fluorescent ligand, for example<br>
by tagging with GFP, for example GFP tagged GPCR's, GFP tagged intracellular<br>
enzymes and GFP tagged drug transporters, or a native receptor, intracellular enzyme<br>
or a drug transporter to which a fluorescent antibody has been targetted, to allow<br><br>
visualising of the cell receptors, enzymes or transporters, and overlay with the<br>
fluorescent ligands.<br>
Receptors may be provided in membrane samples or in acutely dispersed cell<br>
samples, for example endogenous receptors such as A1-AR in acutely dispersed cells.<br>
The adenosine receptor binding site is located deep within the pocket of the receptor,<br>
whereby a fluorescent ligand with linker is a preferred fluorescent (ant)agonist.<br>
Whilst there is considerable freedom in modifying the ligand and retaining antagonist<br>
binding activity, it is harder to retain agonist activating activity, ie activating the<br>
receptors functions on binding.<br>
The method for drug transport of a substrate of a drug transporter would be to follow<br>
the uptake of the compound of formula I into the cell cytosol (if the transporter<br>
moves the drug into cells) OR after loading the cells with substrate to follow the<br>
dissappearance of the compound of formula I from the cells and its appearance in the<br>
extracellular medium (if the transporter moves the drug out of the cells - for example<br>
in the case that the transporter is an ATP-driven pump). Preferably the method<br>
comprises monitoring transport of a drug into a cell via an equilibrium transporter<br>
that moves the compound into the cell - then applying an inhibitor of this first<br>
equilibrium transporter, and monitoring the export of the drug from the cells via an<br>
ATP-driven pump transporter.<br>
The method of inhibition of a drug transporter may be monitored by detecting<br>
binding to the transporter on the cell surface.<br>
Preferably the method including detecting a change in fluorescence includes<br>
detecting a change in the intensity, excitation or emission wavelength distribution of<br>
fluorescence (single and multi photon), fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence<br>
polarisation or a combination thereof or the like. The optical response is detected by<br>
known means such as cameras, film, laser-scanning devices, fiuorometers,<br>
photodiodes, quantum counters, microplate, microscopes, fluorescent microscopes<br>
such as epifluorescence or confocal, cytometers, readers and the like, preferably<br>
CSLM, confocal plate readers, fluorescence polarisation plate readers or FCS. Where<br>
the sample is examined using a flow cytometer, examination of the sample optionally<br>
includes sorting components of the sample according to their fluorescence response.<br>
A method for binding or inhibition or detection according to the invention may be in<br>
vitro or in vivo.<br>
In a particular advantage of the invention the novel fluorescent ligands are suitable<br>
for use in combination with FCS enabling the study of ligand-receptor binding at the<br>
single molecule level. Because of the nature of the events being monitored FCS is<br>
ideal for the study of thermodynamic and kinetic features of molecular interactions in<br>
solution. Another particular advantage of the invention is that the FCS approach can<br>
be adapted to monitor ligand-receptor binding at the single molecule level using<br>
photon counting fluorescence intensity measurements. This removes any requirement<br>
for the molecules to be moving within the confocal volume.<br><br>
With ligands showing low background fluorescence it is not necessary to remove<br>
unbound ligand by washing before performing either confocal microscopy or FCS. It<br>
is therefore possible to measure fluorescence with time, in both time and<br>
concentration dependent manner.<br>
Confocal microscopy (CSLM) allows visualisation of a section through a cell<br>
showing concentration of fluorophore at the cell edges indicating membrane receptor<br>
binding. Visualisation is of a particular plane of focus such that a "slice" through an<br>
individual cell may be observed, as known in the art. Different coloured channels<br>
may be selected to visualise different fluorophore types.<br>
FCS is a non-invasive technique which analyses the diffusion characteristics of<br>
fluorescent species through a very small excitation volume (
analysing the partem of their photon emissions. Thus fast-diffusing free ligand can be<br>
distinguished from slowly-diffusing receptor-bound ligand and quantified<br>
simultaneously when the volume is localised to the cell membrane. Preferably the<br>
method incorporating FCS comprises measuring fluctuations in fluorescence<br>
intensity in a confocal volume of 
gives information about the speed of diffusion (i.e. mass) and concentration of the<br>
fluorescent molecules present. Thus free ligand (fast diffusing) and bound ligand<br>
(slow diffusing) can be quantified simultaneously on a single cell.<br>
FCS (fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) correlates fluctuations in fluorescence<br>
emission of particles to parometers such as particle mass and concentration for the<br>
study of molecular interactions in solution. FCS essentially monitors spontaneous<br>
fluorescence intensity fluctuations of fluorescently tagged molecules in a<br>
microscopic detection volume (10"l5l) through analysis by a tightly focused laser<br>
beam.<br>
These fluctuations provide information on the rate of diffusion or diffusion time of a<br>
particle which is directly dependent on the mass of the given molecule. When small<br>
and therefore rapidly diffusing molecules pass through the path of the laser they<br>
produce rapidly fluctuating fluorescence intensity patterns, whereas when larger<br>
molecules pass through the beam they produce bursts of fluorescence that are more<br>
sustained. Consequently the increase in the mass of a biomolecule, eg as a result of<br>
ligand binding, is detected as an increase in the diffusion time of the resultant<br>
biomolecule.<br>
Fluorescence microscopy may be used to localise receptors at single cell or sub<br>
cellular level with sensitivity and speed. In this way high affinity tagged ligands<br>
could help to elucidate molecular characteristics of GPCR receptor subtypes, such as<br>
adenosine and the like receptors, their regional distribution and cellular localisation.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a fluorescent target<br>
for the fluorescent ligand, for example, a Green Fluorescent Protein-tagged receptor,<br>
intracellular enzyme or drug transporter. In this case the spectral characteristics of<br>
the fluorescent ligand are chosen to allow separate detection of the location of both<br>
the fluorescent ligand and the fluorescent receptor, intracellular enzyme or drug<br><br>
transporter. Cross-correlation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or fluorescence<br>
intensity measurements will then, allow the quantitative analysis of ligand-receptor,<br>
ligand-enzyme, ligand-drug transporter or drug transport interactions in a single<br>
measurement. This is distinct from prior art methods involving GFP-protein<br>
translocation assays and assays involving fluorescence energy transfer (FRET).<br>
Figure 1 exemplifies this approach.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a cell surface GPCR modified<br>
on its N-terminus or a naturally occurring domain to express a short epitope tag for a<br>
commercially available antibody (e.g. myc, haemaglutinin, FLAG). This is then<br>
expressed in CHO cells and a fluorescent antibody to the tag sequence is used in<br>
living cells to provide two-colour analysis of fluorescent ligand-receptor interactions<br>
as described for GFP-tagged proteins above.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided CHO cells expressing a cell<br>
surface GPCR modified as claimed in Claim 37 for use with a fluorescent antibody<br>
to the tag sequence is used in living cells to provide two-colour analysis of<br>
fluorescent ligand-receptor interactions as described for GFP-tagged proteins above.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a kit comprising a compound of<br>
formula I or I' as hereinbefore defined and a target therefore provided as a cell line,<br>
membrane derived from such a cell line or protein solubilised from that cell line. The<br>
cell derived material may be provided in one of three forms: (1) from cells<br>
expressing a green fluorescent protein tagged receptor, intracellular enzyme or drug<br>
transporter; (2) from cells expressing an epitope tag for a commercially available<br>
fluorescent antibody or (3) a wild-type protein for which, a specific fluorescent<br>
antibody is also provided.<br>
In an alternative embodiment there is provided a kit comprising a compound of<br>
formula I or I' as hereinbefore defined and a fluorescent antibody to a native protein<br>
which can be used in native (non-recombinant) cells.<br>
In each case, the spectral characteristics of the compound of formula I or F and<br>
fluorescent antibody or green fluorescent protein are selected to allow optimum two-<br>
colour cross-correlation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (single or<br>
multiphoton).<br>

1. Salmeterol-BODIPY 630/650 (4) and Derivative-Salmeterol-BODIPY<br>
630/650 (4a)<br>
Salmeterol is linlced to fluorophore via two different linking sites, in the following<br>
syntheses<br><br><br>
In a first approach, a linker is substituted onto the salmeterol side-chain through<br>
which the fluorophore is subsequently attached. In the second approach the native<br>
alkyl side-chain of salmeterol is replaced with a linker and fluorophore. In this case,<br>
according to the invention, retention of binding, fluorescence and activity are<br>
uncertain and must therefore be verified and information provided with the<br>
fluorescent ligand, to provide a useful compound.<br><br><br>
All of the following molecules rely upon the synthesis of the same two linker<br>
moieties as shown in Scheme 4 and described above, (where the hydrocarbon chain<br>
length can be easily varied, or altered chemically to e.g. an ethylene glycol structure<br>
to improve solubility).<br><br><br>
Example A4 -Synthesis of (3-Adrcnoceptor antagonists<br>
All of the following molecules rely upon the synthesis of the same two linker<br>
moieties as shown in Scheme 4 and described in Example A3, (where the<br>
hydrocarbon chain length can be easily varied, or altered chemically to e.g. an<br>
ethylene glycol structure to improve solubility).<br><br>
The adenosine-A1 receptor (A1-AR) is a G-protein coupled receptor which is found<br>
in a variety of tissues including brain, heart, adipose tissue and muscle. By<br>
conjugating the ArAR antagonist xanthine amine cogener (XAC) to the fluorophore<br>
BODIPY®-630/650 (BY630), we have synthesised a fluorescent A1-AR ligand,<br>
XAC-BY630, to allow visualisation of this receptor in living cells.<br><br>
[3H]DPCPX binding alongside cyclic AMP and inositol phosphate accumulation<br>
assays were performed on CHO-A1 cells expressing the human A1-receptor. Images<br>
were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope using CHO-A1 cells<br>
grown to 50% confluency on 8-well Labtek™ plates in Dulbecco's<br>
Modification of Eagle's Medium:Ham's F12 containing 5% foetal calf serum and<br>
2mM glutamine. Cells were washed twice with HEPES-buffered saline prior to<br>
incubation at 22°C with compounds as indicated.<br>
Spectroscopic analysis of XAC-BY630 and BY630 itself showed that their peak<br>
excitation (630, 632nm, respectively) and emission wavelengths (650, 653nm) were<br>
not substantially different. [3H]DPCPX binding studies on CHO-A1 cell membranes<br>
showed that XAC-BY630 had a lower affinity for the A1AR than XAC<br>
(pKj=7.79±0.13 and 6.S2±0.11, XAC and XAC-BY630, respectively,<br>
mean±s.e.mean, n=4). XAC-BY630 also behaved as a competitive ApAR<br>
antagonist at both 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine-mediated inhibition of cAMP<br>
production (apparent pKB=6.9S±0.15 vs. S.06+0.24 for XAC. n=3) and stimulation<br>
of inositol phosphate production (apparent pKB=6.26±0.20 vs. 7.46±0.0S for XAC,<br>
n=4). Confocal imaging showed that XAC-BY630 bound to membrane-localised<br>
ApARs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Binding of XAC-BY630<br>
(25-250nM) v/as detected after 5 min, and was predominantly located at the<br>
membrane after a 30 min. incubation. Membrane binding of XAC-BY630 was<br>
receptor-specific, since a 30 min pre-incubation with DPCPX (10"8-10"°IvO caused a<br>
concentration-dependent inhibition of membrane binding (30 min, 50nlvl).<br>
These studies indicate that XAC-BY630 is a functional ApAR antagonist with<br>
moderate affinity which could be used to visualise the A.pAR in primary tissue and<br>
cell lines.<br>
Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS).<br>
FCS is a non-invasive technique which measures fluctuations in fluorescence<br>
intensity in a confocal volume of 
gives information about the speed of diffusion (i.e. mass) and concentration of the<br>
fluorescent molecules present. Thus free ligand (fast diffusing) and bound iigand<br>
(slow diffusing) can be quantified simultaneously on a single cell. We have used<br>
FCS to measure binding of the fluorescent ligand, xanthine amine cogener-<br>
BODEPY®630/650 (XAC-BY630) to the human adenosine A, receptor (ApAR).<br>
CHO cells expressing either the human ApAR or an ApAR-Topaz fusion were<br>
cultured on glass-bottomed S-well plates and prepared for live cell measurement .<br>
FCS measurements were made using a Zeiss Confocor 2, fitted with an Axiocam<br>
CCD camera for x-y positioning. Cells were incubated with ligands at 22°C for the<br>
times indicated and the confocal volume was positioned on the upper membrane.<br>
Data were collected for 2x30s, following a 15s pre-bleach and analysed using a<br>
multi-parameter equation using Zeiss AIM software.<br><br>
Initially, the diffusion characteristics of the A1-AR-Topaz fusion protein (A1-AR-<br>
Tpz) were detennined in CHO-AlTpz cells. Autocorrelation analysis showed the<br>
diffusion time (ιD) for the ArAR was 15.0±0.9ms (meanls.e.mean, n=84). A<br>
second component (xD=118±14}is) was also seen, probably caused by an optical<br>
event within the fluorophore ('blinking"). FCS analysis of XAC-BY630 in buffer<br>
showed a single component diffusion (TD=60±2US, n=10). On the upper membrane<br>
of CHO-A1 cells incubated with XAC-BY630 (l-40nM, 10-60 min, n=71), two<br>
further slow-diffusing species were detected in addition to free ligand. The first<br>
component had a similar diffusion time (ιD1=17.4±l.lms; 69/71 cells) to that seen<br>
for ApAR-Tpz, suggesting that it is receptor-bound ligand. The second was a very<br>
slow diffusing component (ιD2=345±41ms, 61/71 cells). Following preincubation<br>
with 8-cyclopentyl-l,3-dipropyl xanthine (DPCPX) (1µ-M, 30 min), tD2 was present<br>
in 30/31 cells, suggesting this component is non-specific binding. However, the tpi<br>
component was present in only 17/31 cells. In addition, in cells exposed to 15nM<br>
XAC-BY630 for 30 min the amount of TDI component was reduced from 51.8±14.9<br>
to 13.6±5.4 receptors/urn" by DPCPX (n=8 and 4, respectively, Student's t-test,<br>
PO.05), further suggesting this component is ApAR bound ligand.<br>
We have used FCS to quantify binding to the ApAR and measure receptor diffusion<br>
in single live cells. Further development allows quantitative receptor-ligand binding<br>
of the endogenous ApAR in acutely dispersed cells.<br>
These studies indicate that XAC-BY630 is a functional ApAR antagonist with<br>
moderate affinity which could be used to visualise and measure binding to the Ap<br>
AR, in primary tissue and cell lines.<br>
Extample B2-Einding of NEC A based fluorescent A1-receptor wonists<br>
2. BY630-ABEA (3)<br>
Functional studies were performed in CHO-K1 cells expressing both the human Ap<br>
AR and a c-fos-pGL3 reporter vector (CHO-Alfos cells). Cells were incubated for<br>
24h in serum-free DMEM/F-12 media, men stimulated with agonist for 5h, in some<br>
cases following 30 min incubation with 8-cyclopentyl-l,3-dipropyLxanthine<br>
(DPCPX). Luciferase expression was quantified using a Luclite15 kit according to<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Live cell confocal imaging was carried out on CHO-A1<br>
cells or CHO cells expressing the ApAR tagged on the C-terminus with a green<br>
fluorescent protein (CHO-A1Tpz).<br>
In CHO-Alfos cells, both BY630-ABEA and the ApAR agonist N6-cyclopentyl<br>
adenosine (CPA) stimulated luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner<br>
(pEC50's of 7.0I±0.04 (n=6) and 6.76±0.1S (n=5) for CPA and BY630-ABEA,<br>
respectively, mean±s.e.mean). Stimulation was mediated by the ApAR receptor,<br>
since the concentration response curves were shifted to the right in a competitive<br>
maimer by 10nM DPCPX, yielding pKd values of 8.72±0.03 and 9.05±0.10 vs. CPA<br>
and BY630-ABEA, respectively (n=3). A higher dose of DPCPX (100nM), gave a<br>
pKd of 8.62±0.02 for CPA stimulation, but completely blocked the response to<br><br>
BY630-ABEA (n=3). For receptor visualisation, CHO-A] cells were incubated with<br>
100nM BY630-ABEA for up to 60min. Binding of ligand to the membrane was<br>
detectable after 5 min, and was substantial after 30 min (n=3). Binding was to the<br>
A1-AR, since it was substantially reduced by preincubation with DPCPX (lµM, 30<br>
min). In addition, experiments in CHO-A1Tpz cells, showed co-localisation of<br>
ligand fluorescence at the membrane with that from the fluorescently tagged A1-AR.<br>
Results are shown in Figure 1 which shows images taken from confocal microscopy<br>
imaging of a) fluorescence derived from ligand binding of a fluorescent ligand of the<br>
invention to CHO cells observed at the red channel, b) fluorescence derived from<br>
green fluorescent protein expressed by CHO cells indicating receptor locations<br>
observed via the green channel and c) overlaid images from a) and b) showing<br>
overlap of fluorescence and therefore confirming ligand binding is specific to<br>
receptors.<br>
In conclusion, we have succeeded in synthesising a novel fluorescent agonist ligand<br>
for the human A1-AR. This ligand will be useful in monitoring the localisation of the<br>
endogenous Ai-AR receptor in both acutely dispersed cells and cell lines.<br>
