				<td>PREPARATION OF MICROCAPSULES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the food and flavor industry. It concerns more<br>
particularly a complex coacervation process for the preparation of flavor-containing<br>
microcapsules which can be "Halal" certified. The process of the invention is based on the<br>
use of a type B gelatin as positively charged polymeric wall material.<br>
Background Art<br>
Coacervation also called aqueous phase separation, is a very well known technique<br>
for encapsulating hydrophobic liquids. A coacervation process allows to provide oil-<br>
containing microcapsules, the encapsulating material being a gelled hydrophilic colloid<br>
that is impervious to the oil and deposited evenly and densely about the oil as nucleus. The<br>
encapsulating material is a protein which may be complexed with another colloid having<br>
an opposite electric charge.<br>
A coacervation process essentially involves an aqueous protein solution which is<br>
manipulated by changing the physico-chemical environment (dilution and/or adjustment of<br>
pH) to result in phase separation of the protein from the solution to varying degrees<br>
depending on the molecular weight of the protein, its isoelectric point and compatibility<br>
with solvents.<br>
A coacervation process may be "simple" or "complex". The former designation is<br>
employed when a single protein is used to form a capsule wall as phase separation is taking<br>
place. The latter term designates the use of a second oppositely charged non-protein<br>
polymer to bring about phase separation. Complex coacervation method is widely<br>
practiced in commercial processes and has been well described in the literature. In<br>
particular US 2,800,457 and US 2,800,458 disclose complex coacervation in a very<br>
detailed manner.<br>
Generally, a coacervation process comprises four basic steps consisting of,<br>
respectively, emulsification, coacervation, wall formation and wall hardening. In a<br>
complex coacervation process the wall surrounding the re material is, as mentioned<br>
above, constituted of two oppositely charged high molecular weight colloids. In most of<br>
the cases, the positively charged colloid used is a gelatin, a functional protein derived from<br>
collagen by hydrolysis and subsequent extraction. There are two commercially available<br>
food/pharmaceutical grade gelatins, designated respectively as "type A gelatin" and "type<br>
B gelatin". The primary difference between the two grades, arises from the manufacturing<br>
process. If the collagen source is hydrolyzed bv an acid, the final product gets a<br>
designation "A" and if it is done by a liming (base) it is desienated "B'. From a product<br>
standpoint, the two gelatins differ primarily in their isoelectric points. Type A gelatin has<br>
an isoelectric point comprised between 8.5 to 9.0 while type B gelatin has an isoelectric<br>
point varying from 4.8 to 5.5. In a process such as coacervation that predominantly<br>
depends on the eletrokinetic stability of the system, such difference in isoelectric points<br>
can be critical for a successful encapsulation.<br>
The prior art related to complex coacervation almost always describe the use of<br>
type A gelatin as a canonic protein wall. The pH during a process involving a type A<br>
gelatin is kept to values inferior to the isoelectric point of the latter in order to have it<br>
positively charged. Some documents from the prior art mention the possibility to use also<br>
gelatin provided by basic hydrolysis (type B) as a cationic protein wall, but to our<br>
knowledge, no example has ever really described such an embodiment and it has been<br>
established that the processes disclosed in the prior art do not allow the preparation of<br>
satisfactory microcapsules when type B gelatin is used as protein wall, in. its cationic form.<br>
On the other hand, type B gelatin is sometimes mentioned in complex coacervation<br>
processes of the prior art as being used as polyanionic polymer i.e. in its electronegative<br>
form, in combination with a type A gelatin as positively charged colloid.<br>
Now, as with many food ingredients, there are some regulatory constraints on<br>
gelatin uses, from a religious/ethnic standpoint. This includes "Kosher" and "Halal" status<br>
of gelatin. Generally, type A gelatin manufacturing process uses pig skin as starting<br>
material. As a consequence the microcapsules produced from this starting product cannot<br>
receive the "Halal" or "Kosher" status. Type B gelatin, on the other hand, issued from cows<br>
or fishes, could receive either Halal or Kosher certification. However, no complex<br>
coacervation process disclosed in the prior art to date technically allows the preparation of<br>
microcapsules based on type B gelatin.<br>
Now, we have been able to establish a novel coacervation process suitable for the<br>
preparation of microcapsules based on type B gelatin as cationic wall material.<br>
Varaporn Buraphacheep Junyaprasert ct al. describe in Drug Development and<br>
Industrial Pharmacy, 27(6), 561-566 (2001), a complex coacervation process for the<br>
encapsulation of Vitamin A, which uses type B gelatin in combination with gum acacia as<br>
wall materials. However, the process parameters there-disclosed are not optimized, in<br>
particular, the drug contents of the microcapsules do not exceed 50% w/w.<br>
The process according to the present invention allows to overcome the drawbacks<br>
observed in the prior art by providing an optimized complex coacervation process suitable<br>
for the preparation of microcapsules susceptible of being "Halal" certified, and containing<br>
up to 80% w/w of hydrophobic core material.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a novel complex coacervation process, specially suitable<br>
for the preparation of high fix microcapsules encapsulating a hydrophobic core material,<br>
such microcapsules being susceptible of being incorporated into "Halal" certified foods or<br>
flavors. The process of the invention uses type B gelatin as polycationic colloid, in<br>
combination with a polyanionic material. The process parameters, such as pH, or the order<br>
of the processing steps, are critical for a successful encapsulation. More particularly, the<br>
process is characterized by the fact that the pH is adjusted before the emulsification or<br>
dispersion step, to a value between 3.0 and 4.7.<br>
The invention also relates to the microcapsules that are produced by this process.<br>
These microcapsules can be "Halal" certified and they comprise up to 30% by weight of<br>
hydrophobic core material.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for imparting, improving or modifying the<br>
organoleptic properties of a food composition, wherein microcapsules prepared by the<br>
process of the invention, are added to said composition, as well as food compositions<br>
comprising said microcapsules as an active ingredient<br>
A first object of the present invention is therefore a process for the preparation of<br>
hydrophobic core material-containing microcapsules, which process comprises, in this<br>
order, the steps of: a) mixing solutions of a positively charged high molecular weight<br>
colloid and a negatively charged high molecular weight colloid; b) adjusting the pH of the<br>
mixture obtained under a) to a value comprised between 3.0 and 4.7; c) emulsifying or<br>
dispersing a hydrophobic core material in the mixture; d) subjecting the emulsion or<br>
dispersion obtained under c) to water dilution and/or pH adjustment to achieve<br>
coacervation; e) cooling the coacervate obtained under d) to provide wall formation of<br>
microcapsules ; and f) adding a hardening agent; said process being characterized by the<br>
fact that the positively charged high molecular weight colloid is a type B gelatin.<br>
What is meant by "high molecular weight" is typically a molecular weight<br>
comprised between 40 000 and 100 000.<br>
The terms "hydrophobic core material" encompass hydrophobic liquid materials<br>
which are usually subjected to encapsulation by coacervation, as well as solids or solids<br>
suspended in a hydrophobic liquid.<br>
Although some documents from the prior art cite type B gelatin as a possible<br>
starting material for a complex coacervation process, it turned out that the disclosed<br>
processes cannot in fact allow to produce satisfactory microcapsules based on this wall<br>
forming material, unless type B gelatin is in its anionic form. Now, the process of the<br>
invention allows the preparation of very efficient delivery systems based on the use of type<br>
B gelatin in its cationic form, which systems present the advantage of containing a very<br>
high load of hydrophobic core material and on the other hand of being in accordance with<br>
religious/ethnic regulatory constraints. More objects, aspects and advantages of the<br>
invention will become apparent from the detailed description, as well, as in the example<br>
below.<br>
In the first step of the process according to the invention, soluions of, on the one<br>
hand, a positively charged high molecular weight colloid, and on the other hand, a<br>
negatively charged high molecular weight colloid, are mixed together. The process is<br>
characterized by the fact that the positively charged high molecular weight colloid is a type<br>
B gelatin. The use of type B gelatin in its cationic form is very unusual in this type of<br>
process. It implies that the pH of the solution is set to a value below its isoelectric point i.e.<br>
below 4.8-5.5.<br>
As mentioned above, type B gelatin is obtained from basic hydrolysis of a collagen<br>
source (e.g. from cow or fish). The base catalyzed hydrolysis takes several days to be<br>
completed. Details of the process are well known by a skilled person in the art.<br>
As the negatively charged colloid, any anionic polymer that reacts with the protein<br>
to form complex coacervates will suit the process of the invention. In particular gum<br>
arabic, sodium alginate, agar, carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium polyacrylate<br>
or polyphosphoric acid are suitable anionic polymers for the purpose of the invention.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the ratio between gelatin and the oppositely charged<br>
colloid is of 3 :2.<br>
Step b) of the process of the invention consists in adjusting the pH of the mixture<br>
obtained under step a) to a value comprised between 3.0 and 4.7. This can be typically<br>
achieved by means of addition of lactic acid. This step is essential in the process of the<br>
invention, in terms of specific pH values, as well as from a process stage point of view. In<br>
fact, the adjustment is operated before the addition of the hydrophobic core material,<br>
contrary to what is disclosed in the processes of the prior art, wherein the pH is usually<br>
adjusted after emulsification or dispersion step. Now, in an unexpected manner, it turned<br>
out that the adjustment of the pH to a suitable value at this particular stage of the process,<br>
is responsible for an efficient wall formation of the microcapsules.<br>
Once the pH is adjusted, a hydrophobic core material is emulsified or dispersed in<br>
the mixture. As mentioned above, this core material may consist of a hydrophobic liquid,<br>
as well as of a solid or yet a solid dispersed in a hydrophobic liquid.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the core material to be encapsulated is<br>
a liquid flavor ingredient or composition. These terms can define a variety of flavor<br>
materials of both natural and synthetic origin, currently used for the preparation of food<br>
compositions. They include single compounds or mixtures. Specific examples of such<br>
components may be found in the current literature, e.g. in Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor<br>
Ingredients, 1975, CRC Press ; Synthetic Food Adjuncts, 1947 by MB. Jacobs, edited by<br>
Van Nostrand; or Perfume and Flavor Chemicals by S. Arctander 1969, Montclair, N.J.<br>
(USA). These substances are well known to the person skilled in the art of flavoring and/or<br>
aromatizing consumer products, i.e. of imparting a flavor or taste to a consumer product<br>
traditionally flavored, or of modifying the taste of said consumer product.<br>
Natural extracts can also be encapsulated into the system of the invention; these<br>
include e.g. citrus extracts such as lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit or mandarin oils, or<br>
coffee, tea, mint, cocoa, vanilla, or essentials oils of herbs or spices, amongst other.<br>
The proportion of hydrophobic core material is comprised between 35 and 90% by<br>
weight relative to the weight of gelatin used.<br>
The process of the invention is of course also suitable for the encapsulation of other<br>
core materials than flavoring ingredients, such as perfuming ingredients, Pharmaceuticals<br>
or cosmetic ingredients.<br>
The following steps of the process are respectively coacervation by water dilution<br>
and/or pH adjustment, followed by the cooling of the coacervate to provide wall-formation.<br>
The cooling must allow to reach a temperature where the colloids do gel. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the cooling rate is comprised between 0.25 and 0.5°C/min.<br>
Finally, a hardening agent is added in order to cross-link the wall formed around<br>
the hydrophobic core material. Typical examples of hardening agents suitable for the<br>
purpose of the invention include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde,<br>
chrome alum and the like.<br>
Microcapsules susceptible of being obtained by a process according to the<br>
invention constitute another object of the invention. These delivery systems present the<br>
advantage of being potentially "Halal" certified, and can therefore be used for the flavoring<br>
of so-designated final consumer products.<br>
On the other hand, the microcapsules of the invention are very highly loaded in<br>
hydrophobic core material. More particularly, the microcapsules may contain up to 80% by<br>
weight of a hydrophobic core material, while the processes disclosed in the prior art only<br>
allowed to have up to 35% by weight of active ingredient in the capsules.<br>
The final products have a wall thickness and a morphology very satisfactory and<br>
comparable to that of microcapsules prepared starting from type A gelatin at same fix<br>
level, as revealed by microscopic pictures shown in figures 1 and 2.<br>
The microcapsules produced by the process of the invention can be used in many<br>
kinds of applications in the field of foods and flavors. Therefore, food compositions<br>
comprising the microcapsules according to the invention together with other flavoring<br>
coingredients, are also objects of the present invention.<br>

 Brief Description of accompanying Drawings<br>
Figures 1 and 2 (Fig.1 and 2) are microscopic pictures at 10x magnification of<br>
complex coacervates prepared respectively with type A (Fig. 1) and type B (Fig. 2) gelatin<br>
as cationic polymers.<br>
Modes of Carrying out the Invention<br>
The invention will now be described in a more detailed manner in the example<br>
below, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees Celsius and the abbreviations<br>
have the usual meaning in the art.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of microcapsules according to the process of the invention - comparison with<br>
other processes<br>
Type B gelatin (250 Bloom, origin: SKW Biosystems, USA), gum arabic, cold pressed<br>
orange peel oil, limonene, eugenol, and octyl acetate were used for the preparation of<br>
microcapsules. Several trials were made, varying the concentrations of colloids, the pH of<br>
the system, the amount of dilution water, the order of the process steps and the ratio<br>
between gelatin and gum arabic.<br>
Table 1 reports the amounts of ingredients used in each trial.<br>
Table 1 : Amounts of gelatin, water, sum arabic, water, flavor and dilution water in the<br>
process of the invention in five trials<br>
Trial #	1	2	3	4	5<br>
Gelatin [g]	9-	9	7.5	9	9<br>
Water [g]	100	100	10C	100	100<br>
Gum arabic [g]	6	6	7.5	6	6<br>
Water [g]	150	150	150	150	150<br>
Flavor [g]	60	60	60	60	60<br>
Dilution water [g]	200	400	400	200	200<br>
Procedure for preparation<br>
All the microcapsules were prepared by a process comprising the basic steps of<br>
emulsification or dispersion, coacervation (water dilution), wall-focming (cooling) and<br>
cross-Unking. However, from one trial to another, the proportions of ingredients and/or the<br>
stage of pH adjustment in the process were changed. In all the trials, the colloid solutions<br>
were mixed at a temperature of 37-40°. The final temperature of the system was 22-24°.<br>
The pH was adjusted by addition of lactic acid. The cooling rate was comprised between<br>
0.25 and 0.5°/min. After cooling the batch to the final temperature, 0.14% by weight of<br>
glutaraldehyde solution (25%) were added to cross-link the protein wall.<br>
Trial #1 : Components were mixed in the following order : the flavor (cold pressed orange<br>
peel oil) was emulsified in a mixture of gelatin solution and gum arabic solution. Dilution<br>
water was added. The batch pH was then adjusted from 4.64 to 2.82 in decrements but<br>
there was practically no wall formation.<br>
Trial #2 : The trial was identical to trial 1, except for doubling the amount of dilution<br>
water. Trial was unsuccessful.<br>
Trial #3 : Identical to trial #2 except that the concentrations of the colloid solutions were<br>
changed along with the ratio. Trial was unsuccessful.<br>
Trials #1to 3 demonstrate the essential character of the order in which the steps of the<br>
process of the invention are performed. When the pH is adjusted after the<br>
emulsification/dispersion step, no wall formation occurs.<br>
Trial #4 : Identical to trial #1 in formulation. Order of addition was changed. After mixing<br>
the colloid solutions, pH was adjusted to 3.0 with lactic acid, prior to the addition of flavor<br>
oil. Excellent wall formation was observable. This trial proves the importance of the pH<br>
adjustment' stage in the process.<br>
Trial #5 : Everything was done like in trial #4, except that the flavor consisted of a 60 : 20 :<br>
20 mixture of limonene, eugenol and octyl acetate. Trial was successful.<br>
It can be concluded from the above experiments that the preparation of microcapsules with<br>
type B gelatin is successful as long as the pH of the colloid solution is suitably adjusted<br>
and as long as this is done prior to the addition of the hydrophobic core material.<br>
