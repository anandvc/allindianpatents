				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of dense high<br>
alumina refractory aggregate from sillimanite sand based minerals.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a process for the production of<br>
dense high alumina refractory aggregate from a novel composition consisting of<br>
sillimanite sand based minerals, ZrO2, and TiO2 for direct application as<br>
refractory or as a component /constituent of castable.<br>
Sillimanite beach sand is a byproduct obtained during the extraction of rare<br>
earth compounds from beach sand minerals. Mineralogically it is sillimanite<br>
(AI2O3.SiO2) associated with small amounts of other mineral phase. Sillimanite<br>
decomposes to mullite and silica on heating in the temperature range 1300 to<br>
1700°C.<br>
Mullite is the only stable compound with high covalency in the SiO2-AI2O3<br>
system. Mullite has many advantageous properties of refractory materials (a)<br>
high melting point (b) low thermal expansion, which yields good thermal shock<br>
resistance (c) good corrosion and creep resistance (d) little deformation under<br>
load.<br>
Due to these unique properties the mullite-based materials is used as<br>
refractories in many industrial fields. In steel industry mullite-based bricks are<br>
the main constituent of the lining of the upper part of melting furnace, hot blast<br>
stoves, hot iron runner and continuous casting furnaces. Mullite refractory<br>
bricks are also important components for the lining of high temperature tool in<br>
cement industry e.g. calcination and cooler zones of rotary kiln.<br>
Sillimanite can be used directly or in combination with alumina depending upon<br>
the requirement of the alumina content and temperature of application for<br>
production of refractory aggregates. Decomposition temperature of sillimanite<br>
sand depends on the particle size and impurity level of the raw material.<br>
3 (AI2O3. SiO2) = 3 AI2O3. 2 SiO2 + SiO2.<br>
Silica released partially reacts with the impurities form a glassy phase which<br>
impairs the product quality. Product quality can be improved by reducing the<br>
amount of glassy phase in the aggregate.<br>
Reference may be made to Ceramics International Vol. 20, 299-302 (1994);<br>
wherein sillimanite was sintered in presence of Ti02. or ZrO2 in the temperature<br>
range of 1520° 1570°C. The TiO2 used is between 6 to 8 wt. % and ZrO2<br>
between 9 to 12.5 wt. %. Liquid phase formation was responsible for improved<br>
densification and flexural strength at room temperature varied between 45-94<br>
MPa.<br>
Reference may be drawn from Journal of European Ceramic Society, Vol 18,<br>
2081-2087 (1998); wherein densification of sillimanite by wet milling and<br>
addition of TiO2 where carried out in the temperature range of 1500° to 1550°C.<br>
The pressing is done in two step, i.e., uniaxial as well as isostatic. The high<br>
temperature flexural strength measured at 1200°C falls when the sintering<br>
temperature increases above 1500°C to 375 MPa. Bloating surface of samples<br>
occurred when the aggregate were fired beyong 1550°C due to excessive<br>
glassy phase.<br>
Reference may be made to Industrial Ceramics Vol. 19, 13-16 (1999); wherein<br>
sillimanite were sintered by milling and adding ZrO2. Densification was<br>
achieved at 1600°C where the open porosity is almost zero. The hot MOR<br>
increases with 2 wt. % addition compared to no additives as the glassy phase<br>
is converted to zircon. HMOR at 1200°C is 360 MPa.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 4,960,738 (1990) where mullite -alumina<br>
composites sintered body with AI2O3 in the range of 75-85 wt% were developed<br>
from powdery aluminosilicate material and sintered in the range of 1500-<br>
1650°C. The sintered body has an apparent porosity of 1%, grain size of 1 Dm<br>
and bending strength at room temperature SOOMPa.<br>
The main drawbacks of the hitherto known process are:<br>
1. High alumina aggregates produced from sillimanite sand needs higher<br>
temperature of 1600°C when ZrO2 is used. On the other hand for TiO2<br>
additive firing above 1500°C deteriorates the product characteristics due<br>
to excessive generation of glassy phase and formation of bloated<br>
surface. The higher level of the additives would form excessive liquid<br>
and reduce the high temperature strength of the aggregates.<br>
2. In all the above process two step pressing i.e uniaxial and isostatic had<br>
been done.<br>
3. The process which consists sintered body above 75% alumina the grain<br>
size is only 1 urn which may deteriorate some high temperature<br>
properties.<br>
At present there is a huge demand of high alumina aggregates with<br>
content in the range of 55-60% in refractory industries. Hence, there is a<br>
definite need to provide a process for the manufacture of dense high alumina<br>
refractory aggregate.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of dense high alumina refractory aggregate from sillimanite sand<br>
based minerals, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art<br>
as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein the<br>
starting material is a novel composition consisting of sillimanite sand based<br>
mineral, ZrO2 and TiOa, which will provide combined additives to achieve a<br>
dense product at a relatively low temperature.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop sintered high alumina<br>
refractory aggregate by adopting single step uniaxial pressing.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to produce high alumina<br>
aggregate with homogeneous microstructure and improved thermomechanical<br>
properties.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide dense high alumina<br>
refractory aggregates in the AI2O3 range of 55 to 62 wt% for application above<br>
1500°C.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide dense high alumina<br>
refractory aggregates having grain size in the range of 5 -10 urn compared to<br>
1um as obtained in the prior art, there by improving the high temperature<br>
strength.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of dense high alumina refractory aggregate from sillimanite sand<br>
based minerals, by utilizing low cost sillimanite sand, a byproduct obtained<br>
during extraction of rare earth compounds from beach sand minerals.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which is<br>
economical compared to the hithero known prior art processes,<br>
introduction of mixed additives, pressing in only one step and sintering. The<br>
above process is considered to be cheaper than the earlier processes.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the manufacture of dense high<br>
alumina refractory aggregate from sillimanite sand based minerals. This has<br>
been made possible by providing a process wherein the starting material is a<br>
novel composition consisting of sillimanite sand minerals, ZrO2 and TiO2. The<br>
process involves proper milling of the novel mixture and single firing at a<br>
temperature in the range of 1500° to 1600°C. The novel composition helps<br>
intensify the densification through liquid phase sintering and controls the glassy<br>
phase and improves the high temperature properties. High alumina aggregates<br>
in the range of 55 to 62% AI2O3 thus produced has above 98% densification,<br>
average grain size of 5 to 10 urn, hot modulus of rupture at 1250°C is 1700 to<br>
2100 kg/cm2.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of<br>
dense high alumina refractory aggregates from sillimanite sand based minerals,<br>
which comprises: milling 93 to 96 wt% Sillimanite sand; 6 to1 wt% Titanium<br>
dioxide and 1 to 3 wt% Zirconium dioxide in presence of a solvent such as<br>
water, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, hexane for a period in the range of 8 to 24<br>
hours to obtain milled slurry, the resultant milled slurry being dried at a<br>
temperature in the range of 90 to 120°C for a period in the range of 24 to 48<br>
hours, mixing the milled and dried powder so obtained with an organic binder in<br>
the proportion of 92 to 98 wt% powder and 2 to 8wt% binder to obtain a prepressed<br>
powder, subjecting the pre-pressed powder to uniaxial pressing to<br>
obtain pellets, drying the said pellets at a temperature in the range of 90 to<br>
120°C for a period in the range of 24 to 48 hours, sintering the dried pellets at a<br>
temperature in the range of 1450 to 1650°C for a period in the range of 10 to 24<br>
hours, allowing the sintered pellets to cool naturally.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the sillimanite sand contains 55 to<br>
62 wt% AI2O3.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the ZrO2 is of 99% purity.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the TiO2 is of 99% purity.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the milling is done in<br>
conventional mill such as attrition mill, ball mill, vibro-mill.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the organic binder is<br>
poly vinyl alcohol, dextrine, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the solvent used is in the<br>
weight ratio of solid : solvent :: 1 : 2.<br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention, the uniaxial pressing is<br>
done in the range of 100 to 130MPa.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is the production of high density high<br>
alumina refractory aggregate from sillimanite beach sand for application at<br>
1500°C or above. Another novel feature of the process is the single pressing<br>
rather than conventional and isostatic pressing as in the prior art. Aggregates<br>
developed by this process has the advantage for application in kilns and<br>
furnaces at high temperature, particularly where the temperature range is<br>
between 1500 to 1600°C which is not possible by existing prir art processes<br>
due to formation of excessive liquid or poor densification.<br>
The non-obvious inventive steps to realize the novel features of the present<br>
invention resides in:<br>
(i) providing the novel composition consisting sillimanite sand based mineral,<br>
Zr02 and TiO2;<br>
(ii) utilizing the effect of two additives, TiO2 and ZrO2 in the sintering of high<br>
alumina aggregate containing 55 to 62% alumina. TiO2 is the liquid forming<br>
additive and facilitates the densification of mullite through liquid phase<br>
sintering. While ZrO2 converts the excess glass phase (SiO2) formed during<br>
dissociation reaction to ZrSiO4. This is beneficial to control the bloating of<br>
aggregates and improve hot properties.<br>
The reaction can be expressed as follows:<br>
3(A12 O, .SiO2 ) 3A12 O3 .2SiO2 + SiO22<br>
ZrO2 + SiO2 - ZrSiO4<br>
Therefore, when both the above additives are used in appropriate proportion<br>
densification is enhanced without deteriorating the high temperature properties.<br>
Thus the aggregate is suitable for application in vessels where the temperature<br>
is above 1500°C.<br>
The details of the process steps of the present invention are:<br>
1. Mixing of sillimanite sand 93 to 96 wt% with 6 to 1 wt% TiO2 and 1 to 3<br>
wt % ZrO2,<br>
2. Milling the mixture in conventional mill such as attrition mill, ball mill,<br>
vibromill in a liquid medium such as water, isopropyl alcohol, acetone,<br>
hexane in the weight ratio of solid:solvent:: 1:2 for a period in the range<br>
of 8 to 24 hrs to obtained milled slurry.<br>
3. Drying the resultant slurry at a temperature in the range of 90 to 120°C<br>
for a period in the range of 24 to 48 hours to obtain a synergistic<br>
composition.<br>
4. mixing the synergistic composition with an organic binder to obtain a<br>
pre-pressed powder,<br>
5. uniaxial pressing of the pre-pressed powder to form pellets,<br>
6. drying the pellets so obtain at a temperature in the range of 90 to 120°C<br>
for a period in the range of 24 to 48 hours,<br>
7. firing the pellets so obtain in the range of 1450 to 1650°C for a period in<br>
the range of 10 to 24 hrs,<br>
8. allowing the sintered pellets to cool naturally.<br>
The sintered high alumina aggregates were characterized by determining<br>
properties like 1) bulk density and apparent porosity 2) phase identification by<br>
X-ray and IR 3) high temperature flexural strength 4) microstructure. Bulk<br>
density apparent porosity were measured by liquid displacement method using<br>
Archimedes principle in water medium. High temperature flexural strength was<br>
determined by three point bending test at 1250°C. Phase identification was<br>
carried out by X-ray and IR and microstructure of the polished and thermally<br>
etched sample was observed by scanning electron microscope.<br>
The prior art details describes that the additive which is beneficial for low<br>
temperature densification (1500°C), resulted bloating of aggregates when used<br>
at higher temperature. Alternatively for other additive proper densification of<br>
aggregate achieved above 1600°C thereby restricting its use in the range of<br>
1500 to 1600°C. More over the grain size of high alumina aggregate in some<br>
of the prior art processes is too low (1um) which will affect the corrosion<br>
resistance of the ultimate product.<br>
The process of the present invention is described with the help of the following<br>
examples for carrying out the process in actual practice. However, these<br>
examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Exam pie-1<br>
Beach sand sillimanite was mixed with 4.5 wt% TiO2 and 2 wt% ZrO2. The<br>
resultant mixture was attrition milled for 9 hrs. in water as dispersing medium.<br>
The slurry thus obtained was dried at 110±5°C for 24 hrs and subsequently<br>
crushed to break the agglomerate. The powder was then mixed with 6% PVA<br>
solution (5% concentration) and pressed uniaxially at a pressure of 1200<br>
kg/cm2. Pressed compacts were dried and fired at 1500°C with a soaking<br>
period of 2 hrs. The total firing schedule was 10 hrs. The bulk density and<br>
apparent porosity of the sintered aggregate were 2.97 g/cc and 0.6 %<br>
respectively. Hot MOR at 1250°C is 2100 kg/cm2. SEM photomicrograph<br>
showed compact and uniform microstructure with average grain size of 5 urn.<br>
Example-2<br>
Beach sand sillimanite was mixed with 1.5 wt% TiO2 and 2 wt% ZrO2. The<br>
resultant mixture was attrition milled for 9 hrs. in isopropyl alcohol as dispersing<br>
medium. The slurry thus obtained was air dried followed by drying at 110±5°C<br>
for 24 hrs. The powder was then mixed with 6% PVA solution (5%<br>
concentration) and pressed uniaxially at a pressure of 1200 kg/cm2. Pressed<br>
compacts were dried and fired at 1600°C with a soaking period of 2 hrs. The<br>
total firing schedule was 10 hrs. The bulk density and apparent porosity of the<br>
sintered aggregate were 2.96 g/cc and 0.6 % respectively. Hot MOR at 1250°C<br>
is 1760 kg/cm2. SEM photomicrograph showed compact and uniform<br>
microstructure with average grain size of 5 urn.<br>
Example-3<br>
Beach sand sillimanite was mixed with 3 wt% TiO2 and 2 wt% ZrO2. The<br>
resultant mixture was attrition milled for 12 hrs. in water as dispersing medium.<br>
The slurry thus obtained was air dried followed by drying at 110±5°C for 24 hrs.<br>
The powder was then mixed with 6% PVA solution (5% concentration) and<br>
pressed uniaxially at a pressure of 1200 kg/cm2. Pressed compacts were dried<br>
and fired at 1550°C with a soaking period of 2 hrs. The total firing schedule<br>
was 12 hrs. The bulk density and apparent porosity of the sintered aggregate<br>
were 3.03 g/cc and 0.6 % respectively. Hot MOR at 1250°C is 1785 kg/cm2.<br>
SEM photomicrograph showed compact and uniform microstructure with<br>
average grain size of 5 urn.<br>
Example-4<br>
Sillimanite rock was crushed and ground to pass through 60 mesh BS sieve.<br>
Powdered sillimanite was mixed with 1.5 wt% TiO2 and 2 wt% ZrO2. The<br>
resultant mixture was attrition milled for 12 hrs. in alcohol as dispersing<br>
medium. The slurry thus obtained was air dried followed by drying at 90±5°C<br>
for 24 hrs. The powder was then mixed with 6% PVA solution (5%<br>
concentration) and pressed uniaxially at a pressure of 1200 kg/cm2. Pressed<br>
compacts were dried and fired at 1500°C with a soaking period of 2 hrs. The<br>
total firing schedule was 12 hrs. The bulk density and apparent porosity of the<br>
sintered aggregate were 2.98 g/cc and 1 % respectively. Hot MOR at 1250°C<br>
is 1785 kg/cm2. SEM photomicrograph showed compact and uniform<br>
microstructure with average grain size of 5 urn.<br>
From the above examples it is observed that the properties of the aggregates<br>
of the present invention are much superior than that reported in the prior art.<br>
The hot MOR at 1250°C is between 1700 to 2100 kg/cm2. The low glassy<br>
phase due to incorporation of ZrO2 has enhanced this property. Furthermore,<br>
the grain size of the product is between 5 to 10 urn compared to 1 urn of the<br>
prior art. Higher grain size of the aggregate will improve the corrosion<br>
resistance of the refractories.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. Production of dense high alumina aggregates in the AI2O3 range of 55 to<br>
62% for application above 1500°C.<br>
2. The additives intensify the sintering as well as controls the glassy phase in<br>
the matrix. Therefore, dense grains with improved hot properties of<br>
aggregates are produced.<br>
3. A single uniaxial pressing of powders is sufficient to obtain the properties<br>
compared to two step uniaxial and isostatic pressing conducted in the prior<br>
art processes.<br>
4. Grain size of aggregates are in the range of 5 to 10 urn compared to 1 urn.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
