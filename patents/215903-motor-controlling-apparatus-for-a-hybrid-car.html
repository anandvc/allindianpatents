				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION. QF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Technical Field to Which the Invention Belongs]<br>
This invention relates to a hybrid automobile provided with an internal combustion engine and electric driving means. [Prior Art]<br>
For an engine carried on an automobile or the like, torque and revolution number characteristics over a wide range are required so that the engine may operate in any running condition (constant speed, acceleration, uphill road driving and so forth).<br>
Generally, the torque and the number of revolutions of the engine in which the fuel consumption efficiency is high are specified to a range peculiar to the engine.<br>
Therefore, there has been proposed a hybrid car wherein an engine and a generator-motor are carried on an automobile so that drawbacks of them may be made up for each other to raise the overall energy efficiency. As a conventional hybrid car, a hybrid car is known wherein, for example, the engine is designed with a reduced capacity and is normally operated only in a range in which it exhibits a high fuel consumption efficiency, and a motor<br>
controlling apparatus for a hybrid car is provided which effects regenerative control such that, when the car is accelerated or runs on an uphill road or the like, driving of the generator-motor is controlled with supplied power from a power supply such as a battery to make up for an insufficient driving torque, but when the output of the engine exhibits some surplus power, generated energy obtained when the generator-motor is driven by the engine is regenerated into the power supply such as a battery (the official gazette of Japanese Patent Publication Application No. 62-27604). The conventional motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car causes motor current to flow through the generator-motor and controls so that an aimed torque calculated based on an operation amount of an accelerator pedal or the like and a fed back driving wheel torque detected by a torque sensor or the like may be equal to each other to make up for an insufficient driving torque. [Subject to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, with the conventional motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car, since the torque of the driving wheel detected using a torque detection mechanism which has<br>
some range of mechanical dispersion is fed back to cause motor current to flow though the generator-motor to make up for an insufficient driving torque, particularly when a high torque is requested while the speed of revolution is low, excessive motor current sometimes flows within the range of the dispersion, and the excessive motor current may exceed a rated motor current and possibly damage the generator-motor and reduce the life.<br>
Further, in order that the generator-motor may not be damaged, a generator-motor having a high rated motor current taking an excessive motor current when a high torque is requested during low speed revolution must be employed, which requires a hybrid unit of an increasing size. The present invention has been made to solve the subjects of the prior art described above, and the object of the present invention resides in provision of a motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car which can effect current feedback control by which motor current can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy when a generator-motor rotates at a low speed to protect the generator-motor from over-current and can effect torque feedback control in<br>
a high vehicle speed-high torque region to raise the fuel consumption efficiency of an engine.<br>

On the other hand, in a high vehicle speed-high torque region, torque feedback control can be performed to effect control of the generator-motor including also the driving torque of the engine.<br>
A motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car as set forth in claim 2 of the present invention is characterized in that the current feedback control means includes aimed current setting means for setting the aimed current based on the torque instruction value, motor current detection means for detecting the motor current of the generator-motor, selection comparison means for outputting a reset pulse when an output value of the motor current detection means is higher than an output value of the aimed current setting means, and oscillation means for resetting an oscillation output to zero in response to the reset pulse. <br>
Since the motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car as set forth in claim 2 of the present invention is constructed such that the current feedback control means includes the aimed current setting means , the motor current detection means, the selection comparison means, and the oscillation means, when the generator-motor rotates at a low speed, current feedback control by which the motor current can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy can be performed to protect the generator-motor from over-current. A motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car as set forth in claim 3 of the present invention is characterized in that the torque feedback control means includes deviation calculation means for calculating a deviation between the torque instruction value and the torque of the driving wheel, and proportional plus integral plus derivative control means for performing proportional plus integral plus derivative compensation for an output of the deviation calculation means.<br>
Since the motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car as set forth in claim 3 of the present invention is constructed such that the torque feedback control means<br>
includes the deviation calculation means for calculating a deviation between the torque instruction value and the torque of the driving wheel, and the proportional plus integral plus derivative control means for performing proportional plus integral plus derivative compensation for an output of the deviation calculation means, in a high vehicle speed-high torque region, torque feedback control can be performed to effect control of the generator-motor including also the driving torque of the engine.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car which includes aimed driving wheel output power setting means for setting a torque instruction value based on an output of an accelerator opening sensor and an output of a vehicle speed sensor characterized in that it comprises:<br>
current feedback control means for controlling a generator-motor so that a motor current of said generator-motor may be equal to an aimed current set based on the torque instruction value;<br>

The driving force transmission apparatus 60 of the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1) includes an engine 61, an<br>
inner member 62a of a centrifugal clutch 62 mounted on the crankshaft 54 of the engine 61, an outer member 62b of the centrifugal clutch 62 with and from which the inner member 62a is engaged and disengaged, the cone-type non-stage transmission 48 connected to the outer member 62b through a torque limiter 63, a first transmission gear 66 connected to the cone-type non-stage transmission 48 through a one¬way clutch 65, the motor 43 for driving the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1) together with the engine 61, the motor shaft 53 which serves as a joining point of driving forces, a second transmission gear 67 mounted on the motor shaft 53 and held in meshing engagement with the first transmission gear 66, an engine side first helical gear 68 and a motor side first helical gear 69 mounted on the motor shaft 53, an engine side second helical gear 71 and a motor side second helical gear 72 held in meshing engagement with the gears 68, 69, respectively, a countershaft 73 for supporting the gears 71, 72, pressure sensors 74a, 74b (refer to FIG. 8) mounted at the opposite ends of the countershaft 73, an output gear 75 mounted on the countershaft 73, a propeller shaft 76 connected to the output gear 75, the rear axle 51 connected to the propeller shaft 76 through a differential gear 78, and the rear wheels 14 (refer to FIG. 1) mounted on the rear axle 51.<br>
The sel-motor 56 rotates the crankshaft 54<br>
connected to a motor shaft 56a thereof through a belt 79, a chain 81 and a one-way clutch 82.<br>
FIG. 4 is a sectional view of the engine of the hybrid car according to the present invention.<br>
The engine 61 includes the cylinder block 41, a piston 83 fitted for back and forth movement in the cylinder block 41, a connecting rod 84a on which the piston 83 is mounted, the cylinder head 42 fitted on the cylinder block 41, an intake auxiliary valve 84 and an exhaust valve 85 provided on the cylinder head 42, and a spark plug 86 mounted on the cylinder head 42, and includes the mechanical pump 38 which rotates coaxially with the camshaft 37.  It is to be noted that reference symbol 37a denotes a cam chain, and 37b denotes a cam sprocket wheel.<br>
By adjusting the throttle pulley 34 through the control unit 22 and the servo motor 35 by an opening of an accelerator 87, the supply amount of fuel air mixture is adjusted to control the output power of the engine 61.<br>
During running only with the motor, if a request for the engine output power is issued when the accelerator 87 is open, the throttle pulley 34 is tightened by the<br>
servo motor 35 irrespective of the accelerator opening to make the starting of the engine 61 better.<br>
Meanwhile, part of the fuel air mixture supplied from the injector 36a is branched from the intake manifold 57 and additionally supplied by the mechanical pump 38 so as to be injected into the cylinder block 41 from the intake auxiliary valve 84 immediately prior to ignition to augment the engine output power.<br>
Operation of the driving force transmission apparatus 60 of the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1) described above is described with reference to FIGS . 5 to 7.<br>
(a), (b) of FIG. 5 are diagrammatic views of first operation of the driving force transmission apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
(a) illustrates a case wherein the rear wheels 14 are driven by a joined force of the engine 61 and the motor 43.<br>
The engine 61 drives the rear wheels 14 through the inner member 62a of the centrifugal clutch 62, outer member 62b, cone-type non-stage transmission 48, one-way clutch 65, first transmission gear 66, second transmission gear 67 and engine side first helical gear 68 mounted on the motor<br>
shaft 53 which makes a joining point with the driving force of the motor 43, engine side second helical gear 71, output gear 75, propeller shaft 76, differential gear 78 and rear axle 51 in this order as indicated by an arrow mark (T).<br>
Meanwhile, the motor 43 drives the rear wheels 14 through the motor shaft 53, motor side first helical gear 69, motor side second helical gear 72, output gear 75, propeller shaft 76, differential gear 78 and rear axle 51 in this order as indicated by an arrow mark (2).<br>
The driving force of the engine 61 and the driving force of the motor 43 are joined together at the motor shaft 53.<br>
When the hybrid car 1 is to be started with the engine 61, the torque can be transmitted gradually and smoothly through the centrifugal clutch 62 to start the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1).<br>
Since the centrifugal clutch 62 is disposed in a stage preceding to the cone-type non-stage transmission 48, it may have a smaller clutch capacity than where it is disposed in a stage next to the cone-type non-stage transmission 48.  On the contrary, as viewed from the cone-type non-stage transmission 48 side, since it need not<br>
receive an excessive torque of the engine 61 directly, also protection of the cone-type non-stage transmission 48 can be anticipated.  Particularly where the clutch employed is of the wet type, since the contacting pressure is reduced, if the centrifugal clutch 62 is disposed in a stage following the cone-type non-stage transmission 48, then a large clutch capacity is required and the apparatus becomes large in size.<br>
Since the cone-type non-stage transmission 48 is connected to the outer member 62b of the centrifugal clutch 62 through the torque limiter 63, the engine 61 need not receive back torque from the rear wheels 14.<br>
(b) illustrates a case wherein the rear wheels 14 are driven only with the motor 43.<br>
The motor 43 drives the rear wheels 14 through the motor shaft 53, motor side first helical gear 69, motor side second helical gear 72, output gear 75, propeller shaft 76, differential gear 78, and rear axle 51 as indicated by an arrow mark (3).<br>
Since the engine 61 is stopped, the one-way clutch 65 is put into an open condition.<br>
Since the one-way clutch 65 is disposed immediately prior to the joining point with the driving force of the<br>
motor 43, when the rear wheels 14 are driven only with the motor 43, the cone-type non-stage transmission 48, the outer member 62b of the centrifugal clutch 62 and so forth which serve as the load side are not rotated together at all. Accordingly, the consumption of the batteries 21 can be saved, and a longer operation time can be secured.<br>
(a), (b) of FIG. 6 are diagrammatic views of second operation of the driving power transmission apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
(a) illustrates a case wherein the rear wheels 14 are driven only with the engine 61.<br>
The engine 61 drives the motor shaft 53 through the inner member 62a of the centrifugal clutch 62, outer member 62b, cone-type non-stage transmission 48, one-way clutch 65, first transmission gear 66, and second transmission gear 67 in this order as indicated by an arrow mark (4).  In other words, the motor 43 can be caused to act as a generator to charge the batteries 21 (refer to FIG. 1).<br>
Further, the engine 61 drives the rear wheels 14 through the engine side first helical gear 68, the engine side second helical gear 71, output gear 75, propeller shaft 76, differential gear 78, and rear axle 51 in this order as indicated by an arrow mark (5).<br>
(b) illustrates a case wherein the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1) is driven to run backwardly with the motor 43.<br>
The motor 43 is driven to rotate reversely and the reverse rotation is transmitted to the rear wheels 14 through the motor shaft 53, motor side first helical gear 69, motor side second helical gear 72, output gear 75, propeller shaft 76, differential gear 78, and rear axle 51 in this order as indicated by an arrow mark (6) to reversely rotate the rear wheels 14.<br>
Since the motor 43 rotates reversely while the engine 61 is stopped, the one-way clutch 65 is connected and the driving force of 'the motor 43 is transmitted up to the cone-type non-stage transmission 48 and the outer member 62b of the centrifugal clutch 62 as indicated by an arrow mark (7), but the engine 61 is not rotated together due to the presence of the centrifugal clutch 62.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagrammatic view illustrating third operation of the driving power transmission apparatus according to the present invention, and illustrates a flow of driving force upon deceleration of the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1) .<br>
Upon deceleration of the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1), driving force is transmitted to the motor 43 through the rear wheels 14, rear axle 51, differential gear 78, propeller shaft 76, motor side second helical gear 72, motor side first helical gear 69, and motor shaft 53 in this order as indicated by an arrow mark ®, and the motor 43 acts as a generator.  In this instance, since the one¬way clutch 65 is put into an open condition, the driving force upon deceleration can be transmitted effectively to the motor 43 and the batteries 21 (refer to FIG. 1) can be charged. FIG. 8 is a sectional view of the torque sensor unit of the driving force transmission apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
The torque sensor unit 88 includes the countershaft 73, the pressure sensors 74a, 74b mounted at the opposite ends of the countershaft 73, the engine side second helical gear 71 and the motor side second helical gear 72 mounted on the countershaft 73, and the engine side first helical gear 68 and the motor side first helical gear 69 held in meshing engagement with the gears 71, 72, respectively, all described hereinabove, and operation of the torque sensor unit 88 is described below with the following figure.<br>
(a), (b) of FIG. 9 are diagrammatic views illustrating operation of the torque sensor unit 88 according to the present invention.<br>
(a)	illustrates operation of the torque sensor unit<br>
88 upon acceleration.<br>
Upon acceleration, driving force is transmitted from the engine 61 (refer to FIG. 3) or the motor 43 side to the rear wheels 14.  In particular, since the engine side first helical gear 68 and the motor side first helical gear 69 serve as the driving side while the engine side second helical gear 71 and the motor side second helical gear 72 serve as driven side, the gears 71, 72 cause the countershaft 73 to generate a stress Fa as indicated by an arrow mark a.  This stress Fa is detected by the pressure sensor 74a.<br>

88 upon deceleration.<br>
Upon deceleration, driving force is transmitted from the rear wheels 14 side to the motor 43 side.  In particular, since the engine side second helical gear 71 and the motor side second helical gear 72 serve as the driving side while the engine side first helical gear 68 and the motor side first helical gear 69 serve as driven<br>
side, the gears 68, 69 cause the countershaft 73 to generate a stress Fb as indicated by an arrow mark b.  This stress Fb is detected by the pressure sensor 74b.<br>
In particular, by detecting the magnitude and the direction of transmission of driving force by the pressure sensors 74a, 74b and using them for feedback control such that the driving forces of the engine 61 and the motor 43 (refer to FIG. 2) which are driving sources are combined, the hybrid car 1 (refer to FIG. 1) can be driven efficiently.<br>
Since the torque sensor unit 88 is composed of the countershaft 73, pressure sensors 74a, 74b mounted at the opposite ends of the countershaft 73, engine side second helical gear 71 and motor side second helical gear 72 mounted on the countershaft 73, and engine side first helical gear 68 and motor side first helical gear 69 held in meshing engagement with the gears 71, 72, respectively, a torque detection mechanism which is compact and high in reliability can be implemented.<br>
FIG. 30 shows a diagram of a basic concept of control of the motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car according to the present invention, and a detailed form of<br>
the control is described below.<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram of an entire form of a hybrid car according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the hybrid car 100 includes rear wheels 14, a generator-motor 43, a cone-type non-stage transmission 48, an engine 61, various sensors 110, batteries 21, a hybrid car motor control apparatus 150, driving means 151, and a throttle control actuator 155.<br>
The various sensors 110 output a sensor signal SSI to management control means 120 of the hybrid car motor control apparatus 150.<br>
The management control means 120 outputs a toque instruction value Tq obtained by processing based on the sensor signal SS1 to motor control means 130 and outputs a throttle aimed opening signal S124 to the throttle control actuator 155.<br>
The motor control means 130 outputs a control signal S130 obtained by processing based on the toque instruction value Tq and a sensor signal SS2 to the driving means 151.<br>
The driving means 151 outputs driving signals (SU,<br>
SV, SW) obtained from the control signal S130 and a battery voltage VB to the generator-motor 43.<br>
The generator-motor 43 is driven or regenerates when the driving signals (SU, SV, SW) are provided to coils of three phases of a U phase, a V phase and a W phase illustrated in FIG. 15, and outputs motor torque TqM to the driving wheels 14 or charges the batteries 21 with regeneration power VR. Here, the driving signals SU, SV, SW are described with reference to FIG. 20.<br>
Referring to FIG. 20, reference symbols SUF, SVB, SWF, SUB, SVF, SWB denote the directions of the driving signals SU, SV, SW illustrated in FIG. 15, and for example, reference symbol SUF denotes a driving signal SU which is supplied from the batteries 21 to the U-phase of the generator-motor 43 when an FET Ql of the driving means 151 is on, and SUB denotes a driving signal SU which flows from the U-phase of the generator-motor 43 to the ground when another FET Q2 of the driving means 151 is on.<br>
Similarly, a driving signal SV which flows from the batteries 21 to the V-phase of the generator-motor 43 when a further FET Q3 of the driving means 151 is on is denoted<br>
by SVB; a driving signal SV which flows from the V-phase of the generator-motor 43 to the ground when a still further FET Q4 is on is denoted by SVB; a driving signal SW which is supplied from the batteries 21 to the W phase of the generator-motor 43 when a yet further FET Q5 of the driving means 151 is on is denoted by SWF; and a driving signal SW which flows from the W phase of the generator-motor 43 to the ground when a yet further FET Q6 is on is denoted by SWB.<br>
From the foregoing, within a period (T) shown in FIG. 20, the FET Ql and the FET Q4 are in an on state, and the driving signal SUF flows to the U phase of the generator-motor 43 through the batteries 21 → FET Ql, and the driving signal SVB flows to the ground through the V phase of the generator-motor 43 → FET Q4 .<br>
In this manner, the current (driving signal) within the period (1) flows from the U phase of the U phase, V phase and W phase of the three-phase coils of the generator-motor 43 to the V phase.<br>
This is synchronized with a rising edge of a magnetic pole position signal PM (115U) from a motor magnetic pole sensor 115 of the generator-motor 43.<br>
In short, the signal S115U detects an energization timing to the U phase, and control to cause current to flow from the coil of the U phase to the coil of the V phase is executed by UVW energization pattern generation means 135.<br>
On the other hand, within another period (2), the FET Q6 is turned on in place of the FET Q4 (the FET Q4 is in an off state) and the driving signal SWB flows, and the flow of the current (driving signal) from the U phase to the V phase is switched from the U phase to the W phase.<br>

aimed opening data corresponding to the engine aimed output power signal S123 in the ROM in advance, and outputs a throttle aimed opening signal S124 obtained by reading out the throttle aimed opening data using the engine aimed output power signal S123 as an address to the throttle control actuator 155.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagrammatic view of the mode changeover switch 113.<br>
The mode changeover switch 113 changes over the running mode of the hybrid car 100 among the three modes of a semi-automatic mode, a full automatic mode and an EV (running only with the generator-motor 43) mode.<br>
The semi-automatic mode is a mode wherein the driving output power condition of the generator-motor 43 is set higher than that of driving with the engine 61 and the car runs principally using the generator-motor 43, and is a running mode wherein, when the driving torque of the generator-motor 43 is insufficient, it is made up for by driving torque from the engine 61 and consumption of gasoline is suppressed.<br>

FIG. 17 is an operation flow chart of the torque feedback control means and the mode control means.<br>
In step P1, torque deviation calculation (ΔT = Tq - Ts) to be performed by the deviation calculation means 141 is performed to calculate a deviation signal AT, whereafter the control advances to step P2.<br>
In step P2, PID compensation is performed for the deviation signal AT by the PID control means 142, whereafter the control advances to step P3.<br>
In step P3, mode discrimination which will be<br>
hereinafter described with reference to FIG. 18 is performed, and the control advances to one of steps P5 to P7 in accordance with the discrimination.<br>
In step P5, the duty /lead angle amount calculation means 144 enters a lead angle mode, in which it performs calculation of the lead angle amount.<br>
In step P6, the duty /lead angle amount calculation means 144 enters a driving logic mode, in which it performs calculation of the duty.<br>
In step P7, the duty/lead angle amount calculation means 144 enters a regeneration logic mode, in which it performs calculation of the duty. Here, the discrimination flow of FIG. 18 is described with reference to FIGS. 15, 17 and 20. (Details regarding FIG. 15 are hereinafter described. )<br>
The lead angle mode is control wherein, as indicated by a broken line in output waveforms of FIG. 20 (the driving signal SUF is taken as an example), the signals of SU, SV and SW which make driving signals are turned on (led) rather early with respect to the signals<br>
S115U, S115V and S115W of the motor magnetic pole sensor 115.<br>
This can change the characteristic of the motor to that of a low torque high rotation type and particularly can increase the torque upon high rotation.<br>
This rotates the motor at a high speed by decreasing the fields of the motor coils, and is called field-weakening control.<br>
The lead angle is proceeded while the normal energization angle of 120° is continuously increased, and after the energization angle is increased to 170° , the lead angle is further increased while the energization angle is held at 170° . In the flow illustrated in FIG. 18, first in step P30, discrimination of which one of the driving logic mode, the lead angle mode and the regeneration logic mode the preceding control is is performed.<br>
Then, for the discriminated driving logic mode (step P31), lead angle mode (step p32) or regeneration logic mode (step P33), discrimination of whether a deviation ΔT (= Tq - Ts ) between the aimed torque (Tq) and the current torque (Ts) is positive (+), zero (0) or<br>
negative (-) is executed (steps P41, P44 and P46).<br>
If it is discriminated in step P41 that the deviation ΔT is positive (ΔT &gt; 0), then since the current torque (Ts) is insufficient with respect to the aimed torque (Tq), the control advances to step P42, in which the duty (Duty) in the last energization to the motor is equal to or higher than 98 %.  If the last duty is equal to or higher than 98 %, then the control advances to step P51, in which the lead angle mode is entered and the duty is set to 100 %.<br>
Accordingly, field-weakening control is started at this point of time.<br>
In the lead angle mode, an energization angle wherein PID (proportional, integral and derivative) terms are added to the last energization angle is determined (step P5 of FIG. 17), and an angle by which the determined energization angle exceeds the ordinary energization angle (120° ) is led as indicated by a broken line in FIG. 20.<br>
On the other hand, when the last duty in step P42 is lower than 98 %, and when it is discriminated in step P41 that the deviation ΔT is zero(ΔT = 0), the control advances to step P52, in which the driving logic mode is<br>
entered, and a duty obtained by adding PID (proportional, integral and derivative) terms to the last energization duty is outputted as a driving signal (step P6 shown in FIG. 17).<br>
In the meantime, when it is discriminated in step P41 that the deviation ΔT is negative(ΔT 
If the deviation ΔT is negative(ΔT 
As the duty decreases, also the current torque (Ts) decreases, and if the aimed torque (Tq) is positive, then when the current torque (Ts) and the aimed torque (Tq)<br>
become equal to each other (Tq = Ts), the deviation ΔT becomes ΔT = 0, and also the PID terms become 0.  The duty becomes stable with the value at the present point of time, and fixed torque operation is entered.<br>
If the aimed torque (Tq) is negative (Tq 
The regeneration logic mode is a mode wherein, as illustrated in FIG. 20, the coils of the U phase, the V phase and the W phase and the batteries are put into an on-state by the FETs Ql, Q3 and Q5 so that the coils may have connection timings for each 120 degrees.<br>
In the regeneration logic mode, the PID terms are subtracted from the last duty to calculate a motor duty (step P7 of FIG. 17), and while the deviation ΔT is equal<br>
to or lower than 0(ΔT ≥ 0) (from step 46 to step P56), also the PID terms are equal to or lower than 0, and the energization duty of the motor is substantially increased from a minimum value equal to or lower than 2 % and regeneration braking increases.<br>
Consequently, since the value of the current torque (Ts) becomes negative (Ts 
Thereafter, at the point of time when the deviation ΔT becomes positive(ΔT &gt; 0) (step P46), the regeneration logic mode is continued before the last duty becomes lower than 2 % (step P56) .<br>
This is because, since also the PID terms become positive as the deviation ΔT becomes positive, the duty decreases.<br>
Then, at the point of time when the duty becomes lower than 2 %, the driving logic mode is entered (the control advances from step P55 to step 6 of FIG. 17).<br>
Accordingly, the regeneration logic mode comes to an end at this point of time.<br>
If the deviation ΔT is positive, then since also the PID terms are positive, the duty is now increased by the calculation in step P6 illustrated in FIG. 17.<br>
Then, in step P44, if the deviation ΔT is equal to or higher than 0(ΔT ≥ 0), since the last mode is the lead angle mode, an increase of the torque is demanded continuously, and the lead angle mode is continued through step P54 (step P5 of FIG. 17).<br>
On the other hand, if the deviation ΔT is negative(ΔT 
In this instance, in step P5, the PID terms are added to the last energization angle.  However, since the deviation ΔT is negative(ΔT 
Accordingly, the field-weakening control is ended at this point of time .<br>
By switchably controlling the mode among the driving logic mode, the lead angle mode and the regeneration logic mode in response to the value of the deviation ΔT to effect control, torque feedback control confirming to a desired aimed torque (Tq) can be performed.<br>
It is to be noted that, while the driving signals (SU, SV and SW) of FIG. 20 are on (in the H level state) in all of the modes , a delicate duty pulse is outputted as shown in FIG. 29 so that the effective voltage of the motor is controlled.<br>
FIG. 15 shows a circuit of the driving means.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, the driving means 151 includes N-channel FETs (Ql to Q6 ) , flywheel diodes (Dl to D6), and a capacitor Cl.<br>
The driving means 151 receives an on/off signal of the driving control signal S130 at the gates (G2, G4 and G6) and a PWM signal of the driving control signal S130 at the gates (Gl, G3 and G5 ) , and outputs such driving signals (SU, SV and SW, or SUF, SVF and SWF, or else SUB, SVB and SWB) as shown in FIG. 19 to the three-phase DC brushless generator-motor 43 to control driving of the generator-<br>
motor 43. In this manner, the hybrid car 100 includes the rear wheels 14, the generator-motor 43, the transmission 48, the engine 61, the various sensors 110, the batteries 21, the hybrid car motor control apparatus 150, the driving means 151, driving/regeneration changeover means 152 and the throttle control actuator 155, discriminates a full automatic mode wherein the engine is driven only within a range within which the fuel consumption efficiency is high and generation energy obtained by driving the generator-motor with the engine output power is used to charge the batteries while the car is running and a semi-automatic mode wherein the generator-motor is driven with supply power from the batteries to cause the car to run and, only when the driving force of the generator-motor is insufficient, the engine driving force is assisted, by a switching operation of the mode switch to control driving of the engine and the generator-motor so that running principally with the engine or running principally with the EV (generator-motor) can be performed, performs, when rotation of the generator-motor is low, current feedback control by which the motor current can be controlled with a high degree of accuracy whereas it performs toque feedback<br>
control in a high vehicle speed-high torque region, and controls the allowable maximum motor current value to protect the generator-motor from excessive current and can raise the fuel consumption efficiency of the engine.<br>
Consequently, also it is possible to reduce to current sensors 161 to one, and reduction in cost is possible. FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating the driving regions of the engine and the motor of the hybrid car according to the present invention.<br>
The hybrid car 100 basically allows driving with the engine 61 over the entire driving region.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, the axis of abscissa is the vehicle speed V (km/h) and the axis of ordinate is the toque instruction value Tq (kgf • cm), and the driving region is divided into an engine region in which the engine 61 drives the car, an EV region in which the car is driven only with the generator-motor 43, an engine charging region in which the engine 61 is operated in a high efficiency region to drive the generator-motor 43 and generation energy generated by the generator-motor 43 is used to charge the batteries 21 while the car is running, a charging region and a regeneration region in which, when<br>
the car is decelerated, regeneration braking is applied by the generator-motor 43 to cause the generator-motor 43 to generate power to charge the batteries 21, an engine/motor region (1) in which the car is driven with the engine 61 and the generator-motor 43, and another engine/motor region (2) in which the car is driven with the engine 61 and the generator-motor 43 which is controlled by field-weakening control.<br>
It is to be noted that the boundary between the engine/motor region (1) and the engine/motor region (5) is corrected such that, as the voltage of the batteries 21 drops, the boundary between the engine/motor regions (1) and (2) moves as indicated by an arrow mark to a region of a broken line which is wider.<br>
It is to be noted that such a construction that the relationship between the battery remaining amount and the threshold value for the throttle opening (accelerator opening) is determined in such a manner as illustrated in FIG. 23 and ON/OFF discrimination of the engine is performed as shown in FIG. 24 may be employed.  The relationship may be stored as a data table in a ROM in the control apparatus so that it may be referred to at any time.<br>
Where the battery remaining amount is, for example, 0 to 50 %, the threshold value is set, for example, to 20 %.<br>
Where the battery remaining amount is, for example, higher than 100 %, the threshold value is set, for example, to 85 %.  Where the battery remaining amount is, for example, 50 to 100 %, the threshold value exhibits a gradual increase.<br>
In particular, in the semi-automatic mode and the full automatic mode of FIG. 24, the threshold value for the accelerator opening at which operation of the engine is started is made variable within 20 to 85 % based on the battery remaining amount.<br>
Accordingly, as the battery remaining amount becomes small, engine driving is performed at an early stage from a condition wherein the accelerator opening is low.  Consequently, as shown in FIG. 25, the EV region becomes smaller comparing with that of the case of FIG. 13, and the engine/charging region can be widened as much.  In this instance, in the semi-automatic mode, V1 = 50 km/s, and in the full automatic mode, V1 = 40 km/s.<br>
Consequently, when the battery remaining amount is small, engine/charging can be performed frequently, and<br><br>
consumption of (the power of) the batteries can be prevented effectively.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effects due to the construction described above.<br>
Since a motor controlling apparatus for a hybrid car as set forth in claim 1 of the present invention is constructed such that it comprises current feedback control means for controlling a generator-motor so that a motor current of the generator-motor may be equal to an aimed current set based on the torque instruction value, torque feedback control means for controlling the generator-motor so that a driving wheel torque which is a torque of a driving wheel detected by a torque sensor unit may be equal to the torque instruction value, and motor control means for selecting one of an output from the current feedback control means and an output from the torque feedback control means based on an output from a motor revolution number sensor which detects a number of revolutions of the generator-motor and controlling the generator-motor based on the selected one output and, when the generator-motor rotates at a low speed, current feedback control by which the motor current can be controlled with a high degree of<br>
accuracy can be performed to protect the generator-motor from over-current, but in a high vehicle speed-high torque region, torque feedback control can be performed to effect control of the generator-motor including also the driving torque of the engine, the fuel consumption efficiency can be raised<br>
