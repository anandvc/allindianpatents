was added over a period of 15 min.<br>
After the above additions were completed, the temperature<br>

were then cooled to room temperature.<br>
The copolymers were characterised by means of proton NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. 10<br>
Example 5<br>
Detergency/antiredeposition performance<br>
15  Detergency and antiredeposition performance of the polymers were evaluated by a small scale wash method, using a laundry detergent composition having the following formulation:<br><br>

Linear al.kylbenzene sulphonate	6.00<br>
Sodium C12-C14 alcohol ethoxy sulphate 3EO	10.50<br>
Nonionic surfactant<br>

Sodium borate pentahydrate	2.13<br>
(Water to	100.00)<br><br>
    -  19  -<br>
This formulation has a pH of 7.0.  In the doseage 1 g/L and 2 g/L it has a pH of 8.8.<br>
Methodology 5<br>
The polymers were tested for their ability to enhance the removal of oily and clay/sebum soil from white cotton fabric, using an apparatus for simulating a soiling and wash procedure on a small scale. 10<br>
Usijig this apparatus, the fabric was soiled, and subjected to a simulated main wash procedure using wash liquors with and without the polymer according to the invention.<br>
15<br>
The apparatus<br>
The wash apparatus used allows different liquids to be simultaneously contacted with different regions of a single<br>
20  sheet of fabric.   The fabric sheet is clamped between an upper and lower block.  The fabric sheet is sandwiched between two rubber seals.  Both blocks and seals contain an 8 x 12 array of square cavities, which are aligned.  When blocks and fabrics are clamped together, liquids placed in<br>
25  individual wells do not leak or bleed through to other wells, due to the pressure applied by the blocks in the regions separating the wells.  The liquids are forced to flow back and forth through the fabric by means of a pneumatically actuated thin rubber membrane, which is placed<br>
30  between the fabrics and the lower block.  Repeated flexing<br><br>
-   20   -<br>
of the membrane away from and towards the fabrics results in fluid motion through the fabrics.<br>
Soiling<br>
For the oily soil evaluation, the dry fabric was placed on top of a 96 well polypropylene microtitre plate.   Oily soil (5 uL of dirty motor oil (15% weight in toluene)) was dispensed from a pipette, onto the centre of each of the 96 cells on .the cloth.  The stained fabrics were allowed to dry at room temperature for 24 hours.<br>
For clay/sebum soiling a standard cotton test cloth (AS9) was used.<br>
Wash<br>
The test fabric was then clamped in the washing apparatus, 200 uL doses of each wash solution were placed in appropriate wells.   The liquids flowed through the fabrics<br>
for 20 minutes, at 30 C with a flow cycle time of 1.5<br>
seconds.  After 20 minutes, the free liquid in the cells was poured off.  The blocks where then separated and the fabric removed, and thoroughly rinsed for 1 minute in 200 mL demineralised water.  The fabrics were allowed to dry for.24 hours.  Reflectance (AE or AR) was then measured.<br><br>

-   21   -<br>
Experimental conditions<br>
The experiments were carried out at product doses of 0.1,<br>
0.5 and 1.5 g/L, in water of 3 and 12 FH, the hardness<br>
being made up of three parts calcium to 1 part magnesium. The polymers were dosed separately at levels of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 g/1, and there was also a polymer-free control for each set of conditions.<br>
For the tests using oily soil (.dirty motor oil) , the results are "expressed as SRI (soil release index) , where SRI -  100 - AE<br>
For the tests using clay/sebum soil, the results are expressed as AR (image analysis, equivalent to AR at 460  run) .<br>
