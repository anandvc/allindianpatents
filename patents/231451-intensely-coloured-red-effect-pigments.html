				<td>Intensely coloured red effect pigments<br>
The present invention relates to intensely coloured red effect pigments<br>
comprising iron oxide-coated SiO2 flakes, where the total thickness of the<br>
effect pigments is not greater than 500 nm (+/- 30 nm). The present inven-<br>
tion likewise relates to processes for the preparation of these pigments in<br>
which SiO2 flakes are coated with iron oxide, where the thicknesses of the<br>
SiO2 flakes and the iron-oxide layers are selected in such a way that the<br>
total thickness of the red effect pigments is not greater than 500 nm<br>
(+/- 30 nm), and to the use of these pigments in cosmetics, paints, coatings,<br>
plastics, films, in security printing, in security features in documents and<br>
identity papers, tor colouring seed, for colouring foods or in medicament<br>
coatings and for the preparation of pigment compositions and dry<br>
preparations.<br>
The use of red lustre or effect pigments is widespread. Pigments of this<br>
type have become indispensable in automobile paints, decorative coatings<br>
of all types and in the colouring of plastics, in paints and printing inks and in<br>
applications in decorative cosmetics. In the matrix surrounding them, these<br>
pigments ideally align themselves parallel to the surface of the coating and<br>
exhibit their optical action through a complex interplay of interference, re-<br>
flection and absorption of the incident light. A bright colour and high lustre<br>
are the focus of interest for the various applications.<br>
Pigments of this type are generally prepared by coating flake-form mica<br>
with metal-oxide layers, in particular iron-oxide layers. Mica, in particular,<br>
has the disadvantage that the thickness of the substrate varies in a broad<br>
range and cannot be set specifically, which results in light transmission and<br>
reflection at the substrate occurring in a substantially uncontrollable man-<br>
ner, even in the case of transparent substrates, and therefore being unus-<br>
able in a specific manner.<br>
WO 93/08237 discloses flake-form red pigments which consist of a silicon<br>
dioxide matrix as substrate which is coated with an iron-oxide layer The<br>
thickness of the matrix here can be set in a broad range. The red pigments<br>
described in WO 93/08237 have the disadvantage that, when tilted towards<br>
flatter viewing angles, they exhibit a brownish hue, which is undesired.<br>
Rather, there is a need for intensely coloured red effect pigments having a<br>
pure red hue and high lustre. In addition, the substrates have a thickness of<br>
500 nm and the thicknesses of the applied layers are preferably 20-250 nm.<br>
Overall, pigments having a relatively large total thickness are thus obtained.<br>
However, this is unfavourable for many applications, since the applicational<br>
properties of the pigments are impaired, a phenomenon which is described,<br>
for example, by P. Hoffmann, W. Duschek, New Effect Pigments, in report<br>
volume DFG 41, 1999, 50, 123-132. In coating applications, for example,<br>
thick pigments exhibit problems with the target parallel alignment. The un-<br>
favourable geometry of the relatively thick pigment particles makes the<br>
desired alignment parallel to the surface more difficult in the binder system.<br>
Relatively thick pigment particles tend to line up at an angle to one another,<br>
and consequently the light is no longer reflected in the optimum direction<br>
and scattering effects reduce the directed lustre. In addition, applicational<br>
disadvantages arise, such as, for example, an increased haze effect (lustre<br>
fog) and a worse distinctness of image (DOI) of the pigment-containing<br>
coatings. Furthermore, colouristic disadvantages arise merely through the<br>
fact that the high mass of the individual particles for the same mass weight<br>
means that there is a considerably smaller number of pigment particles in<br>
the coating application. This has disadvantageous effects on the hiding<br>
power, the lustre and the overall colour impression. The desired properties<br>
therefore can only be achieved with difficulty in the case of thick pigment<br>
particles.<br>
The object was therefore to find red effect pigments having improved opti-<br>
cal properties, in particular having a pure red hue, which can be employed<br>
universally in a very wide variety of applications without exhibiting applica-<br>
tional disadvantages.<br>
The above-mentioned object is achieved by pigments according to the pre-<br>
sent invention. The present invention accordingly relates to intensely col-<br>
oured red effect pigments comprising iron oxide-coated SiO2 flakes, where<br>
the total thickness of the effect pigments is not greater than 500 nm<br>
(+/- 30 nm).<br>
The present invention likewise relates to processes for the preparation of<br>
these pigments in which SiO2 flakes are coated with iron oxide, where the<br>
thicknesses of the SiO2 flakes and the iron-oxide layers are selected in<br>
such a way that the total thickness of the red effect pigments is not greater<br>
than 500 nm (+/- 30 nm).<br>
The pigments according to the invention are distinguished by a particularly<br>
intense and pure red colour effect. The red effect pigments surprisingly<br>
exhibit only a very slight colour flop effect, or none at all, and are free from<br>
the interfering brown hue of other red pigments with iron-oxide layers. In<br>
addition, the pigments according to the invention have the advantage that<br>
they can be employed in a very wide variety of applications, where they<br>
exhibit improved applicational properties, for example a reduced haze effect<br>
and a better distinctness of image (DOI) in coating applications or a better<br>
skin feel in cosmetic formulations.<br>
Owing to the advantageous properties, the effect pigments according to the<br>
invention are universally suitable for a large number of applications of a<br>
very wide variety of types. The present invention accordingly also relates to<br>
the use of these pigments in cosmetics, paints, coatings, plastics, films, in<br>
security printing, in security features in documents and identity papers, for<br>
colouring seed, for colouring foods or in medicament coatings and for the<br>
preparation of pigment compositions and dry preparations.<br>
The pigments according to the invention are based on synthetic SiO2 flakes<br>
as substrate which have a uniform layer thickness and are preferably pre-<br>
pared in accordance with International Application WO 93/08237 on a con-<br>
tinuous belt by solidification and hydrolysis of a water-glass solution. Uni-<br>
form layer thickness here is taken to mean a layer-thickness tolerance of<br>
from 3 to 10%, preferably from 3 to 5%, of the total dry layer thickness of<br>
the particles. The flake-form silicon dioxide particles are generally in amor-<br>
phous form. Synthetic flakes of this type have the advantage over natural<br>
materials, such as, for example, mica, that the layer thickness can be<br>
adjusted with regard to the desired effects and the layer-thickness tolerance<br>
is limited.<br>
The diameter of the substrates is usually between 1 and 250 urn, preferably<br>
between 2 and 100 urn. Their thickness is between 250 and 400 nm and<br>
preferably from 330 to 350 nm. The average aspect ratio of the flake-form<br>
substrates, i.e. the ratio of the average length measurement value, which<br>
here corresponds to the average diameter, to the average thickness meas-<br>
urement value, is usually from 5 to 200, preferably from 20 to 150 and par-<br>
ticularly preferably from 30 to 120.<br>
The said substrates in the pigments according to the invention are coated<br>
with iron-oxide layers, in particular with haematite layers (α-Fe2O3). The<br>
thickness of the individual iron-oxide layers is between 30 and 150 nm,<br>
preferably from 50 to 130 nm. It is essential for the present invention that<br>
the total thickness of the red effect pigments is not greater than 500 nm<br>
(+/- 30 nm). The coating of the SiO2 flakes with iron oxide may be present<br>
either only on the two largest opposite surfaces or in a sheathing manner;<br>
the SiO2 flakes are preferably completely sheathed with iron oxide. In cross<br>
section, the following pigment structure arises from this:<br>
Fe2O3/SiO2/Fe2O3<br>
The sum of the thicknesses of the total of three layers must not exceed the<br>
requisite 500 nm (+/- 30 nm).<br>
In order to optimise the desired pure red hue, precise matching of the thick-<br>
nesses of the substrate and of the iron-oxide layers is advantageous. The<br>
following distributions of the thicknesses for the substrates and the individ-<br>
ual iron-oxide layers are particularly preferred here:<br>
Thickness of the Thickness of the two Total thickness of the<br>
SiO2 matrix [nm] Fe2O3 layers (each) [nm] red pigments [nm]<br>
250 125+/-15 500+/-30<br>
300 100+/-15 500+/-30<br>
350 75+/-15 500+/-30<br>
400 50+/-15 500+/-30<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the effect pigments<br>
according to the invention can furthermore be provided with an additional<br>
stabilising organic coating as outer layer. Examples of such coatings are<br>
given, for example, in EP 0 632 109, US 5,759,255, DE 43 17 019,<br>
DE 39 29 423, DE 32 35 017, EP 0 492 223, EP 0 342 533, EP 0 268 918,<br>
EP 0 141 174, EP 0 764 191, WO 98/13426 or EP 0 465 805, the disclo-<br>
sure content of which is incorporated herein by way of reference. Effect pig-<br>
ments comprising an organic coating, for example of organosilanes or<br>
organotitanates or organozirconates, additionally, besides the above-men-<br>
tioned optical properties, exhibit increased stability to weathering influ-<br>
ences, such as, for example, moisture and light, which is of particular inter-<br>
est for industrial coatings and in the automobile sector. The stabilisation<br>
can be improved by inorganic components of the additional coating. Over-<br>
all, the respective proportions for the additional stabilising coating should be<br>
selected in such a way that the optical properties of the effect pigments<br>
according to the invention are not significantly influenced.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to processes for the preparation of<br>
these pigments in which SiO2 flakes are coated with iron oxide, where the<br>
thicknesses of the SiO2 flakes and of the iron-oxide layers are selected in<br>
such a way that the total thickness of the red effect pigments is not greater<br>
than 500 nm (+/- 30 nm). The respective matching of the thicknesses of the<br>
substrates to the thicknesses of the applied iron-oxide layers has already<br>
been explained above.<br>
The coating with iron-oxide layers can be carried out by wet-chemical<br>
methods and/or by CVD or PVD processes.<br>
The processes according to the invention for the preparation of the effect<br>
pigments are preferably wet-chemical processes in which use can be made<br>
of the known wet-chemical coating technologies developed for the prepara-<br>
tion of pearlescent pigments, which are described, for example, in the fol-<br>
lowing publications:<br>
DE 14 67 468, DE 19 59 988, DE 20 09 566, DE 22 14 545, DE 22 15 191,<br>
DE 22 44 298, DE 23 13 331, DE 25 22 572, DE 31 37 808, DE 31 37 809,<br>
DE 31 51 343, DE 31 51 354, DE 31 51 355, DE 32 11 602, DE 32 35 017.<br>
For the coating, the SiO2 flakes are suspended in water and coated with<br>
iron oxide by addition and precipitation of corresponding inorganic metal<br>
compounds, with the pH necessary for the precipitation of iron oxide being<br>
set and kept constant by simultaneous addition of acid or base, and the<br>
coated substrate is subsequently separated off from the aqueous suspen-<br>
sion, dried and optionally calcined, with the layer thicknesses of the individ-<br>
ual layers being set in such a way that, after drying and optional calcination,<br>
the thickness of the pigment is not greater than 500 nm (+/- 30 nm).<br>
The calcination temperature is generally between 250 and 1000°C, in par-<br>
ticular between 350 and 900°C.<br>
In principle, CVD or PVD processes for the coating of particles with iron<br>
oxide are also suitable for the preparation of the pigments according to the<br>
invention. Processes of this type are described, for example, in W. Oster-<br>
tag, Nachr. Chem. Tech. Lab 1994, 42, 849. It is necessary here for the<br>
substrate to be kept in uniform motion during the vapour-deposition process<br>
in order that a homogeneous coating of all particle surfaces is ensured.<br>
In addition, in a process which is likewise in accordance with the invention,<br>
an organic coating can additionally be applied as outer layer. Examples of<br>
coating processes of this type are given, inter alia, in EP 0 632 109,<br>
US 5,759,255, DE 43 17 019, DE 39 29 423, DE 32 35 017, EP 0 492 223,<br>
EP 0 342 533, EP 0 268 918, EP 0 141 174, EP 0 764 191, WO 98/13426<br>
or EP 0 465 805. Examples of organic coatings and the associated advan-<br>
tages have already been described above under the structure of the pig-<br>
ments according to the invention. The process step of application of the<br>
organic coating can follow directly after the other steps of the process ac-<br>
cording to the invention. The substances applied here only have a propor-<br>
tion by weight of from 0.1 to 5% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 3% by<br>
weight, in the pigment as a whole.<br>
The effect pigments according to the invention can be employed in a variety<br>
of applications. Accordingly, the present invention likewise relates to the<br>
use of the pigments according to the invention in cosmetics, paints, coat-<br>
ings, plastics, films, in security printing, in security features in documents<br>
and identity papers, for colouring seed, for colouring foods or in medica-<br>
ment coatings and for the preparation of pigment compositions and dry<br>
preparations.<br>
In the case of cosmetics, the effect pigments according to the invention are<br>
particularly suitable for products and formulations in decorative cosmetics,<br>
such as, for example, nail varnishes, colouring powders, lipsticks or eye-<br>
shadows, soaps, toothpastes, etc. The effect pigments according to the<br>
invention can of course also be combined in the formulations with cosmetic<br>
raw materials and assistants of all types. These include, inter alia, oils, fats,<br>
waxes, film formers, preservatives and assistants which generally deter-<br>
mine the applicational properties, such as, for example, thickeners and<br>
Theological additives, such as, for example, bentonites, hectorites, silicon<br>
dioxide, Ca silicates, gelatine, high-molecular-weight carbohydrates and/or<br>
surface-active assistants, etc. The formulations comprising effect pigments<br>
according to the invention may be of the lipophilic, hydrophilic or hydropho-<br>
bic type. In the case of heterogeneous formulations having discrete aque-<br>
ous and non-aqueous phases, the particles according to the invention may<br>
be present in each case in only one of the two phases or alternatively dis-<br>
tributed over both phases.<br>
The pH values of the aqueous formulations can be between 1 and 14, pref-<br>
erably between 2 and 11 and particularly preferably between 5 and 8. The<br>
concentrations of the effect pigments according to the invention in the for-<br>
mulation are unlimited. They may - depending on the application - be<br>
between 0.001 (rinse-off products, for example shower gels) and 99% (for<br>
example lustre-effect articles for particular applications). The effect pig-<br>
ments according to the invention may furthermore also be combined with<br>
cosmetic active ingredients. Suitable active ingredients are, for example,<br>
insect repellents, UV A/BC protection filters (for example OMC, B3, MBC),<br>
anti-ageing active ingredients, vitamins and derivatives thereof (for example<br>
vitamin A, C, E, etc.), self-tanning agents (for example DHA, erythrulose,<br>
inter alia), and further cosmetic active ingredients, such as, for example,<br>
bisabolol, LPO, ectoine, emblica, allantoin, bioflavonoids and derivatives<br>
thereof.<br>
On use of the effect pigments in paints and coatings, all areas of application<br>
known to the person skilled in the art are possible, such as, for example,<br>
powder coatings, automobile paints, printing inks for gravure, offset, screen<br>
or flexographic printing, and coatings in outdoor applications. The paints<br>
and coatings here may be, for example, radiation-curing, physically drying<br>
or chemically curing. For the preparation of printing inks or liquid coatings, a<br>
multiplicity of binders, for example based on acrylates, methacrylates, poly-<br>
esters, polyurethanes, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, polyamide, polyvinyl<br>
butyrate, phenolic resins, maleic resins, starch or polyvinyl alcohol, amino<br>
resins, alkyd resins, epoxy resins, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene<br>
fluorides, polyvinyl chloride or mixtures thereof, in particular water-soluble<br>
grades, are suitable. The coatings can be powder coatings or water- or sol-<br>
vent-based coatings, where the choice of the coating constituents is subject<br>
to the general knowledge of the person skilled in the art. Common poly-<br>
meric binders for powder coatings are, for example, polyesters, epoxides,<br>
polyurethanes, acrylates or mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition, the effect pigments according to the invention can be used in<br>
films and plastics, thus, for example, in agricultural sheeting, infrared-<br>
reflective films and sheets, gift foils, plastic containers and mouldings for all<br>
applications known to the person skilled in the art. Suitable plastics for<br>
incorporation of the effect pigments according to the invention are all com-<br>
mon plastics, for example thermosets or thermoplastics. A description of<br>
the possible applications and suitable plastics, processing methods and<br>
additives is given, for example, in RD 472005 or in R. Glausch, M. Kieser,<br>
R. Maisch, G. Pfaff, J. Weitzel, Perlglanzpigmente [Pearlescent Pigments],<br>
Curt R. Vincentz Verlag, 1996, 83 ff., the disclosure content of which is<br>
incorporated herein.<br>
In addition, the effect pigments according to the invention are also suitable<br>
for use in security printing and in security-relevant features for, for example,<br>
counterfeiting-proof cards and identity papers, such as, for example, entry<br>
tickets, personal identity cards, banknotes, cheques and cheque cards and<br>
for other counterfeiting-proof documents. In the area of agriculture, the<br>
effect pigments can be used for colouring seed and other starting materials,<br>
in addition in the foods sector for pigmenting foods. The effect pigments<br>
according to the invention can likewise be employed for pigmenting coat-<br>
ings in medicaments, such as, for example, tablets or dragees.<br>
In the above-mentioned areas of application, the effect pigments according<br>
to the invention are likewise suitable for use in mixtures with organic dyes<br>
and/or pigments, such as, for example, transparent and opaque white, col-<br>
oured and black pigments, and with flake-form iron oxides, organic pig-<br>
ments, holographic pigments, LCPs (liquid crystal polymers) and conven-<br>
tional transparent, coloured and black lustre pigments based on metal<br>
oxide-coated flakes based on mica, glass, AI2O3, Fe2O3, SiO2, etc. The<br>
effect pigments according to the invention can be mixed with commercially<br>
available pigments and fillers in any ratio.<br>
Fillers which may be mentioned are, for example, natural and synthetic<br>
mica, nylon powder, pure or filled melamine resins, talc, glasses, kaolin,<br>
oxides or hydroxides of aluminium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, BiOCI, bar-<br>
ium sulfate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate,<br>
carbon, and physical or chemical combinations of these substances. There<br>
are no restrictions regarding the particle shape of the filler. It can be flake-<br>
form, spherical or needle-shaped, for example, in accordance with require-<br>
ments.<br>
The effect pigments according to the invention are furthermore suitable for<br>
the preparation of flowable pigment compositions and dry preparations<br>
comprising one or more particles according to the invention, binders and<br>
optionally one or more additives. The term dry preparations is also taken to<br>
mean preparations which comprise from 0 to 8% by weight, preferably from<br>
2 to 8% by weight, in particular from 3 to 6% by weight, of water and/or of a<br>
solvent or solvent mixture. The dry preparations are preferably in the form<br>
of pellets, granules, chips, sausages or briquettes and have particle sizes of<br>
0.2-80 mm. The dry preparations are used, in particular, in the preparation<br>
of printing inks and in cosmetic formulations.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all patent applications, patents and<br>
publications mentioned above is incorporated into this application by way of<br>
reference.<br>
The following examples are intended to explain the invention in greater<br>
detail, but without restricting it.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
100 g of SiO2 flakes (365 nm in thickness) are heated to 75°C in 2 I of<br>
demineralised water. 1120 ml of FeCI3 solution (corresponds to 130% of<br>
Fe2O3) are added with stirring. The pH of the reaction mixture is kept con-<br>
stant at 3 by addition of sodium hydroxide solution (30%). After addition of<br>
the FeCU solution, the pH is raised to pH 5 using sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(30%). The product is filtered off and rinsed with demineralised water. After<br>
drying at 110°C, the product is calcined at 800°C.<br>
The pigment prepared in this way exhibits the colour behaviour shown in<br>
Figure 1 (-A-).<br>
Comparative Example:<br>
100 g of SiO2 flakes (445 nm in thickness) are heated to 75°C in 1 I of<br>
demineralised water. 237 ml of FeCI3 solution (corresponds to 27.5% of<br>
Fe2O3) are added with stirring. The pH of the reaction mixture is kept con-<br>
stant at 3 by addition of sodium hydroxide solution (30%). After addition of<br>
the FeC l3 solution, the pH is raised to pH 5 using sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(30%). The product is filtered off and rinsed with demineralised water. After<br>
drying at 110°C, the product is calcined at 800°C.<br>
The pigment prepared in this way exhibits the colour behaviour shown in<br>
Figure 1 (-♦-).<br>
Figure 1 shows the colouristic situation through a comparison of effect pig-<br>
ments having different red hues and different colour flop behaviour. The<br>
colour curves here show the change in the colour values in the a,b colour<br>
system, which is obtained if a paint card containing the pigment is tilted<br>
from the perpendicular angle (90 degrees plan view) to 180 degrees (hori-<br>
zontal axis is the a axis, from left = green to right = red, vertical axis is the b<br>
axis, from bottom = blue to top = yellow).<br>
Typical iron-oxide mica pigments (-•-) are comparatively weak in colour<br>
and exhibit no colour flop. The typical brownish hue on tilting is not evident<br>
in the curve.<br>
A typical SiO2 flake pigment having an iron-oxide coating as described in<br>
WO 93/08237 (-♦-) does not exhibit a clear red in the initial hue. On tilting,<br>
a strong colour flop occurs; in the example it changes to green.<br>
The colouring of the pigment according to the invention (-A-) shows a<br>
saturated red which also remains a red on tilting. The colour always<br>
remains in one quadrant of the a,b colour system, and the colour flop is<br>
very small.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>

SiO2 flakes, where the total thickness of the effect pigments is not greater<br>
then 500 nm (+/- 30 nm).<br>
2. Effect pigments as claimed in claim 1, wherein the diameter of the SiO2<br>
flakes is between 1 and 250 μm and othe thickness of the SiO2 flakes is<br>
between 250 and 400 nm.<br>
3. Effect pigments as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the thickness of the<br>
SiO2 flakes is 250,300,350 or 400nm.<br>
4. Effect pigments as claimed in claims 1 to 3 wherein the iron oxide is<br>
haematite (α-Fe2O3).<br>
5. Effect pigments as claimed in one of claims 2 to 4, wherein the<br>
thickness of the iron-oxide layers is from 30 to 150 nm.<br>
6. Effect pigments as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein an organic<br>
coating is additionally applied to the effect pigments.<br>
7. Process for the prtparation of effect pigments as claimed in claim 1 wherein<br>
SiO2 flakes are coated with iron oxide by wet-chemical methods and/or by<br>
chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or plasma vapour deposition (PVD) processes,<br>
where the thickness of the SiO2 flakes end of the ion-oxide layers ere selected in<br>
such a way that the total thickness of the red effect pigments is not greater than<br>
500nm (+/- 30 nm).<br>
8. Process as claimed in claim 7 wherein the coating with iron oxide is<br>
carried out in such a way that the thickness of the layers is between 30 and 150<br>
nm.<br>
9. Cosmetics, paints, coatings, plastics, films , in security printing, in security<br>
features in documents and identity papers, for colouring seed, for colouring<br>
foods or in medicament coatings and for the preparation of pigment<br>
compositions and dry preparations comprising the effect pigments as claimed in<br>
claim 1.<br>
Dated this 26th day of DECEMBER, 2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to intensely coloured red effect pigments<br>
comprising iron oxide-coated SiO2 flakes, where the total thickness of the<br>
effect pigments is not greater than 500 nm (+/- 30 nm). The present invention<br>
likewise relates to processes for the preparation of these pigments in<br>
which SiO2 flakes are coated with iron oxide, where the thicknesses of the<br>
SiO2 flakes and of the iron-oxide layers are selected in such a way that the<br>
total thickness of the red effect pigments is not greater than 500 nm (+/- 30<br>
nm), and to the use of these pigments in cosmetics, paints, coatings, plastics,<br>
films, in security printing, in security features in documents and identity<br>
papers, for colouring seed, for colouring foods or in medicament coatings<br>
and for the preparation of pigment compositions and dry preparations.</td>
