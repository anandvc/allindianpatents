c][1,4]benzodiazepin-5-one with aliphatic chain length variations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs), a group of potent naturally occurring<br>
antitumour antibiotics from various Streptomyces species, are of considerable interest<br>
because of their ability to recognize and subsequently form covalent bonds to specific<br>
base sequence of double strand DMA (Dervan, P. B. Science 1989, 232, 464.; Hurley,<br>
L. H. J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 2027.; Thurston, D. E.; Thompson, A. S. Chem. Br. 1990,<br>
26, 767). Well-known members of this group include anthramycin, DC-81, sibiromycin,<br>
tomamycin, chicamycin and neothramycin.of A and B (Hurley, L. H. J. Antibiot. 1977,<br>
30, 349.; Schimizu, K.; Kawamoto, I.; Tomita, F.; Morimoto, M.; Fujimoto, K. J. Antibiot.<br>
1982, 35, 992.; Lown, J. W.; Joshua, A. V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979, 28, 2017.;<br>
Thurston, D. E.; Bose, D. S. Chem. Rev. 1994, 94, 433.; Molina, P.; Diaz, I.; Tarraga, A.<br>
Tetrahedron 1995, 51, 5617.; Kamal, A.; Rao, N. V. Chem. Commun. 1996, 385.;<br>
Kamal, A.; Reddy, B. S. P.; Reddy, B. S. N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 6803). The<br>
cytotoxicity and antitumour activity of these agents are attributed to their property of<br>
sequence selective covalent binding to the N2 of guanine in the minor groove of duplex<br>
DNA via an acid-labile aminal bond to the electrophilic imine at the N10-C11 position<br>
(Kunimoto, S.; Masuda, T.; Kanbayashi, N.; Hamada, M.; Naganawa, H.; Miyamoto, M.;<br>
Takeuchi, T.; Unezawa, H. J. Antibiot., 1980, 33, 665.; Kohn, K. W. and Speous, C. L. J.<br>
Mol. Biol., 1970, 51, 551.; Hurley, L. H.; Gairpla, C. and Zmijewski, M. Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Acta., 1977, 475, 521.; Kaplan, D. J. and Hurley, L. H. Biochemistry, 1981, 20,<br>
7572). The molecules have a right-handed twist, which allows them to follow the<br>
curvature of the minor groove of B-form double-stranded DNA spanning three base<br>
pairs. A recent development has been the linking of two PBD units through their C-8<br>
positions to give bisfunctional-alkylating agents capable of cross-linking DNA (Thurston,<br>
D. E.; Bose, D. S.; Thomson, A. S.; Howard, P. W.; Leoni, A.; Croker, S. J.; Jenkins, T.<br>
C.; Neidle, S. and Hurley, L H. J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 8141).<br>
Recently, PBD dimers have been developed that comprise of two C2-exomethylene<br>
substituted DC-81 subunits tethered through their C-8 position via an inert<br>
propanedioxy linker (Gregson, S. J.; Howard, P. W.; Hartely, J. A.; Brooks, N. A.;<br>
Adams, L. J.; Jenkins, T. C.; Kelland, L. R. and Thurston, D. E. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44,<br>
737). A non-cross-linking mixed imine-amide PBD dimers have been synthesized that<br>
have significant DNA binding ability and potent antitumour activity (Kamal, A.; Ramesh,<br>
G. Laxman, N.; Ramulu, P.; Srinivas, O.; Neelima, K.; Kondapi, A. K.; Srinu, V. B.;<br>
Nagarajaram, H. M. J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4679). However, the clinical efficacy for<br>
these antibiotics is hindered by several limitations, such as poor water solubility,<br>
cardiotoxicity, development of drug resistance and metabolic inactivation. Due to the<br>
excellent activity of these molecules, there is need to develop novel derivatives which<br>
are devoid of above limitations.<br>
Benzothiazoles are small synthetic molecules that contain a benzene ring fused<br>
to a thiazole ring. These simple molecules have shown remarkable antitumour<br>
properties and some of them are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials (Shi, D.-F.;<br>
Bradshaw, T. D.; Wrigley, S.; McCall, C. J.; Lelieveld, P.; Fichtner, I.; Stevens, M. F. G.<br>
J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39, 3375; Kashiyama, E.; Hutchinson, I.; Chua, M.-S.; Stinson, S.<br>
F.; Phillips, L. R.; Kaur, G.; Sausville, E, A.; Bradshaw, T. D.; Westwell, A. D.; Stevens,<br>
M. F. G. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4172; Hutchinson, I.; Chua, M.-S.; Browne, H. L.;<br>
Trapani, V.; Bradshaw, T. D.; Westwell, A. D.; Stevens, M. F. G. J. Med. Chem. 2001,<br>
44, 1446). Recently Westwell and coworkers have prepared a series of benzothiazole<br>
derivatives and evaluated for anticancer activity, One of these analogues has shown<br>
excellent anticancer activity (Mortimer, C. G.; Wells, G.; Crochard, J.-P.; Stone, E. L.;<br>
Bradshaw, T. D.; Stevens, M. F. G.; Westwell, A. D. J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 179). The<br>
structurally related benzoxazoles have also been reported to possess anticancer activity<br>
(Kumar, D.; Jacob, M. R.; Reynold, M. B.; Kerwin, S. M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002, 10,<br>
3994; Gong, B.; Hong, F.; Kohm, C.; Bonham, L.; Klein, P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.<br>
2004, 14, 1455). Based on the potent anticancer activity of pyrrolo[2,1-<br>
c][1,4]benzodiazepines, benzothiazoles and benzoxazoles, new PBD hybrids have been<br>
designed and synthesized by linking benzothiazole and benzoxazole moieties at C8-<br>
position of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine with varying alkane and alkylamide<br>
spacers.<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration of the working of the<br>
invention in actual practice and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of<br>
present invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
To a solution of (2S)-N-[4-(3-bromobutyl)oxy-5-methoxy-2-nitrobenz oyl)<br>
pyrrolidine-2-carboxarbaldehyde diethylthioacetal 2a (535 mg, 1 mmol) in acetone (10<br>
mL) was added anhydrous K2CO3 (552 mg, 4 mmol) and the 4-(benzothiazol-2-<br>
yl)phenol 3a (227 mg, 1 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 48 h. After<br>
completion of the reaction as indicated by TLC, potassium carbonate was removed by<br>
suction filtration and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product thus<br>
obtained was purified by column chromatography using ethylacetate-hexane (1:1) as<br>
eluant to afford pure compound of 4a (511 mg, 75%).<br>
1H NMR (CDCI3): 8 8.0 (d, 2H, J = 8.8 Hz), 7.9 (d, 1H, J = 8 Hz), 7.7 (s, 1H), 7.3-7.5 (m,<br>
3H), 7.0 (d, 2H, J= 8.8 Hz), 6.8 (s, 1H), 4.9 (d, 1H, J = 3.7 Hz), 4.7 (m, 1H), 4.2 (m, 4H),<br>

ESIMS:m/z683(lvr+1).<br>
To compound 4a (682 mg, 1 mmol) in methanol (20 mL) was added SnCI2.2H2O<br>
(1.125 g, 5 mmol) and refluxed for 5 h or until the TLC indicated that reaction was<br>
completed. The methanol was evaporated under vacuum, the aqueous layer was then<br>
carefully adjusted to pH 8 with 10% NaHCO3 solution and then extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate and chloroform (2x30 mL and 2x30 mL). The combined organic phase was<br>
dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated under vacuum to afford the crude amino<br>
diethylthioacetal 5a (522 mg, 80%), which was used directly in the next step.<br>
A solution of 5a (652 mg, 1 mmol), HgCI2 (613 mg, 2.26 mmol) and CaCO3 (246<br>
mg, 2.46 mmol) in acetonitrile-water (4:1) was stirred slowly at room temperature for<br>
overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (30 mL) filtered through a<br>
celite pad. The clear organic supernatant was extracted with saturated 5% NaHCO3 (20<br>
mL), brine (20 mL) and the combined organic phase was dried (Na2SO4). The organic<br>
layer was evaporated under vacuum and purified by column chromatography using<br>
MeOH-CHCI3 (4%) to give compound 9a (316 mg, 60%). This material was repeatedly<br>
evaporated from CHCI3 in vacuum to generate the imine form.<br>

(10 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.00 + 0.01) containing CT-DNA (100<br>
urn in phosphate) and the PBD (20 urn) have been prepared by addition of concentrated<br>
PBD solutions in DMSO to obtain a fixed [PBD]/[DNA] molar ratio of 1:5. The DNA-PBD<br>
solutions have been incubated at 37 °C for 0 and 18 h prior to analysis. Samples have<br>
been monitored at 260 nm using a Beckman DU-800 spectrophotometer fitted with high<br>
performance temperature controller, and heated at 1 °C min"1 in the 40-110 °C range.<br>
DNA helix-&gt;coil transition temperatures (7m) have been obtained from the maxima in<br>
the d(/\26o)/dT derivative plots. Drug-induced alterations in DNA melting behavior are<br>
given by: A7m = 7m(DNA + PBD) - 7m(DNA alone), where the 7m value for the PBD-free<br>
CT-DNA is 69.1 ± 0.01. The fixed [PBD]/[DNA] ratio used has not resulted in binding<br>
saturation of the host DNA duplex for any compound examined.<br>
The DNA binding activity for these novel C8-linked benzothiazole, benzoxazole-<br>
PBD hybrids has been examined by thermal denaturation studies using calf thymus<br>
(CT) DNA. Melting studies show that these compounds stabilize the thermal helix -&gt; coil<br>

Anticancer activity: In vitro biological activity studies were carried out at the National<br>
Cancer Institute (USA).<br>
The compounds were evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity against sixty<br>
human tumour cells derived from nine cancer types (leukemia, non-small-cell lung,<br>
colon, CMS, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, and breast cancer) as shown in Table 3. For<br>
each compound, dose response curves for each cell line were measured at a minimum<br>
of five concentrations at 10 fold dilutions. A protocol of 48 h continuous drug exposure<br>
was used and a sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein assay was used to estimate cell<br>
viability or growth. The concentration causing 50% cell growth inhibition (GI50), total cell<br>
growth inhibition (TGI 0%growth) and 50% cell death (LC50, -50% growth) compared<br>
with the control was calculated. The mean graph midpoint values of logic TGI and log™<br>
LC50 as well as logio GI50 for 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d are listed in Table 2. As demonstrated<br>
by mean graph pattern, compound 9d exhibits an interesting profile of activity and<br>
