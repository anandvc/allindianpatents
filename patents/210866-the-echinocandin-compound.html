Candida albicans membranes were purified according to the process described by Tang et al Antimicrob. Agents Chemother 35, 99-103, 1991. 22.5 ug of the membrane proteins are incubated in a mixture of 2Mm of 14C-UDP glucose (specific activity = 0.34 mCi./mmol, 50 ug of α-amylase, 1Mm of dithiotreitol (DTT), IMm EDTA, lOOMm NaF, 7µM of GTP-y-S, 1M of sucrose and 50Mm of Tris-HCL (pH 7.8) in a volume of lOOµl. The medium is incubated at 25°C for 1 hour and the reaction is terminated by the addition of TCA at a final concentration of 5%. The reaction mixture is transferred onto a pre-wetted glass fibre filter. The filter is washed, dried and its radioactivity is counted.<br>
The mulundocandine is used as a positive control. Checking the vehicle is carried out with the same quantity of DMSO 1%. The results obtained show that the products of the invention have a good activity in this test in particular the products of Examples 9, 11 and 14.
