				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR VOICE ACCESS TO INTERNET-BASED<br>
INFORMATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the Internet. More particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to a system and method for voice access to Internet-based<br>
information.<br>
The Internet has developed into a medium by which a person using a<br>
computer connected to the Internet can access a virtually limitless amount of information.<br>
The ability to access information via the Internet can be provided in a variety of different<br>
ways. Sometimes information is provided by Internet search engines, which typically<br>
search the Internet for key words or phrases and then provide a list of web sites which<br>
include the search words or phrases in the web page, such as, its text or embedded<br>
identifiers (e.g., metatags). Information is also accessible via the Internet by individual<br>
web sites. Individual web sites provide a wide variety of information and services which<br>
are both time-critical and not time dependent.<br>
Unfortunately, while the Internet provides users with the potential to access<br>
a tremendous amount of information, finding useful Internet-based information is often<br>
time-consuming and cumbersome. Further, it is difficult to find and compare the same<br>
information available at multiple individual web sites because the same information can be<br>
organized in many different ways, described in many different forms, and changed at many<br>
different times. Added to these inherent difficulties with the Internet is the simple fact that<br>
a person cannot access the information available on the Internet without having a computer<br>
or other such electronic device which is connected to the Internet via an Internet Service<br>
Provider (ISP). Furthermore, to effectively find desired Internet-based information, a<br>
person must learn how to locate information via the Internet. As such, persons without<br>
computers, people without connections to ISPs, people without appropriate software, and<br>
people without experience or training on use of the Internet are limited from access to<br>
Internet-based information. These factors contribute to reasons why industry experts<br>
estimate that by the end of 1999, only 30% of the United States population has ever<br>
accessed the Internet, or "surfed the web." (Statistics from Forrester Research, October<br>
1999).<br>
Hence, it is desirable to provide a system and method by which people can<br>
access Internet-based information without directly using a computer, having a personal ISP<br>
connection, or gaining experience or training on use of the Internet. In addition, it is<br>
desirable to provide a system and method which allows people to obtain Internet-based<br>
information using convenient and readily available means, such as, by way of voice over a<br>
public telephone.<br>
Many challenges have heretofore made such a system and method<br>
impossible. For example, people using such a system and method would want to have the<br>
information quickly or, at least, within some tolerable amount of time. Such speed is<br>
difficult. Even with conventionally high speed computers and fast communication<br>
connections, the delay required to access the Internet has made many people call it the<br>
"world wide wait" instead of the world wide web. Another challenge to such a system and<br>
method is the recognition of voice communications. Conventional voice recognition<br>
technology is slow and inaccurate. Convenient and meaningful access to Internet-based<br>
information by voice would require simple, quick, and accurate voice recognition. Yet<br>
another challenge to such a system and method is how to provide free access io Internet-<br>
based information while financially supporting the service. Conventional advertising on<br>
the Internet requires the ability to see advertising information, such as "banners", and<br>
make some manual selection, such as "clicking" the banner, to get more information on the<br>
advertised product or service.<br>
Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned capabilities, it is desirable to<br>
provide a system and method by which people can gain quick and accurate voice access to<br>
Internet-based information free of charge. It is farther desirable to provide a system and<br>
method by which people can access a wide variety of Internet-based information by calling<br>
one telephone number.<br>

using voice over telephone to access, process, and carry out transactions over the Internet.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is related to a system and method for<br>
determining if one web site has the same information as another web site. Even yet<br>
another aspect of the present invention relates to a system and method for advertising using<br>
an Internet voice portal. Still yet another aspect of the present invention relates to a system<br>
and method for non-programming development of rules used in the transformation of<br>
Internet-based information. Another aspect of the present invention is related to a system<br>
and method for tunneling user responses hi an Internet voice portal system hi order to<br>
determine a desired item. Another aspect of the present invention is related to a system<br>
and method for the transformation and canonicalization of systematically structured data.<br>
In one embodiment, a computer system is used which has a central<br>
processing unit (CPU) that executes sequences of instructions contained in a memory.<br>
More specifically, execution of the sequences of instructions causes the CPU to perform<br>
steps, which are described below. The instructions may be loaded into a random access<br>
memory (RAM) for execution by the CPU from a read-only memory (ROM), a mass<br>
storage device, or some other persistent storage.1 In other embodiments, hardwired<br>
circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions to<br>
implement the present invention. Thus, the embodiments described herein are not limited<br>
to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software, nor to any particular<br>
source for the instructions executed by the.computer system.<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates a connection between a voice portal 10 and a network<br>
20. In an exemplary embodiment, network 20 is the Internet, a worldwide network of<br>
computer networks that use the TCP/IP network protocols to facilitate data transmission<br>
and exchange. In alternative embodiments, network 20 is any type of network, such as, a<br>
virtual private network (VPN). Network 20 preferably provides communication with<br>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) Web pages 30 and 40. Web pages 30 and 40<br>
include a variety of data on a variety of Web servers. Network 20 also provides<br>
communication with non-voice portal 50 which couples computers 52 and 54 and a service<br>
56 including a database 58 to network 20. Service 56 is any type of company, content or<br>
service provider with a connection to network 20. Database 58 is a storage medium for<br>
data and may be an optical, magnetic, or any other suitable storage medium.<br>
Generally, voice portal 10 is implemented as a network of servers. Servers<br>
can be configured by software. Preferably, the servers include a significant amount of<br>
read/write memory including disc drives and other storage. In general, users access voice<br>
portal 10 via telephones, such as, a cell phone 12 or a standard telephone 14 by calling a<br>
telephone number (using the plain old telephone service (POTS)) which initiates<br>
communication between the telephones and voice portal 10. Alternatively, other types of<br>
telephone service can be utilized to communicate voice or voice data to portal 10. The<br>
portal 10 can be connected to telephones 12 and 14 via a variety of lines, networks, and<br>
stations. Advantageously, voice portal 10 provides for voice communication with the user.<br>
Voice portal 10 allows the user access to information and services from web pages 30 and<br>
40 as well as other sources available via network 20. Such access is provided in a quick<br>
and efficient way by voice portal 10 continually retrieving, organizing, and storing<br>
information from a variety of web sites and Internet services. Other user interface<br>
platforms may also be provided for using voice portal 10. Such user interface platforms<br>
include, for example, WAP (wireless application protocol) and web interfaces.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates exemplary functional operations carried out by voice<br>
portal 10. These functions may be carried out in any variety of ways, including any<br>
number of physical structures. In an exemplary embodiment, voice portal 10 includes a<br>
user interface 110, an advertising subsystem 120, a customer management subsystem 130,<br>
an existant subsystem 140, a fusion engine 150, an update engine 160, and a database 170.<br>
User interface 110 coordinates voice communications between voice portal<br>
10 and the user. User interface 110 can be either via speech, via the Internet or "world<br>
wide web" (WWW), via a wireless application protocol (WAP) interface, or any other<br>
platform interface. In an exemplary embodiment, user interface is speech oriented. In<br>
such a speech oriented embodiment, user interface 110 uses word-based automatic speech<br>
recognition (ASR) for accepting user input wherever possible. User interface 110 can use<br>
a speech recognition software package, such as, Speech Works provided by Speech Works<br>
International of Boston, MA. For high rates of speech recognition, user interface 110<br>
advantageously utilizes a funneling process which funnels user response to a set of<br>
recognizable answers. Funneling is described further with reference to FIGURE 34. User<br>
interface 110 also uses spelling-based ASR for accepting user input when word-based ASR<br>
is not possible. Finally, user interface 110 uses keypad entry for accepting user input only<br>
when advantageous to user. The key entry utilizes the keys on telephones 12 and 14<br>
(FIGURE 4).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, user interface 110 performs one or more of<br>
the following tasks: (1) Identify a user with a phone number and other user-specific<br>
information. (2) Start a new session for a given user on a given platform. (3) Add a new<br>
interaction for a given user on a given platform. (4) Update a user's preference within the<br>
set of vertical domains of interest available in voice portal 10. (5) Enable or disable user<br>
preferences for that vertical domain of interest. (6) Update a user's expertise level either<br>
generally or within a specific vertical. (7) Update a user's demographic or personal<br>
information (as well as credit card information). (8) Update a user's session state with user<br>
interface-specific information. (9) Add a new credit card to the database. (10) Update an<br>
existing credit card with new information. (11) Identify a credit card with the credit card<br>
type and number and check if it is in the database already. (12) Set the list of vertical<br>
domains available to the user and its order. (13) End a user's session normally. (14) Notify<br>
customer management subsystem 130 that the user's session abnormally terminated into<br>
some defined status (e.g., call dropped, session timeout). (15) Determine the most recent<br>
session of a user given a certain platform, such that it is possible to resume a session if a<br>
session was abnormally terminated (e.g., dropped call, session time-out), and return the<br>
session state that was stored. User interface 110 can perform additional functions related<br>
to identification, session, user, and payment protocols.<br>
Advertising subsystem 120 coordinates activities related to the<br>
advertisements to be presented to the user during a communication session. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, advertising subsystem 120 includes advertisements, such as,<br>
sponsored advertisements, advertisements targeted to particular users, and permission-<br>
based advertisements which are presented only after an affirmative request from the user.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, advertising subsystem 120 provides one or more of<br>
functions: (1) Choose an advertisement to play based on the user, session, location, content<br>
and item being explored. (2) Record that an advertisement was played and if it was<br>
completed or not. (3) Record that a speak-through (i.e., as described below, an<br>
advertisement where the user selectively chooses to hear more on an advertised subject)<br>
was made. (4) Store customer and session information within a bean so that repeated<br>
database calls are not needed. (5) Create a record for a company that provides<br>
advertisements, and be able to identify one. (6) Create an advertisement and an<br>
advertisement's contract to be stored in the database (as an advertisement may have<br>
different contracts for usage on the system). (7) Create a new sales employee or employer<br>
contact for Advertising sales purposes. (8) Update an advertisement and/or the contract of<br>
that advertisement. (9) Update an advertisement company to change contact information<br>
and address information. (10) Update sales employees and employer contacts. (11)<br>
Place/remove an advertisement in/from the active list. (12) Mark the advertisement's<br>
contract to be completed or incomplete based on external information. (13) Display a list of<br>
active advertisements based on the advertisement type. (14) Display a list of advertisements<br>
relating to a company based on criteria of either inactive, active, incomplete, complete or<br>
simply all the advertisements. (15) Display a list of contracts relating to an advertisement<br>
based on the above criteria. (16) Display a list of contracts relating to a sales' employee<br>
based on the above criteria. (17) Retrieve the completed listing of an employee, company,<br>
advertisement or advertisement contract by simply passing in a unique identifier. (18)<br>
Search the database for near string matches of employee, company, advertisement and<br>
advertisement contract existants. (19) Keep track of the deliveries paid for a company on a<br>
specific contract and be able to update the outstanding balance of the company. (20) Search<br>
the update logs to make sure that no data integrity errors are present. (21) Create and<br>
modify a playlist needed to store advertisements for a specific genre.<br>
A variety of different methods may be used to carry out each of these<br>
operations. Advertising operations are described further with reference to FIGURE 36.<br>
Advertising subsystem 120 can perform additional functions related to identification,<br>
session, user, and payment protocols. The advertising techniques disclosed herein can also<br>
be used with a conventional personal computer (PC) interface web connection.<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 coordinates the management of<br>
information related to the user and the user's use of voice portal 10. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, customer management subsystem 130 acquires information on the user, such<br>
as, preferences and demographics, which are selectively used by user interface 110,<br>
advertising subsystem 120, and other functions of voice portal 10. Customer management<br>
subsystem 120 can perform additional functions related to identification, session, user, and<br>
payment protocols. Although subsystems 110, 120 and 130 are described separately, the<br>
operations of each can be integrated in a single unit without departing from the principles<br>
of the invention.<br>
User Interface (UI) 110 and customer management subsystem 130 interact to<br>
provide for the selection of vertical domains and the access of Internet-based information.<br>
Vertical domains categorize various fields or areas from which a user may select within<br>
voice portal 10. In order for UI 110 to communicate effectively with a user, certain<br>
preferences and user facts must be ascertained and understood either passively or actively.<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 stores such information into database 170.<br>
Alternatively, a separate customer database could maintain such information.<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 acquires information needed to<br>
determine customer preferences and facts from UI 110. UI 110 passes data into customer<br>
management subsystem 130, which processes it, and then relays it to at least one database.<br>
Further, there are the updates of preferences in existant subsystem 140 for further parsing.<br>
Then, existant subsystem 140 passes information such as user preferences and facts back to<br>
UI 110.<br>
Advantageously, customer management subsystem 130 is modifiable and<br>
extensible without making response times appreciably longer. As such, the process to add<br>
new vertical domains to voice portal 110 is rapid and consistent. The type of customer<br>
facts and demographics can never be completely defined, as new vertical domains can<br>
always be added.<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 records all transactions made by users<br>
that are subscribed and unsubscribed via a database. Customer management subsystem 130<br>
also records items that the user locates in a formed history list and tracks the collections<br>
that the user looked at (on the web site and through WAP devices).<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 identifies subscribed customers<br>
whenever possible, and as passively as possible. Thus, recognition of customers preferably<br>
takes place via some sort of identification key, such as, for example, a telephone number<br>
and an ID ("PIN") upon entering a system. This identification preferably leads to certain<br>
preferences associated with the customer and experience level of a customer within each set<br>
of preferences. Additionally, the system allows for an additional level of identification<br>
(e.g. password identification) before authorizing a purchase to be made against stored<br>
credit card information.<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 maintains, within each of the vertical<br>
domains, a set of preferences to facilitate the user interactions via voice portal 10. For<br>
example, in an exemplary embodiment, customer management subsystem 130 gathers<br>
information from the customer in order to further help determine what type of advertising<br>
to give to the customer, and how to improve the customer's service. Customer<br>
management subsystem 130 maintains customer preferences appropriate to each supported<br>
domain and updates customer data from data sources dynamically. For example, in the<br>
Auctions domain of interest, current bid status updated on user request. Voice portal 10<br>
advantageously presents user data with currency appropriate to the domain.. For example,<br>
in the Auctions domain of interest, bids are always current to within seconds. In the e-<br>
commerce domain of interest, pricing information is current when purchase price is<br>
presented.<br>
Advantageously, customer management subsystem 130 provides reporting<br>
and analysis to allow determination of which users are accessing which services. Further,<br>
customer management subsystem 130 provides reporting on session and transaction history<br>
by different demographic segment such as, for example, determining which services are<br>
accessed by users from a certain income bracket, gender, or age group. Customer<br>
management subsystem 130 also provides reporting of relatedness based on actual use<br>
(e.g., the ability to report what other services are accessed by users who are interested in<br>
movies).<br>
In order to continually add value and transition with users from one platform<br>
to another (for example from the phone to the web, or from the phone to WAP), customer<br>
management subsystem 130 advantageously supports personalization features to improve<br>
customers experience with the services. In addition to personalization, other sources of<br>
"stickiness" (customers "sticking' with the service in light of competition) includes the<br>
support of community features such as networks of friends or of folks with common<br>
interests. Thus, customers tend to be more loyal to the particular service provider if<br>
personalization features and community features are included with customer management<br>
subsystem 130.<br>
To support any adaptation of service (or advertising) to customer behavior,<br>
customer management subsystem 130 advantageously tracks use of services. Further in the<br>
area of interface evaluation, typical user explorations of interface hierarchies may help<br>
identify problem areas or very useful areas, or correlated sets of sub-features in single<br>
sessions. Another example of an important attribute the services of voice portal 10 is<br>
timing. For example, the use of a "barge-in" (where a user can interrupt with an answer<br>
before a list or prompt is finished) can signify a more advanced user and a string of barge-<br>
in selections to a single sub-tree repeatedly for a specific user may advantageously be<br>
detected by customer management subsystem 130 and lead to an opportunity for a short-cut<br>
- either a general one, or possibly a customer-specific one.<br>
An aspect of "stickiness" is adaptation of services to a customer's<br>
preferences. While this can include relatively simple features such as customer information<br>
retention in support of non-repetitive "sign-up" or "purchasing" data-entry requirements, it<br>
can also include preferences for navigation of particular sub-trees of interaction in different<br>
front-ends, and preferences for service/vendor ordering or selection. As an example of<br>
vendor preference or ordering, a user may select a "preferred vendor," allowing voice<br>
portal 10 to limit a list of vendors for a found product to two : cheapest and preferred.<br>
Vertical preferences should be passively set based on user's actions That is,<br>
after requesting a particular attribute more than once, a passive preference would be set.<br>
Alternatively, preferences are dynamic, changing based on user's actions. Preferably,<br>
users are able to override all passive preferences, by setting or resetting them either<br>
through voice or web interfaces.<br>
Customer management subsystem 130 can pull user preferences, such as<br>
stock information, weather preferences and (the like) from personalized web pages such as<br>
My Yahoo, and MyExcite. The personalized web pages can be previously created by the<br>
user via a conventional Internet connection. Alternatively, the personalized web pages can<br>
be built by customer management subsystem 130 in response to user voice commands.<br>
These pages can then be translated to be used with voice portal 10. General preferences<br>
can advantageously be used as a default preference if specific vertical preferences or<br>
current call preferences do not exist.<br>
The following is a listing of exemplary vertical preference requirements and<br>
their descriptions. Each preference is used differently throughout each interface. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the only preference for weather is the weather for the location that<br>
the customer requests. By default, the user's location is their ZIP code. The Most<br>
Commonly Used Location could be overridden by a current call location, if available.<br>
In the Sports domain of interest, there are several different preferences to be<br>
looked at. First, favorite sports are an option. Certain sports scores, schedules, and<br>
standings can also be sent to the user. For web sites, exclusivity can be used to not send<br>
advertisements and information of certain sports. For example, one user may not want to<br>
hear information on hockey games, rather the user wants baseball information. Second, the<br>
preference granularity can be increased with certain teams being preferred over others. In<br>
each of these granularities, it is possible that a most-recently used (MRU) list of limited<br>
choices is vised to determine the preference list. Besides type of sport and team<br>
preferences, preferred events may be used.<br>
In the Movies domain of interest, needed preferences include locality of<br>
customer and locality of theaters, types of movies (e.g., thrillers, horror, action, etc.),<br>
ratings of movies (AA, G, R, etc...), and movies with a customer's favorite<br>
actors/actresses in the movies. Each of these preferences may be listed in an MRU list of<br>
limited choices.<br>
In the Traffic domain of interest, the main preference used would be specific<br>
routes that the customer would like to use to reach a destination, with an attribute being the<br>
time (the current being the default). Thus, an MRU list of limited routes could make up<br>
the preference list of a customer.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, there is a two-level hierarchy of preferences<br>
for the Stocks domain of interest. First, there is a preference for a market list and second,<br>
within each market, there is a preference of which stocks and indices to look at. Again, an<br>
MRU list of TBD choices of markets and stocks may be tabulated. Other vertical domains<br>
of interest may include restaurants, concerts and live events, taxis, and airline reservations.<br>
Referring still to FIGURE 2, existant subsystem 140 coordinates access by<br>
user interface 110, advertising subsystem 120, customer management subsystem 130,<br>
fusion engine 150, and update engine 160 to database 170. Existant subsystem 140<br>
manages the creation, adaptation, and manipulation of the data structures contained in<br>
database 170. Data contained in database 170 is gathered from Internet sources by update<br>
engine 160. In an exemplary embodiment, the data structure used in database 190 is based<br>
on a hierarchy of "existants" or things and their relationships and associations with each<br>
other. Advantageously, the ability to replicate and modify information in database 170 is<br>
more easily done because database 170 interacts only with existant subsystem 140.<br>
Existants and their creation are described further with reference to FIGURES 4-10.<br>
Specifically, an exemplary data structure model for existants is described with reference to<br>
FIGURES 4-6 although various other structures for existants can be utilized. Creation and<br>
updating of existants are described with reference to FIGURES 7-10.<br>
Fusion engine 150 determines whether two existants are the same and, if so,<br>
fuses the existants to form a third canonical existant. As such, fusion engine 150<br>
establishes whether information gathered from one source is related or the same as<br>
information gathered from another source. Functions of fusion engine 150 are described<br>
further with reference to FIGURES 25, 26, and 27.<br>
Update engine 160 retrieves information from the Internet to update<br>
information and attributes contained in database 170. In an exemplary embodiment, update<br>
engine 160 utilizes "spiders" which retrieve information from the Internet in order to<br>
update information in database 170. Operations of update engine 160 are described further<br>
with reference to FIGURES 7 and 8.<br>
Database 170 stores information used by voice portal 10, such as, customer<br>
data, advertising information, and product and services information. Information in<br>
database 170 is stored into existants, existant attributes, existant relationships, and existant<br>
associations. What existants are, how they are formed, how they are related to each other,<br>
and how they relate to the functionalities of voice portal 10 are described further below. In<br>
alternative embodiments, multiple databases may be used for specific types of information,<br>
such as, customer data, advertising information, and operations records.<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates an exemplary physical layout of voice portal 10.<br>
These physical structures are by way of example only. Other structures may be used in<br>
combination with or in lieu of those shown. In an exemplary embodiment, voice portal 10<br>
includes front end servers 210, a front-to-back network 220, back end servers 230, and a<br>
back-end network 240. Users communicate via telephone with one of the front end servers<br>
210, which is coupled to back end servers 230 by front-to-back network 220.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, back end servers 230 include a proxy manager<br>
245, proxies 250, beans 260, and a database 270. Proxy managers 245 receive requests for<br>
information from one of front end servers 210 via front-to-back network 220. Proxy<br>
managers 245 communicate via back end network 240 to determine work load levels at<br>
each of proxy managers 245. Once an appropriate proxy manager 245 is determined, the<br>
appropriate proxy manager 245 pulls a free proxy from a pool of free proxies 250 and<br>
assigns the proxy to a bean 260. Bean 260 is associated with database 270 in order to<br>
retrieve information, insert information, search existants or existant relationships, or<br>
perform any other function possible with database 270.<br>
The virtual database structure described with reference to FIGURE 3 is<br>
designed to deliver information garnered from Internet 20 to users of voice portal 10 in a<br>
timely and highly utilitarian way. People need and use information in a variety of settings<br>
and ways, and, advantageously, voice portal 10 supports this on a variety of platforms<br>
including, but not limited to, the phone (e.g., voice, WAP and both), the web, and portable<br>
connected computing devices (e.g., Palm® OS device, WinCE® device, RIM pager).<br>
Back end servers 230 include a database service support with a variety of<br>
features, including data collection and fusion. Data collection includes the amassing of<br>
data from Internet sources at regular intervals to be scheduled for particular item types<br>
and/or sites, as described with reference to FIGURES 7 and 8. Voice portal 10 detects<br>
changes to data source sites and notifies the appropriate site rule manager, as described<br>
with reference to FIGURES 9 and 10. Voice portal 10 also supports non-expert definition<br>
of data extraction for data sources, as also described with reference to FIGURES 9 and 10.<br>
In the process of "fusion," voice portal 10 identifies identical items from<br>
different Internet vendors. During the fusion process, voice portal 10 retains meta data<br>
about the source of all information. Meta data includes data about data. For example,<br>
meta data may document data about data elements or attributes, (name, size, data type,<br>
etc.) and data about records or data structures (length, fields, columns, etc.) and data about<br>
data (where it is located, how it is associated, ownership, etc.). Further, voice portal 10<br>
supports interactive clarification of fusion decisions or non-decisions by non-experts in<br>
cases where certainty cannot be determined automatically. Voice portal 10 also supports<br>
additions of new data types and data elements, without code change. Even further, voice<br>
portal 10 supports domain-specific concepts of relatedness that are identified through<br>
market research, trial, and opportunity. For example, in the e-commerce domain of<br>
interest, cheaper, better, often-bought-with, and most-popular are important relatedness<br>
concepts. In the movies domain of interest, related movies and products, and best movies<br>
in a category, most popular, best by reviewer, and cast, are important relatedness concepts.<br>
Voice portal 10 collects and retains related information necessary to provide additional<br>
detail about an item (e.g., product descriptions). The operation and functionalities of<br>
fusion are further described with reference to FIGURES 25-27.<br>
FIGURE 4 illustrates an exemplary data structure model 300 used by<br>
database 170 of voice portal 10 in which "existants" (or things) are given attributes,<br>
associations, and relationships. An "inheritance" relationship between existants is depicted<br>
by a solid line with a triangle head. An "association" relationship between existants is<br>
depicted by a dashed line with an open head arrow. For example of an inheritance<br>
relationship, in the data structure model 300, a block 310 is an "event". An "event" is an<br>
"existant" or thing, illustrated by a triangle headed arrow 315 to a block 320. Similarly, a<br>
"movie showing" (block 330) is an "event" (block 310), illustrated by a triangle headed<br>
arrow 335. For example of an association relationship, events are associated with<br>
"venues", as illustrated by an open headed arrow 345 to a block 340. Similarly, a movie<br>
showing (block 330) is associated with a "movie package" (block 350), as shown by an<br>
open headed arrow 355. Events can also be sporting events, dramas, concerts, comedy<br>
shows, fireworks presentations, dancing performances, or any other activity.<br>
Data structure model 300 includes more existants, associations, and<br>
relationships which are illustrated in FIGURE 4, but not described here. Further, data<br>
structure model 300 may include more existants, associations, and relationships which are<br>
not included in the illustration. FIGURE 4 is for illustration only.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 5, an exemplary data structure model 400 is<br>
illustrated to show the object oriented relationships between a user or customer object and<br>
the different vertical classes. Depictions of inheritance and association relationships are the<br>
same as in the depiction of data structure model 300 described with reference to FIGURE<br>
4. In an exemplary embodiment, user information arranged in data structure model 400 is<br>
contained in database 170. However, in alternative embodiments, such user information<br>
may be contained in a separate customer database.<br>
The customer is an Existant (Customer Existant Block 402) and is a direct<br>
descendent of the top level, or the "Existant" existant, within the hierarchy, and thus<br>
inherits all of its properties and methods. The reason behind this structure is that database<br>
170 and its methods are already created and the structure allows reuse of code.<br>
The customer object contains various pieces of information. The generic<br>
Preferences class contains information on preferences, such as, "Traffic", "Weather", and<br>
"Movies". Each time a customer entered a new and different vertical domain of interest,<br>
an instance of the Preferences object to the vertical domain's name is created with<br>
preference data inserted. If the vertical domain already exists, then the object is modified<br>
with the updated information.<br>
Session class records the information directly about a user's session (session<br>
block 404). The session may be a call, a search through the website, or a call using the<br>
WAP. Data, such as, time of day and duration are general attributes but analysis on<br>
whether the user made a call from a landline or cell phone is specific to phone sessions.<br>
This type of data is useful for determining to whom voice portal 10 directs marketing (for<br>
advertising purposes), and improving both performance and service. As well, a customer<br>
object has a link to each of these session objects to determine what was the last session on<br>
that platform (in case a user terminated the session and would like to reconnect at that<br>
specific time).<br>
A Phone Session block 408 records information relating to a communication<br>
session where a telephone is used to communicate with portal 10. Phone Session block 408<br>
includes information, such as, the current level of interaction, the current domain of<br>
interest, the type of interface platform (e.g., WWW, WAP, ASR), and previous levels<br>
visited. Advantageously, Phone Session block 408 allows the user to rejoin a session<br>
where he or she left off in a previous session or from an interrupted session. Other<br>
existant blocks, such as, credit card info existant, location existant, and preferences existant<br>
contain associated attributes and record information as needed.<br>
The Expertise class (Expertise block 406) serves the purpose of maintaining<br>
different levels of usability (generically, and for different preferences) across different<br>
platforms (i.e. Phone, WAP, WWW). The Customer has links to each of these class<br>
instances. These are not included in the Preferences class since preferences can cross<br>
platforms and user's capabilities cannot.<br>
FIGURE 6 illustrates an exemplary data structure model 450 used by<br>
database 170 of voice portal 110 for information related to advertising. Depictions of<br>
inheritance and association relationships are tne same as in the depiction of data structure<br>
model 300 in FIGURE 4. In an exemplary embodiment, advertising information arranged<br>
in data structure model 450 is contained in database 170. However, in alternative<br>
embodiments, such advertising information may be contained in a separate advertising<br>
database.<br>
Advantageously, data structure models 300, 400 and 450 provide for a<br>
continually expanding arrangement of information on existants, associations, and<br>
relationships. Furthermore, models 300, 400, and 450 allow for the creation of new<br>
vertical domains of interest quickly and without changing previously entered information.<br>
For example, model 300 includes information related to events, such as, movies and<br>
concerts as well as commodities, such as, books, toys, and electronics. Any event, such<br>
as, ballets can easily be added as an existant with an inheritance relationship with "event"<br>
and appropriate association relationships. Similarly, any commodity, such as, a vehicle<br>
can easily be added as an existant with an inheritance relationship to "manufactured item"<br>
and appropriate association relationships. The dynamic nature and expansive capabilities of<br>
data structure models 300, 400, and 450 allow voice portal 10 the advantage of being a<br>
unitary voice portal to a wide range of Internet-based information and services.<br>
FIGURE 7 illustrates a flow diagram 700 of an exemplary creation process<br>
of an existant, such as, existants shown in exemplary data structure model 300 (FIGURE<br>
4), data structure model 400 (FIGURE 5), and data structure model 450 ( FIGURE 6). In<br>
a step 710, a web page on the Internet is found. In an exemplary embodiment, a spider is<br>
used to find particular web pages relating to a pre-determined category of items. A spider<br>
is a conventionally known program that automatically explores the World Wide Web<br>
(WWW) by retrieving a document and recursively retrieving some or all of the documents<br>
that are referenced in it. In contrast, a normal web browser operated by human does not<br>
automatically follow links other than in line images and URL redirection. After step 710 is<br>
performed, a step 720 is performed in which information is identified on the found web<br>
pages by using a chosen form which overlays the page to filter out particular information.<br>
After step 720, a step 730 is performed in which rules are used to identify characteristic<br>
information or attributes from the information retrieved by the form overlay in step 720.<br>
Characteristic information or attributes define what the existant is. Rules define the<br>
organization of existant attributes. For example, a movie existant may include the<br>
attributes of a title, a director, a cast, a release year, and a synopsis.<br>
After step 730 is performed, a step 740 is performed in which attributes are<br>
organized within the existant and the existant is stored in database 170. Preferably, the<br>
organization and arrangement of attributes within the existant are structured by pre-defined<br>
rules.<br>
FIGURE 8 illustrates the exemplary creation process of existants as<br>
described with reference to FIGURE 7. A spider 810 traverses Internet 20 for information<br>
stored on a wide variety of different web pages. Information retrieved by spider 810 is<br>
organized and arranged according to rules 820 in order to place information in a data<br>
structure 830. In an exemplary embodiment, spider 810 retrieves information from<br>
Internet 20 regarding movies. For example, spider 810 may traverse the IMDB web site<br>
and retrieve information regarding the title, director, cast, year of release, and running<br>
time for a particular movie. Once movie information is stored in data structure 830, data<br>
structure 830 is applied to a lexical table 840. Lexical table 840 organizes attributes<br>
contained in data structure 830 and places the information in three columns. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the first column of lexical table 840 includes the original data, the<br>
second column includes the original data in a normalized and tagged format, and the third<br>
column includes the data in a searchable and mashed format. Lexical table 840 and data<br>
structure 830 are contained within memory structures in database 170.<br>
By way of an example, if spider 810 traverses Internet 20 for information<br>
related to the movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark," data retrieved from Internet 20 will be<br>
applied against a rule corresponding to movies and placed in data structure 830. Such a<br>
rule for movies may include title, director, cast, and release year, all of which are<br>
attributes of movies. In this example, the title would be "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the<br>
director would be "Steven Spielberg," the cast would be "Harrison Ford and Karen<br>
Allen," the year would be "1981," and the running time would be "115 minutes." As<br>
such, lexical table 840 would contain the title in its original format: "Raiders of the Lost<br>
Ark," the data in normalized and tagged format: <title> Raiders of the Lost<br>
Ark , and in searchable mashed format: RaidersLostArk, without any spaces or<br>
identifying articles (e.g., the, a, an).<br>
FIGURE 9 illustrates a flow diagram 900 which depicts an exemplary<br>
process of gathering Internet-based information using non-programming means. In a step<br>
910, a search page is found and patterns are used to isolate the area on the page containing<br>
relevant information. After step 910 is performed, a step 920 is performed in which an<br>
appropriate form is found and special routines are invoked to extract actual data and<br>
information. After step 920, a step 930 is performed in which multiple pages with related<br>
information is found given a particular page. Apart from the data specific patterns, there is<br>
an area pattern that defines where data specific patterns operate in the particular page.<br>
After step 930 is performed, a step 940 is performed in which links to more listings of<br>
products or services on the multiple pages are found. In an exemplary embodiment, a<br>
prediction routine is used to compute actual patterns of product listings from code samples.<br>
In general, the prediction routine computes a pattern from a desired output<br>
given by a rule writer. Advantageously, the pattern prediction routine speeds up<br>
production because a rule writer simply has to paste from the HTML code the text<br>
fragments that he or she wants extracted, without having to develop the patterns to make<br>
that happen. The input fields currently used to write the patterns are used to insert this<br>
data.<br>
By way of example, a prediction routine develops a pattern for Author data<br>
for web pages giving data on books by first having the rule writer copy a sample author<br>
name on the web page into the Author field. The algorithm then matches the sample data<br>
to its location on the web page. Characters or tags proximate the matched data are<br>
identified as a "prefix" and "suffix". Prefixes are characters before the matched data and<br>
suffixes are characters after the matched data. The prefix and suffix are used to construct a<br>
pattern.<br>
The constructed pattern is applied to the web page to match against other<br>
data. If the constructed pattern picks up data which is not equal to the desired result, then<br>
the prefix and suffix used to develop the pattern are added to, for a more complete and<br>
accurate pattern. This procedure repeats to improve the pattern.<br>
To further clarify this example, take the following HTML code from a web<br>
page giving product data on books:<br><br> Programming Perl <br>
written by <b>Larry Wall</b><br><br><br>Learning Perl (<b>2nd edition</b>)<br>
written by <b> Randal Schwartz </b><br><br>
The rule writer dumps "Larry Wall" in the Author field to indicate that this<br>
is the data to extract for Author.<br>
The pattern prediction algorithm roughly works as follows:<br>
n= 1;<br>
repeat<br>
$page = ~m / ({.}n) Larry \s+Wall ({.}n) /x;<br>
$prefix = $1;<br>
$suffix = $2;<br>
$page = ~m / $prefix (.*?) $suffix /x;<br>
n = n +1;<br>
until ($1 eq <desired_data>);<br>
Starting with n= 1 on the first page, the algorithm matches " &gt; Larry Wall 
that $prefix gets value " &gt; " and $sufflx gets value " 
algorithm builds the pattern "&gt;(.*?)
step. Matching this pattern against the web page results in " &gt;Programming Perl
which is not equal to the desired result "Larry Wall". Therefore, n is incremented to n=2<br>
and the pattern is refined to include another character in the prefix and suffix. Matching<br>
the web page with "({.}2) Larry \s+ Wall ({.}2)" results in "b&gt; Larry Wall " which<br>
means that $prefix gets value "b &gt;" and $suffix gets value " ". Next, the pattern<br>
prediction algorithm builds the pattern "b &gt; (.*?)" using the values for $1 and $2 it got<br>
from the first step. Matching this pattern against the web page results in "Larry Wall", the<br>
desired output.<br>
Now, as the rule writer steps through web pages to apply the same pattern<br>
on different pages, he or she discovers that the pattern matches: "2nd edition" on the page<br>
about book "Learning Perl". The rule writer then improves the algorithm by giving a<br>
second example of a desired result, (i.e., he or she dumps "Randal Schwartz" into GUI<br>
input field), which triggers the pattern prediction algorithm to further increment n until a<br>
pattern enforcing a "y" before the  is created. The algorithm may perform several<br>
iterations, depending on the complexity of the web data data and the pattern needed.<br>
After step 940 is performed, a step 950 is performed in which a vendor<br>
specific data extraction file is generated. In an exemplary embodiment, a routine is used<br>
that computes relevant URLs from code samples. Alternatively, the routine that computes<br>
URLs can be passed as a form. After step 950 is performed, a step 960 is performed in<br>
which a cache is created. After step 960 is performed, a step 970 is performed in which<br>
patterns for extraction of product data are created. In a preferred embodiment, a<br>
regression test mechanism supports editing the special routines.<br>
FIGURE 10 illustrates an exemplary process of the non-programming<br>
development of rules associated voice portal 10. In the exemplary process, a rule writer<br>
from a set of rule writers 1010 accesses the World Wide Web ("WWW") 1020 in order to<br>
access information from any one of data source 1030, data source 1035, data source 1040,<br>
or any other data source connected to WWW 1020. Data retrieved from a data source is<br>
placed into a data structure utilizing a data organizing tool 1025. Rule writers 1010 use<br>
data organizing tool 1025 to apply one of a multitude of possible forms to "pages" of<br>
information available via WWW 1020. Such forms provide indications for the location of<br>
relevant information on the page and labeled with some distinctive tag. For example, a<br>
page provided on WWW 1020 may include a data input box in the upper left hand corner<br>
of the page. Further, relevant information on a part or service may be located after a<br>
HTML tag, such as, " <title> " for the title of a book.<br>
It should be noted that as used herein the term "page" includes a user interface<br>
screen or similar arrangement which can be viewed by a user of the diagnostic system, such<br>
as screens providing graphical or textual representations of data, messages, reports and so<br>
forth. Moreover, such pages may be defined by a markup language or a programming<br>
language such as Java, perl, java script, or any other suitable language.<br>
Using the form selected by rule writers 1010 from data organizing tool<br>
1025, data from data sources is organized into a data structure 1045, data structure 1050,<br>
data structure 1055, or any similar structure for maintaining information. Data structures<br>
1045, 1050, and 1055 may be compared, fused, or utilized in the formation of a unified<br>
data structure 1060. Unified data structure 1060 is stored in a database 1070.<br>
Advantageously, the exemplary process illustrated in FIGURE 10 allows<br>
non-expert rule writers 1010 to select from a variety of forms provided by data organizing<br>
tool 1025 to use in the retrieval of information from particular web sites available via<br>
WWW 1020. As such, data contained on web pages from data sources 1030, 1035, and<br>
1040 can continually be updated to database 1070 with the form selected by rule writers<br>
1010 using data organizing tool 1025. As information contained in data structures 1045,<br>
1050, and 1055 are compared for accuracy, data organizing tool 1025 detects when web<br>
pages have changed the format or arrangement of data on their corresponding web page.<br>
FIGURES 11-24 illustrate an exemplary process of creating a new rule.<br>
Further, FIGURES 11-24 illustrate possible interactions between a rule writer and data<br>
organizing tool 1025 (FIGURE 10). One exemplary rule is based off an existing rule: the<br>
Amazon.com book products. The steps taken in constructing this rule are similar to the<br>
steps taken in constructing any other rule.<br>
FIGURE 11 illustrates a graphical user interface (GUI) 1110 which is used<br>
to initiate the creation of rules 820 (FIGURE 8). GUI 1110 includes a vendor window<br>
1120, a spider selection window 1130, a query window 1140, a status window 1150, a<br>
search box area 1160, and a code window 1197. Search box area 1160 includes a slider<br>
bar 1170, right set of arrows 1180, left set of arrows 1190, and a search window 1195.<br>
To start a new data source, a rule writer enters the data source (e.g.,<br>
Amazon Book) in a vendor window 1120. The rule writer presses 'Enter' and clicks the<br>
'New' button. After this action is performed, a graphical user interface (GUI) 1200<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 12 is shown. The rule writer clicks on the 'Done' button after<br>
corrfirming that the data source is listed correctly. Next, graphical user interface (GUI)<br>
1300 illustrated in FIGURE 13 is shown. A URL is displayed corresponding to the<br>
selected vendor name. The rule writer is asked to confirm the correct URL. In the<br>
example of Amazon Book, the URL http://www.AmazonBook.com appears in a window of<br>
GUI 1300. However, the URL link should read http://www.Amazon.com. The rule<br>
writer corrects the URL and clicks on the "done" button.<br>
Referring again now to FIGURE 11, the rule writer selects the type of query<br>
that is desired. First, the rule writer selects query window 1140 and chooses from a list of<br>
potential queries. For example, "book package" maybe a possible query for the book<br>
vertical domain of interest. This search is started when the rule writer clicks on the<br>
"SDE" (search data editor) button in query window 1140. The SDE button invokes a<br>
search data editor, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) 1400 illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 14. GUI 1400 shows a list of attributes useable in a search for the particular item<br>
of interest. For example, where books are being searched, attributes such as ISBN or UPC<br>
are shown. Where searches are for other items, attributes are listed which correspond to<br>
that item. A search for "Movie Showings" results with attributes listed, such as, Movie<br>
Package, time, and showing date (see block 330 described with reference to FIGURE 4).<br>
The rule writer types a ISBN number into the corresponding data box and<br>
clicks 'Done'. Buttons 1430 in GUI 1400 advantageously allow the rule writer to save<br>
different search criteria during different searches. Once the search criteria is entered, the<br>
rule writer clicks 'Done' and because no rules have been defined for the particular data<br>
source (i.e., Amazon Book), a graphical user interface (GUI) 1500 illustrated in FIGURE<br>
15 appears. GUI 1500 asks whether the rule writer wants to add a new rule or change the<br>
search data. In this example, the rule writer clicks on the "add" button and GUI 1500<br>
expands to become graphical user interface (GUI) 1600 illustrated in FIGURE 16.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 16, the rule writer confirms that the correct type<br>
of query is highlighted. In this example, ISBN is highlighted and the rule writer clicks on<br>
the "yes" button. A graphical user interface (GUI) 1700 illustrated in FIGURE 17 appears<br>
to instruct the rule writer that the home page of Amazon Book is loaded into the netscape<br>
browser. The rule writer is instructed to browse the web page associated to the ISBN rule.<br>
Once the search page is loaded into the Internet browser, the rule writer clicks the "done"<br>
button.<br>
A graphical user interface (GUI) 1800 illustrated in FIGURE 18 shows a<br>
form option to be selected by the rule writer. If the form is correct, the rule writer clicks<br>
the "done" button. If the form listed does not give the rule writer the choices required, the<br>
rule writer clicks on the "next" button to see other forms on the page. Once a page that<br>
matches is found, a graphical user interface (GUI) 1900 illustrated in FIGURE 19 is<br>
displayed.<br>
Data organizing tool 1025 (FIGURE 10) displays the resulting page in the<br>
Internet browser. If the page is correct, the rule writer clicks on "okay" on GUI 1900. A<br>
graphical user interface (GUI) 2000 illustrated in FIGURE 20 appears and asks how to<br>
detect single items on the page if the search matches on multiple items. GUI 2000 is also<br>
used to indicate where to find the URL to get details about the queried item. If only a<br>
single item was found, the rule writer clicks the "defer" button because not enough<br>
information is present to build the regular expression. If multiple items are found, a<br>
regular expression is entered into a data window 2010. For example, an author search may<br>
return multiple items because a single author may have written several books. In other<br>
cases, even if the query only matches one item, it may be necessary to follow an additional<br>
URL link to get the information.<br>
A graphical user interface (GUI) 2100 illustrated in FIGURE 21 appears<br>
next and is used to detect multiple product pages. If the rule writer goes directly to the<br>
item searched for, there is no need for information to build the regular expression.<br>
Referring again to FIGURE 11, code window 1197 is filled with HTML code from the<br>
retrieved page. At this point, the rule writer is ready to specify attributes. Attributes are<br>
specified by entering a regular expression into the box next to their name. The regular<br>
expression must specify one substring in it (using parenthesis) as a result of the expression.<br>
For example, the regular expression: "this (all) matches" would return "all" as its result<br>
(assuming that the regular expression was able to match). For example, detennining the<br>
pattern used to find the title of a book requires that the rule writer type in the title of the<br>
book into search window 1195. A variety of HTML signals may be used. The "\s*" is<br>
required to indicate possible blank space between words. The first match of the search<br>
string entered in search window 1195 will highlight the first match found in the HTML<br>
code. For example, a title may be found inside a pair of  tags with some extra<br>
information. An exemplary attribute for title of a book may be "  ([^ 
</title> ". Once the attribute is entered, all matches to the attribute are found.<br>
Referring again to FIGURE 14, search data editor 1400 consists of a form<br>
which can be used to assign values to type dependent attributes. The status window<br>
indicates what data organizing tool 1025 is doing. In an exemplary embodiment, the status<br>
states are idle, running the query over the Internet, and using the cache. Query window<br>
1140 allows the rule writer to set the type of query desired for the data source in question<br>
as well as set the search criteria by using the SDE button.<br>
Spider selection window 1130 allows the rule writer to set the spider to be<br>
used if not doing a query search. In an exemplary embodiment, the possible spider types<br>
are full, incremental, special, and reference, A full spider takes all items that match the<br>
chosen type. Incremental spiders are usually used to pick up updates of data from Internet<br>
data sources. Special spiders are usually used to pick up something that the site has that is<br>
special, such as, best sellers for books. Reference spiders are usually used to confirm that<br>
the site is still up and rules are working.<br>
Vendor window 1120 allows the rule writer to set the data source to work<br>
on. Search window 1195 allows the rule writer to keep text to be searched for in the<br>
HTML code. In code window 1197, there is a cursor to indicate position of text entry.<br>
Left set of arrows 1190 includes a first number, which is the starting point of where the<br>
search will run when running from the cache. The second number indicates the total<br>
number of pages in the cache. The set of arrows in this window controls the page to start<br>
from when the rule writer runs from the cache. Right set of arrows 1180 includes arrows<br>
to scroll through pages retrieved.<br>
Spiders are similar to queries but they are called when no other rules are<br>
applicable. Spiders are responsible for gathering information on every object in the web<br>
site that matches the specified type. The spider consists of several nested loops, each<br>
designed to go one level deeper into the hierarchy. Referring now to FIGURE 22, an<br>
exemplary spider hierarchy 2200 is shown for a book spider where a level 2210 is the start<br>
page, a level 2220 represents book category pages, level 2230 represents book sub-<br>
category pages, and a level 2240 represents book pages.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 23, a graphical user interface (GUI) 2300 is used<br>
to retrieve the URL of a page to be associated with a spider rule. A spider depth slide rule<br>
allows the rule writer to tell data organizing tool 1025 how many links down it takes to get<br>
to the actual product page. The upper bound slide rule allows the rule writer to specify a<br>
limit on how many items to spider. Once the URL is selected and a spider depth and an<br>
upper bound is selected, the rule writer clicks on the "done" button. A graphical user<br>
interface (GUI) 2400 illustrated in FIGURE 24 is shown. The rule writer enters search<br>
patterns for the spider to use in a similar fashion to the search patterns entered for a query<br>
described with reference to FIGURE 11. Once the pattern is entered, the rule writer clicks<br>
on the "build" button and the spider will start to run.<br>
Advantageously, the graphical user interfaces shown and described with<br>
reference to FIGURES 11-24 allow non-expert rule writers to perform data searches and<br>
create forms of rules for information retrieval. Once the forms are created, the forms can<br>
be frequently used to gather updated information. Further, forms are helpful to retrieving<br>
large amounts of information available at a vendor's web site using a common form<br>
corresponding to the arrangement and display of information by the vendor on the web site.<br>
Advantageously, forms of rule creation by non-experts provides for lower costs to update<br>
information available at web sites. Further, the forms advantageously automate accurate<br>
retrieval of Internet-based information.<br>
FIGURE 25 illustrates an exemplary process of fusing information in a<br>
database. In exemplary embodiment illustrated by FIGURE 25, a flowchart 2500 depicts a<br>
simplistic fusion process, or "quick fusion", executed by fusion engine 150 (FIGURE 2).<br>
In a step 2510, update engine 160 receives information from network 20 and places the<br>
information in an existant data structure in database 170 via existant subsystem 140.<br>
Fusion engine 150 has access to existants from update engine 160 via existant subsystem<br>
140, which accesses database 170. After step 2510 is performed, a step 2515 is performed<br>
in which fusion engine 150 gathers exact fusion attributes from an attribute definition table<br>
corresponding to the existant retrieved in step 2510. After step 2515 is performed, a step<br>
2512 is performed in which fusion engine 150 executes a "mash" of each fusion attribute<br>
from existence retrieved from database 170 into an easily comparable form. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, a "mash" form removes spaces, prepositions, and other non-<br>
essential words. Advantageously, a "mashed" format provides for quick searching<br>
capabilities.<br>
After step 2520 is performed, a step 2525 is performed in which fusion<br>
engine 150 formulates a database query in which the data source is set to "same" and the<br>
status is set to "canonical". This query is intended to find an already existing canonical<br>
existant from the same data source file which matches the current information. After step<br>
2525 is performed, a step 2530 is performed in which a decision is made whether a match<br>
in database 170 is found. If a match in database 170 is found due to the query of step<br>
2525, a step 2535 is performed in which the existant contained in database 170 is updated.<br>
If no match in database 170 is found from the query of step 2525, a step<br>
2540 is performed in which the query of step 2525 is reformulated and the data source is<br>
set to "same" and the status is set to "non-canonical". This query is intended to find an<br>
already existing existant from the same data source file which matches the current<br>
information. After step 2540, a step 2545 is performed in which a decision is made<br>
whether a match is found in database 170 from the reformulated query of step 2540. If a<br>
match is found, a step 2550 is performed in which the existant is in database 170 is<br>
updated.<br>
If no match is found in database 170, a step 2555 is performed in which the<br>
query is reformulated with the data source being set to "any" and the status is set to<br>
"canonical". This query is intended to find an already existing canonical existant from any<br>
data source which matches the current information. After step 2555, a step 2560 is<br>
performed in which a determination is made whether a match in database 170 is found. If<br>
no match in database 170 is found, a step 2565 is performed in which an existant is added<br>
to database 170.<br>
If a match in database 170 is found or after step 2550 is performed, a step<br>
2570 is performed in which a determination is made whether the match is a system<br>
existant. If the match is a system existant, a step 2575 is performed in which the system<br>
existant is updated. If the match is not a system existant, a step 2580 is performed in<br>
which a canonical system existant is formed. After step 2580 is performed, a step 2585 is<br>
performed in which the existant is added to database 170. After step 2585, a step 2590 is<br>
performed in which the fusion tables are updated.<br>
Advantageously, the exemplary process of fusing information in a database<br>
illustrated by FIGURE 25 provides for the comparison of information on multiple web<br>
sites. As such, a determination can be made if one web site contains the same information<br>
as another web site. Furthermore, information contained in database 170 of voice portal 10<br>
can continually add information, relationships, and associations of information from<br>
Internet-based sources, which provides for greater usability of information retrieved from<br>
data sources.<br>
FIGURE 26 illustrates a flow chart 2600 depicting steps taken in an<br>
exemplary process of fusion. In the exemplary process described with reference to<br>
FIGURE 26, a fusion process is shown which is more comprehensive than the fusion<br>
process depicted in flow chart 2500 described with reference to FIGURE 25. In a step<br>
2610, fusion engine 150 reads an attributes definition table from database 170. After step<br>
2610 is performed, a step 2615 is performed in which fusion engine 150 reads a fusion<br>
control language file for each existant type requiring advanced fusion. After step 2615 is<br>
performed, a step 2620 is performed in which fusion engine 150 compiles fusion files into<br>
an intermediate computer code. After step 2620 is performed, a step 2625 is performed in<br>
which fusion engine 150 holds previously fused existants into memory. After step 2625, a<br>
step 2630 is performed in which fusion engine collects attributes into equivalent sets. After<br>
step 2630, a step 2635 is performed in which a decision is made whether an attribute is<br>
textual. If fusion engine 150 determines that the attribute is not textual, a step 2640 is<br>
performed in which the values are indexed. If fusion engine 150 determines attribute is<br>
textual, a step 2645 is performed in which fusion engine 150 indexes substring occurrences<br>
in the attribute.<br>
After step 2645, a step 2650 is performed in which fusion engine" 150<br>
determines whether the text is structured. If the text is determined to not be structured, a<br>
step 2670 is performed. If the text is determined to be structured, fusion engine 150<br>
identifies location and isolated structural segment of the text in a step 2655. After step<br>
2655, a step 2660 is performed in which fusion engine 150 parses isolated parts and<br>
identifies semantic information. After step 2660, a step 2665 is performed in which fusion<br>
engine 150 indexes semantic information. After step 2665, step 2670 is performed in<br>
which fusion engine 150 executes validity checks to verify the integrity of database 170.<br>
After step 2670, a step 2675 is performed in which fusion engine 150 retrieves the existant<br>
to be fused.<br>
After step 2675, a step 2680 is performed in which fusion engine 150<br>
activates fusion criteria and matching programs for corresponding existant types. Fusion<br>
criteria and matching programs involve the use of existant rules which are established as<br>
described with reference to FIGURE 10. After step 2680, a step 2685 is performed in<br>
which fusion engine 150 executes the first fusion rule from the fusion criteria and matching<br>
programs and returns all matches. After step 2685, a step 2690 is performed in which a<br>
decision is made whether an acceptable match has been found. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, an acceptable match is one in which a predetermined percentage (e.g., 70%)<br>
of attributes are common. In an alternative embodiment, an acceptable match is one in<br>
which all attributes which have values that are the same. If an acceptable match has been<br>
found, a step 2697 is performed in which a fusion engine 150 fuses existants together. If<br>
an acceptable match is not found, a step 2691 is performed in which the next fusion rule is<br>
executed and all matches are returned.<br>
After step 2691, step 2692 is performed in which a determination is made<br>
whether an acceptable match is found. If an acceptable match is found, step 2697 is<br>
performed in which fusion engine 150 fuses existants together. Fusion of existants includes<br>
the creation of a new existant which is associated with the existants to be fused and<br>
contains all information therein. If an acceptable match is not found, a step 2693 is<br>
performed in which a determination is made whether the last rule has been tested. If the<br>
last rule has not been tested, step 2691 is performed again. If the last rule has been tested,<br>
a step 2694 is performed in which fusion engine 150 determines whether there are strong<br>
partial matches. In an exemplary embodiment, a strong partial match is one in which a<br>
match is within a certain percentage, such as, 70%. If strong partial matches exist, a step<br>
2698 is performed in which a deference is made to human examination. If partial matches<br>
are not found, a step 2695 is performed in which fusion engine 150 rejects the fusion<br>
creation, and a step 2699 is performed in which a new existant is created.<br>
Advantageously, the exemplary process of fusing information in a database<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 26 provides for the automatic comparison of information from the<br>
same or different data sources. As such, information contained in database 170 can<br>
continually be updated and given added relatedness to information from other data sources.<br>
Further, fusion allows for the compilation of a more complete and robust unified database<br>
than the millions of databases individually available on the Internet.<br>
FIGURE 27 illustrates an exemplary process of creating a canonical data<br>
structure from two data structures. A data file 2700 is identified by a unique identification<br>
number and contains a first data file 2710, a second data file 2720, and a canonical data file<br>
2730. In an exemplary embodiment, first data file 2710 contains information relating to<br>
particular movie retrieved from the IMDB ("Internet Movie Data Base") website<br>
(http://www.IMDB.com). Second data file 2720 includes movie information for a<br>
particular movie obtained from the Reel.com website. In the example illustrated by<br>
FIGURE 27, data file 2710 includes a title "Boys of Arizona," the director "Wiltz," the<br>
release year "1997," and a synopsis "great movie." Similarly, data file 2720 includes a<br>
title "The Boys of Arizona," the director "Bob Wiltz," the release year "1998," and a<br>
synopsis which is blank.<br>
During the process of creating a canonical data file, a rules file 2740 is<br>
introduced which contains rules for a particular type of information. In the example shown<br>
in FIGURE 27, rules file 2740 contains information relating to the attributes of movies.<br>
By application of rules 2740, a chronicle data file 2730 is created by taking the most<br>
complete title from data file 27 and data file 2720, which is the title from data file 2710:<br>
"The Boys of Arizona." Director information is obtained from data file 2720 because it is<br>
more complete than data file 2710 because it contains the director's first and last name. A<br>
conflict exists as to the release year listed by data file 2710 and that listed by data file<br>
2720. Based on prior information, the conflict is resolved to indicate that data file 2720<br>
has a more correct release year. Chronicle data file 2720 include the synopsis data file<br>
2710 because the synopsis of data file 2720 is blank.<br>
Advantageously, the process of creating chronicle data files described with<br>
reference to FIGURE 27 creates data files with more complete and accurate information.<br>
Furthermore, the process allows comparison of information between multiple websites.<br>
Even further, the process of creation of chronicle data files allows the increase in<br>
relatedness and association relationships among data files.<br>
FIGURE 28 illustrates a functional diagram 2800 of the operations carried<br>
out during isolation of data obtained from the web and transformation of that data for<br>
storage in a database. The exemplary process includes extracting data from network 20<br>
into a data structure 2810 in which data is arranged and organized. For example, data<br>
related to a traffic report may be extracted from the Internet to include information on a<br>
description, a main road, a crossroad, a time, a date, and a severity rating. Data structure<br>
2810 is created and organized by use of rules 2815 which include text patterns and<br>
descriptions which permit the arrangement and organization of data into data structure<br>
2810. Data structure 2810 is stored in a data file on a database. Data in data structure<br>
2810 undergoes a transformation in which a first term substitution form is applied to create<br>
a data structure 2820. Rules 2825 are applied during the term substitution to create data<br>
structure 2820, including lexical entry of the transformation table. In the traffic report<br>
example, "Rd." is transformed to be "road", "I." is transformed to be "interstate", and<br>
"Rt." is transformed to be "route".<br>
Data contained in data structure 2820 is then put in a parsed form in a data<br>
structure 2830 according to rules 2835 which apply attribute phrase grammars for<br>
transferred data. In the traffic report example, a "direction", such as, north, west, south,<br>
and east is identified and a "highway identifier" is determined, such as "interstate" or<br>
"highway". Data in data structure 2830 is then placed in a re-arranged form in data<br>
structure 2840 by applying term arrangement rules 2845. Data in data structure 2840 is<br>
manipulated by a second term substitution form and placed in data structure 2850 by<br>
applying rules 2855 from the lexical transformation table. For example, the term "St." is<br>
determined to be either "street" or "saint" based on its locational identifier <br>
or  in the lexical transformation table.<br>
After the lexical transformations are performed, data is placed in data<br>
structure 2860, an unfused, normalized, and tagged format. Data structure 2860 preferably<br>
resides in database 2850. Normalized and tagged format refers to a format including a<br>
uniform organization such that data can be easily searched and compared and HTML tags.<br>
Often, HTML tags provide information on the type of data, its location, and its length.<br>
Unfused means that the data has not gone through the fusion process described with<br>
reference to FIGURES 25 and 26.<br>
Advantageously, the data isolation process described with reference to<br>
FIGURE 28 takes data from the Web and transforms it into a normalized and tagged format<br>
in a database. Normalized and tagged data is prepared for organization, manipulation, and<br>
fusion. Advantageously, the data isolation process is uniform and works for data from a<br>
wide range of data sources. Thus, generally the process includes obtaining data from<br>
Internet sources, creating a first data file with the obtained data in a first format, and<br>
generating phrases from the obtained data where the phrases are in a second format<br>
associated with a specific interface. A wide range of applications may be used to convert<br>
the obtained data into the first and second formats. For example, text patterns, lexical<br>
transform tables, attribute phrase grammars, and term arrangement rules may be used to<br>
convert obtained data into a uniform and searchable format, which is saved in a data file in<br>
a database, and then convert the saved data to an interface specific format. In alternative<br>
embodiments, other patterns, tables, rules, and data manipulation applications may be used.<br>
FIGURE 29 is a functional diagram 2900 illustrating the transformation of<br>
data from database 170 to a user of voice portal 10 via some user interface platform (e.g.,<br>
WAP, Web, phone, ASR, TTF). Data contained in data structure 2860 (shown also in<br>
FIGURE 29) is put in a parsed form in a data structure 2910 by applying rules 2915 with<br>
attribute phrase grammars for normalized and tagged data. Attribute phase grammars take<br>
normalized and tagged data to create sensible phrases which include the attributes<br>
identified. Data from data structure 2910 is then placed in data structure 2920 by applying<br>
a term substituted form using rules 2920 containing lexical entry transformation tables. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, the lexical entry transformation tables of rules 2920 list the<br>
data output structure corresponding to a particular interface For example, the term<br>
"route" is transformed into "Rt." for WAP applications and transformed into "Route" for<br>
telephone applications using speech. Similarly, the term "U.S." is transformed into<br>
"U.S." for WAP applications and to "you ess" for phone applications using speech.<br>
Data from data structure 2920 is placed in a re-arranged form in a data<br>
structure 2930 by applying rules 2935 in which term replacement rules are applied,<br>
depending on the output device used. Term rearrangement rules move terms around to the<br>
arrangement which best suits different user interfaces. Data in data structure 2930 is then<br>
placed in a data structure 2940 in which sentences are generated by applying rules 2945<br>
which include phase generation grammars. For example, a sentence may be generated<br>
which says "we have a  traffic incident between  and<br> on <main road>." Once data is in the format of data structure 2940,<br>
it is prepared for a variety of output interfaces, such as, WAP, Web, phone, and ASR.<br>
Advantageously, the data transformation process described with reference to<br>
FIGURE 29 is a uniform process which takes data and prepares it for a wide range of user<br>
interfaces. For example, the process allows for data to be extracted from web sources and<br>
be semantically identified and prepared for speech transmission via a speech interface. At<br>
the same time, the process allows for the same data to be prepared for transmission to<br>
WAP devices or web applications.<br>
FIGURES 30-33 Illustrate several operational paths that demonstrate<br>
exemplary interactions between the user and voice portal 10. User interface 110 preferably<br>
makes use of explicit prompting to guide the user into making appropriate utterances as<br>
described with reference to FIGURES 32-33.<br>
FIGURE 30 is a flow diagram 3000 depicting an exemplary system<br>
overview, including process blocks representing various functionalities of voice portal 10.<br>
In an exemplary execution path, at a block 3010, voice portal 10 greets the user by saying,<br>
"Welcome to Quack, brought to you by American Express." Preferably, voice portal 10<br>
uses caller-ID as means of identifying the user. In a preferred embodiment, phone<br>
numbers are stored as a customer attribute in database 170. Alternatively, phone numbers<br>
are stored in a customer database. Voice portal 10 continues by stating, "Hello, Steve<br>
Woods. Please say your PIN or enter it on the numeric keypad. If this is not Steve, please<br>
say or enter your phone number." The user then responds verbally "5082" to give his or<br>
her PIN. Once authentication is made, voice portal 10 goes to a block 3020. At block<br>
3020, voice portal 10 indicates "You are at the Quack runway. Please say the name of the<br>
category you are interested in from the following list: movies, weather, traffic, stocks, and<br>
sports." The user responds with a category name or a goodbye. If a category name is<br>
provided, voice portal 10 goes to a block 3030. If a goodbye is given, voice portal 10<br>
provides a graceful exit to voice portal 10. In an exemplary response, the user says<br>
"Weather" and voice portal 10 goes to block 3030. At block 3030, voice portal 10 says,<br>
"Welcome to Weather, brought to you by The Weather Channel," and goes to a block<br>
3040. At block 3040, the identity unique existant subsystem is performed.<br>
After block 3040, a block 3050 is performed in which a determination is<br>
made as to whether the existant was found in the identify unique existant subsystem of<br>
block 3040. If the existant was not found, control returns to block 3030. If the existant<br>
was found, a block 3060 is performed in which the found existant subsystem (described<br>
with reference to FIGURE 33) is performed.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 31, the identify unique existant subsystem<br>
executed at block 3040 (FIGURE 30) includes a block 3110 in which database 170<br>
provides an attribute from an attribute dependency graph for the current vertical domain<br>
(e.g., weather, traffic, movies). If there are not more attributes in the attribute dependancy<br>
graph, control passes to a block 3115 where an existant search fail is noted. After block<br>
3115, control passes to block 3030 (FIGURE 30). After block 3110 (FIGURE 31), a block<br>
3120 is executed in which an attribute vocabulary is built from an attribute value set<br>
provided by database 170. After block 3120 is performed, a block 3130 is performed hi<br>
which voice portal 10 uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques following a<br>
method N to acquire the user's response to an attribute value prompt. For example, voice<br>
portal 10 may request the user's location by ZIP code, one exemplary method N. The user<br>
may respond by giving his or her ZIP code, such as, "53045".<br>
At a block 3140, a decision is made as to whether the voice recognition was<br>
successful. If not successful, block 3130 is performed with ASR techniques following a<br>
fallback method N+1. For example, in the weather vertical domain, a fallback method<br>
N+1 may be to ask for the state and city of the user's location. In preferred embodiments,<br>
fallback methods include choosing an attribute from a list, constraining the attribute value<br>
set by partitioning space (e.g., get state, then city name), and spelling the attribute value.<br>
If voice recognition is successful, a block 3150 is performed in which voice portal 10<br>
searches database 170 with the acquired attribute. After block 3150 is performed, a flow<br>
chart 3200 (FIGURE 32) is performed.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 32, flow chart 3200 is shown illustrating a<br>
portion of the identify unique existant subsystem. After block 3150 is performed (FIGURE<br>
31), a block 3210 is performed to determine the number of matching existants from the<br>
search of database 170. Different actions are taken depending on the number of matches<br>
found in the search of the product database. If no matches are found, a block 3220 is<br>
performed in which a determination is made as to whether to seek a Compound Unique<br>
Key. A Compound Unique Key may exist if there are one or more unique keys or<br>
identifiers which are not contained within database 170, but may be used to find the desired<br>
item on the Internet.<br>
If one match is found, a block 3230 is performed in which voice portal 10<br>
verifies if the match is the correct existant. If the number of matches is greater than one<br>
but less than the maximum number for a list, a block 3240 is performed in which the user<br>
is requested to identify the existant from the list of matches. If more matches are found<br>
than the maximum number of possible entries in a list, a block 3250 is performed in which<br>
it is determined whether the attribute is "extensible." In other words, a determination is<br>
made as to whether more information can be provided about the attribute. If more<br>
information cannot be provided, control returns to block 3110 (FIGURE 31) in which<br>
another attribute from the attribute dependency graph is obtained. If the attribute is<br>
extensible, a block 3260 is performed in which the attribute is attempted to be extended. If<br>
the attribute can be extended, control passes to block 3120 (FIGURE 31) in which a<br>
vocabulary set is built and ASR techniques and methods are used to obtain an attribute<br>
value. If the attribute cannot be extended, control passes to block 3110 (FIGURE 31) in<br>
which another attribute from the attribute dependency graph is obtained. If the extension<br>
of the attribute results in a list of items, control passes to block 3240.<br>
Referring now to the query performed at block 3220, if a determination is<br>
made that there is not a Compound Unique Key to use for a WWW search, control passes<br>
to passes to block 3110 (FIGURE 31). If the determination is made that a Compound<br>
Unique Key may exist, control passes to a block 3270 in which a determination is made as<br>
to whether the WWW is searched. If the WWW is not to be searched, control passes to<br>
block 3030 (FIGURE 30) which is the top level of the current vertical domain. If the<br>
WWW is to be searched, control passes to a block 3280. Referring now to block 3230 and<br>
block 3240, if the correct existant is found or the correct existant is found from the list,<br>
control passes to block 3280. If the correct extistant is not found in block 3230 or block<br>
3240, control passes to block 3220 for a determination of whether there is a Compound<br>
Unique Key which can be searched on to find an item. At block 3280, a web lookup is<br>
performed. At this point, the customer may be presented targeted advertisement of a<br>
variety of lengths. Advertising is described in further detail with reference to FIGURE 36.<br>
During block 3280, block 3060 is performed in which a found existant subsystem is<br>
executed.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 33, the found existant subsystem includes a block<br>
3310 in which a log is made into the customer database of the found item. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, customer database is included in database 170. After block 3310, a block<br>
3320 is performed in which information is prepared for presentation as appropriate to the<br>
vertical domain from information in database 170. After block 3320, a block 3330 is<br>
performed in which related information and command grammar is built. For example, in<br>
the movie vertical domain, if a list of movies showing at a specific theater is played,<br>
grammar would include the movie titles to allow the user to ask for more information about<br>
a particular movie.<br>
At a block 3340, information is returned from the user. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, possible acceptable commands include commands to hear more detailed<br>
information, to hear information from a specific source, to hear related information (e.g.,<br>
cheaper, better), and to take action appropriate to the vertical domain (e.g., increase the<br>
bid, change location). After block 3340, a block 3350 is performed in which the next<br>
activity is obtained. If a new vertical domain is desired, control passes to block 3020<br>
(FIGURE 30). If a new selection from the top of the current vertical domain is desired,<br>
control passes to block 3030 (FIGURE 30). If a new existant is desired, control passes to<br>
block 3040 (FIGURE 30).<br>
Referring again to FIGURE 32, after block 3280 is performed, a block 3290<br>
is performed in which web lookup results are coordinated by updating database 170.<br>
During coordination of the web results at block 3290, a smart delay handle may be<br>
performed at a block 3295 in which advertisements or other forms of handling a delay are<br>
performed. Smart delay handle at block 3295 uses information from the customer database<br>
and the advertising database. In a preferred embodiment, the customer database and the<br>
advertising database are subsets of database 170. In alternative embodiments, the customer<br>
database and the advertising database are physically separate databases.<br>
In operation, the system and method for voice access to Internet-based<br>
information described herein advantageously can identify a vertical domain of interest to<br>
the consumer (e.g., movies, shopping), and then "funnel" user responses from the range of<br>
all possible things in a vertical domain to the one or set of things that the consumer wants.<br>
This funneling within a vertical domain involves system-directed questioning the user about<br>
attributes of products or services, according to a set of pre-defined "paths" to funnel to a<br>
particular item. Paths are defined in terms of orderings of constraints about products to be<br>
ascertained and instantiated.<br>
FIGURE 34 illustrates a flow diagram 3400 of the funneling process which<br>
allows voice portal 10 to funnel user responses and achieve highly accurate rates of voice<br>
recognition for user responses. At step 3410, a user calls voice portal 10. After step<br>
3410, a step 3415 is performed in which the caller is identified, using the different possible<br>
methods described above. After step 3415, a step 3420 is performed in which the user<br>
selects a vertical domain of interest. A step 3425 is then performed in which the attribute<br>
funnel characteristic to the chosen vertical domain of interest is started. After step 3425, a<br>
step 3430 is performed in which voice portal 10 determines whether the user has<br>
preferences in this vertical domain of interest. If there are preferences and the user does<br>
not want to over-ride them, control passes to a step 3460 in which the item or service is<br>
indicated as found based on user preferences.<br>
If no preferences are available or the user over-rides his or her preferences,<br>
a step 3435 is performed in which an attribute vocabulary set is built. Vocabulary sets<br>
advantageously allow voice portal 10 to have a limited number of possible responses from<br>
which to use in speech recognition of user response at this point in the vertical domain of<br>
interest. With a defined vocabulary set, voice portal 10 advantageously achieves with high<br>
rates of recognition conventional speech recognition techniques. For example, it would be<br>
easier to recognize the term "Brewers" after the user has selected Major League Baseball<br>
(MLB) teams and a vocabulary set of possible requests for MLB teams has been built.<br>
Such a vocabulary set may include a variety of different types of user inputs for the same<br>
information. For example, in the MLB team example, a vocabulary set may include all the<br>
city or state names associated with MLB teams as well as the MLB team mascot. Thus,<br>
"Milwaukee" and "Brewers" would both be part of the vocabulary set of MLB teams.<br>
After an appropriate vocabulary set has been built, a step 3440 is performed<br>
in which voice portal 10 queries on the attribute. For example, "What Major League<br>
Baseball team would you like to hear about?" After step 3440, a step 3445 is performed in<br>
which the attribute is identified. If an attribute is not identified, a step 3447 may be<br>
performed to carry out fallback procedures for the identification of the attribute. At a step<br>
3450, voice portal 10 determines whether it has reached an "end state," or a point at which<br>
the item or service has been found. If an "end state" has not been reached, a step 3455 is<br>
performed in which the next attribute is accessed and control returns to step 3430. In the<br>
baseball example given, an end state has not been reached with only the team name. Other<br>
"narrower" attributes, such as, recent game results, player statistics, team standings, or<br>
other related information must be requested. Once step 3460 is performed, a step 3465 is<br>
performed in which the found item or service is reported to the user.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the user selects item in the following manner.<br>
The user first specifies the domain of interest (e.g. e-commerce, traffic information,<br>
weather information, movies, etc.). The user then chooses an item (e.g., a book, a toy, a<br>
route of interest for traffic information, a city of interest for weather information, etc.) by<br>
specifying attributes of the item. The user is then provided with detailed information for<br>
an identified item, appropriate to the domain of the item (e.g. products, traffic, weather,<br>
movies, etc.). For example, in the E-commerce domain of interest reviews, vendor<br>
information including pricing, shipping costs and availability are available. In the movies<br>
domain of interest, directory, producer, and cast are provided. In the auctions domain of<br>
interest, outstanding bids are made available.<br>
Advantageously, the user may request information by locale (e.g., the<br>
nearest vendor for an identified product, the nearest theater for a movie) with multiple<br>
ways to identify a locale (e.g., zip, town name, city area "Boston North, West etc.). In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, a strategy for location-identification around ZIP codes is used<br>
which involves asking for suburb name, falling back to city or even state and then zooming<br>
in again. In an exemplary embodiment, the user is provided upon request with the date and<br>
time on which information was last updated. Preferably, all data presented to the user is of<br>
currency appropriate to the domain. The user is informed of the source of the information<br>
("provided by XXXXX") for "pure" source information, or information from only one<br>
source. In a preferred embodiment, a "help" or "instructions" option is available at every<br>
selection point.<br>
The user may request item comparisons based on item attributes, as<br>
appropriate to the domain. The user may request identification of "better", "cheaper" and<br>
"related" items, as appropriate to the domain. Advantageously, the user may explicitly<br>
record items in a number of user-defined lists, as appropriate to the domain of interest.<br>
The user may review items from their lists. The user may request phone or email<br>
notification of information changes (appropriate to the domain) for items on their lists.<br>
FIGURE 35 illustrates a flow diagram 3500 of an exemplary process of<br>
carrying out a transaction using voice portal 10. At step 3510, a user accesses (telephones<br>
or calls) voice portal 10. After step 3510, a step 3515 is performed in which a funneling<br>
process is performed to identify an item or service desired by the user. Such funneling<br>
process performs the operations illustrated in flow diagram 3400 and described with<br>
reference to FIGURE 34.<br>
After step 3515, a step 3520 is performed in which voice portal 10 asks the<br>
user to specify a transaction desired and relating to the item or service identified. After<br>
step 3520 is performed, a step 3525 is executed in which voice portal 10 identifies the<br>
appropriate voice portal rule to execute the specified transaction. After step 3525, a step<br>
3530 is performed in which the rule is executed to carry out the specified transaction.<br>
Transactions can include purchasing an item or service, making a bid on an auction, or any<br>
other type of transaction possible over the Internet. After step 3530, a step 3535 is<br>
performed in which voice portal 10 records the result of the transaction. Preferably, the<br>
result is recorded in database 170. After step 3535, a step 3540 is performed in which the<br>
transaction is reported to the user.<br>
Different transactions (e.g., bid, watch, buy, track) are appropriate to<br>
different domains. For example, in the e-commerce domain of interest, the user may order<br>
an identified product from a chosen vendor. Further, the user may add an item to a<br>
shopping cart for purchase at a later time. The user may specify, when ordering, a billing<br>
credit card and shipping address (from user profile or manually). The user may also<br>
request status information for previously ordered products. As another example, in the<br>
auction vertical domain of interest, the user may increase existing bids or the user may<br>
place bids on new auctions.<br>
Advantageously, the process of carrying out a transaction using voice portal<br>
10 does not require a user to make any manual actions on a computer. The user can buy<br>
items, make bids, or do any other Internet transaction without clicking a mouse, pressing a<br>
key on a computer keyboard, or any other computer-interface manual action (e.g., mouse<br>
click, keyboard entry). Thus, the process described with reference to FIGURE 35 can be a<br>
"No Click" Internet transaction process. User can utilize the touch pad of a phone and still<br>
perform a "No Click" Internet transaction.<br>
FIGURE 36A illustrates a flow diagram 3600A of an exemplary process of<br>
advertising using voice portal 10. Advantageously, advertising subsystem 120 includes a<br>
method for determining what advertisements to play to a specific user. Generally, this<br>
method includes setting selection constraints based on a context, such as, user<br>
demographics, location demographics, and a current vertical domain of interest. After<br>
selection constraints are set, the method queries an advertisement database based on the<br>
constraints and retrieves a list of possible advertisements. The list of possible<br>
advertisements is re-ordered based on a sales criteria for each advertisement. An<br>
advertisement is selected from the re-ordered list and presented to the user.<br>
Referring to flow diagram 3600A, in a step 3610A, advertising subsystem<br>
120 in voice portal 10 sets selection constraints for advertisements to be presented to a<br>
user. In one embodiment, the selection constraints are based on user-centric information,<br>
such as, user demographics, location demographics, and the current selected vertical<br>
domain of interest (if any) as well as advertising-centered information, such as, advertising<br>
sales criteria, lack of repetition, and other advertising effectiveness factors. Such<br>
constraints or criteria are used in selecting from a variety of different types of<br>
advertisements, such as, an introductory sponsorship advertisement, a vertical sponsorship<br>
advertisement, and a commercial advertisement. After step 3610A, a step 3615A is<br>
performed in which database 170 is queried for a list of possible advertisements based on<br>
the constraints selected in step 3610A.<br>
After step 3615A, a step 3620A is performed in which the list of possible<br>
advertisements is re-ordered based on sales criteria factors. In one embodiment, sales<br>
criteria are used to determine the following: (1) Is the advertisement delivery rate being<br>
achieved for this advertisement? (2) Has the target delivery minimum been achieved for<br>
this advertisement? Advantageously, the sales criteria are used to make sure that each<br>
Advertisement customer will have their requirements for delivery satisfied. In one<br>
embodiment, a ratio is calculated to prioritize the advertisements on which should be<br>
delivered first.<br>
The following provides an example of using a ratio as the determining factor<br>
of how advertisements are ordered. Advertisement X needs 100,000 deliveries in its<br>
contract. Voice portal 10 has already delivered 7,000 instances of Advertisement X. The<br>
start date of the contract is May 10 and end date is June 7th. The current date is assumed to<br>
be May 15th. So, an exemplary ratio is determined as follows:<br>
• Number of days since start of contract = 5.<br>
• Length of contract = 27 days.<br>
• Number of days that the Advertisement needs to be played = 22.<br>
• Percent of ads played = 7,000 / 100,000 ~ = 7%<br>
• Percent of days already played = 5/27 ~ = 18.5%<br>
As such, an exemplary final ratio is:<br>
(% of days already played - % of ads played) / Number of days remaining in contract<br>
Advantageously, this ratio accounts for advertisements that should be played soon (lower<br>
denominator -&gt; higher ratio), and the discrepancies of advertisements that have already<br>
been played get pushed back with a lower ratio.<br>
After step 3620A in which the list of possible advertisements are re-ordered,<br>
a step 3625A is performed in which an advertisement is chosen. In one embodiment, the<br>
advertisement is chosen based on the highest ratio available in the list of possible<br>
advertisements. After step 3625A, different actions are taken depending on the type of<br>
advertisement to be preseuted. In a step 3630A, if there is no advertisement available and<br>
if the advertisement type is an introductory sponsorship advertisement, an exception is<br>
raised in a step 3635A. Otherwise, a step 3640A is performed in which a decision is made<br>
as to whether an advertisement is available. If there is an advertisement available, a step<br>
3645A is performed in which the advertisement is played. If no advertisement is available,<br>
a step 3640A is performed in which the selection constraints are reset and control returns<br>
to step 3620A.<br>
As such, there are differences in the process steps for each type of<br>
Advertisement, of which there are three: introductory sponsorship Advertisements,<br>
vertical sponsorship Advertisements, and commercial Advertisements. The following is an<br>
exemplary process for selecting an introductory sponsorship Advertisement:<br>
1. Set selection constraints based on location for the introductory sponsorship<br>
Advertisement type (vertical is not used because, no vertical is applied).<br>
2. Query the database based on constraints with result transformed into a list of<br>
possible Advertisements to play.<br>
3. Reorder the list based on the sales criteria.<br>
4. Choose the Advertisements from the list with the highest ratio. There must be an<br>
Advertisement in the database and raise an exception otherwise.<br>
The following is an exemplary process for selecting an vertical sponsorship Ad:<br>
1. Set constraints based on user demographics, location demographics, and vertical<br>
type for the vertical sponsorship Advertisement type.<br>
2. Query the database based on constraints with result transformed into a list of<br>
possible Advertisements to play.<br>
3. Reorder the list based on the sales criteria.<br>
4. Choose the Advertisement from the list with the highest ratio if one is available and<br>
return to the user interface.<br>
5. If none are available, reset selection constraints based only on vertical type and set<br>
the type of vertical sponsorship to be only for Quack promotions.<br>
6. Reorder the list based on the sales criteria.<br>
7. Choose the Ad from the list with the highest ratio if one is available and return to<br>
the user interface.<br>
8. If the user heard all of the Advertisements from the list, then return the<br>
Advertisement that was last played to the user. If for some reason the list is empty<br>
and no Advertisements are available, raise an exception.<br>
The following is an exemplary process for selecting a commercial advertisement:<br>
1. Set selection constraints based on location demographics, customer demographics<br>
and vertical type for the commercial Advertisement type.<br>
2. Query the database based on those constraints with the result transformed into a list<br>
of possible Advertisements to play.<br>
3. Reorder the list based on the sales criteria.<br>
4. Choose the Ad from the list with the highest ratio if one is available and return to<br>
the user interface.<br>
5. If none are available, reset selection constraints based only on vertical type and set<br>
the type of commercial to be either for Quack (i.e., voice portal system)<br>
commercials or paid commercials (regardless of type entered).<br>
6. Reorder the list based on the sales criteria.<br>
7. Choose the Advertisement from the list with the highest ratio if one is available and<br>
return to the user interface.<br>
8. If the user heard all of the Advertisements from the list, then return the<br>
Advertisement that was last. If for some reason the list is empty and no<br>
Advertisements are available, then raise an exception.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 36B, a flow chart 3600B illustrates a second<br>
exemplary process of advertising using voice portal 10. In a step 3610B, a user accesses<br>
(telephone or calls) voice portal 10. After step 3610B, a step 3615B is performed in which<br>
a user lookup is performed to identify the user. Caller identification may be done in a<br>
variety of methods, some of which are described with reference to FIGURES 2 and 30.<br>
After step 3615B, in a step 3620B, a determination is made as to whether the user is known<br>
by voice portal 10. If the user is not known, a step 3625B is performed in which a default<br>
profile is used for the user. In an exemplary embodiment, the default profile does not<br>
include user constraints or limitations for certain advertisements. The default profile can<br>
be geared for certain parameters known about the call, such as for example, the area code<br>
of the user, time of day of the call, day of the week, etc. If the user is known or after step<br>
3625B is performed, a step 3630B is performed in which advertising subsystem 120<br>
generates a set "S" of advertisements based on the type c.f interface (e.g., speech, WAP,<br>
WWW) including user constraints particular to the current user.<br>
Given the current operating context (e.g., particular user, vertical domain of<br>
interest), in a step 3635B, advertising subsystem 120 generates weights for advertisement<br>
set S based on the advertising context. After step 3635B, a step 3640B is performed to<br>
determine whether the context is enough to accurately know what the user most wants. If<br>
the context is not enough, a step 3645B is performed in which an advertisement is picked<br>
based on the partial context obtained. If the context is sufficient, a step 3650B is<br>
performed in which the best fit advertisement is played.<br>
Advantageously, advertising subsystem 120 provides an initial general<br>
advertisement or sponsorship message to all callers. Advertising subsystem 120 also<br>
provides targeted audio advertisements to users, chosen based on a utility function<br>
appropriate to the domain. In an exemplary embodiment, the utility function is related to<br>
the availability of the product or service to be advertised, the relatedness of the current<br>
item (e.g., DVD is related to television), the relevance to the user (e.g., by demographic),<br>
the desirability of the user to the advertiser, and the value to the service provider (e.g.,<br>
based on cost/return). Advantageously, advertising subsystem 120 is capable of delivering<br>
a certain number of advertisements to users within a certain time frame. Moreover,<br>
advertising subsystem 120 is capable of delivering advertisements across different<br>
platforms, such as wireless application protocol (WAP), WWW, and speech interfaces.<br>
Taking for example, the speech interface platform, within the first minute,<br>
one sponsorship advertisement and one targeted advertisement are delivered to the user.<br>
Within each additional 40 seconds, a second targeted advertisement is delivered. In one<br>
embodiment, a sponsorship message will process in 3-5 seconds, and then a targeted<br>
advertisement takes 10-20 seconds.<br>
The implementation of this structure is based on the fact that the<br>
introductory sponsorship advertisement is presented upon entering the system. Each time<br>
the user enters a vertical, the user is prompted with a "vertical sponsorship". Once the<br>
user is about to receive the data requested, a full commercial would be presented to the<br>
user. Advantageously, this model approximates the schedule listed in previously as the<br>
user is estimated to be searching for their piece of information for 40 seconds before<br>
receiving it.<br>
In the advertising context, "Speak-throughs" are requests to deliver more<br>
detailed information upon presentation of an advertisement. Advantageously, speak-<br>
throughs apply not only to speech interface, but also to both the WAP and WWW. For the<br>
WAP, speech and text can be considered for a speak-through while clicking on a banner to<br>
find out more on an ad would be a speak-through on the WWW. One embodiment of a<br>
speak-through on a voice interaction is to point the customer to a website address or a<br>
phone number. In alternative embodiments, speak-throughs collect an email address or a<br>
custom phone number to provide to the advertiser to send more relevant information to the<br>
customer. With a WWW interface, speak throughs may include using an outside source to<br>
manage and audit customer information. Advertising subsystem 120 may also provide<br>
targeted "banner" advertisements to users, chosen based on a utility function appropriate to<br>
the domain (e.g., WWW interface).<br>
The management of the advertising delivery of advertising subsystem 120 is<br>
based on a combination of several factors. In an exemplary embodiment, an advertisement<br>
is delivered in one of three places. First, an advertisement may be delivered when the user<br>
is preparing to enter the system to begin a new session. This sponsorship message will be<br>
in the voice of user interface 110, or "the system voice", and should rotate among several<br>
alternative advertising sponsors. For example, a sponsor message may say, "Quack is<br>
brought to you by Visa, the currency of the web" or "Quack is brought to you by<br>
SprintPCS; the clear future of cellular services."<br>
Second, another sponsorship advertisement (a "vertical sponsorship"<br>
advertisement) may be delivered just before a user has accessed a certain vertical of the<br>
system, such as movies, traffic, or weather. For example, such an advertisement may say,<br>
"Brought to you by IMDB, the world's authorities on movie information" and "LCE Sony<br>
Metreon: Boston's ONLY choice for great movie selections."<br>
Third, an advertisement may be delivered just before the user receives the<br>
refined request. This type of advertisement is defined as a "commercial". Such<br>
advertisements are timely (i.e., delivered at chosen points) but only on a so-often basis,<br>
such as every 2 minutes. Advantageously, the system voice can point out a value-added<br>
situation for the user that may be helpful. For example, a nearby restaurant may be<br>
suggested when a user is selecting a movie at a particular theater. Speak-through<br>
advertisements are preferably used here, although non-speak through advertisements are<br>
possible. The advertising content itself is preferably about 7 seconds in length. The speak-<br>
through ads are preferably of maximum possible quality (i.e., professionally produced),<br>
and of length of about preferably 15 to 20 seconds. For example, if the user selects<br>
American Beauty as a movie at LCE Sony Metreon, the system voice says, "I'm looking<br>
up the listing at Sony Metreon ... if you would like to hear about 'Tony's Matriciana':<br>
Boston's best Italian food only 5 minutes from Sony Metreon,- say 'Tony's!', or hold on for<br>
your listing." The user may then automatically set up a reservation. Other relatedness<br>
attributes may also be used for targeted advertising. Advantageously, the advertisement is<br>
delivered in these different spots due to the current assumptions that making a vertical-<br>
specified request will take the amount of time to deliver the advertisements.<br>
Along with these issues, decisions are made on which advertisements users<br>
are to have delivered to them. Factors incorporated into this decision include the length of<br>
the call, what type of vertical content is requested, combination of content and user profile<br>
(and/or location) (i.e. restaurant ads should be local to the customer), revenue potential,<br>
callers requesting specific information, and if the user has heard the advertisement already.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, advertisements are rotated based on the following factors:<br>
When was the last time that the ad was played? When was the last time the user heard the<br>
ad before this call? Did the user hear the ad already this call? Is the ad delivery rate being<br>
achieved for this ad? Has the target delivery minimum been achieved for this ad?<br>
Advantageously, advertisements are delivered in a manner such that the<br>
presentation is appropriate to particular customers and are tracked accordingly to billing<br>
rates. Thus, certain basic data is gathered to manage each ad, such as, how many times<br>
has the ad been played and how many times has an individual user heard the ad?<br>
As well, given this basic data, the following more complex queries are<br>
available. For example, queries may include the ability to create a report of all users who<br>
have heard an ad among various defined groupings as follows: name, demographic<br>
information, location, and relatedness information (what else have these users requested).<br>
Queries may also include the ability to create a report of all users who have requested<br>
speak-through information.<br>
The capability of barging-in (i.e., stopping the advertisement from being<br>
played), which is possible during other modes of operation for voice portal 10 can be<br>
removed while presenting an ad. The capability to prevent barge-ins is important in that<br>
advertisers must be assured of the data that has been acquired with respect to the<br>
advertising that was given through voice portal 10. In one embodiment, the gathering of<br>
this advertising data is done by a third party auditor.<br>
Advertising subsystem 120 keeps a record of all advertisements served to<br>
users, including successful (i.e., complete) and unsuccessful (i.e., incomplete) deliveries.<br>
Preferably, this record is stored in database 170.. Advantageously, advertisements may be<br>
targeted by vertical domain of interest, or caller location or user, or user preferences, or<br>
user past interests, or by some other combination of advertiser interests and user collected<br>
information.<br>
Advantageously, the use of context sensitive information can be used to<br>
narrowly target advertisement to a user. Context-sensitive Advertisement targeting in voice<br>
portal 10 relates an Advertisement commercial to nearly exactly what information the user<br>
receives. To make this function correctly, an appropriate pointer is passed into the<br>
selection algorithm just before the Advertisement is to be played. In the one embodiment,<br>
the vertical type is the context pointer.<br>
In other embodiments, an existant is the context pointer that allows more<br>
specific targeting. This context pointer matches its attributes' criteria with market research<br>
criteria to determine weights in certain categories. These category weights combined with<br>
the sales criteria of the Advertisements in the initial list define an ordering of context<br>
weights from which to best select Advertisements. This initial list, created from<br>
demographics and vertical type, form the basis for the context weighting. Mathematical<br>
notation is introduced to generalize this problem into an algorithm, and an example follows<br>
to illustrate it.<br>
First, variables are defined with respect to the parameters involved. Let the<br>
list of attributes of the existant passed into the algorithm be defined by the set {e1, e2, ...,<br>
em}, where m is the number of attributes in the existant. For example, for a movie<br>
existant, sample attributes are genre, location and show time. The list of categories<br>
available to associate Advertisements with, are defined by the set {C1, C2, ..., Cn}, where n<br>
is the total number of categories. Some sample categories in the system would be: family,<br>
restaurants, nightlife, movies, and entertainment. Let there be a context category weight,<br>
Wi, for each category Ci, where i ? {1, ..., n): The purpose of having context category<br>
weights is to determine the strength of the context in comparison to the advertisement's<br>
category weights, as discussed below.<br>
t<br>
The market research criteria for all existants is represented by P = {p1, p2,<br>
...., pt} where t is the total of all criteria in the database. Each criterion Pj has an associated<br>
weight wj, where j ? {1, ..., t) and each attribute ei will try to satisfy all pj, for all i, j,<br>
where i ? {1, ...,m},j ? {1, ..., t}. Thus, if ei satisfies pj, and pl belongs to category Ck,<br>
then Wk = Wk + wj, where i ? {1, ..., m}, j ? {1, ..., t}, k ? {1, ..., n). This iteration is<br>
used to define the aforementioned context weights of each category.<br>
Once the total context weight for each category, Wk, is defined, its<br>
associated strength ratio, Rk, must be calculated. The strength ratio of a category is used to<br>
determine if the context of the existent is strong enough to merit in the selection of the<br>
Advertisement. For example, if the family category has many criteria in P, then we want<br>
to make sure that the weights corresponding to the context of the existant are in an<br>
acceptable proportion. So, Rk = Wk/Tk, where Tk is the total weight of all criteria in P<br>
relating to category k.<br>
The list of advertisements generated by the demographic query are defined<br>
by the set A = {A1, A2, ..., Ar}, where r is the total number of ads in the list. Each ad Al<br>
has its own category weight xk, where i ? {1, ..., r} and k ? {1, ..., n} which is used in<br>
conjunction with the algorithm's corresponding context category weight ratio Rk.<br>
Thus, once the initial list of Advertisements A has been created by filtering<br>
the demographics and Advertisement type on the database, the steps in the algorithm would<br>
be as follows:<br>
1. Set category weights, Wk, for each category Ck as follows<br>
• Initialize each Wk = 0, where k e {1, ..., n).<br>
• For each i ? {1, ..., m} and for each j ? {1, ..., t}, based on the current<br>
attributes of the existant, {e1, e2, ..., em}, if ei satisfies pj, and pl is associated<br>
with category Ck, then Wk = Wk + wj, where k ? {1, ...,n}<br>
2. Now tabulate the categories' total weights independent of the attributes of the<br>
asistant. From those total weights, establish eacn category's context ratio<br>
• For each k ? {1, ..., n} and for each j ? {1, ...., t}, if Pj is associated with<br>
category Ck, then Tk = Tk + Wj. Set the context category context ratio, Rk<br>
= Wk/Tk<br>
3. For each category k, multiply each Rk by the category weight xk of each Ad Ai, and<br>
then multiply the sum by the sales criteria ratio of the Ad, Si, to get context total Gi<br>
• For each i ? {1, ..., r}, calculate Gi where<br>
Gi = Si (R1x1 + ... + Rnxn)<br>
A. Select the Ad Ai, where i is defined by max(Gi), i ? {1, ..., r}.<br>
The above algorithm can be illustrated by a simple example. Consider an example where a<br>
user is using the service of voice portal 10 while in the movies vertical domain of interest.<br>
The vertical sponsorship Advertisement has been played and the user is just about to<br>
receive information regarding a movie showing. Thus as context, the selection includes the<br>
pointer to the specific existent that is to be played, which is for arguments' sake, "Mission<br>
to Mars". Some of the attributes of the movie showing existant are rating (e.g., R), genre<br>
(e.g., Thriller) and a show time (e.g., 4:00 pm), which can be represented by {e1, e2, e3}.<br>
Thus, there needs to be a list of matching context criteria containing the elements P = {p1,<br>
P2, ..., Pn}. A sample list of criteria could be represented in the database as:<br>
From this table, the categories can be inferred as C = {Emetaiment, Family, Nighture,<br>
Teen, Adult} where k = 5. So from step 1, W1 = 10, W2 = 0, W3 = 50, W4 = 80 and<br>
W5 = 0. From step 2, establish R1 = 1, R2 = 0, R3 = 1, R4 = 0.4 and Rs = 0 (this is<br>
assuming that P has only 8 elements, which will not likely be the case, and will be around<br>
200 or more elements). Now, assume that the Advertisement list A has three<br>
Advertisements. Assume that the weightings of the advertisements' five categories are:<br>
So, from these weightings. {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}, we can make the calculations to get values<br>
for Gi for each Ad Ai, where i ? {1, 2, 3}, as follows:<br>
Gi = Si . (R1x1 + ... + Rnxn)<br>
G1 = 0.8 . ((1)(0.9) +0+ (1)(0.7) + (0.4) (0.9) + 0) = 1.568<br>
G2 = 1.1 . ((1)(0.9) + 0+ (1)(0.9) + (0.4)(0.9) + 0) = 2.376<br>
G3 = 1.0 . ((1)(0.9) + 0 + (1)(0.7) + (0.4)(0.9) + 0) = 1.96<br>
Thus, based on context and sales ratio determination, the "Mission to Mars" Advertisement<br>
is most appropriate. This algorithm notes the context of different categories based on their<br>
relevance to the piece of information being retrieved It also organizes the fact that the<br>
Advertisments that need to be played for sales criteria are noted and factored into the<br>
ordering. The example illustrates only a short list of ads, categories and criteria in P. The<br>
algorithm is intended to take advantage of many more categories and criteria.<br>
FIGURES 37-43 illustrate an exemplary dialog map of the interaction<br>
between the user and voice portal 10. The dialog map described with reference to<br>
FIGURES 37-43 is for illustration purposes only. While only movies, weather, traffic,<br>
stocks, and sports vertical domains of interest are shown in the FIGURES, it should be<br>
apparent that any vertical domain of interest could be included in such a dialog map (and in<br>
the interaction of voice portal 10 with the user), particularly in light of the expansive and<br>
adaptive capabilities available due to data structure models 300, 400, and 450, described<br>
with reference to FIGURES 4-6. Furthermore, the specific blocks representing different<br>
interactions between the user and voice portal 10 are for illustration only. A wide variety<br>
of interactions are possible for each of the many possible vertical domains of interest.<br>
FIGURE 37 illustrates a dialog map 3700 in which after a telephone call is<br>
made by a user to voice portal 10, a block 3710 is performed in which a welcome is<br>
provided. After block 3710, a block 3720 is performed in which a sign-in procedure is<br>
followed (described further with reference to FIGURE 38). After the sign-in procedure of<br>
block 3720, the user can select to have an introduction to the service of voice portal 10 at<br>
blocks 3730 and 3740 or go directly to the runway information for introduction of the<br>
possible vertical domains of interest at a block 3750. Specifically, at block 3730,<br>
introductory information is provided on the service provider. At block 3740, introductory<br>
information is provided on how the service works. At block 3750, voice portal 10 requests<br>
the user to select a domain of interest from a "runway" (e.g., movies, weather, traffic,<br>
stocks, sports).<br>
If the user selects the movies domain of interest, a block 3760 is performed<br>
in which a movies subsystem is executed (described further with reference to FIGURE 39)<br>
and the user has access to movie information and transactions, such as, movie listings,<br>
theaters, and reviews. If the user selects the weather domain of interest, a block 3770 is<br>
performed in which a weather subsystem is executed (described further with reference to<br>
FIGURE 40) and the user has access to weather information, such as, today's forecast or<br>
the extended forecast for a preferred location or any location. If the user selects the traffic<br>
domain of interest, a block 3780 is performed in which a traffic subsystem is executed<br>
(described further with reference to FIGURE 41) and the user has access to traffic<br>
information, such as, reports by city, reports for a certain route, or personalized reports.<br>
If the user selects the stocks domain of interest, a block 3790 is performed in which a<br>
stocks subsystem is executed (described further with reference to FIGURE 42) and the user<br>
has access to stocks information and transactions, such as, market summaries, stock quotes,<br>
stock news, and personalized stock news or transactions (e.g., buy, sell). If the user<br>
selects the sports domain of interest, a block 2500 is performed in which a sport<br>
subsystem is executed (described further with reference to FIGURE 43) and the user has<br>
access to sports information and transactions, such as, sports scores, sports news, sports<br>
events ticket information, and sports fantasy league transactions.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 38, a sign-in subsystem is shown. At a block<br>
3810, caller identification is attempted. One type of user of voice portal 10 is an<br>
unidentified user. The unidentified user calls in (possibly for the first time) and is either<br>
locatable by conventional caller-identification techniques ("caller ID") or not. If the caller-<br>
ID does not exist in database 170, the caller is possibly a new caller. If the caller-ID is<br>
suppressed, voice portal 10 can't tell either way. In one embodiment, voice portal 10 asks<br>
for a phone number (or other identifier) and continues with an "identified" caller. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, voice portal 10 continues without verification. This decision may<br>
depend on the kinds of information being requested. For example, in particular vertical<br>
domains, the identity of the user may need to be determined to identify the user before<br>
proceeding (e.g., auctions).<br>
Identified users are either subscribed or non-subscribed. If the identified<br>
user is subscribed, voice portal 10 has information on the user, such as, credit cards and<br>
preferences from database 170. Preferably, a user subscribes so that voice portal 10 can<br>
start tracking preferences and interests to achieve a higher degree of consumer-value-added<br>
and thus loyalty to the service. The user may specify profile information, including<br>
addresses and credit card numbers, upon subscription. Further, the more information<br>
amassed about a particular caller, the more directed (and hence valuable) advertisements<br>
are.<br>
If caller identification is possible, a block 3820 is performed in which user<br>
confirmation is performed by asking the user for a password. Once the password is<br>
verified, user preferences can be set and control passes to a block 3870 and control returns<br>
to FIGURE 37 where an introduction or runway selection is performed. If the password<br>
given is invalid, control passes to a block 3840.<br>
If caller identification is not possible or the user did not know his or her<br>
password, control passes to a block 3830 where voice portal 10 determines tne user's<br>
account status. If the user does not have an account, control passes to a block 3850 where<br>
an account setup reminder is given that the user should set up an account. If the user has<br>
an account, control passes to block 3840 where voice portal 10 gets the user's account<br>
number. If the user has forgotten the account number, control passes to block 3850 where<br>
the user is asked to set up an account. If the user provides a valid account number, control<br>
passes to block 3820 for user confirmation. If the user gives an account number which is<br>
invalid, control passes to block 3860 where voice portal 10 informs the user that the<br>
account is invalid and to visit a web site or call a support number for assistance. Control<br>
then passes to block 3880 and to FIGURE 37 where an introduction or runway selection is<br>
performed.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 39, a movies subsystem is performed. At a<br>
block 3910, voice portal 10 plays an introduction to the movies domain of interest. The<br>
user can select options, such as, movies at a theater, listings for a movie, and movie<br>
reviews. If the user selects movies at a theater, control passes to a block 3915 in which<br>
voice portal 10 determines the geographic location desired by the user. Various methods<br>
may be employed to determine location, such as, ZIP code, state and city, or preferences.<br>
If there is no theater near the given location, a block 3920 is performed in which a message<br>
is played to inform the user that no theater is located in the given area. After location is<br>
determined, a block 3925 is performed in which theater names within the location are<br>
listed. After block 3925. a block 3930 is performed in which movies are listed which are<br>
playing at theaters within the area. Voice portal 10 requests the user select a movie and<br>
control passes to a block 3935.<br>
Returning now to block 3910, which played an introduction to the movies<br>
domain of interest, if the user requests listings for a movie, a block 3940 is performed in<br>
which voice portal 10 requests the movie title from the user. After block 3940, a block<br>
3945 is performed in which the geographic location desired by the user. As discussed<br>
above, a variety of methods may be used to determine the caller's location. If there are<br>
theaters showing the selected movie, a block 3950 is performed in which the theaters<br>
playing the movie are listed 2nd the user is asked to select from the list Control then<br>
passes to block 3935. If there are no theaters showing the selected movie, a block 3955 is<br>
performed and the times for the movie at the closest locations are provided to the user.<br>
Control then passes to block 3935.<br>
Referring now to block 3910, which played an introduction to the movies<br>
domain of interest, if the user requests a movie review, a block 3960 is performed in which<br>
voice portal 10 requests the movie title from the user. After block 3960, a block 3965 is<br>
performed in which the review is played for the selected movie. After block 3965, a block<br>
3970 is performed in which voice portal 10 asks the user if he or she would like to find<br>
showings for the movie selected. If the user declines, control returns to block 3960 to get<br>
another movie title for a movie review. If the user accepts, control passes to block 3945.<br>
At block 3935, voice portal 10 provides movie showing times for the<br>
selected movie and theater. At a block 3980, voice portal 10 requests a next action. The<br>
user can request the theater address, which is'then provided at a block 3985. The user can<br>
also request a review of the movie, which is then provided at a block 3990. Once the user<br>
wants to leave the movie domain of interest, control returns to block 3750 of FIGURE 37.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 40, a weather subsystem is performed, as shown.<br>
At a block 4010, voice portal 10 plays an introduction to the weather domain of interest.<br>
After the introduction is played at block 4010, control passes to a block 4020 in which<br>
voice portal 10 obtains location information to use in the weather domain of interest. As<br>
described above, multiple methods are possible to obtain location information, such as,<br>
obtaining location from ZIP code, city or state, and other locational indicia. After block<br>
4020, control passes to a block 4030 in which voice portal 10 provides a prompt as to<br>
whether the user would like live weather information or weather information for later<br>
periods of time. If the user selects to hear weather information for later periods of time,<br>
control passes to a block 4040 in which voice portal 10 plays a prompt which provides<br>
weather latency options to the user. If the user wants current weather information or after<br>
the user has selected latency options at a block 4040, control passes to a block 4050 in<br>
which voice portal 10 provides the weather information desired.<br>
After block 4050 is performed, control passes to a block 4060 in which<br>
voice portal 10 asks the user whether an extended forecast is desired. If a extended<br>
forecast is desired, control passes to a block 4070 in which voice portal 10 provides an<br>
extended forecast. After block 4070 or if the user does not want an extended forecast,<br>
control passes to block 4080 in which voice portal 10 asks for the next action from the<br>
user. If the user wants to continue in the weather domain of interest, control passes to<br>
block 4020. If the user wants to leave the weather domain of interest, control passes to a<br>
block 4090 corresponding to the runway described with reference to FIGURE 37 as block<br>
3750.<br>
Referring now to FIGURE 41, a traffic subsystem is performed. At a block<br>
4110, voice portal 10 plays an introduction to the traffic domain of interest. After block<br>
4110, control passes to a block 4115 in which voice portal 10 obtains location information<br>
for user or personalized information on the user. After block 4115, control passes to a<br>
block 4120 in which voice portal 10 obtains city traffic information. If no city traffic<br>
information is possible, control passes to a block 4135 in which ZIP code traffic<br>
information is obtained. ZIP code traffic information is a fallback if a city is not<br>
recognized by voice portal 10. If the city data is not found and data is contained for<br>
locations nearby, control passes to a block 4140 in which voice portal 10 asks for a nearby<br>
city. If at block 4120 no traffic events are reportable, control passes to a block 4125 in<br>
which the user is told no traffic is reportable in the city. If at block 4120 no traffic data is<br>
available, control passes to a block 4130 in which the user is provided the option to try<br>
another city or to go to the runway for selection of a new domain of interest.<br>
After block 4120, control passes to a block 4145 in which voice portal 10<br>
requests a specific traffic route or the "whole city." After block 4145, control passes to a<br>
block 4150 in which voice portal 10 obtains route direction information. After block 4150,<br>
control passes to a block 4155 if there is no traffic on the route to report. At block 4155,<br>
the user is given the option to select a new traffic route or the "whole city" as well as<br>
going to the runway and selecting a new domain of interest. If route traffic information is<br>
available, after block 4150, control passes to a block 4160 in which voice portal 10 lists the<br>
route traffic for the selected route. If the user has selected "whole city" in block 4145,<br>
control passes a block 4165 in which voice portal 10 lists city traffic information.<br>
