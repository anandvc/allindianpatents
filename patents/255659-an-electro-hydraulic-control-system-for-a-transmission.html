ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC CONTROL SYSTEM WITH MULTIPLEXED TRIM<br>
VALVES FOR A TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to an electro-hydraulic control system for a<br>
transmission; specifically, an electro-hydraulic control system having multiplexed trim<br>
valves that is preferably for a countershaft transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Multi-speed power transmissions, particularly those using planetary gear<br>
arrangements, require a hydraulic system to provide controlled engagement and<br>
disengagement, on a desired schedule, of the clutches and brakes or torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms that operate to establish the ratios within the planetary gear arrangement.<br>
[0003]	These control systems have evolved from substantially pure hydraulic<br>
control systems, wherein all of the control signals are produced by hydraulic devices, to<br>
electro-hydraulic control systems, wherein a number of the control signals are produced<br>
by an electronic controller. The electronic controller emits electrical control signals to<br>
solenoid valves, which then issue controlled hydraulic signals to the various operating<br>
valves within the transmission control.<br>
[0004]	With many of the early pure hydraulic and first generation electro-<br>
hydraulic control systems, the power transmission utilized a number of freewheel or<br>
one-way devices which smooth the shifting or ratio interchange of the transmission<br>
during both upshifting and downshifting of the transmission. This relieves the<br>
hydraulic control system from providing for the control of overlap between the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism that was coming on and the torque-transmitting mechanism that<br>
was going off. If this overlap is excessive, the driver feels a shudder in the drivetrain,<br>
and if the overlap is too little, the driver experiences engine flare or a sense of coasting.<br>
The freewheel device prevents this feeling by quickly engaging when the torque<br>
imposed thereon is reversed from a freewheeling state to a transmitting state.<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
2<br>
[0005]	The advent of electro-hydraulic devices gave rise to what is known as<br>
clutch-to-clutch shift arrangements to reduce the complexity of the transmission and the<br>
control. These electro-hydraulic control mechanisms are generally perceived to reduce<br>
cost and reduce the space required for the control mechanism.<br>
[0006]	In addition, with the advent of more sophisticated control mechanisms,<br>
the power transmissions have advanced from two-speed or three-speed transmissions to<br>
five-speed and six-speed transmissions. In at least one presently available six-speed<br>
transmission, just five friction devices are employed to provide six forward speeds,<br>
neutral condition, and a reverse speed.<br>
[0007]	Countershaft transmissions are often a desirable design option as they<br>
typically have low spin losses and offer wide ratio coverage. The relatively large<br>
number of clutches sometimes associated with countershaft transmissions may require<br>
double transition shifts. To reduce the number of components to the extent possible,<br>
clutches are sometimes reused in different speed ratio ranges.<br>
[0008]	It is desirable to provide drive-home capabilities within the transmission<br>
in the event that the electronic system undergoes a malfunction or discontinuance of<br>
operation. The drive-home feature of a power transmission is an important factor in<br>
that it permits the vehicle operator to return home with the vehicle so that the proper<br>
repairs can be undertaken at a repair station rather than in the field where the vehicle<br>
underwent the malfunction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	An electro-hydraulic control system is provided that uses logic valves to<br>
multiplex trim systems to more than one torque-transmitting mechanism, thereby<br>
minimizing the number of required components. Additionally, the electro-hydraulic<br>
control system preferably has more than one failure mode so that the transmission<br>
operates at a respective predetermined speed ratio in the event of an interruption in<br>
electrical power.<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
[0010]	The electro-hydraulic control system controls the selective engagement of<br>
a plurality of torque-transmitting mechanisms in a transmission that provides multiple<br>
speed ratios. The electro-hydraulic control system has a trim valve and a logic valve that<br>
is selectively movable between a first position and a second position. The trim valve<br>
selectively communicates pressurized fluid to the logic valve. The logic valve<br>
multiplexes the trim valve by directing the pressurized fluid to a first toque-transmitting<br>
mechanism for engagement thereof when in the first position and to a second torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism for engagement thereof when in the second position. As used<br>
herein, a valve is "multiplexed" when it has more than one function, such as when it is<br>
able to at least partially control engagement of more than one torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism. Preferably, the electro-hydraulic control system has multiple logic valves<br>
each multiplexing a different trim valve to control engagement of different pairs of the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
[0011]	The electro-hydraulic control system preferably includes a three position<br>
dog clutch actuator valve that controls the position of a dog clutch in the transmission.<br>
The position of two of the logic valves along with a solenoid valve may control the<br>
position of the dog clutch actuator valve, which in turn determines the position of a third<br>
of the logic valves.<br>
[0012]	Preferably, the trim valves are each part of a different trim system that also<br>
includes a solenoid valve energizable by the controller to move the trim valve, thereby<br>
permitting the flow of pressurized fluid therethrough. Some of the solenoids are<br>
normally open-type valves while others are normally closed-type valves such that the<br>
trim valves, the logic valves and the dog clutch actuator valve are positioned to establish<br>
different preferred "failure modes" in the event of an electrical power failure. The<br>
electro-hydraulic control system establishes one "failure mode" that is a speed ratio<br>
included in a first set of the speed ratios attainable by the transmission if there is an<br>
electrical power failure when the transmission is operating in any of the speed ratios in<br>
the first set, and establishes another "failure mode" that is a different speed ratio included<br>
in a second set of speed ratios attainable by the transmission if there is an electrical power<br>
failure when the transmission is operating in any of the speed ratios of the second set.<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
4<br>
[0013]	When system established the failure mode that is a speed ratio in the<br>
second set, the dog clutch actuator valve is in a neutral position which latches two of the<br>
logic valves to prevent movement thereof. Another logic valve is energizable to<br>
selectively break the latch and allow movement of these two logic valves. The latching<br>
of the logic valves X and Y provides the ability to achieve the high speed, power-off<br>
failure mode.<br>
[0014]	Preferably, the transmission is a countershaft transmission with seven<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms, including the dog clutch, as well as a torque-converter<br>
clutch to lockup a torque converter. The electro-hydraulic control system described<br>
above controls engagement and disengagement of these torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
to attain nine forward and at least two reverse speed ratios. (A speed ratio is also referred<br>
to herein as a speed ratio range.)<br>
[0015]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
5<br>
[0019]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers represent the<br>
same or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
powertrain 10. The powertrain 10 includes a power source or engine 12, a torque<br>
converter 14 and a countershaft transmission 16. The torque converter 14 is connected<br>
with the engine 12 and with a transmission input member 18 via a turbine 20. Selective<br>
engagement of a torque converter clutch TCC allows the engine 12 to be directly<br>
connected with the input shaft 18, bypassing the torque converter 14. The input<br>
member 18 is typically a shaft, and may be referred to as an input shaft herein. The<br>
torque converter 14 includes the turbine 20, a pump 24 and a stator 26. The converter<br>
stator 26 is grounded to a casing 30 through a typical one-way clutch that is not shown.<br>
A damper 28 is operatively connected to the engaged torque converter clutch TCC for<br>
absorbing vibration.<br>
[0020]	The transmission 16 includes a plurality of intermeshing gears, a first<br>
countershaft 32, a second countershaft 34. an intermediate shaft 36 and an output member<br>
38. which may be a shaft. The transmission 16 further includes a pluralit} of torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms, including the torque converter clutch TCC, six rotating<br>
clutches: C1, C2. C3, C4, C5 and C7; and one stationary clutch C6. Torque is transferred<br>
from the input member 18 to the output member 38 along various powerflow paths<br>
through the transmission 16 depending on which of the plurality of selectively engagable<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms are engaged.<br>
[0021]	Clutch C4 is selectively engagable to connect the input member 18 for<br>
rotation with the intermediate shaft 36. Gear 40 rotates with the input member 18 and<br>
continuously intermeshes with gear 42. which rotates with the second countershaft 34.<br>
Gear 44 rotates with input member 18 and continuously intermeshes with gear 46, which<br>
rotates with the first countershaft 32. Gear 48 rotates with sleeve shaft 51 which is<br>
concentric with first countershaft 32 and is selectively connectable with the first<br>
countershaft 32 by engagement of clutch C3. Gear 48 continuously intermeshes with<br>
gear 50, which rotates with intermediate shaft 36. Gear 50 also continuously intermeshes<br>
with gear 52, which rotates with sleeve shaft 53, which is concentric with second<br>
countershaft 34 and is selectively connectable for rotation with second countershaft 34 by<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
6<br>
engagement of clutch C5. Gear 54 rotates with sleeve shaft 55 which is concentric with<br>
and selectively connectable for rotation with first countershaft 32 by engagement of<br>
clutch C1. Gear 54 continuously intermeshes with gear 56 (in a different plane than the<br>
two-dimensional schematic, as indicated by the dashed lines therebetween). Gear 56<br>
rotates about and is selectively connectable for rotation with a sleeve shaft 57 by the<br>
positioning of a dog clutch DOG in a reverse position indicated as R. The sleeve shaft 57<br>
is selectively connectable for rotation with the second countershaft 34 by engagement of<br>
clutch C2. Gear 58 rotates with the sleeve shaft 55 and continuously intermeshes with<br>
gear 60, which rotates with the intermediate shaft 36. Gear 60 continuously intermeshes<br>
with the gear 62, which is selectively connectable for rotation with the sleeve shaft 57 by<br>
positioning of the dog clutch DOG in a forward position indicated by F in the Figure 1.<br>
[0022]	The transmission 16 further includes a planetary gear set 64 with a sun<br>
gear member 66 connected for rotation with the intermediate shaft 36, a ring gear<br>
member 68 selectively connectable for rotation with the intermediate shaft 36 by<br>
engagement of clutch C7, a carrier member 70 connected for rotation with the output<br>
member 38 and rotatably supporting planet gears 72 that intermesh with both the sun gear<br>
member 66 and the ring gear member 68. A clutch C6 is selectively engagable to ground<br>
the ring gear member 68 to the stationary member 30.<br>
[0023]	In a preferred embodiment, the following gear tooth counts are used: gear<br>
40 has 39 teeth; gear 42 has 37 teeth: gear 46 has 40 teeth: gear 44 has 3 1 teeth; gear 48<br>
has 34 teeth; gear 50 has 31 teeth; gear 52 has 34 teeth; gear 54 has 62 teeth; gear 56 has<br>
46 teeth; gear 58 has 26 teeth; gear 60 has 44 teeth; gear 62 has 26 teeth; ring gear<br>
member 68 has 85 teeth and sun gear member 66 has 35 teeth. By the selective<br>
engagement of the torque-transmitting mechanisms TCC, C1, C2. C3. C4. C5, C6. C7<br>
and DOG according to the table of Figure 3, and assuming the tooth counts listed above,<br>
the following sample numerical speed ratios are attained between the input member 12<br>
and the output member 14 for the following speed ratio ranges: second reverse speed<br>
ratio range (R2): 2.18; first reverse speed ratio range (R1): 7.42; first forward speed ratio<br>
(1st 7.49; second forward speed ratio (2nd): 5.51; third forward speed ratio (3rd): 4.03;<br>
fourth forward speed ratio (4th): 2.97; fifth forward speed ratio (5th): 2.18; sixth forward<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
7<br>
speed ratio (6th): 1.61; seventh forward speed ratio (7th): 1.18: eighth forward speed ratio<br>
(8th): 1.00; ninth forward speed ratio (9th): 0.87. Alternate solenoid-energizing schemes<br>
are available for the first, third, fifth and seventh speed ratio ranges with one or more of<br>
the logic valves in different positions for the same range. For example, three different<br>
alternate seventh forward speed ratios (7th'), (7th") and (7th'") are available by<br>
energizing solenoids associated with different ones of the logic valves X. Y. Z and W. as<br>
discussed below and indicated in Figure 3.<br>
[0024]	The selective engagement and disengagement of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system 74, which is shown in<br>
further detail in Figures 2A and 2B. The electro-hvdraulic control svstem 74 includes an<br>
electronic controller 76, which may be one or more control units and is referred to as<br>
ECU in Figure 1, as well as a hydraulic control portion 100 referred to as HYD in Figure<br>
1. The electronic controller 76 is programmable to provide electrical control signals to<br>
the hydraulic control portion 100 to establish the fluid pressures that control engagement<br>
and disengagement of the torque-transmitting mechanisms TCC, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6,<br>
C7 and DOG. Electrical signals are also sent to the electronic controller 76 based on<br>
fluid pressure in the hydraulic control portion 100 to provide feedback information such<br>
as information indicative of valve positions. The locations of various pressure switches<br>
which provide such feedback are indicated as pressure switches SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4,<br>
SW5, SW6, SW7 and SW8 in Figures 2A and 2B.<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figures 2A and 2B, the hydraulic control portion 100 includes<br>
a main regulator valve 104, a control regulator valve 106, an EBF (exhaust back flow)<br>
regulator valve 108. a converter flow valve 1 10, and a lube regulator valve 112. The<br>
main regulator valve 104 is in fluid communication with a hydraulic pump 114, such as a<br>
variable volume pump, that draws fluid from a reservoir 116 for delivery to a main<br>
passage 118. The control regulator valve 106 is in fluid communication with the main<br>
regulator valve 104, and establishes a reduced control pressure within passage 117, which<br>
is then communicated to other valves described below, depending upon their position.<br>
The EBF regulator valve 108 is operable to vent pressurized fluid within passage 117 to<br>
exhaust should an over pressurized condition occur. Pump 119 is an engine-driven pump<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
8<br>
that also draws fluid from reservoir 116 and that controls the lubrication pressure to a<br>
lubrication system 121 and provides cooling fluid to a transmission cooling system 123.<br>
[0026]	The hydraulic control portion 100 includes many solenoid valves, such as<br>
variable pressure type solenoid valves PCS1, PCS2. PCS3. PCS4, PCS5. PCS6. and<br>
PCS7, and shift-type (i.e.. on/off type) solenoid valves SS1, SS2 and SS3. Each solenoid<br>
valve is in electric signal communication with the control unit 76 and is actuated upon<br>
receipt of a control signal therefrom. The solenoid valves PCS1, PCS7 and PCS5 are<br>
normally high or normally open-type solenoid valves, while the remaining solenoid<br>
valves PCS2. PCS3. PCS4. PCS6. SS1, SS2 and SS3 are normally low or normally<br>
closed-type solenoid valves. As is well known, an open solenoid valve will distribute<br>
output pressure in the absence of an electrical signal to the solenoid. As used herein, a<br>
normally high-type solenoid is energized by a control signal to be placed in and to remain<br>
in a closed position, while a normally low-type valve is energized to be placed in and to<br>
remain in a closed position.<br>
[0027]	The hydraulic control portion 100 also includes a plurality of trim valves<br>
120, 122. 124. 126, 128 and 130. Trim valve 120. solenoid valve PCS1 and a spring-<br>
biased relief valve 132 are a first trim system that, as will be further explained below, is<br>
multiplexed to control engagement and disengagement of both clutch C1 and clutch C4.<br>
Trim valve 122, solenoid valve PCS2 and accumulator valve 134 are a second trim<br>
system that is multiplexed to control engagement and disengagement of both clutch C2<br>
and C5. Trim valve 124, solenoid valve PCS3 and accumulator valve 136 are a third trim<br>
system that is multiplexed to control engagement and disengagement of both clutch C3<br>
and C7 (for clutch C7, only for some speed ratios). Trim valve 126. solenoid valve<br>
PCS4. converter flow valve 110 and accumulator valve 138 are a fouith trim system that<br>
controls engagement of the torque-converter clutch TCC. Trim valve 128, solenoid valve<br>
PCS6 and accumulator valve 140 are a fifth trim system that controls engagement and<br>
disengagement of clutch C6. Trim valve 130, solenoid valve PCS7 and accumulator<br>
valve 142 are a sixth trim system that controls engagement of clutch C7 in those speed<br>
ratios for which the third trim system is not controlling. For each trim system, actuation<br>
of the associated solenoid valve causes actuation of the respective trim valve and clutch<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
9<br>
(or one of the respective clutches in the case of multiplexed trim valves). Solenoid valve<br>
PCS5 and the main regulator valve 104 control the main pressure level in main passage<br>
118 from the pump 114.<br>
[0028]	The hydraulic control portion 100 further includes logic valves X, Y, Z<br>
and W. and a dog clutch actuator valve 144. Solenoid SS1 receives an electrical control<br>
signal from the control unit 76 to actuate or shift, thereby shifting logic valve X. The<br>
position of logic valve X controls in part the position of dog clutch actuator valve 144, as<br>
the downward shift on the logic valve X (moving from a spring-set position to a<br>
pressure-set position) caused by energizing solenoid SS1 allows pressurized fluid<br>
provided from passage 1 18 in passage 143 to pass through the logic valve X into passage<br>
146 in communication with the dog clutch actuator valve 144. Solenoid valve SS2<br>
receives an electrical control signal from the control unit 76 to actuate or shift, thereby<br>
shifting logic valve Y. allowing pressurized fluid provided from passage 118 in passage<br>
143	to pass through logic valves X and Y into outlet passage 148 in communication with<br>
dog clutch actuator valve 144. Solenoid valve SS3 receives an electrical control signal<br>
from the control unit 76 to actuate or shift, thereby allowing pressurized fluid from<br>
passage 164 to outlet passage 151 in communication with both logic valve W and dog<br>
clutch actuator valve 144. The pressurized fluid in passage 151 causes the logic valve W<br>
to shift downward in Figure 2B, allowing fluid in passage 155 to be exhausted.<br>
[0029]	The position of logic valve Z is controlled by the position of the dog<br>
clutch actuator valve 144. (It should be appreciated that the dog clutch actuator valve<br>
144	has two separately movable valve components, a spool valve 157 and a plug valve<br>
159.) Specifically, when the dog clutch actuator valve 144 is in a reverse position (as<br>
depicted in Figure 2B) controlled pressure fluid provided to passage 161 from passage<br>
117 is not provided to logic valve Z through passage 163. However, when the dog clutch<br>
actuator valve is in either the neutral position or the forward position, the controlled<br>
pressure fluid from passage 161 is provided to passage 163 through restricted passage<br>
165A to move the logic valve Z from a spring-set position to a pressure-set position.<br>
Restricted passage 165B is in fluid communication with switch SW8 and restricted<br>
passage 165C is in fluid communication with passage 153. Two exhaust ports, EX1 and<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
10<br>
EX2, are in fluid communication with the dog clutch actuator valve 144 and two switches<br>
SW7 and SW8 are in communication with the valve 144 to monitor its position based on<br>
pressure readings. Pressure switch SW7 exhausts through exhaust port EX1, depending<br>
on the position of the spool valve 157. Also depending on the position of the spool valve<br>
157, Pressure switch SW8 exhausts through the cavity formed by the portion of the<br>
central bore of dog clutch actuator valve 144 (which is attached to a sump), shown just<br>
below pressure switch SW8.<br>
[0030]	Referring to Figure 3. a table shows the steady-state conditions of the<br>
following valves during available speed ratios (also referred to as ranges): logic valves<br>
W, X, Y and Z, dog clutch actuator valve 144. and pressure control solenoid valves<br>
PCS1, PCS2, PCS3. PCS4. PCS5, PCS6 and PCS7. With respect to the logic valves W.<br>
X. Y and Z, an "0" in the chart indicates that the valve is in a spring-set position<br>
("unstroked") and a "1" indicates that the valve is in a pressure-set position ("stroked").<br>
With respect to the dog clutch actuator valve 144, an "R" indicates that the dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 is in a reverse position (with the spool valve 157 and plug valve 159<br>
each in their relatively lowest positions as they appear in Figure 2B). Switch SW7 will<br>
indicate a relatively low pressure condition (i.e., a low logic state) and switch SW8 will<br>
indicate a relatively high pressure condition (i.e., a high logic state). Exhaust ports<br>
EX1 and EX2 will exhaust. An "F" indicates that the dog clutch actuator valve 144 is in<br>
a forward position, with the spool valve 157 in its relatively highest position with an<br>
uppermost part of the spool valve 157 shown in Figure 2B experiencing exhaust pressure<br>
fluid in passage 146 and a lowest portion of the plug valve 159 experiencing exhaust<br>
pressure in passage 148, and flow of controlled pressure from passage 117 permitted<br>
across the valve to passage 163. Switch SW7 will indicate a relatively high pressure<br>
condition and switch SW8 will indicate a relatively low pressure condition. Exhaust<br>
ports EX1 and EX2 will exhaust. An "N" indicates that the dog clutch actuator valve 144<br>
is in a neutral position in which the upper and lower ends of the valve are subjected to<br>
main pressure fluid from passages 146 and 148, respectively, and flow of controlled<br>
pressure fluid from passage 117 permitted across the valve 144 to both passages 153 and<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>

163. Switches SW7 and SW8 will both indicate a relatively high pressure condition.<br>
Exhaust ports EX1 and EX2 will exhaust.<br>
[0031]	With respect to the columns in Figure 3 for the respective pressure control<br>
solenoid valves PCS1, PCS2, PCS3, PCS4, PCS6 and PCS7. the clutch listed for a<br>
particular speed ratio in a column for a particular solenoid valve indicates that the<br>
solenoid valve is in fluid communication with that clutch during that speed ratio. If the<br>
box listing the clutch is not shaded, then the solenoid is not energized in the case of a<br>
normally closed-type solenoid or is energized in the case of a normally open-type<br>
solenoid, and the listed clutch is not engaged. If the box is shaded, then the solenoid is<br>
energized in the case of a normally closed-type solenoid or is not energized in the case of<br>
a normally-open type solenoid, and the listed clutch is thereby engaged. With respect to<br>
PCS5, "MM" indicates that the pressure control solenoid PCS5 is being energized as<br>
necessary to control an output pressure in passage 149 that controls a pressure bias on the<br>
main regulator valve 104. The pressure control solenoid PCS5, by varying the pressure<br>
within passage 149, is operable to vary the operating characteristics of the main regulator<br>
valve 104, thereby modulating the pressure within the passage 118. The column of<br>
Figure 2 labeled "Exhaust" indicates which of the clutches are being exhausted (emptied<br>
of pressurized fluid) during each of the various speed ratios.<br>
[0032]	As is apparent from the chart of Figure 3. the pressure control solenoid<br>
PCS1 and the first trim system of which it is a part is multiplexed to control the<br>
engagement and disengagement of both clutches C1 and C4. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS2 and the second trim system of which it is a part is multiplexed to control<br>
the engagement and disengagement of both clutches C2 and C5. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS3 and the third trim system of which it is a part is multiplexed to control the<br>
engagement and disengagement of both clutches C3 and C7 (at least for ranges reverse<br>
(R2). reverse (R1), startup and neutral conditions, and the first forward speed ratio range<br>
(1st). For ranges above the first forward speed ratio range (1st), pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS7 controls the engagement and disengagement of clutch C7. Pressure<br>
control solenoid PCS4 controls the engagement of the torque-converter clutch TCC.<br>
Pressure control solenoid PCS6 controls the engagement of clutch C6, except in speed<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
12<br>
ratio ranges (7th"), (7th'"). (8th) and (9th). In these speed ratios, clutch C6 is not<br>
engaged, and is also not affected by the state of the pressure control solenoid PCS6. The<br>
dashed lines in the chart of Figure 3 indicate that the respective pressure control solenoid<br>
and trim system are decoupled from the respective clutch. The column labeled "Exhaust"<br>
indicates, for each speed ratio range, clutches that are being exhausted through the logic<br>
valves. The remaining clutches that are not engaged are exhausted through the associated<br>
trim valves.<br>
[0033]	Figures 2A and 2B depict the hydraulic control portion 100 with the<br>
positioning of the valves corresponding to the second reverse speed ratio range (R2) of<br>
Figure 3. When operating in the reverse speed ratio range (R2), the trim valves 122 and<br>
124 are pressure-set and trim valve 120 is spring-set by energizing the solenoids PCS2,<br>
PCS3. and PCS1. respectively. The remaining trim valves 126, 128 and 130. and the<br>
logic valves X. Y, Z and W remain in a spring-set position. With the above-stated valve<br>
configuration, the main pressure in passage 118 is in fluid communication with clutches<br>
C2 and C7, which will engage, while clutches C3, C4, and C5 will exhaust. To effect the<br>
engagement of clutch C2. pressurized fluid from the passage 150 is communicated to the<br>
outlet passage 152 of the trim valve 122. Because it is in the spring-set position, the logic<br>
valve Y will communicate the fluid within the passage 152 to the clutch C2. To effect<br>
the engagement of the clutch C7, pressurized fluid within the passage 154 is<br>
communicated to the outlet passage 156 of the trim valve 124. Because it is in the<br>
spring-set position, the logic valve Z will communicate the fluid within passage 156 to<br>
the clutch C7.<br>
[0034]	When operating in the first reverse speed ratio range (R1), the trim valves<br>
122 and 128 are pressure-set and trim valve 120 is spring-set by energizing solenoids<br>
PCS2, PCS6 and PCS1, respectively. The remaining trim valves 124. 126 and 130, and<br>
the logic valves X. Y, Z and W remain in a spring-set position. With the above-stated<br>
valve configuration, the main pressure in passage 118 is in fluid communication with<br>
clutches C2 and C6, which will engage, while clutches C3, C4, and C5 will exhaust. To<br>
effect the engagement of clutch C2, pressurized fluid from the passage 150 is<br>
communicated to the outlet passage 152 of the trim valve 122. Because it is in the<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
13<br>
spring-set position, the logic valve Y will communicate the fluid within the passage 152<br>
to the clutch C2. To effect the engagement of clutch C6, pressurized fluid within passage<br>
158 is communicated to outlet passage 160 of trim valve 128. Because they are in the<br>
spring-set position, logic valve X and logic valve Y communicate the fluid within<br>
passage 118 to passage 158.<br>
[0035]	When starting the engine 12 of Figure 1 (indicated in Figure 3 as<br>
"startup"), the logic valve X and the trim valve 128 are pressure-set and trim valve 120 is<br>
spring-set by energizing the solenoids SS1, PCS6, and PCS1, respectively. The<br>
remaining trim valves 120, 124, 126 and 130, and logic valves Y, Z and W remain in a<br>
spring-set position. With the above-stated valve configuration, the main pressure in<br>
passage 118 is in fluid communication with clutch C6, which will engage, while clutches<br>
C1, C3, and C5 will exhaust. To effect the engagement of clutch C6, pressurized fluid<br>
within passage 158 is communicated to outlet passage 160 of trim valve 128. The<br>
pressure-set position of logic valve X and the spring-set position of logic valve Y allow<br>
fluid in passage 118 to be communicated to passage 158.<br>
[0036]	When operating in the neutral state, indicated as "N" in Figure 3, the trim<br>
valve 128 is pressure-set and trim valve 120 spring set by energizing solenoids PCS6 and<br>
PCS1, respectively. The remaining trim valves 124, 126 and 130, and the logic valves X,<br>
Y. Z and W remain in a spring-set position. With the above-stated valve configuration,<br>
the main pressure in passage 118 is in fluid communication with clutch C6, which will<br>
engage, while clutches C3, C4 and C5 will exhaust. To effect the engagement of clutch<br>
C6, pressurized fluid within passage 158 is communicated to outlet passage 160 of trim<br>
valve 128. Because they are in the spring-set position, logic valve X and logic valve Y<br>
communicate the fluid within passage 118 to passage 158.<br>
[0037]	When operating in the first forward speed ratio range (1st), the trim valves<br>
120 and 128 are pressure-set by not energizing solenoid PCS 1 and energizing PCS6.<br>
respectively. (Note that, because PCS1 is normally open, in a steady state condition, no<br>
energizing control signal is required in order to pressure-set the trim valve 120.) The<br>
remaining trim valves 122, 124, 126 and 130. and the logic valves X. Y. Z and W remain<br>
in a spring-set position. With the above-stated valve configuration, the main pressure in<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
14<br>
passage 118 is in fluid communication with clutches C1 and C6. which will engage,<br>
while clutches C3, C4, and C5 exhaust. To effect engagement of clutch C1, pressurized<br>
fluid within passage 150 is communicated to outlet passage 162 of trim valve 120. To<br>
effect the engagement of clutch C6, pressurized fluid within passage 158 is<br>
communicated to outlet passage 160 of trim valve 128. Because they are in the spring-set<br>
position, logic valve X and logic valve Y communicate the fluid within passage 118 to<br>
passage 158.<br>
[0038]	When operating in the alternate first forward speed ratio range (1st"), in<br>
addition to pressure-setting trim valves 120 and 128 as in the first forward speed ratio<br>
range (1st), trim valve 126 is also pressure-set by energizing solenoid valve PCS4.<br>
Solenoid valve SS3 is also energized to shift the dog clutch actuator valve 144 to a<br>
forward position, thus blocking exhaust of controlled pressure fluid from passage 117 in<br>
passage 161 provided to passage 163 through restricted passage 165A, to move the logic<br>
valve Z from a spring-set position to a pressure-set position. Solenoid valve SS3 is no<br>
longer energized after the dog clutch actuator valve 144 moves to the forward position, as<br>
confirmed by the pressure switches SW7 and SW8 shown in communication with the dog<br>
clutch actuator valve 144. and control pressure in passage 151 is exhausted, to eliminate<br>
unnecessary loading of the dog clutch DOG. With the above-stated valve configuration,<br>
the main pressure in passage 118 is in fluid communication with clutches C1 and C6,<br>
which will engage. The main pressure in passage 118 is communicated to the converter<br>
flow valve 110 via passage 164 across trim valve 126 to passage 167. Clutches C4. and<br>
C5 exhaust.<br>
[0039]	When operating in the second forward speed ratio range (2nd), the trim<br>
valves 122, 126 and 128 are pressure-set and trim valves 120 and 130 are spring-set benergizing solenoids PCS2, PCS4, PCS6, PCS1 and PCS7. respectively. If the second<br>
forward speed ratio range is attained in a shift from the first alternate speed ratio range<br>
(1st'), then the dog clutch actuator valve 144 remains in the forward position and the<br>
logic valve Z in a pressure-set position due to the previous actuation of the dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 in the first alternate forward speed ratio range (1st'). The remaining<br>
trim valves 120 and 124 remain in a spring-set position. With the above-stated valve<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
15<br>
configuration, clutches C2, TCC and C6 will be in an engaged position while clutches C4<br>
and C5 exhaust. To effect engagement of clutch C2. pressurized fluid within passage 150<br>
is communicated to outlet passage 152 of trim valve 122. To effect the engagement of<br>
clutch C6, pressurized fluid within passage 158 is communicated to outlet passage 160 of<br>
trim valve 128. Because they are in the spring-set position, logic valve X and logic valve<br>
Y communicate the fluid within passage 118 to passage 158. To effect engagement of<br>
clutch TCC, trim valve 126 is pressure-set by energizing solenoid valve PCS4, so that the<br>
main pressure in passage 118 is communicated to the converter valve 110 via passage<br>
164 across trim valve 126 to passage 167.<br>
[0040]	When operating in the third forward speed ratio range (3rd), the trim<br>
valves 124, 126 and 128 are pressure-set and trim valves 120 and 130 are spring-set by<br>
energizing solenoids PCS3, PCS4, PCS6, PCS1 and PCS7, respectively. The dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 remains in the forward position and the logic valve Z in a pressure-set<br>
position due to the previous actuation of the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in the first<br>
alternate forward speed ratio range (1st") or in the second forward speed ratio range<br>
(2nd), as described above. The remaining trim valve 122 remains in a spring-set position.<br>
With the above-stated valve configuration, clutches C3, TCC and C6 will be in an<br>
engaged position while clutches C4 and C5 will exhaust. To effect engagement of clutch<br>
C3, pressurized fluid from passage 118 within passage 154 is communicated to outlet<br>
passage 156 of the trim valve 124 and through the pressure-set logic valve Z to clutch C3.<br>
To effect engagement of clutch TCC. trim valve 126 is pressure-set by energizing<br>
solenoid valve PCS4. To effect engagement of clutch C6, pressurized fluid within<br>
passage 158 is communicated to outlet passage 160 of trim valve 128. Because they are<br>
in the spring-set position, logic valve X and logic valve Y communicate the fluid within<br>
passage 118 to passage 158.<br>
[0041]	When operating in the alternate third forward speed ratio range (3rd'), the<br>
trim valves 124, 126 and 128 are pressure-set and trim valves 120 and 130 are spring set<br>
by energizing solenoids PCS3. PCS4. PCS6. PCS1 and PCS7, respectively, to cause<br>
engagement of clutches C3, TCC and C6, as described above with respect to the third<br>
forward speed ratio range (3rd). The dog clutch actuator valve 144 remains in the<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
16<br>
forward position and the logic valve Z in a pressure-set position due to the previous<br>
actuation of the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in the first alternate forward speed ratio<br>
range (1st") or in the second forward speed ratio range (2nd), as described above.<br>
Additionally, solenoid valve SS2 is energized to move the logic valve Y to a pressure-set<br>
position, thus allowing main pressure from passage 118 in communication with passage<br>
169 to flow across the logic valve Y to outlet passage 148, moving the plug valve 159 of<br>
the dog clutch actuator valve 144 upward. Additionally, the shifting of logic valve Y<br>
puts exhaust pressure rather then main pressure into communication with the switches<br>
SW2 and SW1 at the trim valves 120 and 128, respectively.<br>
[0042]	When operating in the fourth forward speed ratio range (4th), trim valves<br>
122. 126 and 128 are pressure-set and trim valves 120 and 130 are spring-set by<br>
energizing solenoids PCS2, PCS4, PCS6, PCS1 and PCS7, respectively. The dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 remains in the forward position and the logic valve Z in a pressure-set<br>
position due to the previous actuation of the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in the first<br>
alternate forward speed ratio range (1st') or in the second forward speed ratio range<br>
(2nd), as described above. Solenoid valve SS2 is energized to place logic valve Y in a<br>
pressure-set position. With the above-stated valve configuration, clutches C5, TCC and<br>
C6 will be in an engaged position while clutches C2 and C4 will exhaust. Engagement of<br>
the clutches TCC and C6 are as described above with respect to the third forward speed<br>
ratio range (3rd). To effect engagement of clutch C5, solenoid PCS2 is energized to<br>
move trim valve 122 to a pressure-set position. Pressurized fluid from passage 118 in<br>
communication with passage 150 is communicated to outlet passage 152 across trim<br>
valve 122 and then across the pressure-set logic valve Y into communication with clutch<br>
C5.<br>
[0043]	When operating in the fifth forward speed ratio range (5th), trim valves<br>
120, 126 and 130 are pressure-set. Solenoid PCS4 is energized to pressure-set trim valve<br>
126. but solenoids PCS1 and PCS7 are not energized to pressure-set trim valves 120 and<br>
130, as these are normally open-type solenoid valves. The dog clutch actuator valve 144<br>
remains in the forward position and the logic valve Z in a pressure-set position due to the<br>
previous actuation of the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in the first alternate forward speed<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
17<br>
ratio range (1st") or in the second forward speed ratio range (2nd), as described above.<br>
Solenoid valve SS2 is energized to place logic valve Y in a pressure-set position. With<br>
the above-stated valve configuration, clutches C1, TCC and C7 will be in an engaged<br>
position while clutches C2 and C4 will exhaust. To effect engagement of clutch C1.<br>
pressurized fluid within passage 150 is communicated to outlet passage 162 of trim valve<br>
120. With the logic valve X in the spring-set position, fluid in passage 162<br>
communicates with the clutch C1 across the logic valve X. To effect the engagement of<br>
clutch TCC. trim valve 126 is pressure-set by energizing solenoid PCS4. To effect the<br>
engagement of clutch C7, pressurized fluid within passage 154 is communicated to outlet<br>
passage 173 and across the pressure-set logic valve Z to the clutch C7. With the logic<br>
valve Y in a pressure-set position, pressurized fluid in passage 152 can exhaust.<br>
[0044]	When operating in the alternate fifth forward speed ratio range (5th"). trim<br>
valves 120, 126 and 130 are pressure-set, by energizing solenoid PCS4. but not solenoids<br>
PCS 1 or PCS7. as described above with respect to the fifth forward speed ratio range<br>
(5th). The dog clutch actuator valve 144 remains in the forward position and the logic<br>
valve Z in a pressure-set position due to the previous actuation of the dog clutch actuator<br>
valve 144 in the first alternate forward speed ratio range (1st") or in the second forward<br>
speed ratio range (2nd), as described above. With the above-stated valve configuration,<br>
the clutches C1, TCC and C7 are engaged (as described above with respect to the fifth<br>
forward speed ratio range (5th)) while the clutches C4 and C5 exhaust.<br>
[0045]	When operating in the sixth forward speed ratio range (6th). trim valves<br>
122, 126 and 130 are pressure-set. Solenoids PCS2 and PCS4 are energized to pressure-<br>
set trim valves C2 and TCC, respective!}, but solenoid valve PCS7 is not energized, as it<br>
is normally open. The dog clutch actuator valve 144 remains in the forward position and<br>
the logic valve Z in a pressure-set position due to the previous actuation of the dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 in the first alternate forward speed ratio range (1st") or in the second<br>
forward speed ratio range (2nd), as described above. With the above-stated valve<br>
configuration, clutches C2, TCC and C7 will engage while clutches C4 and C5 will<br>
exhaust. To effect engagement of clutch C2, pressurized fluid within passage 150 is<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
18<br>
communicated to outlet passage 152 of trim valve 122. The clutches TCC and C7 arc<br>
engaged as described above with respect to the fifth forward speed ratio range (5th).<br>
[0046]	When operating in the seventh forward speed ratio range (7th), trim valves<br>
124, 126 and 130 are pressure-set. Solenoids PCS3 and PCS4 are energized to pressure-<br>
set trim valves 124 and 126, respectively, but solenoid valve PCS7 is not energized, as it<br>
is normally open. The dog clutch actuator valve 144 remains in the forward position and<br>
the logic valve Z in a pressure-set position due to the previous actuation of the dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 in the first alternate forward speed ratio range (1st") or in the second<br>
forward speed ratio range (2nd), as described above. With the above-stated valve<br>
configuration, clutches C3. TCC and C7 will engage while clutches C4 and C5 will<br>
exhaust. To effect engagement of clutch C3, pressurized fluid from passage 118 within<br>
passage 154 is communicated to outlet passage 156 of the trim valve 124 and through the<br>
pressure-set logic valve Z to clutch C3.The clutches TCC and C7 are engaged as<br>
described above with respect to the fifth forward speed ratio range (5th).<br>
[0047]	When operating in the seventh alternate forward speed ratio range (7th'),<br>
trim valves and solenoids are energized as described with respect to the seventh forward<br>
speed ratio range (7th). except that solenoid valve SS2 is also energized to place the Y<br>
valve into a pressure-set position, thus providing pressurized fluid to channel 148. control<br>
pressure to channel 175, and exhaust fluid to channel 171, causing the pressure at switch<br>
SW2 in communication with trim valve 120 to be exhaust pressure and pressure at switch<br>
SW1 in communication with trim valve 128 to be control pressure.<br>
[0048]	When operating in the seventh alternate forward speed ratio range (7th').<br>
trim valves and solenoids are energized as described with respect to the seventh forward<br>
speed ratio range (7th), except that solenoid valves SS1 and SS2 are also energized.<br>
Energizing solenoid valve SS1 places logic valve X in a pressure-set position to allow<br>
pressurized fluid from passage 143 to passage 146 and shifts the dog actuator clutch<br>
valve 144 to a neutral position, while preventing the pressurized fluid in passage 143<br>
from reaching passage 174. changing the monitored pressures at the switches SW3 and<br>
SW4 associated with trim valves 122 and 124 from high pressure to low pressure and the<br>
monitored pressure at the lower switch SW8 associated with the dog clutch actuator valve<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
19<br>
144 from exhaust pressure to control pressure. With the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in<br>
a neutral position, logic valve Z is in a pressure-set position. Solenoid valve SS2 is also<br>
energized to place logic valve Y into a pressure-set position, thus providing pressurized<br>
fluid to channel 148 and exhaust fluid to channel 171, causing the pressure at switch SW2<br>
associated with trim valve 120 to be at exhaust pressure and pressure at switch SW1<br>
associated with trim valve 128 to be at control pressure.<br>
[0049]	When operating in the seventh alternate forward speed ratio range (7th'"),<br>
trim valves and solenoids are energized as described with respect to the seventh forward<br>
speed ratio range (7th), except that solenoid valves SS1, SS2 and SS3 are also energized.<br>
Energizing solenoid valves SS1 and SS2 has the effects described above with respect to<br>
speed ratio range (7th' '). Energizing solenoid valve SS3 as well moves logic valve W to<br>
a pressure-set position, thus exhausting fluid in channel 155.<br>
[0050]	When operating in the eighth forward speed ratio range (8th), trim valves<br>
124, 126 and 130 are pressure-set. Solenoid valve PCS4 is energized to pressure-set trim<br>
valve 126, but solenoid valves PCS1 and PCS7 are not. as these are normally open-type<br>
solenoid valves. Solenoid valves SS1 and SS2 are also energized to move the logic-<br>
valves X and Y. respectively, to pressure-set positions, causing the dog clutch actuator<br>
valve 144 to be in a neutral position. With logic valve X in a pressure-set position,<br>
pressurized fluid from passage 143 is communicated to passage 146, while preventing the<br>
pressurized fluid in passage 143 from reaching passage 174, causing the monitored<br>
pressures at the switch SW3 associated with trim valve 122 to be at exhaust pressure, that<br>
at the switch SW4 associated with trim valve 124 to be at control pressure, and that at the<br>
lower switch SW8 associated with the dog clutch actuator valve 144 to be at control<br>
pressure. With the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in a neutral position, logic valve Z is in<br>
a pressure-set position. With the above-stated valve configuration, clutches C4, TCC and<br>
C7 will engage while clutches C1. C2 and C6 will exhaust. To effect engagement of<br>
clutch C4, pressurized fluid from passage 150 crosses the pressure-set trim valve 120 to<br>
outlet passage 162 and across pressure-set logic valve X into communication with clutch<br>
C4. To effect the engagement of clutch TCC, trim valve 126 is pressure-set by<br>
energizing solenoid valve PCS4. To effect engagement of clutch C7, pressurized fluid<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
20<br>
from passage 154 crosses pressure-set trim valve 130 to communicate with passage 173<br>
and then crosses pressure-set logic valve Z into communication with clutch C7. The<br>
pressure-set position of logic valve X allows pressurized fluid to pass from passage 143<br>
across the pressure-set logic valve X to passage 146, shifting the dog clutch actuator<br>
valve 144 to a neutral state or position, allowing control pressure fluid to contact the<br>
lower switch SW8 associated with the dog clutch actuator valve 144. Furthermore, the<br>
pressure-set position of logic valve Y allows some of the pressurized fluid crossing logic<br>
valve X to be routed to passage 148.<br>
[0051]	When operating in the ninth forward speed ratio range (9th), trim valves<br>
122, 126 and 130 are pressure-set. Solenoid valves PCS2 and PCS4 are energized to<br>
pressure-set trim valves 122 and 126. but solenoid valve PCS7 is not energized, as it is<br>
normally-open type solenoid valve. Solenoid valves SS1 and SS2 are also energized so<br>
that logic valves X and Y, respectively, are in pressure-set positions and the dog clutch<br>
actuator valve 144 is in a neutral position. With the above-stated valve configuration,<br>
clutches TCC and C7 will engage (as described above with respect to the eighth forward<br>
speed ratio range (8th)) as well as clutch C5, while clutches C1, C2 and C6 will exhaust.<br>
To effect engagement of clutch C5, pressurized fluid from forward 150 communicates<br>
with outlet passage 152 across the pressure-set trim valve 122 and then with clutch C5<br>
through the pressure-set logic valve Y. Because the control system 100 is designed with<br>
the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in the neutral position in the higher speed ratio ranges<br>
(the alternate seventh forward speed ratio ranges (7th") and (7th'')), as well as in the<br>
eighth (8th) and ninth (9th) forward speed ratio ranges, spin losses are reduced in the<br>
transmission 10 of Figure 1.<br>
Multiplexing of Trim Systems<br>
[0052]	As is evident from the Figures and from the above description, the first<br>
trim system, which includes solenoid valve PCS1 and trim valve 120, is multiplexed to<br>
control engagement of clutches C1 and clutch C4. Shifting of the logic valve X between<br>
a spring-set position and a pressure-set position determines which of the clutches C1 and<br>
C4 will be engaged via the pressurized fluid fed through the pressure-set trim valve 120<br>
and the logic valve X.<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
21<br>
[0053]	Furthermore the second trim system, which includes solenoid valve PCS2<br>
and trim valve 124 is multiplexed to control engagement of clutches C2 and C5. Shifting<br>
of logic valve Y between a spring-set position and a pressure-set position determines<br>
which of the clutches C2 and C5 will be engaged via pressurized fluid fed through the<br>
pressure-set trim valve 124 to the logic valve Y.<br>
[0054|	Still further, the third trim system, which includes the solenoid valve<br>
PCS3 and the trim valve 124 is multiplexed to control engagement of the C3 and C7<br>
clutches, at least in speed ratio ranges (R2), (R1), startup, neutral, and first forward speed<br>
ratio range (1st). In speed ratio ranges above the first forward speed ratio range (1st),<br>
engagement of clutch C7 is controlled by the sixth trim system, which includes solenoid<br>
valve PCS7 and trim valve 130. Shifting of logic valve Z between a spring-set position<br>
and a pressure-set position determines which of the clutches C3 and C7 will be engaged<br>
via pressurized fluid fed through the pressure-set trim valve 124 to the logic valve Z. The<br>
shifting of logic valve Z is controlled by the position of the dog clutch actuator valve 144,<br>
which in turn is controlled by the positions of the logic valves X and Y and by solenoid<br>
valve SS3.<br>
Double Transition Shifts and Skip Shifts<br>
[0055]	As is evident from Figure 3 and from the above description, a shift from<br>
the fourth forward speed ratio range (4th) to the fifth forward speed ratio range (5th)<br>
involves a four clutch, double transition shift. That is, clutches C5 and C6 are disengaged<br>
while clutches C1 and C7 are engaged. Thus, even with the multiplexing of the trim<br>
systems, this four clutch shift is achieved by the control system 100. A four clutch,<br>
double transition shift is also realized. As is evident from Figure 3. numerous other shifts<br>
also involve double transition shifts (i.e.. a shift that requires that more than one clutch be<br>
engaged or disengaged). The system 100 is also able to accomplish many skip shifts,<br>
including a shift from the first reverse speed ratio range (R1) to the first forward speed<br>
ratio range (1st); a shift from the second reverse speed ratio range (R2) to the first<br>
forward speed ratio range (1st); a shift from the first alternative forward speed ratio range<br>
(1st') to the third forward speed ratio range (3rd); a shift from the third forward speed<br>
ratio range (3rd) to the fifth forward speed ratio range (5th); a shift from the fifth forward<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
22<br>
speed ratio range (5th) to the seventh forward speed ratio range (7th); and a shift from the<br>
second alternative seventh forward speed ratio range (7th") to the ninth forward speed<br>
ratio range (9th).<br>
Logic Valves Used to Control Power Off/ Drive-Home Modes<br>
[0056]	The hydraulic control system 100 is configured to provide a functional<br>
"drive-home" system in the event of an interruption or failure in electrical power, which<br>
would prevent selective energizing of the solenoid valves. The hydraulic control system<br>
100 is designed to default to two different speed ratio ranges (referred to as failure<br>
modes), i.e., there are two different failure modes, depending on which speed ratio range<br>
the system 100 is providing when failure occurs. Specifically, if power failure occurs<br>
while the transmission 10 is operating in any of the first reverse speed ratio range (R1).<br>
the second reverse speed ratio range (R2) or is in neutral (N), the hydraulic control<br>
system 100 will automatically operate in a neutral state (i.e., an operating condition<br>
which will not allow driving the vehicle in either forward or reverse). This "failure" to a<br>
neutral state occurs for several reasons. First, in each of the first reverse speed ratio<br>
range (R1), the second reverse speed ratio range (R2) or the neutral (N) speed ratio range,<br>
the dog clutch actuator valve 144 is in a reverse position during normal operation (i.e.,<br>
when electrical energy is available). Additionally, because solenoid valve PCS1 is a<br>
normally open-type valve, trim valve 120 will be pressure-set in the absence of an<br>
energizing control signal. This causes the pressurized fluid in passage 150 to<br>
communicate with outlet passage 162 and be directed through the logic valve X (which<br>
allows flow to clutch C1 when in the spring-set position) to clutch C1. Because the trim<br>
valves 122, 124, 128 and 130 and the logic valves Z and Y are in spring-set positions<br>
during a power failure with the dog clutch actuator valve 144 in a reverse position, trim<br>
valve 128 does not allow pressurized fluid flow to clutch C6, logic valve Z does not<br>
allow pressurized fluid flow to clutches C3 and C7, and logic valve Y does not allow<br>
pressurized fluid flow to clutches C2 and C5. With only clutch C1 engaged, the<br>
transmission 10 of Figure 1 operates in a neutral state.<br>
[0057]	If power failure occurs when the transmission 10 is in any of the speed<br>
ratio ranges (1st), (1st'), (2nd), (3rd), (3rd'), 4th), (5th), (5th'), (6th), (7th), and (7th').<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
23<br>
referred to herein as "low" speed ratio ranges, the hydraulic control system 100 will<br>
automatically operate in the fifth forward speed ratio range (5th). This "failure" to the<br>
fifth forward speed ratio range (5th) occurs for several reasons. First, in each of the first<br>
forward speed ratio range (1st) through the seventh alternate forward speed ratio range<br>
(7th'). the dog clutch actuator valve 144 is in a forward position during normal operation<br>
(i.e., when electrical energy is available), causing logic valve Z to be pressure-set.<br>
Additionally, because solenoid valve PCS1 is a normally open-type valve, trim valve 120<br>
will be pressure-set in the absence of an energizing control signal. This causes the<br>
pressurized fluid in passage 150 to communicate with outlet passage 162 and be directed<br>
through the logic valve X (which allows flow to clutch C1 when in the spring-set<br>
position) to clutch C1. Solenoid valve PCS7 is also a normally-open type solenoid valve,<br>
so trim valve 130 will be pressure-set in the absence of an electrical control signal and<br>
will provide pressurized fluid from passage 154 to outlet passage 173 and through the<br>
pressure-set logic valve Z to clutch C7. Because the trim valves 120, 124, and 128 and<br>
the logic valves X and Y are in spring-set positions during a power failure with the dog<br>
clutch actuator valve 144 in a reverse position, trim valve 128 does not allow pressurized<br>
fluid flow to clutch C6. and logic valve Y does not allow pressurized fluid flow to<br>
clutches C2 and C5. With only clutches C1 and C75 engaged, the transmission 10 of<br>
Figure 1 operates in the fifth forward speed ratio range, except without engagement of the<br>
torque-converter clutch TCC.<br>
[0058]	If power failure occurs when the transmission 10 is in any of the speed<br>
ratio ranges (7th"), (7th''), (8th), or (9th), referred to herein as "high" speed ratio<br>
ranges, the hydraulic control system 100 will automatically operate in the eighth forward<br>
speed ratio range (8th). This "failure" to the eighth forward speed ratio range (8th)<br>
occurs for several reasons. First, in each of the alternate seventh forward speed ratio<br>
range (7th") through the ninth forward speed ratio range (9th). the dog clutch actuator<br>
valve 144 is in a neutral position during normal operation (i.e., when electrical energy is<br>
available), causing logic valve Z to be pressure-set. When power is interrupted, the<br>
neutral position of the dog clutch actuator valve 144 causes logic valves X and Y to<br>
remain pressure-set (i.e., the dog clutch actuator valve 144 latches the logic valves X and<br><br>
GP-308317-PTA-DLT<br>
24<br>
Y), as they are in each of the alternate seventh forward speed ratio range (7th") through<br>
the ninth forward speed ratio range (9th), even though solenoid valves SS1 and SS2 are<br>
not energized, because there are no exhaust routes open for the pressurized fluid in<br>
passages 146 and 148 acting on logic valves X and Y, and for the controlled pressure<br>
fluid acting on logic valves X and Y through the spring-set logic valve W which<br>
communicates passage 153 with passage 155. During normal operation, the solenoid SS3<br>
can be energized to place logic valve W in a pressure-set position (either in steady state,<br>
or temporarily) to prevent fluid communication between passages 153 and 155, thus<br>
preventing the dog clutch actuator 144 from having a latching effect on logic valves X<br>
and Y.<br>
[0059]	The logic valves X and Y also function to "lock out" clutch C6 during<br>
forward ratio ranges (7th"), (7th''). (8th) and (9th). This occurs because, in these<br>
operating ranges, the logic valves X and Y are both in pressure-set positions. Thus, logic<br>
valve X and logic valve Y prevent pressurized fluid from passage 118 from reaching<br>
passage 158, while logic valve Y allows control pressure fluid from passage 117 to<br>
passage 179, preventing trim valve 128 from being placed in a pressure-set position by<br>
solenoid valve PCS6.<br>
