Field of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a beverage system for providing a coffee beverage comprising a stable coffee concentrate  The beverage system may be reconstituted to provide an aromatized coffee beverage. The invention also relates to a method for providing the beverage system. The invention especially relates to a beverage system for providing a coffee beverage having foam on its surface known as Italian Latte coffee such as cappuccino and macchiato coffee. Further the invention relates to a method for preparing Italian Latte coffee.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Soluble coffee beverage products of the instant "cappuccino" type are well known and are commercially available. Usually these products are a dry mix of a soluble coffee powder and a soluble whitener owder. The soluble whitener powder contains pockets of gas, which, upon dissolution of the powder, produce foam. Therefore, upon the addition of water (usually hot), a whitened coffee beverage, which has a foam on its upper surface, is formed; the beverage resembling, to a greater or lesser extent, traditional Italian cappuccino.<br>
Coffee products in the form of soluble beverage powders may be of extremely high quality; to the point were they provide a beverage very similar to freshly brewed beverages. Despite this, they are still perceived as being inferior to freshly brewed coffee. Also, the fact that soluble beverage powders are in powder form creates problems in many food service applications where the product is dispensed from a machine. In particular, problems such as mechanical degradation of the powder, bridging, and blocking occur. Other problems which are known to occur in obtaining an acceptable beverage with little or no lumps upon dissolution.<br>
Ready-to-drink liquid coffee beverages are very popular in Asian markets. The beverages are made up of soluble coffee solids, stabilizers, water and, usually, sugar. For whitened beverages, a creamer or whitener may be included. Ordinarily, these beverages have a soluble coffee solids concentration of about 1% by weight. These beverages are very<br><br>
often consumed cold and, in general, have organoleptic properties which differ food freshly brewed coffee. Therefore they do not, and in fact are not intended to, provide a substitute to freshly brewed coffee. The ready-to-drink liquid coffee is therefore little suitable for making cappuccino and macchiato type coffee.<br>
There have also been attempts to provide convenient coffee products in concentrate form. In theory, a coffee concentrate offers the advantages of being perceived to have better quality than soluble beverage powders, and being simple to apply in food service applications. Unfortunately, coffee concentrates are mostly unstable and this has severely limited their application. One problem appears to be the increase of acidity over time which negatively influences the quality of the beverage reconstituted from the coffee concentrate. Also, curdling of later added whitener or creamer components may occur.<br>
Attempts have been made to avoid or reduce the acidity increase by adding caustic base to the concentrate. For example, European patent application 0861595 describes treating a coffee concentrate with alkali to convert acid precursors to their acid salts, and then neutralizing the treated concentrate with acid to bring the pH to about 4.7 to 5.3. This process is described to convert the acid precursors to stable salts and hence prevent the formation of acid during storage.<br>
Another possible method of avoiding or reducing the acidity increase in aromatized coffee concentrates is to increase concentration to above about 55%. This is described in European patent application 0893065.<br>
These processes provide some improvement of the storage stability of the coffee     concentrates: However, quality deterioration still occurs. Therefore there is still a need for a stable coffee concentrate.<br>
Further, to provide a beverage of the cappuccino and macchiato type coffee there is a need for an alternative to the above beverage powders.<br><br>
Furthermore, there is a need for an alternative beverage system for providing cappuccino and macchiato type coffee which is based on a coffee concentrate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a beverage system for providing a coffee beverage,<br>
the beverage system comprising:<br>
a coffee base concentrate having a soluble coffee solids concentration of at least 10% by weight and from which coffee aroma has been removed; and an aromatized soluble creamer powder separate from the coffee base concentrate; the coffee base concentrate and soluble creamer powder being combinable upon reconstitution for providing a coffee beverage.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that separation of the.coffee base cpncenfr^^        coffee aroma, and incorporating the coffee aroma in the solublecoffee creamer significantly improves stability ofthejcracenfrate. The soluble coffee creamer incorporating the coffee aroma has a good aroma potential, which has been found to provide a more complete aroma profile of the final product. In particular, it has been found that a beverage system with a soluble coffee creamer incorporating aqueous aroma components provides a product, which assimilates a freshly brewed roast and groimd coffee combined with a milk beverage.<br>
It has also surprisingly been found that with an aromatized soluble creamer powder containing gas for foaming the beverage system may provide a coffee beverage which has a closely resembled cappuccino or macchiato type coffee. The coffee base concentrate and aromatized soluble coffee creamer may be each stored in a separate container or may be stored in separate compartments of a single container. The containers are preferably dispenser containers. For the reconstitution of the beverage the aromatized soluble creamer is preferably mixed with a hot liquid to provide a foamed aromatized milk beverage, the concentrate is combined with the aromatized milk beverage to provide<br><br>
a coffee beverage of cappuccino or macchiato style coffee. This provides a beverage that has an aroma profile, which assimilates that of cappuccino or macchiato style coffee.<br>
In another aspect, this invention provides a beverage system for providing a coffee beverage, the beverage system comprising a container including:<br>
a first storage compartment containing a coffee base concentrate having a soluble coffee solids concentration of at least 10% by weight and from which coffee aroma has been removed, and a second storage compartment containing aromatized soluble coffee creamer powder.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention provides a method for providing a coffee beverage. The method comprising<br>
providing a separately stored coffee base concentrate having a solid concentration of about 15% to about 45% by weight from which coffee aroma has been removed, providing a separately stored aromatized soluble coffee creamer powder, reconstituting the aromatized soluble coffee creamer by combining it with a liquid, and combining the reconstituted coffee creamer with the coffee base concentrate. A beverage system for providing a coffee beverage, substantially as herein described with reference to the foregoing examples and the accompanying drawing..<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the invention are now described by way of example only. This invention<br>
is based upon the finding that the separate storage of concentrated soluble coffe£&amp;olids_<br>
and coffee £ffoma sigQilicantly imprpyes the<br>
solids, and that the incorporation of the coffee aroma in the soluble coffee creamer may<br>
be done in a manner so that a stable soluble coffee creamer may be obtained which<br>
provides a complementary aroma. Therefore, by separately storing the coffee base<br>
concentrate and aromatized soluble coffee creamer and recombining them upon<br><br>
reconstitution, a coffee beverage of good quality may be provided.<br>
The coffee base concentrate may be obtained using any suitable procedure since the exact procedure used is not critical. Usually, the coffee base concentrate is prepared by concentrating a coffee extract obtained from a coffee extraction process to the desired coffee concentration. The coffee extract may be produced in the usual manner by subjecting roasted coffee beans to extraction. Any suitable extraction procedure may be used because the choice and design of the extraction procedure is a matter of preference and has no critical impact on the invention. Suitable extraction procedures are described in European patent applications 0826308 and 0916267; the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. Similarly, any suitable concentration procedure may be used because the choice and design of the concentration procedure is a matter of preference and has no critical impact on the invention. Of course, the coffee base concentrate may also be prepared by dissolving soluble coffee powder in water to the desired concentration.<br>
The concentration of the coffee base concentrate is at least about 10% by weight; for example about 15% to about 45 by weight.<br>
The coffee base concentrate may be treated to account for or reduce the formation of acids during storage. To account for the formation of acids during storage, the pH of the coffee base concentrate may be raised to a pH in the range from about 5.5 to about 6.5. The pH will still fall during storage but the coffee base concentrate will not become too acidic during acceptable shelf life times. The pH may be raised using any suitable procedure. For example, an alkali may be added to the coffee base concenfrate to raise the pH. Suitable alkalis include sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate. Alternatively, the pH may be raised using ion exchange. This offers the advantage that no additives are added to the coffee base concentrate.<br>
The formation of acids may be reduced or prevented by inducing hydrolysis of the acid<br><br>
precursors m tne cottee base concentrate. 1 his may be done by raising the pH to cause the acid precursors to form stable salts and then reducing the pH of the concentrate. This may be done by adding alkali as described in European patent application 0861596 or by using ion exchange. Usually the pH will be raised to above about 9. The pH may again be lowered to a normal coffee pH range using suitable acids or ion exchange. Alternatively, the acid precursors may be thermally hydrolyzed or enzymatically hydrolyzed; for example by using an esterase or hydrolase.<br>
The formation of acids may also be reduced or prevented by removing acid precursors from the coffee base concentrate using membrane fractionation. Suitable membranes are commercially available.<br>
It is also possible to add an alkali to the base coffee concentrate at the time of reconstitution of the beverage. This may be done by dispensing an alkali along with the base coffee concentrate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the coffee base concentrate should be substantially free of coffee aroma. Merely processing the roasted coffee beans to a coffee base concentrate as described above will result in the loss of substantially all coffee aroma. Therefore, it is preferred to specifically strip off and then collect the coffee aroma during processing. In this way, the coffee aroma is not lost. Processes for stripping off and collecting the coffee aroma are well known. Usually coffee aroma is stripped off at one or more stages; for example:-<br>
using an inert gas or steam during, or immediately after, grinding of the coffee beans, and using steam to strip coffee aroma from the coffee extract during exfraction.<br>
Alternatively, the fresh coffee grounds may be slurried in water or coffee extract and the coffee aroma stripped from the slurry. A suitable procedure is described in International patent application PCT/EP99/00747; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The coffee aroma may be captured using any suitable procedure. Ordinarily, the coffee aroma is captured by condensing from the carrier gas it in one or more condensers. Preferably more than one condenser is used; each succeeding condenser being operated at a lower temperature than the previous condenser. If necessary or desired, one of the condensers may be a cryogenic aroma condenser. A suitable cryogenic aroma condenser is described in US patent 5,182,926; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. The captured coffee aroma may, if desired, be concentrated using a suitable technique such as partial condensation or rectification. The captured coffee aroma may be combined with a suitable carrier substrate such as coffee oil or emulsion containing coffee oil or other fats . Aqueous coffee aroma components and organic coffee aroma components are then separated. A suitable method for separating aqueous coffee aroma components from organic coffee aroma components are described in co-pending European patent application 99200241.0; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
The processes for the production of the coffee extract and capture of the coffee aroma may be carried out under oxygen reduced or oxygen free conditions if desired. This may be accomplished as is known in the art; for example by carrying out the processes imder a blanket of inert gas. Further, deoxygenated water may be used whenever water is necessary in the process.<br>
The coffee aroma is preferably stored under oxygen reduced or oxygen free conditions and frozen. Similarly, the coffee base concentrate may be stored under oxygen reduced or oxygen free conditions. Further, if desired, oxygen scavengers may be added to the coffee aroma and/or coffee base concentrate. Suitable oxygen scavengers are described in European patent application 99200185.9; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
To the beverage system according to the invention it has been found that it is particular advantageous to prepare the "milk" part of the beverage on the basis of a soluble creamer powder.<br><br>
Soluble creamer powders are well known and are widely used; particularly as coffee or tea creamers. Conventionally creamer powders contain protein, fats and sweeteners but other ingredients such as emulsifiers, stabilisers and buffers may also be included. Further, the creamers come in various forms such as milk-based creamer powders, non-dairy creamer powders, and gassed creamer powders. These creamer powders are typically produced by subjecting a solution containing their components to spray drying.<br>
For the present beverage system it has been found to be advantageous to provide an aromatized creamer powder. A particular suitable soluble creamer may comprising a matrix including proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and an aroma system, the aroma system comprising aqueous coffee aroma components and a stabilising amount of soluble coffee solids.<br>
The creamer powder preferably contains about 0.05% to about 1.0% by weight of aqueous coffee aroma components; more preferably about 0.1% to about 0.3% by weight. The creamer powder may contain about 0.01% to about 0.1% by weight of soluble coffee solids in the aroma system. It has been found that a creamer of this type is particular suitable for the beverage system of the invention as it provides together with the coffee concentrate an aroma and flavour profile which assimilates that of a fi-eshly brewed cappuccino or macchiato.<br>
Preferably the aqueous coffee aroma components include highly volatile aqueous aroma components which condense at temperatures less than about 0 DEG C.<br>
The creamer powder may be gassed for foaming foam upon reconstitution. This is desirable if the beverage system of the invention is to be used for preparing a cappuccino or macchiato type coffee. Further, the creamer powder may further comprise an organic aroma substrate containing organic coffee aroma components.<br>
The soluble creamer powder may be prepared as follows: The coffee aroma components<br><br>
are cryogemcally collected as describe above. Aqueous coffee aroma components and organic coffee aroma components are then separated. Soluble coffee solids are added to the aqueous coffee aroma components to provide an aqueous aroma solution. The aqueous aroma solution is then added to a creamer concentrate, which contains proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to provide an aromatized solution. Finally the aromatized solution is dried to powder. More details of the process are given below:<br>
The aqueous coffee aroma components are natural aroma components, which may be collected during the preparation of soluble coffee powder. This may be done by standard procedures for collecting coffee aroma components or by suitably modifying the standard procedures. Preferably, the natural aroma components include highly volatile aroma components. Highly volatile aroma components are those which condense at a temperature below about 0 DEG C.<br>
To collect highly volatile aroma components, the standard procedures usually entail flushing volatile aroma components from the coffee during processing using an inert carrier gas such as nitrogen. The aroma-laden carrier gas is then chilled to temperatures lower than about -40 DEG C, and sometimes as low as about -195 DEG C, to cause the aroma components to condense. The condensed aroma components are then collected. The condensed aroma components are then usually absorbed into an aroma substrate; usually an oil. Alternatively, the aromas may be absorbed into the aroma substrate during condensation. Suitable standard procedures are disclosed in, for example, US patents 3823241, 5030473, and 5222364 (the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference).<br>
However, in the standard procedures described above, the aromatized aroma substrate obtained contains both aqueous and organic aroma components. In general, the aqueous components are then removed and often discarded because they are vmstable and cause instability problems. This leaves the aroma substrate containing substantially only organic aroma components. However, instead of discarding these aqueous components, these components are collected in the form of an aqueous aroma solution.<br><br>
The aqueous aroma solution is then added to the other components making up the creamer powder prior to drying of the components. Sufficient aqueous aroma solution may be added such that the aqueous coffee aroma components comprise about 0.05% to about 0.5% by weight of the creamer powder; for example about 0.1% to about 0.3%. The soluble coffee solids comprise about 0.01% to about 0.1% by weight of the creamer powder.<br>
The remaining components of the creamer powder may be standard. Ordinarily, the remaining components include proteins, fats, and carbohydrates forming sweeteners or bulking agents. The amounts of these components may vary depending upon the desired characteristics of the creamer powder.<br>
For example, the creamer powder may contain about 15% to about 60% by weight of non-fat milk solids; about 5% to about 20% by weight of sweet whey; about 5% to about 30% by weight of a suitable edible oil or fat such as coconut oil, and about 20% to about 70% by weight a suitable food grade sweetener. Suitable sweeteners include carbohydrates such as glucose syrup, com syrup, sucrose, dextrose, fructose, maltodextrin, and the like, and mixtures of these carbohydrates. Glucose syrup is particularly suitable, especially syrups having a DE in the range of about 35 to about 42. An example of such a creamer powder is described in European patent application No 0885566; the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
For food service applications, the coffee base concentrate and the aromatized soluble coffee creamer may be separately stored in suitable dispenser containers. The containers may be separate for the coffee base concentrate and the soluble coffee creamer or a single container having separate storage chambers may be used. The containers are suitably pouches made from barrier films, which are able to keep water vapor, oxygen and light transmission to a minimum. Suitable barrier films are commercially available; for example polyester/aluminum/polyethylene barrier films.<br><br>
For retail applications, the coffee base concentrate and the aromatized soluble coffee creamer are preferably packaged in suitable containers which have separate storage chambers for the coffee base concentrate and the soluble coffee creamer. Suitable containers include multi-compartment stick packs; sachets; carton-based, tetrahedron packs; UnifiU packs; squeezeable plastic bottles; stand up pouches; plastic or aluminium cups; etc.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of coffee base concentrate<br>
The coffee concentrate is prepared by concentrating coffee extracts obtained from a coffee extraction process. The extracts are evaporated to a concentration of about 20% dry matter. The aroma is stripped off and collected during the process to avoid that aroma is lost. The aroma is stripped off by using an inert gas during the grinding of the coffee beans, and using steam to strip coffee aroma from the extract during the exfraction. The aroma is captured by condensing it from the carrier gas in one or more condensers. Aqueous coffee aroma components and organic cryogenically collected coffee aroma components are then separated. The aqueous aroma is incorporated into the soluble creamer powder as describe below.<br>
The coffee concentrates are treated to reduce the formation of acids during storage. The coffee concentrates are enzyme treated and the pH is adjusted decrease acidifying during storage. The concentrates are filled into vapor tight 15 ml capsules and sterilised at about f-values of more than 5.<br>
Different coffee varieties are used. For example capsules are prepared with pure Arabica coffee base concentrate.<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of aromatized soluble creamer powder<br>
Aromatized soluble creamer powders are prepared by adding the aqueous aroma to a creamer concentrate, which contains proteins, fats, and carbohydrates to provide an<br><br>
aromatized solution. The aromatized solution is spray dried to powder.<br>
Soluble creamer powders are prepared from 20-60% non-fat milk solids, 0-40% carbohydrates, 10-30% milk fat or vegetable oil, 0-15% sugar up to 1% coffee aroma contained as an emulsion or aqueous solution in a dried wet mix.<br>
Further soluble creamer powders are prepared wherein the aqueous coffee aroma components and solid coffee solids are mixed together and the mixture is added to the other ingredients before these are spray dried.<br>
To obtain a foaming soluble creamer powder nitrogen is injected before spray drying at about 0,1-0,3 liters/kg of creamer concentrate. This gives a tapped specific gravity of the powder 150-250g/l. Tapped specific gravity is referring to the gravity of the powder when compressed by vibrating the powder with 100 pushes of 10mm.<br>
Example 3 - Coffee base concentrate shelf life<br>
Plastic film capsules are filled with about 10ml of coffee base concentrate with a soluble coffee solids concentration of 10, 20, 30,40% by weight prepared according with example 1. The capsules are closed with aluminium film and UHT-treated at 138 DEG C for 5 sec. The cup quality is checked every month in a Cappuccino preparation over 12 months and found good without significant deterioration.<br>
Coffee base concentrates containing volatile aqueous aroma were UHT treated and filled into Tetrapack. The gelification is checked by after 12 months storage time. No gelification was found. Parallel samples without added aroma gelified in the same time.<br>
Coffee base concentrates with a soluble coffee solids concentration of 10% by weight is given an enzyme treatment by hydrolase at about 45 DEG C for 1 hour. The enzymes are inactivated afterwards. 40% carbohydrates are added = BREEZE. By means of sucrose fatty esters addition provides a mild pasteurization. The coffee base concentrate is filled<br><br>
into plastic film cups and closed with aluminium film. The cup quality is checked after 6 months shelf life and found to be good and the product safe.<br>
Example 4 - Aromatized soluble creamer powder shelf life<br>
Aromatized soluble creamer powder according to example 2 is packed in sachets and stored. The stability is checked every month. It is found that the creamer powder is stable for at least 6 months. Further it is found that soluble creamers with added soluble coffee solids are stable for at least 18 months.<br>
Foaming aromatized soluble creamer powder according to example 2 are filled into aluminimn film sachets, gassed and stored at ambient conditions. After 12 months the creamer powder was found to be stable and as good as a fi-esh sample.<br>
Example 5 - Preparation of beverages<br>
A coffee base concentrate having a soluble coffee solids concentration of 20% by weight prepared according to example 1; and an aromatized soluble creamer powder prepared according to example 2 are combined.<br>
To prepare a "latte macchiato" 12g of the 20% soluble solid concentration coffee base concentrate and 13g of the aromatized creamer are provided. The reconstitution is done by mixing the 13g aromatized creamer with 150ml hot water in a glass to provide a "milk" beverage with foam on the surface. The 12g coffee base concentrate is added on top of the milk foam. The result is a coffee beverage, which closely assimilate an Italian "latte macchiato".<br>
To prepare a Cappuccino 12g of the 20% soluble solid concentration coffee base concentrate and 8g of the aromatized creamer are provided. The reconstitution is done by mixing the 8g aromatized creamer with 120ml hot water in a glass to provide a "milk" beverage with foam on the surface. The coffee base concentrate is poured into a cup and the foamed milk beverage is poured onto the base concentrate. The coffee base<br><br>
concentrate may also be purred onto the milk beverage however this leaves black dots on the beverage foam.<br>
The quality of fresh prepared Cappuccinos and latte macchiatos out of high pressure Espresso machines with milk foaming device was compared with the coffee beverage made according to the invention. Without aroma addition in the soluble coffee creamer powder the coffee impression in the preparation was more flat and more milky than the Espresso machine products with added aroma in the soluble coffee creamer powder the cup was more balanced the cooked notes of the liquid coffee and the creamer powder were masked, and beverage was found to closely resemble the freshly prepared cups. In some cases the tasting panel had difficulties distinguishing the fresh prepared beverage from those made according to the invention.<br><br><br>
