				<td>The present invention relates to a pesticide concentrate and a composition comprising the same.<br>
The present invention relates to pesticidal concentrates comprising at least one pesticide and an ionic nitrate salt. The present invention also relates to pesticide compositions prepared from these concentrates and to the use of said compositions for controlling pests.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aqueous-based pesticide formulations are increasingly popular due to their improved profile for mammalian toxiciry and ecological effects, as well as reduced costs, compared to formulations utilizing an organic solvent as diluent. Unfortunately, introduction of even a small amount of water into a pesticide composition increases the potential for corrosion of metal surfaces of equipment used in manufacturing, storage, transportation or packaging of the product. These corrosion characteristics may result in increased equipment maintenance costs or equipment failure.<br>
The use of additives to reduce corrosion in pesticide compositions is known in the art. However, the additives and applications disclosed are very specific in nature. For example, US 2,788,307 discloses use of Na2S2O3 to reduce tinplate corrosion in contact with solvent-based lindane or DDT formulations. US 2,630,380 discloses aryloxy polyethylene glycol compounds as inhibitors of corrosion in formulations based on 2,4-dinitro-6-alkylphenols. Use of bis(m-methylphenyl)phosphate to prevent iron corrosion in the presence of S-methyl-N-[(methylcarbamoyl)oxy]thioacetimidate is disclosed in JP 56034562. JP 2000034201 discloses compositions containing silica for preventing corrosion of containers by aqueous aerosols of pyrethroid insecticides. US 5,061,698 discloses compositions based on boric acid with utility as corrosion inhibitors. US 5,032,318 discloses C13-C14 alkylamine salts of N-acylsarcosine as corrosion inhibitors for aerosols in tinplated steel cans. US 5,118,444 discloses use of a specific class of amine oxides to reduce corrosion in aqueous pesticide compositions. The potential for corrosion in aqueous-based formulations is increased when the formulation is acidic in pH. There are a number of important pesticide active ingredients that contain an acid moiety in their structure and an aqueous-based formulation of these products may have an acidic pH. There may be other reasons for the pH of a pesticide formulation to be maintained at an acidic level, such as improved chemical stability for the<br><br>
active ingredient or improved physical stability for the product on storage. The presence of dissolved salts such as ionic chlorides or pesticide active ingredients present in salt or metal complex forrn may also accelerate corrosion of metal surfaces.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that certain nitrate salt additives significantly reduce the corrosion properties of aqueous-based pesticide formulations, even with acidic pH levels and in the presence of a salt.<br>
The additives of the present invention may be incorporated in the aqueous pesticide composition dunng the iniţial formulation process or may be added at any subsequent stage of storage, transportation or packaging to reduce corrosion. The additives of the present invention nave the further advantage of being readily available at relatively low cost.<br>
The use of nitrate salts, especially ammonium nitrate, as nitrogen fertilizer is long established in the agricultural industry, and the use of ammonium nitrate or other nitrogen fertilizer solutions as a tank mix carrier liquid for application of herbicides is frequently included on the labei instructions for the product. However, the use of nitrate salts in nitrogen fertili/er carrier liquids involves large quantities per acre.<br>
There are also reports in the patent literature (US 5,658,855, US 2003104947, US 2003125211 and WO 02/19823) for use of compositions containing ammonium nitrate as application spray addilivcs for increased herbicide activity.  However, the pesticide compositions Ihat incorporate these additives are very dilute spray mixtures that are typically prepared just prior to use by rnixing components directly in the spray equipment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THH INVHNTION<br>
There are now provided certain corrosion inhibitor additives for aqueous-containing pesticide formulations that will be effective under potentially severe corrosion conditions. l'he compositions of the present invention have particular utility when the pil of the composition is less than or equal to 6 and/or wherein a salt or metal complex is present, either us the pesticide active ingredient or as a formulation auxiliary.<br>

The inveotion also relates to pesticide compositions prepared from these concentrates and to the use oi" said compositions for controlling pests.<br>

The composition according to the invention is suitable especially for controlling pests m crops of useful planls, such as cereals, râpe, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantation crops, rice, maize and soybeans. "Crops" are to be understood also to include those crops that have been made tolerant to pests and pesticides, including herbicides or classes of herbicides, as a result of convenţional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. The components used in the composition of the invention can be applied in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art, at various concentrations. The rate at which the pesticidal compositions are applied will depend upon the particular type of pest to be controlled, the degree of control required, and the timing and method of application.<br>
Crop a rea s are areas of land on which the cultivated plants are already growing or in vvhich the seeds of those cultivated plants have been sown, and also areas of land on which it is intended to grow those cultivated plants.<br>
O the r active mgredients such as co-herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, acancides and nematicides may be present in the emulsifiable concentrate or may be added as a tank-mix partner with the emulsifiable concentrate.<br>
Suitable lliixotropic additives are compounds that impari a pseudoplastic Ilovv behavior to the lormulation, i.e. a high viscosity in the resting state and a low viscosity in the<br>
agitated state. Examples of suitable compounds include polysaccharides such as xanthan gum, Kelzan® by Kelco or Rhodopol® 23 by Rhone Poulenc.<br>

EXAMPLE l<br>
Preparation of Mesotrione Copper Suspension Concentrate Test Material<br>
The test material is prepared according to the following composition:<br>
Mesotrione	35.0 %<br>
Soprophor BSU surfactant (tristyrylphenol 16 mole ethoxylate)	3.5%<br>
Acetic acid (glacial)	6.2%<br>
Copper hydro.xide (100%)	5.1 %<br>
Silicone antifoaming agent<br>
Xanthaii gum tln.xitropic agenl<br>
Water	50.0 %<br>
Mix l ho watcr, acetic acid and copper hydroxide.  Add the mesotrione follovvcd by the surfactant, antifoam and thixotropic agent and mix until uniform.  Mill until the partide size of the suspended solid is below 10 microns. The resulting mixture has a pH around 3.0.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Testing of Corrosion Inhibitor Additive Candidates<br>
'fhe following procedure was used to test a series of 17 candidate corrosion inhibitor matcrials along svith a control sample containing no inhibitor.<br>
Weigh into a 16 ounce sample jar and mix thoroughly:l  325 grams of 11 ie mesotrione copper .suspension concentrate f rom lixample l, 2)   grams of xanthan gum thixitropic agenl/vvater mixture (2%concentration), and<br>
3)   10 grams of a candidate corrosion inhibitor material.<br>
Immerse two weighed 304 stainless steel corrosion coupons (one with weld and another without weld) in the liquid, close and seal the lid, and place the jar in an oven maintained at 50 °C. After four weeks of storage at 50 °C, remove the eoupon from the liquid, wash with a firm toothbrush in soap and water, rinse with acetone and dry. Weigh the eoupon and visually inspect to determine the severity of corrosion.<br>
(Table Removed) Composition within the scope of the present invention<br>
The control sample (#1) that hâd no corrosion inhibitor present showed significant corrosion of the 304 stainless steel eoupon as indicated by the weight loss of both the welded and Hat coupons and visual inspection that showed heavy rust present. Many of the candidate inhibitors aclualiy resulted in increased corrosion while several others showed moderate corrosion inhibition.   l vvo samples f//6, #7) showed weight increases, probably duc to plating<br>
of copper on the coupons. The ammonium nitrate sample (#18) of the present invention, however, showed a dramatic decrease in corrosion vs. the control as evidenced by a very small weight loss for hoth coupons and visual inspection that showed no rust or other residue present.<br>
