3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compounds which are capable of producing a cooling sensation when they are brought into contact with the human body. Such compounds have applications in many fields, particuiariy in oral and personal hygiene products and foodstuffs.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Tetrahydropyrimidine-2-one compounds are known to be useful in pharmaceutical preparations. For example, US 3,821,221 discloses a number of such compounds, and their effect as central nervous system stimulants or depressants. The compounds are said to be of value for therapeutic applications as potential psychotropic drugs.<br>
As a result of pharmacological research into these tetrahydropyrimidine-2-one derivatives, ft was discovered that icilin (also known as AG-3-5, chemical name 1 ^2-hydroxyphenyT]-^[2-nitrophenyr]-1 ,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-2-one) produced sensations of coldness when in contact with mucous membranes (nostrils, lips and eyelids) of the researchers, and also when ingested (see Wei et al, J. Pharm. Pharmacol 1983,35:110-112).<br>
A known compound for producing a sensation of cold is menthol (2-isopropyI-5-methyl-cyciohexanol), which has been extensively applied as an additive in, for example, foodstuffs and oral hygiene products. It is used primarily because it elicits a sensation of coolness in the mouth, and because it has a pleasing mint flavour and odour. The cooling effect of menthol is due to the action of menthol on the nerve endings of the human body which detect hot and cold stimuli. In particular, menthol is believed to activate cold receptors<br><br>
on nerve endings. However, the use of menthol is limited by its strong minty smell and relative volatility.<br>
It was found that icilin was capable of producing the same cooling effect as menthol. Icilin has a number of advantages over menthol, for example it is more potent, and has a lower acute toxicity, due to its lack of anaesthetic properties. Icilin was considered to be a particularly useful compound1 for pharmacological applications because it lacks the flavour and odour of menthol and is not readily absorbed through the skin. However, icilin has not been disclosed as a replacement for menthol for non-pharmaceutical applications.<br>

The compounds and compositions disclosed in the present invention have the ability to produce a cooling sensation when in contact with the skin, and/or mucosal membrane of a human or animal body. A "cooling sensation" as used throughout is thus intended to mean any sensation of coolness which is perceived by human or animal body. Such a cooling sensation is analogous to the sensation produced by compounds such as menthol, and/or the sensation elicited when cold-sensitive receptors, such as those identified in McKemy et al, Nature, Vol, 416,2002,52-58, are stimulated.<br>
A cooling sensation is desirable in many different applications. For example, the compounds and compositions of the invention have applications in a number of personal hygiene, oral hygiene and food product compositions.<br><br><br>
Personal hygiene applications include lotions, shaving cream, post shaving preparations, shampoos, conditioners, facial cleansers, soaps, bath oils and foams/ antiperspirants, deodorants. Oral hygiene applications include toothpastes, mouthwashes, dental floss, chewing gum and breath fresheners. Foodstuff applications include beverages, spreads, ice-creams and confectionery. Possible other applications where a cooling sensation may be desirable include pharmaceutical products (for example chewable pharmaceutical products, or throat lozenges), tobacco products, insect repellents and cosmetics.<br>
As stated above, a first embodiment of the invention provides the use of a compound of Formula |J] on order to produce a cooling sensation with the proviso that when R1 is 2-hydroxyphenyl, R2 is other than 3-nitrophenyl. in this embodiment, it has been found that preferred R1 groups include optionally substituted alkyl or aryl groups. The alky! group can be a linear group such as a C-1-10 aliphatic chaih, or a cyclic group, such as a C3-10 cyclic hydrocarbon. It is preferred mat R1 is an optionally substituted aryl or cyclic hydrocarbon group, such as a phenyl or cyclohexyl group.<br>
The preferred R2 groups include hydrogen atoms, or optionally substituted alkyl or aryl groups. Again, the R2 group can be a linear, aliphatic chain, or a cyclic hydrocarbon, as for R1. The preferred groups are optionally substituted aryl and cyclic hydrocarbon groups, with phenyl and cyclohexyl being particularly favoured. Alternatively, it may be desirable to replace these cyclic groups with other groups, such as a hydrogen atom, a straight chain alkyl group (e.g. a C1-10 alkyl group) or a branched chain alkyl group {e.g. a tertiary butyl group).<br>
A subset of particularly preferred compounds in the first embodiment are those according to general formula [II]:<br><br><br><br>

wherein the or each X and Y is independently a halogen atom or an alkyl, alkenyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, thiol, carboxy, nitro, sulphonamide, sulphonato, sulphonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carbonyl or amino group, and m and n are independently 0,1,2 or 3, with the proviso that when n is 1, m is 1 and Y is a hydroxy group in the ortho position, X is other than a nitro group in the meta position. Where the substituent X or Y groups contain an alkyl portion (e.g. the alkyl portion of haloalkyl), this alkyl portion preferably contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In the case of an alkenyl group, this preferably contains from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
X can be selected from any of the groups listed above, with hydrogen and halogen atoms, and nitro, hydroxy, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 haloalkyl and C1-6 alkoxy groups being preferred.

It is preferred that there is a single substituent on the phenyl ring, i.e. where m is 1. In this case the substituent can be present in the ortho, meta or para position, relative to the point of attachment of the phenyl ring to the rest of the molecule containing the cyclic urea group. The optimal point of attachment<br>
lO<br><br>
will depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the substituent and its electron-donating or electron-withdrawing effect. Particularly useful compounds include those where the substituent is present in the meta position.<br>
Similarly, Y can be selected from any of the groups listed above, with hydrogen, hydroxy, CM alkyl, C1-6 haloalkyl and C1-6 alkoxy groups"being preferred. The number of Y substituents can vary between 0 and 3, and the point of substitution of the phenyl ring may also be varied. It is preferred that there is a single Y substituent {i.e. where n is 1), which may be present in the ortho, meta or para position, relative to the point of attachment of the phenyl ring to the rest of the molecule containing the cyclic urea group. Particularly useful compounds include those where the single Y substituent is present in the ortho position.<br>
Thus, a particularly preferred compound in accordance with the first embodiment of the invention is one according to general formula [III]:<br><br>
wherein X and Y are independently selected from a halogen atom or an alkyl, alkenyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, thiol, carboxy, nitro or amino group, with<br><br><br>

Examples	*<br>
Example 1:<br>
Preparation of dimethyiamino-m-chloropropiophenone hydrochloride<br><br><br><br>
To a solution of tetramethyldiaminomethane (15.0 ml, 0.11 mol) in acetonitrile (350 ml) under nitrogen was added dropwise a solution of acetyl chloride (7.8 ml, 0.11 mol) in acetonitrile (7.83 ml) at room temperature. After the addition, ! stirring was continued for one hour and then 3"-chloroacetophenone (20.0 g, 0.13 mol) was added over 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 hours, cooled to room temperature and the white precipitate that formed was filtered off, washed with cold acetonitrile and dried under vacuum (22.9 g, 84%).<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
Preparation of B-(o-hydroxyanilino)-m-chloropropiophenone hydrochloride<br><br><br><br>
Dimethylamino-m-chloropropiophenone hydrochloride (74.9 g, 0.30 mol) was dissolved in 50% aqueous ethanol (700 ml) at reflux. 2-Aminophenol (32.9 g, 0.30 mol) was then added and the resulting red solution was refluxed for a further 2 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and then extracted twice with ethyl acetate (2 x 100 ml). Note that brine was also added at this point to allow the two layers to separate effectively). The organic extracte were combined and an excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid (47 ml) was added. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and then allowed to cool. The precipitate that formed was filtered of, washed with diethyl ether and dried in vacuo to yield a cream powder (38.1 g, 40%).<br><br>
Example 3:<br>
Preparation of H2"-hydroxyphenyl)4-(3"-chlorophenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyrimidine-2-one<br><br><br>
B-(o-HydroxyaniIino)-m-chloropropiophenone hydrochloride (4.0 g, 0.013 mol) was taken up in acetic acid (50 ml) and the mixture was warmed to 60°C. Potassium cyanate (2.6 g, 0.032 mol) was added and the resulting reaction mixture was kept at 60°C for a further 30 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Water (100 ml) was then added and the suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 30 ml) and the combined organic extracts were washed successively with 10% sodium hydroxide solution (100 ml), 10% hydrochloric acid (100 ml) and brine (100ml), The organic extract was the dried (Na2S04), concentrated in vacuo and allowed to cool overnight The precipitate that formed was filtered off and washed with diethyl ether to yield a cream powder (1.6 g, 41%).<br><br><br><br>
Example 4:<br>
The efficacy of different compounds according to the invention was tested in vitro, by exposing cultured neurons to the compounds and monitoring the cellular Ca2* levels.<br>
The compounds tested include a number according to the following general formula:<br><br><br><br>
The following specific compounds were tested, along with menthol as a comparative example:<br><br>
The compounds were dissolved in DMSO by ultrasonication to a 0.1 M solution. 5u1 of this stock was added to 5mg of cyclodextrin and 5ml of 140 Na-tyrode, to achieve a 100um final test concentration.<br>
2 j<br><br>
Neurons from trigeminal ganglia of Wistar rats were prepared as described in US 5,811,256. After 24 hours of cultivation, the responsiveness of the neurons to different compounds was measured according to the general procedure described by McKemy et al (Nature, Vol. 416, 2002, 52-58). The test protocol described by McKemy was modified slightly, by using trie fluorescent Ca2* indicator Fura-2. Detection of the cellular fluorescence signals was performed by videomicroscopical analysis. The neurons were given a cold stimulus by a thermocoupling device and were subsequently tested for responsiveness to the test compounds by superfusion with solutions containing the test compounds while continuously monitoring the cellular Ca2* levels.<br>
The results were recorded for compounds 1 to 3 and menthol, and are expressed below, as a percentage compared to the activity for compound 1 (icilin).<br><br>
Compound	Activity (% relative to Compound 1)<br>
1	100<br>
2	40<br>
3	,      35<br>
Menthol (comparative example)	42<br>
It can be seen that compounds according to the invention are effective in producing sensations of coolness when they are brought into contact with cultured neurons. It can be expected that the in vitro efficacy displayed in the above tests will also be achieved when the compounds are brought into contact with the human body (for example, the skin and/or mucosal membranes), thus providing a sensation of coolness.<br><br><br>
