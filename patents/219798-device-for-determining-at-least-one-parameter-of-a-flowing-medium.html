Prior Art<br>
The invention is based on a device for determining at least one parameter of a medium flowing in a line, having a sensor carrier to hold a sensor element, according to the generic type of Claim 1.<br>
DE 44 26 102 C2 and US A-5, 693, 879 disclose a sensor carrier for a sensor element in an air mass measuring device, the sensor carrier with the sensor element projecting into a measuring channel in which a medium flows. The sensor element supplies a measured signal which is used to calculate the mass of the flowing medium. The sensor carrier has a recess, into which the sensor element is introduced so as to be flush and is held by means of an adhesive layer applied to a bottom surface of the recess. In this case, the sensor carrier is produced by one opening firstly being cut out of a metal strip, corresponding approximately to the external shape of the sensor element, then the metal strip being bent about a bending axis outside the recess and then pressed together in such a way that a bent part of the metal strip forms a retaining element and an unbent part of the metal strip, together with the opening, forms a frame element of the sensor carrier. In this case, the retaining element covers the opening in the frame element and, together with the latter, forms a recess. Then, by means of further shaping of the retaining element, plateau-like elevations are produced, which are used as a spacer or supporting  surface.   The  sensor  element  is  then<br><br>
adhesively bonded into the recess.<br>
It is extremely important that the sensor element is adhesively bonded into the recess with its surface as flush as possible with the surface of the sensor carrier, since even the smallest offset, for example on account of a non-uniformly applied adhesive layer, results in eddies and separation regions which, in particular at the surface of the sensor element, have a detrimental effect on the dissipation of heat from the measuring resistor and distort the measured result. Therefore, very low dimensional tolerances of the recess have to be provided and, when the sensor element is adhesively bonded into the recess of the sensor carrier, extreme care is necessary, so that, in particular in the case of mass production of the device, a great deal of effort on production is necessary, which gives rise to considerable production costs.<br>
The various working steps to produce the frame and retaining element are disadvantageous. In addition, the flowing medium can flow through the folding gap between frame and retaining element. However, this is not a disadvantage, since this effect can be suppressed by means of zero-point measurement and calibration. However, the measured result becomes distorted during the lifetime of the sensor element if this folding gap becomes blocked by dirt and/or liquid particles and the calibration is no longer correct.<br>
It is disadvantageous that the spacers are formed only by means of a further shaping process. The tolerance of the depth dimension of the recess is given by the tolerance of the thickness of the metal strip and the tolerance of the folding gap thickness.<br>
It is also disadvantageous  that,  on account  of the<br><br>
flowing, corrosive medium, a corrosion prevention layer, such as Nina, has to be applied to the sensor carrier by means of an additional, expensive electroplating process or a coating method, which further increases the dimensional tolerances and the production times and costs.<br>
In the case of such a cantilevered means of fixing the sensor element, a gap is produced between the sensor element and the recess of the sensor carrier, because of tolerances during production. The gap may be so great that, in the sensor element, undesired flow under the cavity underneath its diaphragm in the recess can occur, which has a detrimental effect on the measured result from the device.<br>
Devices are therefore described in the literature in which the disruptive influence of the flow underneath can be reduced.<br>
Diverting the flow at a specifically shaped edge of the sensor element, as described in DE 195 24 634 Al or US-A-5,723,784, prevents medium flowing in over the gap getting into a cavity underneath the diaphragm of the sensor element.<br>
The application of bonded seams, as described in DE 197 43 40S Al, is able to prevent the penetration of the medium into the gap around the sensor element, in order to avoid undesired flow underneath.<br>
The disadvantage with both methods is that only by means of the specific arrangement of the bonded seams or by means of additional measures is the fled; deflected around the cavity, in order to compensate for the effects of the production tolerances.<br>
DE 197 44 997 Al discloses a device which permits the protection of the components of an evaluation circuit and also of the connecting lines to the contact-making area of the sensor element against moisture by means of<br><br>
a gel, and contamination of the sensor area, that is to say the part of the sensor element where there is a diaphragm,  is prevented by the gel.  In this case, widenings of a gap which runs between sensor element and the walls of the recess are provided, in order by means of  the widenings  to stop a protective layer, applied at least partly to the evaluation circuit, reliably in the gap,  so that the flow path of the protective layer always remains unambiguously defined. In   this   case,   the   result   is   the   production disadvantages that additional gaps have to be created, the  flow  of  the  gel  not  being  stopped  but  only deflected in a defined way.<br>
DE 198 28 629 Al discloses a thermal air quantity sensor, in which a carrier housing and a measuring housing are constructed separately from each other and the measuring housing and the carrier housing are adhesively bonded onto a base plate element.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
By contrast, the device according to the invention having the characterizing features of Claim 1 has the advantage that, in a simple way, the measured result is not made worse, even during a relatively long operating time, since there is no influencing of the measured result arising from an air flow flowing underneath the measuring element via a folding gap which is open or becomes blocked, and the tolerance of the depth dimension of the recess, according to the invention, is determined only by the tolerance of the sensor cavity and no longer additionally by the tolerance of the folding gap.<br>
The measures listed in the dependent claims make advantageous developments and improvements o'- the device specified in Claim I possible.<br><br>
It is advantageous to fix the sensor carrier in a bypass channel or in a carrier part, since this simplifies the assembly.<br>
If the sensor carrier is fixed to a base element- a sensor element can advantageously be connected to an electronic unit before being installed in the device.<br>
For the inflow behavior, an aerodynamically shaped leading edge is of advantage.<br>
For optimized flow behavior around the sensor element, it is advantageous if the sensor element is installed flush with a surface of the sensor carrier and/or there is a small gap between sensor element and sensor cavity.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if use is made of plastic from the class of liquid crystal polymers, or partially crystalline aromatic thermoplastic.<br>
During assembly, it is advantageous for a bead of adhesive to be placed transversely over the bottom of the sensor cavity, in the cutouts in the longitudinal edges of the sensor cavity, sealing off the sensor area of the sensor element in the sensor cavity completely, and for depressions to be made in the edge region of the bottom of the sensor cavity, so that the sensor element can be inserted more accurately. Contamination of the sensor element arising from reliable stopping of the gel which protects an evaluation circuit against moisture is prevented by this bead of adhesive.<br>
It is advantageous to use plastic for the sensor carrier since, as a result of the possibilities of shaping the plastic as desired, more finely divided forms and aerodynamic requirements,  such as those of<br><br>
the leading edge, may be taken into account.<br>
Furthermore,  it  is  advantageous  to  use plastic  or ceramic since, as compared with metal, plastic does not corrode so severely and therefore no further corrosion' prevention is necessary.<br>
Since, as a result of narrowing the tolerances on the basis of the use of plastic, very precise setting of the sensor element into the sensor cavity is advantageously possible, there is no longer any flow underneath the sensor element.<br>

Description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
Figure  1  shows  schematically-  how  a  device  2  is<br><br>
installed in a line 3, in which a medium to be measured flows.<br>
The device 1 is used to determine at least one parameter of the flowing medium and comprises a measuring housing 6, identified by a lower rectangle shown dash-dotted, and a carrier part 7, identified by an upper rectangle shown dash-dotted, in which there is accommodated, for example, an evaluation electronic unit 18, for example in an electronic space 19 on a base carrier 26 {Fig. 2).<br>
Parameters of a flowing medium are, for example, the air volume flow for determining an air mass, a temperature, a pressure, a concentration of a constituent of the medium or a flow velocity, which are determined by means of suitable sensors. The use of the device 1 for determinations of further parameters is possible. The determination of the parameters can be carried out by one or more sensors being used, it being possible for a sensor also to determine two or more parameters. The measuring housing 6 and the carrier part 7 have a common longitudinal axis 9 which, for example, can also be the central axis. The device i is inserted into a wall 12 of the line 3, for example such that it can be plugged in. The wall 12 bounds a flow cross section in the center of which a central axis 14 extends in the direction o: the flowing medium, parallel to the wall 12.<br>
The direction of the flowing medium, referred to below as the main flog  direction, is identified by appropriate arrows 16 and runs from left to right there.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sensor carrier 20 with a sensor element 33 installed. In Figure 2, the sensor element 33 is shown schematically and in part in transparent form and, on a surface that faces outward, has a diaphragm 3 5 which forms the sensor area. On the same surface,  at the other end of the sensor element 33,<br><br>
there are contacts 38, which produce the electrical connection to the electronic evaluation circuit 18. The construction of the sensor element 13 and the description of the sensor area are explained in more detail in DE 197 4 3 4 09 Al or DE 4 3 3 8 891 Al and US-A~5,4 52,610, which are intended to be part of this disclosure.<br>
The sensor element 33 is arranged in a sensor cavity 29 in such a way that the contacts 38 are closest to the base carrier 26. Here, the sensor element 33 is of wafer-like design, for example, and is flush with the sensor cavity 29. The sensor cavity 29 and the sensor element 33 form a gap 44. The sensor element 33 and the surface 22 of the sensor carrier 2 0 here end flush, for example.<br>
Figure 3a shows the sensor carrier 20 which, for example, is composed of plastic.<br>
The medium flows past the sensor carrier 20 in the direction of the arrows 16. In the process, it strikes a leading edge 47 of the sensor carrier 20 which, because of the use of plastic, can be molded particularly finely and aerodynamically, for example in rounded form.<br>
On the surface 22 there is the sensor cavity 29 with a sensor cavity bottom 30. The sensor cavitbottojr. 3C forms a retaining element, edges of the sensor cavity 29 forming a frame element. The sensor cavity bottom 3C is divided, for example, by means of an adhesive displacement space 49, into a sensor base surface 52 and a supporting surface 54. The sensor base surface 52 is furthest removed from the base carrier 2 6 and i s located under the sensor area of the sensor element 3 3. The supporting surface 54 is closest to the base carrier 25.<br>
Here, the adhesive displacement space 49 is, for example, a channel running through from one longitudinal edge 57 to the opposite long titian edge<br><br>
57' of the sensor cavity 29. The longitudinal edges 57, 57' run parallel to the longitudinal axis 9. However, the adhesive displacement space 49 can also be designed not to run through, that is to say to be shorter. The adhesive displacement  space 49    between  sensor base surface  52  and  supporting  surface  54  can  also  be formed,  for  example,  by  means  of  at  least  two depressions in the sensor cavity bottom 30.  In the supporting  surface 54  there are,  for  example,  four spacers 60, on which the sensor element 33 rests. The spacers 60 are,  for example,  of plateau-like design. Formed in the longitudinal edges 57, 57' in each case is, for example, a cutout 63,  63'. For the adhesive bonding process, a bead of adhesive 65, which is shown dashed,  is applied from the cutout  63,  transversely over the supporting surface 54,  to the other cutout 63'. After the sensor element 33 has been introduced into the sensor cavity 29, the sensor base surface 52 is completely protected by the bead of  adhesive 65 against a sensor gel, which is applied to an electronic evaluation circuit and creeps in an undesired way in the direction of the diaphragm 35. Following assembly, for example, the sensor element 33 lies to some extent in the sensor cavity 29 and, for example, rests on the spacers 60. In this case, the sensor element 33 is for example adhesively bonded to the supporting surface 54 by means of the bead of adhesive 65 and,  along its circumference, ends flush with the sensor cavity 29  at the level of the surface 22, so that the medium flows barely or not at all under the sensor element 3 into the sensor cavity 29. A gap 44 between sensor element 33 and the longitudinal edge 57 of the sensor cavity 29 has,  for  example,  an  order  of  magnitude  of  a  fed; micrometers. A depth of the sensor cavity 29 and the edges of the sensor cavity 29 are, for example, molded in such a way that a wafer-like sensor element 33, for example, can be introduced flush with the surface 22. The depth dimensions  in  the area  o:  the supporting<br><br>
surface 54 of the sensor element 33, starting from the surface 22, generally have a tolerance of +/- 10 micrometers.<br>
Here, the sensor carrier 2 0 is shaped in such a way that the surface 22 and the surface opposite the latter are plane-parallel to each other and are aligned in relation to the main flow direction 16 in such a way that a vector of the main flow direction 16 lies in the plane of the sensor area of the sensor element 33. The vector of the main flow direction 16 can intersect the plane of the sensor area at a small positive or negative angle. One possibility is for a cross section of the sensor carrier 20 to be formed in a wedge shape at right angles to the surface 22, the thinner end of the wedge being located in the area of the leading edge 47 and the vector of the main flow direction 16 not being located in the surface 22.<br>
Figure 3b shows a section along the line A-A in Figure 3a, the sensor carrier 20 in this example having nc adhesive displacement space 49 and no spacers 60. A channel front side 57 of the sensor carrier 20 is added to the form of a wall of a bypass channel 70 (Fig. 4), so that no flowing medium gets between the channel front side 67 and the wall of the bypass channel 70. It is possible to seal off additionally along this contact surface by means of adhesive bonding or sealing means. The end 68 opposite the channel front side 67 has an insert 65, which is inserted into a holder 73 {Fig. ^o) in the area of the electronic space 19 and is connected there, for example, by means of a press fit or adhesive bonding.<br>
Figure 4a shows the measuring housing 6 with the bypass channel 70 and the carrier part 7 without a cover closing the bypass channel 70. The bypass channel 70 is formed by a bottom part 7 2 and the cover. The main f lov; direction 16 of the medium is identified bv arrows. The<br><br>
bypass channel 70 comprises, for example, an inlet channel 74 or measuring channel 74, a deflection channel 76, which is in turn divided into a first part 77 and second part 78, and an outlet channel 80. The flow direction 82, 85 in the inlet channel 74 and outlet channel 80 is likewise identified by arrows. The inlet channel center line 85 is curved here, for example, since the marginal surfaces 88 of the inlet channel 7 4 are of streamlined design. The outlet channel center line 91 is, for example, a straight line here.<br>
In the front area 39 of the bypass channel 70, upstream of an inlet opening 97 through which the medium flows in, for example a flow obstruction 94 is provided which has the effect of a defined flow separation effective as a measuring channel. This is explained in more detail in DE 44 41 874 Al and is intended to be part of this disclosure.<br>
A nose 99 of the measuring housing 6 is, for example, shaped in such a way that solid or liquid particles striking it are reflected away from the inlet opening 97. For this purpose, the nose 99 is inclined and directed away from the carrier part 7.<br>
An area 102 which is shown dashed and runs parallel tc the main flow direction 16, together with the marginal surface of the inlet channel 74 that faces the carrier part 7, forms a shadowed area, into which only a few or no dirt particles or liquids pass.<br>
In the first part 77 of the deflection channel 76, for example a marginal surface 104 is inclined at an angle S counter to the main flow direction It. The angle 6 may lie in the range from abour 30 to 60 degrees, ideally at around 45 degrees. The influence of this design is described in more detail in DE 196 23   334   P-A<br><br>
and is intended to be part of this disclosure. The marginal surface 104 has a depth tr (not shown) and a width br at right angles thereto which corresponds to at least 2/3 of the width b of the inlet opening 97 of the inlet channel 74. The depth tr preferably corresponds approximately to the depth t (not sho\'m) of the measuring channel 70 at right angles to its width b at the inlet opening 97. However, it is also possible to design the marginal surface 104 with a depth tr which is somewhat smaller than the depth t of the inlet opening 97 of the inlet channel 7 4. Following the marginal surface 104, the wall of the first portion 77 runs approximately in the direction of the longitudinal axis  9.<br>
At the end of the outlet channel 80 there is an outlet opening 107, whose surface forms an angle / with the main flow direction 16 and through which the mediurr, leaves the measuring channel again, The outlet opening 107 has, for example, a larger cross section than the outlet channel 80. as a result of which the pulsation behavior is improved.<br>
The sensor carrier 20 projects into the bypass channel 70, for example in the inlet channel 74 which forms the measuring channel.<br>
The sensor element 31 is accommodated in the sensor carrier 20 and is expediently located ir. the shadowed area of the inlet channel 74. The construction of such a measuring element 10 is sufficiently well known to those skilled in the art, for example frorr. DE 195 24 634 Al, whose disclosure is intended to be a constituent part of the present patent application.<br>
The electronic unit 1&amp;, which is used to evaluate and control the sensor element, is arranged in the electronic space 19, which is part of the carrier part<br><br>
Figure 4b shows a section along the line B-B from Figure 4a. The sensor carrier 20 is inserted into a holder 7 3 and fixed there by a press fit or adhesive bonding. If adhesive is used, it s imultaneously seals off a transition area 71 between bypass channel 7 0 and the electronic space IS.<br>
The holder 73 can be arranged in the bypass channel 70, in the carrier part 7 or between them. One side wall 75 of the bypass channel 70 faces away from the carrier part 1, and the longitudinal axis 9 forms with the side wall 75 an intersection angle that is considerably different from zero. The channel front side 67 matches the side wall 75 of the bypass channel 70 with an exact shape, so that no flow underneath can occur there. This can additionally be ensured there by applying adhesive or sealant.<br>
The electronic unit IE is, for example, arranged on a base carrier 26 and is covered with a protective gel, The sensor carrier 20 can also be adhesively bonded to the base carrier 26.<br>
Figure 5 shows a section along the line V-V in Figure 2 through the sensor carrier 2 0 with the sensor element 33 inserted and the bead of adhesive 65 [indicated dashed) . The bead of adhesive 65 has been placed, for example, from, the cutout 63 on the longitudinal edge 57, over the contact surface 54, to the cutout 62' on the longitudinal edge 57 ' . After the insertion of the sensor element 33 into the sensor cavity 29, for example, adhesive is displaced outward into the adhesive displacement space 49 and through the gaps 44, 44' and reaches as far as the surface 22. The adhesive completely closes the gap 44 between sensor element 33 and sensor cavity 29 at one longitudinal edge 57, going through under the sensor element 3 3 to the other longitudinal  edge  57 '  and  the  gap  44 ' ,  sc  that<br><br>
contamination of the sensor element 33 with its diaphragm 3 5 is prevented by reliably stopping the creeping protective gel of the evaluation circuit 18.<br>
Figure 6 shows various arrangements of sensor carrier 2 0 and sensor element 33 within the measuring housing 6, which is indicated by being shown dashed. In Figure 4a) , the sensor carrier 20 is arranged as follows: a longitudinal axis 9 of the sensor carrier 10 is at right angles to the main flow direction 16, and a longitudinal axis of the sensor element 33 runs parallel to the longitudinal axis 9.<br>
In Figure 6a), the sensor element 33 is arranged with its longitudinal axis 110 in the sensor carrier 20 but inclined by an angle 0 with respect to the longitudinal axis 9.<br>
In Figure 6b) , a longitudinal axis 112 of the sensor carrier 20 is arranged to be inclined at an angle £ with respect to the longitudinal axis 9. The longitudinal axis 110 of the sensor element 33 runs parallel to the longitudinal axis 9. With these arrangements, the behavior of the flog; against and around the sensor element 33 and the sensor carrier 20 can be improved further. Furthermore, by this means a preferred orientation of the sensor element 33 in relation to the main flow direction 16 can be set.<br><br>
