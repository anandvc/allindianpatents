Related Application<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part application of<br>
United States Patent Application serial number 09/188,031 filed<br>
November 6, 1998, assigned to the same assxgnee as the this<br>
patent application.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to improvements in pipettes<br>
and, more particularly, to air displacement pipettes including a<br>
novel mounting shaft and a unique pipette tip tailored to the<br>
mounting shaft such that the tip is easily insertable by a<br>
pipette user onto the shaft to a fluid tight position in which<br>
the tip is secured against undesired lateral rocking on or<br>
displacement from the shaft and, after use, is easily ejectable<br>
from the shaft by the pipette user; such tip insertion and<br>
ejection requiring the pipette user to only exert axial tip<br>
insertion and ejection forces of about one pound or less thereby<br>
substantially eliminating all risk of repetitive motion injury to<br>
the pipette user.<br>
The use of pipette devices for the transfer and dispensing<br>
of precise quantities of fluids in analytical systems is well<br>
known as is the use of disposable tip members for such pipettes.<br>
Disposable tiPs accommodate the serial use of such pipette<br>
devices in the transfer of different fluids without carryover or<br><br>
contamination.<br>
Generally speaking, disposable pipette tips are formed of a<br>
plastic material and are of a hollow, elongated, generally<br>
conical shape with an open proximal end for receiving and<br>
releasably mating with tne distal end of an elongated generally<br>
conical pipette tip mounting shaft of a pipette device. Ideally,<br>
the disposable tip should slide easily onto the mounting shaft to<br>
an axial position adjacent a lower end of a tip ejection<br>
mechanism of the pipette device. Thus located, the pipette tip<br>
should be laterally stable on the shaft, free from external<br>
rocking relative to the shaft (as during "touching off), and<br>
should form a fluid tight annular seal with the mounting shaft.<br>
Then when it is desired to replace the tip with a new tip, the<br>
.pipette tip should be easily removed from the mounting shaft by<br>
operation of the tip ejection mechanism.<br>
To meet the desired sealing criteria for disposable pipette<br>
tips on pipette tip mounting shafts, the inner surface and side<br>
walls of the proximal portions of most pipette tips axe axially<br>
tapered at a one to one and a half degree greater angle than the<br>
distal end of the pipette tip mounting shaft and form an axially<br>
elongated frusto-conical annular sealing band. The sealing band<br>
is dimensioned to stretch outwardly ("hoop stretch") as the<br>
distal end of the elongated generally conical pipette tip<br>
mounting shaft is forced into the proximal end of the tip to<br>
firmly seat the tip on the shaft and to create an axially<br><br>
elongated annular fluid right seal between the sealing band and<br>
the mounting shaft. Other pipette tips, such as those described<br>
in United States patents 4,748,859 and 4,824,641, include a<br>
plurality Of axially spaced cbmpressible annular sealing rings on<br>
an inner surface of the proximal end portion of such tips. The<br>
rings create multiple axially spaced fluid tight annular seals<br>
between the outer surface of the pipette tip mounting shaft and<br>
the inner surface of the proximal end portion of the tip which by<br>
virtue of the axially spaced rings is laterally stabilized<br>
against undesired rocking on the shaft during touching off.<br>
Usually, in mounting a pipette tip on a mounting shaft of a<br>
pipette, a user, exerting a downward force of between twelve and<br>
fifteen pounds, drives the mounting shaft axially into the tip a<br>
distance which to the user seems sufficient to create (i) a fluid<br>
tight seal between the tip and (ii) the desired lateral stability<br>
for the tip on the shaft. On occasion, in a mistaken attempt to<br>
improve the lateral stability of a pipette tip on a mounting<br>
shaft, a user will exert a downward insertion force (e.g.<br>
eighteen to twenty-five pounds) on the shaft sufficient to<br>
axially drive the tip on the shaft until an upper surface of the<br>
tip engages or is wedged into the ejector arm or cone of the tip<br>
ejector mechanism of the pipette. The contact between a lower<br>
surface of the tip ejector arm or cone and the upper surface of<br>
the tip, however, only provides a minimal resistance to rocking<br>
cf the tip on the shaft and hence only results in a minimal<br><br>
increase in the lateral stability of the tip on the shaft.<br>
Further, since most pipette tips are formed of a relatively rigid<br>
plastic material, the annular stretching cf the pipette tip<br>
required to accommodate movement cf the tip onto the shaft<br>
particularly to a point where it engages the lower surface cf the<br>
tip ejector or cone is difficult to achieve. In fact, the axial<br>
forces which must be exerted on a conventional pipette to achieve<br>
such a positioning of the tip on the pipette tip mounting shaft<br>
exceed twelve and may be as great as twenty pounds, which is<br>
difficult for many pipette tip users to generate. Of course,<br>
with most pipette, tip designs, the greater the axial, force<br>
exerted in seating a pipette tip on a pipette mounting shaft, the<br>
greater the force required to eject the tip from the mounting<br>
shaft. Thus, while the insertion of a pipette tip onto a<br>
mounting shaft until it reaches a position against a lower<br>
surface of a pipette tip ejector mechanism provides a minimum<br>
increase in the lateral stability of the tip on the shaft, it<br>
works against the design criteria for disposable pipette tips<br>
that they be easily removable from the shaft when it is desired<br>
to replace the tip.<br>
In fact, the design criteria for disposable pipette tips<br>
that they be stably mountable on and form a fluid tight seal with<br>
a pipette mounting shaft is more easily achieved than the design<br>
criteria that disposable pipette tips slide easily cntc a pipetta<br>
tip mounting shaft to an axial location forming a fluid tight<br><br>
seal and then be easily removable from the mounting shaft when it<br>
is desired to replace the tip.<br>
In these regards, the pipette tip mounting shafts of devices<br>
for pipetting volumes of liquid in different ranges have<br>
different external shape. For example, the distal end of<br>
standard pipette tip mounting shafts of pipettes for pipetting<br>
liquids in volumes greater than 500 microliters (large volume<br>
pipettes) commonly have a downward and inward axial taper of<br>
about one and one half to two and one half degrees per side from<br>
the longitudinal axis of the mounting shaft. On the other hand,<br>
the distal end of the mounting shafts of moderate to relatively<br>
small volume pipette devices (250 microliters and less) commonly<br>
have a downward and inward axial taper of about two to five<br>
degrees per side from the longitudinal axis of the mounting shaft<br>
so that the nose of the shaft will hit the inner wall of the<br>
pipette tip and cause hoop stretching thereof before the side of<br>
the shaft engages the inner wall of the tip. Therefore, while<br>
the design criteria that a large volume pipette tip be easily<br>
mountable on and easily removable from the mounting shaft of a<br>
large volume pipette device may be achieved by including a<br>
proximal end portion having a side wall of reduced wall thickness<br>
is in the large volume pipette tip described in United States<br>
patent 5,779,984, issued July 14, 1998, such a thin wall design<br>
vill not result in a pipette tip that satisfies the easy mount<br>
and ejection design criteria of moderate and small volume pipette<br><br>
tips which must firmly mount on pipette tip mounting shafts<br>
having an inward taper of two degrees and above. The same is<br>
true of the pipette tip design disclosed in United States parent<br>
4,072,330 which includes a frusto-conical sealing region having<br>
a thin side wall.<br>
As previously stared, standard small and moderate volume<br>
pipette tips include a frusto-conical annular sealing band or<br>
inner surface for engaging and sealing with the tapered distal<br>
end of a pipette tip mounting shaft. The angle of taper of the<br>
sealing surface usually approximates (e.g. one and one-half<br>
degrees greater than) that of the mounting shaft (e.g. two to<br>
five degrees). Thinning the side wall cf the standard small and<br>
moderate volume pipette tips in the region of such a sealing band<br>
does little to reduce the mounting and ejection forces required<br>
to move such a tip to a sealing location and then eject the<br>
pipette tip from the mounting shaft. In forming the desired<br>
annular seal, the frusto-conical annular region is required to<br>
stretch like a hoop (hoop stretch) outwardly normal to the mating<br>
sloping surface of the pipette tip mounting shaft. Large<br>
reactive forces in the tip material resist such hoop stretching<br>
and require the exertion of large axial forces (eg. ten or more<br>
pounds) on the tip in order to mount the tip on the mounting<br>
shaft and create the necessary annular fluid tight seal. Such<br>
reactive forces increase as the tip is driven toward the tip<br>
ejection mechanism of the associated pipette device.<br><br>
Further, disposable pipette tips are commonly mounted and<br>
stored in sterilizable racks. Such racks commonly include a<br>
support tray having an array of holes for receiving distal ends<br>
of pipette tips to vertically orient the pipette tips in a spaced<br>
rectilinear pattern with open proximal ends of the tips exposed<br>
to receive the mounting shafts of a pipette device onto which the<br>
pipette tips are to be mounted. For example, to mount the<br>
disposable pipette tips contained in a tip rack on the shafts of<br>
a multi-channel pipette, the pipette device is placed over the<br>
rack with its several mounting shafts aligned with the open<br>
proximal ends of an aligned series of the pipette tips. After a<br>
slight initial insertion of the mounting shafts into the open<br>
proximal ends of the aligned pipette tips, a relatively large<br>
downward force is exerted on the pipette device to drive the<br>
mounting shafts into the tip members. The pipette tips are thus<br>
very firmly seated on the mounting shafts and are lifted from the<br>
rack with upward movement of the multi-channel pipette.<br>
Unfortunately, in practice, such multiple pipette tip mounting<br>
procedures often result in some of the pipette tips being mounted<br>
at different axial locations on some of the mounting shafts. In<br>
an attempt to eliminate such non-uniform mounting of pipette tips<br>
on the several channels of a multi channel pipette, users often<br>
rock the pipette as the mounting shafts are driven by axial<br>
forces approximating 12 to 15 pound per channel into the tips<br>
supported by a pipette tip rack to drive the tips toward the<br><br>
lower surface of the tip ejector mechanism of the pipette.<br>
Moreover, the more firmly a tip is mounted or wedged on the<br>
mounting shaft of the pipette device, the greater the axial force<br>
which a pipette user must generate by thumb and hand action tc<br>
eject the tip from the shaft when a tip replacement is desired.<br>
In practice, it is not uncommon for axial forces approximating<br>
ten pounds per pipette channel to be generated by the pipette<br>
users thumb and hand in driving a tip from a mounting shaft.<br>
Over several and repeated ejection operations, particularly with<br>
multi-channel pipettes where the generation of substantially<br>
greater axial forces is required, the thumb and hand of the user<br>
become physically stressed often resulting in repetitive stress<br>
injury to the thumb and hand and in extreme cases, carpal tunnel<br>
syndrome.<br>
Still further, standard pipette tips as well as those<br>
illustrated in United States patent 4,072,330 depend solely upon<br>
-he sealing region of the pipette tip to both create the annular<br>
fluid tight seal and to provide the stable lateral mounting of<br>
the tip to the shaft sufficient to resist rocking as during<br>
touching off. The structure of such pipette tips do not provide<br>
such lateral mounting stability and but for those rare instances<br>
where the tips are jammed upward against the bottom of the<br>
pipette tip ejector arm or cone, minimal lateral stability cf the<br>
tip on the shaft is achieved.<br>
In an effort to improve lateral stability and retention cf<br><br>
pipette tips on the mounting shafts of some pipettes, some<br>
manufacturers include O-rings on and encircling the tip mounting<br>
shafts of their pipettes. For example, the Brinkmann Instrument<br>
Co. indicates for its Transferpipette 8/12 that such O-rings<br>
ensure that all tips stay firmly mounted during use. However,<br>
there is a rapid wearing of such O-rings with repeated insertion<br>
of the associated mounting shafts into and ejection of pipette<br>
tips from such shafts. With such wear, the tips no longer stay<br>
firmly mounted during use and wear particles from the O-rings can<br>
contaminate fluid samples handled by the associated pipettes.<br>
In an effort to reduce the hand and finger forces which a<br>
pipette user must generate to eject a tip from the mounting shaft<br>
of a pipette, other pipette manufacturers such as LabSystems have<br>
developed and include in some of their pipettes gear and ratchet<br>
mechanisms for amplifying the user generated forces to eject<br>
pipette tips from their mounting shafts. Unfortunately, such<br>
mechanisms are costly and add undesired size and weight to the<br>
pipettes.<br>
More recently, to meet the previously described ideal<br>
characteristics and criteria for a pipette tip, there has been<br>
developed an improved plastic pipette tip which is mountable on<br>
and ejectable from a standard pipette mounting shaft of an air<br>
displacement pipette by application of an axial mounting force of<br>
less than six pounds and an axial ejection force as small as<br>
three pounds. The improved pipette tip is described ir. the<br><br>
concurrently filed United States patent application, Serial<br>
Number 09/188,030, entitled "Easy Eject Pipette Tip". As there<br>
described, to meet the mountability and ease of ejection criteria<br>
for disposable pipette tips, the improved pipette tip,<br>
hereinafter referred to as the "Soft Seal" tip, includes an open<br>
tubular proximal end portion comprising an enlarged frusto-<br>
conical open top tapering downwardly and inwardly to join at an<br>
annular sealing region to a hollow substantially cylindrical mid-<br>
portion of the pipette tip. The open top has an inner diameter<br>
sufficient to axially • receive the distal end of a standard<br>
pipette tip mounting shaft. The annular sealing region is formed<br>
by the transition or line of connection of the frusto-conical<br>
open top to the mid-portion of the pipette and includes an<br>
annular sidewall having a thickness in a range of .20 to .50 mm.<br>
The mid-portion has an inner diameter at the sealing region which<br>
is less than the diameter of the pipette mounting shaft, a thin<br>
resilient annular side wall having a thickness in a range of .20<br>
to .50 mm and an axial length in a range of .25 to .65 cm. Thus,<br>
while the distal end of the mounting shaft fits into the enlarged<br>
open end of the pipette tip, the frusto—conical outer surface of<br>
the mounting shaft engages the inner surface of the sealing<br>
region at the bottom of the open top of the pipette tip to<br>
stretch the annular sealing region or line radially outward as<br>
the mounting shaft is inserted into the proximal portion, thereby<br>
creating a fluid tight seal between the sealing zone and the<br><br>
sealing region. In addition to the proximal portion, the<br>
improved pipette tip includes a tubular distal portion extending<br>
from the mid-portion and terminating in a relatively narrow<br>
distal end opening for passing fluid into and from the tip upon<br>
operation of the pipette device. Finally, the improved pipette<br>
tip preferably includes lateral stabilizing means on its inner<br>
surface adjacent the sealing region for engaging the outer<br>
surface of the mounting shaft as it is inserted into the proximal<br>
portion to laterally stabilize the tip on the shaft. Such<br>
lateral stabilising means preferably comprises at least three<br>
circumferentially spaced contacts extending inwardly from the<br>
inner surface of the proximal portion of the tip adjacent the<br>
sealing region for engaging the outer surface of the mounting<br>
shaft as it is inserted into the proximal portion to laterally<br>
stabilise the tip on the shaft. In this regard, the diametric<br>
spacing of the contacts is such that the contacts lightly engage<br>
and allow the distal end of the shaft to pass with no hoop<br>
stretching of the sidewalls from which the contacts extend. In<br>
this manner, the contacts combine with the sealing region to<br>
provide lateral support for the pipette tip on the mounting shaft<br>
and prevent the pipette tip from moving laterally when lateral<br>
external forces are exerted on the distal portion of the tip as<br>
during touching off.<br>
While the improved pipette tip as described above represents<br>
a substantial improvement over standard pipette tips with respect<br><br>
to the axial forces which are required to mount the tip on and<br>
eject the tip from a pipette mounting shaft, there is a<br>
continuing need to still further reduce the risk of repetitive<br>
motion injuries to pipette users and a continuing desire to<br>
further minimize the axial forces which are required to stably<br>
mount a pipette tip on and eject a pipette tip from a pipette<br>
mounting shaft. The present invention satisfies that need.<br>
Summary of Invention,<br>
To meet the heretofore unattainable ideal criteria that<br>
disposable plastic pipette tips (i) be easily mountable on a<br>
pipette tip. mounting shaft to form a fluid tight connection with<br>
the shaft which is so secure that the tip will not rock laterally<br>
on or accidently dislodge from the shaft during normal pipette<br>
use and (ii) then be easily ejectable from the mounting shaft by<br>
application of minimal axial mounting and ejection forces, e.g.<br>
forces approaching one pound or less, the present invention has<br>
adopted a unique approach. It incorporates in an air<br>
displacement pipette the concept of axially spaced annular<br>
sealing and substantially cylindrical lateral support zones and<br>
regions on the pipette's mounting shaft and tip, respectively.<br>
Further, it provides means for insuring uniform depth of mounting<br>
shaft penetration into the pipette tip to maintain uniform tip<br>
interference with the mounting shaft as successive tips are<br>
mounted on and ejected from the mounting shaft.<br>
In particular, the present invention comprises a combination<br><br>
of a pipette tip mounting shaft and pipette tip in an air displacement<br>
pipette. The mounting shaft comprises an axially elongated body<br>
including a distal end and annular or substantially cylindrical and<br>
axially spaced outer surface regions defining an annular sealing zone and<br>
an annular lateral support zone. The pipette tip is an elongated tube<br>
comprising an open proximal end, an open conical distal end and<br>
annular or substantially cylindrical and axially spaced inner surface<br>
regions defining an annular sealing region and an annular lateral<br>
support region. The outer diameter of the annular sealing zone of the<br>
annular sealing region on the pipette tip and the sidewall of the tip in the<br>
area of the annular sealing region is sufficiently thin that the annular<br>
sealing region expands slightly to form an interference fit and air tight<br>
seal between the mounting shaft and the pipette tip when the sealing<br>
penetrates the sealing region. The axial spacing of the sealing and<br>
support zones is substantially equal to the axial spacing of the sealing<br>
and support regions. Also, the outer diameter of the lateral support zone<br>
is slightly less than or substantially equal to the inner diameter of the<br>
lateral support region over at least some portion of the circumference of<br>
the support zone. This allows for some minimal contact between the<br>
support zone and region without creating a secondary air tight seal<br>
which would result in an undesired increase in the axial forces required<br>
to	<br><br>
mount and eject the pipette tip on and from the shaft. With such<br>
a structural configuration, as the sealing zone penetrates the<br>
sealing region, the support region receives the support zone and<br>
provides lateral support therefor which prevents transverse<br>
rocking of the pipette tip on the mounting shaft as might<br>
otherwise occur during touching off of the pipette tip and an<br>
accompanying undesired dislodging of the tip from the shaft.<br>
Further/ the preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes the aforementioned controlled interference air tight fit<br>
and mating annular lateral support zone and region as well<br>
cooperative means on the pipette and pipette tip for limiting the<br>
axial travel of the tip on the mounting shaft. This insures<br>
uniform depth of mounting shaft penetration into the pipette tip<br>
to maintain uniform the desired tip interference with the<br>
mounting shaft as successive tips are mounted on and ejected from<br>
the mounting shaft and is to be distinguished from the pipette<br>
tip shoulder structure of previously mentioned United States<br>
patent 4,824,641.<br>
Because of the above described cooperative structural<br>
features of the pipette tip and mounting shaft, the pipette tip<br>
combination of the present invention has proven to only require<br>
axial pipette tip mounting and ejection forces substantially<br>
equal to or less than one pound and to provide a stable air-tight<br>
seal of the tip on the shaft which is secure against undesired<br>
lateral rocking of the pipette tip on the mounting shaft. Thus,<br><br>
the combination comprising the present invention requires a pipette user<br>
to generate so little hand and thumb force that repeated mounting and<br>
ejection of such pipette tips is unlikely to result in repetitive stress<br>
injury.<br>
Further, for pipette tip and shaft combinations wherein the interference<br>
fit between the sealing zone and region is about .075 mm to about .2 mm<br>
and the wall thickness of the pipette tip in the sealing region is between<br>
.2 and .5 mm, it has been discovered that the desired minimal tip<br>
mounting and ejection forces associated with the present invention still<br>
may be achieved and the lateral stability of the tip on the shaft further<br>
enchanced when there is a small interference fit between the support<br>
region and zone. The small interference fit is provided by the lateral<br>
support region of the tip having an inner diameter which is slightly less<br>
than the outer diameter of the lateral support zone of the shaft, e.g. Less<br>
than .075 mm. Further, when the shaft and tip are concentric and<br>
substantailly circular in the support zone and region, a secondary air<br>
tight seal may be created between the support zone and region without<br>
creating an undesired increase in the axial forces required to mount and<br>
eject the tip on and from the shaft.<br>

Detailed Description of Invention<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a standard manual pipette resembling the<br>
PIPETMAN pipette sold exclusively in the United States by the<br>
Rainin Instrument Co. Inc., assignee of the present invention.<br>
The manual pipette is designated in fig. 1 by the number 10 and<br>
includes a pipette tip ejector mechanism 12 described in United<br>
States patent 3,991,617 issued November 16, 1976, which is<br>
incorporated nerexn oy tnxs reference.<br>
The pipette 10 comprises a push button 14 connected by a rod<br>
16 to a piston (not shown) located in the body or housing 18 of<br>
the pipette. The push button 14 may be depressed by a user<br>
exerting a downward force on the push button to cause downward<br>
movement of the piston of the pipette. When the push button 14<br>
is released, a quantity of liquid to be sampled is sucked into a<br>
disposable pipette tip 20 releasably secured to a lower end of a<br>
pipette tip mounting shaft 22 of the pipette. The sample then<br>
may be transferred into another vessel by once more exerting a<br>
downward force on the push button 14. After such use, it is<br>
common practice to eject the pipette tip 20 from the mounting<br>
shaft 22 and replace it with a new pipette tip for repeated<br>
operation of the pipette 10 in aspirating and dispensing a new<br>
sample fluid.<br><br>
The pipetre tip ejector mechanism 12 is employed to eject<br>
the tip 20 from the mounting shaft 22. In this respect, the<br>
mechanism 12 comprises a push button 24 connected to a rod<br>
located in a passage (not shown) provided in an upper part of the<br>
hand holdable housing 18 of the pipette 10. The passage and rod.<br>
are arranged so as to be able to impart to the rod a movement of<br>
translation parallel to an axis of the pipette in opposition to<br>
a spring (not shown) normally urging the rod in an upward<br>
position. A removable tip ejector member or arm 26 including a<br>
tubular upper end extends from a lower end of the rod and from<br>
the rod follows the general exterior contour of the housing 18 of<br>
the pipette to terminate in a sleeve 28. The sleeve 28 encircles<br>
a conical lower end 30 of the pipette tip mounting shaft 22 which<br>
tightly receives the upper end of the disposable pipette tip 20.<br>
To eject the pipette tip 20 from the lower end of the mounting<br>
shaft 22, a user grips the pipette housing 18 and using his or<br>
her thumb presses downward on the push button 24. The downward<br>
force on the push button is translated by the rod to the tip<br>
ejector arm 26 and hence to the sleeve 28 which presses down on<br>
an upper end of the pipette tip. When the downward force<br>
transferred by the sleeve 28 exceeds the friction between the<br>
pipette tip 20 and the mounting shaft 22, the pipette tip is<br>
propelled from the mounting shaft. Upon a release of the push<br>
button 24, the spring returns the tip ejector mechanism 12 to its<br>
normal position with the sleeve spaced slightly from the upper<br><br>
end of a replacement pipette tip which is inserted onto the<br>
mounting shaft 22 readying the pipette 10 for its next aspiration<br>
and dispensing operation.<br>
As previously stated, for standard small and moderate volume<br>
pipettes, the pipette tip mounting shaft 22 has an inward axial<br>
taper of between two and five degrees from the longitudinal axis<br>
of the mounting shaft. As also previously stated, standard small<br>
and moderate volume pipettes tips for use with such standard<br>
pipette tip mounting shafts include a relatively long frustoccnical<br>
 annular sealing band or inner surface contiguous with the<br>
open proximal end of the tip for engaging and sealing with the<br>
frusto-conical distal end of the pipette tip mounting shaft to<br>
provide lateral stability for the tip on the shaft. The angle of<br>
taper of the sealing surface is usually within about one degree<br>
of the two to five degrees inward taper of the mounting shaft and<br>
the length of the sealing surface on the shaft is such that in<br>
forming the annular seal the tip is also fairly stable on the<br>
shaft. In forming the desired annular seal, the frusto conical<br>
annular sealing region along with the balance of the open<br>
proximal end of the pipette tip is required to stretch like a<br>
hoop outwardly normal to the mating sloping surface of the<br>
pipette tip mounting shaft. Because of the length of the sealing<br>
region and the relatively thick sidewall of the standard tip,<br>
large plastic forces in the tip material which resist such<br>
outward hoop stretching and require exertion of large axial<br><br>
forces on the tip in order to mount the standard tip on the<br>
mounting shaft and create the necessary annular fluid tight seal.<br>
Often, axial forces between 12 and 15 pounds are required to<br>
mount a standard pipette tip on a standard mounting shaft and<br>
create the desired fluid tight seal. Such axial forces are<br>
generated by the hand and forearm of a pipette user in exerting<br>
a pipette tip mounting shaft into a pipette tip usually held in<br>
a pipette tip mounting rack. Of course, when it is desired to<br>
eject such a firmly mounted tip from a pipette tip mounting<br>
shaft, an axial force of approximately ten (10) pounds must be<br>
exerted on the upper edge of the pipette tip to overcome the<br>
friction forces between the pipette tip and shaft and to eject<br>
the tip from the shaft.<br>
The relationship between tip insertion and tip ejection<br>
forces is depicted by the curve 60 in Fig. 8 for a standard 250<br>
ml pipette tip, the tip insertion forces increasing from 0 to<br>
about 20 pounds at a point 62 where the tip engages an ejection<br>
mechanism of the associated pipette device. As previously<br>
described, the downward tip ejection forces are exerted by the<br>
pipette user pressing downward with his or her thumb on the top<br>
of the push button 24 to translate axial force through the<br>
ejector arm 26 to the top of the pipette tip 20. As indicated in<br>
Fig. 8, to eject the standard pipette tip from its associated<br>
mounting shaft requires the pipette user to generate an axial<br>
ejection force of about 12 pounds. Over the course of several<br><br>
repeated ejection operations, the thumb and hand of the user will<br>
become physically stressed. This often results in repetitive<br>
motion injury to the thumb and hand and in extreme cases carpal<br>
tunnel syndrome.<br>
•K\ J^ In an att:efflPi: Zo overcome such problems, the previously<br>
"10^ W referred to Soft. Seal pipette tip design described in the<br>
\ Xp^'''^'-<i filed united states patent was></i>
« jdr*' \* developed. As depicted.by the curve 70 in Fig. 8, the Soft Seal<br>
^ pipette, tip design allows for the easy and firm mounting of a<br>
)r JJT pipette tip on a mounting -shaft and the easy ejection of the<br>
. 	pipette;:;tip ..from the mounting shaft by the..application of axial<br>
mo.unting of about six (6) pounds and axial ejection forces of<br>
about three 
applied force necessary to insert and eject the Soft Seal tip to<br>
and from a location on a standard pipette mounting shaft where<br>
the tip engages the tip ejection mechanism of an associated<br>
pipette. The substantial reduction in tip insertion and ejection<br>
forces associated with the Soft Seal pipette tip when compared to<br>
those of a standard pipette tip is clear from a comparison of<br>
curve 70 to curve 60.<br>
As previously indicated, the present invention provides a<br>
novel mounting shaft and unique pipette tip tailored to the<br>
mounting shaft such that the tip is even more easily insertable<br>
^»y a pipette user onto the shaft to a fluid tight position in<br>
which the tip is secured against undesired lateral rocking on or<br><br>
displacement from the shaft and, which after use, is even more<br>
easily ejectable from the shaft by the pipette user. Such tip<br>
insertion and ejection operations require the pipette user to<br>
only exert axial tip insertion and ejection forces of about one<br>
pound or less, thereby substantially reducing all risk of<br>
repetitive motion injury to the pipette user. As depicted by the<br>
curve 80 in Fig. 8 the design of the present invention, referred<br>
hereinafter as the "LTS" tip and/or shaft, allows for the easy<br>
and firm mounting of the pipette tip of the present invention on<br>
its associated mounting shaft and the easy ejection of the<br>
pipette tip from the mounting shaft by the application of axial<br>
mounting and ejection forces of about one (1) pound. In Fig. 8,<br>
the point 82 depicts the applied force necessary to insert and<br>
eject the LTS tip to and from a location on the mounting shaft of<br>
the present invention where the tip engages a. tip insertion<br>
shoulder for limiting penetration of the shaft into the tip. As<br>
will be described hereinafter, in different embodiments of the<br>
present invention, such a shoulder comprises a shoulder on the<br>
tip or on the shaft or the base of a tip ejection mechanism of<br>
the associated pipette. The substantial reduction in tip<br>
insertion and ejection forces associated with the LTS pipette tip<br>
when compared with the Soft Seal tip and the standard pipette tip<br>
is clear from a comparison of the curve 80 to the curves 70 and<br>
60 in Fig. 8.<br>
In Fig. 9, the relationship between the pipette tip<br><br>
insertion force and the distance traveled by a tip on an<br>
associated pipette tip mounting shaft is graphically depicted for<br>
250 ml LTS, Soft Seal and standard pipette tips. The curves 100<br>
and 110 depict the relationship between insertion force and the<br>
travel of the Soft Seal and standard pipetre rips on standard<br>
mounting shafts respectively- In this regard, the travel of Sofz<br>
Seal and standard pipette tips is limited by the pipette tip<br>
ejection mechanism engaging the pipette tip as depicted by points<br>
102 and 112 respectively. The curve 90 depicrs the relationship<br>
between insertion force and LTS pipette tip travel on an LTS<br>
mounting shaft. The travel of the LTS pipette tip is limited by<br>
the previously referred to shoulder engaging the LTS tip as<br>
depicted by point 92 on curve 90. The substantial increase in<br>
tip travel per unit of insertion force associated with the LTS<br>
pipette tip of the present invention when compared to the Soft<br>
Seal and the standard pipette tip is clear from a comparison of<br>
curves 90, 100 and 110 in Fig. 9.<br>
In Pig. 10, the relation between the pipette tip insertion<br>
force and the lateral stability of a pipette tip on its<br>
associated shaft is graphically depicted for 250 microliter LTS,<br>
Soft Seal, and standard pipette tips. For the standard and Soft<br>
Seal pipette tips, the axial location of the pipette tip on the<br>
standard pipette tip mounting shaft is the point where the<br>
pipette forms a air tight seal with the mounting shaft and is<br>
near or against the bottom of the pipette tip ejection mechanism<br><br>
for the associated pipette. For the LTS pipette tip, the axial<br>
location of the tip is defined by the previously referred to<br>
shoulder. Each pipette tip was tested for stability by "touching<br>
off" the pipette tip during normal pipette use. That is, upon<br>
aspirating a volume of liquid into the distal of the pipette tip,<br>
the pipette is moved to a receptacle where the distal end of the<br>
tip is placed at an incline against the side of the receptacle<br>
and at least a portion of the aspirated volume of liquid is<br>
dispensed by operation of the pipette. During such a positioning<br>
of the pipette tip, the distal end is touching the side of the<br>
receptacle (e.g. "touching off"). During that time, lateral<br>
forces are exerted on the distal end of the pipette tip which<br>
tend to rock the tip on its mounting shaft. The number of cycles<br>
of "touching off" required to dislodge the pipette tip from its<br>
associated mounting shaft for different insertion forces is<br>
depicted in Fig. 10. The curve 120 depicts the relationship of<br>
insertion force to lateral stability for a standard pipette tip<br>
while curve 130 depicts the relationship for a Soft Seal pipette<br>
tip. The curve 140 depicts the relationship of insertion force<br>
to lateral stability for the LTS tip of the present invention.<br>
From Fig. 10 it is to be noted that the lateral stability of the<br>
LTS tip is substantially constant at above 50 cycles of "touching<br>
off" before the LTS tip dislodges from its associated mounting<br>
shaft. This uniform stability extends from an insertion force of<br>
approximately 1 pound. For the standard pipette tip and Soft.<br><br>
Seal tip, lateral stabilities approaching that of the LTS pipette<br>
tip are only achieved with insertion forces apDroaching or<br>
exceeding 15 pounds. For more normal insertion forces of about<br>
10 pounds, the standard and Soft Seal pipette tips dislodge from<br>
their associated mounting -shafts at about. 25 cycles cf "touching<br>
off". Thus, Fig. 10 clearly depicts the improved lateral<br>
stability for the LTS pipette tip on its associated mounting<br>
shaft when compared with standard and Soft Seal pipette tips of<br>
comparable volume.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the structure of the pipetta tip<br>
and mounting shaft ..combination of the present invention is<br>
depicted in Fig. 2 and shown in enlarged detail in Fig. 4. As<br>
there illustrated, the mounting shaft 32 comprises an axially<br>
elongated body including a distal end 34 and annular or a<br>
substantially cylindrical and axially spaced outer surface<br>
regions defining an annular sealing zone 36 adjacent the distal<br>
end 34 and an annular lateral support zone 38 on the distal end<br>
34 near the end of the shaft 32. The pipette tip is represented<br>
by the numeral 40 and is an elongated plastic tube comprising an<br>
open proximal end 42, an open conical distal end 44 and annular<br>
or substantially cylindrical and axially spaced inner surface-<br>
regions defining an annular sealing region 46 and an annular<br>
lateral support region 48 for mating with the sealing and support<br>
zones 36 and 38 respectively, on the mounting shaft 32. As used<br>
herein, "substantially cylindrical" means an annular surface<br><br>
having an axial taper of one and one-half degrees or less.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates in enlarged detail a preferred embodiment<br>
of the sealing region 46 and comprises the portion of the pipette<br>
tip 40 of Fig. 2 within the circle 3. As shown, the sealing<br>
region. 46 is formed by an inwardly extending substantially V-<br>
shaped bead 49 extending radially inward from the sidewall 50 of<br>
the pipette tip 40. The innermost surface of the bead 49 forms<br>
a very narrow annular sealing band or line for engaging the<br>
substantially cylindrical sealing zone 36 of the pipette tip<br>
mounting shaft 32 to form the previously described air-tight seal<br>
between the tip and mounting shaft.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the outer diameter of the annular<br>
sealing zone 36 is slightly greater than the inner diameter of<br>
the annular sealing region 46 on the pipette tip 40 and the<br>
sidewall 50 of the tip in the area of the annular sealing region<br>
46 is sufficiently thin that the annular sealing region expands<br>
slightly to form an interference fit and air tight seal between<br>
the mounting shaft 32 and the pipette tip 40 when the sealing<br>
zone 36 penetrates the sealing region 46. In practice, it has<br>
been found that the desired interference fit is formed when the<br>
difference in the outer diameter of the annular sealing zone and<br>
the inner diameter of the annular sealing region is at least .075<br>
millimeters (mm). further, it has been found that in practice<br>
that the wall thickness of the pipette tip in the area of the<br>
sealing region 46 is preferably between .20 and .50 mm.<br><br>
As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 4, the axial spacing of the<br>
sealing and support zones is substantially equal to the axial<br>
spacing of the sealing and support regions- Also, the outer<br>
diameter of the lateral support zone 38 is slightly less than or<br>
substantially equal to the inner diameter of the lateral support:<br>
region over at least some portion of the circumference of the<br>
support zone. This allows for some minimal contact between the •<br>
support zone and region without creating a secondary air tight<br>
seal which would result in an undesired increase in the axial<br>
forces required to mount and eject the pipette tip on and from<br>
the shaft. With such a structural configuration, as the sealing<br>
zone 36 penetrates the sealing region 46, the support region 48<br>
receives the support zone 38 and provides lateral support<br>
therefor which prevents transverse rocking of the pipette tip 40<br>
on the mounting shaft 32 as might otherwise occur during<br>
"touching off" of the pipette tip and an accompanying undesired<br>
dislodging of the tip from the shaft. In these regards, it is<br>
preferred that the axial spacing of the mating lateral support<br>
zone 38 and region 48 from the sealing zone and region 36,46 is<br>
substantially equal to the inner diameter of the pipette tip 40<br>
in the support region. Such a length relationship provides<br>
excellent lateral stability for the pipette tip 40 on the<br>
mounting shaft 32.<br>
Further, as illustrated- in Figs. 2 and 4, the present<br>
invention includes cooperative means 52 on the pipette of the<br><br>
present invention and the pipette tip 40 for limiting the axial<br>
travel of the tip on the mounting shaft 32. This insures uniform<br>
depth of mounting shaft penetration into the pipette tip to<br>
maintain uniform tip interference with the mounting shaft as<br>
successive tips are mounted on and ejected from the mounting<br>
shaft. In the embodiment illustrated in Figs. 2 and 4, such<br>
cooperative means 52 comprises an annular, upwardly facing,<br>
inwardly directed shoulder 53 on the inner surface of the pipette<br>
tip 40 immediately adjacent the lateral support region 48. The<br>
shoulder 53 is designed such that an upper surface thereof<br>
engages a downwardly facing surface such as the bottom 54 of the<br>
distal end 34 of the mounting shaft 32 at an outer<br>
circumferential portion thereof<br>
Alternate embodiments of the cooperative means 52 are<br>
depicted in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. In Fig. 5, the cooperative means<br>
52 comprises an outwardly directed downwardly facing annular<br>
shoulder 53' on the pipette tip mounting shaft 32 which upon<br>
insertion of the shaft into the open proximal 42 of the tip<br>
engages the upper annular edge 56 of the tip to halt further<br>
penetration of the shaft into the tip. In Fig. 6, the<br>
cooperative means 52 is depicted as comprising a bottom 58 of the<br>
sleeve 28 of the pipette tip ejector mechanism 26 illustrated and<br>
described with respect to Fig. 1. When the bottom surface 58<br>
engages the upper annular edge 56 of the pipette tip 40, further<br>
penetration of the mounting shaft 32 into the pipette is halted.<br><br>
While in the foregoing, particular preferred embodiments of<br>
the pipette tip of the present invention have been described and<br>
illustrated in detail, changes and modifications may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For<br>
example, Fig. 7 depicts an alternate embodiment cf the present<br>
invention which include the cooperative means 52 as depicted in<br>
Figs. 2 and 4. In addition to the structure of Figs. 2 and 4,<br>
the embodiment of Fig. 7 includes an elongated substantially<br>
cylindrical extension 62 from the bottom cf the distal end<br>
portion 34 of the mounting shaft 32. The extension 62 is coaxial<br>
with the mounting shaft and includes an outer sidewall 63 spaced<br>
from the inner surface of the pipette tip 40. The extension 62<br>
functions to decrease the air volume captured in the pipette of<br>
the present invention and reduces the air volume effects commonly<br>
associated with air displacement pipettes.<br>
Further, Figs. 11, 12 and 13 depict alternative embodiments<br>
of the present invention where the sealing zone 36 and region 46<br>
and the support zone 46 and region 48 are axially reversed from<br>
the locations illustrated in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 respectively. As<br>
shown in Figs. 11, the sealing zone 36 and region 46 are adjacent<br>
the cooperative means 52 while the support zone 38 and region 48<br>
are remote from the cooperative means 52. In Figs. 12 and 13,<br>
the sealing zone 36 and region 46 are adjacent the cooperative<br>
means 52 and the support zone 38 and region 48 are remote form<br>
the cooperative means 52.<br><br>
Still further, Figs. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 resemble<br>
Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12 and 13 respectively and show alternative<br>
embodiments of the present invention where there is a small<br>
interference fit between the lateral support region 4 8 and<br>
support zone 38 to further enhance the lateral stability of the<br>
tip 40 on the shaft 32 without introducing an undesired increase<br>
in the axial forces required to mount and eject the tip from the<br>
shaft. In this regard, and as illustrated in each of Figs. 14-<br>
20, it has been discovered that for pipette tip and shaft<br>
combinations wherein the interference fit between the sealing<br>
zone 36 and region 46 is about .075 mm to about .2 mm and the<br>
wall thickness of the pipette tip in the sealing region 46 and in<br>
the lateral support region 48 is between .2 and .5 mm, the<br>
lateral stability of the tip 40 on the shaft 32 can be further<br>
enhanced while maintaining the desired minimal tip mounting and<br>
ejection forces associated with the present invention when their<br>
is a small interference fit between the support region and zone.<br>
The small interference is provided by the lateral support region<br>
48 of the tip 40 having an inner diameter which is slightly less<br>
than the outer diameter of the lateral support zone 38 of the<br>
shaft 32, eg. less than .075 mm. Further, when the shaft 32 and<br>
tip 40 are concentric and substantially circular in the support<br>
zone 38 and region 48, a secondary air tight seal may be created<br>
between the support zone and region without creating an undesired<br>
increase in the axial forces required to mount and eject the tip<br><br>
