				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to gear sets, and particular to an<br>
integrally formed gear set with a plurality of gears.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The prior-art gear sets an- used in bicycle. Figs. 1, 2, and 3 shows a<br>
prior art structure. The gear set 10 includes a first gear 1 1, a second gear<br>
12, and a third gear 13. Each gear 11, 12 and 13 is punched with a<br>
plurality of teeth 24, a plura ity of recess portions 25 and a plurality of<br>
rivet holes 16. Then sleeves 17 and rivets 18 serve to rivet the first,<br>
second and third gears 11,12 and 1 3. The first gear 11 has a via hole 110<br>
and the second gear 12 has an assembled hole 120 for assembling the<br>
treading sheet 19 of the pedal. The prior art has the following<br>
disadvantages.	(1) Each gear is formed individually and then the<br>
sleeves 17 and rivets 18 are assembled. The assemblec work is tedious<br>
and complicated so that the cost is high. The combination of sleeves 17<br>
and rivets are loose so that after a long time, the gears will loose. The<br>
connection of rivets 18 are point connections so that the combination of<br>
gears is not firmly. Gaps ai e formed between gears so that a released<br>
chain will fall into the gap. Ml the actions are applied upon the teeth 14<br>
and the concave portions 15. The gear is easily worn.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the primary object of the present invention is to provide<br>
an integrally formed gear set with a plurality of gears comprises a first, a<br>
second and a third gear. Each gear has a plurality of teeth and a plurality<br>
of recess portions. The teeth and recess portions are alternatively<br>
arranged. The first, second and third gears are formed by a sheet which<br>
is firstly formed as a stepped structure containing three layers which are<br>
the first gear, second gear and third gears. The rings between two gears<br>
are stripped with a plurality of teeth which are bent to be at the same plane<br>
of the second and third gears. The portions of the rings un-stripped are<br>
remained as concave portions.<br>
The various objects and advantages of the present invention will be<br>
more readily understood from the following detailed description when read<br>
in conjunction with the appended drawing.<br>

Fig. 2 is an assembled perspective view of the prior art.<br>
Fig. 3 is an assembled cross section view of the prior art.<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross section view showing that the present invention is<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order that those skilled in the art can further understand the present<br>
invention, a description will be described in the following in details.<br>
However, these descriptions and the appended drawings are only used to<br>
cause those skilled in the art to understand the objects, features, and<br>
characteristics of the present invention, but not to be used to confine the<br>
scope and spirit or the presen invention defined in the description.<br>
With reference to Figs. 4 and 5, a gear set 20 of the present invention<br>
includes a first gear 21, a second gear 22 and a third gear 23. Each of<br>
the first gear 21, second gear 22 and third gear 23 is formed with a<br>
plurality of teeth 24 and a plurality of recess portions 25. The diameter<br>
of the second gear 22 is smaller than that of the first gear 21 and the<br>
diameter of the third gear 23 i.; smaller than that of the second gear 22.<br>
The teeth 24 and recess portions 25 are alternatively arranged. Each<br>
gear surface of the second gear 22 and third gear 23 is vertically extended<br>
with protruding rings. The orotruding ring is formed by a plurality of<br>
connecting sheets 26 . and a plurality of concave portions 27. Each<br>
connecting sheet 26 is vertically extended from a respective recess portion<br>
25. The concave portion 27 is between two adjacent two recess portions<br>
25. The third gear 23 has an assembling hole 230 at a center thereof.<br>
The first, second and third gears are formed by a sheet which is firstly-<br>
formed as a stepped structure containing three layers which are the first<br>
gear 21, second gear 22 and third gears 23. The rings between two gears<br>
are stripped with a plurality of teeth 24 which are bent to be at the same<br><br>
plane of the second and third gears 22 and 23. The portions of the rings<br>
un-stripped are remained as the concave portions 27.<br>
In the present invention, the assembling hole 230 serves to assembly a<br>
rod (for example, a pedal rod of a bicycle).<br>
In manufacturing of the present invention, the punching and forging<br>
manufacturing process can be used. A sheet is firstly punched (or forged)<br>
to has a three layer stepped structure including a first, a second and a third<br>
layers. Then, the rings between two gears are stripped with a plurality of<br>
teeth 24 which are bent to be at the same plane of the second and third<br>
gears 22 and 23. The portions of the rings un-stripped are remained as<br>
the concave portions 27. Thereby, the three gears 21, 22 and 23 are<br>
formed as an integrally structure.<br>
Other than manufactur ng by punching and forging, other<br>
manufacturing process is allowable. For example, the present invention<br>
is made by molding.<br>
In above embodiment, the structure of the present invention has three<br>
layers, however, the same structure with layers with numbers other than 3<br>
can be used, such as two cr four gears are formed at the structure<br>
integrally. Advantages of the present invention will be described herein.<br>
Firstly, since the gears 21, 22 and 23 are formed integrally so that the<br>
connection is very firmly and thus the structure is strong. It is difficult<br>
to deform the gear set of the present invention. Secondly, when a chain<br>
28 is engaged to the gear set 20 of the present invention, since one lateral<br>
edge of the chain 28 is in comact with the rings between two gears, some<br>
force of the chain is applied to the connecting sheets 26 so that the teeth<br><br>
26 and the concave portions 27 are uneasy to wear. When the chain 28 is<br>
released, it will be hindered by the connecting sheets 26. Thereby, the<br>
chain 28 can be taken out easily. Furthermore, the gears 21, 22 and 23<br>
are formed integrally so that t is impossible that any one of the gears 21,<br>
22 and 23 shifts or displaces.<br>
The present invention is thus described, it will be obvious that the<br>
same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded<br>
as a departure from the spirit and scope of the present invention, and all<br>
such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br>
