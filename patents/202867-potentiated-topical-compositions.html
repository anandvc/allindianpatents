POTENTIATED TOPICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
AMBRIA DERMATOLOGY AB<br>
a Swedish Company Of Kullagatan 8-10, S-252 20 Helsingborg, Sweden<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
POTENTIATED TOPICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to potentiated topical compositions, that is, topical compositions for cosmetic use or comprising a pharmacologically active agent, the cosmetic or pharmacological effect of which is potentiated by a carrier constituent which has little pharmacological effect per se.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The penetration of the skin by pharmacologically active agents contained in compositions for topical administration usually is slow and often too slow to be of practical value. The methods known in the art to enhance penetration frequently use adjuvants or mixtures of adjuvants to enhance absorption. However many of the more effective adjuvants irritate the skin or are toxic or smelly or stain the clothes they come into contact with.<br>
Pentane-1,5-diol is known to possess antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial activity, in particular antiviral activity against herpes simples virus (U.S. patent no. 5,369,129). Pentane-1,5-diol has been used as an adjuvant component in the transdermal administration of the antihypertensive drug prazosine (WO 93/03697) in combination with a sulfhydryl-containing compound and a fatty ester. U.S. patent no. 5,550,145 discloses an antimicrobial composition comprising a monoglyceride and 5% by weight of pentane-1,5-diol. U.S. patent no. 4,241,084 discloses an antibacterial and antifungal composition comprising a sulfonamide and an alkylene glycol containing from 5 to 8 carbon atoms and an alkylene<br><br>
glycol ester. WO 96/11572 discloses a antimicrobial composition comprising carboxylic acids of up to ten carbon atoms or their salts and C3-C10-diols. WO 93/20812 discloses an antimicrobial composition comprising a) monoglyceride of lauric acid, a monoglyceride of mono-myristic acid or their mixtures, an antibacterial substance and a diol with 3-6 carbon atoms. EP 0 884 045 Al discloses a self-tanning skin composition comprising a self-tanning skin coloring agent, a polyethoxyalcohol, a polyol and, optionally, a pentanediol. WO 98/27960 discloses a viscous hydrogel composition for topical administration comprising a microbially active nitro-imidazole drug, pentylene glycol and a hydroxyaikyl cellulose gelling agent and water, buffered to a physiologically acceptable pK. U.S. patent no. 5,879,690 discloses a composition for treatment of sagging subcutaneous muscle comprising an agent exhibiting or producing catecholamine activity and a carrier comprising skin penetration enhancer such as pentanediol. GB 2 280 111 A discloses clear gel antiperspirant compositions comprising an antiperspirant, pentanediol, a co-solvent of polyethylene glycol, water and/or glycerin, a buffering agent and a gelling agent.<br>
Propylene glycol is a hygroscopic iiqu-id widely used as a carrier in topical preparations. It is very hygroscopic and considered generally non-toxic (exception: ototoxicity) in contrast to ethylene glycol and hexylene-.1,6-glycol (for a review, see: Goldsmith, L A. Propylene glycol.   Int J Dermat 1978; 17:703-705).<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a composition for skin care which has improved properties in<br><br><br>
comparison to compositions known in the art, in particular compositions containing propane-1,2-diol as a carrier.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a composition for topical administration of a pharmaceuti-cally active agent which has improved properties in comparison to compositions known in the art, in particular compositions of this kind containing propane-1,2-diol.<br>
It is an additional object of the invention to provide a composition for skin care and for topical administration of a pharmaceutical, the composition having improved moisture retaining properties.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS EXAMPLE 1. Release of tiratricol.<br>
In this study the thyroid hormone compound tiratricol was used due to its pharmacological effect on a number of skin conditions such as ichthyosis, psoriasis, acne, corticosteroid atrophy, and skin scarring (WO 96/40048).<br>
Cream A   (prior art): 0.1 % by weight of powderous tiratricol was blended with 99.9 % by weight of Essex cream containing 10% by weight of pentane-1,5-diol.<br>
Cream B   (cream according to the invention): 0.1 % by weight of powderous tiratricol was blended with a mixture of 10 %   by weight of propane-1,2-diol and 89.9 % by weight of Essex® cream base (Schering Plough).<br>
Creams A and 3 were compared in respect of release of tiritricol in a multilayer membrane system for determining percutaneous absorption (Bronaught, R L and Stewart, R L, Methods  for in   vitro percutaneous  absorption studies   III.   Hydrophobic  compounds.   J Pharm Soc 1984; 73:1255-1258); Sronaught R L et al., Determination   of Percutaneous Absorption  by In  Vitro   Techniques) .

EXAMPLE 2.   In  vitro  water binding capacity of pentane-1,5-diol, propane-1,2-diol, and urea. The water binding capacity of pentane-1,5-diol, propane-1,2-diol, and urea was investigated in  vitro  using pieces of human stratum corneum from a volunteer (for the method, see: Swanbeck, G. A new  treatment  of ichthyosis  and other hyperkeratotic conditions.   Acta derm.-venerol. 48:123-127, 1968). They were cut into pieces of about 3x3x0.5 mm and used as such. The specimens were immersed for 12 hours in distilled water, aqueous pentane-1,5-diol (10% by weight), aqueous propane-1,2-diol (10% by weight) or aqueous urea (10% by weight). The specimens then were blotted on filter paper and placed in a moisture over a saturated sodium tartrate solution providing a relative humidity of about 85% at<br><br><br>
22°C. After 6 hrs the specimens were removed and weighed. Their water content at 6 h was obtained by subtracting the weight of the specimens dried for 24 hrs in a dry atmosphere at room temperature. The results are shown in Table 2. The water binding capacity after 6 hrs was 9% by weight for pentane-1,5-diol, 7% by weight for propane-1,2-diol, and 17% by weight for urea- An aqueous solution containing 20% of pentane-1,5-diol increased the water binding capacity to 13% by weight (water content 24%) .<br>
Table   2.   Effect   of  water   uptake   of   stratum  corneura  pieces   pre-incubated with   10%   (by  weight)   solutions   of  pentane-1,5-diol,   propane-1,2-diol,   and  urea   after   6   hrs   of   incubation   in   an   atmosphere   with   a relative  humidity   of   85%   at   room  temperature.<br><br>
EXAMPLE   3.   Acute   toxicity  of  pentane-1,5-diol.<br>
(a)	Acute   toxicity was   tested  in Carworth-Wistar  male rats  weighing   from  90   to   120  gr.   The  orally administered  dose  was   logarithmically   increased  by  a factor  of   2.   The   diol   was   given  as   such  and  diluted in water,   oil   or   agar.   Mortality was   investigated over  a   fortnight  period;   LD5o  =   5.89  g/kg  body  weight.<br>
(b)	Penetration of  rabbit  skin  by pentane-1,5-diol   was tested with  a  cuff model.   The  hair  on  the  back  of four  male   rabbits  weighing   from  2.5   to   3.5   kg  was removed by  shaving,   the  diol   applied  to  the  skin,   and the  skin occluded with plastic  film  for 24  hrs.   The animals  were   immobilized during  the   test  period.<br><br><br>
After the exposure the animals were observed over a fortnight period for mortality which was found to be higher than 20 ml/kg, the highest dose tested, (c)  (c) Inhalation of pentane-1,5-diol. Six rats were made to breathe air saturated with the diol for a period of 8 hrs. None of the animals died.<br>
EXAMPLE 4. Skin and eye irritation tests.<br>
(a)	The shaved skin of 5 albino rabbits was exposed to pentane-1,5-dioi for 24 hours and the effect assessed using scale graded 1 (no irritation) to 10 (maximum irritation). Consistently a score of 1 was obtained.<br>
(b)	Pentane-1,5-diol was administered to the eye (conjunctiva) of five albino rabbits. Only very mild irritation (score 2 on a 1-10 scale) was observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. Medical patch provided with composition A. A medical cotton patch (5 x 5 x ca. 1 cm) backed by perforated polyethylene on one side was provided with about 3 g of composition A on its front side and positioned against the skin of a volunteer (upper left arm) for a period of 24 hrs. Upon removal the skin seemed free from irritation.<br>
EXAMPLE 6. Water binding capacity of pentane-1,5-diol. Dry skin is a problem in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, ichtyosis and many other dermatological disorders. Urea or a combination of urea and sodium chloride in various formulations (creams, lotions, etc.) have been used for many years to treat dry skin. One important problem with these formulations is itching and burning when they are applied on eczematous skin.<br><br><br>
The aim of the present experiments was to evaluate the water binding capacity of pentane-1,5-diol in vitro,   and to compare it with that of urea.<br>
Pieces of stratum corneum from the sole of 7 healthy volunteers were used. They were cut into pieces of about 3 x 3 x 0.5 mm and used as such.  The specimens were immersed for 12 hours in distilled water, aqueous pentane-1,5-diol (20 % by weight), and aqueous urea (10 % by weight). Thereafter the specimens were blotted on filter paper and placed in a moist chamber with a saturated sodium tartrate salt solution giving a relative humidity, in the chamber, of about 85 %. The specimens were removed after 24 hours for weighing. The water content (WC) of the specimens at 24 hours was obtained by subtracting the weight of the specimen after drying for 24 hours in a dry atmosphere at: room temperature.<br>
The results are listed in Table 3. The water binding capacity was estimated by subtracting the WC for stratum corneum incubated with distilled water for 24 hours from the WC for the stratum corneum pieces incubated with the test substances for 24 hours. The water binding capacity after 24 hours was 23 % (mean) for pentane-1,5-diol ar.d 16 % (mean) for urea. Thus, with the water binding composition of the invention containing 20 % by weight of pentane-1,5-diol, a better water retaining effect was obtained than with an aqueous composition containing 10 % by weight of urea. While the latter composition hoes give rise to itching when applied to edematous skin, this negative effect is not encountered with the composition according to the invention.<br><br><br>
Table 3- Effect on uptake of water in pieces of stratum corneum pre-incubated with a 20 % solution (in distilled water) of pentan-1,5-diol and a 10 % solution (in distilled water) of urea and distilled water, as a control, after 24 hours of incubation in an atmosphere with a relative humidity of 85 %.<br>
