				<td>Process for the simultaneous recording and<br>
reading of a digital audio and video data stream,<br>
and receiver for implementing the process<br>
The invention relates to a process for the simultaneous<br>
recording and reading of an audio and video data stream, in particular of<br>
data compressed according to the MPEG II standard, on a recording<br>
medium furnished with a reading and recording head. The invention also<br>
relates to a digital television receiver implementing the process.<br>
When one wishes to record sequential data on a medium<br>
furnished with a head responsible both for the reading and recording of the<br>
data, the time required for this head to make a jump from one recording<br>
logic unit (block) of the medium to another unit might not be negligible. The<br>
time of movement of a head of a commercially available hard disk may for<br>
example be of the order of 10 to 12 ms. In particular in the case of the<br>
recording of compressed audio and video data requiring a minimum<br>
throughput, it may be necessary to limit the number of jumps made by a<br>
head so as to avoid the drying up of the buffer memory used for decoding<br>
this data.<br>
The inventors have in particular observed that this problem<br>
could become manifest if one wishes to read a data stream in non-real-<br>
time, whilst the recording of this stream is continued during the reading of<br>
the data previously recorded.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to propose a recording process<br>
which avoids unnecessary jumps of the reading and recording head.<br>
The subject of the invention is a process for recording a digital<br>
video and audio data stream characterized in that, recording being carried<br>
out on a medium organized in the form of logic blocks in series and<br>
comprising a recording and reading head, said process comprises the<br>
steps:<br>
of recording data in one block out of two starting from a first<br>
block,<br>
following the triggering of the reading of the data, alternately of<br>
reading a previously recorded block and of continuing the<br>
recording in the block following the block read.<br>
During writing without reading, a single jump of the head is<br>
performed. During reading while continuing recording, no jump is<br>
performed: the reading head reads a block and records in the immediately<br>
following block. Thus, the number of jumps is reduced effectively.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, when the set of blocks<br>
recorded before the triggering of reading have been read, recording is<br>
continued in contiguous blocks in a non-interlaced manner.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, when the set of blocks<br>
recorded before the triggering of reading have been read, recording is<br>
continued in a loop in the blocks previously read.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the recording of data is<br>
performed in a group of N contiguous blocks (N &gt; 1) out of two instead of a<br>
single block out of two.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, said process furthermore<br>
comprises the additional step of detecting sequences of free blocks on the<br>
medium and of applying steps of recording and of reading inside such<br>
sequences.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a digital television receiver<br>
comprising means for receiving a digital audio and video data stream,<br>
characterized in that it comprises:<br>
- a recording medium furnished with a recording and reading head,<br>
said medium being organized in the form of logic blocks in series;<br>
- a control circuit for managing the writing and the reading of<br>
blocks of the recording medium;<br>
an interfacing circuit for interfacing the recording medium with<br>
said control circuit, said control circuit initially instructing the<br>
recording of data in one block out of two starting from a first<br>
block and subsequently, following the triggering of the reading<br>
of the data, alternately the reading of a block previously<br>
recorded and the continuing of the recording in the block<br>
following a block read.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the control circuit<br>
instructs the recording of data in a group of N contiguous blocks (N &gt; 1)<br>
out of two instead of a single block out of two.<br>

Although the description hereinbelow relates especially to the<br>
recording of demultiplexed audio and video PES packets, the invention can<br>
easily be applied to the direct recording of transport stream (TS) or<br>
program (PS) packets or else of other types of steams, for example of<br>
Digital Video (DV) type.<br>
According to the present exemplary embodiment, the storage<br>
device is a hard disk built into a digital television decoder meeting the DVB<br>
standard.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of such a decoder. The latter<br>
comprises a tuner 101 linked to a demodulation and error correction circuit<br>
102 which also comprises an analog/digital converter for digitizing the<br>
signals originating from the tuner. Depending on the type of reception,<br>
cable or satellite, the modulation used is of QAM or QPSK type, and the<br>
circuit 102 comprises the demodulation means appropriate for the type of<br>
reception. The demodulated and corrected data are serialized by a<br>
converter 103, connected to a serial input of a demultiplexing and<br>
decoding circuit 104.<br>
According to the present example, this circuit 104 is an STi5500<br>
circuit manufactured by ST Microelectronics. The latter comprises, linked<br>
to a central 32-bit parallel bus 105, a DVB demultiplexer 106, a<br>
microprocessor 107, a cache memory 108, an external memory interface<br>
109, a serial communication interface 110, a parallel input/output interface<br>
111, a chip card interface 112, an audio and video MPEG decoder 113, a<br>
PAL and RGB encoder 114 and a character generator 115.<br>
The external memory interface 109 is linked to a 16-bit parallel<br>
bus to which are respectively linked a parallel interface 116 of IEEE 1284<br>
type, a random access memory 117, a "Flash" memory 118 and a hard<br>
disk 119. The latter is of EIDE type for the requirements of the present<br>
example. The parallel interface 116 is also connected to an external<br>
connector 120 and to a modem 121, the latter being linked to an external<br>
connector 122.<br>
The serial communication interface 110 is linked to an external<br>
connector 123, as well as to the output of an infrared reception<br>
subassembly 124 intended to receive signals from a remote control (not<br>
illustrated). The infrared reception subassembly is integrated into a front<br>
panel of the decoder, which also comprises a display device and control<br>
buttons.<br>
The chip card interface 112 is linked to a chip card connector<br>
125.<br>
The audio and video decoder 113 is linked to a 16-Mbit random<br>
access memory 126 intended for storing the nondecoded audio and video<br>
packets. The decoder transmits the decoded video data to the PAL and<br>
RGB encoder 114 and the decoded audio data to a digital/analog<br>
converter 127. The encoder supplies the RGB signals to an SECAM<br>
encoder 132, and also provides a video signal in the form of a luminance<br>
component Y and of a chrominance component C, these two components<br>
being separated. These various signals are multiplexed through a<br>
switching circuit 128 to an audio output 129, television output 130 and<br>
video recorder output 131.<br>
The route taken by the audio and video data through the<br>
decoder is as follows: the demodulated datastream possesses a transport<br>
stream format or more simply a "TS" format with reference to the MPEG II<br>
Systems standard. This standard possesses the reference<br>
ISO/IEC 13818-1. In their header, the TS packets comprise identifiers<br>
called- PIDs which indicate the elementary stream to which the useful data<br>
of the packet pertain. Typically, an elementary stream is a video stream<br>
associated with a particular program, whereas an audio stream of this<br>
program is another one. The data structure used to transport the<br>
compressed audio and video data is referred to as an elementary stream<br>
packet or else "PES" packet.<br>
The demultiplexer 106 is programmed by the microprocessor<br>
107 so as to extract from the transport stream the packets corresponding<br>
to certain values of PID. The useful data of a demultiplexed packet are, as<br>
appropriate, descrambled (if the rights stored by a chip card of the user<br>
authorize this descrambling), before storing these data in buffer areas of<br>
the various memories of the decoder. The buffer areas reserved for the<br>
audio and video PES packets are situated in the memory 126. The<br>
decoder 113 reads back these audio and video data depending on its<br>
needs, and transmits the decompressed audio and video samples to the<br>
encoder 114 and to the converter 127 respectively.<br>
Certain of the circuits mentioned above are controlled in a<br>
known manner, for example through a bus of I2C type.<br>
The typical case described hereinabove corresponds to the<br>
direct decoding of a demultiplexed program by the MPEG decoder 113.<br>
According to the invention, the receiver/ decoder comprises a<br>
hard disk for the mass storage mainly of audio and video data in their<br>
compressed form.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of the assembly 119 comprising the<br>
hard disk and the interfacing circuits linking it to the external memory<br>
interface 109.<br>
The hard disk 201 is a commercial hard disk furnished with an<br>
Ultra ATA/EIDE interface. "ATA" designates the communication protocol,<br>
known elsewhere, of the specific disk used within the framework of the<br>
present example. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the<br>
disk comprises a double file system. Two file systems; associated with<br>
respective data areas are used in parallel to read and write data from and<br>
to the disk, the first file system being adapted to the writing and to the<br>
reading of data of computer file, program, code type, etc. referred to<br>
hereinbelow as the "block" file system, whilst the second file system is<br>
intended for the writing and for the reading of audio and video streams, this<br>
file system being referred to hereinbelow as the "stream" file system.<br>
This duality is also found at the level of the architecture of the<br>
interface circuits of figure 2.<br>
The writing and reading of data blocks are performed by way of<br>
respectively a memory of first-in-first-out (FIFO) type 202 for writing and of<br>
a memory 203 of the same type for reading. The two FIFO memories have<br>
a respective size of 16 bytes and are controlled by a block transfer circuit<br>
204 which manages the address pointers for these two FIFO memories.<br>
According to the present exemplary embodiment, these are double<br>
synchronous port type memories.<br>
The data exchanges according to the "block" mode are carried<br>
out in direct memory access mode, by sending bursts of 16 bytes. These<br>
bursts are buffered both in write mode and in read mode by the two FIFO<br>
memories 202 and 203, which allow the adaptation of the disk bit rate to<br>
the bus bit rate 215 and vice versa.<br>
Two FIFO memories 205 and 206 are provided for respectively<br>
writing and reading the audio and video streams. Each FIFO memory 205<br>
and 206 comprises, according to the present exemplary embodiment, a<br>
physical memory of 512 Kbytes, divided up into four video banks of 112<br>
Kbytes (clustered into a "video" area, referenced 205a, respectively 206a)<br>
and an audio area of 64 Kbytes (referenced 205b, respectively 206b), and<br>
is controlled by a stream transfer control circuit 207. Each video bank and<br>
audio area is managed as a first-in-first-out (FIFO) memory. The circuit 207<br>
manages two write pointers and two read pointers which are independent<br>
for each of the series 205 and 206, namely a pair of video pointers and a<br>
pair of audio pointers. A single memory 205 and 206 is active in read mode<br>
and a single is active in write mode at a given moment. Access to the two<br>
memories 205 and 206 is however independent, allowing so-called<br>
simultaneous reading and writing from and to the disk.<br>
According to a variant of the present exemplary embodiment,<br>
the memories 202, 203, 205 and 206 are areas of the random access<br>
memory 117, each of these areas being managed as one, or if appropriate<br>
several, memory (memories) of the first-in-first-out type.<br>
Moreover, an adaptation of the present exemplary embodiment<br>
to the management of additional components, such as for example several<br>
elementary audio streams, would be easily achievable by the person<br>
skilled in the art, by providing the additional memories required for this<br>
purpose.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to record TS stream packets<br>
directly, without having to extract the PES packets therefrom. In this case,<br>
the nature (audio, video or other) of the content of the packets recorded is<br>
of no concern and the demultiplexed TS packets are recorded in blocks of<br>
128 Kb, that is to say by continuously managing the 112 and the 16 Kb. In<br>
this particular case, therefore, there is no reframing depending on the<br>
nature of the elementary packets contained in the TS packets, unlike what<br>
is done when recording the PES packets rid of the transport layer.<br>
The two transfer control circuits 204 and 207 are state<br>
machines whose operation is controlled by the microprocessor 107. The<br>
microprocessor tells the controllers the transfer tasks to be performed in<br>
direct memory access mode (the mode referred to hereinafter as the<br>
"UDMA" or Ultra Direct Memory Access mode), and is forewarned of the<br>
accomplishing of these tasks through an interrupt generated by an<br>
interrupt control circuit 208 linked to the two transfer control circuits 204<br>
and 207. Within the framework of the example described here, use is<br>
made of the 33 Mbyte/s UDMA mode, but the invention is obviously not<br>
limited to this mode.<br>
The two transfer control circuits manage disk access proper<br>
through a control circuit 209 which allows implementation of the disk and<br>
its mode of access, namely access to the command and control registers<br>
and direct UDMA memory access. The command circuit is also linked to<br>
the microprocessor 107, for the direct management of the control and<br>
command registers of the disk, this not implementing the transfer control<br>
circuits 204 and 207.<br>
The interfacing circuit of figure 2 furthermore comprises two<br>
multiplexers 210 and 211, which receive as input respectively the three<br>
input paths for the data, that is to say the data to be written to the disk, and<br>
the three output paths for the data, that is to say for the data read from the<br>
disk. Each multiplexer therefore possesses at input three 16-bit buses and<br>
one 16-bit bus at output The switching between the various paths is<br>
managed by the microprocessor 107.<br>
As far as the writing multiplexer 210 is concerned, the first input<br>
path consists of a direct access of the data bus 215 of the external<br>
memory interface 109 to the data bus 212 of the disk 201, the second path<br>
consists of the output of the FIFO memory 202 for the writing of blocks,<br>
whilst the third path consists of the output of the FIFO memory 205, for the<br>
writing of the streams.<br>
As far as the reading multiplexer 211 is concerned, the first<br>
output path consists of a direct access of the data bus of the disk to the<br>
data bus of the external memory interface 109, whilst the second path<br>
consists of the output of the memory 203 for the reading of blocks, and the<br>
third path of the output of the FIFO memory 206, for the reading of<br>
streams.<br>
The respective outputs of the two multiplexers 210 and 211 are<br>
connected respectively to the data bus of the disk and to the data bus of<br>
the external memory interface across three-state output stages 213 and<br>
214, controlled by the automata 204 and 207.<br>
Each memory 205 and 206 serves as cache memory for the<br>
data heading for the disk or coming from it. The disk according to the<br>
present exemplary embodiment comprises sectors of 512 bytes. The<br>
content of 256 sectors therefore corresponds to the size of a video<br>
memory bank of a FIFO memory of one of the memories 205a and 206a,<br>
plus a quarter of the size of one of the audio areas 205b and 206b, namely<br>
a total of 128 Kbytes. This is substantially the quantity of data transferable<br>
from or to the disk during the mean time of movement of a reading head of<br>
the disk used in the present example, namely around 10 ms.<br>
The use of FIFO memories having the characteristics defined<br>
hereinabove has made it possible to obtain simultaneous reading and<br>
writing bit rates of 15 Mbit/s.<br>
The writing of an audio/video stream to the disk will be<br>
described in conjunction with figures 3 and 4.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the splitting of the PES format audio and<br>
video data in accordance with the MPEG II standard to two FIFO<br>
memories, namely a video bank (one of the banks of the part 205a of the<br>
memory 205) and an audio area (part 205b of the memory 205).<br>
The data are written to the disk in audio/video blocks of 128<br>
Kbytes each. According to the present invention, a fixed part of the block of<br>
128 Kbytes is reserved for video data (112 Kbytes) and another part, which<br>
is variable, for the audio data (16 Kbytes maximum). The blocks being<br>
written sequentially, the audio and video data are therefore interleaved on<br>
the disk.<br>
It has been found that the ratio of the minimum bit rate of a<br>
video stream to the maximum bit rate of an audio stream is around 10. By<br>
defining in a block of 128 Kbytes an area of 112 Kbytes reserved for video<br>
and of 16 Kbytes for audio, the ratio is 7. Stated otherwise, by taking into<br>
consideration an audio/video stream whose video data (in the form of<br>
video PES packets) are stored as soon as they are multiplexed in the area<br>
of 142 Kbytes and whose audio data (in the form of audio PES packets) in<br>
the area of 16 Kbytes, the video area will always be filled before the audio<br>
area.<br>
It is obvious that, depending on the streams and the bit rates to<br>
be managed, ratios other than 7 may also be used. This is the case in<br>
particular if compression algorithms other than those advocated by the<br>
MPEG standard are implemented.<br>
When the video bank of 112 Kbytes is filled, the content of this<br>
bank is written to the disk, followed by the audio data accumulated during<br>
the same time as the 112 Kbytes of video data, this being irrespective of<br>
the state of fill of the audio area. By construction, one nevertheless knows<br>
that fewer than 16 Kbytes have been accumulated.<br>
In this context, there is no correlation between the limits of the<br>
PES packets and the start or the end of a video bank or of the audio data<br>
accumulated. The first data of the content of a video bank may in fact fall in<br>
the middle of a video PES packet, whilst the last audio data items<br>
accumulated do not necessarily correspond to the end of an audio PES<br>
packet.<br>
It will be assumed that the measures required for opening a file<br>
for writing a stream have been taken beforehand at the disk file system<br>
level.<br>
Appended to the video and audio data are an identifier of the<br>
file to which the block of the disk belongs and a data item indicating the<br>
quantity of audio data, which is derived from the state of the write pointer<br>
of the audio area 205b of the memory 205 at the time the limit of fill of the<br>
video bank is reached. The identifier is coded on 16 bits, whilst the quantity<br>
of audio data is coded on 14 bits. Figure 4 illustrates the layout of the data<br>
in a block on the disk. Part of the audio area of the block not containing<br>
any audio data is filled with stuffing bits so as to make these data up to 16<br>
Kbytes.<br>
In the case of the recording of TS packets, it is obviously not<br>
necessary to indicate a quantity of audio data.<br>
The file identifier is the same for all the blocks belonging to the<br>
same file. The identifier of a file is information which is redundant to that<br>
contained in a data structure referred to as a node and associated with<br>
each file. The identifier is however used if a write-open file has not been<br>
correctly closed: the file system then identifies all the blocks belonging to<br>
one and the same file by virtue of the file identifier and updates the<br>
corresponding parameters in the node of the file and in the other data<br>
structures recorded at the start of the part of the disk reserved for the<br>
"stream" file system. The receiver knows the identifier of the open file since<br>
the latter is written in a flag on the disk (at node number 0) at the start of<br>
each file opening, this flag being reset to zero upon the closure of this file.<br>
It is apparent that the aligning of the audio data with the video<br>
data brings about the nonuse of a variable part of the 16-Kbyte audio area<br>
of a block of the disk. However, the size of this unused part is relatively<br>
small compared with the 128 Kbytes of the complete block. If the recording<br>
of the video and audio packets were performed in the order of<br>
demultiplexing of the PES packets, then the recording of the nature of<br>
each packet (audio or video, for example in the form of a PID identifier)<br>
would have been necessary. The room required for this recording would<br>
have been on the one hand greater than that reserved for the stuffing bits<br>
in the audio part of the recorded blocks and on the other hand more<br>
complex to manage.<br>
The advantages of aligning the audio data with the video data<br>
are however considerable. Specifically, even if the audio and video data<br>
are not multiplexed in the same way as in the incoming audio/video<br>
stream, the synchronism between audio and video data is maintained<br>
overall. The audio data in a block are in fact those having been received<br>
temporally multiplexed with the video data of the same block. It is thus<br>
possible to restore an audio/video stream at the decoder without any drift<br>
in synchronism which could cause overflow of audio or video buffers during<br>
read back.<br>
Synchronism is also maintained if the TS stream is recorded<br>
directly.<br>
The use of four video memory banks of 112 Kbytes each in<br>
read and/or write mode, as well as of an audio area of 64 Kbytes, makes it<br>
possible to compensate for the disk write head movement times and for<br>
any disk access problems which could delay writing. The microprocessor<br>
107 nevertheless attempts to keep the largest number of banks of the<br>
memory 205 empty, and this may be referred to as management of empty<br>
buffer type. To transfer the audio/video data to the disk, the<br>
microprocessor 107 triggers a direct memory access mechanism ("DMA")<br>
which performs the transfer of the audio/video data from the demultiplexer<br>
106 to a video bank and the audio area of the FIFO memory 205. Within<br>
the framework of the exemplary embodiment, this is a DMA built directly<br>
into the demultiplexer 106.<br>
When a video bank of the memory 205 is full, the write transfer<br>
control circuit 207 generates an interrupt destined for the microprocessor<br>
107, writing being continued in the next video FIFO memory bank. The<br>
video FIFO memory banks are implemented in rotation. The<br>
microprocessor, which also manages the disk file system, determines the<br>
first write sector of 512 bytes of the block of 128 Kbytes, and supplies it to<br>
the disk by way of the control circuit 209. The microprocessor also<br>
initializes the direct memory access mechanism at the disk for the transfer<br>
of data from the first video FIFO memory bank and the corresponding<br>
quantity of audio from the audio FIFO 205b of the memory 205. The disk<br>
then writes 128 Kbytes to 256 sectors under control of the circuit 207. After<br>
transferring the 128 Kbytes of data, the hard disk exits the Ultra DMA<br>
mode, the control circuit 207 frees the Ultra DMA mode and tells the<br>
microprocessor through an interrupt. This transfer is repeated each time<br>
the microprocessor receives an interrupt request by way of the control<br>
circuit 207 and until there is a decision to stop the recording. The<br>
microprocessor then updates the node corresponding to the file in which<br>
writing took place, as well as the corresponding bit tables. The role of the<br>
bit tables and of the node will be seen in greater detail hereinbelow.<br>
It should be noted that, according to the present exemplary<br>
embodiment, the audio area of each memory 205 and 206 is not organized<br>
as banks of fixed size, as is the case for the video banks of 112 Kbytes.<br>
The audio areas are managed by storing, in write mode, the quantity of<br>
audio data written for each associated video bank and, in read mode, by<br>
taking into account the information relating to the audio quantity read from<br>
each block.<br>
According to the present exemplary embodiment, only the PES<br>
data are recorded on the disk. This implies that the reference clock values<br>
("PCR") are not recorded. However, as already mentioned, it would also be<br>
conceivable to record packets of the TS transport layer.<br>
The reading mechanism differs substantially from the writing<br>
mechanism. We consider a reading initialization phase and a steady<br>
reading condition.<br>
To initialize reading in stream mode, the microprocessor sends<br>
the hard disk the address of the first sector of the first block to be<br>
transferred and requests the transfer of 256 sectors. Once the transfer is<br>
completed, the transfer control circuit 207 generates an interrupt to<br>
indicate the end of the transfer. The microprocessor then requests the<br>
transfer of the next block, and so on and so forth until four video FIFO<br>
memory banks of the block 206 (and a part of the audio area 206b) are<br>
filled. The transfer and the decoding of data to the decoder 113 are<br>
initialized only then by the microprocessor. Once initialization has been<br>
performed, the data are transferred without the intervention of the<br>
microprocessor: the decoder 113 reads the audio and video data as and<br>
when the requirements alter. The speed with which the FIFO memories are<br>
emptied depends in fact on the content of the compressed audio and video<br>
packets.<br>
The steady condition is as follows: when a memory bank of 112<br>
Kbytes of video FIFO is completely emptied (and the corresponding audio<br>
data have also been read), an interrupt request will notify the<br>
microprocessor thereof, and the latter triggers the transfer of a new block,<br>
in such a way as if possible to keep all the FIFO video banks full. This<br>
management is of the full buffer type.<br>
According to the present exemplary embodiment, the recovery<br>
of the system clock is performed by demultiplexing transport packets<br>
corresponding to a program in progress, and by locking a phase-locked<br>
loop to the reference clock values ("PCR") of an incoming TS stream. This<br>
operation makes it possible to obtain the required clock frequency of 27<br>
MHz. Hence, an incoming TS stream is used to recover the reference clock<br>
rate, even if this clock is used in conjunction with audio and video data<br>
which are not broadcast in real time in this stream.<br>
This principle of clock rate recovery is illustrated by the block<br>
diagram of figure 10, which comprises a phase-locked loop (PLL)<br>
composed of a comparator/subtracter 1001, followed by a low-pass filter<br>
1002 and by a voltage-controlled oscillator 1003. A counter 1004 closes<br>
the loop between the output of the oscillator 1003 and an input of the<br>
comparator/ subtracter 1001. The comparator/subtracter furthermore<br>
receives the PCR clock values emanating from a TS stream. The<br>
difference between a local clock value emanating from the counter 1004<br>
and the PCR clock value is sent to the low-pass filter 1002, and the rate of<br>
the loop output signal is adapted accordingly. The clock value contained in<br>
the counter 1004 is regularly updated with the demultiplexed PCR clock<br>
value, this having the effect of synchronizing the counter 1004 with the<br>
clock of the encoder of the TS stream. This clock is used for the decoding<br>
and presentation of the TS stream received in real time. As described<br>
hereinbelow, only the clock rate at the output of the PLL loop is used for<br>
the decoding and presentation of data read from the hard disk.<br>
Other clock recovery processes can be employed. It is in<br>
particular possible to use a free clock. Specifically, the accuracy required<br>
for the 27-MHz clock is not necessarily as high as that imposed by the<br>
MPEG II standard at the level of the encoder, namely 30 ppm. This<br>
accuracy is actually required only if a stream originating directly from an<br>
encoder needs to be decoded. In fact, in such a case, excessive drifting of<br>
the clock of the decoder can cause the buffer memory of the decoder to<br>
dry up or overflow. However, in the case of the reading of a stream from a<br>
local hard disk, the inventors have found that this constraint disappears:<br>
the decoder can in fact regulate the bit rate of the stream in read mode as<br>
a function of its requirements, this not being the case when the stream<br>
reaches it directly, without it having passed through the buffer constituted<br>
by the disk.<br>
The decoding of the video frames is triggered at a given level of<br>
fill of a decoding buffer, forming part of the random access memory 126.<br>
This level is for example 1.5 Mbit for a buffer with a capacity of 1.8 Mbit.<br>
This instant, called top buffer video, is regarded as reference instant for the<br>
decoding and presentation of the video frames. The DTS clock value of the<br>
first frame read from the buffer of the decoder is loaded into the counter<br>
1005 of figure 10. This counter counts at the clock rate generated by the<br>
PLL loop. Decoding of the first video frame is triggered immediately, whilst<br>
the presentation of this first frame and the decoding and presentation of<br>
the following frames is performed according to the corresponding DTS and<br>
PTS clock values, relative to the clock generated by the counter 1005.<br>
The decoding and presentation of the audio frames also call<br>
upon the clock thus regenerated.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the way in which the two file systems "block"<br>
and "stream" share the use of the hard disk. According to the present<br>
exemplary embodiment, the "block" file system and its associated data area<br>
occupy several hundred megabytes, whilst the "stream" file system and its<br>
data area occupy several gigabytes.<br>
The "block1 file system will not be detailed further, the<br>
organization of the corresponding file system being devised in a<br>
conventional manner, of the UNIX or MINIX type for example, comprising a<br>
"super block", a table of nodes, a table of data blocks, as well as the node<br>
and data areas proper. A characteristic of this file system is however that it<br>
favors random access to the data, for example through the use of multiple<br>
indirect addressing (that is to say a series of address pointers only the last<br>
of which gives the address of the sought-after data block), whilst the<br>
"stream" file system has the characteristic of optimizing sequential access.<br>
The hard disk furthermore comprises a single boot block for<br>
both the two file systems. The parameters appearing in the boot block are<br>
the index of the boot program, the name of the volume, the number of<br>
bytes per sector, the number of sectors of the volume, and the number of<br>
sectors of the boot block.<br>
As already mentioned, the parameters chosen for the "stream"<br>
file system are the following: the size of a sector is 512 bytes, a "stream"<br>
block comprising 256 sectors.<br>
This is to be compared with the size of a block of the "block" file<br>
system, namely 4 sectors.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the organization of the "stream" file system.<br>
This file system comprises firstly a block referred to as a "superblock",<br>
containing general information about the file system. Table 1 gives the<br>
information contained in this superblock:<br>
The addresses are given in terms of sector numbers, ail the<br>
sectors of the disk being numbered from 0 up to the maximum number of<br>
sectors of the disk.<br>
Associated with each file or directory of the file system is a data<br>
structure referred to as a "node" which indicates the name of the file or of<br>
the directory, its size, its location and that of its attributes. The nodes are<br>
grouped together in the file system after the superblock. Table 2 indicates<br>
the composition of a node:<br>
A sequence is a run of contiguous blocks forming part of one<br>
and the same file. It is defined by the address of the first block of the<br>
sequence, followed by the number of contiguous blocks. If the file is<br>
fragmented, a pointer returns to an extension area comprising additional<br>
sequences (area of sequence files) with the aid of an appropriate file<br>
identifier. In turn, a sequence file can return to an additional file, and so on<br>
and so forth. This type of simple indirect addressing is well suited to the<br>
sequential nature of the data. This avoids successive manipulation with<br>
several pointers, such manipulation being expensive in terms of time. The<br>
multiple indirect addressings are reserved for the "block" file system, with a<br>
view to facilitating random access to the data.<br>
The attributes are stored in the "blocks" file system. It is<br>
therefore possible to make reference from one file system to data<br>
managed in the other.<br>
The additional sequence files are grouped together in the<br>
"sequences1 section after the area reserved for the nodes (see Figure 6).<br>
The "stream" file system furthermore comprises a "bit table"<br>
indicating for each node, each additional sequence file and each block of<br>
data whether or not it is occupied. To this end, a bit is associated with each<br>
node, additional sequence file and block.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart of the process for writing a file. Initially, a<br>
node associated with the file is created. A locating of this node on the disk<br>
is determined by scanning the table of bits of the nodes. By using the table<br>
of bits of the blocks, the microprocessor 107 determines a free sequence<br>
of blocks and writes the data to be recorded to it, block after block. At the<br>
end of the sequence, the address and the length of the sequence are<br>
stored in the node of the file in memory. The flags of the table of bits of the<br>
blocks corresponding to the blocks allocated to the recording of the<br>
sequence are then updated in a table in memory. The operation of<br>
detecting and writing a sequence is repeated if necessary, until the<br>
complete file has been recorded. Once the recording of the data is<br>
completed, the updated information relating to the location of the data (that<br>
is to say the node and the bit tables updated) are themselves recorded on<br>
the disk. The information is written to the disk only at the end of recording,<br>
so as to avoid incessant toings and froings by the read/write head.<br>
To read a file, the microprocessor firstly reads the node of this<br>
file, as well as the definitions of all the additional sequences referring<br>
thereto. This avoids movement of the disk read/write head during reading<br>
to the areas at the start of the file system.<br>
One of the envisaged applications of the disk is the non-real-<br>
time reading of a program currently being recorded. For example, the<br>
television viewer watching a live program has to go away for a few minutes<br>
and wishes to resume watching at the exact moment at which this was<br>
interrupted. When he goes away, he starts the recording of the program.<br>
On his return, he triggers the reading of the program, although the<br>
recording of the latter is still in progress. Given that the read/write head<br>
must perform movements from the reading areas to the writing areas and<br>
vice versa and that the time of movement of the head is of the order of 10<br>
ms for the disk used within the framework of the present example, certain<br>
precautions have to be taken to guarantee the minimum bit rate required<br>
for reading and writing.<br>
To assess the influence of head jumps on bit rate, we consider<br>
the least favorable conditions by taking the example of the maximum bit<br>
rate of an MPEG II stream, namely 15 Mbit/s, a block of 128 Kbytes thus<br>
corresponding to 66.7 ms of audio and video data, as illustrated by figure<br>
8. The reading or writing of a block, at a transfer rate of 96 Mbit/s, lasts<br>
10.4 ms. If reading is not preceded by a jump, 56.3 ms remain available as<br>
a safety margin.<br>
As indicated in the previous paragraph, a head jump from a first<br>
block to a second block which is not adjacent to the first block takes 10 ms.<br>
Hence, a free interval of 46.3 ms remains.<br>
If a read and a write each preceded by a jump are to be<br>
performed within an interval of 66.7 ms, only 25.9 ms remain available.<br>
Since defective sectors within a block may also give rise to jumps of the<br>
head, it is preferable to limit the number of jumps in read mode and write<br>
mode to the minimum.<br>
According to the present exemplary embodiment, the number of<br>
head jumps during simultaneous recording and reading is reduced by<br>
effecting interleaved writing of the blocks, as illustrated by figures 9a and<br>
9b.<br>
When the recording of the program is triggered (for example by<br>
the television viewer), writing is performed every other block in a sequence<br>
of adjacent blocks. This is illustrated by figure 9a. A jump of the read head<br>
is therefore performed before writing each block.<br>
When the reading of the program is triggered, writing is<br>
continued in the blocks left free previously. For example, following the<br>
reading of the first block written (the one furthest to the left in figure 9b),<br>
the next write is performed in the immediately adjacent block. No jump of<br>
the read/write head is then performed between reading in the first block<br>
and writing in the second block. The reduction in the number of jumps of<br>
the head also results in a consequent reduction in the noise generated by<br>
these movements.<br>
Once all the blocks written before the start of reading have been<br>
read out, writing is cohtinued in a noninterleaved manner. According to a<br>
variant embodiment, if the purpose is solely the non-real-time viewing of<br>
the program, without it being intended that recording should be permanent,<br>
writing is continued by overwriting the content of the previously read<br>
blocks.<br>
According to a variant embodiment, if a recording is to be kept,<br>
then the corresponding interleaved blocks are rewritten sequentially in<br>
such a way as to deinterleave these blocks. Thus, during subsequent<br>
reading, the read head will not need to perform jumps due to the<br>
interleaving.<br>
Of course, the invention is not limited to the exemplary<br>
embodiment given. For example, other types of disk may be used. It will be<br>
sufficient to adapt the corresponding interfaces. Consideration will in<br>
particular be given to hard disks having characteristics other than that<br>
presented hereinabove, rerecordable magneto-optical disks or other data<br>
storage media.<br>
It should be noted that the invention applies also in the case<br>
where the audio and video data are coded differently, in particular in the<br>
case where the PES packets are contained in a program-type stream<br>
("Program Stream") according to the MPEG standard, or the audio and<br>
video data are contained in different structures from those of the PES<br>
packets.<br>
Moreover, although certain elements of the embodiment are<br>
presented in a distinct structural form, it is obvious to the person skilled in<br>
the art that their implementation within a single physical circuit does not<br>
depart from the scope of the invention. Likewise, the software rather than<br>
hardware implementation, or vice versa, of one or more elements does not<br>
depart from the scope of the invention: the FIFO-type memories may for<br>
example be emulated by using a conventional-addressing memory, with<br>
software management of address pointers.<br>
It will also be noted that the data to be stored may originate<br>
from some means of transmission other than that indicated in the<br>
exemplary embodiment. In particular, certain data may travel via modem.<br>
According to the exemplary embodiment described<br>
hereinabove, the areas of the hard disk which are reserved for each of the<br>
two file systems are fixed. According to a variant embodiment, the sizes of<br>
these areas are dynamically adapted to the requirements. Thus, there is<br>
provided a first area of system data for the "block" file system, a second<br>
area of system data for the "stream" file system, then a single area of<br>
blocks of the "stream" type. The management of the "stream" file system is<br>
performed as previously. The management of the "block" file system is<br>
performed as follows: when a file of this type has to be recorded, the<br>
"block" file system reserves the minimum of large-size blocks necessary,<br>
and fragments these large-size blocks (256 sectors according to the<br>
present example) into small-size blocks (four sectors). The table of bits of<br>
the nodes and the table of bits of areas of the "block" file system manage<br>
these fragments of blocks as if they were small-size blocks.<br>
