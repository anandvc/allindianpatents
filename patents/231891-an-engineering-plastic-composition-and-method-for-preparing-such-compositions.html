POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE AND<br>
POLYTRIMETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE RANDOM<br>
COPOLYMER / ALLOY / BLEND AS ENGINEERING PLASTICS<br>
Futura Polyesters Ltd<br>
An Indian Company<br>

The following specification describes the invention.<br><br>
Polyethylene Terephthalate and Polytrimethylene Terephthalate Random Copolymer / Alloy / Blend as Engineering Plastics<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to Engineering thermoplastics with improved physical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties and a preparation thereof.<br>
The said engineering thermoplastic compound envisaged in accordance with this invention is a random copolymer/Blend/Alloy of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polytrimethylene Terephthalate (PTT) which can be simply and economically produced for applications in Automotive, Electrical, Electronics and Consumer goods by Injection Molding, Compression Molding, Extrusion Molding and other suitable molding methods.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Engineering plastics are plastics that retain their dimensional stability at<br>
extreme    conditions    of   temperature    and    pressure.    Engineering<br>
thermoplastics are high performance materials that in many cases have<br>
replaced    metals    and    offer    exciting    design    and    performance<br>
characteristics.<br>
Thermoplastics offer many advantages over traditional  materials, including: low density; low energy for manufacture; low processing costs; and the ability to make complex shapes relatively easily.<br>
Engineering thermoplastic polyesters are performance polymers. Engineering Polyesters find applications in areas like Transportation,<br><br>
Automotive, Electrical / Electronic Appliances, Industrial and consumer goods.<br>
Many engineering thermoplastics are commercially available for variety of applications and include materials like ABS, polycarbonates, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfones, polyacrylates, polyimides and polyimidazoles.<br>
Engineering applications require a balance between cost and performance. Mechanical, thermal, electrical, and other physical properties determine which polymer will be selected. But, in performance polymer applications, the cost / performance balance is shifted toward performance. Since most of the polymers are aimed at Speciality lower volume uses, prices for most of these materials will remain high.<br>
PET, PTT, PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) and PEN (Poly ethylene Naphthalate) compete with other semi crystalline polymers for engineering thermoplastics, films and fiber markets.<br>
PET, introduced as an engineering thermoplastic in 1966, shows high strength, stiffness, dimensional stability, and chemical and heat resistance, and has good electrical properties but has the disadvantages of slow crystallization, lower Impact strength and higher warpage. Slow crystallization increases the molding cycle time and there by decreasing the productivity in molding processes.<br>
PBT has been an engineering polymer since 1974; PBT shows a high mechanical strength, a high heat deflection temperature, low moisture absorption, good dimensional stability, low creep, and excellent electrical<br><br>
properties. PBT also exhibits solvent resistance and is unaffected by water, weak acids and bases and organic solvents.<br>
PTT has been recently introduced commercially by Shell chemicals under the trade name Corterra. The properties of PTT are intermediate to those of PET and PBT. Additionally PTT gives higher crystallization rate than PET and better Surface properties and Gloss.<br>
Crystallization rate is an important parameter for the processing of semi crystalline polymers. PET and PEN Crystallize slowly in the absence of nucleating agents. PBT and PTT are fast crystallizing polymers.<br>
This invention envisages a PET-PTT compound as a random copolymer/Blend/Alloy for use as engineering plastics with excellent processing characteristics and high strength and rigidity for a broad range of applications. Typically properties in which they differentiate themselves from other engineering plastics are:<br>
•	Excellent electrical properties<br>
•	Excellent resistance to chemical attack and high environmental stress crack resistance, in particular in comparison to polycarbonates and PET - PBT blends<br>
•	Very good heat and heat ageing resistance<br>
•	Easy processability<br>
•	Low Moisture absorption<br>
•	Higher surface properties and Gloss<br>
.   Higher stiffness better than PET,PBT<br><br>
To top this all, the engineering thermoplastic of this current invention viz. a compound of PET and PTT is more cost effective and gives better value in comparison with PET and PBT with the same productivity.<br>
Prior art<br>
European Pat. No. 1115926 reports threads made of polymer blend fibers <br>
or filaments based on PET, PBT and PTT. The PTT ranges from 5-95% <br>
in the PET-PTT blended fibers or filaments.<br>
US 6576340 discloses an acid dyeable polyester composition comprising polyester and / or copolyester of Polyethylene Terephthalate, Polytrimethylene Terephthalate, and polytetramethylene Terephthalate and secondary amine or secondary amine salt in an amount effective to promote acid-dyeability.<br>
US 2002127939 deals with bicomponent melt blown nonwovens of PTT with polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene Terephthalate, Polybutylene Terephthalate, polyamide and polylactide; extruded and spun together. The weight ratio of PTT to other component ranges from 1:99 to 99:1.<br>
US 6919131 disclose an elastic interlaced-textured yarn produced by interlacing the PET/PTT polyester.<br>
US 2005048301 describe heat shrinkable polyester film obtained by melt extruding PTT, PET and neopentyl glycol.<br>
US 2005163679 discusses a method for producing high molecular weight polyester such as PET, PBT, PEN, PTT and / or polyester of other Dicarboxylic acids and diols, including copolymers.<br><br>
US 2006008644 also reports about bicomponent fibers spun in a ratio of about 55/45 and 75/25 mixture of PET/PTT by weight.<br>
A Thesis on co-crystallization of the PET/PTT copolyester was studied using DSC and WAXD by Chi-Yun Ko in the year 2003, titled 'Non-isothermal Crystallization Kinetics, Multiple Melting Behaviors and Crystal Structure Simulation of Poly[(ethylene)-co-(Trimethylene Terephthalate)] s'.<br>
A study on PET and PTT in the amorphous state miscible in all the blend compositions has appeared in the Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics, Vol. 42, 676-686(2004) under the title 'Thermal, Crystallization, Mechanical, and Rheological Characteristics of poly (Trimethylene Terephthalate)/poly (ethylene Terephthalate) blends'.<br>
It can be seen from the prior art that though blends of PET and PTT are known for a variety of applications like fiber, high shrinkage film, nonwovens etc., its application as an engineering thermoplastic with improved physical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties and as a substitute for PBT is not known. Also the engineering plastic composition of the present invention results in molded articles with high gloss and low mold shrinkage when compared to PBT.<br><br>

Another object of this invention is to provide engineering thermoplastics with improved physical, electrical, thermal optical and mechanical properties in comparison with PBT.<br>
One more object of the invention is to add appropriate nucleating agents <br>

Experiments were conducted in different methods each adopting various levels of monomer, additive and polymer loading.<br>
Example 1: The following is a typical case and other proportions of PET and PTT are possible as per application requirement.<br>
PTA and MEG are taken in an esterification reactor in the ratio of 1:1.5. <br>
To this 30 ppm of Cobalt as Cobalt Acetate, 250 ppm of Antimony as Antimony Trioxide, 2.1 ppm of RT and 1.5 ppm of BT as Blue and Red <br>
toners to improve color, are added. Further NU004 (sodium benzoate <br>
based product) 200 ppm and Nyacol (30% wt of silica in EG solution) <br>
4500 ppm are also added as nucleating agents. The esterification is <br>
carried out at 240 - 265 deg C for a period of 260 min. At the end of esterification reaction Tetraethyl phosphonoacetate (30 ppm as P) is<br><br>
added to melt. The temperature is increased from 260-290 deg C under vacuum for a period of 220 min.<br>
After the required end speed is reached, 3% of calcium carbonate as an additive for property enhancement, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 40 % of PTT chips respectively and 1500 ppm of Aclyn 285 (Ethylene-Acrylic acid sodium ionomer) are added to the melt with a time interval of 3 minutes. The system is again brought under vacuum and held for 20 minutes for the reaction to complete and the molten amorphous polymer is taken out as strands and cut into chips.<br>
Example 2:<br>
PET, PTT chips were first pre dried in an Oven for 4 hours at 120 deg C and premixed in a Dry blender to produce PET/PTT preblends of 12,15, 20, 30 and 40% w/w of PTT respectively. Preblends were mixed with <br>
30% w/w of Glass fiber and suitable additives separately to have glass <br>
filled materials. Further preblends were mixed with Impact Modifiers and suitable additives to obtain Impact modified materials. The preblends are then melt mixed in a Berstorff co rotating Twin Screw Extruder of L: D ratio 32:1 and Dia 40 mm with a speed of 70 kg/hr and at a temperature <br>
of 275 deg C. The extrudate was cooled in water bath and pelletized in strand Pelletizer. The final chips were collected and dried in an oven at 120 for 4 hours to remove moisture.<br>
The resultant chips were subjected to Thermal analysis in DSC to study Glass transition temperature, Crystallization temperature, Melting temperature and Heat of fusion.<br><br>
Further the chips were used to make specimen by Injection molding process to study Tensile strength, elongation, Impact strength, Flexural Strength and mold shrinkage.<br>
Example 3:<br>

3.	Similarly, PET:PTT in all ratios with 3 % CaC03 and 30 % Glass Fiber filled have better Tensile strength, Tensile Modulus, Flexural strength, Flexural modulus, Impact strength and Mold shrinkage than 100% PBT indicating enhanced properties than individual polymer.<br>
4.	With the incorporation of Impact Modifier, PET/PTT copolymer/blend/alloy can replace Polycarbonate with improved Impact strength.<br>
5.	Being a combination PET/PTT, the resultant copolymer/blend/alloy is more cost effective in comparison with PBT.<br><br>
6.	With the incorporation of hollow glass spheres, the specific gravity    of PET/PTT copolymer/blend/alloy can be brought down the level      of Nylon and replace Nylon with the improved properties.<br>
7.	Incorporation of PEN can improve U.V stability of the PET/PTT copolymer/blend/alloy to reduce the U.V degradation in molded products.<br>
