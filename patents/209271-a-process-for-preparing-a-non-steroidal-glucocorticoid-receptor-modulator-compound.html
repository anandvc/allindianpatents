				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of non-steroidal glucocorticoid receptor modulators.<br>
Nuclear receptors are classically defined as a family of ligand dependent transcription factors, that are activated in response to ligand binding (R.M. Evans, 240 Science, 889 (1988)). Members of this family include the following receptors: glueocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, androgen, progesterone and estrogen. Naturally occurring ligands to these receptors are low molecular weight molecules that play an important role in health and in many diseases. Excesses or deficiencies of these ligands can have profound physiological consequences. As an example, glucocorticoid excess results in Cushing's Syndrome, while glucocorticoid insufficiency results in Addison's Disease.<br>
The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is present in glucocorticoid responsive cells where it resides in the cytosol in an inactive state until it is stimulated by an agonist. Upon stimulation the glucocorticoid receptor translocates to the cell nucleus where it specifically interacts with DMA and/or protein(s) and regulates transcription in a glucocorticoid responsive manner. Two examples of proteins that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor are the transcription factors, API and NFK-B. Such interactions result in inhibition of API- and NFK-B- mediated transcription and are believed to be responsible for some of the anti-inflammatory activity of endogenously administered glucocorticoids. In addition, glucocorticoids may also exert physiologic effects independent of nuclear transcription. Biologically relevant glucocorticoid receptor agonists include cortisol and corticosterone. Many synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonists exist including dexamethasone, prednisone and prednisilone. By definition, glucocorticoid receptor antagonists bind to the receptor and prevent glucocorticoid receptor agonists from binding and eliciting GR mediated events, including transcription. RU486 is an example of a non-selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist.<br>

All reagents were available from commercial sources and used without purification unless stated otherwise. Melting points were determined on a Thomas Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. NMR spectra were obtained on an UNITYplus-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer in deuterochloroform, acetone-d6 or DMSO-d6. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FT-IR. Optical rotations were determined on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. Mass<br>
spectra were obtained at M-Scan Inc., West Chester, PA.  Elemental analyses were performed by Schwarzkopf Microanalytical Laboratory, Woodside, NY.<br>
Example 1 l-(1(RS)-Benzyl-6-bromo-3,4-dihydro-1H-naphthalen-2-ylidene)-pyrrolidinlum bromide.<br>
A solution of the bisulfite adduct of bromotetralone (250 grams, 760 mmol) in<br>
saturated sodium bicarbonate (1.25 L) and ethyl acetate (2.5 L) was stirred vigorously<br>
overnight.  Phases were separated and the organic was transferred to a new flask<br>
and toluene (1 L) was added. The solution was distilled under reduced pressure to a<br>
volume of approximately 500 mL. An additional 500 ml of toluene was added and<br>
distilled under reduced pressure to a volume of approximately 300 ml. The solution<br>
was cooled to room temperature and pyrrolidine (54.1 grams, 760 mmol) was added.<br>
The reaction was heated to 150°C under Dean-Stark conditions.   After 2 hours<br>
approximately 13 ml of water was collected and concentration of a small sample<br>
showed the reaction was complete by NMR.   The toluene solution of pyrroiidine<br>
enamine was cooled to 90°C and benzyl bromide (105 mL, 912 mmol) was added<br>
dropwise. After 30 minutes solids began to granulate and the solution became very<br>
thick.  An additional 500 mL of toluene was added to aid stirring and heating was<br>
continued at 90°C for 2 hours. The slurry was allowed to cool to room temperature<br>
and granulate overnight. The solids were filtered and washed with toluene (2 times<br>
500 mL).   After drying in a vacuum oven overnight (5p°C) a brown solid was<br>

The resulting slurry was transferred to a 1L hydrogenator with overhead stirring under 50 psi of hydrogen. After 5 hours no starting material could be detected by HPLC and the reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite.
