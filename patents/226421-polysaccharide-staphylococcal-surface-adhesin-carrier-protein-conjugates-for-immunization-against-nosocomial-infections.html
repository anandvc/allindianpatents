				<td>POLYSACCHARIDE - STAPHYLOCOCCAL SURFACE ADHESIN<br>
CARRIER PROTEIN CONJUGATES<br>
FOR IMMUNIZATION AGAINST NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an immunogenic polysaccharide-protein conjugate<br>
comprising a polysaccharide antigen (or its oligosaccharide fragment representing<br>
one or more antigenic epitopes) from a nosocomial pathogen and a staphylococcal<br>
surface adhesin carrier protein. This invention also relates to immunogenic<br>
compositions comprising the polysaccharide-protein conjugate, and their use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Every year about 2 million of the estimated 40 million people admitted to<br>
hospitals in the U.S. will develop a nosocomial infection (Anonyomous 1997). With a<br>
motality rate of approximately 4.4%, nosocomial infections contribute to 88,000<br>
deaths per year. The cost of hospital-acquired infections in the U.S. has been<br>
estimated at $4.5 billion per year (Weinstein 1998). These estimates do not include<br>
infections occurring in the 31 million outpatient surgeries performed each year<br>
(National Center for Health Statistics' website), the 1.5 million nursing home<br>
residents, the extended care facilities, or among those receiving ambulatory care<br>
procedures.<br>
Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS),<br>
particularly S. epidermidis, are Gram-positive opportunistic nosocomial pathogens<br>
that are responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections. Staphylococcal<br>
infections account for nearly 25% (approximately 500,000) of all nosocomial<br>
infections (Haley, Culver et al. 1985) (Boyce 1997). Up to 1% of all admissions in<br>
some hospitals result in S. aureus infections (Storch and Rajagopalan 1986).<br>
Staphylococci (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) account for about 47% of the<br>
nosocomial bloodstream infections, 24% of the surgical site infections (SSI), and<br>
17% of hospital-acquired pneumonia (Anonyomous 1997). The mortality rate of<br>
patients with nosocomial S. aureus and CoNS infections varies considerably, ranging<br>
from 5% to 68% (Nada, Ichiyama et al. 1996); (Thylefors, Harbarth et al. 1998).<br><br>
Staphylococcal infections are diverse in scope, ranging from cutaneous<br>
infections, such as impetigo, boils, wound infections and infections from implanted<br>
devices, to severe life-threatening infections, such as osteomyelitis, endocarditis and<br>
bacteremia with metastatic complications. This diversity makes the design of an<br>
efficacious immunogenic composition against staphylococci a true challenge. A<br>
sharp increase in the appearance of drug-resistant nosocomial bacteria makes such<br>
a design even more difficult. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus causes approximately<br>
40% of the deaths attributed to nosocomial infections (Boyce 1997). The recent<br>
emergence of vancomycin intermediate-resistant S. aureus (VISA) has raised even<br>
greater concern over its spread. Thus, there is a strong and rapidly growing need for<br>
an efficacious immunogenic composition against nosocomial infections.<br>
Capsular Polysaccharides<br>
The involvement of capsular polysaccharides (CP) in the virulence of many<br>
bacterial pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae<br>
and group B streptococci, is well established. Encapsulated bacteria are resistant to<br>
phagocytosis by leukocytes, and thus can infect the blood and tissues. E3ecause<br>
antibodies to capsular polysaccharides neutralize the antiphagocytic properties of<br>
the bacterial capsule (Karakawa, Sutton et al. 1988; Thakker, Park et al. 1998), the<br>
staphylococcal capsule has been a major target in the development of immunogenic<br>
compositions to prevent staphylococcal infection in humans.<br>
Of the 12 known capsular serotypes of S. aureus, serotype 5 (CP5) and<br>
serotype 8 (CP8) account for approximately 85-90% of all clinical isolates (Arbeit,<br>
Karakawa et al. 1984; Karakawa, Fournier et al. 1985; Essawi, Na'was et al. 1998;<br>
Na'was, Hawwari et al. 1998). Most methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates express<br>
CP5 (Sompolinsky, Samra et al. 1985). Antibodies to CP5 and CP8 induce type-<br>
specific opsonophagocytic killing by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in vitro<br>
and confer protection in animals (Karakawa, Sutton et al. 1988; Fattom, Sarwar et al.<br>
1996).<br>
Most bacterial capsular polysaccharides are poor immunogens in animals and<br>
humans. However, if the purified polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carrier<br>
molecules, they acquire immunogenicity and T-cell dependency. Several<br>
laboratories have synthesized immunogenic conjugates consisting of CP5 and CP8<br><br>
covalently linked to protein. These conjugates are highly immunogenic in mice and<br>
humans and induce antibodies that opsonize microencapsulated S. aureus.for<br>
phagocytosis (Fattom, Schenerson et al. 1993; Gilbert et al. 1994; Reynaud-Rondier<br>
et al. 1991). Monovalent immunogenic compositions containing CP5 conjugated to<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exotoxin A are immunogenic and well<br>
tolerated in healthy adults and in patients with end-stage renal disease (Welch et al.<br>
1996). In a double-blind trial involving patients with end-stage renal disease who<br>
were receiving hemodialysis, a bivalent conjugate vaccine composed of CP5 and<br>
CP8 covalently bound to Pseudomonas aeruginosa recombinant exotoxin A<br>
conferred partial immunity against S. aureus bacteremia for approximately 40 weeks,<br>
after which protection decreased as antibody levels decreased (Shinefield et al.<br>
2002). The outcome of this trial indicates a need for an improved immunogenic<br>
composition that could contribute to more complete protection.<br>
Another type of extracellular polysaccharide, referred to as polysaccharide<br>
adhesin (PS/A; (Tojo, Yamashita et al. 1988)), poly-N-succinyl β-1-6 glucosamine<br>
(PNSG; (McKenney, Pouliot et al. 1999)), poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface<br>
polysaccharide (PNAG; (Maira-Litran, Kropec et al. 2002)), or polysaccharide<br>
intercellular adhesin (PIA (Mack, Fischer et al. 1996)) is expressed by both S. aureus<br>
and S. epidermidis . PIA or PS/A is a linear (3-1,6-linked glucosaminoglycan.<br>
Immunization of mice with PS/A (PNSG, PNAG) reduces colonization of kidneys and<br>
protects mice from death after challenge with S. aureus strains that produced little<br>
PS/A (PNSG, PNAG) in vitro (McKenney, Pouliot et al. 1999). PIA plays an<br>
important role in the pathogenesis of intravascular catheter-associated infections<br>
(Rupp, Ulphani et al. 1999; Rupp, Ulphani et al. 1999; Rupp and Fey 2001; Rupp,<br>
Fey et al. 2001). In addition to promoting adhesion between individual S. epidermidis<br>
cells, PIA binds to erythrocytes and acts as a hemagglutinin (Fey, Ulphani et al.<br>
1999).<br>
Staphylococcal surface adhesins<br>
Staphylococci express multiple surface adhesins (termed microbial surface<br>
components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) which include, for example,<br>
fibronectin-binding protein, fibrinogen-binding protein, collagen-binding protein and<br><br>
vitronectin-binding protein. These adhesins specifically recognize and bind to<br>
extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as, for example, fibronectin, fibrinogen,<br>
collagen and vitronectin. The redundancy and multitude of adhesion factors<br>
expressed by S. aureus contribute to its pathogenicity by providing alternate methods<br>
for adherence to, and infection of, a variety of tissues. Antibodies to staphylococcal<br>
adhesins may reduce disease by preventing bacteria from invading mammalian host<br>
tissues or by promoting opsonophagocytosis. Rats immunized with a portion of the<br>
S. aureus fibronectin-binding protein A (provided as a fusion protein) endowed the<br>
rats with a modest degree of protection from experimental endocarditis. A similar<br>
immunogenic composition designed to elicit antibodies to fibronectin-binding protein<br>
A was tested in a mouse model of S. aureus mastitis. Immunized mice showed<br>
fewer cases of severe mastitis than the control mice and fewer bacteria were<br>
recovered from the mammary glands of immunized mice than of control mice. Mice<br>
immunized with fibrinogen-binding proteins of 19 and 87 kDa showed a reduced<br>
incidence of mastitis compared with nonimmunized controls, whereas immunization<br>
with collagen-binding protein was not protective (Lee, Pier 1997).<br>
However, despite these and other efforts to conjugate polysaccharide<br>
antigens to a variety of protein carriers, there currently is no efficacious immunogenic<br>
composition for treating or preventing nosocomial infections.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention thus provides an immunogenic polysaccharide-protein<br>
conjugate that comprises at least one polysaccharide antigen derived from a<br>
nosocomial pathogen, or an oligosaccharide fragment representing one or more<br>
antigenic epitopes of at least one polysaccharide antigen (prepared synthetically or<br>
by hydrolysis of native polysaccharide) conjugated to at least one staphylococcal<br>
surface adhesin carrier protein. The conjugates of this invention are used in<br>
immunogenic compositions, which are useful in eliciting in a subject specific antibody<br>
responses to both the polysaccharide antigen of the nosocomial pathogen and the<br>
surface adhesin carrier protein. As such, these conjugates can be used to immunize<br>
against nosocomial infections caused by S. aureus, S. epidermidis or other<br>
nosocomial pathogens, and for the generation of immunoglobulin for passive<br>
immunization to prevent or reduce the severity of nosocomial infections.<br><br>
In one aspect of the invention, there is provided an immunogenic<br>
polysaccharide-protein conjugate comprising at least one polysaccharide antigen<br>
from a nosocomial pathogen conjugated ot at least one staphylococcal surface<br>
adhesin carrier protein, wherein the conjugate generates specific antibodies to both<br>
the polysaccharide antigen and the surface adhesin carrier protein.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided an immunogenic<br>
polysaccharide-protein conjugate comprising an oligosaccharide fragment<br>
representing one or more antigenic epitopes of at least one polysaccharide antigen<br>
from a nosocomial pathogen conjugated to at least one staphylococcal surface<br>
adhesin earner protein, wherein the conjugate generates specific antibodies to both<br>
the polysaccharide antigen and the surface adhesin carrier protein.<br>
In yet another aspect, there is provided an immunogenic composition which<br>
comprises the polysaccharide antigen-surface adhesin protein conjugate in<br>
association with a suitable carrier or diluent. The immunogenic compositions of the<br>
invention may also comprise an adjuvant, such as, for example, aluminum hydroxide<br>
or aluminum phosphate.<br>
In yet a further aspect, there is provided a method of inducing active immunity<br>
against nosocomial infections in a mammal, which method comprises administering<br>
to the mammal subject to such infections, including a human, an immunogenic<br>
amount of an immunogenic composition of the invention.<br>
In still another aspect, there is provided a method of preparing an<br>
immunotherapeutic agent against nosocomial infections, which method comprises<br>
the steps of immunizing a mammal with the immunogenic composition of the<br>
invention, collecting plasma from the immunized mammal, and harvesting from the<br>
collected plasma a hyperimmune globulin that contains anti-polysaccharide<br>
antibodies and anti-surface adhesin antibodies. The hyperimmune globulin can be<br>
used for inducing passive immunity to nosocomial infections.<br>
The conjugates of the present invention have the distinct advantage of<br>
eliciting antibodies to both the polysaccharide antigen and the surface adhesin carrier<br>
protein (both of which are virulence factors), and conferring immunity to the diseases<br>
caused by nosocomial pathogens. That is, the surface adhesin protein itself can<br><br>
confer immunity and not merely act as a protein carrier for the polysaccharide<br>
antigen.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Nosocomial infections involve multiple virulence factors. Thus, it is highly<br>
probable that a combination of virulence determinants included as components in<br>
immunogenic compositions would increase protection compared with an<br>
immunogenic composition containing only a single virulence determinant. The<br>
polysaccharide antigens of the present invention are derived from various<br>
nosocomial pathogenic microorganisms including, but not limited to, Staphylococcus<br>
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci<br>
(CoNS), Enterococcus spp., Candida albicans, Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus<br>
influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
These antigens are virulence factors in systemic infections and are poor<br>
immunogens. Their immunogenicity can be enhanced by conjugation to a carrier<br>
protein. For the purpose of the present invention surface adhesin proteins are<br>
microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules. These are<br>
suitably available under the trademark MSCRAMM® from Inhibitex Inc, Alpharetta,<br>
GA, USA. As described below, utilizing a staphylococcus surface adhesin protein as<br>
a carrier protein for polysaccharide antigens converts the polysaccharide into a T-cell<br>
dependent antigen, thus inducing an anti-polysaccharide IgG response.<br>
Furthermore, the conjugate induces anti-surface adhesin carrier protein antibodies<br>
that protect against infection and help prevent bacterial adherence to mammalian<br><br>
host tissues. Although it has been known that the chemical reactions of the protein-<br>
saccharide conjugation methods may have a deleterious effect on the immunogenic<br>
epitopes of carrier proteins, surprisingly in the present invention, no such effect is<br>
seen, and the protein remains capable of eliciting responses against protective<br>
epitopes.<br>
Surface adhesin proteins on the bacterial cell surface and ligands within the<br>
host tissue interact in a lock and key fashion resulting in the adherence of bacteria to<br>
the host. Adhesion is often required for bacterial survival and helps bacteria evade<br>
host defense mechanisms and antibiotic challenges. Once the bacteria have<br>
successfully adhered to and colonized host tissues, their physiology is dramatically<br>
altered, and damaging components such as toxins and enzymes are secreted.<br>
Moreover, the adherent bacteria often produce a biofilm and quickly become<br>
resistant to the killing effect of most antibiotics.<br>
Representative examples of surface adhesin proteins include fibronectin-<br>
binding protein, fibrinogen-binding protein, collagen-binding protein and vitronectin-<br>
binding protein. These adhesins specifically recognize and bind to the extracellular<br>
matrix components fibrinogen, fibronectin, collagen and vitronectin.<br>
Fibronectin-Bindinq Protein<br>
Fibronectin (Fn) is a 440-kDa glycoprotein found in the ECM and body fluids<br>
of animals. The primary biological function of fibronectin appears to be related to its<br>
ability to serve as a substrate for the adhesion of cells expressing the appropriate<br>
integrins. Several bacterial species have been shown to bind fibronectin specifically<br>
and to adhere to a fibronectin-containing substratum. Most S. aureus isolates bind<br>
Fn, but do so in varying extents, which reflects variations in the number of surface<br>
adhesin molecules expressed on the bacterial cell surface. The interaction between<br>
Fn and S. aureus is highly specific (Kuusela 1978). Fn binding is mediated by two<br>
surface exposed proteins with molecular weights of 110 kDa, named FnE3P-A and<br>
FnBP-B. The primary Fn binding site consists of a motif of 35-40 amino acids,<br>
repeated three to five times. The genes for these have been cloned and sequenced<br>
(Jonsson 1991).<br>
WO-A-85/05553 discloses bacterial cell surface proteins having fibronectin-,<br>
fibrinogen-, collagen-, and/or laminin-binding ability.<br><br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,320,951 and 5,571,514 to Hook, et al., disclose the<br>
fibronectin-binding protein A (fnbA) gene sequence, and products and methods<br>
based on +his sequence.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,175,096 to Hook et al., discloses the gene sequence of<br>
fnbB, a hybrid DNA molecule (fnbB) and biological products and methods based on<br>
this sequence.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,652,217 discloses an isolated and purified protein having<br>
binding activity that is encoded by a hybrid DNA molecule from S. aureus of defined<br>
sequence.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,440,014 discloses a fibronectin-binding peptide within the D3<br>
homology unit of a fibronectin-binding protein of S. aureus which can be used for<br>
immunization of ruminants against mastitis caused by staphylococcal infections, for<br>
treatment of wounds, for blocking protein receptors, for immunization of other<br>
animals, or for use in a diagnostic assay.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,189,015 discloses a method for the prophylactic treatment of<br>
the colonization of a S. aureus bacterial strain having the ability to bind to fibronectin<br>
in a mammal that includes administering to the mammal in need of treatment a<br>
prophylactically effective amount of a protein having fibronectin-binding properties, to<br>
prevent the generation of infections caused by a S. aureus bacterial strain having the<br>
ability to bind fibronectin, wherein the protein has a molecular weight of 87 kDa to<br>
165 kDa.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,416,021 discloses a fibronectin-binding protein encoding DNA<br>
from Streptococcus dysgalactiae, along with a plasmid that includes DNA encoding<br>
for fibronectin-binding protein from S. dysgalactiae contained in £. coli, DNA<br>
encoding a fibronectin-binding protein from S. dysgalactiae and an E. coli<br>
microorganism transformed by DNA encoding a fibronectin-binding protein from S.<br>
dysgalactiae.<br>
Collagen-Binding Protein<br>
Collagen js the major constituent of cartilage. Collagen (Cn) binding proteins<br>
are commonly expressed by staphylococcal strains. The collagen-binding surface<br><br>
adhesin protein of S. aureus adheres to cartilage in a process that constitutes an<br>
important part of the pathogenic mechanism in staphylococcal infections (Switalski<br>
1993). Collagen binding by S. aureus is found to play a role in at least, but not only,<br>
arthritis and septicemia. Collagen adhesins (CNAs) with molecular weights of 133,<br>
110 and 87 kDa (Patti, J., et al. 1992) have been identified. Strains expressing CNAs<br>
with different molecular weights do not differ in their collagen-binding ability (Switalski<br>
1993).<br>
Staphylococcal strains recovered from the joints of patients diagnosed with<br>
septic arthritis or osteomyelitis almost invariably express a collagen-binding protein,<br>
whereas significantly fewer isolates obtained from wound infections express this<br>
adhesin (Switalski et al. 1993). Similarly, S. aureus strains isolated from the bones of<br>
patients with osteomyelitis often have a surface adhesin protein recognizing the<br>
bone-specific protein, bone sialoprotein (BSP) (Ryden et al. 1987). S. aureus<br>
colonization of the articular cartilage within the joint space appears to be an important<br>
factor contributing to the development of septic arthritis.<br>
WO 92/07002 discloses a hybrid DNA molecule which includes a nucleotide<br>
sequence from S. aureus coding for a protein or polypeptide having collagen-binding<br>
activity and a plasmid or phage comprising the nucleotide sequence.<br>
Also disclosed are an E. coli strain expressing the collagen-binding protein, a<br>
microorganism transformed by the recombinant DNA, the method for producing a<br>
collagen-binding protein or polypeptide, and the protein sequence of the collagen-<br>
binding protein or polypeptide.<br>
The cloning, sequencing, and expression of a gene cna, encoding a S.<br>
aureus collagen-binding protein has been reported (Patti, J., et al. 1992).<br>
The cna gene encodes a 133-kDa adhesin that contains structural features<br>
characteristic of surface proteins isolated from Gram-positive bacteria.<br>
Recently, the ligand-binding site has been localized within the N- terminal half<br>
of the collagen-binding protein (Patti, J. et al. 1993). By analyzing the collagen<br>
binding activity of recombinant proteins corresponding to different segments of the<br>
surface adhesin protein, a 168-amino-acid long protein fragment (corresponding to<br><br>
amino acid residues 151-318) that had appreciable collagen binding activity was<br>
identified. Short truncations of this protein in the N or C terminus resulted in a loss of<br>
ligand binding activity but also resulted in conformational changes in the protein as<br>
indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy.<br>
Patti et al. (1995) disclose a collagen-binding epitope in the S. aureus<br>
adhesin encoded by the cna gene. In their study, the authors synthesized peptides<br>
derived from the sequence of the said protein and used them to produce antibodies.<br>
Some of these antibodies inhibit the binding of the protein to collagen.<br>
WO 97/43314 discloses that certain identified epitopes of the collagen-binding<br>
protein (M55, M33, and M17) can be used to generate protective antibodies.<br>
The application also discloses the crystal structure of the collagen-binding<br>
protein which provides critical information necessary for identifying compositions<br>
which interfere with, or block completely, the binding of collagen to S. aureus<br>
collagen-binding protein. The ligand-binding site in the S. aureus collagen-binding<br>
protein and a 25-amino-acid peptide was characterized that directly inhibits the<br>
binding of S. aureus to 125 l-labeled type II collagen.<br>
Fibrinoaen-Binding Protein<br>
Fibrin is the major component of blood clots, and fibrinogen/fibrin is one of the<br>
major plasma proteins deposited on implanted biomaterials. Considerable evidence<br>
exists to suggest that bacterial adherence to fibrinogen/fibrin is important in the<br>
initiation of device-related infection. For example, as shown by Vaudaux et al.<br>
(1989), S. aureus adheres to in vitro plastic that has been coated with fibrinogen in a<br>
dose-dependent manner. In addition, in a model that mimics a blood clot or damage<br>
to a heart valve, Herrmann et al. (1993) demonstrated that S. aureus binds avidly via<br>
a fibrinogen bridge to platelets adhering to surfaces. 5. aureus can adhere directly to<br>
fibrinogen in blood clots formed in vitro, and can adhere to cultured endothelial cells<br>
via fibrinogen deposited from plasma acting as a bridge (Moreillon et al. 1995;<br>
Cheung et al. 1991). As shown by Vaudaux et al. and Moreillon et al., mutants<br>
defective in the fibrinogen-binding protein clumping factor (ClfA) exhibit reduced<br>
adherence to fibrinogen in vitro, to explanted catheters, to blood clots, and to<br><br>
damaged heart valves in the rat model for endocarditis (Vaudaux et al. 1995;<br>
Moreillon et al. 1995).<br>
An adhesin for fibrinogen, often referred to as "clumping factor," is located on<br>
the surface of S. aureus cells. The interaction between bacteria and fibrinogen in<br>
solution results in the instantaneous clumping of bacterial cells. The binding site on<br>
fibrinogen is located in the C-terminus of the gamma chain of the dimeric fibrinogen<br>
glycoprotein. The affinity is very high and clumping occurs in low concentrations of<br>
fibrinogen. Scientists have recently shown that clumping factor also promotes<br>
adherence to solid phase fibrinogen, to blood clots, and to damaged heart valves<br>
(McDevitt et al.1994; Vaudaux et al. 1995; Moreillon et al. 1995).<br>
Two genes in S. aureus have been found that code for two fibrinogen-binding<br>
proteins, ClfA and ClfB. The gene, clfA, was cloned and sequenced and found to<br>
code for a polypeptide of 92 kDa. ClfA binds the gamma chain of fibrinogen, and<br>
ClfB binds the alpha and beta chains (Eidhin, et al. 1998). ClfB is a cell-wall<br>
associated protein with a predicted molecular weight of 88 kDa and an apparent<br>
molecular weight of 124kDa that binds both soluble and immobilized fibrinogen and<br>
acts as a clumping factor.<br>
The gene for a clumping factor protein, designated ClfA, was cloned,<br>
sequenced and analyzed in detail at the molecular level (McDevitt et al. 1994;<br>
McDevitt et al. 1995). The predicted protein is composed of 933 amino acids. A<br>
signal sequence of 39 residues occurs at the N-terminus followed by a 520 residue<br>
region (region A), which contains the fibrinogen-binding domain. A 308 residue<br>
region (region R), composed of 154 repeats of the dipeptide serine-aspartate,<br>
follows. The R region sequence is encoded by the 18 base pair repeat GAY TCN<br>
GAY TCN GAY AGY in which Y equals pyrimidines and N equals any base. The C-<br>
terminus of ClfA has features present in many surface proteins of gram-positive<br>
bacteria such as an LPDTG motif, which is responsible for anchoring the protein to<br>
the cell wall, a membrane anchor, and positive charged residues at the extreme C-<br>
terminus.<br>
The platelet integrin alpha Ilbp3 recognizes the C-terminus of the gamma<br>
chain of fibrinogen. This is a crucial event in the initiation of blood clotting during<br><br>
coagulation. ClfA and alpha ifbβ3 appear to recognize precisely the same sites on<br>
the fibrinogen gamma chain because ClfA can block platelet aggregation, and a<br>
peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of the ga.virna chain (198-411) can block<br>
both the integrin and ClfA interacting with fibrinogen (McDevitt et al. 1997). The<br>
fibrinogen-binding site of alpha Ilbβ3 is close to, or overlaps, a Ca2+ binding<br>
determinant referred to as an "EF hand." ClfA region A carries several EF hand-like<br>
motifs. A concentration of Ca2+ in the range of 3-5 mM blocks these ClfA-fibrinogen<br>
interactions and changes the secondary structure of the ClfA protein. Mutations<br>
affecting the ClfA EF hand reduce or prevent interactions with fibrinogen. Ca2+ and<br>
the fibrinogen gamma chain seem to bind to the same, or to overlapping, sites in ClfA<br>
region A.<br>
The alpha chain of the leukocyte integrin, alpha Mβ2, has an insertion of 200<br>
amino acids (A or I domain) which is responsible for ligand binding activities. A novel<br>
metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif in the I domain is required for<br>
ligand binding. Among the ligands recognized is fibrinogen. The binding site on<br>
fibrinogen is in the gamma chain (residues 190-202). It was recently reported that<br>
Candida albicans has a surface protein, alpha Intlp, having properties reminiscent of<br>
eukaryotic integrins. The surface protein has amino acid sequence homology with the<br>
I domain of Mβ2,'including the MIDAS motif. Furthermore, Intlp binds to fibrinogen.<br>
ClfA region A also exhibits some degree of sequence homology with alpha<br>
Intlp. Examination of the ClfA region A sequence has revealed a potential MIDAS<br>
motif. Mutations in putative cation coordinating residues in the DxSxS portion of the<br>
MIDAS motif in ClfA results in a significant reduction in fibrinogen binding. A peptide<br>
corresponding to the gamma-chain binding site for alpha Mβ2 (190-202) has been<br>
shown by O'Connell et al. to inhibit ClfA-fibrinogen interactions (O'Connell 1998).<br>
Thus it appears that ClfA can bind to the gamma chain of fibrinogen at two separate<br>
sites. The ligand binding sites on ClfA are similar to those employed by eukaryotic<br>
integrins and involve divalent cation binding EF-hand and MIDAS motifs.<br>
Also known is the fibrinogen-binding protein, ClfB, which has a predicted<br>
molecular weight of approximately 88 kDa and an apparent molecular weight of<br>
approximately 124 kDa. ClfB is a cell-wall associated protein and binds both soluble<br><br>
and immobilized fibrinogen. In addition, ClfB binds both the alpha and beta chains of<br>
fibrinogen and acts as a clumping factor.<br>
Proteins related to the fibrinogen-binding ClfAand ClfB have been found,<br>
which bind to the extracellular matrix. The SdrC, SdrD and SdrE proteins are related<br>
in primary sequence and structural organization to the ClfA and ClfB proteins, and<br>
are also localized on the cell surface. With the A region of these proteins localized<br>
on the cell surface, the proteins can interact with the proteins in plasma, the<br>
extracellular matrix or with molecules on the surface of host cells. SdrC can bind to<br>
the extracellular matrix proteins, such as, for example, vitronectin. SdrE also binds to<br>
the extracellular matrix; for example, SdrE binds bone siaioprotein (BSP).<br>
It has been discovered that in the A region of SdrC, SdrD, SdrE, ClfA, and<br>
ClfB, there is highly conserved amino acid sequence that can be used to derive a<br>
consensus TYTFTDYVD motif. The motif can be used in multicomponent vaccines<br>
to impart broad spectrum immunity to bacterial infections, and also can be used to<br>
produce monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that impart broad spectrum passive<br>
immunity. In an alternative embodiment, any combination of the variable sequence<br>
motif derived from the Sdr and Clf protein families, (T/l) (Y/F) (T/V) (F) (T) (D/N) (Y)<br>
(V) (D/N), can be used to impart immunity or to induce protective antibodies.<br>
MHC-II Analogous Proteins<br>
In addition to fibrinogen, fibronectin and collagen, S. aureus strains associate<br>
with other adhesive eukaryotic proteins, many of which belong to the family of<br>
adhesive matrix proteins, such as vitronectin (Chatwal et al. 1987). U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,648,240 discloses a DNA segment comprising a gene encoding a S. aureus broad<br>
spectrum adhesin that has a molecular weight of about 70 kDa. The adhesin is<br>
capable of binding fibronectin or vitronectin and includes a MHC II mimicking unit of<br>
about 30 amino acids. Further analyses of the binding specificities of this protein<br>
reveal that it functionally resembles an MHC II antigen in that it binds synthetic<br>
peptides. Thus, in addition to mediating bacterial adhesion to extracellular matrix<br>
proteins, it may play a role in staphylococcal infections by suppressing the immune<br>
system of the host.<br><br>
Sdr Proteins from Staphylococcus epidermidis<br>
Staphylococcus epidermiub, a coagulase-negative bacterium, is a common<br>
inhabitant of human skin and a frequent cause of foreign-body infections.<br>
Pathogenesis is facilitated by the ability of the organism to first adhere to, and<br>
subsequently to form biofilms on, indwelling medical devices such as artificial valves,<br>
orthopedic devices, and intravenous and peritoneal dialysis catheters. Device-<br>
related infections may jeopardize the success of medical treatment and significantly<br>
increase patient mortality. Accordingly, the ability to develop vaccines that can<br>
control or prevent outbreaks of S. epidermidis infection is of great importance, as is<br>
the development of conjugate vaccines that can prevent or treat infection from a<br>
broad spectrum of bacteria, including both coagulase-positive and coagulase-<br>
negative bacteria at the same time.<br>
Three Sdr (serine-aspartate (SD) repeat region) proteins that are expressed<br>
by S. epidermidis have been designated as SdrF, SdrG and SdrH, and the amino<br>
acid sequences of these proteins and their nucleic acid sequences are shown WO<br>
00/12131, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a conjugate useful as an<br>
immunogenic composition is provided that includes at least one polysaccharide<br>
antigen conjugated to at least one of the surface adhesin proteins described above.<br>
In addition, antibodies to the polysaccharide antigen and the surface adhesin protein<br>
are raised using conventional means. As such, the immunogenic compositions that<br>
include a surface adhesin protein, such as SdrG, are used to treat a broad spectrum<br>
of bacterial infections, including those arising from both coagulase-positive and<br>
coagulase-negative bacteria.<br>
The other component of the conjugates of this invention comprises at least<br>
one polysaccharide antigen derived from a nosocomial pathogen. Such nosocomial<br>
pathogens include, but are not limited to, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus<br>
epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus spp.,<br>
Candida albicans, Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella<br>
pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br><br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the polysaccharide antigen comprises at<br>
least one of S. aureus CP5 and CP8.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the polysaccharide antigen<br>
comprises at least one of PS/A, PNSG, PNAG and PIA, as expressed by S. aureus<br>
and/or S. epidermidis.<br>
Preparation and Use of Immunogenic Compositions<br>
Immunogenic compositions are prepared from the polysaccharide antigen-<br>
surface adhesin protein conjugates as disclosed herein. The immunogenic<br>
compositions elicit an immune response that produces antibodies to both the<br>
polysaccharide antigen and the surface adhesin carrier protein.<br>
Immunogenic compositions are also prepared from the oligosaccharide<br>
antigen-surface adhesin protein conjugates as disclosed herein. The immunogenic<br>
compositions elicit an immune response that produces antibodies to both the<br>
oligosaccharide antigen and the surface adhesin carrier protein.<br>
Conjugates provided herein that are suitable for use as Immunogenic<br>
compositions include, but are not limited to:<br>
(i) CP5 conjugated to a fibrinogen-binding protein or peptide of S. aureus,<br>
such as Clumping Factor A (ClfA), or a useful fragment thereof, or a protein or<br>
fragment with sufficiently high homology thereto; or<br>
(ii) CP8 conjugated to a fibrinogen-binding protein or peptide of S. aureus,<br>
such as Clumping Factor A (ClfA), or a useful fragment thereof, or a protein or<br>
fragment with sufficiently high homology thereto; or<br>
(iii) PIA conjugated to a fibrinogen-binding protein or peptide of S. aureus,<br>
such as Clumping Factor A (ClfA), or a useful fragment thereof, or a protein or<br>
fragment with sufficiently high homology thereto; or<br>
(iv) CP5 conjugated to a fibrinogen-binding protein or peptide of S.<br>
epidermidis, such as SdrG, or a useful fragment thereof, or a protein or fragment with<br>
sufficiently high homology thereto; or<br>
(v) CP8 conjugated to a fibrinogen-binding protein or peptide of S.<br>
epidermidis, such as SdrG, or a useful fragment thereof, or a protein or fragment with<br>
sufficiently high homology thereto; or<br><br>
(vi) PIA conjugated to a fibrinogen-binding protein or peptide of S.<br>
epidermidis, such as SdrG, or a useful fragment thereof, or a protein or fragment with<br>
sufficiently high homology thereto.<br>
In each instance, an immunogenic composition created from any of<br>
conjugates (i) through (vi) is useful to immunize a patient against infection from<br>
coagulase-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, as well as coagulase-negative<br>
bacteria such as S. epidermidis.<br>
In addition to conjugates (i) through (vi) described above, wherein the surface<br>
adhesin carrier protein is a fibrinogen-binding protein, the present invention also<br>
contemplates conjugates wherein the surface adhesin carrier protein is any<br>
staphylococcal surface adhesin protein, such as, for example, fibronectin-binding<br>
protein, collagen-binding protein and vitronectin-binding protein. The present<br>
invention also contemplates that the polysaccharide antigen can be PS/A, PNAG or<br>
PNSG, or other polysaccharide antigens from nosocomial pathogenic<br>
microorganisms, such as S. aureus, S. epidermidis and other CoNS, Enterococcus<br>
spp., Candida albicans, Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella<br>
pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
Many methods are known in the art for conjugating a polysaccharide to a<br>
protein, and are suitable for use herein. In general, the polysaccharide should be<br>
activated or otherwise rendered amenable to conjugation, i.e., at least one moiety<br>
must be rendered capable of covalently bonding to a protein or other molecule.<br>
Many such methods are known in the art. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,356,170,<br>
issued to Jennings, describes the use of periodic acid to generate aldehyde groups<br>
on the polysaccharide and then performs reductive amination using<br>
cyanoborohydride. U.S. Patent No. 4,663,160, issued to Tsay et al„ also used<br>
periodic acid to generate aldehyde groups but then linked the polysaccharide to a<br>
protein derivatized with a 4-12 carbon moiety (prepared in the presence of a<br>
condensing agent) with a Schiff s base reaction in the presence of a reducing agent<br>
such as cyanoborohydride. U.S. Patent No. 4,619,828, issued to Gordon, used<br>
cyanogen bromide to activate the polysaccharide and then conjugated it through a<br>
spacer bridge of 4-8 carbon atoms to the protein. Still other methods of conjugation<br>
are known in the art.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the CP is activated with the<br>
linker 3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionyl hydrazide (PDPH), whereby the carbodiimide-<br>
activated carboxylate groups of N-acetylmannosaminouronic acid in the CP are<br>
coupled to the hydrazide group of PDPH (Fig. 8). The MSCRAMM carrier protein is<br>
activated by bromoacetylation of the lysine residues with the N-hydroxysuccimide<br>
ester of bromoacetic acid (Fig. 7). The PDPH-thiolated CP is then conjugated to the<br>
activated surface adhesin protein by displacement of bromine in the bromoacetylated<br>
protein with thiol, resulting in a stable thioether bond (Fig. 9):<br>
CP - CONHNHCOCH2CH2SCH2CONH - surface adhesin protein<br>
Immunogenic compositions comprising the CP - surface adhesin protein<br>
conjugates of the invention were tested in mice, and were shown to possess<br>
improved immunogenic properties as compared with the poorly immunogenic<br>
unconjugated CP (Figs. 15-20). In addition, both the capsular polysaccharide<br>
specific antibodies and the ClfA and SdrG specific antibodies induced by the CP -<br>
surface adhesin conjugate immunogenic compositions were shown to bind to the live<br>
strains expressing the corresponding antigens (Tables 5 and 6). In light of these<br>
results, it is believed that the immunogenic compositions of the invention will be<br>
useful against nosocomial infections caused by pathogens such as S. aureus or S.<br>
epidermidis. And when the antibodies induced by CP - surface adhesin conjugates<br>
are administered as immunogenic compositions to a wound or used to coat medical<br>
devices or polymeric biomaterials in vitro or in vivo, the compositions will prevent or<br>
inhibit the binding of staphylococcal bacteria to the wound site or biomaterials. The<br>
conjugates that have been processed in accordance with this invention are used in<br>
the preparation of immunogenic compositions to confer protection of a subject<br>
against nosocomial infections. A "subject" as used herein is a warm-blooded<br>
mammal and includes, for instance, humans, primates, horses, cows, dogs and cats.<br>
The conjugates may be added to immunologically acceptable diluents or<br>
carriers in the conventional manner to prepare injectable liquid solutions or<br>
suspensions.<br>
The immunogenic compositions of the present invention are typically formed<br>
by dispersing the conjugate in any suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such<br><br>
as physiological saline or other injectable liquids. As used herein, the language<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is intended to include any and all solvents,<br>
dispersion media, coatings, anrihscteria! and antifungal agents, isaionic and<br>
absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical<br>
administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active<br>
substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or<br>
agent is incompatible with the active compound, such media can be used in the<br>
composition of the invention. For instance, the conjugate preparation is suspended<br>
in sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.0-8.0) at concentrations of 1 to 100<br>
ug of the polysaccharide per ml. The administration of the immunogenic<br>
composition of the present invention may be effected by any of the well-known<br>
methods, including, but not limited to, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intraperitoneal,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal), oral and intranasal. The preferred method<br>
of administration of the immunogenic composition is parenteral administration.<br>
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral administration include the following<br>
components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,<br>
polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents;<br>
antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as<br>
ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and<br>
agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH<br>
can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.<br>
The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or<br>
multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
Immunogenic compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the<br>
extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. In all cases,<br>
the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy<br>
syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and<br>
storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms<br>
such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier is a solvent or dispersion medium containing,<br>
for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid<br>
polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity is<br><br>
maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance<br>
of the required particle size in the case of a dispersion and by the use of surfactants.<br>
Prevention of the action of microorganisms is achieved by various antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid,<br>
thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it is preferable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the<br>
composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions is brought about<br>
by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example,<br>
aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating a conjugate of this<br>
invention in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination<br>
of ingredients provided above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization.<br>
Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a<br>
sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other<br>
ingredients from those provided above. In the case of sterile powders for the<br>
preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are<br>
vacuum-drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus<br>
any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
In certain embodiments, the immunogenic composition will comprise one or<br>
more adjuvants. As defined herein, an "adjuvant" is a substance that serves to<br>
enhance the immunogenicity of an immunogenic composition of this invention. Thus,<br>
adjuvants are often given to boost the immune response and are well known to the<br>
skilled artisan.<br>

The immunogenic compositions of the present invention are administered in<br>
amounts sufficient to provoke an immunogenic response. Dosages may be adjusted<br>
based on the size, weight or age of the individual receiving the immunogenic<br>
composition. The antibody response in an individual can be monitored by assaying<br>
for antibody titer or bactericidal activity and boosted if necessary to enhance the<br>
response.<br>
The immunogenic compositions of the present invention are administered to a<br>
subject to induce a humoral immune response. The subject then acts as a source of<br>
immunoglobulin (hyperimmune immunoglobulin) produced in response to the<br>
immunogenic composition. The immunized subject donates plasma from which<br>
hyperimmune globulin is then obtained, via conventional plasma fractionation<br>
technology, and administered to another subject in order to impart resistance against<br>

The above disclosure generally describes the present invention. A more<br>
complete understanding can be obtained by reference to the following specific<br>
Examples. These Examples are described solely for the purpose of illustration and<br>
are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Purification of the S. aureus CP5 and CP8 Polysaccharides<br>
S. aureus strains Lowenstein (ATCC#49521) and Wright (ATCC#49521) were<br>
used for purification of CP5 and CP8, respectively. The polysaccharides were<br>
purified from the cells by the methods modified from those published previously<br>
(Fournier, Vann et al. 1984; Fournier, Hannon et al. 1987). Cells grown in Columbia<br><br>
broth, supplemented with 2% NaCI were digested for 3 hrs at 37°C with lysostaphin<br>
(175U/g of cells), RNAse, and DNAse (0.1 mg/g of each) for 4 hrs at 37°C, followed<br>
by digestion with pronase (1 mg/g of cells) for 3 hrs at 37°C. The crude CP .as<br>
prepared from enzymatic digest by sequential precipitation with 25% and 75%<br>
ethanol in the presence of 10 mM CaCI2. The CP was then purified from the pellet<br>
by anion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column using a linear<br>
gradient of 0.05-0.5 M NaCI. The residual teichoic acid was oxidized with 0.05M<br>
NalCv After dialysis the CP was then further purified by size-exclusion<br>
chromatography on Sephacryl S300 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,<br>
NJ) column. The presence of the CP in the fractions was determined by reactivity<br>
with S. aureus CP5 and CP8 specific antisera.<br>
PIA was purified from heat-extracted, stationary-phase S. epidermidis cells<br>
and combined with PIA containing culture supernatant as described by Mack, et. al.<br>
(Mack, Fischer et al. 1996). The extracted material and the culture supernatant were<br>
concentrated using a 10K membrane and treated to remove nucleic acids and<br>
residual proteins. Crude PIA was fractionated using gel filtration or diafiltration. PIA<br>
antigen positive material was fractionated further by anion exchange chromatography<br>
to purify the PIA fraction containing ester-linked succinate. The flow-through fraction,<br>
containing non-succinylated and partially non-N-acetylated PIA, was purified by<br>
cation exchange chromatography. The PS/A (PNSG, PNAG) was purified as<br>
described by (Maira-Litran, Kropec et al. 2002) or McKenney, Pouliot et al. 1999.<br>
Example 2<br>
Analysis of S. aureus CP5 and CP8<br>
Chemical characterization of the purified CP5 and CP8 demonstrated that<br>
both polysaccharides were practically free of nucleic acids and residual protein<br>
(Table 1).<br>
Sugar composition determined by HPAEC chromatography revealed the<br>
presence of FucpNAc and ManpNAcA in CP5 and CP8 (Fig. 1). 1H NMR spectra of<br>
O-deacetylated polysaccharides (Fig. 2) were similar to the spectra previously<br>
published (Vann, Moreau etal. 1987; Moreau, Richards et al. 1990), confirming the<br>
structure and presence of three monosaccharides: 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-<br>
mannuronic acid, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-L-fucose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-fucose.<br><br>
Purified CP5, CP8 and TA were immunologically distinct as confirmed by a<br>
single precipitin band in a double immunodiffusion assay when reacted with<br>
corresponding whole cell antisera (data not presented).<br>
Example 3<br>
Purification of surface adhesin proteins<br>
The surface adhesin proteins evaluated were -<br>
-	S. aureus Clf40 (N1N2N3) - full length A domain of Clumping factor A<br>
(amino acids (AA) 40-559) - Fig. 3.<br>
-	S. aureus Clf41 (N2N3) - post protease site fragment of Clf 40 (AA 223-<br>
559) - Fig. 4.<br>
-	S. epidermidis SdrG (N1N2N3) - full length A domain of SdrG (AA 50-597)<br>
- Fig. 5.<br>
-	S. epidermidis SdrG (N2N3) - post protease site fragment of SdrG (AA 273-<br>
597)-Fig. 6.<br>
These surface adhesin proteins were obtained from Inhibitex, Inc., Alpharetta,<br>
GA., USA.<br>
Histag-minus versions of surface adhesin proteins were purified from the £.<br>
coli plasmid host strains. The E. coli pLP1134 BL21 (DE3) was used for S. aureus<br>
CHA41 (N2.N3) and pLP1135 B21(DE3) for S. epidermidis SdrG (M2.N3) purification.<br>
Both proteins were isolated from soluble fractions of cell lysate by ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation and subsequent ion-exchange chromatography on a Sephacryl Q-<br>
Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The purity of<br>
the final material was higher than 90% as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
E. coli cells containing overexpressed S. aureus Clf40 (N1,N2,N3) or Clf41<br>
(N2, N3), S. epidermidis SdrG (IM1.N2.N3) or SdrG (N2.N3) were solubilized in a<br>
single pass through a Microfluidics M110-Y Microfluidizer at about13000 psi. The<br>
cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C.<br>
Overexpressed proteins were purified from the supernatant using an AKTAexplorer,<br>
XK columns Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow and Q Sepharose HP resins (Amersham<br>
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The crude His-tagged protein was purified<br>
from the supernatant by an affinity step with Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow charged<br><br>
with 0.1 M NiCI2. The crude lysate was loaded onto the column equilibrated with<br>
25mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5M NaCI, 5mM imidazole and unbound proteins were eluted<br>
from the column by wasting the column with five column volumes of the buffer. The<br>
bound protein was then eluted with 25mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5M NaCI, 500mM imidazole<br>
buffer and collected in bulk. The protein was then further purified from remaining<br>
impurities by ion-exchange chromatography on a Q Sepharose HP column.<br>
Example 4<br>
Synthesis of S. aureus CP5- and CP8-surface adhesin carrier protein conjugate<br>
immunogenic compositions<br>
S. aureus CP5 and CP8 polysaccharides were separately linked to a surface<br>
adhesin carrier protein provided herein through a thioether bond after introduction of<br>
a thiol group containing a linker to the polysaccharide and a haloacetyl group to the<br>
protein carrier. Bromoacetyl groups were introduced into the surface adhesin protein<br>
by reaction of the amine groups with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of bromoacetic<br>
acid (Fig. 7). To generate thiolated CP, the carbodiimide-activated carboxylate<br>
groups of N-acetylmannosaminouronic acid in capsular polysaccharide were coupled<br>
to the hydrazide group of the sulfhydryl-reactive hydrazide heterobifunctional linker 3-<br>
(2-pyridyldithio)-propionyl hydrazide (PDPH, Fig. 8). Thiols of PDPH-thiolated CP,<br>
generated by reduction with dithiothreitol (DTT) and purified by SEC on a Sephadex<br>
G25 column, reacted with bromoacetyl groups of activated protein resulting in a<br>
covalent thioether linkage formed by bromine displacement between CP and the<br>
protein (Fig. 9). Unreacted bromoacetyl groups were "capped" with cysteamine<br>
hydrochloride (2-aminoethanethiol hydrochloride). The reaction mixture was then<br>
concentrated on an Amicon XM 100 membrane.<br>
Example 5<br>
Characterization of 5. aureus CP5- and CP8 surface adhesin carrier protein<br>
conjugate immunogenic compositions<br>
The conjugate immunogenic compositions were analyzed for CP and surface<br>
adhesin carrier protein contents by quantitation of CP by HPAEC-PAD<br>
chromatography on a Carbo Pac-PA1 column after hydrolysis with 4N trifluoroacetic<br>
acid (TFA). The protein content was determined by Lowry colorimetric assay. The<br><br>
molecular weights of the conjugate immunogenic compositions were determined by a<br>
combination of size exclusion chromatography and multiangle laser light scattering<br>
(MALLS). The results are reported in Tables 2 and 3. The antigenicity of conjugated<br>
CP and surface adhesin proteins was determined by double immunodiffusion (Fig. 10<br>
- 13) and by dot blot analysis (Fig. 14). The results showed that conjugation of CP to<br>
surface adhesin proteins did not alter antigenicity of either CP or protein. The<br>
conjugation of CP to protein was confirmed in dot blot assay by the ability of the<br>
conjugate to bind to a nitrocellulose membrane. The unconjugated CP did not bind a<br>
nitrocellulose membrane.<br>
Example 6<br>
Immunogenicity of CP-surface adhesin carrier protein conjugate<br>
immunogenic compositions in mice<br>
Conjugate immunogenic compositions were tested for the ability to induce<br>
IgG responses to CP5 and CP8 and the surface adhesin protein carrier. Swiss-<br>
Webster mice were immunized subcutaneously (SC) three times in two-week<br>
intervals with a 1 microgram dose (based on CP). The immunogenicity of the<br>
conjugate immunogenic compositions was tested with and without 100 micrograms of<br>
aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant. Individual protein immunogenic composition<br>
candidates were evaluated as well using a similar protocol. The immune response to<br>
S. aureus CPs and surface adhesin protein was assayed one week after each<br>
injection by standard antigen ELISA (see Examples 7 and 8 below).<br>
Example 7<br>
CPs' antibody response in mice immunized with S. aureus<br>
CP5 and CP8 - surface adhesin carrier protein conjugate immunogenic<br>
compositions<br>
The results (Fig. 15 and 16) show that covalent attachment of CPs to surface<br>
adhesin proteins resulted in the induction of a capsular polysaccharide (CP)- specific<br>
IgG response. This demonstrates that the CP T-cell independent immune response<br>
was converted to a T- cell dependent immune response after the coupling of the CP<br>
to the surface adhesin carrier protein. Adsorption of the conjugate immunogenic<br>
compositions to aluminum phosphate increased antibody titers to CP by<br><br>
approximately10-fold, with the exception of the mice administered SdrG (N2N3) as<br>
the protein carrier. Adsorption of CP5- and CP8-SdrG (N2N3) conjugates to the<br>
adjuvant did not result in an increase of immune response to CPs, though the CPs'<br>
antibody response was as good as to the other surface adhesin protein conjugates<br>
mixed (but not adsorbed) with the adjuvant in the study. Deletion of the N1 domain<br>
of ClfA and SdrG did not have an effect on the carrier properties of these proteins.<br>
Example 8<br>
Surface adhesin protein antibody response in mice vaccinated with S. aureus<br>
CP5 and CP8 - surface adhesin carrier protein conjugates<br>
Conjugated surface adhesin proteins induced similar titers of surface adhesin<br>
protein-specific antibodies compared with the unconjugated ones (Figs. 17-20). This<br>
confirms that antigenic epitopes were not modified by the conjugation of surface<br>
adhesin protein to CP. Adsorption of the unconjugated ClfA or CP-ClfA conjugates to<br>
aluminum phosphate resulted in increased ClfA antibody titers in mice compared with<br>
the mice immunized with the same immunogenic compositions without adjuvant. The<br>
mice immunized with unconjugated SdrG responded with lower SdrG antibody titers<br>
compared with mice immunized with CP-SdrG conjugate immunogenic compositions.<br>
Adsorption of the unconjugated SdrG to aluminum phosphate resulted in the increase<br>
of SdrG antibody titers compared to the levels induced by CP-SdrG conjugates<br>
administered without alum. Adsorption of the CP-SdrG conjugates to alum did not<br>
increase the SdrG antibody titers.<br>
Example 9<br>
Recognition of CPs and surface adhesin carrier protein expressed on live<br>
bacteria by CP-surface adhesin protein conjugate-induced antibodies<br>
The binding of the antibodies induced by CP-surface adhesin protein<br>
conjugates in mice to live bacteria was tested by Flow cytometry analysis. The S.<br>
aureus strains employed in the assay are shown in Table 4. For analysis of the<br>
antibodies induced to SdrG conjugates the L. lactis expressing SdrG was used. The<br>
results show (Tables 5 and 6) that both capsular polysaccharide-specific antibodies<br>
and ClfA- or SdrG-specific antibodies induced by CP5- and CP8- surface adhesin<br>
protein conjugates bound to the live strains expressing corresponding antigens. This<br><br>
shows that conjugation of CP to surface adhesin protein does not alter the immune<br>
response towards naturally expressed epitopes present on CP and surface adhesin<br>
protein antigens.<br>
Example 10<br>
Flow Cytometric Analysis Method<br>
The S. aureus strains used were as follows: Newman, a ClfA knockout mutant<br>
of Newman (Newman ClfA::ernr) and Wright (ATCC 49525). To maximize ClfA<br>
expression, S. aureus bacteria were grown to stationary phase in tryptic soy broth.<br>
To maximize capsule expression, S. aureus bacteria were grown overnight on<br>
Columbia 2% NaCI agar (BD Microbiology, Sparks, MD). The Newman ClfA::emr<br>
strain was grown in the presence of 5ng/ml erythromycin to maintain the knock-out<br>
mutation. A recombinant Lactococcus lactis (L Lactis) strain expressing SdrG was<br>
used to evaluate SdrG antigen recognition. The L lactis strain was grown to late<br>
exponential phase in M17 broth in the presence of 5ng/ml erythromycin.<br>
All bacterial cultures were harvested, washed twice in 10ml of cold 1x PBS<br>
(Invitrogen Corp.,RockviIle, MD) and stored on ice prior to analysis. Bacterial<br>
concentrations were adjusted with 1x PBS to OD600nm = 2.0 using a UV-Visible<br>
Recording Spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3000, Pharmacia Biotech, Cambridge,<br>
England). To eliminate non-specific and Protein A mediated binding of mouse IgG to<br>
the cell surface, all of the bacterial preparations were incubated for 30 minutes on ice<br>
in 10ml of a 1:50 dilution (2.32mg IgG) of Rabbit IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) in<br>
1x PBS (Invitrogen Corp., Rockville, MD). To evaluate Type 8 capsule recognition in<br>
the absence of ClfA binding, ClfA epitopes were blocked on S. aureus strain Wright<br>
by an additional 30min incubation with a high titer ClfA specific rabbit antiserum<br>
(Inhibitex, Alpharetta, GA) (1:100 dilution). Following the blocking incubations,<br>
bacteria were washed twice in 10ml cold 1x PBS by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 10<br>
minutes. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 2.5% BSA in 1x PBS (Invitrogen<br>
Corp., Rockville, MD) (PBSA) and stored on ice.<br>
The assay was performed in titertubes (BioRad Labs, Hercules, CA).<br>
Prebleeds and high titer antiserum from test animals were diluted in PBSA and 0.5ml<br>
of each serum dilution was added to the appropriate tubes containing 20ul of the<br>
bacterial suspension. All tubes were vortexed and incubated on ice for 30 minutes.<br><br>
Following the incubation, each tube was vortexed and then centrifuged at 3000RPM<br>
for 10rninutes. The bacteria pellets were washed twice in 0.5ml of cold PBSA. Each<br>
pellet was resuspended in 0.5ml of a 1:200 dilution of PE conjugated F(ab")2<br>
fragment of anti-mouse IgG (H&amp;L) (Rockland Labs, Gilbertsville, Pa). The bacteria<br>
were resuspended and mixed by vortexing. The tubes were incubated on ice for 30<br>
minutes vortexing twice at fifteen-minute intervals. Following this incubation, the<br>
bacteria were washed twice with a final resuspension in PBSA. The tubes were<br>
stored on ice until FACS analysis.<br>
Each titeriube was transferred to a 12 x 75 mm polystyrene tube and<br>
analyzed using a B-D FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Mansfield, MA) flow cytometer.<br>
Results were scored positive if the fluorescence intensity for a given antiserum was<br>
greater than the signal obtained with pre-bleeds at the same dilution. The results are<br>
shown in Table 7.<br>
It should be understood that the foregoing discussion and examples merely<br>
present a detailed description of certain embodiments. It therefore should be<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various modifications and equivalents<br>
can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
