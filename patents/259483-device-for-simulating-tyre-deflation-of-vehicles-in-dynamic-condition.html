PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to device used for providing the dynamic behavior of vehicles and more particularly this relates to device for simulating the tyre deflation condition at the will of the operator in vehicle dynamic condition in order to assess the vehicle behavior from safety point of view of the occupant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Tyre plays an important role as far as vehicle performance is concerned in regard to ride, handling and maneuvering of the vehicle. In view of the advanced forthcoming technologies, which are improving the vehicle performance parameters such as pick up, maximum attainable speed with increased load carrying capacity and also with the upcoming improved infrastructure network within the country. The need of simulating the tyre deflation was felt to assess the vehicle behavior from safety point of view in case of sudden loss of tyre pressure.<br>
In addition to this the regulations of some countries calls for certain requirements of wheel rims in event of rapid loss of inflation pressure. Some of the requirements are as follows:-<br>
Rim shall retain the tyre until the vehicle is brought to rest by application of service brakes. The deceleration of the vehicle shall not be less than 0.2 times the acceleration due to gravity. The deflation of the tyre occurs within three seconds from maximum to minimum tyre pressure.<br>
In order to have a check for safety aspects of vehicles in dynamic condition this invention is devised.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide a device for simulating tyre deflation of vehicles in dynamic condition from maximum to minimum tyre pressure within stipulated time period.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a device for simulating tyre deflation of vehicles in dynamic condition which will help in assessing the vehicle behavior from safety point of view of the occupant during development phase of the new vehicles.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a device for simulating tyre deflation of vehicles in dynamic condition which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Device for simulating tyre deflation of vehicles in dynamic condition comprising of one or more glow plugs, hub cap assembly with insulating rod, conductive adaptor, plate assembly with carbon brushes and pivot mounting bracket with swiveling means, wherein said glow plugs are adopted to be fitted on wheel rim and are in contact with the tube of the tyre, said hub cap assembly with insulating rod is adopted to be fitted on wheel hub; Said conductive adaptor is mounted on said insulating rod, said plate assembly with carbon brushes is fitted at one end to said conductive adaptor and other end is freely located in said pivot mounting bracket, said pivot mounting bracket is adopted to be fitted on vehicle body, said glow plugs and conductive adaptor are electrically connected to each other and said carbon brushes are electrically connected with the battery.<br><br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Device for simulating tyre deflation of vehicles in dynamic condition in accordance with this invention basically comprises of one or more glow plugs, hub cap assembly with insulating rod, conductive adaptor, plate assembly with carbon brushes and Pivot mounting bracket with swiveling means. Wherein said glow plugs are adopted to be fitted on wheel rim and are in contact with the tube of the tyre. Said hub cap assembly with insulating rod is adopted to be fitted on wheel hub; Said conductive adaptor is mounted on said insulating rod. Said plate assembly with carbon brushes comprises of a plate fitted with one or more spring loaded carbon brushes circumferentially on its surface and an insulating support means fitted at one end of said plate. Said plate assembly with carbon brushes is fitted at one end to said conductive adaptor and other end is freely located in said pivot mounting bracket. Said pivot mounting bracket is adopted to be fitted on vehicle body. Said glow plugs and conductive adaptor are electrically connected to each other and said carbon brushes are electrically connected with the battery.<br>
After vehicle achieves a desired steady state speed, the person at the co driver seat will trigger the switch which will allow the battery current to reach at the carbon brushes. The carbon brushes are in continuous contact with the said conductive adaptor which is rotating with the wheel. As the current flows from conductive adaptor to the glow plugs, the glow plugs get heated up. Heating of the glow plug causes tube to be melted at that particular location inducing deflation in the tyre. The number of glow plugs requirement is based on the requirement of intensity of the deflation.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Referring to figures 1 to 7 mentioned above, device for simulating tyre deflation of vehicles in dynamic condition in accordance with this invention basically comprises of one or more glow plugs (3), steel holder (9) welded to Hub cap (13) for accommodating insulating rod (10), Conductive adaptor (2), plate assembly (7) with carbon brushes (8) and Pivot mounting bracket with swiveling means (5). Said Glow plugs (3) are fitted on the wheel rim (6) at the slots made in the said wheel rim such that glow plugs remain in contact with the tube of the tyre (4). Three no of glow plugs are provided in this invention. Hub cap assembly (13 &amp; 9) with insulating rod (10) is mounted on the wheel hub wherein said insulating rod is made up of Nylon. Said conductive adaptor (2) made up of Brass is mounted on<br><br><br>
the insulating rod (10). Electrical connections are made between said Brass adaptor (2) &amp; glow plugs (3) for transferring the electrical current. Carbon brushes (8) are fixed circumferentially on the said plate assembly (7). Insulating tube made up of PVC (11) is connected at one end to the said plate assembly (7) to prevent rotation of the said plate in dynamic condition &amp; other end is freely located in the said pivot mounting bracket with swiveling means (5). Swiveling means used is a ball &amp; socket joint. Said pivot mounting bracket (5) is fitted on the vehicle body (12) with the help of mounting bolts. Electric cables (1) are connected between 12V battery &amp; said plate assembly (7) with carbon brushes (8) through the triggering switch located in the vehicle cabin. Said carbon brushes (8) are rested circumferentially on the said Brass adaptor (2) and always remain in contact with brass adaptor due to spring force. So when above device is mounted on the vehicle as shown in the Figl, the person seating at the co driver position can trigger the switch when vehicle achieves the desirable steady state speed. With this, battery current starts flowing through the carbon brushes (8) to glow plugs (3) via Brass adaptor (2). Due to these glow plugs starts heating up which ultimately causes melting of the tyre tube at the location where glow plugs are in contact with, producing the hole in the tube. This makes rapid loss of inflation pressure simulating the tyre deflation condition in vehicle dynamic condition. Tube valve is further provided with pressure transducer suitably adopted for fitment to measure the rate of drop of inflation pressure.<br>
With above said device, tyre deflation (from maximum to minimum tyre pressure) is achieved successfully within 1.6 sec on vehicle running at 97kmph speed.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is<br><br><br>
intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br>
