				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
In general, embodiment of the invention may relate to a single track vehicle<br>
controlled through use of a control algorithms. In particular an aspect of an embodiment<br>
of the invention relates to automated steering control for achieving dynamic balancing of<br>
single-track vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Generally, Single-track vehicles (motorcycles, scooters, mopeds and bicycles).<br>
enjoy significant advantage over dual-track vehicles (such as cars) in terms of handling<br>
(i.e. maneuverability, acceleration, slalom) and energy efficiency. It is obvious when we<br>
compare a typical single-track vehicle with a typical car: The payload to vehicle weight<br>
ratio is 1/20 for a car, while a typical single-track vehicle (i.e. motorcycle) has a payload<br>
to vehicle weight ratio of 1/2, a factor of 10 better. Although automobiles are typically a<br>
very popular choice for tens of millions of commuters everyday, it may be the most<br>
energy inefficient among all man made transportation tools. Carrying of single individual<br>
of 150 Ib by a vehicle of 3000 Ib is simply gross waste of precious energy resources. Due<br>
to their large front profile and four wheels, cars consume much of their power by the<br>
large aerodynamic drag force and large tire friction force at high speed. Cars are also<br>
much wider than single-track vehicles and need a relatively wide road to operate. As a<br>
result the road system occupies large land resource and is expensive to build for<br>
reasonable flow capability.<br>
Energy and time wasting, environment damaging traffic jams are frequent at large<br>
metropolitans during rush hours. The parking lots also have to be large enough to<br>
accommodate the vehicle sizes. All these contribute to large and wasteful land usage.<br>
The excessive weights of vehicles are also dangerous. Dual-track vehicles take much<br>
more brake force to stop them. In addition, dual-track vehicles also produce a much<br>
larger impact force in an accident. The energy, environment and land resource issues<br>
are compounding in the densely populated developing countries. The transportation<br>
needs of tens of billions of people cannot be met by automobiles due to the large<br>
burdens on the energy, environmental and land resources.<br>
The tremendous reduction of body weight of a single-track vehicle makes its<br>
engine much more effective in propelling it to a reasonable acceleration and speed even<br>
with a much smaller engine power. Single-track vehicle can also be more energy efficient<br>
in reduction of aerodynamic-drag, which is a major energy consumption contributor at<br>
high speed. Since the front profile is much smaller than that of a typical car with an<br>
elongated body, single track-vehicle has much smaller aerodynamic drag force.<br>
Combining this with the fact that most single-track vehicles have two main wheels,<br>
single-track vehicle can cruise at high speed with much reduced energy consumption<br>
rate. They are also environmentally friendlier, use less road and parking resources and<br>
release less greenhouse gas. But typically, single-track vehicles require extensive skill to<br>
ride and are considerably more dangerous for inexperienced riders due to their intrinsic<br>
instability. As a result, the mass population does not realize the potential for high fuel<br>
efficiency, environmental safety and high performance of single-track vehicles.<br>
Several types of light vehicles have been proposed to address the above issues<br>
through either inline two wheels (i.e. motorcycle) with two supporting wheels or three<br>
wheels (tricycle). The first type still requires rider to keep balance in normal riding<br>
condition when the supporting wheels are retracted. Therefore, in general, it still requires<br>
complex skill to ride it. The second type is a compromising solution between car and<br>
motorcycle: It has three wheels to keep balance during slow or stop condition. At high<br>
speed some them can balance the vehicle via active tilt control. For example, in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,765,840 (1998) to Braun from Daimler-Benz, U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,351 (1998)<br>
to Soohoo and U.S. Pat. No. 4,903,857 (1990) to Klopfenstein. Europe and Japan also<br>
granted quite a few patents on this area: 560,670 (European Patent Office) to Putin<br>
(1995) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,039,073 to Matsuura from Honda motor (Japanese Patent).<br>
This type of vehicles are self-balanced like cars. But they are heavier compare with<br>
motorcycles, more expensive to make due to their energy drain hydraulic active tilt<br>
control of the vehicle body and consume more power due to increasing of tire road<br>
friction from the extra wheel. The self-balanced vehicle Segway uses two wheels (left<br>
and right) with a dynamic balance to keep vehicle from falling forward or backward. (U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,971,091 to Kamen et at). The major limitation is its speed and distance<br>
between cnarges. Due to the centrifugal force during turn and high center of gravity,<br>
Segway cannot go fast during turn. That is why its top speed is less than 20 mph.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment"<br>
means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with<br>
the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus,<br>
the appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various<br>
places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same<br>
embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be<br>
combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.<br>
Figures are merely illustrative and are not necessarily drawn to scale or to the<br>
exact shape. Furthermore, it is to be appreciated that the actual devices utilizing<br>
principles of the invention may vary in shape, size, configuration, and the like, other than<br>
what is shown in the figures, due to different implementation, equipment, design<br>
tolerances, or other practical considerations that result in variations from one vehicle to<br>
another.<br>
In general, a single-track vehicle whose dynamic balance is maintained by a<br>
computer controlled steering system is described. In an embodiment, the single-track<br>
vehicle includes a front wheel and a rear wheel attached to a body frame and a computer<br>
controlled steering motor^ The computer controlled steering system receives a user"s<br>
road intention through a steering wheel/handle bar as an input. It combines the inputs<br>
from a sensor subsystem for the state of variables of the vehicle to keep vehicle balance<br>
and faithfully follows the rider"s intending path using an optimal control technique. The<br>
system further improves the safety and performance through an integrated computer<br>
control for braking subsystem, transmission, engine management and active<br>
aerodynamic for a global optimal status. The vehicle system achieves high energy<br>
efficiency and high maneuverability of a motorcycle, while freeing the rider from keeping<br>
the vehicle balanced. The vehicle system provides the rider an easy, truly car-like driving<br>
experience. The vehicle can be powered by gas, electric, hybrid or human sources. A<br>
battery may exist to supply power to the computer control system and actuators.<br>
In an embodiment, a computer-automated dynamic control system to calculates<br>
the control of vehicle steering and leaning angles to achieve robust dynamic balance<br>
equivalent to the function of an experienced motorcycle rider. In an embodiment of the<br>
single-track vehicle, a rider can drive the single-track vehicle like a car: steering wheel<br>
for steering and foot peddles for acceleration and brake. The computer will take over the<br>
control of the vehicle balance just like an expert motorcycle rider. Computer control of a<br>
vehicle may do even better than an experienced human rider can do because the<br>
physical sensor subsystem may be vastly more sensitive and accurate in measuring the<br>
vehicle dynamic status and computer controlled actuators are so much more precise,<br>
fast and powerful in responding to any changes. The computer control may be much<br>
more consistent than that of human control, and yield a vehicle with significantly<br>
improved safety over traditional single-track vehicles (i.e. motorcycles).<br>
Mechanical designs of ordinary single-track vehicles compromise vehicle<br>
performance by the limitations of human control: limitations of the accuracy of sensing<br>
the vehicle dynamic status, response time, and capable torque. New mechanical<br>
designs, which are not bound by the restrictions of human limitations, can improve<br>
vehicle performance significantly. The normal motorcycle front wheel, for example, is<br>
significantly narrower than the rear wheel in order to reduce steering inertia to a human<br>
controllable amount. As a result, the front wheel has less traction than the rear wheel.<br>
This is a serious compromise between steering control and riding safety because during<br>
braking, the front wheel produces about three times stopping power than the rear wheel<br>
due to motorcycle dynamics. Because it combines narrower geometry with the need for<br>
more stopping power, the front wheel is susceptible to losing traction and causing an<br>
accident.<br>
On the other hand, an embodiment of a computer controlled system can be<br>
equipped with a powerful actuator for steering assembly so that the front wheel can be<br>
made the same width as, or even wider than that of the rear wheel for a safer brake. The<br>
integrated computer control system also optimizes overall performance in safety and<br>
easy of use via control of an integrated brake system, supporting wheels, transmission<br>
and motor management, replacing hands (steering by wire) and feet (computer<br>
controlled supporting wheels subsystem for stability for slow or stopped vehicles). The<br>
average rider can then enjoy the nimble handling and high fuel efficiency of a motorcycle<br>
with stability and easy to drive characteristics of a high performance car.<br>
The system may provide rider comfort. Since the rider will lean together with the<br>
vehicle, the effective force (combination of gravitational and centrifugal forces) on the<br>
rider is aligned with the supporting seat, just like in normal motorcycle riding, with zero<br>
lateral force exerted on the rider. While in a car, centrifugal force throws drivers and<br>
passengers left and right during turns in a winding road. Another safety benefit of single-<br>
track vehicle is due to its light weight. During an accident that involves lightly weighted<br>
single-track vehicles, the impact force is much smaller than that of heavy cars. Suppose<br>
we have a dedicated lane for single-track vehicles, then road will become much safer<br>
place.<br>
During low speed maneuvers and some other maneuvers that require extra<br>
stability during stopping and parking, the integrated computer control system can<br>
automatically deploy, for example, up to two extra supporting wheels for more robust<br>
balance. The system provides the rider with a car-like driving experience without having<br>
to focus on balance under riding/driving conditions.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may provide a fuel efficient, low cost,<br>
environmentally safe automated balance system for single-track vehicles, freeing riders<br>
from focusing on balancing the vehicle at any speed under substantially any driving<br>
condition.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may improve the vehicle in terms of<br>
system level performance, safety and ease of operation through an integrated computer<br>
control for steering, balancing, braking, transmission, active aerodynamics and auxiliary<br>
supporting wheels.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may improve vehicle stability from<br>
external disturbances such as sudden weight shift, wind gust, uneven road surface,<br>
slippery patchs etc, at all speeds.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may improve brake effectiveness through<br>
integrated control and providing automatic braking capability. The brake subsystem may<br>
prevent wheel skidding, and keep the vehicle balanced during hard braking, avoiding<br>
vehicle flip-over and fall. The subsystem also detects obstacles through sensors, then<br>
activates brake automatically to avoid collision.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may provide stability for a single-track<br>
vehicle when speed is too low for dynamic balance using, for example, two supporting<br>
wheels, automatically controlled by the computer, which monitors the dynamic state<br>
variables of the vehicle, so that riders don"t have to use their legs for supporting the<br>
vehicle.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may push the performance envelope by<br>
exploring the superior response characteristics of computer control compared with<br>
human control: A computer control system may be more accurate and complete in<br>
detecting the dynamic status of the vehicle and more precise and rapid in processing the<br>
detected information and much more rapid in actuating the control. In this way the<br>
mechanical design compromises commonly found in a singie-track vehicle can be<br>
removed, resulting in vastly improved performance in mechanical handling of a single-<br>
track vehicle system.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may further stabiize the single track<br>
vehicle using active aerodynamic control. Similar to an airplane, an embodiment of the<br>
vehicle has an active rudder and aileron control at high speed. The control activates a<br>
rudder and ailerons according to the vehicle dynamic state to provide high performance<br>
and stability.<br>
An embodiment of the computer control may have a computer with optimal<br>
control of the steering assembly using electric motor sensors, and supporting wheels for<br>
single-track vehicles. The steering of the vehicle may be achieved by a computer<br>
controlled electric motor. The computer, equiped with an optimal control algorithm,<br>
balances and leads to the vehicle to the optimal path defined by the rider"s steering input.<br>
The vehicle system may be further improved by integrating all other controls, i.e. braking<br>
subsystem, motor management, supporting wheel subsystem etc, with the automatic<br>
steering control.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of an example embodiment of an intelligent self-<br>
balanced single-track vehicle.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an intelligent vehicle may be composed of<br>
vehicle body 11, a suspended front wheel 12 that is attached to the front steering<br>
assembly 2, 10 and a rear wheel 13 that is attached to the body. The front steering<br>
assembly 2, 10 and the body are attached with a steering axle 14. A microcomputer 1<br>
serves as the brain for the vehicle balance: it measures the vehicle"s dynamic state with<br>
set of sensors 15,16,17, computes the steering torque in real time to control the body<br>
leaning angle and optimal trajectory according to user"s steering wheel 4 input for<br>
maximum stability. The torque signal from the computer then executes electric motor 2 to<br>
control the steering assembly. In some cases, for example, two supporting wheels 5, 23<br>
can be automatically deployed by the computer to give extra stability at very slow speed,<br>
stopping and starting, or parking conditions. At high speed, the two supporting wheels<br>
may be retracted into the vehicle body and active aerodynamic actuators 6 improve<br>
performance and stability of the vehicle via integrated computer control. The integrated<br>
control is applicable to single-track vehicles driven by a combination of front wheel and<br>
rear wheel, steering by front or rear wheel and powered by gas, electric motor and hybrid<br>
motors.<br>
The above description of illustrated embodiments of the invention, including what<br>
is described in the abstract, is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to<br>
the precise forms disclosed. While specific embodiments of, and examples for, the<br>
invention are described herein for illustrative purposes, various equivalent modifications<br>
are possible within the scope of the invention, as those skilled in the relevant art will<br>
recognize.<br>
These modifications can be made to the invention in light of the above detailed<br>
description. The terms used in the following claims should not be construed to limit the<br>
invention to the specific embodiments disclosed in the specification and the claims.<br>
Rather, the scope of the invention is to be determined entirely by the following claims,<br>
which are to be construed in accordance with established doctrines of claim<br>
interpretation.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of a computer controlled<br>
steering system of self-balanced single-track vehicle.<br>
The auto balance, auto steering of the single-track vehicle can be achieved<br>
through an optimal control technique. The control technique may include an optimal<br>
control algorithm residing in a microcomputer or microcontroller, that calculates the multi-<br>
body dynamics of the vehicle. It also includes a set of sensors 15, 16, 17, 22 for<br>
measuring the state variables of the vehicle system, a force feedback steering wheel 4<br>
for rider input, and a computer controlled electric motor 2 for exertion of torque on front<br>
wheel steering assembly 14.<br>
The sensor subsystem 15, 16, 17, 22 measures the dynamic state variables of<br>
the vehicle system such as speed, steering, roll, yaw and pitch angles and their changing<br>
rates, as well as friction, propelling and braking forces on front and rear wheels. The yaw<br>
rate, roll rate and pitch rate can be measured using three orthogonal mounted<br>
gyroscopes. The three gyroscope sensors are integrated with a microcontroller, three<br>
MEMS accelerometers and three magnetometers to measure the three absolute angles<br>
for roll, yaw and pitch as well their changing rates and is available commercially. The<br>
other variables measured are front and back wheel speed 16 and 17 through two optical<br>
encoders and steering angle through optical encoder 22. In an embodiment, the vehicle<br>
uses two simpler incremental encoders to determine the angular rotation rates of the<br>
wheels. In an embodiment, the vehicle measures the absolute value of the steering<br>
angle. In an embodiment, the vehicle uses an absolute encoder to give the steering<br>
wheel"s angle as well as the wheel"s changing rate. An electric potential meter can be<br>
used to replace 20 for steering angle measurement with reduced accuracy, reliability and<br>
more temperature drift. The random torque exerted on the front wheel from the road is<br>
also measured for vehicle control by a force sensor 30 in FIG. 5 and realistic force<br>
feedback to the steering wheel. The measured real time data from sensors streams into<br>
the microcomputer for the calculation of the optimal steering angle, aiming to keep the<br>
vehicle balanced and following the rider"s intended trajectory, defined by his/her steering<br>
wheel/handle bar input. The feedback control loop of the optimal control algorithm<br>
provides robust stability for all riding conditions including straight running, constant<br>
turning, sudden swerving, lane changing and slaloming under braking or acceleration<br>
conditions.<br>
The dynamic state (i.e. speed, roll and yaw rate, steering angle, etc) of the<br>
vehicle is displayed on a monitor 3 in front of the rider. In addition, our display also show<br>
the information of what a normal vehicle displays: tachometer, speedometer, battery<br>
voltage, temperature gauge, turn signal, high/low beam, odometer/tripmeter, fuel gauge<br>
etc. Since a major portion of the vehicle may be controlled by computers, a flat panel<br>
liquid crystal display (LCD), totally replaces the traditional mechanical analog hands. A<br>
back lighted dot matrix super twisted nematic (STN) provides wide viewing angle, easily<br>
readable under all weather light condition. LCD display offers benefit of reducing vehicle<br>
weight, power consumption and system complexity compares with traditional display.<br>
Its dynamic state vs. time may be stored in a non-volatile memory 36 for later<br>
analysis and record keeping. Similar to a black box for aircraft, the digital memory<br>
records continuously the most recent vehicle status (velocity, roll angle, roll rate, steering<br>
angle, engine status, brake force etc.) and user inputs (i.e. steering wheel angle, brake<br>
pedal pressure). The digital memory may have a "first in, first out" (FIFO) architecture.<br>
With this implementation, the most recent data is substantially always stored for book<br>
keeping. It can also be downloaded from vehicle digital IO 37 into off board computer for<br>
later analysis. Digital 10 of the vehicle is also useful for system diagnostic and upgrade<br>
firmware.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the energy efficient computer controlled intelligent single-<br>
track vehicle may include auxiliary supporting wheel assemblies and a computer control<br>
system. The single-track vehicle may have an elongated body 11 that produces a small<br>
aerodynamic drag. The auxiliary supporting wheel assemblies 5, 23 may mount on both<br>
sides of the vehicle body for static and low speed balance. The computer control system<br>
1 for automatic dynamic balance of the single-track vehicle may use a linear or non-<br>
linear mathematical model of optimal control and an integrated control for the system<br>
brake to keep the balance of the vehicle while slowing down. The computer control<br>
system 1 for automatic dynamic balance of the single-track vehicle may also use active<br>
aerodynamics to modify balancing at high speeds as well as high wind conditions. The<br>
computer control system 1 for automatic dynamic balance of the single-track vehicle may<br>
also control the auxiliary supporting wheels 5, 23 and transmission, engine management.<br>
The single-track vehicle may also include a front wheel 12, and a rear wheel 13<br>
that attaches to the vehicle body frame 11 through a swinging arm suspension, a front<br>
assembly including a fork with telescope type suspension and a steering column 14. The<br>
front assembly and the vehicle body are attached at a revolute joint through the steering<br>
column. The steering and power can be controlled through different combinations of the<br>
front and rear wheels.<br>
The single-track intelligent vehicle uses human-machine interaction and is<br>
designed to feel similar to driving a car. The single-track intelligent vehicle has a steering<br>
wheel 4 for vehicle direction control, foot pedals for acceleration, brakes, clutch (for<br>
manual transmission only), and a right hand operated handle for gear shift (for automatic<br>
or manual transmission).<br>
The computer control system for automatic dynamic balance and system<br>
integrated control may have control software for sensing, processing and actuating of<br>
optimal control for the single-track vehicle, dynamic balancing, integrated braking,<br>
acceleration, transmission, engine control and auxiliary supporting wheels. The software<br>
may be executed by one or more digital microcomputers, ASICs, and/or microcontrollers.<br>
In an embodiment, the software may be a multi-task real time operation system for<br>
managing the software execution that allocates the CPU and memory resource for<br>
various controlling tasks. A steering wheel 4 for user provides an input signal as to the<br>
desired direction into the controlling computer. A steering wheel 4 may have force<br>
feedback to reflect the real road to front wheel interaction.<br>
A sensor subsystem 15, 16, 17 measure vehicle dynamic states and vehicle-<br>
environment interactions and provides input signals to the computer control system for<br>
automatic dynamic balance. An electric motor 2 receives a control signal from the<br>
computer control system for automatic dynamic balance to turn the steering column. A<br>
set of actuators 9, 21 receive a control signal from the computer control system to<br>
execute the control signals for auxiliary supporting wheels.<br>
The control software uses control models that are based on multi-body dynamics<br>
of the realistic vehicle physical descriptions and optimal control 34.<br>
An advantage of the control software is the software calculates dynamic<br>
balancing for the vehicle with optimal control for the current use conditions, integrates<br>
that determination with feed back to optimize the vehicles stability, and follows the riders<br>
desired direction from the steering wheel input.<br>
In an embodiment, the control software may include control models that are<br>
based on neural network such as Cerebella Model Articulated Control (CMAC) with<br>
adaptive and learning capabilities. In an embodiment, the control software may include<br>
control models that are based on fuzzy logic.<br>
Thus, the computer control system receives input signals from sensors<br>
measuring the vehicle"s dynamic status, then the computer processes the sensor"s and<br>
user"s inputs to control actuators to form a closed loop 33 control. The computer control<br>
system may achieve robust stability, even under the influence of random perturbation<br>
such as sudden weight shift, sudden wind gust, uneven road surface, slippery road<br>
patches.<br>
in an embodiment, the computer control system may include an integrated control<br>
which can use different processing models ranging from centralized computing via a<br>
single powerful processor to distributed processing via many interconnected processors,<br>
each one dedicated to one or more specific controlling tasks. The computer control<br>
system may include computer hardware which contains a digital signal process in order<br>
to obtain efficient dynamic calculations for added control. The computer control system<br>
may perform a self-test on the computer hardware, memory, sensors and actuators.<br>
The sensor subsystem may include the status of the vehicle which is measured<br>
by many sensors 15, 16, 17, gyroscopes for body pitch rate, yaw rate, and rolling rate,<br>
inclinometers for rolling angle, force sensors for steering torque and brake torque, speed<br>
sensors, slip sensors for wheel locking during brake.<br>
The computer controlling the integrated brake system may direct the brake<br>
actuators 7, 8 with optimal force to front and back wheels to stop the vehicle in a<br>
controlled manner. The integrated brake system may include the brake actuators 7, 8 of<br>
front and back wheels that are linked with the controlling computer and sensor<br>
subsystem to prevent the wheels from locking or skidding as well as prevent the vehicle<br>
from loss of balance and flipping over. The integrated brake system may detect potential<br>
collisions in the vehicle"s path through proximity sensors 32 and a computed trajectory,<br>
and the computer issues a control signal to activate the brakes and steers the vehicle<br>
away for automatic collision avoidance.<br>
The computer control system may use a control algorithm for the deployment of<br>
the auxiliary supporting wheels 5, 23 at times such as low speed, when stopped, or when<br>
the dynamic balancing needs additional fixed balancing support. The auxiliary supporting<br>
wheels couple to computer controlled arms 27, 28 which are capable of being set at<br>
different angles. The linkage to the system computer so that the arm angles at the left<br>
and right side of the vehicle body can be set according to optimal values of the vehicle<br>
dynamic states, angle position sensors for computer servo control, and a fail safe<br>
mechanism for deployment of the supporting wheels in case the control system fails.<br>
The control algorithm for the supporting wheel sends signals to the supporting<br>
wheel actuators 9, 21 with optimal deployment angles, reads angle sensor feedback to<br>
confirm that the correct angles have been set and that the supporting wheels have been<br>
deployed or retracted according to the system dynamic balance needs. In the control<br>
algorithm for the supporting wheel, when the vehicle stops on an uneven surface, then<br>
the computer senses the surface condition and deploys the supporting wheels 5, 23 at<br>
calculated angles to keep the vehicle body upright. When the rider stops the vehicle<br>
before an immediate sharp turn, the control algorithm for the supporting wheel<br>
communicates to the computer to actuate the supporting wheel arms to create a pre-lean<br>
in the direction of the turn before or when the vehicle starts to move. The auxiliary<br>
supporting wheels system may include a mechanism capable of fast deployment (during<br>
braking) and slower retraction speed (during start).<br>
The integrated optimal control system may include an integrated active<br>
aerodynamic control that directs the aerodynamic actuators 6 for improving stability and<br>
performance according to the vehicle dynamic states, at high speed. The aerodynamic<br>
control allows the computer to take input from the vehicle dynamic status (speed, yaw<br>
rate, roll rate) and actuates a rudder and aileron control 6 to further stabilize the vehicle<br>
at high speeds and during turns. The integrated optimal control system uses a control<br>
algorithm to compute the optimal combination of engine speed and transmission ratio for<br>
vehicle performance and fuel consumption.<br>
The integrated optimal control system may include a display 3 that shows the<br>
state of the vehicle, such as roll angle, steering angle, vehicle speed, engine rate,<br>
steering angle, transmission status, and supporting wheel status, using a flat panel LCD<br>
display. The display 3 shows the actual rolling angle vs. the vehicle rolling angle limit due<br>
to measured road traction and vehicle geometry, so that the rider can be informed to ride<br>
within the vehicle"s limits in addition to the display may illustrate normal vehicle<br>
information such as engine speed, vehicle speed, battery voltage, and temperature. On<br>
the display, when the rider pushes the vehicle control too close to the vehicle"s hard limit,<br>
the system issues a warning in terms of an audible signal and flashes a message on the<br>
display 3. (Example: sharp turn ahead, too fast speed).<br>
The integrated optimal control system uses a safety control program for safety<br>
equipment, such as deployment of airbag, active restraints, collision sensors 32 which<br>
are linked to the controlling computer 1, and actuators for the safety equipment 7, 8.<br>
The integrated optimal control system may include a non-volatile memory that<br>
continuously stores the most recent vehicle system status and user controls for a fixed<br>
period of time, so that the vehicle status and user control can be analyzed later for<br>
debugging and accident investigation.<br>
The integrated optimal control system may include a digital IO system that<br>
performs input and output to outside computers, for firmware upgrade, system<br>
diagnostics and off-vehicle data analysis.<br>
In an embodiment, the physical design of the single-track vehicle hardware is<br>
optimized for computer control characteristics, instead of human rider interaction. The<br>
single-track vehicle may include a solid enclosure with doors or hatch that can help<br>
provide protection against collision, weather conditions and wind.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the control chart for the<br>
control system with discrete time step, nonlinear closed loop optimal control.<br>
In an embodiment, the intelligence of the vehicle, in part, come from its computer<br>
optimal control algorithm (FIG. 3). Optimal control assists in mainataining stability during<br>
operation by use of closed control loop to make the vehicle stable. The vehicle may have<br>
a dynamical system described by a set of coupled non-linear second order differential<br>
algebraic equations (DAEs). The vehicle may be controlled so that it travels close to<br>
user-defined trajectories. The auto-balanced single-track vehicle achieves an optimal<br>
control with random disturbances 35 and statistical noise through a nonlinear control<br>
method. Motorcycle dynamic states can be represented by its yaw, roll and pitch angles,<br>
rotational speeds of wheels, steering angle and front and rear suspension deflections.<br>
From the dynamic behavior of multi-body dynamics of the vehicle, a set of coupled<br>
nonlinear second order differential algebraic equations for motorcycle state variables can<br>
be obtained. This set of DAEs determines the behaviors of the vehicle system. And they<br>
are called dynamic equations. Based on the dynamic equations, the microcontroller<br>
constructs an optimal trajectory 43 aiming to keep the vehicle stable, at the same time<br>
optimally following the rider-defined trajectory 34. Since the system is highly nonlinear, it<br>
is difficult to compute its optimal trajectory due to the restriction of real time and<br>
computer resources. Instead the microcontroller divides the system states into several<br>
smaller domains and linearizes the system using discrete time steps. The nonlinear<br>
optimal control problem becomes several linear quadratic regulators (LQR) 39, each for<br>
a portion of domain. The goal of the control system is to minimize a penalty function,<br>
which is designed to keep the vehicle stable and follow the rider"s intended path as<br>
closely as possible. The feedback loop 33 of the control is very effective in reducing the<br>
impact of random perturbation from road imperfection, wind, modeling and numerical<br>
error and parameter inaccuracies. In an embodiment, the single-track vehicle uses an<br>
optimal control method having balance of inverted pendulum.<br>
Other control methods, such as an artificial neural network (ANN), Cerebella<br>
Model Articulated Control (CW1AC) in particular, and fuzzy control can a\so be used to<br>
replace optimal control method to achieve similar objectives. The effectiveness of an<br>
ANN controller does not depend on detailed and accurate mechanic model of the<br>
vehicle. This can be a major benefit when the system is too complex to build an accurate<br>
model. An additional benefit of ANN is its adaptivity. The control behavior can be easily<br>
and quickly tuned to give optimal response under changing conditions. One example of it<br>
is weight shift of the vehicle. Suppose a load is shifted from one portion of the vehicle to<br>
other, the center of gravity changes. That impacts the vehicle dynamic behavior. By<br>
being able to adapt the change, the vehicle can quickly tune itself to the optimal stable<br>
dynamic states. The vehicle"s dynamic behavior may depend upon training data<br>
The vehicle computer control performs many control tasks (i.e. dynamic balance,<br>
supporting wheel control, active aerodynamics, integrated brake etc.) with a real time<br>
operation system (RTOS) 42. The main purpose of RTOS is to prioritize and manage<br>
CPU and memory resources for different tasks. RTOS may employ a guaranteed time<br>
response so that higher priority tasks are done first under a required time schedule. For<br>
example, the integrate brake control and dynamic balance would be assigned as a<br>
highest priority task.<br>
FIG. 4a illustrates a flow chart of an embodiment of the vehicle control system.<br>
In block 401 the microcomputer calibrates the system. The calibration includes a home<br>
cycle of all encoders and absolute measurement using incremental encoders. The<br>
microcomputer also does a self-test for computer system, wire connections, sensors,<br>
and actuators. If the self-test is not successful the microcomputer aborts the system test<br>
and calls for service in block 402. In block 403, If the test is successful, the<br>
microcomputer reads steering wheel position from rider through an optical encoder. In<br>
block 404 the microcomputer computes the user intended trajectory using his/her<br>
steering information. In block 405, the microcomputer reads vehicle dynamic state such<br>
as roll, yaw and pitch angles and rates, vehicle velocity, vehicle"s actual steering angle.<br>
The vehicle state then classified and assign to a domain in block 406. A specific linear<br>
quadratic regulator is called in block 407 where the microcomputer computes an optimal<br>
control and closed loop feedback stabilization as in FIG. 3. In block 408, the<br>
microcomputer delays until it is time for next time step synchronization and calculation.<br>
Then the microcomputer check the rider power switch in block 409. If user turns off<br>
his/her vehicle, the microcomputer will call stop and parking sequence in block 410,<br>
which evolves slowdown the vehicle, lower the supporting wheels, then turn off computer<br>
control system and vehicle.<br>
FIG. 4b illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the steering<br>
wheel/handle bar assembly of the user control. [0113] The steering whee\ assembly may<br>
be mechanically isolated from the steering assembly (FIG. 4b). It communicates only<br>
with the controlling computer, transmitting the rider"s desire for his/her intended path and<br>
sending a signal for road generated force feedback to the rider. Rider directional input in<br>
real time is geared up and digitized through an optical encoder 20 before been fed into<br>
the computer for control signal calculation. Encoder is a device that translates the<br>
steering shaft rotation motion into an electric signal. The optical encoder 20 offers great<br>
reliability and accuracy used by vehicle control. The steering subsystem may behave like<br>
a car"s steering so that many riders who are already familiar with driving a car can<br>
instantly feel comfort in riding the vehicle. Since a typical car steering wheel can turn<br>
from -540 to +540 degree, the vehicle"s steering wheel turn"s more than 360 degree and<br>
the encoder has to be capable of encoding multi-turn signals. Since our steering wheel is<br>
not connected to a steering assembly and front wheel mechanically, the rider cannot feel<br>
random road force exerted on the front wheel. A force feedback may be added to the<br>
steering assembly to help the user feel like he or she is driving a conventional vehicle.<br>
The force feedback is created by an electric motor 21 and gear assembly. The motor<br>
exerts force to the steering wheel according to the road force measured by sensor 30 in<br>
FIG. 5 mounted on the steering assembly.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the vehicle steering<br>
assembly.<br>
The steering assembly (FIG. 5) may be controlled by a computer through a<br>
brushless electric motor 2 and planetary gears 19 for matching the desired torque and<br>
speed. The brushless DC motor is excellent in terms of reliability, efficiency and size<br>
compared with other types of electric motor. For example, 33 Watts of peak power may<br>
be sufficient for motorcycle steering. A brushless motor uses a speed sensor to generate<br>
the driving sinusoidal voltage to it"s wiring connectors in the correct timing sequence. The<br>
actual steering angle is measured by an optical encode 22 mounted on the steering axle<br>
14. Planetary gear reduces the normal speed of DC motor from typical 3000 rpm down to<br>
30 rpm of typical vehicle steering speed and increases its steering torque at the same<br>
time.<br>
Planetary gear offers high reliability under large steering torque. The controlling<br>
computer continuously reads the encoder signal 22 for steering angle and outputs an<br>
optimal control signal sequence to the steering motor and gear assembly for the proper<br>
torque over real time to achieve the desired optimal path and state control. The motor<br>
and gear assembly then apply torque to steering axle 14 to achieve actual steering<br>
action.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of tne auxiliary supporting<br>
wheel assembly.<br>
When the vehicle is too slow to be dynamically balanced, or during parking, the<br>
controlling computer automatically deploys one or more supporting wheete 5, 23 in GIG.<br>
6 mounted along each side of the vehicle for keeping balance. The one or more<br>
independently controlled wheels can also be used during sharp U-turns, or during high<br>
speed turning for extra stability. Each of the supporting wheels has force sensors 25, 25<br>
for feedback control into the main computer, and independent motors 9, 24 to guarantee<br>
the vehicle stability and that the main force is still distributed to front and rear wheels by<br>
adjusting supporting angle and steering angle. The motors 9, 24 also have built-in<br>
encoders to feed back the actual angles of the supporting wheel arms 27, 28 into the<br>
controlling computer.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of one or two supporting<br>
wheel assemblies in pre-lean condition.<br>
The vehicle body needs to lean at a small angle according to the steering wheel<br>
position during stops for immediate turning, resulting in a more optimal turning trajectory<br>
after the stop (FIG. 7). The computer system achieves this by reading the steering wheel<br>
position from steering wheel encoder 20, computing an optimal lean angle, and actuating<br>
supporting wheel motors 9, 21 to produce the correct amount of body lean angle 29.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of another use for the<br>
supporting wheels.<br>
The arms 27, 29 of the supporting wheels may be independently controlled by the<br>
microcomputer to any angle. This capability can be useful for maintaining balance when<br>
the vehicie is parked on an uneven surface (FIG. 8). The computer reads the tilt<br>
information from an inclinometer mounted on the vehicle body 15, computes the<br>
necessary angles of the supporting arms 27, 28 and instructs the actuators 9, 24 to<br>
achieve an upright position even when the parking lot is uneven.<br>
FlG. 9 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of integrated control for<br>
brake subsystem.<br>
During braking, the system goes one step further than anti-lock brakes. The<br>
microcomputer senses the wheel spin status from the sensors 16, 17 in FIG, 1 mounted<br>
on front and rear wheels, and senses the vehicle body status for possible flip-over (pitch<br>
sensor in sensor group 15 In FJG, 1) or fall (inclinometer 15 in sensor group FIG. 1)<br>
during strong braking. The independent microcontroller 31 for brake control and the main<br>
computer together form a distributed control system. The skidding sensors mounted<br>
directly on front and rear wheels send signais directly to brake controller 31 and it directly<br>
controls the brake actuators for front and rear wheels for fast execution of an ant-lock<br>
function. At the same time main computer 1, which has the knowledge of vehicle status<br>
such as piteh angle, ntf angle and steering ang/e, computes the optimal trajectory and<br>
maximum braking forces for front and rear wheels- that will not destroy vehicle balance. II<br>
communicates the information to the brake controller for activating the brakes. Main<br>
computer 1 also generates an optimal trajectory under the brake condition and directs<br>
the steering assembly 2 to follow it. The main computer can also deploy supporting<br>
wheels with calculated angles in case the system balance cannot be met by dynamic<br>
balance atone. In this way, the vehicle can achieve the shortest possible stopping<br>
distance, in the direction intended by the rider At the same time the vehicle is still kept in<br>
a stable status by dynamic balance and possibly with up to two side supporting wheels<br>
The vehicle can be equipped with an endosuire, air conditioning, and audio<br>
system, just like cars, They offer comfort under different weather condition and crash<br>
protection.<br>
The computer controlled self-balanced motorcycle can inherit all the benefits of<br>
single-track vehicle: power consumption reduction, greenhouse gas reduction, nimble<br>
rnaneuverability, great saving on road and parking resources, and is cheap to make and<br>
maintain compare with automobile At the same time it offers the aability and simply to<br>
operate equally to 4 wheel passenger cars. If widely adapted it will have a large positive<br>
impact on environment, road and parking resource and oil usage for major metropolitan<br>
area and densely populated third world countries.<br>
