LIGHT PHARMACEUTICAL WATER AND THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to human or animal healthcare. More specifically, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical water enriched by light water isotopologue 1H216O and therapeutic compositions and methods thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The pharmaceutical industry places a high priority on the quality of water used in production of finished product, intermediate reagent preparation and analytical processes. Pharmaceutical water quality is regulated by a national pharmacopeia's standards that typically determine the requirements of toxicity, endotoxins, oxidizables, cytotoxicity, and nonvolatile residues. The United States Pharmacopeia (edition USP 23) classifies pharmaceutical water as purified water (PW) and water for injection. (WFI). Purified water is used in the process of production of unit dosage form of drugs. Water for injection is water used for preparation of parenterals. Pharmaceutical water is prepared by specific industrial treatment procedures depending of the type of water.<br>
Natural water is a composition of nine water isotopologues (1H216O, 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O) formed by stable isotopes of hydrogen (1H and 2H) and oxygen (16O, 17O, 18O), wherein the level of light water isotopologue 1H216O is about 99.7317% (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, VSMOW), and wherein<br>
2<br><br>
total level of all eight heavy isotopologues comprising at least one heavy isotopes 2H, 17O, and 18O is about 0.2683% (e.g. 0.199983% 'H2180, 0.0372% 1H217O, 0.031069% 1H2H 16O, 0.0000623% 1H2H 18O, and 0.0000116% 1H2H 17O). Rothman et al.. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 1998. 60, 665. Rothman et al.. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer. 2003. 82. p.9. The abundance of water isotopologues in natural water slightly varies on Earth district and climatic conditions and is expressed typically as the deviation, d, relative to the international VSMOW standard. The natural water enriched maximally by major light water isotopologue 1H2I6O was founded in Antarctica (Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation, SLAP), wherein said 6-values of residual heavy isotopes are d2H -415.5%o, d17O -28.1%o, and d180 -53.9%o that corresponds to the 99.757 % level of light water isotopologue 1H216O. R. van Trigt. Laser Spectrometry for Stable Isotope Analysis of Water Biomedical and Paleoclimatological Applications. 2002. Groningen: University Library Groningen, p. 50. Thus, water with the abundance of light water isotopologue 1H216O more than 99.757% is not found in nature.<br>
Complete depletion of natural water of deuterium-comprising isotopologues (1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O) provides water enriched by light water isotopologue 1H216O to the level never more than 99.76%, since total level of these deuterium-comprising isotopologues in water is below 0.031%. Thus, water with content of light water isotopologue1H216O more than 99.76% can be prepared in industrial scale by methods providing depletion of natural water of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O .<br>
Pharmaceutical water is prepared from natural water by well-known from the art procedures that do not change isotopic content of the starting<br>
3<br><br>
water. Accordingly, pharmaceutical water is the heterogeneous isotopologue composition comprising from about 99.731 to 99.757 % of light water isotopologue 1H2160 and from about 0.243 to 0.269% of residual amounts of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O. In order to produce pharmaceutical water with level of light water isotopologue 'H2160 high than 99.760%, it is necessary to deplete natural water of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
Thus, pharmaceutical water with content of light water isotopologue 'H2160 more than 99.757 % is unknown from the art and can be prepared in industrial scale by methods providing a step of depletion of natural water of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
It is well-documented that light and heavy isotopologues of water have distinct properties and affect distinctly properties of substances in solutions, for example, the rate of biochemical reactions; the enthalpy of association of several binding systems, including protein-carbohydrate, small molecule-small molecule, protein-peptide, and protein-nucleic acid; the thermodynamics (free-energy, enthalpy, entropy and heat-capacity changes) of a ligand binding; the enthalpy of protein unfolding; the thermodynamic stability and formation of functional structures of nucleic acids. Chervenak et al. JACS, 1994, 116 (23): 10533-10539. Makhatadze et al.. Nature Struct. Biol.. 1995. 2 (lOV 852-855. Connelly et al. PNAS. 1994. 91: 1964-1968. Cupane et al.. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980. 8 (18V 4283-4303. So, it is well-documented that heavy and light isotopologues of water affect distinctly on basic properties of substances that typically are used as drugs (proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecules). Accordingly, the isotopologue heterogeneity of pharmaceutical water is undesirable and can affect a drug-<br>
4'<br><br>
dose response. Thus, there is the need in monoisotopologous pharmaceutical water in order to produce drug formulations with more advantageous properties.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical water comprising from about 99.760 to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 'H2160 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide method of producing the pharmaceutical water comprising a step of depleting raw water of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide therapeutic compositions comprising an effective amount of a biologically active agent and the pharmaceutical water, which water comprises from about 99.760 to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 1H2160 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide method of treating a mammal in need thereof, which method comprises a step of administering to said mammal the therapeutic composition comprising an effective amount of a biologically active agent and the pharmaceutical water, which water comprises from about 99.760 to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 1H2,60 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br><br>
FIG.l is a schematic side view of an apparatus for the manufacturing the water comprising from about 99.760 to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 1H216O and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical water, which comprises from 99.760 to 99.999% of light isotopologue 1H2160 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical water" refers to water used in pharmaceutical industry for the production of bulk drugs or manufacturing finished products (e.g. unit dosage form of drugs). Preferred pharmaceutical water of the invention is purified water (PW) and water for injection (WFI). A generally recognized compendium describing the PW and WFI grade pharmaceutical water is United States Pharmacopeia's monograph (current edition USP 23).<br>
As used herein, the term "isotopologue" is in accordance with IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology 2nd Edition (1997) and refers to a molecular entity that differs only in isotopic composition (number of isotopic substitutions), e.g. lH216O, 1H2H16O, and lH218O.<br>
Herein and after, term "light pharmaceutical water" refers to water comprising from about 99.760 to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 'H2160 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O. Relative amounts of particular heavy isotopologues could vary depending upon the procedure of the preparing the water of the invention, but the sum of residual heavy<br>
6<br><br>
isotopologues formed by heavy isotopes should not exceed 0.001 to 0.240%. Accordingly, the residual amounts of heavy isotopes in the water of the invention could vary from 0.01 ppm to 155 ppm for 2H, 1 to 360 ppm for 17O, and 1 to 2000 ppm for 18O, but the sum of heavy isotopologues formed by these residual heavy isotopes should not exceed 0.001 to 0.240%.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a method of producing the pharmaceutical water of the invention comprising a step of depleting raw water of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
The depleting raw water of heavy isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O can be made by methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferred method for the depleting the raw water is a highly-effective distillation. The product of such depleting is light water comprising from about 99.760% to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 'H^O and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O. The light pharmaceutical water is prepared from such light water by the methods well-known to those skilled in the art, which methods comprise steps of treating the light water such as pre-treatment, (e.g. primary filtration, coagulation and flocculation, desalination, and softening), disinfection, reverse osmosis or deionization, distillation or ultra-filtration, and chemical and microbial testing of a water sample. In accordance with the USP monograph (USP 23), purified water (PW) is obtained by distillation, ion-exchange treatment, reverse osmosis, or other suitable process and water for injection (WFI) is obtained by distillation or reverse   osmosis.   In   practicing  the  invention,   the   sample   of light<br>
7<br><br>
pharmaceutical    water    should    meet    requirements    of   a    national pharmacopeia's standards, for example, the US Parmacopeia's standards.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a therapeutic composition comprising an effective amount of a biologically active agent and the pharmaceutical water, which water comprises from about 99.760 to about 99.999% of light isotopologue 1H2l60 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a method of administering a biologically active agent to a mammal in need thereof, which method comprises a step of administering to said mammal the therapeutic composition comprising an effective amount of a biologically active agent and the pharmaceutical water, which water comprises from 99.760 to 99.999% of light isotopologue 1H2l60 and up to 100% of residual isotopologues 1H217O, 1H218O, 1H2H16O, 1H2H17O, 1H2H18O, 1H216O, 1H217O and 2H218O.<br>
