TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
MANUFACTURE OF BUILDING BLOCKS FROM INDUSTRIAL WASTE AND USES THEREOF<br>
APPLICANT<br>
VISVESVARAYA NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, NAGPUR, 440 010,<br>
INDIA<br><br>
MANUFACTURE OF BUILDING BLOCKS FROM INDUSTRIAL WASTE AND USES THEREOF<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for the manufacture of shaped building blocks from selected industrial wastes. More specifically, the invention relates to a method for producing high strength blocks of precise dimensions and desired properties from cellulose product recycle industry waste (CPRIW) , fibrous cellulose product processing industry waste (FCPPIW) ,High Molecular weight polymer industry effluent (HMPIE) , plastic waste, Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) sludge , natural and synthetic polymer processing waste and related products.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Bricks are the building blocks for any masonry work. The term brick refers to small units of building material, often made from fired clay and secured with mortar, a bonding agent comprising of cement, sand, and water. Bricks hold the property of being a popular material for buildings, retain heat, withstand corrosion, and resist fire.<br>
Natural clay minerals, including kaolin and shale, make up the main body of brick. Small amounts of manganese, barium, and other additives are blended with the clay to produce different shades, and barium carbonate is used to improve brick's chemical resistance to the elements. Many other additives have been used in bricks, including byproducts from papermaking, ammonium compounds, and wetting agents.<br>
Conventionally, the bricks made of concrete have specific materials, strength, and design. Concrete, generally used as a structural component consists of cement with fine and/or coarse aggregates that have adjusted granule sizes. These conventional<br><br>
bricks weigh about 2.5 to 3.0 kg each. Thus, there is a possibility of exploring newer materials   for making building blocks for construction purposes.<br>
Due to the rapidly diminishing availability of suitable landfill space and the escalating cost of land, the daily generation of large volumes of different types of solid wastes from industries has created a costly disposal problem throughout the world. Literature search shows some applications of such industrial wastes in construction.<br>
a.	U.S. Patent No. 5,211,750 describes use of fly ash, sludge, lime and water to<br>
yield an aggregate having a compressive strength in the range of 1,000-4,000<br>
psi.<br>
b.	U.S. Patent No. 4,397,801 describes use of fly ash to make shaped masonry<br>
block which is subsequently crushed to create an aggregate used as a<br>
constituent in concrete, mortar mixes, and road base materials.<br>
c.	Similarly, United States Patent 5018459 describes a method and apparatus<br>
for recycling paper pulp sludge, wherein the resultant product could be used in<br>
the manufacture of construction products such as concrete, asphalt and<br>
others; or in gravel-based construction operations; or in earthen-fill<br>
constructions operations; or in other ways.<br>
d.	US patent 6,068,803 describes a method of making a building block from<br>
waste particulate siliceous materials, such as fly ash.<br>
e.	U.S. Patent 4,683,006 discloses a low strength, crystalline-bonded shaped<br>
construction aggregate produced by mixing pulverized fly ash with lime.<br>
f.	U.S. Patent 3,501,323 discloses a process for the manufacture of building,<br>
structural, and paving products by blending extremely fine siliceous material, a<br>
calciferous material, and water and molding the blend into desired bricks.<br>
g.	U,S. Patent No. 5,665,290 describes the addition of ground waste glass to a<br>
clay-containing material to enhance the stability of the pressed brick shape.<br>
h.  Korean Patent KR 20080113170 describes a retaining paper brick.<br>
i.   A literature survey of Indian patents indicated lack of research in this area.<br>
For construction of any building, a skeleton of concrete pillars reinforced with iron bars and wires are used. Thereafter, bricks are used for forming partitioning or walls. Thus, these bricks should ideally be lightweight, with tiny air pockets inside to act as a thermal insulation and to aid in shock absorption. Whatever be the raw material for<br><br>
brick manufacture, as of date, the structures constructed with help of conventional bricks are vulnerable to earthquakes. There is still a need for making buildings out of such material, which is sturdy and lightweight, and at the same time offering resistance to earthquakes.<br>
Improper solid waste disposal of small scale chemical process industries has resulted in their being brought under "most polluting sector" classification by Central Pollution Control Board. Major pollution problem being faced by these industries is the treatment solid and sludge waste. The use of solid waste for making value added products would be a solution to solid waste management. This will serve as an additional source of revenue, generate employment for the unskilled labor and have desirable enviro-socio-economical impact. The waste is a potential raw material for making building blocks useful In seismic zone as also for making earthen wares and decorative items<br>
Thus, to overcome the drawbacks in the prior art as also to solve the problem of waste disposal, there is a need for the manufacture of high strength building bricks and blocks of precise dimensions and desired properties from, CPRIW, FCPPIW, HMPIE plastic waste, Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) sludge , natural and synthetic polymer processing waste and related products., with the said building blocks lacking brittleness, having energy absorbing ability, being light weight, shock proof, and having the properly of thermal insulation and sound absorption.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the main object of the present invention is to manufacture high strength building bricks and blocks of precise dimensions and desired properties from CPRIW, FCPPIW, HMPIE plastic waste, Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) sludge natural and synthetic polymer processing waste and related products, with the said building blocks lacking brittleness, having energy absorbing ability, being light weight, shock proof, and having the property of thermal insulation and sound absorption.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Major pollution problem being faced by small scale process industries is the treatment solid and sludge waste. The use of waste as brick material would be a solution to solid waste management, alternative raw material and an additional source of revenue. It will help generate employment for the unskilled labor and have desirable enviro-socio-economical impact. The bricks thus manufactured are lightweight with an average weight of approximately 500 grams each as compared to the conventional bricks weighing around 2.5 to 3.0 kg each, with presence of tiny air pockets inside to help in thermal insulation and shock absorption. The buildings made from such bricks would thus be resistant to earthquakes and can be used in earthquake-prone regions.<br>
To meet the above objects and to overcome the problems existing in the prior art, the present invention describes manufacture of high strength building bricks and blocks of precise dimensions and desired properties such as lacking brittleness, having energy absorbing ability, being light weight, shock proof, and having the property of thermal insulation and sound absorption from CPRIW, FCPPIW, HMPIE plastic waste, Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) sludge , natural and synthetic polymer processing waste and   related products, said process comprising:<br>

The series of tests were carried out according to ASTM C 67-03a to determine water absorption, specific weight, compressive strength, flexure strength, voidage and equilibrium moisture content.<br>
i.    It was observed that voidage of the brick sample increased with increase in<br>
CPRIW content, ii.   The specific weight (gm/cc) of all the samples was very small (0.3-0.6) as<br>
compared to convention brick (1.9-2). As expected the specific weight of brick<br>
was inversely proportional to CPRIW percentage, iii. Equilibrium moisture content of dry brick was directly proportional to CPRIW<br>
content. Because of the fibrous nature, the CPRIW had higher water retention<br>
ability. iv. The dry compressive strength of brick samples was determined using UTM. All<br>
brick  samples  showed  excellent  compressive  strength   (3.5±2   MPa)  as<br>
compared to conventional brick (3±0.5 MPa). Because of fibrous nature of the<br>
raw material, the brick under compressive load shrunk but did not break. The<br><br>
reported values are the maximum load the UTM can apply on the CPRIW brick<br>
sample, v.  The two water absorption terms corresponding to the volume and the mass of<br>
samples were calculated. Because of high voidage and cellulosic nature, the<br>
water absorption was directly proportional to CPRIW content, vi. All samples can withstand a temperature of 250 ° C for around 30 min. The<br>
brick samples exhibited excellent sound absorbing ability and can be used in<br>
making soundproof rooms.<br><br>
