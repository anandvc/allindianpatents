				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A header object (210) for a data file (200) is comprised of sub-objects (220, 230, 240, 250) which specify properties of the data stream and contains information needed to properly verify and interpret the information within the data object (290). In order to allow the protection of any set of sub-objects(220, 230, 240, 250) without requiring that the sub-objects (220, 230. 240, 250) follow any specific ordering, a new sub-object (260) is introduced which includes region specifiers (264) identifying regions within sub-objects (220, 230, 240, 250) and verification information for those regions. This new sub-object (260) in the header object (210) allows the modification of non-protected regions and reorganization of sub-objects (220, 230, 240, 250) in a header without invalidating verification information.</td>

				<td>Data Stream Header Object Prota nog<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates generally to data venficatiori and more particularly to a header object for a data file.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Convcnnonally, some data file and data stream formala in lude header objects. The header object includes "mexa-coment" information used for identirying and using the cootcnt data included in the data file or data stream.<br>
for example, one dau stream format is the Advanced Streaming Format (ASF), which U an exTenaible rile format designed to store coordinated multimedia data. The current specification for this format is available from wwwnricrosoft.com  ASF supports data delivery over a wide variety of networks and protocols while allowing for le cal playback.<br>
Each ASF file is composed of one or more media streams.  the header object specifics the properaes of the enare file, along with stream-specific properties.   In ASF, each file must have one header object. The header object provides a well-known oyte sequence at the beginning of ASF files (the header object GUTD (globally unique iiiendfier)) and to contain all the information needed to properly interpret the multimedia data. 1 he header object may be thought of u a container thai contains header object information an a combination of header sub-object*. The header object information consist* of a GU1D for the header object ("ASF_Header_object, the sue of the header object, and the numoer of header sub-objects contained in the header object. Each header object begins with a Gt JTD<br>
Header sub-objects include:<br>
•	A file properties sub-object, which defines the global characts risacs of the multimedia dau in doe file;<br>
•	A stream properties sub-object, which defines the specific pi operties and characteristics<br>
of a media stream;<br>
•	The header extension sub-object, which allows additional functionality to be added ro an ASF file while maintaining backwards compatibility, and .s a container containing extended headeT sub-objects;<br>
•	The codec list sub-object, which provides user-friendly imormaiion about the codecs and formats used to encode the content found in the ASF file;<br>
•	The script command sub-object, which provides a list of r\ peparamiter pairs of Unicode strings that art synchronized to the ASF file's timeline;<br>
•	The marker sub-object, which contains a small, specializen index thai is used to provide named jump points within a file to allow a content author u divide content into logical sections, such as song boundanct in an entire CD or topic changes during a long presentation, and to assign a human-readable name to each section of a file for use by the user,<br>
•	The bitratc mutual exclusion sub-object, which identifies video streams that have a mutual exclusion relationship to each other (in other words only one of the streams within such a relationship can be streamed and the rest are ignored);<br>
•	The error correction sub-object, which defines the error cot,Action method and provides lnformaucra needed by the error correction engine for recovcry;<br>
•	The content description sub-object, which permits authors to record well-known data describing the file and its contests, including title, author, copyright, description, and rating information;<br>
•	The extended content description sub-object, which permits authors to record data describing the file and its contents that is beyond the standard bibliographic information such as title, author, copyright, description, or raring information;<br>
•	The content encryption sub-object, which identifies if the coatcm is protected by a digital rights management (DRM) system. This sub-object include the DRM license-acquisition URL, the DRM Key ID, and other DRM-related metadata.<br>
•	The scream bitrare properties sub-objecr, which defines the average birrate of e3ch media stream in the multimedia data; and<br>
•	A padding sub-object, which is a dummy sub-object useci to pad out the size of ihc header object.<br>
The entity wruch first creates the data stream file and any successive entities acting on it may add or change elements of the header file. For example, a content-creating entity may create a data stream file, and include information in the content description object regarding the content. A second entity may create markers within the data, and wish to add a marker object with track information. And a third entity, which distributes the data strean: file, may add a script command object containing actions or data for scripts. For example, a script command object may contain information that opens a web browser window to a sjwcified URL (uniform resource locator).<br>
Because a number of entities may act on an ASF file, there is no way to determine which entity has created which part of the header object. Additionally, a change of information by an attacker cannot be identified.<br>
Summary Of The Invention:<br>
The present invention is directed to a system, method, and data structure for the verification of sub-objects in a header object The invention allows for verification by one entity of one or more sub-objects in the header object while still allowing the ordering of sub-objects to change. New sub-objects can also subsequently be created and vei lfied by another ennry. The verification of two or more sub-objects by a trusted entity may be combined, so that an art acker can not remove or change data leaving one sub-object verifiable as having been signed by the trusted entity while the other sub-objecx is not verifiable.<br>
Addinonal features and advantages of the invention are set forth in the description below<br>

It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications lins between the computers may be used.<br>
Pipul Signature Sub-Objects<br>
Where a header object includes sub-objects and regions of sub-objects to be protected, according to the invention, a digital signature sub-object may be a-tded to the neader id order to allow verification that the sub-objects and regions signed have not been tampered with- This digital signature sub-object may be based on any digital signing algorithm that takes as input some data and produces a signature that can later be verified. In o.te embodiment, the algorithm used is the RS A algontbm. In another embodiment, the elliptic cu/ve algondun is used. Other embodiments may use other signature algorithms.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, file 200 contains a neader object 210. in addition to header information 215, header object 210 contains a file properties sub-onject 220, a stream properties sub-object 230, a script command sub-object 240, and content desc ription sub-object 250. Content description sub-object 250 contains information on title 25 2, atuhor 254, copyright 256 and description 258 of the content Script command sub-object 24o contains a URL 245. File 200 also contains data object 290. This figure is exemplary, and it will be recognized that other combinations of sub-objects may be present in the header object rulaer dwn those shown.<br>
An endty may prevent tampering with pans of the header obiect 210 by adding digital signarurc sub-object 260. Digital signature sub-object 260 contains region specifier array 264 and signature 266. In one embodiment, digital signature sub-object 260 also contains signer<br>
information 268. Ln one embodiment, signer information 268 contains one or more certificates a hich can be used to securely verify the signature 266<br>
The process for creating a digital signature sub-object 260 ;s shown in FIG 3. As shown in step 110, the entity decides which one OT more regions of header sub-objects it is going to sign and determines the region specifiers for these regions. For example, with reference to FIG 2. the regions to be signed may include the script command sub-object 2 10 and the title, author, and copyright sections of the content description sub-object 250  Refe nng again to FIG. 3, in step 320, the region specifier array 264 (from FIG. 2) is created. In stev 330, the regions specified in the region specifier aoay 264 are concatenated (m the order in whkb they are specified in the region specifier array 264) along with the region specifier array 264. This region is then signed 340 to produce signature 266 (from FIG. 2).<br>
When a file containing a header object including a digital signature sub-object is modified, the order of the sub-objects may be changed and addiuoi.al sub-objects may be inserted. If additional regions or sub-objects are to be verified, a new digital signature sub-object may be added-<br>
With reference to FIG. 2, in order to check the verification of the header object 210, the digital signature sub-object 260 and the regions specified in the region specifier array 264 are used As shown in FIG. 4, step 410, the header sub-object regions peeified in the region specifier array 264 (from FIG. 2) are identified- In step 420, these regions are concatenated (in the order in which they are specified in the region specifier array 264) together with the region specifier array 264. In step 430, signature 266 (from FIG. 2) is chet ted to determine whether it is a valid signature for rite concatenation.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, both regions of sub-objects and complete sub-objects may be signed using the digital signature sub-object. In another embodiment, only complete sub-objects may be signed.  In one embodiment of the mv soaon, more than one region from a single sub-object may be signed in one digital signature sub-rbject   In one embodiment of the invention, the regions of one sub-object being signed may ovtrlap.<br>
In one embodiment of ihe invention, each header object m.ist contain at leasr one digital signature sub-object.   If the header object does not contain a digital signature sub-objeci when one is expected, then it can be assumed that the header object has been tampered with. If the header object contains a digital signature sub-object that does not verify correctly or is not from a trusted source, the entity receiving the file containing the header object may act accordingly, for example, in one implementation, by not using the file. According .o this embodiment, a check is performed to see if any digital signature sub-objects exist. If none exist, then verification fails If sub-objects do exist, each one is checked to yield a verification result.<br>
In one embodiment, any file F that is a collection of objects Ov, 02,.. O0 may be signed according to the invention. A new object O04, ia created which inchlidea a region specifier array specifying the objects or regions of objects signed and a signature tor those objects and the array<br>
Exemplary ASF Implementation<br>
In one embodiment, the file is an ASF file. The components of a digital signature sub-object for an ASF file, in one embodiment, is shown in FIG. 5. Digital signature sub-object 500 includes a GUTD 510. Each object and sub-object in an ASF file begins with a GUID. GUIDs are used to uniquely identify all objects types within ASF files. Etch ASF object type has its own unique GUID However, in general, GUIDs cannot be used to uniquely identify sub-objects within an ASF Header object since multiple sub-objects in an ASF 1 leader object may have the same object type, and thus have the same GUID<br>
The next element in the exemplary ASF digital signature sut-object 500 is the sub-object size S20. Again, all ASF objects and sub-objects generally include toe sue of the object and sub-object. The region specifier array 540, as described above, is preceded by the number of signed regions conwuned in the region specifier array 530. The checksum algorithm identifier 550 and the signature aigonuim identifier 560 identify the checksum and signature algorithms used in the digital signature sub-object. The signature 580 of the regions and the region specifier array is preceded by the length of the signature 570, Signer mrormahon 590 contains information <br>
to verify or obuun information regarding the signer. Signer infor nation 590 may include the identity of the signer. In one embodiment, signer information 59, contains a certificate chain that can be used to verify che public key of the signer is from a trusted source.<br>
In ihe exemplary A$F implementation, each region specil.er contains a sub-object region offset, a sub-object region size, a checksum length and an object - hecksura. The region offset identifies where the region starts in the sub-object, and the region size identifies the sue of the region. The object checksum corresponds to the checksum of the region specified. This checksum algondim, in a preferred embodiment, is the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) algonthm. This algondim is available in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 180-1, which is available on the Internet at http://wwwjrj.nist.y)v/fipspubs/fip 180-1 htm. In alternate embodiments, any hashing algorithm with a low probability of collision can be used. In an alternate embodiment, the object checksum corresponds to the checksum of the sub-object containing the region specified.<br>
When the signature is being checked, in order to determine which sub-object the region is located in (as in step 410 of FIG- 4), the header sub-objects are examined. For each sub-object being examined, a checksum is computed according to the algontin specified in the checksum algohdim identifier 550. In the embodiment where me checksum is computed over the region, a checksum is computed for the data contained in that sub-object which begins at me given sub-object region offset and extends to be the given sub-object region oze. In me embodiment where the checksum if computed owr the entire sub-object, a checksum i computed for the sub-object.
