The present invention relates to a rear parcel shelf which is provided in a rear portion of a motor vehicle compartment.<br>
In a rear portion of a motor vehicle compartment there is provided a rear parcel shelf which extends between right and left side panels.  On top of the shelf there is disposed an internal finish material so that the shelf can be used as a space for placing parcels thereon.<br>
For the purpose of reinforcement, the conventional rear parcel shelf is provided on a bottom surface thereof with a rear stiffener on the side of a rear edge, a front stiffener on the side of a front edge, and a central stiffener in a laterally central position.  In this specification, "lateral" means right and left direction and "longitudinal" means front and rear direction, respectively, of the motor vehicle.<br>
Since the above-described conventional rear parcel shelf must be provided with various stiffeners, its weight becomes large and the cost becomes high.<br><br><br>
In view of the above-described disadvantages in the conventional rear parcel shelf, the present invention has an object of providing a rear parcel shelf which can secure a required strength even if the front stiffener and the central stiffener are omitted, thereby attaining a reduction in weight and cost of the rear parcel shelf.<br>
In order to attain the above-described object, the present invention is a rear parcel shelf to be disposed in a rear portion of a compartment of a motor vehicle, characterized in: that a plurality of dented portions are formed in a shelf main body so as to extend in a longitudinal direction of the motor vehicle; that a stepped portion having a stepped cross section with a front side being lowered in elevation is formed in a front . edge of the shelf main body; and that at least part of the dented portions are extended down to and throughout a lower step part of the stepped portion.<br>
According to the present invention, the bending rigidity in the longitudinal direction of the shelf main body can be increased by the dented portions that extend in the longitudinal direction of the motor vehicle. Further, by extending part of the dented portions down to and throughout the lower step part of the stepped portion, the stepped portion can be reinforced.  As a result, the bending rigidity in the lateral direction of the front edge portion of the shelf main body can also be increased<br><br>
 the stepped portion.<br>
In this manner, even if the front stiffener and the central stiffener are omitted, a required strength can be secured.  The rear parcel shelf can thus be reduced in weight and cost.<br>
There are cases where a harness for tail lamps or the like to be wired from the motor vehicle compartment to a trunk room is fixed to a bottom surface of the rear parcel shelf by means of clips.  In such a case, clip     mounting bases are conventionally formed in suitable positions of the shelf main body to thereby engage the clips into engaging holes which are provided in the clip mounting bases.  However, in case the dented portions are formed as in the present invention, the bottom surface of the dented portions may have therein engaging holes for engaging therewith clips for the harness.  In this manner, clip mounting bases need not additionally be formed, resulting in an advantage in point of manufacturing cost.<br>
In addition, below the rear parcel shelf there is laterally provided a torsion bar which urges a trunk lid open.  In order to prevent the harness to be laid along the bottom surface of the rear parcel shelf from contacting the torsion bar at the crossing point of the torsion bar and the harness, there is conventionally provided a harness protector on the bottom surface of the rear parcel shelf.  However, if there are formed penetrating holes in the bottom surface of any suitable<br><br>
one of the dented portions according to the present invention, it becomes possible to pull up the harness through the penetrating holes at the crossing point of the torsion bar and the harness to thereby dispose it inside the dented portion. The harness protector to prevent the interference between the torsion bar and the harnesses becomes needless, resulting in a further cost reduction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a rear parcel shelf to be disposed in a rear portion of a compartment of a motor vehicle, characterized in: that a plurality of dented portions are formed in a shelf main body so as to extend in a longitudinal direction of the motor vehicle; that a stepped portion having a stepped cross section with a front side being lowered in elevation is formed in a front edge of said shelf main body; and that at least part of said dented portions are extended down to and throughout a lower step part of said stepped portion.<br>
The above and other objects and the attendant advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of one example of a rear parcel shelf according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line II-II is Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along the line EH-III in Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along the line IV-IV in Fig. 1.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes a rear parcel shelf which is provided to extend between the right and left side panels. It is made up of<br><br>
a press-formed shelf main body 2 of a thin plate make and a rear stiffener 3 which is mounted, as shown in Fig. 2, on a bottom surface of a rear edge portion of the shelf main body 2.<br>
In the shelf main body 2 there are formed a pair first, second and third dented portions 41, 42, 43, each in a right and left symmetrical pair.  There are further provided, in a portion near the center of the shelf main body 2, fourth and fifth asymmetrical right and left dented portions 44, 45.  In the front edge of the shelf main body 2 there is formed a stepped portion 5 having a step-like cross section with the front side being lowered in elevation.  The first, second and fourth dented portions 41, 42, 44 are arranged to extend down to and throughout a lower step part 5a of the stepped portion 5. Near the central portion of the shelf main body 2 there are formed sixth and seventh dented portions 46, 47, which extend from the neighborhood of the front edge down to and throughout the lower step part 5a of the stepped portion 5.  The rigidity of the stepped portion 5 is thus increased.<br>
In this manner, the bending rigidity in the longitudinal direction of the shelf main body 2 is secured by the dented portions 41 ... 45 and the bending rigidity in the lateral direction of the shelf main body 2 is secured by the rear stiffener 3 and the stepped portion 5. Therefore, even if the front stiffener and the central<br><br>
stiffener, which are requisite in the conventional art, are omitted, a predetermined strength can be obtained.<br>
In the bottom surfaces of the first, second and sixth dented portions 41, 42, 46 there are formed engaging holes 8 for engaging therewith clips 7 which are used to fix a harness 6 as shown in Fig. 3.  It is thus so arranged that the harness 6 for tail lamps or the like to be wired by extending from the motor vehicle compartment to a trunk room can be fixed to the lower surface of the rear parcel shelf 1 by means of the clips 7.<br>
Under the rear parcel shelf 1 there is laterally disposed a torsion bar (not illustrated) for urgingly holding a trunk lid open.  In the bottom of the fifth dented portion 45 there are formed a pair of penetrating holes 9 for the harness 6 in front and rear of the position where the torsion bar is laterally disposed.  The harness 6 is pulled upwards through the penetrating hole 9 on the front side and is pulled downwards through the penetrating hole 9 on the rear side so that the harness 6 is contained inside the fifth dented portion 45 as shown in Fig. 4.  The harness 6 is thus prevented from interfering with the torsion bar.  Since the internal finish material 10 is laid on top of the rear parcel shelf 1, there is no possibility that foreign matters come into abutment with the harness 6.  Further, in the longitudinally central portion of the bottom surface of the fifth dented portion 45 there is formed a clip engaging hole 8'.  A clip for the<br><br>
harness 6 is engaged from an upper side into the clip engaging hole 8' to thereby prevent an undesired movement of the harness 6 inside the dented portion 45.<br>
By the way, depending on the owner of the motor vehicle, he may wish to mount loud speakers in the rear parcel shelf.  In order to meet such a requirement, in the conventional art, holes for mounting therein the loud speakers (also called speaker-mounting holes) are formed in the process of forming the shelf main body of the rear parcel shelf.  If loud speakers are not mounted therein, a supporting member to lie across each of the speaker-mounting holes for supporting the internal finish material is provided to thereby prevent the internal finish material to lie spread on the rear parcel shelf from being dented in the speaker-mounting holes. This solution however results in a higher cost.  Therefore, in the illustrated embodiment, there is provided, in the portion to form each of the speaker-mounting hole, a cover portion 11 which is integrally formed with the shelf main body 2. In the periphery of the cover portion 11 there are formed a plurality of slits 12 while leaving uncut portions 12a (i.e., portions left uncut).  In case the loud speakers are mounted, the cover portions 11 are removed by cutting away the uncut portions 12a to thereby provide speaker-mounting holes.  According to this arrangement, the supporting member to support the internal finish material becomes needless, resulting in a cost reduction.  Although<br><br>
the slits 12 may also be formed in an arcuate shape, a punch die is easier to be manufactured and is therefore more advantageous from the viewpoint of manufacturing cost if the slits 12 are formed in straight lines as illustrated.<br><br><br>
