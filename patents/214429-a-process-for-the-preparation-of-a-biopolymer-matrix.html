				<td>This invention relates to alginate dialdehyde (ADA) crosslinked gelatin and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
This invention further relates to alginate dialdehyde crosslinked gelatin as a wound dressing material.<br><br>
Large scale bum wounds and other open wounds with skin loss often require treatment within temporary dressings. Their main functions are :<br>
1.	Reduce the evaporation of water from the wound bed and associated energy loss;<br>
2.	Prevention or minimisation of microbial invasion at the wound site;<br>
3.	Encouragement of vascularisation and tissue regeneration at the interface between the dressing and the wound surface.<br>
Numerous wound dressing materials are available and are also being invesÂ¬tigated. Dressings help to achieve haemostatic and thus control blood loss and protects the wound from microbial contamination by shielding the wound from the environment. Some dressings are designed to prevent evaporative fluid loss and thereby keep the wound bed in a moist condition which is beneficial for healing. Some wound dressings contain components which directly promote cell growth or migration or which attract or activate cells from the immune system which secrete growth-promoting substances. Dressings may also contain antimicrobial drugs, which help control infection of the wound.<br>
Paraffm-embedded cotton gauze is widely used as wound dressing but has many limitations. "Hydrogel" dressings  which are non-concessive dressings<br><br>
made of hydrophilic polymers such as gelatin, polysaccharides, polydactyl-amide, polyhydroxyethyl m eth aery late, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, etc. are another type of dressing with a high capacity for the absorption of exudates. These dressings swell upon contact with wound fluid and can absorb several tines their own weight of exudates. Commercially available hydrogel dressings inchide intestine get (Smith and Nephew, UK) and Vision (CR Bard USA). A special type of hydrogels are the alginates, which are hydrophilic pofysaccharides extracted from seaweed. They are produced as thin non-woven tissues or as fibres. Upon contact the wound fluid, fluey turn into a gel which has a high absorptive capacity for wound fluid. Examples include Kaltostat (Brit-Cairn, UK) and Sorbsan (Steriseal, UK). Occlusive or semi-occhisive dressings prevent or retard the evaporation of water from the wound bed thereby keeping it moist. They are usually polymer Alms such as that fabricated from flexible potyurethane and contain a self-adhesive coating. Examples of such dressings are Opsite (Smith and Nephew, UK) and Tegaderm (3M, USA). Examples of semi-occhisive dressings are Omiderm (Latro Medical Systems, UK) and Elkin (Konin-klijke Utermohten, The Netherlands).<br>
A more complex type of occhisive dressings is the hydrocoUoid (HCD) dressings consisting of hydrocoUoid particles (eg. gelatin, pectin, etc.) embedded in a hydrophobic matrix (eg. polyisobtttylene).HCD dressings have a h^ absorptive capacity, and are very useful for the treatment of wounds producing high amounts of exudates. Commercially available examples of these dressings include Dodder degree. (Connate, UK) and Tegasorb TM. (3M, USA).<br><br>
Wound dressings is an area which is undergoing sweeping changes in its technology with the advent of genetic engineering and the emergence of many protein- and peptide-based therapeutic substances and cell culture technologies.<br>
The major technological developments in the area of wound dressings have prmcqiaUy sought to obtain simple or composite ratings able to match most of the characteristics of an ideal skin replacement. Among dressings composed of natural polymers, alginates have found wide acceptability (vide infra). Non-woven calcium alginate dressings have been increasingly used in die management of partial and full diickness wounds. Calcium alginate is converted into a hydrophilic gel at the wound surface by an ion exchange reaction between the calcium in the alginate and sodium in the blood and wound exudates. The hydrophilic gel provides a moist environment which promotes healing and epidermal regeneration. Calchim alginate has also a role in blood coagulation. The calcium ions released in exchange for sodium ions promote hemostasia while the sodnim alginate serves as a matrix for the aggregation of platelets and erydirocytes. Gelatin is obtained by the controlled hydrolysis of the fibrous insohible protein collagen which is the major constituent of skm^ bones and connective tissue. Gelatin contains a high concentration of amino acids such as glycine, proline and hydroxyproline. Gelatin possess a high hemostatic effect. Gelatin-based wound dressings have been conventionally prepared by crosslinking gelatin using formaldehyde glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide, diisocyanate, etc. and recently a wound dressing based on gelatin crosslinked with dextran dialdehyde has been reported. (US Pat. No.6132759).<br><br>
Although both alginate and gelatin have been investigated individually for many biomedical applications including wound dressings, published reports or patents on combining the two and thus achieving synergic beneficial effects of both for medical use has been rare. In the smgle known instance of gelatin-alginate composite aa a possible wound dressing material. A mixture of gelatin and sodium alginate in water is cast as a film and crosslinked using carbodiimide in 90% acetone-water mixture. However^ the method involves crosslinking both gelatin and alginate using a toxic compound such as carbodiimide.<br>
Reports on the toxicity of alginate dressings prepared using calcium cross-linking method have caused concern on the use of these dressings. Calchim sodium alginate dressing (Kaltostat) is found to be cytotoxic to fibroblasts and keratinocytes in culture and high calcium concentration is known to inhibit the growth of cells in culture.<br>

These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing<br>
description.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, according to this invention is provided an alginate dialdehyde cross-linked gelatin as a wound dressing material.<br>
According to the invention is further provided a porous for the preparatton of an alginate dialdehyde crosslinked gelatin.<br>
In accordance with this invention, a polysaccharide is subjected to periodate oxidation to produce the dialdehyde. Periodate oxidation is a well-known reaction. Oxidation can be accomplished on any polysaccharide having geminal hydroxyl or one hydroxyl and one ammo group in adjacent positions using reagents such as sodinm or potassium periodate in aqueous mediam. The reaction produces dialdehyde residues in the polysaccharide. The extent of oxidation depends on the concentrirtion of the re^gents^substrate (alginate), time and temperature of the reaction and the molecular weight of the substrate. Ahhongh sodinm or potassnim periodate is the preferred reagent for such reactions, those skilled in the art would know that reagents such as periodic acid or lead tetra acetate in an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide may also be used. After oxidation, the dialdehyde derivative of alginate can be conveniently purified and separated from low molecular weight reaction components by using dialysis membranes, precipitation, ohrafiltration or gel permeation chromatography, followed by lyophilization.<br>
The oxidation reaction also can be conducted in ethanol/water mixture, with the advantage that more amount of alginate can be used for the oxidation in comparison with the aqueous sohition thereby yielding siginificantly larger quantity of ADA in a single reaction. Alginates cannot be dissolved in water to prepare sohitions of high concentration since their viscosity is very high<br><br>
which result in gels rather than solutions making the handling of the same difficult In ethanol/water mixture, it is demonstrated that a dispersion of alginate can undergo oxidation by periodate. Periodates are known not to oxidise ethanol, making the process simple and advantageous for the preparation of lan^e quantities of ADA.<br>
Cross-linking between gelatin and ADA is achieved by the formation of Schiff base Imk^ges between free amino groups present on die gelatin and the dialdehyde residues on ADA. This reaction is performed in aqueous medium and the speed and degree of cross-linking depend on a variety of parameters, such as the type of gehitin and its concentration, degree of dialÂ¬dehyde substitution and molecular weight of the ADA, pHÂ»buffer type and the presence of electrolytes in the reaction medium, etc.. The ADA k crosslinked with gelatin in the presence of a reagent selected from borax sohition, phosphate buffer and phosphate buffered saline. Two different grades of sodium alginate are employed in the embodiment of the invention. High (viscosity of 2% solution 14,000 cps at 25Â°C) and medhim viscosity (viscosity of 2% sohitton 3,500 cps at ZS^"C) sodium alginate from the brown algae Macrocystis pyrifera, are obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA. However, those skilled m the art would understand that such viscosities are not a limiting factor for the invention, other viscosities could also be employed. This is particularly the case with biopolymers which are natural products and the viscosities of the material often depend on the biological source from which it is derived and can never be the same or identical. Gelatin employed m the invention is type A (Bloom 300) also obtained from Sigma, USA. Several types of gelatin exist, depending on the source of collagen used, and on the extraction and<br><br>
production process employed. Type A is prepared by acid hydrolysis and type B is prepared by basic hydrolysis of the collagen. Both types of gelatin can be used for the preparation of the composite matrix, but_typ^e A is prderred since it is known to contain more amino groups and therefore is more efficient in the crosslinking reaction. Gelatins with a variety of Bloom numbers exists the Bloom number being a measure of the rigidity of the gel formed from the material. Although Ae present embodiment is usmg Bloom 300, other Bloom numbers are also suitable, but those skilled in the art would know that the lower the Bloom number, the weaker will be the mechanical strength of the fthns formed. Again, type A gelatins have higher Bloom numbers and therefore, this type is preferred in the invention. The composite matrix according to the invention may be prepared as membranes, sheets or foamr. Foams have the advantage that they will be able to absorb large amount of the wound exudates because of the macro-porous nature. The fabrication of such foams is simple and usually involves passing air, nitrogen or an inert gas such as helmm through the gelatin solution under agitation and then adding the ADA to crosslmk the same. Foams thus produced can be shaped as sheets, rods, plugs, pads, etc. and can be used in the hydrated, semi-hydrated or dry form suitable for application in the wound site. In accordance wiHk an efflbodiment, the composite matrix mi^ be prepared in situ in the would bed itself The in situ application will have several conform ability of the dressing on wounds without the dressing wrinkling or fluting in the area covering the wound. Most commercially available dressings in the form of membranes and sheets are problematic as far as the conformability is concerned and the in situ formation of the dressings will therefore be superior to such dressings. The composite matrix<br><br>
may also be fabricated into micropartides or microspheres which could fmd applications as a controlled drug delivery system. The fabrication of such geometries of the composite matrix involves dispersing the gelatin sohition as fine droplets in a suitable dispersion medium such as vegetable oil or other hydroxycarbon oils such as paraffin stabilised by a suitable surfactant and crosslinking the particles by the introduction of ADA. Various techniques could be employed for generating the dispersion such as mechanical agitation, uttrasonicatton, vortex mixing, etc. depending on the size of the particles desired. Many drugs could be incorporated into the matrix during the fabrication of such particles. Such drug-loaded particles could be used for injection intramuscularly or subcutaneously for their slow release in the human body. They could also be used for coverng the wound bed since the large surface area of the particles would be helpful in absorbing wound exudates especially in chronic ulcers. Protems and polyÂ¬peptides also could be incorporated into the matrix for their slow release up on implantation.<br>
The alginate dialdehyde crosslinked gelatin m^ be provided with antiÂ¬bacterial agents such as silver su^hadiazine or gen tarn ycin or other antibacterials which are beneficial in preventmg or checking wound mfection. Such antibacterials could be incorporated into the composite matrix either during the preparation of the matrix itself or could be mcorporated later after the formation of the matrix by sorption methods which usually involves socking the matrix in a sohition of the antibiotic (antibacterial) compound and allowing its sorption into the matrix. Such antibiotics would be released slowly from the matrix into the wound bed thereby help checking the bacterial colonization of the wound.<br><br>
The compounds are not limited to antibiotics or antibacterials and thoie<br>
skilled in the art would know that there are many other compounds that<br>
helps wound healing and epithelialization such as many Growth Factors<br>
currently available. Growth factors such as those belonging to the class of<br>
the EGFÂ» FGF, PDGF, TGF, VEGFÂ» PD-ECGF or IGF families are suitable<br>
for die said purpose.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detÂ«l widi the help of tfie<br>
following non-limiting examples:<br>

MeikodA<br>
Medium  viscosity sodium   alginate^  20  gm or high  viscosity  sodium<br>
alginate S g was dissolved in 500 mL  and  450 mL distilled water<br>
respectively  by  magnetic  stirring  in   a beaker  at<br><br>

sohition and.tbe contents were stined magnetically in the dark at 2S*C for 6 h. The sohitionwas then dialyzed using the 3500 M.W cut off dialysis tubing (Spectra/Por* M.Wcut off 3S00, Spectrum Laboratories, CA, USA) against distilled water (2.5 lit) with several changes of water until it was free from periodate (48 hours). Con^lete removal of periodate was ensured by testing the dialyzate for the absence of turbidity or precqiitate with an aqueous sohitbn of siNer nitrate. The solution was then frozen -TS^C, lyophilized and stored in a desiccator in the refrigerator at 4*"C. The extent of oxidation with respect to time was foUowed by iodometric titration of the residual periodate present in the reaction mucture at regular time intervals. A 5 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was neutralized with an of 10 mL sodium bicarbonate sohition and iodine was Uberated by the addition of 20% potassium iodide sohition (2 mL). Liberated iodine was then titrated with standardized sodium thiosulphates sohition using starch as the indicator. Representative data are shown in Table 1.<br>

Gelling experiments in the absence of borax.<br>
ADA (55% oxidized - Medium viscosir.) prepared by method B was tried to crosslink with gelatin (Type A, Bloom 300) in the absence of Borax. Gelling lime was noted in the<br><br>
presence of buffers fike phosphate buflered saline (0. IM, pH7.4) and phosphate buffer (O.IM. pH 7.4). Representative data for the gellii^ time is illustrated in the example shown in Table 9.<br>
Table 9. Variation of type of buffer on gelling time of 20% solution of gelatin (Bloom 300, type A) with 20% solution of ADA (55% oxidized-method B):<br><br>
Buffers	Gelling time (seconds)<br>
Phosphate buffered saline	153 Â±10<br>
Phosphate buffer	121115<br>
In all other buffers, gelling time was prolonged (more than 2 hours). ADA (60% oxidized) prepared by method A was also used to crosslink with gelatin. Gelling time obtained was more than 15 minutes. The reason for this high gelling time was examined and it was found that there is decrease in molecular weight for ADA prepared by method A. Molecular weights of ADA determined at different degree of oxidation by the two methods are shown in Table 10.<br>

Controlled Release of FTTC Albumm from the GcL<br>
To study the release profile of high molecular weight proteins and how the method of preparation, viscosity and percentage oxidation affect the release profile. diflFerent types of gels were loaded with HTC-Iabeled bovine serum albumin (1% loading) and cumulative release was foUowed. ADA prepared from medium viscosity (BM65, AM55) and high viscosity (BH61, AH77) by both methods was used for this experiment. A and B denote alginate dialdehyde prepared by method A and B respectively and M and H stand for medium and high viscosity alginate and number denotes percentage oxidation.<br>
Briefly, 0.15 mL of ADA (20% solution in 0.1M borax) was taken in a capped test mbe, to which was added 0.15 mL of gelatin(15% solution) containing HTC- albumin (1% loading) and aUowed to form geL It was then kept at 37Â«C for 10 minutes. 10 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) was introduced to it and incubated at 37Â»C. At regular intervals, ImL aliquots were withdrawn and absorbance of released FITC-albumin was read at 496 nm in a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Cumulative release was then cakulated. AU the experiments were done in tripUcate. Representative data are illustrated in the example shown in Table 11.<br>
