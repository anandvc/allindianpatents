1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile terminal and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for inputting characters of a mobile terminal.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a related art method for inputting characters (letters) of a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, in order to input a specific character among various characters (e.g., English alphabet characters and Korean Hangul characters) allocated to each number key of a key input unit of the mobile terminal, a specific number key is repeatedly selected.<br>
For example, when four characters (e.g., consonants of the Korean language '?,?,t and z') are allocated to the number key 1 of the key input unit, in order to input the character 'z' at the fourth position must be pressed four times repeatedly. Namely, when the number key 1 is pressed once, the character' ' is displayed on a screen of the mobile terminal, when the number key 1 is pressed twice, the character '?' disappears and simultaneously the character ' is displayed on the screen of the mobile terminal, when the number key 1 is pressed three times, the character 'L' disappears and simultaneously the character 't' is displayed on the screen of the mobile terminal, and when the number  key   1   is  pressed   four  times,   the   character  't'   disappears   and<br>
1A<br><br>
simultaneously the character 'z' is displayed on the screen of the mobile terminal. In this manner, in order to select the specific character (e.g., 'z') among the characters allocated to one number key of the mobile terminal, the user must press the number key four times repeatedly to input the specific character.<br>
If the third character (e.g., 't') of the characters allocated to the number key 1 of the mobile terminal is to be selected, the number key 1 must be pressed three times. That is, in the related art method for inputting a character, time for inputting a character is lengthened, and when the user inputs a character by mistake, he/she must input the character from the beginning. In addition, when characters allocated to one number key are desired to be inputted, the number key must be pressed several times repeatedly.<br>
To sum up, the related art method for inputting a character has the following problems.<br>
That is, first, in order to select a specific character among characters allocated to each number key, the corresponding number key must be pressed several times.<br>
In addition, in order to input a basic character including one or more consonants and one or more vowels, the plurality of number keys are to be selected, and in addition, in order to select a consonant or a vowel allocated to the plurality of number keys, the plurality of number keys are to be pressed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The apparatus and method for inputting characters of a mobile terminal capable of allowing a user to easily and quickly input a desired character by displaying characters allocated to a number key of a mobile terminal on a screen of the mobile terminal.<br>
FIG. 1  is a schematic block diagram showing the construction of an<br>
5<br><br>
apparatus for inputting characters of a mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the apparatus for inputting characters of a mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention includes a key input unit 11; a display unit 13 divided into an editing region and a character navigation region; and a controller 12 for displaying a character list including all the characters previously allocated to a specific number key of a key input unit in the character navigation region when the specific number key is selected in an editing mode by a user. When the user selects a specific character from the characters on the character list through a direction key of the key input unit 11, the controller 12 displays the selected specific character in the editing region.<br>
A character input mode of the mobile terminal includes the editing mode and a character navigation mode.<br>
The character list including all the characters previously allocated to each number key of the key input unit 11 is stored in a storage unit 14. Herein, the characters previously allocated to each number key refer to consonants and vowels of the Korean language.<br>
The operation of the apparatus for inputting characters of the mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view showing an editing region and a character navigation region of a display unit of the mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the display unit 13 includes the editing region 100 and the character navigation region 110, and a curser 115 used for indicating a<br>
6<br><br>
position at which a character to be corrected or inputted is to be placed is positioned in the editing region 100 in the editing mode and positioned in the character navigation region 110 in the character navigation mode.<br>
First, when the character input mode of the mobile terminal is changed to editing mode by the user, the controller moves the curser 115 into the editing region 100. At this time, when the user selects a delete key (not shown) of the key input unit 11, the controller 12 deletes a character displayed in the editing region 100, and when the user selects a direction key (not shown), the controller 12 moves the curser 115 within the editing region 100 according to a key signal of the direction key.<br>
Thereafter, when the user selects a number key (e.g., the number key 1) of the key input unit 11 in the editing mode, the controller 12 changes the editing mode to the character navigation mode and moves the curser 115 into the character navigation region 110. At this time, the controller reads a character list including characters allocated to the user selected number key from the storage unit 14 and outputs the read character list on the display unit 13.<br>
The display unit 13 displays the outputted character list in the character navigation region.<br>
Thereafter, when the user selects a specific character among the characters on the character list through the direction key, the controller 12 displays the selected specific character in the editing region.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating the processes of a method for inputting characters of the mobile terminal in an editing mode in accordance with the present invention.<br>
First, when the character input mode of the mobile terminal is changed to<br>
7<br><br>
the editing mode by the user, the controller 12 moves the curser 115 into the editing region 100 (step S11).<br>
When the user selects a number key of the key input unit 11 in the editing mode, the user changes the editing mode to the character navigation mode (steps S12 and S13).<br>
When the user selects the direction key (not shown) of the key input unit 11, rather than selecting the number key of the key input unit 11, in the editing mode (step S14), the controller 12 moves the curser 115 within the editing region according to a key signal of the direction key (step S15).<br>
Meanwhile, when the user selects a delete key (not shown) (step S16), rather than selecting the direction key of the key input unit 11, the controller 12 deletes the character at which the cursor 115 is positioned in the editing region 100 according to a key signal of the delete key (step S17).<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating the processes of a method for inputting characters of the mobile terminal in a character navigation mode in accordance with the present invention.<br>
First, when the user selects a number key (e.g., the number key 1) of the key input unit 11 in the editing mode, the controller 12 changes the editing mode to the character navigation mode (step S21) and moves the curser 115 into the character navigation region 110.<br>
The controller 12 displays a character list including all the characters allocated to the user selected number key in the character navigation region 110 of the display unit 13 (step S22).<br>
When the user selects the direction key (step S23) and selects a specific character from the character list displayed in the character navigation region 110,<br>
8<br><br>
the controller 12 displays the selected specific character in the editing region 100 (step S24). In addition, after the controller 12 displays the specific character in the editing region, when an OK key of the key input unit 11 is selected by the user, the controller 12 confirmatively determines the selected specific character according to a key signal of the OK key.<br>
Meanwhile, after the specific character is selected from the character list displayed in the character navigation region 110, when the number key is selected again by the user (step S25), the controller 12 displays characters (consonants/vowels) which can be combined with the specific character in the character navigation region 110 (step S28). Then, the controller 12 displays the specific character I the editing region 100, and when the OK key of the key input unit 11 is selected by the user (step S26), the controller 12 confirmatively determines the selected specific character according to the key signal of the OK key (step S27).<br>
Thereafter, the controller 12 displays the characters (consonants/vowels) which can be combined with the specific character in the character navigation region 110, and when a specific character is selected from the combining-available characters which can be combined by the user, the controller 12 combines the combining-available specific character to the specific character and then displays the combined character in the editing region 100. And then, when the OK key of the key input unit 11 is selected by the user (step S29), the controller 12 confirmatively determines the selected specific character according to the key signal of the OK key (step S30). Herein, the specific character is a consonant or a vowel, and the combining-available specific character is a vowel or a consonant which is combined to the vowel or the consonant to create a basic<br>
9<br><br>
character.<br>
The controller can display the characters (consonants/vowels) which can be combined with the specific character in the character navigation region 110, and preferably, as shown in FIGs. 5 to 8, a consonant or a vowel can be combined to the specific character and basic characters formed by combining the consonant or the vowel thereto can be displayed in the character navigation region 110, whereby the user can more easily and quickly input the basic character.<br>
FIGs. 5 to 8 show a method for displaying a Korean compound character on the display unit of the apparatus for inputting characters of the mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, when the user selects a specific number key, the display unit 13 displays a character list including characters allocated to the specific number key in the character navigation region 110 under the control of the controller 12. At this time, when the user selects the character '###' from the character list (e.g., consonants of the Korean language ### and '###').displayed in the character navigation region 110 by using the direction key, the controller 12 displays the selected character '### ' in the editing region 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, after displaying the character '###' in the editing region 100 on the display unit 13, when the user presses the specific number key again, the controller 12 combines a vowel (vowels of the Korean language ### ### and ' ### ') to the displayed character '###' and displays the vowel-combined characters (e.g., ###' ###) in the character navigation region 110. At this time, when the user presses the OK key, the controller clears the character navigation region 110<br>
10<br><br>
according to a key signal of the OK key, confirmatively determines the selected character (e.g., the basic character ###), converts the character navigation mode into the editing mode, and simultaneously moves the curser 115 to the editing region 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, when the user selects a desired character (e.g., ###) among the vowel-combined characters (e.g., ., ###' ###) and then selects the specific number key, rather than selecting the OK key, the controller 12 combines an additional consonant (consonants of the Korean language ### ### and '###') to the selected character (e.g., ###'), and displays the additional consonant-combined characters (e.g., ### and '###') in the character navigation region 115. At this time, when the user presses the acknowledge key, the controller 12 clears the character navigation region 110 according to the key signal of the OK key, confirmatively determines the selected character (e.g., the basic character '###'), converts the character navigation mode into the editing mode, and, at the same time, moves the curser 115 into the editing region 100.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, when the user selects the character '### among the additional consonant-combined character (e.g., ### and '###') and presses the specific number key again, rather than selecting the OK key, the controller 12 combines consonants which can be finally combined with the character ### to the character ### and displays the finally formed character (e.g., ###) in the character navigation region (110). At this time, when the user presses the OK key, the controller 12 clears the character navigation region 110 according to the key signal of the OK key, confirmatively determines the selected character<br>
11<br><br>
(e.g., the basic character '###'), converts the character navigation mode into the editing mode, and at the same time, moves the curser 115 into the editing region 100.<br>
The apparatus and method for inputting characters of the mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention can also input characters of the Hindi, the Chinese language, the Japanese language and the English alphabet easily and quickly as well as the characters of the Korean language.<br>
A method for easily and quickly inputting characters of the English alphabets will now be described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is an exemplary view showing the English alphabet displayed on the display unit of the apparatus for inputting characters of the mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, when the user selects a specific number key, the controller 12 of the apparatus for inputting characters of the mobile terminal displays a character list including all the alphabet characters (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C, 'D' and 'E') allocated to the specific number key in the character navigation region 110. When the user selects a specific character (e.g., 'A') on the character list by using the direction key, the controller 12 displays the selected specific character in the editing region 100. In this manner, the user can easily and quickly input the specific alphabet character among the alphabet characters displayed in the character navigation region 110.<br>
For example, assuming that the alphabet characters 'A', 'B', 'C\ 'D' and 'E' have been allocated to the number key 1 of the key input unit 11, according to the related art method for inputting characters, in order to input the character 'E', the number key 1 must be pressed five times, but comparatively, in the present<br>
12<br><br>
invention, the number key 1 is pressed once and then the character 'E' is selected by using the direction key. In addition, according to the related method for inputting characters, in order to input the character 'D' after the character 'E' is inputted, the number key 1 must be pressed five times and then the number key 1 must be pressed four times again, but comparatively, in the present invention, the number key 1 is pressed once, the character 'E' is selected by using the direction key, and then, the character 'D' can be selected immediately.<br>
As so far described, the apparatus and method for inputting characters of a mobile terminal in accordance with the present invention have many advantages.<br>
That is, for example, first, the number of inputting of the number keys for inputting a single character can be considerably reduced compared with the related art.<br>
Second, when the user select a specific number key of the mobile terminal, all the characters allocated to the selected specific number key are displayed in the character navigation region 110, so the user can easily and quickly input a desired character.<br>
Third, since characters which can be combined to a specific character allocated to a number key are displayed on the screen of the mobile terminal, the user can easily and quickly input a desired character. Namely, in order to input a single basic character, the user can input a specific number key once and then select a desired character by using the direction key, so the user does not need to additionally select number keys corresponding to a basic character.<br>
Fourth, since the basic character formed by combining a consonant and a vowel can be displayed in the character navigation region, the user can easily and<br>
13<br><br>
quickly input the basic character. Namely, since additional characters which can be combined to a specific character allocated to a number key of the mobile terminal are combined to the specific character, and then, the combined characters are displayed on the screen of the mobile terminal, whereby the user can easily and quickly input a desired character.<br>
