				<td>Method for outputting measured values<br>
and display device<br>
The subject matter of the invention relates to a method<br>
5  for outputting measured values, in particular in the<br>
case of quality inspection, and to a display device.<br>
Carrying out quality control during the production of<br>
items such as, for example, the coating of a body with<br>
10 paint and before the delivery of items is of<br>
substantial importance for customer satisfaction and,<br>
in some instances, also for product safety. Moreover,<br>
strict incoming controls of delivered products are<br>
carried out in order to ensure that parts corresponding<br>
15 to the requirements for quality and, if appropriate,<br>
safety are delivered, and that no bad parts are further<br>
processed. Such quality controls must be carried out<br>
within a very short time. It is simultaneously<br>
necessary to enable a quick statement on the quality of<br>
20 the test item, in order to keep down the costs of<br>
quality control. The usual approach is to acquire one<br>
or more measured values from a test item that are<br>
passed on to be processed and output. The determined<br>
data are acquired and output in lists. However, the<br>
25 user cannot recognize simply and quickly whether the<br>
acquired measured values correspond to the stipulations<br>
with reference to the tolerance bands. There is a need<br>
for a complicated individual comparison of the<br>
determined values and the required values in order to<br>
30 separate the bad parts from the good parts. This is the<br>
case, in particular, with measurement methods in which<br>
measurement signals are acquired electronically via<br>
measuring devices and are output by a signal<br>
acquisition  device  in  a  display.  Moreover,  it  is<br>
35 impossible for the individual measured values to be<br>
assigned to a measuring point or measuring surface.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
a method for outputting measured values and a display<br>
device for carrying out the method that enables a<br>
statement to be made on the quality of the test item(s)<br>
immediately after carrying out a number of individual<br>
5 measurements.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the features of claim 1 and 13. Further advantageous<br>
embodiments are specified in the further claims.<br>
10<br>
The inventive method has the advantage of very quickly<br>
enabling a qualitative statement on the test item(s).<br>
The staff carrying out the inspection can recognize<br>
immediately after carrying out a measurement whether<br>
15 the test item(s) or elements of the test items fulfill<br>
the various requirements in accordance with the<br>
predetermined quality conditions.<br>
After the measurement has been carried out and the<br>
20 measured values have been checked by running through a<br>
number of steps, a diagram in which the mean values of<br>
individual measurement series are assigned to an axis<br>
is output in a display. A first visualization of the<br>
measurement  results  is  thereby provided  for  simple<br>
25  evaluation.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the method,<br>
it is provided that after being plotted on an axis the<br>
mean values are projected onto a straight line. The<br>
30 straight line is formed via an auxiliary axis between a<br>
minimum and a maximum mean value, the rank values or<br>
the measurement series and/or random samples being<br>
plotted on the auxiliary axis. At the same time, the<br>
mean values have a ratio to an upper and lower limiting<br>
35 value or limit line. Consequently, it is immediately<br>
clear to the staff carrying out the test as to whether<br>
a test item fulfills the prescribed requirements, that<br>
is to say whether the mean values lie inside, partially<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
outside or outside the limiting values. The<br>
representation of the mean values on a straight line<br>
enables the recognition of a uniform production by<br>
means of a number of juxtaposed mean values. Deviations<br>
5 are likewise plotted by a larger distance of the mean<br>
values along the straight line from the next mean value<br>
or group of mean values, and are thus immediately<br>
recognizable.<br>
10 It is provided according to an advantageous refinement<br>
of the invention that a confidence interval is<br>
displayed in relation to each mean value on the<br>
straight line plotted according to the rank value or by<br>
specification of the measurement series. The confidence<br>
15 interval corresponds, for example, to three times the<br>
standard deviation. Consequently, an upper and a lower<br>
bound of the confidence interval runs hyperbolically in<br>
relation to the straight line on which the rank mean<br>
values are plotted. Consequently, in the vicinity of an<br>
20 upper or lower limit line, in particular, it is<br>
possible to detect in addition to the desired value or<br>
limiting value of the confidence interval the extent to<br>
which the individual measurements still lie inside or<br>
outside the limiting value or the limit lines.  In<br>
25 addition, the confidence interval can be displayed by<br>
regression lines.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, it is provided that the measured values of<br>
30 the test item(s) which lie in the limit range of the<br>
confidence interval or outside the confidence interval<br>
are displayed on the display preferably automatically<br>
or upon request from the user by actuating a key on an<br>
operator panel. Once a measuring point of a test item<br>
35 lying in the limit range or outside the confidence<br>
interval is displayed, the staff can immediately<br>
recognize a problem site and institute further measures<br>
as appropriate. For example, during ongoing production<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
in which housings or bodies are being painted it<br>
becomes possible when measuring a number of elements to<br>
detect directly that element which, for example, has an<br>
excessively thick or excessively thin layer of paint.<br>
5 It is thereby possible for individual process<br>
parameters to be readjusted directly as appropriate<br>
while production is running. If what is involved are<br>
supply parts that are to be tested, the supplier can be<br>
immediately informed of the  site or region to be<br>
10 reworked. If the test item comprises only one measuring<br>
point and a number of test items have been tested<br>
consecutively within a measurement series or random<br>
sample and at least one rank value of the mean values<br>
lies outside the limit range of the neighboring region<br>
15 or outside the neighboring region, the test item or the<br>
element can be determined exactly and rejected, or<br>
production can be correspondingly corrected and<br>
readjusted. A similar statement holds for measured<br>
values that lie outside an upper and a lower limiting<br>
20  value.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the method,<br>
it is provided that the rank values lying outside the<br>
upper  and  lower  limiting  value  or  outside  the<br>
25 confidence interval are displayed to the user in the<br>
display in a fashion deviating in color and/or shape<br>
from the rank values lying inside the confidence<br>
interval or the upper and lower limit line. The staff<br>
are provided with an additional mode of signaling by<br>
30 the optical highlighting of the rank values, or the<br>
individual measured values relevant thereto, lying<br>
inside or outside a range. It can advantageously be<br>
provided that the rank values lying outside the<br>
confidence  interval  are highlighted by a  signaling<br>
35 color, for example red and/or a corresponding<br>
background by means of a color and/or hatching, the<br>
rank values lying inside the confidence interval or the<br>
upper and lower limit lines being identified by a<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
corresponding display, hatching and/or background, for<br>
example in a green fashion. An upper and lower limit<br>
line can, in addition, be displayed by a third color,<br>
hatching or other identification.<br>
5<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
method, it is provided that a scatter of the measured<br>
values in relation to the respective mean values is<br>
displayed.  This scatter is displayed by a bar that<br>
10 extends above and below the mean value and comprises<br>
the greatest and least measured value of a measurement<br>
series. It is thereby possible to enable a more exact<br>
analysis and evaluation. When production whose quality<br>
is being optimized bit by bit is underway,  it  is<br>
15 possible for individual parameters to be inferred more<br>
precisely and accessed for setting by enlarging or<br>
diminishing such a bar.<br>
The confidence interval or the standard deviation is<br>
20  advantageously  set  to  a  predetermined  percentage<br>
fraction.  It is thereby determined which percentage<br>
fraction of all the measured values is adopted as a<br>
"good part",  and which residual percentage  fraction<br>
lies outside the prescribed tolerance. The confidence<br>
25  interval therefore stipulates a scatter within the mean<br>
value that is considered to be permissible.<br>
In a further method step for determining a result, it<br>
is provided that each measurement series is checked for<br>
30 a normal distribution of the individual measured<br>
values. Such a check establishes whether there are<br>
significant differences between the measured values of<br>
the measurement series, and so the subsequent steps for<br>
evaluating the measurement results are provided with a<br>
35 basis which assumes that each measured value is to be<br>
assigned with high probability the mean value of the<br>
measurement series.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
After a further advantageous step for evaluating the<br>
measurement results, it is provided that the<br>
homogeneity of the variances of the measurement series<br>
is checked. This check and the preceding checks for<br>
5 normal distribution of the measured values of a<br>
measurement series can form a precondition as to<br>
whether it is possible to carry out a variance analysis<br>
or scatter decomposition. In the case of homogeneous<br>
variance,  that  is  to  say  that  no  significant<br>
10 differences have been determined, it is subsequently<br>
possible to carry out a variance analysis in order to<br>
form homogeneous subgroups. When significant<br>
differences are determined between the mean values,<br>
homogeneous groups are formed that are separated into<br>
15 such subgroups by further methods. It is possible by<br>
means of such group formation to make a simple<br>
statement as to whether the mean values are comparable,<br>
that is to say whether upon comparing a number of<br>
coated items or systems that apply a layer thickness,<br>
20 comparable layer thicknesses or conditions are found,<br>
or whether any adjustment or correction is required.<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
method, it is provided that in a further step after the<br>
25 checking of the normal distribution of the measured<br>
values and the checking of the homogeneity of the<br>
variances a significance test is carried out for the<br>
mean values of the individual measurement series or<br>
measuring points. The significance is a variable that<br>
30 belongs to the confidence level and enables a statement<br>
to be made as to whether the mean values of each<br>
measurement series belong to one another. A<br>
significance obtains as soon as the condition is<br>
fulfilled  that  FBeob &gt; Ftab,  FBeob  resulting  from the<br><br>
(sum of the<br>
35  quotient of the variance II<br>
mean values of each measurement series in relation to<br>
the mean value of all the measurement series as a<br>
function of the number of the measurement series) and<br><br>
- 7 -<br><br><br>
the variance  I<br>
(sum of  the  individual<br>
squared standard deviations as a function of the number<br>
of individual measurements). This significance test,<br>
which can be carried out by various methods, serves the<br>
5 purpose of forming homogeneous subgroups. Such mean<br>
values that are assigned to a subgroup can be displayed<br>
with the same identification and/or color such that the<br>
membership of the individual mean values in a group<br>
immediately becomes apparent to the viewer.<br>
10<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
method, it is provided that the number of the<br>
individual measurements of measuring points of a test<br>
item is the same. A balanced evaluation is spoken of<br>
15 given the same number of individual measurements per<br>
measuring point on an item. Alternatively, it can be<br>
provided that a different number of individual<br>
measurements are required per measuring point so that<br>
an unbalanced evaluation is spoken of. An unbalanced<br>
20 evaluation is mostly required whenever, for example, a<br>
very small surface on a housing is to be tested in<br>
conjunction with a large surface on the same housing,<br>
and the small surfaces enable only a small number of<br>
measuring points.<br>
25<br>
After the significance test, it is possible to display<br>
immediately to the user by outputting mean values that<br>
are not significantly different from one another which<br>
elements,  in particular of different test items,  or<br>
30 subregions belong to the corresponding rank values.<br>
Furthermore, the significance test can establish which<br>
mean values form a subgroup and are, in turn,<br>
homogeneous per se. The various subgroups can therefore<br>
be used to draw an inference as to which of the parts<br>
35 with the coating lie inside the tolerances, and whether<br>
systematic errors may be present.<br>
At the same time, it is possible to establish which<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
elements or product groups require corrections by<br>
specifying limits, for example in the sense of the<br>
control cards. The gradient of the straight lines on<br>
which the mean values are plotted in terms of rank can<br>
5 production engineering. A production method is ideally<br>
under control whenever no further significant<br>
differences can be demonstrated between the individual<br>
elements or subregions. It is thereby possible to<br>
eliminate systematic differences between the elements.<br>
10 This means in the case of the checking of layers of<br>
paint, for example, that the elements have an area with<br>
a layer of paint of the same thickness, taking account<br>
of the random samples that, as a rule, do not<br>
correspond to  the  same  elements  of the  individual<br>
15  objects, or partially correspond.<br>
The significance test is preferably carried out in a<br>
trial run or a preliminary run before starting up<br>
series production. It is thereby possible to optimize<br>
20 the setting of the process for producing an item.<br>
Consequently, losses can be prevented when starting up<br>
or running series fabrication. The quality class in<br>
which the process is to be found is immediately evident<br>
to the test staff from the display of the mean values,<br>
25 which are not significantly different from one another,<br>
with the same identification or color in a common<br>
region along the Y-coordinate. If the mean values are<br>
displayed with the same color or in a common region,<br>
the process to be checked, the preliminary run for<br>
30 series fabrication or the like is optimally set. If<br>
different colors or different areas to which the mean<br>
values are assigned are displayed, there is a need for<br>
readjustment, it being possible to contribute to<br>
raising  the  process  capability  by  adapting  the<br>
35 significantly different mean values, and consequently<br>
to minimize the losses.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved by means of a<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
display device as claimed in claim 13. This display<br>
device comprises a connection for a measuring apparatus<br>
to which a measuring apparatus can be connected in<br>
order to carry out individual measurements. The<br>
5 individual measured values are acquired in an<br>
evaluation device, provided in the display device and<br>
having an electronic computer, and respectively<br>
assigned to a measurement series. The evaluation unit<br>
uses  a  number  of  individual  measurements  of  a<br>
10 measurement series to determine mean values that are<br>
output in a fashion projected onto the straight line in<br>
a diagram in the case of which the mean values are<br>
plotted over an auxiliary axis. The result of the<br>
quality inspection is thereby clearly visible to the<br>
15  operating staff or inspection staff.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement of the<br>
invention, it is provided that a measuring apparatus<br>
designed as a measuring probe and which is provided for<br>
20 measuring the thickness of thin layers is provided at<br>
the connection. The layer thickness measurement can be<br>
performed, for example, by means of a magneto-inductive<br>
method in which, for example, nonmagnetic layers on a<br>
ferromagnetic  base  material  are  detected,  examples<br>
25 being zinc, chromium, copper, tin and/or paint,<br>
varnish, plastic, enamel, iron or steel. Likewise, it<br>
is possible to carry out the so-called eddy current<br>
method in which electrically nonconducting layers on<br>
nonferrous metals are determined, such as, for example,<br>
30 paint, varnish or plastic on aluminum, brass or zinc as<br>
well as anodized layers on aluminum. The inventive<br>
display device is not restricted thereto, and can<br>
likewise comprise a measuring apparatus for measuring<br>
layer thicknesses using the X-ray fluorescence method<br>
35 or further radiation methods as well as a microhardness<br>
measuring system or the like. Further measuring probes<br>
or test units for acquiring measured values can<br>
likewise be connected to the display device.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
According to a further advantageous refinement of the<br>
display device, it is provided that a measuring<br>
apparatus is integrated in the display device. The<br>
5 measuring apparatus is adapted to the respective<br>
measurement task. As a result, a test unit is provided<br>
that enables simple handling and qualified<br>
pronouncement of the quality of a test item.<br>
10 The invention and further advantageous refinements and<br>
developments of the same are described and explained in<br>
more detail below with the aid of the examples<br>
illustrated in the drawings. The features to be<br>
gathered from the description and the drawings can be<br>
15 applied according to the invention individually per se,<br>
or severally in any desired combination. In the<br>
drawing:<br>
figure 1  shows a schematic illustration of a test<br>
20	item,<br>
figure 2  shows  a diagram of acquired measured<br>
values from individual measurements,<br>
25      figure 3  shows   a  table  of  the   individual<br>
measurements    in    accordance    with<br>
figure 2,<br>
figure 4  shows a diagram in which mean values<br>
30	from    individual    measurements    in<br>
accordance with figure 3 are illustrated<br>
according to a rank sequence,<br>
figure 5a shows  a  diagram  in  which  the  not<br>
35	significantly different mean values are<br>
illustrated by the same identifiers,<br>
figure 5b shows a further diagram in which the not<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
significantly different mean values are<br>
reduced, and<br>
figure 6  shows a diagram in which the mean values<br>
5	are illustrated according to rank for a<br>
number of test items.<br>
A test item 11 in the form of a housing is illustrated<br>
in figure 1, by way of example. This can also be, for<br>
10 example, a body of a water, land or air vehicle, or<br>
other items. This test item 11 is, for example, coated,<br>
and the quality inspection of this test item 11<br>
requires that a prescribed uniform layer thickness be<br>
applied to the test item 11 within a tolerance range.<br>
15 It is provided for the purpose of testing the test item<br>
11 that a number, for example six, of measuring ranges<br>
or measuring points are to be monitored. These include<br>
a front side 14, a top side 16, a lateral surface 17, a<br>
turned edge 18 and 19 in an opening 21, as well as a<br>
20 holding lug 22 on the top side 16. According to a<br>
butterfly diagram that encompasses the individual<br>
surfaces to be tested, the individual surfaces or<br>
measuring ranges are tested one after another in a<br>
prescribed sequence. For example, the aim is to carry<br>
25 out ten individual measurements at each measuring point<br>
14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21 in order to acquire measured<br>
values. The measuring points are illustrated by a<br>
cross. The individual measurements are carried out with<br>
the  aid  of  a  measuring  probe  23  of  a  measuring<br>
30 apparatus 24 for measuring layer thickness. It is also<br>
possible to carry out the number of individual<br>
measurements of a measurement series at the same<br>
measuring point. The measuring apparatus 24 is<br>
connected via a connection to a display device 26, or<br>
35 in a display device 26 or is integrated in a display<br>
device 26, or vice versa. The display device 26<br>
comprises at least one evaluation device with an<br>
electronic computer, a display 27 in which the measured<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
values determined from the individual measurements are<br>
evaluated, together with the further data in order to<br>
assess the quality inspection, and are acquired and<br>
displayed in the display 27, and can also be<br>
5 interrogated for various parameters. An operator<br>
interface 28 is provided for actuating the display<br>
device 26.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a diagram that can be output in<br>
10  the display 27 on the display device 26 by plotting on<br>
the x-axis the number of individual measurements, and<br>
on the y-axis the acquired measured values, by way of<br>
example,  the layer thickness in µm.  The measurement<br>
series 1 illustrated shows the measurement on the front<br>
15  side 14, the measurement series 2 that on the top side<br>
16, etc.<br>
In figure 3, the individual measured values within the<br>
measurement series 1 to 6 shown by way of example are<br>
20 assigned in tabular fashion to each measuring point 14<br>
to 21. A test is made in a first step as to whether the<br>
measurement series satisfies a normal distribution. The<br>
mean value and the associated standard deviation are<br>
determined from each measurement series 1 to n. The<br>
25 standard deviation is used to determine whether, for<br>
example, rank 1 and rank 2 differ significantly from<br>
one another, or whether they do not differ<br>
significantly from one another, and can form a<br>
homogeneous subgroup.  It is preferred to acquire an<br>
30 equal number of measurement values for each measuring<br>
point 14 to 21 in order to form the mean values. The<br>
determination of rank is thereby based on balanced mean<br>
values. Alternatively, the rank values can also be<br>
formed from unbalanced mean values. The significance of<br>
35 the deviations is to be evaluated as a function<br>
thereof.<br>
In order to obtain a statement on the quality of the<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
layer thickness on a surface of the test item(s) 11 or<br>
of the parameters and/or variables to be tested, in a<br>
further step the mean values of the individual measured<br>
values at each measuring point 14 to 21 are sorted by<br>
5 rank and projected onto a straight line 30. The highest<br>
and the lowest mean value form the starting points for<br>
the straight lines 30 extending therebetween. This<br>
illustration of a diagram in accordance with figure 4<br>
is output in the display 27. The x-axis can show the<br>
10 ranks 1 . . . n, and the y-axis the layer thickness. The<br>
x-axis is preferably represented as feature axis, that<br>
is to say the number of the measurement series is<br>
plotted on it. This enables simple conclusions.<br>
15 The display 27 also illustrates the upper limiting<br>
value 32 and lower limiting value 33 that form a<br>
tolerance band relating to a prescribed desired layer<br>
thickness in accordance with the characteristic 35.<br>
These upper and lower limiting values 32,  33 are a<br>
20 function of stipulations relating to permissible<br>
percentage or absolute deviations.<br>
For each mean value, the scatter band of the individual<br>
measured values at a measuring point  14  to 21  in<br>
25 relation to the mean value determined therefrom is<br>
illustrated by a vertical bar 37. In this case,<br>
individual points that form the measured values of a<br>
measuring point are illustrated alternately along the<br>
bar 37. The bars 37 of the rank values 3 and 7 show<br>
30 that there is a very large scatter band of the<br>
individual measurements, which even lie in part outside<br>
the confidence interval.<br>
The respective spacing of the individual rank values or<br>
35 of a group of rank values from one another exhibits a<br>
high or low uniformity of the layer thicknesses<br>
determined at the respective measuring points 14 to 21.<br>
For example, the rank value 1 in the range I shows that<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
said rank value deviates clearly from the rank values 2<br>
to 7 in the range II. It is thereby possible to<br>
determine directly that the rank value 1 concerns a<br>
measuring point that deviates clearly from the<br>
5 remaining ones. The assignment of the individual mean<br>
values to the respective subgroup is performed in<br>
various ways, depending on the presuppositions. For<br>
example, if a normal distribution of the individual<br>
measurements obtains for all measurement series, a test<br>
10 is subsequently made for homogeneity of the variances<br>
of the individual measurement series. If no<br>
significance is established in this test, an unbalanced<br>
variance analysis is subsequently performed. If a<br>
significance is established by this unbalanced variance<br>
15 analysis, grouping is performed. Subgrouping does not<br>
take place otherwise. If the test establishes<br>
significant differences in the homogeneity of the<br>
variances of the measurement series, a further test is<br>
carried out which, in turn, fixes a subgroup upon the<br>
20  establishment of significance.<br>
If at least one measurement series is not normally<br>
distributed upon testing all the measurement series for<br>
normal distribution,  a further test is performed to<br>
25 establish the significance. If significant differences<br>
are established in the case of the measurement series,<br>
a renewed test is performed for homogeneity in the<br>
variances of the measurement series. Subgrouping is<br>
carried  out  using a  cross  table method  subsequent<br>
30 thereto in the case both of establishing significance<br>
and of establishing that no significance obtains.<br>
Fixing the subgroups enables easier readjustment of<br>
individual parameters in the production or<br>
establishment  of  systematic  errors  in  the  case  of<br>
35  fabricated products.<br>
The measuring point is to be recapitulated by the<br>
assignment of the rank value to the mean value and by<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
the assignment of the latter, in turn, to the<br>
measurement series, the result being to produce a<br>
simple and quick evaluation. It is thereby possible,<br>
for example, to determine in a simple way that the<br>
5 front side of the housing has an excessively thin<br>
varnish layer, and the varnishing station is<br>
consequently set anew.<br>
The range II shows that the rank values are essentially<br>
10  arranged at regular spacings from one another such that<br>
there is a high uniformity with reference to the mean<br>
value of the layer thicknesses. The mean values can<br>
thus be brought into relationship with one another when<br>
being assessed and do not differ significantly from one<br>
15  another. It is to be seen from the gradient of the<br>
straight line 30 that the mean values all lie within<br>
the upper and lower limiting values 32 and 33. The<br>
flatter the gradient of the straight line 30, the lower<br>
is the tolerance of the mean values among one another<br>
20  relative to the desired value, and the higher is the<br>
uniformity of the fabricated products.<br>
If the mean values lie near the desired value and have<br>
a flat or vanishing gradient, high quality steps obtain<br>
25  in the production of the test items 11.<br>
By way of example, the normal distribution is<br>
additionally illustrated in the case of the rank value<br>
1. This normal distribution is stored for each rank<br>
30 value 1 to n, and can advantageously be interrogated<br>
individually. Consequently, the scatter band about the<br>
mean value can additionally be illustrated by the<br>
normal distribution.<br>
35 The confidence interval for the individual measured<br>
values can form the basis for each midpoint. The<br>
confidence interval of the individual values, which<br>
exhibits a hyperbolic shape,  is illustrated by the<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
characteristics 38, 39. This corresponds, for example,<br>
to three times the standard deviation, and is plotted<br>
in relation to the respective mean value.<br>
5 Figure 5a illustrates a diagram in which the mean<br>
values not differing significantly from one another are<br>
illustrated by the same identifiers A, B, C ..., etc.<br>
For example, the mean values are marked along a<br>
straight line by different colors or symbols.  It is<br>
10 thereby to be seen that the mean values of the ranks 1<br>
to 3, the mean values of the ranks 4 and 5, the mean<br>
values of the ranks 6 and 7 and the mean values of the<br>
ranks 8 and 9 do not differ significantly from one<br>
another, but that the individual groups A, B, C, D of<br>
15 the rank values differ significantly from one another<br>
among themselves. Instead of a colored illustration, it<br>
is also possible to use different symbols along the<br>
straight line 30. It is provided in accordance with a<br>
preferred alternative refinement that a representation<br>
20 in the form of bars is output along the ordindate; it<br>
extends over the range of the mean values from mean<br>
values that do not differ significantly from one<br>
another. Furthermore, it can advantageously be provided<br>
that a subgroup mean value is  illustrated for the<br>
25 respective subgroup as an orientation aid of the same<br>
color as a horizontal straight line, and that the<br>
measured value range of the subgroup is output as bars<br>
of the same color on the measured value axis. By way of<br>
example,  four groups A to D are output  along the<br>
30 ordinate in figure 5a. The operating staff are thus<br>
immediately shown that a process is not optimally set.<br>
When a process is optimally set, only one identifier, a<br>
bar, or only one color is displayed for the rank<br>
values.<br>
35<br>
Such a result in accordance with figure 5a can be<br>
achieved, for example, for a pre-production fabrication<br>
or a preliminary run. In order to raise the process<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
reliability, the ranks 8 and 9 are, for example,<br>
controlled downward from the upper range. This means<br>
that the process parameters that are responsible for<br>
the measuring points on which which the mean value of<br>
5 the rank 8 or 9 is based are corrected downward such<br>
that, in the example of the measurement of a varnish<br>
layer thickness, the measuring points with a smaller<br>
varnish layer are provided. When a measurement is<br>
carried out once again, it is possible, for example, to<br>
10 obtain therefrom the result in accordance with the<br>
display in figure 5b. It is clear therefrom that the<br>
mean values not differing significantly from one<br>
another have been reduced to three subregions B, C, D<br>
or  three  associated elements.  The  gradient  of  the<br>
15 straight line 30 is simultaneously reduced. This<br>
indicates directly that the process capability has been<br>
improved.<br>
The ranks 1, 2 and 3 could be raised correspondingly in<br>
20  a next step. This means that the varnish layers there<br>
are provided with an increased layer thickness. This<br>
systematic approach makes it clear that it is possible<br>
to  infer exactly the  individual process parameters<br>
whose causes can be analyzed, and which therefore lead<br>
25  to a quick setting of the process parameters.<br>
Moreover, a statement can be made by means of such a<br>
representation as to whether the overall course of the<br>
straight line 30 is too high or too low. The<br>
30 representation of the gradient of the straight line 30<br>
and the position thereof relative to the desired mean<br>
value enables a quick statement on this.<br>
The display selected in figures 5a and 5b can also be<br>
35 selected for carrying out random samples in order to<br>
display which same elements or subregions of different<br>
elements or test items comprise individual values not<br>
differing significantly from one another.  Trends or<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
tendencies in a fabrication cycle that may need to be<br>
corrected can thereby be detected.<br>
An overall view of similar elements from their<br>
5 combination is enabled by such displays or, in other<br>
words, elements that differ from one another are<br>
displayed in an obvious way such that the user can<br>
intervene in the fabrication process in a targeted<br>
manner and optimize and readjust as appropriate.<br>
10<br>
The display in accordance with figure 6 shows a diagram<br>
in the case of which the characteristic in accordance<br>
with figure 4 of a number of test items 11 are combined<br>
in a diagram and displayed in the display 27. This<br>
15 enables a comparison between different test items 11 as<br>
such, always in relation to the respective measuring<br>
points. The rank sequence is plotted on the x-axis in<br>
the diagram while, other than in the display in<br>
accordance with figure 4, the y-axis plots a deviation<br>
20 a in µm that results from the actual value determined<br>
less the desired value. The zero line corresponds to<br>
the desired value in accordance with the characteristic<br>
35 in figure 4. Alternatively, the rank axis can also<br>
be output as a feature axis or as a neutral auxiliary<br>
25  axis.<br>
This display 27 shows by way of example four<br>
characteristics 42, 43, 44 and 46 that respectively<br>
display, by way of example, eleven measurement series<br>
30 on four different test items 11. It may be seen from<br>
the different courses of the characteristics 42, 43,<br>
44, 46 which test items 11 fulfill the requirements,<br>
and which test items or their individual measuring<br>
points  lie  outside  the  permissible  tolerance.  The<br>
35 characteristic 43 has a very flat gradient, and<br>
therefore comprises only slight deviations in the mean<br>
values from the desired value. This characteristic 43,<br>
as  well  as  the  characteristics  42  and  44,  lie<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
respectively within the tolerance between the upper and<br>
lower limiting values 32, 33. The characteristic 46<br>
shows that the rank value 10 lies on the upper limiting<br>
value 32, and that the rank value 11 lies outside the<br>
5 upper limiting value 32. In the case of the rank value<br>
10, a range of the measured values lies within the<br>
tolerance band in terms of the normal distribution,<br>
whereas the other half of the confidence interval lies<br>
outside the upper limiting value 32.<br>
10<br>
An item of additional information is that the rank<br>
values 10 and 11 are outliers defined as a poor part.<br>
It is clear from the display of the scatter band in<br>
relation to the mean value that no measured value of<br>
15 the rank 11 lies inside the permissible limit lines 32,<br>
33. The display 27 can be used to infer directly that<br>
the test item 11 that leads to a characteristic 43<br>
originates from a supplier who supplies a product of<br>
high quality. The test items 11 in accordance with the<br>
20 characteristics 42 and 44 are to be classed as of<br>
poorer quality than the test item in accordance with<br>
the characteristic 43. However, from a consideration of<br>
the confidence interval these are still within the<br>
upper and lower limiting values 32, 33. The test item<br>
25 11 in accordance with the characteristic 46 lies<br>
outside the quality range and is classed as a poor<br>
part.<br>
A good part can be assumed if the confidence interval<br>
30 that is illustrated by the characteristics 38 and 39<br>
lies within an upper and lower limiting value 32, 33,<br>
respectively, in relation to the mean values<br>
determined. Such a display 27 enables a quick statement<br>
on the product capability that takes account of the<br>
35 individual measurement at one or more measuring points<br>
of a product. The product capability is, furthermore,<br>
characterized by a parameter cp that results from a<br>
quotient of the tolerance,  or the upper and lower<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
limiting values 32, 33, and the confidence interval. An<br>
unpredictable process result obtains for characteristic<br>
values cp 
characteristic value equal to or greater than one.<br>
5 Process results can then be predicted statistically.<br>
This renders it possible to draw specific conclusions<br>
concerning causes of error. The aim is preferably a<br>
characteristic value of cp &gt; 3.<br>
10 A further quality criterion capable of being derived<br>
from the measurement series is the rank alternating<br>
frequency of the respective measuring points of similar<br>
test items 11. The lower the rank alternating frequency<br>
that results from the rank sequences of the mean values<br>
15 for the respective measuring points of a respective<br>
test item 11, the more uniform is the quality of the<br>
test item 11. It is then possible in the case of coated<br>
test items 11 to draw the inference that virtually<br>
identical process conditions obtain by means of which<br>
20 specific measuring points of a test item are provided<br>
with essentially the same layer thickness.<br>
The output of the values in accordance with figures 4<br>
and 5 on the basis of the preceding formation of the<br>
25 mean values from individual measurements, and of<br>
sorting by rank value enables a quick and simple<br>
assessment of the respective test item 11.<br>
The inventive method is also used, in particular, for<br>
30  statistical   process   control.   For   example,   a<br>
predetermined number of parts  are tested by using<br>
random samples within a predetermined time interval.<br>
The test items 11 and the measurement task, or the<br>
35 monitoring, can be applied in completely different<br>
fields. For example, time-dependent variations can be<br>
acquired at a measuring object. This would be the case,<br>
for example, with the action on a coating by UV light<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
or a medium. Such changes in state, or further changes<br>
in state can likewise be determined and tested. It is<br>
thereby also possible to find an opening for temporal<br>
factors in the evaluation in addition to the factors<br>
5  that are purely actually to be measured.<br>
The synchronism of equipment or systems can be tested<br>
and monitored as further examples of application. The<br>
same holds for the testing of travel paths or repeat<br>
10 accuracies of manipulators, or the precision of<br>
automatic mounting processes.<br>
By running a number of consecutive evaluation steps of<br>
the  individual measurements  and of the measurement<br>
15 series of one or more measuring objects, the above-<br>
named method illustrates in a very simple way which<br>
mean values of the random samples can be compared with<br>
one another and thus belong together, and which mean<br>
values  form individual  subgroups  that possibly  lie<br>
20 outside prescribed tolerances. The associated values<br>
relating to the subgroups can easily be verified in<br>
order to undertake a correction as appropriate.<br>
All  the  above-described  features  are  respectively<br>
25  essential per se to the invention, and can be combined<br>
with one another at will.<br><br>
