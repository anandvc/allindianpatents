HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed <br>
AND A WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM  <br><br><br><br><br>
\ FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
i	. ■■   '	)<br>
  The present irvention relates to a   sanitizing system adapted to retain the chemical<br>
   sanitizing age    for use in drinking water purification devices and to provide regulated<br>
  release of chemical sanitizing agent. The sanitizing system according to the invention<br>
can be suitable for any device which regulates the please of fluids/water/dissolving<br>
liquids   in    .-mestic water purification process?" such as (i)'inder gravity flow bucket<br>
type water purificatic   device (ii) on tap devices a   * institutional water purification<br>
device such as community water p "ification systems,   "he invention is also directed to<br>
a water purification system involving the said sanitizing system in which chemical<br>
sanitizing agent e.g.chlorine can be dosed continuously with precise control on the<br>
delivery of chlorine into water which is an essential requirement for drinking water<br>
purification purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is very important to improve the technology relating to water purification as the water supplies are becoming increasingly polluted. Many water bodies have become contaminated to a great degree and thus requires superior water purification systems.<br>
The presence of unwanted and potentially harmful contaminants in water, especially drinking water, is of concern to many people. This concern creates a desire for water treatment devices in the home and elsewhere. Many water treatment devices and methods have been developed to remove or neutralize chemical and particulate contaminants. Some of these devices and methods incorporate chemically active materials to treat the water. For example, activated carbon is capable of removing the bad taste and odor from water as well as chlorine and other reactive chemicals. Ion exchange resins are useful for removing metal and other ions from water. However, no single material or chemical has been found that will remove all contaminants.<br>
In addition to chemical and particulate contaminants, water often contains biological contaminants. These contaminants often can not be entirely removed by activated carbon, ion exchange resins, or other chemically active water purifiers.<br>
2<br><br>
It is well known that purification means/units usually require the fluids/water to be treated or used as a treatment media to traverse under gravity flow through various filtration / purification /sanitizing means/units to thereby effect contact with the active for such treatment or release of the active into the liquid/water to effect the treatment of the water/fluid or serve as a treatment media.<br>
US 458 4106 discloses a chforination system for distributing chlorine as the active in a hot tub or spa. The system regulates the flow of water through a mixing chamber with a valve or stopcock to control the rate of chlorine distribution. An assembly of venturies and baffles also regulates the flow of water through the mixing chamber and controls the size of particles of chlorination tablets that will flow out of the chlorination system.<br>
US6413416, discloses a water treatment apparatus comprising a water treatment vessel providing a water treatment zone which in use will contain a volume of water to be treated. It is also provided with a water treatment cartridge having a plurality of spokes at the lower end of the cartridge such that the lower most of the stack of water treatment tablets rests on the spokes.<br>
US 6298871 B1 discloses yet another chemical feeder that produces a solution of a chemical-treating agent for example sodium hypochlorite comprising a housing defining a cavity, and elongated substantial vertical hollow container is centrally located within the cavity. The bottom wall of the side wall of the container is adjacent to the base and contains a plurality of perforations in the lower portion of the side wall which is spaced from the inside wall of the housing. At least one hollow canister having a plurality of perforations in its base and the lower portion of its side-wall is interposed for examples slidably receive within the container. Conduits for delivering the liquid in which the chemical treating agent is provided to a chamber below the perforations in the canister and for removing the liquid stream containing the chemical treating agent from the feeder are also provided.<br>
3<br><br>
It would be apparent from the above that while several sanitizing/chlorination systems are well known and available to the art and also there exists several systems which involve the purification/chlorination/disinfecting by contact of the active with fluid/water to be treated, as regards the control over the rate of the water flow into the active dissolving zone of such systems it is mostly attended to by manually operable gadgets such as control valves or pumps, with or without perforation plates and venturies.<br>
Various water purification devices that are either gravity fed or on tap devices are known. Water purifiers for drinking water purposes have to be designed to achieve to kill 6 log bacteria and 4 log polio virus through regulated contact between chemical sanitizing agent and water. The delivery of the active agent from the chemical sanitizing agent which are generally used as tablets depends on the contact time between the tablet and water. This in turn depends on the flow rate of water and the surface area of tablet in contact with water.<br>
In a water filter the flow rate of water will be different depending on the available head e.g. the head is the height of water column in a gravity fed filter. There could be various other factors that control the flow rate in various different types of filters. In order to provide a regulated delivery of the active it is essential to ensure appropriate contact of inflowing water with the chemical sanitizing agent even when the flow rate of water changes substantially.<br>
In the co-pending application No.927/MUM/2002 a device for controlled release of fluid/water under gravity flow comprising an inlet end for the water/fluid entry from a source/supply and an outlet end for the regulated/controlled outflow of the fluid/water, said inlet end and the outlet end of the fluid/water path operatively connected to define at least one fluid/water flow path, said fluid/water flow path comprising a combination of straight path and at least one bend adapted for controlling the flow rate of water flowing there through under gravity.<br>

Description of the Invention:<br>
It is found by way of the above invention that in the chemical sanitizing system of the invention, the disposition of the nozzle with respect to the base of the sanitizing unit containing chemical sanitization agent and the angular convex surface of the nozzle are critical to achieve the desired regulated delivery of the sanitizing agent in the water. Importantly, the disposition of the housing/sanitizing unit base at least 0.25 mm from the tip of the nozzle for supply of the water and the convex outer surface of the nozzle having a selective angular disposition of 15-80° with respect to the base of the sanitizing unit is found to be selectively advantageous for regulated flow.<br>

6<br><br>
sanitizing unit having the chemical sanitizing agents in the form of tablets and the base of the canister has a plate with one or more perforations.<br>
The invention thus essentially comprises of a delivery system to provide uniform delivery of the active from the chemical sanitizing agent. The system consists of a nozzle through which water enters into the chemical sanitizing unit where water impinges the lower surface of a chemical sanitizing unit positioned at a distance of at least 0.25 mm from the tip of the nozzle. The water after providing a contact with the exposed tablet surface at the lower end of the chemical sanitizing unit trickles down along the conical outer body of the nozzle. Importantly, as stated above the invention provide for selectively (1) distance between the tip of the nozzle and the chemical sanitizing unit (2) the angle that conical outer surface of the nozzle makes with the lower end of the chemical sanitizing unit to thereby achieve the required regulated delivery of the actives.<br>
It is preferred to incorporate any flow-throttling device known in the art between the prefiltration unit and the chemical sanitizing unit. Examples of such flow throttling devices may be selected from manually operable gadgets such as control valves or pumps, with or without perforation plates and venturies, or other electrically, electronically, pneumatically or hydraulically actuated control valves or flow stop cocks, globe valves, taps or any such flow restricting devices. They can also be in the form of angular bends, spiral coils, or even a tube of proper diameter.<br>
The active can be any suitable purification/sanitizing agent in powdered, granular or tablet form preferably as tablets. It is also possible to use other conventional chlorine releasing compounds such as potassium dischloroisocyanurate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, chlorinated trisodium phosphate, calcium hypochlorite, lithium hypochlorite, monochloramine, dichloramine, [(monotrichloro)-tetra(monopotassium dichloro)] pentaisocyanurate, 1,3 dichloro-5,5-dimethylidanotone, paratoluene sulfodichloroamide,   thrichloromelamine,   N-chloramine,   N-chlorosuccinimide,   N,N'-<br>

Chemical sanitizing unit.<br>
This consists of a canister which is an elongated chemical sanitizing unit preferably of cylindrical cross-section holding biocide either in a sachet if the biocide is powder or tablets stacked one over the other on a perforated disc or a non woven fabric. There is an water inlet centrally located under the biocide holder. Water enters through the inlet, touches the surface of the tablets and exits through the windows (openings) on the periphery of the holder. In order to achieve this, the distance between the disc and water inlet is critical.<br>
The base of the canister is provided with one or more perforations to enable water to pass through. It is particularly preferred that the base is formed by a plate provided with one or more perforations. The number of perforations range from 5-100 but more preferably 5-60.<br>
The distance between the base of the canister and the nozzle through which the inlet water flows is critical and is maintained to be 0.25 to 10 mm, more preferably 0.25 to 5 mm and it is particularly preferred that it is 0.5-2 mm.<br>

Description in relation to the drawings:<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail  in  relation  to  non-limiting  exemplary embodiments  of the     water<br>
8<br><br>
purification system of the invention in combination with a chlorinating sanitizing system under gravity feed situation as per the accompanying figures wherein-<br>
Fig 1: Shows in   detail of   a chemical sanitizing   system in accordi ance   with the invention.<br>
In a gravity fed water purification system the purification would take place in three stages (1) pre-filtration: water will be pre-filtered using a particulate filter unit such as a carbon block to remove suspended matters and organic impurities in the water and cysts (2) germ-kill by chemical sanitizing agent that releases for e.g chlorine (3) chlorine scavenger: is provided to remove free chlorine from the treated water before water can be consumed. While in the case of gravity fed system a dwell chamber would provide the minimum residence time required to achieve the target kill, in the on tap device chlorine delivery will be so adjusted that a flow through kill is delivered by the system.<br>
In accordance with the water purification system of the invention the water after passing through a pre-filter in which the water is pre-filtered using a particulate filter unit such as a carbon block to remove suspended matters and organic impurities in the water and cysts is passed through the chemical sanitizing system of the invention as illustrated in detail in Fig. 1. For the purpose,, the water after passing through the pre-filter is lead through a tube which conveys it through a flow throttling device into the chemical sanitizing system (CSU) through a nozzle (N). There is provided a selective distance (D) as discussed above between the lower part of the canister (C) and the tip of the nozzle (NT). The convex outside (CO) of the nozzle makes an angle of 15-80 degrees with the base of the canister (C), which is provided with one or more &gt; perforation (P). The chemical sanitizing agent (For e.g Trichloro isocyanuric acid, TCCA) stacked as tablets (TB) releases the agent for e.g chlorine from the chemical sanitizing unit into the water which flows out of the openings (O) and is then passed through a carbon scavenger. The carbon scavenger is provided to remove free chlorine from the treated water before water can be consumed. The water from the outlet can enter the carbon scavenger either directly or through a dwell chamber. While in the case<br>
9<br><br>
of gravity fed system a dwell chamber would provide the minimum residence time required to achieve the target kill, in the on tap device chlorine delivery will be so adjusted that a flow through kill is delivered by the system.<br>
The operation of the system is detailed as hereunder:<br>
The purification system comprises of a top chamber fitted with a pre-filter made of a coarse sediment filter and activated carbon to enable removal of chlorine, organics, particulate matter and pathogenic cysts. The filtered water then goes through a flow throttling device that provides a flow rate of 500-50ml/min before the water flows into a chemical purification unit which has a chemical purifying agent such as trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) tablets. As the water passes through the chemical purification unit it leaches out a certain amount of the chemical purifying agent from the tablet. The chemical purifying agent is then scavenged by passing the water through a unit comprising bacteriostatic activated carbon and/or ion exchange resin or any other known means after a residence time which is a period of not less than 2 minutes and preferably up to 60 minutes of its exit from the chemical purifying unit.<br>
Examples:<br>
Determination of chlorine concentration in filtered water:<br>
1200 litres of Mumbai municipal supply of tap water was contaminated with 107 counts/ml of bacteriophages, 105 counts/I cysts, and 108 counts/ml bacteria. The water was passed through the water purifier according to the invention as described above. This water passes through a flow regulator and then into the chemical sanitizing unit comprising the canister/sanitizing unit holding the TCCA tablets. The base of the canister/sanitizing unit is formed by a sieve plate. The distance between the sieve plate and nozzle through which the inlet water flows (Referred to as "Distance"), the angle made by the convex outside of the nozzle with the base of the canister (Referred to as "Angle"), and the chlorine concentration are presented in Table 1. The sieve plate had a diameter 18 mm and the number of perforations in the sieve plate was maintained 9 where one of the perforation had a diameter of 4mm and the others had a diameter of 2<br>
10<br><br>
mm. The inlet flow rate was about 80 ml/min. The outlet water from the canister was passed through a scavenger unit and then the chlorine concentration in the purified water was measured using the procedure described in British / European Standard BS EN 12933:2000.<br>
A control unit with the chemical purifying device without the required gap between the inlet water but the angle made by the convex outside of the nozzle with the base of the canister was 30 degrees (Example 1) and where the required gap between the inlet water was 1 mm and the angle made by the convex outside of the nozzle with the base of the canister was greater than 80 degrees (Example 2) were maintained as controls.<br>

The data presented in Table 1 and 2 show that the distance and the angle in the chemical sanitizing unit is critical in controlling dissolution of the chemical sanitizing agent. It is thus possible by way of the present invention to achieve a simple device for regulation of flow rate related contact and thus release of the chemical sanitizing agent especially in water purification systems operated under gravity. The device is compact and can be available in the form of a cartridge for ready and diverse applications for such flow control. The device is further adapted for use in or with any conventional water source /pipeline, tap or purifying/sanitizing/disinfecting/filtration system requiring regulated supply of the sanitizing agent and should have wide utility especially for domestic and simple applications for like purposes.<br>
