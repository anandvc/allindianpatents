				<td>Description<br>
Method for operating an arrangement of a plurality of<br>
computers in the event of a computer failure<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating an<br>
arrangement of a plurality of computers which are set<br>
up to execute software units, provision being made of<br>
an additional monitoring computer for monitoring the<br>
computers and for intervening in the computers, and the<br>
status of the computers being repeatedly monitored.<br>
Computer arrangements of this type are known, inter<br>
alia, under the term server farm. Server farms usually<br>
comprise a large number of identical servers which are<br>
also referred to below as computers and on which the<br>
same or different services or applications run. Since<br>
all servers execute the services and applications<br>
independently of one another, faults in one server do<br>
not have a direct influence on the rest of the server<br>
farm. User inquiries are distributed to all members of<br>
the server farm in accordance with defined rules. This<br>
is the task of the monitoring computer. Mechanisms<br>
which have been implemented for distributing the load<br>
ensure that use of the individual servers corresponds<br>
to the respective processing capacity.<br>
The failure of one server is relatively unproblematic<br>
since only a few services and applications are affected<br>
thereby. Since the individual computers are relatively<br>
small and thus inexpensive devices, it is<br>
unproblematic, from the point of view of costs, to keep<br>
one or more standby computers ready, to which, after a<br>
computer has failed, the software units affected, i.e.<br>
services and applications, for example, are transferred<br>
in order to thus restore normal operation.<br><br>
However, server farms often comprise several hundred<br>
computers . In the case of these so-called blade<br>
servers, there is no need for the external wiring<br>
complexity since the computers are accommodated and<br>
connected in the form of a plug-in card. However, the<br>
problem with this design is that, in the event of a<br>
power supply unit, for example, failing, a plurality of<br>
computers are affected and thus a plurality of<br>
computers simultaneously fail. For economic reasons, it<br>
is not possible to provide, for every case, as many<br>
standby computers as are actually required on account<br>
of the failure. Satisfactory operation of the computer<br>
arrangement is thus not ensured in every case.<br>
When a software unit fails on account of the failure of<br>
a computer, it is known practice to transfer the<br>
software unit to a standby computer, that is to say to<br>
restart it there. If a plurality of computers fail, a<br>
plurality of software units are therefore affected. An<br>
attempt is then made, for each software unit, to find a<br>
standby computer or a sufficiently large amount of free<br>
capacity in a standby computer in order to be able to<br>
restart the software unit. This results in competitive<br>
situations, thus jeopardizing fault-free further<br>
operation.<br>
It is an object of the invention to specify a method<br>
for operating an arrangement of a plurality of<br>
computers, in which the best possible availability of<br>
the software units which are executed in the computer<br>
arrangement is ensured. In this case, both the failure<br>
of an individual computer and the failure of a<br>
plurality of computers are intended to be taken into<br>
account.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a method of the<br>
type mentioned initially which is characterized in that<br>
the software units are assigned a weighting in<br><br>
accordance with their importance, and the following-<br>
method steps are carried out in the event of a computer<br>
failing:<br>
information regarding all of the computers which<br>
have failed at the monitoring time and software units<br>
affected thereby is collected, and<br>
a transfer scenario for transferring the software<br>
units which are affected by the to other computers is<br>
determined using the weighting of the software units.<br>
The method according to the invention follows the<br>
finding that, under certain circumstances, a computer<br>
having sufficient free capacity cannot be found for all<br>
software units. A transfer scenario which specifies<br>
which software units are transferred to which computers<br>
is sought. Weighting the software units in accordance<br>
with their importance achieves the advantage that a<br>
transfer scenario which, when considered overall,<br>
constitutes an optimal solution is determined, the more<br>
important software units thus preferably being<br>
transferred to another computer, while unimportant<br>
software units are not restarted.<br>
The decisive advantage of the present method according<br>
to the invention is that the transfer of software units<br>
to other computers is determined not only with regard<br>
to an individual software unit but rather the server<br>
farm with its software units is considered as a whole<br>
in order to disrupt overall operation as little as<br>
possible. It is also advantageous that not only the<br>
failure of an individual computer can be taken into<br>
account but rather a plurality of computers which have<br>
simultaneously failed and the software units which have<br>
correspondingly failed are also included in the<br>
determination of a transfer scenario.<br><br>
In one advantageous refinement of the method according<br>
to the invention, a multiplicity of possible transfer<br>
scenarios are first of all determined and these<br>
scenarios are then assessed using	the weighting of the<br>
software units. The assessment of	the overall scenario<br>
can be used to discern which is the optimal scenario<br>
overall.<br>
In one development of the invention, the process of<br>
determining a transfer scenario includes the fact that<br>
active software units are terminated in other computers<br>
in order to create free capacity for transferring<br>
software units from computers which have failed. In<br>
this case, it is advantageous that unimportant active<br>
software units are terminated in order to create<br>
capacity for transferring software units which are of<br>
greater importance and were previously active in one of<br>
the failed computers.<br>
In one favorable refinement, the weighting is effected<br>
using a plurality of attributes, a first "license to<br>
kill" attribute specifying a measure of the power to<br>
have other active software units terminated in order to<br>
create free capacity and a second "shutdown limit"<br>
attribute specifying a measure of the resistance to the<br>
request for termination by other software packages in<br>
order to be transferred from a computer which has<br>
failed. The first attribute is used to determine which<br>
of the failed software units are preferably transferred<br>
to a standby computer, that is to say are restarted<br>
there. The second attribute is used to find out which<br>
of the active software packages are terminated in order<br>
to create space for transferring software packages<br>
which were previously active on a computer which has<br>
now failed.<br>
In this case, it is favorable that the behavior of the<br>
computer arrangement, when transferring failed software<br><br>
units, can be influenced by an administrator by<br>
appropriately allocating attributes.<br>
Within the scope of this application, software units<br>
may be services, applications or packages from an<br>
operating system and services and/or applications. The<br>
packages which were mentioned last and which are also<br>
referred to as "images" are used, in particular, in<br>
large server farms having blade servers. When booting a<br>
server within the server farm, an image is loaded from<br>
a central memory and is executed in the server. If a<br>
second server is intended to be started using the same<br>
application, a copy of the image is simply loaded into<br>
the second server and executed there. In this way, the<br>
configuration complexity is minimal.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the invention are<br>
specified in subclaims.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below<br>
using an exemplary embodiment. In the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows an arrangement having a plurality of<br>
computers and a monitoring computer, to which the<br>
method according to the invention can be applied,<br>
figure 2 shows a table corresponding to a first<br>
transfer scenario,<br>
figure 3 shows a table corresponding to a second<br>
transfer scenario, and<br>
figure 4 shows a flowchart of one exemplary embodiment<br>
of the method according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an arrangement having a plurality<br>
of computers 1, 2, 3, 4 and a monitoring computer 5.<br>
The computers 1, 2, 3 and 4 do not have a connection<br><br>
which has been set up to interchange data. However,<br>
they are connected to the monitoring computer 5 via<br>
lines 6. These connections which have been implemented<br>
in any desired manner and use the lines 6 are used to<br>
monitor the computers 1, 2, 3 and 4 and to intervene,<br>
if necessary, in the sequences in these computers.<br>
In the example shown, an operating system 0S1 and an<br>
application A1 are active in the computer 1. Active<br>
means that the operating system and the application are<br>
in a normal operating state. An operating system 0S2<br>
and an application A2 are active in the computer 2. In<br>
addition, two services D1 and D2 are running on the<br>
computer 2. An operating system 0S3 and two<br>
applications A3 and A4 as well as three services D3, D4<br>
and D5 are active in the computer 3. The computer 4 is<br>
a standby computer in which neither an operating system<br>
nor an application nor a service is active in the<br>
operating state shown.<br>
The monitoring computer 5 monitors the status of the<br>
computers 1, 2 and 3 at regular intervals of time T in<br>
order to determine whether they are in a normal<br>
operating state or whether there is a fault state (see<br>
figure 2). The computer 4 does not need to be monitored<br>
since the monitoring computer 5 is aware of its status<br>
as a standby computer. Monitoring may be configured in<br>
such a manner that the monitoring computer 5 sends an<br>
inquiry to the computers 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then waits<br>
to see whether a response is sent back. However,<br>
detectors which' automatically monitor the operating<br>
state and transmit a fault message to the monitoring<br>
computer 5 if there is a deviation from the normal<br>
operating state may also be provided in the computers<br>
1, 2, 3 and 4. Both types of monitoring may also be<br>
combined, that is to say the computers 1, 2, 3 and 4<br>
automatically transmit fault reports but also respond<br>
to inquiries from the monitoring computer 5.<br><br>
If the description of the invention refers to the<br>
reception or transmission of inquiries or reports by<br>
the "computers", this includes both information<br>
processing using hardware and processing using software<br>
by the respective active operating systems,<br>
applications or services.<br>
The computers 1, 2 and 3 may be operated using<br>
different operating systems. It must merely be ensured<br>
that message or command transmission via the lines 6<br>
functions in accordance with the same standard so that<br>
the monitoring computer 5 can communicate with all of<br>
the computers 1, 2, 3 and 4.<br>
In the embodiment described here, the computers 1, 2<br>
and 3 are checked (step 11) at regular intervals of<br>
time T, as shown in figure 4. If a fault is not<br>
established in step 12, the process waits for the point<br>
in time at which a new check is intended to be carried<br>
out. If a fault was detected, information regarding the<br>
software units affected is then collected (step 14). In<br>
an example scenario, it is assumed that the computers 1<br>
and 3 have failed. This fault was detected by the<br>
monitoring computer 5. In step 14, information<br>
regarding the software units which have been affected<br>
by the failures is then collected. In this case, it is<br>
established that the applications A1, A3 and A4 as well<br>
as the services D3, D4 and D5 have been affected by the<br>
failure. In addition, the available capacity is<br>
determined in a step 15 which subsequently takes place<br>
or takes place in parallel. In the present case, the<br>
computer 4 is available as a standby computer. If the<br>
capacity available in the latter does not suffice, it<br>
would be necessary to check the importance of the<br>
applications A2 and the services D1 and D2 which are<br>
active in the computer 2 in comparison with the<br><br>
importance of the applications A1, A3 and A4 and the<br>
services D3, D4 and D5 which are to be transferred.<br>
After the software units to be transferred and the<br>
available capacity have then been determined, possible<br>
scenarios for transferring the software units, which<br>
have been affected by the failure or failures, to other<br>
computers may be carried out (step 16) . A scenario<br>
which is optimal overall must then be selected from the<br>
multiplicity of possible scenarios. In this case,<br>
optimal overall means that both the interest in<br>
transferring failed software units to other computers<br>
is taken into account and operation of the software<br>
units, which are still active, is retained as<br>
completely as possible.<br>
Two situations occur, in principle. In the first<br>
situation, enough free capacity is available to be able<br>
to transfer all of the failed software units. In the<br>
other situation, the number of failed computers is<br>
greater than the number of standby computers.<br>
Therefore, in the submethods for determining the<br>
transfer scenario, it is first of all necessary to<br>
determine which of the failed software units are<br>
transferred to the standby computers. The importance of<br>
the remaining failed software units is investigated and<br>
it is determined whether or not they are transferred to<br>
another computer, the software units which are<br>
currently running on this computer being forced to be<br>
terminated. If it is not possible to find a new<br>
computer for all of the failed software units, the<br>
least important software units of the failed software<br>
units are determined and the entire process of<br>
determining the transfer scenario is started from the<br>
beginning.<br>
When creating possible transfer scenarios, it is also<br>
necessary to take into account whether a software unit<br><br>
is understood as meaning an application or a service or<br>
whether a software unit corresponds to an image. In the<br>
first case, the application or the services can be<br>
transferred to a computer in which other applications<br>
or services are already active and which is operated<br>
using a suitable operating system. In the second case,<br>
a completely free computer must be available since the<br>
image also comprises the operating system and only one<br>
image per computer is possible.<br>
One possible scenario for transferring applications and<br>
services is illustrated in the table shown in figure 2.<br>
Two attributes "license to kill" (L2K) and "shutdown<br>
limit" (SL) are assigned to the applications A1..A4 and<br>
to the services D1..D5. The first attribute L2K is a<br>
measure of the power to have other active software<br>
units terminated by the monitoring computer 5 in order<br>
to create free capacity. The second- attribute SL is a<br>
measure of the resistance to the request for<br>
termination by other software packages in order to be<br>
transferred from a computer which has failed. The fact<br>
of whether an application is terminated and sufficient<br>
capacity is thus provided for transferring another<br>
application thus depends on the "license to kill"<br>
attribute of the application to be transferred and on<br>
the "shutdown limit" attribute of the application which<br>
is still active and may possibly be terminated. The<br>
same applies in the case of a service. The attributes<br>
described are likewise assigned to said services.<br>
Returning to the scenario described in figure 1,<br>
according to which the computers 1 and 3 have failed,<br>
the computer 4 is available as a standby computer and<br>
an application A2 and two services D1 and D2 are<br>
already active in the computer 2, the optimal scenario<br>
shown in the table in figure 2 could result. The values<br>
entered in the table are to be understood such that 1<br>
is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. The<br><br>
higher the value, the higher the importance of the<br>
respective application or of the respective service.<br>
According to this example scenario, the applications A4<br>
and A1 are restarted in the standby computer 4, that is<br>
to say are assumed by the latter. There is no longer<br>
sufficient free capacity in the computer 4 for the<br>
application A3. However, the attribute L2K has the<br>
value 4 which is greater than the value of the<br>
attribute SL of the application A2 . Comparing these<br>
values reveals that the application A2 is to be<br>
terminated so that the application A3 can be restarted<br>
in the computer 2.<br>
The services D1 and D2 can continue to run on the<br>
computer 2. The service D3 in the computer 3 is<br>
restarted in the computer 2. The services D4 and D5 no<br>
longer have any space in the computers 2 and 4 . They<br>
have a very low value as regards the "license to kill"<br>
attribute, with the result that no services or<br>
application is/are terminated in order to create free<br>
capacity for the services D4 and D5. These services<br>
therefore cannot be transferred to another computer.<br>
In figure 3, transfer for each application or service<br>
is not considered but rather, in the case of a<br>
transfer, only the entire image can be transferred. The<br>
image I1 comprises an operating system 0S1 and an<br>
application A1, as were active in the computer A1<br>
before the failure. The image I2 comprises the<br>
operating system 0S2 which is running on the computer<br>
2, the application A2 and the services D1 and D2. The<br>
image I3 comprises the operating system 0S3 which was<br>
active in the computer 3 before the failure, the<br>
applications A3 and A4 and the services D4 and D5. The<br>
images are in turn assigned the attributes L2K and SL.<br>
According to the example scenario shown in figure 3,<br>
the image I1 is restarted in the computer 4, the image<br><br>
12 remains active in the computer 2 and no free<br>
computer can be found for the image 13. A1though the<br>
image 12 could be terminated in order to restart the<br>
image 13 in the computer 2, the "license to kill"<br>
attribute of the image I3 with the value 2 is less than<br>
the value of the "shutdown limit" attribute of the<br>
image I2. Therefore, the image I3 does not have the<br>
power to have the image I2 terminated in order to<br>
create free capacity.<br>
In step 17, the scenarios are thus assessed by linking<br>
the attributes of all active applications and all<br>
software units which are affected by the failure with<br>
the possible scenarios. In step 18, an optimal scenario<br>
is selected, on the basis of the weighting using the<br>
attributes in the situation described. In a step 19,<br>
the optimal transfer scenario determined is<br>
implemented, software units are terminated and failed<br>
software units are restarted in the newly determined<br>
computers, with the result that a transfer is effected.<br>
After this stable state has been reached, the method<br>
begins from the beginning with checking the status of<br>
the computers.<br>
The boundary conditions for creating a scenario follow<br>
defined rules. Rules which may play a role in forming<br>
transfer scenarios are described below:<br>
an image may simultaneously run only on one server<br>
and a server may simultaneously receive only one image;<br>
standby computers which are either idle or have<br>
been switched off are primarily used to transfer failed<br>
software units;<br>
if sufficient standby computers are not available,<br>
active computers are run down in order to receive<br>
images depending on the value of their attributes<br>
applications or services are correspondingly terminated<br>
in order to transfer failed services or applications;<br><br>
the submethods for determining the transfer<br>
scenario operate in such a manner that the selected<br>
transfer scenario has the most minor effects on the<br>
active computers - the selected transfer scenario<br>
should simultaneously satisfy the condition of<br>
transferring as many failed software units as possible;<br>
all important software units are first of all<br>
transferred to other computers in accordance with the<br>
abovementioned rules and the attributes which have<br>
likewise been described - if no transfer scenario which<br>
satisfies all of the requirements is possible, failed<br>
software units are excluded from the determination of a<br>
transfer scenario;<br>
there is only' one transfer per software unit<br>
software units which have been terminated cannot, for<br>
their part, terminate other active software units;<br>
there is no domino effect for computers having a low<br>
priority because they are frequently the victim of<br>
transfers.<br>
So that a transfer scenario can still be calculated,<br>
the status of the computers at a defined point in time<br>
is considered. This is repeated at defined intervals of<br>
time. A1l of the computer failures are handled at the<br>
same time in a single determination entity, so that the<br>
number of failed computers is fixed at a particular<br>
point in time and does not change while determining the<br>
transfer scenario. If further computers fail while<br>
calculating the transfer scenario, these failures are<br>
not taken into account until the next monitoring time.<br>
In an extended method, the ownership of the computers<br>
and the hardware of the computers can be taken into<br>
account in order to avoid "wasting" a powerful computer<br>
for a software unit which does not have sufficient<br>
importance for such a computer. Taking into account the<br>
ownership of a computer is important because it is<br>
customary in server farms for a customer to have its<br><br>
own server operated in the server farm. This inevitably<br>
results in such a computer not being available as a<br>
computer for transferring extraneous software units but<br>
rather only being able to be used by this customer.<br>
The ownership of the computers is taken into account<br>
using a third attribute "server group". A transfer<br>
scenario is only determined using computers which<br>
belong to the same "server group". The type of hardware<br>
of the computer is taken into account using a "server<br>
class" attribute. The more the failed computers<br>
correspond to the hardware of the computers which are<br>
taken into account for the transfer, the greater the<br>
affinity to this computer. "Suitable" is defined in<br>
consideration of the integer and string comparisons, as<br>
explained below.<br>
In one practical implementation, the attributes are<br>
stored in the form of strings or integers. If the<br>
individual attributes are compared, the operators '
, &gt;=, ==, /=' are used. Only the operator ' ==' is<br>
permissible for strings. On the basis of these<br>
settings, all of the computers and software units can<br>
be compared using the operators which were specified<br>
above. The optimal transfer scenario can thus be<br>
determined.<br>
In this manner, all of the computers and all of the<br>
software units are investigated in order to determine<br>
whether they are a potential destination for a<br>
transfer. This is, of course, carried out only when it<br>
is necessary, that is to say when computers have failed<br>
and are to be transferred, if possible, to another<br>
computer.<br>
The main task is to find the correct computers or<br>
software units which are run down in sight of the<br>
computers or software units which are running. The<br><br>
determination of this scenario may be a lengthy<br>
process. In the case of a large server farm having<br>
several hundred computers S and no standby computers,<br>
the number of variations to be taken into account when<br>
determining the transfer scenario in the case of a<br>
small number of failed computers F is calculated as<br><br>
For a server rack having 20 computers, the number of<br>
permutations when five computers fail is greater than<br>
3000. If a second server rack having a further 20<br>
computers is added, the number of permutations is<br>
greater than 50,000.<br>
In order to find an optimal transfer scenario from this<br>
large number of possible transfer scenarios, it may be<br>
necessary to use special computation methods. It must<br>
be ensured that the overall influence of each transfer<br>
scenario is taken into account. The effects depend on<br>
the attributes which were mentioned above.<br>
While the possible transfer scenarios are being<br>
calculated, the effects on the overall system are<br>
advantageously continuously calculated and predicted,<br>
even at the same time. Only the scenarios in which it<br>
is possible to have more minor effects on the overall<br>
system than the transfer scenarios which have already<br>
been investigated are determined in detail. This<br>
requires a type of sorting of ' the permutations to be<br>
investigated in order to ensure that the solutions with<br>
the most minor effects are handled first.<br>
This significantly speeds up the determination process.<br>
The determination process is terminated in advance if a<br>
transfer scenario which does not have any effects on<br>
active software units has been found. A so-called<br><br>
greedy algorithm is preferably used during the<br>
calculation.<br>
The concept described is capable of finding a transfer<br>
scenario which influences the computers and software<br>
units (which are running) to as slight an extent as<br>
possible, as many software units as possible nevertheless being transferred.<br>
The method according to the invention can also be used<br>
in virtual servers. Virtual servers are formed by one<br>
or more large servers being subdivided into "logical"<br>
servers and the arrangement then being able to be<br>
operated as if it were a plurality of physical servers.<br>
The software used for this purpose is referred to, for<br>
example, as VmWare.<br>
In a corresponding exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention, a large LINUX server drives a number of<br>
WINDOWS emulations via VmWare. The individual operating<br>
systems are monitored in exactly the same manner and,<br>
if appropriate, are moved to another virtual server, as<br>
would be the case with a plurality of physical servers.<br>
It is also possible to configure the system in such a<br>
manner that a computer is first of all restarted before<br>
the movement operation. This is of particular interest<br>
in virtual computers. If sufficient VmWare servers are<br>
not available, the "normal" movement path can be<br>
followed or a less important image is displaced and<br>
VmWare is started instead in order to be able to move<br>
the virtual servers which have failed or have been<br>
overloaded.<br><br>
