TITLE:<br>
SINGLE STROKE RECIPROCATING INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR AUTOMOBILES SUCH AS RACING MOTOR BIKES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the field of Internal Combustion engines. Particularly, the present invention relates to the field of single stroke reciprocating Internal Combustion engine for use in automobiles especially racing motorbikes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Conventionally, two and four stroke engines are used in automobiles such as passenger car and commercial vehicles.<br>
For automobiles such as racing motorbikes, use of two stroke engines have always been a preferred choice due to their ability to generate high power output.<br>
However, two and four stroke engines have several drawbacks which limit them from being used successfully in automobiles such as racing motorbikes. Such drawbacks include:<br>
(i)  	High power factor requirement<br>
(ii)	space requirement<br>
(iii)       balancing<br>
(iv)       twisting of crank shaft<br>
(v)	engine starting torque<br>
(vi)	complex valve mechanism and<br>
.<br><br>
(vii)     Flywheel design.<br>
Attempts have been made to provide a reciprocating engine which would overcome the drawbacks associated with two and four stroke engines and find successful application in automobiles such as racing motorbikes.<br>
One such engine is disclosed in Chinese Patent No. CN 1288102A entitled "single stroke piston type engine", by M/s. Jiang-AN Jing, China.<br>
The Chinese Patent No. CN 1288102A discloses a one-stroke Piston engine that features use of a reciprocating serial link structure, and is composed of dual-action cylinder, piston, piston rod, linking rod, crankshaft, distribution mechanism, cooling mechanism, lubricating mechanism, supply system and ignition system. The advantage of the engine being that four actions are performed in a single stroke.<br>
Eventhough the engine disclosed in the Chinese Patent No.CN1288102A would overcome the power factor problems associated with two and four stroke reciprocating IC engines, a need still exists for developing an engine which would not only offer high power factor but also overcome the problems of space requirement, balancing, crankshaft twisting, engine starting torque, complexity in valve design and flywheel design associated_with two and four stroke engines for successful application in automobiles such as racing bikes.<br>
Our inventors, by dint of determined research and intuitive knowledge have developed a single stroke engine which would overcome all the foregoing drawbacks associated with two and four stroke engines for successful application in racing motorbikes.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A detailed description of the preferred embodiments and best mode for practicing the invention are described herein:<br>
The present invention discloses a single stroke reciprocating internal combustion engine suitable for use in automobiles such as racing motorbikes. The single stroke reciprocating internal combustion engine according to the present invention is adapted for working on Otto cycle and is capable of developing power for every half revolution of the crankshaft.<br>
The components and associated functional features of the engine will become apparent from the description given herein:<br>
FIG.1 In the embodiment shown, the engine comprises a cylinder block (10) having a pair of oppositely arranged cylinders (12) whose inner surfaces are machined to required accuracy and tolerance so as to allow substantial smooth reciprocation of a piston (15) shown in Fig1. The cylinder block (10) is preferably made by casting as a single integral block (as illustrated in Fig1). Iternatively, the cylinder block (10) may also be cast separately with flanges (not illustrated) and assembled together using a plurality of fasteners.<br><br>
The cylinder block (10) is preferably made of a high strength and high rigidity material preferably cast iron of grade C444, C4 40, C415-32, C432. Alternatively, the cylinder block (10) may also be cast from aluminum alloy of grade ACJ14 and C3-26. There may also be one or more rows of cylinders arranged in parallel and in opposing fashion.<br>
Preferably the cylinder block (10) is mounted along the vertical direction during assembling on to the automobiles.<br>
The cylinders (12) are preferably identical and are axially aligned in a mutually facing relationship with each other (as illustrated in Fig1).<br>
In the embodiment shown (see Fig1) a cylinder head (14) is mounted to each cylinder (12) through a flanged joint. A plurality of cooling fins (16) is provided on the outer surface of the cylinders (12) for dispersing combustion heat to the external.<br>
Each cylinder (12) comprises an inlet valve (18) for entry of combustion gas through a carburetor (not shown) and an exhaust port (19) for outlet of exhaust gas from the cylinder (12).<br>
The piston unit, according to the present invention comprises a pair of piston members (15) connected together by a T- link (17) having an eye end similar to a knuckle joint as shown in Fig 1.<br>
The T- link (17) preferably has a circular cross section and is preferably made by forging. Alternatively, the T-link (17) has an I - cross-section or C-cross-section.<br>
The piston member (15) is made of preferably aluminum alloy having a tensile strength of about 50-90 Mpa. For working range of piston above 6 m/sec, grey cast iron having tensile strength of about 35 to 40 MPa is preferred.<br><br>
Referring to Fig 1, a connecting rod (30) connects the free end of the T-Link (17) to a crankshaft (32). The connecting rod (30) comprises a small end (33) and the big end (34) and has a length which is substantially equal to twice the stroke of the piston member (15).<br>
The connecting rod (30) is fabricated using carbon and alloy steels having high resistance to fatigue. Preferably, the connecting rod (30) is made by casting from steel of grade 40,45l 2. The small end (33) is connected to the piston member (15) while the big end (34) is connected to the crankshaft (32) through independent bushes (not illustrated) which help in reducing wear and also provide bearing effect.<br>
The crankshaft is made of machined carbon . and alloy steels of grades 18XHBA, 40XHMA and heavy duty cast iron. The crankshaft, according to the present invention does not have balance weights as there is no idle stroke in the engine.<br>
A pair of eccentric cams (50) are individually axially opposite at each end of crank shaft (32).<br>
Fig 2. The engine according to the present invention comprises a valve actuation mechanism which comprises a follower rod (40) which sit one end comes into periodical contact with the eccentric cam (50). A wedge (42) is configured at other end of the follower rod (40). A roller ( 44) mounted to one end of a valve slider (46) with roller (44) at one end, engages with the wedge (42) such that rotation of cam (50) results in actuation of the inlet valve (18) thrbugh the wedge-roller engagement, thereby resulting in control of inflow of combustion gas into the cylinders accordingly.<br><br><br>
Exhaust ports (19) (see Fig 3) are provided for outlet of combustion gas from the cylinder.<br>
Referring to Fig 3, the position of piston members (15) is at Top Dead Centre (TDC) and the cylinders are represented by WS1 &amp; WS2. In WS1, when complete compression of the combustion gas occurs, in WS2, suction of fresh charge occurs through the inlet valve (18). As the piston member (15) reaches TDC, the inlet valve in WS2 opens and fresh charge of air and fuel for combustion accumulated due to gravity, in pipe connected to inlet from the carburetor, flows in for accumulation in cylinder WS2.<br>
Alternatively, the fuel supply may also be carried out using a Multi Point Fuel Injection System (MP.FI).<br>
At this stage, in WS1, the spark plug (13) (see Fig 3) ignites and due to the resulting combustion forces, the piston member (15) moves downwards from TDC, generating power. The connecting rod (30) converts the reciprocation of the piston member (15) into rotation of the crankshaft (32).<br>
Simultaneously, combustion exhaust from WS1 is exhausted through the exhaust port (19). Thus the piston members operate in complementary relationship with each other and this cycle is repeated for generation of power for every half revolution of the crankshaft (32).<br>
The engine according to the present invention does not require a fly wheel to store the energy and deliver the same whenever required.<br>
The requirement of flywheel for starting of the engine is also eliminated as the engine may be started using an induction motor.<br>
Thus, while there have been shown and described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the present invention as applied to preferred<br><br><br>
embodiments thereof, it will be understood that the described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive and various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form and details of the methods described may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Substitutions of elements from one described embodiment to another are also fully intended and contemplated. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.<br><br><br>
