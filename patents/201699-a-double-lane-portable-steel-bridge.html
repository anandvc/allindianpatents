The present invention relates to a double-lane, portable, steel bridge of unique design. More particularly, this invention pertains to design and construct a simple, through-type bridge, which can be assembled and erected on site as the components can be transpoted easily and can span a void or gap of nearly 270-ft width. So much so, skilled personnel can assemble and erect a double-lane bridge in couple of day's time, a feat not achievable by conventional bridge-building and erection.<br>
Need was felt for designing a portable bridge and Indian Army Engineers came up with a functional, but small bridge assembly which could span a void of around 60-ft, and capable of handling single-lane traffic. Such bridges were in demand by various agencies, apart from army, Border Security Forces or similar authorities / agencies, border road authorities, P.W.D. (roads), Indo-Tibetan Border Authorities, and various State Governments, particularly in the North-Eastern States and also in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and the like places having difficult terrain where regular road bridges are extremely difficult to build.<br>
After the Indo-China war in 1962, road-building activity was geared up, mainly for speedy troop movement and also to maintain the supply-lines to the strategically important forward areas. Moreover, with the implementation of different development plans to provide people living in remote, difficult to access areas, roads had to be built as a communication link between those people and the administration. In building such roads, numerous voids or gaps had to be bridged. To begin with single lane, portable bridges were found useful.<br>
In recent times multispan reployable bridges, as described and claimed in Indian Patent Application SI. No. 191281, have been introduced but the design is relatively complex, apart from being expensive and having time-consuming assembling and dismantling operation.<br>
With the passage of time and with the rise in population growth and traffic density, it was noticed that such single-lane bridges were becoming bottlenecks, impeding flow of traffic which was creating a lot of problems. Traffic-jam was becoming a regular feature and hence it had become very important to come out with a double-lane, portable, steel bridge which would avoid the difficulties confronting the single-lane bridge.<br>
SBD/DS/mE-l/ PATENT<br><br>
3<br>
Initially it was believed that escalation of the dimensional parameters of a single-lane bridge could provide the answer. But it was found that simple escalation did not and could not produce a bridge which was structurally sound, stable and capable of withstanding stress and strains of heavy, two-lane traffic.<br>
The principle object of this invention is to provide a double-lane, portable, steel bridge capable of providing a satisfactory solution to the problems discused above.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a ready to assemble or to dismantle a steel bridge which is ideally suited for spanning voids, or chasms in difficult terrain.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a double-lane, portable, steel bridge which is structurally stable, sturdy and capable of withstanding stress and strains of heavy,   two-lane, up and down traffic.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a portable steel bridge, in which any one or more of the constituent components can be readily replaced substituted with ease in the event of wear and tear due to atmospheric corrosion, or due to craks or breakage on account of natural causes like earthquake.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which provides for a double-lane, portable, steel bridge which comprises in combination:<br>
(a)	detachable panels forming load bearing girders on both sides of the<br>
bridge;<br>
(b)	bracing frames for holding the formed girders firmly in place ;<br><br>
4<br>
(c)	a plurality of transoms laid across the bottom chords of panels<br>
connecting and spacing the main girders apart and at the same<br>
time carrying the steel-decked roadway for allowing two-way flow of<br>
traffic;<br>
(d)	a plurality of base plate and bearing assembly provided at both ends<br>
of the bridge on which the terminals or ends of the aforesaid girders<br>
rest,<br>
characterised in that the load-bearing girders are composed of a number of modular units called panels pinned together at ends and placed side to side, if necessary and/or desired, and the entire structure is reinforced for safety reasons by addition of chord reinforcements to the top and bottom of each truss.<br>
The aforesaid panels may be of the following dimensions : heights 1448 or 2137 mm ( 57" or 84") and lengths 3048 or 4572 mm ( lO'-O" or 15'-0"), respectively.<br>
Load-bearing capacity of the girders are made to increase by adding extra panels alongside, called herein as "truss", and a row of panel put on top of panels, hereinafter called "storey".<br>
These girders are connected crosswise by transoms, which are reinforced steel joists, resting on the bottom chord of panels and carry the roadways superstructure. These transoms are tied to the panel chords by suitable holding means called "transom clamps" and fix the trusses in position at predetermined distances apart.<br>
End posts, male and female, are provided for connecting female and male lugs, respectively, at the end panels of each truss of the bridge for distributing the shear forces due to end reaction of the bridge. These end posts attached to the ends of each truss of bridge girder are supported on bearings which rest over base plates placed on the ground at each end of the span. Such base plates are intended to spread the load from the bearings evenly over an area of the ground.<br><br>
5<br>
Apart from the foregoing, a few other notable features are included in the double-lane bridge of the present invention. For instance, sway braces fabricated from channels are fitted diagonally between the transoms, and vertical braces fabricated from angles are provided along said sway braces.<br>
A plurality of ribands of varying lengths are fixed to the steel decks.<br>
The steel decks serving as the road surface have serrated, honey-comb or ribbed structure to prevent skidding of vehicles during passage over the bridge. These decks are of varying dimensions and used in varying numbers for completion of the road surface. For instance,four numbers of long and short decks are required per bay and four numbers of end decks are required at each end.<br>
Usually all the components of the bridge, including erection equipment and rollers are transported to the bridge site by trucks. The person in charge of erection, the Engineer, commences the work by setting a peg on either side of the void or gap to be bridged to represent the bridge centre-line, and then decide on the bank convenient for launching.<br>
The bridge is erected on launching rollers complete with a temporary skeleton cantilever structure, known as "launching nose", fitted at the front. The length of the *nose' depends on the width of the span to be bridged. The assembly is then launched across the gap by pushing / pulling on the rollers.<br>
All panels pins, bolts and nuts are electro-zinc plated to a coating thickness of around 0.025 mm., followed by chromate passivation to ensure long life under extreme service conditions.<br><br>
6<br>
Other steel components are sand- or shot-blasted to ensure removal of rust and mill scale. Then the components are given a priming coat, usually a coat of red lead or red oxide-zinc chromet primer. The priming coat is followed by 2 coats of finishing paint to specific customer requirement.<br>
Components highly susceptible to corrosion are supplied in hot-dip galvanized conditions. If so desired, the complete bridge may be supplied in galvanized condition and/or coated with special paint like epoxy or polyurethane to ensure prolonged resistance to adverse superincumbent conditions.<br>
Usually the material of construction of all the components is steel, preferably high tensile steel. The decks, however, can be made from metal reinforced polymeric materials like polypropylene, polystyrene, high density polyethylene, polyurethane, or copolymers thereof. Although such substitution reduces the overall weight of the bridge and the materials are highly non-reactive, but cost - consideration often discourages the potential users. Trials will shortly be carried out at our end to find a suitable answer to the question of cost-factor involving non-ferrous, polymeric parts.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which -<br>

Fig. 16       shows a riband (13) to be placed on the deck.<br>
Turning next to Fig. 1, it may be observed that panels (1) are joined end to end forming the girders. Each pair of girders are firmly held in place by means of bracing frame (6). The ends of panels are attached to post ends (7), secured by panel pins (2). The bases of the post ends (7) are made to rest on base plate (1 l)carrying a plurality of bearings (10). Four such base plates (11)<br>
and bearing (10) assemblies are provided at two ends of the bridge. Steel decks<br>
(12) are placed on and secured to transoms (14) which are fixed to the girders by<br>
means of clamp transom (4). These decks are held in place without any lateral displacement with the help of holding down bolts. Steel decks are of varying dimensions, namely, long, short and end decks. Accordingly, the ribands are also made of varying lengths, e.g. long, short and end ribands(13)<br>
As stated earlier, Fig. 2 shows a sectional view of the transom/ at the end of which there are attached a plurality of panels. The thin middle line in each of these columnar figures represents the central line of each individual panel.<br><br><br>
8<br>
In Fig. 3, there has been shown details of fixed and free ends of the bridge assembly which are to be grouted or embedded in ground. The topmost horizontal line on the left denotes the road level and that in the middle denotes the top of the deck. It may be observed that the levels of the road and top of the deck are substantially the same, which ensures a smooth flow of vehicular traffic without any bump or jerk.<br>
Figs. 4 to 16 of the drawings show various constituent components of the bridge assembly ; brief narrations of individual components are given below.<br>
Pig. 4 showing panel MKII is the basic bridge member, made from 
The chords at top and bottom of the panel terminate at one end in a male lug and at the other end in a female lug. These male and female lugs enable the panels to be connected end to end with panel pins (2).<br>
Holes provided in the top and bottom chords take chord bolts (3) to connect panels together forming multiple storey or to connect Chord-reinforcements to reinforce the trusses.<br>
Four transom seatings are provided on the bottom chord to accomodate the transomsCO*.       l^<br>
In both chords and end verticals, holes are provided for fixing bracing frames (6). The top holes in the end verticals are used for fitting the rakers or tie plates (5). All verticals have a slot above the transom seat to take transom clamps (4).<br><br>
9<br>
Panel pin shown in Fig. 5 of the drawings is used to connect panels together and is made from special alloy steel of high yield strength, which is usually electro-zinc plated to avoid corrosion. The panel pin is inserted through holes in the male and female lugs in the panels and secured with safety pin or split pin.<br>
Chord bolt shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings is a steel bolt, electro-zinc plated to resist corrosion. This is used to connect a panel above or below a panel to form multistorey bridge. The shanks of the bolts are tapered to assist drawing the panels into correct alignment during assembly.<br>
In Fig. 7, there is shown a clamp transom (4), which is an articulated fastening means used to hold a transom in its seating on the panel. It connects at the slots in the panel vertical and the transom seat, and is tightened by a vice-handle type of screw. It is to be borne in mind that jacks are not to be placed under a transom held by clamps as the connection is not designed for an upward load.<br>
Tie plate illustrated in Fig. 8 of the drawings secures the third truss to the second in triple truss standard width bridges and is a flat steel plate with a hollow conical dowel at each end. It is fixed to the panels and end posts (7) with bracing bolts (9). It is used in the undernoted positions -<br>
(i) In a triple truss single storey bridge, between the unoccupied raker holes in the panels at each joint. One tie plate is used on each side of the bridge at each joint, between the front panel verticals.<br>
(ii) In a triple truss double storey bridge, in the same holes as in (i) above and, in addition, in the corresponding holes, in the upper storey, between the front-end panel verticals. Tie plates cannot be used on the ends of triple truss where a bracing frame (6) is fitted.<br>
(iii)    Across the top of end posts in triple truss bridges.<br><br>
10<br>
In Fig. 9 there is shown a bracing frame, which is a light mild steel<br>
i welded frame with a hollow conical dowel at each corner. It is used to brace<br>
together panels in multiple truss and storey construction of bridge girders in the following positions :-<br>
(i) In a multiple truss single storey bridge, horizontally across the centre of the top chords of the panels.<br>
(ii) In double storey bridges, in a similar position, horizontally across the top chords of the panels, and additionally, in a vertical position across the rear verticals of second storey panels.<br>
(iii) In double storey bridges, vertically across the front end verticals of the second storey panels in the first bay at the head end of the bridge.<br>
Fig. 10 of the drawings is for a pair of post ends, female and male.<br>
to<br>
An end postymust be attached to each end of every main girder truss to transmit the end reaction of the bridge to the bearing (10). The female end post connects to the male lugs at the ends of the panels; two holes are provided at the top end of the post, the lower one for connecting to the bottom storey panel and the upper one for the second storey panel. Connections are made with panel pins. The bottom end of the post embodies a half round bearing block, which fits over the bearing. A step is fitted to the end post to carry the transom, which has always to be placed outside the end panel vertical at the head of the bridge only when using two transoms per bay. This step in used for jacking, but jacks may also be placed under the transom carried by the end posts, because this is held in position by a hinged bracket.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a short chord bolt which is similar in design and finish as chord bolt (3) shown in Fig. 6, except that the overall length is less than<br>
(15)<br>
the latter. This is used to connect the chord reinforcements/to the;panel chords to chord re-inforced bridges.<br><br>
11<br>
Bracing bolt shown in Fig. 12 of the drawings is rust proof and is equipped with a special lug on the head to prevent rotation at the time of tightening the nut. This is used for the undernoted purposes :-<br>
(i)      Attachment of rakers (16) to transoms and panels (1).<br>
(ii)     Attachment of bracing frames (6) to panels (1). (iii)    Attachment of tie plates (5) to panels (1).<br>
Fig. 13 of the drawings illustrates bearing assembly which spreads the load of the bridge to the base plate. It is a welded steel assembly carrying a round bar upon which the half round bearing of the end post rests. This bar is divided into three lengths by two stiffeners. In the single truss bridge the end post is arranged to bear on the centre length. In the double truss bridge, two bearings are used, so that each truss rests on the centre length of each bearing. In the triple truss bridge, the inner truss bears as before but the outer trusses bear on the two outer positions of the second bearing. Thus it is seldom necessary to use more than two bearings at each end of every main girder for any bridge.<br><br>
Fig. 14 of the drawings depicts a baseplate(11)which is designed to<br>
spread the load from the bearings evenly over an area of ground. It is a welded steel assembly of which the centre forms a sunken platform to accomodate the bearings. One baseplate is adequate for one corner of the bridge, whether the construction is of a single, double or triple truss, but the bearing pressure on the ground must be carefully checked for safety reasons.<br>
The bearing (10) as shown in Fig. 13 can move around 229 mm (ca9") longitudinally on the baseplate. For bridges on fixed supports, this movement is largely to assist in erection and also allows for expansion of the bridge.<br><br>
12<br>
Fig. 15 of the drawings depicts the steel deck over which passes the two way traffic. Hexagonal patterns are usually made on the upper surface of such decks which effectively prevents skidding. Two recesses are made on each side of the deck to allow them to sit snugly on the frames mounted therefor. These decks may be of long, short and end varieties, and 4 numbers of long and short decks are required per bay and 4 numbers of end decks are required at each end.<br>
Fig. 16 shows ribands which are fabricated from plates and bolted to decks. These also may be of varying dimensions, e.g. long, short and end ribands.<br>
Apart from the foregoing, a few other components play an important role, which are as follows :<br><br><br><br>
(a)	Raker (5)	:        This is made from high tensige R.S. channel It connects<br>
'the end of the transom to the top of the inner truss and imparts lateral stability<br>
to the truss. Hollow conical dowels are fitted at each end, which serve to draw the panels into correct alignment by engaging the holes in the panel and transom. One raker is used on each side of the bridge at every panel junction point, fastened^ means of bracing bolt (9).<br>
(b)	Sway braces (not.ghow*)-Horizontal sway braces are fabricated from channels and<br>
are fitted diagonally between the transoms lending strength and stability to the<br>
bridge structure.<br>
C) Vertical bracesMsMThese braces are fabricated from angles and are used along with horizontal sway braces.<br><br>
13<br>
The workability and uniqueness of the portable, double lane bridge were verified after fabricating a prototype of 80' - span bridge as shown in the following example, which is given by way of illustration and not by way of<br>

The bridge was equipped with strain gauges and dial gauges before placing test-loads in the form of steel / concrete blocks to simulate Class-24 R loading of "IRC-6" and bridge response was measured to evaluate actual tensile / compressive strain and vertical / axial deflections under symmetric and eccentric loadings as well as their Influence lines'. Extrapolated central deflections and maximum tensile / compressive strains were obtained from 'influence lines' for various combinations of wider spans and loadings. The results are shown below in a tabular form, which are in good agreement with the 3-D analysis referred to above:<br>
