WIRELESS IC DEVICE AND COMPONENT FOR WIRELESS IC DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless IC device<br>
used for a radio frequency identification (RFID) system that<br>
performs data communication in a noncontact manner through<br>
electromagnetic waves, and a component for the wireless IC<br>
device.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, an article management system has been<br>
using an RFID system which includes a reader/writer that<br>
generates an induction field and a wireless IC device that<br>
stores predetermined information allocated to an article,<br>
and noncontact communication is established between the<br>
reader/writer and the wireless IC device to transmit the<br>
information therebetween.<br>
FIG. 1 are a views that show an example of a noncontact<br>
IC tag (wireless IC device) in which an IC tag label is<br>
attached to an IC tag antenna, which is described in Patent<br>
Document 1. FIG. 1(A) is a plan view. FIG. 1(B) is an<br>
enlarged cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A in<br>
FIG. 1(A). The noncontact IC tag antenna is formed of two<br>
separated antenna patterns 91 and 92. The antenna patterns<br>
91 and 92 each are formed of a layer of metal thin films.<br><br>
Antennas 101 and 102 are formed on a label base<br>
material 82b of the noncontact IC tag label 82, and an IC<br>
chip 85 is mounted thereon. The antennas 101 and 102 of the<br>
noncontact IC tag label 82 are attached to be in contact<br>
with the antenna patterns 91 and 92 via an anisotropic<br>
conductive adhesive 84 to thereby form a noncontact IC tag<br>
90.<br>
A sealant film 83 is laminated on the label base<br>
material 82b to prevent peeling of the IC tag label, and<br>
finally an IC tag attached package 81 is formed.<br>

Publication No. 2003-243918<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
The noncontact IC tag of Patent Document 1 and the<br>
package provided with the noncontact IC tag have the<br>
following problems.<br>
(a) Because antenna patterns are formed in a process<br>
different from the process in which a package is formed, a<br>
process of producing an antenna is required. This causes<br>
the process to be prolonged and requires an additional<br>
member to thereby increase production costs for the package.<br>
(b) To obtain a sufficient radiation characteristic, it<br>
is necessary to increase the size of the antenna pattern,<br>
and, therefore, it is difficult to attach a tag to a small<br><br>
article.<br>
(c) Because a tag is formed on the base material of an<br>
article and another film covers the formation face of the<br>
tag, the thickness of the IC tag formation portion increases.<br>
Then, it is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
wireless IC device that eliminates the above problems,<br>
reduces production costs for a package, enables attachment<br>
to a small article, and suppresses the thickness of the tag<br>
formation portion.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
To solve the above problems, a wireless IC device of<br>
the invention is formed as follows. (1) A wireless IC<br>
device includes: a high-frequency device, which is an<br>
electromagnetic coupling module or a wireless IC chip itself,<br>
said electromagnetic coupling module being formed of a<br>
wireless IC and a power supply circuit substrate that is<br>
electrically connected or electromagnetically coupled to the<br>
wireless IC while being coupled to an external circuit; and<br>
a radiation electrode, which is portion of an article and<br>
operates as a radiator, wherein the high-frequency device is<br>
mounted on the radiation electrode, and wherein the<br>
radiation electrode is coupled to the high-frequency device.<br>
According to the above configuration, for example,<br>
processes or members for forming an antenna pattern shown in<br>
FIG. 1 on an article are unnecessary. Thus, there is almost<br><br>
no increase in cost for providing a wireless IC device for<br>
an article.<br>
In addition, because the entire or portion of the<br>
article may be utilized as a radiator, a sufficient<br>
radiation characteristic may be obtained even when it is<br>
attached to a small article.<br>
Furthermore, because the thickness of a portion on a<br>
base material of the article, at which the high-frequency<br>
device is provided, may be reduced, a protrusion of the<br>
high-frequency device portion may be suppressed and,<br>
therefore, an appearance is not influenced.<br>
Moreover, by using the electromagnetic coupling module,<br>
impedance matching between the wireless IC chip and the<br>
radiation electrode may be designed within the power supply<br>
circuit substrate. Thus, it is not necessary to limit the<br>
shape or material of the radiation electrode, and it may be<br>
applied to any articles.<br>
(2) The radiation electrode includes a conductive<br>
portion having a predetermined area, wherein a cutout<br>
portion is provided at an edge of the conductive portion,<br>
and wherein the high-frequency device is arranged at the<br>
cutout portion while the high-frequency device is coupled to<br>
the conductive portion at the cutout portion of the<br>
conductive portion.. According to the above configuration,<br>
the high-frequency device may be arranged so as not to<br><br>
protrude from the profile of an article, and the conductive<br>
portion may be effectively used as a radiator.<br>
(3)	The radiation electrode includes a conductive<br>
portion having a predetermined area, wherein the conductive<br>
portion partially has a non-conductive portion, and wherein<br>
the high-frequency device is arranged at an end in the non-<br>
conductive portion while the high-frequency device is<br>
coupled to the conductive portion around the non-conductive<br>
portion. According to the above configuration, the high-<br>
frequency device may be arranged so as not to protrude from<br>
the profile of an article, and the conductive portion may be<br>
effectively used as a radiator.<br>
(4)	In addition, the wireless IC device of the<br>
invention includes a loop electrode that is coupled to the<br>
high-frequency device and that is directly electrically<br>
connected to the radiation electrode, wherein the loop<br>
electrode is provided at a mounting portion, at which the<br>
high-frequency device (adjacent to a mounting area) is<br>
mounted, so that a loop plane of the loop electrode is<br>
oriented in a direction of a plane of the radiation<br>
electrode. According to the above configuration, it. is<br>
possible to easily match the high-frequency device with the<br>
loop electrode, and the loop electrode is strongly coupled<br>
to the radiation electrode, so that a high gain may be<br>
obtained.<br><br>
(5)	In addition, the wireless IC device of the<br>
invention includes a loop electrode provided at a mounting<br>
portion (adjacent to a mounting area) at which the high-<br>
frequency device is mounted, wherein the loop electrode is<br>
coupled to the high-frequency device and is<br>
electromagnetically coupled to the radiation electrode via<br>
an insulating layer. According to the above configuration,<br>
it is possible to easily match the high-frequency device<br>
with the loop electrode, and the loop electrode is insulated<br>
from the radiation electrode in terms of direct current, so<br>
that it is possible to enhance resistance against static<br>
electricity.<br>
(6)	A matching circuit is provided between the mounting<br>
portion of the high-frequency device and the loop electrode,<br>
wherein the matching circuit directly electrically connects<br>
the high-frequency device with the loop electrode.<br>
According to the above configuration, the matching circuit<br>
may be utilized as an inductor for matching an impedance<br>
between the radiation electrode and the high-frequency<br>
device. Thus, the degree of freedom for designing impedance<br>
matching for a wireless IC device is increased, and, in<br>
addition, the design becomes easy.<br>
(7)	A resonant circuit and/or a matching circuit is<br>
provided in the power supply circuit substrate. According<br>
to the above configuration, selectivity of frequency<br><br>
increases. Thus, the operating frequency of the wireless IC<br>
device may be mostly determined using the self-resonant<br>
frequency. In accordance with the above, it is possible to<br>
transfer (exchange) energy of a signal having a frequency<br>
used in an RFID system with high efficiency. This may<br>
improve the radiation characteristic of the wireless IC<br>
device.<br>
In addition, by providing the matching circuit in the<br>
power supply circuit substrate, it is possible to transfer<br>
(exchange) energy of a signal having a frequency used in an<br>
RFID system with high efficiency.<br>
(8)	A resonant frequency of the resonant circuit<br>
substantially corresponds to a frequency of a signal<br>
exchanged by the radiation electrode.<br>
By so doing, the radiation electrode is simply coupled<br>
to a power supply circuit portion and just needs to have a<br>
size corresponding to a necessary gain. It is not necessary<br>
to limit the shape or material of the radiation electrode<br>
depending on a frequency used, and it may be applied to any<br>
articles.<br>
(9)	The radiation electrode is, for example, a metal<br>
film layer of an article package such that a sheet having a<br>
conductive layer is formed into a bag-like shape or a<br>
package-like shape. According to the above configuration,<br>
an article package having a metal film layer may be utilized<br><br>
without any change,, and almost the entire article operates<br>
as a radiator. Even when a plurality of articles are<br>
overlapped, the ID of each article may be read.<br>
(10)	The radiation electrode is an electrode pattern<br>
formed, for example, on a circuit substrate in an electronic<br>
device. According to the above configuration, the circuit<br>
substrate provided in the electronic device may be utilized<br>
without any change, and mounting of the high-frequency<br>
device becomes easy.<br>
(11)	The radiation electrode is a metal plate provided<br>
on a rear face of a component, such as a liquid crystal<br>
display panel, in an electronic device. According to the<br>
above configuration, the component provided in the<br>
electronic device may be utilized without any change, and<br>
the size and cost are not increased.<br>
(12)	A resonant conductor that has a resonant frequency<br>
that is equal to an operating frequency of the high-<br>
frequency device or a frequency close to the operating<br>
frequency is provided, wherein the resonant conductor is<br>
coupled to the high-frequency device. According to the<br>
above configuration, a radiation gain at the operating<br>
frequency of an RFID tag increases, and an excellent<br>
characteristic is obtained as an RFID. In addition, because<br>
the resonant frequency of the resonant conductor is not<br>
influenced by components mounted on the printed wiring<br><br>
substrate, design is easy.<br>
(13)	The resonant conductor is arranged substantially<br>
parallel to an edge portion of the radiation electrode, at<br>
which the cutout portion is formed. According to the above<br>
configuration, coupling between the resonant conductor and<br>
the radiation electrode becomes strong and, therefore, a<br>
high gain characteristic may be obtained.<br>
(14)	The resonant conductor has a length that is<br>
substantially equal to a side of the radiation electrode,<br>
which the resonant conductor is located adjacent to.<br>
According to the above configuration, coupling between the<br>
resonant conductor and the radiation electrode becomes<br>
strong and, therefore, a high gain characteristic may be<br>
obtained.<br>
(15)	The resonant conductor is arranged so that portion<br>
of the resonant conductor, located adjacent to a position at<br>
which the high-frequency device is arranged, is<br>
substantially located at the center. According to the above<br>
configuration, coupling between the resonant conductor and<br>
the high-frequency device becomes strong and, therefore, a<br>
high gain characteristic may be obtained.<br>
(16)	A plurality of the high-frequency devices are<br>
provided, and the resonant conductor is coupled to each of<br>
the high-frequency devices. According to the above<br>
configuration, the number of necessary resonant conductors<br><br>
may be reduced, and the occupied area on the printed wiring<br>
substrate may be reduced. Thus, manufacturing cost may be<br>
reduced.<br>
(17)	The resonant conductor is separable from a body<br>
that forms the radiation electrode. According to the above<br>
configuration, in the manufacturing process, a communication<br>
distance with a reader/writer may be kept long, and after<br>
manufacturing, the size of the printed wiring substrate is<br>
not increased. In addition, it is possible to provide<br>
communication as needed by bringing it close to the<br>
reader/writer.<br>
(18)	The resonant conductor is formed in a margin<br>
portion of a printed wiring substrate. According to the<br>
above configuration, cost for manufacturing the printed<br>
wiring substrate may be reduced.<br>
(19)	A casing of a device, on which the wireless IC<br>
device is mounted, or another component mounted on the<br>
device also serves as the resonant conductor. According to<br>
the above configuration, it is possible to obtain a<br>
necessary gain even with a metal case or a mounted component.<br>
(20)	A component for a wireless IC device includes: a<br>
high-frequency device, which is an electromagnetic coupling<br>
module or a wireless IC, formed of a wireless IC and a power<br>
supply circuit substrate that is electrically connected or<br>
electromagnetically coupled to the wireless IC while being<br><br>
coupled to an external circuit; and a substrate on which the<br>
high-frequency device is mounted and which includes at least<br>
two linear electrodes, one ends of which are coupled to the<br>
high-frequency device.<br>
According to the above configuration, if the article<br>
only has a conductor that operates as a radiator, by just<br>
assembling the component for a wireless IC device to that<br>
article, the article may be utilized as an RFID tag attached<br>
article.<br>
(21)	In the linear electrode according to (20), the<br>
other ends of the linear electrodes are electrically<br>
connected to each other to form a loop electrode. According<br>
to the above configuration, the loop shape formed by the<br>
loop electrode is not influenced by assembling, such as<br>
soldering and, therefore, highly accurate design with less<br>
fluctuations in impedance, or the like, may be achieved.<br>
(22)	A wireless IC device includes: the component for a<br>
wireless IC device according to (20); and an article having<br>
a radiation electrode that is electrically connected to the<br>
other ends of the at. least two linear electrodes to form a<br>
loop electrode. According to the above configuration, it is<br>
possible to easily form an RFID tag attached article.<br>
(23)	A wireless IC device includes: the component for a<br>
wireless IC device according to (21); and an article<br>
provided with a conductor that is coupled to the loop<br><br>
electrode and operates as a radiator. According to the<br>
above configuration, it is possible to easily form an RFID<br>
tag attached article. In addition, when the article is an<br>
electronic component, it is possible to reduce variations in<br>
characteristic thereof.<br>
Advantages<br>
According to the invention, the following advantageous<br>
effects are obtained, for example, processes or members for<br>
forming an antenna pattern shown in FIG. 1 on an article are<br>
unnecessary. Thus, there is almost no increase in cost for<br>
providing a wireless IC device for an article.<br>
In addition, because the entire or portion of the<br>
article may be utilized as a radiator, a sufficient<br>
radiation characteristic may be obtained even when it is<br>
attached to a small article.<br>
Furthermore, because the thickness of a portion on a<br>
base material of the article, at which the high-frequency<br>
device is provided, may be reduced, a protrusion of the<br>
high-frequency device portion may be suppressed and,<br>
therefore, an appearance is not influenced.<br>
Moreover, by using the electromagnetic coupling module,<br>
impedance matching between the wireless IC chip and the<br>
radiation electrode may be designed within the power supply<br>
circuit substrate. Thus, it is not necessary to limit the<br>
shape or material of the radiation electrode, and it may be<br><br>
applied to any articles.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
First Embodiment<br>
FIG. 2 is an external perspective view that shows the<br>
configuration of a wireless IC device according to a first<br>
embodiment and the configuration of an article provided with<br>
the wireless IC device. The article 70 is, for example, a<br>
packed snack, such as a packed potato chips. An article<br>
package 60 is a package that is formed so that an aluminum-<br>
deposited laminated film is formed into a bag-like shape.<br>
A cutout portion (portion at which aluminum is not<br>
vapor-deposited) 61 is formed at an edge portion of the<br>
article package 60, and an electromagnetic coupling module 1<br>
is arranged in the cutout portion 61.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view that shows the configuration of a<br>
wireless IC device and shows only a relevant portion of the<br>
article 70 shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 3, a radiation<br>
electrode 8 corresponds to an aluminum-deposited layer of<br><br>
the aluminum-deposited laminated film of the article package<br>
60 shown in FIG. 2. The cutout portion (electrode non-<br>
formation portion) 61 of the radiation electrode 8 forms a<br>
loop electrode 7 inside, and the electromagnetic coupling<br>
module 1 is mounted at the cutout portion 61 so as to be<br>
coupled to the loop electrode 7. The loop electrode 7 is<br>
patterned when aluminum deposition of the aluminum-deposited<br>
laminated film is performed. Alternatively, a conductive<br>
pattern may be formed by printing in a process different<br>
from the process of aluminum deposition.<br>
FIG. 3(B) schematically shows an example of a<br>
distribution of electromagnetic field that is generated in<br>
the radiation electrode 8 when the loop electrode 7 is<br>
applied as a transmission auxiliary radiator. In the<br>
drawing, the broken line represents the loop of a magnetic<br>
field H, and the solid line represents the loop of an<br>
electric field E. The loop electrode 7 is applied as a<br>
magnetic field transmission auxiliary radiator. The<br>
magnetic field H generated by the loop electrode 7<br>
perpendicularly intersects with the radiation electrode 8 to<br>
induce the electric field E. The electric field loop<br>
induces a magnetic field loop, and the chain of that action<br>
extends a distribution of electromagnetic field.<br>
The above example is described using the loop electrode<br>
7 as a transmission auxiliary radiator. When the loop<br><br>
electrode 7 is applied as a reception auxiliary radiator as<br>
well, a similar action may be attained to obtain a high gain.<br>
In this way, when the article includes a conductive<br>
portion having a predetermined area and the conductive<br>
portion acts as a radiator, and when a large number of the<br>
articles are overlapped, chain induction of the electric<br>
field and magnetic field propagates among articles. Thus,<br>
even when a large number of articles are overlapped (if<br>
anything, overlapped), the wireless IC device operates to<br>
attain a high gain. For example, in a state where the<br>
antenna of a reader/writer is brought close to a portion of<br>
a pile of packed potato chips, IDs of all of the pile of<br>
packed potato chips may be read.<br>
Note that the electromagnetic coupling module 1 shown<br>
in FIG. 3 includes a wireless IC chip, which will be<br>
described later, and a power supply circuit substrate that<br>
is connected to the wireless IC chip and that is coupled to<br>
an external circuit (in this example, the loop electrode 7,<br>
and the radiation electrode 8 via the loop electrode 7).<br>
The wireless IC chip and the power supply circuit substrate<br>
may be connected electrically or may be coupled<br>
electromagnetically. When they are coupled<br>
electromagnetically, a capacity is formed between connection<br>
electrodes of them with a dielectric thin film, or the like.<br>
By capacitively coupling the wireless IC chip and the power<br><br>
supply circuit substrate, it is possible to prevent the<br>
wireless IC chip from being broken due to static electricity.<br>
In addition, when the power supply circuit substrate is<br>
used, two electrodes of the power supply circuit substrate<br>
are coupled electromagnetically to both ends of the loop<br>
electrode 7. In addition, the electromagnetic coupling<br>
module 1 may be replaced with a single piece of wireless IC<br>
chip. In this case, two electrodes of the wireless IC chip<br>
may be directly connected to both ends of the loop electrode<br>
7. In any cases, because the loop electrode 7 is separated<br>
from the radiation electrode 8 in terms of direct current,<br>
the wireless IC device advantageously has a resistance<br>
against static electricity.<br>
In addition, the loop electrode 7 may have any shape as<br>
long as the loop electrode 7 is arranged so as to couple<br>
input and output terminals of the electromagnetic coupling<br>
module 1.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
FIG. 4 is an external perspective view that shows the<br>
configuration of a wireless IC device according to a second<br>
embodiment and the configuration of an article provided with<br>
the wireless IC device. The article 71 is, for example, a<br>
packed snack. An article package 60 is a package that is<br>
formed so that an aluminum-deposited laminated film is<br>
formed into a bag-like shape.<br><br>
In the example shown in FIG. 2, the electromagnetic<br>
coupling module is arranged at an edge portion of the<br>
article package, whereas in an example shown in FIG. 4, the<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is provided at an inner<br>
side of the article package 60, away from the edge portion<br>
of the article package 60. The article package 60 is formed<br>
of an aluminum-deposited laminated film. Portion of the<br>
article package 60, at which aluminum is not deposited, is<br>
formed as a non-conductive portion 62. The electromagnetic<br>
coupling module 1 is arranged inside the non-conductive<br>
portion 62 and at an end of the non-conductive portion 62.<br>
FIG. 5 is a view that shows a portion at which the<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 shown in FIG. 4 is mounted.<br>
In FIG. 5, the configuration of the loop electrode 7 and<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is similar to that shown<br>
in FIG. 3 in the first embodiment. The radiation electrode<br>
8 corresponds to the aluminum-deposited layer of the<br>
aluminum-deposited laminated film of the article package 60.<br>
The loop electrode 7 and the electromagnetic coupling module<br>
1 are arranged inside the non-conductive portion 62 so that<br>
the loop electrode 7 is located adjacent to three sides of<br>
the radiation electrode 8.<br>
With the above configuration, the loop electrode 7<br>
operates as a magnetic field transmission auxiliary radiator.<br>
The loop electrode 7 is coupled to the radiation electrode 8<br><br>
and, owing to the action similar to that shown in FIG. 3,<br>
the radiation electrode 8 operates as a radiator of an<br>
antenna.<br>
Note that when the area of the non-conductive portion<br>
62 is set to be equal to the area occupied by the loop<br>
electrode 7 and the electromagnetic coupling module 1 and<br>
then the loop electrode 7 and the electromagnetic coupling<br>
module 1 are arranged inside the non-conductive portion 62,<br>
the magnetic field of the loop electrode 7 is coupled to the<br>
radiation electrode 8 at four sides and, therefore,<br>
electromagnetic field induced by the radiation electrode 8<br>
is cancelled to reduce a gain. Thus, it is important that<br>
the area of the non-conductive portion 62 is sufficiently<br>
larger than the area occupied by the loop electrode 7 and<br>
the electromagnetic coupling module 1, and the loop<br>
electrode 7 is located adjacent to the radiation electrode 8<br>
at one side, two sides, or three sides.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
FIG. 6(B) shows the configuration of a main portion of<br>
a wireless IC device according to a third embodiment. FIG.<br>
6(A) is an external view of an article provided with the<br>
wireless IC device. In FIG. 6(A), the article 72 is such<br>
that a main portion 6 of the wireless IC device is provided<br>
on the metal plane body 63. The metal plane body 63 is a<br>
plate-like or sheet-like article that includes a metal layer<br><br>
inside or a metal plate itself.<br>
The main portion 6 of the wireless IC device has a so-<br>
called tuck index shape as a whole as shown in FIG. 6(B) and<br>
has an adhesive layer on the inner face of an insulative<br>
sheet 64. The loop electrode 7 and the electromagnetic<br>
coupling module 1 are sandwiched by the insulative sheet 64.<br>
The configuration of the loop electrode 7 and<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is similar to that shown<br>
in FIG. 3.<br>
Then, the loop electrode 7 is attached so as to be<br>
located adjacent to an edge of the metal plane body 63 shown<br>
in FIG. 6A, that is, so as to just adhere a tuck index to<br>
the edge.<br>
Even when no cutout is provided at an edge portion of<br>
the conductive portion as described above, by bringing the<br>
loop electrode 7 of the main portion 6 of the wireless IC<br>
device close to the edge portion of the metal plane body 63,<br>
the loop electrode 7 and the metal plane body 63 (conductive<br>
portion that operates as a radiator) are coupled to each<br>
other. Thus, the metal plane body 63 operates as a radiator<br>
of an antenna.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
A wireless IC device according to a fourth embodiment<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. The<br>
wireless IC device according to the fourth embodiment is<br><br>
applied to a recording medium having a metal film, such as a<br>
DVD.<br>
FIG. 7 is a plan view of a DVD disk. FIG. 8(A) is a<br>
center cross-sectional view that is taken along the line<br>
passing the main portion 6 of the wireless IC device, and<br>
FIG. 8(B) is a partially enlarged plan view of the main<br>
portion 6 of the wireless IC device. However, the cross-<br>
sectional view of FIG. 8(A) is exaggerated in size in the<br>
thickness direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8(A), the DVD disc 73 is<br>
formed by adhering two disc-shaped discs, one of the disc<br>
has a metal film 65 formed thereon, and the main portion 6<br>
of the wireless IC device is provided at portion of the<br>
inner peripheral edge of the metal film 65.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8(B), a C-shaped cutout portion 66 is<br>
formed at portion of the inner peripheral edge of the metal<br>
film 65. The cutout portion 66 is not a cutout of the disc<br>
but a cutout portion as a pattern of the metal film. The<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is arranged so that two<br>
terminals of the electromagnetic coupling module 1, formed<br>
by the C-shaped cutout portion, face two protruding ends<br>
facing each other. The inner peripheral end (portion<br>
indicated by the arrow in the drawing) of the C-shaped<br>
cutout portion is operated as a loop electrode.<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br><br>
FIG. 9 is a view that shows the configuration of two<br>
wireless IC devices according to a fifth embodiment. The<br>
fifth embodiment provides a matching circuit between a<br>
mounding portion of a high-frequency device and a loop<br>
electrode. The matching circuit establishes direct<br>
electrical connection between the high-frequency device and<br>
the loop electrode.<br>
In FIG. 9(A), the metal film 65 is formed into a sheet<br>
material or a plate material, and operates as a radiator.<br>
By forming a cutout portion 66 at portion of the metal film<br>
65, the portion extending along the inner peripheral edge of<br>
the cutout portion 66 operates as a loop electrode.<br>
The matching circuit 67 formed of a meander electrode<br>
and metal film portions 65a and 65b, which are mounting<br>
portions for the high-frequency device (electromagnetic<br>
coupling module or wireless IC chip), are formed inside the<br>
cutout portion 66.<br>
By providing the matching circuit 67 in this way, the<br>
wireless IC chip may be directly mounted at the metal film<br>
portions 65a and 65b. Note that when the wireless IC chip<br>
is directly mounted on the loop electrode, the loop<br>
electrode including the matching circuit 67 substantially<br>
determines operating frequency of the wireless IC device.<br>
In FIG. 9(B), the radiation electrode 8 has the non-<br>
conductive portion 62 formed therein, and the loop electrode<br><br>
7, matching circuit 67 and electromagnetic coupling module 1<br>
are arranged inside the non-conductive portion 62 so that<br>
the loop electrode 7 is located adjacent to three sides of<br>
the radiation electrode 8. The configuration of the<br>
matching circuit 67 and mounting portion of the<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is similar to the example<br>
of FIG. 9(A).<br>
With the above configuration, the loop electrode 7<br>
operates as a magnetic field radiator. The loop electrode 7<br>
is coupled to the radiation electrode 8 and, owing to the<br>
action similar to that shown in FIG. 3, the radiation<br>
electrode 8 operates as a radiator.<br>
Note that the metal film 65 of FIG. 9(A) or the<br>
radiation electrode 8 of FIG. 9(B) may be, for example, a<br>
solid electrode that is formed on the circuit substrate<br>
inside a cellular phone terminal.<br>
Sixth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 10 is an external perspective view of an<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 used for a wireless IC<br>
device according to a sixth embodiment. The electromagnetic<br>
coupling module 1 may be applied to the wireless IC devices<br>
in the other embodiments. The electromagnetic coupling<br>
module 1 is formed of a wireless IC chip 5 and a power<br>
supply circuit substrate 4. The power supply circuit<br>
substrate 4 matches an impedance between the metal film 65,<br><br>
which operates as a radiator, and the wireless IC chip 5,<br>
and also operates as a resonant circuit.<br>
FIG. 11 is an exploded view that shows the<br>
configuration of the inside of the power supply circuit<br>
substrate 4. The power supply circuit substrate 4 is formed<br>
of a multilayer substrate formed by laminating a plurality<br>
of dielectric layers in which electrode patterns are<br>
respectively formed. Wireless IC chip mounting lands 35a to<br>
35d are formed on the uppermost dielectric layer 41A. A<br>
capacitor electrode 51 that is electrically connected to the<br>
wireless IC chip mounting land 35b is formed on the<br>
dielectric layer 41B. A capacitor electrode 53 is formed on<br>
the dielectric layer 41C and forms a capacitor CI with the<br>
capacitor electrode 51. Inductor electrodes 45a and 45b are<br>
formed on each of the dielectric layers 41D to 41H. The<br>
inductor electrodes 45a and 45b formed over these plurality<br>
of layers form a spiral shape as a whole, and constitute<br>
inductors LI and L2 that are strongly inductively coupled to<br>
each other. In addition, a capacitor electrode 54 is formed<br>
on the dielectric layer 41F and is electrically connected to<br>
the inductor LI. The capacitor electrode 54 is placed<br>
between the two capacitor electrodes 53 and 55 to form a<br>
capacitor. In addition, a capacitor electrode 55 is formed<br>
on the dielectric layer 41H and is electrically connected to<br>
the capacitor electrode 53. Via holes 42a to 42i are formed<br><br>
to electrically connect between the electrodes of the<br>
dielectric layers.<br>
The capacitor electrode 55 faces an end 65b of the<br>
metal film, which is formed at the cutout portion of the<br>
metal film 65 shown in FIG. 8. A capacitor between the end<br>
65b and the capacitor electrode 55. In addition, the<br>
inductor electrodes 45a and 45b are electromagnetically<br>
coupled to the metal film portion 65a facing thereto.<br>
FIG. 12 is an equivalent circuit diagram that includes<br>
the power supply circuit substrate and the cutout portion of<br>
the metal film shown in FIG. 11. In FIG. 12, the capacitor<br>
CI is a capacitor generated between the capacitor electrodes<br>
51 and 53 shown in FIG. 11, the capacitor C2 is a capacitor<br>
generated between the capacitor electrode 54 and the<br>
capacitor electrodes 53 and 55 shown in FIG. 11, and the<br>
inductors LI and L2 are formed by the inductor electrodes<br>
45a and 45b shown in FIG. 11. The metal film 65 shov/n in<br>
FIG. 12 is a loop that extends along the inner peripheral<br>
edge of the cutout portion 66 shown in FIG. 8. The<br>
capacitor electrode 55 is capacitively coupled to one end<br>
65b, and the other end 65a is electromagnetically coupled to<br>
the inductors LI and L2. Thus, the loop that extends along<br>
the inner peripheral edge of the cutout portion 66 operates<br>
as a loop electrode.<br>
Note that in the fourth embodiment, the loop that<br><br>
extends along the inner peripheral end of the cutout portion<br>
of the metal film is operated as the loop electrode; instead,<br>
as shown in FIG. 3, and the like, it is applicable that a<br>
loop electrode is formed inside the cutout portion, and the<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 that includes the wireless<br>
IC chip 5 and the power supply circuit substrate 4 are<br>
mounted to the loop electrode. In this case, the loop<br>
electrode and the metal film 65 are coupled, and the metal<br>
film 65 operates as a radiator.<br>
In the power supply circuit substrate 4, a resonant<br>
frequency is determined in a resonant circuit formed of the<br>
inductance elements LI and L2 and its stray capacitance,<br>
The frequency of a signal radiated from the radiation<br>
electrode is substantially determined on the basis of a<br>
self-resonant frequency of the resonant circuit.<br>
The electromagnetic coupling module 1, which is formed<br>
so that the wireless IC chip 5 is mounted on the power<br>
supply circuit substrate 4, receives a high-frequency signal<br>
(for example, UHF frequency band) radiated from a<br>
reader/writer (not shown) through the radiation electrode,<br>
resonates the resonant circuit in the power supply circuit<br>
substrate 4 and then supplies only a reception signal of a<br>
predetermined frequency band to the wireless IC chip 5. On<br>
the other hand, the electromagnetic coupling module 1<br>
extracts a predetermined amount of energy from the reception<br><br>
signal, matches information stored in the wireless IC chip 5<br>
with a predetermined frequency in the resonant circuit using<br>
the extracted energy as a driving source, and then transmits<br>
the information to the radiation electrode. The information<br>
is further transmitted from the radiation electrode to the<br>
reader/writer.<br>
In this way, by providing the resonant circuit in the<br>
power supply circuit substrate, selectivity of frequency<br>
increases. Thus, the operating frequency of the wireless IC<br>
device may be mostly determined using the self-resonant<br>
frequency. In accordance with the above, it is possible to<br>
transfer (exchange) energy of a signal of a frequency used<br>
in an RFID system with high efficiency. In addition, it is<br>
possible to set an optimum resonant frequency in<br>
consideration of the shape and size of a radiator. This may<br>
improve the radiation characteristic of the wireless IC<br>
device.<br>
Note that the wireless IC chip and the mounting lands<br>
of the power supply circuit substrate may be electrically<br>
connected or may be capacitively coupled through insulation.<br>
In addition, by providing the matching circuit in the<br>
power supply circuit substrate, it is possible to transfer<br>
(exchange) energy of a signal of a frequency used in an RFID<br>
system with high efficiency.<br>
Seventh Embodiment<br><br>
FIG. 13 is a perspective view that shows the<br>
configuration of a main portion of a wireless IC device<br>
according to a fifth embodiment. FIG. 14 is an enlarged<br>
partially cross-sectional view of FIG. 13.<br>
In FIG. 13, a base material 10 is the base material of<br>
an article for which the wireless IC device is provided and<br>
is, for example, an aluminum-deposited laminated film. On<br>
the aluminum-deposited layer of the base material 10, a loop<br>
electrode 30 that is opened in the cutout portion described<br>
in the first embodiment or in a predetermined portion of the<br>
non-conductive portion described in the second embodiment.<br>
An inductor electrode 20 and a capacitor electrode 25 are<br>
formed above the open two ends 30a and 30b via an insulating<br>
layer. The inductor electrode 20 has a spiral shape and, as<br>
will be described later, the inside end is connected to the<br>
capacitor electrode 25.<br>
The wireless IC chip 5 is mounted at the ends of the<br>
inductor electrode 20 and capacitor electrode 25, as shown<br>
in the enlarged view in the drawing. That is, the wireless<br>
IC chip mounting land 35a is formed at the end of the<br>
inductor electrode 20 and the wireless IC chip mounting land<br>
35b is formed at the end of the capacitor electrode 25, and,<br>
furthermore, the mounting lands 35c and 35d are formed.<br>
Then, the wireless IC chip 5 is mounted.<br>
FIG. 14 is a cross-sectional view that is taken along<br><br>
the line II-II in FIG. 13. As shown in FIG. 14, the<br>
inductor electrode 20 faces the end 30a of the loop<br>
electrode. A wire 21 connects the inside end of the<br>
inductor electrode 20 shown in FIG. 13 with the capacitor<br>
electrode 25.<br>
In this way, capacitors and inductors for matching<br>
impedance and adjusting resonant frequency may be formed on<br>
the side of the base material 10 of an article, and the<br>
wireless IC chip 5 may be directly mounted.<br>
Eighth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 15 is an exploded perspective view of a power<br>
supply circuit substrate 40 of a wireless IC device<br>
according to a sixth embodiment. In addition, FIG. 16 is an<br>
equivalent circuit diagram thereof.<br>
The power supply circuit substrate 40 is formed of a<br>
multilayer substrate formed by laminating a plurality of<br>
dielectric layers in which electrode patterns are<br>
respectively formed. Wireless IC chip mounting lands 35a to<br>
35d are formed on the uppermost dielectric layer 41A. A<br>
capacitor electrode 51 that is electrically connected to the<br>
wireless IC chip mounting land 35b is formed on the<br>
dielectric layer 41B. A capacitor electrode 53 is formed on<br>
the dielectric layer 41C and forms a capacitor CI with the<br>
capacitor electrode 51. Inductor electrodes 45a and 45b are<br>
formed on each of the dielectric layers 41D to 41H. The<br><br>
inductor electrodes 45a and 45b formed over these plurality<br>
of layers constitute, as a whole, an inductor LI that has a<br>
spiral shape. In addition, a capacitor electrode 54 is<br>
formed on the dielectric layer 41F and is electrically<br>
connected to the inductor LI. The capacitor electrode 54 is<br>
placed between the two capacitor electrodes 53 and 55 (or<br>
56) to form a capacitor. In addition, a capacitor electrode<br>
55 is formed on the dielectric layer 41H and is electrically<br>
connected to the capacitor electrode 53.<br>
Capacitor electrodes 56 and 57 are formed on a<br>
dielectric layer 411. The capacitor electrode 56 is<br>
electrically connected to the capacitor electrodes 53 and 55.<br>
In addition, the capacitor electrode 57 is<br>
electromagnetically coupled to the inductor electrodes 45a<br>
and 4 5b.<br>
Inductor electrodes 4 6 and 47 are formed on each of<br>
dielectric layers 41J to 41N. The inductor electrodes 46<br>
and 47 form a loop electrode L2 that is wound multiple times.<br>
Via holes 42a to 42m are formed to electrically connect<br>
between the electrodes of the dielectric layers.<br>
That is, the power supply circuit substrate 40 is just<br>
formed so that the loop electrode is included in the power<br>
supply circuit substrate 4 shown in FIG. 11. Thus, by<br>
installing the electromagnetic coupling module, which is<br>
formed by mounting the wireless IC chip on the power supply<br><br>
circuit substrate 40, to an article, the wireless IC device<br>
may be formed, and it is not necessary to form a loop<br>
electrode on the article side.<br>
In FIG. 16, the capacitor CI is a capacitor generated<br>
between the capacitor electrodes 51 and 53 shown in FIG. 15,<br>
the capacitor C2 is a capacitor generated between the<br>
capacitor electrode 54 and the capacitor electrodes 53 and<br>
55 shown in FIG. 15, the inductors L1a and L1b are<br>
respectively formed by the inductor electrodes 45a and 45b<br>
shown in FIG. 15, and the inductor L2 is formed by the<br>
inductor electrodes 46 and 47 shown in FIG. 15.<br>
Ninth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 17 are plan views of an electromagnetic coupling<br>
module used for a wireless IC device according to a seventh<br>
embodiment. In the example of FIG. 17(A), a loop electrode<br>
12 and wireless IC chip mounting lands are formed on the<br>
substrate 11 by an electrode pattern, and the wireless IC<br>
chip 5 is mounted.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 15, the capacitors and<br>
inductors for matching impedance and adjusting resonant<br>
frequency are formed on the power supply circuit substrate<br>
together with the loop electrode, whereas in the example<br>
shown in FIG. 17, the loop electrode and the wireless IC<br>
chip basically integrated.<br>
In the example of FIG. 17(B), spiral electrode patterns<br><br>
are respectively formed on the top and bottom faces of the<br>
substrate 11, capacitor electrode that places the substrate<br>
11 in between are arranged at the center of each spiral<br>
electrode pattern, and then the line on the top face and the<br>
line on the bottom face are connected via the capacitors.<br>
That is, the line length and inductance are gained within a<br>
limited area by utilizing both faces of the substrate 11 to<br>
thereby form the loop electrode 12.<br>
Two electromagnetic coupling modules 2 and 3 shown in<br>
FIG. 17 each are arranged adjacent to a metal film of an<br>
article, which operates as a radiator, or a metal plate so<br>
that the radiation electrode is capacitively coupled to the<br>
loop electrode 12. By so doing, without forming any<br>
specific circuit on the article side, as in the case of the<br>
first and second embodiments, it is possible to utilize the<br>
metal film of the article or the metal plate as a radiator<br>
of an antenna.<br>
Tenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 18 are views that show the configuration of a<br>
wireless IC device according to a tenth embodiment. In the<br>
first to ninth embodiments, the article package 60, the<br>
metal plane body 63, the metal film 65, and the like, in<br>
which a conductive plane extends in a planar manner, are<br>
operated as a radiator, whereas in the tenth embodiment, a<br>
resonant conductor that is insulated from a planar<br><br>
conductive plane and that operates as a resonator is<br>
provided.<br>
FIG. 18(A) is a plan view of a conductive pattern on a<br>
printed wiring substrate when an RFID tag is formed on the<br>
printed wiring substrate. In addition, FIG. 18(B) is a plan<br>
view of a wireless IC device that operates as an RFID tag,<br>
which is formed so that the electromagnetic coupling module<br>
1 formed of a wireless IC chip and a power supply circuit<br>
substrate is mounted on the printed wiring substrate.<br>
A metal film 65, which is used as a ground electrode of<br>
another circuit, is formed on the upper face of the printed<br>
wiring substrate 80. The metal film 65 partially forms a<br>
cutout portion (metal film non-formation portion) 66, and<br>
the metal film portions 65a and 65b, which form a mounting<br>
portion for a high-frequency device (electromagnetic<br>
coupling module or wireless IC chip), are formed inside the<br>
cutout portion 66.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18(B), by mounting the high-frequency<br>
device 1 on the metal film portions 65a and 65b, the portion<br>
that extends along the inner peripheral edge of the cutout<br>
portion 66 operates as a loop electrode. The mounting area<br>
of the high-frequency device 1 forms a main portion 6 of the<br>
wireless IC device.<br>
A resonant conductor 68 that is coupled to the high-<br>
frequency device 1 is formed on the upper face of the<br><br>
printed wiring substrate 80. The resonant conductor 68 has<br>
determined dimensions (particularly, length) so that the<br>
resonant frequency is a frequency used in an RFID tag or a<br>
frequency therearound. For example, when a glass epoxy<br>
substrate is used and the operating frequency is a UHF band,<br>
the length of the resonant conductor 68 just needs to be<br>
several tens centimeters so as to operate as a both-end-open<br>
half-wavelength resonator.<br>
The resonant conductor 68 is arranged so that the<br>
center is located adjacent to the loop electrode of the main<br>
portion 6 of the wireless IC device, so as to be coupled to<br>
the high-frequency device 1. In addition, in this example,<br>
it is arranged along one side of the metal film 65 in an<br>
insulated manner.<br>
In FIG. 18(B), the arrow J shown in the resonant<br>
conductor 68 typically represents an electric current path,<br>
the arrow EF typically represents an electric field<br>
distribution, and the arrow MF typically represents a<br>
magnetic field distribution. In this way, the magnitude of<br>
an electric current that flows through the resonant<br>
conductor 68 becomes maximum around the center. Thus, the<br>
magnetic field generated at the resonant conductor 68<br>
becomes maximum around the center, and the resonant<br>
conductor 68 is strongly magnetically coupled to the portion<br>
of the loop electrode, extending along the inner peripheral<br><br>
edge of the cutout portion 66.<br>
When the resonant conductor 68 is resonating around the<br>
operating frequency of the RFID tag, an electric current<br>
that flows through the resonant conductor 68 and a voltage<br>
generated across both ends of the resonant conductor 68<br>
increases. Owing to the magnetic field and electric field<br>
generated by these electric current and voltage as well, the<br>
resonant conductor 68 is coupled to the metal film 65.<br>
The peak of a voltage of a standing wave generated at<br>
the resonant conductor 68 is formed at an end of the<br>
resonant conductor 68. In this example, because the length<br>
of the resonant conductor 68 is substantially equal to one<br>
end of the metal film 65 that operates as a radiator, the<br>
resonant conductor 68 is strongly coupled to the metal film<br>
65. Thus, a high gain is obtained. Through the actions<br>
described above, it is possible to obtain an excellent<br>
characteristic as an RFID tag.<br>
When no resonant conductor 68 is present, resonance<br>
just needs to be performed in the metal film 65 at the<br>
operating frequency of an RFID tag; however, due to<br>
restriction on size of the metal film 65 and depending on<br>
components mounted on the printed wiring substrate, resonant<br>
frequency shifts. According to the embodiment, because the<br>
metal film 65 is separated from the resonant conductor 68,<br>
the resonant conductor 68 may be designed as a single unit,<br><br>
and a shift in resonant frequency due to mounted components<br>
also does not occur.<br>
Note that in the tenth embodiment, only the metal film,<br>
as a ground electrode, and the resonant conductor are<br>
described as an electrode pattern formed on the printed<br>
wiring substrate; however, an electrode pattern is<br>
appropriately determined on the basis of a circuit to be<br>
formed and an electronic component to be mounted. This also<br>
applies to other embodiments described below.<br>
When an RFID tag is formed on the above constructed<br>
printed wiring substrate, and information such as<br>
manufacturing process history is written to the RFID tag, it<br>
is possible to manage, for example, a process of mounting<br>
components to a printed wiring substrate. For example, when<br>
malfunction of an electronic component is detected in lot<br>
unit, it is possible to take measures only by withdrawing a<br>
small number of electronic devices that have the electronic<br>
component included in that lot. In addition, it has an<br>
advantageous effect such that post-sales support and<br>
maintenance at the time when the product is in operation in<br>
the market may be quickly performed, and a process for<br>
recycling as a resource after disposal will be simple.<br>
In addition, after process management is ended, portion<br>
of the printed wiring substrate, forming the resonant<br>
conductor 68, may be torn off. By so doing, the size of the<br><br>
printed wiring substrate may be small, and it is possible to<br>
reduce the size of a product without losing the function of<br>
an RFID tag. Because the resonant conductor 68 is present<br>
at the time of process management, data may be read even<br>
when the output level of a reader/writer is low. By<br>
lowering the output of an RF signal, it is possible to<br>
suppress malfunction of a control device, a characteristic<br>
measurement device, and the like. Furthermore, after the<br>
resonant conductor 68 is torn off, the metal film 65 also<br>
operates as a radiator. Thus, communication is still<br>
possible although a communicable distance with a<br>
reader/writer is reduced.<br>
When the printed wiring substrate is conveyed in a<br>
general manufacturing process, rails may be arranged on both<br>
sides of the printed wiring substrate and then the printed<br>
wiring substrate may be conveyed on the rails. In order to<br>
prevent breakage of the portions that contact the rails, the<br>
printed wiring substrate has a margin portion that will be<br>
finally torn off. If the resonant conductor 68 is formed at<br>
the margin portion, wasted space of the printed wiring<br>
substrate is removed.<br>
Note that the metal film 65, which is a ground<br>
electrode, may be formed in a plurality of layers of the<br>
printed wiring substrate. In this case, the region of the<br>
cutout portion 66 in each layer is formed as a metal film<br><br>
non-formation portion so that a magnetic flux passes<br>
therethrough.<br>
According to the embodiment, a radiation gain at the<br>
operating frequency of an RFID tag increases, and an<br>
excellent characteristic of an RFID is obtained. In<br>
addition, because the resonant frequency of the resonant<br>
conductor is not influenced by components mounted on the<br>
printed wiring substrate, design is easy.<br>
Eleventh Embodiment<br>
FIG. 19 to FIG. 21 are views that show some<br>
configurations of a wireless IC device according to an<br>
eleventh embodiment. Any drawings are plan views of a<br>
wireless IC device such that an RFID tag is formed on a<br>
printed wiring substrate.<br>
In the examples of FIGs. 19(A) and (B), the metal film<br>
65, which is used as a ground electrode for another circuit,<br>
is formed on the upper face of the printed wiring substrate<br>
80. The metal film 65 partially forms a cutout portion<br>
(metal film non-formation portion), and a high-frequency<br>
device (electromagnetic coupling module or wireless IC chip)<br>
is mounted inside the cutout portion, so that the main<br>
portion 6 of the wireless IC device similar to that shown in<br>
FIG. 18 is formed.<br>
The configuration differs from the configuration shown<br>
in FIG. 18 in that the length of the resonant conductor 68<br><br>
is smaller than one side of the metal film 65 as a radiator.<br>
In the example of FIG. 19(A), the resonant conductor 68 is<br>
formed along one side of the metal film 65. In the example<br>
of FIG. 19(B), the resonant conductor 68 is formed at a<br>
position that is separated from an area in which the metal<br>
film 65 is formed.<br>
Even with the above relationship, when the printed<br>
wiring substrate 80 and the metal film 65 are large in area<br>
(long) and a resonance frequency owing to the metal film 65<br>
is low, the resonant frequency of the resonant conductor 68<br>
may be set to around the operating frequency of an RFID.<br>
Thus, a high gain is obtained.<br>
In the example of FIG. 20, the resonant conductor 68 is<br>
formed in a meander line shape and the entire of the<br>
resonant conductor 68 is arranged along one side of the<br>
metal film 65.<br>
According to the above configuration, because the<br>
resonator length may be increased even when the profile of<br>
the resonant conductor 68 is short, a high gain may be<br>
obtained when it is resonated at a relatively low frequency.<br>
In the example of FIG. 21, the resonant conductor 68 is<br>
longer than one side of the metal film 65 that is operated<br>
as a radiator. In addition, a main portion 6 of the<br>
wireless IC device is formed at a position shifted from the<br>
center of one side of the metal film 65 that is operated as<br><br>
a radiator. In this case as well, as shown in FIGs. 21(A)<br>
and (B), the center of the resonant conductor 68 just needs<br>
to be arranged adjacent to the loop electrode of the main<br>
portion 6 of the wireless IC device.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 21(A), a metal film 69 for<br>
forming another ground electrode or another circuit is<br>
formed in a margin at a position adjacent to the metal film<br>
65. In addition, in the example of FIG. 21(B), the resonant<br>
conductor 68 is formed along two sides of the metal film 65.<br>
In this way, even when the pattern of the metal film 65<br>
that operates as a radiator is small, a high gain is<br>
obtained by providing the resonant conductor 68 having a<br>
length that gives a necessary resonant frequency.<br>
Twelfth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 22 is a view that shows the configuration of a<br>
wireless IC device according to a twelfth embodiment. In<br>
FIG. 22, the main portion 6 of the wireless IC device<br>
similar to that shown in FIG. 18 is formed in each of two<br>
metal films 65A and 65B on the upper face of a printed<br>
wiring substrate 80. Then, a resonant conductor 68 is<br>
formed so as to be coupled to both high-frequency devices<br>
provided at the main portions 6 of the two wireless IC<br>
devices. That is, one resonant conductor 68 is shared by<br>
two high-frequency devices.<br>
For example, the printed wiring substrate 80 may form<br><br>
RFID tags having different frequency bands (for example,<br>
even in the same UHF band, a frequency of standards in<br>
accordance with a destination) by being finally torn off<br>
into the side at which a metal film 65A is formed and the<br>
side at which a metal film 65B is formed.<br>
When the resonant conductor 68 is longer than one side<br>
of the metal film 65 that operates as a radiator, the<br>
resonant conductor 68 may be easily shared as a resonator<br>
for a plurality of high-frequency devices as described above.<br>
In addition, even when shared frequencies are different, the<br>
resonant frequency just needs to be set to a frequency<br>
approximate to the frequencies used in the plurality of RFID<br>
tags.<br>
When the resonant conductor 68 is used only in the<br>
manufacturing process, it will be separated from the printed<br>
wiring substrate 80 later. Thus, the mother printed wiring<br>
substrate does not have a wasted space of an electrode<br>
pattern, so that it is possible to avoid an increase in cost<br>
due to formation of the resonant conductor 68.<br>
Thirteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 23 is a view that shows some configurations of a<br>
wireless IC device according to a thirteenth embodiment.<br>
Any drawings are plan views of a wireless IC device such<br>
that an RFID tag is formed on a printed wiring substrate.<br>
In the examples of FIGs. 23(A) and (B), the metal film<br><br>
65, which is used as a ground electrode for another circuit,<br>
is formed on the upper face of the printed wiring substrate<br>
80. A main portion 6 of the wireless IC device similar to<br>
that shown in FIG. 18 is formed at portion of the metal film<br>
65.<br>
The configuration differs from the configuration shown<br>
in FIG. 18 in that only a portion around the center of the<br>
resonant conductor 68 is arranged adjacent to the loop<br>
electrode of the main portion 6 of the wireless IC device.<br>
Depending on the relationship between the length of one side<br>
of the metal film 65 that operates as a radiator and the<br>
length of the resonant conductor 68, portions near both ends<br>
of the resonant conductor 68 may be formed in a shape so as<br>
to be located away from the metal film 65 as described above.<br>
Fourteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 24 is a plan view that shows the configuration of<br>
a wireless IC device according to a fourteenth embodiment.<br>
The configuration differs from the configuration shown in<br>
FIG. 18 in that resonant conductors 68A and 68B are<br>
respectively arranged along two sides of the metal film 65<br>
as a radiator.<br>
One resonant conductor 68A, as in the case shown in FIG.<br>
18, is strongly coupled to a high-frequency device provided<br>
at the main portion 6 of the wireless IC device. The other<br>
resonant conductor 68B is located adjacently along the metal<br><br>
film 65. Thus, the other resonant conductor 68B is coupled<br>
to the high-frequency device via an electromagnetic field<br>
distributed in the metal film 65. Both the resonant<br>
conductors 68A and 68B operate as a both-end-open half-<br>
wavelength resonator.<br>
The plurality of resonant conductors 68 are not limited<br>
to that they are arranged along two opposite sides of the<br>
metal film 65; they may be arranged along sides of the metal<br>
film 65, which are perpendicular to each other.<br>
Fifteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 25 is a plan view that shows the configuration of<br>
a wireless IC device according to a fifteenth embodiment.<br>
In the tenth to fourteenth embodiments, the resonant<br>
conductor is formed on the printed wiring substrate, whereas<br>
in the fifteenth embodiment, a metal case of a device, on<br>
which the wireless IC device is mounted, or a mounting<br>
destination component 81, such as a mounting component, also<br>
serves as the resonant conductor.<br>
With the above configuration, the metal case of the<br>
device, on which the wireless IC device is mounted, the<br>
mounting component, or the like, operates as a resonator.<br>
Thus, it is not necessary to form a resonant conductor on<br>
the printed wiring substrate. This can reduce the size of<br>
the printed wiring substrate 80 and, hence, the cost may be<br>
reduced.<br><br>
Sixteenth Embodiment<br>
In the sixteenth embodiment, a resonant conductor is<br>
fixed, and at the time when a printed wiring substrate is<br>
conveyed along a process line, the printed wiring substrate<br>
communicates with a reader/writer.<br>
FIG. 26 is a plan view that shows the configuration of<br>
a wireless IC device according to the sixteenth embodiment.<br>
In FIG. 26, a process line installed conductor 82 is<br>
arranged along the process line along which the printed<br>
wiring substrate 65 is conveyed. The reader/writer is<br>
arranged at a position relatively close to the process line<br>
installed conductor 82 (but not necessarily adjacent<br>
position).<br>
A main portion 6 of a wireless IC device similar to<br>
that shown in FIG. 18 is formed on the metal film 65 of the<br>
printed wiring substrate 80.<br>
When the printed wiring substrate 80 is conveyed along<br>
the process line and the main portion 6 of the wireless IC<br>
device is located adjacent to the process line installed<br>
conductor 82, the process line installed conductor 82<br>
operates as a resonator that resonates at the frequency of<br>
an RFID tag. Thus, it is possible to communicate with the<br>
reader/writer with a high gain in that state.<br>
According to the above configuration and communication<br>
method, because no resonant conductor is required on the<br><br>
printed wiring substrate, the area of a wirable portion<br>
increases. In addition, because it operates as an RFID tag<br>
only when the printed wiring substrate 80 is located close<br>
to the process line installed conductor 82, it is possible<br>
to communicate only with an RFID tag placed at a specific<br>
position. That is, it is possible to selectively<br>
communicate only with a desired RFID tag without<br>
communicating with an unintended ambient RFID tag.<br>
Seventeenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 27(A) is a perspective view of a cellular phone<br>
terminal provided with a wireless IC device, and FIG. 27(B)<br>
is a cross-sectional view of a main portion of an internal<br>
circuit substrate. The power supply circuit substrate 4, on<br>
which the wireless IC chip 5 is mounted, is installed on the<br>
circuit substrate 15 inside a cellular phone terminal,<br>
together with electronic components 17 and 18. An electrode<br>
pattern 16 that spreads in a predetermined area is formed on<br>
the upper face of the circuit substrate 15. The electrode<br>
pattern 16 is coupled to the wireless IC chip 5 via the<br>
power supply circuit substrate 4 to operate as a radiator.<br>
In addition, as another example, a wireless IC device<br>
may be formed at a metal panel provided at the rear face of<br>
an internal component (for example, liquid crystal panel) of<br>
the cellular phone terminal shown in FIG. 27(A). That is,<br>
the metal panel may be operated as a radiator of an antenna<br><br>
by applying the wireless IC device shown in the first to<br>
seventh embodiments.<br>
Note that it may be similarly applied to any articles<br>
having a conductive portion with a predetermined area, other<br>
than the above described embodiments. For example, it may<br>
also be applied to a medicine or snack packed with a<br>
composite film including aluminum foil, such as a press<br>
through package (PTP) package.<br>
Eighteenth Embodiment<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 9(A), the metal film 65<br>
that operates as a radiator is formed in a sheet material or<br>
a plate material, and the metal film 65 partially forms the<br>
cutout portion 66, so that the portion extending along the<br>
inner peripheral edge of the cutout, portion 66 is operated<br>
as the loop electrode. When the above configuration is<br>
applied to the printed wiring substrate, a characteristic as<br>
an RFID tag fluctuates depending on a circuit formed on the<br>
printed wiring substrate. Thus, the degree of difficulty in<br>
designing of the printed wiring substrate increases. An<br>
eighteenth embodiment eliminates the above problem.<br>
FIG. 28 is a plan view that shows the configuration of<br>
a component for a wireless IC device according to the<br>
eighteenth embodiment. A mounting portion, on which an<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is mounted, a matching<br>
circuit 67, and a loop electrode 7, which is a liner<br><br>
electrode, are formed on a printed wiring substrate 13, such<br>
as a glass epoxy substrate. The ends of the loop electrode<br>
7 are extended to an end of one side of the printed wiring<br>
substrate 13 as soldering electrode portions indicated by A.<br>
The electromagnetic coupling module 1 is mounted on the<br>
printed wiring substrate 13 to form a component 111 for a<br>
wireless IC device.<br>
FIG. 29 is a plan view that shows a wireless IC device<br>
that uses the component for a wireless IC device according<br>
to the eighteenth embodiment. As shown in FIG. 29, the<br>
component 111 for a wireless IC device is soldered to a<br>
position at which the loop electrode of the printed wiring<br>
substrate 80 will be formed. When a resist film is coated<br>
on the electrodes of the printed wiring substrate 80, the<br>
resist film is peeled off with a router, or the like, to be<br>
ready for soldering. In this state, characteristics, such<br>
as a reading distance as an RFID tag, and an influence of<br>
ambient wires, a casing, or the like, when assembled to a<br>
device are checked.<br>
When an optimum position is determined on the basis of<br>
the result of checking of the characteristics, and the like,<br>
as shown in FIG. 30, the matching circuit 67 and a mounting<br>
portion for the electromagnetic coupling module 1 are formed<br>
at a position close to a position, at which the component<br>
111 for a wireless IC device is assembled, within a ground<br><br>
electrode formation area on the printed wiring substrate 80,<br>
and then the electromagnetic coupling module 1 is mounted.<br>
By so doing, the main portion 6 of the wireless IC device is<br>
formed on the printed wiring substrate 80.<br>
Nineteenth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 31 are plan views that show the configuration of a<br>
component for a wireless IC device according to a nineteenth<br>
embodiment and the configuration of a wireless IC device<br>
provided with that component.<br>
In this example, as shown in FIG. 31(A), the printed<br>
wiring substrate 80 has a cutout portion C formed at a<br>
position at which the component 111 for a wireless IC device<br>
is assembled, and then as shown in FIG. 31(B), the component<br>
111 for a wireless IC device is assembled to the position<br>
through soldering. Soldering should be performed over the<br>
entire portions at which the electrodes contact.<br>
With the above configuration, the state in which the<br>
component 111 for a wireless IC device is assembled is<br>
nearer to the final shape than that in the example shown in<br>
FIG. 29. Thus, further accurate design may be performed.<br>
Twentieth Embodiment<br>
FIG. 32 are plan views that show the configuration of a<br>
component for a wireless IC device according to a twentieth<br>
embodiment. FIG. 33 is a plan view that shows the<br>
configuration of a wireless IC device provided with the<br><br>
component for a wireless IC device.<br>
In this example, soldering electrode portions 88 are<br>
formed on the rear side of the component for a wireless IC<br>
device, and are connected to the loop electrode 7 on the<br>
front face via through-holes 87, or the like. As shown in<br>
FIG. 33, the soldering electrode portions 88 are soldered to<br>
the ground electrode of the printed wiring substrate 80.<br>
In this way, by providing the soldering electrode<br>
portions 88 on the rear face, even when the position at<br>
which the ground electrode is formed does not spread to the<br>
edge of the printed wiring substrate 80, it may be easily<br>
mounted on the printed wiring substrate 80.<br>
Twenty-first Embodiment<br>
FIG. 34 is a plan view that shows the configuration of<br>
a component 113 for a wireless IC device according to a<br>
twenty-first embodiment. A mounting portion, on which the<br>
electromagnetic coupling module 1 is mounted, the matching<br>
circuit 67, and the loop electrode 7 are formed on a printed<br>
wiring substrate 13, such as a glass epoxy substrate. The<br>
loop electrode 7 differs from the example shown in FIG. 28<br>
in that the ends of the linear electrode are electrically<br>
connected to form a loop electrode.<br>
The electromagnetic coupling module 1 is mounted on the<br>
printed wiring substrate 13 to form the component 113 for a<br>
wireless IC device. The component 113 for a wireless IC<br><br>
device, as in the case of the one shown in FIG. 29 or FIG.<br>
31, is assembled to the printed wiring substrate.<br>
In the component 113 for a wireless IC device, the loop<br>
electrode 7 is not influenced by a state of soldering, or<br>
the like, highly accurate design with less fluctuations in<br>
impedance, or the like, may be achieved. In addition, when<br>
it is used as an electronic component, variations in<br>
characteristic are small.<br>
Note that in the above described embodiments, the<br>
wireless IC of the electromagnetic coupling module employs<br>
the wireless IC chip; however, the invention is not limited<br>
to the one using the wireless IC chip. For example, an<br>
organic semiconductor circuit may be formed on a substrate<br>
to form the wireless IC.<br><br>
