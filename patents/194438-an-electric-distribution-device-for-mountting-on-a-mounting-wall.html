Description<br>
Electric distribution device having a common conductor<br>
The invention relates to an electric distribution device for mounting on a mounting wall, having<br>
connections on one side of the distribution device<br>
and<br>
further connections on another side of the<br>
distribution device,<br>
each connection being respectively electrically<br>
connected to at least one further connection of<br>
7	the other side, and<br>
the two sides being arranged with respect to one another in such a way that they are situated on both sides of the mounting wall after mounting of the distribution device. Such a distribution device is used in the 7SJ600 protective unit from Siemens AG; 'the distribution device is described in the Siemens catalogue with the order No. E50001-U321-A69. This distribution device is used for the rear connection of the protective unit and is therefore fitted on the metallic rear side of the protective unit; the housing rear side forms a mounting wall for the distribution device, which is used to connect the protective unit electrically to the "outside world". Provided for this purpose on one side of the distribution device are connections which are situated in the interior of the unit when the distribution device is mounted, and are connected to electric components in the protective unit such as, for example, printed circuit boards. The connections in the interior of the unit are connected to in each case two further connections on another side of the distribution device; the two sides of the distribution device are arranged in this case with respect to one another in such a way that they are spatially separated by the mounting wall when the<br><br>
	- 2 -<br>
distribution device is mounted, with the result that the further connections on the other side of the distribution device are thus situated outside the protective unit. One of the two further connections is respectively formed by a screwed contact, and the respective other one of the two connections is formed by a clip contact.<br>
Another distribution device (Phoenix Contact-Katalog "Innovation in Interface", I Verbindungstechnik, '95/96, pages 124 to 125) is a terminal block with connections on one side of the terminal block and further connections on another side of the terminal block. The further connections are situated opposite respectively one connection on the other side and connected thereto electrically. Arranged spatially between the one side and the other side of the terminal block are common conductors which can be connected electrically by means of a screwed connection to the connections on one side, and thus to the further connections on the other side. The first connections and the further ones have screw terminals for connecting individual electric conductors. In the known terminal block, the two sides of the terminal block are arranged with respect to one another in such a way that when a terminal block is mounted on a mounting wall both the first connections and the further ones are situated on the same side of the mounting wall, with the result that this terminal block cannot be used directly to make electric contact between contacts located on different sides of the mounting wall.<br>
It is the object of the invention to specify a distribution device for mounting on a mounting wall which can be installed in a particularly simple and thus cost-effective fashion.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in the case of a distribution device of the type mentioned at the beginning by virtue of the fact that<br><br>
	- 3 -<br>
each first connection is respectively connected to a single further connection,<br>
at least one common conductor is arranged in terms of space between the one side and the other of the distribution device in such a way that it is situated between the mounting wall and the other side of the distribution device after mounting of the distribution device on the mounting wall, connected to the at least one common conductor are additional connections which are respectively arranged next to a further connection on the other side of the distribution device and respectively form therewith a pair of connections, and the connections of each pair of connections form contact elements of sockets for in each case one at least two-pole plug.<br>
The substantial advantage of the distribution device according to the invention consists in that electric devices having factory-prefabricated plugs can be connected to the distribution device on site particularly simply and quickly, since separate wiring of individual conductors of the electric devices is eliminated. The same holds for installations in which electric devices are to be connected to the distribution device via a cable harness with plugs. Moreover, possible faults in wiring or connecting devices or of the cable harness to the distribution device are substantially limited by the use of the sockets.<br>
 In order virtually completely to exclude faulty connection of electric devices or a cable harness to the distribution device, it is regarded as advantageous when the sockets are coded mechanically by appropriate shaping.<br>
In order to be able to fasten the distribution device in a particularly simple way to mounting walls, for example, it is regarded as advantageous when between one and the other side the distribution device<br><br>
	- 4 -<br>
includes on its outer side latching elements for fastening to a mounting wall.<br>
It is possible for the electric devices to be connected in a particularly cost-effective fashion to the distribution device when the distribution device is already fastened in the factory to the rear wall of one of the electric devices, that is to say when the mounting wall is the rear wall of an electric device, since then it is possible to dispense with a separate mounting wall and with a special electric connection between the electric device and the distribution device.<br>
In order to achieve a particularly firm mechanical connection between the mounting wall and the distribution device, it is regarded as advantageous when on the outer side of the distribution device the latching elements are assigned at least one resilient metal contact which bears against the mounting wall when the distribution device is latched home.<br>
An electric connection between the mounting wall and the sockets, and thus, if appropriate, also screening of electromagnetic radiation can be achieved particularly easily and thus advantageously by virtue of the fact that the sockets additionally respectively have a screen contact which is electrically connected to the at least one resilient metal contact.<br>
The at least one common conductor in the distribution device can be produced cost-effectively, and thus advantageously when it is formed by a metallic coating on an insulating plate.<br>
The additional connections can be produced in this case in a particularly cost-effective fashion when the connections are formed by pins which are arranged in the region of the metallic coating on the insulating plate.<br>
It is also possible to use the known, cost-effective printed circuit board technology in producing the common conductor; it is therefore regarded as<br><br>
	- 5 -<br>
advantageous when the at least one common conductor is a conductor track of a printed circuit board.<br>
The additional connections can be formed, for example, by metal pins which are soldered to the metallic coating on the insulating plate, or to the conductor track on the printed circuit. Since such an embodiment of the additional connections is also very cost-effective, it is regarded as advantageous when the pins are metal pins and are electrically connected to the metallic coating.<br>
The so-called three-dimensional {3D) printed circuit board constitutes a technical development of the printed circuit, and so it is regarded as advantageous when the pins are integrally extruded lugs of an insulating plate designed as a plastic plate, and are externally metallized in the manner of a three-dimensional printed circuit board.<br>
The common conductor need not necessarily be formed by a metallic coating on an insulating plate; instead of this, it can, for example, also be formed by a wired connection or a linear contact member which interconnects the metal pins forming the additional connections. The advantage of such a common conductor consists in that it is possible to dispense with a coating process or with an etching process for producing it.<br>
Given an appropriately dimensioned cross-section, contact members which can be used in the case of high electric currents are, for example, contact bars, and so it is regarded as advantageous when the contact member is a contact bar with eyes and is pushed onto the metal pins. The advantage of a contact bar with eyes consists in the comparatively simple mounting in the fabrication the distribution device.<br>
For the purpose of explaining the invention, Figure 1 shows a perspective representation of an exemplary embodiment of the distribution device according to the invention,<br><br>

Figure 2 shows a perspective representation of an<br>
exemplary embodiment of a plug for the<br>
distribution device according to the<br>
invention, Figure 3 shows common conductors in the exemplary<br>
embodiment in accordance with Figure 1 with<br>
their electric connections, in a diagrammatic<br>
representation, Figure 4 shows a side view of the exemplary embodiment<br>
in accordance with Figure 1, fastened in a<br>
mounting wall, Figure 5 shows the electric connections in the<br>
exemplary embodiment in accordance with<br>
Figure 1, in a diagrammatic sectional<br>
representation, Figure 6 shows an exemplary embodiment for resilient<br>
metal contacts in the distribution device<br>
according to the invention, Figure 7 shows a further exemplary embodiment for<br>
resilient metal contacts in the distribution<br>
device according to the invention, Figure 8 shows an exemplary embodiment for a common<br>
conductor in the distribution device<br>
according to the invention, Figure 9 shows a further exemplary embodiment for a<br>
common conductor in the distribution device<br>
according to the invention, and Figure 10 shows a third exemplary embodiment for a<br>
common conductor in the distribution device<br>
according to the invention. The same reference numerals are used in Figures 1 to 10 for technically identical elements.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective representation of an electric distribution device 1 having connections 3 on one side 5 of the distribution device 1. Located on another side 7 of the distribution device 1 are further connections 9 which are respectively electrically connected to a connection 3 on the one side 5 of the distribution device 1. Moreover, on its other side 7,<br><br>
	- 7 -<br>
the distribution device 1 has additional connections 10 which are respectively arranged in pairs next to a further connection 9 and in each case form a pair of connections 13. The connections 9 and 10 of each pair of connections 13 form contact elements of sockets 15 for at least two-pole plugs, that is to say in the representation in accordance with Figure 1 for three-pole plugs, since the sockets 15 respectively have a screen contact 16 in addition to their pair of contacts 13.<br>
Visible between one side 5 and the other side 7 of the distribution device 1 on an outer side 17 of the distribution device 1 are resilient metal contacts 19 •and latching elements ,2.0 which serve the purpose of fastening the distribution device 1 to a mounting wall (not represented) in the region of the side 5, The mounting wall can be, for example, the rear wall of an electric device. The resilient metal contacts 19 and the latching elements 20 are represented in detail in Figures 4 to 7, and will be explained in conjunction with theses figures.<br>
As may be gathered from Figure 1, owing to appropriate shaping in the form of cutouts 22, the sockets 15 have a mechanical code which prevents correspondingly coded plugs from being inserted with the wrong polarity into the sockets 15. A plug suitable for the distribution device 1 according to the invention is represented in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows a plug 25 for " the distribution device 1 according to the invention, having openings 27, through which three individual electric conductors can be connected to the plug 25. Figure 2 also shows further openings 29 which are used, together with cable ties (not represented) for stress relief of the individual electric conductors on the plug 25. The plug 25 also exhibits teeth 31, which are fitted to the plug 25 in such a way that they match the cutouts 22 on the distribution device 1. The sockets 15 of the distribution device 1 and the plug 25 are thus<br><br>
mechanically coded by appropriate shaping, insertion of the plug 25 into the distribution device 1 with the wrong polarity thereby being prevented.<br>
Figure 3 shows the other side 7 of the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1, in a diagrammatic top view. The further connections 9 and the additional connections 10, which together form the pair of connections 13, are to be seen. Also represented diagrammatically are the sockets 15 with their cutouts 22. A common conductor 35 connects the additional connections 10 of the sockets 15 in the half 37, uppermost in Figure 3, of the distribution device 1, and a further common conductor 38 connects the additional connections in the half 39, lowermost in Figure 3, of the distribution device 1. It may be pointed out that the representation of the two common conductors 35 and 38 in Figure 3 is only diagrammatic, since the common conductors are located spatially between one side 5 and the other side 7 of the distribution device 1 (see Figure 1). The electric connection between the further connections 9 and first connections 3 on one side 5 of the distribution device 1 can be performed, for example, by flat plug-in contacts {not represented); a detailed description of this connection will be supplied in conjunction with<br>
Figure 5.<br>
Figure 3 also shows an additional common conductor 40, which interconnects the screen contacts 16 of the sockets 15. The additional common conductor 40 is electrically connected (in a way not represented) to the resilient metal contacts 19 on the outer side 17 of the distribution device 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1 in a side view in the installed state. Two plugs 25 which are inserted on the other side 7 into the distribution device 1 are to be seen. Also indicated are the latching elements 20, which are used to fasten the distribution device 1 to a mounting wall 45. The latching elements 20 are assigned<br><br>
	- 9 -<br>
the resilient metal contacts 19, specifically in such a way that when the distribution device 1 has latched home on the mounting wall 45 a conducting connection is produced between the mounting wall 4 5 and the distribution device 1. The first connections 3 of the distribution device 1 on the one side 5 are electrically connected via a plug-in device 4 7 to a printed circuit board 4 9, which is located in an electric device {not represented) having the mounting wall 45 as rear wall. The electric connections in the plug-in device 47 are indicated by dashed lines 51.<br>
The electric connections between the resilient metal contacts 19 and the screen contacts 16 are represented in detail in Figure 5. Electric connecting lines 54 are to be seen between the resilient metal contacts 19 and the additional common conductor 40. Also represented diagrammatically are electric connecting lines 55 between the further connections 9 on the other side 7 of the distribution device 1 and the first connections 3 on the one side 5 of the distribution device 1. Figure 5 also shows the one common conductor 35, which short circuits the additional connections 10.<br>
Figure 6 shows an exemplary embodiment for a resilient metal contact 19. A metal spring 60, which is fastened to a wall part 62 of the distribution device 1, is to be seen. As represented in Figure 6, the metal spring 60 can be a cambered sheet which is pressed with its convex side against the mounting wall when the distribution device 1 is latched home into the mounting wall.<br>
Figure 7 shows a further exemplary embodiment for the resilient metal contacts 19. Metal lugs 64 which are fastened to the wall part 62 are to be seen.<br>
The one common conductor 35, the further common conductor 38 and the additional common conductor 4 0 in accordance with Figure 3 can be realized in different ways, as shown in Figures 8 to 10 on the example of one of these conductors in representations of a principle;<br><br>
	 -10-<br>
in this case, a detail of an insulating plate fitted in the distribution device 1 and having one of these conductors is respectively to be seen.<br>
Figure 8 shows a part of a printed circuit 70 having a conductor track 72, which forms the one common conductor 35 (see Figure 3), for example. Fastened to the printed circuit 7 0 in the region of the conductor track 72 are metal pins 7 3 which are electrically connected to the conductor track 72 by a soldered connection and, for example, form the additional connections 10 of the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1. Figure 8 also shows mutually insulated, further metal pins 74 which in each case form with one of their ends one of the further connections 9, and with another of their ends one of the further connections 3 of the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1. For the sake of clarity, the screen contacts are not represented in Figure 8.<br>
A further exemplary embodiment for the one common conductor is represented in Figure 9. A part of a three-dimensional printed circuit board 79, which is formed by a plastic plate 80 with integrally extruded, metallized lugs 84, is to be seen. Located on the plastic plate 80 is a metallic coating 86 which connects the lugs 84 electrically to one another and forms the one common conductor 35 in accordance with Figure 3; some of the lugs 84 thus form the additional connections 10 of the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1. Figure 9 also shows the further metal pins 74, which - as already described -form with their respective ends the first and the further connections 3 and 9 of the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1.<br>
Figure 10 shows a third exemplary embodiment for the one common conductor. A part of an insulating plate 90 with metal pins 92 onto which a contact bar 93 which has eyes and forms the one common conductor is to be seen. The metal pins 92 thus correspond to the additional connections 10 of the distribution device 1<br><br>
in accordance with Figure 1. Figure 10 also shows the further metal pins 7 4 which respectively form one of the first connections 3 and one of the further connections 9 of the distribution device 1 in accordance with Figure 1.<br><br>
