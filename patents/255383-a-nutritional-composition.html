				<td>IMPROVEMENT OF BARRIER INTEGRITY IN HIV PATIENTS<br>
FmJ&gt; OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for improving intestinal barrier integrity of HIV patients and a composition suitable for use in such method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The gastrointestinal epithelium normally functions as a selective barrier permitting the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes and water and preventing the exposure to dietary and microbial antigens, including food allergens. The gastrointestinal epithelium limits the passage of antigens to the systemic circulation that may be causing inflammatory reactions, e.g. allergic reactions. As the incidence of allergy, particularly food allergy, is increasing, many research groups search for (preventive) cures for these ailments.<br>
EP1272058 describes a composition containing indigestible oligosaccharides for improving tight junction to reduce intestinal permeability and reducing allergic reaction. The composition may comprise LC-PUFA's (long chain-polyuusaturated faty acids).<br>
BP 745001 describes a combination of indigestible oligosaccharides and n-3 and n-6 fatty acids for treatment ulcerative colitis.<br>
Usami et al (Clinical Nutrition 2001, 20(4): 351-359) describe the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on tight junction permeability in intestinal monolayer cells. In their hands, EPA was found to increase permeability, indicating that EPA is unsuitable to improve intestinal barrier integrity.<br>
The prior art formulations ate not optimally suited for improving barrier integrity.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a combination of selected long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA's) and selected oligosaccharides. The present combination of LC-PUFA's and oligosaccharides effectively improves barrier integrity, by<br>
syncrgistically improving intestinal permeability, mucus production, arid reducing the mucosal production of inflammatory mediators that could compromise intestinal barrier integrity. A combination of these compounds in a nutritional or pharmaceutical formulation is particularly suitable for improving intestinal integrity in HIV and AIDS patients.<br>
It was surprisingly found that selected LC-PUFA's effectively reduce epithelial paracellular permeability. In contrast to what Usaxni et al (Clinical Nutrition 2001, 20(4): 351-359) have reported, the present inventors found that G18 and C20 polyunsatoated fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachktonic acid (ARA), are capable of effectively reducing intestinal tight junction permeability.<br>
In addition to the LOPUFAs, the present composition contains oligosaccharides. The selected oligosaccharides improve the barrier integrity by stimulating the production of the mucus, which results in an increased mucus layer thickness. It is believed this effect is caused by the effects of the distinct oligosaccharides on the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Hence, when enterally administered to a mammal, the present combination of LC-PUFA and indigestible oligosaccharides synergistically improve barrier integrity and/or synergistically reduce intestinal permeability by simultaneous reduction of tight junction permeability and stimulation of mucus production.<br>
In a further aspect, the present composition improves, the quality of the intestinal mucus layer. The mucus layer comprises mucins, Mucins are high molecular mass glycoproteins that are synthesized and secreted by goblet cells. They form a gel-like layer on the mucosal surface, thereby improving barrier integrity. The mucus layer comprises different types of mucins, e.g. acid, neutral and sulphonated mucins. An increased heterogeneity of the mucus layer is believed to improve barrier functionality.<br>
The present composition preferably comprises at least two different oligosaccharides, which influence the mucosal architecture and advantageously influence mucin heterogeneity in the mucus layer, either directly or by changing the intestinal flora. Each different selected oligosaccharide is believed to have a different effect on mucus<br>
quantity and quality. Moreover, the two distinct oligosaccharides are also able to stimulate quality of mucus as reflected by the degree of sulphation through their syncrgistic stimulation of SCFA production. It was surprisingly found by the present inventors that a mixture of two different oligosaccharides according to the present invention synerfistically stimulates acetate production. It was also found by the present inventors mucus production is dependent on acetate production.<br>
It was further found that the precursor of ARA, gamma Unoienic acid (GLA), can be advantageously combined in the present composition for the treatment of HJV patients. HIV patients often suffer from intestinal inflammatory disorders, which makes a high intake of ARA undesirable, because ARA increases inflammatory response. It was found that part of the ARA can be replaced by GLA without having a negative effect on the effectiveness of the fat blend. Hence, in a further aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising the oligosaccharides, EPA, DHA, ARA and GLA and the use thereof in the treatment and/or prevention of HIV or AIDS.<br>
The present composition is preferably further improved by providing both long- and short-chain ojigosaccharides. Hie supply of different chain lengths results in stimulation of mucus prodoction in different parts of the ileum and colon. The short chain oligosaccharides (typically with a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 2,3,4 or 5) stimulate mucin production in the proximal colon and/or distal ileum, while the oligosaccharides with longer chain lengths (preferably with a degree of polymerisation (DP) of more than 5 up to 60) are believed to stimulate mucin production in the more distal parts of the colon.<br>
Even further improvements can be achieved by providing the at least two different oligosaccharides both as short-chain and long-chain oligosaccharides, These preferred embodiments all contribute to further improved barrier integrity throughout the ileum and/or colon.<br>
Furthermore, it was surprisingly found that EPA, DHA, and ARA were able to reduce the harmful effects of interleukm 4 (IL-4) on intestinal permeability. IJL-4 is a cyrokine which is secreted in increased amounts by mucosal T-cells in certain patients and<br>
induces intestinal permeability. Hence the present invention also provides for a method for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases wherein intestinal TL-4 concentration is increased, such as allergy, particularly atopic dermatitis,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nutritional composition comprising;<br>
a)	EPA, DHA and ARA, wherein the content of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid<br>
with 20 and 22 carbon atoms does not exceed 85 wt.% of the total fat content; and<br>
b)	at least two distinct oligosaccharides, wherein the two distinct oligosaccharides<br>
have a homology in monose units below 90 %.<br>
This composition can be advantageously used in a method for stimulating intestinal barrier integrity, said method comprising administering to a mammal said composition.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids for the manufacture of a composition for use in a method for the treatment of a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), said method comprising administering to said patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a composition comprising:<br>
a,	eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic<br>
acid (ARA), wherein the content of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid with<br>
20 and 22 carbon atoms does not exceed 85 wt.% of the total fat content; and<br>
b.	at least two distinct oligosaccharides (OL1 and OL2), wherein the two distinct<br>
oligosaccharides have a homology in monose units below 90 %.<br>
A particular embodiment of the treatment of a patient infected with HFV is the nutritional treatment.

PolvuMaturated fattv acids<br>
The present inventors surprisingly found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, n»3) and aracludonic acid (ARA, n 6) effectively reduce intestinal tight junction permeability. QLA (n-6) also effectively reduces barrier permeability. Hence the present composition, which is particularly suitable for improving intestinal barrier integrity, comprises EPA, DHA and ARA optionally combined with GLA.<br>

The ARA content preferably does not exceed 15 wt%, preferably does not exceed 5 wt%, more preferably does not exceed I wt% of the total fat. In the present ARA containing entered composition, EPA and DHA are advantageously added to balance the action of ARA, e.g, reduce the poteatial proinfiinunatory action of ARA metabolites. Excess metabolites from ARA may cause inflammation. The present nutritional composition preferably also contains gamroa-linotenic acid (GLA, C18), The GLA acts as a precursor of A£A, to replace at least in part the ARA content of the composition in order to further decrease the pro-inflammatory effect of ARA.<br>

For die ill and infants, the present composition is preferably combined with complete nutrition, including protein, carbohydrate and fat The present composition is advantageously administered to infants with the age between 0 and 2 years. The composition may be administered to patients which suffer from an impaired bamer integrity and healthy patients. The present compasition is advantageously used in a method for providing the nutritional requirements of a premature infant (an infant born before 37 weeks gestation).<br>
The present composition can also be advantageously used in a method for treatment and/or prevention of intestinal damage by administering the present composition to the patient prior to or after a medical treatment, which may cause intestinal damage. Such medical treatment may for example be surgery or entetal medicine treatment (e.g. antibiotic, analgesic, NSAID, chemotherapeutic agents etc).<br>
The present composition can also be advantageously used to treat or prevent diseases wherein intestinal barrier disruption is underlying the development of the course of the disease, e.g. in a method for the treatment or prevention of chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (fflD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ceUac disease, pancreatitis, hepatitis, arthritis or diabetes. Vurthermore, the invention can be used in a method for providing nutrition to patients tbat have undergone or are undergoing abdominal surgery and patients that experience postoperative dysfunction of the gut and/or malnourished patients.<br>
In a fUrther embodiment of die invention the present composition is advantageously administered to patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or patients which are injected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HTV), e.g. in. a method for the treatment of AIDS and/or HIV infection. Said method comprises the oral administration of the present composition, preferably combined with nutrients selected from the group consisting of carbohydrate, protein and fat. The compositions according to the invention are particularly useful for patients wich a CD4f T eel) count that is below the critical level of around 700 cells/tti blood, when generally Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) therapy is not yet needed, but when patients do already run the risk of developing or even experience one or more problems that can<br>
be related to intestinal hauler integrity, in particular dysfunction of intestinal hairier integrity. Hence, in a farther aspect the present invention provides a method for stopping or stowing down the reduction in CD4+ T cell count or improving the CD4+ T cell count in patients sufifering from HIV and/or AIDS, said method comprising administering the present composition. In one embodiment the method comprises administering the present composition to a patient, said patient being a human subject having a CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell count between 200 to 700 cells/ixl blood. In yet another embodiment the method comprises administering the present composition to a patient, said patient not being treated by Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, In a particular embodiment the patient has a CD4+ T-lymphocyce cell count between 200 to 700 cells/nl blood and is not being treated by Highly Active Antinetro viral Therapy.<br>
Furthermore, the invention can also be used to treat or prevent complications resulting from reduced barrier integrity, particularly in a method for the treatment and/or prevention of diarrhea, particularly infant diarrhea. Due to the reduced incidence in infant diarrhea, the present composition can also be advantageously used to reduce diaper rash,<br>
Administering the present composition reduces passage of dietary and microbial antigens, particularly food allergens, from the intestinal lumen into the mucosal or systemic circulation, and hence can be advantageously used in a method for the treatment or prevention of allergy and/or allergic reaction, particularly in a method for the treatment or prevention of food allergy, e.g. allergic reaction resulting from the ingestion of foodstuff.<br>
It was alsp found by the present inventors that EPA, DHA and/or ARA are capable of reducing the effects of EL-4 on intestinal permeability.

Formula's<br>
It was found that the present composition could be advantageously applied in food, such as baby food and clinical food. Such food preferably comprises iipid, protein and carbohydrate and is preferably administered in liquid form. The term "liquid food" as used in the present invention includes dry food (e.g. powders), which are accompanied with instructions as to admix said dry food mixture with a suitable liquid (e.g. water).<br>
Hence, the present invention also relates to a nutritional composition which preferably comprises between 5 and 50 en% Iipid, between 5 and SO en% protein, between 15 and 90 ea% carbohydrate and the present combination of oligosaccharides and 1 C-PUFA's. Preferably the present nutritional composition preferably contains between 10 and 30 en% Iipid, between 7.5 and 40 en% protein and between 25 and 75 e.n% carbohydrate (en% is short for energy percentage and represents the relative amount each constituent contributes to the total caloric value of the preparation).<br>
Preferably a combination of vegetable lipids and at least one oil selected from the group consisting of fish oil and omega-3 vegetable, algae or bacterial oil is used,<br>
The proteins used in the nutritional preparation are preferably selected from the group of non-human animal proteins (such as milk proteins, meat proteins and egg proteins), vegetable proteins (such as soy protein, wheat protein, rice protein, and pea protein), free amino acids and mixtures thereof. Cow milk derived nitrogen source, particularly cow milk protein proteins such as casein and whey proteins are particularly preferred,<br>
Stool irregularities (e.g, hard stools, insufficient stool volume, diarrhoea) is a major problem in many babies and ill subjects that receive liquid foods. It was found that stool problems may be reduced by administering the present oligosaccharides in liquid food which have an osraolality between SO and 500 mOsm/kg, more preferably between 100 and 400 mOsm/kg.<br>
In view of the above, it is also important that the liquid food does not have an excessive caloric density, however still provides sufficient calories to feed the subject, Hence, the liquid food preferably has a caloric density between 0.1 and 2.5 kcal/ml, even more preferably a caloric density of between 0,5 and 1.5 kcal/ml, most preferably between 0.6 and 0.8 kcaj/ml,<br>
EXAMPLBg<br>
Example 1: Efifeet of LC-PU|?A on barrier integrity<br>
Monolayers (MC) of intestinal epithelial cell lines T84 (American Type Culture Collection (ATTC), Manassas, USA) were cultured on transwell filters (Coming, Costar BV, The Netherlands) allowing both mucosal and serosal sampling and stimulation of human intestinal epithelial cells. Two weeks post confluency the monolayers were incubated in the luminal compartment with polyunsaturated fatty acids ARA (arachidonic acid; 5,8,ll,l4-eico3atetraenoic acid), DHA (cis-4,7,10,13,16,19 docosahexaenoic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) or control palmitic (C 16:0) acid (Palm) (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), The latter procedure was<br>
chosen to mimic the in vivo administration route of the dietary compounds Cells were incubated with ARA, DHA, EPA, GLA or palmitic acid for 0, 24, 48 and 72 hr at different concentrations (10 uM and 100 \iM). Experiments were performed to evaluate basal barrier integrity. The epithelial barrier function was determined by measuring the transepithelial resistance (TER, Q.cma) was measured by epithelial volt-ohm meter (EVOM; World Precision Instruments, Germany) and permeability for 4kD FITC dextran (paracellular permeability marker, Sigma, USA), Resistance; (. Epithelial permeability for 4 kDa FTTC-dextran was determined as follows, Prior to dextran fluxes the medium was refreshed with culture medium without phenol red for one hour Mowed by addition of 5 u4 (stock 100 rng/ml) 4 kDa PITC-dextran to the lumenal compartment. After 30 min incubation 100 f.\l sample was collected from the aerosal compartment and the fluorescent signal measured at excitation wavelength 485 nm and emission 520 nm (FLUOstar Galaxy®, BMG Labtechnologies, USA), FITC-dextran fluxes were calculated as pmol FITC-dextran/cmz/b. Statistical analyses were performed using the ANOVA (SPSS version 10).<br>
Results of the effect of fatty acids (100 \sM) on spontaneous barrier integrity after 72 hr incubation are given in Table 1. Table 1 shows that the LC-PUFA's ARA, EPA, GLA and DHA reduce the molecular flux and improve epithelial resistance In contrast the control experiments show that palmitic acid has die opposite effects, i,e, compromises barrier integrity. These results are indicative for the advantageous use of EPA, DHA , GLA and ARA, and in particularly ARA in the composition according to the present invention and for use in a method according to the present invention, e.g. in a method for improving barrier integrity. These result further support the synergistic effects of the present combination of fatty acids and indigestible oligosaccharides. Figure I shows the time and dose (lOpM and lOOfiM) dependent effects of various fetty acids (palmitic acid, DHA, GLA, and AA) on basal barrier integrity (TER). Figure I shows mat the LC-PUFA's AA, DHA, and GLA, improve the epithelial barrier integrity as reflected by increased resistance (TER). These results are indicative for the advantageous use of EPA, DHA, GLA and ARA, in particularly ARA, in the composition according to the present invention and for use in a method according to the present invention, i.e. in a method for improving barrier integrity. These results further support the synergistic effects of the present combination of fatty acids and indigestible oligosaccharides.<br>

. on IL-4 mediated barrier disruption Monolayere (MC) of intestinal epithelial cell lines T84 (ATCC, USA) were cultured on transwell filters (Coming, Costar BV, The Netherlands) allowing both raueosal and serosal sampling and stimulation of human intestinal epithelial cells, Two weeks post confluency the monolayers were incubated in the presence of IL-4 (2 ng/ml, serosal compartment, Sigma, USA ) with or without polyunsaturated fatty acids ARA, DHA, GLA, EPA, or control palmitic acid (10 pM or 100 uM, mucosal compartment, Sigma, St. Louis, USA). Cells were pre-incubated with GLA, ARA, DHA, EPA, or palmitic acid for 48 hr prior to the IL-4 incubation. The co-incubation of PUFA's and palmetic acid with IL-4 was continued for another 48 hr; while culture medium and additives were changed every 24 hr. The epithelial barrier function was determined by measuring the transepithelial resistance (TER) and permeability as described in example 1. Statistical evaluation was performed as described in example 1. Results of the effect of GLA, ARA, DHA, EPA and palmitic acid (100 (j,M) on IL-4 mediated barrier disruption are given in Table 2. Table 2 shows that the LC-PUFA's GLA, ARA, DHA and EPA inhibit the increased flux caused by ILA, In contrast palmetic acid had a detrimental effect and decreased barrier disruption compared to control. These results are indicative for the advantageous use of GLA, ARA, DHA, and EPA in clinical and infant nutrition formulations to prevent or reduce IL^t mediated barrier disruption, e.g. as occurs in food or cows milk allergy. These result further support the synergistk effects of the present combination of fatty acids and indigestible oligosaccharides.<br>
Figure 2 gives the lime and dose (lO^M and lOOuM) dependent protective effects of various FA's (palmitic acid, DHA, GLA, and ARA) on IL-4 mediated barrier destruction (Flux). Figure 2 shows that ARA, DHA and GLA protect against IL-4 mediated barrier disruption as reflected by decreased 4kD dextran flux. These results are indicative for the advantageous use of GLA, ARA, DHA and EPA in clinical and infant nutrition formulations to prevent or reduce IL-4 mediated barrier disruption, e,g. as occurs in food or cows milk allergy. These results further support the synergistic effects of the present combination of fatty acids and indigestible oligosaccharides.<br>

Serum bottles were filled with 25 ml medium and sterilized for 15 minutes at 121 °C,<br>
Fresh faecal samples were mixed with preservative medium and stored for several hours at 4 °C. The preserved solution of faeces was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 minutes, supernatant removed and faeces mixed with McBain Sc Mac Farlane medium in a weight ratio of 1:5. Of this faecal suspension 3 ml were combined with 85 mg glucose or prebiotic or with no addition (blanc) in a bottle and mixed thoroughly. A t=0 sample was withdrawn (0,5 ml). 2.5 ml of the resulting suspension is brought in a dialysis tube in a 60 ml bottle filled with 60 ml of the buffered medium. The bottle was closed well and incubated at 37°C. Samples were taken from the dialysis tube (0.2 ml) or dialysis buffer (1.0 ml) with a hypodermic syringe after 3, 24, and 48 hours and immediately put it on ice to stop fermentation. The experiment was carried out using the following samples: l)85mgTOS<br>
2)	85 mg inulin<br>
3)	85mg TOS/iroilin in a ratio of 9/1 (w/w) and<br>
4)	85mg OS/inulin in a ratio of 1/1 (w/w).<br>
SCFA (acetate, propionate, butyfate) were quantitated using a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph (GC) (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, U.S.A.) equipped with a flame ionisation detector, 0,5 ul of the sample was injected at 80 °C in the column (Stabilwax,<br>
15	x 0.53 mm, film thickness 1.00 urn, Restek Co., U.S.A.) using helium as a carrier<br>
gas (3.0 psi). After injection of the sample, the oven was heated to 160 UC at a speed of<br>
16	"C/min, followed by heating to 220 °C at a speed of 20 °C/min and finally<br>
maintained at 220 °C for 1.5 minutes. The temperature of the injector and detector was<br>
200 °C. 2'ethylbytyric acid was used as an internal standard.<br>
Figure 3 depicts the absolute (Figure 3A) and relative SCFA profile (Figure 3B) resulting from fermenting the different oligosaccharides. Figure 3 A shows that a mixture of two different oligosaccharides (TOS/Inulin), wherein the two distinct oligosaccharides have a homology in raonose units below 90 and a different chain length results in a significantly and synergistically increased amount of SCFA (particularly acetate) pet gram fiber than single components, Figure 3B shows that the addition of a combination of TOS/Inulin favored a higher proportion of the beneficial acetate (B). The acetate production in vivo translates to improved mucus production by goblet cells and a measure for intestinal mucus layer thickness (see example 4). These results ate indicative for the advantageous use of the present composition.Monolayers of intestinal epithelial T84 cells (ATCC, USA) cells were cultured in 24 or 96 wells tissue culture plates (Coming B.V.). T84 were incubated with tie short chain fatty acids acetate, proprionate and bwtyrate (SCFA, Merck, USA) for 24 h in a concentration range of 0.025-4.0 mM. Supernatants and/or cells were collected and MUC-2 (mucin) expression determined. A dotblot technique was used to determine MUC-2 expression in the cell cultures, since mucins are extremely large glycoproteins (over 500 kDa) which makes them difficult to handle in western blotting techniques. The method was validated using pre-immune serum (T84 stained negative), CCD-18Co (ATCC, USA) negative control cells and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cell samples were collected in Laemmli (protein isolation buffer) and protein determination performed using a microptotein assay (Biorad, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol. Samples (0.3-0,7-1.0 ug/2 fil) were dotted on nitrocellulose membranes (ScMeicher &amp; Schuell, Germany). Membranes were blocked in TBST/5% Prodvar (Nutricia, The Netherlands) followed by I h incubatiop with anti-MUC-2 antibody (kindly donated by Dr, Einerhand, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). After washing, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Santacruz Biotechnology, USA) and for substrate detection ECL (Roche Diagnostics, The Netherlands) was used. Densitometry was performed using the Lumi-Imager (Boehrittger Mannheim B.V., The Netherlands) and Ihe signal was expressed in light units,(BLU). BLU's were also expressed relative to control incubations (%BLU). To<br>
compare the stimulatory effect of SCFA on MUC-2 expression basal MUC-2 expression levels were deducted.<br>
Figure 4 shows the differential effects of SCFA (acetate, proprionatc., butyrate) on MUC-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (MC T84) and epithelial-mesenchymal cell co-cultures (CC T84). Figure 4 also shows th&amp;t acetate is more potent in stimulating MUC-2 expression (mucus production) as compared to propionate and butyric. Hence, the present combination of oligosaccharides (which was shown to increase acetate production (see example 3)) is particularly useful for stimulating mucus production and can be advantageously used in a method for stimulating barrier integrity,Ingredients (per liter), energy 672 Kcal; Protein 15 g; Whey: Casein ratio 60:40; Fat 36 g; Carbohydrate 72 g; Vitamin A 750 RE; Mixed natural carotids 400 III; Vitamin D 10.6 meg; Vitamin F 7.4 mg; Vitamin K 67.0 meg; Vitamin B.sub.l (thiamin) 1000 meg; Vitamin B.sub.2 (riboflavin) 1500 meg; Vitamin B.sub.6 (pyridoxine) 600 meg; Vitamin B.sub.12 (cyanaoobalmine) 2.0 meg; Niacin 9.0 meg; Folic Acid 80 meg; Pautothenic Acid 3000 meg; Biotin 90 meg; Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 90 mg; Choline 100 mg; Inositol 33 mg; Calcium 460 Mg; Phosphorous 333 Mg; Magnesium 64 Mg; Iron 8.0 Mg ; Zinc 6.0 Mg; Manganese 50 meg; Copper 560 meg; Iodine 100 meg; Sodium 160 mg; Potassium 650 mg; Chloride 433 tng and Selenium 14 meg; wherein the fet content provides includes 3 gram fish oil and 3 grams 40% arachidonic acid oil (DSM Food Specialties, Delft, Netherlands); further comprising 4 gram transgalactooligosaccharides Elix'or™ (Borculo Domo Ingredients, Netherlands) and 4 gram Raftiline™ (Orafti Active Food Ingredients, Belgium).<br>
