				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a device for controlling a cursor to rotate rightwards and leftwards and the method thereof, especially to a cursor controlling device for rotating a X axis movable optic grid and a Y axis movable optic grid to a proper angle, further, said cursor may be moved intendedly<br>
2	Description of the prior Art<br>
The cursor controlling technique in the conventional computer display comprises a keyboard, a mouse, a trace ball, a touch controlling display, a optical pen. etc However, it is generally inconvenient to control the movement and positioning of a cursor by using the conventional cursor controlling devices For example, it is ineffective to use a conventional keyboard to drive a cursor While if a conventional mouse is used to control the movement of the cursor, the mouse must be moved on the table and accordingly the arm is also moved, wherein the movement of twist will drive the moving of the front arm, subsequently, the rear arm is also moved. in consequently, the frequent movement of arm is not met the requirement of Ergonomios, therefore for a long period of usage the arm will has an ache easily<br>
US patent No 4 9.15.728 disclosed a square opening 136a formed on a top plate 134a of the outer case 132a as shown in Fig 1. The square opening 136a servers as margin for the finger-grippable element. The photo encoder includes a series of mask sections and transparent sections interleavely. In case the photo encoder with phase A and phase B is required to generate 320 phase signals per inch ( not includes the central portion), the minimum distance with a mask section and a transparent section on the photo encoder will be 0.16mm( 25 1mm/160 -0 .16mm) In<br>
2<br><br>
consideration of the 90 degrees phase difference between the phases A and B, the distance will be equal to 0 08mm The narrow displacement nears a maximum tolerant range during operation Further, when the hardware sends out a pulse signal, it must displace a travel length of 0 08mm It will require rather precise movement to generate 320 pixels signal within a distance ranges of 25 4mm It is therefore noted that the prior art patent requires precise parallel structure for configuring the square opening and photo encoder in manufacture and assembly Otherwise, each dot on the square opening in Y-axis direction will have an incorrect X-axis margin value, similarly, each dot on the square opening in X-axis direction will have an incorrect Y-axis margin value<br>
To match the different resolution of the various display, for example 800*600 or 1280*1204, the following various methods are possible<br>
1	increasing the size of the finger controllable member, or<br>
2	decreasing the distance between each mask section and transparent<br>
section on the photo encoder<br>
The former method will tire the user due to the length of the finger controllable member is increased, especially the operating range is limited in left and right direction in movement. The second method above will has problem that it can not correctly generate a signal at each moving tune because that the distance is decreased causing a small effective displacement Moreover, it is possible to cause a problem that the pointing device generates two or three pulse signals at each moving time 1 he design of shorten the distance of photo encoder can reduce the operating ranges of user hand during moving the finger controllable member, and it is especially applicable in use of remote controller for a multi-media system with more convenience and comfort, if the moving range of the finger controllable member is smaller then 16mm, then the moving of the lingers will be confined dramatically<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figs 12A to I2F show the structure and signal waveform of the photo encoder and the photo detector in accordance with the pointing device of the present invention This embodiment uses two photo transistors to detect the light beam of a LED The photo encoder 4 has two printed pattern lines as shown in Fig 12A Both the printed attem line has a series of mask sections and transparent sections interleavely with uniform width, but with 90 degrees phase difference therebetween When the photo encoder 4 is moved relative to the photo detector 6 as shown in Fig 12C, the light generated by the LED 61 will be detected by the photo detector 63 via the photo encoder 4 and the calibrating photo encoder 62 Therefore, the photo detector 63 generates a series of binary pulse signals and transmits the signals to the control circuit board 18 Under performance of the control circuit as shown in Fig 14 and the control flows as shown in Figs 15A to 15C, the moving direction of the photo encoder may be detected according to the binary pulse signals<br>
Another, it shows that one end of the X-axis photo encoder 4 has a transparent end section 4C1, and the other end thereof has a mask end section 4C2 The purpose of the transparent and mask end section is to serve as a left margin Xmin and a right margin Xmax of the X-axis photo encoder Similarly, the Y-axis photo encoder has a left margin and a right margin. It is to be understood from this arrangement that the margin are obtained directly from the photo encoder capable of providing digital form signal Obviously, the present invention is different from the prior art, and it is easier to design a control program for determination<br>
Alternately, the photo encoder 4 in said Fig 12A may has an end section 4C3 combining a transparent line and a mask line as shown in Fig 12F, instead of the end section 4C1 and 4C2 shown in Fig 12A In performance, both the signals XA and XI3 will be changed its phase at the same time after reaching the margin of the photo encoder 4 and exceeding<br><br>
a distance of 1/4 period On the contrary, the phase of signal XA or XB will be changed when it does not reach the margin of the photo encoder So, the control circuit of the present invention may detect whether the phase of the signals XA and XB is changed at the same time to determine whether the photo encoder reaches its margin or not<br>
Table 1 is a state table which shows when a computer system connected with the cursor positioning device of the present invention receives the signals XA and XB, the computer can determine the moving direction X+ or X- of the positioning device according to the binary value of the signals XA and XB The computer may get a flag Xmax and a flag Xmin according to the signal X+ and X- respectively, and then store the status of the flags into a register<br>
Refering to Fig 12B again, it shows a perspective view of the X-axis photo detector 6 suitable to use the photo encoder as shown in Fig I2A The photo detector is composed of a LED 61, a fixed calibrating photo encoder 62, and a photo transistor 63 The arrangement of the components of the photo detector and the movable photo encoder 4 is illustrated in Fig 12C As shown in the drawing, the photo encoder 4 is arranged between the fixed calibrating photo encoder 62 and the LED 61 Therefore, the light beam transmitted by the LED 61 may either reach to the photo transistor 63 via the movable photo encoder 4 or be obstructed by the photo encoder The fixed calibrating photo encoder 62 has a series of printed patterns including transparent sections and mask sections interleavely as shown in Fig 12D, and the width of the printed pattern is designed to correspond to that of the movable photo encoder 4. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the movable photo encoder 4 is very closed to the fixed calibrating photo encoder 62, so that the light beam generated by the LLD 61 reaches the photo transistor 63 through the movable photo encoder 4 without light diffusion Fig 12E shows a series of pulse signals XA and XB generated by the photo detector assembly<br><br>
It is noted that the movable photo encoder 4 of the present invention is equipped with interleaved printed patterns and the movable photo encoder 4 is designed to close to the fixed photo encoder 62 in space when moving, capable of generating a series of ON and OFF signals Due to this special design, the pitch of the encoder is possible to reach 320 patterns per inch The prior art requires laser beam LEDs to get the effect of high density pitch, otherwise the conventional photo detector will has series light diffusion problem These prior art problems can be simply overcame by the present invention<br>
Fig 14 is a detail control circuit diagram with four sets of photo detecting circuits, with reference to the photo detector shown in Fig 12 In this embodiment, the X-axis phase signals are detected by two photo detecting circuit 81 and 81a The first X-axis photo detecting circuit 81 includes a LED 6la lor generating a light beam which will be detected by the photo transistors 63a and 63b The second X-axis photo detecting circuit 81a includes a LED 61b for generating a light beam which will be detected by the photo transistors 63c and 63d The Y-axis phase signals are detected by two photo detecting circuit 82 and 82a The first Y-axis photo detecting circuit 82 includes a LED 71a for generating a light beam which will be detected by the photo transistors 73a and 73b I he second Y-axis photo detecting circuit 82a includes a LED 71b for generating a light beam which will be detected by the photo transistors 73c and 73d The detected X-axis and Y-axis phase signals are supplied to a processing circuit 83 for further processes A switch circuit 84 are electrically connected to the processing circuit 83, which includes a left switch 1 la, a right switch 12b, and a middle switch 13c. The control circuit is provided with a voltage regulating circuit 85 for supplying a stable power source An output circuit 86 is used to amplify the output signal supplied from the processing circuit 83 and then supply the amplified output signal to a host computer (not shown) via transmission lines<br><br>
Referring to Fig 15A, the computer first set the transmission rate, start bit, end bit, and data length of the communication port RS232 in step F2, followed by performing system initialization step F1 ln step F3, all flag status, registers, and associated value for determination of operating speed are cleared Thereafter, the computer reads the digital value of the phase signals XA, XB, YA, and YB, and finds out corresponding value of the X+, X-, Xmax, and Xmin from the state table of TABLE I as listed previously( only show the state of X-axis), and then stores the values for further comparison The computer will reads the values XA, XB, YA, and YB again in step F5, and then compares these values with the first read values, to determine whether the status is changed or not If the status is not changed, it indicates the finger controllable member of the cursor positioning device has no movement, and the procedure will return to read the XA, XB, YA, and YB again. On the contrary, if the status is changed, a X-mode determination procedure outlined by dot line as shown in Fig 15A, is performed There are four possible status i e (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1) to be compared with the previous status. The computer may get the information about the moving speed of the cursor positioning device by calculating the time of changing of the various status Typically, the system clock of the computer is ranged from 4 to 8 MHz nowadays In practice, it is found that the normal operating speed that the user moves the finger controllable member of the cursor positioning device is below 5KHz Therefore, the computer may easily detect the operating speed of the cursor positioning device<br>
The computer may determine the position of the cursor with reference to TABLE I above and the pulse signal listed in Fig 12E At first, the computer supposes the previous status is (0,0) in step F9. In case that XA=1 and XB=0, it indicates the finger controllable member is moved to direction X+, while in case that XA-0 and XB=1, it indicates the finger controllable member is moved to direction X- In case that XA=1 and XB=1, it indicates the finger controllable member either Y?aches a<br>
10<br><br>
minimum limit or maximum limit dependent on whether the flag X+flag is set or not After these determinations, various flag status X+, Xmin, Xman, etc are obtained, and then these flag status are accumulated in predetermined registers for further judgment for the control program So, in practical operation, the user just simply moves the finger controllable member to the left upper corner of the device to perform zero position initialization, and then the device can generate correct X-axis and Y-axis absolute coordinate values<br>
Fig 15D is a subprogram flow chart of the control program, explaining how the cursor is moved to positive direction, while Fig 15E is a subprogram flow chart of the control program, explaining how the cursor is moved to the other direction The displacement of the cursor moving on the computer display is proportional to the moving distance of the finger controllable member The factor of the proportion depends on the moving speed of the finger controllable member The purposes of these procedures are as follows<br>
1	To limit the displacement of the finger controllable member to a range<br>
about 16mm or less Inspitefully, the movement of the cursor reptesenting<br>
on the computer display is not effected by the shorten displacement, and<br>
the different moving speed of the finger controllable member So, the<br>
present invention is<br>
impossible has problems of the prior art that the finger controllable member already reaches a margin of the positioning device but the cursor not reaches a corresponding margin on the computer screen not the finger controllable member not yet reaches a margin of the positioning device but the cursor already reaches a margin on the computer screen<br>
2 When the cursor on the display moves to any desired position thereon, there are necessary fine displacements around the position<br>
3 The moving speed and located position of the cursor on the display can always match that of the finger controllable member, resulting of a smooth, fast, and precise movement in operation<br>
11<br><br>
4 The finger controllable member in each axis, for example X- axis, has two registers for positive directional performance and two registers for negative directional performance The respective value recorded in the positive and negative registers is mutual associated, so that the finger controllable member may return to its original point and the cursor on the display may also return to its original point The various symbols used in the control program flow chart are defined in TABLE11 <br>
The VX represents the moving speed of the finger controllable member, changing among at least two different moving speeds, such as V1, V2, V3, and so on Different proportional factor K are appointed to correspond to the different moving speeds That is, the factor K is a constant representing that the displacement of the cursor moving on the display is proportional to the detected displacement of the finger controllable member on<br>
the effective area of the positioning device for example, factors K1 and K2 may be various combinations, such as (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), and so on, wherein the value of Kl and K2 may be a default value as a parameter for device driver program, which is selected by the user. It is therefore possible to determine the displacements C1 and C2 with reference to formula 1 and formula listed above, at both the first speed level and the second speed level In a preferred embodiment, C1 and C2 may be a default parameter according to the resolution of the computer display used When the resolution of the display is increased, the scale of the constant value K2 may be increased correspondingly, so that the cursor can be moved in a fine displacement operating mode which can match the minimum pixel displacement requirements of various display resolutions In such case, due to K2 is increased in accordance with the increment of the display resolution, the minimum pixel displacement is correspondingly decreased As result, the movement of the cursor on the display is very smooth Example<br>
12<br><br>
Supposing that the display resolution at X-axis of the display is 640, the<br>
displacement of the photo encoder is about 15 68 (i e 196*0 08mm),<br>
640 =(l+Cl)+(4cursor2), K1 = l, K2=4<br>
196=C1+C2<br>
C2=148, C1=48<br>
In case that the display resolution at X-axis of the display is<br>
1024,<br>
1024 =(I+Cl)+(7cursor2), Kl=l, K2=7<br>
196=C1+C2<br>
C2=138, C1=58<br>
When the display resolution is increased from 640 to 1024, the distance from pixel to pixel is decreased So, in spite of K2 being changed from 4 to 7 it will not effect the smooth performance of the cursor moving on the display In fine operation mode, the cursor can be moved at precise displacement from pixel to pixel on the display, no matter the change of the display resolution To reduce the distance between the optic grids C3, instade of reducing the the illumination and the distance for each lattice, the lattice number is reduced (in the prior art, it is reduced from 320 to 200), thus it is umpossible that the finger controllable member is only moved one lattice, but the display cursor is moved two or three lattice Therefore, if is appreciated from the description hereinablve, if the finger controlling controlling element want to move within a range samaller than 16mm from pixel to pixel, the present equation must be used, and by changing the value of recorder and the constant K. a cursor controlling device which is moved on an area of 10mm X 8mm may be derived another, said device may be used to control any point from the cursor to the display. In the a small movement cursor controlling device, C1 = 15, C2=27,and C3=113 (1X15-5X27- 10x113- 1280). In such a design, the distance between the optic grids of x axis = (15+27+113) X0 08mm -12mm, the distance between the optic grids of Y axis = 1024/1280 X<br>
13<br><br>
12mm=10mm, thus the length of said finger controllable member may be reduced to 25mm, or further to 20mm to suit the operation of thumb Fig 15D is a subprogram flow chart of the control program, explaining how the cursor is moved to a positive direction, while Fig 15E is a subprogram flow chart of the control program explaining how the cursor is moved to the other direction, represented as H1 and H2 respectively in Fig 15A When the finger controllable member is moved in positive direction, the value stored in positive directional registers VIXl+reg and V2X2+reg will be increased Correspondingly, the value stored in negative directional registers V1X1-reg and V2X2-reg will be decreased in accordance with the increment of the positive directional registers When X-axis coordinate is minimum, the value stored in register V1X1+reg is 0, V1X1-reg is equal to value of C1, V2X2+reg is 0, and V2X2-reg is equal to value of C2, when X-axis coordinate is maximum, the value stored in register VIXl+reg is equal to value of C1, V1X1-reg is 0, V2X2+reg is equal to value of C2, and V2X2-reg is 0. The moved displacement of the finger controllable member at the third speed level is transferred to temporary values V1X1+ and V2X2+ by using formulas 4 and 5 listed in TABLE III Thereafter, the temporary values are stored in registers V1X1-reg and V2X2+reg respectively, and then the value of reference constant K.3 may be calculated by using formula 2 listed in TABLE III After these procedures, the finger controllable member may correctly return to original position, and the cursor on the display may also correctly return to original position<br>
For example K1 = 1, K2=4 K3=(n-l)K2-(n-2)K1 =(3-l)4-(3-2)1<br>
= 7<br><br>
The result indicates that in case the displacement of the finger controllable member is equal 1, the movement of the cursor on display will be equal to 7 Then, the displacement of the finger controllable member at the third speed level may be transferred and stored in registers VIXl+reg and V2X2+reg by using formulas 4 and 5 listed in TABLE III<br>
K3*V3X3+ =K2*V2X2++K1*V1X1 V3X3+ -V2X2++V1X1 + 7*1 =4*V2X2++V1X1 +<br>
1=V2X2++VIX1 +<br>
V2X2+=+2,VlXl+=-l It is noted, in this case, the increment of V2X2+reg is 2, and the decrement of VIXl+reg is 1<br>
The result indicates that the value stored in registers V2X2+reg and VIXl+reg at positive direction (I e , V2X2+reg +V1X1+reg =2+(-l) - 1) is match the real displacement of the finger controllable member at the third speed level<br>
Further, formula 3 (K1cursor1) + (K2cursor2) = the displacement of the display K1XV1X1+ieg + K2VV2X2+reg = the displacement of the display thatis,(l*-l) + (4*2)=7<br>
It indicates the same result that the displacement of the cursor on display is equal to 7 when the finger controllable member is moved at the third speed level The displacement of the finger controllable member at the third speed level is transferred into temporary values V2X2+ and V1X1 + by formulas 4 and 5 listed in TABLE III, and then the temporary values are stored in registers V2X2+reg and V1X1+reg respectively<br>
It is obviously that the moving speed and positioning of the cursor on display may match that of the finger controllable member in accordance with the present invention, with advantage of smooth, fast, stable, and<br>
15<br><br>
precise moving performance The cursor positioning device of the present invention is provided with two positive directional registers and two negative directional registers. The value stored in the positive directional registers and the negative directional registers is always mutual associated, so that the finger controllable member may correctly return to original position and also the cursor may correctly return to original position correspondingly<br>
It is noted that since the finger controllable members of the positive directional registers and the negative directional registers on X axis are mutual association The definition of the positive directional registers and the negative directional registers in X axis is only for the purpose of better understanding Alternatively, it is also possible to use two positive registers to achieve the same performance<br>
After the main program finishes the determination procedure in direction X+ as described above, the procedure determines whether VX is less than or equal to a predetermined reference speed in step F41 of Fig 15D If yes, it indicates the speed of the finger controllable member is less than a lower limit speed V1, ie the first speed level In step F42, it further determines whether the value stored in register V1X1-rsg of the first speed level is larger than or equal to a constant CI If no, the displacement of the cursor is set to be proportional to that of the finger controllable member times a constant K1, and then in step F43 increasing the value of V1X1+reg, decreasing the value of V1X1-reg, and transmitting the value to computer If the value stored in register VIXl+reg of the first speed level is larger than or equal to a constant CI, it indicates the VIXl+reg reaches a maximum value In such a case, the displacement of the cursor will be set to be proportional to that of the finger controllable member times a constant K2, and then in step F46 increasing the value of V2X2+reg , decreasing the value of V2X2-reg, and transmitting the value to computer<br>
16<br><br>
If the result in step F41 is no, it indicates that the finger controllable member is at an upper limit of the reference speed V1. In step F44, it further judges whether VX is at an upper limit or at a lower limit of the reference speed V2 In case VX is at an lower limit of V2, a step F45 is performed to judge whether the value stored in the register V2X2+reg is maximum value or not If yes, the displacement of the cursor will be set to be proportional to that of the finger controllable member times a constant K1; if no, the displacement of the cursor will be set to be proportional to the displacement of the finger controllable member times a constant K2<br>
In case that only three speed levels are presented in the cursor positioning device, the terminal symbols A and B are combined together In this case, if the result in step F44 is no, the step F47 is performed to read the left count remained in the positive register V2X2+reg. If the value of K2*V2X2-reg is less than that of K3, the displacement of the cursor will be set to be proportional to that of the finger controllable member times a constant K2, and then the procedure flows to step F46 to avoid a situation that the cursor value exceeds over the display margin when the performing speed of the cursor positioning device exceeds that of the reference speed V2. This also avoid a problem that the cursor does not return to original position. If the result in step F47 is no, the step F48 is performed to judge whether the register V2X2+reg is larger than or equal to a maximum value If yes, the displacement of the cursor will be set to be proportional to that of the finger controllable member times a constant K1, if no, it indicates that the register V2X2+reg remains left value and the displacement of the finger controllable member in positive direction at the third speed level can be transferred and stored in the register V1X1+reg and V2X2+reg Then, in step F49, the procedure judges whether the amount of fine displacement in positive direction exceeds a half of the distance If no, step F46 is performed to set the displacement of the cursor proportional to the displacement of the finger controllable member times a constant K2, if yes, the procedure flows to<br>
17<br><br>
step F50, decreasing the value of V1Xl+reg , increasing the value of V1X1-reg, adding the value of V2X2+reg by 2, decreasing the value of V1X1-reg, and subtracting the value of V2X2-reg by 2 Under this procedure, when the finger controllable member is operating at the third speed level, the register VIXl+reg remains a value that is half of the constant C1 As result, when the cursor is moved to any position on the display, there are fine displacements always around the position where the cursor presents<br>
The speed parameter VX of the finger controllable member of Fig 15D is divided into three speed levels, le 0<vx v1 and vx>V2 Alternatively, the speed parameter VX may be divided into two speed levels, still remaining good performance described above and applicable to the most procedures of Fig 15D In this alternative embodiment, if the answer in step F41 is no, the step F47 is performed, neglecting steps F44 and F45 It means that the speed levels VI and V2 are set to be similar or the same value So, the second speed level will be neglected when the finger controllable member judges the value of VX It is also possible to detect the situation of the cursor positioning device such as key switch 13a shown in Figs 14, with amendment to the firmware In such a design, the user simply clicks the switch to enable the cursor positioning device operating at the first speed level If the user clicks the switch again, the cursor positioning device can operates at the third speed level In the third speed level, it is permitted to move the cursor on the display in fast moving operation mode Furthermore, the movement of the cursor on the display may be according to the velocity increment of the finger controlling element on a cursor area, namely, the velocity increment of said finger controlling element is used to substitute the velocity of said finger controlling element<br>
Fig 15E is a subprogram flow chart of the control program,explaining how the cursor is moved to the other direction, the control flow of which<br>
18<br><br>
is similar to that of Fig 15D may correctly return to original position correspondingly<br>
Fig 17A is a speed detecting procedure in positive direction, including various speed detecting subprograms The terminals A and B are connected to corresponding terminals A and B of Fig 15D In case that the result in step F44 is no, the procedure flows to step F61 of Fig 17A, if the result in step F61 is yes, the procedure flows to step F47 of Fig 15D. It is noted that the speed VX in positive direction uses the same control procedure at the third speed level, the forth speed level, and higher speed level In step F63, it detects whether the cursor is over the margin of the display If yes, the speed will be changed to a lower speed level to further judge whether the cursor is over the margin again The next step F64 is performed only until the cursor does not exceed the margin In step F64, it judges whether the register V2X2+reg is a maximum value If yes, the procedure returns to step F43, if no, the procedure flows to step 65 In step F65, it judges whether the register V1X1+-reg is larger than a half of the value C1. If no, the procedure flows to step 46, if yes, the procedure returns to step F66 At this time, the high speed value of the cursor poisoning device, for example at the third speed level or higher speed, is transferred into temporary values X2X2+ and V1X1+, and then storing the temporary values into the registers V2X2+reg and V1X1+reg respectively As result, the moving speed and positioning of the cursor on display may match that of the finger controllable member with advantage of smooth, fast, stable, and precise moving performance Fig 17B is a speed detecting procedure in negative direction, the control flow of which is similar to that of Fig 17A<br>
The Y-axis procedure is followed by the X-axis procedure, with similar control flow described above<br>
As shown in Fig 16, the process of said finger controlling element is terminated on the boundary, wherein the Xmax and Xmin generats ten<br><br>
interrupting signals per second, and subsequently, the Y axle mode is judge and then the process is restored<br>
