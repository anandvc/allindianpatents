				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PLATINUM COMPLEX.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of platinum complex. Particularly, the invention relates to platinum (II) based complex. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a platinum (II) complex of 1,2-diaminecyclohexane. Even more particularly, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a platinum (II) complex of general formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, the conformation of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane is cis, trans-1 or trans-d isomer and R1 and R2 combinedly make dicarboxylic acid having formulae II,III and IV,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, the two carboxylic acid groups are on the same or on vicinal carbon atoms, n<br>
is zero or an integer ranging from 1 to 5   and R3 is either H or a substituent with<br>
electron withdrawing or electron releasing effects exemplified by alkoxy, halo and nitro groups. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of a platinum (II) complex of 1,2-diaminecyclohexane of formula I as defined above using a source of silver ion selected from a silver compound containing divalent anion. Yet more particularly, the present invention provides a process that is cost effective, high yielding, easy to operate and industrially feasible while maintaining the quality of the title compound. Further, the title compound prepared by the process of the present invention contains reduced impurities (less than 0.1% oxalic acid), conforming to the standards laid down by European pharmacopoeia. Still more particularly, certain alternate optional routes for the main process as disclosed in the present invention results in the formation of intermediates, thereby making the process more advantageous. The platinum (II) complexes prepared by the process described and claimed in this invention are highly active antitumor agents with reduced impurities and thus are useful as active component of carcinostatic drugs.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A reference may be made to an unexamined published Japanese patent application No. JP 212497 and examined Japanese patent publication Nos. 66318 and 79353 reporting that a compound in which platinum is coordinated to 1,2-diamino cyclohexane has excellent antitumor effect and relatively high safety. These substances, however, have disadvantages in that their pharmacological effects and safety are not always satisfactory and their administration by injection are limited because of their low solubility in water.<br>
The first report on cis-oxalato-trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) known as oxaliplatin was published in the year 1976 (Y.Kidani et al.). The authors synthesised<br>
cis-dichloroplatinum(II) compounds with cis, trans-1 and trans-d isomers of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane as ligands and tested against either L-1210 or P-388 in CDF1 mice, The results showed the complex with trans-1 ligand highly active. The cis-platin administration causes number of side effects such as renal toxicity, blood toxicity, nervous toxicity and digestive organ toxicity. Inorder to decrease the toxicity of these complexes, they prepared the mixed ligand complexes with dicarboxylic acids. Since then a no. of patents have appeared for the synthesis of different platinum compounds including oxaliplatin.<br>
Conventionally, the compounds of formula I are prepared by following steps: reacting K2PtX4 (x is C1 or Br)with a 1,2-cyclohexanediamine isomer to form an intermediate<br>
cis-dihalol,2-diaminocyclohexane wherein, halo could be chloro or bromo; dissolving the intermediate thus obtained in water under boiling; adding thereto a solution of silver nitrate in an amount of twice the mol equivalent of the said intermediate compound; separating the resultant precipitate of silver chloride or bromide through filtration; and adding corresponding dibasic organic acid to the filtrate.<br>
However, the compounds of formula I obtained through the herein above-mentioned process contain dihydroxoplatinum complex as an impurity. Additionally the compounds thus prepared also contain other impurities such as unreacted intermediate, by-products of the said intermediate such as partially reacted chloroaquo, diaquodinitrate and unreacted silver ion thereby reducing the quality of the desired compound. One of the reasons of these impurities is low solubility of the intermediate in water. Further, because of high volume of water used in the reaction to take care of low solubility of the intermediate compound cis-dihalol, 2-diaminocyclohexane, the<br>
resulting precipitated silver chloride or bromide goes in to solution making it difficult if not impossible to remove the same completely.<br>
US Patent No. 5,585,511 describes a platinum complex, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be used for preparing injectable formulations for treating malignant tumour. The compound is prepared as follows: reacting 1,2-diaminecyclohexane platinum(II) complex with silver nitrate in an amount 1.8 to 2 moles per mole of the said platinum complex, then reacting the diaquo complex thus formed with carboxylic acid and alkali, the resulting nitrato compound, where only one nitrate group is replaced, is further treated with halide so as to replace nitrate by halo group. This is extension of conventional method there by getting water soluble value added compound.<br>
The prior art, as known to the inventor additionally includes US Patent No. 5,290,961. This patent describes a process that obviates the problems posed by the conventional process as mentioned herein above. The process advocates addition of sodium or potassium iodide to the reaction mixture, prior to the addition of organic dibasic acid, to convert the unreacted silver ion and cis-dihalol,2-diaminocyclohexane into their iodine compounds. On removal of these iodine compounds by simple filtration organic dibasic acid is added to obtain the title compound. The disadvantage is the requirement of large amount of water. Similarly nitrate being monovalent, the amount of silver nitrate required for the reaction will be on higher side.<br>
US Patent No. 5,939,133 teaches use of deoxygenated water in all steps and substituting nitrogen or an inert gas for air in an operational environment to produce low oxygen content atmosphere. Alternately degassing of an operational environment is proposed to eliminate the possibility of direct oxidation of platinum compound.<br>
This process requires stringent operational conditions thereby making a process cost intensive.<br>
Us Patent No. 5,420,319; 5,298,642 and 5,338,874 disclose oxaliplatin with high optical purity through optical resolution. According to the process of these inventions, the starting material is optically resoluted by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to the desired level and then reacted with tetrahalogen platinum (IV) and equimolar silver oxalate followed by reducing to the title compound. Alternately silver oxalate is substituted by silver nitrate or sulfate. Under these conditions the complex thus obtained is further reacted with oxalic acid to produce cis-oxalato(transl-l,2-cyclohexanediamine) Pt(II) complex.<br>
Very recently Debio Pharm S.A.has published a patent (Koji Okamoto et al, WO 03/004505) claiming the invention of oxaliplatin active substance with low oxalic acid content (not more than 0.08%) thereby obtaining a product with reduced toxicity. The process of this invention advocates preparing dichloro(trans-l-l,2-cyclohexanediamine)platinum(II) by reacting K.2Pt(II)Cl4 with trans-1-1,2-cyclohexanediamine, then adding 1.6 equivalents in respect to said compound, silver nitrate, then optionally adding potassium or sodium iodide and adding active carbon under stirring, filtering and treating the filtrate with alkali metal salt of oxalic acid. The crystalline oxaliplatin thus obtained is purified by washing repeatedly with water having pH between 4.5-7.0.<br>
This patent is modification of Us Patent NO. 5,290,961. The compound obtained has oxalic acid below detectable limits.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In consequence, it therefore becomes an object of the present invention to provide a process to prepare a platinum complex having excellent anti-tumor activity, equivalent safety and substantially free from impurities such as un-reacted intermediate i.e. platinum complex of 1,2-diaminocylohexane, by-products of the said intermediate like partially reacted chloroaquo, diaquodinitrate, oxalic acid (less than 0.1%) and un-reacted silver ion.<br>
Other object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a platinum (II) based compound, which can be employed as an active ingredient for preparing formulations having carcinostatic effects.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a platinum (II) complex of 1,2-diaminecyclohexane obviating the various drawbacks of the existing processes as described herein above.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of platinum (II) complex of general formula I as defined above.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a platinum (II) complex of 1,2-diaminecyclohexane of formula I as defined above using a source of silver ion selected from a silver compound containing divalent anion.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process that is cost effective, high yielding, efficient, easy to operate, do not require any stringent operational conditions or sophisticated infrastructure and industrially feasible while maintaining the quality of the title compound.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a process with certain alternate optional routes that involves formation of intermediates such as cis-diiodo-trans-1-1,2-diamino cyclohexane platinum (II) and cis-biscarboxylato- trans-1- 1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum (II) thereby making the process more advantageous.<br>
After continuous experimentation, it was observed that in the hitherto known processes, during the reaction between cis-dihalo 1,2-diaminocyclohexane and source of silver ion, when silver nitrate or sulfate are used as a source of silver ion, sulfate ions and nitrate ions react with the alkali metals present in dibasic organic acid resulting into nitrates or sulfates of alkali metal. During recovery of the title compound by removal of water, these salts remain in the title compound as an impurity. However, this problem is taken care of by using selective silver salt as a source of silver ion, in the process of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of the preparation of a platinum complex of general formula I<br>

The platinum (II) complex prepared by the process of the present invention also<br>

Further, the process, with which the current invention is concerned, is described below by schemes and text.<br>
Though the schemes are illustrated mainly by oxaliplatin, a representative of compound of formula I, the process of this invention is not intended to restrict to oxaliplatin. The schemes can equally be used for all other compounds of general formula I using corresponding variable reactants.<br>
SCHEMES<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Potassium tetrachloroplatinate is first converted to potassium tetraiodoplatinate by treatment with potassium iodide in water and subsequent addition of trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane to the above solution in 1:1 molar ratio at ambient temperature produces cis-diiodo-trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) as a yellow coloured solid. This is filtered, dried and subsequently used in the different synthetic schemes.<br>
Cis-dichloro-trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) (Structure-V, X = C1) is prepared (Example-2) by the method described in US Patent No. 5,290,961. The cis-bis carboxylato-trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) of formulaVI is prepared from the corresponding dihalo compound by treatment with the carboxylic acid in presence of silver ion. Cis-bissulphonato-trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) is prepared from the dihalo compound by treatment with sulphonic acid and a source of silver ion. These intermediates are subsequently converted to dicarboxylate platinum compounds by treatment with salts of dicarboxylic acids.<br>
SCHEME-I<br>
Potassium tetrachloroplatinate is converted to cis-dichloro-trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II). This is further converted to oxaliplatin and related compounds by reacting with dicarboxylic acid and silver oxide in water. The silver salts are filtered off and the filtrate treated with potassium iodide to remove silver ions as silver iodide. Water recovery followed by decolourisation with active carbon produces oxaliplatin.<br>
SCHEME-II<br>
This is a one-pot reaction involving all the reagents together. Cis-dihalo-trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) is formed in-situ which is converted to Platinum compounds (Structure-I) by reaction with the dicarboxylic acids and silver oxide present.<br>
SCHEME-III<br>
We report here the formation of diacetato as an intermediate which dissolves in the<br>
reaction medium. The silver chloride formed is filtered repeteadly till we get a clear<br>
filtrate. Dipotassium oxalate is added to convert it to oxaliplatin.<br>
Chelation is attributed to be the driving force for the conversion of diacetato to<br>
dicarboxylate which is energetically favoured. The intermediate formation of the<br>
diacetato has been proved by removing an aliquot, evaporating water and recording the<br>
mass spectrum.<br>
The solid diacetato obtained was independendly converted to oxaliplatin under the<br>
same experimental conditions.<br>
SCHEME-IV<br>
The diiodo compound produced as herein above described and supported by Example-1, as herein after illustrated, is converted to oxaliplatin as described in scheme-II.<br>
SCHEME-V<br>
The diiodo compound produced as herein after illustrated by Example-1, is converted to the diacetato compound by treatment with acetic acid and silver oxide as in scheme-Ill. The diacetato in solution, after removal of precipitated silver iodide is treated with dipotassium oxalate to give oxaliplatin.<br>
The less solubility of diiodo intermediate has been taken care of by converting it in to the diacetato and the filtration of silver iodide here does not give any trouble as in case of silver chloride. Silver iodide being highly insoluble, further treatment with sodium or potassium iodide is not required.<br>
SCHEME-VI<br>
The diiodide compound produced as herein after illustrated by Example-1 is converted to the disulphonato compound by treatment with silver oxide and methane sulphonic acid. The disulphonato compound in solution, after removal of precipitated silver iodide is treated with dipotassium oxalate to give oxaliplatin (Example-9).<br>
SCHEME-VII<br>
Cis-dichloro-trans-l-l,2-diarninocyclohexane platinum(II) produced as herein after illustrated by Example-2 is treated with silver oxide and methanesulphonic acid. The precipitated silver chloride is filtered off and the clear filtrate treated with dipotassium oxalate to produce oxaliplatin (Example-10).<br>
The clear filtrate obtained in example-9 was subjected to mass spectrophotometry. Mass Spectral analysis of cis-dimethanesulphonato-trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) As shown in figure-1 accompanying this specification showed a mixture of peaks corresponding to disulphonato (M+=500), Monosulphonato monoaquo (M+=422), diaquo derivative (M+=344) and  sodiated, H20 adducts along with some transient species. Each m/z group was comprised of several mass values corresponding to the major platinum isotopes 194Pt, 195Pt, 196Pt and 198Pt. Proposed structures for observed   molecular weights given in Table 1. The pathway for the formation of oxaliplatin is shown in scheme- VIII.<br>
SCHEME-VIII<br>
TABLE 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The intermediates of formulae V (X= I) and VI are integral in the preparation of the title compound hence, they will be claimed as a part of this invention. The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the process of the present invention. Any modification, which is obvious to a person skilled in the art and working in this field, may fall within the scope of the present invention. Further, although a process of preparing oxaliplatin as a representative of Platinum (II) based complex of formula I will be illustrated, the examples do not intend to restrict the present invention to oxaliplatin.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
HPLC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu HPLC with isocratic mobile phase of flow 1 ml/min equipped with a C-18 column, 5u, 4.6x 250 mm and UV-Vis detector at 220nm. The mobile phase in case of conversion of cis-dichloro-trans-l-l,2-diamino cyclohexane platinum(II) to oxaliplatin was pure buffer containing 0.134% of disodium hydrogen orthophosphate and 0.069% of sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate (System-A). The mobile phase in case of conversion of cis-diiodo-trans-1-1,2-diaminocyclohexane Platinum(II) to cis-diacetato-trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane platinum(II) consists of 15% acetonitrile and 85% buffer containing 0.175% of tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydrogen sulphate (system-B). The mobile phase for the conversion of diacetato to oxaliplatin is carried out using system-A.* Mass spectra were recorded using Trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane was procured from Acros Organics and was used as such without further purification.<br>
