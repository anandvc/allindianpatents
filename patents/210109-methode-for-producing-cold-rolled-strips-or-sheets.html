				<td>Method for producing cold-rolled strips or sheets<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing cold-rolled strips or sheets out of low-alloyed steels with a respective max. 0.2% of C, P, Al, Ti, V, Nb, S, B and a respective max. 1% Si and Mn, remainder iron and unavoidable impurities. After being melted, the steel is cast into slabs, thin slabs or strips, generally in a continuous casting procedure, and then hot-rolled, cold-rolled and subjected to recrystallizing annealing.<br>
The annealing temperature level required for a complete recrystallization of the cold-rolled strip or sheet can be influenced in the preliminary stages of strip steel production. For example, it is known that the recrystallization temperature can be reduced via a high hot-strip coiling temperature and a high cold-rolling ration.<br>
The object of the invention is to reduce the production outlay and associated manufacturing costs for generating a completely recrystallized, cold-rolled strip or sheet.<br>
To achieve this object, the invention proposes that, in the generic procedure, the slabs or strips be hot-rolled at an initial temperature exceeding 1,100°C and a final temperature lying under Ar3, the hot strip be coiled at a temperature lying below 650°C, and the cold strip then be cold-rolled at a temperature which is nearly independent of the cold rolling ratio and as low as possible ranging from 500 to 750°C for a time sufficient to ensure complete recrystallization.<br><br>
-2-<br>
The invention is based on the surprising determination that by the use of a reduced hot-roll final temperature and a low coiling temperature a complete recrystallisation of the cold-rolled strip can be obtained at a comparatively low temperature nearly independently of the cold rolling strain. A low temperature for recrystallization annealing saves energy and costs.<br>
In addition to the alloy contents specified above, the steels may contain 0.01% of nitrogen and the quantity of boron (&gt; 0.78 x N) required for nitrogen fixation. Beyond that, slight quantities of other alloying elements that have no negative impact on the recrystallization conditions are also permissible.<br>
If possible, the hot-roll final temperature should lie 50<br>
°C under Ar3, and the coiling temperature should preferably range from 300 to 600°C. IF-steels with a low carbon content of up to 0.01% or steels micro-alloyed with Ti, V, Nb can be completely recrystallization annealed in a temperature range of 600 to 780°C, while non-micro-alloyed steels can be completely recrystallization annealed at even lower temperatures ranging from 500 to 680°C, largely independently of the cold rolling level.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail based on five examples.<br>
Table 1 shows the chemical compositions of four deep-drawing steels A to D. Figures 1 to 5 each show the hot-roll and annealing conditions.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The curve progressions show that by combining a low hot-roll final temperature and a low coiling temperature in accordance with the invention, cold-rolled strip or sheet, examples A4 to C4, the recrystallization temperature in a a continuous casting installation (Fig. 1 and 2) as well as  in a bath annealing installation (Fig. 3 to 5) can greatly be reduced, especially at a low cold-rolling level of 30 to 50%, relative to material of the same composition that was processed at a higher hot-roll final temperature and coiling temperature.<br><br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.   Method for producing cold-rolled strips or sheets, in<br>
which a low-alloyed steel with a respective max. 0.2%<br>
of C, Al, Ti, V, Nb and a respective max. 1% Si and Mn, and the quantity of boron (&gt; 0.78 x N) required for<br>
N-setting, remainder iron and unavoidable contaminants, are melted and cast into slabs, thin slabs or strips, wherein the slabs, thin slabs or strips are hot-rolled at an initial temperature exceeding 1,100°C and a final temperature lying under Ar3, and the obtained hot strip is then coiled at a temperature of less than 650°C and cold-rolled at cold-rolling ratios of at most 5<br>
0%, whereupon the obtained cold strip is annealed for a time sufficient for complete recrystallization at a temperature ranging from 520 to 780°C which is independent of the cold rolling level and as low as possible depending on steel composition.<br>
2.	Method according to claim 1, characterized in that cold rolling takes place at cold-rolling ratios of between 30% and 50%.<br>
3.	Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that during cold rolling the strip is subjected to one or<br>
more intermediate annealings between the cold-rolling steps.<br>
4.	Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, applied to<br>
steels with 
 <br>
-6-<br>
steels with any C content and micro-alloy elements, in which recrystallization annealing takes place in a continuous annealing installation at, a temperature ranging from 700 to 780°C.<br>
5.	Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, applied to steels with more than 0.1% C and free of micro-alloys, in which recrystallization annealing takes place in a continuous annealing installation at a temperature ranging from 600 to 680°C.<br>
6.	Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, applied to steels with 
7.	Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, applied to steels with more than 0.1% C and free of micro-alloys, in which recrystallization annealing takes place in a batch annealing installation at a temperature ranging from 520 to 600°C.<br>
