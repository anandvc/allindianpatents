				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL BENZIMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is useful in medical fields. In<br>
more detail, novel benzimidazole derivatives of the present<br>
invention have an effect as neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists<br>
and are useful as agents for the treatment of various kinds of<br>
cardiovascular disorders, central nervous system disorders,<br>
metabolic diseases and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Neuropeptide Y (hereinafter referred to as NPY), a<br>
peptide consisting of 36 amino acids, was first isolated from<br>
porcine brain by Tatemoto et al in 1982 (NATURE, vol. 296, p.<br>
659(1982)). NPY is widely distributed in central nervous<br>
system and peripheral nervous system, and plays various roles<br>
as one of the most abundant peptides in the nervous system. That<br>
is, NPY acts as an orexigenic substance in the central nervous<br>
system and markedly promotes fat accumulation via the mediation<br>
of secretion of various hormones or the action of the nervous<br>
system. It is known that continuous intracerebroventricular<br>
administration of NPY induces obesity and insulin resistance<br>
due to these actions (INTERNATIONAL JOUNAL OF OBESITY, vol.19,<br>
p.517(1995); Endocrinology, vol.133, p.1753(1993)). It is<br>
also known that NPY has central actions such as depression,<br>
anxiety, schizophrenia, pain, dementia, circadian rhythm<br>
control and the like (DRUGS, vol.52, p.371(1996); THE JOURNAL<br><br>
OF NEUROSCIENCE, vol.18, p.3014(1998)) . Furthermore, in the<br>
periphery, NPY coexists with norepinephrine in<br>
sympathetic-nerve terminals and is related to the tonicity of<br>
the sympathetic nervous system. It is known that peripheral<br>
administration of NPY causes vasoconstriction and enhances the<br>
activities of other vasoconstrictive substances such as<br>
norepinephrine (BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY, vol.95,<br>
p.419(1988)). It is also reported that NPY could participate<br>
in the development of cardiac hypertrophy as a result of the<br>
sympathetic stimulation (PROCEEDING NATIONAL ACADEMIC SCIENCE<br>
USA, vol.97, p.1595(2000)) .<br>
On the other hand, it is reported that NPY is also involved<br>
in the secretory function of sexual hormones and growth hormone,<br>
sexual behavior and reproductive function, gastro-intestinal<br>
motility, bronchoconstriction, inflammation and alcohol<br>
preference (LIFE SCIENCE, vol.55, p.551(1994); THE JOURNAL OF<br>
ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY, vol.101, p.S345(1998); NATURE, vol.396,<br>
p.366(1998)).<br>
NPY has a variety of pharmacological effects resulting<br>
from NPY binding to the NPY receptors, to some of which other<br>
NPY related peptides including peptide YY and pancreatic<br>
polypeptide also bind. It is known that these pharmacological<br>
effects of NPY are mediated by the action of at least five<br>
receptors with or without synergistic interactions (TRENDS IN<br>
NEUROSCIENCE, vol.20, p.294(1997)).<br>
It is reported that the central effects mediated by NPY<br>
Yl receptor include remarkable orexigenic effect<br>
(ENDOCRINOLOGY, vol.137, p.3177(1996); ENDOCRINOLOGY, vol.141,<br>
p.1011(2000)). Further, NPY Yl receptor is reported to be<br><br>
involved in anxiety and pain (NATURE, vol.259, p.528(1993);<br>
BRAIN RESEARCH, vol.859, p.361(2000). In addition, the pressor<br>
effect mediated by the strong vasoconstrictor action in the<br>
periphery is also reported (FEBS LETTERS, vol.362, p.192(1995);<br>
NATURE MEDICINE, vol.4, p.722(1998)).<br>
It is known that the effects mediated by NPY Y2 receptor<br>
include an inhibitory effect on the release of various<br>
neurotransmitters in the sympathetic nerve endings (BRITISH<br>
JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY, vol.102, p.41(1991); SYNAPSE, vol.2,<br>
p.299(1988)). In periphery, NPY Y2 causes constriction of blood<br>
vessel or vas deferens directly or via the control of release<br>
of various neurotransmitters (THE JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND<br>
EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS, vol.261, p.863(1992); BRITISH<br>
JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY, vol.100, p.190(1990)). Inhibition of<br>
lipolysis in adipose tissues is also known (ENDOCRINOLOGY,<br>
vol.131, p.1970(1992)) . Further, inhibition of ion secretion<br>
in the gastro-intestinal tract is reported (BRITISH JOURNAL OF<br>
PHARMACOLOGY, vol.101, p.247(1990)) . On the other hand, the<br>
effect on the central nervous system functions such as memory,<br>
anxiety and the like are also known. (BRAIN RESEARCH, vol.503,<br>
p.73(1989); PEPTIDES, vol.19, p.359(1998)).<br>
It is reported that NPY Y3 receptor exists mainly in<br>
brainstem and heart and is related to the regulation of blood<br>
pressure and heart rate (THE JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND<br>
EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS, vol.258, p.633(1991); PEPTIDES,<br>
vol.11, p. 545(1990)) . It is also known that NPY Y3 is involved<br>
in the control of catecholamine secretion in adrenal gland (THE<br>
JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS, vol. 244 ,<br>
p.468(1988); LIFE SCIENCE, vol.50, p.PL7(1992)).<br><br>
NPY Y4 receptor has high affinity for pancreatic<br>
polypeptide in particular. As for the pharmacological effects<br>
of NPY Y4, inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion and<br>
gastro-intestinal motility is reported (GASTROENTEROLOGY,<br>
vol.85, p.1411(1983)). Further, it is reported that NPY<br>
enhances the secretion of sexual hormones in the central nervous<br>
system (ENDOCRINOLOGY, vol.140, p.5171(1999)).<br>
As for the effects mediated by NPY Y5 receptor, fat<br>
accumulation effects including orexigenic effect are prominent<br>
(NATURE, vol. 382, p.168(1996); AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY,<br>
vol.277, p.R1428(1999)) . It is also reported that the NPY Y5<br>
receptor mediates some CNS effects, such as seizure and epilepsy,<br>
or pain and morphine withdrawal symptoms, and the control of<br>
circadian rhythm (NATURE MEDICINE, vol.3,<br>
p. 761 (1997 ); PROCEEDING NATIONAL ACADEMIC SCIENCE USA, vol.96,<br>
p.13518(1999); THE JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL<br>
THERAPEUTICS. vol.284, p.633(1998); THE JOURNAL OF<br>
NEUROSCIENCE, vol.21, p.5367(2001). In addition, diuresis<br>
effect and hypoglicemic effect in the periphery are reported<br>
(BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY, vol. 120, p.1335(1998);<br>
ENDOCRINOLOGY, vol.139, p.3018(1998)). NPY is also reported<br>
to enhance cardiac hypertrophy as a result of the sympathetic<br>
accentuation (PROCEEDING NATIONAL ACADEMIC SCIENCE USA, vol.97,<br>
p.1595 (2000)).<br>
The effects of NPY are expressed when NPY binds to the<br>
NPY receptors in the central or peripheral nervous system.<br>
Therefore, the action of NPY can be prevented by blocking its<br>
binding to NPY receptors. For this reason, it is expected that<br>
substances antagonize NPY binding to NPY receptors may be useful<br><br>
for the prophylaxis or treatment of various diseases related<br>
to NPY, for example cardiovascular disorders such as angina,<br>
acute or congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,<br>
hypertension, nephropathy, electrolyte abnormality, vasospasm,<br>
atherosclerosis, etc., central nervous system disorders such<br>
as bulimia, depression, anxiety, seizure, epilepsy, dementia,<br>
pain, alcoholism, drug withdrawal, circadian rhythm disorders,<br>
schizophrenia, memory impairment, sleep disorders, cognitive<br>
impairment, etc. , metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes,<br>
hormone abnormality, gout, fatty liver, etc., genital or<br>
reproductive disorders such as infertility, preterm labor,<br>
sexual dysfunction, etc., gastro-intestinal disorders,<br>
respiratory disorder, inflammatory diseases or glaucoma, and<br>
the like. (TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCE, vol.15,<br>
p.153(1994); LIFE SCIENCE, vol.55, p.551(1994); DRUGS, vol.52,<br>
p.371(1996); THE JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY, vol.101,<br>
p.S345(1998); NATURE, vol.396, p.366(1998); THE JOURNAL OF<br>

It was recently found that, as a result of the study by<br>
the present inventors, a certain NPY receptor antagonist is<br>
useful for the prophylaxis or treatment of hypercholesterolemia,<br>
hyperlipidemia and arteriosclerosis (International<br>
application publication W099/27965).<br>
International application publication WO00/27845 and<br><br>
WO01/14376 disclose a variety of carboxamide derivatives, and<br>
mention that said derivatives have excellent NPY receptor<br>
antagonistic activities. International application<br>
publication WO02/48152 discloses a variety of<br>
spiro(isobenzofuran-l,4'-piperidine)-3-on derivatives, and<br>
mentions that said derivatives have an effect to regulate the<br>
NPY binding to NPY5 receptors. However, none of the above<br>
international publications describes the compounds of the<br>
present invention.<br>

methanesulfonyl, ethanesulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl), organic<br>
sulfonyloxy	(e.g.	methanesulfonyloxy,<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy, p-toluenesulfonyloxy) and the<br>
like.<br>
The present process refers to a process for preparing a<br>
compound of the formula (I) wherein E is nitrogen, namely a<br>
compound of the formula (I-1).<br>
In the above reaction, when a react ant has an amino, imino,<br>
hydroxy, carboxyl, carbonyl or the like which does not<br>
participate in the reaction, the reaction may be carried out<br>
after protecting the amino, imino, hydroxy, carboxyl, carbonyl<br>

group, a carboxyl-protecting group, or a carbonyl-protecting<br>
group, followed by deprotection after completion of the<br>
reaction.<br><br>
The "amino- or imino-protecting group" is not<br>
particularly restricted, so long as it has such protective<br>
function. There are employed, for example, aralkyl (e.g.<br>
benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, o-nitrobenzyl,<br>
p-nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl, trityl); lower alkanoyl (e.g.<br>

tert-butoxycarbonyl,	trimethylsilylethoxymethyl,<br>
methylsulfonyl and the like.<br>
The "hydroxy-protecting group" is not particularly<br>
restricted, so long as it has such protective function for<br>
hydroxy groups. There are employed, for example, lower alkyl<br>
(e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl); lower<br>
alkylsilyl (e.g. trimethyl silyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl);<br>
lower alkoxymethyl (e.g. methoxymethyl, 2-methoxy-<br>
ethoxymethyl);	tetrahydropyranyl;<br>
trimethylsilylethoxymethyl; aralkyl (e.g. benzyl,<br>
p-methoxybenzyl, 2,3-dimethoxybenzyl, o-nitrobenzyl,<br>
p-nitrobenzyl, trityl); and acyl (e.g. formyl, acetyl), among<br>
which the particularly preferred are methyl, methoxymethyl.<br><br>
tetrahydropyranyl, trityl, trimethylsilylethoxymethyl,<br>
tert-butyldimethylsilyl, acetyl and the like.<br>
The "carboxyl- protecting group" is not particularly<br>
restricted, so long as it has such protective function for<br>
carboxyl groups. There are employed, for example, lower alkyl<br>
(e.g. methyl. ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl);<br>
halo-lower alkyl (e.g. 2,2,2-trichloroethyl); lower alkenyl<br>
(e.g. 2-propenyl); aralkyl (e.g. benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl,<br>
p-nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl, trityl) and the like, among which<br>
the particularly preferred are methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl,<br>
2-propenyl, benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl or benzhydryl and the like.<br>
The "carbonyl-protecting group" is not particularly<br>
limited, so long as it has such protective function for carbonyl<br>
groups. There are employed, for example, acetals or ketals,<br>
such as ethylene ketal, trimethylene ketal, and dimethyl ketal<br>
and the like.<br>
The reaction between a compound of the formula (II) and<br>
a compound of the formula (III) is usually carried out by<br>
employing an equivalent to excessive mole, preferably an<br>
equivalent to 1.5 moles, of compound (III), relative to 1 mole<br>
of compound (II).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in an inert solvent.<br>
Preferable examples of such solvent are methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like, or a<br>
mixture thereof and the like.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence<br>
of a base such as organic bases (e.g.triethylamine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine),<br><br>
inorganic bases (e.g. sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide) and the like.<br>
The base is used in equimolar amount or in excess mole,<br>
preferably 1 to 5 moles, relative to 1 mole of the compound of<br>
the formula (II).<br>
The reaction temperature is usually from 0°C to 200°C,<br>
preferably 20°C to 150°C.<br>
The reaction time is usually 5 minutes to 7 days,<br>
preferably 30 minutes to 24 hours.<br>
A usual treatment is carried out after completion of the<br>
reaction to obtain a crude product of a compound of the formula<br>
(IV-1). The resulting compound of the formula (IV-1) is, with<br>
or without purification according to the common method,<br>
subjected to optional removal of the protecting group for the<br>
amino, hydroxy, carboxyl, carbonyl or the like, thereby a<br>
compound of the formula (1-1) can be prepared.<br>
Although the method for the removal of said protecting<br>
groups depends upon the kinds of the protecting groups, the<br>
stability of a desired compound (1-1) and the like, it is carried<br>
out by, for example, a solvolysis using an acid or a base, that<br>
is, a method wherein for example 0.01 mole to a large excess<br>
of acid, preferably trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid and the like, or an equivalent mole to a large<br>
excess of base, preferably potassium hydroxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide and the like is acted; a chemical reduction using a<br>
metal hydride complex; or a catalytic reduction using a<br>
palladium-carbon catalytst, a Raney-nickel catalyst, etc. ; and<br>
the like, according to, for example, a method described in the<br><br>
literature (Protective Groups inorganic Synthesis, T.W.Greene,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, (1981)) or its similar method.<br>
The oxidation of a nitrogen atom may be carried out by<br>
using of an oxydizing agent (for example m-chloroperbenzoic<br>
acid, dioxirane, sodium periodate and hydrogen peroxide).<br>
Reaction between a compound of the general formula (IV-1) and<br>
an oxydizing agent is usually carried out by employing 0.5 mole<br>
to excessive moles, preferably 1 mole to 5 moles of the oxydizing<br>
agent based on 1 mole of compound (IV-1).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in an appropriate<br>
solvent which depend on the oxydizing agent used in the reaction.<br>
Preferable examples of the solvent include methylene chloride<br>
and chloroform for m-chloroperbenzoic acid, acetone and water<br>
for dioxirane.<br>
Reaction temperature is usually -50 °C to 100 °C,<br>
preferably -20 °C to 50 °C.<br>
Reaction time is usually 15 minutes to 7 days, preferably<br>
30 minutes to 24 hours.<br>
Production Process 2<br>
A compound of the formula (1-2) or N-oxide derivative<br>
thereof:<br><br>
(wherein A, B, C, D, n, R°, T, U, V, W, X and Y have each the<br>
same meaning as defined above) can be prepared by reacting a<br><br>
compound of the formula (V):<br><br>
(wherein a, b, c and d have each the same meaning as defined<br>
above) or its salt with a compound of the formula (VI):<br><br>
(wherein R0p is hydrogen or optionally protected hydroxy; n,<br>
t, u, v, w, X and Y have each the same meaning as defined above)<br>
or its salt to give a compound of the formula (VII):<br><br>
(wherein a, b, c, d, n, R0p, t, u, v, w, X and Y have each the<br>
same meaning as defined above), followed by subjecting the<br>
compound (VII) to intramolecular dehydrative ring closure to<br>
give a compound of the formula (VIII):<br><br>
(wherein a, b, c, d, n, R0p, t, u, v, w, X and Y have each the<br><br>
same meaning as defined above), and optionally removing<br>
wherefrom the protecting group(s) and/or oxidizing nitrogen<br>
atom(s) of the compound (VIII).<br>
The present process refers to a process for preparing a<br>
compound of the formula (I) wherein E is methine or hydroxy<br>
substituted methine, namely a compound of the formula (1-2).<br>
The reaction between a compound of the formula (V) and<br>
a carboxylic acid of the formula (VI) is usually carried out<br>
by employing 0.5 moles to excessive mole, preferably 1 mole to<br>
1.5 moles of the carboxylic acid (VI), relative to 1 mole of<br>
a compound of the formula (V).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in an inert solvent.<br>
Preferable examples of such solvent are methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyformamide, pyridine and<br>
the like, and a mixture thereof and the like.<br>

hexafluorophosphate, bromotris(dimethylamino)phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate, diphenylphosphoric azide,<br>
1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole and the like.<br>
Such condensing agent can be usually used in 1 mole to<br>
excess moles, preferably 1 to 1.5 moles, relative to 1 mole of<br>
a compound of the formula (VI).<br><br>
The reaction temperature is usually from -50°C to 100°C,<br>
preferably -20°C to 50°C.<br>
The reaction time is usually 30 minutes to 7 days,<br>
preferably 1 to 24 hours.<br>
In place of the carboxylic acid of the formula (VI), an<br>
activated derivative of said carboxylic acid may be reacted<br>
with a compound of the formula (V) , thereby a compound of the<br>
formula (1-2) can be prepared.<br>
Examples of such activated derivatives of the carboxylic<br>
acid of the formula (VI) are acid halides, mixed anhydrides,<br>
active esters, active amides and the like.<br>
The acid halides of the carboxylic acid of the formula<br>

The utility of compounds of the present invention as a<br>
medicament is proved by the following pharmacological tests.<br>
Pharmacological Test 1 (NPY binding inhibition test)<br>
cDNA sequence encoding human NPY Y5 receptor (c.f.<br>
International patent publication number W096/16542) was cloned<br>
into expression vectors pcDNA3, pRc/RSV (made by Invitrogen<br>
Inc.) and pCI-neo (made by Promega Inc.). The expression<br>
vectors thus obtained were transfected to host cells COS-7, CHO<br>
and LM(tk-) (American Type Culture Collection) by cationic<br>
lipid method (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<br>
of the United States of America, 84: 7413(1987)) to give NPY<br>
Y5 receptor expression cells.<br><br>
A membrane sample prepared from the cells which expressed<br>
NPY Y5 receptor was incubated together with a test compound and<br>
[125I]peptideYY (made by NEN) (20,000cpm) in an assay buffer (25<br>
mM Tris buffer, pH7.4, containing 10 mM magnesium chloride, 1<br>
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% bacitracin and 0.5%<br>
bovine serum albumin) at 25° C for 2 hours, then filtered through<br>
a glass filter GF/C and washed with 5 mM Tris buffer (pH7.4)<br>
containing 0.3% BSA. The radioactivity of the cake on the glass<br>
filter was measured. Non-specific binding was measured in the<br>
presence of 1 \iM peptide YY, and a 50% Inhibitory Concentration<br>
(IC50) of the test compound against specific peptideYY binding<br>
was determined (Endocrinology, 131: 2090(1992)). The results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
As shown above, the compounds of this invention potently<br>
inhibited peptideYY (NPY homologue) binding to NPY Y5<br>
receptors.<br>
Pharmacological Test 2	(Antagonistic effect on<br>
D-Trp34NPY-induced feeding behavior)<br>
A chronic guide cannula (26 gauge, length 11 mm) was<br>
inserted stereotaxicly into the third cerebral ventricle of<br>
male SD rats (7-8 weeks old, 200-300g) anesthetized with<br>
ketamine/xylazine (single intraperitoneal administration of<br><br>
74 and 11 mg/kg) and fixed by dental resin. The top of the guide<br>
cannula was located 2.2mm behind bregma, and 8 mm depth from<br>
the skull surface on the median line. After about 1-week<br>
recovery period, D-Trp34NPY (lng/0.4[iL/head, synthetic<br>
cerebrospinal fluid containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin) was<br>
injected into the third ventricle. A test compound suspended<br>
in 0. 5% aqueous methylcellulose was administered orally 2 hours<br>
before the administration of D-Trp34NPY, and the food<br>
consumption was measured 2 hours after the administration of<br>
D-Trp34NPY.<br>
The results revealed that 10 mg/kg of the compound of this<br>
invention significantly suppressed the increase in food<br>
consumption induced by D-Trp34NPY (NPY homologue) which was<br>
administered to the third ventricle.<br>
Pharmacological Test 3 (Pharmacokinetics test)<br>
A test compound was orally or intravenously administered<br>
to male SD rats (7-10 weeks old, 200-400g) which abstained from<br>
food overnight. About 100 pL of blood was collected from the<br>
tail vein at predetermined time, using a heparinized capillary.<br>
The blood was centrifuged (4°C, 6,000 r.p.m., 10 minutes) to<br>
collect the plasma, to which was added 3-fold amount of ethanol<br>
containing an internal standard. The mixture was stirred,<br>
allowed to stand at -20°C for 20 minutes, and then centrifuged<br>
(4°C, 10,000 r.p.m. , 10 minutes). The supernatant was analyzed<br>
by LC/MS/MS, and the concentration of the test compound in the<br>
plasma was measured using a relative calibration curve.<br>
The results revealed that the bioavailability of the<br>
compound of Example 6 was 78% and its half-life in the blood<br><br>
was 3.0 hours.<br>
Pharmacological Test 4 (Brain/cerebrospinal fluid transport<br>
test)<br>
A test compound was orally or intravenously administered<br>
to male SD rats (7-10 weeks old, 200-400g), and whole blood was<br>
collected from the abdominal aorta of said rats anesthetized<br>
with ether at predetermined time, using a heparin-treated<br>
syringe. Then, the head skin was cut open, and a dental 30G<br>
needle was inserted between the cervical vertebrae, and it was<br>
further inserted into the cavum subarachnoideale. After 50 to<br>
100 μL cerebrospinal fluid had been collected by a 1 ml-syringe<br>
through a tube connected to said dental 30G needle, the brain<br>
was extracted. The blood sample was centrifuged (4°C, 6,000<br>
r.p.m., 10 minutes) to collect the plasma, to which was added<br>
3-fold amount of ethanol containing an internal standard, and<br>
the mixture was stirred. The brain sample was homogenized after<br>
addition of 2 ml water, an aliquot of the homogenate was taken<br>
and 3-fold amount of ethanol containing an internal standard<br>
was added thereto and stirred. The cerebrospinal fluid was<br>
stirred after adding 3-fold amount of ethanol containing an<br>
internal standard. The samples thus obtained were allowed to<br>
stand at -20°C for 20 minutes, and then centrifuged (4°C, 12,000<br>
g, 10 minutes) . The supernatant was analyzed by LC/MS/MS, and<br>
the concentration of the test compound in the plasma, brain,<br>
and cerebrospinal fluid were measured by the method using a<br>
relative calibration curve.<br>
The results revealed that concentrations of the compound<br>
of Example 6 in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were<br><br>
1.10 nmol/g, 0.033 μM and 2.77 μM respectively, 2 hours after<br>
oral administration (10 mg/kg).<br>

the sex, age, body weight, the degree of symptoms and the kind<br>
and range of the desired treatment effects.<br>
An ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian or<br>
clinician can readily determine and prescribe the effective<br>
amount of the drug required to prevent, suppress or arrest the<br>
progress of diseases.<br>
All the said preparations may contain 1.0 to 100 wt.%,<br>
preferably 1.0 to 60 wt.% of compounds of this invention and<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be used in<br>
combination with other agents useful for treating metabolic<br>
disorders and/or eating disorders. The individual component<br>
of such combinations can be administered separately at<br>
different times or concurrently in divided or single<br>
combination forms during the course of therapy. The instant<br>
invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such<br>
regimes of simultaneous or divided administration and the term<br>
"administering" is to be interpreted accordingly. The scope<br>
of combinations of the compounds of this invention with other<br>
agents useful for treating metabolic disorders and/or eating<br><br>
disorders includes in principle any combination of any<br>
pharmaceutical composition useful for treating metabolic<br>
disorders and/or eating disorders.<br>
Diabetes is caused by multiple factors and is most simply<br>
characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose<br>
(hyperglycemia) in the fasting state. There are two generally<br>
recognized forms of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, or<br>
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), in which patients<br>
produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates<br>
glucose utilization, and type 2 diabetes, or<br>
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), wherein<br>
patients produce insulin and even exhibit hyperinsulinemia<br>
(plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated in<br>
comparison with non-diabetic subjects), while at the same time<br>
demonstrating hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes is typically<br>
treated with exogenous insulin administered via injection.<br>
However, type 2 diabetics often develop "insulin resistance",<br>
such that the effect of insulin in stimulating glucose and lipid<br>
metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, namely,<br>
muscle, liver and adipose tissues, is diminished. Patients who<br>
are insulin resistant but not diabetic have elevated insulin<br>
levels that compensate for their insulin resistance, so that<br>
serum glucose levels are not elevated. In patients with NIDDM,<br>
the plasma insulin levels, even when they are elevated, are<br>
insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance,<br>
resulting in hyperglycemia.<br>
Insulin resistance is primarily due to a receptor binding<br>
defect that is not yet completely understood. Resistance to<br>
insulin results in insufficient activation of glucose uptake.<br><br>
diminished oxidation of glucose and storage of glycogen in<br>
muscle, inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose<br>
tissue and inadequate glucose production and secretion by the<br>
liver.<br>
The persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia that occurs<br>
in diabetics is associated with increased morbidity and<br>
premature mortality. Type 2 diabetics are at increased risk<br>
of developing cardiovascular complications, e.g.,<br>
atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral<br>
vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy and<br>
retinopathy.<br>
Non-insulin dependent diabetes is also associated with<br>
cardiac hypertrophy, in particular left ventricular<br>
hypertrophy (Devereux, R. B. , Circulation, 101:2271-2276<br>
(2000)). Cardiac hypertrophy, such as left ventricular<br>
hypertrophy, is due to the response of the heart to chronic<br>
pressure or volume overload. Left ventricular hypertrophy<br>
(LVH) is characterized by thickening of the left ventricular<br>
wall, including increased left ventricular mass and increased<br>
left ventricular wall thickness, and is defined as a left<br>
ventricular mass index exceeding 131 g/m2 of the body surface<br>
area in men, and 100 g/m2 in women (Savage et al., The Framingham<br>
Study, Circulation, 75 (1 Pt 2): 26-33 (1987).<br>
Left ventricular hypertrophy is independently associated<br>
with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, such as<br>
congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease,<br>
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, sudden death, and<br>
stroke. Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy has been<br>
associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk. It has also<br><br>
been found that the incidence of morbid events in patients with<br>
progression of left ventricular hypertrophy is greater than in<br>
patients with regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.<br>
Current treatments for hypertrophy include<br>
non-pharmacological interventions, such as weight reduction,<br>
sodium restriction, and aerobic physical exercise can reduce<br>
left ventricular mass (Ghali, J.K. et al. , American Journal of<br>
Geriatric Cardiology, 6:38-49 (1997).<br>
Many patients who have insulin resistance but have not<br>
yet developed type 2 diabetes are also at a risk of developing<br>
metabolic syndrome, also referred to as syndrome X, insulin<br>
resistance syndrome, or plurimetabolic syndrome. The period<br>
of 5 to 10 years preceding the development of impaired glucose<br>
tolerance is associated with a number of hormonal imbalances,<br>
which give rise to an enlargement of visceral fat mass,<br>
hypertension, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia<br>
(Bjornstop, P., Current Topics in Diabetes Research, eds.<br>
Belfore, F., Bergman, R. N. , andMolinath, G. M., Front Diabetes,<br>
Basel, Karger, 12:182-192 (1993)). Similarly, metabolic<br>
syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance, along with<br>
abdominal obesity, hyperinsulinemia, high blood pressure, low<br>
HDL and high VLDL. Although the causal relationship between<br>
the various components of metabolic syndrome remains to be<br>
confirmed, insulin resistance appears to play an important role<br>
(Requen, G.M., et al., N. Eng. J. Med. 334:374-381 (1996);<br>
Despres, J-P., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 334:952-957 (1996);<br>
Wajchenberg, B. L., et al.. Diabetes /Metabolism Rev. 10:19-29<br>
(1994)). Metabolic syndrome patients, whether or not they<br>
develop overt diabetes mellitus, are at increased risk of<br><br>
developing the cardiovascular complications listed above.<br>
Associations have also been found between left ventricular<br>
hypertrophy and metabolic syndrome (Marcus, R. et al.<br>
Circulation, 90:928-936 (1994); Lind, L. et al. . J Hypertens.<br>
13:433-38 (1995); Paolisso, G et al.. Am J Hypertens.,<br>
10:1250-1256 (1997).<br>
Diabetes is treated with a variety of therapeutic agents<br>
including insulin sensitizers, such as PPARy agonists, such as<br>
glitazones; biguanides; protein tyrosine phosphatase-IB<br>
inhibitors; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors; insulin;<br>
insulin mimetics; sulfonylureas; meglitinides; a-glucoside<br>
hydrolase inhibitors; and a-amylase inhibitors.<br>
Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration<br>
of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or<br>
meglitinides, which stimulate the pancreatic (5-cells to secrete<br>
more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas<br>
or meglitinides become ineffective, can result in insulin<br>
concentrations high enough to stimulate insulin-resistant<br>
tissues . However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can<br>
result, and increasing insulin resistance due to the even higher<br>
plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides increase<br>
insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of<br>
hyperglycemia. Metformin monotherapy is often used for<br>
treating type 2 diabetic patients who are also obese and/or<br>
dyslipidemic. Lack of appropriate response to metformin is<br>
often followed by treatment with sulfonylureas,<br>
thiazolidinediones, insulin, or alpha glucosidase inhibitors.<br>
However, the two biguanides, phenformin and metformin, can also<br>
induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea, respectively.<br><br>
Alpha glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, work by<br>
delaying absorption of glucose in the intestine.<br>
Alpha-amylase inhibitors inhibit the enzymatic degradation of<br>
starch or glycogen into maltose, which also reduces the amounts<br>
of bioavailable sugars.<br>
The glitazones, also known as thiazolidinediones (i.e.<br>
5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones), are a more recently<br>
described class of compounds with potential for a novel mode<br>
of action in ameliorating many symptoms of type 2 diabetes.<br>
These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in<br>
muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of<br>
type 2 diabetes resulting in partial or complete correction of<br>
the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of<br>
hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are<br>
agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor<br>
(PPAR) gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally<br>
believed to be responsible for the improved insulin<br>
sensitization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR<br>
agonists that are being developed for treatment of Type 2<br>
diabetes and/or dyslipidemia are agonists of one or more of the<br>
PPAR alpha, gamma and delta subtypes.<br>
However, treatment of diabetes with PPAR y agonists has<br>
been associated with cardiac hypertrophy, or an increase in<br>
heart weight. Recent labeling revisions for Avandia<br>
(rosiglitazone maleate), a PPARy agonist, indicate that<br>
patients may experience fluid accumulation and volume-related<br>
events such as edema and congestive heart failure. Cardiac<br>
hypertrophy related to PPARy agonist treatment is typically<br>
treated by withdrawing PPAR treatment.<br><br>
Treatment of type 2 diabetes also typically includes<br>
physical exercise, weight control and dieting. While physical<br>
exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will<br>
dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with<br>
this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched<br>
sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially<br>
of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. However,<br>
weight reduction and increased exercise are difficult for most<br>
people with diabetes.<br>
Abnormal glucose homeostasis is also associated both<br>
directly and indirectly with obesity, hypertension and<br>
alterations in lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein<br>
metabolism. Obesity increases the likelihood of insulin<br>
resistance, and increases the likelihood that the resulting<br>
insulin resistance will increase with increasing body weight.<br>
Therefore, therapeutic control of glucose homeostasis, lipid<br>
metabolism, obesity and hypertension are critically important<br>
in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
Obesity, which can be defined as a body weight more than<br>
20% above the ideal body weight, is a major health concern in<br>
Western societies . It is estimated that about 97 million adults<br>
in the United States are overweight or obese. Obesity is the<br>
result of a positive energy balance, as a consequence of<br>
increased ratio of caloric intake to energy expenditure. The<br>
molecular factors regulating food intake and body weight<br>
balance are incompletely understood. [B. Staelsetal., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 270(27), 15958 (1995); F. Lonnquist et al. , Nature<br>
Medicine 1(9). 950 (1995)]. Although the genetic and/or<br><br>
environmental factors leading to obesity are poorly understood,<br>
several genetic factors have been identified.<br>
Epidemiological studies have shown that increasing<br>
degrees of overweight and obesity are important predictors of<br>
decreased life expectancy. Obesity causes or exacerbates many<br>
health problems, both independently and in association with<br>
other diseases. The medical problems associated with obesity,<br>
which can be serious and life-threatening, include type 2<br>
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, elevated plasma insulin<br>
concentrations, insulin resistance, dyslipidemias,<br>
hyperlipidemia, endometrial, breast, prostate, kidney and<br>
colon cancer, osteoarthritis; respiratory complications, such<br>
as obstructive sleep apnea, gallstones, arterioscelerosis,<br>
heart disease, abnormal heart rhythms, and heart arrythmias<br>
(Kopelman, P.G., Nature 404, 635-643 (2000)). Obesity is also<br>
associated with metabolic syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy, in<br>
particular left ventricular hypertrophy, premature death, and<br>
with a significant increase in mortality and morbidity from<br>
stroke, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure,<br>
coronary heart disease, and sudden death.<br>
Abdominal obesity has been linked with a much higher risk<br>
of coronary artery disease, and with three of its major risk<br>
factors: high blood pressure, diabetes that starts in adulthood,<br>
and high levels of fats (lipids) in the blood. Losing weight<br>
dramatically reduces these risks. Abdominal obesity is<br>
further closely associated with glucose intolerance,<br>
hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and other disorders<br>
associated with metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), such as raised<br>
high blood pressure, decreased levels of high density<br><br>
lipoproteins (HDL) and increased levels of very low density<br>
lipoproteins (VLDL) (Montague et al.. Diabetes, 2000, 49:<br>
883-888) .<br>
Obesity and obesity-related disorders, such as diabetes,<br>
are often treated by encouraging patients to lose weight by<br>
reducing their food intake or by increasing their exercise level,<br>
thereby increasing their energy output. A sustained weight<br>
loss of 5% to 10% of body weight has been shown to improve the<br>
comorbidities associated with obesity, such as diabetes, and<br>
can lead to improvement of obesity-related disorders such as<br>
diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, osteoarthritis, and<br>
pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction.<br>
Weight loss drugs used for the treatment of obesity<br>
include orlistat (Davidson, M.H. etal. (1999) JAMA 281: 235-42),<br>
dexfenfluramine (Guy Grand, B. et al. (1989) Lancet 2:1142-5),<br>
sibutramine (Bray, G. A. et al. (1999) Obes. Res. &amp;:189-98) and<br>
phentermine (Douglas, A. et al. (1983) Int. J. Obes. 7:591-5).<br>
However, the side effects of these drugs and anti-obesity agents<br>
may limit their use. Dexfenfluramine was withdrawn from the<br>
market because of suspected heart valvulopathy; orlistat is<br>
limited by gastrointestinal side effects; and the use of<br>
sibutramine is limited by its cardiovascular side effects which<br>
have led to reports of deaths and its withdrawal from the market<br>
in Italy.<br>
The term "diabetes," as used herein, includes both<br>
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e. , IDDM, also known as<br>
type 1 diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus<br>
(i.e. , NIDDM, also known as Type 2 diabetes) . Type 1 diabetes,<br>
or insulin-dependent diabetes, is the result of an absolute<br><br>
deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose<br>
utilization. Type 2 diabetes, or insulin-independent diabetes<br>
(i.e. , non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), often occurs<br>
in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and<br>
appears to be the result of the inability of tissues to respond<br>
appropriately to insulin. Most of the Type 2 diabetics are also<br>
obese. The compositions of the present invention are useful<br>
for treating both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The compositions<br>
are especially effective for treating Type 2 diabetes. The<br>
compositions of the present invention are also useful for<br>
treating and/or preventing gestational diabetes mellitus.<br>
Treatment of diabetes mellitus refers to the<br>
administration of a compound or combination of the present<br>
invention to treat diabetes. One outcome of treatment may be<br>
decreasing the glucose level in a subject with elevated glucose<br>
levels. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing insulin<br>
levels in a subject with elevated insulin levels. Another<br>
outcome of treatment is decreasing plasma triglycerides in a<br>
subject with elevated plasma triglycerides. Another outcome<br>
of treatment is decreasing LDL cholesterol in a subject with<br>
high LDL cholesterol levels. Another outcome of treatment is<br>
increasing HDL cholesterol in a subject with low HDL cholesterol<br>
levels. Another outcome of treatment is increasing insulin<br>
sensivity. Another outcome of treatment may be enhancing<br>
glucose tolerance in a subject with glucose intolerance. Yet<br>
another outcome of treatment may be decreasing insulin<br>
resistance in a subject with increased insulin resistance or<br>
elevated levels of insulin.<br><br>
Prevention of diabetes mellitus refers to the<br>
administration of a compound or combination of the present<br>
invention to prevent the onset of diabetes in a subject in need<br>
thereof.<br>
The term "hypertension" as used herein includes essential,<br>
or primary, hypertension wherein the cause is not known or where<br>
hypertension is due to greater than one cause, such as changes<br>
in both the heart and blood vessels; and secondary hypertension<br>
wherein the cause is known. Causes of secondary hypertension<br>
include, but are not limited to obesity; kidney disease;<br>
hormonal disorders; use of certain drugs, such as oral<br>
contraceptives, corticosteroids, cyclosporin, and the like.<br>
The term "hypertension" encompasses high blood pressure, in<br>
which both the systolic and diastolic pressure levels are<br>
elevated, and isolated systolic hypertension, in which only the<br>
systolic pressure is elevated to greater than or equal to 140<br>
mm Hg, while the diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. One<br>
outcome of treatment is decreasing blood pressure in a subject<br>
with high blood pressure.<br>
Dyslipidemias or disorders of lipid metabolism, include<br>
various conditions characterized by abnormal concentrations of<br>
one or more lipids (i.e. cholesterol and triglycerides), and/or<br>
apolipoproteins (i.e., apolipoproteins A, B, C and E), and/or<br>
lipoproteins (i.e. , the macromolecular complexes formed by the<br>
lipid and the apolipoprotein that allow lipids to circulate in<br>
blood, such as LDL, VLDL and IDL) . Hyperlipidemia is associated<br>
with abnormally high levels of lipids , LDL and VLDL cholesterol,<br>
and/or triglycerides.<br><br>
The term "metabolic syndrome", also known as syndrome X,<br>
is defined in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol<br>
Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and<br>
Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP-III). E.S.<br>
Ford et al., JAMA, vol. 287 (3), Jan. 16, 2002, pp 356-359.<br>
Briefly, a person is defined as having metabolic syndrome if<br>
the person has three or more of the following symptoms:<br>
abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol,<br>
high blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. The<br>
criteria for these are defined in ATP-III.<br>
The term "left venticular hypertrophy" (LVH) as used<br>
herein includes three patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy<br>
that have been identified based on left ventricular mass index<br>
(LVMI = left ventricular mass in grams divided by body surface<br>
area in meters2) and relative wall thickness (RWT = 2 x posterior<br>
wall thickness/left ventricular end diastolic diameter).<br>
Concentric LVH is typically exemplified by a left ventricular<br>
mass index of 144 and a relative wall thickness of 0.52;<br>
eccentric LVH is typically exemplified by a left ventricular<br>
mass index of 136 and a relative wall thickness of 0.38; and<br>
concentric left ventricular remodeling which is typically<br>
exemplified by a LVMI of 93 and a relative wall thickness of<br>
0.49. Normal LVMI are typically 85 and normal RWT approximately<br>
0.36. Patients with concentric left ventricular (LV)<br>
remodeling have a cardiovascular risk intermediate between<br>
those with normal left ventricular structure and those with left<br>
ventricular hypertrophy.<br>
One outcome of treatment of diabetes while minimizing<br>
cardiac hypertrophy, or left ventricular hypertrophy, may be<br><br>
a decrease in ventricular mass. Another outcome of treatment<br>
of diabetes while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left<br>
ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in the rate of<br>
increase of ventricular mass. Another outcome of treatment of<br>
diabetes while minimizing cardiac hypertrophy or left<br>
ventricular hypertrophy may be a decrease in ventricular wall<br>
thickness. Another outcome of treatment of diabetes while<br>
minimizing cardiac hypertrophy of left ventricular hypertrophy<br>
may be the decrease in the rate of increase in ventricular wall<br>
thickness.<br>
The term "obesity" as used herein is a condition in which<br>
there is an excess of body fat. The operational definition of<br>
obesity is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is<br>
calculated as body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m2) .<br>
"Obesity" refers to a condition whereby an otherwise healthy<br>
subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to<br>
30 kg/m2, or a condition whereby a subject with at least one<br>
co-morbidity has a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2. An<br>
"obese subject" is an otherwise healthy subject with a Body Mass<br>
Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 or a subject with<br>
at least one co-morbidity with a BMI greater than or equal to<br>
27 kg/m2. A "subject at risk of obesity" is an otherwise healthy<br>
subject with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 30 kg/m2 or a subject<br>
with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less<br>
than 27 kg/m2.<br>
The increased risks associated with obesity occur at a<br>
lower Body Mass Index (BMI) in Asians. In Asian countries,<br>
including Japan, "obesity" refers to a condition whereby a<br>
subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related<br><br>
co-morbidity, that requires weight reduction or that would be<br>
improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal<br>
to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, including Japan, an "obese<br>
subject" refers to a subject with at least one obesity-induced<br>
or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction<br>
or that would be improved by weight reduction, with a BMI greater<br>
than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asia-Pacific, a "subject at risk<br>
of obesity" is a subject with a BMI of greater than 23 kg/m2<br>
to less than 25 kg/m2.<br>
As used herein, the term "obesity" is meant to encompass<br>
all of the above definitions of obesity.<br>
Obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidities<br>
include, but are not limited to, diabetes, non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes mellitus - type 2, diabetes associated with<br>
obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose,<br>
insulin resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension,<br>
hypertension associated with obesity, hyperuricacidemia, gout,<br>
coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina<br>
pectoris, sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty<br>
liver; cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, transient<br>
ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, arthritis deformans,<br>
lumbodynia, emmeniopathy, and infertility. In particular,<br>
co-morbidities include: hypertension, hyperlipidemia,<br>
dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease,<br>
sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and other obesity-related<br>
conditions.<br>
Treatment of obesity and obesity-related disorders<br>
refers to the administration of the compounds or combinations<br>
of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight<br><br>
of an obese subject. One outcome of treatment may be reducing<br>
the body weight of an obese subject relative to that subject's<br>
body weight immediately before the administration of the<br>
compounds or combinations of the present invention. Another<br>
outcome of treatment may be preventing body weight regain of<br>
body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or<br>
pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be<br>
decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of<br>
obesity-related diseases. The treatment may suitably result<br>
in a reduction in food or calorie intake by the subject,<br>
including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of<br>
intake of specific components of the diet such as carbohydrates<br>
or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or<br>
the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and in weight<br>
reduction in patients in need thereof. The treatment may also<br>
result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an increase<br>
in metabolic rate, rather than or in addition to an inhibition<br>
of the reduction of metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of<br>
the metabolic resistance that normally results from weight<br>
loss.<br>
Prevention of obesity and obesity-related disorders<br>
refers to the administration of the compounds or combinations<br>
of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight<br>
of a subject at risk of obesity. One outcome of prevention may<br>
be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity<br>
relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the<br>
administration of the compounds or combinations of the present<br>
invention. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing<br>
body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result<br><br>
of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of<br>
prevention may be preventing obesity from occurring if the<br>
treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a<br>
subject at risk of obesity. Another outcome of prevention may<br>
be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity of obesity-related<br>
disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset<br>
of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Moreover, if<br>
treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such<br>
treatment may prevent the occurrence, progression or severity<br>
of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to,<br>
arteriosclerosis, Type 2 diabetes, polycystic ovary disease,<br>
cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, dermatological<br>
disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and<br>
cholelithiasis.<br>
The term "atherosclerosis" as used herein encompasses<br>
vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and<br>
understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of<br>
medicine. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, coronary<br>
heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic<br>
heart disease), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vessel<br>
disease are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and<br>
are therefore encompassed by the terms "atherosclerosis" and<br>
"atherosclerotic disease." The combination comprised of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of an anti-obesity agent in<br>
combination with a therapeutically effective amount of an<br>
anti-diabetic agent may be administered to prevent or reduce<br>
the risk of occurrence, or recurrence where the potential exists,<br>
of a coronary heart disease event, a cerebrovascular event, or<br><br>
intermittent claudication. Coronary heart disease events are<br>
intended to include CHD death, myocardial infarction (i.e., a<br>
heart attack), and coronary revascularization procedures.<br>
Cerebrovascular events are intended to include ischemic or<br>
hemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accidents)<br>
and transient ischemic attacks. Intermittent claudication is<br>
a clinical manifestation of peripheral vessel disease. The<br>
term "atherosclerotic disease event" as used herein is intended<br>
to encompass coronary heart disease events, cerebrovascular<br>
events, and intermittent claudication. It is intended that<br>
persons who have previously experienced one or more non-fatal<br>
atherosclerotic disease events are those for whom the potential<br>
for recurrence of such an event exists.<br>
Circadian rhythms affect a variety of physiological<br>
parameters: rest-activity, sleep-wake cycles, body<br>
temperature, rhythms in hormone levels, oscillations in general<br>
physiology and the like. When these parameters are out of<br>
synchrony with the daily clock, a circadian rhythm imbalance<br>
occurs which can affect physiology, performance on a variety<br>
of tasks and one' s emotional well being. The present invention<br>
is useful, for example, in the prevention or treatment of<br>
conditions associated with circadian rhythmicity as well as<br>
mental and physical disorders associated with travel across<br>
time zones and with rotating shift-work schedules.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
method for the prevention or treatment of a circadian rhythm<br>
disorder in a mammal, including time-zone change (jet-lag)<br>
syndrome, shift-work sleep disorder, delayed sleep-phase<br>
syndrome, advanced sleep-phase syndrome, and non-24-hour<br><br>
sleep-wake disorder, which comprises administering to the<br>
mammal an effective amount of a NPY Y5 receptor antagonist.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
method for shortening the time of re-entrainment (return to<br>
normal entrainment of the circadian rhythms; synchronized to<br>
the environmental light-dark cycle) in a subject following a<br>
shift in the sleep-wake cycle which comprises administering to<br>
the subject an appropriate amount of a NPY Y5 antagonist.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
method for alleviating the effects of jet lag in a traveler,<br>
especially a mammal, which comprises administering to the<br>
traveler an alertness increasing amount of a NPY Y5 antagonist.<br>
The purpose of this embodiment is to assist the body to adjust<br>
physiologically to the changes in sleep and feeding patterns<br>
when crossing several time zones.<br>
In another more preferred embodiment, the present<br>
invention provides a method for resetting the internal<br>
circadian clock in a subject to match the subject's current<br>
activity/sleep cycle. For example shift workers changing from<br>
a day to a night shift or vice versa, which comprises<br>
administering to the subject an appropriate amount of a NPY Y5<br>
antagonist.<br>
The present invention is further directed to the use of<br>
NPY Y5 antagonist, for enhancing or improving sleep quality as<br>
well as preventing and treating sleep disorders and sleep<br>
disturbances in a mammal. In particular, the present invention<br>
provides a method for enhancing or improving sleep quality by<br>
increasing sleep efficiency and augmenting sleep maintenance.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a method for<br><br>
preventing and treating sleep disorders and sleep disturbances<br>
in a mammal which comprising the administration of a NPY Y5<br>
antagonist. The present invention further provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition for enhancing or improving sleep<br>
quality and increasing sleep efficiency and sleep maintenance.<br>
The present invention is useful for the treatment of sleep<br>
disorders, including Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining<br>
Sleep (insomnias) ("DIMS") which can arise from<br>
psychophysiological causes, as a consequence of psychiatric<br>
disorders (particularly related to anxiety), from drugs and<br>
alcohol use and abuse (particularly during withdrawal stages),<br>
childhood onset DIMS, nocturnal myoclonus and restless legs and<br>
non specific REM disturbances as seen in ageing.<br>
The following outcomes in a subject which are provided<br>
by the present invention may be correlated to enhancement in<br>
sleep quality: an increase in the value which is calculated<br>
from the time that a subject sleeps divided by the time that<br>
a subject is attempting to sleep; a decrease in sleep latency<br>
(the time it takes to fall asleep); a decrease in the number<br>
of awakenings during sleep; a decrease in the time spent awake<br>
following the initial onset of sleep; an increase in the total<br>
amount of sleep; an increase the amount and percentage of REM<br>
sleep; an increase in the duration and occurrence of REM sleep;<br>
a reduction in the fragmentation of REM sleep; an increase in<br>
the amount and percentage of slow-wave (i.e. stage 3 or 4) sleep;<br>
an increase in the amount and percentage of stage 2 sleep; a<br>
decrease in the number of awakenings, especially in the early<br>
morning; an increase in daytime alertness; and increased sleep<br>
maintenance. Secondary outcomes which may be provided by the<br><br>
present invention include enhanced cognitive function and<br>
increased memory retention. A "method for enhancing the<br>
quality of sleep" refers to a method that results in outcomes<br>
in a subject which may be correlated to enhancement in sleep<br>
quality, including, but not limited to, the outcomes correlated<br>
to enhancement of sleep quality as defined above.<br>
The present invention is further useful for the<br>
prevention and treatment of sleep disorders and sleep<br>
disturbances including sleep problems associated with insomnia,<br>
hypersomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, nocturnal myoclonus, REM<br>
sleep interruptions, jet-lag, shift workers* sleep<br>
disturbances, dysomnias, night terror, night eating syndrome,<br>
insomnias associated with depression or with emotional/mood<br>
disorders, dysfunctions associated with sleep (parasomnias),<br>
as well as sleep walking and enuresis, as well as sleep disorders<br>
which accompany aging. Sleep disorders and sleep disturbances<br>
are generally characterized by difficulty in initiating or<br>
maintaining sleep or in obtaining restful or enough sleep.<br>
In addition, certain drugs may also cause reductions in<br>
REM sleep as a side effect and the present invention may be used<br>
to correct those types of sleeping disorders as well. The<br>
present invention would also be of benefit in the treatment of<br>
syndromes such as fibromyalgia which are manifested by<br>
non-restorative sleep and muscle pain or sleep apnea which is<br>
associated with respiratory disturbances during sleep. It<br>
will be clear to one skilled in the art that the present invention<br>
is not limited to just sleep disorders and sleep disturbances,<br>
but is applicable to a wide variety of conditions which result<br>
from a diminished quality of sleep.<br><br>
The present invention is also concerned with treatment<br>
and prevention of these conditions, and with the use of a NPY<br>
Y5 antagonist, combinations, and compositions thereof, for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament useful for treating or preventing<br>
these conditions.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the subject<br>
mammal is a human. Although the present invention is applicable<br>
both old and young people, it may find greater application in<br>
elderly people. Further, although the invention may be<br>
employed to enhance the sleep of healthy people, it may be<br>
especially beneficial for enhancing the sleep quality of people<br>
suffering from sleep disorders or sleep disturbances.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be used in<br>
combination with other drugs that may also be useful in the<br>
treatment, prevention, or control of disorders, such as<br>
hypertension, hypertension associated with obesity,<br>
hypertension-related disorders, cardiac hypertrophy, left<br>
ventricular hypertrophy, and metabolic syndrome, obesity and<br>
obesity-related disorders, for which compounds comprising the<br>
compositions are useful. Such other drugs may be administered,<br>
by a route and in an amount commonly used therefore,<br>
contemporaneously or sequentially with a composition of the<br>
present invention. When a composition of the present invention<br>
is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such<br>
other drugs and the composition of the present invention is<br>
preferred. However, the combination therapy also includes<br>
therapies in which the composition of the present invention and<br>
one or more other drugs are administered on different<br><br>
overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used<br>
in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the<br>
composition of the present invention and the other active<br>
ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used<br>
singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention include those that contain one or more other<br>
active ingredients, in addition to a composition of the present<br>
invention.<br>
