				<td>"FLAME-RETARDANT  PLASTIC  COMPOSITION"<br>
[001]<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   invention   relates  to  a  flame-retadant   plastic composition  and  particularly   to  styrene-based   plastic<br>
composition which has anexcellent flame retardancy and is self-extinguishable     by     melt-dripping.     The     composition comprises   a   plurality   of  flame   retardants   which   exhibit when used in combination a synergistic effect on the flame retardancy.   Since   the   combined   flame   retardants   exhibit desired flame retardancy even in small amounts of addition and   are   highly   heat   stable   and   less   detriorative   to   the appearance and mechanical properties of the plastics, a cost effective  flame-retarded  styrene-based plastic  composition having an excellent moldability may be provided for use in fabricating   housings   and   parts   of   household   and   office automation apparatus and equipments as well as other flame retarded articles of melt-dripping type. [002] BACKGROUND PRIOR ART<br>
Styrene-base plastics are widely used to fabricate housings and parts of household and office automation apparatus and equipments utilizing their excellent moldability,    appearance   and   mechanical   properties.    For<br>
1<br><br>
these applications, the fabricated articles are required to be flame retarded to avoid dangerous firing and flame-retarded styrene-based plastic compositions containing a halogenated flame retardant have been used to date. In addition to the flame  retardancy,  the  plastic  compositions  are required to have    increased    heat    stability,     heat    resistance,     melt-flowability,  impact  strength  and  other properties  for  such applications. [003]<br>
A  typical   example   of  cases   where   fabricated   plastic products   are   required   to   be   self-extinguishable   by   melt-dripping is to produce plastic articles meeting grade V-2 in the    vertical    burning    test    method    according    to    UL-94 standard  of Underwriters  Laboratoires.  JP-B-5904360  and JP-B-62034784   disclose   a   flame   retarding   technology   to achieve       the       above       requirement       by       incorporating hexabromocyclododecane   known   to   be   effective   in   small amounts of addition into plastics. Hexabromocyclododecane is,    however,    thermally    decomposed    at    a    relatively   low temperature.   Therefore,   when   compounding    with   plastics under heat it decreases the  heat stability of the  resulting composition and changes color thereof from bright to dark. [004]<br>
German     Patent     No.     2,150,700     discloses     bis(2,3-dibromopropyl)  ether  of tetrabromobisphenol A as   a  flame<br>
2<br><br>
retardant having improved heat stability compared to hexabromocyclododecane. This flame retardant is still not satisfactory in heat stability and may produce. scorching when used for instance, in the hot runner molding technique to shorten the molding cycle time and improve the efficiency of molding operations. [005]<br>
JP-A-05 140389 discloses use of certain heat stabilizers in combination with bis(2, 3-dibromopropyl) ether of tetrabromobisphenol A to remedy the above defect. The heat stability of the above flame retardant was found to be not entirely satisfactory in practice by this approach. [006]<br>
Use of another flame retardant in combination with tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2, 3-dibromopropyl)ether has been proposed. JP-A-0 42 39 5 48 and JP-A-04292646 disclose a bromine-containing organic phosphorus compound and a bromine-containing epoxy polymer, respectively as a flame retardant to be combined. These proposals are proven, however, to be not entirely effective to increase the heat stability or deteriorative to the heat resistance, impact strength and other properties of plastics because a relatively large amount must be added. [007]<br>
JP-A-08208939     discloses      a     styrene-based     plastic<br>
3<br><br>
composition   having   well-balanced   heat   resistance,   impact<br>
strength   and   heat   stability   containing   a   polyhalogenated<br>
diphenylalkane and an organopolysiloxane. Polvhalogenated<br>
diphenylalkane itself is,  however, not uniformly dispersible<br>
in the  plastics and the  composition  are  often  not  stable  in<br>
properties   among   different   batches   and   also   exhibit   poor<br>
flowability.<br>
[008]<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  object  of the  present  invention  is  to  eliminate  or ameliorate various problems associated with prior art. [009]<br>
The     present     invention     provides      an     economically effective,  flame-retarded  styrene-based plastic  composition having   well-balanced   properties   including   heat   stability, heat resistance, melt-flowability and impact strength. [010]<br>
The composition comprises:<br>
(A)	a styrene-based plastic material;<br>
(B)	a brominated aromatic compound having a melting<br>
point  from  200oC   to  260oC   in  which  all bromine  atoms  are<br>
attached to the aromatic ring;<br>
(C)	an   organic   compound   having   at   least   one    2,3-<br>
dibromopropyl group;<br>
and optionally<br>
4<br><br>
(D) antimony trioxide;<br>
the proportions of components (B),(C) and (D) per 100 part  by weight  of the   styrene-based  plastic  material   (A) being such that the sum of (B) + (C) is 3 to 10 parts by weight in which (B) occupies 20 to 80 % by weight of the sum, and (D) is 0 to 3 part by weight. [011] DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The   term   "styrene-based   plastic   material"   as   used herein   refers   to   polystyrene,    styrene-    -methylstyrene copolymer   and   otter   copolymera   of   styrene   with   minor proportions   of   comonomers    such    as    butadiene,    methyl methacrylate,acrylonitrile maleic anhydride or a derivative<br>
thereof or itaconic acid.<br>
[012]<br>
Examples of brominated aromatic compounds having a<br>
melting    point    from     200oC       to     260 oC        (B)    include  .<br>
tris(tribromophenoxy) triazine (m.p.about 230oC), a mixture<br>
thereof with dibromophenoxy-bis(tribromophenoxy) triazine<br>
and/or	bis(dibromophenoxy)-tribromophenoxytriazine,<br>
bis(tribromophenoxy)ethane (m.p. about 225oC ) and brominated trimethylphenylindane (m.p. 235-255oC ). Because all bromine atoms are directly attached to the aromatic ring, component (B) itaelf is thermally stable. In contrast,  similar compounds having a melting point lower<br>
5<br><br>
than 200°C adversely affects the heat resistance of the resulting plastic composition while those compounds having a melting point higher than 260oC are not homogeneously dispersible in the plastic material because it does not melt at the process temperature of the plastic material. [013]<br>
Organic compounds having at least one 2,3-dibromopropyl group (C) include 2, 3-dibromopropyl ethers of chlorinated or brominated phenols and tris(2,3 dibromopropyl)isocyanurate. Specific examples thereof include the following: [014]<br>
l-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-2,4,6-tribromobenzene;<br>
l-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-2,4-dibromobenzene;<br>
4,4'-bis(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,3',5,5'-tetrabromobiphenyl;<br>
bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dibromophenyl]<br>
methane;<br>
1, l-bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dibromophenyl]<br>
ethane;<br>
2,2-bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dibromophenyl]<br>
propane;<br>
bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dichlorophenyl] methane;<br>
l,l-bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dichlorophenyl]<br>
6<br><br>
ethane;<br>
2,2-bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dichlorophenyl] propane;<br>
bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropoxy)-3,5-dibromophenyl] s u1fide;<br>
bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropyl)-3,5-dibromophenyl] sulfoxide;<br>
bis[4-(2,3-dibromopropyl)-3,5'dibromophenyl]    sulfone; and<br>
tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate. [015]<br>
Antimony trioxide (D) which is known to be a flame retardancy enhancer may optionally added. Particles having an average diameter of 0.4 to 1.2  m are preferred for ease of dispersion in the plastic material. The sum of proportions of component (B) and component (C) is 3 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the plastic material (A). The desired flame retardancy level will not be obtained with a proportion less than the above range while a proportion higher than the above range is not only uneconomical but also adversely affects the strength properties and impact strength in particular ofthe resulting composition. [016]<br>
The   proportion   of  antimony   trioxide   (D)   is,   if  used,<br>
7<br><br>
should be up to 3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the plastic material (A). Excessive addition thereof does not further enhance the flame retardancy and adversely affects the thermal stability, impact strength    melt-flowability and other properties of the resulting composition. [017]<br>
It   is   important   for   the   present   invention   that   the weight ratio B/(B + C) lies between 0.2 to 0.8. In other words, the      bromine-containing      flame      retardant      combination consists of 20 to 80 % by weight of component (B)  and the balance  of component  (C).  When  departing from the  above range, the balance between the flame retardancy and other properties  of the  resulting plastic composition will be  lost and   these   properties   will   not   be   significantly   different compared     to     the     addition     of     respective     components separately. [018]<br>
The temperature at which all components of the flame retarded plastic composition of the present invention are blended together preferably lies between 180oC and 260oC . Since it is important for component (B) to be blended in molten state with the styrene-based plastic material (A), the blending process is advantageously carried out at a temperature close the melting point of component (B). Component  (C)  normally  has  a  melting point  below   150oC<br>
8<br><br>
and decreases the melting point of component (B) when mixed. The blending process may, therefore, be carried out at a temperature slightly lower than the melting point of component (B). However, a blending temperature higher than 260oC should be avoided since component (C) will be thermally decomposed at such temperatures to darken the plastic material. [019]<br>
The flame retarded plastic composition of the present invention may be processed into fabricated articles at the conventional fabricating temperature for styrene-based plastic materials. Once blended homogeneously, no concern is needed about the melting point of component (B). [020]<br>
The  flame  retarded  styrene-based plastic  composition of the   present  invention   may   comprise   a  variety   of other conventional      additives      provided      that      the      beneficial properties     of     the     composition     are     not     compromised. Examples    thereof   include    melt-dripping   enhancers,    heat stabilizers,    antioxidants,    UV    absorbers,    UV    stabilizers, fillers,    pigments,    lubricants,    mold    release    agents    and antistatic agents.

[023]<br>
Component (B),  component (C),  antimony trioxide  and<br>
antioxidant were initially mixed together in a vertical mixer<br>
for 3 minutes. Thereafter styrene-based plastic material (A) was added to the same mixer to obtain a dry blend. The blend was fed to a twin screw extruder provided with a barrel having an inner diameter of 20 mm and extruded through a die having an orifice diameter of 3 mm at a barrel temperature of 230oC. The extruded strand was cooled and solidified by passing through a water bath and cut into pellets. Test pieces were produced by injection molding the pellets using an injection molding machine at a mold temperature of 200°C and tested for flame retardancy, HDT, ball impact strength, Izod impact strength and thermal stability according to the test methods described below. Melt flow rate (MFR) was determined using the pellets before injection molding. The results obtained are shown in Tables 1-4. [024]<br>

From the above test results, it will be appreciated that the flame retarded compositions of Examples are excellent in impact     strength     to     the     compositions     of    Comparative Examples  containing component  (B)  alone  and in thermal stability relative to compositions of Comparative Examples containing component (C) alone. [028]<br>
The composition of Comparative Example 4 containing Reference flame retard-ant compound (A) in combination with component (C) exhibits the desired level of flame retardancy but is inferior to the compositions of Examples in MFR and . impact strength. [029]<br>
The composition of Comparative Example 5 containing an amount of Reference flame retardant compound B sufficient to exhibit the desired level of flame retardancy in combination with component (C) is inferior to the compositions of Examples in thermal deformation temperature and impact strength. [030]<br>
Table 5 demonstrates that the combined use component (B) and component (C) in Example 13 results in higher impact strengh than the use component (B) alone in Comparative    Example     13    and    also    in    higher    thermal<br>
25<br><br>
stability than the use of component   (C) alone in Comparative<br>
Example 14.<br>
[031]<br>
Table 4 demonstrates that component (B) or component<br>
(C) alone is not effective to impart the composition with the desired level of flame retardancy unless antimony trioxide is used but the desired level of flame retardancy may be achieved without antimony trioxide when component (B) and component (C) are used in combination.<br>
