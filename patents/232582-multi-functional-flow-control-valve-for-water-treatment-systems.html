The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a multi-functional flow control valve for water treatment systems.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
All existing industrial and household water treatment systems depend on the switching function of multi-functional flow control valves for the purposes of softening, purification, backwash and regeneration of effluent. Typical valves currently on the market are Fleck® valves and Autotrol valves. The Fleck® valve, produced by Pentair, Inc., USA, has several layers of sealing rings in a valve body thereof, which are separated by plastic, thereby allowing space therebetween. The sealing rings are sealed against the valve body on an external side thereof and against<br>
a cylinder encapsulated piston on an internal side thereof. The encapsulated piston may be drawn up and down and positioned at different positions to form different flow channels. Hence, the performance of this multi-port valve is realized by the encapsulated piston being placed at different positions along the axis.<br>
The Autotrol valve, produced by Autotrol Corporation also in USA, has several valves arranged along a band in a valve body thereof. A cam rotor axis with several cams at different angles is operated by an engine. As the cam rotor axis rotates, the cams, which are at different angles, are open to certain ports but closed to others, thereby realizing different flow channels and the desired functions.<br>
Other multi-functional flow control valves are also available.   One such<br>
*2~<br><br>
valve combines several valves into one valve body. This results in a complicated structure which is difficult to manufacture, is bigger in size and inconvenient to install.<br>
Another type of flow control valve interconnects several external valves and controls the flow by opening and closing different valves in different positions. This type is difficult to install and inconvenient to operate.<br>
A further type of valve features the movements of the encapsulated piston in the sealed cavity. The flow is controlled and directed by locating the encapsulated piston in different positions. However, the problem with this structure is that the flow in the channels are easily mixed and thus undermine the treatment effect.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a multi-functional flow control valve for use in water treatment systems to assist to soften, purify, backwash and regenerate effluent, the control valve having a simplified and compact structure which is easy to operate.<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, a multi-functional flow control valve for water treatment systems has been developed employing the theory of hermetically sealed interfaces in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The valve includes a valve body having a water inlet port, a water outlet port and an effluent outlet. A valve core connected with a valve rod is placed inside the valve body. The valve body defines a flow channel therein for in fluid communication with an internal region and an external region of a filter element of the water treatment system, respectively. The valve core includes a movable valve disk rotatable with respect to a fixed valve disk, each disk having a head face whereby the head faces are in abutting relationship to provide a hermetically sealed interface.   The movable valve disk is connected to the valve rod.   The fixed valve<br>
3<br><br>
disk defines a plurality of through holes therein which are in fluid communication with the water inlet port, the water outlet port and the effluent outlet, respectively. The movable valve disk defines a through hole and two blind recesses therein. By rotating the movable valve disk, the through hole and the blind recesses in the movable valve disk may be aligned with corresponding holes in the fixed valve disk to form different liquid flow channels allowing the flow to be controlled. The movable valve disk and fixed valve disk being coaxial such that the through hole and<br>
the blind recesses in the movable valve disk can be aligned with the plurality of through holes in the fixed valve disk.<br>
The basic principle for design of this invention is that different ports are allocated on a plane circle and as the movable valve disk is rotated some ports open whilst others close.<br>
During use the movable valve disk is rotated manually or by other means such as an engine, and different control cycles of softening, backwash, regeneration, fast rinse, etc, as different through holes and blind recesses on the movable and the fixed valve disks align. On a whole the present invention features include easy operation, compact structure, easy manufacturing, quick installation, a wide range of applications in various industrial and household water treatment systems, and improved quality of water treatment.<br>
The present invention further provides a multi-functional flow control valve for a water treatment system, comprising:<br>
a valve body having a water inlet port, a water outlet port and an effluent outlet, and<br>
defining a flow channel therein for connecting with an internal region and an<br>
external region of a filter element of the water treatment system, respectively;<br>
a valve core incorporated within the valve body and including a movable valve disk<br>
rotatable with respect to a fixed valve disk, each disk having a head face in<br>
abutting relationship to provide a hermetically sealed interface, the movable<br>
4<br><br>
valve disk providing a through hole and at least two blind recesses therein, the fixed valve disk defining a plurality of through holes therein which are in fluid communication to the water inlet port, the water outlet port and the effluent outlet, respectively; and a valve rod connecting with the movable valve disk to rotate the movable disk with<br>
respect to the fixed valve disk; wherein by rotating the movable valve disk, the through hole and the blind recesses in the movable valve disk align with corresponding holes in the fixed valve disk to form different liquid flow channels for realizing flow control.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The first embodiment<br>
Referring to Figs. 1-3, a control valve according to a first embodiment comprises a water inlet port 5, a water outlet port 6 and an effluent outlet 7 in a valve body 1, which is in fluid communication separately to an internal region and an external region of a filter element 18 of a water treatment system through a flow channel. A leg flow channel 16 is incorporated in the flow channel extends from the water inlet port 5 to the filter element 18. The leg flow channel 16 having an ejector nozzle 17 inside.<br>
A brine inlet port 20 is provided near the ejector nozzle 17 in the valve body 1 for connection with a brine tank 21 of the water treatment system.<br>
A valve core of the valve body 1 includes a movable valve disk 3 rotatable with respect to a fixed valve disk 2. Each disk 2, 3, having a head face in abutting relationship with each other to provide a hermetically sealed interface. The movable valve disk 3 is connected to a valve rod 4. The fixed valve disk 2 provides a through hole 8 in a center of the head face thereof to be in fluid communication with<br>
I<br><br>
the effluent outlet 7 of the valve body 1, and six through holes arranged around the through hole 8, among which through hole 9 is in fluid communication with the external region of the filter element 18, through holes 10, 12 are in fluid communication with the internal region of the filter element 18, through hole 11 is in fluid communication with the water outlet port 6, and through holes 24 and 25 are in fluid communication with an inlet port and an outlet port of the ejector nozzle 17, respectively.<br>
Formed in the head face of the movable valve disk 3 a radial blind recess 13 extends from the center of the disk 3 to an edge thereof whilst a blind recess 14 shaped as a circular arc segment extends around the center of the disk 3. The movable valve disk 3 further incorporates a through hole 15 which is in permanent fluid communication with the water inlet port 5.<br>
The holes and the blind recesses in the movable valve disk 3 and the fixed valve disk 2 are arranged so that they may be aligned. The fixed valve disk 2 and the movable valve disk 3 can be made of ceramics or other material. If the material is not hard enough, a separating bar (not shown) can be placed within some bigger holes like the through holes 9 and 10 to strengthen the disk. The through holes 10 and 12 can be made into one hole, but it is more difficult to produce.<br>
When in operation, the valve body 1 is fixed to a water treatment tank 19, and the filter element 18 is fixed in the water treatment tank 19 (or filtering material can be placed directly in water treatment tank 19 instead of the filter element 18). Normally a flow between the valve body 1 and the filter element 18 passes through a distributor 22 in the water treatment tank 19.<br>
A filter element 18 made from activated carbon or sand leach can be used for purification whilst a filter element 18 made from resin can be used for softening.<br>
The system can be operated manually or automatically.    In most industrial water<br>
4<br><br>
treatment systems, the valve rod 4 is worked by engines and switching between different cycles is realized by a variation in the alignment of the different holes in the<br>
movable valve disk 3 with those in the fixed valve disk 2.<br>
The following discussion of the water treatment system refers to the full range of working cycles of this embodiment using a resin filter element 18 . Brine or other regenerating material should be added for the regeneration of resin material. The water treatment system can be equipped with the brine tank 21 connected to the brine inlet port 20 of the valve body 1 by a water inlet valve 23.<br>
In a softening cycle, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the blind recess 14 covers the through holes 10 and 11. An inward water flow from the water inlet port 5 passes through through hole 15 into the through hole 9, before passing into the water treatment tank 19. After filtration by the filter element 18, the water flow runs through the distributor 22, the through hole 10, the blind recess 14 and the through hole 11 before it flows out through the water outlet port 6. In this cycle when the water flow runs through the water inlet port 5 to the flow channel external to the filter element 18, the blind recess 13 covers the through holes 8 and 25, so no flow channel is formed preventing flow in the leg flow channel 16.<br>
In a backwash cycle, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 10 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the blind recess 13 covers the through holes 8 and 9 in the fixed valve disk 2. The water flow runs by the through holes 15 and 10, enters the distributor 22, reaches the internal region of the filter element 18, backwashes the residue accumulated in the filter element 18 and becomes waste water which passes through the blind recess 13 into the through hole 8 and flows through the effluent outlet 7.<br>
10<br><br>
In a regeneration cycle through in-taking salt, as shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 24 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the blind recess 14 covers through holes 25 and 9, which are thus in fluid communication. The water flow from the water inlet port 5 passes by the through hole 15, enters the through hole 24, and jets out through the ejector nozzle 17 at the end of the leg flow channel 16. In this cycle, the water flow causes negative pressure at the outlet port of the ejector nozzle 17, i.e., the brine inlet port 20 of the valve body 1. As a result the brine in the brine tank 21 is caused to flow through the brine inlet port 20 through the water inlet valve 23. The mixed flow of the brine and the water runs through the through hole 25 to the through hole 9, through the blind recess 14, then into the water treatment tank 19. The flow is regenerated through the filter element 18, passes the distributor 22 into the through hole 10, enters the through hole 8 via the blind recess 13 and flows through the effluent outlet 7. When the water level in the brine tank 21 falls to a pre-defined point, the water inlet valve 23 shuts automatically.<br>
Once the brine in-taking cycle is completed water has to be added to the brine tank 21 to replace the brine which has been used. Referring to Figs. 10 and 11, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 25 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the blind recess 13 covers through holes 8 and 24, which are thus connected. The water flow reaches the outlet port of the ejector nozzle 17 from through hole 15 through through hole 25 and leg flow channel 16. As the outlet port of the ejector nozzle 17 is narrower, most of the flow runs into the brine tank 21 through the brine inlet port 20. When enough water accumulates, salt can be added into the brine tank 21 to provide the brine required for the regeneration cycle. The whole process is easily done. A small portion of water flows back through the ejector nozzle 17 and through through hole 24, enters through hole 8 via the blind recess 13, and flows from the effluent outlet 7.<br>
u<br><br>
In a fast rinse cycle, as shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the blind recess 13 covers the through holes 8 and 12 in the fixed valve disk 2. The water flow runs by the through holes 15 and 9, enters the filter element 18, washing the residue brine out of the filter element 18. The residue brine runs through the distributor 22, the through hole 12, the blind recess 13 and the through hole 8 before flow out the effluent outlet 7.<br>
In the purification cycle, the filter element 18 made from activated carbon material or sand leach may be added directly into the water treatment tank 19, in which case no regeneration is needed. As shown in Fig. 14, the brine inlet port 20 can then be blocked. Similar working procedures are followed for purification, backwash and fast rinse. In the course of production, the leg flow channel 16, the ejector nozzle 17 and the brine inlet port 20 can be omitted in the valve body 1 and the through hole 24 and the through hole 25 can also be omitted, which makes a simpler structure.<br>
A second embodiment:<br>
Figs. 25 and 26 show another movable valve disk and another fixed valve disk of a second embodiment, respectively.<br>
In the course of softening, as shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the lower blind recess 14 in the movable valve disk 3 covers the through holes 10 and 11, which are thus connected. The upper blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3 is only connected to the through hole 8 in the fixed valve disk 2 and no through channel is formed. In this cycle, the water flow runs into the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 by the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3.   As the through hole 9 leads to the top of the water treatment tank 19, the<br>
to.<br><br>
water flow runs into the top of the water treatment tank 19 and down through a resin layer where the water converts to softened water. The softened water then returns to a central channel of the water treatment tank 19 through a lower distributor, and runs upward to the through hole 10 in the fixed valve disk 2. As the through hole 10 and the through hole 11 are connected by the blind recess 14 in the movable valve disk 3, the softened water flows into the through hole 11 and through through hole 10. Since the through hole 11 leads to the water outlet port 6, the softened water flows out from the water outlet port 6.<br>
In the backwash cycle, as shown in Figs. 17 and 18, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 10 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the lower blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3 covers the through holes 9 and 8, which are thus connected. The upper blind recess 14 in the movable valve disk 3 is only connected to the through hole 12 in the fixed valve disk 2 and no through channel is formed. In this cycle, the water flow runs into the through hole 10 in the fixed valve disk 2 by the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3. As the through hole 10 leads to the central channel of the water treatment tank 19, the water flow runs into the central channel and down through the lower distributor into the water treatment tank 19. The water flow then returns in an upward direction to the resin layer and reaches the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2. As the through hole 9 and the through hole 8 are connected by the blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3, the water flow runs into the through hole 8 through and through through hole 9. As the through hole 8 leads to the effluent outlet 7 the waste water flows out from the effluent outlet 7 after the backwash cycle<br>
In the regeneration cycle, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 11 in the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the lower blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3 covers the through holes 10 and 8, which are thus connected.   The upper blind recess 14 in the movable<br>
13<br><br>
valve disk 3 is only connected to the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 and no through channel is formed. At this time, the water flow runs into the through hole 11 in the fixed valve disk 2 by the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3. As the through hole 11 leads to the water outlet port 6, a portion of the water flows directly out the water outlet port 6. Another portion of the water flow jets out from the ejector nozzle 17. After jetting, the flow causes negative pressure at the outlet port of the ejector nozzle 17, i.e., the brine inlet port 20 of the valve body 1, thereby opening the water inlet valve 23 of the brine tank 21. The brine in the brine tank 21 is in-taken by the brine inlet port 20 through the water inlet valve 23. The mixed flow of the brine and the water runs to the top of the water treatment tank 19, flows down through the resin layer, and reaches the lower distributor. The flow then flows upwardly through the central channel into the through holes 10 and 8 on the fixed valve disk 2. As the through hole 10 and the through hole 8 in the fixed valve disk 2 are connected by the blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3, the water flow runs by the through hole 10 to the through hole 8. As the through hole 8 leads to the effluent outlet 7, the waste water after brine in-taking flows from the effluent outlet 7.<br>
In the fast rinse cycle, as shown in Figs. 21 and 22, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2<br>
whilst the lower blind recess 14 in the movable valve disk 3 is only connected with the through holes 10 and no through channel is formed. The upper blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3 covers the through hole 12 and the through hole 8, which are thus connected. In this phase, the water flow runs into the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 by the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3. As the through hole 9 leads to the top of the water treatment tank 19, the water flow runs into the top of the water treatment tank 19 and down through the resin layer where the water flow washes down the brine regenerated by the resin layer which has taken in the brine. The water flow then returns to the central channel through the lower distributor, and runs upward to the through hole 10 and the through hole 12 in the<br>

fixed valve disk 2. As the through hole 12 and the through hole 8 is connected by the blind recess 14 in the movable valve disk 3, the water flow runs into the through<br>
hole 8 by the through hole 10 and the through hole 12. As the through hole 8 leads to the effluent outlet 7, the water flows out from the effluent outlet 7 after the cycle of fast rinse.<br>
When water is added to the brine tank 21, as shown in Fig. 23 and Fig. 24, the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 9 in<br>
the fixed valve disk 2 whilst the lower blind recess 14 in the movable valve disk 3 covers the through hole 10 and the through hole 11, which are thus connected. The upper blind recess 13 in the movable valve disk 3 is only connected to the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 and no through channel is formed. In this arrangement, the water flow runs into the through hole 9 in the fixed valve disk 2 by the through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3. As the through hole 9 leads to the top of the water treatment tank 19, the water flow runs into the top of the water treatment tank 19 and down through the resin layer where the water is converted into softened water. The softened water then returns to the central channel of the water treatment tank 19 through lower distributor and runs upward to the through hole 10 in the fixed valve disk 2. As the through hole 10 and the through hole 11 are connected by the blind recess 14, the softened water flows into the through hole 11 via the through hole 10. As the through hole 11 leads to the water outlet port 6, the softened water flows out from the water outlet port 6. A portion of the water flow passes through a pipe of the ejector nozzle 17 and a brine in-taking valve into the brine tank 21. When the brine tank 21 is full of water, the water inlet valve 23 in the brine tank 21 shuts automatically and stops the water flow.<br>
A third embodiment:<br>
Figs. 27-30 are illustrations for a third embodiment.<br>
ir<br><br>
Figs. 27 and 28 show another movable valve disk and another fixed movable valve disk of the third embodiment, respectively.<br>
The structure diagrams and working principles of the third embodiment for the procedures of softening, backwash, brine in-taking and fast rinse are basically the same as the first embodiment.<br>
Fig. 29 and Fig. 30 show the structure and the state of the valve and relative positions of the fixed and the movable valve disks for the regeneration cycle. The through hole 15 in the movable valve disk 3 is aligned with the through hole 11 in the fixed valve disk 2, the blind recess 13 covers and connects the through hole 9 and the through hole 8 in the fixed valve disk 2, whilst the blind recess 14 covers and connects the through hole 12 and the through hole 25 in the fixed valve disk 2. The water flow from the water inlet port 5 runs by the through hole 15, enters the through hole 11, and jets out from the ejector nozzle 17 at the end of the<br>
leg flow channel 16. After jetting, the water flow causes negative pressure at the outlet port of the ejector nozzle 17, i.e., the brine inlet port 20 of the valve body 1. The brine in the brine tank 21 is in-taken by the brine inlet port 20 through the water inlet valve 23. The mixed flow of the brine and the water runs from the through hole 25 to the through hole 12 via the blind recess 14 and the distributor 22, and flows into the bottom of the filter element 18 and further passes through the resin layer where the brine is regenerated. The flow then runs by the through hole 9, enters the through hole 8 via the blind recess 13 and flows out the effluent outlet port 7. When the water level of the brine tank 21 falls to the pre-defined point, the water inlet valve 23 shuts automatically.<br>
The third embodiment is designed to realize another mode of regeneration besides the first embodiment. The direction of the regenerated flow is opposite to the direction of water producing. The advantages of this mode include low brine and regenerated water consumption and high displacement ratio of resin regeneration.<br>
