HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2006/045364	PCT/EP2005/008497<br>

PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS WITH SALTS OF DIHYDROXYPROPYLTRI(C1-C3 ALKYL) AMMONIUM MONOSUBSTITUTED POLYOLS<br>
5	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention concerns personal care compositions providing moisturization both in high and low 10     relative humidity environments.<br>
The Related Art<br>
Dry skin is a problem in varying degree to most humans. This condition is particularly evident in <br>
15 	winter. Personal care products such as skin creams/lotions, shampoos/conditioners, toilette bars/shower gels and antiperspirant/deodorants are normally formulated with at least one material to address dry skin. Symptoms such as itching, flaking and a visually displeasing dermal appearance can all to some extent be modulated.<br>
2	0     There are three classes of materials employed against the problem. Occlusives such as petrolatum<br>
or silicone oils serve to inhibit loss of natural moisture. They form a barrier between the epidermis and the environment. Another approach is the use of keratolytic agents to enhance rate of dermal exfoliation. Alpha-hydroxy acids are the most common agents for achieving exfoliation.<br>
25       A third approach to dry skin is topical application of humectants. Hydroxylated monomeric and polymeric organic substances are generally used for this purpose. Glycerin known also as glycerol is one of the most effective humectants.<br>
There are several shortcomings in the performance of known humectants. Even the best such as<br>
3	0     glycerin requires to be formulated at relatively high levels to achieve good moisturization. Secondly,<br>
known humectants perform well in high relative humidity environments; however, hardly any of these substances provide effectiveness at low relative humidity (i.e. less than 20% moisture at 20°C). Average indoor relative humidity during winter is approximately 13% in areas such as the Northeast U.S. It is quite evident that a real need exists for an improved moisturization technology.<br>
35 <br>
WO 2006/045364	PCT/EP2005/008497<br>
-2-<br>
A moisturizer known as Honeyquat 50 with INCI name of Hydroxypropyltrimonium Honey has been reported to be a better humectant than glycerin (see the Arch/Brooks brochure entitled "Cosmetic Ingredients &amp; Ideas®, Issue No. 2, August 2001). Honeyquat 50 is described as being derived from the reaction of pendent hydroxy! groups (on the disaccharide) of a "light" deodorized grade of <br>
5 	honey with a chlorohydroxytrimethylammonium derivative. Although this substance has excellent humectancy, moisturization at low relative humidity still remains to be conquered.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention seeks to identify humectants which are operative not only at high but also low relative humidity, for application in personal care products.<br>
10<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect a personal care composition is provided which includes:<br>
(i)        from  0.1 to  30% by weight of a quaternary ammonium compound which is a salt of<br>
15	hydroxypropyltr(C1- C3alkyl) ammonium monosubstituted polyol, the cation having an<br>
average molecular weight no higher than 450 and the salt having a Tg no higher than<br>
10°C; and (ii)       a cosmetically acceptable carrier.<br>
2 0      In a second aspect of the invention a method for moisturizing skin is provided comprising applying to the skin such a composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
25       Now it has been found that salts wherein a cation is a hydroxypropyltri(C1-C3 alkyl)annmonium<br>
monosubstituted polyol are excellent moisturizers providing humectancy in both high and low relative humidity environments. Amounts of these salts may range from about 0.1 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.5 to about 20%, optimally from about 1% to about 12% by weight of the composition. <br>
30<br>
Salts of hydroxypropyl tri(C1-C3 alkyl) ammonium monosubstituted polyols can be formed in a variety of procedures. Most preferred is via reaction of 2-hydroxy-3-chloropropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride with a polyol, particularly a linear polyol in an approximately 1:1 molar ratio in an alkaline medium. By typical Williamson synthesis, sodium chloride is eliminated thereby forming an<br>
3	5      ether linkage between the hydroxypropyl end of the quaternary ammonium reactant and the polyol.<br><br>
WO 2006/045364	PCT/EP2005/008497<br>
-3-<br>
Typica! polyols are sorbitol, pentaerythritol, neopentyl glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and isoprene glycol.<br>
The cation should have an average molecular weight no higher than about 450, preferably no <br>
5	 higher than about 400, and optimally between about 300 and 400. Further, the salt advantageously is liquid at 23°C. Thus, the glass transition temperature (Tg)preferably is no higher than about 10°C, more preferably no higher than about 0°C. The Tgcan be measured in a Differential Scanning Calorimeter.<br>
10 	Ordinarily the C1-C3 alkyl constituent on the quaternized ammonium group will be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl or hydroxyethyl and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred is a trimetriyl ammonium group known through INCI nomenclature as a "trimonium" group. Any anion can be used in the quat salt. The anion may be organic or inorganic with the proviso that the material is cosmetically acceptable. Typical inorganic anions are halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates and<br>
15 	borates. Most preferred are the halides, especially chloride. Organic anionic counter ions include methosulfate, toluoyl sulfate, acetate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, gluconate, and benzenesulfonate.<br>
A particularly preferred salt is a chloride of hydroxypropyl trimonium sorbitol.<br>
20 	Advantageously compositions of the present invention will be formulated with a quaternary ammonium salt where the polyol is only mono-substituted with hydroxypropyltri(C1-C3 alkyl) ammonium groups. However, smaller amounts of di- and tri- substituted polyol may also be present These amounts normally may range from 0 to 20%, possibly from about 2 to about 10% by weight based on the weight of the quaternary ammonium compound present More specifically,<br>
25 	the multi-substituted polyol may be di-[hydroxypropyltri(C1-C3 alkyl) ammonium] polyol, tri-[hydroxypropyltri(C1-C3 alkyl)  ammonium] polyol and mixtures thereof.<br>
By the term personal care composition is meant any substance applied to a human body for improving appearance, cleansing, odor control or general aesthetics. Non-limiting examples of<br>
30 	personal care compositions include leave-on skin lotions and creams, shampoos, hair conditioners, shower gels, toilette bars, antiperspirants, deodorants, dental products, shave creams, depilatories, lipsticks, foundations, mascara, sunless tanners and sunscreen lotions.<br>
Compositions of this invention will also include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Amounts of tine 3 5     carrier may range from about 1 to about 99.9%, preferably from about 70 to about 95%, optimally<br><br>

For instance, leave-on skin lotions and creams, shampoos, conditioners and shower gels generally employ plastic containers with an opening at a dispensing end covered by a closure. Typical closures are screw-caps, non-<br>
15 	aerosol pumps and flip-top hinged lids. Packaging for antiperspirants, deodorants and depilatories may involve a container with a roll-on ball on a dispensing end. Alternatively these types of personal care products may be delivered in a stick composition formulation in a container with a propel-repel mechanism where the stick moves on a platform towards a dispensing orifice. Metallic cans pressurized by a propellant and having a spray nozzle serve as packaging for antiperspirants,<br>
20 	shave creams and other personal care products. Toilette bars may have packaging constituted by a cellulosic or plastic wrapper or within a cardboard box or even encompassed by a shrink wrap plastic film. All of the aforementioned are considered packaging within the context of the present invention.<br>

EXAMPLE 12<br>
This Example provides the results of moisturization efficacy tests. These tests involved evaluation on porcine epidermis utilized as a human skin model. The equipment and protocol are outlined below.<br>
5 	An environmental microbalance (Model MB-300W, VTI Corp., 2708 W 84th Street, Hialeah, FL 33016) was programmed to measure the change in weight of porcine skin as a function of relative humidity at a constant temperature and air flow. The porcine skin was evaluated before and after treatment with aqueous solutions of humectants to determine adsorption and retention of moisture.<br>
Sample preparation was done as follows: <br>
10     	Epidermal sections of porcine skin were cut to approximately 4 cm X1 cm.<br>
The skin was washed in a 10% detergent solution and dried in a dessicator to a constant weight<br>
This represents the Untreated material.<br>
The skin was soaked in a 1 % by weight aqueous solution of the test sample for 15 minutes, excess<br>
fluid was blotted off and the skin was dried to constant weight in a dessicator. This represents the 15     	Treated material.<br>
Sequence of conditions for the microbalance was as follows:<br>
30 minutes at 0% relative humidity. (Insures that sample is dry.)<br>
90 minutes at 80% relative humidity. (Determines amount of water picked up.)<br>
90 minutes at 20% relative humidity. (Determines amount of water retained.)<br>
2 0     The experiments were conducted as follows:<br>
The weight of a piece of untreated skin was recorded continuously during the sequence.<br>
The piece of untreated skin was treated with the test sample.<br>
The weight of the treated piece of skin was recorded continuously during the sequence.<br>
Data reduction consisted of calculating the percent weight change from the initial weight for the 2 5     untreated and treated pieces of skin.<br>
The reported data was the difference between each treated piece and its corresponding untreated<br>
piece. Results are recorded in Table XII.<br><br>

10 	Evident from the results is that the sorbitol monoquat was not only effective for moisturizing at relatively high humidity but also exceptional at relatively low humidity. These results were especially significant relative to glycerin which is normally used for moisturization purposes in cosmetic formulations.<br>

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Herein is provided a synthesis procedure for the chloride salt of hydroxypropyltrimonium sorbitol (also referred to as 'Sorbitol Monoquat’). A round bottom 250 ml flask was fitted with a mechanical<br>
20 	stirrer. Into the flask was charged a mixture of sorbitol (10 g, 55.0 mmol) and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride (Quat 188®) (15 ml, 55.0 mmol). One molar sodium hydroxide (55.0 ml, 55.0 mmol) was then added to the charged mixture. The resultant solution was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. Water was then removed under reduced pressure at 50°C yielding a heterogeneous colorless syrup.   Filtration through glass wool afforded sorbitol<br>
2 5      hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride as a homogeneous clear syrup: m/z (ESI; M+ CI") 298.<br><br>
