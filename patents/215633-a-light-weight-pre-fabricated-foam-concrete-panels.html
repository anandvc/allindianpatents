				<td>PRE  FABRICATED  LIGHT  HEIGHT  FORM CONCRETE PANELS FIELD OF INVENTION;<br>
The present invention relates to Light Weight preâ€”fabricated foam concrete panels and method of manufacture thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is known in the art to provide paneling materials with a core of gypsum having different type of facings. Also known in the art are panels with synthetic foams having different types of facings. The aforesaid panels are attended with one or more disadvantages such as low impact value, limited fire resistance or highly porous facia.<br>
It is also known in the art to have high density panels of a core with cemetitious<br>
In accordance with the method of the present invention, the fibre cement sheets are held rigidly in a jig kept seperated by using suitable separators, allowed to set and form into single composite panel, the in-situ panel so prepared being separated from the jigs after initial air curing such as after 10 to 24 hours after its manufacture and then subjected to humid/high pressure steam curing in conventional manner and finished before being despatched.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the foaming agent can be any protein hydrolisat ion based stable foaming agent or any other stable foam genterating agents.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the facing sheets have plain surface.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment, the facing sheets have rough profi1es/grooves on inner-surface so as to increase the surface area and improve locking and bonding between core and said facings.<br>
The  facing   sheets  are fibre   cement   sheets, gypsum    boards,   particle   boards   cement    bonded particle  boards and/or  metalic  sheets and  the  like.<br>
The pre-fabricated foam concrete panel has anhydrous sypsum present in amount of 0-15/4, and lime present to the amount of 0-20/4 of the total weight of the solids in the said composite core mix. The pozzolonic material is pulverised flyash having surface area preferably 2OOO-60OO cm2/gm.<br>
Specifically, in accordance with the invention stable foam is generated and mixed with cementitious slurry prepared from a mixture of water, portland cement, pulverised flyash, fine silica sand alongwith low density aggregates provided in any<br>
combination. Foam slurry so prepared is poured in between two facing sheets held in zig and separated from zig after air curing subjected to finishing. The stable foam is produced by passing through foam generator/gun, a mixture of foaming agent diluted in the water. Stable foaming agent used include Saponin, Peptine, alubumin, soap bark, water soluble cellulose ethers, hydrates cellulose dispersions, alkyInapthanlene sulfonates, stabilized soaps or hydrolyzed proteins other foam stabilizer such as benotonite may be added to enhance the stability of the foam.<br>
A foamed cementitious slurry is first prepared using foam generators/ gun using protein hydrolisation based foaming agents such as SKW foaming agent I or Neopore foaming agent or any other foaming agent described above diluted with water in container at any suitable ratio, such as 1:40 by volume or any commercially recommended ratio and passing it through foam generator. The foams so generated is stable and<br><br>
is not disturbed during mixing conveying or casting. The density of foams in foam generator is adjusted so that bulk density is in the range of 2O to 100 gm/m3. The foam so generated is throughly mixed in mixers with cementitions slurry made from water 3O to 6O7. of the total weight of the solids of the core mix, mixed with 1OO parts of solids comprising 0 to '20%. of low density aggregate such as exfoiated vermiculate and/or per lite 0-70X pozzolonic material such as pulverised flyash reminder being portland cement. The foamed composite slurry so prepared is poured in between two facing sheets, such as fibre cement sheets which are held rigidly in zig kept separated by 25 to 100 mm using suitable separators, and allowed to set and form into single composite panel. The panel so prepared are separated from the zigs after initial air curing say after 10 to 24 hours after its? manufacture and then subjected to humid/high pressure steam curing in conventional manner and finished before being despatched.<br>
I I   Ttae  panels  so  prepared  are of  light   weight,  have good, impact  &amp;  f lexural  strength,  good  water &amp; fire   resistance  and have  good  sound   insulation properties-<br><br><br>
