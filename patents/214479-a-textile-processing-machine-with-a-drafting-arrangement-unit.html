				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a textile processing machine for the processing of textile fibres, with the fibre blend formed after the processing being delivered to a downstream drafting arrangement unit, with at least two stages, for the formation of an even sliver and a measurement member being provided between the first and second drafting arrangement stage for the detection of the fibre material joined after the first drafting arrangement stage and the measuring signal issued by the measurement member to the control unit being used for"the intervention in the drive of the second drafting arrangement stage for compensating short-term fluctuations in mass in relationship to the predetermined setpoint values, with the long-term flunctuations in mass in the fibre blend as detected by the measurement member being compensated in the zone after the measurement member. The term "after the measurement member" shall be interpreted as being in connection with the conveying direction of the fibre blend.<br>
A combing machine is disclosed in EP-B1 376 002 wherein the combing units are provided downstream with an autoleveller draw frame in which an even sliver is formed from the fibre material supplied by the individual combing heads, which sliver is then deposited by way of a coiling apparatus in a receptacle. A measurement member is arranged upstream of the autoleveller draw frame for the detection of the fibre mass supplied to the downstream drafting arrangement. Said measurement member detects the unevenness of the supplied fibre mass and triggers a control intervention in the drive unit in conjunction with a comparison with a setpoint value in order to compensate respective unevenness in the fibre mass by a respective change in the draft.<br><br>
In order to intercept control interventions in the zone of the feed roller of the drafting arrangement, it is hereby proposed to provide a sliver storage between the draw-in roller and the combing apparatuses.<br>
The desire for increasingly higher production rates automatically leads to an increase of the processing speed of the fibre mateial and also to higher requirements placed on the measurement "member in order to detefct any occurring fluctuations in mass. This is the case in particular when the piecing places of the fibre material supplied by the combing apparatuses have to be detected by the measurement member.<br>
That is why it was proposed in EP-A2 799 916 to provide the autoleveller draw frame, which is downstream of the combing apparatuses, with two stages. It is provided for in this device to detect the sliver mass which is reduced by the first drafting process between the two drafting arrangement stages. This allows an improved and preciser detection of short-term mass fluctuations (e.g. piecing places) which occur on a short-term basis in the sliver mass which is thinned out after the first drafting arrangement stage in order to provide a fluctuation control in the second drafting arrangement stage. The fluctuation control of the long-term mass fluctuations ocurrs after the second drafting arrangement stage by a change of the rotational speed of the pair of delivery rollers of the first drafting arrangement stage. As a result of the provided drive connections, the drive of the coiling apparatus as well as the drive of the two rear pairs of rollers of the second drafting arrangement stage are motionally coupled by the control interventions of the long-term fluctuation control.<br>
Similarly, the rotational speed of the pair of delivery rollers of the second drafting arrangement stage must be followed up, so that the drafting conditions in the second drafting arrangement stage are thus not changed. This places higher demands on-the control unit of the second drafting arrangement stage, since the disturbances in the mass (e.g. piecing places) which occur here on a short-term basis have to be compensated.<br><br>
The invention therefore has the object o.f improving known devices in order to obtain an apparatus to allow the production of a high-quality and even sliver with simple and inexpensive means.<br>
This object is achieved in such a way that the rotational speed of the pair of feed rollers of the second drafting arrangement stage is controlled according to the signal of the measurement member and a sliver storage is provided between the drafting arrangement units.<br>
This allows intercepting short-term fluctuations in the delivery speed of the sliver mass and, optionally, also long-term fluctuations in the sliver storage, thus avoiding any follow-up of the combing machine drive or the drive of the sliver coiling. This arrangement similarly ensures an optimal fluctuation control of short-term mass fluctuations (e.g. piecing places), as they can be detected better by the measurement of the reduced fibre mass.<br>
The proposal that the pair of delivery rollers of the first drafting arrangement stage is driven by a controllable drive and the pair of feed rollers is coupled with the drive of the textile machine allows keeping constant the drafting tension of textile material between the textile machine and the drafting arrangement unit.<br>
It is further proposed that the drive motor of the textile processing machine and the drive motor of the pair of input rollers of the first drafting arrangement stage are triggered by way of a common frequency converter.<br>
This ensures an even drafting tension in the fibre mass between the textile processing machine (e.g. combing machine) and the downstream first drafting arrangement unit. This leads to the consequence that no further storage is required between the textile-processing machine and the first drafting arrangement unit.<br>
Preferably, the drive of the pair of input rollers can be coupled directly with the gear of the textile-processing machine.<br><br>
It is further proposed that the drafting arrangement units are each driven by a separate drive motor.<br>
This ensures the application of a well-structured and secure drive system.<br>
In order to mutually fine-tune the drive it is proposed that the drive motor of the textile-processing machine is arranged as the master motor (master) for the drive motor of the pair of delivery rollers of the first drafting arrangement stage and the drive motor of the second drafting arrangement stage. These drive motors are followed up as "slaves" to the master motor, particularly with respect to a base speed.<br>
It is further proposed to arrange the textile-processing machine as a combing machine, with the lap rollers of the combing heads being driven with a separate drive motor whose rotational speed is controlled according to the signal of the measurement member. Such an arrangement for controlling drifts in the fibre mass has already been described in EP-PS 558 719. This allows performing the long-term control directly on the combing machine.<br>
It is further proposed that a coiling apparatus for the formed sliver is provided downstream of the second drafting arrangement unit and the drive of the coiling apparatus is coupled with the drive of the second drafting arrangement unit. Said coupling is performed in particular with the drive of the pair of delivery rollers of the second drafting arrangement unit. Constant drive conditions can thus be maintained.<br>
It is further proposed that the storage between the two drafting arrangement units is equipped with a monitoring device which is connected with the control unit of the drive motor of the second drafting arrangement unit.<br>
It is proposed that the control unit of the drive motor of the second drafting arrangement unit or the base speed of the second drafting arrangement unit can be overdriven by the signal of the monitoring device of the storage. Once the sliver loop is detected by a sensor, the correction of the speed of the drive motor can occur in steps (e.g. in steps of 3 % of the<br><br>
speed) until the loop is back in the tolerance range again. A timing element can also be provided which cuts off the machine when the loop is located outside of the tolerance range for a longer period than a predetermined interval.<br>
One thus obtains an additional security device, particularly in cases when the storage filling (e.g. the sag in the storage) tends to drift to either the one or the other side. This can have different reasons, e.g. when the follow-up of the drive motor of the second drafting arrangement unit to the drive motor of the textile-processing machine is impaired by a possible malfunction.<br>
The storage means between the drafting arrangement units can be arranged as a sag storage, with at least one scanning element -being provided in order to detect the sagging of the sliver.<br>
To ensure that the sliver guided through the measurement member is placed under a constant drafting tension it is proposed that a further pair of rollers is arranged between the storage means and the measurement member whose drive is directly coupled with the pair of feed rollers of the second drafting arrangement stage. This excludes that control interventions will have an effect on the measurement process.<br>
For security reasons it is further proposed that a monitoring element for the supplied sliver is arranged between the sliver coiler and the second drafting arrangement stage. Said monitoring element more or less constitutes a final check instrument before the sliver is deposited in a downstream can. The monitoring element is equipped with an extreme range or a tolerance zone. Once the supplied sliver is outside of this tolerance zone, the entire installation will be switched off. It is understood that timing elements can also be provided which stop the function of the monitoring element over a specific period of time. This will be particularly necessary when the textile-processing machine is started with a new batch of material and needs to be newly pieced. Instead of a timing element it would also be possible to perform the activation of this monitoring element manually.<br><br>
It is further proposed that the coiling apparatus is driven by way of a separate electric drive motor which is controlled with the drive motor of the second drafting arrangement stage by way of a common frequency converter.<br>
Further advantages of the present invention are explained by reference to the following illustrated and described embodiments, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic side view of a combing machine with an arrangement of a downstream drafting arrangement unit as proposed in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a further embodiment in the guidance of the drive according to fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic side view of a further embodiment in accordance with fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of a diagram which is obtained by the measuring results of the measurement member;<br>
Fig. 5 shows an enlarged partial sectional view in accordance with figs. 1 to 3, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a schematic reduced partial view according to the embodiment of fig. 1 with an altered guidance for the drive of the can coiler.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the longitudinal part of a combing machine 1 on which rest wound laps 4 for unwinding and combing out by downstream combing devices. Usually, eight such wound laps are placed on a combing machine for unwinding. The slivers formed in the individual combing heads are joined on a delivery table FT (indicated schematically) on the longitudinal part 2 into a sliver bunch 8 and supplied in the conveying direction F to a first drafting arrangement stage I of a drafting arrangement unite.<br><br>
The slivers supplied by the individual combing head usually have a count or sliver mass of approx. 8 g/m, with the sliver bunch 8 made of eight slivers being present in a total mass of 64 g/m. Said sliver mass is subjected in the drafting arrangement stage I to a five-fold draft for example, thus reducing the fibre mass delivered from drafting arrangement stage I to approx. 12 g/m.<br>
In the illustrated examples of fig. 1 to 3 the drafting arrangement stages I and II are each represented in a simplified manner only with one drafting zone or with only two successive pairs of rollers. In many embodiments a predrafting zone is provided upstream of the main drafting zone, which accordingly requires a further pair of rollers as was also shown in EP-A 2 799 916, for example. In such an embodiment the preliminary draft or the speed ratio of the rear two pairs of rollers is kept consant in the feed control (drafting arrangement stage II), whereas the speed of the two pairs of rollers is changed simultaneously with respect to the forward, constantly revolving pair of rollers (during the control intervention).<br>
The draft in the first drafting arrangement stage I occurs between the pair of feed rollers 10 and the pair of delivery rollers 11. The respective lower rollers of these pairs of rollers are connected with a drive. Accordingly, the pair of feed rollers 10 is driven by a motor M2 by way of a gear 13. The motor M2 is connected by way of a control line 14 with a frequency converter 20 which is controlled by a control unit S. A main motor Ml is also triggered by the frequency converter 20 through line 16, which motor drives a combing machine 1 by way of a gear 17. The drive of the lower roller of the pair of delivery rollers 11 occurs by a motor M3 and a gear 24, with motor M3 being connected with the control unit S by way of control line 26. A further pair of rollers 5 is provided downstream of the pair of delivery rollers 11, which further pair of rollers is coupled with the drive of the pair of rollers 11 by way of path 36. The pair of rollers 5 represents the pair of input rollers to a downstream sliver storage means 3. The pairs of rollers 10, 11 are each assigned a speed sensor 18 and 22, respectively, which emit their signals to the control unit S by way of lines 19 and 39, respectively.<br><br>
The sliver storage means 3 is arranged as a sag storage and is provided at its output with a further pair of rollers 40. For the purpose of scanning the sag the storage means 3 is equipped with sensors S1 and S2 which each monitor the position of the sliver loop FS. The sensors S1 and S2 are connected with the control unit S by way of line 35. The drive of the pair of rollers 40 is tapped via drive path 27 from the drive path 38 which is responsible for the controlled drive of the pair of feed rollers 42 of the downstream drafting arrangemen stage II.<br>
The pair of rollers 40 is provided downstream with a measurement member 30 which sends its determined signals to the control unit S through path 31. The measurement member can be equipped with an inductive measurement transducer or with grooved rollers. The second drafting arrangement stage II is arranged downstream of the measurement member 30, which stage is provided with a pair of feed rollers 42 and a pair of delivery rollers 43. The lower roller of the pair of feed rollers 42 is driven by way of a differential gear 45 which is connected with a gear 47. The differential gear 45 can be overdriven by a servomotor M4. The servomotor M4 is controlled by the control unit S via control line 48. The drive of the lower roller of the pair of rollers 43 occurs via a drive path 37 from gear 47 which is driven by motor M5. The -motor M5 is connected with the control unit S via control line 70.<br>
The drive of gear 50 occurs via drive path 52 by gear 47, by which the calender rollers 53, the funnel wheel 54 and the can plate 55 of a coiling apparatus 60 are driven via the schematically shown drive path 51. The drive paths are only shown schematically. The illustration of further transmission or reduction elements were omitted for reasons of clarity of the illustration.<br>
In the coiling apparatus 60, which is also known as can coiler, the formed sliver 9 is deposited in a can K.<br>
A monitoring element 57 is additionally arranged between the pair of delivery rollers 43 of the second drafting arrangement stage II and the calender rollers 53 of the can coiler 60, which monitoring element is connected with the control unit S by way of path 58. Said monitoring<br><br>
element 57 is instructed with stopping the entire machine when the sliver mass is located outside of a predetermined tolerance spectrum.<br>
The operation of the installation pursuant to fig. 1 is as follows:<br>
The sliver bunch 8 as supplied by combing machine 1 is fed to the drafting arrangement stage I and is subjected there to a five-fold draft, for example. The rotational speeds of the pairs of rollers 10 and 11 are scanned by the speed sensors 18 and 22 and sent to the control unit S. The synchronism between the combing machine units and the pair of feed rollers 10 is ensured by triggering the motor Ml and motor M2 by way of the same frequency converter 20, thus maintaining an even draft tension in the sliver bunch 8. The drive motor Ml for the combing machine represents the "master" for the setting of the basic speed of the system. The motor M3 for the drive of the first drafting arrangement stage I and the motor M5 for the drive of the second drafting arrangement stage II and the can coiler 60 are followed up as "slaves" with a predetermined basic speed ratio to the drive motor by way of control unit S. The ratio between the motors M1 and M3 that has been established at the start is changed by the amount of the control intervention in motor M3, with this deviation being added (with positive or negative sign) to the still existing follow-up of the basic speed of motor MS. The fibre fleece 28 formed in the first drafting arrangement stage I is joined into a sliver 12 and reaches the sliver storage means 29 by way of the pair of rollers 5. The sliver is guided herein in a sagging manner as a loop FS and is drawn off from said storage means 29 by the pair of rollers 40. The position of the loop FS is monitored by the sensors S1 and S2. Once one of the sensors SI and S2 detects the sliver loop FS, a signal is sent to the control unit S through line 35. Depending on the type of the signal (loop moves outside of the sensor range upwardly or downwardly) the basic speed of the motor M5 is changed in a respective manner and thus also the draw-off speed of the pair of rollers 40. This changed speed of motor MS is maintained until the loop is positioned again within the range of the two sensors SI and S2. If a return is not possible, a malfunction is present within the entire system and the installation (combing machine 1 and the drafting arrangement unit 6) is stopped. This can occur by way of a timing element (not shown) which is integrated in the control unit S and is instructed with monitoring<br><br>
the time in which the sliver loop FS is located outside of the range of sensors S1 and S2. If a predetermined time is exceeded, this will lead to the aforementioned cutout of the system.<br>
Should the fault be an erroneously supplied sliver count for example, the wrong material can be separated to a receptacle B after the pair of rollers 5 (as is shown in fig. 5, for example), namely until a predetermined supply of fibre material is ensured again. The sliver storage means 3 could be provided with a closable delivery opening (not shown).<br>
The values determined in the measurement member are supplied via path 31 to the control unit S and compared there with a setpoint value (setpoint). The deviations (long-term) concerning the adherence to the sliver count are determined by the control unit S and, depending on the amount of the deviation, respective control pulses are sent to motor M3 for changing the speed of the pair of delivery rollers 11. The thus resulting changes in the conveying speed of the sliver 12 are intercepted by the sagging of the sliver loop FS in storage means 3. The follow-up of the basic speed of motor M5 during the detection of the altered loop FS by sensors SI and S2 has already been described above. The change of the draft betwen rollers 10 and 11 in the first drafting arrangement stage I is used for returning the sliver mass to a predetermined setpoint value within a tolerance range. The scanning of the speeds by sensors 18 and 22 of the pairs of rollers 10 and 11 is used for monitoring and maintaining predetermined draft ratios and thus determines the drive ratio of the motors M3 to the motors M1 and M2. Ml is carried as a "master" to which the motors M3 and M5 are followed-up as "slaves" with respect to the basic speed. Following the passage through the measurement member 30, the sliver 12 reaches the drafting zone of the second drafting stage II between the pairs of rollers 42 and 43. The draft ratio between these two pairs of rollers of the second drafting arrangement stage can be influenced by the differential gear 45 which is overdriven by the servomotor M4. This overdrive occurs whenever the short-term fluctuations as determined by the measurement member 30 are located outside of a predetermined tolerance range and must be corrected. Servomotor M4 receives its control pulses via path 48 and changes the speed of the pair of feed rollers 42 of the second drafting arrangement<br><br>
stage II via the gear 45. Highly dynamical servomotors are used for this control intervention. The application of the control occurs with a time delay. This means it is necessary to consider the time which the measured place to be corrected of the sliver 12 has covered from the measurement member 30 up to a control application point between the pairs of rollers 42 and 43.<br>
The interventions in the conveying speed of the sliver as originate by the change in the speed of the pair of rollers 42 are intercepted retroactively by the storage means 3. Since the speeds of the pair of rollers 40 and the pair of feed rollers 42 coincide, the draft tension of the sliver in the measurement member 30, which is located between these two pairs of rollers, remains the same or constant. This does not lead to any additional disturing influences on the actual measuring process.<br>
The sliver 9 formed in the second drafting arrangement stage II reaches the calender rollers 53 of a can coiler 60 by way of a monitoring member 57 where it is deposited in the form of a loop through a funnel wheel 54 in a can K.<br>
The embodiment of fig. 2 shows a similar device as in fig. 1, with a mechanical coupling of the drive being present instead of the electric coupling of the two motors M1 and M2 by way of the frequency converter 20. The drive of the feed rollers 10 of the first drafting arrangement stage is tapped directly from the gear 17 of the combing machine via the drive path 15. This ensures a constant drive ratio. The other devices correspond to the example of fig. 1 and-have already been described there. Additional speed monitoring for the two pairs of rollers 10 and 11 has not been provided for in this case because there is a fixed mechanical coupling of feed roller 10.<br>
The passage of the sliver mass through the drafting arrangement unit 6 and the performance of the control interventions correspond substantially to the sequence as already explained above in connection with the embodiment in accordance with fig. 1.<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment where the drafting arrangement stage I operates with a constantly working draft. This means there is no control intervention to compensate long-term drifts in the sliver mass. The drive of the drafting arrangement stage I occurs here by motor M3 which drives a gear 24 from which the drive connections 23 and 29 to the pairs of rollers 10 and 11 are guided. Drive path 36 is tapped from drive path 29 which performs a fixed drive coupling between the pairs of rollers 11 and 5. The units as are provided downstream of the pair of rollers 5 correspond substantially to those as described in connection with the embodiment of fig. 1, with reference hereby being made to the same. A combing head 7 (out of a total of 8 combing heads) of combing machine 1 is schematically shown behind the pair of feed rollers 10. The combing head 7 is illustrated with a 90° turning in the horizontal with respect to the downstream drafting arrangement unit 6, which is shown in particular in the illustration of the sliver bunch 8 in the triangular form.<br>
In this embodiment the compensation of the long-term deviation in mass (see fig. 5) occurs by changing the speed of the lap rollers 58 and 59 which are driven by the gear 62 or the drive motor MW via the drive path 61. The drive motor MW receives its control pulses via line 77 from the control unit S and is readjusted according to the signal of the measurement member 30. The change of the speeds of the lap rollers 58 and 59 also lead to a change in the draft tension of lap W which is unwound from the wound lap 4 and is supplied to the downstream nipper unit 63. The nipper unit 63 is driven by the main motor Ml via the gear 17 and the drive path 66. The control of the drive motor Ml is performed through control line 16 by a frequency converter 20 which also triggers the aforementioned drive motor M3.<br>
The drive of a circular comb 64 is also performed by gear 17 via drive path 65 and the drive of the pair of detaching rollers 67 which is downstream of the nipper unit via drive path 68. The fibre fleece 71 supplied by the pair of detaching rollers 67 (usually two such detaching rollers are arranged behind one another) is transferred via a table 72 for nonwovens to a funnel 75 in which a sliver is formed from the fleece 71. This sliver is deposited on a schematically shown conveyor table FT and forms a sliver bunch 8 with the slivers supplied by the other combing heads, which<br><br>
bunch is transferred to the pair of feed rollers 10 of the downstream drafting arrangement unit I.<br>
The term that the long-term fluctuations in mass in the fibre mixture are compensated in the zone "behind" the measurement member relates to the conveying direction F.<br>
By changing the speed of the lap rollers 58 and 59 on the basis of the signal of the measurement member 30 the draft tension of the lap W is changed between lap roller 59 and the downstream nipper unit 63, thus changing the amount of the supplied sliver mass. Further information on this change of drift is disclosed in the published EP-558 719. The control interventions in the second drafting arrangement stage II as well as the follow-up of the basic speed of drive motor M5 on the basis of the sensors of the sliver storage means 3 correspond to the embodiment in accordance with fig. 1, so that further discussion will be omitted.<br>
With this embodiment a device is obtained which allows compensating long-term fluctuations already with existing devices. The drafting arrangement stage I can be operated with a constant draft ratio.<br>
It is understood that further variants in the guidance of the drive are possible which can serve to implement the principle of the invention.<br>
Fig. 4 shows on the basis of an evaluation diagram of a measured sliver 12 what the terms of short-term and long-term fluctuations in mass actually mean. Mass m is entered over time t. The short-term fluctuations in mass (e.g. by piecing places in the combing machine) produce certain peaks in the diagram, but move essentially about the horizontal tolerance field T. If there is a long-term drift of the sliver mass, the tolerance field T drifts from the horizontal plane, as is schematically indicated by the shaded area. This long-term drift of the sliver does not occur in sudden bursts (with the exception of a sliver breakage), but moves over a longer period. This means that the adjustment of such a long-term drift does not require any highly dynamic re-adjustment of the drive of the drafting cylinders.<br><br>
Fig. 6 shows a reduced partial sectional view in accordance with the figs.<br>
1 to 3 with an altered drive setup for the can coiler 60. The drive of the<br>
gear 50 occurs by a separate drive motor M6 which is controlled by a<br>
