COMPLETE SPECIFICATION	<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
BEVERAGE BREWING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR BREWING A BEVERAGE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED   14-06-2007<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a beverage brewing system and a method for brewing a beverage.  More particularly, the present invention is directed to a brewing system having a means for heating a beverage extract, whereby the beverage extract is heated to above about ambient temperature before being mixed with water in the beverage brewing system.  The present .invention is also directed to a method for making a substantially homogeneous beverage.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods for the preparation of instant beverages, like instant tea beverages, are known.  For example, many food establishments have brewing systems that dispense tea-based beverages ready for consumption.  Typically, such systems operate by mixing a tea extract or component with hot water to produce a hot composition that is combined with cold water to thereby produce a tea beverage that is ready to drink.<br>
Unfortunately, however, when preparing such tea beverages, the tea beverages that are produced by conventional tea brewing systems are not always homogeneous.  For instance, many conventional tea-brewing systems produce tea beverages having, suspended therein, particles of undissolved extract.  Tea beverages with undissolved particles do not look very desirable to the consumer, and almost invariably, do not taste as good as a<br><br>
5  substantially homogenous tea (i.e., a tea having fully dissolved extract).<br>
It is of increasing interest to develop a beverage brewing system and method for brewing a beverage that result in a<br>
10  substantially homogeneous beverage.  This invention, therefore,<br>
is directed to a beverage brewing system and method for brewing a beverage that employ a heating means to heat extract prior to mixing the extract with water to thereby produce a substantially homogenous beverage.<br>
15<br>

A mixture of the heated beverage extract and heated solvent may be mixed with solvent that has not been heated to provide the<br>
10  beverage to be consumed.  The solvent that has not been heated is typically any liquid that may be used in a beverage.  Preferably, the liquid is water and at a temperature from 2.0 degrees centigrade to 30.0 degrees centigrade, and most preferably, water at about the temperature of tap water. Preferably the amount of<br>
15  heated solvent is less than 45%, preferably less than 30% of the total amount of solvent used to make the beverage. As to the conduit that may be used to supply or deliver solvent that has not been heated, such a conduit is also made of materials similar to those described for delivering the solvent.<br>
20<br>
Turning to the figures, Figure 1 shows a beverage brewing machine 10 comprising the beverage brewing system of the present invention (not shown).  The beverage brewing machine 10 may be used, for example, to dispense a tea-based beverage (not shown)<br>
25  from exit port 12.<br>
Figure 2 depicts an illustrative schematic diagram of the brewing system 14 of the present invention which may be found within the beverage brewing machine 10, the brewing system 14<br>
30  being fed solvent from, for example, a storage container having a pump, or from tap (both not shown). Solvent feed conduit 16 supplies, for example, feed solvent (e.g., water) 16a to solvent heater tank 18 to produce heated solvent 18a.  Conduit for supplying heated solvent 20 joins, for example, with conduit for<br>
35  supplying heated beverage extract 22 at mixing conduit 24. Non-heated extract 26, in extract reservoir 27, is pumped, via food grade pump 28, through conduit for supplying heated beverage extract 22 which comprises a heating means 3 0 (which is of a size<br><br><br>
5   to ensure that the non-seated extract is heated to about the<br>
temperature of the heated solvent) which surrounds (jackets) or is positioned near the conduit for supplying heated beverage extract 22 and heats the non-heated extract 26 to produce heated extract 26a which mixes with heated solvent 18a in mixing conduit<br>
10  24 to produce a heated solvent and heated extract mixture 32. The mixture 32 is transported via mixture conduit 34 where conduit for supplying solvent that has not been heated 3 6 optionally supplies non heated solvent 3 8 (supplied from a storage container having a pump, or tap, both not shown) into<br>
15  mixture 32 to produce a beverage 40 ready to be discharged at opening 42 by way of exit port 12.<br>
Figure 3 shows heating means 44 placed within conduit for supplying heated beverage extract 22 and mixing conduit 24. 20  Heating means 44 may be used, for example, in lieu of or addition to heating means 30, and is of a length and width (or diameter) to ensure that enough heat is passed to the non-heated extract to heat the same to about the temperature of the heated solvent.<br>
25       Regarding the heating means illustrated by heating means 3 0 and heating means 44, the former attaches to the conduit for supplying heated beverage extract 22 and can comprise heating coils surrounded by insulation whereby current is fed to the heating coils to heat the conduit for supplying heated beverage<br>
3 0  extract 22 to thereby heat non-heated extract 26 to produce heated extract 26a.  The latter is typically a metal, like a stainless steel rod or pipe that may be heated by supplying it with current and also, by contacting it with heated solvent 18a if desired.  Heating means 44 attached to conduit 22 with a<br>
35  fixing means 26b (which tnay be a screw or bracket) may be solid such that heated extract 26a surrounds it, or hollow such that heated extract may surround and go through heating means 44.  It is noted herein that heating means 3 0 may be moved anywhere<br><br><br><br>
5  within the Brewing system 14, as long as non-heated extract 26 is heated by the same. Therefore, heating means 30 may, if desired, be moved closer to or around extract reservoir 27. It is further noted that since heating means 44 is supplied with current (e.g., from current coming into beverage brewing machine 10) , it may be<br>
10  moved within the brewing system 14 to any position that will<br>
allow for non-heated extract 26 to become heated.  Therefore, for example, heating means 44 is shown in Figure 3 positioned with a portion in mixing conduit 24 and a portion in conduit for supplying heated beverage extract 22.  This position is<br>
15  especially preferred when heated solvent 18a is one of the<br>
sources of heat to heating means 44.  Such a position, however, is not required and heating means 44, the heating, means 44 may be placed within, for example, the conduit for supplying heated beverage extract 22, the extract reservoir 27, or both.<br>
20<br>
Figure 4 depicts an especially preferred embodiment of present invention whereby the heating means 46 is an extension or portion of the conduit for supplying heated extract 22 that extends into mixing conduit 24.  Heated solvent 18a heats heating<br>
25  means 46 which in turn conducts heat through conduit for<br>
supplying heated extract 22  to heat non-heated extract 26 to produce heated extract 26a which may be passed through heating means exit 46a prior to being mixed with heated solvent 18a.<br>
30       It is noted herein that Figure 4 illustrates that heating means 46 may eject or expel heated extract 26a in the direction of heated solvent 18a.  Optionally, however, heating means 46 may eject heated extract 26a against the direction of heated solvent 18a (not shown) in addition to or in lieu of ejecting heated<br>
35  extract 26a in the direction of heated solvent 18a.<br>
The amount of heating means 46 extending into heated solvent 18a is limited only to the extent that enough of the<br><br><br>
5  heating means-46 contacts the heated solvent 18a such that non-heated extract 26 can be transformed in to a heated extract 26a having a temperature that is at about the temperature of the heated solvent 18a. - Moreover, the heating means 46 can be coiled (not shown) or have heating fins applied thereon (not shown) in 10  -order to increase the surface area of the heating means 46 to allow greater, contact with heated solvent 18a.<br>
When making a beverage, like a tea-based beverage, with the system of the present invention, the beverage typically comprises<br>
15  at least 80.0%, and preferably, at least 85.0%, and most<br>
preferably, at least 90.0% by weight total solvent (i.e., total solvent being the total amount of heated and non-heated solvent),  the balance of the total weight of the beverage comprising no  less than 0.1% by weight extract, and preferably, no less than<br>
20  1.0% by weight extract.  The total amount of solvent used can comprise 100.0% heated solvent, but preferably comprises less than 45.0%, and most preferably, less than 30.0% by weight heated solvent and at least 1.0% by weight heated solvent. Moreover, the beverage typically exits the beverage brewing machine from the<br>
25   exit port at a flow rate from 1.0 to 5.0 US fluid ounces/second<br>
(29.6 to.148 ml/second)/ and preferably, from 1.5 to 4.0 US fluid ounces/second (44.4 to 118 ml/second), and most preferably, from 2.0 to 3.0 US fluid ounces/second (59.2 to 88.7 ml/second), including, all ranges subsumed therein.<br>
30<br>
Sweeteners (e.g., sugar), ice or both may be added to the beverage via any conventional means at amounts conventionally found in beverages suitable for consumption by humans.<br>
35       The following Example is provided to facilitate an<br>
understanding of the present invention.  The Example is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
5  Example<br>
Conduit for supplying heated beverage extract may be submerged in a vessel of hot water.  Tea extract may be heated by pumping the extract through the conduit for supplying heated<br>
10  beverage extract which is submerged in the hot water.  About 1.0% by weight of heated extract, which may be heated to about 80 degrees centigrade, may be pumped and mixed with about 20.0% by weight water at about 80 degrees centigrade and about 80.0% by weight water at about tap water temperature to produce a tea-<br>
15  based beverage.  The resulting tea-based beverage will be substantially homogeneous and free of visible particles of undissolved extract. Moreover, the tea-based beverage made via the present invention will look more appealing and taste better than tea-based beverages that have not been made by first heating<br>
20  the tea extract.<br><br><br>
