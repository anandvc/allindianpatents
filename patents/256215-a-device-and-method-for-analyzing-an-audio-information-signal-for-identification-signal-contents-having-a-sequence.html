The present invention relates to signal analysis and<br>
particularly to signal analysis for the purpose of<br>
identification of signal content.<br>
In order to archive the ever increasing stock of audio and<br>
video material, establish databases that are easy to search<br>
or distribute them via various ways of distribution,<br>
automatic information recognition systems are necessary<br>
that assist to identify audio and video material or, more<br>
generally, information material unambiguously based on the<br>
contents.<br>
One application for this is the so-called "broadcast<br>
monitoring". With the help of such an audio-video<br>
monitoring system, it is for example intended to ensure<br>
that only legal contents are distributed or that the<br>
respective royalties for the right holders of the audio and<br>
video material are paid correctly.<br>
A further application is, for example, the recognition of<br>
audio material that is to be exchanged between partners via<br>
peer-to-peer networks.<br>
A further application is the monitoring possibility for the<br>
advertising industry to monitor a television or radio<br>
station as to whether the booked advertising times have<br>
really been broadcast, or whether only parts of the booked<br>
advertising share have been broadcast, or whether parts of<br>
the commercials have been disturbed during transmission,<br>
which may, for example, be the responsibility of the<br>
television or radio station. At this point, it is to be<br>
noted that particularly the costs for television<br>
commercials in popular programs at good broadcasting tines<br>
are so high that the advertising industry, particularly in<br><br>
view of these high costs, has a vital interest in a<br>
monitoring possibility, so that they do not merely have to<br>
trust the word of the broadcasting stations. Currently, the<br>
monitoring possibility is based on paid "test hearers" or<br>
"test viewers", who continuously watch a certain television<br>
program and record, for example, the exact times at which a<br>
commercial is transmitted, and who further monitor whether,<br>
during the transmission, there has been no disturbance, or<br>
whether the whole commercial has been transmitted<br>
correctly, i.e. whether there has been no picture<br>
distortion, etc.<br>
The disadvantages of this concept are evident. On the one<br>
hand, the costs are significant and, on the other hand, the<br>
reliability or strength of evidence of statements of test<br>
hearers and/or test viewers is problematic, particularly if<br>
considerable repayment demands are made that solely depend<br>
on test watchers with regard to their provability.<br>
Various known systems may be used for automated broadcast<br>
monitoring. For example, WO 02/11123 A2 or the specialist<br>
publication: "Invited Talk: An Industrial-Strength Audio<br>
Search Algorithm", Avery Wang, ISMIR 2003, Baltimore,<br>
October 2003, disclose systems and methods for recognizing<br>
audio and music signals in an environment of strong noise<br>
and high distortions. A first step is an examination<br>
whether there is a match between hash values of a reference<br>
audio object and the currently determined hash value of the<br>
audio object still unidentified. If this is the case, the<br>
associated time offset, i.e. the relative distance from the<br>
beginning of the audio object, of the hash value in the<br>
still unidentified audio object and the time offset of the<br>
hash value in the reference audio object is stored under<br>
the respective identification of the reference audio<br>
object. When all input hash values have been processed, a<br>
so-called scanning phase starts. During this phase, there<br>
is an examination of how many time offset pairs per<br>
reference audio object time match continuously. If a<br><br>
certain number is detected, an identification of the<br>
corresponding reference audio object is assumed. The time<br>
offset pairs are considered to be continuous in time, i.e.<br>
temporally associated with each other, when they form a<br>
straight line in a two-dimensional scatter plot with one<br>
time offset as the x-coordinate and the other one as the y-<br>
coordinate.<br>
In the specialist publication "Robust Audio Hashing for<br>
Content Identification" by J. Haitsma, T. Kalker, J.<br>
Oostveen, in Proceedings of the Content-Based Multimedia<br>
Indexing, 2001, url:citeseer.ist.psu.edu/haitsma01robust.<br>
html, a system for robust audio hashing for content<br>
identification is presented. For content-based music<br>
recognition, a hash function is used that associates a bit<br>
sequence with a portion from an audio signal, namely such<br>
that audio signals acoustically similar for the human sound<br>
perception also generate a similar bit sequence. For the<br>
calculation of a hash value, the audio signal is first<br>
windowed and subjected,to a transform to finally perform a<br>
division of the transform result into frequency bands with<br>
logarithmic bandwidth. For these frequency bands, the signs<br>
of the differences in the time and frequency directions are<br>
determined. The bit sequence resulting from the signs<br>
constitutes the hash value. One hash value is always<br>
calculated for an audio signal length of 3 seconds. If the<br>
Hamming distance between a reference hash value and a test<br>
hash value to be examined for such a portion is below a<br>
threshold s, a match is assumed and the test portion is<br>
associated with the reference element.<br>
In order to perform a recognition of audio material, the<br>
audio signal is typically split into small units of length<br>
At. These individual units are each analyzed individually<br>
to have at least a certain time resolution.<br>
This causes several problems.<br><br>
The recognition results of the small analyzed time periods of the audio signal<br>
have to be put together so that an unambiguous correct statement on the<br>
recognized audio signal can be made for a longer time period.<br>
For the analysis of a continuous audio data stream, transitions from one audio<br>
element to another, i.e. a transition from a piece of music A to a piece of music<br>
B, should be detected correctly.<br>
There is further the situation in which there are several versions of a piece of<br>
music, which, for example, have the same beginning and only start to differ after<br>
a certain time. Just think of, for example, short versions or maxi versions of a<br>
song. Alternatively, there are also situations in which pieces of music that are<br>
based on the same song differ, for example, at the beginning, have an identical<br>
middle part and again differ from each other towards the end of at least one of<br>
the two pieces of music. For the payment of royalties to copyright holders, it may<br>
be important, whether, for example, the maxi version of a song may be played<br>
for a higher charge, whether only a normal version may be played for a medium<br>
charge, or whether, for a low charge, there may already be played the short<br>
version of a song. In this case, it should be possible to reliably distinguish several<br>
versions of a song.<br>
Prior art document XP002337265 discloses an apparatus for automatically<br>
identifying pieces of music which uses a Viterbi algorithm to provide a single<br>
identification result; the apparatus comprises a training phase, in which pieces of<br>
music are defined in a graphical model by series of nodes, and an identification<br>
phase, in which the most probable route through the graphical model is selected<br>
for a piece of music and an identification result is provided at the end of the<br>
procedure.<br><br>
This knows apparatus for automatically identifying pieces of music does not<br>
always correctly recognize transitions between audio elements, which means that<br>
a change or cross-fade from a piece of music A to a piece of music B is<br>
incorrectly analyzed.<br>
The above prior art is unsatisfactory in that it results in detection errors when<br>
the results of the individual recognitions are simply put together. In particular,<br>
no information is given as to whether and how a continuous audio data stream<br>
from several different audio objects may be analyzed, and how corresponding<br>
transitions between various audio objects may be detected. In addition, although<br>
particularly in the latter prior art the ambiguity of reference hash values is<br>
mentioned, no explicit solution for the problem of the determination of an<br>
unambiguous <br><br>
candidate is given. If an audio object is considered to be identified for a hash value, for<br>
the directly subsequent hash value there is only an examination whether it fits the<br>
identified audio object. If this is not the case, there is a new search including all<br>
reference audio objects.<br>
Particularly for distinguishing different versions of one and the same song, no solution is<br>
known in prior art.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a reliable concept for analyzing an<br>
information signal.<br>
This object is achieved by a device for analyzing an information signal and, a method for<br>
analyzing an information signal as described hereinafter.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a reliable content identification is<br>
achieved by not only considering individual recognition results by themselves, but over a<br>
certain period of time. For example, there is considerable information usable for<br>
recognition in the sequence of individual recognition results for a sequence of<br>
fingerprints. According to the invention, a formation of at least two different hypotheses<br>
is performed based on a sequence of fingerprints representing a sequence of blocks of<br>
an information signal, wherein a first hypothesis is an assumption for the association of<br>
the sequence of blocks with a first information entity, and wherein the second<br>
hypothesis is an assumption for the association of the sequence of blocks with the<br>
second information entity. The at least two hypotheses are now examined and subjected<br>
to an evaluation so that a statement on the information signal is made based on an<br>
examination result. The statement could, for example, consist in determining that the<br>
sequence of blocks represents an information entity having a hypothesis that is most<br>
likely. The statement could alternatively or additionally be that an information<br>
unit	<br><br>
ends with the fingerprint that contributes to the most<br>
likely hypothesis as temporally last fingerprint of the<br>
sequence of fingerprints.<br>
Preferably, the hypotheses are examined so that there are<br>
at least two different identification results for<br>
fingerprints, and that there is a reliability measure for<br>
each of the two different identification results, wherein<br>
this reliability measure may consist in a concrete number.<br>
This reliability measure, however, may also be given<br>
implicitly so that only by the fact that, for example, two<br>
identification results are provided, a reliability of, for<br>
example, 1/2 is signaled, and that this number is not given<br>
explicitly.<br>
For the assessment whether a hypothesis is more likely than<br>
the other hypothesis, reliability measures of the<br>
individual recognitions for the respective number of blocks<br>
consecutive in time are advantageously combined, wherein<br>
this combination preferably consists in an addition. Then<br>
the hypothesis providing the highest combined reliability<br>
measure is evaluated to be the most likely hypothesis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
fingerprint database in which a number of reference<br>
fingerprints is respectively filed in association with an<br>
identification result is used as means for providing<br>
consecutive identification results. Then a database search<br>
is made with the fingerprint generated from a block of the<br>
information signal to be analyzed to look for a reference<br>
fingerprint providing a match with the test fingerprint<br>
within the database. Depending on the design of the<br>
database, only the best hit, i.e. the hit with a minimum<br>
distance measure, is output as search result by the<br>
database as identification result. Also, databases are<br>
preferred that provide a hit result not only qualitatively,<br>
but also provide a quantitative hit result, so that a<br>
number of possible hits with an associated reliability<br><br>
measure is output, so that, for example, all hits with a<br>
reliability measure larger than or equal to a certain<br>
threshold, such as 20%, are output by the database.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a new<br>
hypothesis is started when a new identification result<br>
appears for which there is no hypothesis yet. This<br>
procedure is performed for a certain number of blocks to<br>
then examine directed into the past whether a certain<br>
hypothesis that has been found reliable has already ended,<br>
to then identify this hypothesis as the most likely<br>
hypothesis.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the concept<br>
works reliably and is nevertheless error-tolerant<br>
particularly regarding transmission errors. For example, no<br>
attempt is made to make a decision based on a single block,<br>
but a sequence of consecutive blocks is, as it were,<br>
considered and evaluated together by hypothesis formation,<br>
so that short-term transmission disturbances and/or<br>
generally occurring noise do not make the whole recognition<br>
process useless.<br>
In addition, the inventive concept automatically provides<br>
recording of the transmission quality from the beginning to<br>
the end, for example of a commercial. Even if a hypothesis<br>
has been identified as the most likely hypothesis, i.e. if<br>
a certain commercial is determined to have been there,<br>
quality variations within the commercial are still<br>
traceable based on the reliability measures. Furthermore,<br>
in that way particularly the complete time continuity of a<br>
commercial as an example of an information entity is<br>
traceable and recordable, particularly with respect to the<br>
aspect that they did not continuously repeat a part of the<br>
commercial, but that the whole commercial was transmitted<br>
from the beginning of the commercial to the end of the<br>
commercial in a continuous way.<br><br>
The present invention is further advantageous in that, by<br>
hypothesis formation, the end of an information entity and<br>
the beginning of an information entity are automatically<br>
detected. This is due to the fact that an association with<br>
an information entity will generally be unambiguous. This<br>
means that it is not possible to replay several information<br>
entities together over a certain point in time, but that,<br>
at least for the excessive number of program contents, only<br>
one information entity is contained in the information<br>
signal at one point in time. The hypothesis examination and<br>
the evaluation of the hypotheses based on the hypothesis<br>
examination automatically provides a point in time at which<br>
a previous information entity ends and at which a new<br>
information entity starts. This is due to the block<br>
association maintained in the hypotheses. Thus a sequence<br>
of fingerprints still corresponds to a sequence of blocks<br>
and, in turn, a sequence of identification results<br>
corresponds to a sequence of fingerprints, so that a<br>
hypothesis is unambiguously associated with the original<br>
information signal with respect to time.<br>
The inventive concept is further advantageous in that there<br>
are no "draw" situations between two hypotheses, even if<br>
information entities partially have identical audio<br>
material, such as short versions or long versions of one<br>
and the same song.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
explained in detail below with respect to the accompanying<br>

embodiment of the present invention;<br>

illustrated in Figs. 4a-4c;<br>
Fig. 8 is a schematic representation of an<br>
information signal with information units,<br>

entities with a plurality of blocks;<br>
Fig. 9 is a known scenario for building up a<br>
fingerprint database; and<br>
Fig. 10 is a known scenario for audio identifying by<br>
means of a fingerprint database loaded<br>
according to Fig. 9.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block circuit diagram of a device for<br>
analyzing an information signal according to a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. An exemplary<br>
information signal is indicated at 800 in Fig. 8. The<br>
information signal 500 consists of a sequence 802 of blocks<br>
of information units consecutive in time, wherein the<br>
individual information units 804 may be, for example, audio<br>
samples, videc pixels or video transform coefficients, etc.<br><br>
A plurality of blocks of the sequence 802 together always<br>
form an information entity 806. In the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 8, the first six blocks form the first information<br>
entity, and the blocks 7, 8, 9, 10 form the second<br>
information entity. Starting from the blocks 11 to n, a<br>
third information entity is, for example, illustrated in<br>
Fig. 8. An information entity could, for example, be a<br>
piece of music, a spoken passage, a video image or, for<br>
example, also part of a video image. An information entity<br>
could, however, also be a text or, for example, a page of a<br>
text, if the information signal also includes text data.<br>
The device shown in Fig. 1 is designed to operate using a<br>
sequence of fingerprints FA1, FA2, FA3, ..., FAi, which are<br>
generated from the sequence of blocks 802 or which are<br>
fetched, for example, from a memory, if the fingerprints<br>
have already been generated prior to the analysis or are<br>
perhaps even supplied with the information signal,<br>
depending on the implementation. It is to be noted that<br>
there may also be used block overlapping techniques for the<br>
block formation, as they are known, for example, from audio<br>
coding.<br>
In any case, the device for analyzing the information<br>
signal operates using a sequence of fingerprints for the<br>
sequence of blocks, so that the sequence of blocks 802 is<br>
represented by the sequence of fingerprints FA1, FA2, FA3,<br>
FA4, ..., FAi. The sequence of fingerprints is fed into a<br>
fingerprint input in means 12 for providing identification<br>
results for consecutive fingerprints. The means 12 for<br>
providing consecutive identification results is operative<br>
to provide consecutive identification results for the<br>
consecutive fingerprints, wherein an identification result<br>
represents an association of a block of information units<br>
with a predetermined information entity. Assuming, for<br>
example, that a song has a time length corresponding to<br>
about six blocks, the six blocks provide different<br>
fingerprints, but in the means 12 for providing all these<br><br>
six blocks are signaled to be part of the predetermined<br>
information entity, i.e. the mentioned song.<br>
Depending on the implementation, the means 12 for providing<br>
will provide one or more identification results for a<br>
fingerprint. The one or more identification results are<br>
supplied to means 14 for forming at least two hypotheses<br>
from the identification results for the consecutive<br>
fingerprints. Specifically, a first hypothesis represents<br>
an assumption for the association of the sequence of blocks<br>
with a first information entity, and the second hypothesis<br>
is an assumption for the association of the sequence of<br>
blocks with the second information entity. The various<br>
hypotheses H1, H2, ... are supplied to means 16 for examining<br>
the hypotheses, wherein the means 16 is designed to operate<br>
according to an adjustable examination algorithm to finally<br>
provide an examination result at an examination result<br>
output 18.<br>
This examination result on line 18 is then provided to<br>
means 20 for making a statement on the information signal.<br>
The means 20 for making a statement on the information<br>
signal is designed to output information on the information<br>
signal based on the examination result, and may have<br>
various settings.<br>
All settings have in common that the statement on the<br>
information signal is made on the basis of the examination<br>
result 18. Examples of various statements on the<br>
information signal consist in determining that the sequence<br>
of blocks represents an information entity having a<br>
hypothesis that is most likely. Alternative statements are<br>
that an information entity ends with the fingerprint that<br>
contributes to the most likely hypothesis as the timewise<br>
last fingerprint. An alternative statement that may be made<br>
by the means 20 consists in determining that an information<br>
entity per se is present in the information signal or not.<br><br>
The inventive post-processing particularly provided by the<br>
means 14, 16 and 20, i.e. forming at least two hypotheses,<br>
examining the hypotheses and making a statement on the<br>
basis of an examination result, thus not only allows the<br>
identification of a piece in an information signal that is<br>
unknown, i.e. to be analyzed, but - apart from the<br>
identification of a piece itself - also allows the<br>
detection of the end of a first piece, i.e. a first<br>
information entity, and the detection of the beginning of a<br>
second information entity following the first information<br>
entity.<br>
Regarding commercial monitoring, the inventive post-<br>
processing concept, however, also provides the possibility<br>
to detect whether a certain piece was present in the<br>
information signal or not. The fingerprints acquired from<br>
the information signal would here only be compared to one<br>
set of fingerprints, namely the set of fingerprints<br>
representing the predetermined information entity, i.e. a<br>
certain commercial. This statement is thus not primarily to<br>
be considered in the context of identifying an information<br>
entity or detecting the end of an information entity and<br>
the beginning of a following information entity, but<br>
consists in detecting whether a certain information entity<br>
is present in an unknown information signal to be analyzed<br>
or not.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a special preferred implementation of the<br>
means 12 for providing identification results for<br>
consecutive fingerprints. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
means 12 includes a database including various reference<br>
fingerprints FArj, which are all stored in association with<br>
an identification result, i.e. IDk, as shown in Fig. 2. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, the fingerprints FAi are<br>
processed one after the other, i.e. sequentially in time.<br>
Thus a fingerprint FAi is stored into the database via an<br>
input line 24. In the database, the stored fingerprint FAi<br>
is then compared to ail reference fingerprints FArj . In the<br><br>
preferred embodiment, the database is not a qualitative<br>
database that determines that an input fingerprint matches<br>
a stored reference fingerprint or not, but the database is<br>
a quantitative database that can provide a distance measure<br>
and/or a reliability measure for the output results. In the<br>
preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the database 22 would<br>
thus provide, for example, the result illustrated in a<br>
result table 28 at its output 26. Thus the database would,<br>
for example, say that the fingerprint FAi indicates an<br>
identification result IDx, i.e. a piece of music, for<br>
example x, with a reliability ZV1 of 60%. At the same time,<br>
however, the database will also say that the fingerprint<br>
FAi indicates a piece with the identification result IDy<br>
with a reliability of 50%. Finally, the database could also<br>
output that the fingerprint FAi indicates yet another piece<br>
with the identification IDz with a reliability measure ZV3<br>
of, for example, 40%.<br>
Depending on the implementation, the whole result table 28<br>
may be supplied to the means 14 for forming at least two<br>
hypotheses of Fig. 1. Alternatively, however, the database<br>
22 itself could already make a decision and always provide<br>
only the most likely value, i.e. in the present case the<br>
result IDx, to the means 14 for forming at least two<br>
hypotheses. In this case, the reliability measure ZV1 would<br>
not necessarily also have to be provided to the means 14<br>
for forming at least two hypotheses. Instead, the further<br>
communication of the reliability measures ZVi could be<br>
omitted. Alternatively, however, the means 12 for providing<br>
the identification results, which at the same time also<br>
provides the reliability measures, could also be designed<br>
to provide the reliability measures ZVi in corresponding<br>
order in association with the blocks not to the means 14<br>
for forming at least two hypotheses, but to the means 16<br>
for examining the hypotheses, because this means 16 only<br>
needs the reliability measures to find, for example, the<br>
most likely hypothesis.<br><br>
It can be seen from the database 22 in Fig. 2 that an<br>
identification result, such as ID1, may have several<br>
associated fingerprints FAr11, FAr12, FAr13, which<br>
indicates that the piece being identified by ID1 has<br>
several blocks. Depending on the implementation, however,<br>
there may also be stored a single long fingerprint for the<br>
piece with the identification ID1, which is, however,<br>
composed of the individual fingerprints FArll, FArl2,<br>
FArl3, ... The database would then correlate the supplied<br>
fingerprint FAi, which depends on the block length and is<br>
typically much shorter than the long fingerprint, with the<br>
long fingerprint in each row of the database to determine<br>
whether or not a portion of the long stored reference<br>
fingerprint matches the reference fingerprint FAi supplied<br>
on line 24. Here, the reliability measure would result<br>
automatically, so to speak, i.e. simply by a quantitative<br>
evaluation of the correlation result.<br>
Furthermore, reference is already made to the last two<br>
rows, based on Fig. 2, which are designated by the<br>
identification results ID108 and ID109. ID108 designates a<br>
long version of a piece of music, as will be explained with<br>
respect to Fig. 4a, while ID109 identifies a short version<br>
of the same piece of music, as shown in Fig. 4b.<br>
As already discussed, the database 22, i.e. this<br>
implementation of the means 12 for providing identification<br>
results for consecutive fingerprints, may be designed such<br>
that it always supplies only the most likely identification<br>
result. Alternatively, however, the database 22 could also<br>
be defined to always supply, for example, only the<br>
identification results whose probability is higher than a<br>
minimum threshold, such as a threshold of 5%. This would<br>
have the result that the number of rows of the table varies<br>
from fingerprint to fingerprint. Again alternatively, the<br>
database 22 could, however, also be implemented to supply,<br>
for each input fingerprint FAi, a certain number of most<br>
likely candidates, such as the "top ten.", i.e. the ten most<br><br>
likely candidates, to the means 14 for forming at least two<br>
hypotheses.<br>
Subsequently, an implementation of the database 22 will be<br>
illustrated based on Fig. 3, in which the database always<br>
supplies the three most likely identification results<br>
together with the associated reliability values to the<br>
means 14 for forming hypotheses, i.e. it includes, so to<br>
speak, a "top three" implementation. Fig. 3 shows that, for<br>
fingerprint FA1, identification results ID1, ID2, ID3 are<br>
provided, actually with the respective reliability measures<br>
40%, 60% or 30%. For the time interval At2, i.e. for the<br>
fingerprint FA2, there will again be a delivery of the<br>
identification results ID1, ID2, ID3, but now with a<br>
different respective probability, i.e. with a different<br>
respective reliability measure, which is illustrated in<br>
percent only as an example in Fig. 3. This procedure is<br>
performed for all input fingerprints FA1 to FA8. The means<br>
14 for forming at least two hypotheses, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 1, is provided with these identification results. The<br>
means 14 for forming at least two hypotheses is designed to<br>
start a new hypothesis whenever a new identification result<br>
is supplied from the means 12 for providing the<br>
identification results. This can be seen from Fig. 3, where<br>
the hypotheses H1, H2, H3 are started with ID1, ID2 and<br>
ID3, respectively, at time Δt1, and new hypotheses are<br>
again started with ID108, ID109, ID4 in the time interval<br>
At7, and a further hypothesis H4 is started for ID8 in time<br>
interval Δt8 due to the fact that IDS appears there for the<br>
first time in the shown example.<br>
The means 14 for forming at least two hypotheses is thus<br>
operative to see for each new fingerprint whether there<br>
will be a new identification result, to start a new<br>
hypothesis, and to continue a hypothesis already started<br>
earlier when, for a time period Ati, an element is included<br>
in the "top three" or "top x" for the hypothesis already<br>
started earlier that, although with less probability,<br><br>
provides an identification result for a hypothesis just<br>
started. This procedure is continued for a certain time.<br>
Then, for example at predetermined times or triggered by a<br>
user, etc., the means 16 for examining the hypotheses will<br>
examine the hypotheses formed for the past and, for the<br>
case shown in Fig. 3, add, for example, the reliability<br>
measures of the hypotheses H1, H2, H3 for the time periods<br>
Δt1 to At6. The means 16 for examining at least two<br>
hypotheses would then determine that the piece is most<br>
likely ID1, i.e. that the hypothesis H1 is the most likely<br>
hypothesis for the time period Δtl to Δt6, because the<br>
reliability measure reaches a value of 420, while the<br>
second hypothesis only reaches a reliability measure of<br>
230, and while the third hypothesis only reaches a<br>
reliability measure of 135.<br>
In the case shown in Fig. 3, all three hypotheses start at<br>
the same time and all three hypotheses end at the same<br>
time. However, this does not necessarily have to be the<br>
case. For example, the hypothesis HI could end earlier,<br>
i.e. for example at time At5. In this case, the reliability<br>
measure of ID1 would have to be reduced by 90, thus<br>
arriving at a value of 330. In this case, the result would<br>
be that the hypothesis HI is nevertheless the most likely<br>
hypothesis, although hypothesis H2 is present over a longer<br>
time period, but all in all with less probability. The<br>
example shown in Fig. 3 further shows that the hypothesis<br>
HI "wins" in the end in spite of the fact that it was less<br>
likely for Atl than the hypothesis H2.<br>
Fig. 3 further shows that a hypothesis may also have<br>
"holes" such that, for example, for some reason, for<br>
example due to the disturbance of a transmission channel,<br>
etc., only ID2 and ID3, but not ID1, are supplied with<br>
reasonable probability in the time interval At4. In that<br>
case, the reliability value for ID1 would have to be<br>
reduced by 60, which would, in turn, have the result that<br>
the total reliability would be 360 instead of 420, sc z'r.az<br><br>
the hypothesis H1 is the most likely hypothesis in this<br>
case as well.<br>
The above scenarios thus show that the inventive concept,<br>
which works with hypotheses on the basis of post-processing<br>
and, on the one hand, considers the sequence and, on the<br>
other hand, the reliability measures of the individual<br>
fingerprint identification processes, is extraordinarily<br>
robust with respect to transmission errors and also with<br>
respect to problematic functionalities in the database or<br>
also with respect to fingerprints that may not differ as<br>
much as would be desirable for some information entities,<br>
such as pieces of music, video images, texts, etc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a hypothesis is a stored<br>
protocol (Fig. 3: H1, H2, H3, ...) , preferably in the form of<br>
a stored list, which on the one hand comprises an<br>
indication of the information entity for which the<br>
hypothesis is made and on the other hand an indication of<br>
fingerprints and/or blocks of information units for which<br>
the hypothesis is done. Preferably, the protocol also<br>
contains a reliability measure for a block and/or<br>
fingerprint.<br>
Fig. 3 further shows that the first information entity only<br>
extends over the time period Δtl to Δt6, and a new entity<br>
starts from Δt7. This may particularly also be seen from<br>
the fact that all three hypotheses end at the same time<br>
and/or that, even if the hypothesis H3 had, for example,<br>
included Δt7, now completely different identification<br>
values with a very high probability, namely ID108 and ID109<br>
with probabilities of 90 and 85, appear and thus "replace"<br>
the "clear winners" from the previous time period.<br>
At the end of Fig. 3, the various statements that may be<br>
made by way of example are represented, i.e. that the<br>
information entity in the time period Δtl to Δt6 is the<br>
piece of music identified by ID1. Alternatively, the<br><br>
statement could also be that an information entity change<br>
occurs between Δt6 and Δt7. Alternatively, however, a<br>
statement could also be that the piece of music identified<br>
by ID1 is contained in the information signal.<br>
Next, there is first a more general discussion of database<br>
systems based on Figs. 9 and 10, how they may be used<br>
advantageously in connection with the present invention.<br>
The present invention is thus based on a system for the<br>
identification of audio material, such as music. The system<br>
knows two operation phases. In the training phase,<br>
illustrated based on Fig. 9, the recognition system learns<br>
the pieces to be identified later on. In the identification<br>
phase, illustrated in Fig. 10, the previously trained audio<br>
pieces may be recognized.<br>
In order to identify a piece of music - or also any other<br>
audio signal -, a compact and unique data set is extracted<br>
therefrom, also referred to as fingerprint or signature.<br>
This extraction is done in a block feature extraction 900.<br>
In the training or learning phase, such fingerprints are<br>
generated from a set of known audio objects and stored in a<br>
fingerprint database 902. Preferably, the feature<br>
extraction means 900 is designed to use the SFM feature as<br>
feature, wherein SFM means "spectral flatness measure". Of<br>
course, other fingerprint generation systems and/or feature<br>
extraction results may also be used. However, it has been<br>
found that tonality-related features and particularly the<br>
SFM feature have a particularly good distinctiveness on the<br>
one hand and a particularly good compactness on the other<br>
hand. For this purpose, each block is first subjected to a<br>
time/frequency conversion, to then calculate an SFM for a<br>
block with the values generated from the time/frequency<br>
conversion according to the following equation.<br><br><br>
In this equation, X(n) represents the square of an absolute<br>
value of a spectral component with the index n, wherein N<br>
is the total number of spectral coefficients of a spectrum.<br>
It may be seen from the equation that the SFM measure is<br>
equal to the quotient of the geometric mean of the spectral<br>
components and the arithmetic mean of the spectral<br>
components. It is known that the geometric mean is always<br>
less than or maximally equal to the arithmetic mean, so<br>
that the SFM has a value range between 0 and 1. In this<br>
context, a value close to 0 indicates a tonal signal, and a<br>
value close to 1 indicates a rather noise-like signal with<br>
a flat spectral curve. It is to be noted that the<br>
arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are only equal if<br>
all X(n) are identical, which corresponds to a completely<br>
atonal, i.e. noise-like or pulse-like signal. However, if<br>
in an extreme case only one spectral component has a very<br>
high value, while other spectral components X(n) have very<br>
small values, the SFM measure will have a value close to 0,<br>
indicating a very tonal signal.<br>
The SFM concept as well as other feature extraction<br>
concepts to generate fingerprints are, for example,<br>
discussed in WO 03/007185.<br>
In the identification phase, illustrated in Fig. 10, there<br>
is typically also the same feature extraction 900 as in the<br>
training phase. Specifically, the fingerprint extracted<br>
from the audio object at the audio input for a time period<br>
At is compared to the reference fingerprints of the<br>
fingerprint database 902 by means of a comparator 904,<br>
wherein the comparator is typically included in the means<br>
12 for providing identification results, as illustrated<br><br>
with respect to Fig. 1. Subsequently, a recognition result<br>
is obtained for the time period At in the case of the<br>
detection of a match based on a certain criterion. If thus<br>
a match is detected based on a certain criterion, the<br>
unknown fingerprint and thus the portion from the unknown<br>
audio object may be associated with reference material in<br>
the database, i.e. a list of identification results IDi,<br>
IDi+1, ..., with various reliability values.<br>
According to the invention, now an unknown audio object at<br>
the input is not only associated with exactly one reference<br>
audio object in the reference database, namely only for a<br>
time At, but there is a continuous operation without<br>
interruption of the data stream at the input. According to<br>
the invention, an association of various portions from<br>
audio objects with the correct audio objects from the<br>
reference database is performed. Thus an unbroken sequence,<br>
i.e. a protocol, of the identified audio objects at the<br>
input is obtained.<br>
Next, a particular difficulty of the continuous analysis of<br>
a continuous audio data stream is represented based on<br>
Figs. 4a to 5d. The audio object has to be divided into<br>
portions of length Atx, i.e. into individual blocks, to be<br>
able to make an association with a reference element in the<br>
database for the portion of the audio data stream. It is<br>
possible that this association of an individual portion of<br>
the audio data stream is not always unambiguous and only<br>
becomes unambiguous in connection with preceding and<br>
following associations. If individual associations are made<br>
and they are only combined in a further step, the result<br>
are faulty recognition protocols, as shown below.<br>
Fig. 4a represents a long version of a piece of music XY,<br>
which is also represented by a long fingerprint illustrated<br>
in Fig. 4a, wherein the identification result ID108 is<br>
associated with this fingerprint. Fig. 4b shows the same<br>
for a short version of the same piece of music XY. ID109<br><br>
thus indicates a short version of the piece of music XY,<br>
while ID108 indicates a long version of this piece of<br>
music. Since the short version is shorter than the long<br>
version, the fingerprint in Fig. 4b is also shorter than<br>
the fingerprint in Fig. 4a. As the two blocks are<br>
illustrated one below the other, the pieces of music and<br>
thus also the fingerprints ID108 and ID109 contain<br>
identical audio material and/or identical fingerprint data.<br>
ID109 is thus a subset of ID108. Fig. 4c thus shows that<br>
the long version has a starting portion in the time period<br>
AtO, which is not present in the short version. In the<br>
middle portion between t1 to t5, the long version and the<br>
short version are identical, while the long version again<br>
has a music portion not present in the short version<br>
identified by ID109 between the times t5 and t7.<br>
Subsequently, there will be an illustration based on Figs.<br>
5a to 5d how faulty recognition protocols may be generated<br>
with the individual identifications in the case of simple<br>
combination, i.e. without hypothesis formation. It is<br>
assumed that the piece of music ID108 is received at the<br>
input of the system at time tO. Furthermore, let the<br>
database be operative to identify the elements shown in<br>
Fig. 5a for the time periods Atx. It is to be noted that<br>
the identification in Fig. 5a is basically correct,<br>
although both ID108 and ID109 could be output in the time<br>
periods Δt1 to Δt4. Ultimately, the determination of the<br>
identification results in these areas is ambiguous, because<br>
the database will output both ID109 and ID108 in absence of<br>
a disturbance, and, due to computational differences, will,<br>
for example, always choose the most likely value, so that,<br>
due to some noise, one of the two identification results<br>
ID108 or ID109 will always have a slightly higher<br>
reliability measure. In the recognition protocol<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5b, a wrong identification is thus made<br>
in that the piece identified by ID109 has not been played<br>
at any time, but only the piece identified by ID108 has<br>
been played.<br><br>
Subsequently, Figs. 5c and 5d show a further alternative.<br>
It is assumed that the database outputs the situation shown<br>
in Fig. 5c. In the recognition protocol, there is again<br>
given a wrong combination, i.e. that ID109 was present<br>
between T1 and T5, while this, of course, is not the case.<br>
Instead, the long version of the piece of music, i.e.<br>
ID108, was played from t0 to t7.<br>
In addition, further wrong recognition protocols are<br>
conceivable, which are generated by the ambiguity of the<br>
individual recognitions for a portion of the audio data<br>
stream in the time period Δtx.<br>
According to the invention, the general concept illustrated<br>
in Fig. 6 is now accessed, wherein the recognition results<br>
obtained for a time period Atx, i.e. the output signals of<br>
the means 12 of Fig. 1, which may combine the means 900,<br>
904, 902 depending on the implementation, are subjected to<br>
post-processing substantially corresponding to the means<br>
for forming at least two hypotheses and the means for<br>
examining the hypotheses of Fig. 1. Then a statement on the<br>
information signal is made in the form of a recognition<br>
sequence and/or a recognition protocol using the post-<br>
processing, i.e. using the examination results obtained in<br>
the post-processing.<br>
In the post-processing stage, the probability for the<br>
transition from an identified reference audio object for<br>
the time period Δtx to any other reference audio objects<br>
for the time period Δtx+1 is assumed to be equal. From this<br>
assumption, various hypotheses, which are first considered<br>
in parallel, are formed for contiguous audio portions from<br>
the individual recognitions. It is to be noted that<br>
individual recognitions are combined to form a hypothesis<br>
when they are related to one and the same reference audio<br>
signal and are time-continuously connected. The recognition<br>
protocol results from a combination of the respective most<br><br>
likely hypotheses considering the progress in time.<br>
Subsequently, a preferred algorithm is illustrated in<br>
detail.<br>
At first, various hypotheses for contiguous audio portions<br>
are formed from the individual recognitions for the time<br>
periods Δtx (wherein x = N, N+1, N+2, ...; wherein tN is the<br>
starting time for the respective hypothesis) for each<br>
recognized reference audio object.<br>
Individual recognitions are combined to form a hypothesis,<br>
if the individual recognitions are consecutive in time in a<br>
continuous way.<br>
The time continuity is a further element that serves to<br>
determine whether an already existing hypothesis is<br>
continued or whether a new hypothesis is started. Consider,<br>
for example, the scenario in which a certain guitar solo,<br>
for example, in a piece is situated rather at the beginning<br>
of the piece in the short version of the piece and is<br>
situated rather in the middle of the piece in a long<br>
version of the piece.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the database, i.e. the means for<br>
providing identification results, not only outputs a<br>
fingerprint identification, but also a time value which<br>
results from the identification fingerprint in the database<br>
having a length and the input (short) fingerprint only<br>
matching part of the (long) fingerprint in the database.<br>
In the scenario described above, the database would perhaps<br>
provide two ID results for the guitar solo (short version<br>
and long version), but with two different time indices. The<br>
time index for the ID result for the short version is<br>
smaller than the rime index for the long version. On the<br>
basis of the time index, the means for forming the<br>
hypotheses is now capaole of continuing hypotheses (if<br>
there is time continuty between the time index and the<br><br>
last time index in the hypothesis) or starting new<br>
hypotheses, if there is no continuity in the currently<br>
obtained time index and a last time index of a hypothesis.<br>
Each time discontinuity with respect to a reference audio<br>
object generates a new hypothesis, if the following element<br>
has a larger distance in time than a time distance Ta to be<br>
set, or if the following element is temporally before the<br>
previous one.<br>
For the hypothesis examination, an addition of the<br>
confidence measures, i.e. the reliability values and/or the<br>
measures for the plausibility, of the individual<br>
recognitions is made for each hypothesis.<br>
Starting with the time period Δt0, the hypothesis with the<br>
highest confidence measure is then evaluated to be true and<br>
adopted into the recognition protocol. For the next time<br>
period following the first hypothesis, the hypothesis with<br>
the highest confidence measure is again evaluated to be<br>
true and adopted into the recognition protocol, etc.<br>
For the above example, the result is thus a process<br>
illustrated based on Figs. 7a to 7c. For the time period<br>
Δt0, the database, as illustrated, for example, in Fig. 2,<br>
provides only one identification result, i.e. ID108, that<br>
has a probability and/or a reliability measure above a<br>
threshold. In the time interval Δt1, i.e. for the block of<br>
information units extending over the time interval Δt1, the<br>
database provides two results having a reliability measure<br>
that is above a threshold. The two results are also<br>
obtained for the blocks between the times t2 to t5. For the<br>
time period t5 to t7, the database then again provides only<br>
a single identification result whose reliability measure is<br>
above a threshold.<br>
The means 14 (Fig. 1) for forming at least two hypotheses<br>
is designed to start a first hypothesis at the time t0<br><br>
based on the identification result ID108, and to start a<br>
new hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis H2, at the time t1<br>
based on the new identification result ID109.<br>
Some time after time t7, the hypothesis situation shown in<br>
Fig. 7a with the hypotheses H1 and H2 is then considered to<br>
then calculate the functions for the confidence measures of<br>
the individual recognitions, i.e. xH1 and xH2, for each<br>
hypothesis based on the examination of the hypotheses,<br>
which may be done as illustrated in Fig. 7b.<br>
Assuming that, between t1 and t5, the identification results<br>
ID108 and ID109 occur with the same probability, only the<br>
first hypothesis H1 will win in the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 7a, because although the hypothesis was just as likely<br>
as the hypothesis H2 between t1 and t5, the hypothesis H1<br>
applies in the time period Δt0 and in the time period Δt5<br>
and in the time period Δt6, i.e. it contributes a<br>
reliability measure for an individual recognition that is<br>
not given for the hypothesis H2. For the recognition<br>
protocol, this means the correct case shown in Fig. 7c,<br>
i.e. that the piece designated ID108 was played from time<br>
tO to time t7.<br>
Starting at to, the hypothesis H1 is thus chosen, because<br>
until t7 there is no hypothesis with a higher confidence<br>
measure. The hypothesis H2 is discarded, wherein, in<br>
principle, all hypotheses can be discarded that exist in<br>
parallel to another hypothesis that has been chosen as the<br>
most likely one.<br>
According to the invention, there is thus recorded exactly<br>
the sequence, in this example an element, namely ID108,<br>
that was really played at the audio input.<br>
It is to be noted that there are various possibilities for<br>
the determination of the end of a hypothesis. For example -<br>
independent of the hypothesis situation - an information<br><br>
entity end may be determined, for example, from the audio<br>
signal itself, for example if there is a pause with a<br>
certain minimum length. Since, however, this criterion does<br>
not work if there is fading between two information<br>
entities or if two pieces follow each other so quickly that<br>
no noticeable pause can be found, it is preferred to<br>
determine an information entity end based on the hypotheses<br>
considered in the past. This may be done, for example, such<br>
that a hypothesis is considered to have ended when, for<br>
example, two or more blocks that have no longer any<br>
identification result with a reliability value above a<br>
certain minimum threshold are provided to the means 14 for<br>
forming hypotheses. Alternatively, for example for the case<br>
shown in Fig. 3, there may simply be started to add the<br>
values of the hypotheses for a predetermined number of<br>
blocks at some time directed into the past in order to see<br>
which hypothesis had the highest value for certain blocks<br>
at the end, i.e. after a certain number of, for example, 20<br>
blocks, and has thus survived and "outdone" the other<br>
hypotheses. In the example shown in Fig. 3, this would mean<br>
that the hypotheses that the information entity is ID1 or<br>
ID2 or ID3 would also be continued for the time periods Δt7<br>
and Δt8, wherein, however, this would not change anything<br>
in the recognition of ID1, because new hypotheses, i.e. the<br>
hypothesis for ID108, ID109, ID4 and ID8, are started only<br>
substantially later, i.e. for blocks from Δt7 and Δt8 or<br>
above, and thus achieve such high combined reliability<br>
values only much later or not at all.<br>
The above discussion shows that the end of a hypothesis<br>
does not necessarily have to be determined actively, but<br>
that this end may automatically result from the analysis of<br>
the past, i.e. the started hypotheses. Preferably, a new<br>
hypothesis is started whenever a new identification result<br>
with a reliability measure above a significance threshold<br>
appears, wherein then the past is examined at some time to<br>
see which hypothesis survives for a certain time period,<br>
wherein it is not necessary to explicitly determine an end<br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>

comprising:<br>
means (12) for providing identification results (IDi) for consecutive<br>
fingerprints, wherein an identification result represents an association of a<br>
block of information units with a predetermined information entity, and<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE : "A DEVICE AND METHOD FOR ANALYZING AN AUDIO<br>
INFORMATION SIGNAL FOR IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL CONTENTS<br>
HAVING A SEQUENCE"<br>
For analyzing an information signal having a sequence of blocks of information<br>
units, wherein a plurality of consecutive blocks of the sequence of blocks<br>
represents an information entity, using a sequence of fingerprints for the<br>
sequence of blocks, identification results are provided (12) for consecutive<br>
fingerprints, wherein an identification result represents an association of a block<br>
of information units with a predetermined information entity. Then at least two<br>
hypotheses are formed (14) from the identification results for the consecutive<br>
fingerprints, wherein a first hypothesis is an assumption for the association of<br>
the sequence of blocks with a first information entity, and wherein the second<br>
hypothesis is an assumption for the association of the sequence of blocks with<br>
the second information entity. Then various hypotheses are examined (16) to<br>
obtain an examination result on the basis of which there is then made (20) a<br>
statement on the information signal. This achieves a meaningful and reliable<br>
time-continuous analysis of an information signal.</td>
