				<td>MELAMINE POLYOLS AND COATINGS THEREOF     <br>
The present invention relates to novel low viscosity oligomeric polyols and the use<br>
thereof in coating compositions. The novel low viscosity oligomeric polyols are<br>
5     prepared by reacting at least one melamine aldehyde resin and at least one a,ß-<br>
diol, a,?-diol, or mixture thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
10 Many of the high solids automotive coatings presently in use are based upon<br>
polymeric systems comprised of a binder comprising either polyester-based or<br>
polyacrylic-based polyols and crosslinking agents therefor. These coatings are<br>
generally supplied as "one-pack" or "two-pack" systems.<br>
15 In a typical one-pack system, all of the coating ingredients are combined into one<br>
storage-stable mixture. Upon application, the polyol component is crosslinked,<br>
generally with an aminoplast resin (such as a melamine resin) or a blocked<br>
isocyanate, usually under heat cure conditions of 120°C or above. In a typical two-<br>
pack system, the  polyol component is combined with  a crosslinking  agent,<br>
20 generally an isocyanate, shortly before application, with curing being conducted at<br>
ambient and/or elevated temperatures.<br>
Coatings used for painting motor vehicles and repairing the original paint are<br>
desired to have good physical properties such as hardness, mechanical strength,<br>
25 and resistance to water, acids, and solvents. The coatings are also desired to have<br>
good appearance properties, providing smooth films and a high gloss and high<br>
distinctness of image. It is also desirable that such coatings have an excellent car<br>
wash, scratch, and mar resistance.<br>
A large number of cars and transport vehicles are coated with a multilayer topcoat<br>
system wherein an unpigmented clearcoat is applied over a pigmented basecoat.<br>
Both solvent borne and water borne clearcoats and basecoats are in use. So-<br>
called metallic basecoats comprise metallic flakes.<br>
5<br>
For environmental reasons, it is becoming increasingly important to develop<br>
polymeric systems with low solution viscosities, which permit the formulation of<br>
high solids coatings with low application viscosities suitable for spraying. High<br>
solids coatings (generally 50 wt.% or greater solids) significantly decrease the<br>
10 amount of volatile organic compounds (VOC) entering the atmosphere upon<br>
drying/curing of the coating.<br>
One way to achieve a lower solvent content is to use so-called high-solids<br>
compositions. Such compositions comprise a relatively high level of non-volatile<br>
15 materials such as film forming polymer, pigments, and fillers, and a relatively low<br>
level of organic solvent. A problem when formulating high-solids coating<br>
compositions is that such compositions have an unacceptably high viscosity due to<br>
the high molecular weight of the conventional film forming polymer. The high<br>
viscosity gives rise to problems in spray application with poor paint atomization and<br>
20     poor flow-out and, consequently, low gloss levels and poor appearance.<br>
The use of low-molecular weight film forming polymers results in adequate<br>
application viscosities. However, coating composition based on this type of resins<br>
generally use the crosslinker to have acceptable film properties. But scratch and<br>
25 mar resistance may be negatively influenced, especially in 2K coating<br>
compositions.<br>
Polyurethane polyols, such as those described in U.S. patent number 6,753,386,<br>
are presently utilized in coating formulations to improve scratch resistant coatings.<br>
However, these polyurethane polyols may be expensive to produce based on the<br>
high cost of polyisocyanates. Further, although these polyurethane polyols are<br>
effective at low temperatures, it is desirable to have a polyol which has more<br>
reactivity in low bake systems.<br>
5 Melamine formaldehyde resins are utilized as crosslinkers in many coating<br>
applications. However, due to their reactivity, these resins have a predisposition<br>
toward self-condensation making them difficult to utilize. Further, melamine<br>
formaldehyde crosslinkers are generally utilized for high bake systems.<br>
10 In EP-A-0 199 605, pigment pastes, mainly for use in paints and ink, comprising a<br>
pigment dispersing agent and, optionally, an organic solvent are disclosed. The<br>
pigment dispersing agent may be obtained by co-condensing a triazine-type amino<br>
compound, formaldehyde, a diol, and a monohydric alcohol.<br>

structures and the use of modified and unmodified hyperbranched polyurethanes.<br>

polyols for use in coating compositions resulting in dried and cured coatings with<br>

(hereinafter referred to as melamine polyols) comprises the reaction product of:<br>
(a)       at least one melamine aldehyde resin having the formula (I)<br>

(b)       at least one a,ß-diol, a,?-diol, or mixture thereof, and, optionally,<br>
(c)       a compound (c) containing a single functional group capable of reacting with<br>
the melamine aldehyde resin and, optionally, other functional groups,<br>
wherein the diol (b) and the resin (a) are reacted in such relative amounts that the<br>
ratio of the number of hydroxyl groups from diol (b) to the total number of R1 to R6<br>
groups from resin (a) is in the range of 1.25 to 2.25.<br>
The resulting melamine polyols have a low polydispersity, e.g. Mw/Mn =3.5, or<br>
=2.5, or =2.<br>
The melamine polyols of the present invention are produced by reacting<br>
(a)       at least one melamine aldehyde resin having the formula (I) above,<br>
(b)       at least one a,ß-diol, a,?-diol, or mixture thereof, and, optionally,<br>
(c)      a compound (c) containing a single functional group capable of reacting with<br>

in the presence of an acid catalyst.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a method (A) of preparing melamine<br>
polyols comprising reacting at a temperature between about 50°C to 130°C<br>
(a)       at least one melamine aldehyde resin having the formula (I) above,<br>
(b)       at least one a,ß-diol, a,?-diol, or mixture thereof, and, optionally,<br>
(c)       a compound (c) containing a single functional group capable of reacting with<br>
the melamine aldehyde resin and, optionally, other functional groups,<br>
in the presence of an acid catalyst, wherein the diol (b) and the resin (a) are<br>
reacted in such relative amounts that the ratio of the number of hydroxyl groups<br>
from diol (b) to the total number of R1 to R6 groups from resin (a) is in the range of<br>
1.25 to 2.25.<br>
The present invention also relates to another method (B) of preparing melamine<br>

been found that the above melamine aldehyde resins react with the above diols<br>
predominantly single ended, despite the many potential side reactions, including<br>
the self-condensation of the melamine resins.<br>
Further, it was also unexpectedly found that coating compositions prepared from<br>
the above diols and the melamine aldehyde resins in situ result in significant<br>
shrinkage in the coating, indicating that the present melamine polyols cannot be<br>
made in situ in the same ratios.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Melamine polyols<br>
The novel melamine polyols of the present invention are of great utility for coating<br>
compositions and comprises the reaction product of:<br>
(a)      at least one melamine aldehyde resin having the formula (I)<br>
wherein R1 to R6 are each selected from -H, - CH2OH, -CH2OR7, and may<br>
be the same or different, wherein R7 is a C1 to C5 alkyl group,<br>
(b)       at least one a,ß-diol, a,?-diol, or mixture thereof, and, optionally,<br>
(c)       a compound containing a single functional group capable of reacting with<br>
the melamine aldehyde resin and, optionally, other functional groups,<br>
wherein the diol (b) and the resin (a) are reacted in such relative amounts that the<br>
ratio of the number of hydroxyl groups from diol (b) to the total number of R1 to R6<br>
groups from resin (a) is in the range of 1.25 to 2.25.<br>
The melamine aldehyde resins useful for the present reaction have the formula (I):<br>
wherein R1 to R6 are each selected from -H, - CH2OH, -CH2OR7, and may be the<br>
same or different, wherein R7 is a C1 to C5 alkyl group. In one embodiment, R7 is<br>
selected from -CH3 or -C4H9. In another embodiment, R1 to R6 are each -<br>
CH2OCH3.<br>
Melamine aldehyde resins of formula (I) are known in the art and many are<br>
commercially available. Examples of suitable commercially available melamine<br>
aldehyde resins include but are not limited to hexamethoxymethyl (HMMM)-type<br>
melamine resins such as Cymel 303 and Cymel 303LF, available commercially<br>
from Cytec Industries Inc., and Resimene 747 and Resimene CE7103, available<br>
commercially from Surface Specialties.<br>
The melamine aldehyde resin is reacted with an a,ß-diol or a,?-diol, or a mixture<br>
thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the a,ß -diol or a,?-diol has from 2 to 18 carbon atoms. In<br>
another "embodiment it has 2 to 15 carbon atoms. A further embodiment has 2 to<br>
10 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable diols include but are not limited to ethylene<br>
glycol, 1,2 propanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 2-methyl-butane-1,3-diol, cyclopentene-1,3-<br>
diol, 1,2-hexanediol, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol (EHDO), 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-<br>
pentanediol, 1,2-octanediol, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol (BEPD), 2,4,4-<br>
trimethyl-hexane-3,4-diol, 1,2-decanediol, 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-hexane-3,4-diol, and<br>
1,2-octadecanediol.<br>
Optionally, a third compound (c) can be used to prepare the novel melamine<br>
polyols. These compounds contain a single functional group capable of reacting<br>
with the melamine aldehyde resin (d) or these compounds contain a single<br>
functional group capable of reacting with the melamine aldehyde resin and other<br>
functional groups (c2).<br>
Examples of compounds (d) are mono-alcohols. Examples of the other functional<br>
groups from compounds (c2) include carboxyl-functional groups, ethylene oxide<br>
functional groups, ethylenically unsaturated groups, mercapto functional groups,<br>
acetoacetate functional groups, and mixtures thereof. Also, mixtures of compounds<br>
(d) and (c2) can be used.<br>
For example, stable low molecular weight hydrophilic melamine polyols for water<br>
reducible application can be produced by reacting carboxyl- or ethylene oxide<br>
functional compounds with the melamine aldehyde resin and the diol. An example<br>
of such a compound is 2,2-bis(hydroxyl methyl) propionic acid. For UV curing<br>
applications, ethylenically unsaturated compounds such as anhydride functional<br>
compounds, such as maleic anhydride, or hydroxyl functional (meth)acrylate<br>
monomers may be reacted with the melamine aldehyde resin and the diol. A<br>
mercapto functional melamine polyol can be designed by reacting the melamine<br>
aldehdyde resin and the diol with a mercapto functional compound. A coating<br>
composition comprising a mercapto functional melamine polyol may react with<br>
polyisocyanate and epoxy resins at low temperature. For applications requiring<br>
good adhesion and corrosion resistance, such as primers, and even lower<br>
viscosity, acetoacetate monomers can be incorporated into the melamine polyol.<br>
An example of such a compound is methoxy acetate.<br>
In one embodiment, compound (c) is a monoalcohol. Monofunctional alcohols can<br>
be linear or branched, cyclic or acyclic, and the alcohols can be primary, secondary<br>
or tertiary. In one embodiment, aliphatic C1-24 monoalcohols are used; in another<br>
C6-20 monoalcohols are used. Examples include methanol, ethanol, butanol, 2-ethyl<br>
hexanol, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, 4-tert. butyl cyclohexanol,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Compound (c) can be branched monoalcohols, such as<br>
Guerbet alcohols. Guerbet alcohols are branched, primary monofunctional alcohols<br>
that have two linear carbon chains with the branch point always at the second<br>
carbon position. Guerbet alcohols are chemically described as 2-alkyl-1-alkanols.<br>
Examples of Guerbet alcohols include 2-ethyl-1 -hexanol, 2-hexyl-1-decanol, 2-<br>
octyl-1-decanol, 2-octyl-1-dodecanol, 2-hexyl-1-dodecanol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Guerbet alcohols are commercially available from Sasol Chemie GmbH as Isofol®<br>
alcohols.<br>
When a compound (c) is used, the melamine aldehyde resin, the diol, and<br>
compound (c) are reacted together in an amount such that the ratio of hydroxyl<br>
groups and the single functional group capable of reacting with the melamine<br>
aldehyde resin of compound (c) to the total number of R1 to R6 groups is typically in<br>
the range of 0.5 to 3, or 1 to 2.5, or 1.25 to 2.25.<br>
In one embodiment the melamine poiyols-of the present invention have a number<br>
average molecular weight between 700 and 4000; in another embodiment between<br>
1500 and 3000. Within these ranges, the molecular weight of the melamine polyol<br>
may be customized through the choice of the diol utilized for the reaction. In one<br>
embodiment, the melamine polyols have a low polydispersity, such as Mw/Mn<br>
=3.5, ==2.5, or=2. The melamine poiyols of the present invention have a hydroxyl<br>
equivalent weight of 75 to 350, in one embodiment in the range of 100 to 300.<br>
Preparation of the melamine polyols<br>
The melamine aldehyde resin and a,aß-diol or a,ß-diols may be reacted in the<br>
presence of an acid catalyst. The acid catalyst may be blocked or unblocked.<br>
Examples of suitable catalysts include but are not limited to mineral acids, such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid, dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid<br>
(DDBSA), dinonylnaphthalene sulphonic acid (DNNSA), oxalic acid, hexamic acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, alkyl phospahate esters, phthalic acid, copolymerized acrylic acid,<br>
and metal salt catalysts, such as magnesium bromide. Zinc or magnesium nitrates<br>
may also be utilized, although discoloration may occur at temperatures greater<br>
than about 120°C. Sulphonic acids such as paratoluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) is<br>
less corrosive to equipment as the mineral acids may negatively influence the<br>
coating properties. Of course, the particular choice of catalyst type and amount will<br>
be dictated upon a number of factors such as the chosen components being<br>
reacted and the chosen reaction conditions. These and other factors are well-<br>
known to those skilled in the art, who can make proper choices accordingly. The<br>
skilled person may also choose catalyst type and amount that will limit the amount<br>
of residual diol in the reaction mixture. Further, due to the tendency of melamine<br>
resin to self-condense, the catalyst should be chosen based on the reaction<br>
temperature being utilized.<br>
In one embodiment, the acid catalyst is present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to<br>
5 wt.% on solids; in another 0.01 to 7.5 wt.%, in yet another 0.1 to 5 wt.%.<br>
Optionally, solvents may be added to the present reaction. Suitable solvents<br>
include but are not limited to ketones, ester acetates, alcohols and aromatics.<br>
Water-miscible solvents may be used such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and<br>
dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether. In one embodiment the solvent is butyl acetate.<br>
A neutralizing agent may be added after the reaction to neutralize the acid<br>
catalyst. Examples include tri ethyl amine, 2-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-1-propanol,<br>
2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-imino-a-phenyl-3-thiazolidine ethanol, diethylene<br>
triamine, dimethylethanolamine, isophoronediamine, morpholine, A/,A/-diethyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine, A/-ethylmorphonoline, piperidine, pyridine, triethanolamine, and<br>
trimethylhexanediamine.<br>
The preparation may be carried out under a nitrogen blanket.<br>
The novel melamine polyols of the present invention may be produced at least by<br>
one of three processes depending upon the desired molecular weight and solids<br>
content characteristics of the resulting melamine polyol.<br>
Method A<br>
In one embodiment, the melamine aldehyde resin(s) is fed into the diol<br>
component(s), in the presence of the catalyst, at a temperature range between<br>
about 50°C and about 130°C during a two to three hour time period and held for an<br>
additional time period after such feeding is complete. Subsequently, a neutralizing,<br>
agent may be added to neutralize the acid catalyst. In one embodiment, the<br>
reaction is carried out at temperatures between about 95°C and 130°C; in another<br>
embodiment between 115°C and 120°C. The resulting melamine poiyols have,<br>
relative to other melamine polyols according to this invention, high number average<br>
molecular weights between about 2000 to 3000. Such melamine poiyols also have<br>
low viscosities, e.g. between about 25 cps and 700 cps, i.e. Brookfield viscosity<br>
measured at 40% solid content at 25°C, spindle #4 and 20 RPM, which makes<br>
them particularly useful for spray applied coating compositions.<br>
Method B<br>
In another, embodiment, the melamine aldehyde resin(s) is fed into the diol<br>
component(s) at a temperature between about 50°C and about 80°C, typically for<br>
2-3 hours, followed by acid catalyst neutralization and alcohol distillation at a<br>
temperature about 85°C to about 130°C. Subsequently, another amount of<br>
neutralizing agent may be added to neutralize the acid catalyst further. Melamine<br>
poiyols that are the reaction product of this process B will have, relative to other<br>
melamine poiyols of the present invention, a low number average molecular<br>
weight, e.g. between about 1500 to 2000. Such melamine poiyols have Brookfield<br>

Alternatively, the process can be carried out under vacuum. Then, the melamine<br>
aldehyde resin(s) is fed into the diol component(s) at a temperature between about<br>
50°C and about 80°C under a vacuum of 50 to 100 mbar, in one embodiment for 2-<br>
3 hours, followed by acid catalyst neutralization and alcohol distillation at a<br>
temperature about 50°C and about 80°C under a vacuum of 50 to 100 mbar.<br>
Subsequently, another amount of neutralizing agent may be added to neutralize<br>
the acid catalyst further.<br>
Coating compositions comprising melamine polyols<br>
The invention also relates to coating compositions comprising at least one<br>
melamine polyol and at least one crosslinker.<br>
There are numerous kinds of hydroxyl group-reactive crosslinkers which can be<br>
used with the melamine polyols, such as polyisocyanates, blocked polyisocyanates<br>
and/or aminoplast resins.<br>
The aminoplast resins are generally speaking aldehyde condensation products of<br>
melamine, urea, benzoguanamine or similar compounds. The most commonly<br>
used aldehyde is formaldehyde. These condensation products contain methylol or<br>
similar alkylol groups, and these alkylol groups are commonly at least partly<br>
etherified with an alcohol, such as methanol or butanol, to form alkylated ethers.<br>
The crosslinker resin can be substantially monomeric or polymeric depending on<br>
the desired final properties of the cured coating. Monomeric melamine resins allow<br>
the formulation of coatings with higher solids contents. Polymeric melamines are<br>
useful in coatings where the use of a strong acid catalyst should be avoided.<br>
Examples of readily available amino crosslinkers of the kind described above<br>
include: hexamethoxymethylmelamine, such as Cymel 303, available from Cytec<br>
Industries, Inc.; mixed ether methoxy/butoxy methylmelamine, such as Cymel<br>
1135, also available from Cytec; polymeric butoxy methylmelamine, such as M-<br>
281-M, available from Cook Composites and Polymers; and high imino polymeric<br>
methoxymethylmelamine, such as Cymel 325, available from Cytec. This list could<br>
include many other crosslinkers which differ by degree of polymerization, imino<br>
content, free methylol content, and ratios of alcohols used for etherification.<br>
These aminoplast crosslinking agents can be utilized in widely varying weight<br>
ratios of melamine polyol to aminoplast, generally ranging from about 90:10 to<br>
40:60, and in one embodiment about 90:10 to 50:50.<br>
The polyisocyanate compound is a cross-linker which reacts with hydroxy groups.<br>
Polyisocyanates are compounds with two or more isocyanate groups per molecule,<br>
and are well-known in the coating art. Suitable polyisocyanates are aliphatic<br>
polyisocyanates such as trimethylene diisocyanate, 1,2-propylene diisocyanate,<br>

cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 4-methyl-1,3-cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-<br>
dicyclohexylene diisocyanate methane, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-dicyclohexylene<br>
diisocyanate methane, norbornane diisocyanate, and isophorone diisocyanate;<br>
aromatic polyisocyanates such as m- and p-phenylene diisocyanate, 1,3- and 1,4-<br>
bis(isocyanate methyl) benzene, 1,5-dimethyl-2,4-bis(isocyanate methyl) benzene,<br>
1,3,5-triisocyanate benzene, 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate, 2,4,6-toluene<br>
triisocyanate, a,a,a',a'-tetramethyl o-, m-, and p-xylylene diisocyanate, 4,4'-<br>
diphenylene diisocyanate methane, 4,4'-diphenylene diisocyanate, 3,3'-dichloro-<br>
4,4'-diphenylene diisocyanate, and naphthalene-1,5-diisocyanate; and mixtures of<br>
the aforementioned polyisocyanates:<br>
Also, such compounds may be adducts of polyisocyanates, e.g., biurets,<br>
isocyanurates, allophanates, uretdiones, prepolymers of polyisocyanates, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Examples of such adducts are the adduct of two molecules of<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate to a diol such as ethylene<br>
glycol, the adduct of 3 molecules of hexamethylene diisocyanate to 1 molecule of<br>

Furthermore, (co)polymers of isocyanate-functional monomers such as a,a'-<br>
dimethyl-m-isopropenyl benzyl isocyanate are suitable for use.<br>
The above-mentioned isocyanates and adducts thereof may be present in the form<br>
of blocked isocyanates, as is known to the skilled person. The blocking agents for<br>
the blocked polyisocyanate can be ketoximes, alcohols, phenolic compounds,<br>
malonic esters or acetoacetates.<br>
The polyisocyanate compound is used in an amount such that the ratio of<br>
isocyanate groups to the total number of hydroxy groups in the coating composition<br>
is in the range 0.5 to 3, and in one embodiment 0.8 to 2.<br>
The coating composition can also comprise catalysts. Examples of catalysts for the<br>
isocyanate-hydroxy reaction include dibutyl tin dilaurate, triethyl amine, and the<br>
like. Generally, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of the active catalyst is used, based on<br>
the coating formulation nonvolatile content.<br>
Acid catalysts are used to increase the rate of the crosslinking reaction in<br>
melamine-cured compositions. Generally, 0.1 to 5 percent by weight of the active<br>
catalyst is used, based on the coating formulation nonvolatile content. These acids<br>
may be blocked by a suitable compound, so that the catalyst is inactive until the<br>
coating is baked. Optionally, the catalyst may be used in an unblocked form, which<br>
may necessitate the formulation of a two- component coating. Examples of acids<br>
which may be used include phosphoric acid, alkyl acid phosphates, sulfonic acid<br>
and substituted sulfonic acids, and maleic acid or alkyl acid maleates. Examples of<br>
readily available catalysts include: para-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) such as Cycat<br>
4040, available from Cytek; dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DDBSA) such as Bio-<br>
Soft 5-100, available from Stepan; phenyl acid phosphate (PAP); amine blocked<br>
DDBSA, such as Nacure 5226 and Nacure XP-158, available from King Industries;<br>
amine blocked PTSA, such as VP-451, available from Byk-Mallinckrodt;<br>
dinonylnaphthalene disulfonic acid (DNNDSA); and maleic acid. This list could<br>
include numerous additional catalysts (blocked and unblocked) known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The type of catalyst used is determined by the desired bake<br>
schedule.<br>
The coating compositions may also contain pigments. Inorganic as well as organic<br>
pigments can be used. The composition can further comprise conventional<br>
additives, such as stabilizers, surfactants, fillers, UV-absorbers, catalyst blockers,<br>
anti-oxidants, pigment dispersants, flow additives, rheology control agents,<br>
levelling agents, and solvents. The solvent can be any solvent known in the art.,<br>
i.e. aliphatic and/ or aromatic hydrocarbons. Examples include Solvesso® 100,<br>
toluene, xylene, butanol, isopropanol, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, acetone, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, ether, ether alcohol,<br>
and ether ester, or a mixture of any of these.<br>
in addition to the melamine poiyols and the crosslinker other compounds may be<br>
present in the coating composition according to the present invention. Such<br>
compounds may be main binders and/or reactive diluents. Examples include<br>
hydroxyl-functional binders, e.g., polyester polyols, polyether polyols, polyacrylate<br>
polyols, polyurethane polyols, cellulose acetobutyrate, hydroxyl-functional epoxy<br>
resins, alkyds, and dendrimeric polyols. These hydroxyl-functional binders can be<br>
utilized in widely varying weight ratios of melamine polyol to hydroxyl-functional<br>
binders, generally ranging from about 10:90 to 90:10, and in one embodiment from<br>
about 25:75 to 75:25.<br>
In one embodiment the coating composition comprises less than 500 g/l of volatile<br>
organic solvent based on the total composition; in another embodiment less than<br>
480 g/l; in yet another embodiment less than 420 g/l. The solid content in one<br>
embodiment is higher than 50 wt.%; in another embodiment higher than 52 wt.%;<br>
and in yet another higher than 58 wt.%.<br>
The coating compositions are formulated in a 1-, 2-, or 3-component system,<br>
depending on the choice of crosslinker and catalyst in the system.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention may be applied to any substrate.<br>
The substrate may be, for example, metal, plastic, wood, glass, ceramic, or<br>
another coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating<br>
composition of the current invention or it may be a different coating composition.<br>
The coating compositions of the current invention show particular utility as<br>
clearcoats, basecoats, pigmented topcoats, primers, and fillers. One embodiment<br>
of the current invention is the use of the coating composition of the present<br>
invention as clearcoat. In the case of the coating composition being a clearcoat,<br>
the basecoat may be a conventional basecoat known in the coating art. The<br>
clearcoat composition is then applied to the surface of a basecoat and then cured.<br>
An intermediate curing step for the basecoat may be introduced.<br>
The coating compositions can be applied by conventional means such as by spray<br>
gun, brush, or roller. Curing temperatures are in one embodiment between 0 and<br>
200°C, and in another embodiment between 20 and 100°C.<br>
The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal<br>
substrates, such as in the refinish industry, such as in the body shop, to repair<br>
automobiles and transportation vehicles and in finishing large transportation<br>
vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes. The coating compositions<br>
comprising the novel melamine polyols are also well in the preparation of coated<br>
plastics. Plastics are used in an increasing number of interior and exterior<br>
applications in the automotive industry, such as airbag covers, bumpers, fascias,<br>
fenders, wing mirrors, door panels, panel hoods, panel roofs, and panel trunk lids.<br>
In another embodiment, coating formulations according to the present invention<br>
also can be used for a wide range of industrial coating applications including coil<br>
and wood.<br>

Steel panels were coated with a black two component Akzo Nobel AT 331<br>
basecoat at a dry film thickness of about 20 microns. The clear coat compositions<br>
as prepared above were applied by spray gun over the basecoat in a wet-on-wet<br>
application. The coatings were baked at 180°F (82°C) for 30 minutes. The<br>
properties of the coating compositions were compared to the control system where<br>
the clear coat had no melamine polyol.<br>
All systems performed similar in terms of cure response as measured by Tukon<br>
hardness and MEK double rubs.<br>
One test where the compositions according to the invention performed superior to<br>
the control coating composition was the gloss retention by the Car Wash test. The<br>
ability of a coating to perform against scratches encountered during car wash is<br>
simulated in the Car wash bench tester, approved as test equipment in OEM<br>
specification. The % gloss loss after the test is a measurement of scratch<br>
resistance. How much lower the number, how much better the scratch resistance.<br>
In duplicate testing for this test, the coating composition of Example 27 based on<br>
acrylic polyol showed about 50% less reduction in gloss than the control E. The<br>
coating composition of Example 28 based on polyester polyol showed about 30%<br>
less reduction in gloss than the control E.<br>
Example 29 and comparative Example F<br>
A melamine polyol prepared according to example 2 was evaluated in a 1K clear<br>
coat along with a coating composition comprising the reactants Cymel 303 and 2-<br>
n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol in the same ratio as used to prepare the<br>
melaminepolyol. The 1K coating composition comprises the melamine polyol or its<br>
reactants and Cymel 303 as a crosslinker in an amount of 80 wt.% melamine<br>
polyol and 20 wt.% crosslinker based on total solids and 0.5 wt.% based on total<br>
solids of a catalyst, i.e. blocked dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid.<br>
Although both these coating compositions had cure response in a pot, according to<br>
ASTM 2369 (1 hour, 110°C) comparative Example F showed a drop by about 14%<br>
in non-volatiles when compared to its theoretical %. This indicates that some 2-n-<br>
butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol has volatilized during the curing process. In contrast,<br>
a coating composition based on the melamine polyol according to the invention<br>
showed no significant difference (less than 3%) between the theoretical and<br>
experimental values in % non-volatiles.<br>
Example 30<br>
A clear coat composition was prepared with a  polyacrylate polyol prepared<br>
according to Example A4 disclosed in non-published patent application EP<br>
05107563.8 and a melamine polyol according to the present invention. The clear<br>
coat composition was prepared as set forth in the Table 9 below<br>
Table 9: clear coat formulations                    <br>
The clear coat formulation had a NCO:OH ratio of 1:1. The solid content of the<br>
coating composition was 61.4%. The VOC was 389 g/l.<br>
A steel panels was coated with a dark grey metallic water based basecoat<br>
composition. The clear coat as prepared above was applied by spray gun over the<br>
basecoat. The bottom of the panel received an additional layer to check pinhole<br>
sensitivity. The coatings were cured at 60°C. The properties of the coating<br>
compositions are listed in Table 10.<br>
