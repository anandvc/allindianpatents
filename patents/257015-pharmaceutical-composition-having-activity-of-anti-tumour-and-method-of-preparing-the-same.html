Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of medicine. More specifically, the present invention relates to Temozolomide-8-carboxylate derivatives, method for preparing it, compositions comprising them and the use of the derivatives and compositions in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of tumor, in particular to the use of the compound and the composition in an oral and transdermal preparation for treatment of tumor such as skin carcinoma, brain carcinoma and lymphoma.<br>
Background Art<br>
Temozolomide (hereinafter referred to as "TMZ"), an alkylating agent for treatment of carcinoma, has a broad-spectrum bioactivity of anti-tumor [L.H. Tsang, et al. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 27 (1991): 342-346], which in particular has bioactivity for treatment neuroglioma (brain carcinoma) and malignant melanoma (skin carcinoma). In some western countries, the TMZ capsule had been approved to be used for the treatment of malignant neuroglioma. WO 0057867 described a method by using TMZ at a cyclical schedule. Also, the TMZ capsule has been approved to be used clinically in China. Phase II clinical trials showed that TMZ had activity for curing malignant melanoma [N.M. Bleehen, et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 13 (1995): 910-913], and recent phase III clinical trials revealed that TMZ has the same activity as the dacarbazine for curing malignant melanoma [M.R. Middleton, et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 18 (2000): 158-166] even with the similar side effects between them such as leucocytopenia, nausea, vomit, hair loss, red rash and constipation. Besides, oral administration of TMZ displayed dose-limiting myelotoxicity [A.M. Heimberger, et al. Clin. Can. Res. 6 (2000): 4148-4153]. Previous study on changing formulation exhibited that intrathecal injection administration of TMZ solution could decrease the side effects [J.H. Sampson, et al. Clin. Can. Res. 5 (1999): 1183-1188]. So it should be deemed that the transdermal formulation is the ideal for TMZ to cure skin carcinoma, especially during the early period. Some studies have proven that local administration of toremifene on site of carcinoma might result in a high local concentration, while lowering the systematic concentration [L. Soe, et al. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 39 (1997): 513-520], which brought about lower systematic toxicity.<br>
Generally, percutaneous administration is conditioned by both the skin barrier and the physicochemical properties of drug. Instability and insolubility of said drug prevent it from being made into formulations. Studies, as published in WO0057867, showed that its<br><br>
inability to permeate artificial skin (silicon membrane), rat skin and human skin rendered it impossible to be made into transdermal formulations. In view of this, the application of TMZ will be limited to a great extent.<br>
Previously, aiming at structure modification, a lot of derivatives has been synthesized,<br><br>
On the other hand, the compounds of imidazo[5,l-d]-l,2,3,5-tetrazin-4-one, typically represented by TMZ, share a common trait of so bad solubility, that they can hardly be dissolved in any common-used solvents such as ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and water. They exhibit a slight solubility of about 1-5% in the blend of organic solvent and water, for example the aqueous solution of acetic acid, acetonitrile, acetone, methanol or ethanol with the concentration of 1-10%. Even in the non-protonic polar solvent-DMSO, their solubility is about 5%. In addition, another trait of these compounds is their instability, which is embodied not simply by their sensibility to light, what is more, by their sensibility to alkaline mediums with pH value more than 7 and those mediums with nucleophilic group such as the compounds containing amidogen, hydroxyl and mercapto group. For example, the environment of the pH value more than 7 will make these compounds rapidly decomposing and changing color (red); the same story may occur in the methanol and ethanol. It is therefore limited for the methanol and ethanol to be used as the solubilizer in manufacturing preparations. So it seems to be much desired to develop a novel bioactive compound and to seek the methods for enhancing its stability and solubility in the application of the pharmaceutical industry.<br>

In	view	of	the	good	properties	of	the<br>
3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,l-d]-l,2,3,5-tetrazine-8-carboxylate derivatives capable of penetrating skin, the most preferred formulations for them are topically administered transdermal formulation, including tincture, suspension, emulsion, ointment, gel, suppository, film and patch etc. As a rule, the topically administered transdermal formulations generally comprise excipients such as the oil medium, surfactant and the like.<br>
Said oil medium used in the topically administered transdermal formulations is selected from a group consisting of oleic acid, isopropyl myristate (IPM), lauric acid, beeswax, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, liquid paraffin, vaseline, anhydrous lanolin, stearic acid, cottonseed oil, castor oil, linolenic acid and triglyceride etc. Said common used surfactant is selected from a group consisting of the phospholipid, Myrj type, Brij type, Tween type, acacia, tragacanth, glutin, and vitamin E TPGS (VE TPGS) etc.<br>
The preferred topically administered transdermal patches for the TMZ-8-carboxylate are classified into two groups: matrix type and reservoir type. The matrix type can be classified into the single matrix (AM) and poly matrix (PM). And the reservoir type includes the liquid reservoir system (LRS) and solid reservoir system (SRS), which is composed of multi-layer adhesive (MLA) and multi-layer polymer matrix (MLM). Basically, both matrix and reservoir type of topically administered transdermal formulations of TMZ-8-carboxylates substantially comprising: matrix, polymer materials, drug reservoir (namely drug solution or suspension), rate-moderated membrane, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) and release layer for protecting PSAs. Further discussion is given as follows:<br>
Solid reservoir type patch: the matrix is the transparent and stable microemulsion and their formulation forms, formed by water phase, oil phase and surfactants at different ratio, which is classified into the liquid and solid type reservoir patch. Said solid type reservoir patch may select either oleic acid or isopropyl myristate (IPM) as the oil phase, lauric acid, beeswax, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, liquid paraffin, vaseline, anhydrous lanolin, stearic acid, cottonseed oil, castor oil and linolenic acid is also selected as the oil phase.<br>
The preferred oil phase of the TMZ-8-carboxylate solid reservoir patch of the invention is the isopropyl myristate (IPM) or oleic acid, the preferred water phase is water, and the preferred surfactant is VE TPGS and citric acid.<br>

The studies showed that, compared with TMZ, the lipid solubility of TMZ-8-carboxylate derivatives have been significantly improved. For example, taking Log P as standard, Log P for TMZ is -0.66, while Log P for n-hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate is 2.56. It means that n-hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate is an ideal drug for topically transdermal administration (As the method for measuring Log P, See Leo and Hansch I Chemical Reviews 71 No.6, December 1971 (Partition Coefficients and Their Uses, Leo A., Hansch C. and Elkins D.).<br>

Apparatus: BIORAD 550 enzyme labeling instrument.<br>
Method:<br>
Tetrazolium salt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide ! MTT] reduction assay was used. All the well-grown carcinoma cells were collected, prepared   into   lxl04,nil   cell   suspension   with   the   RPMI   1640   culture   solution<br><br>
containing 10% calf serum, and inoculated in 96-well culture plate, with lOOuL per well (containing 1000 cancer cells). After 24 hours of culture in 5% CO2 thermos incubator at temperature of 37°C the drugs were added. Blank control group was established and the drug for the positive control was Fluorouracil. The tested drugs were divided into five groups at different concentrations, each concentration was tested for three times parallelly, and placed in 5% CO2 thermos incubator at temperature of 37i ! to culture for four days. The culture solution was discarded and lOOuL of MTT solution (0.4mg,ml, prepared with RPMI 1640) was added per well to continue to culture for four hours at temperature of 37°C. The supernate was discarded and 150uL of DMSO was added to dissolve Fomazan granules. After slight agitation, the OD value was measured with BIORAD 550 enzyme labeling instrument at the measuring wavelength of 540nm and the reference wavelength of 450nm.<br>

Data of cell inhibiting rate was then plotted vs. the concentration of drugs to obtain the dose-reaction curve, by which 50% inhibitory concentration IC50 was calculated (see Table 1 and Table 2).<br>
The result (see Table 1) showed that the IC50 ranges for the selected cell strains of four drugs (methyl TMZ-8-carboxylate, butyl TMZ-8-carboxylate, n-hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate and TMZ acid) were 10-30ug,ml, and no significant difference among them in acting on the cells was observed.<br><br><br>
xenotransplanted human melanoma in MV3 nude mouse<br>
Hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate was selected as the representative to investigate the influence of TMZ-8-carboxylate derivatives on the growth of xenotransplanted human melanoma in MV3 nude mouse.<br>
Hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate was dissolved in DMSO to obtain 50mg,ml solution. Human melanoma was xenotransplanted to nude mouse of BALB,c-nu to allow it to grow. Until the tumor expanded to the volume of 100-300mm3, all animals were divided into two groups in accordance with the size of tumor, eight mice per group.<br>
Of these two groups, one was the treatment group in therapeutical treatment by spreading the solution of hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate; another was the control group where the tumor grows naturally.<br>
In the treatment group, the drug was administered by spreading drug at the position of tumor and surrounding area (2cmx2cm) twice a day (once on Saturday and Sunday). Every time, when the solution was dried, administration was repeated for 1 to 2 times. The daily average dose of hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate administered for a mouse totally was about 20mg.<br>
The volume of tumor in mouse was measured twice a week, so as to observe and record their growth dynamically. Until the tumor of the control group grew up to a certain volume, all the mice were killed the tumors were stripped off and weighed, growth inhibition rate was calculated. Tumor proliferation (T,C(%)) was calculated using relative volume of tumor in two groups.<br>
Tumor volume (TV) was calculated by the equation as follows:<br>
Length x width,2 The relative tumor volume is calculated by the equation as follows:<br>
Vt,Vo<br>
Wherein the V0 is the TV measured at the time when the animals were raised in separate cages, and V0 is the TV measured each time after.<br>
The t-test was used to compare the statistical difference between two groups in many indexes such as tumor weight, TV and RTV. The relative tumor proliferation rate (T,C(%))was used as the index of bioactivity for anti tumor, which was calculated as follows:<br><br><br>
The effect was evaluated by statistical analysis. The effect was regarded as invalid when T,C (%) is more than 60, and as effective when T,C (%) is equal to or less than 60 and p
The results showed that hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate had significant inhibiting effects on the growth of carcinomas in the mice, and strong killing effects on carcinoma cells such as human melanoma MV3, 20mg of which daily externally-administered in a mouse had manifested actions in inhibiting grafted carcinomas. By the end of experiment, comparing with the control group, there were statistically significant difference for both weight and volume of tumor. The results may be seen in Figure 1, 2 and Table 2. Figure 1 shows the effect on growth of human melanomas by spreading hexyl TMZ-8-carboxylate can be seen that the growth of human melanomas in the treatment group has been inhibited markedly compared with the control group  or negative control group 1.

Best modes for carrying out the invention<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without any way limiting its scope.<br>
Example 1 Preparation of TMZ acid (EP0252682)<br>
TMZ (2.577mmol, 0. 5g) was mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid (4ml) with agitation. Sodium nitrite (9.4mmol, 0.65g) was dissolved in 2.6ml of water and then dropped into aforementioned mixture on an ice bath at temperature of below 15 , to stir at room temperature overnight. The resulting mixture continued to be added with lOg of ice and cool for 1 hour in ice-bath. The solid product was colleted by filtration, and dried in vacuo to give 0.493g of TMZ acid. The yield was 98.6%.<br>
Example 2 Preparation of TMZ-8-carboxylate<br>
The mixture of anhydrous DMF (2ml) and THF (3ml) was injected into a flask filled with TMZ acid (lmmol, 0.195g) prepared in accordance of Example 1 and Pybrop (lmmol, 0.466g), to stir to let the solid fully dissolved, into which, under the condition of ice bath, DMAP (2mmol, 0.244g) was added. Then, an appropriate amount of anhydrous hydrocarbon alcohol or mercaptan (2.2mmol) was injected into the resulting mixture to continue to react for half an hour, and stirred at room temperature overnight. After the reaction was completed, the suspension was filtrated by Buchner's funnel. The obtained mother liquor was distilled; the residue was added with lOg of ice and extracted by ethyl acetate (10 mix 3). The ethyl acetate phase was combined and dried by anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Ethyl acetate was eliminated by rotating-evaporation to obtain the residues. The residues were sequentially purified with silica gel column and the final product was given after evaporating solvents.<br>
