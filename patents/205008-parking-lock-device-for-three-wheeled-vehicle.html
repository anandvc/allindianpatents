HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Mmamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of   the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
20 JUL 2001<br><br><br><br>
 [Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a parking lock device for a three-wheeled vehicle suitable for lowering manufacturing costs and maintenance costs.<br>
As a parking lock device in a three-wheeled vehicle in which one front wheel is mounted on the front body, two wheels are mounted on the rear body, these front body and rear body being joined to be rolled freely by a joint part, the rear body being provided with a rear-wheel lock mechanism for locking the rear wheel by a brake or the like whereby at the time of parking, rolling movement of the front body and the rear body is locked to lock (brake) the rear wheels, there has been known "A parking lock device for an oscillating type three-wheeled vehicle" .disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.<br>
A description will be made with reference to Figs. 15 and 16 which correspond to Figs. 1 and 2 of the aforementioned Patent Publication. Fig. 15 shows the main parts in the original Fig. 1. Reference numerals used indicate those used in the aforementioned Patent Publication.<br>
Fig.15 is a side view of main parts of a conventional three-wheeled vehicle. An oscillating type three-wheeled<br><br>
vehicle 200 is a vehicle in which a front body 201 on the front wheel side and a rear body 202 on the rear wheel side constitute a vehicle body, an oscillating joint 203 is mounted vertically movably by means of a pin 201a at the rear of the front body 201, a rear frame 204 is mounted at the rear of the oscillating joint 203, a rear wheel 205 and a brake arm 206 of a brake for braking the rear wheel 205 are arranged on the rear frame 204 side, a lock operating lever (not shown) for carrying out the parking lock is provided in the vicinity of a handle of the front body 201, and a single operating cable 207 is connected to the oscillating joint 203 and the brake arm 206 from the lock operating lever.<br>
Fig. 16 is a sectional view of a conventional oscillating joint, in which a support shaft 211 is rotatably mounted on a lower case 208 and an upper case (not shown) of the oscillating joint 203, a stopper plate 212 is mounted on the front end of the support shaft 211, a stopper pole 213 and a swing arm 214 are mounted in a manner free to swing on a lower case 208 for locking the rotation of the stopper plate 212, an inner (wire) 215 of the operating cable 207 is connected to the end of the swing arm 214, and the outer tube side of the operating cable 207 is divided into an outer 216 and an outer 207 with respect to the single inner (wire) 215.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the art of the aforementioned Publication, mounting locations of the operating cable 207 on the body are a point<br><br>
218 on the oscillating joint 203 and a point 219 in the vicinity of the brake arm 206, and since the points 218 and 219 are subjected to relative rolling movement by the oscillating joint 203, the operating cable 207 is twisted in a short distance (distance DA) between the points 218 and 219 to impose a burden to the operating cable 207. Accordingly, it is contemplated that in a case where miniaturization of the body is studied, if dimension of the oscillating joint203 is simply reduced, the twisting of the operating cable 207 becomes further increased, resulting in a shorter life of the operating cable 207, which poses restriction when miniaturization is taken into consideration.<br>
Further, in Fig. 16, since the operating joint 207 has its halfway connected to the oscillating joint 203, a plurality of parts are mounted in order that the outer tube side is divided (into the outer 216 and the outer 217), and the swing arm 214 is connected to the inner (wire) 215, which makes the construction of the operating cable 207 complicated, bringing forth an increase in manufacturing costs, and requiring many steps for the maintenance for mounting and dismounting or replacement of the operating cable 207.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention, in a paring lock device for a three-wheeled vehicle, to miniaturize the body without receiving great restriction to reduce the weight, and to simplify the construction to lower parts costs and maintenance costs.<br><br>
[Means for solving the Problem]<br>
For achieving the aforesaid object, the claim 1 provided a parking lock device for a three-wheeled vehicle in which a front body having a front wheel mounted thereon and a rear body having rear wheels mounted thereon are joined by a substantially laterally extending shaft and a bearing to thereby connect the front body and the rear body to be relatively rollable, and by drawing a cable at the time of parking, the relative rolling between the front body and the rear body can be locked, and the rotation of the rear wheels can be locked, characterized in that said front body is provided with a parking lever for drawing said cable, said rear body is provided with a rear-wheel lock mechanism for locking the rear wheels, a joint part between said shaft and said bearing is provided with a roll lock mechanism for locking the relative rotation between said shaft and said bearing, a front half part of the cable is extended over between said parking lever and said rear-wheel lock mechanism, and a rear half part of the cable is extended over between said rear-wheel lock mechanism and said roll lock mechanism.<br>
Since the front half part of the cable is extended over between the front body and the rear body, the twisting of the cable caused by the relative rolling between the front body and the rear body is absorbed in a long distance as compared with prior art. Thereby, even if the joint part is miniaturized, the excessive load is not applied to the cable to enable<br><br>
extension of the service life of the cable.<br>
According to claim 2, the front half part of said cable is constituted by a first cable, and the rear half part of said cable is constituted by a second cable separately from the cable.<br>
The first cable and the second cable can be made simple in construction. For example, if general cables are used, parts costs can be reduced considerably. Further, maintenance costs of cables can be lowered.<br>

The operation of the parking lock device 135 described above will be described hereinafter.<br>
Fig. 10 is a first operation view for describing the operation of the parking lock device according to the present invention.<br>
For parking the three-wheeled vehicle, first, when the parking lever 97 is pulled up as shown by the arrow from a position indicated by the imaginary line, the arm part 123 swings clockwise as the parking lever 97 swings so that the roller 124 pushes down one end of the link member 98 while coming into contact with the curved edge 126 of the link member 98, and therefore the link member 98 swings counterclockwise as indicated by the arrow, and the other end of the link member 98 moves up to pull the inner cable 128 of the cable for locking rear wheels 101 through the end hardware 127.<br>
Fig. 11 is a second operation view for describing the operation of the parking lock device according to the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
When the inner cable 128 of the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is pulled, the operating lever 105 mounted at the rear of the power unit 37 swings clockwise to pull the inner cable 82 of the cable for roll lock 81.<br>
Fig. 12 is a third operation view for describing the operation of the parking lock device according to the present invention.<br>
When the operating lever 105 (see Fig. 11) swings clockwise, the swing shaft 106 rotates to swing the arm-like member 116 clockwise, and the pawl 117 of the arm-like member 116 meshes with the tooth 118 of the parking gear 115, because of which the parking gear 115 and the parking shaft 14 become disabled to rotate so that the output shaft 37a of the power unit 37 shown in Fig. 6 connected to the parking shaft 114 becomes locked and the rear wheels 41, 42 are locked.<br>
Fig. 13 is a fourth action view for describing the operation of the parking lock device according to the present invention.<br>
When the inner cable 82 of the cable for roll lock 81 is pulled, the second arm-like member 74 swings counterclockwise about the swing shaft 87, and accordingly, the first arm-like member 71 also swings counterclockwise about the swing shaft 86 through the link member 75, because of which the pawl 78 of the first arm-like member 73 meshes with the tooth 77 of the sideway projecting member 69.<br><br>
Accordingly, the rotation of the joint shaft 58 becomes locked to enable locking the relative roll between the front body 25 and the rear body 43 shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Such a roll lock as described is carried out in order to prevent the front body 25 or the rear body 43 from rolling due to the unexpected cause to be fallen down, or to prevent the unnecessary force from applying to the damper part 61 of the joint case 31.<br>
Figs. 14 (a) and (b) are a fifth action view for describing the operation of the parking lock device according to the present invention.<br>
The (a) shows that the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is secured by the cable mounting bracket 102 on the side of the body frame 11 of the front body 25 and secured by the cable mounting bracket 103 on the lower side of the power unit 37 of the rear body 43, whereby the distance DB between the cable mounting brackets 102 and 103 is set to be long.<br>
In the past, for example, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 15, the operating cable (in the present invention, the cable for locking rear wheels) is secured at the distance DA between the oscillating joint (in the present invention, the joint case) and the brake lever (in the present invention, the rear body), whereas in the present invention, as shown in the (a) , the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is secured at the distance DB between the front body 25 and the rear body 43, and therefore.<br><br>
setting to DB&gt;DA is easy. In the present invention, even if the external dimension (dimension in the lateral direction of the body) should be made small, it will be advantageous, with respect to the torsion of the cable for locking rear wheels 101, as compared with prior art that the torsion is absorbed by the oscillating joint and the rear body.<br>
In the (b), for example, supposing that the front body 25 has rolled as indicated by the arrow about the shaft center 53 of the joint shaft 58 (see Fig. 3) of the joint case 31 with respect to the rear body 43, the cable for locking rear wheels 101 between the cable mounting brackets 102 and 103 is twisted. Since the distance between the cable mounting brackets 102 and 103 is set to be long, however, the angle of torsion of the cable for locking rear wheels 101 can be made small to prevent the cable for locking rear wheels 101 from being forcibly twisted.<br>
Further, since the cable for roll 81 is mounted on the rear body 43 connected integral with the joint case 31, it is possible to make nothing to do with the roll of the front body 25, enabling the provision of the constitution in which no torsion occurs in the cable for roll lock 81.<br>
As described above with reference to Figs. 3 and 6, in the present invention provides the parking lock device 135 for the three-wheeled vehicle 10 (see Fig. 1) wherein the front body 25 having the front wheel 13 mounted and he rear body 43<br><br>
having the rear wheels 41, 42 mounted are joined by the joint shaft 58 extending in a substantially lateral direction of the vehicle and the case body 55 whereby the front body 25 and the rear body 43 are connected in a manner free to roll relatively, and at the time of parking, the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is pulled whereby the relative rolling between the front body 25 and the rear body 43 can be locked, and the rotation of the rear wheels 41, 42 can be locked, characterized in that the parking lever 97 for drawing the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is provided on the body, the rear wheel lock mechanism 113 for locking the rear wheels 41, 42 is provided on the rear body 43, the roll lock mechanism 62 for locking the relative rotation between the joint shaft 58 and the case body 55 is provided on the joint case 31 provided with the joint shaft 58 and the case body 55, the cable for locking the rear wheels 101 is extended over between the parking lever 97 and the rear wheel lock mechanism 113, and the cable for roll lock 81 is extended over between the rear wheel lock mechanism 113 and the roll lock mechanism 62.<br>
Since the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is extended over between the front body 25 and the rear body 43, the torsion of the cable for locking rear wheels 101 caused the relative roll between the front body 25 and the rear body 43 can be absorbed at the long distance DB (see Fig. 14 (a) ) as compared with prior art. Thereby, the excessive load is not applied to the cable for locking rear wheels 101, and the service life of the cable for locking rear wheels 101 can be extended.<br><br>
Further, miniaturization of the joint case 31 for joining the front body 25 and the rear body 43 is less restricted, and accordingly, it is possible to lessen restriction in miniaturizing the whole body, and further, miniaturization of the body is realized to enable making the body light.<br>
Further, the present invention is characterized in that the cable for locking rear wheels 101 is constituted by the first cable, and the cable for roll lock 31 is constituted by the second cable separately from the first cable.<br>
The first cable and the second cable can be constructed simply as compared with prior art. For example, if general cables are used as the first cable and the second cable, respectively, parts costs of the parking lock device can be considerably reduced.<br>
Further, by making the construction of the first cable and the second cable simple, the maintenance such as mounting and dismounting or replacement of the cables can be carried out easily, and the maintenance costs of the cables and the parking lock device can be lowered.<br>
As long as the position of the cable mounting brackets 102, 103 for securing the cable 101 for locking rear wheels is on the body frame 11 and on the power unit 37 shown in Fig. 6, the position is not limited to that shown in Fig. 6, but may be set suitably in a range not impairing the durability of the cable for locking rear wheels 101 according to the size of the relative roll angle between the front body 25 and the<br><br>
rear body 43, the shape of the body frame 11 or the shape of the power unit 37.<br>
Further, the three-wheeled vehicle according to the present invention is not limited to a vehicle of one front wheel and two rear wheels, but may be a wheel of two front wheels and one rear wheel.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
In the parking lock device for a three-wheeled vehicle according to claim 1, the parking lever for drawing a cable is provided on the front body, the rear wheel lock mechanism for locking rear wheels is provided on the rear body, the roll lock mechanism for locking the relative rotation between a shaft and a bearing is provided in a joining between a shaft arid a bearing, the front half of a cable is extended over between the parking lever and the rear wheel lock mechanism, and the rear half part of a cable is extended over between the rear wheel lock mechanism and the roll lock mechanism. Since the front half part of the cable is extended over between the front body and the rear body, the torsion of the cable caused by the relative roll between the front body and the rear body can be absorbed at the long distance as compared with prior art.<br>
Thereby, there can be provided the construction in which excessive load is not applied to the cable, and there is less restricted with respect to miniaturization of the joining part between the front body and the rear body, and accordingly, restriction can be reduced in realizing miniaturization of the<br><br>
body, and further, the body is miniaturized to enable making the body light.<br>
In the parking lock device for a three - wheeled vehicle according to claim 2, the front half part of the cable is constituted by the first cable, and the rear half part of the cable is constituted by the second cable separately from the first cable. Therefore, the first cable and the second cable can be formed from a simple construction as compared with prior art. For example, if general cables are used, parts costs for the packing lock device can be reduced considerably.<br>
Furthermore, by making the construction of the cables simple, the maintenance such as mounting and dismounting or replacement of the cables can be carried out easily, and the maintenance costs of the parking lock device can be lowered.<br>
