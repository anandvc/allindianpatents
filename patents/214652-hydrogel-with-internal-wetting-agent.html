				<td>HYDROGEL WITH INTERNAL WETTING AGENT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to hydrophobic polymers. More particularly, it relates<br>
to hydrophobic polymers which, when prepared with an internal wetting agent, are<br>
suitable for use in biomedical devices such as ophthalmic lenses.<br>
The suitability of a material for use in biomedical devices depends on a<br>
number of factors that often include the wettability of the material and its proclivity<br>
for adhesion or reaction with biological materials such as proteins and lipids. In<br>
ophthalmic applications such as contact lenses and intraocular implants, oxygen<br>
permeability is also an important consideration. High oxygen permeability is<br>
generally desirable as is good wettability and resistance to adhesion or reaction with<br>
biomaterials.<br>
Silicone hydrogels can be a particularly desirable material for making<br>
biomedical devices such as contact lenses because of their generally high oxygen<br>
permeability. However, their hydrophobic nature make the devices made from them<br>
difficult to wet. One approach for dealing with this problem is to coat the hydrogels<br>
with a more hydrophilic coating. This adds an additional level of complexity to their<br>
manufacture. Additionally, coating material selection can be difficult as can the<br>
determination of proper coating thickness, coating uniformity and other factors that<br>
can affect physiological performance.<br>
US Patent 5,219,965 and its progeny propose modifying the surface<br>
properties of polymeric objects such as contact lenses by the inclusion of macromers<br>
having a hydrophobic portion, a hydrophilic portion, a chain transfer agent, and an<br>
unsaturated end group in the monomer mix used to make the objects. The<br>
macromers can include poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone having molecular weights of 500-<br>
10,000 with 1,000-5,000 being most preferred. The macromers are polymerized into<br>
the hydrogel and do improve wettability of the polymers. However, the<br>
improvement is generally not to such a degree that lenses can be made from the<br>
hydrogels without the need for a hydrophilic coating. In any event, enhancing the<br>
wettability of biomedical devices such as contact lenses without the need for lens<br>
coating would be considered a significant advance in the art.<br><br>
US Patents 4,045,547 and 4,042,552 propose the polymerization of large<br>
amounts (14.25-35% wt) of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into apoly(hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate) (HEMA) based contact lens formulation. The polymerizations are<br>
conducted without regard for the presence of water. No mention is made of the<br>
molecular weight of the PVP.<br>
US Patents 4,833,196; 4,791,175; and 4,678,838 are directed to the<br>
incorporation of poly-N-vinyl lactams into polymers used to make contact lenses.<br>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is the preferred polylactam. Low molecular weight<br>
(~40,000 daltons) PVP is covalently bonded with the monomers used to form the<br>
lens by first hydroperoxidizing the PVP by reaction with ozone and then<br>
polymerizing the PVP with the other monomers.<br>
US Patent 5,198,477 employs low molecular weight (~25,000 daltons) PVP<br>
within an interpenetrating polymer network formed principally from macrocycles<br>
made from vinyl containing monomers. The PVP appears to be crosslinked into the<br>
interpenetrating network.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is a wettable silicone hydrogel made by including a high<br>
molecular weight hydrophilic polymer into the silicone hydrogel monomer mix.<br>
The hydrophilic polymer is entrapped in the hydrogel with little or no covalent<br>
bonding between it and the hydrogel matrix.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the high molecular weight hydrophilic<br>
polymer is entrapped in the silicone hydrdogel matrix.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the high molecular weight hydrophilic<br>
polymer is a polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, high molecular weight hydrophilic<br>
polymer has a molecular weight (Mw) of 100,000 to 500,000 daltons; preferably, the<br>
molecular weight is at least about 300,000 daltons.<br>
In yet a further aspect of the invention, ophthalmic lenses are made from the<br>
silicone hydrogels of this invention.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The term "monomer" used herein refers to low molecular weight compounds<br>
(i.e. typically having number average molecular weights less than 700) that can be<br>
polymerized, and to medium to high molecular weight compounds or polymers,<br>
sometimes referred to as macromonomers, (i.e. typically having number average<br>
molecular weights greater than 700) containing functional groups capable of further<br>
polymerization. Thus, it is understood that the terms "silicone-containing<br>
monomers" and "hydrophilic monomers" include monomers, macromonomers and<br>
-prepolymers. Prepolymers are partially polymerized monomers or monomers which<br>
are capable of further polymerization.<br>
A "silicone-containing monomer" is one that contains at least two [-Si-O-]<br>
repeating units, in a monomer, macromer or prepolymer. Preferably, the total Si and<br>
attached O are present in the silicone-containing monomer in an amount greater than<br>
20 weight percent, and more preferably greater than 30 weight percent of the total<br>
molecular weight of the silicone-containing monomer. The preferred silicone-<br>
containing monomers of this invention have the following structure:<br><br>
wherein R51 is H or CH3, q is 1 or 2 and for each q, R52, R53 and R54 are<br>
independently ethyl, methyl, benzyl, phenyl or a monovalent siloxane chain<br>
comprising from 1 to 100 repeating Si-0 units, p is 1 to 10, r = (3-q), X is O or NR55,<br>
where R55 is H or a monovalent alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbons, a is 0 or 1, and L is<br>
a divalent linking group which preferably comprises from 2 to 5 carbons, which may<br>
also optionally comprise ether or hydroxyl groups, for example, a polyethylene<br>
glycol chain.<br><br>
Examples of the silicone-containing monomers of Structure I that can be<br>
used to form silicone hydrogels of this invention are<br>
methacryloxypropylbis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane,<br>
methacryloxypropylpentamethyldisiloxane, (3-methacryloxy-2-hydroxypropyloxy)<br>
propylbis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilane. Preferred silicone-containing monomers are<br>
monomethacryloxyalkyl terminated polydimethylsiloxanes ("mPDMS") such as<br>
those shown in structure II.<br><br>
where b = 0 to 100, and R57 is any C1-1O aliphatic or aromatic group which may<br>
include hetero atoms; provided that R57 is not functionalized at the point at which it<br>
is bonded to Si. C3-8 alkyl groups are preferred with butyl groups, particularly sec-<br>
butyl groups, being most preferred. R56 is an ethylenically unsaturated<br>
moiety;prefereably a single polymerizable vinyl group. More preferably it is a<br>
methacryl moiety but it can also be an acryl or styrenic moiety or other similar<br>
moiety.<br>
It is preferred that additional silicone-containing monomers are combined<br>
with the silicone-containing monomers of Stucture I to form the soft contact lenses<br>
of the invention. Methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (TRIS), amide<br>
analogs of TRIS described in US 4,711,943, and the vinylcarbamate or carbonate<br>
analogs described in US 5,070,21 S are also suitable for use in this regard. Indeed,<br>
any known silicone-containing monomer useful for making silicone hydrogels can<br>
be used in combination with the silicone-containing monomer of Strucure I to form<br><br>
the soft contact lenses of this invention. Many silicone-containing monomers useful<br>
for this purpose are disclosed in US patent application Serial No. 08/948,128 filed<br>
October 9,1997, incorporated herein by reference. Some examples of other<br>
monomers that can be combined with the silicone-containing monomers of Structure<br>
I to form the silicone hydrogels of this invention are the hyfroxyalkylamine-<br>
functional silicone-containing monomers disclosed in U.S. Serial Number<br>
09/033,348 titled Silicone Hydrogel Polymers by Vanderlaan et al. filed March 2,<br>
1998, and incorporated herein by reference. Linear or branched hydroxyalkylamine-<br>
functional monomers comprising a block or random monomer of the following<br>
structures can be used:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
n is 0 to 500 and m is 0 to 500 and (n + m) = 10 to 500 and more preferably 20 to<br>
250;<br>
R2, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are independently a monovalent alkyl, or aryl group, which<br>
may be further substituted with alcohol, ester, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or<br>
ether groups, preferably unsubstituted monovalent alkyl or aryl groups; and R1, R3<br>
and R8 are independently a monovalent alkyl, or aryl group, which may be further<br>
substituted with an alcohol, ester, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether group,<br>
preferably unsubstituted monovalent alkyl or aryl groups, or are the following<br>
nitrogen-containing structure:<br><br><br>
Structure IV<br>
with the proviso that at least one of R1, R3, and R8 are according to Structure IV,<br>
wherein R9 is a divalent alkyl group such as -(CH2)s- where s is from 1 to 10,<br>
preferably 3 to 6 and most preferably 3;<br>
R10 and R11 are independently H, a monovalent alkyl or aryl group which may be<br>
further substituted with an alcohol, ester, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether<br>
group, or has the following structure:<br><br>
Structure V<br>
where R14, is H, or a monovalent polymerizable group comprising acryloyl,<br>
methacryloyl, styryl, vinyl, allyl or N-vinyl lactam, preferably H or methacryloyl;<br>
R16 is either H, a monovalent alkyl or aryl group which can be further substituted<br>
with alcohol, ester, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, or a<br>
polymerizable group comprising acrylate, methacrylate, styryl, vinyl, allyl or N-<br>
vinyl lactam, preferably alkyl substituted with an alcohol or methacrylate; R12, R13<br>
and R15 are independently H, a monovalent alkyl or aryl, which can be further<br>
substituted with alcohol, ester, amine, ketone, carboxylic acid or ether groups, or R12<br>
and R15, or R15 and R13 can be bonded together to form a ring structure, with the<br>
proviso that at least some of the Structure IV groups on the monomer comprises<br>
polymerizable groups. R12, R13 and R15 arepreferably H.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the silicone hydrogels of this invention may also<br>
comprise hydrophilic monomers. The hydrophilic monomers optionally used to<br>
make the hydrogel polymer of this invention can be any of the known hydrophilic<br>
monomers disclosed in the prior art to make hydrogels. Preferred hydrophilic<br>
monomers used in such embodiments are either acrylic- or vinyl-containing. Such<br>
hydrophilic monomers may themselves be used as crosslinking agents. The term<br>
"vinyl-type" or "vinyl-containing" monomers refer to monomers containing the<br>
vinyl grouping (-CH=NH2) and are generally highly reactive. Such hydrophilic<br><br>
vinyl-containing monomers are known to polymerize relatively easily. "Acrylic-<br>
type" or "acrylic-containing" monomers are those monomers containing the acrylic<br>
group:<br>
(CH2=CRCOX) wherein R is H or CH3, and X is O or N, which are also known to<br>
polymerize readily, such as N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide,<br>
polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid.<br>
Hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers which may be incorporated into the<br>
silicone hydrogels of the present invention include monomers such as N-vinyl<br>
lactams (e.g. N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP), N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-<br>
ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl formamide, N-vinyl formamide), with NVP being<br>
preferred.<br>
Other hydrophilic monomers that can be employed in the invention include<br>
polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl groups<br>
replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizable double bond. Examples<br>
include polyethylene glycol, ethoxylated alkyl glucoside, and ethoxylated bisphenol<br>
A reacted with one or more molar equivalents of an end-capping group such as<br>
isocyanatoethyl methacrylate ("IEM"), methacrylic anhydride, methacryloyl<br>
chloride, vinylbenzoyl chloride, or the like, to produce a polyethylene polyol having<br>
one or more terminal polymerizable olefinic groups bonded to the polyethylene<br>
polyol through linking moieties such as carbamate or ester groups.<br>
Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate<br>
monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,070,215, the hydrophilic oxazolone<br>
monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,277, and polydextran. Other suitable<br>
hydrophilic monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
More preferred hydrophilic monomers which may be incorporated into the<br>
polymer of the present invention include hydrophilic monomers such as N,N-<br>
dimethyl acrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol<br>
methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP),<br>
polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid with DMA<br>
being the most preferred.<br><br>
Other monomers that can be present in the reaction mixture used to form the<br>
silicone hydrogel of this invention include ultra-violet absorbing monomers, reactive<br>
tints and the like. Additional processing aids such as release agents or wetting<br>
agents can also be added to the reaction mixture.<br>
The polymer mix used to form me lenses of this invention include one or<br>
more high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers in addition to the hydrophilic<br>
monomers identified above. The hydrophilic polymers, act as internal wetting<br>
agents. That is, they imbue the hydrogels into which they are incorporated with<br>
greatly improved wettability. Preferentially, this occurs to an extent such that<br>
hydrophobic hydrogels that would ordinarily require a hydrophobic coating for good<br>
physiological compatibility can be fashioned without a coating and yet still have<br>
good physiological compatibility with, for example, the surface of the eye.<br>
However, a hydrophilic coating such as polyacrylic acid may still be applied to the<br>
surface of the hydrogel if desired. When this is done, the hydrogel incorporating the<br>
wetting agent in it improves the physiological compatibility of the hydrogel (relative<br>
to a coated lens without the instant wetting agent) by reducing contact between<br>
tissue and hydrophobic domains within the hydrogel.<br>
The hydrophilic polymers useful as internal wetting agents are polyamides,<br>
polylactams, polyimides and polylactones. Preferably, they are hydrogen bond<br>
receivers which in aqueous environments, hydrogen bond to water, thus becoming<br>
effectively more hydrophilic. In any event, incorporation of the hydrophilic<br>
polymer in the hydrophobic hydrogel matrix without the presence of water facilitates<br>
compatibility with hydrophobic polymers such as silicones. Upon subsequent<br>
contact with water (i.e., hydration) they render the silicones wettable.<br>
Preferably these hydrophilic polymeric wetting agents are linear polymers<br>
having a cyclic moiety incorporated into the polymer backbone. This cyclic moiety<br>
is even more preferably a cyclic amide or imide cyclic moiety. This class of<br>
polymers preferably includes for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
polyvinylimidazole but polymers such as polydimethylacrylamide are also useful in<br>
this capacity. Polyvinylpyrrolidone is the most preferred hydrophilic polymeric<br>
wetting agent.<br><br>
Hydrophilic polymers useful as wetting agents in this invention have high<br>
average molecular weights (Mw"s of no less than 50,000 daltons and preferably<br>
100,000 to 500,000 daltons). More preferred molecular weight ranges are 300,000<br>
to 400,000 with a range of 320,000 to 370,000 being most preferred. Molecular<br>
weights of hydrophilic polymers can also be expressed by the so-called K-value,<br>
based on kinematic viscosity measurements, as described in N-Vinyl Amide<br>
Polymers by E.S. Barabas in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering,<br>
Second edition, Vol. 17, pp 198-257, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.. Expressed in this<br>
manner, hydrophilic polymers with K-values of 46 to 100 are preferred. Hydrophilic<br>
polymers are employed in amounts such that about l-15%wt of the wetting agent<br>
(e.g., PVP) is present in the final hydrogel formulation. Preferably, 3-8% will be<br>
present in the final hydrogel formulation. Such polymers, when prepared as part of<br>
the hydrogel matrix in the manner described herein, are incorporated into the<br>
hydrogel formulation of this invention without significant covalent bonding to the<br>
hydrogel. The absence of significant covalent bonding means that while a minor<br>
degree of covalent bonding may be present, it is incidental to the retention of the<br>
wetting agent in the hydrogel matrix. Whatever incidental covalent bonding may be<br>
present, it would not by itself be sufficient to retain the wetting agent in the hydrogel<br>
matrix. Instead, the vastly predominating effect keeping the wetting agent<br>
associated with the hydrogel is entrapment. The polymer is "entrapped", according<br>
to this specification, when it is physically retained within a hydrogel matrix. This is<br>
done via entanglement of the polymer chain of the wetting agent within the hydrogel<br>
polymer matrix. However, van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions,<br>
electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding can also contribute to this entrapment<br>
to a lesser extent.<br>
The hydrogels of this invention are best made by the preparation of a<br>
macromer and polymerization of this macromer with other components of a<br>
monomer mix. "Macromer", as the term is used in this specification, refers to a<br>
prepolymer formed by Group Transfer Polymerization (GTP) of one or more<br>
siloxanes with one or more acrylic or methacrylic materials. The methacrylates or<br>
acrylates useful in this capacity are capable of contributing hydroxyl moieties to the<br><br>
overall macromer formulation. Thus, methyl methacrylate, while beneficial to the<br>
overall formulation of macromer is not, as the sole (meth)acrylate component, itself<br>
sufficient to form the macromer of this invention. However, its presence together<br>
with a hydroxy methacrylate would be sufficient as the (meth)acrylate components).<br>
The preferred macromers of this invention are the GTP reaction products of hydroxy<br>
methacrylates or acrylates, trimethylsiloxanes, and polydimethylsiloxanes. More<br>
preferably, the macromer is the GTP reaction product of 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate (HEMA), methyl methacrylate (MMA),<br>
methacryloxypropyltris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (TRIS), and mono-<br>
methacryloxypropyl terminated mono-butyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane<br>
(mPDMS). Most preferably, 18-21 (even more preferably about 19.1) moles HEMA<br>
is combined with about 2-3 (even more preferably about 2.8) moles MMA, about 7-<br>
9 (even more preferably about 7.9) moles TRIS, and 2.5-4.5 (even more preferably<br>
about 3.3 moles) mPDMS. The GTP formation of macromer is completed by<br>
reacting the aforementioned combination of materials with 2.0 moles per mole of 3-<br>
isopropenyl-a,a-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate using dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst.<br>
This reaction is typically conducted at about 60-120°C for about 2-10 hours.<br>
The hydrogel is prepared by reacting the following reaction mixture<br>
(sometimes referred to as the "monomer mix"): macromer; silicone containing<br>
monomers, optional hydrophilic polymers (other than the wetting agent)<br>
crosslinking agents, and high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer (wetting agent).<br>
The monomer mix is reacted in the absence of water and in the optional presence of<br>
an organic diluent. The hydrogel is completed by hydration of the reaction product<br>
of this reaction mixture. Preferably, the siloxanes comprise Si7-9 monomethacryloxy<br>
terminated polydimethyl siloxane and trimethylsiloxy silanes. More preferably, the<br>
monomer mix is comprised of macromer, Si7.9 monomethacryloxy terminated<br>
polydimethyl siloxane; methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethylsiloxy) silane, "TRIS";<br>
dimethyl amide, "DMA"; hydroxyethyl methacrylic acid, "HEMA";<br>
triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, "TEGDMA", polyvinylpyrrolidone, "PVP";<br>
additives and photoinitiators.<br><br>
The preferred range of the combined silicone-containing monomers is from<br>
about 5 to 100 weight percent, more preferably about 10 to 90 weight percent, and<br>
most preferably about 15 to 80 weight percent of the reactive components in the<br>
reaction mixture (monomer mix plus macromer). The preferred range of optional<br>
hydrophilic monomer if present in the above invention is from about 5 to 80 weight<br>
percent, more preferably about 10 to 60 weight percent, and most preferably about<br>
20 to 50 weight percent of the reactive components in the reaction mixture. The<br>
preferred range of high molecular weight hydrophilic polymer (wetting agent) is 1 to<br>
15 weight percent, more preferably 3 to 10 weight percent, and most preferably 5 to 8<br>
weight percent. The preferred range of diluent is from about 0 to 70 weight percent,<br>
more preferably about 0 to 50 weight percent, and most preferably about 0 to 20<br>
weight percent of the total reaction mixture. The amount of diluent required varies<br>
depending on the nature and relative amounts of the reactive components.<br>
Most preferably, the reaction mixture comprises the most preferred<br>
macromer (described above); Si7-9 rnonomethacryloxy terminated polydimethyl<br>
siloxane (~28%wt); methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethyl siloxy) silane, "TRIS"<br>
(~14%wt); dimethyl amide, "DMA" (~26%wt); hydroxy ethyl methacrylic acid,<br>
"HEMA" (-5%); triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate, "TEGDMA" (-1%),<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, "PVP" (~5%); with the balance comprising minor amounts of<br>
additives and photoinitiators The polymerization is most preferably conducted in the<br>
presence of 20% (weight % of the complete monomer and diluent blend) dimethyl-<br>
3-octanol diluent.<br>
A polymerization catalyst is preferably included in the reaction mixture. The<br>
polymerization catalyst can be a compound such as lauroyl peroxide, benzoyl<br>
peroxide, isopropyl percarbonate, azobisisobutyronitrile, or the like, that generates<br>
free radicals at moderately elevated temperatures, or the polymerization catalyst can<br>
be a photoinitiator system such as an aromatic alpha-hydroxy ketone or a tertiary<br>
amine plus a diketone. Illustrative examples of photoinitiator systems are 1-<br>
hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-propan-l-one,<br>
bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO), and<br>
a combination of camphorquinone and ethyl 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzoate. The<br><br>
catalyst is used in the reaction mixture in catalytically effective amounts, e.g., from<br>
about 0.1 to about 2 parts by weight per 100 parts of reactive monomer.<br>
Polymerization of the reaction mixture can be initiated using the appropriate choice<br>
of heat or visible or ultraviolet light or other means depending on the polymerization<br>
initiator used. Alternatively, initiation can be conducted without a photoinitiator<br>
using, for example, low voltage e-beam. However, when a photoinitiator is used, the<br>
preferred initiator is a combination of 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone and<br>
bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4-4-trimethylpentyl phosphine oxide (DMBAPO) , and<br>
the preferred method of polymerization initiation is visible light.<br>
Typically after curing the reaction mixture, the resulting polymer is treated<br>
with a solvent to remove the diluent (if used) or any traces of unreacted components,,<br>
and hydrate the polymer to form the hydrogel. The solvent used may be water (or an<br>
aqueous solution such as physiological saline), or depending on the solubility<br>
characteristics of the diluent (if used) used to make the hydrogel of this invention<br>
and the solubility characteristics of any residual unpolymerized monomers, the<br>
solvent initially used can be an organic liquid such as ethanol, methanol,<br>
isopropanol, mixtures thereof, or the like, or a mixture of one or more such organic<br>
liquids with water, followed by extraction with pure water (or physiological saline)<br>
to produce the silicone hydrogel comprising a polymer of said monomers swollen<br>
with water. The silicone hydrogels after hydration of the polymers preferably<br>
comprise 10 to 55 weight percent water, more preferably 20 to 50 weight percent<br>
water, and most preferably 25 to 45 weight percent water of the total weight of the<br>
silicone hydrogel. These silicone hydrogels are particularly suited for making<br>
contact lenses or intraocular lenses, preferably soft contact lenses.<br>
Various processes are known for molding the reaction mixture in the<br>
production of contact lenses, including spincasting and static casting. Spincasting<br>
methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,660,545, and static casting<br>
methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,113,224 and 4,197,266. The preferred<br>
method for producing contact lenses comprising the polymer of this invention is by<br>
the direct molding of the silicone hydrogels, which is economical, and enables<br>
precise control over the final shape of the hydrated lens. For this method, the<br><br>
reaction mixture is placed in a mold having the shape of the final desired silicone<br>
hydrogel, to thereby produce a polymer in the approximate shape of the final desired<br>
product. Then, this polymer mixture is optionally treated with a solvent and then<br>
water, producing a silicone hydrogel having a final size and shape that are quite<br>
similar to the size and shape of the original molded polymer article. This method<br>
can be used to form contact lenses and is further described in U.S. Patents<br>
4,495,313; 4,680,336; 4,889,664; and 5,039,459, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
After producing the silicone hydrogel, the lens may be coated with a hydrophilic<br>
coating if desired. Some methods of adding hydrophilic coatings to a lens have been<br>
disclosed in the prior art, including U.S. Patents 3,854,982, 3,916,033, 4,920,184<br>
and 5,002,794; WO 91/04283, and EPO 93810399.<br>
The reaction mixtures of the present invention can be formed by any of the<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art, such as shaking or stirring, and used to<br>
form polymeric articles or devices by the methods described earlier. For some<br>
monomer reaction mixtures it is preferred to polymerize the reaction mixtures at<br>
temperatures slightly above room temperature, such as 30-40°C, or even as high as<br>
80°C, or below room temperature, such as 0-10°C, so as to prevent phase separation<br>
of the components.<br>
Silicone hydrogels of the instant invention have high oxygen permeability.<br>
They have O2 Dk values between 40 and 300 barrer determined by the polarographic<br>
method. Polarographic method measurements of oxygen permeability are made as<br>
follows. Lenses are positioned on the sensor then covered on the upper side with a<br>
mesh support. The oxygen that diffuses through the lens is measured using a<br>
polarographic oxygen sensor consisting of a 4 mm diameter gold cathode and a<br>
silver ring anode. The reference values are those measured on commercially<br>
available contact lenses using this method. Balafilcon A lenses available from<br>
Bausch &amp; Lomb give a measurement of approx. 79 barrer. Etafilcon lenses give a<br>
measurement of 20 to 25 barrer.<br>

Example 1 Macromer Formation<br>
To a solution of 13.75 ml of a 1M solution of TBACB in THF, 30.0g<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, 61.39 g p-xylene, 154.28 g methyl methacrylate,<br>
and 1892.13 g 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate in 4399.78 g THF at 14°C,<br>
under a N2 atmosphere, was added 191.75 g of 1-trimethylsiloxy-l-methoxy-2-<br>
methylpropene. 30 ml of additional TBACB in THF (0.40 M) was added over a<br>
period of 260 minutes, during which time the reaction mixture was allowed to<br>
exotherm, and then cooled to 30°C. Sixty minutes after addition of 2-<br>
(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate, a solution of 467.56 g 2-(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl<br>
methacrylate, 3636.6 g mPDMS and 3673.84 g TRIS and 20.0 g<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane was added, and the mixture was allowed to<br>
exotherm and then cooled to 30°C for 2 hours. A solution of 10.0g<br>
bis(dimethylamino)methylsilane, 154.26 g methyl methacrylate, and 1892.13 g 2-<br>
(trimethylsiloxy)ethyl methacrylate was then added and the mixture was again<br>
allowed to exotherm. After 2 hours, 2 gallons of anhydrous THF was added,<br><br>
followed by a solution of 439.69 g water, 740.6 g methanol and 8.8 g dichloroacetic<br>
acid after the solution was allowed to cool down to 34°C. The mixture was refluxed<br>
for 4.5 hours, heating with an oil bath at l10°C, and volatiles were distilled off at<br>
135°C, with addition of toluene to aid in removal of water, until a vapor temperature<br>
of 110°C is reached.<br>
The reaction flask was cooled to 110°C, and a solution of 443 g TMI and 5.7<br>
g dibutyltin dilaurate was added. The mixture was reacted for 3.5 hours, then cooled<br>
to 30°C. The toluene was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield off-white,<br>
anhydrous, waxy, reactive macromer. The theoretical OH content of the macromer<br>
is 1.69 mmol/g.<br>
Examples 2-14<br>
Contact lenses were made from blends of the macromer from Example 1, and<br>
other components as indicated in Table 1, curing under visible light at 75°C. (All<br>
component amounts are given as weight % of reactive components, except diluent,<br>
which is given as weight percent of the final monomer-diluent blend). The PVP that<br>
was used is sold as "POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONE (PVP K90)" by ICN<br>
Biomedicals, Inc. After curing, the molds were opened, and the lenses were released<br>
into a 1:1 blend of water and ethanol, then leached in ethanol to remove any residual<br>
monomers and diluent. Finally the lenses were equilibrated in physiological borate-<br>
buffered saline.<br><br><br><br>
Example 15 Wettability<br>
Lenses were made from a blend of 8% (by weight) PVP (K90 from ICN<br>
Biomedicals, Inc.), 20% macromer from Example 1,28.5% mPDMS, 8.0% TRIS,<br>
5.0% HEMA, 26% DMA, 1.5% TEGDMA, 2.0% Norbloc and 1.0% CGI 1850, in a<br>
blend with 37.5% (based on total monomer/diluent blend) 3M3P as diluent,<br>
following the procedure of example 2. The lenses were worn in a clinical study and<br>
found to be wettable and comfortable. The above lenses (n =10 eyes) were<br>
compared to an ACUVUE+ (n=12 eyes) historical control and found to be 100%<br>
wettable (no non-wetting spots seen while worn); similar with respect to pre-lens<br>
tear film noninvasive tear break-up time (PLTF-NIBUT) 7.1 ± 2.7 vs. ACUVUE®<br>
12.7 ± 4.7; and comfortable on a 50-point scale 44.3 ± 4.5 vs. ACUVUE® 46.8 ±2.8.<br>
Example 16 (Comparative)- Extraction of K-value 29-32 PVP<br>
Contact lenses were made following the procedure of Example 2, from a<br>
blend of 20% (weight) 40,000 Mw PVP (from Sigma Chemicals, ave. mol. wgt.<br>
10,000, K value (intrinsic viscosity) 29-32), 12% macromer from Example 1,20%<br>
TRIS, 39% HEMA, 5% DMA, 3% TEGDMA, and 1% DAROCUR 1173, in a blend<br>
with 50% (based on total monomer/diluent blend) hexanol as diluent, except that<br>
lenses were removed from the molds without initial extraction. Each lens was<br>
weighed and extracted in 5.0 ml of water or methanol, analyzing the extracts as a<br>
function of time. The results, in Table 2, illustrate that relatively low molecular<br>
weight PVP diffuses out of the polymer matrix in methanol. Approximately all of<br>
the PVP was gone after two hours. In water however, the PVP was not completely<br>
lost from the lens matrix. The diffusion reached a plateau after 24 hours, where no<br>
further release of PVP was observed.<br>
Lenses that were leached in methanol were placed into borate buffered saline.<br>
The dynamic contact angles of these lens with borate buffered saline were 104°<br>
advancing, and 41° receding, also illustrating that this relatively low molecular<br>
weight PVP is not sufficiently retained in the polymer matrix to survive alcohol<br>
extraction.<br><br><br>
 Example 17 - Extraction of K-valne 80-100 PVP<br>
Contact lenses were made following the procedure of Example 2, from a<br>
blend of 8% (weight) 360,000 Mw PVP (from Sigma Chemicals, ave. mol. wgt.<br>
360,000, K value (intrinsic viscosity) 80-100), 20% macromer from Example 1, 35%<br>
mPDMS, 5% HEMA, 26% DMA, 2% TEGDMA, 2% Norbloc and 2% CGI 1850,<br>
 in a blend with 35% (based on total monomer/diluent blend) 3M3P as diluent,<br>
except that lenses were removed from the molds without initial extraction. Each<br>
lens was weighed and extracted in 10.0 ml of water or IP A, analyzing the extracts as<br>
a function of time. The results, in Table 3, illustrate that this higher molecular<br>
weight PVP is mostly retained in the lens, even after extraction with aggressive<br>
 organic solvents.<br><br><br>
Example 17. Dust Adhesion Assay. Ease of Processabilitv<br>
Lenses were made from a blend of 5% (weight) PVP (from Sigma<br>
Chemicals, ave. mol. wgt. 360,000, K value (intrinsic viscosity) 80-100), 18%<br>
macromer from Example 1,28% mPDMS, 14% TRIS, 5% HEMA, 26% DMA, 1%<br>
TEGDMA, 2% Norbloc and 1% CGI 1850, in a blend with 20% (based on total<br>
monomer/diluent blend) 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol as diluent, following the procedure<br>
of example 2. One of these lenses was shaken in a dispersion of household dust in<br>
borate buffered saline, cleaned by a 10 second digital rub, and examined under a<br>
comparator. The amount of dust adhered to the surface was about 25% or less of<br>
that adhered to a similarly treated lens made without PVP. In addition it was<br>
observed that lenses made with PVP were much less sticky to other lenses and to<br>
glass and plastic surfaces, thus making them easier to handle during processing.<br><br>
