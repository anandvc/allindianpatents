				<td>A PROCESS FOR RE-TRANSMITTING SINGLE FREQUENCY SIGNALS<br>
AND A SINGLE FREQUENCY SIGNAL REPEATER<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for re-transmitting single<br>
frequency signals, of the type used in a single frequency signal repeater<br>
and comprising the steps of: [a] receiving a first radio frequency signal<br>
through a receiving antenna, the first radio frequency signal having a<br>
receiving power, [b] optionally, converting the first radio frequency signal<br>
into a process signal, [c] filtering1 the signal, [d] amplifying the signal, [e]<br>
automatically controlling the signal gain, [f] reconversion, as the case may<br>
be, of the process signal into a second radio frequency signal, [g]<br>
amplifying the power of the second radio frequency signal, [h] output<br>
filtering the second radio frequency signal, and [i] transmitting the second<br>
radio frequency signal through a transmitting antenna, where coupling<br>
takes place between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna.<br>
The invention also relates to a single frequency signal repeater, of the type<br>
comprising: [a] a receiving antenna, for receiving a first radio frequency<br>
signal, having a receiving power, [b] a base unit, for converting, optionally,<br>
the first radio frequency signal into a process signal, filtering the signal,<br>
amplifying the signal, automatically controlling the signal gain, and<br>
reconverting, as the case may be, the process signal into a second radio<br>
frequency signal, [c] a power amplifier unit, [d] an output filter, and [e] a<br>
transmitting antenna, where the transmitting antenna and the receiving<br>
antenna may undergo coupling.<br>
The present invention relates, therefore, to signal processing, and<br>
the corresponding device therefor, the repeater, to be incorporated in DVB<br>
(Digital Video Broadcasting), DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting), GSM, etc.<br>
repeaters that transmit in the same channel as they receive, whereby they<br>
operate in single frequency. This invention allows these repeaters to have<br>
high gains, so that for one same received signal level its transmitted power<br>
is increased and, consequently, its coverage area is increased. The<br>
ultimate aim of the system is to be able to cover the same area of service<br>
with a smaller number of repeaters, thereby reducing costs.<br>
The main limitation of the repeaters that operate in single frequency<br>
resides in the fact that the reception and transmission frequency of the<br>
repeater is the same, whereby a certain degree of coupling exists between<br>
the transmitting and receiving antennas, that is to say, the receiving<br>
antenna receives an echo of the transmitted signal. This can cause the<br>
repeater to oscillate. Also, said coupling distorts the signal frequency. In<br>
accordance with the state of the art, an effective way of avoiding this, or of<br>
reducing it to insignificant values, is achieved by reducing the repeater's<br>
gain. However, a consequence of this is that the area of coverage thereof is<br>
also reduced.<br>
An attempt has been made in the repeaters used so far to alleviate<br>
this problem by means of, for example, the use of reduced coupling<br>
transmitting and receiving antennas. However, this solution is expensive<br>
and not very satisfactory, since is not possible to avoid the coupling<br>
completely. By way of example, let us consider the case in which the<br>
transmitted signal is reflected from an object close to the repeater (a tree, a<br>
car, etc.). The echo caused by the reflection from said object will introduce<br>
a coupling between antennas not contemplated at the time of designing<br>
their radiation diagrams, whereby it will not be possible to avoid it.<br>
It is an object of the invention to overcome these drawbacks. This<br>
object is achieved by means of a process for re-transmitting single<br>
frequency signals of the type first mentioned above, having a cancellation<br>
step of said coupling between said transmitting antenna and said receiving<br>
antenna. That is to say, conceptually, it is not a question of avoiding the<br>
formation of the coupling or echo, which is a solution that has shown itself<br>
to be expensive and of limited results, but rather the process is capable of<br>
"knowing" the coupling that is occurring, and cancels it. Since the received<br>
signal is really the sum of two components: one component is the "true"<br>
signal it is desired to transmit, and the other component is due to the<br>
coupling, the process according to the invention eliminates the component<br>
due to the coupling of the received signal before transmitting it. This allows<br>
a number of additional advantages to be attained. Thus, for example, the<br>
process allows "a priori" unforeseen couplings to be cancelled in a simple<br>
way, such as for example, those caused by the environment.<br>
Preferably the first radio frequency signal is converted into a<br>
process signal, such as, for example, into an intermediate frequency (F1)<br>
signal, into a baseband signal, etc., but it is also possible to have the whole<br>
process carried out on the first radio frequency signal, without any<br>
conversion.<br>
An additional improvement consists of carrying out an adaptive<br>
process that permanently estimates the coupling between antennas, even<br>
while the repeater is operative. This allows the cancellation of time-variable<br>
coupling, such as may be generated by mobile elements in the<br>
environment.<br>
Preferably the cancellation step comprises a negative feedback.<br>
Since the received signal is really the sum of two components, such as has<br>
already been stated above, by means of the negative feedback, a signal<br>
equal (or very similar) to the component due to the coupling is subtracted<br>
from the received signal. Thus, the signal that is transmitted is free from the<br>
component due to the coupling.<br>
The proposed process is more agile and cheaper than the existing<br>
ones, thanks to its implementation not requiring any alteration of the<br>
radiation diagrams between antennas, but a simple filtering of the<br>
transmitted signal that is easily reconfigurable and the cost of which is low.<br>
Also the present invention proposes a single frequency signal<br>
repeater of the type first mentioned above, wherein it includes a device<br>
adapted to cancel said coupling between said transmitting antenna and<br>
said receiving antenna.<br>

Figure 1 shows a generic block diagram of a single frequency signal<br>
repeater. In accordance with this diagram, the incoming radio frequency<br>
(RF) signal SE (received by the receiving antenna), is converted into an<br>
intermediate frequency (Fl) signal, and an intermediate frequency pass<br>
band filter FFI filters other undesired signals received. Subsequently a<br>
converter converts the intermediate frequency signal back into a radio<br>
frequency signal again, in the same channel as the received radio<br>
frequency signal. Finally the signal is amplified to the required output level<br>
by means of an output power amplifier AP and is transmitted ST.<br>
A single frequency signal repeater is, substantially, a filtered<br>
amplifier, and can be modeled as shown in Figure 2. Within the<br>
corresponding signal bandwidth, the repeater acts as an amplifier AMP,<br>
followed by a delay cell, of value t. This delay is due to the intermediate<br>
frequency pass band filter FFI. The receiving and transmitting antennas are<br>
not perfectly insulated from one another, whereby coupling takes place<br>
between them, generating a feedback of the output signal in the input<br>
signal. Said coupling effect can be modeled as a feedback line of gain B, as<br>
shown in Figure 2. Additionally, this coupling line also has a delay, but this<br>
delay is much smaller than the delay t, whereby it can be ignored.<br>
The amplitude response is not flat, but rather rippled, depending on<br>
the product AB, the expression of which is:<br>
Another form of expressing the product AB is as the gain margin,<br>
which may be defined as the difference between the antenna insulation and<br>
the repeater gain:<br>
The key point in the operation of a single frequency signal repeater<br>
is the compromise between a minimum gain margin, allowing a maximum<br>
gain to be achieved, and, therefore, the maximum output power, and the<br>
maximum authorized amplitude ripple.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of an example of a conventional single<br>
frequency signal repeater. It comprises a base unit UB, a power amplifier<br>
unit AP and an output filter unit FS.<br>
The base unit UB carries out the following functions:<br>
a)conversion of a first radio frequency signal into an intermediate<br>
frequency signal;<br>
b)filtering the intermediate frequency signal;<br>
c) amplification;<br>
d) automatic gain control;<br>
e) conversion of the intermediate frequency signal into a second radio<br>
frequency signal;<br>
The power amplifier unit AP amplifies the power.<br>
The output filter FS carries out a final filtering of the signal to<br>
eliminate undesired out-of-band signals.<br>
The base unit UB consists of the following components:<br>
1. an input filter FE which eliminates the undesired signals received<br>
out-of-band;<br>
2. a first converter C0NV1 comprising, in turn, a means for converting<br>
the radio frequency channel received into an intermediate<br>
frequency, an intermediate frequency filter FFI, and the automatic<br>
gain control CAG;<br>
3. a linearity pre-corrector PRLIN, which is a circuit compensating for<br>
the intrinsically non-linear behavior of the amplifier unit;<br>
4. a second converter C0NV2 including a means for converting<br>
intermediate frequency to the radio frequency output channel and<br>
the output level control circuit;<br>
5. a synthesizer SINT generating and supplying the signal from the<br>
local oscillator to both frequency converters.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the basic differences between the already<br>
existing single frequency repeaters and the proposed invention, where the<br>
notation (s) refers to the representation of the linear systems by means of<br>
their transfer function in terms of the complex variable s. Figure 4 illustrates<br>
the basic block diagram of a conventional single frequency signal repeater,<br>
where the repeater's main chain receives an input signal SE and transmits<br>
an output signal ST. The main chain has been modeled with a response<br>
H(s), and a gain G. The coupling between antennas has also been<br>
indicated in dash line, modeled linearly by means of a response A(s). It is<br>
thus observed that the signal SE entering the repeater REP through the<br>
receiving antenna is the sum of the desired received signal S1 plus a<br>
coupling signal. In a conventional repeater, the stability of the repeater<br>
depends on the loop gain G-H(s)-A(s), and the only way to guarantee that it<br>
is stable is to reduce the gain G or to reduce the coupling A(s). Figure 5<br>
illustrates the block diagram of a repeater incorporating one embodiment of<br>
the proposed invention. It consists of a negative feedback of the transmitted<br>
signal ST that is processed by means of the adaptive filter FAD, expressed<br>
as complex variable as F(s), and subsequently it cancels the echoes, that is<br>
to say the coupling, at the repeater input. It is evident that now the<br>
repeater's stability depends on the loop gain G-H(s)-(A(s)-F(s)), whereby to<br>
guarantee it, it is sufficient to achieve F(s)=A(s), without necessity of<br>
reducing G or A(s).<br>
The proposed process is to some extent similar to the echo<br>
cancellation systems used in communications over long distance telephone<br>
lines. Nevertheless, the objectives are different. Indeed, the objective of the<br>
proposed invention is to allow a repeater having a large gain at the same<br>
time as it stays stable to be implemented and, for example in the case of a<br>
DVB signal, the dispersion with time of the transmitted signal ST is sensibly<br>
inferior to the duration of the cyclic prefix. On the other hand, in the echo<br>
cancellation system used in communications over long distance telephone<br>
lines, there is no problem of instability, and the desired objective is to<br>
eliminate from the received signal the component of transmitted signal<br>
introduced by the hybrid in the passage from 2 wires to 4 wires. Also, there<br>
are notable differences in the problems originated in the implementation of<br>
both applications.<br>
The description of the invention requires the specification of the<br>
following aspects of its implementation: A) architecture for inserting the<br>
adaptive processing in the single frequency signal repeater, B) architecture<br>
for implementing the filter for the processing of the signal, C) algorithm for<br>
estimating the filter coefficients.<br>
There is described hereinafter in detail one possible configuration of<br>
the proposed invention, implemented totally with analog technology. This is<br>
referred to hereinafter as analog configuration. Subsequently there are<br>
briefly described some digital alternatives for the implementation thereof,<br>
referred to as digital configurations that are distinguished from the analog<br>
configuration in that they implement the adaptive filter digitally, but their<br>
principles are common to the latter, whereby they should be considered to<br>
be parts of the same invention.<br>
Analog configuration<br>
The block diagram of Figure 6 describes with more detail one<br>
embodiment of a repeater according to the invention, showing in a<br>
summarized way all the repeater steps that are relevant to the invention.<br>
In the repeater of Figure 6, the coupling has been modeled linearly<br>
and the repeater has an adaptive filter FAD which estimates the value of<br>
the coupling in the frequency band occupied by the signal and cancels its<br>
contribution to the transmitted signal ST, so that the repeater behaves as if<br>
it did not exist. Preferably the proposed repeater works in intermediate<br>
frequency (FI). However other alternatives may also be used operating in<br>
baseband or in other frequencies such as is commented upon in the digital<br>
configurations section. The repeater of Figure 6 is provided, additionally,<br>
with a radio frequency filter FRF, and a radio frequency amplifier ARF at<br>
the input end of the equipment.<br>
The adaptive filter FAD takes the main chain signal after the CAG<br>
(Automatic Gain Control). This detail is important with a view to establishing<br>
the performance of the system, since in this case the variations with time of<br>
the filter coefficients are due only to the variation of the coupling between<br>
antennas, but not to variations in the repeater gain. Nevertheless, it is also<br>
possible to arrange for the adaptive filter FAD to take the signal before the<br>
CAG.<br>
The adaptive filter FAD is implemented preferably by means of an<br>
analog delay line and multipliers that weight and add the signal to the<br>
output of each of the delay cells T (Figure 7). The number of cells and<br>
multipliers depends on the compromise established between the complexity<br>
of the system and the level of cancellation of the couplings that it is desired<br>
to achieve. On the other hand, the delay introduced by each cell T should<br>
be chosen in agreement with the value of the intermediate frequency and<br>
the band width of the signal. Indeed, the implemented filter has a periodic<br>
frequency response, whereby it is necessary to introduce certain<br>
restrictions in the delay with the purpose of guaranteeing that there is<br>
freedom to cancel the coupling between antennas in the whole frequency<br>
band occupied by the signal.<br>
The filter coefficients are preferably constantly adaptively estimated<br>
while the repeater is in operation. This is because the coupling between<br>
antennas is unknown a priori, since it depends on the configuration of the<br>
main chain (antennas, filters and amplifiers used) and of the environment<br>
where the repeater is located (nearby obstacles, reflectivity and distance of<br>
the latter, etc.). Also, it is not very effective to estimate their value a priori<br>
since the environment can change with time (movement of the foliage of<br>
nearby trees, movement of cars or people, etc.).<br>
One embodiment of the proposed invention estimates the filter<br>
coefficients based on the optimization of a quadratic cost function:<br>
minimization of the signal power at point A of Figure 6. This criterion is<br>
based on the statistical property of non-correlation between the desired<br>
received signal and the signal induced in the antenna by the coupling,<br>
thanks to which it is shown that the power at point A is minimum when it<br>
has been possible to cancel said coupling. In order to guarantee correct<br>
operation of the criterion, it should be ensured that the main chain<br>
introduces a delay equal to or longer than the minimum for which the<br>
desired non-correlation is fulfilled. Optionally this non-correlation delay can<br>
be introduced in the conversion step.<br>
The minimization of the power in the point A is equivalent to a<br>
criterion of minimum mean squared error that can be optimized with very<br>
diverse adaptive algorithms. The fact that an analog implementation is used<br>
has made it advisable to limit the algorithms applied to the simplest and<br>
whose behavior is well documented in the literature. Preferably the Least<br>
Mean Square {LMS) and normalized LMS (NLMS) algorithms can be used,<br>
as well as the simplified versions thereof based on the sign function (see<br>
Ref. [2], [6], [8], [11]). Nevertheless, the algorithm used is not the object of<br>
this invention, and any algorithm the convergence and good behavior in<br>
follow-up of which is guaranteed (see other alternative algorithms in the<br>
digital configurations section) could be used.<br>
The adaptive filter FAD is faced with two basic restrictions. The first<br>
restriction is the need to guarantee a minimum delay in the main chain, as<br>
previously mentioned. This delay can be introduced in said conversion<br>
step. The second restriction resides in the fact that the coupling can cause<br>
a signal of a level substantially lower than the desired signal in the<br>
receiving antenna (otherwise the repeater would start to oscillate), whereby<br>
the signal to noise ratio (SNR) for the purpose of identification of the<br>
coupling is very low. This requires that a very slow evolution of the adaptive<br>
system coefficients be forced with the objective of compensating the loss of<br>
SNR with a time averaging of the signal.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the closed loop structure of the single frequency<br>
repeater REP, the coupling between antennas and the adaptive filter FAD.<br>
This structure causes the cancellation errors to be fed back to the system<br>
and to the transmitted signal, with the possibility of causing the system to<br>
start oscillating - it is recalled that the stability depends on the loop gain<br>
GH(s)-(A(s)-F(s)) -. To avoid this, it is advisable to contemplate<br>
mechanisms that assure that the system stays stable at all times. This<br>
drawback, which does not appear in the echo cancellation systems used in<br>
communications over long distance telephone lines, makes it advisable to<br>
establish two phases in the operation of the proposed invention: the<br>
acquisition phase FADQ and that of follow-up FSEG (Figure 8). The<br>
acquisition phase FADQ is carried out only once, during the initialization or<br>
start up of the repeater. During this phase, the repeater gain stays low<br>
(G,n/), so that it is stable independently of the cancellation level reached by<br>
the adaptive system. In it, the adaptive algorithm estimates the value of the<br>
optimal coefficients of the adaptive filter and reduces the coupling to levels<br>
below the desired one. The gain stays at low level for sufficient time to<br>
allow the convergence of the algorithm and, subsequently, is increased<br>
slowly until it reaches its regular value (Gfin). In the follow-up phase FSEG<br>
the repeater operates normally, having attained the desired gain and<br>
cancellation levels. Nevertheless, the adaptation algorithm of the adaptive<br>
filter remains in operation to detect and to follow possible variations of the<br>
frequency response of the coupling between antennas without having to<br>
reinitiate the repeater. These changes in gain in the acquisition phase are<br>
operated preferably in the intermediate frequency amplifiers AFI.<br>
The analog configuration of the invention has two basic limitations.<br>
In the first place, the limitations in complexity imposed by the very fact of<br>
being analog, either in the number of coefficients of the adaptive filter, in<br>
the type of adaptive filter or even in the adaptive algorithm used. In the<br>
second place, the technological problems attached to the implementation of<br>
the adaptive algorithm, such as for example the offset of the integrators<br>
used in LMS, although alternatives can be found that alleviate the<br>
seriousness of this problem (see [2]). Nevertheless, a preferred solution to<br>
both problems is to use, at least in part, digital technology, whereby the<br>
alternatives that the digital configuration of the proposed invention offers<br>
are described below.<br>
Digital configurations<br>
Diverse alternative digital implementations to the basic analog<br>
configuration described can be devised. They are all based on the same<br>
principles that constitute the basis of the proposed invention. However, they<br>
are distinguished from the basic configuration in that the adaptive filter<br>
operates on the digitized signal, whereby it has the degrees of freedom<br>
offered by the digital processing of the signal as well as the drawbacks that<br>
the introduction of sampling and reconstruction steps of the analog signal<br>
represent.<br>
Architecture<br>
The digital implementation of the adaptive filter requires the<br>
digitization of the signals involved in the filtering and filter coefficient<br>
estimation processes. Four alternative architectures are contemplated,<br>
according to at what point of the main chain the signals are sampled and<br>
reconstructed. These four options are shown in Figures 9-12.<br>
Figures 9, 10 and 12 correspond to different strategies for sampling<br>
the signal used in estimating the adaptive filter FAD response, while Figure<br>
11 illustrates the case in which it is opted to implement the whole Fl<br>
(intermediate frequency) step of the repeater digitally. In this case, the<br>
signal can be regenerated (demodulation and modulation), substantially<br>
improving the repeater's performance. In all cases, the signals can be<br>
sampled in baseband (called I/Q sampling), so that the analytical signal is<br>
recovered, or in the pass band signal (called Fl sampling), either in the Fl<br>
signal or transferred to another lower frequency that is more convenient<br>
from the sampling point of view. It should be borne in mind that the<br>
sampling alternatives commented upon below (generation of the analytical<br>
signal, heterodynation) are also applicable to the analog implementation<br>
described as basic configuration, although the technological complexity of<br>
the implementation thereof dissuades its use. The application of one or<br>
another sampling type to each of the A/D converters gives place to four<br>
possible configurations that differ from each other in that they work with real<br>
or complex coefficients and/or error signal. Although the four combinations<br>
lead to similar solutions and cancellation levels, all of them require a<br>
different design of the sampling frequency and of the number of coefficients<br>
of the adaptive filter, although said design is always based on the principles<br>
already expressed for the analog configuration. Generally speaking, the<br>
adaptive algorithms afford a quicker convergence in those configurations<br>
that work with complex coefficients, but this improvement is offset by a<br>
greater technological complexity of the implementation of the A/D and D/A<br>
conversion. In all cases, the election of the sampling frequency will depend<br>
on the same parameters as in the analog configuration already commented<br>
upon (value of the intermediate frequency adopted in the repeater and<br>
signal band width) as well as of the selectivity of the filters in the main<br>
chain.<br>
The A/D and D/A conversion steps are implemented in a different<br>
way according to whether I/Q or Fl sampling is elected. Figure 13 illustrates<br>
a scheme for the A/D conversion step. The antialiasing filter FAL and the<br>
local oscillator (f1) are necessary or unnecessary according to which<br>
sampling method is elected and how selective the filters of the main chain<br>
are. Figure 14 illustrates a scheme for the D/A conversion step. The<br>
reconstruction filter FRE compensates for the part of the distortion<br>
introduced by the D/A converter that has not been corrected digitally. The<br>
application or otherwise of the local oscillator (f2) depends on the sampling<br>
type and frequency used, while the pass band filter FPB is only necessary if<br>
heterodynation is applied with the local oscillator and the subsequent filters<br>
of the main chain are not sufficiently selective.<br>
Finally, in all the previous architectures it might be desirable to aid<br>
the adaptive filter with a system compensating for possible distortions or<br>
phase jitters or frequency offsets ([4]). Although the adaptive filter can in<br>
theory compensate for said distortions, in practice, above all in multicarrier<br>
systems such as is DVB, it cannot adapt itself sufficiently quickly to follow<br>
said perturbations of the carrier.<br>
Filter implementation architecture for signal processing.<br>
The filter can be implemented by means of an in-line delay<br>
architecture or by means of a lattice network. On the other hand, a finite<br>
(FIR) or infinite (IIR) impulse response filter can be used. The IIR-filters<br>
provide a better performance for same number of coefficients, but have<br>
limitations in their combination with adaptive algorithms.<br>
If the environment where the repeater is located causes very late<br>
echoes of the transmitted signal to appear in the receiving antenna (with a<br>
delay greatly in excess of the filter sampling period), is advisable to break<br>
the adaptive filter down into two blocks FAD I and FAD II (see Figure 15),<br>
one of them, FAD I, operating with the transmitted signal and the other,<br>
FAD II, with the same signal delayed by a time interval similar to the<br>
appearance time of the late echoes.<br>
The filtering process can be implemented in the time or frequency-<br>
domain. In the latter case, the use of the FFT or other filter banks with<br>
multirate structures allows the computational cost to be reduced and the<br>
convergence of the adaptive algorithm ([10], [5]) to be improved.<br>
Nevertheless, the frequency implementation of adaptive filters operating in<br>
environments where coupling between antennas is subject to variations<br>
with time limits the capacity of following said changes and, furthermore,<br>
always causes the introduction of a delay in the adaptive filter that can limit<br>
its coupling cancellation capacity.<br>
Adaptive algorithms for estimating filter coefficients.<br>
The adaptive filter coefficients can be estimated with any algorithm<br>
that guarantees convergence to the correct solution, that is to say, to the<br>
one in which the adaptive filter correctly estimates the coupling between<br>
antennas, and which, furthermore, is capable of following the variations<br>
with time thereof. From among said algorithms, the most common and<br>
studied are those which follow criteria: I) of minimum mean squared error or<br>
II) of least squares. Both criteria can be used both in delay line architecture<br>
and in lattice architecture.<br>
There is given below a non-exhaustive list of the applicable<br>
algorithms, in attention to whether they are implemented with FIR or IIR<br>
response.<br>
In the case of the FIR-filter ([3]), and taking criterion I), one<br>
possibility is to use the steepest descent family of algorithms, which,<br>
starting out from any initial value of the coefficients correct it with an<br>
increment in the opposite direction to that of the gradient which has the<br>
power surface depending on the coefficients. The gradient is calculated in<br>
an exact statistical way; for this reason, these algorithms need to have prior<br>
knowledge of the characteristics of the echoes or coupling to be cancelled<br>
and cannot properly be described as adaptive.<br>
Where the echoes or coupling are unknown, one solution is to have<br>
recourse to the family of differential steepest descent algorithms which<br>
calculate the gradient starting from differences in the error function<br>
originated by perturbations which are caused in the coefficients.<br>
Nevertheless, these algorithms converge slowly and a quicker solution is to<br>
use the stochastic gradient, that is to say, to use an instantaneous<br>
calculation of the exact expression of the gradient. Where the error function<br>
to be minimized depends linearly on the coefficients, said algorithms are<br>
included in the so-called LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm and variants<br>
such as the NLMS {Normalized LMS), the P vector algorithm or other<br>
variants that have scenarios in which that the interfering noise is not<br>
distributed in an uniform or white way in frequency, but rather do it in a<br>
colored way. Where the error function to be minimized depends non-<br>
linearly on the filter coefficients or depends recursively thereon, the<br>
stochastic gradient algorithms calculate the gradient with a small number of<br>
iterative applications of the rule of the differential calculus chain. Where the<br>
error function does not depend linearly on the coefficients, said algorithm is<br>
a non-linear extension of the LMS called the back propagation algorithm<br>
([1]). In the case to which this patent relates, the gradient of the error<br>
depending on the filter coefficients must be derived from the rule of the<br>
chain. In Figure 6 the error signal at the output of the adaptive filter is<br>
shown to be the one that, properly amplified, is transmitted by the repeater.<br>
Therefore, it is the error signal that will be coupled with the desired received<br>
signal at the input to the receiving antenna and it will become part of the<br>
error signal again. Therefore, the LMS algorithm is an approximation of the<br>
gradient that allows the calculation to be reduced regarding the rule of the<br>
chain, which is the one that should really be applied. Only if the<br>
intermediate frequency filter FFI, shown in Figure 6, introduces an<br>
appropriate delay, will the transmitted signal be incorrelated with the error<br>
signal and the LMS will make an increasingly valid approximation of the<br>
gradient.<br>
In the case of the FIR-filter, and considering criterion II), the most<br>
feasible and effective algorithm is the Kalman filter or variants thereof: RLS<br>
or Recursive Least Squares and the rapid Kalman filter.<br>
In the case of IIR-filters, implementation by means of lattice network<br>
is preferable to the delay line, since it allows the stability of the adaptive<br>
filter to be easily monitored during the convergence phase. The filter<br>
coefficients can be estimated by means of steepest descent algorithms,<br>
algorithms based on the methodology of Steiglitz-McBride or on<br>
hyperstable algorithms ([12], [7]). The first group is based on the minimum<br>
mean squared error criterion, based either on the output error or on the<br>
equation error. It is preferred to minimize the output error (e.g. using the<br>
RPE or Recursive Prediction Error algorithm [9]), since the cost function<br>
based on the equation error does not guarantee convergence to the optimal<br>
solution under conditions of a low signal to noise ratio, as is the case of the<br>
proposed invention. Among the algorithms of the third group there is the<br>
very well known SHARF or Simplified Hyperstable Adaptive Recursive<br>
Filter, having the qualities desired in an adaptive algorithm.<br>
Finally, it must be borne in mind that if it is opted to implement the<br>
whole Fl step of the repeater digitally (Figure 11), complete digital<br>
processing of the received signal can be carried out, that regenerates it by<br>
means of demodulation and subsequent modulation. In this case,<br>
advantage can be taken of the training sequences proper to the signals<br>
retransmitted, if there were any, such as for example the pilot tones of the<br>
DVB signal, which can be taken as a reference when calculating the error<br>
function that will govern any of the described algorithms. The advantage of<br>
taking the training sequences as a reference is that they allow the adaptive<br>
algorithm to work under better SNR conditions, as well as facilitating the<br>
use of different architectures for inserting the adaptive system in the single<br>
frequency signal repeater.<br>
EXAMPLE OF ANALOG EMBODIMENT<br>
Introduction<br>
There is described one example of an analog embodiment of a DVB<br>
signal repeater, which is based on a finite impulse response adaptive FIR-<br>
filter of a structure according to the one shown in Figure 7, composed of a<br>
delay line. As illustrated in Figure 7, the input signal E of the adaptive filter<br>
is injected into the delay line. Subsequently, the signals present at the<br>
output of each delay are multiplied by their respective coefficients, and<br>
finally the results of such multiplications are added to obtain the output<br>
signal S of the adaptive filter. In this embodiment, the obtaining of the value<br>
of the coefficients is based on the LMS or Least Mean Squares algorithm.<br>
Figure 16 illustrates the implementation by means of a correlation loop of<br>
the calculation of coefficients according to the LMS algorithm. Said<br>
algorithm calculates each of the coefficients according to the following<br>
expression:<br>
where the signal x(t) is the delay output signal, the signal r(t) is the signal<br>
present in the receiving antenna, ea(t) is the error signal after the<br>
cancellation, and a(t) is the ensemble of coefficients. ma is the adaptation<br>
constant, which fixes the speed of convergence of the algorithm, as well as<br>
the magnitude of the oscillation of the coefficients relative to the final<br>
solution. The elements M1 and M2 are multipliers, the element INT is the<br>
integrator and the element SUM is the adder of the signals multiplied by the<br>
respective coefficients.<br>
Approach to the embodiment<br>
The single frequency or isofrequency repeaters usually have<br>
intermediate frequency processing, which allows high selectivity filters to be<br>
used.<br>
The adaptive filter can be embodied at the same intermediate<br>
frequency as that of the repeater, or at a second lower intermediate<br>
frequency, should the possible advantages of operating at a lower<br>
frequency compensate for the increment in complexity on having to add a<br>
converter from the first to the second intermediate frequency before the<br>
adaptive filter, and another converter from the second to the first<br>
intermediate frequency, at the output from said filter. The block diagram of<br>
the implementation example in question is the one illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
Blocks used<br>
The group of basic blocks that compose the adaptive filter in its<br>
analog embodiment is as follows:<br>
Delay blocks<br>

Integrators<br>
Distributors and combiners<br>
Signal amplifiers<br>
Adder<br>
Figure 17 illustrates the block diagram of one of the cells where a<br>
signal x(t-iT) is seen to be input, a distributor DIS distributes it, on one<br>
hand, to a delay T to obtain an output x(t-(i+1)T), on the other hand, to a<br>
multiplier M2, and, again, to a multiplier M1. The multiplier M1 also receives<br>
the error signal e(t).<br>
Figure 18 illustrates a stretch of two cells, CEL1 and CEL2, of the<br>
analog embodiment of the adaptive filter.<br>

means of an operational amplifier, where E indicates the input to and S the<br>
output from the integrator.<br>

networks.<br>

resistor network is shown in Figure 20, where E also indicates the input to<br>
and S the output from the distributor.<br>

the traditional radio frequency amplifier design techniques.<br>
Adder<br>
The adder adds the signals obtained at the output of each of the<br>
multipliers M2 of the cells.<br>
EXAMPLE OF DIGITAL EMBODIMENT<br>
Introduction<br>
Figure 21 shows the block diagram of the transmitter, also for DVB<br>
signals, in which the adaptive filter is implemented digitally. In a similar way<br>
to the analog case, the RF input signal SE is converted into intermediate<br>
frequency (Fl), where a FI filter FFI rejects the possible out-of-band signals,<br>
to finally convert it again to RF. In the digital embodiment, the<br>
corresponding A/D and D/A conversions are required, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 21.<br>
The transmitter operates as follows: from the signal r[n] received by<br>
the antenna (which in fact is formed by the desired signal plus the echoes<br>
caused by the transmitting antenna) there is subtracted an estimate s[n] of<br>
the undesired signals obtained by the adaptive filter FAD, which gives an<br>
error signal e[n] that is fed through the Fl filter FFI and is reconverted to<br>
RF.<br>
The structure of the digitally embodied adaptive filter is shown in<br>
Figure 22. Essentially it is a variable coefficient FIR-filter, where these are<br>
updated periodically by the LMS algorithm.<br>
For the instant n, the LMS algorithm calculates the new coefficients<br>
as follows:<br>
h[n] = h[n -1] + m . e[n]¦ x[n]<br>
This operation, schematically illustrated in Figure 23, is carried out<br>
for each of the filter coefficients.<br>
The constant m has the function of adjusting the adaptation step.<br>
The greater its value, the quicker will be the convergence of the algorithm;<br>
in exchange, the coefficients will have a greater oscillation around the<br>
optimum solution. There is, therefore, a compromise between convergence<br>
speed and stability of the coefficients around the optimum solution.<br>
Digital embodiment<br>
In Fl we have the DVB pass band signal, with a bandwidth of<br>
7.61MHz, which is digitized by means of a 12-bit A/D conversion. The<br>
subsequent processing is based on programmable logic digital integrated<br>
circuits of the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) type.<br>
Figure 24 shows more particularly the blocks required to be able to<br>
embody the analog/digital interface.<br>
A more detailed structure of the adaptive filter is as shown in Figure<br>
25. It is seen to be formed by the following parts:<br>
Data-Framer DF: Its function is to fragment the input data x[n] (12<br>
bits) into four parts, giving 3 bits to which a control bit is added. Because<br>
four cycles will be needed to process each sample, the clock frequency of<br>
the system should be four times the sampling frequency.<br>
Table Generator TG: calculates the partial products of each<br>
coefficient and loads them in the LUT (Look-Up Table) of the corresponding<br>
tap.<br>
LMS Algorithm: This calculates the new coefficients depending on<br>
the error signal e[n] and on x[n], and supplies them to the Table Generator<br>
TG, through cdata.<br>
Tap Filter coefficients: Each Tap has assigned its own coefficient,<br>
and multiplies it by the input data.<br>
Adder tree: this is a registered adder tree that obtains the sum of all<br>
the partial results supplied by the coefficients.<br>
Each of the parts comprising the system will be shown in greater<br>
detail below. Thus, Figure 26 is the diagram of the Data-Framer DF. The 12<br>
bit data (x[n]) are fed to a register REG12 at the sampling frequency FMUE,<br>
and are output, through a control register REGC fragmented into 4 parts of<br>
4 bits each (each of these parts is known as an octet), at a frequency<br>
4xFMUE 4 times higher than the sampling frequency FMUE. The three<br>
least significant bits of each octet correspond to three bits of the input data;<br>
the most significant bit is the control bit, and is set to 1 only when the fourth<br>
and last octet of the data being processed is output. This is achieved by<br>
means of a 2-bit counter C0N2 and the three multiplexors Mux1, Mux2 and<br>
Mux3. Initially the counter C0N2 is set to 0, therefore the multiplexors<br>
Mux1, Mux2 and Mux3 select the signal at their 0 input, that is, Mux1<br>
selects bit 2, Mux2 bit 1 and Mux3 bit 0, that is to say, the three least<br>
significant bits of the sample. The control signal SCO is the most significant<br>
bit in the octet, and in this case is 0. Subsequently the counter is set to 1,<br>
and bits 5, 4 and 3 (the following three least significant bits) are selected<br>
and the control signal continues to be 0. Subsequently, when the counter is<br>
set to 2, bits 8, 7 and 6 are selected, with the control signal still being 0.<br>
Finally the counter is set to 3, bits 11,10 and 9 (the most significant in the<br>
sample) are selected, and the control signal SCO is activated. In the<br>
following iteration the counter will be reset to 0 and there will be a new<br>
sample stored in the register REG12, the cycle beginning again.<br>
Figure 28 is an illustration of the diagram corresponding to the Table<br>
Generator TG. This calculates the partial products of each coefficient<br>
according to Table 1.<br>
It could have been implemented simply with a 12*3 bit multiplier plus<br>
some minor components, but the configuration shown has been opted for,<br>
since is better as far as space occupation is concerned. The operation<br>
thereof is rather complex, although it is known to one skilled in the art,<br>
whereby only the idea will be described here: if Table 1 is observed, it will<br>
be seen that an accumulator is ideal for calculating the value of the memory<br>
positions 0h to 7h, it is only necessary to add the coefficient to the last result<br>
obtained to get the current value. The same may be said of the positions 8h<br>
to Bh and of Ch to Fh, only in the last named it is necessary to complement<br>
the coefficient. The counter is used to access the consecutive memory<br>
positions of the LUT. The function of Mux5 is to supply either 0 or the adder<br>
output to the output register. The control signal of Mux5 is the OR of the 3<br>
least significant bits of the counter. Therewith 0 is selected for the memory<br>
positions 0 and 8 (as shown in Table 1). On the other hand, the adder is fed<br>
back through its own output, thereby obtaining the results for the addresses<br>
1 to 7 and 9 to 11. The addresses 12 to 15 require negative results, to this<br>
end the two's complement of the coefficient is selected by means of Mux4.<br>
Finally, 0 is selected for the addresses 12 to 15 by means of Mux6, since<br>
from now on the results become negative.<br>
Figure 27 shows the structure for each tap comprising the filter. It<br>
consists of three clearly differentiated parts:<br>
Time Skew Buffer TSB: this is a 4x4 bit shift register, thus the TSB<br>
is able to house a complete sample (divided into 4 parts of 4 bits each). At<br>
each clock cycle it delivers an octet to the Partial Product Multiplier PPM<br>
and also to the following tap. From the TSB there is also output the<br>
First_oct signal that is only activated when the least significant octet of the<br>
four forming the sample is being output. The Time Skew Buffer TSB<br>
receives the information data1 coming from the control register REGC.<br>
Partial Product Multiplier PPM: this consists of two RAM (called<br>
LUT: Look-Up-Table) that store the partial products of the coefficient<br>
according to Table 1. At the same time as one LUT is accessed to read the<br>
partial result of the multiplication, the Table Generator TG is writing the<br>
partial products corresponding to the new coefficient that the LMS algorithm<br>
will have calculated to the other LUT, by means of the data buses and addr.<br>
The multiplexors Mux8 and Mux9 are controlled by means of the bank_sel<br>
signal and are complementary, that is to say, when one selects its 0 input,<br>
the other selects its 1 input, and vice versa. This allows the addr and data<br>
signals to be addressed to the LUT corresponding thereto. The multiplexor<br>
Mux10, also controlled by the bank_sel signal, selects the data outputted<br>
by the LUT containing the partial products of the current coefficient (it<br>
should remember that meanwhile the other LUT is being updated with the<br>
partial products of the new coefficients). By means of the two AND gates<br>
and the bank_sel and tap_sel signals both write_en signals that enable the<br>
writing to the corresponding LUT are being generated.<br>
Scaling Accumulator SCA: Its mission is to accumulate the partial<br>
results of each octet properly to obtain the complete solution of the<br>
multiplication (24 bits in all) at its output. It will be seen that it is an adder<br>
fed back by its own output, suitably escalated (the 13 most significant bits<br>
are fed back and the most significant bit is replicated three times). Mux11,<br>
which is controlled by means of the first_oct signal, allows the first octet to<br>
pass directly to the output; the other three octets forming the sample pass<br>
through the adder.<br>
Obviously all the steps and elements described above are<br>
schematic, to facilitate the understanding of the invention. Details have not<br>
been included that are evident to one skilled in the art (additional filtering<br>
steps, etc.), and which, moreover, do not affect the concept of the<br>
invention. Thus, for example, the steps of filtering the process signal, of<br>
amplification of the process signal, of automatic gain control, etc. are<br>
frequently not done at one same time, but rather they are done in diverse<br>
steps. It should be understood, therefore, that where the existence of a<br>
step, for example, of filtering, is mentioned, it should not be understood that<br>
only one filtering step exists, but rather the signal in question is filtered,<br>
independently of the number of steps in which said filtering is carried out.<br>
Also, the order indicated in the steps of the process is purely a<br>
descriptive order and does not have to coincide with the true order of the<br>
process. The only intention is to say that the process comprises said steps,<br>
that is to say, that it includes them, but it is not indicating that the sequence<br>
of performance of the steps is the one indicated. In fact, for example, the<br>
filtering, amplification and automatic gain control steps of the process signal<br>
that, as has already been indicated previously, are usually carried out in<br>
several stages, do not always follow the order indicated in the text, it is<br>
even frequent that the different stages of a step are interlaced with the<br>
stages of the other steps. Therefore, it is desirable to insist on the fact that<br>
the steps mentioned in the text and the claims only indicate the existence of<br>
said steps, without restricting the number of stages in which they are<br>
carried or the order in which they take place.<br>
