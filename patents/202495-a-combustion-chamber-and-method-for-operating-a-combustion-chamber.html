Description<br>
The invention relates to a combustion chamber having a combustion chamber wall and having an inner lining formed from a plurality of heat-shield elements and to a method of operating a combustion chamber.<br>
An annular combustion chamber for a gas turbine is described in EP 0 597 137 Bl. The combustion chamber is subdivided into a primary zone and a secondary zone. The primary zone and the secondary zone each have a flow-limit ing wall arrangement and these are cooled independently of one another by cooling air. The wall arrangement of the secondary zone has a double-walled configuration. It abuts the wall arrangement of the primary zone, which is formed by a segment support for segments of a fire-resistant lining. The cooling air initially flows through the double-walled arrangement of the secondary zone, subsequently flows through the segment support and the segments of the primary zone and is finally supplied to a burner for combustion.<br>
EP 0 576 697 Bl describes a gas turbine combustion chamber in which, in addition to classical burner types, catalytic burners are also employed simultaneously. Premixing burners are used as the classical burner types and the main combustion process is carried out by these. The combination of these burner types provides simpler control in the case of changing load conditions on the gas turbine.<br>
A gas turbine with a two-stage combustion system is described in the article "Options for Low<br><br><br>
3<br>
Emissions", by Richard J. Antos, Low N0x Gas Turbines,<br>
May 1996, page 43. A first stage of the combustion<br>
process takes place in a primary zone with the aid of a<br>
premixing burner, which is stabilized by a diffusion<br>
burner.  The combustion space for the primary	<br><br>
4<br><br>
zone is abutted by a larger combustion space for a secondary zone, in which. a second stage of the combustion process takes place. For this purpose, a premixed fuel/air mixture is supplied via a number of openings in the combustion chamber wall at the inlet to the secondary zone. The fuel/air mixture ignites in the hot exhaust gas which enters the secondary zone from the primary zone. This provides the second stage of the combustion process.<br>
Such a two-stage combustion process, in which the multistage combustion process is used to reduce the N0x emissions, is also known from US 4,910,957.<br>
An internal combustion gas turbine with an annular combustion space is known from DE-C-253 189 which has, on each of its side walls, a porous earthenware plate which acts as a so-called surface burner. For this purpose a combustion gas mixture is fed through the porous earthenware plate from its rear surface relative to the combustion space. The combustion gas mixture is ignited on the surface of the earthenware plate facing toward the combustion space and is burnt on the surface. A driving gas for driving the internal combustion gas turbine is heated by the heat radiated from the earthenware plate.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a combustion chamber which permits a supply of fuel and combustion air in a particularly simple type of construction. A further object of the invention is to provide a method of operating a combustion chamber which permits a staged combustion process in a particularly simple manner.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the object directed toward the provision of a combustion chamber is achieved by means of a combustion chamber having a<br><br>
5<br>
combustion chamber wall and having an inner lining formed from a plurality of heat-shield elements, at least one heat-shield element, functioning as a burner, being a burner/heat-shield element, upstream of which is connected a fuel supply feature for<br><br>
6<br>
fuel and a combustion air supply feature for combustion air. In such an arrangement, the burner/heat-shield element exhibits a material provided with numerous cavities, it being possible to supply the fuel and the combustion air in such a way that a combustion process can be generated within this material.<br>
Such a combustion chamber permits a combustion process in a structurally particularly simple manner by using a heat-shield element, which is a constituent part of the fire-resistant inner lining of the combustion chamber, as a burner. Fuel and combustion air are supplied to such a burner/heat-shield element for combustion in the heat-shield element.<br>
Such a burner/heat-shield element represents a so-called pore burner. Fuel and combustion air are, therefore, burnt in the cavities or pores, the material heating up in the process. This leads, on the one hand, to good stabilization of the combustion process. On the other hand, the pore structure has a strongly damping effect on combustion oscillations. These two properties of a pore burner lead to the fact that practically no combustion oscillation forms due to a combustion process in a pore burner. In addition, the material which, as already mentioned, is greatly heated during the combustion process, radiates a substantial quantity of heat. This leads to the fact that the flame temperature of the combustion process within the material is comparatively low. The result of this, in turn, is that there is less formation of oxides of nitrogen. It is, however, also possible to utilize the advantage of the lower flame temperature to supply more fuel to the burner/heat-shield element and, in consequence, to supply less fuel to the burner of a first  stage.    This  reduces  the  formation of  such<br><br>
7<br>
combustion oscillations,  which can be caused by the first stage burner.<br><br>
8<br>
A premixing space, into which the fuel and the combustion  air  can  be  introduced,  is  preferably connected upstream of the burner/heat-shield element. Fuel and combustion air are first supplied to the premixing space where a fuel/air mixture is formed. This fuel/air mixture is subsequently supplied to the burner/heat-shield element.  This provides a favorable homogeneous  fuel/air  mixture  for  the  combustion process.<br>
The combustion chamber wall has an outer surface along which a" fuel conduit", from which fuel can be released into the premixing space, preferably extends. In the case of an annular combustion chamber, for example, such a fuel conduit could be a ring main which extends around the combustion chamber wall in the peripheral direction of the annular combustion chamber and from which fuel can also, for example, be supplied in a simple manner for a plurality of burner/heat-shielcl elements which are arranged along this peripheral direction.<br>
A combustion gas flow can preferably be guided through the combustion chamber from an inlet end to an outlet end along an extension direction, at least one burner being provided for a first stage of a combustion process and it being possible for a second stage of the combustion process to be generated downstream of the first stage by means of the burner/heat-shield element.<br>
By means- of the burner/heat-shield element, a second stage of a two-stage combustion process is realized in a simple manner. Further stages of the combustion process can also, of course, be provided. Because of the two-stage or multistage nature of the combustion process, a. reaction zone of the combustion process  is  distributed over a  larger volume.    In<br><br>
9<br>
consequence, there is less tendency to form combustion oscillations in the combustion chamber. Such combustion oscillations can, under certain circumstances, cause substantial damage in the combustion chamber. In the case of a two-stage or a multistage combustion process, furthermore, particularly good controllability for adaptation to<br><br>
10<br>
different power outputs, i.e. load conditions, is provided for a gas turbine operated under different loads, for example. If a gas turbine is driven by The exhaust gas from the combustion chamber, a fuel/air ratio for the combustion process based on the load on the gas turbine is necessary. The use of at least two burners provides a further parameter range for the control of the combustion process. In addition, it is, for example, possible - if necessary - to stop the supply of fuel to the burner/heat-shield element so that only air flows through the burner/heat-shield element into the combustion chamber. Furthermore, the use of the burner/heat-shield element provides a better cooling performance for the cooling of the inner lining of the combustion chamber because a comparatively large quantity of cooling combustion air can be supplied to the burner/heat-shield element. Finally, a further advantage is that the air mass flow through the burner of the first stage can be reduced. This has, in particular, the result that the burner can be made smaller. This, for example, provides the advantage that the burner can be removed in a simpler manner from a casing surrounding it.<br>
The burner/heat-shield element extends from a first end to a second end along the extension direction, the premixing space being preferably located between the combustion chamber wall and the burner/heat-shield element and an outlet opening, which connects the premixing space to the combustion space, being provided in the region of the second end. The arrangement of the premixing space and the downstream arrangement of the outlet opening provides a 'flow connection  between  the  premixing  space  and  the<br><br>
11<br>
combustion chamber/ this connection being distinguished by a particularly low flow resistance.<br>
Cooling air can preferably be supplied to the burner/heat-shield element, it being simultaneously possible to use the cooling air<br><br>
12<br>
as combustion air. The heat-shield elements are often cooled by cooling air being fed from the outer surface of the combustion chamber wall, for example through holes on the rear surface of the heat-shield elements. The use of this cooling air supply feature as a combustion air supply feature provides a particularly simple supply of combustion air to the burner/heat-shield element.<br>
The material of the burner/heat-shield element, i.e. of the pore burner, is preferably a foamed ceramic, in particular zirconium oxide or silicon carbide. Such materials can, for example, be manufactured by introducing the ceramic into a foam-forming carrier material and, after foaming and hardening have been carried out, the carrier material is etched out so that a porous ceramic remains.<br>
The combustion chamber is preferably configured as an annular combustion chamber forming an annular space, a plurality of heat-shield elements being configured as burner/heat-shield elements along a peripheral direction of the annular space. The major part of the heat-shield elements arranged along a peripheral direction is preferably configured as burner/heat-shield elements. This provides a uniform distribution of the second stage of the combustion process around the periphery of the annular combustion chamber.<br>
The combustion chamber is preferably used in a gas turbine, particularly in a stationary gas turbine. The gas turbine preferably has a power greater than 60 MW.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the object directed toward the provision of a method is achieved by a method of operating a combustion chamber having a<br><br>
13<br>
combustion chamber wall and having an inner lining formed from a plurality of heat-shield elements, fuel and combustion air being supplied to at least one of the heat-shield elements for a combustion process, and the fuel and the combustion air being burnt within a porous structure of the heat-shield element.<br>
The advantages of such a method are provided corresponding to the statements above on the" advantages of the combustion chamber.<br>
A  first   stage  of  a  combustion  process preferably takes place initially, a second stage of the combustion process taking place subsequently by means of the heat-shield element.<br><br>
