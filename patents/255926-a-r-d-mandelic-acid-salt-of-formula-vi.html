				<td>NEW PROCESS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation and resolution of mandelic acid derivatives from racemic mandelic acid derivative mixtures, by salt formation with chiral base cyclic amides. The invention also relates to mandelic acid derivative cyclic amide salts, to certain other metal and amine salts of mandelic acid derivatives, as well as to the use of the resolved mandelic acid derivatives as intermediates suitable for large-scale manufacturing of, for example, pharmaceutical compounds.<br>
Background<br>
Various amines have been reported as resolving agents for mandelic acid derivatives. For the resolution of mandelic acids a number of chiral amines have been described, e.g. a-methy Ibenzylamine, 2-benzylamino-1 -butanol, (R)-2-tert-butyl-3 -methylimidazolidin-4-one (BMI), (+)-cinchonine, brucine, quinine, quinidine, (-)-ephedrine, (-)-2-amino-l-butanol, amphetamine and adrenaline. These amines as well as others are described in EJ. Ebbers et al. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1997,8,4047-4057 and references cited therein.<br>
In J. Hoover et al., (J. Med. Chem. 1974,17, 34-41) are disclosed 21 substituted mandelic acids with references to original literature. The described resolving bases are (-)-ephedrine, brucine and (+)-a-methylbenzylarnine.<br>
J. Nieuwenhuijzen et al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002,41,4281-4286) describes the resolution of 4-chloromandelic acid with a-methylbenzylamine with or without a 1:1 ortho:para mixture of nitro-substituted a-methylbenzylamine (10mol%).<br>
JP2001072644 describes optical resolution of 2-chloromandelic acid with N-benzyl-cc-methylbenzylamine and derivatives thereof. JP 1221345 describes optical resolution of phenyl-substituted mandelic acid derivatives with amino acid hydrazines.<br><br>
However, there remains a need for further means for resolving mandelic acid derivatives, Mandelic acids are used in the manufacture of a range of interesting molecules, such as Pharmaceuticals. Thus, the invention also relates to the use of the resolved mandelic acid derivatives as intermediates suitable for large-scale manufacturing of, for example pharmaceutical compounds, e.g. compounds as described in WO 02/44145.<br>
A number of bases, including such decribed in the art, were tested in order to obtain acceptable resolution of mandelic acid derivatives (particularly 3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxymandelic acid), e.g. a-methylbenzylamine, (S)-l-naphthyIethylamine, (+)-cinchonine, (+)-dihydroabietylamine, (S)-2-amino-2-phenylethanol, (-)-ephedrine, L-phenylalaniole, and a,a-diphenyl-D-prolinole. None of these yielded particularly satisfactory results for large-scale manufacturing purposes (having low yield and low enantiomeric excess). By large-scale we include manufacture of Kg quantities of material.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that racemic mandelic acid derivatives may be resolved by salt formation with chiral base cyclic amides, such as proline amide.<br>
We have also surprisingly found certain metal salts, and certain amine salts of mandelic acid derivatives (particularly (/?)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid) which have desirable characteristics and are useful in manufacturing processes - see Example 12 and claims hereinafter.<br>

The phrase "e.e." denotes an abbreviation for enantiomeric excess and is defined as the mole fraction denoting the enantiomers in a mixture:<br>
% e.e. = [R] - [S]/[R] + [S]<br>
where [R] and [S] are the concentrations of the (R)- and (^)-enantiomers. In a reaction a chiral compound is often obtained as a mixture of enantiomers. If, for example, 80% of the (/?)-enantiomer is formed and 20% of the (5)-enantiomer then the e.e. is: 80-20/80+20 = 60%.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail in the following non-limiting Examples.<br>
Examples 1-3<br>
In these Examples the following method was used, with volumes and amounts as outlined in Table 1.<br>
The racemic mandelic acid derivative 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid and (D)-proline amide were added to ethyl acetate saturated in water (8.1% water in ethyl acetate). The mixture was heated to reflux and stirred for 10 minutes at reflux. The thin suspension was cooled to 23°C over 13 hours followed by further cooling to 18°C over 40 minutes. The suspension was filtered and washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 30 ml) to give the salt. A sample was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 1 M HC1 and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, concentrated to dryness and analysed by chiral HPLC (for suitable methodology, see Example 11A). This showed a high degree of purity of the "correct" enantiomer (see Table 1), (/?)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid.<br>

To exemplify in more detail, the following scheme was used in Example 6: The racemic mandelic acid derivative 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid (26.18 g, 93.3 mmol, 1 eq, 90% pure according to HPLC) and (D)-proline amide (4.80 g, 42 mmol, 0.45 eq) were added to ethyl acetate (54.5 ml) and the mixture heated to reflux. At reflux, 5.5 ml of water was added and the mixture stirred for another 10 minutes at reflux. The thin suspension was allowed to cool to 18°C over 3 hours. The suspension was filtered and washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 30 ml) to give 8.6 g of the salt. A sample was dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 1 M HC1 and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, concentrated to dryness and analysed by chiral HPLC. This showed 98.2% of the "correct" (fl)-enantiomer. From the mother liquor more material crystallised, which was filtered, washed and dried. This gave another 1.6 g of the salt. The free (/?)-mandelic acid was analysed by HPLC (for suitable methodology, see Example 11 A) and contained 99.0% of the "correct" enantiomer.<br>

Example 10<br>
The racemic mandelic acid derivative 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid (0.2 g, 0.79 mmol) and (L)-proline amide (0.05g, 0.48mmol, 0.6 eq,) were added to 1 ml dioxane and the mixture heated to 90°C. During heat-up a thick suspension was formed. The suspension was filtered and (S)-mandelic acid liberated by extractive work up using 1 M HC1 and ethyl acetate. 0.05 g enantiomer of ee: 92% was obtained.<br>
Example 11; Racemisation procedure<br>
Once the desired ("right") mandelic acid/prolinamide (MAPA) salt has been isolated by filtration, the mother liquors containing an excess of the other ("wrong") mandelic acid enantiomer (and also some unprecipitated prolinamide salt of the "right" mandelic acid) may be racemised - see racemisation scheme below. The resulting racemate may again be used in the process of the invention to isolate more of the desired enantiomer. This racemisation/recycling process may be repeated a number of times to obtain higher yields of the desired enantiomer, for example two recycles may permit up to 70% overall yield of the "right" mandelic acid, and three recycles may permit up to 80% yield.<br>

Racemisation Scheme<br>
Example 11A ; Racemisation of mother liquor<br>
The mother liquor, in ethyl acetate, from the resolution process (for example, from any of Examples 1-9 above), containing the "wrong" mandelic acid enantiomer in excess (3.35 kg, 3.53 L, corresponds to 0.462 kg mandelic acid, 1.83 mol) was concentrated under reduced pressure at 50-55°C to a volume of 2.78 L. The solution was extracted at 15-25°C with 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid (0.62 kg, 1.69 mol, 0.92 eq) to remove D-prolinamide. The organic solution was washed with deionised water (0.58 kg) after which phase inversion occurred with the organic phase below the aqueous phase. Sodium chloride (0.030 kg) was added to invert the phases again and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed with 8.7% aqueous NaHCOa (0.71 kg, 0.74 mol, 0.40 eq). The organic phase was concentrated as much as possible under reduced pressure at 50-60°C, The remaining residue (0.483 kg) had a chemical purity of 76.5% as determined by HPLC and an optical purity for the 5-enantiomer of 81% as determined by chiral HPLC. The residue was dissolved in methanol (1.33 kg, 1.67<br>
L) and 30% aqueous potassium hydroxide (0.84 kg, 4.46 mol, 2.43 eq) was added at 25-40°C. The mixture was heated to 68-75°C and stirred for approximately 3.5 hours until complete racemisation had occurred according to chiral HPLC. Methanol was distilled off under reduced pressure at 40-50°C. Dichloromethane (1.35 kg, 1.02 L) and water (0.20 kg) were added to the aqueous solution and the mixture was cooled to 0-5°C. 20% Aqueous hydrochloric acid (1.17 kg, 1.10 L, 6.41 mol, 3.50 eq) was added within 20 minutes to the stirred two-phase mixture at T = 0-20°C (exothermic reaction, pH = 1). The mixture was stirred over a period of about 10 minutes at 20-25 °C until the precipitated oily product was dissolved completely in dichloromethane. The phases were separated and the aqueous solution was extracted with dichloromethane (0.53 kg, 0.40 L). The combined organic phases were washed with water (0.48 kg) and concentrated under reduced pressure at 40-50°C. This gave 0.443 kg of an oily product with a HPLC purity of 97.1 area%.<br>

The resulting racemate may again be used in the process of the invention to isolate more of the desired enantiomer, for example according to the following Example.<br>
Example 11B ; Resolution of the mandelic acid obtained after racemisation<br>
A solution of the racemic mandelic acid (obtained after the first racemisation) in ethyl acetate (1.433 kg of a 29.9% (w/w) solution, 6.429 kg racemic mandelic acid, 1.698 mol, 1.00 eq) was filtered and added within 30 minutes to a stirred solution of D-prolinamide (0.095 kg, 0.853 mol, 0.49 eq) in ethyl acetate (0.407 kg, 0.452 L) as well as water (0.153 kg) at 72-75°C. After the addition was completed a clear solution was obtained. The mixture was cooled to 58°C within 45 min. No crystallisation was observed. The mixture was cooled further to 0-2°C within 2.5 hours. The salt started to precipitate at approximately 55°C. After stirring for a further hour at 0-2°C, the solid was filtered off and washed twice with a pre-cooled (0-5°C) mixture of ethyl acetate/ water = 9:1 (w/w, 2 x 0.20 kg). A wet, off-white powder (0.264 kg) was obtained in 99.3% purity and 97.6% optical purity.<br>
If necessary, the optical purity can be further improved by slurrying the product with ethyl acetate/water and filtering. For example, the optical purity can be improved further by the following re-work procedure.<br>
Example 11C ; Re-work procedure<br>
The wet mandelic acid D-prolinamide salt (0.264 kg) was suspended in a mixture of ethyl acetate (1.00 kg, 1.11 L) and water (0.10 kg). The suspension was heated to 73-75°C and stirred for 30 minutes at this temperature. The suspension was cooled to 3-5°C within 2 hours and then stirred for another hour at this temperature. The solid was filtered off and washed twice with a pre-cooled (0-5°C) mixture of ethyl acetate/water = 9:1 (w/w, 2 x 0.38 kg). The white solid was dried under reduced pressure (10 mbar) at 35-40°C until the mandelic acid.D-prolinamide salt had constant weight. This gave 0.225 kg of product (73.9%, based on D-prolinamide) with a chemical purity of &gt;99% and optical purity of &gt;99%.<br>
This racemisation-resolution procedure can be repeated, for example twice. Furthermore, the D- or L-prolinamide may be recycled using conventional extraction techniques.<br>
Example 12; Different salts<br>
Once the mandelic acid enantiomers are separated then the desired enantiomer can be isolated as a different salt suitable for further processing. Depending which mandelic acid enantiomer is required, such a different salt may be isolated either from the prolinamide salt, or from the mother liquors remaining after the prolinamide salt has been filtered off.<br>
Thus, for example, (/?)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid.D-prolinamide salt may be isolated and then converted into a different salt for further processing. The mother liquors can then be racemised for recycling, for example as described before.<br>
Alternatively, (S)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid.L-prolinamide salt may be isolated and then a different salt of (K)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid isolated from the mother liquors. The (S)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid.L-prolinamide salt may then be used for racemisation and recycling.<br>
(K)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid ((2/?)-[3-chloro-5-(difluoromethoxy)-phenyl](hydroxy)acetic acid) is a useful intermediate, but the free acid compound has a low melting point (52°C) and is hard to crystallise. Furthermore, (/?)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-<br>
methoxy mandelic acid is very soluble compared to the unsubstituted mandelic acid. As mentioned earlier, although 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid is capable of forming salts with, for example, a,a-diphenyl-D-prolinole, such salts are not satisfactory for large-scale manufacturing purposes (having low yield and low enantiomeric excess).<br>
The Examples above describe the isolation of, for example, (R)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid from a racemic mixture by resolution with D-prolinamide. These cyclic amide resolving salts are expensive, and thus cheaper salts are of further interest to permit even more efficient large-scale manufacturing.<br>
We now provide further new salts of our substituted mandelic acids (of formula I) as a further feature of the invention. The discovery of such salts provides an efficient, inexpensive isolation of our mandelic acids as a solid, thereby creating opportunities for economic enantioselective processes and for improvements of the process using resolution with, for example, D-prolinamide.<br>
Enantioselective routes to (R)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid are also of interest, and in such cases an efficient, inexpensive salt of the mandelic acid is attractive. Preferably the salt should be crystalline, enhance the enantiomeric purity upon formation and be directly useable in a subsequent (coupling) reaction.<br>
The Examples below describe the preparation of certain metal salts of (/?)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid (calcium, zinc and magnesium salts). Also described is the preparation of certain amine salts of (R)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid (i.e. the salts formed with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, triethanolamine, piperazine, 1,4-dimethylpiperazine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine and 4-hydroxy-l,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine.<br>

Calcium salt<br>
To a suspension of 0.449 g (1.778 mmol) of the (/?)-mandelic acid (prepared from the (R)-MA-(D)-PA salt using HCl(aq), and water washing) in water (2.5 ml) was added a 25% w/w ammonia solution in water (0.133 g, 1.956 mmol, 1.1 eq), with a water transfer wash (0.15 ml). To the resulting solution was added a solution of 0.118 g (1.067 mmol. 0.6 eq) of calcium chloride in 0.7 ml of water, with a water transfer wash (0.1 ml). A solid was formed immediately. After 1 hour at ambient temperature, the mixture was cooled with an ice-bath and kept at 0°C for 2 hours. Then, the suspension was filtered and the solid material washed twice with ice-cold water (2 x 0.9 ml). The compound was dried at 40°C under vacuum to give 0.37 g (0.681 mmol, 76.6%) of the crystalline calcium salt (as confirmed by XRPD - as described hereinafter).<br>
The procedure can also be performed with calcium acetate in place of calcium chloride.<br>
Magnesium and zinc salts<br>
Crystalline magnesium and zinc salts (as confirmed by XRPD - as described hereinafter) were obtained using an analogous procedure to that described for the calcium salt. The (R)-mandelic acid.Mg salt was obtained in 16% yield (MP= 186°C) and the (/?)-mandelic acid.Zn salt was obtained in 78% yield.<br>
In a further experiment, the Mg salt of a racemic 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid was obtained (75% yield), using an analogous procedure to that described above, by addition of 0.6 eq of magnesium hydroxide to a suspension to the racemic mandelic acid in water. The salt was obtained as a crystalline solid (as confirmed by XRPD), with a melting point of<br>

The addition was accompanied by a wealc exotherm. The solution was heated to 66°C and isooctane added until the solution started to turn cloudy. The solution was cooled slowly to ambient temperature overnight. The solution was then cooled to 0°C and the salt precipitated after l'/2 hours stirring at 0°C. The suspension was stored in the refrigerator overnight, filtered, washed with EtOAc/isooctane 1.46:1 (2x1.23 ml), then vacuum dried at 40°C to give 0.500 g (1.244 mmol, 88%) of the crystalline (R)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid.triethanolamine salt (melting-point (MP) = 68°C).<br>
The crystallinity of the triethanolamine salt of the (7?)-mandelic acid was confirmed by DSC (endotherm onset = 68°C) and XRPD. The following XRPD d-values and intensities were obtained:<br>

Example 12B-2 ; Other amine salts<br>
Crystalline solid salts of (/?)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (MP = 153°C), piperazine (MP = 135°C), 1,4-dimethylpiperazine (MP = 93°C), 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (MP = 66°C) and 4-hydroxy-1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine (MP = 145°C) were obtained in an analogous way to Example 12B-1.<br>
The crystallinity of the above amine salts of the (7?)-mandelic acid was confirmed by XRPD as described herein.<br>
The above amine salts may be formed with the single (/?)- or (S)- enantiomer, or with a racemate of 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid.  For example, solid salts of a racemate of 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid were obtained by an analogous procedure to that described above with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, triethanolamine (crystalline, MP = 53°C), 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (crystalline, MP = 72°C) and 4-hydroxy-l,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine (crystalline, MP = 120°C).<br>
The dicyclohexylarnine salt of a racemate of 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid was obtained by an analogous procedure to that described above (but dicyclohexylarnine salts of single MA enantiomers were not obtained).<br>
Example 12C : Enantiomeric selectivity of the conglomerate triethanolamine salt<br>
The triethanolamine salt of 3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid is particularly interesting as it occurs as a crystalline conglomerate. This makes it possible to improve the enantiomeric excess of (R)- 3-chloro,5-difluoro-methoxy mandelic acid as product from an enantioselective process.<br>
There is a distinct difference between a conglomerate and a racemic compound. Looking at a 50:50 mixture of both enantiomers, a conglomerate consists of a mixture of crystals of the two enantiomers in equal amounts. Although in bulk the conglomerate is optically neutral, the individual crystals contain only the R or S-enantiomer. This is in contrast to a racemic compound where the individual crystals contain equal amounts of both enantiomers and the racemic crystals form a perfectly ordered array of R and 5" molecules. Racemic compounds and conglomerates can be distinguished by determination of their melting point diagrams (phase diagrams) or by using powder X-ray diffraction or solid state IR spectroscopy; the data of pure enantiomers are identical with the data of the conglomerate, but different from that of a racemic compound.<br>
For the triethanolamine salt of 3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid, being a conglomerate makes it possible to isolate the triethanolamine salt of the (7?)-mandelic acid from an enantiomerically enriched mixture of the mandelic acid by direct crystallisation. The maximum theoretical yield can be calculated by: 100-100x(amount of the wrong enantiomer present in the sample + same amount of the desired enantiomer)/total amount of solid. For example, starting with 95% w/w of the desired enantiomer, the maximum yield is 90%. Starting with 90% w/w of the desired enantiomer, the maximum yield is 80%, etc. (R)-3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxymandelic acid with an e.e. of 90% can, for example, be the product of an enantioselective process.<br>
Example 12C-1<br>
Racemic 3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid (51.25 mg, 0.203 mmol) was added to a 0.351 M solution of the (K)-mandelic acid (0.607 g, 2.405 mmol; prepared from the (fl)-MA-(D)-PA salt using HCl(aq), and water washing) in ethyl acetate at ambient temperature. The<br>
enantiomeric excess of the (7?)-mandelic acid in the solution was determined to be 92.4% by chiral HPLC analysis (performed as in Example 11 above). Triethanolamine (0.417 g, 2.739 mmol) was added to the solution at 23°C. The temperature rose to 25°C upon the addition. The solution was heated to 70°C. At 70°C, isooctane (1.5 ml) was added and the solution was seeded with a few granules of the triethanolamine salt of (#)-3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid (99.8% ee; see Example 12B). The solution was cooled to 65°C and since crystallization had not started the seeding was repeated. The solution was cooled to 26°C over 3 hours, but as there was still no precipitation of the salt, the solution was heated again to 70°C, seeded and then allowed to cool. Finally, the crystallization started at 58°C after another seeding. The suspension was cooled to ambient temperature and left to stir overnight. A sample was filtered off the next morning, the optical purity of which was determined to be 98.1% ee by chiral HPLC analysis (see Example 11). The bulk of the suspension was cooled to, and stirred at 1°C for 2 V* hours. The salt was isolated by filtration, washed with EtOAc/isooctane 2.5:1 (2x2.07 ml) and vacuum dried at 40°C overnight to give the triethanolamine salt of (#)-3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid as a white powder (0.897 g, 88.8%).

The enantiomeric excess of (jR)-mandelic acid in the solution was determined to be 91.1% by chiral HPLC analysis (see Example 11). Triethanolamine (2.566 g, 16.856 mmol) was added to the solution at 23°C. The temperature rose to 29°C upon the addition. The solution was heated to 70°C. At 70°C isooctane (8.6 ml) was added and the solution was seeded with a few granules of the triethanolamine salt of CR)-3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid (99.8% ee; see Example 12B). The solution was cooled to 65°C and since crystallization had not started the seeding was repeated. The solution was cooled by stages and seeded four more times. Finally at about 40°C the salt crystallized. The suspension was cooled to room temperature and left to stir overnight. A sample was filtered off the next morning, the optical<br>
purity of which was determined to be 97.0% ee by chiral HPLC analysis (see Example 11). The bulk of the suspension was cooled to and stirred at 1°C for 2 % hours. The salt was isolated by filtration, washed with EtOAc/isooctane 4:1 (2x7.5 ml) and vacuum dried at 40°C overnight to give the triethanolamine salt of (/?)-3-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy mandelic acid as a white powder (5.451 g, 92.0%). The optical purity of the salt was determined to be 98.7% ee by chiral HPLC analysis (see Example 11).<br>
