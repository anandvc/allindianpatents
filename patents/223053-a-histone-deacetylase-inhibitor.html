				<td>A HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates to the inhibition of histone deacetylase. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to compounds and methods for inhibiting histone deacetylase enzymatic activity.<br>
Summary of the Related Art<br>
[0002] In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA associates with histones to form a compact complex<br>
called chromatin. The histones constitute a family of basic proteins which are generally highly<br>
conserved across eukaryotic species. The core histones, termed H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, associate<br>
to form a protein core. DNA winds around this protein core, with the basic amino acids of the<br>
histones interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA. Approximately 146<br>
base pairs of DNA wrap around a histone core to make up a nucleosome particle, the repeating<br>
structural motif of chromatin.<br>
[0003] Csordas, Biochem. J., 286: 23-38 (1990) teaches that histones are subject to<br>
posttranslational acetylation of the ?,?-amino groups of /V-terminal lysine residues, a reaction that is<br>
catalyzed by histone acetyl transferase (HAT1). Acetylation neutralizes the positive charge of the<br>
lysine side chain, and is thought to impact chromatin structure. Indeed, Taunton et a/., Science,<br>
272: 408-411 (1996), teaches that access of transcription factors to chromatin templates is<br>
enhanced by histone hyperacetylation. Taunton et al., further teaches that an enrichment in<br>
underacetylated histone H4 has been found in transcriptionally silent regions of the genome.<br>
[0004] Histone acetylation is a reversible modification, with deacetylation being catalyzed by a<br>
family of enzymes termed histone deacetylases (HDACs). Grozinger et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA, 96: 4868-4873 (1999), teaches that HDACs is divided into two classes, the first represented<br>
by yeast Rpd3-like proteins, and the second represented by yeast Hdal-like proteins. Grozinger et<br>
al. also teaches that the human HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 proteins are members of the first class<br>
of HDACs, and discloses new proteins, named HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC6, which-are members of<br>
the second class of HDACs. Kao et a/., Genes &amp; Dev., 14: 55-66 (2000), discloses HDAC7, a new<br>
member of the second class of HDACs. Van den Wyngaert, FEBS, 478: 77-83 (2000) discloses<br>
HDAC8, a new member of the first class of HDACs.<br><br>
[0005] Richon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95: 3003-3007 (1998), discloses that HDAC<br>
activity is inhibited by trichostatin A (TSA), a natural product isolated from Streptomyces<br>
hygroscopicus, and by a synthetic compound, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Yoshida and<br>
Beppu, Exper. Cell Res., 177: 122-131 (1988), teaches that TSA causes arrest of rat fibroblasts at<br>
the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, implicating HDAC in cell cycle regulation. Indeed, Finnin et al.,<br>
Nature, 401: 188-193 (1999), teaches that TSA and SAHA inhibit cell growth, induce terminal<br>
differentiation, and prevent the formation of tumors in mice. Suzuki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,905,<br>
EP 0847992, JP 258863/96, and Japanese Application No. 10138957, disclose benzamide<br>
derivatives that induce cell differentiation and inhibit HDAC. Delorme et al., WO 01/38322 and PCT<br>
IB01/00683, disclose additional compounds that serve as HDAC inhibitors.<br>
[0006] The molecular cloning of gene sequences encoding proteins with HDAC activity has<br>
established the existence of a set of discrete HDAC enzyme isoforms. Grozinger et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 96:4868-4873 (1999), teaches that HDACs may be divided into two classes, the<br>
first represented by yeast Rpd3-like proteins, and the second represented by yeast Hdal-like<br>
proteins. Grozinger et al. also teaches that the human HDAC-1, HDAC-2, and HDAC-3 proteins are<br>
members of the first class of HDACs, and discloses new proteins, named HDAC-4, HDAC-5, and<br>
HDAC-6, which are members of the second class of HDACs. Kao et al., Gene &amp; Development 14:55-<br>
66 (2000), discloses an additional member of this second class, called HDAC-7. More recently, Hu,<br>
E. et al. J. Bio. Chem. 275:15254-13264 (2000) discloses the newest member of the first class of<br>
histone deacetylases, HDAC-8. It has been unclear what roles these individual HDAC enzymes play.<br>
[0007] These findings suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity represents a novel approach for<br>
intervening in cell cycle regulation and that HDAC inhibitors have great therapeutic potential in the<br>
treatment of cell proliferative diseases or conditions. To date, few inhibitors of histone deacetylase<br>
are known in the art. There is thus a need to identify additional HDAC inhibitors and to identify the<br>
structural features required for potent HDAC inhibitory activity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015] The invention provides compounds and methods for inhibiting histone deacetylase<br>
enzymatic activity. The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating cell<br>
proliferative diseases and conditions. The patent and scientific literature referred to herein<br>
establishes knowledge that is available to those with skill in the art. The issued patents, applications,<br>
and references that are cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if<br>
each was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. In the case of<br>
inconsistencies, the present disclosure will prevail.<br>
[0016] For purposes of the present invention, the following definitions will be used (unless<br>
expressly stated otherwise):<br>
[0017] As used herein, the terms "histone deacetylase" and "HDAC" are intended to refer to any<br>
one of a family of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from the ,-amino groups of lysine residues at<br>
the N-terminus of a histone. Unless otherwise indicated by context, the term "histone" is meant to<br>
refer to any histone protein, including H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and H5, from any species. Preferred<br>
histone deacetylases include class I and class II enzymes. Preferably the histone deacetylase is a<br>
human HDAC, including, but not limited to, HDAC-1, HDAC-2, HDAC-3, HDAC-4, HDAC-5, HDAC-6,<br><br>
HDAC-7, and HDAC-8. In some other preferred embodiments, the histone deacetylase is derived<br>
from a protozoal or fungal source.<br>
[0018] The terms "histone deacetylase inhibitor" and "inhibitor of histone deacetylase" are used<br>
to identify a compound having a structure as defined herein, which is capable of interacting with a<br>
histone deacetylase and inhibiting its enzymatic activity. "Inhibiting histone deacetylase enzymatic<br>
activity" means reducing the ability of a histone deacetylase to remove an acetyl group from a<br>
histone. In some preferred embodiments, such reduction of histone deacetylase activity is at least<br>
about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, and still more preferably at least about 90%. In<br>
other preferred embodiments, histone deacetylase activity is reduced by at least 95% and more<br>
preferably by at least 99%.<br>
[0019] Preferably, such inhibition is specific, i.e., the histone deacetylase inhibitor reduces the<br>
ability of a histone deacetylase to remove an acetyl group from a histone at a concentration that is<br>
lower than the concentration of the inhibitor that is required to produce another, unrelated biological<br>
effect. Preferably, the concentration of the inhibitor required for histone deacetylase inhibitory<br>
activity is at least 2-fold lower, more preferably at least 5-fold lower, even more preferably at least<br>
10-fold lower, and most preferably at least 20-fold lower than the concentration required to produce<br>
an unrelated biological effect.<br>
[0020] For simplicity, chemical moieties are defined and referred to throughout primarily as<br>
univalent chemical moieties (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.). Nevertheless, such terms are also used to convey<br>
corresponding multivalent moieties under the appropriate structural circumstances clear to those<br>
skilled in the art. For example, while an "alkyl" moiety generally refers to a monovalent radical (e.g.<br>
CH3-CH2-), in certain circumstances a bivalent linking moiety can be "alkyl," in which case those<br>
skilled in the art will understand the alkyl to be a divalent radical (e.g., -CH2-CH2-), which is equivalent<br>
to the term "alkylene." (Similarly, in circumstances in which a divalent moiety is required and is<br>
stated as being "aryl," those skilled in the art will understand that the term "aryl" refers to the<br>
corresponding divalent moiety, arylene.) All atoms are understood to have their normal number of<br>
valences for bond formation (i.e., 4 for carbon, 3 for N, 2 for O, and 2, 4, or 6 for S, depending on<br>
the oxidation state of the S). On occasion a moiety may be defined, for example, as (A)a-B-, wherein<br>
a is 0 or 1. In such instances, when a is 0 the moiety is B- and when a is 1 the moiety is A-B-. Also,<br>
a number of moieties disclosed herein exist in multiple tautomeric forms, all of which are intended to<br>
be encompassed by any given tautomeric structure.<br><br>
[0021] The term "hydrocarbyl" refers to a straight, branched, or cyclic alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl,<br>
each as defined herein. A "C0" hydrocarbyl is used to refer to a covalent bond. Thus, "Co-C3-<br>
hydrocarbyl" includes a covalent bond, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and cyclopropyl.<br>
[0022] The term "alkyl" as employed herein refers to straight and branched chain aliphatic<br>
groups having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1-8 carbon atoms, and more preferably 1-6<br>
carbon atoms, which is optionally substituted with one, two or three substituents. Preferred alkyl<br>
groups include, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl,<br>
pentyl, and hexyl. A "Co" alkyl (as in "C0-C3-alkyl") is a covalent bond (like "Co" hydrocarbyl).<br>
[0023] The term "alkenyl" as used herein means an unsaturated straight or branched chain<br>
aliphatic group with one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably 2-8 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2-6 carbon atoms, which is optionally substituted<br>
with one, two or three substituents. Preferred alkenyl groups include, without limitation, ethenyl,<br>
propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, and hexenyl.<br>
[0024] The term "alkynyl" as used herein means an unsaturated straight or branched chain<br>
aliphatic group with one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds, having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
preferably 2-8 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2-6 carbon atoms, which is optionally substituted<br>
with one, two or three substituents. Preferred alkynyl groups include, without limitation, ethynyl,<br>
propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, and hexynyl.<br>
[0025] An "alkylene," "alkenylene," or "alkynylene" group is an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group, as<br>
defined hereinabove, that is positioned between and serves to connect two other chemical groups.<br>
Preferred alkylene groups include, without limitation, methylene, ethylene, propylene, and butylene.<br>
Preferred alkenylene groups include, without limitation, ethenylene, propenylene, and butenylene.<br>

[0026] The term "cycloalkyl" as employed herein includes saturated and partially unsaturated<br>
cyclic hydrocarbon groups having 3 to 12 carbons, preferably 3 to 8 carbons, and more preferably 3<br>
to 6 carbons, wherein the cycloalkyl group additionally is optionally substituted. Preferred cycloalkyl<br>
groups include, without limitation, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl,<br>
cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl.<br>
[0027] The term "heteroalkyl" refers to an alkyl group, as defined hereinabove, wherein one or<br>
more carbon atoms in the chain are replaced by a heteratom selected from the group consisting of<br>
O, S, and N.<br><br>
[0098] An "aryl" group is a C6-C14 aromatic moiety comprising one to three aromatic rings, which<br>
is optionally substituted. Preferably, the aryl group is a C6-C10 aryl group. Preferred aryl groups<br>
include, without limitation, phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and fluorenyl. An "aralkyl" or "arylalkyl"<br>
group comprises an aryl group covalently linked to an alkyl group, either of which may independently<br>
be optionally substituted or unsubstituted. Preferably, the aralkyl group is (C1-C6)alk(C6-C10)aryl,<br>

[0029] A "heterocyclyl" or "heterocyclic" group is a ring structure having from about 3 to about 8<br>
atoms, wherein one or more atoms are selected from the group consisting of N, 0, and S. The<br>

the presence of NaOMe and phenyl hydrazine followed by saponification, afforded the intermediate<br>
acid CXXII. This material was coupled with 1,2-diaminobenzene in a standard fashion to afford<br>
CXXIII.<br><br>
[0136] Consecutive treatment of acetyl acetone with methyl bromomethylbenzoate in the<br>
presence of NaOMe and a 1:1 mixture AcOH-HCI (conc.) afforded the intermediate acid CXXIV. This<br>
ketoacid reacting with sulfur and malonodinitrile in the presence of a base, produced the thiophene<br>
CXXV, which was converted into the desired CXXVII using standard procedures.<br><br>
[0137] Compounds such as CXXX preferably may be prepared according to the synthetic<br>
scheme 50. Treatment of 4-cyanomethylbenzoic acid with hydroxylamine produced the amidoxime<br>
CXXVIII, which upon treatment with acetic anhydride was converted into the oxadiazole CXXIX. The<br>
latter was coupled with 1,2-diaminobenzene in a standard fashion to afford CXXX.<br><br>
[0138] Compounds such as CXXXIII preferably may be prepared according to the synthetic route<br>
depicted in Scheme 57. Treatment of 4-formylbenzoic acid with thionyl chloride afford the acyl<br><br>
chloride which is coupled with protected anilide to produce CXXXI. Reductive amination with<br>
dimethoxyaniline using phenylsilane and tin catalyst yields to the protected anilide CXXXII. Treatment<br>
with isocyanate followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid provides the ureidoanilide CXXXIII.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0139] In a second aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an<br>
inhibitor of histone deacetylase according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br>
excipient, or diluent. Compounds of the invention may be formulated by any method well known in<br>
the art and may be prepared for administration by any route, including, without limitation, parenteral,<br>
oral, sublingual, transdermal, topical, intranasal, intratracheal, or intrarectal. In certain preferred<br>
embodiments, compounds of the invention are administered intravenously in a hospital setting. In<br>
certain other preferred embodiments, administration may preferably be by the oral route.<br>
[0140] The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. As used<br>
herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a non-toxic material that is compatible with a<br>
biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism, and that does not interfere with the<br>
effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredien(s). Thus, compositions according to<br>
the invention may contain, in addition to the inhibitor, diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers,<br>
solubilizers, and other materials well known in the art. The preparation of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable formulations is described in, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition,<br>
ed. A. Gennaro, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990.<br>
[0141] As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts that retain the<br>
desired biological activity of the above-identified compounds and exhibit minimal or no undesired<br>
toxicological effects. Examples of such salts include, but are not limited to acid addition salts<br>
formed with inorganic acids (for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and the like), and salts formed with organic acids such as acetic acid,<br>
oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, pamoic<br>
acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, and<br>
polygalacturonic acid. The compounds can also be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
quaternary salts known by those skilled in the art, which specifically include the quaternary<br>
ammonium salt of the formula -NR + Z-, wherein R is hydrogen, alkyl, or benzyl, and Z is a counterion,<br>
including chloride, bromide, iodide, -O-alkyl, toluenesulfonate, methylsulfonate, sulfonate, phosphate,<br><br>
or carboxylate (such as benzoate, succinate, acetate, glycolate, maleate, malate, citrate, tartrate,<br>
ascorbate, benzoate, cinnamoate, mandeloate, benzyloate, and diphenylacetate).<br>
[0142] The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in<br>
an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutically effective amount without causing serious<br>
toxic effects in the patient treated. A preferred dose of the active compound for all of the above-<br>
mentioned conditions is in the range from about 0.01 to 300 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mgAg<br>
per day, more generally 0.5 to about 25 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. A<br>
typical topical dosage will range from 0.01-3% wt/wt in a suitable carrier. The effective dosage<br>
range of the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives can be calculated based on the weight of the<br>
parent compound to be delivered. If the derivative exhibits activity in itself, the effective dosage can<br>
be estimated as above using the weight of the derivative, or by other means known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase<br>
[0143] In a third aspect, the invention provides a method of inhibiting histone deacetylase in a<br>
cell, comprising contacting a cell in which inhibition of histone deacetylase is desired with an inhibitor<br>
of histone deacetylase according to the invention. Because compounds of the invention inhibit<br>
histone deacetylase, they are useful research tools for in vitro study of the role of histone<br>
deacetylase in biological processes. In addition, the compounds of the invention selectively inhibit<br>
certain isoforms of HDAC.<br>
[0144] Measurement of the enzymatic activity of a histone deacetylase can be achieved using<br>
known methodologies. For example, Yoshida et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265: 17174-17179 (1990),<br>
describes the assessment of histone deacetylase enzymatic activity by the detection of acetylated<br>
histones in trichostatin A treated cells. Taunton et al., Science, 272: 408-411 (1996), similarly<br>
describes methods to measure histone deacetylase enzymatic activity using endogenous and<br>
recombinant HDAC-1.<br>
[0145] In some preferred embodiments, the histone deacetylase inhibitor interacts with and<br>
reduces the activity of all histone deacetylases in the cell. In some other preferred embodiments<br>
according to this aspect of the invention, the histone deacetylase inhibitor interacts with and reduces<br>
the activity of fewer than all histone deacetylases in the cell. In certain preferred embodiments, the<br>
inhibitor interacts with and reduces the activity of one histone deacetylase (e.g., HDAC-1), but does<br>
not interact with or reduce the activities of other histone deacetylases (e.g., HDAC-2, HDAC-3, HDAC-<br><br>
4, HDAC-5, HDAC-6, HDAC-7, and HDAC-8). As discussed below, certain particularly preferred<br>
histone deacetylase inhibitors are those that interact with, and reduce the enzymatic activity of, a<br>
histone deacetylase that is involved in tumorigenesis. Certain other preferred histone deacetylase<br>
inhibitors interact with and reduce the enzymatic activity of a fungal histone deacetylase.<br>
[0146] Preferably, the method according to the third aspect of the invention causes an inhibition<br>
of cell proliferation of the contacted cells. The phrase "inhibiting cell proliferation" is used to denote<br>
an ability of an inhibitor of histone deacetylase to retard the growth of cells contacted with the<br>
inhibitor as compared to cells not contacted. An assessment of cell proliferation can be made by<br>
counting contacted and non-contacted cells using a Coulter Cell Counter (Coulter, Miami, FL) or a<br>
hemacytometer. Where the cells are in a solid growth (e.g., a solid tumor or organ), such an<br>
assessment of cell proliferation can be made by measuring the growth with calipers and comparing<br>
the size of the growth of contacted cells with non-contacted cells.<br>
[0147] Preferably, growth of cells contacted with the inhibitor is retarded by at least 50% as<br>
compared to growth of non-contacted cells. More preferably, cell proliferation is inhibited by 100%<br>
(i.e., the contacted cells do not increase in number). Most preferably, the phrase "inhibiting cell<br>
proliferation" includes a reduction in the number or size of contacted cells, as compared to non-<br>
contacted cells. Thus, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase according to the invention that inhibits cell<br>
proliferation in a contacted cell may induce the contacted cell to undergo growth retardation, to<br>
undergo growth arrest, to undergo programmed cell death (i.e., to apoptose), or to undergo necrotic<br>
cell death.<br>
[0148] The cell proliferation inhibiting ability of the histone deacetylase inhibitors according to<br>
the invention allows the synchronization of a population of asynchronously growing cells. For<br>
example, the histone deacetylase inhibitors of the invention may be used to arrest a population of<br>
non-neoplastic cells grown in vitro in the Gl or G2 phase of the cell cycle. Such synchronization<br>
allows, for example, the identification of gene and/or gene products expressed during the Gl or G2<br>
phase of the cell cycle. Such synchronization of cultured cells may also be useful for testing the<br>
efficacy of a new transfection protocol, where transfection efficiency varies and is dependent upon<br>
the particular cell cycle phase of the cell to be transfected. Use of the histone deacetylase inhibitors<br>
of the invention allows the synchronization of a population of cells, thereby aiding detection of<br>
enhanced transfection efficiency.<br><br>
[0149] In some preferred embodiments, the contacted cell is a neoplastic cell. The term<br>
"neoplastic cell" is used to denote a cell that shows aberrant cell growth. Preferably, the aberrant cell<br>
growth of a neoplastic cell is increased cell growth. A neoplastic cell may be a hyperplastic cell, a<br>
cell that shows a lack of contact inhibition of growth in vitro, a benign tumor cell that is incapable of<br>
metastasis in vivo, or a cancer cell that is capable of metastasis in vivo and that may recur after<br>
attempted removal. The term "tumorigenesis" is used to denote the induction of cell proliferation that<br>
leads to the development of a neoplastic growth. In some embodiments, the histone deacetylase<br>
inhibitor induces cell differentiation in the contacted cell. Thus, a neoplastic cell, when contacted<br>
with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase may be induced to differentiate, resulting in the production of<br>
a non-neoplastic daughter cell that is phylogenetically more advanced than the contacted cell.<br>
[0150] In some preferred embodiments, the contacted cell is in an animal. Thus, the invention<br>
provides a method for treating a cell proliferative disease or condition in an animal, comprising<br>
administering to an animal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a histone<br>
deacetylase inhibitor of the invention. Preferably, the animal is a mammal, more preferably a<br>
domesticated mammal. Most preferably, the animal is a human.<br>
[0151] The term "cell proliferative disease or condition" is meant to refer to any condition<br>
characterized by aberrant cell growth, preferably abnormally increased cellular proliferation.<br>
Examples of such cell proliferative diseases or conditions include, but are not limited to, cancer,<br>
restenosis, and psoriasis. In particularly preferred embodiments, the invention provides a method for<br>
inhibiting neoplastic cell proliferation in an animal comprising administering to an animal having at<br>
least one neoplastic cell present in its body a therapeutically effective amount of a histone<br>
deacetylase inhibitor of the invention.<br>
[0152] It is contemplated that some compounds of the invention have inhibitory activity against a<br>
histone deacetylase from a protozoal source. Thus, the invention also provides a method for treating<br>
or preventing a protozoal disease or infection, comprising administering to an animal in need of such<br>
treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a histone deacetylase inhibitor of the invention.<br>
Preferably the animal is a mammal, more preferably a human. Preferably, the histone deacetylase<br>
inhibitor used according to this embodiment of the invention inhibits a protozoal histone deacetylase<br>
to a greater extent than it inhibits mammalian histone deacetylases, particularly human histone<br>
deacetylases.<br><br>
[0153] The present invention further provides a method for treating a fungal disease or infection<br>
comprising administering to an animal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
a histone deacetylase inhibitor of the invention. Preferably the animal is a mammal, more preferably<br>
a human. Preferably, the histone deacetylase inhibitor used according to this embodiment of the<br>
invention inhibits a fungal histone deacetylase to a greater extent than it inhibits mammalian histone<br>
deacetylases, particularly human histone deacetylases.<br>
[0154] The term "therapeutically effective amount" is meant to denote a dosage sufficient to<br>
cause inhibition of histone deacetylase activity in the cells of the subject, or a dosage sufficient to<br>
inhibit cell proliferation or to induce cell differentiation in the subject. Administration may be by any<br>
route, including, without limitation, parenteral, oral, sublingual, transdermal, topical, intranasal,<br>
intratracheal, or intrarectal. In certain particularly preferred embodiments, compounds of the<br>
invention are administered intravenously in a hospital setting. In certain other preferred<br>
embodiments, administration may preferably be by the oral route.<br>
[0155] When administered systemically, the histone deacetylase inhibitor is preferably<br>
administered at a sufficient dosage to attain a blood level of the inhibitor from about 0.01 ?M to<br>
about 100 ?M, more preferably from about 0.05 ?M to about 50 ?M, still more preferably from<br>
about 0.1 ?M to about 25 ?M, and still yet more preferably from about 0.5 ?M to about 25 ?M. For<br>
localized administration, much lower concentrations than this may be effective, and much higher<br>
concentrations may be tolerated. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the dosage of histone<br>
deacetylase inhibitor necessary to produce a therapeutic effect may vary considerably depending on<br>
the tissue, organ, or the particular animal or patient to be treated.<br>
[0156] In certain preferred embodiments of the third aspect of the invention, the method further<br>
comprises contacting the cell with an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the expression of a<br>
histone deacetylase. The combined use of a nucleic acid level inhibitor (e.g., antisense<br>
oligonucleotide) and a protein level inhibitor (i.e., inhibitor of histone deacetylase enzyme activity)<br>
results in an improved inhibitory effect, thereby reducing the amounts of the inhibitors required to<br>
obtain a given inhibitory effect as compared to the amounts necessary when either is used<br>
individually. The antisense oligonucleotides according to this aspect of the invention are<br>
complementary to regions of RNA or double-stranded DNA that encode HDAC-1, HDAC-2, HDAC-3,<br>
HDAC4, HDAC-5, HDAC-6, HDAC7, and/or HDAC-8 (see e.g., GenBank Accession Number U50079<br><br>
for HDAC-1, GenBank Accession Number U31814 for HDAC-2, and GenBank Accession Number<br>
U75697 for HDAC-3).<br>
[0157] For purposes of the invention, the term "oligonucleotide" includes polymers of two or<br>
more deoxyribonucleosides, ribonucleosides, or 2'-substituted ribonucleoside residues, or any<br>
combination thereof. Preferably, such oligonucleotides have from about 6 to about 100 nucleoside<br>
residues, more preferably from about 8 to about 50 nucleoside residues, and most preferably from<br>
about 12 to about 30 nucleoside residues. The nucleoside residues may be coupled to each other<br>
by any of the numerous known internucleoside linkages. Such internucleoside linkages include<br>
without limitation phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, alkylphosphonate, alkylphosphonothioate,<br>
phosphotriester, phosphoramidate, siloxane, carbonate, carboxymethylester, acetamidate,<br>
carbamate, thioether, bridged phosphoramidate, bridged methylene phosphonate, bridged<br>
phosphorothioate and sulfone internucleoside linkages. In certain preferred embodiments, these<br>
internucleoside linkages may be phosphodiester, phosphotriester, phosphorothioate, or<br>
phosphoramidate linkages, or combinations thereof. The term oligonucleotide also encompasses<br>
such polymers having chemically modified bases or sugars and/ or having additional substituents,<br>
including without limitation lipophilic groups, intercalating agents, diamines and adamantane.<br>
[0158] For purposes of the invention the term "2'-substituted ribonucleoside" includes<br>
ribonucleosides in which the hydroxyl group at the 2' position of the pentose moiety is substituted to<br>
produce a 2'-O-substituted ribonucleoside. Preferably, such substitution is with a lower alkyl group<br>
containing 1-6 saturated or unsaturated carbon atoms, or with an aryl or allyl group having 2-6<br>
carbon atoms, wherein such alkyl, aryl or allyl group may be unsubstituted or may be substituted,<br>
e.g., with halo, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, acyl, acyloxy, alkoxy, carboxyl, carbalkoxyl, or<br>
amino groups. The term "2'-substituted ribonucleoside" also includes ribonucleosides in which the 2'-<br>
hydroxyl group is replaced with an amino group or with a halo group, preferably fluoro.<br>
[0159] Particularly preferred antisense oligonucleotides utilized in this aspect of the invention<br>
include chimeric oligonucleotides and hybrid oligonucleotides.<br>
[0160] For purposes of the invention, a "chimeric oligonucleotide" refers to an oligonucleotide<br>
having more than one type of internucleoside linkage. One preferred example of such a chimeric<br>
oligonucleotide is a chimeric oligonucleotide comprising a phosphorothioate, phosphodiester or<br>
phosphorodithioate region, preferably comprising from about 2 to about 12 nucleotides, and an<br>
alkylphosphonate or alkylphosphonothioate region (see e.g., Pederson et al. U.S. Patent Nos.<br><br>
5,635,377 and 5,366,878). Preferably, such chimeric oligonucleotides contain at least three<br>
consecutive internucleoside linkages selected from phosphodiester and phosphorothioate linkages,<br>
or combinations thereof.<br>
[0161] For purposes of the invention, a "hybrid oligonucleotide" refers to an oligonucleotide<br>
having more than one type of nucleoside. One preferred example of such a hybrid oligonucleotide<br>
comprises a ribonucleotide or 2'-substituted ribonucleotide region, preferably comprising from about<br>
2 to about 12 2'-substituted nucleotides, and a deoxyribonucleotide region. Preferably, such a hybrid<br>
oligonucleotide contains at least three consecutive deoxyribonucleosides and also contains<br>
ribonucleosides, 2'-substituted ribonucleosides, preferably 2'-O-substituted ribonucleosides, or<br>
combinations thereof (see e.g., Metelev and Agrawal, U.S. Patent No. 5,652,355).<br>
[0162] The exact nucleotide sequence and chemical structure of an antisense oligonucleotide<br>
utilized in the invention can be varied, so long as the oligonucleotide retains its ability to inhibit<br>
expression of the gene of interest. This is readily determined by testing whether the particular<br>
antisense oligonucleotide is active. Useful assays for this purpose include quantitating the mRNA<br>
encoding a product of the gene, a Western blotting analysis assay for the product of the gene, an<br>
activity assay for an enzymatically active gene product, or a soft agar growth assay, or a reporter<br>
gene construct assay, or an in vivo tumor growth assay, all of which are described in detail in this<br>
specification or in Ramchandani et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94: 684-689.<br>
[0163] Antisense oligonucleotides utilized in the invention may conveniently be synthesized on a<br>
suitable solid support using well known chemical approaches, including H-phosphonate chemistry,<br>
phosphoramidite chemistry, or a combination of H-phosphonate chemistry and phosphoramidite<br>
chemistry (i.e., H-phosphonate chemistry for some cycles and phosphoramidite chemistry for other<br>
cycles). Suitable solid supports include any of the standard solid supports used for solid phase<br>
oligonucleotide synthesis, such as controlled-pore glass (CPG) (see, e.g., Pon, R.T. (1993) Methods<br>
in Molec. Biol. 20: 465-496).<br>
[0164] Particularly preferred oligonucleotides have nucleotide sequences of from about 13 to<br>
about 35 nucleotides which include the nucleotide sequences shown in Table 1. Yet additional<br>
particularly preferred oligonucleotides have nucleotide sequences of from about 15 to about 26<br>
nucleotides of the nucleotide sequences shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
[0165] The following examples are intended to further illustrate certain preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>

Assay Example 1<br>
Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase Enzymatic Activity<br>
1. Human HDAC-1<br>
[0394] HDAC inhibitors were screened against a cloned recombinant human HDAC-1 enzyme<br>
expressed and purified from a Baculovirus insect cell expression system. For deacetylase assays,<br>
20,000 cpm of the [3H]-metabolically labeled acetylated histone substrate (M. Yoshida et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 265(28): 17174-17179 (1990)) was incubated with 30 ?g of the cloned recombinant hHDAC-<br>
1 for 10 minutes at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding acetic acid (0.04 M, final<br>
concentration) and HCI (250 mM. final concentration). The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate<br>
and the released [3H]-acetic acid was quantified by scintillation counting. For inhibition studies, the<br>
enzyme was preincubated with compounds at 4 °C for 30 minutes prior to initiation of the enzymatic<br>
assay. IC50 values for HDAC enzyme inhibitors were determined by performing dose response<br>
curves with individual compounds and determining the concentration of inhibitor producing fifty<br>
percent of the maximal inhibition. IC50 values for representative compounds are presented in the<br>
third column of Table 5.<br>
2. MTT Assay<br>
[0395] HCT116 cells (2000/well) were plated into 96-well tissue culture plates one day before<br>
compound treatment. Compounds at various concentrations were added to the cells. The cells were<br>
incubated for 72 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl<br>
tetrazolium bromide, Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated with the<br>
cells for 4 hours before one volume of solubilization buffer (50% N,N-dimethylformamide, 20% SDS,<br>
pH 4.7) was added onto the cultured cells. After overnight incubation, solubilized dye was quantified<br>
by colorimetric reading at 570 nM using a reference at 630 nM using an MR700 plate reader<br>
(Dynatech Laboratories Inc.). OD values were converted to cell numbers according to a standard<br>
growth curve of the relevant cell line. The concentration which reduces cell numbers to 50% of that<br>
of solvent treated cells is determined as MTT IC50. IC50 values for representative compounds are<br>
presented in the fourth column of Table 5.<br><br>
3. Histone H4 acetvlation in whole cells by immunoblots<br>
[0396] T24 human bladder cancer cells growing in culture were incubated with HDAC inhibitors<br>
for 16 h. Histones were extracted from the cells after the culture period as described by M. Yoshida<br>
et al. (J.. Biol. Chem. 265(28): 17174-17179 (1990)). 20 g of total histone protein was loaded onto<br>
SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with polyclonal<br>
antibodies specific for acetylated histone H-4 (Upstate Biotech Inc.), followed by horse radish<br>
peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECU<br>
(Amersham) detection was performed using Kodak films (Eastman Kodak). Acetylated H-4 signal was<br>
quantified by densitometry. Representative data are presented in the fifth column of Table 5. Data<br>
are presented as the concentration effective for reducing the acetylated H-4 signal by 50% (EC50).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Assay Example 2<br>
Antineoplastic Effects of Histone Deacetylase<br>
Inhibitor son Human Tumor Xenografts In Vivo<br>
[0397] Eight to ten week old female BALB/c nude mice (Taconic Labs, Great Barrington, NY)<br>
were injected subcutaneously in the flank area with 2 x 106 preconditioned HCT116 human colorectal<br>
carcinoma cells. Preconditioning of these cells was done by a minimum of three consecutive tumor<br>
transplantations in the same strain of nude mice. Subsequently, tumor fragments of approximately<br>
30 mgs were excised and implanted subcutaneously in mice, in the left flank area, under Forene<br>
anesthesia (Abbott Labs, Geneve, Switzerland). When the tumors reached a mean volume of 100<br>
mm3, the mice were treated intravenously, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally by daily injection, with<br>
a solution of the histone deacetylase inhibitor in an appropriate vehicle, such as PBS, DMSO/water,<br>
or Tween 80/water, at a starting dose of 10 mgAg- The optimal dose of the HDAC inhibitor was<br>
established by dose response experiments according to standard protocols. Tumor volume was<br>
calculated every second day post infusion according to standard methods (e.g., Meyer etal., Int. J.<br>
Cancer 43: 851-856 (1989)). Treatment with the HDAC inhibitors according to the invention caused<br>
a significant reduction in tumor weight and volume relative to controls treated with vehicle only (i.e.,<br>
no HDAC inhibitor). In addition, the level of histone acetylation when measured was significantly<br>
elevated relative to controls. Data for selected compounds are presented in Table 6. FIG. 1 shows<br>
the full experimental results for compound 106, which inhibits tumor growth by 80%. Figs. 2-10<br>
show the results of additional compounds tested.<br><br><br><br>
Combined Antineoplastic Effect of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors and Histone Deacetylase<br>
Antisense Oligonucleotides on Tumor Cells In Vivo<br>
[0398] The purpose of this example is to illustrate the ability of the combined use of a histone<br>
deacetylase inhibitor of the invention and a histone deacetylase antisense oligonucleotide to enhance<br>
inhibition of tumor growth in a mammal. Preferably, the antisense oligonucleotide and the HDAC<br>
inhibitor inhibit the expression and activity of the same histone deacetylase.<br>
[0399] As described in Example 126, mice bearing implanted HCT116 tumors (mean volume<br>
100 mm3) are treated daily with saline preparations containing from about 0.1 mg to about 30 mg<br>
per kg body weight of histone deacetylase antisense oligonucleotide. A second group of mice is<br>
treated daily with pharmaceutically acceptable preparations containing from about 0.01 mg to about<br>
5 mg per kg body weight of HDAC inhibitor.<br>
[0400] Some mice receive both the antisense oligonucleotide and the HDAC inhibitor. Of these<br>
mice, one group may receive the antisense oligonucleotide and the HDAC inhibitor simultaneously<br>
intravenously via the tail vein. Another group may receive the antisense oligonucleotide via the tail<br>
vein, and the HDAC inhibitor subcutaneously. Yet another group may receive both the antisense<br>
oligonucleotide and the HDAC inhibitor subcutaneously. Control groups of mice are similarly<br>
established which receive no treatment [e.g., saline only), a mismatch antisense oligonucleotide only,<br>
a control compound that does not inhibit histone deacetylase activity, and a mismatch antisense<br>
oligonucleotide with a control compound.<br>
[0401] Tumor volume is measured with calipers. Treatment with the antisense oligonucleotide<br>
plus the histone deacetylase protein inhibitor according to the invention causes a significant<br>
reduction in tumor weight and volume relative to controls.<br><br>
