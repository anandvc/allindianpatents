RADIO ANTENNA IN THE FORM OF A TRANSMITTING ANTENNA OR A RECEIVING ANTENNA, AND RADIO MOBILE SYSTEM<br>
MOLETHERM HOLDING AG of DAMMSTRASSE 21,  CH-4502 SOLOTHURN, SWITZERLAND  SWISS Company<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
1-4-2003<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
1 <br>
Specification<br>
Radio antenna as a transmitting antenna or a receiving antenna and a mobile<br>
radio system<br>
This invention relates to a radio antenna as a transmitting antenna or receiving antenna according to the generic term of Claim 1, and to a mobile radio system according to the generic term of Claim 13.<br>
Radio frequencies for radio communication begin in a frequency range of a few kHz. For the transmission of radio broadcasts, for example, frequencies between 520 kHz and 1,605.5 kH are used in the medium wave range; in the short-wave range frequencies between 5.9 MHz and 26.1 MHz, and in the ultra-shortwave range between 87.5 MHz and 108 MHz. For the transmission of television broadcasts, frequencies between 124 MHz and 790 MHz are used.<br>
Ultra-high frequency ranges are used, among others, for mobile telephones with analog technology from 450 MHz to 465 MHz, and for the digital GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) from 890 MHz to 960 MHz and 1,710 MHz to 1,880 MHz. Wireless telephones operate in a frequency range above that, from 1,180 MHz to 1,900 MHz. These ultra-high frequencies allow the use of relatively small antennas and guarantee a comparatively reliable connection for mobile communication.<br><br><br><br>
2<br><br><br>
Directional microwave connections currently use frequencies between 2 GHz to 40 GHz.<br>
Radio frequencies are scarce resources and today, all reasonably usable frequencies, are practically occupied already. One permanent objective will thus be to better use these limited radio frequencies, available - through improvements in transmission engineering and improvements in modulation engineering for the highest possible rate of information transmission with a good transmission quality.<br>
Furthermore, with regard to radio systems, there is a general demand for a simple, low-cost design, as well as an environmentally sound and the most energy-saving operation. These requirements are to be taken into account especially for a mobile radio system with mobile telephones [cellular phones].<br>
A mobile radio system comprises, in a generally known manner, mobile stations (MS) as cell phones (cellular phones) for subscribers. Furthermore, a mobile radio system comprises base transceiver stations (BTS) each in one local area as a radio cell, with larger local areas divided into adjoining radio cells. The base transceiver stations handle radio traffic with the mobile stations. Several base transceiver stations (BTS) are allocated to one base station controller each (BSC) with which they are connected via data transfer and which control and coordinate the allocated base transceiver stations (BTS). Data transfer can here be done via copper lines or via radio, especially point-to-point radio systems.<br>
Furthermore, several base station controllers (BSC) are in turn allocated to one mobile radio switching center (MSC). Data transfer can here again be done either via lines or via point-to-point radio systems.<br>
3<br><br>
For a high level of information transmission, a plurality of different modulation and demodulation procedures is used, such as, for example, the transmission on many small channels of small bandwidth with frequency multiplexing and/or time multiplexing, where however - due to transmission inaccuracies and for safeguarding the informational contents - safety spacings must be maintained, and also especially frequency safety spacings.<br>
With standard antennas, the signal quality while transmitting and/or receiving can be negatively affected, among other things, due to antenna noise since they can be operated only to a limited extent in a frequency-selective manner and only with some sideband noise. This is one reason, among others, why the presently required safety spacings cannot be reduced at will.<br>
Especially for mobile telephones (cellular phones), there is a demand for a low-weight compact design and energy-saving operation. The presently relatively great weight and size of the mobile phones are essentially due to the battery and, among other things, due to the filters for improving the. signal quality.<br>
It is one objective of the invention to propose a simply designed radio antenna as a broadband antenna which covers a large utilizable radio frequency range and which can be operated in transmitting and receiving mode with a high frequency-selective precision. Another objective of the invention consists of proposing a mobile radio system with the use of such a radio antenna.<br>
The first objective is solved with the characteristics of Claim 1, and the second objective with the characteristics of Claim 13.<br>
Pursuant to Claim 1, the radio antenna is a planar antenna consisting of a carrier part, a coating applied thereto, and of two coating feeders.<br><br><br>
4<br><br>
The carrier part consists of an insulating material.<br>
The coating is composed of a coating material having the following composition:<br>
a.	48% to 65%     amount of substance of a basic substance,comprising<br>
■	36% to 46% amount of substance binding agent,<br>
■	12% to 22% amount of substance insulator,<br>
■   12% to 24% amount of substance dispersing agent,<br>
■	8% to 40% amount of substance distilled water<br>
and<br>
b.	35% to 52% amount of substance graphite,<br>
the composition of the binding agent being<br>
■	64% to 79%	amount of substance distilled water,<br>
■	4% to 6%	amount of substance sulfonated oil,<br>
■	0.16% to 0.24%   amount of substance phenols or 0.05% to 0.5% amount<br>
of substance benzisothiazolinone,<br>
■	17% to 22%	amount of substance casein,<br>
■	0.8% to 1.2%       amount of substance urea,<br>
■	2% to 6%	amount of substance alkaline thinning agent, and<br>
■	2.3% to 2.8%       amount of substance caprolactam.<br>
Similarly electrically active coating materials are known in connection with radiation heating systems where heating effects in matter are to be produced through  frequency emissions  in  the THz range  via  molecular resonance<br>
5<br><br>
phenomena.   In. contrast,  the  instant coating, material  of this  invention  is : especially designed for use in the - in turn - lower-frequency radio antenna range.<br>
The coating feeders are at least two spaced electrical conductors of good electrically conducting material, having an electrical connection to the coating being in the interstice.<br>
The coating feeders are connected with additional elements of the electromagnetic oscillating circuit, with electromagnetic waves being transmittable or receivable by means of the coating via its planar extension.<br>
For the application of a uniform coating, the binding agent comprises distilled water which makes the individual components mix well with each other. The sulfonated oil and, if necessary, a leveling agent are used as a solution mediator and effect a uniform distribution of the individual substances in the binding agent, as well as a good film formation of the coating material on the carrier part.<br>
The phenols or benzisothiazolinones contained in the binding agent will favor -already in small amounts - the addition of particles. Casein is to be considered a binding agent within the binding agent and causes the addition of the individual components within the binding agent. Urea is also used as a solution mediator in the binding agent and favors the uniform distribution of the individual components. Additionally, a thinning agent used for homogenization as well as caprolactam as a structural substance are contained in the binding agent.<br>
The basic substance comprises as a main component the binding agent to which the particles of the isolator will adhere. The dispersing agent facilitates<br>
6<br><br>
dispersing and thus the uniform distribution of the binding agent together with the particles of the isolating agent in the basic substance. The added graphite also adds with its individual particles to the binding agent, which already binds the insulator. Together with the insulator, a plurality of minutest electrical dipoles are thus being formed which are uniformly distributed in the coating material and thus in the finished coating applied. The arrangement principally presents a plurality of coupled, minutest harmonic and nonharmonic oscillators in the form of dipoles. Thus, a high degree of transmitting and receiving electromagnetic radiation results in the entire utilizable radio frequency range from a few KHz up to the GHz range with extremely high frequency selectivity.<br>
Due to the high frequency selectivity, practically no sideband noise is emitted. It is accordingly advantageously possible to reduce the frequency security spacings so that available frequency ranges are better utilizable and thus a higher rate of information is transmi.ttable. In terms of the technical side of the devices, filter equipment - especially active filters - can be saved or at least reduced. Since, moreover, a clean frequency signal, without noise is being emitted, the energy otherwise required for noise emission, as well as the energy for the operation of filters for filtering off such noise can be saved. Thus, especially with mobile telephones, it is possible to operate with lower power input, possibly with smaller batteries and a longer operating period per battery charge.<br>
The radio antenna in accordance with the invention surprisingly has a spherical emission characteristic without a pronounced directive efficiecy. This too can be used for a reduction of the operating energy. With mobile telephones, this will moreover advantageously result in an improvement of electromagnetic compatibility since a certain specified emission power is distributed to all spatial directions and thus a concentration of the radiation power on the user's head area will be avoided.<br>
7<br><br>
The radio antenna in accordance with the invention can advantageously be used with all radio installations and radio systems with the aforementioned benefits, such as for example in radio station or television operation since -due to the broadband range and the high frequency selectivity over the total bandwidth - practically all usable radio frequencies can be covered. Adjustments to different performances can simply be done through dimensional adjustments.<br>
Pursuant to Claim 2, the carrier part can be manufactured easily and at low cost from a sturdy electrically insulating plastic.<br>
Basically, the radio antenna or, respectively, the carrier part can have different forms since the antenna effect is caused by a plurality of dipoles contained in the coating. According to Claim 3, however, it is expedient to design the carrier part in the form of plates to thus form a planar antenna. Active coating can then be applied, depending on the conditions, on one and/or on both sides of the surface. Even such a planar antenna has a spherical emission characteristic. Here, the possible transmission and receiving power is essentially given due to the coating surface lying between the allocated coating feeders, with the layer gauge here having a lower influence which is, however, to be increased as well for higher performance.<br>
According to Claim 4, the carrier part can be an integrated component of a part of the outer wall of the housing, especially of a mobile station housing made of plastic - with an advantageously compact structure and simple manufacture thus being possible. Accordingly, it will no longer be required - as has been standard until now - to have a rod antenna protrude, for example, from a cellular phone housing.<br>
8<br><br>
For the coating, sulfonated oils can be used - such as, for example, sulfated olive oil, sulfated sesame oil or sulfated palm oil. According to Claim 5, however, sulfated ricinus oil is preferably used which is known as sulforicinate or as Turkey red oil. It is well suitable especially due to its interfacially active properties.<br>
According to Claim 6, phenols are preferably carbonized phenols produced by cracking which have a particular suitability for particle addition. Instead of phenols, benzisothiazolinone is preferably to be used.<br>
According to Claim 7, the thinning agent is a solvent based on aromatics and/or alcohol and/or ester and/or ketone, e.g. terpene.<br>
As an insulating agent, isolators known per se can be used. However, according to Claim 8, the isolating agent preferably is isolating soot. This soot is advantageously added already in grind condition with a very small particle size. Accordingly, this will favor the uniform distribution of the soot in the basic substance and thus the development of a plurality of electrical dipoles in the coating material.<br>
According to Claim 9, the dispersing agent - which facilitates the dispersal and thus the uniform distribution of the binding agent together with the particles of the insulator in the basic substance - is an organic, monomer and/or polymer substance.<br>
According to Claim .10, the coating material contains a thixotropic agent in a preferred form of embodiment. This thixotropic agent causes the coating material to have a viscous consistency, i.e. it can be easily brushed when applying it to the carrier part, and, on the other hand, in a quiescent condition, it will be so tough that no drops or tears will form on the surface. Accordingly,<br><br><br>
9<br><br>
precise contour application of the coating material on the carrier part will be possible.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to Claim 11, the coating feeders are parallel aligned copper foil strips, and the coating is applied, for providing an electrical connection, under or above the copper foil strips, or they are embedded in the coating. Thus, especially an inductive and/or capacitative coupling will be achieved.<br>
To protect the coating and/or the coating feeders against environmental effects, Claim 12 proposes to apply a protective layer thereon. This can be designed as a final covering layer of the coating or it can consist of a protective film known per se. The effect of the antenna will not be influenced by such a cover.<br>
A mobile radio system claimed by Claim 13 comprises mobile stations (MS) as cellular phones for subscribers and of base transceiver stations (BTS) in one area each as a radio cell which handles the radio traffic with the mobile stations (MS). Several base transceiver stations (BTS) are allocated to each one base station controller (BSC). Data communication can here be done via data lines or by radio. Several base station controllers. (BSC), in turn, are allocated to a mobile switching center (MSC), here again the data communication being conducted either via stationary lines or via radio, especially point-to-point radio systems.<br>
The above specified.radio antenna designs are particularly advantageous in combination with mobile stations (MS) in the manner of mobile telephones and cellular phones. Also, such radio antennas with larger dimensions and approximately the same benefits can be used with base transceiver stations<br>
10<br><br>
(BTS), base station controllers (BSC) and, as needed, with mobile switching centers (MSC).<br>
As already detailed, the' aforementioned specified radio antennas are, however, also utilizable with other radio systems, such as for example in radio or television operation, as well as in satellite communication traffic with excellent results.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail by means of a drawing.<br>
