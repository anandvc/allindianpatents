Title Of Invention<br>
COMPRESSOR WITH FORTIFIED PISTON CHANNEL<br>
Field Of The invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an apparatus for generating<br>
compressed fluid. More specifically, the invention relates to a compressor<br>
that limits deformation and excessive heating of its piston channels.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
[0002] As is well known, various parts of certain vehicles require the<br>
use of compressed fluid, such as compressed air, for their operation. For<br>
example, the brake systems of trucks and other large vehicles often use<br>
compressed air to bias various braking mechanisms, such as spring-based<br>
actuators, into braking and non-braking positions.<br>
[0003] Accordingly, piston compressors are generally known in the art<br>
for generating this compressed fluid. These compressors typically employ a<br>
cylinder block with a plurality of piston channels. A plurality of pistons are<br>
slidably disposed in the piston channels and are coupled to some mechanism,<br>
such as a crankshaft, for causing them to reciprocate back and forth within the<br>
piston channels, thereby alternately creating suction and compression<br>
 <br>
-2-<br>
slidably disposed in the piston channels and are coupled to some mechanism,<br>
such as a crankshaft, for causing them to reciprocate back and forth within the<br>
piston channels, thereby alternately creating suction and compression<br>
strokes. As the pistons reciprocate within the piston channels of the cylinder<br>
block, they alternately draw fluid to be compressed into the channels, and<br>
subsequently compress and discharge this fluid.<br>
[0005] In order to control the introduction and discharge of fluid to and<br>
from the piston channels, these compressors also typically include a<br>
compressor head having inlet and outlet ports, as well as inflow and outflow<br>
channels connecting the ports to the piston channels. Additionally, the<br>
compressor heads often include valves, or else separate valve plates are<br>
disposed between the compressor head and the cylinder block having such<br>
valves, which regulate the inflow and outflow of the fluid. These valves permit<br>
the piston channels to communicate with the inlet and outlet channels, and<br>
ultimately, the inlet and outlet ports, in the compressor head.<br>
[0006] However, one problem with these compressors is that the walls<br>
of the piston channels will sometimes become distorted during assembly of<br>
the compressor. As previously noted, a cylinder head is typically mounted to<br>
the cylinder block by a set of fasteners, usually by inserting a series of bolts<br>
through the cylinder head and into threaded openings in the cylinder block.<br>
As the head and the block are clamped together by tightening the bolts, the<br>
clamping force will often distort the walls of the piston channels adjacent<br>
 <br>
-3-<br>
thereto. Uneven application of the tightening forces to the various bolts<br>
positioned around the block can further exacerbate this distortion.<br>
Additionally, the channel wall with which the piston makes contact as it slides<br>
along the channel is often a liner placed within a cylinder bore, which is<br>
typically even more prone to distortion.<br>
[0007] Distortion of the piston channel walls is a serious problem, as it<br>
affects the seal between the piston and the channel wall. For example, often<br>
the pistons will include a set of compression rings coupled to the piston head,<br>
the annular shape of which engages the cylindrical shape of the piston<br>
channel and thereby prevents the passage of oil from the compressor to the<br>
fluid compression chambers above the piston head. If the channel wall<br>
becomes distorted, and thus, the channel wall is no longer cylindrical, the<br>
engagement between the compression rings and the channel wall is less than<br>
perfect. This loss of a continuous seal will result in leakage of oil into the<br>
compression chamber above the cylinder, which can contaminate the<br>
compressed fluid and can affect the components downstream of the<br>
compressor.   For example, often, an air dryer is used in conjunction with the<br>
compressor to remove moisture in the air being supplied by the compressor<br>
before it is supplied to the relevant parts of the vehicle. If oil leaks into the<br>
compression chamber above the piston head, this oil will contaminate the air<br>
dryer system when the compressed air is communicated to it. As another<br>
 <br>
-4-<br>
example, if the leaked oil-proceeds to the air control valves, it can prevent<br>
them from working properly.<br>
[0008] Similarly, the piston heads in these types of compressors are<br>
also commonly fitted with oil scraper rings that contact the walls of the piston<br>
channels. After oil has been deposited on the channel walls due to the<br>
exposure of those walls to the oil during the pistons' upward compression<br>
strokes, the oil scraper rings serve to scrape the oil off of the walls during the<br>
pistons' downward suction strokes, thereby helping to ensure that this oil does<br>
not ultimately end up in the compression chambers above the piston heads.<br>
However, when the piston channel walls become distorted, the scraper rings,<br>
much like the compression .rings, are effectively lifted off of the surface of the<br>
channel wall, thereby decreasing their ability to scrape the oil therefrom.<br>
[0009] A related problem that exists with these types of compressors is<br>
that, as the pistons slide within the piston channels, the continuous sliding<br>
contact made between part of the piston and the wall of the channel causes<br>
the channel wall to heat up. This increase in temperature causes the channel<br>
walls to be even more prone to distortion as a result of additional stresses<br>
placed on the channel walls by the clamping force of the bolts.<br>
[0010]     Another problem that results from these types of compressors<br>
is that, even if the heat resulting from the friction between the piston and the<br>
channel wall does not cause the channel wall to become deformed, it ends up<br>
 <br>
-5-<br>
heating the air that is being compressed at the top of the piston channel,<br>
which can lead to numerous problems. For example, as previously<br>
mentioned, an air dryer is often used in conjunction with the compressor to<br>
remove moisture in the air being supplied by the compressor to the relevant<br>
parts of the vehicle. Because the air is hotter, it is able to hold more water<br>
vapor, and therefore, the air dryer must work harder to remove the moisture.<br>
Another problem created by this additional heat is that it causes oil to be more<br>
prone to "coking up"—burning and leaving behind carbon deposits. Yet<br>
another problem caused by excessive amounts of very hot air is that<br>
components of the compressor, and downstream from the compressor, will<br>
tend to have a shorter life, in part because of contraction and expansion of<br>
those parts from unnecessary levels of heating and cooling.<br>
[0011] What is desired, therefore, is a piston compressor where the<br>
walls of the piston channels do not become easily deformed. What is further<br>
desired is a piston compressor where the walls of the piston channels do not<br>
become excessively hot.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
[0012]     Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a piston compressor in which the process of fastening the cylinder head to the<br>
cylinder block does not deform the piston channels.<br>
 <br>
-6-<br>
[0013] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a piston<br>
compressor that includes structural consistency along the length of the piston<br>
channel.<br>
[0014] It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
piston compressor that counteracts the heating effect of friction along the<br>
length of the friction producing surface.<br>

channel when the piston is in the highest position to at least the point of<br>
contact between the contact portion of the piston and the wall of the piston<br>
channel when the piston is in the lowest position.<br>

[0017] In yet another embodiment, the invention comprises a<br>

[0019] Figure 2 is front cross-sectional view of the compressor of<br>
Figure 1.<br>
Detailed Description Of The Drawings<br>
[0020] The basic components of one embodiment of a compressor 10<br>
in accordance with the invention are illustrated in Figure 1. As used in the<br>
description, the terms "top," "bottom," "above," "below," "over," "under,"<br>
"above," "beneath," "on top," "underneath," "up," "down," "upper," "lower,"<br>
"front," "rear," "back," "forward" and "backward" refer to the objects referenced<br>
when in the orientation illustrated in the drawings, which orientation is not<br>
necessary for achieving the objects of the invention.<br>
 <br>
-9-<br>
[0021] The compressor 10 includes a cylinder head 12 mounted to a<br>
cylinder block 14. In certain advantageous embodiments, a crankcase 16 is<br>
integrally formed with the cylinder block 14. A crankshaft 18 is disposed in<br>
the crankcase 16. The cylinder block 14 has at least one piston channel 20<br>
formed therein, and often, as illustrated in Figure 2, has a plurality of piston<br>
channels 20. A piston 22 is disposed in each piston channel 20 and is<br>
coupled to the crankshaft 18, which causes the pistons 22 to reciprocate back<br>
and forth within the channels 20 as it rotates.<br>
[0022] The pistons 22 are reciprocally displaceable within the channels<br>
20 in order to provide for suction and compression strokes. A space in the<br>
channels 20 above the pistons 22 is in fluid communication with the air<br>
system requiring the compressed fluid. During the downstroke of the piston<br>
22, air is drawn into the channel 20. During the subsequent upstroke of the<br>
piston 22, this air is compressed and then discharged from the channel 20. In<br>
order to regulate the entry and discharge of this air from the compression<br>
space above the pistons 22, the cylinder head 12, which typically includes an<br>
arrangement of inlet and outlet apertures, channels, and valves, is mounted<br>
adjacent the cylinder block 14.<br>
[0023] Each piston 22 has a piston head 24, which engages a wall 26<br>
of the piston channel 20. Usually, the channel wall 26 is cylindrical, and the<br>
piston head 24 engages the channel wall 26 via an annular member 30<br>
coupled to the piston head 24. In certain advantageous embodiments, the<br>
 <br>
-10-<br>
annular member 30 is a compression ring. In-some embodiments, a plurality<br>
of compression rings 30 are coupled to the piston head 24.<br>
[0024] The compression rings 30 directly contact the channel wall 26,<br>
which is integrally formed with the cylinder block 14. This can be created in<br>
any of various ways but is often accomplished by starting with a solid piece,<br>
such as an iron block, and boring or extruding piston channels therein.<br>
Alternatively, a cylinder block having cylindrical channels therein may simply<br>
be cast by a mold having that shape. Because this integral wall serves as the<br>
piston channel wall 26, there is much less likelihood that the shape of the<br>
piston channel 20—which corresponds to the shape of the annular<br>
compression rings 30—will become deformed than if a separate liner or<br>
casing where placed in a bore.<br>
[0025] The cylinder head 12 is mounted to the cylinder block 14 by at<br>
least one bolt 40. The bolts 40 extend from at least the highest point of<br>
contact between the compression ring 30 and the channel wall 26 (i.e., the<br>
position of the ring 30 when the piston 22 is in the highest position of its<br>
upstroke) to the lowest point of contact between the ring 30 and wall 26 (i.e.,<br>
the position of the ring 30 when the piston 22 is in the lowest position of its<br>
downstroke). In this way, the structural integrity of the block 14 adjacent the<br>
channel 20 remains consistent along the moving entire path of the ring 30,<br>
and the final tightening occurring at the bottom of the bolt 40 does not occur<br>
along this path.<br>
 <br>
-11 -<br>
  [0026] A cooling-chamber 50, which is typically a water jacket, is<br>
formed in the cylinder block 14. As in the case of the piston channels 20, the<br>
cooling chamber 50 can be created in any of various ways, including boring,<br>
extrusion, and casting. The cooling chamber 50 is positioned adjacent the<br>
piston channel 20 and, in certain advantageous embodiments, the chamber<br>
50 is encircles  the channel 20. Accordingly the chamber can be filled with a<br>
fluid, such as water, to help coo! the channel 20 as the wall 26 heats up due<br>
to the friction between the wall 26 and the compression rings 30 as the piston<br>
22 reciprocates back and forth within the piston channel 20.<br>
[0027] In some embodiments, the cooling chamber is located between<br>
the bolt 40 and the channel 20. Accordingly, the chamber 50 is closer, and<br>
therefore, better able to cool, the channel 20. Moreover, the bolt is further<br>
away from, and therefore, less likely to exert excessive force on, the channel<br>
20. Finally, the cooling chamber 50 is able to absorb any stress exerted in the<br>
direction of the channel 20 as a result of tightening of the bolt 40 before it<br>
affects the channel 20. In order to maximize the cooling effect on the wall 26<br>
and the insulating effect against the clamping force of the bolt 40, the cooling<br>
chamber 50, like the bolts 40, extends from at least the highest point of<br>
contact between the compression ring 30 and the channel wall 26 to the<br>
lowest point of contact between the ring 30 and wall 26. In this way, the entire<br>
path of the ring 30 can be effectively cooled by the fluid in the chamber 50.<br>
 <br>
-12-<br>
[0028] In certain advantageous embodiments, at least one oil scraper<br>
ring 32 is also coupled to the piston head 24. When the piston 22 slides<br>
upward in the channel 20 during a compression stroke, part of the wall 26<br>
becomes exposed to oil present in the crankcase 16, which can become<br>
deposited thereon. Accordingly, during the downward suction stroke of the<br>
piston 22,  the oil scraper ring 32 helps to scrape any oil remaining on the wall<br>
26 back down into the crankcase 16 before the compression rings 30 come<br>
into contact with the oil.<br>
[0029] Though the invention has been shown in connection with a<br>
reciprocating compressor, in other embodiments, the invention involves other<br>
types of compressors, such as swash plate compressors. In these<br>
embodiments, instead of a crankshaft to which the piston stems are coupled,<br>
a drive shaft is axially aligned with, and positioned in the center of, the<br>
compressor. The pistons are coupled to a swash plate, which is mounted to<br>
the drive shaft, thereby converting the rotational motion of the shaft into axial<br>
motion of the pistons, such as the design disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,439,857 to Koelzer and assigned to the assignee of the present application.<br>
As shown therein, is some embodiments, the swash plate includes a rotating<br>
portion (mounted to the shaft) coupled to a non-rotating portion (coupled to<br>
the pistons) via a bearing, and an actuator is provided for contacting the<br>
swash plate, such that the actuator, when in a first position, exerts a force on<br>
the swash plate appropriate to retain the swash plate in a position<br>
 <br>
-13-<br>
perpendicular to the shaft, such that the piston remains idle, and, when in a<br>
second position, exerts a force on the swash plate appropriate to pivot the<br>
swash plate, thereby causing reciprocal motion of the piston within the piston<br>
channel.<br>
[0030] Similarly, though the invention has been shown in conjunction<br>
with a standard reciprocating compressor, in other embodiments, the<br>
invention is employed with compressors that have separate pistons and piston<br>
channels located on opposite sides of the crankshaft, and thus, receive and<br>
discharge fluid from both ends of the compressor.<br>
[0031] It should be understood that the foregoing is illustrative and not<br>
limiting, and that obvious modifications may be made by those skilled in the<br>
art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, reference<br>
should be made primarily to the accompanying claims, rather than the<br>
foregoing specification, to determine the scope of the invention.<br>
