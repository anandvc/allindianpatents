				<td>Multi-line exhaust system having at least one<br>
measurement sensor, honeycomb body having a recess for<br>
at least one measurement sensor, and method for<br>
operating a multi-line exhaust system<br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-line exhaust<br>
system having at least one measurement sensor, to a<br>
honeycomb body having recesses for at least one<br>
measurement sensor, and to a method for operating a<br>
10 multi-line exhaust system.<br>
In many countries, the exhaust emissions from motor<br>
vehicles are presenting a problem for air quality, in<br>
particular in urban areas. In many countries, this has<br>
15 in recent years led to the stipulation of emission<br>
limits which the pollutant levels in the exhaust gas<br>
from motor vehicles may not exceed. These limits are<br>
complied with, inter alia, by the use of catalytic<br>
converters for converting pollutants. The emission<br>
20 limits are becoming ever more stringent, which means<br>
that increased outlay is required to convert the<br>
exhaust gas so as to increase the pollutant conversion<br>
rate. To reliably comply with the emission limits, it<br>
has become standard practice to determine<br>
25 characteristic values of the exhaust gas using<br>
measurement sensors, for example lambda sensors,<br>
temperature sensors or nitrogen oxide (NOX)<br>
concentration sensors.<br>
30 Predominantly, honeycomb bodies which have cavities<br>
that at least in part allow a fluid to flow through<br>
them are used as catalyst support bodies for converting<br>
the exhaust gas. These honeycomb bodies are<br>
predominantly produced from ceramic materials or<br>
35 metallic foils. A distinction is drawn in particular<br>
between two typical forms of metallic honeycomb bodies.<br>
An early form, of which DE 29 02 779 Al shows typical<br>
examples, is the helical form, in which substantially<br>
one smooth sheet-metal layer and one corrugated<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
sheet-metal layer are placed on top of one another and<br>
wound helically. In another form, the honeycomb body is<br>
built up from a multiplicity of alternately arranged<br>
smooth and corrugated or differently corrugated<br>
5 sheet-metal layers, with the sheet-metal layers<br>
initially forming one or more stacks which are<br>
intertwined. In the process, the ends of all the<br>
sheet-metal layers come to lie on the outer side and<br>
can be joined to a housing or tubular casing, forming<br>
10 numerous joins which increase the durability of the<br>
honeycomb body. Typical examples of these forms are<br>
described in EP 0 245 737 Bl or WO 90/03220. It has<br>
also long been known to equip the sheet-metal layers<br>
with additional structures in order to influence the<br>
15 flow and/or to realize cross-mixing between the<br>
individual flow passages. Typical examples of<br>
configurations of this type include WO 91/01178,<br>
WO 91/01807 and WO 90/08249. Finally, there are also<br>
honeycomb bodies in conical form, if appropriate also<br>
20 with further additional structures for influencing the<br>
flow. A honeycomb body of this type is described, for<br>
example, in WO 97/49905. Furthermore, it is also known<br>
to form a cut-out for a sensor, in particular for<br>
accommodating a lambda sensor, in a honeycomb body. One<br>
25 such example is described in DE 88 16 154 Ul.<br>
In the case of multi-line exhaust systems, i.e. exhaust<br>
systems in which the exhaust gas, at least in partial<br>
regions of the exhaust system, is routed within at<br>
30 least two separate systems, either a honeycomb body of<br>
this type has to be formed in each of the exhaust<br>
lines, or a honeycomb body having a plurality of flow<br>
regions is introduced into the exhaust system in such a<br>
way that each individual flow region is connected to an<br>
35 exhaust line. In this context it is known, in<br>
particular from DE 197 55 126 Al, to form a honeycomb<br>
body which has two flow regions which are concentric<br>
with respect to one another and are separated by an<br>
inner tube. EP 0 835 366 Bl proposes that the flow<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
regions are not separated by additional structural<br>
measures, such as an inner tube, but rather to separate<br>
the flow regions by virtue of a partition interacting<br>
with an end side of the honeycomb body in such a way<br>
5 that it forms a seal with the walls of the cavities of<br>
the passage.<br>
Stricter emission limits, in particular in connection<br>
with the 0BD2 (onboard diagnosis 2) concept, may in<br>
10 particular make it necessary to determine<br>
characteristic variables of the exhaust gas upstream<br>
and downstream of an exhaust gas conversion, in<br>
particular upstream and downstream of a honeycomb body.<br>
In particular in the case of multi-line, for example<br>
15 two-line exhaust systems, this entails a high level of<br>
outlay, since in this case it is necessary to use not<br>
just two measurement sensors, but rather a multiplicity<br>
of measurement sensors, which in addition to a high<br>
outlay on design in particular also leads to high<br>
20 production and maintenance costs. Moreover, the<br>
susceptibility of the system to faults also increases<br>
with the number of measurement sensors.<br>
Working on this basis, it is an object of the invention<br>
25 to propose a multi-line exhaust system which allows the<br>
monitoring of at least one characteristic variable of<br>
the exhaust gas in a plurality of exhaust lines with<br>
the minimum possible design outlay. Furthermore, it is<br>
an object of the invention to propose a corresponding<br>
30 honeycomb body and a corresponding method for operating<br>
a multi-line exhaust system.<br>
These objects are achieved by an exhaust system having<br>
the features of claim 1, a honeycomb body having the<br>
35 features of claim 11 and a method having the features<br>
of claim 14. Advantageous refinements form the subject<br>
matter of the respective dependent claims.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
The multi-line exhaust system according to the<br>
invention has at least two exhaust lines which are<br>
substantially separate from one another and at least<br>
one measurement sensor for measuring at least one<br>
5 characteristic variable of the exhaust gas, it being<br>
possible for at least one measurement sensor to be<br>
brought into contact with at least two exhaust lines.<br>
An exhaust system according to the invention<br>
10 advantageously allows one measurement sensor to be used<br>
to determine a characteristic variable in two or more<br>
exhaust lines. In a multi-line exhaust system/ in each<br>
case one exhaust line is operating, i.e. being supplied<br>
with exhaust gas, at any specific instant.<br>
15 Consequently, there is not really any time in which<br>
exhaust gas is flowing into more than one exhaust line.<br>
On account of the time resolution of the measured<br>
values from the measurement sensor that can be<br>
connected to a plurality of exhaust lines, this fact<br>
20 allows the measurement data delivered by the<br>
measurement sensor to be accurately assigned to the<br>
corresponding exhaust line. This is possible in a<br>
simple way, since on the one hand it is known which<br>
exhaust line is being fed with exhaust gas at what<br>
25 times, and on the other hand is possible to determine<br>
how long the exhaust gas needs to pass from the<br>
internal combustion engine to the measurement point at<br>
which the measurement sensor picks up the data. Given a<br>
sufficiently good time resolution of the sensor, it is<br>
3 0 therefore possible for the measurement data from the<br>
measurement sensor to be assigned to one exhaust line.<br>
Consequently, just one measurement sensor at a<br>
measurement point can be used to determine a<br>
characteristic variable, such as for example the<br>
35 relative oxygen content, an NOX content, a hydrocarbon<br>
(HC) content, or also the temperature of the exhaust<br>
gas, in a plurality of exhaust lines, and consequently<br>
there is no need to incur the cost of forming further<br>
measurement sensors. Moreover, the exhaust system<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
becomes simpler to produce, since fewer receiving parts<br>
for measurement sensors, which in any case represent<br>
potential sources of faults, for example with regard to<br>
the leaktightness of the system, have to be formed.<br>
5 Furthermore, the reliability is increased not only with<br>
regard to the leaktightness of the system but also by<br>
virtue of the fact that fewer measurement sensors have<br>
to be formed, and consequently the risk of a<br>
measurement sensor failing overall is reduced for the<br>
10 same quantity of data recorded by the measurement<br>
sensors.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the<br>
exhaust system according to the invention, at least one<br>
15 honeycomb body having a first end face, a second end<br>
face and having cavities which extend between these end<br>
faces and at least in part allow a fluid to flow<br>
through them is formed in the at least two exhaust<br>
lines. In this context, it is particularly preferable<br>
20 to form a honeycomb body having at least two flow<br>
regions which are closed off in an at least<br>
approximately gastight manner with respect to one<br>
another, in which case at least a first flow region is<br>
connected to a first exhaust line and a second flow<br>
25 region is connected to a second exhaust line, and the<br>
exhaust lines are separated from one another by first<br>
separating means and the flow regions are separated<br>
from one another by second separating means.<br>
30 This advantageously allows the catalytic conversion of<br>
pollutants in the exhaust gas in multi-line exhaust<br>
systems in a single honeycomb body which has various<br>
flow regions. This can be achieved, for example, by<br>
second separating means being formed as additional<br>
35 components which pass through the whole of the<br>
honeycomb body in the axial direction and therefore<br>
ensure that the flow regions are separated. By way of<br>
example, it is possible to form concentric flow regions<br>
in which the second separating means form a cylindrical<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
intermediate tube. A further example is for a honeycomb<br>
body to be constructed from two semi-cylindrical<br>
half-shells, the flank of which is delimited by a wall.<br>
It is also possible for the flow regions to be<br>
5 separated without additional structural measures, for<br>
example by suitable connection means interacting with<br>
the honeycomb body in the form of a labyrinth seal.<br>
Furthermore, the second separating means may also<br>
10 comprise the walls of the cavities themselves, if<br>
suitable connection means ensure that a type of<br>
labyrinth seal is formed. This can be ensured, for<br>
example, by forming a slot in the end face of the<br>
honeycomb body so as to interact with a corresponding <br>
15 connection means.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the<br>
exhaust system, at least one measurement sensor is<br>
formed in the first separating means, preferably in the<br>
20 vicinity of an end face of the at least one honeycomb<br>
body.<br>
The first separating means may, for example, comprise a<br>
common wall, into which a measurement sensor has been<br>
25 introduced and which separates two or more exhaust<br>
lines. If just one honeycomb body is formed for a<br>
plurality of exhaust lines, it is advantageous for the<br>
at least one measurement sensor to be formed in the<br>
vicinity of an end face of the honeycomb body, since it<br>
30 is in this case possible to ensure without major<br>
structural outlay that the exhaust gas from a plurality<br>
of exhaust lines can be brought into contact with the<br>
measurement sensor.<br>
3 5 According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the exhaust system according to the invention, at least<br>
one measurement sensor is formed in the second<br>
separating means, preferably in the vicinity of an end<br>
face of the at least one honeycomb body.<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
It is advantageous for at least one measurement sensor<br>
to be formed in the second separating means, since it<br>
is in this way easy for the measurement sensor to be<br>
5 brought into contact with the exhaust gas in a<br>
plurality of exhaust lines. Forming the at least one<br>
measurement sensor in the vicinity of an end face of<br>
the honeycomb body in this way can advantageously be<br>
used to determine a characteristic variable of the<br>
10 exhaust gas substantially before and/or after the<br>
catalytic conversion.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the exhaust system, the at least one measurement sensor<br>
15 is formed at a predeterminable minimum distance from an<br>
end face of the honeycomb body.<br>
In particular if the characteristic variable to be<br>
determined is the concentration of a constituent of the<br>
2	0 exhaust gas that is to be stored in the honeycomb body,<br>
such as for example nitrogen oxide (NOX) , it is<br>
advantageous to provide a predeterminable minimum<br>
distance between the at least one measurement sensor<br>
and an end face, in particular the end face on the gas<br>
25 outlet side, of the honeycomb body. If the minimum<br>
distance is selected appropriately, it is thus possible<br>
to ensure that this constituent does not break through<br>
the honeycomb body serving as a store even i f the<br>
measurement sensor detects a predeterminable minimum<br>
3	0 concentration of the exhaust gas constituent.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the exhaust system according to the invention, at least<br>
one measurement sensor is a lambda sensor.<br>
35<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the exhaust system according to the invention, at least<br>
one measurement sensor is a nitrogen oxide (NOX)<br>
concentration sensor.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the exhaust system according to the invention, at least<br>
one measurement sensor is a temperature sensor.<br>
5<br>
It is also possible for the types of measurement<br>
sensors mentioned above to be combined, so that, for<br>
example, a first measurement sensor is designed as a<br>
lambda sensor and a second measurement sensor is<br>
10 designed as a temperature sensor. It is also possible<br>
and within the scope of the invention to form combined<br>
measurement sensors which operate, for example, as a<br>
lambda sensor and at the same time determine the NOX<br>
concentration and/or the temperature. It is also<br>
15 possible and within the scope of the invention to form<br>
any other type of measurement sensor which determines a<br>
characteristic variable of the exhaust gas.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
20 the exhaust system according to the invention, a first<br>
measurement sensor is formed in the first separating<br>
means upstream of the at least one honeycomb body, as<br>
seen in the direction of flow, or in the second<br>
separating means at a first distance from the first end<br>
25 face, and a second measurement sensor is formed in the<br>
first separating means downstream of the at least one<br>
honeycomb body as seen in the direction of flow, or in<br>
the second separating means at a second distance from<br>
the second end face.<br>
30<br>
According to a further aspect of the inventive concept,<br>
a honeycomb body having a first end face, a second end<br>
face and cavities which extend between the first end<br>
face and the second end face and at least in part allow<br>
3 5 a fluid to flow through them, in particular for use as<br>
a catalyst support body in a multi-line exhaust system<br>
of an internal combustion engine, second separating<br>
means separating a first flow region from a second flow<br>
region of the honeycomb body, is characterized in that<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
at least one recess for a measurement sensor is formed<br>
in the region of the second separating means,' so that<br>
both an exhaust gas which is flowing in the first flow<br>
region and an exhaust gas which is flowing in the<br>
5 second flow region come into contact with a measurement<br>
sensor that can be introduced into the recess.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the<br>
honeycomb body according to the invention, at least one<br>
10 measurement sensor has been introduced into the at<br>
least one recess.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the honeycomb body according to the invention, the at<br>
15 least one measurement sensor is a lambda(X) sensor, a<br>
nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentration sensor and/or a<br>
temperature sensor.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to form one or more<br>
20 measurement sensors which are combined X sensors, NOx<br>
concentration sensors and/or temperature sensors. It is<br>
preferable for measurement sensors to be formed in<br>
corresponding recesses in the vicinity of the gas inlet<br>
side and in the vicinity of the gas outlet side.<br>
25<br>
A further aspect of the concept of the invention<br>
proposes a method for operating a multi-line exhaust<br>
system of an internal combustion engine using at least<br>
two measurement sensors for measuring at least one<br>
30 characteristic variable of the exhaust gas at in each<br>
case one measurement point, in which a characteristic<br>
variable of the exhaust gas in at least two exhaust<br>
lines is measured using at least one measurement<br>
sensor.<br>
35<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the method according to the invention, the oxygen/fuel<br>
ratio, the nitrogen oxide content and/or the<br>
temperature of the exhaust gas is determined.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of<br>
the method, the measurement data of the measurement<br>
sensors are assigned to an exhaust line on the basis of<br>
5 the operating data of the internal combustion engine<br>
and the state data of the exhaust system.<br>
The ignition times of those cylinders from which the<br>
exhaust gas is passed into a defined exhaust line can<br>
10 be determined in a simple manner from the operating<br>
data of the internal combustion engine, so that<br>
consequently it is known which exhaust line has exhaust<br>
gas flowing through it at what times. The time which it<br>
takes for the exhaust gas to reach the measurement<br>
15 sensor, and therefore also the time at which the<br>
exhaust gas in a defined exhaust line is in contact<br>
with the measurement sensor, can be determined from the<br>
state data of the exhaust system, for example length<br>
and shape of the exhaust lines and the corresponding<br>
2	0 operating data of the internal combustion engine, so<br>
that the data recorded by the measurement sensor can be<br>
assigned to this exhaust line. In this case, the<br>
abovementioned time which it takes for the exhaust gas<br>
to reach the measurement sensors can be determined<br>
25 empirically or analytically. It is thus possible in a<br>
simple way for a measurement sensor tc be used to<br>
determine a characteristic variable of the exhaust gas<br>
in two or more exhaust lines.<br>
3	0 All the advantages which have been described for the<br>
exhaust system according to the invention equally apply<br>
to the honeycomb body according to the invention and<br>
the method according to the invention, and vice versa.<br>
3 5 Further advantages and particularly preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention are described below with<br>
reference to the drawing, without the invention being<br>
restricted to these embodiments. In the drawing:<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
Fig. 1 shows an end-side view of a honeycomb body<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows an excerpt from a honeycomb body; and<br>
5<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts a section through an<br>
exhaust system according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an end-side view of a honeycomb body 1<br>
10 according to the invention. The honeycomb body 1<br>
comprises a honeycomb structure 2 which is secured in a<br>
tubular casing 3. The honeycomb structure 2 is built up<br>
from substantially smooth sheet-metal layers 4 and<br>
structured sheet-metal layers 5, which form passages 6<br>
15 through which an exhaust gas can flow, as shown in<br>
detail in Fig. 2. The structured sheet-metal layers 5<br>
are not shown in Fig. 1, for the sake of clarity.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the honeycomb<br>
2	0 structure 2 is formed by alternately stacking smooth<br>
sheet-metal layers 4 and structured sheet-metal layers<br>
5 and then intertwining two stacks in the same<br>
direction. However, any other form of a metallic or<br>
ceramic honeycomb body 1 is also possible and within<br>
25 the scope of the invention.<br>
A first part 8 of a first separating means 9, which<br>
separates two exhaust lines 10, 11 from one another, is<br>
fitted to a first end face 7 of the honeycomb body 1.<br>
3	0 The exhaust gas from defined cylinders of an internal<br>
combustion engine is passed through each of the exhaust<br>
lines 10, 11. In this exemplary embodiment, the first<br>
part 8 is designed as a metal sheet which bears against<br>
the end face 7. The honeycomb body 1 is divided into a<br>
35 first flow region 12 and a second flow region 13, which<br>
form part of different exhaust lines 10, 11 of an<br>
exhaust system. The two flow regions 12, 13 are<br>
separated by second separating means 14, which in the<br>
present exemplary embodiment are formed by the walls of<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
the passages 6 which are formed by the smooth<br>
sheet-metal layers 4 and the structured sheet-metal<br>
layers 5 and lie downstream of the first part .8 of the<br>
first separating means 9. Since the first part 8 is not<br>
5 entirely congruent with the walls of the corresponding<br>
passages 6, slight leaks may occur between the first<br>
flow region 12 and the second flow region 13, but these<br>
leaks are insignificant, since the exhaust gas is<br>
converted in both flow regions 12, 13, and consequently<br>
10 there is no loss of unconverted exhaust gas, i.e.<br>
undesirable pollutant emissions. To increase the<br>
leaktightness, the first end face 7 can be slotted in<br>
such a way that, by interacting with the first part 8<br>
of the first separating means 9, which engages therein,<br>
15 a type of labyrinth seal is formed.<br>
A first measurement sensor 15, which is located axially<br>
upstream of the first end face 7 of the honeycomb body<br>
1, as can be seen from Fig. 3, and therefore upstream<br>
20 of the honeycomb body 1, is formed within the first<br>
part 8 of the first separating means 9. The first<br>
measurement sensor 15 is therefore in contact both with<br>
exhaust gas which flows within the first exhaust line<br>
10 and with exhaust gas which flows within the second<br>
25 exhaust line 11, so that just one measurement sensor 15<br>
can be used to determine a characteristic variable of<br>
the exhaust gas in a plurality of exhaust lines 10, 11<br>
prior to catalytic conversion in the honeycomb body 1.<br>
30 The measurement data delivered by the measurement<br>
sensor 15 are assigned to the exhaust lines 10, 11, for<br>
example, by virtue of the fact that it is known which<br>
exhaust line 10, 11 is being supplied with exhaust gas<br>
at what time. The operating data of the internal<br>
35 combustion engine can also be used to determine the<br>
mean flow rate at which the exhaust gas is flowing<br>
through the respective exhaust line 10, 11. Since the<br>
length and geometry of the exhaust lines 10, 11 are<br>
known, however, the instant at which the first<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
measurement sensor 15 picks up data can easily be<br>
correlated with the time which it takes for the exhaust<br>
gas to reach the measurement point at which the first<br>
measurement sensor 15 picks up the data, so that in<br>
5 this way it is also known which of the exhaust lines<br>
10, 11 the data of the first measurement sensor 15 can<br>
be assigned to at a specific instant.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, there is at least one<br>
10 second measurement sensor 16, which in the present<br>
exemplary embodiment is formed within the second<br>
separating means 14. The second separating means 14 are<br>
merely indicated as a dashed line, in order to show<br>
that in the present exemplary embodiment the second<br>
15 separating means do not comprise an additional,<br>
separate component, but rather are formed from the<br>
walls of the passages 6 located downstream or between<br>
the first parts 8 of the first separating means 9.<br>
However, it is equally possible for second separating<br>
2	0 means 14 to be formed as an additional component, for<br>
example as a partition or separating tube if the flow<br>
regions 12, 13 are arranged concentrically, and these<br>
options are likewise within the scope of the invention.<br>
In this context, it should be noted that in the case of<br>
25 concentric second separating means, the at least one<br>
measurement sensor 15, 16 also has an annular cross<br>
sectiqn.<br>
The second measurement sensor 16 can pick up data both<br>
3	0 from the first flow region 12, which is part of the<br>
first exhaust line 10, and from the second flow region<br>
13, which is part of the second exhaust line 11. The<br>
data from the second measurement sensor 16 can be<br>
assigned to the exhaust line 10, 11 in the same way as<br>
3 5 what has been outlined above in connection with the<br>
first measurement sensor 15, although it is also<br>
possible to employ further components, such as for<br>
example flow sensors or the like, to assign the data<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
from the two measurement sensors 15, 16 to the exhaust<br>
lines 10, 11.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the first measurement<br>
5 sensor 15 is formed in the first separating means 9 and<br>
the second measurement sensor 16 is formed in the<br>
second separating means 14. It is equally possible and<br>
within the scope of the invention for both measurement<br>
sensors 15, 16 to be formed in the first separating<br>
10 means 9 or the second separating means 14, or for the<br>
first measurement sensor 15 to be formed in the second<br>
separating means 14 and the second measurement sensor<br>
16	to be formed in the first separating means 9. If the<br>
measurement sensor(s) 15, 16 is/are formed in the first<br>
15 separating means 9, it is irrelevant whether it/they<br>
is/are formed in the first part 8 or in the partition<br>
17	between the exhaust lines 10, 11.<br>
The measurement sensors 15, 16 may, for example, be<br>
20 lambda(X) sensors, temperature sensors and/or nitrogen<br>
oxide (NOx) concentration sensors. Each of the<br>
measurement sensors 15, 16 may also form a combination<br>
of these and/or other sensors.<br>
25 Depending on the particular application, it may be<br>
necessary for the honeycomb body 1 to be designed as a<br>
store for one or more constituents of the exhaust gas,<br>
for example as a NOx store which can be regenerated. In<br>
particular in this case, it may be advantageous for the<br>
30 second measurement sensor 16 to be formed at a<br>
predeterminable minimum distance 18 from the second,<br>
gas-outlet-side, end face 19. In this case,<br>
regeneration of the NOx store can be initiated in the<br>
event of a minimum concentration being exceeded at the<br>
35 second measurement sensor 16 without NOx already having<br>
escaped through the second end face 19 of the honeycomb<br>
body 1.<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
An exhaust system according to the invention has at<br>
least one measurement sensor 15, 16 for determining at<br>
least one characteristic variable of the exhaust gas in<br>
two or more different exhaust lines 10, 11, so that the<br>
5 design outlay required to monitor the at least one<br>
characteristic variable in a plurality of exhaust lines<br>
10, 11 can be significantly reduced compared to a<br>
measurement sensor 15, 16 being formed in each exhaust<br>
line 10, 11.<br><br>
