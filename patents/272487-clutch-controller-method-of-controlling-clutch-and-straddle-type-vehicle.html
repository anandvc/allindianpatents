BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
controlling an engagement state of a clutch by actuating<br>
an actuator.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a vehicle with a semi-automatic transmission that<br>
actuates an actuator to engage or disengage a clutch, the<br>
clutch is provided with a drive-side member (for example,<br>
friction disk), which rotates upon receipt of rotational<br>
force from a driving source, and a driven-side member (for<br>
example, clutch disk), which is pressed by the drive-side<br>
member to operate in conjunction with the drive-side<br>
member. The vehicle controls the engagement state of the<br>
clutch based on a difference in rotational speed between<br>
the drive-side member and the driven-side member (for<br>
example, JP-A-2001-146930). Generally, such vehicles<br>
1<br><br>
control or gradually reduce the difference ' in rotational<br>
speed between the drive-side member and the driven-side<br>
member during engaging operation of the clutch.<br>
The aforementioned related vehicle controls the<br>
engagement state of the clutch based on the difference in<br>
rotational speed during engaging operation of the clutch.<br>
This, however, can prevent appropriate torque from being<br>
constantly transmitted from the drive-side member to a<br>
downstream mechanism including the driven-side member, and<br>
thus can impair riding comfort. For example, when a half-<br>
clutch state is discontinued, torque transmitted to the<br>
driven-side member increases sharply, providing shocks to<br>
the vehicle. In order to solve such a problem, another<br>
control method has been also proposed, in which a half-<br>
clutch state is maintained until the difference in<br>
rotational speed is almost zero. However, such a control<br>
method can result in insufficient torque being<br>
continuously transmitted to the driven-side member over a<br>
long time period. This case causes the vehicle to<br>
decelerate excessively.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made in view of the foregoing<br>
problems, and an object of the invention is to provide a<br>
clutch controller, a method of controlling a clutch, and a<br>
2<br><br>
straddle-type vehicle, which allow an improvement in<br>
riding comfort of a vehicle when the clutch is engaged.<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present<br>
invention is directed to a clutch controller for<br>
controlling an engagement state of a clutch by actuating<br>
an actuator, the clutch controller including: a target<br>
torque obtaining means for obtaining torque that is<br>
supposed to be transmitted from a drive-side member of the<br>
clutch to a downstream mechanism in a torque transmission<br>
path as target transmission torque, the downstream<br>
mechanism including a driven-side member of the clutch;<br>
and a control means for actuating the actuator based on<br>
the target transmission torque. The target torque<br>
obtaining means estimates torque to be transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member to the downstream mechanism in the<br>
torque transmission path after the drive-side member and<br>
the driven-side member are completely engaged, and obtains<br>
the estimated torque as the target transmission torque.<br>
In addition, in order to solve the foregoing problems,<br>
the present invention is directed to a straddle-type<br>
vehicle including: a power source; a clutch for<br>
transmitting torque of the power source or interrupting<br>
transmission of the torque; and a clutch controller for<br>
controlling an engagement state of the clutch by actuating<br>
an actuator. The clutch controller includes: a target<br>
3<br><br>
torque obtaining means for obtaining torque that is<br>
supposed to be transmitted from a drive-side member of the<br>
clutch to a downstream mechanism in a torque transmission<br>
path as target transmission torque, the downstream<br>
mechanism including a driven-side member of the clutch;<br>
and a control means for actuating the actuator based on<br>
the target transmission torque. The target torque<br>
obtaining means estimates torque to be transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member to the downstream mechanism in the<br>
torque transmission path after the drive-side member and<br>
the driven-side member are completely engaged, and obtains<br>
the estimated torque as the target transmission torque.<br>
Further, in order to solve the foregoing problems, the<br>
present invention is directed to a method of controlling a<br>
clutch for controlling an engagement state of the clutch<br>
by actuating an actuator, the method including the steps<br>
of: estimating torque to be transmitted from a drive-side<br>
member of the clutch to a downstream mechanism in a torque<br>
transmission path after the drive-side member and a<br>
driven-side member of the clutch are completely engaged,<br>
the downstream mechanism including the driven-side member;<br>
obtaining the estimated torque as target transmission<br>
torque or torque that is supposed to be transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member to the downstream mechanism in the<br>
torque transmission path; and actuating the actuator based<br>
4<br><br>
on the target transmission torque.<br>
The present invention allows to minimize abrupt<br>
changes in torque transmitted via the clutch at the time<br>
of completely engaging the clutch, and thus to improve the<br>
riding comfort of the vehicle when the clutch is engaged.<br>
The straddle-type vehicle may be a motorcycle (including a<br>
scooter), a four-wheeled buggy, a snowmobile or a two-<br>
wheeled electric vehicle, for example.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A description will hereinafter be made of an<br>
embodiment of the present invention with reference to the<br>
drawings. FIG. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle 1<br>
provided with a clutch controller 10 as an example of the<br>
6<br><br>
embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 is a schematic view<br>
of a mechanism provided on a torque transmission path of<br>
the motorcycle 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2, the motorcycle 1 is<br>
provided not only with the clutch controller 10, but also<br>
with an engine 30, a primary speed reducing mechanism 36,<br>
a clutch 40, a secondary speed reducing mechanism 50, a<br>
front wheel 2, and a rear wheel 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the front wheel 2 is located at a<br>
front part of a vehicle body, and rotatably supported by<br>
lower ends of a front fork 4 extending vertically.<br>
Handlebars 5 are connected to the top of the front fork 4.<br>
An accelerator grip 5a to be gripped by a rider is mounted<br>
to the right end of the handlebars 5. The accelerator<br>
grip 5a is connected to a throttle valve 37a provided in a<br>
throttle body 37 (see FIG. 2). The throttle valve 37a is<br>
rotated according to rider's accelerator operation, and a<br>
certain amount of air, which depends on the rotation<br>
amount of the throttle valve 37a, is delivered to the<br>
engine 30. The engine 30 outputs torque according to the<br>
rider's accelerator operation. The motorcycle 1 may be<br>
provided with an electronically-controlled throttle<br>
device. In this case, there are provided a sensor for<br>
detecting a rider's accelerator operation and an actuator<br>
for rotating the throttle valve 37a according to the<br>
7<br><br>
accelerator operation detected by the sensor.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the engine 30 has a cylinder 31, a<br>
piston 32, an intake port 33, and a crankshaft 34. The<br>
throttle body 37 is connected to the intake port 33 via an<br>
intake pipe 35.<br>
The throttle valve 37a is placed within an intake<br>
passage of the throttle body 37. As described above, the<br>
throttle valve 37a rotates according to the rider's<br>
accelerator operation, and a certain amount of air, which<br>
depends on the accelerator operation, is delivered from<br>
the throttle body 37 to the engine 30. Mixture of air and<br>
fuel supplied from a fuel supplier (not shown, for<br>
example, injector or carburetor) is delivered to an<br>
interior of the cylinder 31. Burning the air-fuel mixture<br>
causes the piston 32 to reciprocate within the cylinder<br>
31. The reciprocating motion of the piston 32 is<br>
converted into rotating motion by the crankshaft 34,<br>
thereby outputting torque from the engine 30.<br>
The primary speed reducing mechanism 36 includes: a<br>
drive-side primary reduction gear 36a, which operates in<br>
conjunction with the crankshaft 34; and a driven-side<br>
primary reduction gear 36b, which meshes with the primary<br>
reduction gear 36a. The primary speed reducing mechanism<br>
36 decelerates the rotation of the engine 30 at a<br>
predetermined ratio.<br>
8<br><br>
The clutch 40 is a friction clutch, for example, and<br>
is provided with a drive-side member 41 and a driven-side<br>
member 42. The drive-side member 41 includes a friction<br>
disk, for example, and rotates together with the drive-<br>
side primary reduction gear 36a. The driven-side member<br>
42 includes a clutch disk, for example, and rotates<br>
together with a main shaft 52. The drive-side member 41<br>
and the driven-side member 42 are pressed against each<br>
other by elastic force of a clutch spring 44 at the time<br>
of engaging the clutch 40, so that the torque of the<br>
engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to<br>
the driven-side member 42. Also, when the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged, the driven-side member 42 is moved away from<br>
the drive-side member 41, so that torque transmission from<br>
the drive-side member 41 is interrupted. The clutch 40 is<br>
engaged or disengaged by a clutch actuator 14 provided in<br>
the clutch controller 10. More specifically, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 presses a push rod 43, provided interior of<br>
the main shaft 52, in the axial direction against the<br>
elastic force of the clutch spring 44 or release the<br>
pressed push rod 43, so that the driven-side member 42 is<br>
moved away from the drive-side member 41 to disengage the<br>
clutch 40 or so that the driven-side member 42 is pressed<br>
against the drive-side member 41 to engage the clutch 40.<br>
Control of the clutch 40 by means of the clutch controller<br>
9<br><br>
10 will be discussed in details later.<br>
The secondary speed reducing mechanism 50 is designed<br>
to decelerate the rotation of the main shaft 52 and<br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to an axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. In this example, the secondary speed<br>
reducing mechanism 50 is provided with a gearbox 51 and a<br>
transmission mechanism 57. The gearbox 51 is a mechanism<br>
to change deceleration ratios, such as a constant-mesh<br>
gearbox and a selective-sliding gearbox.<br>
The gearbox 51 has on the main shaft 52 plural shift<br>
gears 53a (for example, first-speed gear, second-speed<br>
gear, third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 53b (for<br>
example, fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). Also, the<br>
gearbox 51 has on a countershaft 55 plural shift gears 54a<br>
(for example, first-speed gear, second-speed gear,<br>
third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 54b (for example,<br>
fifth-speed gear and sixth-speed gear). The shift gears<br>
53a are spline-connected to the main shaft 52 and operate<br>
in conjunction with the main shaft 52. The shift gears<br>
54a are provided such that they turn free to the<br>
countershaft 55, and mesh with the corresponding shift<br>
gears 53a, respectively. The shift gears 53b are provided<br>
such that they run idle with respect to the main shaft 52.<br>
The shift gears 54b mesh with the corresponding shift<br>
gears 53b, respectively, while being spline-connected to<br>
10<br><br>
the countershaft 55 to operate in conjunction with the<br>
countershaft 55. A pair of the meshing shift gears 53a,<br>
54a and a pair of the meshing shift gears 53b, 54b each<br>
have a different speed reduction ratio.<br>
The gearbox 51 is also provided with a gearshift<br>
mechanism 56. The gearshift mechanism 56 includes a shift<br>
fork and a shift drum, for example, and selectively moves<br>
the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b in the axial direction<br>
of the main shaft 52 or the countershaft 55. Then, the<br>
gearshift mechanism 56 causes the shift gears 53b, 54a,<br>
which are provided to run idle with respect to the<br>
corresponding shafts, to connect with the adjacent shift<br>
gears 53a, 54b, which operate in conjunction with the<br>
corresponding shafts. This changes the pairs of shift<br>
gears to transmit torque from the main shaft 52 to the<br>
countershaft 55. The gearshift mechanism 56 is actuated<br>
by power inputted from a shift actuator 16 to be discussed<br>
later.<br>
The transmission mechanism 57 is designed to<br>
decelerate the rotation of the countershaft 55 and<br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to the axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. In this example, the transmission mechanism<br>
57 includes: a drive-side member 57a (for example, drive-<br>
side sprocket), which operates in conjunction with the<br>
countershaft 55; a driven-side member 57b (for example,<br>
11<br><br>
driven-side sprocket), which operates in conjunction with<br>
the axle 3a; and a transmission member 57c (for example,<br>
chain), which transmits torque from the drive-side member<br>
57a to the driven-side member 57b.<br>
Torque outputted from the engine 30 is transmitted to<br>
the drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40 via the primary<br>
speed reducing mechanism 36. The torque transmitted to<br>
the drive-side member 41 is transmitted to the axle 3a of<br>
the rear wheel 3 via the driven-side member 42, the<br>
gearbox 51, and the transmission mechanism 57, in the case<br>
that the clutch 40 is engaged or the drive-side member 41<br>
and the driven-side member 42 contact each other, that is,<br>
the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state.<br>
Now, the clutch controller 10 is described. The<br>
motorcycle 1 is a semi-automatic vehicle which changes the<br>
shift gears of the gearbox 51 without the need for the<br>
rider to operate the clutch. The engagement state of the<br>
clutch 40 (stroke of the clutch 40) is controlled by the<br>
clutch controller 10. FIG. 3 is a block diagram<br>
illustrating a configuration of the clutch controller 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the clutch controller 10 is provided<br>
with a control unit 11, a storage unit 12, a clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 13, a clutch actuator 14, a shift<br>
actuator drive circuit 15, a shift actuator 16, an<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, an engine speed<br>
12<br><br>
detector 18, a vehicle speed detector 19, a gear position<br>
detector 21, a clutch position detector 22, and clutch<br>
rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b. The control unit 11<br>
is connected to a shift-up switch 9a and a shift-down<br>
switch 9b.<br>
The control unit 11 includes a central processing unit<br>
(CPU) , and actuates the clutch actuator 15 and the shift<br>
actuator 16 in accordance with programs stored in the<br>
storage unit 12 to control the engagement state of the<br>
clutch 40 and the speed reduction ratios of the gearbox<br>
51. The processing executed by the control unit 11 will<br>
be discussed in detail later.<br>
The storage unit 12 includes a nonvolatile memory and<br>
a volatile memory, and holds in advance the programs<br>
executed by the control unit 11. Additionally, the<br>
storage unit 12 holds tables and expressions to be used<br>
for the processing executed by the control unit 11. These<br>
tables and expressions will be discussed in detail later.<br>
The clutch actuator drive circuit 13 outputs electric<br>
power to drive the clutch actuator 14 in accordance with a<br>
signal inputted from the control unit 11. The clutch<br>
actuator 14 includes, for example, a motor and a power<br>
transmission mechanism (such as hydraulic path and wire),<br>
and is driven by receiving the electric power outputted<br>
from the clutch actuator drive circuit 13. In this<br>
13<br><br>
example, the clutch actuator 14 presses the push rod 43 or<br>
release the pressed push rod 43 to engage or disengage the<br>
clutch 40. More specifically, the clutch actuator 14 is<br>
provided that is capable of being actuated in the<br>
disengagement direction to disengage the clutch 40 by<br>
pressing the push rod 43 or in the engagement direction to<br>
engage the clutch 40 by releasing the pressed push rod 43.<br>
The clutch actuator 14 causes the clutch 40 to be in a<br>
half-clutch state in the process of the engaging operation<br>
in which the clutch 40, which has been disengaged, is<br>
engaged. When the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state,<br>
only part of the torque of the engine 30 is transmitted<br>
from the drive-side member 41 to the driven-side member<br>
42.<br>
The shift actuator drive circuit 15 outputs electric<br>
power to drive the shift actuator 16 in accordance with a<br>
signal inputted from the control unit 11. The shift<br>
actuator 16 includes, for example, a motor and a power<br>
transmission mechanism (such as hydraulic path and wire),<br>
and is driven by receiving the electric power outputted<br>
from the shift actuator drive circuit 15. The shift<br>
actuator 16 actuates the gearshift mechanism 56 of the<br>
gearbox 51 to change the pairs of shift gears to transmit<br>
toque from the main shaft 52 to the countershaft 55 in<br>
order to change the speed reduction ratios.<br>
14<br><br>
The accelerator operation detector 17 is designed to<br>
detect an amount of the accelerator operation by the rider<br>
(hereinafter referred to as accelerator displacement (for<br>
example, throttle opening)). Examples of the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17 are a throttle position sensor<br>
mounted to the throttle body 37 to detect a throttle<br>
opening and an accelerator position sensor mounted to the<br>
accelerator grip 5a to detect a rotation angle of the<br>
accelerator grip 5a. The accelerator operation detector<br>
17	outputs an electric signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to the accelerator displacement (hereinafter the<br>
electric signal is referred to as request torque signal).<br>
The control unit 11 detects the accelerator displacement<br>
by the rider based on the request torque signal.<br>
The engine speed detector 18 is designed to detect the<br>
rotational speed of the engine 30 (hereinafter referred to<br>
as engine speed). Examples of the engine speed detector<br>
18	are a crank angle sensor for outputting a pulse signal<br>
with a frequency according to the rotational speed of the<br>
crankshaft 34 or the primary reduction gears 36a, 36b and<br>
a tachogenerator for outputting a voltage signal according<br>
to the rotational speed thereof. The engine speed<br>
detector 18 outputs a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to the engine speed. The control unit 11<br>
calculates the engine speed based on the input signal.<br>
15<br><br>
The vehicle speed detector 19 is designed to detect a<br>
vehicle speed, and outputs a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to, for example, the rotational speed of the<br>
axle 3a of the rear wheel 3 or the countershaft 55<br>
(hereinafter the signal is referred to as vehicle speed<br>
signal). The control unit 11 calculates the vehicle speed<br>
based on the vehicle speed signal. The vehicle speed<br>
detector 19 may output a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to the rotational speed of the main shaft 52 as<br>
a vehicle speed signal. In this case, the control unit 11<br>
calculates the vehicle speed not only based on the input<br>
vehicle speed signal, but also based on the speed<br>
reduction ratios of the gearbox 51 and the transmission<br>
mechanism 57.<br>
The gear position detector 21 is designed to detect<br>
the positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b<br>
provided movably in the axial direction of the<br>
countershaft 55 or the main shaft 52. An example of the<br>
gear position detector 21 is a potentiometer mounted to<br>
the gearshift mechanism 56 or the shift actuator 16. The<br>
gear position detector 21 outputs a signal to the control<br>
unit 11 according to the positions of the shift gears 53a,<br>
53b, 54a, 54b. Based on the input signal, the control<br>
unit 11 detects that some of the shift gears 53a, 53b,<br>
54a, 54b, which are associated with the gear shifting,<br>
16<br><br>
have finished moving and the speed reduction ratios have<br>
changed already.<br>
The clutch position detector 22 is designed to detect<br>
an engagement state of the clutch 40. Examples of the<br>
clutch position detector 22 are a potentiometer for<br>
outputting a signal according to the position of the push<br>
rod 43 and a potentiometer for outputting a signal<br>
according to the position or the rotation angle of the<br>
output shaft of the clutch actuator 14. Based on the<br>
signal inputted from the clutch position detector 22, the<br>
control unit 11 detects the engagement state of the clutch<br>
40. In other words, the control unit 11 detects the<br>
degree of the contact between the drive-side member 41 and<br>
the driven-side member 42 (the distance between the drive-<br>
side member 41 and the driven-side member 42).<br>
The clutch rotational speed detector 23a is designed<br>
to detect the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41<br>
of the clutch 40. Examples of the clutch rotational speed<br>
detector 23a are a rotary encoder for outputting a pulse<br>
signal with a frequency according to the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41 and a tachogenerator for<br>
outputting a voltage signal according to the rotational<br>
speed of the drive-side member 41. In turn, the clutch<br>
rotational speed detector 23b is designed to detect the<br>
rotational speed of the driven-side member 42 of the<br>
17<br><br>
clutch 40. Examples of the clutch rotational speed<br>
detector 23b are a rotary encoder and a tachogenerator, as<br>
described for the clutch rotational speed detector 23a.<br>
The shift-up switch 9a and the shift-down switch 9b<br>
are designed for the rider to provide instructions to<br>
change the speed reduction ratios of the gearbox 51 to the<br>
clutch controller 11. These switches 9a, 9b output a<br>
signal to the control unit 11 according to the<br>
instructions of gear shifting. The control unit 11<br>
actuates the shift actuator 16 according to the input<br>
signal to change the pairs of the shift gears to transmit<br>
torque from the main shaft 52 to the countershaft 55.<br>
Now, description is made of the control of the clutch<br>
40 by means of the clutch controller 10 and the basic idea<br>
for such control.<br>
The related clutch controller controls the engagement<br>
state of the clutch based on the difference in rotational<br>
speed between the drive-side member and the driven-side<br>
member of the clutch. Therefore, other technologies have<br>
been proposed to reduce the time period spent for clutch<br>
engaging operation (from the point in time when the drive-<br>
side member and the driven-side member are apart from each<br>
other to the point in time when these members are pressed<br>
against each other), and to improve riding comfort during<br>
the clutch engaging operation or reduce shocks and the<br>
18<br><br>
deceleration feeling (see JP-A-2001-146930). However,<br>
there is a trade-off relationship between the reduction in<br>
time period spent for clutch engaging operation and the<br>
improvement in riding comfort. This restricts the<br>
reduction in time period spent for clutch engaging<br>
operation. In other words, to engage the clutch in a<br>
short time period causes shocks to the vehicle, and on the<br>
other hand, to reduce the shocks requires a longer time<br>
period to engage the clutch.<br>
The present inventor focused attention not on the time<br>
period actually spent for engaging the drive-side member<br>
with the driven-side member, but on the clutch engagement<br>
time period perceived by the rider. Then, the present<br>
inventor found that the rider perceives the clutch<br>
engagement time period due to the deceleration of the<br>
vehicle caused by disengagement of the clutch or a half-<br>
clutch state, as well as due to the slight shocks<br>
generated when the drive-side member and the driven-side<br>
member are completely engaged. In other words, the rider<br>
perceives the time period from the point in time when the<br>
vehicle starts decelerating to the point in time when<br>
slight shocks are generated when the drive-side member and<br>
the driven-side member are completely engaged, as a time<br>
period spent for engaging the clutch. In addition, the<br>
present inventor found that these deceleration and shocks<br>
19<br><br>
are caused by changes in torque transmitted from the<br>
drive-side member to the driven-side member of the clutch.<br>
More specifically, the vehicle decelerates with a decrease<br>
in torque transmitted from the drive-side member to the<br>
driven-side member, and shocks are generated with an<br>
increase in torque at the time when the drive-side member<br>
and the driven-side member are completely engaged.<br>
Thus, the clutch controller 10 described as an example<br>
of the embodiment of the invention obtains torque<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40<br>
to the downstream mechanism (such as the driven-side<br>
member 42 and the secondary speed reducing mechanism 50 in<br>
FIG. 2 (hereinafter referred to as downstream transmission<br>
mechanism)) in the torque transmission path including the<br>
driven-side member 42 (hereinafter the torque is referred<br>
to as actual transmission torque Tac) . In addition, the<br>
clutch controller 10 estimates torque to be transmitted to<br>
the downstream transmission mechanism after the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are completely<br>
engaged. Then, the clutch controller 10 defines the<br>
estimated torque as target transmission torque Ttg, and<br>
controls the engagement state of the clutch 40 during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40 (when the clutch 40 is<br>
in a half-clutch state) such that the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac approximates the target transmission torque<br>
20<br><br>
Ttg.<br>
Thereby, the actual transmission torque Tac is<br>
prevented from excessively decreasing during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch, thus reducing the vehicle<br>
deceleration feeling during the engaging operation. In<br>
addition, the actual transmission torque Tac is prevented<br>
from changing at the time when the clutch is completely<br>
engaged, thus reducing the shocks generated at that time.<br>
Consequently, the rider perceives that it takes less time<br>
to engage the clutch. FIG. 4 is an explanatory view<br>
showing changes in actual transmission torque Tac with<br>
respect to time during engaging operation of the clutch<br>
40. At the time tl, the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
decreases to 0 temporarily because the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged. After that, the clutch controller 10<br>
estimates torque at the time when the clutch 40 is<br>
completely engaged (at the time t4 in FIG. 4) and defines<br>
the estimated torque as target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
At the time t2, when the clutch controller 10 starts<br>
actuating the clutch 40 in the direction to engage the<br>
clutch 40, the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state. When<br>
the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state, the clutch<br>
controller 10 controls the engagement state of the clutch<br>
40 such that the actual transmission torque Tac reaches<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. As a result of this<br>
21<br><br>
control, at the time t3, the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac is equal to the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
corresponds with the torque to be obtained after<br>
completion of the clutch engagement. After that, the<br>
clutch 40 is completely engaged at the time t4, and thus<br>
the half-clutch state is discontinued. Because the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac has been already equal to the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg, the current actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is prevented from changing, thus<br>
reducing the shocks to the vehicles. Up to this point,<br>
the basic idea for the control of the clutch 40 by means<br>
of the clutch controller 10 has been discussed.<br>
Hereinafter, the control of the clutch 40 by means of the<br>
clutch controller 10 will be described in details.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating functions of<br>
the control unit 11. The functions of the control unit 11<br>
include an actual torque obtaining section 11a, a target<br>
torque obtaining section lib, a clutch actuator control<br>
section lie, and a shift actuator control section lid.<br>
The actual torque obtaining section 11a obtains actual<br>
transmission torque Tac in a predetermined sampling cycle<br>
(for example, several milliseconds) during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40 in which the drive-side member<br>
41 and the driven-side member 42 approach each other.<br>
This processing is executed as follows, for example. In<br>
22<br><br>
the description herein, the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
is referred to as torque transmitted from the drive-side<br>
member 41 to the driven-side member 42.<br>
The actual torque obtaining section 11a calculates the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac based on the torque<br>
outputted from the engine 30 (hereinafter referred to as<br>
EG torque TEac) and based on the inertia torque produced<br>
on a mechanism upstream of the drive-side member 41 (such<br>
as the crankshaft 34, the piston 32 and the primary speed<br>
reducing mechanism 36 (hereinafter referred to as engine-<br>
side mechanism)) in the torque transmission path<br>
(hereinafter the inertia torque is referred to as EG-side<br>
inertia torque TIac). The EG-side inertia torque TIac is<br>
a value obtained by multiplying the inertia moment I on<br>
the engine-side mechanism by the variation in engine speed<br>
Qe per unit time, dQe / dt. The inertia moment I is<br>
calculated in advance, for example, in the stage of<br>
manufacturing the engine 30.<br>
Description is first made of an example of • the<br>
processing for obtaining the EG torque TEac. The actual<br>
torque obtaining section 11a obtains the EG torque TEac<br>
based on the accelerator displacement Aop, detected by the<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, and based on the engine<br>
speed Qe detected by the engine speed detector 18. For<br>
example, the storage unit 12 stores in advance a table<br>
23<br><br>
that establishes the correspondence between the EG torque<br>
TEac, and the engine speed Qe and the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop (hereinafter the table is referred to as<br>
EG torque table). Then, the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a detects the accelerator displacement Aop based<br>
on the request torque signal inputted from the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17, while detecting the engine speed Qe<br>
based on the signal inputted from the engine speed<br>
detector 18. Then, the actual torque obtaining section<br>
11a refers to the EG torque table to obtain the EG torque<br>
TEac that corresponds to the detected accelerator<br>
displacement Aop and engine speed Qe. The storage unit 12<br>
may store in advance an expression that represents the<br>
relationship between the engine speed Qe, the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop and the EG torque TEac (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as EG torque relational<br>
expression). In this case, the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a substitutes the detected engine speed Qe and<br>
accelerator displacement Aop into the EG torque relational<br>
expression in order to calculate the EG torque TEac.<br>
Now, description is made of an example of the<br>
processing for obtaining the EG-side inertia torque TIac.<br>
The actual torque obtaining section 11a obtains the EG-<br>
side inertia torque TIac based on the engine speed Qe.<br>
Specifically, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
24<br><br>
calculates a variation in engine speed Qe per unit time<br>
(hereinafter the variation is referred to as EG speed<br>
variation dQe / dt) based on the signal inputted from the<br>
engine speed detector 18. Then, a value, which is<br>
obtained by multiplying the EG speed variation dQe / dt by<br>
the inertia moment on the engine-side mechanism<br>
(hereinafter referred to as engine-side inertia moment I),<br>
is defined as EG-side inertia torque TIac (TIac = I x dQe<br>
/ dt) . Alternatively, the storage unit 12 may store in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the EG speed variation dQe / dt and the EG-side<br>
inertia torque TIac. In this case, the actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a refers to the table to obtain the<br>
EG-side inertia torque TIac that corresponds to the EG<br>
speed variation dQe / dt.<br>
Then, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
subtracts the EG-side inertia torque TIac, produced due to<br>
changes in engine speed Qe, from the EG torque TEac,<br>
obtained from the aforementioned processing, in order to<br>
calculate the actual transmission torque Tac. For<br>
example, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
substitutes the EG torque TEac and the EG-side inertia<br>
torque TIac into the following expression (1) stored in<br>
advance in the storage unit 12 in order to calculate the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
25<br><br>
Tac = (TEac - TIac) x Pratio	(1)<br>
Where Pratio is the speed reduction ratio of the<br>
primary speed reducing mechanism 36 (Pratio = the number<br>
of teeth of the driven-side primary reduction gear 36b /<br>
the number of teeth of the drive-side primary reduction<br>
gear 36a).<br>
The processing executed by the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a is not limited to this. For example, in the<br>
above description, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
calculates the actual transmission torque Tac. More<br>
specifically, after obtaining the EG torque TEac and the<br>
EG-side inertia torque TIac, the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a subtracts the obtained EG-side inertia torque<br>
TIac from the obtained EG torque TEac, and multiplies the<br>
subtraction result by the speed reduction ratio Pratio of<br>
the primary speed reducing mechanism 36. However, for<br>
example, the storage unit 12 may store in advance a table<br>
or an expression that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac, and the engine<br>
speed Qe, the accelerator displacement Aop and the EG<br>
speed variation dQe / dt. In this case, the actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a uses the table or the expression to<br>
directly obtain the actual transmission torque Tac that<br>
corresponds to the engine speed Qe, the EG speed variation<br>
dQe / dt and the accelerator displacement Aop.<br>
26<br><br>
Alternatively, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
may obtain the EG torque TEac based on pressure of air<br>
flowing through the interior of the intake pipe 35<br>
(hereinafter the pressure is referred to as intake<br>
pressure) (see FIG. 2) . For example, the storage unit 12<br>
stores a table that establishes the correspondence between<br>
the EG torque TEac, and the intake pressure and the engine<br>
speed Qe. In addition, a pressure sensor for outputting a<br>
signal according to the intake pressure is disposed in the<br>
intake pipe 35. In this case, the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a detects the intake pressure based on the<br>
signal inputted from the pressure sensor at the time when<br>
the crank angle is a predetermined value (for example, at<br>
the end of intake stroke), while detecting the engine<br>
speed Qe based on the signal inputted from the engine<br>
speed detector 18. Then, the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a refers to the table stored in the storage unit<br>
12 to obtain the EG torque TEac that corresponds to the<br>
detected intake pressure and engine speed Qe.<br>
A torque detector may be provided in advance for<br>
outputting an electric signal according to the torque<br>
transmitted to the driven-side member 42. Then, the<br>
actual torque obtaining section 11a obtains the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac transmitted to the driven-side<br>
member 42 based on the signal inputted from the torque<br>
27<br><br>
detector. An example of the torque detector is a sensor<br>
for outputting an electric signal according to the strain<br>
stress on the main shaft 52 to which torque is<br>
transmitted.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed by<br>
the target torque obtaining section lib. The target<br>
torque obtaining section lib obtains torque, which is<br>
supposed to be transmitted from the drive-side member 41<br>
to the driven-side member 42 of the clutch 40, as target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. As described above,<br>
specifically, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
estimates torque to be transmitted from the drive-side<br>
member 41 to the driven-side member 42 after the drive-<br>
side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are<br>
completely engaged, and defines the estimated torque as<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. The wording, when the<br>
drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are<br>
completely engaged, means the point in time when there is<br>
no difference in rotational speed between the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff)<br>
or the point in time when the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff is equal to or below a predetermined<br>
value. The target torque obtaining section lib executes<br>
the following processing, for example.<br>
28<br><br>
The target torque obtaining section lib estimates<br>
torque to be outputted from the engine 30 after completion<br>
of the clutch engagement (hereinafter the torque is<br>
referred to as post-completion EG torque TEfin). In<br>
addition, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
estimates inertia torque to be produced on the engine-side<br>
mechanism after completion of the clutch engagement<br>
(hereinafter the inertia torque is referred to as post-<br>
completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin). Then, the<br>
target torque obtaining section lib obtains the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg based on the estimated post-<br>
completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin and post-<br>
completion EG torque TEfin.<br>
Description is first made of the processing for<br>
estimating the post-completion EG torque TEfin. The<br>
target torque obtaining section lib estimates the engine<br>
speed Qefin after completion of the clutch engagement<br>
based on the rotational speed of the downstream<br>
transmission mechanism, which is obtained before engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40 starts or during the engaging<br>
operation. Then, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
estimates the post-completion EG torque TEfin based on the<br>
estimated engine speed Qefin and the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop obtained before engaging operation of the<br>
clutch starts or during the engaging operation.<br>
29<br><br>
For example, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
obtains the rotational speed of the driven-side member 42<br>
that forms the downstream transmission mechanism, while<br>
obtaining the rotational speed of the drive-side member<br>
41, in order to calculate the difference in rotational<br>
speed between these members or the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff. In addition, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib obtains the engine speed Qe based on<br>
the signal inputted from the engine speed detector 18.<br>
Then, the target torque obtaining section lib estimates<br>
the engine speed Qefin after completion of the clutch<br>
engagement based on the clutch rotational speed difference<br>
Qdiff and the engine speed Qe. In other words, the<br>
engine speed Qefin after completion of the clutch<br>
engagement depends on the engine speed Qe and the<br>
rotational speed of the downstream transmission mechanism,<br>
which are obtained before engaging operation of the clutch<br>
40 starts or during the engaging operation. More<br>
specifically, a value of the engine speed Qefin after<br>
completion of the clutch engagement is estimated to change<br>
from the engine speed Qe during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch by an amount depending on the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference Qdiff. Thus, the target torque obtaining<br>
section lib substitutes the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff and the engine speed Qe, which are<br>
30<br><br>
obtained during engaging operation of the clutch 40, into<br>
the following expression (2) in order to calculate the<br>
engine speed Qefin.<br>
Qefin = Qe - Qdiff x Pratio	(2)<br>
Then, the target torque obtaining section lib detects<br>
the accelerator displacement Aop by the rider based on the<br>
request torque signal inputted from the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17 during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, and refers to the aforementioned EG torque<br>
table to define the torque that corresponds to the<br>
detected accelerator displacement Aop and the calculated<br>
engine speed Qefin as post-completion EG torque TEfin.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing for<br>
estimating the post-completion EG-side inertia torque<br>
TIfin. A variation in engine speed Qefin per unit time,<br>
dQefin / dt, after completion of the clutch engagement<br>
depends on the variation in rotational speed of the<br>
downstream transmission mechanism per unit time obtained<br>
before engaging operation of the clutch 40 starts or<br>
during the engaging operation. For example, as the<br>
variation in rotational speed of the downstream<br>
transmission mechanism during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40 is larger, the variation dQefin / dt in engine<br>
speed Qefin after completion of the clutch engagement is<br>
larger, accordingly. Consequently, the post-completion<br>
31<br><br>
EG-side inertia torque TIfin is estimated to be larger.<br>
Thus, the target torque obtaining section lib estimates<br>
the post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin based on<br>
the variation in rotational speed of the downstream<br>
transmission mechanism obtained before engaging operation<br>
of the clutch 40 starts or during the engaging operation.<br>
For example, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
calculates a variation in rotational speed Qcl of the<br>
downstream transmission mechanism or the driven-side<br>
member 42 per unit time (hereinafter the variation is<br>
referred to as driven-side rotational speed variation dQcl<br>
/ dt) based on the signal inputted from the clutch<br>
rotational speed detector 23b. Then, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib substitutes the driven-side<br>
rotational speed variation dQcl / dt into the following<br>
expression (3), for example, in order to calculate the<br>
post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin.<br>
TIfin = dQcl / dt x Pratio x I	(3)<br>
Where I is the EG-side inertia moment and Pratio is<br>
the speed reduction ratio of the primary speed reducing<br>
mechanism 36, as described above.<br>
Alternatively, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may execute this processing for calculating the post-<br>
completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin only before<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40 starts or in a<br>
32<br><br>
predetermined cycle during the engaging operation. More<br>
specifically, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
calculates the driven-side rotational speed variation dQcl<br>
/ dt in a predetermined sampling cycle, for example,<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40, and obtains<br>
the post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin based on<br>
the calculated driven-side rotational speed variation dQcl<br>
/ dt. Then, the target torque obtaining section lib uses<br>
the sequentially-calculated post-completion EG-side<br>
inertia torque TIfin to calculate the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg. The calculation in such a manner allows a<br>
deviation between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac to be reduced at the<br>
time of completely engaging the clutch 40.<br>
In addition, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may calculate the driven-side rotational speed variation<br>
dQcl / dt based on the signal inputted from the clutch<br>
rotational speed detector 23b immediately before the<br>
clutch 40 is disengaged (for example, several hundred<br>
milliseconds before the clutch 40 starts being disengaged)<br>
in the processing executed by the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie. The clutch actuator control section lie will<br>
be discussed later. Then, the target torque obtaining<br>
section lib may calculate the post-completion EG-side<br>
inertia torque TIfin based on the calculated driven-side<br>
33<br><br>
rotational speed variation dQcl / dt, and in the process<br>
of the engaging operation of the clutch 40, may use the<br>
calculated post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin to<br>
calculate the target transmission torque Ttg. Thereby,<br>
the processing load is reduced in the process of the<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40.<br>
The processing for obtaining the post-completion EG-<br>
side inertia torque TIfin is not limited to the<br>
aforementioned processing based on the rotational speed<br>
Qcl of the driven-side member 42. For example, the<br>
motorcycle 1 may be provided with a detector for detecting<br>
the rotational speed of the countershaft 55. In this<br>
case, the target torque obtaining section lib calculates a<br>
variation in rotational speed Qcout of the countershaft 55<br>
per unit time, dQcout / dt. Then, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib substitutes the variation dQcout /<br>
dt in rotational speed of the countershaft 55 into the<br>
following expression (4), for example, in order to<br>
calculate the post-completion EG-side inertia torque<br>
TIfin.<br>
TIfin = dQcout / dt x Pratio x Mratio x I	(4)<br>
Where Mratio is the speed reduction ratio of the<br>
gearbox 51 (the number of teeth of the shift gears 54a,<br>
54b / the number of teeth of the shift gears 53a, 53b)<br>
after completion of the clutch engagement.<br>
34<br><br>
Alternatively, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may obtain the post-completion EG-side inertial torque<br>
TIfin based on the vehicle speed signal inputted from the<br>
vehicle speed detector 19. Specifically, the target<br>
torque obtaining section lib calculates a variation in<br>
rotational speed Qf inal of the axle 3a per unit time,<br>
dQfinal / dt, based on the vehicle speed signal. Then,<br>
the target torque obtaining section lib may substitute the<br>
variation dQfinal / dt in rotational speed of the axle 3a<br>
into the following expression (5), for example, in order<br>
to calculate the post-completion EG-side inertia torque<br>
TIfin.<br>
TIfin = dQfinal / dt x Pratio x Mratio x Tratio x I	(5)<br>
Where Tratio is the speed reduction ratio of the<br>
transmission mechanism 57.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing for<br>
obtaining the target transmission torque Ttg based on the<br>
post-completion EG torque TEfin and the post-completion<br>
EG-side inertia torque TIfin. The target torque obtaining<br>
section lib subtracts the post-completion EG-side inertia<br>
torque TIfin from the post-completion EG torque TEfin,<br>
which are both obtained from the aforementioned<br>
processing, in order to calculate the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg. For example, the target torque obtaining<br>
section lib substitutes the post-completion EG torque<br>
35<br><br>
TEfin and the post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin<br>
into the following expression (6) in order to calculate<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
Ttg = (TEfin - TIfin) x Pratio	(6)<br>
Alternatively, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may correct the subtraction result, obtained by<br>
subtracting the post-completion EG-side inertia torque<br>
TIfin from the post-completion EG torque TEfin, and<br>
provide the corrected result for the processing for<br>
calculating the target transmission torque Ttg. For<br>
example, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
substitutes the post-completion EG torque TEfin and the<br>
post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin into the<br>
following expression (7) in order to calculate the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
Ttg = (TEfin - TIfin) x Ka x Pratio	(7)<br>
Where Ka is a correction value. For example, the<br>
correction value Ka is determined according to the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop, which is detected based on<br>
the signal inputted from the accelerator operation<br>
detector 17, and is preset such that the correction value<br>
Ka increases in proportion to the accelerator displacement<br>
Aop. Therefore, as the accelerator displacement Aop<br>
increases, the target transmission torque Ttg, which is<br>
supposed to be transmitted from the drive-side member 41<br>
36<br><br>
to the downstream transmission mechanism, is preset<br>
higher, so that the rider can obtain acceleration feeling<br>
according to the rider's accelerator operation.<br>
In the process of the engaging operation of the clutch<br>
40, the target torque obtaining section lib executes the<br>
aforementioned processing for estimating the post-<br>
completion EG torque TEfin and the aforementioned<br>
processing for estimating the post-completion EG-side<br>
inertia torque TIfin in a predetermined sampling cycle, in<br>
order to obtain the target transmission torque Ttg based<br>
on the estimated post-completion EG torque TEfin and post-<br>
completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin. Thereby, in the<br>
process of the engaging operation of the clutch 40, the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg changes gradually depending<br>
on the rider's accelerator operation or running conditions<br>
of the vehicle, so that operability of the vehicle<br>
improves.<br>
The processing executed by the target torque obtaining<br>
section lib is not limited to the aforementioned<br>
processing. For example, in the above description, after<br>
calculating the post-completion EG torque TEfin and the<br>
post-completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin, the target<br>
torque obtaining section lib subtracts the post-completion<br>
EG-side inertial torque TIfin from the post-completion EG<br>
torque TEfin to obtain the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
37<br><br>
However, the target torque obtaining section lib may-<br>
obtain the target transmission torque Ttg directly from a<br>
value detected by the respective detectors. More<br>
specifically, the storage unit 12 stores in advance an<br>
expression that associates the accelerator displacement<br>
Aop, the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff, the<br>
driven-side rotational speed variation dQcl / dt, and the<br>
engine speed Qe with the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
Then, the target torque obtaining section lib may<br>
substitute the detected accelerator displacement Aop,<br>
clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff, driven-side<br>
rotational speed variation dQcl / dt and engine speed Qe<br>
into the expression to calculate the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
Alternatively, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may obtain the target transmission torque Ttg based on the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop in the process of the<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40 and based on the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac before the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie starts disengaging the clutch 40.<br>
This processing is executed as follows, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg, and the accelerator displacement<br>
Aop and the actual transmission torque Tac or an<br>
38<br><br>
expression that represents the relationship between the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac and the target transmission torque Ttg. For<br>
example, in the table and the expression, as the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac increase, the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
increases. When a gear shifting command signal is<br>
inputted from the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down<br>
switch 9b, the target torque obtaining section lib obtains<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac before the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged in the processing executed by the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie. The processing for<br>
obtaining the actual transmission torque Tac is performed<br>
in the same manner as the aforementioned processing by the<br>
actual torque obtaining section 11a, for example. In the<br>
process of the engaging operation of the clutch 40, the<br>
target torque obtaining section lib detects the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop by the rider in a<br>
predetermined sampling cycle. Then, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib uses the table or the expression<br>
stored in the storage unit 12 to obtain the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg that corresponds to the detected<br>
accelerator displacement Aop and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac obtained before the clutch 40 is disengaged.<br>
Alternatively, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
39<br><br>
may obtain the target transmission torque Ttg based on the<br>
intake pressure. This processing is executed as follows,<br>
for example. The storage unit 12 stores in advance a<br>
table that establishes the correspondence between the<br>
torque of the engine 30, and the intake pressure and the<br>
engine speed Qe. In the processing for calculating the<br>
post-completion EG torque TEfin, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib estimates the engine speed Qefin<br>
after completion of the clutch engagement in the same<br>
manner as the aforementioned processing. In addition, the<br>
target torque obtaining section lib detects the intake<br>
pressure at the time when the crank angle is a<br>
predetermined value (for example, at the end of intake<br>
stroke). Then, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may refer to the table stored in the storage unit 12 to<br>
obtain torque that corresponds to the detected intake<br>
pressure and the estimated engine speed Qefin in order to<br>
define the obtained torque as post-completion EG torque<br>
TEfin.<br>
The clutch actuator control section lie actuates the<br>
clutch actuator 14 to control the engagement state of the<br>
clutch 40 based on the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
obtained by the actual torque obtaining section 11a.<br>
Specifically, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 in a predetermined cycle<br>
40<br><br>
(for example, a cycle for calculating the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac and the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg) by an actuation amount according to the difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg (hereinafter referred to as torque<br>
deviation AT (AT = Ttg - Tac) ) . The clutch actuator<br>
control section lie executes the following processing, for<br>
example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an expression<br>
that represents the relationship between the torque<br>
deviation AT and the actuation amount of the clutch<br>
actuator 14 (hereinafter the expression is referred to as<br>
actuation amount relational expression). The clutch<br>
actuator control section lie calculates the torque<br>
deviation AT every time the actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a obtains the actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section lie substitutes<br>
the calculated torque deviation AT into the actuation<br>
amount relational expression in order to obtain the amount<br>
by which the clutch actuator 14 is to be actuated<br>
(hereinafter the amount is referred to as command<br>
actuation amount), and outputs a signal to the clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 13 according to the command<br>
actuation amount. The clutch actuator drive circuit 13<br>
supplies electric power to the clutch actuator 14<br>
41<br><br>
according to the input signal. The clutch actuator 14 is<br>
actuated by the command actuation amount during the<br>
aforementioned cycle. Then, the pressing force between<br>
the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 is<br>
varied by an amount according to the actuation amount of<br>
the clutch actuator 14, so that the engagement state of<br>
the clutch 40 changes.<br>
For example, the command actuation amount is preset<br>
larger as the torque deviation AT increases. FIG. 6 is a<br>
graph showing the relationship between the torque<br>
deviation AT (AT = Ttg - Tac) and the command actuation<br>
amount obtained from the actuation amount relational<br>
expression. In an example shown in FIG. 6, the actuation<br>
amount relational expression is established such that if<br>
the torque deviation AT is positive, the clutch actuator<br>
14 is actuated in the direction to engage the clutch 40.<br>
In turn, the actuation amount relational expression is<br>
established such that if the torque deviation AT is<br>
negative, the clutch actuator 14 is actuated in the<br>
direction to disengage the clutch 40. In addition, the<br>
actuation amount relational expression is established such<br>
that the command actuation amount increases in proportion<br>
to the torque deviation AT. As described above, the<br>
command actuation amount is an amount by which the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated during one cycle, and the command<br>
42<br><br>
actuation amount is preset in such a manner that it<br>
increases in proportion to the torque deviation AT. This<br>
makes it possible to increase the speed at which the<br>
clutch actuator 14 operates, if the torque deviation AT is<br>
large.<br>
The relationship between the torque deviation AT and<br>
the command actuation amount is not limited to the<br>
relationship shown in FIG. 6. For example, the actuation<br>
amount relational expression may be established such that<br>
the command actuation amount is proportional to the square<br>
of the torque deviation AT.<br>
Further, in place of the actuation amount relational<br>
expression, the storage unit 12 may store a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the command<br>
actuation amount and the torque deviation AT (hereinafter<br>
the table is referred to as actuation amount table) . In<br>
this case, the clutch actuator control section lie refers<br>
to the actuation amount table to obtain the command<br>
actuation amount that corresponds to the torque deviation<br>
AT. Alternatively, the actuation amount table may<br>
establish the correspondence between the command actuation<br>
amount, and the target transmission torque Ttg and the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac. In this case, the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie refers to the actuation<br>
amount table, without calculating the torque deviation AT,<br>
43<br><br>
to directly obtain the command actuation amount that<br>
corresponds to the target transmission torque Ttg and the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
Alternatively, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
may correct the command actuation amount based on a<br>
predetermined correction value depending on the engagement<br>
state of the clutch 40 (hereinafter the correction value<br>
is referred to as actuation amount correction value Km) .<br>
FIG. 7 is a graph showing an example of the relationship<br>
between the actuation amount correction value Km and the<br>
engagement state of the clutch 40, in which the horizontal<br>
axis represents the engagement state of the clutch 40 and<br>
the vertical axis represents the actuation amount<br>
correction value Km. In the graph, an actuation amount<br>
correction value CI when the clutch 40 is disengaged is<br>
preset larger than an actuation amount correction value C2<br>
when the clutch 4 0 is engaged. In addition, when the<br>
position of the clutch 40 (the positional relationship<br>
between the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42) is between Pi and P2, the actuation amount<br>
correction value Km is preset larger as the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to disengage the<br>
clutch 40. In the case where the actuation amount<br>
correction value Km is preset in this manner, the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie multiplies the difference<br>
44<br><br>
between the target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac by the actuation amount correction<br>
value Km, for example, and refers to the aforementioned<br>
actuation amount table and actuation amount relational<br>
expression to obtain the command actuation amount that<br>
corresponds to the multiplication result ((Ttg - Tac) x<br>
Km) .<br>
When the rider provides gear shifting instructions,<br>
the clutch actuator control section lie actuates the<br>
clutch actuator 14 to disengage the clutch 40 in order to<br>
temporarily interrupt torque transmission from the drive-<br>
side member 41 to the driven-side member 42. After that,<br>
the clutch actuator control section lie detects that some<br>
of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b, which are<br>
associated with the gear shifting instructions, have been<br>
moved already based on the signal inputted from the gear<br>
position detector 21, and then executes the aforementioned<br>
processing. More specifically, according to the obtained<br>
command actuation amount, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie actuates the clutch actuator 14 in the<br>
direction to engage the clutch 40.<br>
When the rider operates the shift-up switch 9a or the<br>
shift-down switch 9b to provide gear shifting<br>
instructions, the shift actuator control section lid<br>
actuates the shift actuator 16 to change the pairs of<br>
45<br><br>
shift gears to transmit torque. Specifically, after<br>
detecting that the clutch 40 is disengaged based on the<br>
signal inputted from the clutch position detector 22, the<br>
shift actuator control section lid outputs a signal to the<br>
shift actuator drive circuit 15 according to the rider's<br>
gear shifting instructions. Thereby, the shift actuator<br>
drive circuit 15 supplies electric power to actuate the<br>
shift actuator 16, in order to move some of the shift<br>
gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b according to the gear shifting<br>
instructions.<br>
Now, description is made of the flow of the processing<br>
executed by the control unit 11. FIG. 8 is a flowchart<br>
showing an example of the processing executed by the<br>
control unit 11. Here, the processing executed by the<br>
control unit 11 at gear shifting is described as an<br>
example.<br>
The clutch actuator control section lie determines<br>
whether or not a gear shifting command signal is inputted<br>
from the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down switch 9b<br>
(S101). If no gear shifting command signal is inputted,<br>
the clutch actuator control section lie waits until the<br>
gear shifting command signal is inputted. When the gear<br>
shifting command signal is inputted, the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie actuates the clutch actuator 14 to<br>
disengage the clutch 40 (S102). After detecting that the<br>
46<br><br>
clutch 40 is disengaged based on the signal inputted from<br>
the clutch position detector 22, the shift actuator<br>
control section lid actuates the shift actuator 16 to move<br>
some of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b, which are<br>
associated with the gear shifting command, in order to<br>
change the speed reduction ratios of the gearbox 51<br>
(S103). After detecting that some of the shift gears 53a,<br>
53b, 54a, 54b have been moved already based on the signal<br>
inputted from the gear position detector 21, the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie executes the processing for<br>
engaging the clutch 40 that has been disengaged.<br>
Specifically, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
obtains the target transmission torque Ttg (S104) . For<br>
example, the target torque obtaining section lib detects<br>
the accelerator displacement Aop based on the request<br>
torque signal inputted from the accelerator operation<br>
detector 17, while detecting the rotational speed Qcl of<br>
the driven-side member 42 based on the signal inputted<br>
from the clutch rotational speed detector 23b. Then,<br>
based on the detected rotational speed Qcl, the variation<br>
dQcl / dt in rotational speed Qcl per unit time, and the<br>
detected accelerator displacement Aop, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib estimates torque, which is supposed<br>
to be transmitted to the driven-side member 42 after<br>
completion of the clutch engagement, and defines the<br>
47<br><br>
estimated torque as target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
In turn, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
obtains the actual transmission torque Tac currently-<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the driven-<br>
side member 42 (step S105) . For example, the actual<br>
torque obtaining section 11a detects the engine speed Qe,<br>
while calculating the variation in engine speed Qe per<br>
unit time or EG speed variation dQe / dt. Then, the<br>
actual torque obtaining section 11a obtains the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac based on the engine speed Qe and<br>
the EG speed variation dQe / dt.<br>
After that, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
obtains the amount by which the clutch actuator 14 is to<br>
be actuated, that is, the command actuation amount based<br>
on the target transmission torque Ttg obtained in the step<br>
S104 and the actual transmission torque Tac obtained in<br>
the step S105, and outputs a signal to the clutch actuator<br>
drive circuit 15 according to the obtained command<br>
actuation amount (S106). Consequently, the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 approach each<br>
other, so that the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state.<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
calculates the difference in rotational speed between the<br>
drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 (the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff) based on the<br>
48<br><br>
signals inputted from the clutch rotational speed<br>
detectors 23a, 23b, and determines whether or not the<br>
calculated clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is<br>
smaller than a predetermined value (hereinafter referred<br>
to as speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch)<br>
(S107). Alternatively, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie may determine whether or not the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference Qdiff continues to be smaller<br>
than the speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch<br>
for a given time period. In the step S107, if the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference Qdiff is equal to or greater<br>
than the speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch,<br>
the control unit 11 returns to the step S104 to reexecute<br>
the subsequent processing steps. When the clutch 40 is in<br>
a half-clutch state, the control unit 11 repeats the steps<br>
S104 to S106 in a predetermined cycle. This allows the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac to follow the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. In contrast, in the step S107,<br>
if the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is smaller<br>
than the speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch,<br>
the clutch actuator control section lie actuates the<br>
clutch actuator 14 to discontinue the half-clutch state of<br>
the clutch 40 and engage the clutch 40 completely (S108).<br>
The aforementioned processing is an example of the<br>
processing executed by the control unit 11 at gear<br>
49<br><br>
shifting.<br>
Now, description is made of the results of the<br>
processing executed by the control unit 11. FIG. 9 is a<br>
time chart to illustrate the results of the processing<br>
executed at gear changes, wherein FIG. 9(a) shows changes<br>
in engagement state of the clutch 40 with respect to time;<br>
FIG. 9(b) shows changes in target transmission torque Ttg<br>
with respect to time; FIG. 9(c) shows changes in actual<br>
transmission torque Tac with respect to time; FIG. 9(d)<br>
shows changes in torque transmitted to the axle 3a with<br>
respect to time; and FIG. 9(e) shows changes in engine<br>
speed Qe with respect to time. The description herein is<br>
made of an example in which the gearbox 51 is shifted-up,<br>
and the torque, transmitted to the axle 3a of the rear<br>
wheel 3 after the gear shifting, decreases compared to<br>
before the gear shifting.<br>
When the shift-up switch 9a inputs a gear shifting<br>
command signal at the time tl, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie executes the processing to actuate the clutch<br>
actuator 14, so that the clutch 40 is disengaged as shown<br>
in FIG. 9(a). At this time, as shown in FIGs. 9(c) and<br>
9(d), the actual transmission torque Tac transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member 41 to the driven-side member 42 of<br>
the clutch 40 and the torque transmitted to the axle 3a<br>
are 0. In turn, as shown in FIG. 9(e), the engine speed<br>
50<br><br>
increases slightly because the load on the engine 30 is<br>
eliminated (see time t2). After that, at the time t3,<br>
when some of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b have been<br>
moved already in the processing executed by the shift<br>
actuator control section lid, the torque estimated to be<br>
transmitted to the driven-side member 42 after completion<br>
of the clutch engagement is preset as target transmission<br>
torque Ttg, as shown in FIG. 9(c) . In addition, the<br>
clutch actuator 14 starts being actuated by the command<br>
actuation amount according to the torque deviation AT.<br>
Consequently, as shown in FIG. 9(a), the clutch 40 is in<br>
half-clutch state in which the drive-side member 41 and<br>
the driven-side member 42 contact each other. As shown in<br>
FIGs. 9(c) and 9(d), the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
transmitted to the driven-side member 42 and the torque<br>
transmitted to the axle 3a start increasing. Then, at the<br>
time t4, the target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac are equal to each other. As shown<br>
in FIG. 9(d), the torque, estimated to be transmitted at<br>
the time when the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42 are completely engaged (at the time t5 in FIGs.<br>
9 (a)-9(e)), is transmitted to the axle 3a and the driven-<br>
side member 42 at the time t4. From the time t3 to the<br>
time t4, as the torque deviation AT is gradually smaller,<br>
the displacement of the clutch 40 per unit time is<br>
51<br><br>
gradually smaller, accordingly, as shown in FIG. 9(a). In<br>
addition, as shown in FIG. 9(e), because at the time of<br>
shift-up operation, normally the rotational speed of the<br>
driven-side member 42 is lower than the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41, the engine speed Qe decreases<br>
moderately.<br>
After that, the actual transmission torque Tac and the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg continue to be equal to<br>
each other, and therefore, the engagement state of the<br>
clutch 40 is maintained. After that, at the time t5, when<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is smaller<br>
than the aforementioned speed difference for discontinuing<br>
half-clutch, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 to completely engage the<br>
driven-side member 42 with the drive-side member 41 and<br>
discontinue the half-clutch state. At this time, as shown<br>
in FIGs. 9(c) and 9(d), the torque transmitted to the<br>
driven-side member 42 and the axle 3a remains unchanged<br>
and is maintained at the level at the time t4. In FIGs.<br>
9(a) to 9(e), when the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch<br>
state, the target transmission torque Ttg is constant.<br>
However, in case the rider increases the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop when the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch<br>
state, the target transmission torque Ttg, obtained by the<br>
target torque obtaining section lib, changes, accordingly.<br>
52<br><br>
In this case, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
controls the engagement state of the clutch 40 such that<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac follows the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
The above-mentioned clutch controller 10 is provided<br>
with: the target torque obtaining section lib for<br>
obtaining torque that is supposed to be transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member 41 to the downstream transmission<br>
mechanism including the driven-side member 42 as target<br>
transmission torque Ttg; and the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie for actuating the clutch actuator 14 based on<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. Thus, the target<br>
torque obtaining section lib estimates the torque to be<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the<br>
downstream transmission mechanism after the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are completely<br>
engaged, and defines the estimated torque as target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
This minimizes the changes in torque transmitted via<br>
the clutch 40 at the time of completely engaging the<br>
clutch 40, and thus improves the riding comfort of the<br>
vehicle at the time when engaging operation of the clutch<br>
40 is required, such as at gear shifting or vehicle start-<br>
up. In addition, the changes in torque are minimized at<br>
the time of completely engaging the clutch 40, thereby<br>
53<br><br>
allowing the rider to perceive less time spent for<br>
engaging the clutch 40.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned clutch controller 10,<br>
the target torque obtaining section lib estimates the<br>
post-completion EG torque TEfin, to be outputted from the<br>
engine 30 after the drive-side member 41 and the driven-<br>
side member 42 are completely engaged, and the post-<br>
completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin, to be produced on<br>
the mechanism upstream of the drive-side member 41 (the<br>
engine-side mechanism) in the torque transmission path<br>
after the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member<br>
42 are completely engaged. Then, based on the estimated<br>
post-completion EG torque TEfin and post-completion EG-<br>
side inertia torque TIfin, the target torque obtaining<br>
section lib estimates the torque to be transmitted to the<br>
downstream mechanism after the drive-side member 41 and<br>
the driven-side member 42 are completely engaged. Thus,<br>
by such simple processing, the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg is set at the torque estimated to be transmitted from<br>
the drive-side member 41 to the downstream transmission<br>
mechanism after the drive-side member 41 and the driven-<br>
side member 42 are completely engaged.<br>
The clutch controller 10 is further provided with the<br>
actual torque obtaining section 11a for obtaining torque<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the driven-<br>
54<br><br>
side member 42 as actual transmission torque Tac. The<br>
clutch actuator control section lie actuates the actuator<br>
based on the difference between the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac and the target transmission torque Ttg. This<br>
allows for the control of the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac to approximate the target transmission torque Ttg,<br>
which minimizes the changes in actual transmission torque<br>
Tac at the time of completely engaging the clutch 40, and<br>
thus improves the riding comfort of the vehicle at the<br>
time when engaging operation of the clutch 40 is required,<br>
such as at gear shifting or vehicle start-up.<br>
In the clutch controller 10, the actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a obtains the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac based on the EG torque TEac outputted from the<br>
engine 30 and based on the EG-side inertia torque TIac<br>
produced on the mechanism upstream of the drive-side<br>
member 41 (the engine-side mechanism) in the torque<br>
transmission path. The actual transmission torque Tac is<br>
thus obtained without providing any specific sensor for<br>
outputting a signal according to the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac.<br>
Still further, the above-mentioned clutch controller<br>
10 reduces the impacts of the aging (for example, wear-<br>
out) or thermal expansion of the clutch 40. The related<br>
clutch controller controls the clutch based on the<br>
55<br><br>
difference in rotational speed between the drive-side<br>
member and the driven-side member of the clutch.<br>
Therefore, for example, in case the related clutch<br>
controller continues to control the clutch in the same<br>
manner as above even after the drive-side member and the<br>
driven-side member have worn out and thus the friction<br>
coefficient thereof has changed from the original friction<br>
coefficient, sufficient torque transmission is not<br>
provided from the drive-side member to the driven-side<br>
member. Consequently, the vehicle can decelerate<br>
excessively during engaging operation of the clutch.<br>
Also, in case the drive-side member and the driven-side<br>
member are subjected to thermal expansion, the drive-side<br>
member and the driven-side member are engaged in a time<br>
period shorter than the original time period. This causes<br>
shocks to be generated at the time when these members are<br>
completely engaged. The above-mentioned clutch controller<br>
10 controls the engagement state of the clutch 40 based on<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac actually transmitted to<br>
the driven-side member 42, thus reducing deterioration of<br>
the riding comfort due to the aging or thermal expansion<br>
of the clutch.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-<br>
mentioned clutch controller 10, and can have various<br>
alternatives.<br>
56<br><br>
For example, in the above description, the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie actuates the clutch actuator<br>
14 based on the difference between the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque Tac or the<br>
torque deviation AT. However, for example, the storage<br>
unit 12 may store a table that establishes the<br>
correspondence between the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
and the clutch position (for example, the rotation angle<br>
of the output shaft of the clutch actuator 14) detected by<br>
the clutch position detector 21. Then, referring to the<br>
table, the clutch actuator control section lie may actuate<br>
the clutch actuator 14 such that the clutch position or<br>
the rotation angle of the output shaft of the clutch<br>
actuator 14 corresponds to the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg calculated by the aforementioned processing.<br>
In the above description, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac is defined as torque transmitted from the<br>
drive-side member 41 to the driven-side member 42.<br>
However, the actual transmission torque Tac may be defined<br>
as torque transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the<br>
countershaft 55 via the gearbox 51 or torque transmitted<br>
to the driven-side member 57b of the transmission<br>
mechanism 57 via the gearbox 51 and the countershaft 55.<br>
In this case, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
considers the speed reduction ratio of the gearbox 51 for<br>
57<br><br>
calculating the actual transmission torque Tac. More<br>
specifically, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
multiplies the difference between the aforementioned EG<br>
torque TEac and EG-side inertia torque TIac by the speed<br>
reduction ratio Mratio of the gearbox 51 after the clutch<br>
40 is engaged. In the same manner, the target toque<br>
obtaining section lib multiplies the difference between<br>
the post-completion EG torque TEfin and the post-<br>
completion EG-side inertia torque TIfin by the speed<br>
reduction ratio Mratio of the gearbox 51 after the clutch<br>
40 is engaged, in order to calculate the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
In addition, in the above description, the control<br>
unit 11 obtains the actual transmission torque Tac and the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg in the separate processing<br>
steps, and obtains the command actuation amount of the<br>
clutch actuator 14 based on the obtained actual<br>
transmission torque Tac and target transmission torque<br>
Ttg. However, for example, the storage unit 12 may store<br>
in advance an expression that associates the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop, the engine speed fie, the EG speed<br>
variation dfie / dt, the driven-side rotational speed<br>
variation dficl / dt, and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference fidiff with the command actuation amount. Thus,<br>
the control unit 11 may substitute a detected value into<br>
58<br><br>
the expression to directly calculate the command actuation<br>
amount.<br>
Further, in the above description, the command<br>
actuation amount of the clutch actuator 14 corresponds to<br>
the torque deviation AT, and the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie actuates the clutch actuator 14 by an amount<br>
corresponding to the torque deviation AT. However, the<br>
clutch actuator control section lie may execute<br>
proportional integral derivative (PID) control, for<br>
example. Specifically, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie calculates the torque deviation AT, while<br>
calculating a differential value of the calculated torque<br>
deviation AT with respect to time. The clutch actuator<br>
control section lie also calculates an integral value of<br>
the calculated torque deviation AT with respect to time.<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section lie may<br>
calculate the command actuation amount based on the torque<br>
deviation AT and based on the calculated differential<br>
value and integral value.<br>
Still further, in the above-mentioned processing, the<br>
target torque obtaining section lib estimates the torque<br>
to be transmitted to the driven-side member 42 after the<br>
drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are<br>
completely engaged, and defines the estimated torque as<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. However, the target<br>
59<br><br>
torque obtaining section lib may set the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value depending on the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop detected by the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17, when the vehicle starts-up or is<br>
running at lower-speeds below a predetermined value. This<br>
processing is executed as follows, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop by the rider and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg (hereinafter the table is referred to as target<br>
transmission torque table). Then, the target torque<br>
obtaining section lib refers to the target transmission<br>
torque table to obtain the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
that corresponds to the accelerator displacement Aop<br>
detected based on the request torque signal.<br>
Alternatively, the storage unit 12 may store an expression<br>
that represents the relationship between the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop by the rider and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg. Thus, the target torque obtaining section lib<br>
may substitute the detected accelerator displacement Aop<br>
into the expression to obtain the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
FIG. 10 is a graph showing the relationship between<br>
the accelerator displacement Aop and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg obtained from this processing. In<br>
60<br><br>
the graph, the horizontal axis represents the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop, and the vertical axis represents the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. This graph shows that .as<br>
the accelerator displacement Aop increases, the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg increases, accordingly. Also,<br>
when the accelerator displacement Aop is lower than a<br>
predetermined value Al, the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
is preset at a negative value.<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section lie obtains<br>
the command actuation amount of the clutch actuator 14<br>
based on the torque deviation AT or the difference between<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac obtained by the aforementioned<br>
actual torque obtaining section 11a. In this processing,<br>
for example, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
refers to the aforementioned actuation amount relational<br>
expression to obtain the command actuation amount that<br>
corresponds to the torque deviation AT.<br>
As described above, the clutch actuator 14 is provided<br>
that is capable of being actuated in the engagement<br>
direction to engage the clutch 40 or in the disengagement<br>
direction to disengage the clutch 40. The clutch actuator<br>
control section lie actuates the clutch actuator 14 in<br>
either of the directions determined based on the torque<br>
deviation AT and the clutch rotational speed difference<br>
61<br><br>
Qdiff. Specifically, under the operating condition that<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is positive<br>
(under the operating condition that the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41 is higher than the rotational<br>
speed of the driven-side member 42), if the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is lower than the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie actuates the clutch actuator 14 in the<br>
engagement direction. Thereby, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac increases, approximating the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. In other words, when the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the engagement direction under<br>
such operating condition, the engine speed Qe decreases.<br>
Generally, the engine output characteristics show that the<br>
EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed Qe decreases.<br>
In addition, the EG-side inertia torque TIac (TIac = I x<br>
dQe / dt) is a negative value. Therefore, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac increases (see the expression<br>
(1)), approximating the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
If the actual transmission torque Tac exceeds the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg under such operating condition,<br>
the clutch actuator control section lie actuates the<br>
clutch actuator 14 in the disengagement direction.<br>
Thereby, the actual transmission torque Tac decreases.<br>
In contrast, under the operating condition that the<br>
62<br><br>
clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is negative<br>
(under the operating condition that the rotational speed<br>
of the driven-side member 42 is higher than the rotational<br>
speed of the drive-side member 41), if the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg is lower than the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie actuates the clutch actuator 14 in the<br>
engagement direction. Thereby, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac decreases, approximating the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Under such operating condition,<br>
when the clutch actuator 14 is actuated in the engagement<br>
direction, the engine speed Qe increases in contrast to<br>
the aforementioned operating condition. In view of the<br>
engine output characteristics, the EG torque TEac<br>
decreases as the engine speed Qe increases. In addition,<br>
the EG-side inertia torque TIac is a positive value.<br>
Thus, the actual transmission torque Tac decreases,<br>
approximating the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
This processing is executed as follows, for example.<br>
The clutch actuator control section lie selectively uses<br>
either one of actuation amount relational expressions: The<br>
one expression is established such that the actuation<br>
amount of the clutch actuator 14 increases in the<br>
engagement direction as the torque deviation AT (AT = Ttg<br>
- Tac) increases (hereinafter the expression is referred<br>
63<br><br>
to as engagement actuation amount relational expression<br>
(for example, the expression representing the relationship<br>
shown in FIG. 6) ) . The other expression is established<br>
such that the actuation amount of the clutch actuator 14<br>
increases in the disengagement direction as the torque<br>
deviation AT increases (hereinafter the expression is<br>
referred to as disengagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression) . FIG. 11 is a graph showing the relationship<br>
between the command actuation amount represented by the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression and<br>
the torque deviation AT. As shown in FIG. 11, in the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression, the<br>
command actuation amount is preset such that if the torque<br>
deviation AT is a negative value, the clutch actuator 14<br>
is actuated in the direction to engage the clutch 40.<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
calculates the clutch rotational speed difference fldiff<br>
based on the signals inputted from the clutch rotational<br>
speed detectors 23a, 23b. If the calculated clutch<br>
rotational speed difference Qdiff is a positive value (if<br>
the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41 is higher<br>
than the rotational speed of the driven-side member 42),<br>
the clutch actuator control section lie uses the<br>
engagement actuation amount relational expression to<br>
obtain the command actuation amount of the clutch actuator<br>
64<br><br>
14. In contrast, if the calculated clutch rotational<br>
speed difference Qdiff is a negative value, the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie uses the disengagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression to obtain the<br>
command actuation amount of the clutch actuator 14.<br>
Thereby, an engine brake is applied by the .rider<br>
setting the accelerator displacement at close to 0 at<br>
vehicle start-up. More specifically, in the target<br>
transmission torque table shown in FIG. 10, when the<br>
accelerator displacement is 0, the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg is a negative value. Thus, at vehicle start-<br>
up, if the clutch 40 is disengaged and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is 0, then the torque deviation AT<br>
is a negative value. In turn, when the vehicle is<br>
running downslope, the rotational speed of the driven-side<br>
member 42 can be higher than the rotational speed of the<br>
drive-side member 41. In this case, the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie uses the disengagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression to obtain the command<br>
actuation amount, by which the clutch actuator 14 is<br>
actuated in the engagement direction, based on the<br>
negative torque deviation AT (for example, Diffl in FIG.<br>
11) obtained by subtracting the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac from the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
Consequently, an engine brake is applied.<br>
65<br><br>
Alternatively, the processing for obtaining the<br>
command actuation amount in such a manner by selectively<br>
using either the engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression or the disengagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression, depending on whether the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference Qdiff is positive or negative,<br>
may be executed in the aforementioned processing executed<br>
at gear shifting. Thereby, in the case that the<br>
accelerator displacement is small even at gear shifting<br>
and the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is<br>
negative, an engine brake is applied.<br>
Further alternatively, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie may select either one of the engagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression and the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression based<br>
on the rotational speed of the mechanism upstream of the<br>
drive-side member 41 (for example, the engine speed Qe)<br>
and based on the rotational speed of the downstream<br>
transmission mechanism downstream of the driven-side<br>
member 42, rather than based on the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference Qdiff. For example, the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie may compare a value, which is obtained<br>
by multiplying the engine speed Qe by the speed reduction<br>
ratio Pratio of the primary speed reducing mechanism 36,<br>
with a value, which is obtained by multiplying the vehicle<br>
66<br><br>
speed by the speed reduction ratios of the gearbox 51 and<br>
the transmission mechanism 57, and based on the comparison<br>
result, may determine whether or not the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference Qdiff is positive or negative.<br>
Now, description is made of a flow of the processing<br>
executed by the control unit 11 according to the<br>
embodiment of the invention. FIG. 12 is a flowchart<br>
showing an example of the processing executed by the<br>
control unit 11 according to the embodiment of the<br>
invention. Here, the processing at vehicle start-up is<br>
described as an example.<br>
The control unit 11 determines whether or not the<br>
vehicle conditions satisfy predetermined start-up<br>
conditions (S201). The start-up conditions are that: for<br>
example, the clutch 40 is disengaged, with the gearbox 51<br>
set in a position other than neutral position; and the<br>
engine speed Qe and the accelerator displacement Aop are<br>
equal to or greater than their respective predetermined<br>
values. Alternatively, the start-up conditions may be<br>
that: the clutch 40 is disengaged with the gearbox 51 set<br>
in a position other than neutral position; and a value,<br>
which is obtained by subtracting the rotational speed of<br>
the driven-side member 42 from the rotational speed of the<br>
drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40, is a negative<br>
value. Further alternatively, continuation of these<br>
67<br><br>
conditions for a given time period or longer may also be a<br>
predetermined start-up condition.<br>
In the determination in the step S201, if the vehicle<br>
conditions satisfy the start-up conditions, the target<br>
torque obtaining section lib detects the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop based on the request torque signal of the<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, and refers to the<br>
aforementioned target transmission torque table to obtain<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg that corresponds to the<br>
accelerator displacement Aop (S202).<br>
In turn, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
obtains the actual transmission torque Tac currently<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the driven-<br>
side member 42 (step S203). Further, the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie calculates the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff based on the signals inputted from the<br>
clutch rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b. Depending on<br>
a positive or negative value of the calculated clutch<br>
rotational speed difference Qdiff, the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie selects either one of the<br>
aforementioned engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression and disengagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression (step S204).<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section lie obtains<br>
the command actuation amount based on the clutch<br>
68<br><br>
rotational speed difference Qdiff and the torque deviation<br>
AT (S205). Specifically, if the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff is negative, the clutch actuator control<br>
section lie substitutes the torque deviation AT into the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression in<br>
order to obtain the command actuation amount. In<br>
contrast, if the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff<br>
is positive, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
substitutes the torque deviation AT into the engagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression in order to obtain<br>
the command actuation amount. Then, the clutch actuator<br>
control section lie outputs a signal to the clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 15 according to the command<br>
actuation amount (S206). This allows the clutch 40, which<br>
has been disengaged, to be in a half-clutch state.<br>
After that, the clutch actuator control section lie<br>
calculates the clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff<br>
based on the signals inputted from the clutch rotational<br>
speed detectors 23a, 23b, and determines whether or not<br>
the calculated clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff is<br>
smaller than the speed difference for discontinuing half-<br>
clutch (S207). In this step, if the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference Qdiff is equal to or greater than the<br>
speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the<br>
control unit 11 returns to the step S202 to execute the<br>
69<br><br>
subsequent processing steps again. Then, when the clutch<br>
40 is in a half-clutch state, the control unit 11 executes<br>
the steps S202 to S206 in a predetermined cycle. This<br>
allows the actual transmission torque Tac to follow the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg, so that the rider can<br>
obtain acceleration as required. In contrast, in the<br>
determination in the step S207, if the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference Qdiff is smaller than the speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch<br>
actuator control section lie actuates the clutch actuator<br>
14 to completely engage the drive-side member 41 with the<br>
driven-side member 42 and discontinue the half-clutch<br>
state of the clutch 40 (S208). The aforementioned<br>
processing is an example of the processing executed by the<br>
control unit 11 at vehicle start-up.<br>
In the above-mentioned clutch controller 10, the<br>
target torque obtaining section lib obtains the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg according to the accelerator<br>
displacement Aop. This allows torque to be transmitted to<br>
the axle 3a according to the rider's request, even in the<br>
case where the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42 are subjected to wear-out or thermal expansion,<br>
so that operability of the vehicle improves particularly<br>
at vehicle start-up and low-speed running.<br>
The motorcycle 1 is provided with the engine 30 as a<br>
70<br><br>
driving source. Alternatively, the driving source may be<br>
an electric motor or a hybrid engine combining an electric<br>
motor and an engine.<br>
In addition, in the above description, the clutch<br>
controller 10 and the clutch 40 apply to the motorcycle 1.<br>
However, the above-mentioned clutch controller may apply<br>
to four-wheeled automobiles having a mechanical clutch or<br>
machinery that outputs torque, outputted from the driving<br>
source, via the mechanical clutch to run constantly (for<br>
example, industrial machinery and agricultural machinery).<br>
