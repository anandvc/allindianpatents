Disposable breast cup set Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a disposable breast cup set according to the preamble of patent claim 1.<br>
Prior art<br>
Breast cup sets of this kind are used together with breast pumps to pump off human breast milk. They normally comprise a breast cup funnel which is connected via a breast cup attachment part to a coupling part. The coupling part can be screwed onto a milk collection receptacle, preferably a baby's milk bottle made of glass or plastic. The breast cup attachment part can either be connected to a mechanical pump mechanism or it has a connector piece for a connection tube that can be attached to an electrical breast pump. A breast cup set of this kind is described in US-A-6,461,324, for example.<br>
These breast cup sets are. usually made of plastic. They can often be sterilized and autoclaved and can therefore be used more than once. However, increased hygiene demands, both in hospital use and in domestic use, have in recent years heightened the need for a disposable and therefore inexpensive breast cup set.<br>
Disposable sets are indeed already known. However, these can nevertheless be used a number of times, which in some cases is also done for reasons of cost. Moreover, US-A-6,575,202 discloses a breast cup set with a collection receptacle, where the collection receptacle itself can be disposed of, but not the remaining elements.<br><br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to make available a breast cup set that satisfies the increased hygiene demands and nevertheless can be produced inexpensively.<br>
This object is achieved by a disposable breast cup set having the features of patent claim 1.<br>
The breast cup set according to the invention comprises a coupling part for connection to a milk collection receptacle, and a breast cup attachment part for connection to a breast cup funnel, the coupling part and the breast cup attachment part being connected to one another via an irreversibly destructible connection in the form of a tamper-evident element. The tamper-evident element is designed in such a way that the connection between the breast cup attachment part and the coupling part is basically destroyed irreversibly the first time the coupling part and the breast cup attachment part are separated or the first time the tamper-evident element is removed. This can be done, for example, by the tamper-evident element being removed, detached, torn open, pulled off or the like.<br>
The first time they have been separated, the coupling part and the breast cup attachment part cannot be connected to one another again or, if they can, at least not very well. Since separation for the first time is necessary in order to store the milk or administer the milk, both parts can be used just one time for pumping off milk.<br>
The expression tamper-evident element is therefore to be understood in the present case as an element which is in intact form on the unused device, that is to say on the unused breast cup set, and which is also<br><br>
— 3 —<br>
normally left in thiis state while the breast milk is being pumped off.<br>
However, at the time when the user has finished pumping off the milk, or the collection receptacle is full, and wishes to use or store the breast milk collected in the collection receptacle, it is necessary to manipulate this tamper-evident element in order to remove the upper part of the breast cup set. To achieve the possibility of removing the upper part, that is to say the breast cup attachment part, the tamper-evident element has to be manipulated in a way that irreversibly breaks or tears open the connection, so that it is basically destroyed.<br>
For this purpose, the tamper-evident element has a predetermined break point, for example, which is broken or torn open in order to separate the parts from one another. The connection between the breast cup attachment part and the coupling part is also preferably designed such that, after the tamper-evident element has been broken open, these two parts cannot any longer be readily connected to on&amp; another.<br>
It must be emphasized that the tamper-evident element is not to be understood as meaning some kind of element that can be destroyed by application of force. The tamper-evident element, as it is understood here, is an element that is irreversibly destroyed when the breast cup set is handled in the intended manner, i.e. in which the irreversible destruction of the element, in addition to having a connection function between breast cup attachment part and coupling part, is the actual objective and occurs when the set is handled in the manner intended.<br>
In construction terms, this is reflected by the fact that, without irreversible destruction of the tamper-evident element, it is not at all possible to separate<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
the breast cup attachment part and coupling part from one another and, for example, to remove the contents of the collection vessel or to store them without a cover. The coupling part and breast cup attachment part can therefore only be separated from one another in the intended manner when the tamper-evident element has first been irreversibly destroyed. It is also possible for several tamper-evident elements to be provided.<br>
Therefore, the tamper-evident element within the meaning of the invention is not an element which is provided per se for such a tamper-proofing function and which can only be irreversibly destroyed by inappropriate forceful manipulation.<br>
This tamper-evident element is comparable, for example, to a seal and, accordingly, it can take the form of a paper strip, plastic strip or corresponding bands that are provided at a dividing line between the breast cup attachment part and the coupling part. The tamper-evident element can thus, for example, be adhesively bonded as a paper strip onto the breast cup attachment part and the coupling part.<br>
In the simplest, embodiment, the breast cup set according to the invention comprises, within the meaning of the invention, the coupling part, the breast cup attachment part: and the tamper-evident element, said coupling part and breast cup attachment part being able to be connected to the breast cup funnel or to the milk collection receptacle, respectively, in a releasable or nonreleasable manner or are already connected to them. Depending on the embodiment, the breast cup set can have additional elements. For example, the coupling part and breast cup attachment part can be formed integrally with other parts, in particular the collection receptacle and the breast cup.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
If the coupling part is connected to or integrally formed on a milk collection receptacle in a manner that does not allow it to be released without being destroyed, this also ensures that the milk collection receptacle is only then used for storing or for administering the milk and cannot be used again for collecting new milk.<br>
The coupling part is preferably designed as a separate part and is only connected to the collection receptacle shortly before use. In this way, the collection receptacle can be made in the form of a beaker and can thus be stacked. This embodiment has the advantage that the space required for transport and storage of the breast cup set is less than in a one-piece set or a ready-assembled set.<br>
The breast cup funnel, with the funnel element applied to the breast, can preferably be connected to the breast cup attachment part in a releasable manner. The breast cup funnel can preferably be plugged into the breast cup attachment part. This also has the advantage of reducing the space required for transport and storage. Moreover, depending on the shape and size of the breast, different breast cup funnel shapes and sizes can be used, without the rest of the set having to be adapted. This reduces the production costs and once again saves on space.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the breast cup set is provided with a disposable valve that reduces the dead volume in the set and thus increases the efficiency of the suction process.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments are set out in the dependent patent claims.<br><br>

Embodiments of the invention<br>
A first illustrative embodiment of the disposable breast cup set according to the invention is shown in Figures la to lk. The individual parts are preferably-made of plastic.<br>
As is shown in Figure la, a milk collection receptacle 1 is connected to a breast cup attachment part 3 via a coupling part 2. A breast cap funnel 5 is held in the breast cup attachment part 3 and is applied to a<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
mother's breast when breast milk is being pumped off. The breast cup attachment part 3 has a pump-side connector piece 32 to which a first end of a connection tube 6 can be attached. A second end 60 of the connection tube 6 can be connected to an electrical or mechanical breast pump (not shown here) or to a central vacuum (that is to say a ready-to-use suction unit). The breast pump generates an underpressure in a cyclical rhythm in the breast cup, such that the breast is stimulated and milk can pass through the breast cup attachment part 3 into the collection receptacle 1.<br>
As can be seen from Figure lb, a nonreturn valve 7 is preferably present in the area between breast cup attachment part 3 and collection receptacle 1. This valve 7 closes the receptacle-side inlet opening 3 5 of the breast cap attachment part 3 and thus reduces to a minimum the dead volume that has to be evacuated by means of the pump.<br>
According to the invention, a tamper-evident element 4 is provided which connects the breast cup attachment part 3 and the coupling part 2 to one another. A suitable tamper-evident element takes the form of any type of connection thab irreversibly destroys the connection between the breast cup attachment part 3 and the coupling part 2 the first time these two parts are separated or the first time it is removed.<br>
This tamper-evident element 4 is preferably a tear-open seal, for example a circumferential band which is connected to the coupling part 2 and to the breast cup attachment part 3 via thin webs 41 that tear at the moment of separation. The tamper-evident element 4 is usually also made of plastic and is injection molded onto one of the two parts or onto both parts 2, 3.<br>
The tamper-evident element 4 preferably has a protruding tab 4 0 so that it can be easily gripped by<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
hand and can be easily torn open. This is shown in<br>
Figure lc.<br>
The individual parts of the breast cup set that have been mentioned above can be designed in one or more pieces. Two or more of these parts can also be integrally formed.<br>
As can be seen in Figure lb, the first illustrative embodiment consists of several individual parts. The collection receptacle 1 is a cylindrical beaker which, at its upper edge, has a first lower snap-fit closure element 11 in the form of a circumferential bead. At its lower edge, the coupling part 2 has a first upper snap-fit closure element 20 in the form of a circumferential latch. When these two elements are plugged together/ the latch engages round the bead and thus forms a secure connection between coupling part 2 and collection receptacle 1.<br>
In this embodiment, the breast cup attachment part 3 is designed in two pieces. It has an upper element 3' with a receptacle-side connector piece 3 0 and a funnel-side connector piece 31. The breast cup funnel 5 has a funnel element 50 for application to the breast, and a funnel connector 51 which can be fixedly attached or can be plugged into the funnel side connector piece 31 and can also be easily removed again from this.<br>
A lower element 3' of the breast cup attachment part 3 is connected to the coupling part 2 via the tamper-evident element 4.<br>
The valve 7, here consisting of a valve membrane 70 and of a valve body 71, is preferably fitted on the lower edge of the receptacle-side connector piece 30, as can be seen clearly from Figure Id.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
Arranged on the receptacle-side connector piece 30, there is a second upper snap-fit closure element 3 3 whose mating piece 34 is formed on the lower element 3' ' . This can be readily seen in Figure Id. The second upper snap-fit closure element 33 is preferably formed by an upper and lower circtimferential latch that hooks securely onto a connector piece protruding into the opening of the coupling part 2. Preferably, this connection between the upper and lower elements 3, 3' cannot be undone without being destroyed, so that, as can be seen in Figures le, If and lg, the coupling part 2 and the breast cup attachment part 3 form one unit connected by the tamper-evident element 4.<br>
If the tamper-evident element 4 is now removed, the entire breast cup attachment part 3, i.e. the upper and lower elements 3, 3', comes away from the coupling part 2, as can be seen in Figure lh. This separation means that, when the parts are joined again, it is not possible to obtain a sufficiently good connection any longer, so that this combination cannot be used again for pumping off milk.<br>
However, a beaker-shaped collection receptacle l is left together with an attached coupling part 2, and these together form a baby's bottle. The coupling part 2 forms a bottle neck. Since it is provided under the tamper-evident element 4 with an external thread 21, the bottle can be closed by a lid 8 until it is used. This is shown in Figure li. At the time of use, the lid 8 can be removed, and a top with a teat can be applied in the known manner.<br>
In a second embodiment of the breast cup set according to the invention, shown in Figures 2a to 2c, the breast cup attachment part 3 is in one piece and the tamper-evident element 4 is formed integrally on it. Here once again, a snap-fit closure and a tamper-evident band ensure an irreversibly destructible connection with the<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
coupling part 2. In this embodiment, the collection receptacle 1 and the coupling part 2 are formed by a one-piece bottle. In another variant, however, they are designed in two pieces according to Figure lb. In this example too, the breast cup funnel 5 can be pushed into the breast cup attachment part 3 at the time of use.<br>
In the illustrative embodiment according to Figures 3a to 3c, the breast cup funnel 5 and the breast cup attachment part 3 are formed together in one piece. The tamper-evident element 4 is formed on the lower edge of the breast cup attachment part 3. In this example too, the collection receptacle 1 and the coupling part 2 can be formed by a one-piece bottle or they can form separate parts. In this example, the collection receptacle 1 does not have a round cross section, but a rectangular, in particular square cross section. This means it can be stored taking up less space than round bottles. Of course, the two-part bottles described above can also have such a rectangular or square shape.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 4 shows a breast cup attachment part and a coupling part connected integrally to one another. In this case too, the tamper-evident element is injection molded.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figures 5a and 5b, the valve 7 is not arranged on the receptacle-side connector piece 30, but on a mating piece 34 protruding into the coupling part 2. The valve body 71 can be fitted onto or integrally formed on this mating piece 34.<br>
The valve 7 can have a wide variety of shapes. In the embodiments described above, in particular in Figure Ik, a valve 7 is disclosed which has a cylindrical valve body 71 and a membrane 70 covering this valve body 71. The valve body 71 is preferably made of a rigid material, in particular plastic. The membrane 70<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
is made of a flexible material, preferably rubber, caoutchouc or silicone or TPE.<br>
The valve 7 is fixed in its position by the valve body 71 being pushed over a stub. On a front face, the valve body 71 has through-openings 72 and a centrally arranged receiver opening 73. Matching this, the membrane has a preferably centrally arranged connection button 74 which can be plugged into the receiver opening 73 in order to secure the membrane.<br>
However, other valves can also be used in the above-described embodiments of the breast cup set. Thus, as is shown in Figure 6, a membrane receiver 78 in the form of a connection button can be arranged on the valve body 71, and the receiver opening 73 in the membrane 70.<br>
As is shown in Figures 7a to 7c, the membrane 70 can also be connected integrally to the valve body 71 via a hinge or a lip 75. In this case, the valve 7 is preferably made of a uniform material, the membrane having a thinner wall than the valve body.<br>
Moreover, the valve body 7 according to Figures 8a and 8b can be designed not with a closed jacket, but with a jacket that is open at one end. In this way, the two jacket parts 76 can be made resilient, which on the one hand makes it easier to fit the valve 7 in place and on the other hand improves its fit on the connector piece 30.<br>
In another embodiment according to Figures 9a to 9c, the membrane 7 0 is integrally formed on the valve body 71 via a web 77, the two inner faces of the membrane and the inner faces of the valve body lying flush in one plane.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
The breast cup set according to the invention can be produced inexpensively and, by virtue of its individual parts, can be provided in a sterile package that takes up little space. It additionally permits the use of the collection receptacle as a baby's bottle and yet ensures that it is impossible to reuse the set for pumping off breast milk.<br><br>
