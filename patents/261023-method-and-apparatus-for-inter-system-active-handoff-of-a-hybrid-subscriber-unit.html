conditions associated with one such network may be more favorable than the channel<br>
conditions associated with the other such network due to such factors as fading, adjacent<br>
and co-channel interference, and available power at a serving base station (BS) or radio<br>
access network (RAN). By way of another example, an operator of both a packet<br>
switched CDMA network and a circuit switched CDMA network may desire to move the<br>
subscriber unit from one such network to the other such network for purposes of<br>
balancing system loading.<br>
	Currently, the only defined method for executing a handoff between a packet<br>
switched CDMA or WLAN network and a circuit switched CDMA network is an<br>
execution of a hard handoff, wherein a subscriber unit must drop a radio resource of a<br>
network of a first CDMA technology prior to acquiring a radio resource of a network of a<br>
second CDMA technology. A result is a brief period of time during which the subscriber<br>
unit is not actively engaged in a communication session with either network. Further,<br>
when executing a hard handoff there is no linkage between the two networks as the<br>
subscriber unit must drop the first network and acquire the second network without any<br>
assistance from the BS or RAN of either network. As a result, voice traffic may be lost<br>
during the handoff, resulting in poor system performance and efficiency and disgruntled<br>
end users.<br>
	Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for an active handoff of a<br>
voice call between a packet switched CDMA or WLAN network and a circuit switched<br>
CDMA network that assures that the subscriber unit is actively engaged in a<br>
communication session with at least one network at all times.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
	To address the need for a method and apparatus for an active handoff of a voice<br>
call between a packet switched CDMA or WLAN network and a circuit switched CDMA<br>
network that assures that the subscriber unit is actively engaged in a communication<br>
session with at least one network at all times, a communication system is provided that<br>
provides for an active handoff of a voice call between a packet switched network, such as<br>
a CDMA 2000 1XRTT network, a CDMA 2000 1XEV-DO network, or a WLAN<br>
network, and a circuit switched network, preferably a CDMA IX network, by<br>
transmitting the call over both networks (herein referred to as multicasting) during the<br>
course of the handoffs. An active handoff from the packet switched network to the circuit<br>
switched network is accomplished by multicasting the call over forward links of both<br>
networks during the handoff. An active handoff from the circuit switched network to the<br>
packet switched network is accomplished by multicasting the call over reverse links of<br>
both networks during the handoff. The former handoff further may be facilitated by<br>
maintaining a packet data control switch of the packet switched network in the call even<br>
when the call is routed through the circuit switched network and the latter handoff further<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
4<br>
may be facilitated by maintaining a mobile switching center of the circuit switched<br>
network in the call even when the call is routed through the packet switched network. In<br>
order for a hybrid subscriber unit to operate concurrently in both networks, the subscriber<br>
unit may comprise multiple transceivers. However, in another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the hybrid subscriber unit may comprise a single transceiver that is rapidly<br>
switched between the networks to give the appearance of concurrent operation. In<br>
addition, when switching between networks, a vocoder in the single transceiver<br>
subscriber unit may be instructed by the processorto use a reduced rate that allows for the<br>
time for the rapid switching without severely degrading voice quality.<br>
	Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
handoff of a voice call from a packet switched network having a packet data control<br>
switch to a circuit switched network. The method includes conveying forward link voice<br>
traffic to, and receiving reverse link voice traffic from, a subscriber unit via the packet<br>
switched network and receiving, by the packet switched network, a notification to hand<br>
off the call to the circuit switched network. The method further includes, in response to<br>
receiving the handoff notification, conveying forward link voice traffic to the subscriber<br>
unit via the packet switched network and via the packet data control switch and the circuit<br>
switched network, and concurrently receiving reverse link voice traffic only via the<br>
packet switched network. The method further includes, when conveying forward link<br>
voice traffic to the subscriber unit via each of the packet switched network and the circuit<br>
switched network, switching from the packet switched network to the packet data control :<br>
switch and the circuit switched network for reception of reverse link voice traffic and, in<br>
response to switching from the packet switched network to the circuit switched network<br>
for reception of reverse link voice traffic, ceasing conveying forward link voice traffic to<br>
the subscriber unit via the packet data control switch and the packet switched network<br>
while continuing to convey forward link voice traffic to the subscriber unit via the packet<br>
data control switch and the circuit switched network.<br>
	Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a packet data control<br>
switch having a processor configured to, in association with a subscriber unit call, route<br>
forward link voice traffic and receive reverse link voice traffic via a packet switched<br>
network, receive a notification to hand off the call from the packet switched network to a<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
5<br>
circuit switched network, in response to receiving the handoff notification, route forward<br>
link voice traffic to the subscriber unit via both the packet switched network and the<br>
circuit switched network and concurrently receive reverse link voice traffic only via the<br>
packet switched network, when conveying forward link voice traffic to the subscriber unit<br>
via each of the packet switched network and the circuit switched network, switch<br>
reception of reverse link voice traffic from the packet switched network to the circuit<br>
switched network, and in response to switching reception of reverse link voice traffic<br>
from the packet switched network to the circuit switched network, cease routing forward<br>
link voice traffic to the subscriber unit via the packet switched network while continuing<br>
to route forward link voice traffic to the subscriber unit via the circuit switched network.<br>
	Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
handoff of a voice call from a circuit switched network to a packet switched network.<br>
The method includes conveying forward link voice traffic to, and receiving reverse link<br>
voice traffic from, a subscriber unit via the circuit switched network and determining, by<br>
the circuit switched network, to hand off the call. The method further includes notifying<br>
the packet switched network, by the circuit switched network, of the need for a handoff<br>
and, in response to receiving the handoff notification, conveying, by the packet switched<br>
network of the subscriber unit, a request to perform a handoff and establishing a<br>
communication session between the packet switched network and the subscriber unit.<br>
The method further includes receiving reverse link voice traffic from the subscriber unit<br>
via the circuit switched network and via the packet switched network, and concurrently<br>
conveying forward link voice traffic to the subscriber unit only via the circuit switched<br>
network and, when receiving reverse link voice traffic via the packet switched network<br>
and the circuit switched network, switching from the circuit switched network to the<br>
packet switched network for conveyance of forward link voice traffic to the subscriber<br>
unit. The method further includes, in response to switching forward link voice traffic<br>
from the packet switched network to the circuit switched network, ceasing reception of<br>
reverse link voice traffic via the circuit switched network while continuing to receive<br>
reverse link voice traffic via the packet switched network.<br>
	Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a communication<br>
system for inter-network handoff of a voice call from a circuit switched network to a<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
6<br>
packet switched network. The communication system includes a base station that<br>
transmits forward link voice traffic to a subscriber unit via a first forward link, receives<br>
reverse link voice traffic from the subscriber unit via a first reverse link from, and that<br>
determines to hand off the call. The communication system further includes a mobile<br>
switching center in communication with the base station that conveys the forward link<br>
voice traffic to the base station, receives the reverse link voice traffic from the base<br>
station, and that, in response to the determination to hand off the call, conveys a<br>
notification of the need for a handoff, and a packet data control switch that receives the<br>
handoff notification from the mobile switching center and, in response to receiving the<br>
handoff notification, requests that the subscriber unit perform a handoff. The<br>
communication system further includes an access network in communication with the<br>
packet data control switch that, in response to the request to perform a handoff,<br>
establishes a second forward link and a second reverse link with the subscriber unit. In<br>
response to the establishment of the second forward link and the second reverse link with<br>
the subscriber unit, each of the base station and the access network receives reverse link<br>
voice traffic from the subscriber unit while only the base station conveys forward link<br>
voice traffic to the subscriber unit. After each of the base station and the access network<br>
begins receiving reverse link voice traffic from the subscriber unit, conveyance of the<br>
forward link voice traffic to the subscriber unit is switched from the base station and the<br>
first forward link to the access network and the second forward link. In response to<br>
switching conveyance of forward link voice traffic from the base station and the first<br>
forward link to the access network and the second forward link, the base station ceases<br>
receiving reverse link voice traffic while the access network continues to receive reverse<br>
link voice traffic.<br>
	Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
handoff of a voice call from a packet switched network having a packet data control<br>
switch to a circuit switched network. The method includes communicating voice traffic<br>
via the packet switched network, receiving, by the packet switched network, a notification<br>
to hand off the call, wherein the notification to hand off identifies the circuit switched<br>
network as the network to hand off the call to, and in response to receiving the handoff<br><br>

notification, establishing communication via the circuit switched network and terminating<br>
communication via the packet switched network.<br>
	Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
handoff of a voice call from a packet switched network having a packet data control<br>
switch to a circuit switched network. The method includes communicating voice traffic<br>
via the packet switched network, determining, by subscriber unit, to hand off the call,<br>
transmitting a notification to hand off the call, wherein the notification to hand off<br>
identifies the circuit switched network as the network to hand off the call to, and in<br>
response to transmitting the handoff notification, establishing communication via the<br>
circuit switched network and terminating communication via the packet switched<br>
network.<br>
	Yet another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
emulating concurrent operation by a hybrid subscriber unit in each of a network<br>
associated with a first radio frequency (RF) technology and a network associated with a<br>
second RF technology. The method includes, when transmitting, alternating between<br>
transmission via a first air interface associated with the first RF technology and<br>
transmission via a second air interface associated with the second RF technology and,<br>
when receiving, alternating between reception via an air interface associated with the first<br>
RF technology and reception via an air interface associated with the second RF<br>
technology.<br>
	Still another embodiment of the present invention encompasses a hybrid<br>
subscriber unit capable of operating in each of a network associated with a first RF<br>
technology and a network associated with a second RF technology. The subscriber unit<br>
includes a transceiver for transmitting and receiving RF communications and a processor<br>
in communication with to the transceiver. The processor, when transmitting, alternates<br>
between transmission via an air interface associated with the first RF technology and<br>
transmission via an air interface associated with the second RF technology and, when<br>

	The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs. 1-7.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a wireless communication system 100 in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Communication system 100 includes a wireless IP<br>
(Internet Protocol)-based packet switched network 110 and a wireless circuit switched<br>
network 120. Packet switched network 110 includes a packet data control switch (PDCS)<br>
118 that is in communication with a packet-based wireless Access Network (AN) 114,<br>
such as a Radio Access Network (RAN) or a wireless local area network (WLAN) Access<br>
Point (AP), via a Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) 116. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, PDCS 118 may comprise one or more of a Mobile Switching Center<br>
Evolution-Emulation (MSCe) and a Media Gateway (MGW). In other embodiments of<br>
the present invention, PDCS 118 may further comprise, or be coupled to, one or more<br>
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers. PDCS 118 further provides transcoding<br>
functionality with respect to transcoding between the vocoder formats provided by<br>
subscriber unit 102 and the 64 kbps Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) format (ITU-T<br>
G.711) transported by PSTN 132. In still other embodiments of the present invention,<br>
PDCS 118 may comprise one or more SoftSwitch(es), which is available from Motorola,<br>
Inc., of Schaumburg, Illinois and other suppliers.<br>
	FIG. 2 is a block diagram of PDCS 118 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. PDCS 118 includes a processor 202, such as one or more<br>
microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs), combinations thereof<br>
or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill in the art, which processor is<br>
configured to execute the functions described herein as being executed by PDCS 118.<br>
PDCS 118 further includes at least one memory device 204 associated with processor<br>
202, such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM),<br>
and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that store data and programs that<br>
may be executed by the processor and that allow the PDCS to perform all functions<br>
necessary to operate in communication system 100.<br>
	Circuit switched network 120 includes a Base Station (BS) 124 that is in<br>
communication with a circuit switch-based Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 126. With<br>
respect to circuit switched network 120, MSC 126 is coupled to a respective Home<br>
Location Register (HLR) (not shown) and further is coupled to a respective Visited<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
9<br>
Location Register (VLR) (not shown) or is coupled to an Authentication, Authorization,<br>

PDCS's or MSC's respective network 110, 120, such as a profile of the subscriber unit,<br>
including the capabilities of the subscriber unit, and an AN or BS currently serving the<br>
subscriber unit. With respect to packet switched network 110, when Mobile IP (Internet<br>
Protocol) is used, macro-mobility is handled by a Home Agent (HA) (not shown) and a<br>
Foreign Agent (FA) (not shown) associated with PDSN 116 as is known in the art. When<br>
simple IP is used, there is no macro-mobility and micro-mobility is handled by a<br>
hierarchical arrangement of RANs, PSDNs, and PCFSs as is known in the art. AN 114<br>
and BS 124 each provides wireless communication services to the subscriber units<br>
located in a coverage area of the AN or BS via a respective air interface 112, 122; Each<br>
air interface 112, 122 includes a forward link that includes at least one forward link traffic<br>
channel and at least one forward link control channel. The forward link may or may not<br>
further include a paging channel. For example, in a CDMA 2000 1XEV-DO<br>
communication system the paging function is performed using a Route Update Protocol.<br>
Each air interface 112, 122 further includes a reverse link that includes at least one<br>
reverse link traffic channel, at least one reverse link signaling channel, and an access<br>
channel.<br>
	Packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network 120, and more<br>
particularly PDCS 118 and MSC 126, communicate with each other via an intermediate<br>
network 130 that operates in accordance with well-known intersystem protocols and<br>
preferably the protocols described in the 3GPP2 (Third Generation Partnership Project 2)<br>
TIA-41 (Telecommunications Industry Association-41) standard, that is, 3GPP2<br>
N.S0005. The TIA-41 standard provides standardized intersystem procedures for<br>
mobility management in cellular systems and prescribe messaging among Mobile<br>
Switching Centers, Home Location Registers (HLRs), Visited Location Registers (VLRs),<br>
Authentication Centers (ACs), and other core network elements of cellular systems in<br>
order to provide services to subscriber units when interaction is required between<br>
different cellular systems. Packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network<br><br>

120, and more particularly PDCS 118 and MSC 126, are each further coupled to a<br>
landline network 132, such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) that<br>
includes SS7 signaling.<br>
	Communication system 100 further includes a wireless subscriber unit (SU) 102,<br>
for example but not limited to a cellular telephone, a radiotelephone, or a Personal Digital<br>
Assistant (PDA), personal computer (PC), or laptop computer equipped for wireless voice<br>
communications. In various communications systems, subscriber unit 102 may also be<br>
referred to as an access terminal (AT), a mobile station (MS), or a user's equipment (UE).<br>
Subscriber unit 102 comprises a hybrid terminal that is capable of engaging in a Voice<br>
over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call with packet switched network 110 and is further<br>
capable of engaging in a conventional cellular call with circuit switched network 120, and<br>
more particularly is capable of communicating with PDCS 118 via the SIP protocols and<br>
with MSC 126 via the IS-2000 protocols.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 3, in one embodiment of the present invention, a hybrid<br>
subscriber unit 300, such as subscriber unit 102, capable of operating in communication<br>
system 100 may include multiple transceivers, that is, a first transceiver 302 for operation<br>
packet switched network 110 and a second transceiver 304 for operation in circuit<br>
switched network 120, thereby allowing the subscriber unit to concurrently transmit or<br>
receive in each of the two networks. Each transceiver is coupled to a vocoder 306 and a<br>
processor 308, which processor is further coupled to an at least one memory device 310.<br>

device 406. Processor 404 may cause transceiver 402 to rapidly switch between networks<br>
110 and 120 to give the appearance of concurrent operation. Further, subscriber unit 400<br>
may maintain apriori information in at least one memory device 406 that facilitates the<br>
switching between networks at optimum times. In addition, when switching between<br>
networks, a vocoder 408 coupled to a bus interconnecting each of transceiver 402,<br><br>

dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or<br>
equivalents thereof, that store data and programs that may be executed by the associated<br>
processor and that allow subscriber unit 102 to perform all functions necessary to operate<br>
in communication system 100.<br>
	In order for subscriber unit 102 to engaged in a voice call with a distant party 134<br>
via landline network 132 and one or more of packet switched network 110 and circuit<br>
switched network 120, each of subscriber unit 102, packet switched network 110, and<br>
circuit switched network 120 operates in accordance with well-known wireless<br>
telecommunications protocols. While distant party 134 is depicted as being connected to<br>
landline network 132, distant party 134 may be connected to any voice communication<br>
network, including packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network 120.<br>
Preferably, packet switched network 110 is a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)<br>
2000 communication system that provides VoIP communication services to subscribers<br>
serviced by the network and that operates in accordance with the 3GPP2 and TIA/EIA<br>
(Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association) IS-856 and<br>
3GPP2 C.S0024 standards, which provides a compatibility standard for CDMA 2000<br>
1XEV-DO (IX Evolution Data Only) systems. Preferably, circuit switched network 120<br>
is a CDMA 2000 communication system that provides circuit switched communication<br>
services to subscribers serviced by the network and that operates in accordance with the<br>
CDMA IX standards.<br>
	Further, air interface 122, and correspondingly network 120 and subscriber unit<br>
102, preferably operates in accordance with the TIA/EIA (Telecommunications Industry<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
12<br>
Association/Electronic Industries Association) one or more of the IS-95 and TIA-2000<br>
standards, or Inter Operability Specifications (IOSs), which provide a compatibility<br>
standard for cellular mobile telecommunications systems that operate as a CDMA 2000<br>
system. In addition, air interface 112, and correspondingly network 110 and again<br>
subscriber unit 102, preferably operates in accordance with one or more of the IS-95,<br>
TIA-2000, TIA-2001 (3GPP2 A.S0011 to A.S0017), or TIA-878 and TIA-1878 (A.s0007<br>
and A.S0008) standards, or Inter Operability Specifications (IOSs), which provide a<br>
compatibility standard for cellular mobile telecommunications systems that operate as a<br>
CDMA 2000 1XEV-DO, 1XEV-DV, or 1XRTT system. To ensure compatibility, radio<br>
system parameters and call processing procedures are specified by the standards,<br>
including call processing steps that are executed by an MS and a base station serving the<br>
MS and between the BS and associated infrastructure in order to establish a call or<br>
execute a handoff. However, those of ordinary skill in the art realize that packet switched<br>
network 110 may operate in accordance with any one of a variety of wireless packet data<br>
communication systems that provide VoIP communication services, such as a Wireless<br>
Local Area Network (WLAN) communication system as described by the IEEE (Institute<br>
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.XX standards, for example, the 802.11,<br>
802.15, 802.16, or 802.20 standards, and that circuit switched network 120 may operate<br>
in accordance with any one of a variety of well-known conventional wireless<br>
telecommunication systems that provide circuit switched communication services.<br>
	In communication system 100, subscriber unit 102 may roam through the system<br>
when the subscriber unit is engaged in a voice call. As a result of the roaming, situations<br>
may arise where it is desirable to hand off subscriber unit 102 from packet switched<br>
network 110 to circuit switched network 120 or from circuit switched network 120 to<br>
packet switched network 110. For example and as is known in the art, while roaming in<br>
communication system 100 and being serviced by AN 114, subscriber unit 102 may<br>
receive a stronger signal from BS 124 or, while being serviced by BS 124, subscriber unit<br>
102 may receive a stronger signal from AN 114. Typically signal strengths are<br>
determined by a subscriber unit, such as subscriber unit 102, measuring a pilot channel<br>
associated with the AN or BS. When a pilot channel of a serving AN or BS is weaker<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
13<br>
than a threshold value and a pilot channel of another AN or BS, that typically indicates a<br>
desirability of a handoff.<br>
	By way of another example, the costs associated with operating subscriber unit<br>
102 on packet switched network 110 may be different from the costs associated with<br>
operating subscriber unit 102 on circuit switched network 120. In turn, an operator (or<br>
operators) of networks 110 and 120 may charge a different fee for use of each network.<br>
As a result, a user of subscriber unit 102 may program into the subscriber a directive to<br>
operate on the lower cost network whenever the subscriber unit is able to obtain a traffic<br>
channel in the lower cost network. When subscriber unit 102 is engaged in a voice call in<br>
a higher cost network and is able to obtain a traffic channel in the lower cost network, the<br>
subscriber unit, or the user of the subscriber unit if the user is informed of the availability<br>
of a traffic channel in the lower cost network, may initiate a handoff to the lower cost<br>
network.<br>
	By way of yet another example, it may be desirable to move a subscriber unit,<br>
such as subscriber unit 102, that is actively engaged in a voice call in circuit switched<br>
network 120 to packet switched network 110 when the user of subscriber unit 102 prefers<br>
to use video telephony service rather than a voice call, and packet switched network 110<br>
supports video telephony but circuit switched network 120 does not.<br>
	By way of yet another example, for load leveling purposes, for network cost<br>
consideration purposes, or due to a need to clear traffic channels in a coverage area in<br>
order to facilitate emergency communications, an operator of a communication system<br>
such as communication system 100 may find it desirable to move a subscriber unit, such<br>
as subscriber unit 102, that is actively engaged in a voice call in a first network, such as<br>
packet switched network 110 or circuit switched network 120, to the other network.<br>
	In order to facilitate a handoff of a subscriber unit such as subscriber unit 102,<br>
communication system 100 provides a method and apparatus for an active handoff of<br>
subscriber unit 102 from packet switched network 110 to circuit switched network 120 or<br>
from circuit switched network 120 to packet switched network 110 when the subscriber<br>
unit is actively engaged in a voice call. By providing for an active handoff of a voice call<br>
between a packet switched CDMA network and a circuit switched CDMA network,<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
14<br>
communication system 100 assures that subscriber unit 102 is actively engaged in a<br>
communication session with at least one of networks 110 and 120 at all times, thereby<br>
minimizing the likelihood that voice traffic may be lost during the handoff.<br>
	FIG. 5 is a signal flow diagram 500 of a handoff executed by communication<br>
system 100 in handing off a voice call from packet switched network 110 to circuit<br>
switched network 120 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Signal flow diagram 500 begins when subscriber unit 102 is actively engaged in a VoIP<br>
call with distant party 134 via packet switched network 110 and landline network 132. In<br>
order to participate in a VoIP call via packet switched network 110, subscriber unit 102<br>
must already be registered with the packet switched network. As part of the call, a SIP<br>
session and a Real Time Protocol (RTP) session are active between subscriber unit 102<br>
and PDCS 118. When PDCS 118 comprises an MSCe and an MGW, the SIP session is<br>
active between subscriber unit 102 and the MSCe and the RTP session is active between<br>
the subscriber unit and the MGW. SIP is described in Internet Engineering Task Force<br>
(IETF) Request for Comment (RFC) 3261, which RFC is hereby incorporated herein in<br>
its entirety. Subscriber unit 102 conveys 502 reverse link frames comprising voice<br>
information to PDCS 118 via a reverse link traffic channel of air interface 112, AN 114,<br>
and PDSN 116, (referred to herein as a reverse link unicast) for routing to landline<br>
network 132 and distant party 134. Further, when PDCS 118 receives voice traffic from<br>
landline network 132, and more particularly from distant party 134, and intended for<br>
subscriber unit 102, the PDCS routes 504 the voice information to AN 114 via PDSN 116<br>
and the AN conveys forward link frames comprising the voice information to subscriber<br>
unit 102 via a forward link traffic channel of air interface 112 (referred to herein as a<br>
forward link unicast).<br>
	Prior to or during the course of the VoIP call, subscriber unit 102 further registers<br>
506 with circuit switched network 120, and more particularly with MSC 126 via BS 124.<br>
For example, subscriber unit 102 may roam from the coverage area serviced by AN 114<br>
to the coverage area serviced by BS 124, that is, by circuit switched network 120, and<br>
upon roaming into the coverage area of the circuit switched network registers with the<br>
circuit switched network. By way of another example, subscriber unit 102 may initially<br>
activate in an area of coverage of both AN 114 and BS 124. At activation, subscriber unit<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
15<br>
102 may register with both packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network<br>
120, and more particularly with PDCS 118 via AN 114 and PDSN 116 and with MSC<br>
126 via BS 124. Such registration procedures are well-known in the art and will not be<br>
described in detail herein except to note that when a subscriber unit registers with a<br>
network, the network stores in a respective HLR or VLR an identification of an AN or BS<br>
associated with the network and serving the subscriber unit. Registration of subscriber<br>
unit 102 with each of networks 110 and 120 facilitates the network's ability to locate the<br>
subscriber unit and to determine an AN or BS to use when paging the subscriber unit. In<br>
response to registering with each of networks 110 and 120, subscriber unit 102 tunes to<br>
the forward link paging channel or paging function of the network 120.<br>
	At some point in time during the course of the VoIP call, subscriber unit 102<br>
determines that the call should be handed off from AN 114 and packet switched network<br>
110 to BS 124 and circuit switched network 120. As noted above, this determination may<br>
be made based on, among other considerations, any one or more of signal strength<br>
measurements, network cost/load considerations, or a directive of a user of the subscriber<br>
unit. In response to determining that the call should be handed off, subscriber unit 102<br>
notifies 508 AN 114 of the subscriber unit's desire to initiate a handoff. AN 114<br>
forwards 510 the notification to PDSN 116 and, in turn, the PDSN forwards 512 the<br>
notification to PDCS 118. Typically, SIP messages are transparent to network elements<br>
such as AN 114 and PDSN 116. Preferably, the notification of PDCS 118 by subscriber<br>
unit 102 of the desire for a handoff is accomplished by use of SIP messaging, and more<br>
particularly by use of a modified version of a SIP REFER message (RFC 3515) that is<br>
transmitted by the subscriber unit and forwarded to the PDCS, which SIP REFER<br>
message is modified to identify a target network, that is, circuit switched network 120, for<br>
a handoff of the identified subscriber unit.<br>
	FIG. 6 is a diagram of an exemplary modified SIP REFER message 600 that may<br>
be transmitted by subscriber unit 102 in order to initiate a handoff in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As depicted by FIG. 6, SIP REFER message 600<br>
includes a first data field 602, that is, a message-type data field, that indicates that this is a<br>
SIP REFER message. SIP REFER message 600 further includes a second data field 604,<br>
that is, a destination data field, that identifies subscriber unit 102 as the destination of the<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
16<br>
message, and a third data field 606, an origination data field, that further identifies<br>
subscriber unit 102 as the originator of the message. By identifying the same subscriber<br>
unit, that is, subscriber unit 102, as the originator and target of the message, the SIP<br>
REFER message indicates that a handoff is being requested. In addition, unlike SIP<br>
REFER messages of the prior art, SIP REFER message 600 has been modified to further<br>
include a fourth data field 608, a target network indicator data field, that identifies a target<br>
network for a handoff of the identified subscriber unit. For example, as depicted in FIG.<br>
6, target network indicator data field is named "P-Access-Network-Info" and the target<br>
network for handoff is a 3GPP2 1XRTT network such as packet switched network 110.<br>
	In response to being notified by subscriber unit 102 of the desire for a handoff and<br>
based on the target network identified by the notification, that is, circuit switched network<br>
120, PDCS 118 determines the target MSC, that is, MSC 126, by reference to at least one<br>
of the HLR and VLR and a pre-provisioned database (not shown) included in or coupled<br>
to the PDCS 118. In response to determining the target MSC, that is, MSC 126, PDCS<br>
118 notifies 514 MSC 126 via intermediate network 130 of the need for a handoff and<br>
further identifies the subscriber unit, that is, subscriber unit 102, requesting the handoff.<br>
Preferably, PDCS 118 notifies MSC 126 of the need for a handoff and the requesting<br>
subscriber unit by conveying a TIA-41 FACDIR2 (Facilities Directive No. 2) INVOKE<br>
message to the MSC. In response to receiving the handoff notification from PDCS 118,<br>
MSC 126 determines the target BS, that is, BS 124, by reference to at least one of the<br>
HLR and VLR included in or coupled to the MSC. MSC 126 then notifies 516 target BS<br>
124 of the need for a handoff of subscriber unit 102, preferably by conveying a<br>
HANDOFF REQUEST message as described in detail in the IOS, to the BS.<br>
	In response to receiving the handoff notification from MSC 126, BS 124 pages<br>
518 subscriber unit 102. BS 124 may further convey 518a handoff request message to the<br>
subscriber unit via the at least one forward link control channel of the air interface and<br>
may negotiate a vocoder format with the subscriber unit. In addition, BS 124 preferably<br>
sets up a communication session with subscriber unit 102 by allocating a forward link<br>
traffic channel and a reverse link traffic channel to the subscriber unit and further<br>
establishes a bearer path between the subscriber unit and MSC 126 in accordance with<br>
well-known techniques. For example, BS 124 may direct subscriber unit 102 to a traffic<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
17<br>
channel immediately following the page by performing an early traffic channel<br>
assignment or the BS may convey a channel assignment message (CAM) to force the<br>
subscriber unit to a traffic channel. BS 124 then initiates the establishment of a bearer<br>
path with the subscriber unit by conveying 520 null frames to the subscriber unit via the<br>
allocated forward link traffic channel. BS 124 further informs subscriber unit 102 of the<br>
allocated reverse link traffic channel via one of the allocated forward link traffic channel<br>
and the at least one forward link signaling channel.<br>
	Further, in response to receiving the handoff notification from MSC 126, BS 124<br>
acknowledges 522 the notification received from MSC 126 of the need for a handoff by<br>
conveying an acknowledgement, preferably a HANDOFF REQUEST ACK as described<br>
in detail in the IOS, back to the MSC. In response to receiving the acknowledgement<br>
from BS 124, MSC 126 acknowledges 524 the handoff notification 514 received by the<br>
MSC from PDCS 118 by conveying a handoff notification acknowledgement to the<br>
PDCS. Preferably, the handoff notification acknowledgement comprises a TIA-41<br>
FACDIR2 RESPONSE message to PDCS 118.<br>
	At this point in signal flow diagram 500, forward link traffic channels are<br>
established with subscriber unit 102 in each of air interfaces 112 and 122. In response to<br>
receiving the handoff notification acknowledgement from MSC 126, PDCS 118 begins to<br>
multicast 526, 530 voice traffic to subscriber unit 102. That is, when PDCS 118 receives<br>
voice traffic from distant party 134, the PDCS conveys 526 the voice traffic to subscriber<br>
unit 102 via each of packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network 120.<br>
More particularly, when PDCS 118 receives voice traffic from distant party 134, the<br>
PDCS routes a first copy of the voice traffic to AN 114 via PDSN 116 and the AN<br>
transmits a first set of forward link frames comprising the voice traffic to subscriber unit<br>
102 via the forward link traffic channel established in air interface 112. In addition,<br>
PDCS 118 routes a second copy of the voice traffic to BS 124 via intermediate network<br>
130 and MSC 126 and the BS transmits a second set of forward link frames comprising<br>
the voice traffic to subscriber unit 102 via the .forward link traffic channel established in<br>
air interface 122. As noted above, reception of frames by subscriber unit 102 from both<br>
of networks 110 and 120 may be implemented by dual receivers, such as receivers<br>
associated with each of transceivers 302 and 304 of a subscriber unit, or may be<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
18<br>
implemented by a single receiver, such as a receiver associated with transceiver 402 of a<br>
subscriber unit, that is directed by a processor, such as processor 404 of the subscriber<br>
unit, to rapidly alternate between the networks. To facilitate the latter, PDCS 118 may<br>
force a vocoder in, or associated with, distant party 134 to a lower frame rate, such as 1/8<br>
rate vocoder frames instead of full-rate vocoder frames. By receiving reduced rate<br>
frames, subscriber unit 102 has more time to alternate between networks 110 and 102<br>
without complete loss of vocoder frames or the need for dual receivers. Subscriber unit<br>
102 may implement methods well known in the art to eliminate duplicate processing of<br>
voice frames.<br>
	PDCS 118 acts as the anchor for the call, that is, as the gateway for landline<br>
network 132 into each of networks 110 and 120, and remains in the path of the call for<br>
the duration of the call, even after the call is handed off from packet switched network<br>
110 to circuit switched network 120. By providing for multicasting before the forward<br>
link is switched from packet switched network 110 to circuit switched network 120, any<br>
potential gap in the voice traffic received by subscriber unit 102 that may result from a<br>
"break and make" hard handoff is minimized. However, in order to assure proper<br>
synchronization of the forward link frames, subscriber unit 102 may add a delay to the<br>
frames received from one of packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network<br>
120.<br>
	At this point in signal flow diagram 500, subscriber unit 102 continues to unicast<br>
528 reverse link frames comprising voice traffic to landline network 132, and more<br>
particularly to PDCS 118, via packet switched network 110. That is, subscriber unit 102<br>
conveys reverse link frames comprising voice traffic only to AN 114 via the reverse link<br>
traffic channel of air interface 112, and via the AN to PDCS 118.<br>
	In addition, in response to receiving the handoff notification acknowledgement<br>
from MSC 126, PDCS 118 informs 532 subscriber unit 102 that the handoff is proceeding<br>
via the at least one forward link channel of air interface 112. In packet switched network<br>
110, this messaging may be handled via SIP messages. Preferably, the handoff<br>
notification acknowledgement from PDCS 118 comprises a SIP REFER "202 Accepted"<br>
message to subscriber unit 102 as described in IETF RFC 3515, Section 4.1, which RFC<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
19<br>
is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety. Again, AN 114 and PDSN 116 typically are<br>
transparent to SIP messages and there are no PDCS-to-PDSN or PDSN-to-AN messages<br>
as one would find in circuit switched network 120.<br>
	In response to being informed that the handoff is proceeding, subscriber unit 102<br>
switches from unicasting 528 reverse link frames of voice information to PDCS 118 via<br>
packet switched network 110 to unicasting 542 reverse link frames of voice information<br>
to PDCS 118 via circuit switched network 120. That is, while continuing to receive 538,<br>
540 forward link frames comprising voice information via each of AN 114 and BS 124<br>
and the respective forward link traffic channels of air interfaces 112 and 122, subscriber<br>
unit 102 switches from transmitting reverse link frames of voice information via packet<br>
switched network 110 and the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 112 to<br>
transmitting reverse link frames of voice information to circuit switched network 120 via<br>
the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 122. The switch of reverse link paths<br>
preferably occurs at a frame boundary, thereby providing for switching without any loss<br>
of a voice frame.<br>
	In response to switching from the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 112<br>
to the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 122, subscriber unit 102 notifies 544 BS<br>
124 that the subscriber unit has completed the handoff. Preferably, subscriber unit 102<br>
notifies BS 124 that the handoff is complete by conveying a first HANDOFF<br>
COMPLETE message as described in the IOS. In response to being informed that<br>
subscriber unit 102 has completed the handoff, BS 124 informs 546 MSC 126 that the<br>
subscriber unit has completed the handoff, preferably by conveying a second HANDOFF<br>
COMPLETE message as described in the IOS, to the MSC. In turn, MSC 126 conveys<br>
548 a message to PDCS 118 informing that subscriber unit 102 has switched to the<br>
reverse link of air interface 122, preferably by conveying a TIA-41 MSONCH message to<br>
the PDCS via intermediate network 130. Based on the message received from MSC 126,<br>
PDCS 118 determines that the subscriber unit has completed the handoff.<br>
	In addition, in response to switching from the reverse link traffic channel of air<br>
interface 112 to the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 122, subscriber unit 102<br>
notifies 550 PDCS 118 that the handoff is complete. Preferably, the handoff complete<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
20<br>
message from subscriber unit 102 to PDCS 118 comprises a SIP REFER "200 OK"<br>
message as described in IETF RFC 3515, Section 4.1. Subscriber unit 102 may then go<br>
dormant or disconnect altogether with respect to packet switched network 110. PDCS<br>
118 then terminates the RTP session between subscriber unit 102 and packet switched<br>
network 110 and ceases conveying forward link frames to the subscriber unit via the<br>
packet switched network, thereby converting 556 the call to a unicast forward link call via<br>
PDCS 118, circuit switched network 120, and the allocated forward link traffic channel of<br>
air interface 122. As noted above, the call has already been converted to a unicast reverse<br>
link call via circuit switched network 120 and the allocated reverse link traffic channel of<br>
air interface 122. However, the call continues as a circuit switched call via air interface<br>
122, circuit switched network 120, intermediate network 130, and PDCS 118. Signal<br>
flow diagram 500 then ends.<br>
	FIG. 7 is a signal flow diagram 700 of a handoff executed by communication<br>
system 100 in handing off a legacy voice call communicated via circuit switched network<br>
120 to a VoIP voice call communicated via packet switched network 110 in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. Signal flow diagram 700 begins when<br>
subscriber unit 102 is actively engaged in a legacy, or conventional, cellular call with<br>
distant party 134 via circuit switched network 120 and landline network 132. In order to<br>
participate in the call, subscriber unit 102 must already be registered with the circuit<br>
switched network. As part of the call, distant party 134 communicates 702 with BS 124<br>
via landline network 132 and MSC 126 using a G.711 protocol (64 kbps Pulse Code<br>
Modulation (PCM)). BS 124 transcodes the received communications to a vocoder<br>
format compatible with subscriber unit 102 and transmits 702 the transcoded information<br>
to subscriber unit 102 via a forward link traffic channel of air interface 122. Further, BS<br>
124 receives 704 vocoded information from subscriber unit 102 via a reverse link traffic<br>
channel of air interface 122, transcodes the vocoded information to 64 kbps PCM<br>
(G.711), and conveys 704 the transcoded information to distant party 134 via MSC 126<br>
and landline network 132.<br>
	Prior to or during the course of the call, subscriber unit 102 further registers 706<br>
with packet switched network 110, and more particularly with AN 114 and PDCS 118,<br>
and establishes a PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) communication session with PDSN 116<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
21<br>
in accordance with well known techniques. A connection between the AN 114, PDSN<br>
116, and PDCS 118 is established on packet switched network 110 such that subscriber<br>
unit 102 and PDCS 118 are able to communicate with each other. For example,<br>
subscriber unit 102 may roam from the coverage area serviced by BS 124 to the coverage<br>
area serviced by AN 114, that is, by packet switched network 110 and register with the<br>
packet switched network. By way of another example, subscriber unit 102 may initially<br>
activate in an area of coverage of both AN 114 and BS 124 and upon activation register<br>
with both packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network 120, and more<br>
particularly with PDCS 118 and MSC 126.<br>
	At some point in time during the course of the call, BS 124 determines that a<br>
handoff is required. As noted above, this determination may be made based on, among<br>
other considerations, any one or more of signal strength measurements, network cost<br>
considerations, or a network operator directive. In another embodiment of the invention, ..<br>
subscriber unit 102 may notify BS 124 that subscriber unit 102 needs to handoff to packet<br>
switched network 110, for example, via a modified IS-2000 signaling message. This may<br>
be initiated via user action or subscriber unit 102 may determine the need to handoff, for<br>
example, when the user initiates an email downloading session via the subscriber unit. In<br>
response to determining that the call should be handed off, BS 124 notifies 708 MSC 126<br>
of the need to initiate a handoff. Preferably, this notification includes an indication of the<br>
target network, such as a WLAN network or a CDMA 2000 1XEV-DO network. In<br>
response to being notified by BS 124 of the need for a handoff, MSC 126 determines a<br>
target switching center, that is, target PDCS 118, by reference to at least one of the HLR<br>
and VLR and the pre-provisioned database included in or coupled to MSC 126.<br>
	In response to determining target a target switching center, MSC 126 notifies 710<br>
the target switching center, that is, PDCS 118, via intermediate network 130 of the need<br>
for a handoff and further identifies the subscriber unit, that is, subscriber unit 102, to be<br>
handed off. Preferably, MSC 126 notifies PDCS 118 of the need to handoff the<br>
associated subscriber unit by conveying a TIA-41 FACDIR2 INVOKE message to the<br>
PDCS. In response to receiving the handoff notification from MSC 126, PDCS 118<br>
requests subscriber unit 102 to perform a handoff of the call from the conventional<br>
cellular communication system to a VoIP communication session with the PDCS. As<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
22<br>
subscriber unit 102 is already registered on packet switched network 110, the packet<br>
switched network can determine the appropriate routing and there is no need at this time<br>
to determine a target AN.<br>
	PDCS 118 then requests 714 that subscriber unit 102 perform a handoff,<br>
preferably by conveying a SIP INVITE request or a SIP REFER message to the subscriber<br>
unit. In response to receiving the SIP INVITE request, subscriber unit 102 negotiates<br>
forward link and reverse link traffic channels with AN 114 in air interface 112 and AN<br>
114 establishes a corresponding bearer path between the subscriber unit and PDSN 116 in<br>
accordance with well-known techniques. Subscriber unit 102 further conveys 716 a<br>
message, preferably a SIP 180 RINGING message, to PDCS 118 indicating that the<br>
subscriber unit is proceeding to activate the connection with PDCS 118.<br>
	When subscriber unit 102 has negotiated a traffic channel with AN 114 and a<br>
bearer path has been established with PDSN 116, subscriber unit 102 begins multicasting;<br>
718, 722 reverse link voice information to MSC 126 via each of the packet switched<br>
network 110 and circuit switched network 120. That is, subscriber unit 102 continues to,<br>
convey 722 a first set of reverse link frames comprising vocoded information to BS 124<br>
via the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 122, which voice information is then<br>
routed to MSC 126, and further conveys a second set of reverse link frames comprising<br>
the vocoded information to AN 114 via the reverse link traffic channel established in air<br>
interface 112, which voice information is also routed to MSC 126. In one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, in order to assure synchronization of the multicast reverse link<br>
frames, subscriber unit 102 may add delay to frames transmitted to one of packet<br>
switched network 110 and circuit switched network 120. For example, a delay may be<br>
determined based on prior handoffs of the subscriber unit between the networks, wherein<br>
PDCS 118 may calculate a delay value and convey the delay value to the subscriber unit.<br>
However, in another embodiment of the present invention, the delay may be added in the<br>
networks, for example, by MSC 126. In various embodiments of the present invention,<br>
subscriber unit 102 may concurrently transmit (718, 722) via the reverse links of air<br>
interfaces 122 and 112 by using a transmitter associated with each link, such as<br>
transmitters associated with each of transceivers 302 and 304 of a subscriber unit, or may<br>
emulate concurrent transmission (718, 722) via the reverse links of air interfaces 122 and<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
23<br>
112 by rapidly alternating transmission via a single transmitter, such as a transmitter<br>
associated with transceiver 402 of a subscriber unit, over a reverse link of a first air<br>
interface, that is, the reverse link of air interface 122, and over a reverse link of a second<br>
air interface that is, the reverse link of air interface 112. The process of alternating<br>
transmission paths may be further enhanced by a processor of the subscriber unit, such as<br>
processor 404, forcing a vocoder of the subscriber unit, such as vocoder 408, to vocode<br>
speech at a reduced rate when transmitting over the two air interfaces. For example, by<br>
using only 1/8 rate vocoder frames instead of full-rate vocoder frames, time becomes<br>
available to rapidly switch between paths without needing to use multiple transmitters.<br>
	MSC 126 acts as the anchor for the call, that is, as the gateway for landline<br>
network 132 into each of networks 110 and 120, and remains in the path of the call for<br>
the duration of the call, even after the call is handed off from circuit switched network<br>
120 to packet switched network 110. By providing for multicasting before the reverse<br>
link is switched from circuit switched network 120 to packet switched network 110, any<br>
potential gap in the voice traffic received by networks 110 and 120 that may result from a<br>
"break and make" hard handoff is minimized. When MSC 126 receives voice frames via<br>
each of packet switched network 110 and circuit switched network 120, MSC 126 may<br>
perform buffering and may eliminate duplicate voice frames by selecting one voice frame<br>
from each of the packet switched network and the circuit switched network.<br>
	At this point in signal flow diagram 700, forward link frames of vocoded<br>
information continue to be unicast to subscriber unit 102, that is, MSC 126 conveys 724<br>
forward link frames comprising vocoded information to the subscriber unit only via BS<br>
124 and the forward link traffic channel of air interface 122. However, PDCS 118 may<br>
begin conveying 720 null frames to subscriber unit 102 via the established forward link<br>
traffic channel in air interface 112.<br>
	Further, in response to establishing a communication path with subscriber unit<br>
102 via AN 114 and air interface 112, PDCS 118 informs 726 MSC 126 that a handoff of<br>
subscriber unit 102 is progressing by conveying a handoff notification to the MSC.<br>
Preferably, the handoff notification comprises a TIA-41 FACDIR2 RESPONSE message.<br>
PDCS 118 further acknowledges 728 the message received from subscriber unit 102<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
24<br>
indicating that the subscriber unit is proceeding to activate the connection with PDCS<br>
118, that is, the SIP 180 RINGING message. Preferably, PDCS 118 acknowledges the<br>
message by conveying a SIP PRACK (Provisional Acknowledgement) message to the<br>
subscriber unit. In response to receiving the acknowledgement from PDCS 118,<br>
subscriber unit 102 acknowledges 730 the acknowledgement, preferably by conveying a<br>
SIP OK (RINGING) message to the PDCS.<br>
	In response to receiving the handoff notification from PDCS 118, MSC 126<br>
switches the forward link unicast of voice information to subscriber unit 102 from circuit<br>
switched network 120 to packet switched network 110. That is, MSC 126 begins<br>
conveying 732 voice information received from distant party 134 and intended for<br>
subscriber unit 102 to AN 114 via intermediate network 130, PDCS 118, and PDSN 116,<br>
and the AN transmits forward link frames comprising vocoded information to the<br>
subscriber unit via the forward link traffic channel established in air interface 112.<br>
Meanwhile, MSC 126 ceases conveying 736 the voice information to the subscriber unit<br>
via BS 124 and the forward link traffic channel of air interface 122. However, subscriber<br>
unit 102 continues to multicast 734, 738 reverse link frames of vocoded information via<br>
each of circuit switched network 120 and packet switched network 110. That is,<br>
subscriber unit 102 continues to convey a first set of frames comprising the vocoded<br>
information to MSC 126 via BS 124 and the reverse link traffic channel of air interface<br>
122 and a second set of frames comprising the vocoded information to MSC 126 via<br>
PDCS 118, PDSN 116, AN 114 and the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 112.<br>
As noted above, subscriber unit 102 may concurrently transmit via the reverse links of air<br>
interfaces 112 and 122 by using a transmitter associated with each link, such as a<br>
transmitter associated with each of transceivers 302 and 304, or may emulate concurrent<br>
transmission via the reverse links of air interfaces 112 and 122 by rapidly alternating<br>
between transmission via a single transceiver, such as transceiver 402, over the reverse<br>
link of air interface 112 and over the reverse link of air interface 122, which process of<br>
alternating transmission paths may be further enhanced by forcing a vocoder, such as<br>
vocoder 408, of the subscriber unit to vocode speech to a reduced rate.<br>
	MSC 126 further instructs 740 BS 124 to complete the handoff, that is, to instruct<br>
subscriber unit 102 to cease sending reverse link frames to BS 124. In response to<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
25<br>
receiving the instruction, BS 124 then instructs 742 subscriber unit 102 to cease sending<br>
reverse link frames to the BS. In response to receiving the instruction from BS 124,<br>
subscriber unit ceases sending reverse link frames to the BS, leaving the subscriber unit in<br>
a bi-directional unicast mode with MSC 126 and packet switched network 110. In other<br>
words, voice information is conveyed 744 to subscriber unit 102 only via MSC 126,<br>
PDCS 118, PDSN 116, AN 114 and the forward link traffic channel of air interface 112,<br>
and subscriber unit 102 conveys 746 voice information to MSC 126 only via PDCS 118,<br>
PDSN 116, AN 114, and the reverse link traffic channel of air interface 112.<br>
	Further, in response to switching from the reverse link of air interface 122 to the<br>
reverse link of air interface 112, subscriber unit 102 notifies 748 BS 124 that the handoff<br>
is completed, that is, that the subscriber unit is now engaged in a bi-directional unicast<br>
with packet switched network 110, that is, AN 114 and PDCS 118. Preferably, subscriber<br>
unit 102 notifies BS 124 that the handoff is completed by conveying a MS ACK ORDER1<br>
message to the BS.<br>
	In response to being informed that the handoff is completed, BS 124 informs 750<br>
MSC 126 that the handoff has commenced. In addition, in response to receiving the<br>
instruction to cease sending reverse link frames to BS 124, subscriber unit 102 informs<br>
752 PDCS 118 that the request to perform a handoff received by the subscriber unit from<br>
the PDCS, that is, the SIP INVITE request, has been successfully executed, preferably by<br>
conveying a SIP 200 OK message to the PDCS.<br>
	In response to being informed that the request to perform a handoff has been<br>
successfully executed, PDCS 118 acknowledges 754 the successful execution message,<br>
preferably by conveying a SIP ACK to subscriber unit 102. PDCS 118 further informs<br>
756 MSC 126 that the subscriber unit is successfully exchanging voice frames on a bi-<br>
directional basis with packet switched network 110, that is, with AN 114 and PDCS 118,<br>
preferably by conveying a TIA-41 MSONCH message to the MSC via intermediate<br>
network 130. Based on the message received from PDCS 118, MSC 126 determines that<br>
subscriber unit 102 has completed the handoff and so informs 758 BS 124, preferably by<br>
conveying a CLEAR COMMAND message to the BS. In response to being informed that<br>
subscriber unit 102 has completed the handoff, BS 124 terminates the legacy call, that is,<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
26<br>
the circuit switched network call, with the subscriber unit. Upon terminating the legacy<br>
call, BS 124 informs 760 MSC 126 that the legacy call has been terminated, preferably by<br>
conveying a CLEAR COMPLETE message to the MSC. Signal flow diagram 700 then<br>
ends.<br>
	In summarization, communication system 100 provides for an active handoff of a<br>
voice call between packet switched network 110, preferably a CDMA 2000 1XRTT<br>
network, a CDMA 2000 1XEV-DO network, or a WLAN network, and circuit switched<br>
network 120, preferably a CDMA IX network, by multicasting the call over both<br>
networks during the course of the handoffs. An active handoff from packet switched<br>
network 110 to circuit switched network is accomplished by multicasting the call over<br>
forward links of both networks during the handoff. An active handoff from the circuit<br>
switched network to the packet switched network is accomplished by multicasting the call<br>
over reverse links of both networks during the handoff. The former handoff further may<br>
be facilitated by maintaining PDCS 118 in the call even when the call is routed through<br>
circuit switched network 120, and the latter handoff further may be facilitated by<br>
maintaining MSC 126 in the call even when the call is routed through packet switched<br>
network 110. In order for hybrid subscriber unit 102 to operate concurrently in both<br>
network 110 and network 120, the subscriber unit may comprise multiple transceivers.<br>
However, in another embodiment of the present invention, subscriber unit 102 may<br>
comprise a single transceiver that is rapidly switched between networks 110 and 120 to<br>
give the appearance of concurrent operation. In addition, when switching between<br>
networks, a vocoder 408 in the single transceiver subscriber unit 102 may be instructed<br>
by the processor to use a reduced rate that allows for the time for the rapid switching<br>
without severely degrading voice quality.<br>

second forward link, the base station ceases receiving reverse link voice traffic while the<br>
access network continues to receive reverse link voice traffic.<br>
16	The system of claim 15, wherein the packet data control switch, in response to the<br>
establishment of the second forward link and the second reverse link with the subscriber<br>
unit, conveys a handoff notification to the mobile switching center and wherein the<br>
mobile switching center, in response to receiving the handoff notification from the packet<br>
data control switch, switches the forward link voice traffic from the base station and the<br>
first forward link to the access network and the second forward link.<br>
17	A method for handoff of a voice call from a packet switched network having a<br>
packet data control switch to a circuit switched network, the method comprising:<br>
	communicating voice traffic via the packet switched network;<br>
	receiving, by the packet switched network, a notification to hand off the call,<br>
wherein the notification to hand off identifies the circuit switched network as the network<br>
to hand off the call to; and<br>
	in response to receiving the handoff notification, establishing communication via<br>
the circuit switched network and terminating communication via the packet switched<br>
network.<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
34<br>
18	A method for handoff of a voice call from a packet switched network having a<br>
packet data control switch to a circuit switched network, the method comprising:<br>
	communicating voice traffic via the packet switched network;<br>
	determining, by a subscriber unit, to hand off the call;<br>
	transmitting a notification to hand off the call, wherein the notification to hand off<br>
identifies the circuit switched network as the network to hand off the call to; and<br>
	in response to transmitting the handoff notification, establishing communication<br>
via the circuit switched network and terminating communication via the packet switched<br>
network.<br>
19	A method for emulating concurrent operation by a hybrid subscriber unit in each<br>
of a network associated with a first radio frequency (RF) technology and a network<br>
associated with a second RF technology, the method comprising:<br>
	when transmitting, alternating between transmission via a first air interface<br>
associated with the first RF technology and transmission via a second air interface<br>
associated with the second RF technology; and<br>
	when receiving, alternating between reception via an air interface associated with<br>
the first RF technology and reception via an air interface associated with the second RF<br>
technology.<br>
20	The method of claim 19, wherein operation comprises engaging in a voice call<br>
and wherein the method further comprises, when switching from transmitting via only<br>
one of the first air interface and the second air interface to transmitting via both the first<br>
air interface and the second air interface, forcing vocoded speech transmitted via the one<br>
of the first air interface and the second air interface to a reduced rate.<br>
21	A hybrid subscriber unit capable of operating in each of a network associated with<br>
a first radio frequency (RF) technology and a network associated with a second RF<br>
technology, the subscriber unit comprising:<br>
	a transceiver for transmitting and receiving RF communications; and<br>
	a processor in communication with to the transceiver that, when transmitting,<br>
alternates between transmission via an air interface associated with the first RF<br><br>
WO 2006/057924 	PCT/US2005/041973<br>
35<br>
technology and transmission via an air interface associated with the second RF<br>
technology and, when receiving, alternates between reception via a first air interface<br>
associated with the first RF technology and reception via a second air interface associated<br>
with the second RF technology.<br>
22	The hybrid subscriber unit of claim 21, wherein operation comprises engaging in a<br>
voice call, wherein the subscriber unit further comprises a vocoder in communication<br>
with the processor, and wherein the processor, when the subscriber unit switches from<br>
transmitting via only one of the first air interface and the second air interface to<br>
transmitting via both the first air interface and the second air interface, forces the vocoder<br>
to vocode speech transmitted via the one of the first air interface and the second air<br>
interface at a reduced rate.<br><br>
A communication system (100) provides for an active handoff of a voice call between a packet switched network<br>
(110) and a circuit switched network (120). An active handoff from the packet switched network to the circuit switched network is<br>
accomplished by multicasting the call over forward links of both networks during the handoff. An active handoff from the circuit<br>
switched network to the packet switched network is accomplished by multicasting the call over reverse links of both networks during<br>
the handoff. The former handoff further may be facilitated by routing the call for each network through a same packet data control<br>
switch (118), and the latter handoff further may be facilitated by routing the call for each network through a same mobile switching<br>
center (126). Further, a subscriber unit (102) operating concurrently in both networks may comprise multiple transceivers or a<br>
transceiver that is rapidly switched between the networks.</td>
