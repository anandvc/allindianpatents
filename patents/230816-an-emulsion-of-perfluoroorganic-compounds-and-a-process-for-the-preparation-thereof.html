				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an emulsion of perfluoroorganic compounds for intravascular administration and is concerned with a composition of and a process for the preparation of a medicinal form of emulsions of perfluoroorganic compounds (PFOC) with gas-transporting properties, intended, in particular, for intravenous administration when compensating for blood losses and for treating various diseases accompanied by hypoxic or ischemic lesions, and also as contrast and perfusion media.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Though the range of possible applications of gas-trans¬porting PFOC emulsions keeps on extending, on the whole the ap¬plication of these preparations is still limited in view of the following factors.<br>
• The delivery of oxygen is not sufficiently effective/ par¬ticularly because of insufficient oxygen capacity of PFOC emul¬sions compared with whole blood, which makes those engaged in developing PFOC emulsions increase the concentration of gas-transporting components, for example, up to 65 vol.% [European Patent No. 0307087B1, publication dated 08.06.1994]. However, an increase of the PFOC concentration in the emulsion is inevitably accompanied by a sharp increase in the viscosity of the prepara¬tions. As a result, emulsions with a high PFOC concentration, in spite of a high absolute oxygen capacity, do not provide suffi¬ciently effective oxygen delivery to the tissues due to the small dynamic oxygen capacity determined by the absolute oxygen capacity/viscosity ratio. When the viscosity of the preparation is high, the compensatory reactions of the cardiovascular sys¬tem, directed to increasing the minute volume and raising the<br><br>
rheological properties of blood, can provide neither sufficient perfusion of large vessels nor effective circulation, and, con¬sequently, the delivery of oxygen to the tissues is disturbed.<br>
	The reactogenicity of PFOC emulsions is relatively high.<br>
The reactogenicity is associated, in the first place, with the<br>
formation  of  peroxide  radicals  in  the  stabilizing  agent<br>
[L.E.McCoy, C.A.Berker, T.H.Goodin, M.J.Barnhart,//Scann. Elec¬<br>
tron. Microscopy, 1984, v. 1, p. 311] which forms an adsorption<br>
layer of the PFOC particles, and, in the second place, with the<br>
presence of large particles in the emulsion, which are recog¬<br>
nized by the immune system of the organism as foreign agents<br>
[S.I.Vorob'ev et al., "Comparative study of some perfluorocarbon<br>
emulsions",  in:  Physiological Activity of Fluorine-containing<br>
Compounds  (Experiment and Clinic),  Pushchino,  1995, pp.  33—41<br>
(in Russian)].<br>
*	The possibility of manifestation of toxicity of the emul¬<br>
sions, caused by the effect of lipophilic perfluorocarbons rap¬<br>
idly eliminable from the organism, traditionally used for pro¬<br>
ducing gas-transporting blood substitutes, on biological struc¬<br>
tures, and by possible aggregation and coarsening of emulsion,<br>
grains in the blood flow. Rapidly eliminable perfluorocarbons<br>
easily interact with enzymatic systems and biological membranes,<br>
formed elements and proteins of blood, and, as is shown by a<br>
number of investigations,  induce an anaphilactogenic reaction,<br>
and delayed death (in 50—80 days) of large laboratory animals<br>
having a low blood flow rate, comparable with that in humans<br>
(A.N.Sklifas,    V.V.Obraztsov,    K.N.Makarov,    D.G.Shekhtman,<br>
N.I.Kukushkin, "Investigation of the Toxicity Mechanism of Per-<br>
fluorodecalin  Emulsion  for  Rabbits",  in  collected articles:<br>
"Perfluorocarbon Active Media for Medicine and Biology. New As¬<br>
pects of Research". Pushchino, 1993, pp. 129—135 (in Russian)].<br>
*	High cost of PFOC emulsion preparations, associated with<br>
the necessity of preparing individual PFOCs and high require-<br><br>
ments to their purification from admixtures, which makes them difficult of access for users.<br>
Binary PFOC emulsions are known (see, e.g., USSR Patent No. 797546, publ. in Bull. "Otkrytiya, Izobreteniya, .. . ", No. 2, 15.01.1981, or RF Patent No. 2088217, publ. in Bull. "Izo¬breteniya ... (Zayavki...,)", No. 24, 27.08.1997), in which, for lowering the toxicity, in addition to rapidly eliminable per-fluorocarbons, slowly eliminable substances are contained, for instance, perfluorinated tertiary amines, which possess ex¬pressed lipophobic properties and do not interact in any manner with biological objects. For example, it has been shown that the presence in the composition of the emulsions and even long-term accumulation in organs of slowly eliminable perfluorotributyla-mine, which is retained in macrophages of different organs for a period commensurable with the life time of animals (and which is therefore not used for medical purposes) does not bring about any pathological changes. This is confirmed by more than 30 years of investigations aimed at finding toxicity and probable cancerogenicity and by 16 years of experience in medical uses of emulsions of perfluoroorganic compounds, containing other rela¬tively slowly eliminable perf luorinated tertiary amines [Biorna-terials, artificial cells, and artificial organs. 1988, vol. 16, No. 1—3, Special Issue from III International Symposium on "Blood Substitutes"; A.M.Golubev, Advances in and Prospects of Studying the Influence of Fluorocarbon Blood Substitutes on Bio¬logical Systems./ Perfluorocarbon Active Media for Medicine and Biology (New Aspects of Research). Pushchino: ONTI of Pushchino Research Center, Russian Academy of Sciences, 1993, pp. 88—93 (in Russian)].<br>
The binary PFOC emulsion according to RF Patent No. 2088217 is the closest to the claimed emulsion with regard to the formu¬lation of its components. It comprises a mixture of a rapidly eliminable lipophilic perfluorocarbon perfluorodecalin (PFD) or perfluorooctylbromide and a slowly eliminable lipophobic per-fluorinated tertiary amine perfluoro-N-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-<br><br>
piperidine (PFMCP) in a ratio of 40-50 vol.% to 1-10 vol.%, and is stabilized by phospholipids the amount of which is from 2 to 6%. Upon intravenous administration of such emulsion, 100% of rabbits survive during 60 days of observations. However, this emulsion has a high viscosity (14—16 cP) , which, as indicated above, in spite of the high absolute oxygen capacity of the preparation, leads to a sharp drop of the dynamic oxygen capac¬ity and does not provide efficient delivery of oxygen.<br>
Furthermore, the use of such sharply differing in their physical properties PFOC as the lipophilic PFD and lipophobic PFMCP leads to clustering of the fluorocarbon phase inside the emulsion particles, which complicates the choice of the stabi¬lizing agent and impairs the emulsion stability. As a result, the emulsion dispersity changes both during storage and when the emulsion enters the blood flow.<br>
Finally, in this invention individual highly purified per-fluorodecalin and perfluoro-N-(4-methycyclohexyl)-piperidine are used for preparing the emulsion, which, as already indicated, makes the PFOC emulsion appreciably more expensive.<br>
A PFOC emulsion is known, which is closest to the claimed one in the composition and in the ratio of the components [see RF Patent No. 2070033, publ. in Bull. "Izbrete-niya...(Zayavki,...)", No. 34, 27.08.97]. This emulsion contains perfluorocarbon in the form of cis- and trans-isomers of per-fluorodecalin and perfluorinated tertiary amine perfluoro-N-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-piperidine in lower concentrations of both components: 7 vol.% and 3.5 vol.%, respectively, and it is sta¬bilized by a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer with a molecular mass of 6—8 thousand Dalton (Da) with a mean size of emulsion particles of 0.08—0.1 fim. This composition, with a com¬paratively small value of the absolute oxygen capacity (7 vol.% of oxygen at p02 of 760 mm Kg) , ensures owing to its small vis¬cosity (3.5 cP) a higher dynamic oxygen capacity than other known PFOC emulsions (see Table 1 in the specification to said RF Patent), i.e., it ensures better oxygen delivery to the tis-<br><br>
sues. Owing to the high proportion of the slowly eliminable PFMCP (the PFMCP/PFD ratio = 1:2) in the PFOC formulation and the high degree of monodispersity of the particles along with their size, this emulsion is not toxic for large animals. How¬ever, the emulsion according to RF Patent No. 2070033 is not: free from a number of disadvantages: a relatively high reacto-genicity because of formation of peroxide compounds in the sta¬bilizing agent in the process of manufacture and during storage of the emulsion; insufficient stability upon repeated freezing-defrosting the emulsion, when the emulsion enters the blood flow, and when it gets in contact with high-molecular dextrans, since two PFOC sharply differing in their physicochemical prop¬erties are used in the composition of the emulsion; and a high cost of the preparation due to the use of highly purified PFD and PFMCP.<br>
Known in the art is a process for the preparation of PFOC emulsions for medical purposes, in which process for reacto-genicity it is proposed to decrease the mean size and to in¬crease the monodispersity of the emulsion particles (see the specification to RF Patent No. 2070033). These properties are secured by adding dropwise a mixture of two forms of liquid PFOC to an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent, thereby preclud¬ing the origination of a macroscopic interface, increasing the contact time and area of the PFOC with the stabilizing agent in the step of preparing the pro-emulsion. A submicron emulsion is prepared in a two-circuit homogenization system in the process of 12-fold recirculation in the homogenizer circuits. According to the specification of the cited invention, the first and sec¬ond circuits of the homogenizer are used alternately, the homog¬enization process being thus slowed down, because returning from the second circuit to the first circuit leads to coarse pro-emulsion particles and even drops of PFOC, which are inevitably formed and retained on the walls of the chamber and pipes in the first circuit, getting into the already finely divided fine-dispersed emulsion. Furthermore, as it was already mentioned<br><br>
when criticizing the formulation of the emulsion, this process does not prevent formation of peroxide compounds.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an emulsion of perfluoroorganic compounds (PFOC) for intravascular administration comprising a main rapidly eliminable perfluorocarbon (PFC) in the form of a mixture of cis- and trans isomers such as herein described and a main slowly perfluorinated cyclic tertiary amine (PFCTA) such as herein described, a stabilizing agent such as herein described, a physiologically acceptable aqueous-saline solution such as herein described with a substrate of energy metabolism, characterized in that it comprises at least three admixtures of rapidly eliminable perfluorocarbons (PFC) C7-C10 with the critical temperature of dissolution in hexane (CTDH) higher than the CTDH of the main PFC by not more than 8°C. in any ratio, and at least three slowly eliminable perfluorinated cyclic tertiary amines (PFCTA) Cn-Ci3 with the CTDH lower than the CTDH of the main PFCTA by not more than 10°C. in any ratio, and minor admixtures of H-perfluoroalkanes such as herein described, wherein the content of admixtures of the rapidly eliminable perfluorocarbons (PFC) is less than or equal to 15% of the content of the main perfluorocarbon (PFC), the content of admixtures of the slowly eliminable perfluorinated cyclic tertiary amines (PFCTA) is less than or equal to 50% of the content of the main perfluorinated cyclic tertiary amine (PFCTA), the content of admixutres of H-perfluoroalkanes is less than or equal to 0.1 vol. %, the content of the stabilizing agent is 2-4%, and the balance being aqueous-saline solution; the ratio of rapidly eliminable and slowly eliminable PFOC is between 2:1 to 3:1.<br><br>
Disclosure  of the  Invention<br>
It is an object of the proposed invention to provide such a composition of a PFOC emulsion, which ensures a reduction of the reactogenicity of the preparation and of the toxicity thereof for large animals and humans, a high dynamic oxygen capacity, a high stability on repeated freezing-defrosting and on contact with high-molecular dextrans used as blood substitutes.<br>
Another object of the proposed invention is to develop such a process for the preparation of a pro-emulsion and a submicron emulsion proper, which, while preserving a high monodispersity of the system and with a prescribed small size of particles, in¬hibits the formation of peroxide compounds in the course of pre¬paring the emulsion and during storage thereof.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to reduce the capital inputs, to simplify and speed-up the process of prepar¬ing the PFOC emulsion, this -being necessary for the industrial-scale manufacture of the drug.<br>
The first object of the present invention is accomplished by that the known PFOC emulsion for medical purposes, which comprises a rapidly eliminable perfluorocarbon and a slowly eliminable perfluorinated tertiary arnine, a stabilizing agent and a physiologically acceptable aqueous-saline solution with an energy-metabolism substrate, according to the invention, further comprises admixtures of at least three rapidly eliminable cis- and trans-isomers of perfluorocarbons C7-do in any ratio and of at least three slowly eliminable perfluorinated tertiary amines C1-C13 in any ratio, close in physiochemical properties to the main perfluoroorganic compounds, for instance, in the critical temperature of dissolution in hexane, and minor admixtures of H-perfluoroalkanes. The content of the admixtures of rapidly eliminable perfluorocarbons does not exceed 15% of the content of the main perfluorocarbon; the content of the admixtures of slowly eliminable perfluori-<br><br>
nated  tertiary   amines   does   not   exceed   50%   of   the   content   of   the main   perfluorinated   tertiary   amine;    and   the   content   of   admix¬tures    of   H-perfluoroalkanes    does    not    exceed    0.1    vol. %.    A   the rapidly   eliminable   perfluorocarbon   a   mixture   of   cis-   and   trans-isomers   of   perfluorodecalin   or   perfluorooctyl   bromide   is   used, and        as        the        slowly        eliminable         PFOC        perflluoro-N-4-(methylcyclohexyl)-piperidine   is   used.    As   the   stabilizing   agent a   polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene   copolymer   with   the   molecular mass  of  6—10  thousand Da  is  used.<br>
The   ratio   of  the  perfluorocarbons   and  perfluorinated   terti¬ary  amines  is  2:1  or 3:1. In   the   preferable   embodiment   the   emulsion   comprises   the   main   rapidly<br>
eliminable perfluorocarbon in the form of cis- and trans- isomers of<br>
perfluorodecalin in an amount of 6 vol.% and admixtures of rapidly eliminable<br>
perfluorocarbons C7-C10 comprising a mixture of perflufluoromethylindane,<br>
perfluoro-1 -methyl-3-propylcyclohexane, trans-perfluoroindane, perfluoro-4-<br>
oxodecalin,	perfluorobutylcyclohexane,	perfluoropropylcyclohexane,<br>
perfluoroethylcyclohexane, perfluorobutylcyclopentane, cis-perfluoro- l-methyl-2-<br>
ethylcyclohexane in any ratio in a total amount of 0.7vol.%; the main slowly<br>
eliminable perfluorinated tertiary amine perfluoro-N-4-(methylcyclohexyl)-<br>
piperidine in the form of a mixture of isomers in an amount of 2.3 vol.% and an<br>
admixture of slowly eliminable perfluorinated tertiary amines Cn-Ci3<br>
comprising a mixture of perfluoro-N-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-2-methylpyrrolidine,<br>
perfluoromethylbutyl-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-amine, cis-and trans-isomers of<br>
perfluoromethylpropyl-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-amine,	isomers	of<br>
perfluoromethylpropyl-(methylcyclopentyl)- amine and	perfluoro-N-(4-<br>
methylcyclohexyl) -1-methylpiperidine in any ratio in a total amount of 1.0 vol.%; and also admixtures of H-perfluoroalkanes in an amount of 0.02 vol.%.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the ratio of the rapidly and slowly eliminable PFOC is 2:1. The content of the polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer with a molecular mass of 8 thou-<br><br>
sand Da is 4%, with the ratio of the polyoxyethylene and poly-oxypropylene blocks in the copolymer being 4:1.<br>
When the PFOC emulsion is used as a plasma substitute and for the perfusion of organs,  the physiologically acceptable aqueous-saline solution contains 102 mM of NaCl, 5.2 mM of KC1, 1.8 mM of MgCl2, 7.7 mM NaHC03/ 1.65 mM of NaH2P04 and 11 mM of D-glucose.<br>
When the emulsion is used for the anti-ischemic protection of the heart disconnected from the blood flow in the course of pharmaco-ice-chip cardioplegia, the aqueous-saline solution con¬tains 102 mM of NaCl, 5.2 mM of KC1, 1.8 mM of MgCl2, 7.7 mM Na-HC03, 1.65 mM of NaH2P04 and 11 mM of D-glucose, 5 mM of sodium pyruvate, 5 mM of sodium [}-oxybutyrate, 5 mM of sodium succinate, 5 mM of sodium glutamate, 5 mM of taurine.<br>
Such content and composition of perfluorocarbons and per-fluorinated tertiary amines corresponds to the composition of underrefined PFD and PFMCP which practically do not display any toxic properties either per se (in tests on isolated cultivated lymphoid cells) or in the formulation of the emulsion (in tests on small rodents and rodents), similarly to individual highly purified PFD and PFMCP containing no admixtures of other PFOC (Tables 1 and 2) , This should be accounted by that the toxicity of PFOC stems not from their form, but from the presence of un-derfluorinated admixtures. If the latter are absent, then the next factors responsible for the toxicity are the concentration of fluorine in the aqueous phase, the detergent properties of the stabilizing agent, the appearance of peroxides and the pres¬ence of coarse or easily coalescing particles in the emulsion. Death of large animals, e.g., of rabbits, can be caused, as it. follows from the data presented in Table 3 of the specification to RF Patent 2088217, by the use in the composition of the emul¬sion of exclusively rapidly eliminable highly lipophilic per-fluoroorganic compounds, whereas introducing a lipophobic, i.e., a slowly eliminable PFMCP component, leads to a decrease in the toxicity, as a result of which the survival of rabbits reaches<br><br>
100% during 60 days after administering 20 ml of the PFOC emul¬sion per kg of the body weight. A comparison of PFOC emulsions in terms of this parameter shows (Table 2) that the composition being patented by us does not cause death of rabbits even after 20-fold administration of the indicated dose. More than that, if the composition being patented is administered prior to, simul¬taneously with, or at least a weak after the administration, of an emulsion manufactured only from PFD (ensuring 100% death of rabbits), all the animals survive (Table 2).<br>
Impurity PFOCs present in the formulation of the emulsion have a structure close to the structure of the main PFOCs and constitute a number of PFOCs with gradually changing lipophilic-lipophobic properties (Fig. 1, Table 3). This contributes to the formation of a more homogeneous not clustered fluorocarbon phase inside the emulsion particles, increases the stability of the emulsion particles, decreases the intramolecular distillation phenomena responsible for coarsening of the particles, inhibits the aggregation of the particles both when they enter the blood flow and upon repeated freezing and upon contact with high-molecular oncotic agents of dextran nature (Table 4).<br>
The presence in the fluorocarbon phase of a set of PFOCs with manifest lipophobic properties, particularly of perfluori-nated tertiary amines displaced to the surface of the fluorocar¬bon phase, contributes to better interaction with the stabiliz¬ing agent, i.e., with a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer, and to retaining it in the adsorption layer. As a re¬sult, the surface of the emulsion particles becomes less loose, acquires improved rheological characteristics: a lower viscosity and, as a consequence, a higher dynamic oxygen capacity at the same value of the absolute oxygen capacity, as well as an in¬creased stability both in vitro (Table 4) and in the blood flow, which manifests itself in an increased time of the emulsion cir¬culation (Table 5).<br>
In the known literature sources no description can be found of PFOC emulsions comprising a mixture of several PFOC in struc-<br><br>
ture, which differ in the physicochemical parameters so that they constitute a series of compounds with the properties gradu¬ally changing from lipophilic to lipophilic ones.<br>
In FRG laid-open Application No. 4325100 Al a PFOC emulsion is described, containing admixtures of H-perfluoroalkanes in an amount of 1 to 5%. The authors of said Application believe that this makes it posbible to improve the oxygen-transporting prop¬erties of the emulsion and to lower its cost by reducing expen¬ditures for the PFOC purification. However, an analysis carried out by us has shown that the content of H-perf luoroalkanes higher than 1 wt.% (0.5 vol.%) can lead to the appearance of toxicity in the preparations of emulsions both for isolated cul¬tivated cells and for an integral organism.<br>
The composition of the PFOC determines the choice of a par¬ticular stabilizing agent.<br>
At present for the preparation of emulsions of rapidly eliminable PFOCs expensive phospholipids of organic origin are used, that have a high affinity for lipophilic PFOCs and require antioxidant additives for preventing peroxide oxidation. In the case of preparing binary compositions from two PFOCs relatively close in lipophilic-lipophobic properties (perfluorodecalin and perfluorotripropylamine), a mixture of phospholipids with a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer is used [USSR Patent No. 797546, belongs to Green Cross Corp.]. A synthetic cheap polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer is used for stabiliz¬ing emulsions containing lipophobic PFOCs. Such stabilizers are, for instance, perfluorobutylamine which is not eliminable from the organism of animals and therefore is used only in experi¬mental pharmacology and physiology, or PFMCP and, less success¬fully, mixtures of PFD with PFMCP. The PFOC composition proposed in the present invention, consisting of a mixture of several PFOCs with gradually changing lipophilic-lipophobic properties is also adequately stabilized in an emulsified form by a poly-oxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer, which makes the emulsion essentially cheaper and allows taking simple measures for mini-<br><br>
mizing the danger of the origination of hydroperoxides in the course of manufacturing and storing the emulsion, without addi¬tionally introducing antioxidants into the formulation.<br>
The second object of the present invention is accomplished by that in the known process for the preparation of a PFOC emul¬sion, which comprises mixing depyrogenized components by passing liquid PFOCs through an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent and multiple homogenizing of the resultant mixture in a two-circuit high-pressure homogenizer, according to the invention, before mixing the components, a mixture of liquid PFOCs and an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent are saturated with car¬bon dioxide gas, after that the aqueous solution of the stabi¬lizing agent is heated at a temperature not exceeding 75°C, then the mixture of liquid PFOCs is introduced in several jets into the cooled aqueous solution of the stabilizing agent under in¬tensive stirring and feeding carbon dioxide gas, simultaneously passing the resulting coarse-dispersed pro-emulsion several times through the first circuit of the homogenizer, whereafter the finely divided pro-emulsion is subjected to homogenization in the second circuit of the homogenizer till the required dis-persity is obtained with feeding carbon dioxide gas, and an aqueous-saline composition is added. The obtained medicinal form is poured into containers.<br>
Saturating the components to be mixed with carbon dioxide gas makes it possible to provide conditions under which in the course of manufacturing the emulsion the formation of peroxide compounds is minimized, the presence of which, as well as the presence of coarse particles, brings about the origination of reactogenicity of emulsions (Table 5). Under experimental condi¬tions the presence of reactogenicity was judged from the drop in the content of neutrophilic leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the rabbit after administering the emulsion in the dose of 10 ml per kg of the body weight. Quantitatively the degree of reac¬togenicity was calculated from the value of the neuroleptic in-<br><br>
dex: an increase of the neuroleptic index by more than 3 units is indicative of a noticeable reactogenicity of the emulsions [M.V.Berkos, Emulsions of Perfluorocarbon Compounds in Experi¬mental Intravenous Administration. Abstract of Candidate's The¬sis, Leningrad, 1991].<br>
Warming-up of the aqueous solution of the stabilizing agent (proxanol) makes it possible to depyrogenize the solution with¬out passing it through sorbents which impair the quality of the stabilizing agent and change its molecular-mass distribution and the surface-active properties. Deviations from the indicated temperature values impair the surface-active properties of the stabilizing agent or increase the content of hydroperoxides in it.<br>
Jet-like introducing of liquid PFOCs into the aqueous solu¬tion of the stabilizing agent with intensive stirring and simul¬taneous passing the resulting mixture through the high-pressure homogenizer contributes to speeding-up the process of preparing the pro-emulsion. The rate of PFOC feeding, stirring and passing the mixture through the homogenizer is regulated in such a man¬ner that the formation of the macroscopic PFOC/water interface is precluded, this being a prerequisite for obtaining a monodis-perse emulsion.<br>
Owing to sequential use of two homogenizer circuits, the number of recirculation cycles, compared with the prototype, is reduced from 12 to 9.<br>
Thus, the proposed process makes it possible to obtain large lots of emulsions, to minimize the formation of peroxide compounds, while preserving a high monodispersity of the emul¬sion particles on the level of 0.05-0.1 (Am (Table 6).<br>
The use of a mixture of underrefined perfluorocarbons and perfluorinated tertiary amines instead of individual highly pu¬rified PFOCs , as well as a simpler and more rapid technology provides a possibility to accomplish the third object of the in¬vention: to cut down expenses for manufacturing the emulsion and to reduce the cost of the preparation at least 2- or 5-fold, si-<br><br>
multaneously enhancing the stability and improving the rheologi™ cal properties of the emulsions. Thereby prospects are opened for industrial manufacturing and wider uses of PFOC emulsions in clinical practice.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention is further explained by a description of ex¬emplary embodiments thereof and by the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows temperature-composition phase diagrams of two-component PFOC-hexane systems, wherein the temperature in °C is plotted along the Y-axis and the proportion of PFOCs in the two-component system in relative units is plotted along the X-axis;<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagram of a device for preparing a me¬dicinal form of the PFOC emulsion, according to the invention.<br>
The essence of the invention is explained by Fig. 1, in which temperature-composition phase diagrams of two-component PFOC-hexane systems are presented for different kinds of PFOCs, including those entering into the PFOC emulsion formulation be¬ing patented.<br>
The zone for PFMCP admixtures is shown at "a", the zone for PFD admixtures is shown at "b", arrow "c" indicates the direc¬tion to the area of lipophobic slowly eliminable PFOCs, and ar¬row "d" indicates the direction to the area of lipophobic rap¬idly eliminable PFOCs.<br>
It is seen that PFMCP admixtures and PFD admixtures occupy an intermediate position in respect of the phase diagrams and critical temperatures of dissolution in hexane. Consequently, the composition of PFOCs in the emulsion particJ.es is a mixture of substances with gradually changing properties, this ensuring their full-value mutual dissolution, without forming separate clusters which disturb the homogeneity a'nd stability of the emulsion particles.<br><br>
The essence of the process being patented is illustrated by Fig. 2, wherein a homogenizer is shown diagrammatically with a first circuit A and a second circuit B. The first circuit A com¬prises a thermostated reactor 1 with a high-speed stirrer 2, a high-pressure chamber 3, a selector valve 4. The second circuit B comprises a thermostated reactor 5 with a high-speed stirrer 6, a high-pressure chamber 7, an outlet selector valve 8 and re¬ceiving containers 8.<br>
The process of preparing the PFOC emulsion is carried out in the following manner. The thermostated reactor 1 of the first circuit of the homogenizer is charged with an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent, saturated with carbon dioxide gas, and heated for 12—14 hours at a temperature not higher than 75°C. Then the stabilizer agent solution' is cooled down, and a mixture of sterilized depyrogenized PFOCs saturated with carbon dioxide gas is fed jetwise, with the high-speed stirrer 2 switched on, into said solution. The resulting coarse pro-emulsion is passed several times through the first high-pressure chamber 3 at a pressure of 300—400 kg/cm2 with constant feeding carbon dioxide gas into the reactor. Then the stream of the pro-emulsion is di¬rected with the help of the valve 4 to the second thermostated reactor 5 of the second circuit of the homogenizer and passed several times through the second high-pressure chamber 7 at a pressure of 400-500 kg/cm2 till particles of a required size are obtained. The process of homogenization is conducted with con¬stant cooling of the reactors and with feeding carbon dioxide gas into both reactors. Then a sterile apyrogenic aqueous-saline solution (ASS) , with the stirrer 6 switched on, is fed into the reactor 5, and after said solution is stirred uniformly with the PFOC mixture, the resulting medicinal form of the PFOC emulsion is directed with the help of the valve 8 to dispensing into the receiving containers 9.<br>
It is known to use emulsions of perfluoroorganic compounds for treating anemias of different genesis, heraorrhagic, trau¬matic, burn, cardiogenic shock ischemic injuries of the heart<br><br>
and brain, craniocerebral injuries, disturbances of the coronary and cerebral blood flow, as a highly effective perfusion medium for the preservation of organs intended for transplantation, for the perfusion and perfusionless anti-ischemia protection of the myocardium in reparative operations on the heart, for use in ar¬tificial circulation apparatus, in regional perfusion of ex¬tremities when carrying out chemo- and radiotherapy, as contrast media in X-ray, ultrasonic and NMR diagnoses of vascular dis¬eases, as means for acting on the immune system, and also in. pharmacological, physiological and biophysical investigations carried out on organs subjected to perfusion.<br>
It is proposed to use the emulsion obtained by us, in addi¬tion to the above-cited applications, for treating air-and-fat vascular embolism, obliterating vascular diseases of extremi¬ties, for the detoxication in the case of poisoning with lipo-philic toxic compounds, and for the prophylaxis of toxic inju¬ries caused by various xenobiotics.<br>

In the reactor 5 of the second circuit of the homogenizer the obtained submicron emulsion was mixed with a concentrated aqueous-saline formulation,  so that the finished medicinal form of the emulsion contained 10 vol.% of PFOC, 4% of the stabilizing agent, 102 mM of NaCl, 5.2 mM .of KC1, 1.8 mM of MgCl2/  7.7 mM of NaHC03,  1.65 mM of NaH2P04 and 11 mM of D-glucose.

was 100% after 3 months of observations. After storing the emul¬sion in frozen form and fivefold freezing-defrosting thereof the size of the emulsion particles was 0.11 µm (Table 4).<br>
Example 2<br>
The emulsion was prepared as described in Example 1, but<br>
with the ratio of the rapidly and slowly eliminable PFOCs 3:1,<br>
with the amount in the composition of rapidly eliminable per-<br>

The pro-emulsion was passed three times through the high-pressure chamber 3 of the first circuit of the homogenizer at the pressure of 450 kg/cm2, the emulsion was passed five times through the high-pressure chamber 7 of the second circuit of the homogenizer at the pres-' sure of 550 kg/cm2. The mean diameter of the particles of the ob¬tained PFOC emulsion was 0.07 µm, the proportion of 0.2-0.3 µm-diameter particles was 0.9%. The LD50 value for mice was 150 mg per kg of the body weight. An apyrogenic PFOC emulsion was ob¬tained with the concentration of peroxide compounds of 75 mM. The survival of rabbits after intravenous administration of 20 ml of the PFOC emulsion per kg was 100% during 90 days of obser¬vations .<br>
The emulsion was used for the replacement of 55% blood losses in dogs and for 65% blood substitution in rats. The sur¬vival of the animals was 100%.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
The PFOC emulsion was prepared as described in Example 2 and used as a perfusion composition for the preservation of a canine kidney in a recirculatory regime in normothermal perfu¬sion. The time of preservation of the kidney before the perfu¬sion pressure buildup (before the development of a tissue edema) was 36 hours. In the course of perfusion the emulsion was changed every 9 hours. In grafting the kidney to be perfused to a recipient dog, the transplant started excreting urine immedi¬ately after the restoration of the blood flow.<br>
Example 4<br>
The emulsion was prepared as described in Example 1, but a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer with the average mo¬lecular mass of 6 thousand Da was used as the stabilizing agent, the PFOC pro-emulsion was finely divided in the chamber 3 of the first circuit of the homogenizer at the pressure of 500 kg/cm2, the emulsion was finely divided in the chamber 7 of the second circuit of the homogenizer at the pressure of 550 kg/cm2, the aqueous-saline formulation of the finished medicinal form of the PFOC emulsion comprised 102 mM of NaCl, 5.2 mM of KC1, 1.8 mM of MgCl2, 7.7 mM of NaHC03, 1.65 mM of NaH2P04, and 11 mM of D-glucose, 5 mM of sodium pyruvate, 5 mM of sodium p-oxybutyrate, 5 mM of sodium succinate, 5 mM of sodium glutamate, 5 mM of tau-rine. The mean diameter of the particles of the obtained PFOC emulsion was 0.06 µm, the proportion of the 0.2—0.3 µm-diameter particles was 1.1%. The LD50 for mice was 130 ml per kg of the body weight. The concentration of peroxide compounds was 100 µM. The emulsion was used for pharmaco-ice-chip cardioplegia. A ca¬nine heart was isolated in a single heart-lung apparatus and perfused with the PFOC emulsion cooled down to 16°C for 30 min¬utes. Then the heart was disconnected from the perfusion system and kept immersed into the PFOC emulsion at the temperature of 6°C for 4 hours. After that the heart was coupled to the perfu  sion system filled with the PFOC emulsion and perfused for 15 at<br><br>
16°C, whereafter the heart was coupled to the femoral vessels of a recipient dog. On four out of six cases the electric and con¬tractile activity of the heart restored upon transplantation without additional electrostimulation; in two cases after the first discharge of an electrostimulator „ In all the cases no symptoms of cardiac insufficiency were observed.<br>
Example 5<br>
A method of treating air-and-fat vascular embolism. Air-and-fat embolism was induced in the experiment by administering intrave¬nously to rabbits 10 ml of a coarse-dispersed emulsion of corn oil in water with 10 to 300 µm particles and with fine air bub¬bles. The experiment was carried out on 22 animals weighing 3— 3.5 kg. The PFOC emulsion prepared in accordance with the proce¬dure described in Example 2, was administered to the rabbit in¬travenously 20 minutes after the loss of consciousness or 3—4 minutes after the disturbance of the respiration rhythm or res¬piratory standstill. The treatment of fat and air embolism is based on using to advantage an extremely large sorption surface of the emulsion particles, a relative excess of the surfactant in the adsorption layer of the particles and in the aqueous phase, the ability of highly dispersed particles to penetrate into partly obturated vessels and to induce emulsification, re¬duction of the size and sorption of fat and air drops, as a re¬sult of which the patency of the vessels and the mass metabolism are restored. The curative effectiveness of the PFOC emulsion manifested itself in bringing animals out of coma and the state of clinical death resulting from the respiratory standstill be¬cause of the blood flow disturbance in the brain of animals. Be¬fore administering the whole amount of the PFOC emulsion (10—15 ml per kg of the body weight) was completed, rabbits regained consciousness, opened their eyes, papillary reflexes became re¬stored. Administering the PFOC emulsion after the disturbance of respiration contributed to the restoration of even breathing of the animals during several minutes and ensured restoration of<br><br>
independent breathing in the case of respiration standstill and coupling the animal to an apparatus for artificial ventilation of the lungs.<br>
Example 6<br>
A method of treating obliterating vascular injury of ex¬tremities. Obliterating atherosclerosis was modeled in rabbits by overfeeding them with substances enriched with products with a high content of cholesterol. The rheological characteristics of the blood flow in extremities were determined by ultrasound Doppler echography, and the dynamics of partial oxygen pressure (p02) in the tissues of the femur and crus of the hind leg was determined with the help of noninvasive sensors. For comparing the curative effect, intravenous administration of rheopolyglu-cinum, a well-known rheologically active preparation, was used. The rheopolyglucinum (5 ml per kg of the body weight) improved the blood flow by 10±3% and increased the tissue p02 on an aver¬age by 6±2%. After the intravenous administration of the PFOC emulsion in the dose of 5 ml per kg of the body weight, an im¬provement of the blood flow was also observed, like after the administration of rheopolyglucinum, but in this case the value<br>
of the tissue pC&gt;2 pressure increased by 25±5% (p
Example 7<br>
A method of treating toxic injuries caused by lipophilic compounds. The PFOC emulsion prepared as described in Example 1 was used as a means sorbing lipophilic compounds which have en¬tered the blood flow, for instance, ethanol. Thereby the acting concentration of these lipophilic compounds is reduced and their entrance into the tissues is slowed down. A lethal dose of 33% aqueous ethanol was administered per os to ten rats with a body weight of 250—290 g in dosage of 4 g of ethanol per kg of body weight. 8 animals died. Ten rats of the second group, after ad¬ministration of a lethal dose of ethanol to them, were adminis-<br><br>
tered intravenously the PFOC emulsion in dosage of 5 ml per kg of body weight. Only 1 rat died.<br>
Example 8<br>
A method of preventing toxic injuries<br>
A) . The PFOC emulsion prepared as described in Example 1 was used as a means which inhibits in early periods after the accumulation of PFOCs in the liver the functioning of the mono-oxygenase system of the liver, for decreasing the injurious ef¬fect of heterologous xenobiotics whose metabolic products have a greater toxicity than the starting substances. In an experiment on rats, for decreasing toxic consequences of ether anesthesia, inhibition of the detoxication function of the liver was induced by intravenous administration of the PFOC emulsion 6 hours be¬fore the ether anesthesia. Inhibition of the ethyl ether metabo¬lism decreases the rate of formation of ether hydroxylation products which are more toxic than the ether itself. In rats not pretreated with the PFOC emulsion a twofold overdosage with ether anesthesia during one day caused the development of pro¬nounced fat infiltration and diffuse dystrophic changes in the liver tissue during 3-4 days. If the animals were administered intravenously the PFOC emulsion in a dose of 5—7 ml per kg of body weight 6 hours before the first ether anesthesia, then the subsequent twofold overdosage of the ether anesthesia caused only insignificant diffuse changes of the liver without develop¬ment of the fat infiltration of the tissue.<br>
B) . The PFOC emulsion prepared as described in Example 1 was used as a means activating in the late periods after the PFOC accumulation in the liver the functioning of the monooxygenase system of the liver for decreasing the injurious effect of het¬erologous xenobiotics whose metabolic products have a smaller toxicity than the starting substances. In. an experiment on rats, for decreasing toxic consequences of chloroform anesthesia, it was necessary to accelerate the chloroform metabolism in the liver tissue. For this purpose, 4 days before the chloroforra an-<br><br>
esthesia carried out with an overdosage of up to respiration disturbance, 5 rats were administered intravenously 7 ml of the PFOC emulsion prepared as described in Example I. One day before the chloroform anesthesia the condition of the liver was checked against the duration of hexenal sleep: this duration decreased to 1.5—3 minutes, i.e., 5- to 7-fold compared with the duration of hexenal sleep in intact animals, which lasted 18—20 minutes, this being, as it was shown earlier by V.V.Obraztsov et al. [Obraztsov V., Sklifas A., Maevskii E., Shekhtman D. , Kukushkin N. Is the induction of cytochrome P-450 a cause of rabbit death after injection of perfluorodecalin emulsion? // Cytochrome P-450: Biochemistry and Biophysics. 1992, INCO-TNC, Moscow, 597-600] , a consequence of a 2- to 3-fold increase in the amount of cytochrome P-450 of the phenobarbital type in hepatocytes. The liver of the animals not treated with the PFOC emulsion, after the overdosage of the chloroform anesthesia, bore the signs of destruction, swelling of cells and mitochondria, pronounced fat infiltration. In the animals administered with the PFOC emulsion 4 days before the chloroform anesthesia overdosage, in spite of a large dose of chloroform, considerable destruction and fat in¬filtration of hepatocytes were not observed. The duration of re¬tention of an increased detoxicating activity of the liver ap¬proximately coincided with period of half-elimination of the rapidly eliminable PFOCs accumulated by the liver cells after the intravenous administration of the PFOC emulsion<br><br>
