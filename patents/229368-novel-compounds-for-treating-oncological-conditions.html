Each of these applications is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds and methods of using those compounds to treat oncological conditions.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Basic research has recently provided the life sciences community with an unprecedented volume of information on the human genetic code and the proteins that are produced by it In 2001, the complete sequence of the human genome was reported (Lander, E.S. et al. Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome. Nature (2001) 409:860; Venter, J.C. et al. The sequence of the human genome. Science (2001) 291:1304). Increasingly, the global research community is now classifying the 50,000+ proteins that are encoded by this genetic sequence, ' and more importantly, it is attempting to identify those proteins that are causative of major, under-treated human diseases.<br>
Despite the wealth of information that the human genome and its proteins are providing, particularly in the area of conformational control of protein function, the methodology and strategy by which the pharmaceutical industry sets about to develop small molecule therapeutics has not significantly advanced beyond using native protein active sites for binding to small molecule therapeutic agents. These native active sites are normally used by proteins to perform essential cellular functions by binding to and processing natural substrates or tranducing signals from natural ligands. Because these native pockets are used broadly by many other proteins<br><br>
within protein families, drugs which interact with them are often plagued by lack of selectivity and; as a consequence, insufficient therapeutic windows to achieve maximum efficacy. Side effects and toxicities are revealed in such small molecules, either during preclinical discovery, clinical trials, or later in the marketplace. Side effects and toxicities continue to be a major reason for the high attrition rate seen within the drug development process. For the kinase protein family of proteins, interactions at these native active sites have been recently reviewed: see J. Dumas, ProteinKinaseInhibitors: Emerging Pharmacophores 1997-2001, Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents (2001) 11:405-429; J. Dumas, Editor, New challenges in Protein Kinase Inhibition, in Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry (2002) 2: issue 9.<br>
It is known that proteins are flexible, and this flexibility has been reported and utilized with the discovery of the small molecules which bind to alternative, flexible active sites with proteins. For review of this topic, see Teague, Nature Reviews/Drug Discovery, Vol. 2, pp. 527-541 (2003). See also,Wu Qt dl., Structure, Vol 11, pp. 399-410 (2003). However these reports focus on small molecules which bind only to proteins at the protein natural active sites. Peng et al., Bio. Organic and Medicinal ChemistiyLtrs., Vol. 13, pp. 3693-3699 (2003), and Schindler, et al., Science, Vol. 289, p. 1938 (2000) describe inhibitors of abl kinase. These inhibitors are identified in WO Publication No. 2002/034727. This class of inhibitors binds to the ATP active site while also binding in a mode that induces movement of the kinase catalytic loop. Pargellis et al., Nature Structural Biology, Vol 9, p. 268 (2002) reported inhibitors p38 alpha-kinase also disclosed in WO Publication No. 00/43384 and Regan et al., /. Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 45, pp. 2994-3008 (2002). This class of inhibitors also interacts with the kinase at the ATP active site involving a concomitant movement of the kinase activation loop.<br>
More recently, it has been disclosed that kinases utilize activation loops and kinase domain regulatory pockets to control their state of catalytic activity. This has been recently reviewed (see, e.g., M Huse and J. Kuriyan, Cell (2002) 109:275).<br>

With respect to the methods of the invention, the activation state of a kinase is determined by the interaction of switch control ligands and complemental switch control pockets.  One conformation of the kinase may result from the switch control ligand's interaction with a particular switch control pocket while another conformation may result from the ligand's interaction with a different switch control pocket. Generally interaction of the ligand with one pocket, such as the "on" pocket, results in the kinase assuming an active conformation wherein the kinase is biologically active. Similarly, an inactive conformation (wherein the kinase is not biologically active) is assumed when the ligand interacts with another of the switch control pockets, such as the "off* pocket. The switch control pocket can be selected from the group consisting of simple, composite and combined switch control pockets. Interaction between the switch control ligand and the switch control pockets is dynamic and therefore,"the ligand is not always interacting with a switch control pocket. In some instances, the ligand is not in a switch control pocket (such as occurs when the protein is changing from an active conformation to an inactive conformation).  In other instances, such as when the ligand is interacting with the environment surrounding the protein in order to determine with which switch control pocket to interact, the ligand is not in a switch control pocket. Interaction of the ligand with particular switch control pockets is controlled in part by the charge status of the amino acid residues of the switch control ligand. When the ligand is in a neutral charge state, it interacts with one of the switch control pockets and when it is in a charged state, it interacts with the other of the switch control pockets.1 For example, the switch control ligand may have a plurality of OH groups and be in a neutral charge state. This neutral charge state results in a ligand that is more likely to interact with one of the switch control pockets through hydrogen boding between the OH groups and selected residues of the pocket, thereby resulting in whichever protein conformation results from that interaction. However, if the OH groups of the switch control ligand become charged through phosphorylation or some other means, the propensity of the ligand to interact with the other of the switch control pockets will increase and the ligand will interact with this other switch control pocket through complementary covalent binding between the negatively or positively charged residues of the pocket and ligand. This will result in the protein assuming the opposite conformation assumed when the ligand was in a neutral charge state and interacting with the<br><br>
other switch control pocket.<br>
Of course, the conformation of the protein determines the activation state of the protein and can therefore play arole in protein-related diseases, processes, and conditions. For example, if a metabolic process requires a biologically active protein but the protein's switch control ligand remains in the switch control pocket (i.e. the "off' pocket) that results in a biologically inactive protein, that metabolic process cannot occur at a normal rate. Similarly, if a disease is exacerbated by a biologically active protein and the protein's switch control ligand remains in the switch control pocket (i.e. the "on" pocket) that results in the biologically active protein conformation, the disease condition will be worsened. Accordingly, as demonstrated by the present invention, selective modulation of the switch control pocket and switch control ligand by the selective administration of a molecule will play an important role in the treatment and control of protein-related diseases, processes, and conditions.<br>
One aspect cf the invention provides a method of modulating the activation state of a kinase, preferably abl or bcr-abl alpha-kinase and including both the consensus wild type sequence and disease polymorphs thereof. The activation state is generally selected from an upregulated or downregulated state. The method generally comprises the step of contacting the kinase with a molecule having the general formula (I). When such contact occurs, the molecule will bind to a particular switch control pocket and the switch control ligand will have a greater propensity to interact with the other of the switch control pockets (i.e., the unoccupied one) and a lesser propensity to interact with the occupied switch control pocket. As a result, the protein will have a greater propensity to assume either an active or inactive conformation (and consequenctly be upregulated or downregulated), depending upon which of the switch control pockets is occupied by the molecule. Thus, contacting the kinase with a molecule modulates that protein's activation state.- The molecule can act as an antagonist or an agonist of either switch control pocket. The contact between the molecule and the kinase preferably occurs at a region of a switch control pocket of the kinase and more preferably in an interlobe oxyanion pocket of the kinase. In some instances, the contact between the molecule and the pocket also results in the alteration of the conformation of other adjacent sites and pockets, such as an ATP active site. Such an alteration can also effect regulation and modulation of the active state of the protein. Preferably, the region of the switch control pocket of theJcinase comprises an amino acid residue sequence operable for binding to the Formula I molecule. Such binding can occur between the<br><br>
molecule and a specific region of the switch control pocket with preferred regions including the oc-C helix, the a-D helix, the catalytic loop, the activation loop, and the C-tenninal residues or C-lobe residues (all residues located downstream (toward the C-end) from the Activation loop), and combinations thereof. When the binding region is the cc-C helix, one preferred binding sequence in this helix is the sequence VEEFLKEAAVM, (SEQ ID NO. 2). When the binding region is the catalytic loop, one preferred binding sequence in this loop is HRDLAAJRNXL (SEQ ID NO. 3). When the binding region is the activation loop, one preferred binding sequence in this loop is a sequence selected from the group consisting of DFGLSRLMT (SEQ ID NO.4), GDTYTAH (SEQ ID NO. 5), and combinations thereof. When the binding region is in the C-lobe residues, one preferred binding residue is F, found at position 416 relative to the full length sequence (residue 194 in SEQ ID NO. 1). When a biologically inactive protein conformation is desired, molecules which interact with the switch control pocket that normally results in a biologically active protein conformation (when interacting with the switch control ligand) will be selected. Similarly, when a biologically active protein conformation is desired, molecules which interact with the switch control pocket that normally results in a biologically inactive protein conformation (when interacting with the switch control ligand) will be selected. Thus, the propensity of the protein to assume a desired conformation will be modulated by administration of the molecule. In preferred forms, the molecule will be administered to an individual undergoing treatment for cancer including but not limited to chronic myelogenous .leukemia and stromal gastrointestinal tumors. In such forms, it will be desired to select molecules that interact with the switch control pocket that generally leads to-a biologically active protein conformation so that the protein will have the propensity to assume the biologically inactive form and thereby alleviate the condition. It is contemplated that the molecules of the present invention will be administerable in any conventional form including oral, parenteral, inhalation, and subcutaneous. It is preferred for the administration to.be in the oral form. Preferred molecules include the preferred formula (I) compounds discussed above.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating cancer comprising the step of administering a molecule having the structure of the formula (I) compounds to the individual. Such conditions are often the result of an overproduction of the biologically active form of a protein, including kinases! For example, a hallmark feature of chronic myelogeneous leukemia involves areciprocal chromosomal translocation involving human chromosomes 9 and<br><br>
22. This mutation fuses a segment of the bcr gene upstream of the second exon of the c-abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase gene. This fusion protein is called bcr-abl. While the normal c-abl gene and its protein are tightly controlled in normal cells, the fusion protein product bcr-abl presents with elevated, constitutive kinase activity. It is this activity that enables bcr-abl fusion protein to transform cells and cause malignancy. Thus, the invention discloses and utilizes small molecule inhibitors of bcr-abl kinase. These inhibitors contain functionality which enable them to bind to an binding region, preferably an interlobe oxyanion regulator pocket in abl kinase. The * inhibitors may also contain functionality which bind to the ATP pocket or other kinase amino acid residues taken from the N-lobe or C-lobe of the kinase.<br>
The administering step generally includes the step of causing said molecule to contact a kinase involved with elevated kinase activity such as that found in cancer. A particularly preferred kinase to contact is bcr-abl kinase. When the contact is between the molecule and a kinase, the contact preferably occurs in a binding region (preferably an interlobe oxyanion pocket of the kinase) that includes an amino acid residue sequence operable for binding to the Formula I molecule. Preferred binding regions of the interlobe oxyanion pocket include the a-C helix region, the catalytic loop, the activation loop, the C-terminal lobe or residues, and combinations thereof. When the binding region is the a-C helix, one preferred-binding sequence in this helix is. the sequence VEEFLKEAAVM (SEQ ID NO. 2). When the binding region is the catalytic loop, one preferred binding sequence in this loop is HRDLAARNXL (SEQ ID NO. 3). When the binding region is the activation loop, one preferred binding sequence in this loop is a sequence selected from the group consisting of DFGLSRLMT (SEQ ID NO.4), GDTYTAH (SEQ ID NO. 5), and combinations thereof; A preferred residue with which to bind in the C-terminal lobe is F.<br>
Such a method permits treatment of cancer by virtue of the modulation of the activation state of a kinase by contacting the kinase with a molecule that associates with the switch control pocket that normally leads to a biologically active form of the kinase when interacting with the switch control ligand. Because the ligand cannot easily interact with the switch control pocket associated with or occupied by the molecule, the ligand tends to interact with the switch control pocket leading to the biologically inactive form of the protein, with the attendant result of a decrease in the amount of biologically active protein. Preferably, the cancer i's selected from the group consisting of chronic mylogeneous leukemia and stromal gastrointestinal tumors. As with<br><br>
the other methods of the invention, the molecules may be administered in any conventional fonn, with any conventional excipients or ingredients. However, it is preferred to administer the molecule in an oral dosage form. Preferred molecules are again selected from the group consisting of the preferred formula (I) compounds as discussed above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention provides a way of rationally developing new small molecule modulators which interact with naturally occurring proteins (e.g., mammalian, and especially human proteins) in order to modulate the activity of the proteins. Novel protein-small molecule adducts are also provided. The invention preferably makes use of naturally occurring proteins having a conformational property whereby the proteins change their conformations in vivo with a corresponding change in protein activity. For example, a given enzyme protein in one conformation maybe biologically upregulated, while in another conformation, the same protein may be biologically downregulated. The invention preferably makes use of one mechanism of conformation change utilized by naturally occurring proteins, through the interaction of what are termed "switch control ligands" and "switch control pockets" within the protein.<br>
As used herein, "switch control ligand" means a region or domain within a naturally occurring protein and having one or more amino acid residues therein which are transiently modified in vivo between individual states by biochemical modification, typically phosphorylation, sulfation, acylation or oxidation. Similarly, "switch control pocket" means a plurality of contiguous or non-contiguous,amino acid residues within a naturally occurring protein and comprising residues capable of binding in vivo with transiently modified residues of a switch control ligand in one of the individual states thereof in order to induce or restrict the conformation of the protein and thereby modulate the biological activity of the protein, and/or which is capable of binding with a non-naturally occurring switch control modulator molecule to induce or restrict a protein conformation and thereby modulate the biological activity of the protein.<br>
A protein-modulator adduct in accordance with the invention comprises a naturally occurring protein having a switch control pocket with a non-naturally occurring molecule bound to the protein at the region of said switch control pocket, said molecule serving to at least partially regulate the biological activity of said protein by inducing or restricting the conformation of the protein. Preferably, the protein also has a corresponding switch control ligand, the ligand interacting in vivo with the pocket to regulate the conformation and biological activity of the protein such that the protein will assume a first conformation and a first biological<br><br>
activity upon the iigand-pocket interaction, and will assume a second, different conformation and biological activity in the absence of the Iigand-pocket interaction.<br>
The nature of the switch control ligand/switch control pocket interaction may be understood from a consideration of schematic Figs. 1-4. Specifically, in Fig. 1, a protein 100 is illustrated in schematic form to include an "on" switch control pocket 102, and "off' switch control pocket 104, and a switch control Iigand 106. In addition, the schematically depicted protein also includes an ATP active site 108. In the exemplary protein of Fig. 1, the Iigand 106 has three amino acid residues with side chain OH groups 110. The off pocket 104^ contains corresponding X residues 112 and the on pocket 102 has Z residues 114. In the exemplary instance, the protein 100 will change its conformation depending upon the charge status of the OH groups 110 on Iigand 106, i.e., when the OH groups are unmodified, a neutral charge is-presented, but when these groups are phosphorylated a negative charge is presented.<br>
The functionality of the pockets 102, 104 and Iigand 106 can be understood from a consideration of Figs. 2-4. In Fig. 2, the Iigand 106 is shown operatively interacted with the off pocket 104 such that the OH groups 110 interact with the X residues 112 forming a part of the pocket 104. Such interaction is primarily by virtue of hydrogen bonding between the OH groups 110 and the residues 112. As seen, this ligand/pocket interaction causes the protein 100 to assume a conformation different from that seen in Fig. 1 and corresponding to the off or biologically downregulated conformation of the protein.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the situation where the Iigand 106 has shifted from the off pocket interaction conformation of Fig. 2 and the OH groups 110 have been phosphorylated, giving a negative charge to the Iigand. In this condition, the Iigand has a strong propensity to interact with on pocket 102, to thereby change the protein conformation to the on or biologically upregulated state (Fig. 4). Fig. 4a illustrates that the phosphorylated groups on the Iigand 106 are attracted to positively charged residues 114 to achieve an ionic-like stabilizing bond. Note that in the on conformation of Fig. 4, the protein conformation is different than the off conformation of Fig. 2, and that the ATP active site is available and the protein is fiinctional as a kinase enzyme.<br>
Figs. 1-4 illustrate a simple situation where the protein exhibits discrete pockets 102 and 104 and Iigand 106. However, in many cases a more complex switch control pocket pattern is observed. Fig. 6 illustrates a situation where an appropriate pocket for small molecule interaction is formed from amino acid residues taken both from Iigand 106 and, for example, from pocket<br><br>
102. This is termed a "composite switch control pocket" made up of residues from both the ligand 106 and a pocket, and is referred to by the numeral 120. A small molecule 122 is illustrated which interacts with the pocket 120 for protein modulation purposes.<br>
Another more complex switch pocket is depicted in Fig. 7 wherein the pocket includes residues from on pocket 102, and ATP site 10S to create what is termed a "combined switch control pocket." Such a combined pocket is referred to as numeral 124 and may also include residues from ligand 106. An appropriate small molecule 126 is illustrated with pocket 124 for protein modulation purposes.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that while in the simple pocket situation of Figs. 1-4, the small molecule will interact with the simple pocket 102 or 104, in the more complex situations of Figs. 6 and 7 the interactive pockets are in the regions of the pockets 120 orl24. Thus, broadly the the small molecules interact "at the region" of the respective switch control pocket.<br><br>

V.       Biological assessment of abl and bcr-abl kinase inhibiton.<br>
A continuous spectrophotometry kinase assay is used, wherein the production of adenosine diphosphate is coupled to the oxidation of NADH and measured as a reduction in absorbance at 340nM. For details see: Barker, S.C. et al, Biochemistry (1995) 34:14843; and Schindler, T. etal, Science (2000) 289:1938.<br>
Abl kinase assay<br>
Activity of nonphosphorylated Abl kinase was determined by following the production of ADP from the . kinase reaction through coupling with the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system (e.g., Schindler, et al. Science (2000) 289, 1938-1942). In this assay, the oxidation of NADH (thus the decrease at A340nm) was continuous measured spectrophametrically. The reaction mixture (200 jxl) contained Abl kinase (3.7 nM. Abl-2 from deCode), peptide substrate (EAIYAAPFAKKK, 0.5 mM), ATP (0.5 mM), MgCl2 (5 mM), pyruvate kinase (16 units), lactate dehydrogenase (26 units), phosphoenol pyruvate (1<br><br>
mM), and NADH (0.28 a\I) in 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. the reaction was initiated by adding ATP. The absorption at 340 nm was monitored continuously for 3 to 4 hours at 30 °C on Polarstar Optima plate reader (BMG). Under these conditions, a turn over number (k^x) of 1.4 s'1 was obtained for the preparation of Abl kinase, which is similar to that (1.7 s"1) reported for the nonphosphorylated enzyme (Brasher and Van Etten, JBC (2000) 275, 35631-35637). No autophosphorylation of Abl was observed under these conditions since the rate is constant throughout the entire reaction time and presumably because the concentration of the enzyme used is below the critical level (~ 10 nM) needed for the autophosphorylation (Brasher and Van Etten, JBC (2000) 275, 35631-35637). These results ensure what we monitored was the activity of nonphosphorylated Abl kinase.<br>
Percentage of inhibition in the presence of an inhibitor wasobtained by comparison of reaction rate (or slope) widi that of a control. IC50 value was calculated from a series of % inhibition values determined at a range of concentrations of the inhibitor using Prism. The IC50 values for Gleveec and PD 180970 were found to be 76 and 24 nM, respectively, which are close to that reported (Schindler, et al. Science (2000) 289, 1938-1942).<br><br><br><br><br>
