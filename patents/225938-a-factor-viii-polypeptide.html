				<td>FACTOR  VIII POLYPEPTIDE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to Factor VIII polypeptides that are more stable than full-length<br>
Factor VIII. The present invention also relates to a method of administering the Factor VIII<br>
polypeptide to a subject to treat a blood disorder. The invention further relates to a nucleic acid<br>
construct including DNA encoding the Factor VIII polypeptide. The invention relates to a<br>
method of expressing Factor VIII in a mammal by administering the gene construct to the<br>
subject. The invention is further related to antibodies specific for the Factor VIII polypeptide.<br>
General Background and State of the Art:<br>
Hemophilia A results from the quantitative or qualitative deficiency of Factor VIII (FVIII),<br>
necessitating exogenous replacement by either plasma- or recombinant-derived FVIII<br>
preparations. FVIII has a domain organization of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 and is synthesized as a<br>
2,351-amino acid single-chain glycoprotein of 280 kDa (Eaton, D. et al., 1986, Biochemistry 25:<br>
505-512; Tdole, J. J. et al., 1984, Nature 312: 342; Vehar, G. A. et al., 1984, Nature 312: 337).<br>
Whereas the A and C domains exhibit 35-40% amino acid identity to each other and to the A and<br>
C domains of coagulation factor V, the B domain is not homologous to any known protein.<br>
Intracellular, proteolytic processing after residue Arg-1648 within the B domain generates an 80-<br>
kDa light chain (domains A3-C1-C2) and a heterogeneous-sized heavy chain of 90-200 kDa<br>
(domains A1-A2-B). The heavy and light chains are associated as a heterodimer through a<br>
divalent metal-ion-dependent linkage between the Al and A3 domains. In plasma, FVIII<br>
circulates in an inactive form bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF) and requires proteolytic<br>
cleavage by thrombin or Factor Xa for activation (Eaton, D., et al., 1986, Biochemistry 25: 505-<br>
512; Girma, J. P. et al., 1987, Blood 70: 605-611; Koedam, J. A. et al., 1990, Eur. J. Biochem.<br>
189: 229-234). Thrombin cleavage after Arg (R) residues 372, 740, and 1689 activates FVIII<br>
coagulant activity, resulting in the complete removal of the B domain. The resulting FVilla<br>
heterotrimer retains the metal ion-dependent linkage between the Al and A3-C1-C2 subunits,<br>
whereas A2 is associated with a weak affinity by electrostatic interactions (Eaton, D. et al., 1986,<br>
Biochemistry 25: 505-512; Fay, P. J. et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266: 8957-8962; Pittman, D. D.<br>
&amp; Kaufman, R. J. 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2429-2433).<br>
With an increased understanding of the biosynthesis, structure, and function of FVin, studies<br>
have attempted to produce improved FVIII molecules for replacement therapy for patients with<br>
hemophilia A. Strategies investigated thus far have included the deletion or modification of<br>
FVIII sequences, resulting in more efficient expression. Previous studies on the requirements for<br>
functional activity of FVIII demonstrated that cleavage after Arg residues 372 and 1689 both<br>
were required for activation of FVIII and that the B domain was not required for functional<br>
activity (Eaton, D. L. et al., 1986, Biochemistry 25: 8343; Burke, R.L. et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem<br>
261: 12574; Toole, J. J. et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 5939). In order to test this<br>
hypothesis, several approaches such as the deletion, in the complementary DNA (cDNA), of<br>
large DNA fragments corresponding to domain B, giving shorter FVIII derivatives (Eaton, D. L.<br>
et al., 1986, Biochemistry 25: 8343; Burke, R.L. et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem 261: 12574) were<br>
conducted and tested for their coagulation activity.<br>
PCT application WO 86/06101 discloses that recombinant FVIII proteins with deletions of up to<br>
880 amino acids in the central region still exhibit FVIII activity. In addition, Eaton et al., 1986,<br>
Biochemistry 25:8343-8347, disclose that a polypeptide in which 766 amino acids (797 through<br>
1562) have been deleted from the central B domain region also retains FVIII activity. These Bdomain-<br>
deleted FVIII derivatives retained a site for intracellular proteolytic processing within<br>
the B domain after residue Arg-1648, which results in generation of heterogenous FVIII<br>
derivatives comprising single chain or a complex of two proteolytic cleavage products of FVIII,<br>
a 90 kDa (domains A1-A2) and an 80 kDa (domains A3-C1-C2) polypeptide. Moreover,<br>
mammalian cells transformed with a vector containing DNA encoding this deletion polypeptide<br>
had a higher production level than cells transformed with a vector containing DNA encoding the<br>
full length polypeptide. However, these B-domain deleted FVIII derivatives exhibit faster and<br>
higher activation rates by thrombin than full-length FVIII by unknown mechanisms (Eaton et al.,<br>
1986, Biochemistry 25:8343-8347; Fay et al., 1986, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 871:268-278).<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,112,950 describes a FVIII derivative in which a human FVIII derivative<br>
consisting essentially of the amino acid sequence alanine-1 through aspartate-770 is linked to<br>
threonine-1667 through tyrosine-2332, wherein aspartate-770 is covalently bonded by a peptide<br>
bond to threonine-1667. A number of studies indicate that tyrosine residues at positions 346,<br>
718, 719, 723, 1664, and 1680 are required for full activation and procoagulant activity of FVIII<br>
(Donath M.J. et al., 1995, Biochem. J. 312: 49-55; Michnick D.A. et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
269:20095-200102). FVIII circulating in the plasma is combined with vWF, which appears to<br>
stabilize it; in effect, the half-life of FVIII in vivo decreases very rapidly in the absence of vWF<br>
(Brinkhous, K. M. et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA 82: 8752-8756). These studies<br>
strongly suggest that B-domain deleted Factor VIII analogs (described in U. S. Patent No.<br>
5,112,950, in particular), with structural alterations around 1664-1680 in the A3 region, may<br>
have potential drawbacks in terms of full activation and in vivo stability due to interference with<br>
vWF interaction. As described in U. S. Patent No. 5,610,278, the co-expression of heavy and<br>
light chains in mammalian cells results in detectable production of FVIII. However, the<br>
combination of the two chains is inefficient, thereby decreasing the activity of the molecule<br>
(Burke, R. L. et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12574; Pavirani A. et al., 1987, Biochem Biophys<br>
Res Commun. 145:234). The strategy of coexpression of heavy and light chains as a gene<br>
therapy approach in animals or humans is found to be inappropriate (Burton M et al., 1999, Proc<br>
Natl Acad Sci USA 96:12725).<br>
U. S. Patent Nos. 5,422,260 and 5,451,521 relate to variants of FVIII, wherein one or more of<br>
the Factor Xa, APC and thrombin cleavage sites are modified to render such sites less labile to<br>
specific proteolysis, for example, wherein one or both of the amino acids defining the cleavage<br>
site, preferably at least the arginine residues at R-740 or R-1648, is replaced by a different amino<br>
acid; and wherein the protein with deletion of amino acids from S-741 through R-1648 (fusing<br>
R-740 of the 90 IcD site to E-1649 of the 80 kD site) is described but its coagulation activity was<br>
not revealed. The potential disadvantage of this modification at cleavage sites with a different<br>
amino acid is that the resultant protein would have a new epitope to potentially provoke an<br>
immunologic response. In addition, the references do not provide specified variants with internal<br>
deletion of amino acids between R-740 and R-1689 except for the one having internal deletion of<br>
amino acids from S-741 through R-1648.<br>
Recent studies (Chiang GG et al., 1999, Human Gene Therapy 10: 61-76) show that the Bdomain<br>
deleted FVIII that is generated by deletion of amino acids from S-743 through R-1648<br>
(fusing F-742 of N-terminal of B domain to E-1649 of the 80 kD site) which is similar to the one<br>
described in U. S. Patent Nos. 5,422,260 and 5,451,521 exhibited only -50% biological activity<br>
and less specific activity and was therefore considered less suitable for therapeutic application.<br>
The reason why such a B-domain deleted FVIII possesses less biological and specific activity<br>
remains unknown. However, it is assumed that the nature of single chain FVIII with a deletion<br>
of amino acids from S-743 through R-1648 may have a different tertiary structural configuration<br>
probably due to the absence of spatial requirements between heavy chain (A1-A2) and light<br>
chain (A3-C1-C2) or to undesirable length or composition between heavy chain (A1-A2) and<br>
light chain (A3-C1-C2).<br>
In summary, these previous strategies, although offering potential for more efficient<br>
manufacturing of recombinant protein, have not been successful. This lack of success is possibly<br>
due to their molecular characteristics such as heterogenous population of FVIII molecules,<br>
structural instability, and different thrombin activation profiles compared with that of full-length<br>
human FVIII (rh FVIII), dB761, dB782, dB761,-739F, and dB782-739F. FIGURE 7B shows thrombin activation kinetics for recombinant human FVIII (rh FVIII), dBN(57-50), dBN(45-53), dBN(57-56), dBN(64-50), dBN(64-53), and dBN(64-56).<br>

expressed in HEK293 cells.<br>
FIGURE 5A - stable transfected HEK293 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for<br>
30 min. Duplicate labeled cells were chased for 6 hr in medium containing excess unlabeled<br>
methionine, and then cell extracts (C) and conditioned medium (M) were harvested. Equal<br>
volumes of cell extract and conditioned medium were immunoprecipated with anti-FVIIIspecific<br>
antibody, and equal aliquots were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. All of the derivatives were<br>
recovered from cell extracts (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17) and the chase-conditioned<br>
medium (lanes 4,6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18) as single-chain species. HEK293 indicates<br>
HEK293 cells that did not possess exogenous DNA plasmid DNA.<br>
FIGURE 5B - HEK293 cell lines expressing FVIII derivatives were grown in DMEM<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. When monolayer grew to around 70-<br>
80% confluence, culture media was replaced with fresh DMEM. Cells were incubated for about<br>
24 hrs and culture supernatant was harvested, concentrated approximately 100-fold using<br>
Centricon 50,000 MWCO, and stored at -80°C. FVIII concentration was measured using ELISA<br>
method. Concentrates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting<br>
using a monoclonal antibody (ESH-8). ESH-8 antibody used in Western blotting detected a<br>
major protein, migrating to approximately 170 kDa (indicated by arrow).<br>
FIGURE 5C - 35S-methionine labeled FVIII derivatives were immunoprecipitated from the chase<br>
conditioned medium of stably expressing HEK293 cells, and were divided into equal aliquots<br>

STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a Factor VIII polypeptide comprising an internal deletion of amino acids from residue 741 to residue 1688, with reference to full-length human Factor VIII amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.l.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the present application, "a" and "an" are used to refer to both single and a plurality of objects. As used herein, "about" or "substantially" generally provides leeway from being limited to an exact number. For example, as used in the context of the length or position of a polypeptide sequence, 'about" or "substantially" indicates that the polypeptide is not to be limited to the exact recited number or position as that which is indicated, so long as the function and result achieved is the same. A few amino acid positions may be inserted, deleted, or added or deleted from the "N- or C- terminal ends so long as the functional activity ascribed to such amino acid positions, such as thrombin cleavage and protease cleavage functions are either maintained or inactivated through deletion or mutation of the various amino acids pertaining to site of function. Furthermore, as used herein, "substantially similar" sequence of nucleic acid or amino acid sequence refers to one having 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence homology to the indicated reference sequence.<br>
As used herein, "amino acid" and "amino acids" refer to all naturally occurring L-α-amino acids. This definition is meant to include norleucine, ornithine, and homocysteine. As used herein, in general, the term "amino acid sequence variant" refers to molecules with some differences in their amino acid sequences as compared to a reference (e.g. native Factor VIII sequence) polypeptide. The amino acid alterations may be substitutions, insertions, deletions or any desired combinations of such changes in a native amino acid sequence. Substitutional variants are those that have at least one amino acid residue in a native sequence removed and a different amino acid inserted in its place at the same position. The substitutions may be single, where only one amino acid in the molecule has been substituted, or they may be multiple, where two or more amino acids have been substituted in the same molecule. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine.<br><br>
The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine<br>
and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine.<br>
The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Also<br>
included within the scope of the invention are proteins or fragments or derivatives thereof which<br>
exhibit the same or similar biological activity and derivatives which are differentially modified<br>
during or after translation, e.g., by glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to an antibody<br>
molecule or other cellular ligand, and so on.<br>
Insertional variants are those with one or more amino acids inserted immediately adjacent to an<br>
amino acid at a particular position in a native amino acid sequence. Immediately adjacent to an<br>
amino acid means connected to either the a-carboxy or a-amino functional group of the amino<br>
acid.<br>
Deletional variants are those with one or more amino acids in the native amino acid sequence<br>
removed. Ordinarily, deletional variants will have one or two amino acids deleted in a particular<br>
region of the molecule.<br>
In one aspect, the polypeptide variant of the present invention may contain any number of amino<br>
acids or alterations of amino acids in the FVIII non-critical region, including substitutions and/or<br>
insertions and/or deletions in any other region of the polypeptide molecule, so long as the<br>
polypeptide variant includes a sequence that is at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%,<br>
96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to about 1-740 and/or 1689-2332 polypeptide sequence of SEQ<br>
ID NO:1, and the presence of the variations do not hinder the variant FVIII activity.<br>
The amino acid symbols used in the present application include the following:<br>
Either single or three letter abbreviations for the amino acids are used throughout the application,<br>
and may be used interchangeably, and have the following meaning: A or Ala = alanine; R or Arg<br>
= arginine; N or Asn = asparagine; D or Asp = aspartic acid; C or Cys = cysteine; Q Gin =<br>
glutamine; E or Glu = glutamic acid; G or Gly = glycine; H or His = histidine; I or lie =<br>
isoleucine; L or Leu = leucine; K or Lys - lysine; M or Met = methionine; F or Phe =<br>
phenylalanine; P or Pro = proline; S or Ser = serine; T or Thr = threonine; W or Trp =<br>
tryptophan; Y or Tyr = tyrosine; and V or Val = valine.<br>
As used herein, "Factor VIII derivative", "Factor VIII variant", or "Factor VIII polypeptide"<br>
refers to a polypeptide that has coagulation activity, higher specific activity and similar thrombin<br>
activation profile compared with full-length human Factor VIII, and has at least about 70%, 75%,<br>
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity to the 1-740 and 1689-2332<br>
regions of the polypeptide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1. In particular, it is understood<br>
that various mutations and conservative amino acid changes are tolerable, as well as certain nonconservative<br>
amino acid changes, so long as the variant Factor VIII has coagulation activity.<br>
Fragments and certain glycosylations are also permitted, and preferred, indeed any change at all<br>
to the Factor VIII polypeptide is permitted so long as the polypeptide retains its specific activity.<br>
Applicants for the first time discovered that Factor VIII derivatives, which has either deleted or<br>
varied B region in which the thrombin cleavage regions at 740 and 1689 are kept in tact, but<br>
much of the area between 740 and 1689 may be deleted, including 1648, without causing any<br>
negative effect on the specific activity of the variant Factor VIII. Thus, it would be within the<br>
purview of a person of skill in the art to make certain variations to the sequence, which retains<br>
the specific activity of Factor VIII.<br>
As used herein, the term "capable of hybridizing under high stringency conditions" means<br>
annealing a strand of DMA complementary to the DNA of interest under highly stringent<br>
conditions. Likewise, "capable of hybridizing under low stringency conditions" refers to<br>
annealing a strand of DNA complementary to the DNA of interest under low stringency<br>
conditions. "High stringency conditions" for the annealing process may involve, for example,<br>
high temperature and/or low salt content, which disfavor hydrogen-bonding contacts among<br>
mismatched base pairs. "Low stringency conditions" would involve lower temperature, and/or<br>
higher salt concentration than that of high stringency conditions. Such conditions allow for two<br>
DNA strands to anneal if substantial, though not near complete complementarity exists between<br>
the two strands, as is the case among DNA strands that code for the same protein but differ in<br>
sequence due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Appropriate stringency conditions which<br>
promote DNA hybridization, for example, 6x SSC at about 45°C, followed by a wash of 2x SSC<br>
at 50°C are known to those skilled in the art or can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular<br>
Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.31-6.3.6. For example, the salt concentration in the<br>
wash step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2x SSC at 50°C to a high stringency of<br>
about 0.2x SSC at 50°C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low<br>
stringency at room temperature, about 22°C, to high stringency conditions, at about 75"C. Other<br>
stringency parameters are described in Maniatis, T., et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory<br>
Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring N,Y., (1982), at pp. 387-389; see<br>
also Sambrook J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Volume 2,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring, N.Y. at pp. 8.46-8.47 (1989).<br>
As used herein, "carriers" include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers<br>
which are nontoxic to the cell or mammal being exposed thereto at the dosages and<br>
concentrations employed. Often the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH<br>
buffered solution. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include without limitation<br>
buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid;<br>
low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin,<br>
gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids<br>
such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and<br>
other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA;<br>
sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or<br>
nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN®, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS®.<br>
As used herein, "covalent derivatives" include modifications of the polypeptide or a fragment<br>
thereof with an organic proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous derivatizing agent, and posttranslational<br>
modifications. Covalent modifications are traditionally introduced by reacting<br>
targeted amino acid residues with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with<br>
selected sides or terminal residues, or by harnessing mechanisms of post-translational<br>
modifications that function in selected recombinant host cells. Certain post-translational<br>
modifications are the result of the action of recombinant host cells on the expressed polypeptide.<br>
Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently post-translationally deamidated to the<br>
corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues. Alternatively, these residues are deamidated under<br>
mildly acidic conditions. Either form of these residues may be present in the Factor VIII<br>
polypeptides of the present invention. Other post-translational modifications include<br>
glycosylation, hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl,<br>
tyrosine or threonyl residues, methylation of the a-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and<br>
histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W. H.<br>
Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)).<br>
As used herein, "effective amount" is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired clinical<br>
or biochemical results. An effective amount can be administered one or more times. For<br>
purposes of this invention, an effective amount of an inhibitor compound is an amount that is<br>
sufficient to palliate, ameliorate, stabilize, reverse, slow or delay the progression of the disease<br>
state. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the "effective amount" is defined as an amount<br>
of compound capable of effecting coagulation of blood.<br>
As used herein, "fragment" refers to a part of a polypeptide, which retains usable and functional<br>
characteristics. For example, as used within the context of the present invention, the Factor <br>
polypeptide fragment has the function of coagulating blood.<br>
As used herein, "host cell" includes an individual cell or cell culture, which can be or has been a<br>
recipient of a vector of this invention. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the<br>
progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in total DNA<br>
complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or<br>
change. A host cell includes cells transfected or infected in vivo with a vector comprising a<br>
polynucleotide encoding an angiogenic factor.<br>
As used herein, "mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal,<br>
including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, cats,<br>
cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and so on. Preferably, the mammal is human.<br>
As used herein, "purified" or "isolated" molecule refers to biological molecules that are removed<br>
from their natural environment and are isolated or separated and are free from other components<br>
with which they are naturally associated.<br>
As used herein, "sample" or "biological sample" is referred to in its broadest sense, and includes<br>
any biological sample obtained from an individual, body fluid, cell line, tissue culture, or other<br>
source, In addition, a "biological sample" obtained from a patient can be referred to either as a<br>
"biological sample" or a "patient sample."<br>
As used herein, "sequence identity", is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a<br>
candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in a native polypeptide<br>
sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the<br>
maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part<br>
of the sequence identity. The % sequence identity values are generated by the NCBI BLAST2.0<br>
software as defined by Altschul et al., (1997), "Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new<br>
generation of protein database search programs", Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402. The<br>
parameters are set to default values, with the exception of the Penalty for mismatch, which is set<br>
to-1.<br>
As used herein, the term "specific activity" or "specific biological activity" of FVIII polypeptide<br>
refers to the quantitative measurement of functional FVIII molecules with coagulation activity<br>
present in total FVIII molecules which is represented by the ratio of FVIII coagulation activity to<br>
the amount of FVIII antigen associated with Factor VIII polypeptides. Specific activity or<br>
specific biological activity is affected by multiple factors such as the potency of coagulation<br>
activity, thrombin activation profile, structural stability, and structural conformation, compared<br>
with full-length human Factor VIII.<br>
As used herein, "subject" is a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human.<br>
As used herein, "treatment" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For<br>
purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to,<br>
alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state<br>
of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state,<br>
and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Treatment" can<br>
also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.<br>
"Treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures.<br>
Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the<br>
disorder is to be prevented. "Palliating" a disease means that the extent and/or undesirable<br>
clinical manifestations of a disease state are lessened and/or the time course of the progression is<br>
slowed or lengthened, as compared to a situation without treatment.<br>
As used herein, "vector", "polynucleotide vector", "construct" and "polynucleotide construct" are<br>
used interchangeably herein. A polynucleotide vector of this invention may be in any of several<br>
forms, including, but not limited to, RNA, DNA, RNA encapsulated in a retroviral coat, DNA<br>
encapsulated in an adenovirus coat, DNA packaged in another viral or viral-like form (such as<br>
herpes simplex, and adeno-associated virus (AAV)), DNA encapsulated in liposomes, DNA<br>
complexed with polylysine, complexed with synthetic polycationic molecules, complexed with<br>
compounds such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) to immunologically "mask" the molecule and/or<br>
increase half-life, or conjugated to a non-viral protein. Preferably, the polynucleotide is DNA.<br>
As used herein, "DNA" includes not only bases A, T, C, and G, but also includes any of their<br>
analogs or modified forms of these bases, such as methylated nucleotides, internucleotide<br>
modifications such as uncharged linkages and thioates, use of sugar analogs, and modified<br>
and/or alternative backbone structures, such as polyamides.<br>
Factor VIII Polypeptides<br>
Novel DNA constructs and novel compositions comprising host cells producing polypeptides<br>
having FVIII activity are provided. The polypeptides having FVIII activity include deletion<br>
mutant proteins of FVIII in which a substantial part of the central region or "B domain" is<br>
deleted. Plasmid constructs comprised of DNA sequences encoding deletion polypeptides<br>
having FVIII activity are used to transform a host cell. The transformed host cell is then grown<br>
to express the gene. The host cell may be either an eukaryotic or a prokaryotic cell. Human<br>
FVIII has the sequence shown in Figures 1A and IB (SEQ ID NO:1). The numbering of the<br>
amino acid sequence starts with A-1, the first amino acid after the 19 amino acid signal sequence.<br>
The last amino acid of FVIII is Y-2332. This numbering scheme is used throughout the<br>
specification.<br>
The polypeptides of this invention include FVIII derivatives, namely compounds having at least<br>
one amino acid sequence with sequence similarity to the amino acid sequence of the natural form<br>
of human FVIII. The derivatives usually have a smaller number of amino acids than the natural<br>
form of human FVIII.<br>
With the greater understanding of the structural requirements for FVIII cleavage and activation,<br>
we have designed a functional B domain deletion FVIII that is expressed and secreted as a single<br>
chain polypeptide so as to increase the recovery yield during pharmaceutical preparation. We<br>
tested the hypothesis that fusion of the N-terminal of the B domain with the amino acid<br>
sequences (from Glu-1649 to Pro-1688) of the A3-C1-C2 light chain would yield a single<br>
polypeptide FVIII molecule. As described in this invention, some FVIII derivatives possess<br>
typical thrombin activation profiles indistinguishable from wild-type FVIII and superior<br>
structural stability to wild-type FVIII as well as other B-domain deleted FVIII derivatives.<br>
Moreover, most of the derivatives have the added advantage of being expressed more efficiently<br>
in mammalian cells. This invention showed that a molecule devoid of most of domain B and<br>
part of domain A3, but still retains the maturation sites corresponding to amino acids 740 and<br>
1689 (which appear to be necessary for the activation), exhibits normal procoagulant activity.<br>
This molecule can be activated by thrombin in the same manner as the natural human FVIII.<br>
Novel polypeptides of interest will, for the most part, have a formula comprising an N-terminal<br>
heavy chain region, a linking spacer region, and a C-terminal light chain region. Schematic<br>
representation of B-domain deleted FVIII derivatives are presented in Figure 2. The N-terminal<br>
heavy chain region is characterized as having an amino acid sequence corresponding to a<br>
consecutive sequence found in amino acid sequence A-l through R-740 of the full-length human<br>
FVIII.<br>
The linking spacer polypeptides consist of a short linking group of amino acid sequences<br>
corresponding substantially to domains B and A3-domain sequences (from S-741 to P-1688)<br>
with an internal deletion of amino acids 746 to 1649, 746 to 1652, 746 to 1655, 758 to 1649, 758<br>
to 1652, 758 to 1655, 765 to 1649, 765 to 1652, 765 to 1655, 748 to 1658, 755 to 1658, 762 to<br>
1658, 769 to 1658, 776 to 1658, or 783 to 1658.<br>
The C-terminal light chain is characterized as having an amino acid sequence similar to a<br>
consecutive sequence of R-1689 through Y-2332 found in the sequence of FVIII. Variants of<br>
this invention, which embody internal deletions relative to the native FVIII molecule, preferably<br>
contain (i) an internal deletion described above; or (ii) deletions of fewer amino acids within the<br>
regions specified in (i). Other variants of this invention embodying internal deletions may<br>
contain deletions of one or more amino acids between R-1649 and P-1688 to fuse any amino<br>
acid sequence in Al, A2, and B domains. Figure 2 shows the exemplary representation of<br>
dB747 and dBN(45-50) FVIII derivatives that have an internal deletion of amino acids 748 to<br>
1658 and 746 to 1649 respectively, as compared to human FVIII.<br>
These B-domain-deleted FVIII derivatives do not retain a site for intracellular proteolytic<br>
processing, such as residue Arg-1648, which results in the generation of homogenous FVIII<br>
derivatives comprising a major population of single chain polypeptides. The removal of the 80<br>
kDa cleavage site (R-1648) did not decrease the activity of factor VIII generated in the<br>
conditioned media. In addition, some derivatives of this invention here showed no significant<br>
change in the thrombin activation fold. The present results here demonstrated that the removal<br>
of R-1648 did not affect the synthesis or secretion of the FVIII derivatives from the cell. In<br>
addition, the predominant FVIII species produced was a single chain molecule of approximately<br>
170kDa, the result of the loss of the intracellular processing site at the 80 kD site. The singlechain<br>
FVIII variants may be advantageous in that they may be produced in a more homogeneous<br>
form and may have an improved pharmacokinetic profile relative to natural human or other<br>
recombinant FVIII.<br>
In full-length FVIII, thrombin cleavage after Arg residues 372, 740, and 1689 activates FVIII<br>
coagulant activity. This coincides with the generation of a FVIIIa heterotrimer consisting of the<br>
Al subunit in a divalent-metal-ion-dependent association with the thromb in-cleaved A3-C1-C2<br>
light chain and a free A2 subunit associated with the Al domain through an ionic interaction. In<br>
full-length FVIII, cleavage after Arg-1689 removes an acidic amino acid rich region from R-<br>
1648 to R-1689, and is necessary for dissociation of FVIIIa from vWF and makes FVIIIa<br>
available for interaction with phospholipids. Analysis of the radiolabeled FVIII derivative<br>
proteins of this invention after thrombin digestion indicated a normal appearance of the 73 kD,<br>
and 50 and 40 kD fragments (See Figure 5C). This result demonstrated that the disclosed FVIII<br>
derivatives can be activated by thrombin in the same manner as the complete natural molecule.<br>
As demonstrated in this invention, these FVIII derivatives exhibit typical thrombin activation<br>
that correlates with cleavage after Arg-372, Arg-740, and Arg-1689, generating an activated<br>
FVIII heterotrimer that is indistinguishable from wild-type FVIII and also is subject to rapid<br>
inactivation through dissociation of the A2 domain subunit (See Figure 7).<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to variants wherein an artificial N-linked glycosylation site is<br>
generated by fusing Asn amino acid in the B domain to an X-threonine or X-serine amino acid<br>
sequence in the A3 domain in concurrence with the deletion of the internal sequence as<br>
described above. Alternatively, a tripeptide sequence of the N-glycosylation recognition<br>
sequence (Asn-X-Ser/Thr where X can be any amino acid) in the fusion sites can be generated<br>
by linking the amino acids of 746, 758, and 765 located next to the Asn amino acid in the<br>
positions of 745, 757 and 764, respectively, directly to Ser or Thr amino acids in the positions of<br>
1651,1654, and 1657. These FVIII variants will have an internal deletion of amino acids 747 to<br>
1650, 747 to 1653, 747 to 1656, 759 to 1650, 759 to 1653, 759 to 1656, 766 to 1650, 766 to 1653,<br>
or 766 to 1656, as compared to human FVIII. Consensus N-linked glycosylation sites contain<br>
tripeptide sequences of the formula asparagine-X-threonine or asparagine-X-serine, where X<br>
may be generally any amino acid. In particular, in one aspect of the invention, X may be any<br>
amino acid except proline. Variants of this aspect of the invention containing an engineered NIinked<br>
glycosylation site at the fusion sites between the B and A3 domains may prevent a<br>
potentially novel epitope sequence at the fusion site from being exposed to the immune system.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to derivatives wherein one or more of the Factor Xa, APC<br>
and thrombin cleavage sites are modified to render such sites less labile to specific proteolysis.<br>
One subgenus of derivatives of particular interest at present includes those containing a<br>
modification at P-739 wherein the phenylalanine is preferred at present, but can be replaced by a<br>
different amino acid or deleted. Synthesis and secretion of the FVIII derivatives with<br>
modification of the amino acid at 739 in the invention was not affected. These variants exhibit<br>
higher activation rate by thrombin than full-length FVIII as well as other FVIII derivatives of<br>
this invention (see Figure 7). The increased activity may be attributable to resistance to<br>
inactivation by Factor Xa cleavage in the chromogenic assay. Thus, this alteration appears to<br>
generate a more stable form of FVIII with the additional benefit of increased activity. However,<br>
it was found that, according to U. S. Patent Nos. 5,422,260 and 5,451,521, a B-domain deleted<br>
FVIII derivative with the mutation of the arginine to an isoleucine at position 740 possessed less<br>
activity after the mutation.<br>
Even though it may be assumed that all polypeptide FVIII molecules which are generated by<br>
fusion of the N-terminal region of the B domain with the amino acid sequences (from Glu-1649<br>
to Pro-1688) of the A3-C1-C2 light chain would yield a similar profile of procoagulant activity,<br>
individual B-domain deleted FVIII derivatives were found to possess unique thrombin activation<br>
profile and structural stability in this invention. Therefore, we characterized in detail the<br>
molecular feature of individual B-domain deleted FVIII derivative in this invention to find an<br>
active safe single chain B-domain deleted FVIII derivative with similar profiles of thrombin<br>
activation and improved productivity.<br>
Nucleic Acid Encoding Factor VIII Polypeptide<br>
By "isolated" polynucleotide sequence, it is intended to encompass a nucleic acid molecule,<br>
DNA or RNA, which has been removed from its native environment. This includes segments of<br>
DNA encoding the FVIEI polypeptide of the present invention, and may further comprise<br>
heterologous sequences such as vector sequences or other foreign DNA. For example,<br>
recombinant DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of<br>
the present invention, which may be partially or substantially purified.<br>
In addition, isolated nucleic acid molecules of the invention include DNA molecules, which<br>
comprise a sequence substantially different from those described above but which, either due to<br>
the degeneracy of the genetic code or other variability, still encode the FVIII polypeptide of the<br>
invention. Thus, it would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate the variants described<br>
above, for instance, to optimize codon expression or general function for a particular host.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a<br>
polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of a<br>
polynucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule of the invention described above. Hybridizing<br>
polynucleotides are useful as probes and primers as discussed above. Portions of a<br>
polynucleotide which hybridize to the FVIII polypeptide encoding sequence, which may be<br>
precisely specified by 5' and 3' base positions or by size in nucleotide bases as described above<br>
or precisely excluded in the same manner. Similarly, portions of a polynucleotide, which<br>
hybridize to the FVIII polypeptide, which may be used as probes and primers as well. Preferred<br>
hybridizing polynucleotides of the present invention are those that, when labeled and used in a<br>
hybridization assay known in the art (e.g. Southern and Northern blot analysis), display the<br>
greatest signal strength regardless of other heterologous sequences present in equimolar amounts.<br>
In selecting a preferred host cell for transfection by the vectors of the invention, which comprise<br>
DNA sequences encoding both FVIII derivatives and for example, dihydrofolate reductase<br>
(DHFR) protein, it is appropriate to select the host according to the type of DHFR protein<br>
employed. If wild type DHFR protein is employed, it is preferable to select a host cell which is<br>
deficient in DHFR, thus permitting the use of the DHFR coding sequence as a marker for<br>
successful transfection in selective medium which lacks hypoxanthine, glycine, and thymidine.<br>
On the other hand, if DHFR protein with low binding affinity for methotrexate (MTX) is used as<br>
the regulatory sequence, it is not necessary to use DHFR resistant cells. Mutant DHFR is<br>
resistant to MTX, therefore, MTX containing media can be used as a means of selection<br>
provided that the host cells themselves are MTX sensitive. Alternatively, a wild type DHFR<br>
gene may be employed as an amplification marker in a host cell which is not deficient in DHFR<br>
provided that a second drug selectable marker is employed, such as hygromycin resistance.<br>
Examples which are set forth describe the use of CHO cells (CHO-DBX11 cells) resistant to<br>
MIX as host cells and expression vectors which employ the CMV and SV40 promoter as<br>
regulatory sequences to drive the expression of FVIII derivatives and DHFR, respectively.<br>
Variant and Mutant Polynucleotides<br>
Such nucleic acid variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions, deletions, or<br>
additions. The substitutions, deletions, or additions may involve one or more nucleotides.<br>
Alterations in the amino acid sequence may produce conservative or non-conservative amino<br>
acid substitutions, deletions or additions. Especially preferred among these are silent<br>
substitutions, additions and deletions, which do not alter the properties and activities of the<br>
polypeptides of the present invention or portions thereof. Also preferred in this regard are<br>
conservative substitutions.<br>
The invention allows for the use of sequences in expression vectors, as well as to transfect host<br>
cells and cell lines, be these prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. The invention also allows for<br>
purification of the polypeptides expressed from the expression vector. The expression vector<br>
may contain various molecular tags for easy purification. Subsequently obtained expression<br>
construct may be transformed into any host cell of choice. Cell lysates from the host cell is<br>
isolated by established methods well known in the field.<br>
Variant and Mutant Polypeptides<br>
To improve or alter the characteristics of FVIII polypeptide of the present invention, amino acid<br>
engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art<br>
can be used to create novel mutant polypeptides including single or multiple amino acid<br>
substitutions, deletions, additions, or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show, e.g.,<br>
increased/decreased activity or increased/decreased stability. In addition, they may be purified in<br>
higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide, at least<br>
under certain purification and storage conditions.<br>
Antibodies<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to detecting presence of FVIII polypeptide<br>
using a variety of detection methods. One way to detect Factor VIII polypeptide is to label a<br>
ligand that specifically binds to the FVIII polypeptide. Such a ligand may be an antibody.<br>
Purified FVIII polypeptide may be used to produce monoclonal or polyclonal antibody.<br>
Fragments of Factor VIII polypeptide also can be used to produce monoclonal or polyclonal<br>
antibody. Subsequently obtained monoclonal or polyclonal antibody can be used to determine<br>
the presence of FVIII polypeptide in various samples including cells, tissues, and body fluids<br>
such as but not limited to blood, serum, plasma, and urine. FVIII polypeptide may be assayed<br>
using a variety of molecular biological methods, which include but are not limited to in situ<br>
hybridization, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot analysis and so<br>
on. One can carry out ELISA by using monoclonal antibody against FVIII polypeptide to<br>
determine the amount of FVIII polypeptide in the biological sample, including body fluids of<br>
human subjects believed to be suffering from a blood clotting disorder, such as hemophilia.<br>
Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific,<br>
human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab')<br>
fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies<br>
(including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments<br>
of any of the above. The term "antibody," as used herein, refers to immunoglobulin molecules<br>
and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain<br>
an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin<br>
molecules of the invention can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g.,<br>
IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or of greater<br>
multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide<br>
of the present invention or may be specific for both a polypeptide of the present invention as<br>
well as for a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material.<br>
Antibodies of the present invention may be described or specified in terms of the epitope(s) or<br>
portion(s) of a polypeptide of the present invention, which they recognize or specifically bind.<br>
The epitope(s) or polypeptide portion(s) may be specified as described herein, e.g., by the<br>
glycosylation site, N-terminal and C-terminal positions, or by size in contiguous amino acid<br>
residues.<br>
Antibodies of the present invention may be used, for example, but not limited to, to purify, detect,<br>
and target the polypeptides of the present invention, including both in vitro and in vivo<br>
diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example, the antibodies have use in immunoassays for<br>
qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of FVIII polypeptide of the present invention in<br>
biological samples.<br>
As discussed in more detail below, the antibodies of the present invention may be used either<br>
alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly<br>
fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including<br>
covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example,<br>
antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules<br>
useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides,<br>
drugs, radionuclides, or toxins.<br>
The antibodies of the present invention may be generated by any suitable method known in the<br>
art. Polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest can be produced by various procedures well<br>
known in the art. For example, a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host<br>
animals including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, etc. to induce the production of sera<br>
containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to<br>
increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include but are not<br>
limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide,<br>
surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil<br>
emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants<br>
such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and corynebacterium parvum. Such adjuvants are also<br>
well known in the art.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art<br>
including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination<br>
thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques<br>
including those known in the art. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein is not limited<br>
to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term "monoclonal antibody" refers<br>
to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or<br>
phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced.<br>
Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are<br>
routine and well known in the art. In a non-limiting example, mice can be immunized with a<br>
Factor VIII polypeptide or a cell expressing such entity. Once an immune response is detected,<br>
e.g., antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum, the mouse spleen is<br>
harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to<br>
any suitable myeloma cells, for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC.<br>
Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed<br>
by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of<br>
the invention or its complex with its binding partner. Ascites fluid, which generally contains high<br>
levels of antibodies, can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.<br>
Antibodies may also be attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for<br>
immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not<br>
limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or<br>
polypropylene.<br>
Assays For Antibody Binding<br>
The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method<br>
known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to<br>
competitive and non-competitive assay systems using techniques such as Western blots,<br>
radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), "sandwich" immunoassays,<br>
immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions,<br>
immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric<br>
assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, to name but a few. Such assays are<br>
routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols hi<br>
Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety). Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are<br>
not intended by way of limitation.<br>
Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer<br>
such as RIPA buffer (1% NP-40 or Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M<br>
NaCl, 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2,1% Trasylol) supplemented with protein phosphatase<br>
and/or protease inhibitors (e.g., EDTA, PMSF, aprotinin, sodium vanadate), adding the antibody<br>
of interest to the cell lysate, incubating for a period of time (e.g., 1-4 hours) at 4°C, adding<br>
protein A and/or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate, incubating for about an hour or<br>
more at 4°C, washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS/sample buffer.<br>
The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed<br>
by, e.g., Western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the<br>
parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the antibody to an antigen and<br>
decrease the background (e.g., pre-clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads). For further<br>
discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current<br>
Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 10.16.1.<br>
Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples, electrophoresis of the<br>
protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel (e.g., 8%-20% SDS-PAGE depending on the molecular<br>
weight of the antigen), transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a<br>
membrane such as nitrocellulose, PVDF or nylon, blocking the membrane in blocking solution<br>
(e.g., PBS with 3% BSA or non-fat milk), washing the membrane in washing buffer (e.g., PBSTween<br>
20), blocking the membrane with primary antibody (the antibody of interest) diluted in<br>
blocking buffer, washing the membrane in washing buffer, blocking the membrane with a<br>
secondary antibody (which recognizes the primary antibody, e.g., an anti-human antibody)<br>
conjugated to an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) or<br>
radioactive molecule (e.g., 32P or 125I) diluted in blocking buffer, washing the membrane in wash<br>
buffer, and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable<br>
as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the<br>
background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al,<br>
eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York<br>
at 10.8.1.<br>
ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, which may include a sample comprising Factor VIII<br>
polypeptide, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody<br>
of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish<br>
peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting<br>
the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to<br>
a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest)<br>
conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the<br>
well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody<br>
conjugated to a detectable compound may be added simultaneously or following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the<br>
parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of<br>
ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds,<br>
1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at<br>

Gene Therapy<br>
In a specific embodiment, nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding the Factor VIII<br>
polypeptide are administered to treat, inhibit or prevent a disease or disorder associated with<br>
aberrant expression and/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention, by way of gene therapy.<br>
Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or<br>
expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their<br>
encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.<br>
Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present<br>
invention. Exemplary methods are described below.<br>
For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et al., Clinical Pharmacy<br>
12:488-505 (1993); Wu and Wu, Biotherapy 3:87-95 (1991); Tolstoshev, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol.<br>
Toxicol. 32:573-596 (1993); Mulligan, Science 260:926-932 (1993); and Morgan and Anderson,<br>
Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217 (1993); May, TIBTECH 11(5):155-215 (1993). Methods<br>
commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in<br>
Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY (1993);<br>
and Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual, Stockton Press, NY (1990).<br>
In a preferred aspect, nucleic acid sequences may encode a Factor VIII polypeptide, in which the<br>
nucleic acid sequences are part of expression vectors that express the polypeptides in a suitable<br>
host. In particular, such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the<br>
polypeptide coding region, said promoter being inducible or constitutive, and, optionally, tissuespecific.<br>
In another particular embodiment, nucleic acid molecules are used in which the<br>
polypeptide coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that<br>
promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome, thus providing for<br>
intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids (Roller and Smithies, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); Zijlstra et al.} Nature 342:435-438 (1989).<br>
Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct, in which case the patient is<br>
directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid- carrying vectors, or indirect, in which case,<br>
cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro, then transplanted into the patient. These<br>
two approaches are known, respectively, as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo, where it<br>
is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous<br>
methods known in the art, e.g., by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid<br>
expression vector and administering them so that they become intracellular, e.g., by infection<br>
using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors, or by direct injection of naked<br>
DNA, or coating with lipids or cell-surface receptors or transfecting agents, encapsulation in<br>
liposomes, microparticles, or microcapsules, or by administering them in linkage to a peptide<br>
which is known to enter the nucleus, by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to<br>
receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987))<br>
(which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors) and so on. In<br>
another embodiment, nucleic acid-ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand<br>
comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes, allowing the nucleic acid to avoid<br>
lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for<br>
cell specific uptake and expression, by targeting a specific receptor. Alternatively, the nucleic<br>
acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression, by<br>
homologous recombination (Roller and Smithies, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935<br>
(1989); Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989)).<br>
In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding the<br>
polypeptide are used. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the polypeptide to be used in gene<br>
therapy are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient.<br>
Retroviral vectors, adenoviral vectors and adeno-associated viruses are examples of viral vectors<br>
that may be used. Retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging<br>
of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA.<br>
Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such<br>
methods as electroporation, lipofection, calcium phosphate mediated transfection, or viral<br>
infection. Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells.<br>
The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are<br>
expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.<br>
In this embodiment, the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the<br>
resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art,<br>
including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or<br>
bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated<br>
gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, spheroplast fusion and so on. Numerous<br>
techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells and may be used<br>
in accordance with the present invention, provided that the necessary developmental and<br>
physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for<br>
the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell, so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.<br>
Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any<br>
desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells,<br>
keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T-lymphocytes, Blymphocytes,<br>
monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes;<br>
various stern or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as<br>
obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, and so on.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient.<br>
In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy, nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding the polypeptide are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells<br>
or their progeny, and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect.<br>
In a specific embodiment, stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and/or progenitor cells<br>
which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy<br>
comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of<br>
the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer<br>
of transcription.<br>
Therapeutic Composition<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to treatment for blood clotting diseases. In this<br>
way, the inventive therapeutic compound may be administered to human patients who are either<br>
suffering from, or prone to suffer from the disease by providing compounds that stimulate blood<br>
coagulation. In particular, the disease may be hemophilia, in particular, hemophilia A.<br>
The formulation of therapeutic compounds is generally known in the art and reference can<br>
conveniently be made to Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Co.,<br>
Easton, Pa., USA. For example, from about 0.05 u.g to about 20 mg per kilogram of body weight<br>
per day may be administered. Dosage regime may be adjusted to provide the optimum<br>
therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose<br>
may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The<br>
active compound may be administered in a convenient manner such as by the oral, intravenous<br>
(where water soluble), intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra nasal, intradermal or suppository<br>
routes or implanting (eg using slow release molecules by the intraperitoneal route or by using<br>
cells e.g. monocytes or dendrite cells sensitised in vitro and adoptively transferred to the<br>
recipient). Depending on the route of administration, the peptide may be required to be coated in<br>
a material to protect it from the action of enzymes, acids and other natural conditions which may<br>
inactivate said ingredients.<br>
For example, the low lipophilicity of the peptides will allow them to be destroyed in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract by enzymes capable of cleaving peptide bonds and in the stomach by acid<br>
hydrolysis. In order to administer peptides by other than parenteral administration, they will be<br>
coated by, or administered with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, peptides may<br>
be administered in an adjuvant, co-administered with enzyme inhibitors or in liposomes.<br>
Adjuvants contemplated herein include resorcinols, non-ionic surfactants such as<br>
polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecyl polyethylene ether. Enzyme inhibitors include<br>
pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DEP) and trasylol. Liposomes include<br>
water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes.<br>
The active compounds may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Dispersions<br>
can also be prepared in glycerol liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils.<br>
Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to<br>
prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where<br>
water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable solutions or dispersion. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the<br>
extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and<br>
storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as<br>
bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,<br>
water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol,<br>
and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained,<br>
for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle<br>
size in the case of dispersion and by the use of superfactants. The prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, theomersal and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable<br>
to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption, of the<br>
injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the composition of agents delaying<br>
absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required<br>
amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated above, as required,<br>
followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the<br>
various sterile active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium<br>
and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders<br>
for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are<br>
vacuum drying and the freeze-drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient<br>
plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
When the peptides are suitably protected as described above, the active compound may be orally<br>
administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may<br>
be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may<br>
be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active<br>
compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal<br>
tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions<br>
and preparations should contain at least 1% by weight of active compound. The percentage of<br>
the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between<br>
about 5 to about 80% of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such<br>
therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred<br>
compositions or preparations according to the present invention are prepared so that an oral<br>
dosage unit form contains between about 0.1 u,g and 2000 mg of active compound.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following: A binder such as gum<br>
tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a<br>
disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such<br>
as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be<br>
added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring. When the<br>
dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid<br>
carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical<br>
form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar<br>
or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent,<br>
methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure<br>
and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be<br>
incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations.<br>
As used herein "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent" includes any and all solvents,<br>
dispersion media, coatings antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying<br>
agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is<br>
well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with<br>
the active ingredient, use thereof in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated.<br>
Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease<br>
of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically<br>
discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit<br>
containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired<br>
therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for<br>
the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique<br>
characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b)<br>
the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of<br>
disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired.<br>
The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in<br>
effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form. A unit<br>
dosage form can, for example, contain the principal active compound in amounts ranging from<br>
0.5 ug to about 2000 mg. Expressed in proportions, the active compound is generally present in<br>
from about 0.5 ug/ml of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active<br>
ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of<br>
administration of the said ingredients.<br>
Delivery Systems<br>
Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention,<br>
e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of<br>
expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis, construction of a nucleic acid as part<br>
of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to<br>
intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and<br>
oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for<br>
example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous<br>
linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together<br>
with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may<br>
be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compounds or compositions of the invention into<br>
the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal<br>
injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example,<br>
attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be<br>
employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.<br>
In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compounds or<br>
compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by,<br>
for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g.,<br>
in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by<br>
means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous,<br>
or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. Preferably,<br>
when administering a protein, including an antibody or a peptide of the invention, care must be<br>
taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb. In another embodiment, the<br>
compound or composition can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the compound or composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In<br>
one embodiment, a pump may be used. In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the<br>
therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.<br>
A composition is said to be "pharmacologically or physiologically acceptable" if its<br>
administration can be tolerated by a recipient animal and is otherwise suitable for administration<br>
to that animal. Such an agent is said to be administered in a "therapeutically effective amount" if<br>
the amount administered is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if<br>
its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient patient.<br>
Mammalian cell culture is the preferred method of expressing exogenous DNA to produce the<br>
functional human FVIII derivatives disclosed in this invention. In particular, common<br>
mammalinan cells used for production of recombinant proteins, such as Chinese hamster ovary<br>
(CHO) cell lines, Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell line, COS cell lines, and Madin Darby canine<br>
kidney (MDCK) cell line are of interest. Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include (if<br>
necessary) (an) origin(s) of replication, a promoter located in front of the gene to be expressed,<br>
along with any necessary ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation site, and<br>
transcriptional terminator sequences.<br>
For use in mammalian cells, the regulatory functions on the expression vectors may be provided<br>
by viral material. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from elongation factor-1<br>
(EF-1), Simian Virus 40 (SV40) and most particularly Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Furthermore, it<br>
is also possible, and often desirable, to utilize promoter or regulatory sequences normally<br>
associated with the desired gene sequence, provided such regulatory sequences are compatible<br>
with the host cell systems.<br>
The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.<br>
Indeed, various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will become<br>
apparent to theose skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying figures.<br>
Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The following<br>
examples are offered by way of illustration of the present invention, and not by way of limitation.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Cloning of full-length FVIH cDNA<br>
Reverse transcription was performed using gene specific primer (FSB 10,<br>
5'AGCACAAAGGTAGAAGGCAAGC3' (SEQ ID NO:2)) which covers nucleotides 7237-<br>
7258 of published sequence (GenBank accession number: NM 00132). Briefly, 50ug of human<br>

of RNAse inhibitor, and 10 units of reverse transcriptase were added in a 9.5 ul total volume<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction was then incubated for 90 min at 42°C. Synthesized cDNA was<br>
amplified by a standard PCR protocol using pfu polymerase and the three sets of gene-specific<br>
primers. The first primer set covers nucleotides 133-1997 of published sequence (GenBank<br>
accession number: NM 00132): F8FD (FW, 5'CCTTTTGCTTCTCCAGTTGAAC3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO:3)) and F8BD (BW, 5' TTCTCTGTGAGGTACCAGCTTC3' (SEQ ID NO:4)). The second<br>
and third set of primers cover nucleotides 1810-4295 and 4044-7320 respectively: F8FC (FW 5'<br>
TGCCTGACCCGCTATTACTCTA3' (SEQ ID NO:5)) and F8BB (BW,<br>
5'TCTATCTGTGTGAGGGTGCTCG3' (SEQ ID NO:6)); F8FA (FW 5'<br>
GGAGGAAGAAAACTTGGAAGGC3' (SEQ ID NO:7)) and F8B10 (see Figure 3). PCR was<br>
performed using the following conditions: 1 cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 1' 30", 45 cycles<br>
of amplification (at 95°C for 30 sec, at 56°C for 30 sec and at 68°C for 6 min) and 1 cycle of<br>
extension at 68°C for 10 min.<br>
As depicted schematically in Figure 3, amplified fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO<br>
vector. Three subcloned fragments were then joined into pCR2.1 TOPO vector using Kpnl and<br>
Nsil as unique restriction sites. After joining the three fragments, the internal Kpnl site in the<br>
FVIII coding region was removed by silent mutation, and the Nsil site in the pCR2.1 TOPO<br>
multicloning site was substituted with Clal in order to remove the linked full-length FVIII cDNA<br>
with Kpnl and Clal digestion. Two restriction enzyme sites, Xbal and NotI, were removed from<br>
the pCR2.1 vector backbone for further cloning purposes. This modified vector was named<br>
pCR2.1 -full-length FVIII.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - Construction of plasmids carrying cDNA of the FVIII derivatives which<br>
have undergone deletions in the regions corresponding to the B and A3 domains<br>
Example 2A - Construction of plasmids for B-domain deleted FVIII derivatives with a<br>
spacer of various size linking the carboxy-terminus of the heavy chain to the amino<br>
terminus of the light chain<br>
The starting plasmid, pCR2.1-fullFVIII, contains cDNA of full-length Factor VIII, nucleotides<br>
133 to 7320. pCR2.1-fullFVIII was digested with EcoNI to delete nucleotides 2783 to 4804<br>
from the full length FVIII. Cohesive ends of EcoNI-digested vector were blunted by DNA<br>
polymerase I Klenow fragment for ligation. This ligated vector was named pCR2.1-<br>
deltaEcoNI_FVIII and used as a template for furthermore, precise, deletion mutagenesis.<br>
Oligonucleotide primers were designed to make a series of precise in-frame deletions. Each<br>
primer matches the sequences flanking both sides of the segments to be deleted. Delta-747,<br>
delta-754, delta-761, delta-768, delta-775 and delta-782 primers generate the fusion sites of<br>
Arg747-Glnl659, Lys754-Glnl659, Ile761-Glnl659, Lys768-Glnl659, His775-Glnl659 and<br>
Ile782-Glnl659, which respectively are:<br>
(delta-747: 5'-CTTCTCCCAGAATTCAAGACAAGAGGAAATTGACTATG-3' (SEQID<br>

In addition to the mutagenic primers described above, a selection primer (5'-<br>
CGTGATCCATGTCGACGCCTGCTTGCC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 14)) which changes the original<br>
unique Ncol site into Sail was used for site-directed mutagenesis with the plasmid pCR2.1-<br>
deltaEcoNI_FVIII as a template. Restriction digestion was carried out to select positive clones,<br>
which were further verified by sequencing. Finally verified clones were named dB747, dB754,<br>
dB761, dB768, dB775, and dB782, respectively.<br>
Example 2B - Generation of plasmids containing a new N-glycan sequence in the fusion<br>
sites<br>
To prevent exposure of a new epitope of unnatural amino acid sequence in the junction region of<br>
the heavy chain and the light chain, we created an N-glycosylation recognition sequence (Asn-XSer/<br>
Thr in which X can be any amino acid) in the fusion sites by linking Asn in the positions of<br>
745, 757 and 764 of the B-domain to amino acids in the positions of 1650, 1653 and 1656<br>
located next to Ser or Thr amino acids in the positions of 1651, 1654, and 1657, which generate<br>
a N-l inked glycosylation site in the fusion sites. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to make<br>
a series of precise in-frame deletions. pCR2.1-deltaEcoNI_FVIII was used as a template for<br>
further precise deletion mutagenesis. Each primer matches the sequences flanking both sides of<br>
the segments to be deleted. N-745-1650, N-745-1653, N-745-1656, N-757-1650, N-757-1653,<br>
N-757-1656, N-764-1650, N-764-1653, and N-764-1656 primers generate the fusion sites of<br>
Asn745-Ilel650, Asn745-Thrl653, Asn745-Glnl656, Asn757-Ilel650, Asn757-Thrl653,<br>
Asn757-Glnl656, Asn764-Ilel650, Asn764-Thrl653, and Asn764-Glnl656. The nucleotide<br>
sequences of the oligonucleotide primers are as follows:<br>

(N-745-1653: 5'-CAAGAAGCTTCTCCCAGAAAACTACTCTTCAGTCAGTC-3' (SEQ ID<br>

(N-745-1656: 5'-CAAGAAGCTTCTCCCAGAAACAGTCAGATCAAGAGGAAATTG-3'<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 17));<br>

In addition to those mutagenic primers described above, a selection primer (5'-<br>
CGTGATCCATGTCGACGCCTGCTTGCC-3' (SEQ ID NO:24)), which changes the original<br>
unique Ncol site into Sail was used for site-directed mutagenesis using the plasmid pCR2.1-<br>
deltaEcoNI_FVIII as a template. Restriction digestion was carried out to select positive clones,<br>
which were further verified by sequencing. Finally verified clones were named as dBN(45-50),<br>
dBN(45-53), dBN(45-56), dBN(57-50), dBN(57-53), dBN(57-56), dBN(64-50), dBN(64-53)5<br>
and dBN(64-56), respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - Expression of the FVIII derivatives in mammalian cells<br>
Example 3A - Construction of mammalian expression vectors<br>
From dB747, dB754, dB761, dB768, dB775, dB782, dB761-739F, dB783-739F, dBN(45-50),<br>
dBN(45-53), dBN(45-56), dBN(57-50), dBN(57-53), dBN(57-56), dBN(64-50), dBN(64-53),<br>
and dBN(64-56) plasmids, the cDNA sequence of Factor VIII derivatives were excised, bluntended,<br>
and cloned between the promoter of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and bovine growth<br>
hormone polyadenylation sequences (bGHpA). In all constructs, orientation of inserts was<br>
verified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing.<br>
Example 3B - Transient transfection of mammalian expression constructs in BHK21 cells<br>
BHK21 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were<br>
maintained in EMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The day before transfection,<br>
cells were plated onto six-well tissue culture dishes at a density such that the cells reached 70-<br>
80% confluence by the time of transfection. Transfections utilized a liposome-based reagent.<br>
Each transfection was performed using 1 ug of FVIII derivative expression construct DNA and<br>
30 ng of an internal control plasmid pSV p-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Four<br>
hours after transfection, the transfection medium was removed by aspiration, 2 ml of complete<br>
medium was added, and the plates were returned to the incubator. At 24 h post-transfection,<br>
medium was removed, spun down, and frozen at -80°C. Cell lysates were prepared and pgalactosidase<br>
activities in cell lysates were measured using the Galacto-Light Plus Kit (Tropix,<br>
MA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The p-galactosidase activity, expressed<br>
from an internal control plasmid pSV P-galactosidase, provided an internal control to monitor<br>
transfection efficiency. FVIII activities were normalized based on the p-galactosidase activity in<br>
each well. An ELISA assay was used to determine the level of FVIII antigen present in medium<br>
samples (in triplicate). The procoagulant activity of the Factor VIII (FVIII:C) was quantified in<br>
culture medium (in triplicate) by using the FVIII Coatest chromogenic assay (Chromogenix,<br>
Molndal, Sweden).<br>
The results are presented in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
t the FVIII derivatives which have undergone deletion are biologically<br>
active in blood coagulation test, and that higher levels of protein is obtained with the FVIII<br>
derivative constructs than with the full-length FVIII. In addition, the ratio of FVIII:C to<br>
FVIII:Ag for the derivatives of this invention is higher than that of full-length FVIII, indicating<br>
that FVIII derivatives may be more stable after secretion into culture media. As shown in Table<br>
3, the increases in FVIII activity (FVIII: C) of recombinant FVIII derivatives over time after<br>
incubation were higher as compared with that of recombinant full-length FVIII.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 - Substitution of Pro with Phe at position 739<br>
Pro739 in the FVIII B-domain deleted variants described above were modified using the sitedirected<br>
mutagenesis method. An oligonucleotide primer (5'-<br>
AACAATGCCATTGAATTCAGAAGCTTCTCCCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO:25)) was designed to<br>
introduce substitution of Pro with Phe at position 739. Whole mutagenesis procedures were<br>
identical with Example 2 described above. The vectors possessing Pro739Phe substitution in<br>
each B-domain deletion FVIII derivative were named as dB747-739F, dB754-739F, dB761-739F,<br>
dB768-739F, dB775-739F, dB782-739F, dBN(45-50)-739F, dBN(45-53)-739F, dBN(45-56)-<br>
739F, dBN(57-50)-739F, dBN(57-53)-739F, dBN(57-56)-739F, dBN(64-50)-739F, dBN(64-53&gt;<br>
739F, and dBN(64-56)-739F, respectively. The resultant DNAs were cloned into the<br>
mammalian expression vector, prepared, transfected, and resultant samples assayed as above. As<br>
showin in Table 4, dB761-739F and dB782-739F were found to generate more activity than<br>
dB761 and dB782, respectively, increased activity after the mutation of the proline to a<br>
phenylalanine at position 739.<br>
Example 5 - Establishment of HEK293 cell lines expressing FVIII derivatives<br>
Example 5A - Construction of plasmids used to generate mammalian cells that stably<br>
express FVIII derivatives.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the mammalian expression plasmid used in this Example was pI2G-Hygro<br>
which contains, in clockwise order, the cytomegalovirus promoter, polylinker, and bovine<br>
growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence followed by a hygromycin resistance<br>
expression cassette driven by the SV40 promoter, and a gene coding ampicillin resistance. The<br>
polylinker of plasmid pI2G-Hygro was opened using Kpnl and Xhol. Into this vector were<br>
ligated approximately 4,5 kb of Kpnl and Xhol fragments containing the coding sequences for<br>
FVIII derivatives which were excised from the plasmids described in Examples 2, 3, and 4.<br>
Each pI2G-Hygro vector which has the coding sequence for individual Factor VIII derivative is<br>
referred to as pI2G-Hygro-"plasmid name for each FVIII derivative cDNA" (See Examples 2, 3,<br>
and 4). For example, the mammalian expression vector containing the coding sequences for<br>
dB747 and dBN(45-50) (in Examples 2 and 3) are referred to as pI2G-Hygro-dB47 and pI2GHygro-<br>
dBN(45-50), respectively.<br>
Example SB - Stable transfection of HEK293 cells<br>
The pI2G-hygro plasmids containing the transcription unit for each FVIII were linearized with<br>
Mfel and precipitated with phenol-chloroform and ethanol in preparation for HEK293 cell<br>
transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected via a liposome based transfection method with<br>
linearized DNA of pI2G-Hygro plasmids including the coding sequences for FVIII derivatives.<br>
Each transfection was performed using 2 u.g of DNA per 10 cm diameter dish. At 48 h posttransfection,<br>
medium was removed, the cells were trypsinized, diluted and cultured in DMEM<br>
selection medium containing hygromycin (500 |J.g/ml) and 10% fetal calf serum. After two<br>
weeks, individual clones, resistant to the selective medium, were isolated and expanded further<br>
in selective medium and then frozen for future studies. The secretion of FVIII derivatives was<br>
monitored by measuring the ability of FVIII derivatives to function as a cofactor for the Factor<br>
IXa-dependent conversion of Factor X into Factor Xa, employing a chromogenic substrate for<br>
Factor Xa (Coatest Factor VIII, Chromogenix, Sweden).<br>
Example 5C - Demonstration of single chain FVIII expression in HEK293 cells<br>
In order to demonstrate that the FVIII derivatives were secreted into culture media as a single<br>
chain polypeptide, stably transfected HEK293 cells were grown in the media supplemented with<br>
35S-methionine for 6 hrs. The conditioned media and cell extracts were then prepared for<br>
analysis by immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 5A). The<br>
migration of the FVIII derivatives from the cell extracts (C) and conditioned medium (M) is<br>
shown. The names of each FVIII derivatives are indicated on the top. The results demonstrate<br>
that the FVIII derivatives which were generated by the fusing of Al, A2, and B domains to the<br>
amino acid sequence in the A3 domain beyond Arg-1648, an intracellular processing site, did not<br>
affect the synthesis or secretion of the FVIII derivatives from the cell. The predominant FVIII<br>
species produced was a single chain molecule of approximately 170kDa. For immunoblotting<br>
for FVIII antigen, media containing the recombinant Factor VIII derivatives dB782 and dBN(45-<br>
50) as well as media from normal HEK293 control cells were concentrated approximately 100-<br>
fold using Centricon 30,000 MWCO on the day of harvest.<br>
FVIII concentration was measured using an ELISA method. Concentrates were then separated<br>
by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody (ESH-8). As<br>
shown in Figure 5B, ESH-8 antibody used in Western blotting detected a major protein,<br>
migrating to approximately 170 kDa, which is similar to results from the metabolic labeling<br>
experiment in Figure 5A.<br>
These results indicate that the FVIII derivatives in this invention are present in culture media<br>
mainly in an unprocessed, single-chain form of the FVIII molecule. Figure 5C depicts thrombin<br>
activation of FVIII derivatives. 35S-methionine labeled FVIII derivatives were<br>
immunoprecipitated from the chase conditioned medium of stably expressing HEK293 cells and<br>
were divided into equal aliquots and incubated in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or presence<br>
(lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) of thrombin (1 U/mL) for 30 min at 37°C. Reactions were terminated with<br>
SDS-PAGE sample buffer and protein fragments were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. FVIII<br>
protein forms are indicated at the right as follows: SC, single chain; Al, and A2, thrombincleaved<br>
heavy chain fragments; LC, thrombin-cleaved light chain. The names of each FVIII<br>
derivatives are indicated on the top. Analysis of the radiolabeled protein after thrombin<br>
digestion indicated a normal appearance of the 73 kD, and 50 and 40 kd fragments<br>
corresponding to the molecular sizes of thrombin-cleaved light chain, Al and A2 domains,<br>
respectively. This result demonstrated that single chain FVIII derivatives are cleaved and then<br>
activated in the similar pattern as the native or full-length FVIII proteins. These single-chain<br>
FVIII derivatives may be advantageous in that they may be produced in more homogeneous<br>
forms and may have an improved stability to natural human or other recombinant FVIII proteins.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 - Establishment of CHO cell lines expressing FVIII derivatives<br>
Example 6A - Construction of plasmids<br>
The plasmids for the establishment of stably transfected CHO cell lines were constructed by the<br>
insertion of an expression cassette called pI2G-DHFR comprising the promoter sequences of<br>
SV40, the gene coding for the DHFR selection marker, and the SV40 late polyadenylation signal<br>
sequences into the single Mfe I site of the mammalian expression vectors described in Example<br>
3. The ends liberated by the Mfe I digestion were made blunt by treatment with the Klenow<br>
fragment of DNA polymerase I. The subcloning procedure is depicted in Figure 6.<br>
Example 6B - Transfect ion of CHO cells with plasmids<br>
CHO cells were transfected with the linearized DNA of plasmids pI2G-DHFR including coding<br>
sequences for dB782 by a liposome-based transfection method, with 1 or 2 ug of DNA per 10 cm<br>
diameter dish. Forty eight hours after the transfection, the cells are trypsinized, diluted and<br>
incubated in IMDM selective medium including 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum without<br>
hypoxanthine, thymidine, and xanthine. After two weeks, the clones resistant to the selective<br>
medium were subcultured to 1-ml and then 2-ml cups. When the cells reached 70% confluence,<br>
the medium was removed and the cell lawns were washed and replenished with fresh medium<br>
containing 5% of inactivated serum (to avoid a high background in the coagulation tests). After<br>
24 hours, the medium was harvested and analyzed for the procoagulant activity of FVIIL<br>
Biologically active human FVIII was quantified in culture supernatant samples by the standard<br>
coagulation or clotting assay (so-called activated partial thromboplastin time) using FVIIIdeficient<br>
plasma as previously described (Veldkamp et al., Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1968, 19:<br>
279). Results of Factor VIII activity in cells resistant to increasing concentrations of MIX are<br>
presented in Table 5.<br>

Recombinant full-length FVIII and FVIII derivatives were compared in a study of kinetics of<br>
activation by thrombin. The activation was measured in a classical coagulation test (APTT) after<br>
incubation in the presence of a catalytic amount of thrombin.<br>
Figures 7A and 7B show a comparison of thrombin activation kinetics of the recombinant human<br>
FVIII (rH  FVIII) and FVIII derivatives. Some FVIII derivatives are activated more strongly<br>
