				<td>COATED PIPES HAVING IMPROVED MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND A METHOD OF<br>
PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
Objective of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to polymer coated pipes. More specifically, the present<br>
invention is directed to coated metal pipes having an improved resistance to stress cracking<br>
for a given density of the coating. In addition, the present invention is directed to a method of<br>
producing such coated metal pipes with a high throughput and good production economy.<br>
Technical background and prior art<br>
The use of bimodal or multimodal ethylene polymers in coating of steel pipes is known from<br>
EP-A-837915. However, even though the document teaches that the coatings have good<br>
mechanical properties there still exists a need to further improve the slow crack growth<br>
resistance and improve the balance between the stiffness and stress cracking resistance of<br>
the coating composition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides polyethylene coated metal pipes that have an improved<br>
resistance against stress cracking and/or can be used at a wide range of service<br>
temperature.<br>
One aspect of the present invention is to provide a pipe comprising an inner surface, an<br>
outer surface layer (A) and a coating layer (B) covering said outer surface (A), wherein the<br>
coating layer (B) comprises a coating composition (B-2) comprising a multimodal copolymer<br>
of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms (B-<br>
1), wherein the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a weight average molecular weight<br>
of from 70000 g/mol to 250000 g/mol, a melt index MFR2 of from 0.05 g/10 min to 5 g/10 min,<br>
a melt index MFR5 of from 0.5 to 10 g/10 min and a density of from 930 kg/m3to 950 kg/m3.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is to provide pipes comprising an inner surface and<br>
an outer surface layer (A) and a coating layer (B) wherein<br>
the coating layer (B) comprises a coating composition (B-2) comprising a multimodal<br>
copolymer of ethylene and one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms (B-1), wherein the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) further comprises<br>
(B-1-1) from 40 to 60 %, based on the weight of the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1), of<br>
a low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer component, said low molecular weight<br>
ethylene homopolymer having a weight average molecular weight of from 5000 g/mol to<br>
70000 g/mol; and<br>
(B-1-2) from 60 to 40 %, based on the weight of the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1), of<br>
a high molecular weight ethylene copolymer component, said high molecular weight ethylene<br>
copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of from 100000 g/mol to 700000 g/mol;<br>
and<br>
the multimodal ethylene copolymer has a weight average molecular weight of from 70000<br>
g/mol to 250000 g/mol and a melt index MFR2 of from 0.05 g/10 min to 5 g/10 min, preferably<br>
from 0.1 to 1.2 g/10 min and more preferably 0.2 - 0.8. Preferably, it further has an MFR5 of<br>
0.5 to 10 g/10 min, more preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 g/10 min. Preferably still it has a density<br>
of from 930 kg/m3 to 950 kg/m3.<br>
The third aspect of the present invention is providing a method for producing the coated<br>
pipes as disclosed above. The process comprises the steps of:<br>
providing a pipe having an outer surface layer (A);<br>
applying a coating composition (B-2) onto the pipe outer surface layer (A) to form a coating<br>
layer (B), wherein the coating composition (B-2) comprises a multimodal copolymer of<br>
ethylene and one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms (B-1),<br>
wherein the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a weight average molecular weight of<br>
from 70000 g/mol to 250000 g/mol, a melt index MFR2 of from 0.05 g/10 min to 5 g/10 min, a<br>
melt index MFR5 of from 0.5 to 10 g/10 min and a density of from 930 kg/m3 to 950 kg/m3.<br>
The fourth aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for producing coated pipes<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) polymerising ethylene, in a first polymerisation stage, in the presence of a polymerisation<br>
catalyst, hydrogen, ethylene and optionally an inert diluent to produce a low molecular weight<br>
ethylene homopolymer (B-1-1) having a weight average molecular weight of from 5000 g/mol<br>
to 70000 g/mol and which constitutes from 40 to 60 % by weight of the multimodal ethylene<br>
copolymer (B-1); and<br>
(ii) polymerising, in a second polymerisation stage, ethylene and one or more alpha-olefin<br>
comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms in the presence of a polymerisation catalyst,<br>
ethylene, one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having 6 to 10 carbon atoms and optionally<br>
hydrogen and/or an inert diluent to produce a high molecular weight copolymer of ethylene<br>
and one or more alpha-olefin comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms (B-1-2) having<br>
a weight average molecular weight of from 200000 g/mol to 700000 g/mol, which high<br>
molecular weight ethylene component (B-1-2) constitutes from 40 to 60 % by weight of the<br>
multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1); and wherein said first and said second polymerisation<br>
step are performed as successive polymerisation steps with the polymer product produced in<br>
any previous step being present in the subsequent step(s) and wherein said first step and<br>
said second step can be performed in any order and wherein the resulting multimodal<br>
ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a weight average molecular weight of from 70000 g/mol to<br>
250000 g/mol and a melt index MFR2 of from 0.05 g/10 min to 5 g/10 min, a melt index MFR5<br>
of from 0.5 to 10 g/10 min and a density of from 930 kg/m3 to 950 kg/m3;<br>
(iii) recovering said multimodal ethylene copolymer;<br>
(iv) obtaining the coating composition (B-2) comprising 80 to 100 % by weight, preferably<br>
from 85 to 100 % by weight and in particular from 90 to 99 % by weight of the multimodal<br>
ethylene copolymer (B-1), optional additives and optional other polymers;<br>
(iv) applying said coating composition (B-2) onto the pipe (A) to form the coating layer (B)<br>
The coated pipes according to the present invention exhibit a good stress crack resistance<br>
as measured by the CTL method described elsewhere in this patent application, typically of<br>
at least 60 hours, preferably of at least 100 hours. Thus, at a given density of the multimodal<br>
ethylene copolymer (B-1) the coating composition (B-2) comprising the multimodal ethylene<br>
copolymer (B-1) has an increased CTL compared to the prior art compositions.<br>
The pipe coating process allows the preparation of coated pipes having good mechanical<br>
properties with a high throughput.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Multimodal ethylene copolymer<br>
The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) is a copolymer of ethylene and one or more alpha-<br>
olefin comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms. The multimodal ethylene copolymer<br>
has a weight average molecular weight of 70000 to 250000 g/mol, a melt index MFR2 of from<br>
0.05 to 5 g/10 min, preferably from 0.1 to 1.2 g/10 min, and more preferably from 0.2 to 1.0<br>
g/10 min. Preferably, it further has an MFR5 of 0.5 to 10 g/10 min, more preferably from 1.0<br>
to 5.0 g/10 min. Furthermore, the multimodal ethylene copolymer has a density of from 930<br>
to 950 kg/m3, preferably from 933 to 944 kg/m3 and more preferably from 936 to 944 kg/m3.<br>
When the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has the comonomers selected from alpha-<br>
olefins having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms the coating composition (B-2) has the improved<br>
mechanical properties. If comonomers having a lower number of carbon atoms are used, the<br>
composition does not have the advantageous mechanical properties. On the other hand, if<br>
comonomers having a higher number of carbon atoms are used the incorporation of the<br>
comonomer is slower and it becomes more difficult to produce the copolymer (B-1).<br>
When the multimodal copolymer (B-1) has the weight average molecular weight between<br>
70000 and 250000 g/mol and a melt index MFR2 within the range of 0.05 to 5 g/10 min the<br>
coating composition (B-2) has a good processability and good mechanical properties. If the<br>
molecular weight is lower than the specified range and/or the melt index is higher than the<br>
specified range the coating composition has inferior mechanical properties. On the other<br>
hand, if the molecular weight is higher than the specified range and/or the melt index is lower<br>
than the specified range the coating composition has a poor processability. By poor<br>
processability is meant a low throughput, poor neck-in behaviour and/or line breaks during<br>
the coating process.<br>
Preferably the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) has a broad molecular weight<br>
distribution as indicated by the ratio of weight average molecular weight to the number<br>
average molecular weight, Mw/Mn, of from 15 to 50, preferably from 20 to 40 and in<br>
particular from 25 to 40. When the ratio of the weight average molecular weight to the<br>
number average molecular weight is within these limits the multimodal ethylene copolymer<br>
(B-1) has a good combination between processability and homogeneity.<br>
The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) advantageously comprises from 40 to 60 % by<br>
weight, based on the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1), of low molecular weight ethylene<br>
homopolymer component (B-1-1). The low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer<br>
component (B-1-1) has a weight average molecular weight of from 5000 to 70000 g/mol,<br>
preferably form 15000 to 50000 g/mol. Preferably the low molecular weight ethylene<br>
homopolymer component (B-1-1) has a melt index MFR2 of from 100 to 1500 g/10 min, more<br>
preferably from 150 to 1000 g/10 min. Preferably still, the low molecular weight ethylene<br>
homopolymer component (B-1-1) has a density of at least 969 kg/m3, more preferably of 971<br>
to 978 kg/m3.<br>
It should be understood that within the meaning of the present invention the term<br>
"homopolymer" is used to mean a linear ethylene polymer which essentially consists of<br>
ethylene repeating units. It may contain trace amount of units derived from other<br>
polymerisable monomers, but it should contain at least about 99.9 % by mole of ethylene<br>
repeating units, based on all the repeating units present in the low molecular weight ethylene<br>
homopolymer component.<br>
The multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) advantageously also comprises from 40 to 60 % by<br>
weight, based on the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1), a high molecular weight<br>
copolymer of ethylene and alpha-olefins having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms (B-1-2). The high<br>
molecular weight copolymer component (B-1-2) has a weight average molecular weight of<br>
from 100000 to 700000 g/mol, preferably 150000 to 300000 g/mol. Preferably, it further has a<br>
content of alpha-olefin comonomers having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms of 0.5 to 10 % by<br>
mole, preferably from 1 to 5 % by mole, based on the total number of moles of repeating<br>
units in the high molecular weight copolymer component (B-1-2).<br>
It should be understood that within the meaning of the present invention the term "copolymer<br>
of ethylene and alpha-olefins having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms" is used to mean an ethylene<br>
polymer which essentially consists of ethylene repeating units and repeating units derived<br>
from alpha-olefins having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms. It may contain trace amount of units<br>
derived from other polymerisable monomers, but it should contain at least about 99.9 % by<br>
mole of above-mentioned repeating units, based on all the repeating units present in the high<br>
molecular weight ethylene copolymer component.<br>
The inventors have found that when the low molecular weight component (B-1-1) and the<br>
high molecular weight component (B-1-2) as described above are present in the multimodal<br>
ethylene copolymer (B-1) the advantageous properties of the multimodal ethylene polymer<br>
(B-1) and the coating composition (B-2) are conveniently obtained.<br>
!n addition to the two components referred above the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1)<br>
may contain up to 20 % by weight of other polymer components. The amount ant the<br>
properties of such additional polymer components may be selected freely provided that the<br>
properties of the multimodal ethylene copolymer and of the two above-mentioned<br>
components are those discussed above and that the properties of the multimodal ethylene<br>
copolymer (B-1) are still within the limits specified herein.<br>
Polymerisation process<br>
The multimodal ethylene copolymer may be produced in any suitable polymerisation process<br>
known in the art. Preferably the multimodal ethylene copolymer is produced in a sequential<br>
polymerisation process comprising at least two polymerisation zones operating at different<br>
conditions to produce the multimodal copolymer. The polymerisation zones may operate in<br>
slurry, solution, or gas phase conditions or their combinations. Suitable processes are<br>
disclosed, among others, in WO-A-92/12182 and WO-A-96/18662.<br>
Catalyst<br>
The polymerisation is conducted in the presence of an olefin polymerisation catalyst. The<br>
catalyst may be any catalyst which is capable of producing all components of the multimodal<br>
ethylene copolymer. Suitable catalysts are, among others, Ziegler - Natta catalysts based on<br>
a transition metal, such as titanium, zirconium and/or vanadium or metallocene catalysts or<br>
late transition metal catalysts, as well as their mixtures. Especially Ziegler - Natta catalysts<br>
and metallocene catalysts are useful as they can produce polymers within a wide range of<br>
molecular weight with a high productivity.<br>
Suitable Ziegler- Natta catalysts preferably contain a magnesium compound, an aluminium<br>
compound and a titanium compound supported on a particulate support.<br>
The particulate support can be an inorganic oxide support, such as silica, alumina, titania,<br>
silica-alumina and silica-titania. Preferably, the support is silica.<br>
The average particle size of the silica support can be typically from 10 to 100 µm. However,<br>
it has turned out that special advantages can be obtained if the support has an average<br>
particle size from 15 to 30 µm, preferably from 18 to 25 µm. Alternatively, the support may<br>
have an average particle size of from 30 a 80 µm, preferably from 30 to 50 µm. Examples of<br>
suitable support materials are, for instance, ES747JR produced and marketed by Ineos<br>
Silicas (former Crossfield), and SP9-491, produced and marketed by Grace.<br>
The magnesium compound is a reaction product of a magnesium dialkyl and an alcohol. The<br>
alcohol is a linear or branched aliphatic monoalcohol. Preferably, the alcohol has from 6 to<br>
16 carbon atoms. Branched alcohols are especially preferred, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol is one<br>
example of the preferred alcohols. The magnesium dialkyl may be any compound of<br>
magnesium bonding to two alkyl groups, which may be the same or different. Butyl-octyl<br>
magnesium is one example of the preferred magnesium dialkyls.<br>
The aluminium compound is chlorine containing aluminium alkyl. Especially preferred<br>
compounds are aluminium alkyl dichlorides and aluminium alkyl sesquichlorides.<br>
The titanium compound is a halogen containing titanium compound, preferably chlorine<br>
containing titanium compound. Especially preferred titanium compound is titanium<br>
tetrachloride.<br>
The catalyst can be prepared by sequentially contacting the carrier with the above mentioned<br>
compounds, as described in EP-A-688794 or WO-A-99/51646. Alternatively, it can be<br>
prepared by first preparing a solution from the components and then contacting the solution<br>
with a carrier, as described in WO-A-01/55230.<br>
Another, especially preferred, group of suitable Ziegler - Natta catalysts contain a titanium<br>
compound together with a magnesium halide compound without an inert support. Thus, the<br>
catalyst contains a titanium compound on a magnesium dihalide, like magnesium dichloride.<br>
Such catalysts are disclosed, for instance, in WO-A-2005/118655 and EP-A-810235.<br>
The Ziegler- Natta catalyst is used together with an activator. Suitable activators are metal<br>
alkyl compounds and especially aluminium alkyl compounds. These compounds include alkyl<br>
aluminium halides, such as ethylaluminium dichloride, diethylaluminium chloride,<br>
ethylaluminium sesquichloride, dimethylaluminium chloride and the like. They also include<br>
trialkylaluminium compounds, such as trimethylaluminium, triethylaluminium, tri-<br>
isobutylaluminium, trihexylaluminium and tri-n-octylaluminium. Furthermore they include<br>
alkylaluminium oxy-compounds, such as methylaluminiumoxane,<br>
hexaisobutylaluminiumoxane and tetraisobutylaluminiumoxane. Also other aluminium alkyl<br>
compounds, such as isoprenylaluminium, may be used. Especially preferred activators are<br>
trialkylaluminiums, of which triethylaluminium, trimethylaluminium and tri-isobutylaluminium<br>
are particularly used.<br>
The amount in which the activator is used depends on the specific catalyst and activator.<br>
Typically triethylaluminium is used in such amount that the molar ratio of aluminium to the<br>
transition metal, like Al/Ti, is from 1 to 1000, preferably from 3 to 100 and in particular from<br>
about 5 to about 30 mol/mol.<br>
As discussed above, also metallocene catalysts may be used to produce the multimodal<br>
ethylene copolymer. Suitable metallocene catalysts are known in the art and are disclosed,<br>
among others, in WO-A-95/12622, WO-A-96/32423, WO-A-97/28170, WO-A-98/32776,<br>
WO-A-99/61489, WO-A-03/010208, WO-A-03/051934, WO-A-03/051514, WO-A-<br>
2004/085499, EP-A-1752462 and EP-A-1739103.<br>
Polymerisation<br>
The polymerisation zone where the low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer is produced<br>
typically operates at a temperature of from 20 to 150 °C, preferably from 50 to 110 °C and<br>
more preferably from 60 to 100 °C. The polymerisation may be conducted in slurry, gas<br>
phase or solution.<br>
The catalyst may be transferred into the polymerisation zone by any means known in the art.<br>
It is thus possible to suspend the catalyst in a diluent and maintain it as homogeneous slurry.<br>
Especially preferred it is to use oil having a viscosity form 20 to 1500 mPa-s as diluent, as<br>
disclosed in WO-A-2006/063771. It is also possible to mix the catalyst with a viscous mixture<br>
of grease and oil and feed the resultant paste into the polymerisation zone. Further still, it is<br>
possible to let the catalyst settle and introduce portions of thus obtained catalyst mud into the<br>
polymerisation zone in a manner disclosed, for instance, in EP-A-428054. The<br>
polymerisation zone may also be preceded by a prepolymerisation zone, in which case the<br>
mixture withdrawn from the prepolymerisation zone is directed into the polymerisation zone.<br>
Into the polymerisation zone is also introduced ethylene, optionally an inert diluent, and<br>
optionally hydrogen and/or comonomer. The low molecular weight ethylene homopolymer<br>
component is produced in a first polymerisation zone and the high molecular weight ethylene<br>
copolymer component is produced in a second polymerisation zone. The first polymerisation<br>
zone and the second polymerization zone may be connected in any order, i.e. the first<br>
polymerisation zone may precede the second polymerisation zone, or the second<br>
polymerisation zone may precede the first polymerisation zone or, alternatively,<br>
polymerisation zones may be connected in parallel. However, it is preferred to operate the<br>
polymerisation zones in cascaded mode.<br>
As it was disclosed above, the low molecular weight homopolymer is produced in the first<br>
polymerisation zone. Into the first polymerisation zone are introduced ethylene, hydrogen<br>
and optionally an inert diluent. Comonomer is not introduced into the first polymerisation<br>
zone. The polymerisation in the first polymerisation zone is conducted at a temperature<br>
within the range of from 50 to 115 °C, preferably from 80 to 110 °C and in particular from 90<br>
to 105 °C. The pressure in the first polymerisation zone is from 1 to 300 bar, preferably from<br>
5 to 100 bar.<br>
The polymerisation in the first polymerisation zone may be conducted in slurry. Then the<br>
polymer particles formed in the polymerisation, together with the catalyst fragmented and<br>
dispersed within the particles, are suspended in the fluid hydrocarbon. The slurry is agitated<br>
to enable the transfer of reactants from the fluid into the particles.<br>
The polymerisation usually takes place in an inert diluent, typically a hydrocarbon diluent<br>
such as methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes,<br>
octanes etc., or their mixtures. Preferably the diluent is a low-boiling hydrocarbon having<br>
from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such hydrocarbons. An especially preferred diluent<br>
is propane, possibly containing minor amount of methane, ethane and/or butane.<br>
The ethylene content in the fluid phase of the slurry may be from 2 to about 50 % by mole,<br>
preferably from about 3 to about 20 % by mole and in particular from about 5 to about 15 %<br>
by mole. The benefit of having a high ethylene concentration is that the productivity of the<br>
catalyst is increased but the drawback is that more ethylene then needs to be recycled than if<br>
the concentration was lower.<br>
The slurry polymerisation may be conducted in any known reactor used for slurry<br>
polymerisation. Such reactors include a continuous stirred tank reactor and a loop reactor. It<br>
is especially preferred to conduct the polymerisation in loop reactor. In such reactors the<br>
slurry is circulated with a high velocity along a closed pipe by using a circulation pump. Loop<br>
reactors are generally known in the art and examples are given, for instance, in US-A-<br>
4582816, US-A-3405109, US-A-3324093, EP-A-479186 and US-A-5391654.<br>
It is sometimes advantageous to conduct the slurry polymerisation above the critical<br>
temperature and pressure of the fluid mixture. Such operation is described in US-A-5391654.<br>
The amount of hydrogen is adjusted based on the desired melt flow rate and it also depends<br>
on the specific catalyst used. For many generally used Ziegler - Natta catalysts the molar<br>
ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 100 to 1000 mol/kmol, preferably from 200 to 800<br>
mol/kmol and in particular from 300 to 800 mol/kmol.<br>
The polymerisation in the first polymerisation zone may also be conducted in gas phase. A<br>
preferable embodiment of gas phase polymerisation reactor is a fluidised bed reactor. There<br>
the polymer particles formed in the polymerisation are suspended in upwards moving gas.<br>
The gas is introduced into the bottom part of the reactor. The upwards moving gas passes<br>
the fluidised bed wherein a part of the gas reacts in the presence of the catalyst and the<br>
unreacted gas is withdrawn from the top of the reactor. The gas is then compressed and<br>
cooled to remove the heat of polymerisation. To increase the cooling capacity it is sometimes<br>
desired to cool the recycle gas to a temperature where a part of the gas condenses. After<br>
cooling the recycle gas is reintroduced into the bottom of the reactor. Fluidised bed<br>
polymerisation reactors are disclosed, among others, in US-A-4994534, US-A-4588790, EP-<br>
A-699213, EP-A-628343, FI-A-921632, FI-A-935856, US-A-4877587, FI-A-933073 and EP-<br>
A-75049.<br>
In gas phase polymerisation using a Ziegler - Natta catalyst hydrogen is typically added in<br>
such amount that the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 500 to 10000 mol/kmol, preferably<br>
from 1000 to 5000 mol/kmol to obtain the desired molecular weight of the low molecular<br>
weight ethylene homopolymer component.<br>
The high molecular weight copolymer of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin having 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms is produced in the second polymerisation zone. Into the second polymerisation<br>
zone are introduced ethylene, alpha-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, hydrogen and<br>
optionally an inert diluent. The polymerisation in second polymerisation zone is conducted at<br>
a temperature within the range of from 50 to 100°C, preferably from 60 to 100oC and in<br>
particular from 70 to 95 °C. The pressure in the second polymerisation zone is from 1 to 300<br>
bar, preferably from 5 to 100 bar.<br>
The polymerisation in the second polymerisation zone may be conducted in slurry. The<br>
polymerisation may then be conducted along the lines as was discussed above for the first<br>
polymerisation zone.<br>
The amount of hydrogen is adjusted based on the desired melt flow rate and it also depends<br>
on the specific catalyst used. For many generally used Ziegler - Natta catalysts the molar<br>
ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 0 to 50 mol/kmol, preferably from 10 to 35 mol/kmol.<br>
Furthermore, the amount of alpha-olefin having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms is adjusted to<br>
reach the targeted density. The ratio of the alpha-olefin to ethylene is typically from 100 to<br>
500 mol/kmol, preferably from 150 to 350 mol/kmol.<br>
The polymerisation in the second polymerisation zone may also be conducted in gas phase.<br>
In gas phase polymerisation using a Ziegler- Natta catalyst hydrogen is typically added in<br>
such amount that the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene is from 5 to 100 mol/kmol, preferably from<br>
10 to 50 mol/kmol to obtain the desired molecular weight of the high molecular weight<br>
ethylene copolymer component (B-1-2). The amount of alpha-olefin having from 6 to 10<br>
carbon atoms is adjusted to reach the targeted density. The ratio of the alpha-olefin to<br>
ethylene is typically from 100 to 500 mol/kmol, preferably from 150 to 350 mol/kmol.<br>
Coating composition<br>
The coating composition (B-2) comprises the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) and<br>
eventual additives and other polymers. Preferably the coating composition (B-2) comprises<br>
from 80 to 100 % by weight, more preferably from 85 to 100 % by weight and in particular<br>
from 90 to 99 % by weight of the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1).<br>
In addition to the multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) the coating composition (B-2) typically<br>
contains conventional additives known in the art. Such additives are, among others,<br>
antioxidants, process stabilizers, UV-stabilizers, pigments and acid scavengers.<br>
Suitable antioxidants and stabilizers are, for instance, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, tetrakis-<br>
[methylene-3-(3',5-di-tert-butyl-4'hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane, octadecyl-3-3(3'5'-di-<br>
tert-butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, dilaurylthiodipropionate, distearylthiodipropionate,<br>
tris-(nonylphenyl)phosphate, distearyl-pentaerythritol-diphosphite and tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-<br>

zinc stearate. They are used in amounts generally known in the art, typically from 500 ppm to<br>
10000 ppm and preferably from 500 to 5000 ppm.<br>
Carbon black is a generally used pigment, which also acts as an UV-screener. Typically<br>
carbon black is used in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 % by weight, preferably from 1.5 to 3.0 %<br>
by weight. Preferably the carbon black is added as a masterbatch where it is premixed with a<br>
polymer, preferably high density polyethylene (HDPE), in a specific amount. Suitable<br>
masterbatches are, among others, HD4394, sold by Cabot Corporation, and PPM1805 by<br>
Poly Plast Muller. Also titanium oxide may be used as an UV-screener.<br>
In addition the coating composition (B-2) may contain further polymers, such as carrier<br>
polymers used in additive masterbatches. The amount and nature of such polymers may be<br>
chosen freely within the limits discussed above as long as the properties of the coating<br>
composition are not negatively affected.<br>
It is also possible to add a suitable amount of the adhesion polymer into the coating<br>
composition (B-2) to improve the adhesion between the pipe and the coating layer. In this<br>
way the amount of the polymer used in the adhesion layer may be reduced and in some<br>
cases it may be possible to eliminate the adhesion layer altogether.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition (B-2) has a flow rate ratio FRR5/2 of from 2 to 10,<br>
preferably from 2 to 6 and in particular from 3 to 5. Preferably still, it has a flow rate ratio<br>
FRR21/5 of 15 to 40, more preferably from 20 to 35 and/or a shear thinning index SHI2.7/210 of<br>
from 25 to 100.<br>
The coating composition (B-2) preferably has a high resistance to environmental stress<br>
cracking. Thus, preferably the coating composition has a stress cracking resistance, as<br>
measured by CTL (Constant Tensile Load) at 60 °C and 5 MPa of at least 60 h, more<br>
preferably of at least 80 h and especially preferably of at least 100 h.<br>
Preferably the coating composition (B-2) has a wear index of at most 30, more preferably of<br>
at most 25.<br>
Especially preferably the coating composition (B-2) has a balance between the density of the<br>
multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1) and the CTL so that the coating composition (B-2) has<br>
a value of CTL of at least 60 hours and comprises a multimodal ethylene copolymer (B-1)<br>
having a density of 930 to 950 kg/m3, more preferably has a CTL of at least 80 hours and<br>
comprises a multimodal ethylene copolymer having a density of 933 to 944 kg/m3, and in<br>
particular has a CTL of at least 100 hours and comprises a multimodal ethylene copolymer<br>
having a density of 936 to 944 kg/m3.<br>
Coating layer<br>
The coated pipe has a coating layer (B) which comprises the coating composition (B-2). The<br>
coating layer (B) comprises at least 75 % by weight, preferably at least 80 % by weight and<br>
more preferably at least 90 % by weight of the coating composition (B-2), based on the total<br>
weight of the coating layer (B). Especially preferably, the coating layer (B) consists of the<br>
coating composition (B-2).<br>
Pipe coating and coated pipe<br>
It is preferable to properly prepare the surface of the pipe before coating as it is known in the<br>
art. The pipe surface is typically inspected for any rust, dirt, flaws, discontinuities, and metal<br>
defects. All the excess material needs be removed from the pipe surface to make sure that<br>
the coating is properly adhered to the pipe. Suitable cleaning methods include air and water<br>
high pressure washing, grit or shot blasting and mechanical brushing. Also acid wash and<br>
chromate pre-treatment is sometimes used.<br>
Typically the pipes are heated with induction heating up to about 200 °C. The temperature is<br>
adjustable depending on the line speed and the material being used in the corrosion<br>
preventing layer (C). When the epoxy Teknos AR8434 is used the steel pipe is preferably<br>
heated to 190 °C. The temperature decreases slightly during the coating process.<br>
If epoxy powder (at 23 °C) is used it is typically sprayed on with epoxy guns, where the<br>
speed of the rotating pipe is about 9 m/min. The thickness of the epoxy and other coating<br>
materials are set in accordance with end use specified requirements. Normal thickness value<br>
for the epoxy layer (on-shore installations) is from 70 to 200 µm, such as 135 µm.<br>
Materials that may be used in the corrosion protection layer (C) are, for instance, epoxy<br>
resins and organosilicon compounds. Examples of suitable epoxy resins are phenol-based<br>
epoxies and amine-based epoxies. These kinds of epoxies are sold, among others, under<br>
trade names of AR8434 (of Teknos), Scotchkote 226N (of 3M) and PE50-7191 (of BASF).<br>
Suitable organosilicon compounds have been disclosed in EP-A-1859926.<br>
The extrusion of the adhesive (D) and the coating (B) layer may be performed, for instance,<br>
with two single screw extruders. They may have a diameter of, for instance, from 30 to 100<br>
mm, such as 60 mm, and a length of from 15 to 50 L/D, such as 30 L/D. The temperature is<br>
typically controlled in several zones and the temperature of the PE adhesive (D) and coating<br>
(B) layer after the die is from 190 to 300 °C, such as 225 and 250°C, respectively. Die widths<br>
are from 50 to 300 mm, such as 110 mm and 240 mm for the adhesive layer and coating<br>
layer, respectively. Both adhesive and the coating layer are usually rolled tightly onto the<br>
pipe with a silicone pressure roller. The thickness of the adhesive layer (D) is typically from<br>
200 to 400 µm, such as 290 µm. The thickness of the coating layer (B) is typically from 1 to 5<br>
mm, preferably from 2 to 4 mm, such as 3.2 mm.<br>
Materials suitable to be used in the adhesion layer (D) are, for instance, acid or acid<br>
anhydride grafted olefin polymers, like polyethylene or polypropylene. Suitable polymers are,<br>
among others, fumaric acid modified polyethylene, fumaric acid anhydride modified<br>
polyethylene, maleic acid modified polyethylene, maleic acid anhydride modified<br>
polyethylene, fumaric acid modified polypropylene, fumaric acid anhydride modified<br>
polypropylene, maleic acid modified polypropylene and maleic acid anhydride modified<br>
polypropylene. Examples of especially suitable adhesion plastics are given in EP-A-1316598.<br>
After the coating the coated pipe is cooled, for instance by providing water flow on the coated<br>
pipe surface.<br>
The coated pipes according to the present invention have improved mechanical properties,<br>
such as very high resistance to stress cracking. Further, the multimodal ethylene copolymer<br>
(B-1) contained in the coating composition (B-2) has a broad molecular weight distribution,<br>
allowing the coated pipes to be produced with high throughput and good production<br>
economy.<br>
Examples<br>
Methods<br>
CTL<br>
CTL is determined by using a method similar to ISO 6252:1992 as follows.<br>
The samples are prepared by pressing a plaque at 180 °C and 10 MPa pressure with a total<br>
length of 125 to 130 mm and a width at its ends of 21 ± 0.5 mm. The plaque then is milled<br>
into the correct dimensions in a fixture on two of the sides with a centre distance of both<br>
holders of 90 mm and a hole diameter of 10 mm. The central (narrow) part of the plaque has<br>
a parallel length of 30 ± 0.5 mm, a width of 9 ± 0.5 mm, and a thickness of 6 ± 0.5 mm.<br>
A front notch of 2.5 mm depth is then cut into the sample with a razor blade fitted into a<br>
notching machine (PENT-NOTCHER, Norman Brown engineering), the notching speed is 0.2<br>
mm/min. On the two remaining sides side grooves of 0.8 mm are cut which should be<br>
coplanar with the notch. After making the notches, the sample is conditioned in 23 ±1°C and<br>
50 % relative humidity for at least 48 h. The samples are then mounted into a test chamber in<br>
which the active solution (10 % solution of IGEPAL CO-730 in deionised water, chemical<br>
substance: 2-(4-nonyl-phenoxy)ethanol) is kept at 60 °C temperature. The samples are<br>
loaded with a dead weight corresponding to an initial stress of about 5 MPa and at the<br>
moment of breakage an automatic timer is shut off. The average of at least two<br>
measurements is reported.<br>
The sample and the notch applied to the sample are shown in Figure 1, in which:<br>
A: total length of the specimen125 to 130 mm<br>
B: distance between the centre points of the holders 90 mm<br>
C: width of the specimen at the end 21 ±0.5 mm<br>
D: hole diameter 10 mm<br>
E: side grooves 0.8 mm<br>
F: thickness of plaque 6 ± 0.2 mm<br>
G: width of narrow parallel part 9 ± 0.5 mm<br>
H: main notch 2.5 + 0.02 mm<br>
The length of the narrow section of the specimen was 30 ± 0.5 mm.<br>
GPC<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight distribution (MWD =<br>
Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight and Mw is the weight average<br>
molecular weight) is measured by a method based on ISO 16014-4:2003 and ASTM D 6474-<br>
99. A Waters GPCV2000 instrument, equipped with refractive index detector and online<br>
viscosimeter was used with 2 x GMHXL-HT and 1x G7000H columns from Tosoh Bioscience<br>
and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized with 250 mg/L 2,6-Di tert butyl-4-methyl-phenol)<br>
as solvent at 140 °C and at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. 209.5 uL of sample solution<br>
were injected per analysis. The column set was calibrated using universal calibration<br>
(according to ISO 16014-2:2003) with 15 narrow MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the<br>
range of 1 kg/mol to 12 000 kg/mol. Mark Houwink constants were used for polystyrene and<br>
polyethylene (K: 19 x 10"3 mL/g and a: 0.655 for PS, and K: 39 x10"3 mL/g and a: 0.725 for<br>
PE). All samples were prepared by dissolving 0.5 - 3.5 mg of polymer in 4 mL (at 140 °C) of<br>
stabilized TCB (same as mobile phase) and keeping for max. 3 hours at 160 °C with<br>
continuous shaking prior sampling in into the GPC instrument.<br>
Melt Index, Melt Flow Rate, Flow Rate Ratio (Ml, MFR, FRR):<br>
Melt Index (Ml) or Melt Flow Rate (MFR)<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min.<br>
The MFR is an indication of the melt viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at<br>
190°C for PE. The load under which the melt flow rate is determined is usually indicated as a<br>
subscript, for instance MFR2 is measured under 2.16 kg load, MFR5 is measured under 5 kg<br>
load or MFR21 is measured under 21.6 kg load.<br>
Flow Rate Ratio (FRR)<br>
The quantity FRR (flow rate ratio) is an indication of molecular weight distribution and<br>
denotes the ratio of flow rates at different loads. Thus, FRR21/2 denotes the value of<br>
MFR21/MFR2.<br>
Neck-in<br>
Neck-in was given as a width of the film after the 110 mm die in mm. In this test series neck-<br>
in is registered at the maximum peripheral speed of pipe the molten film can manage without<br>
variations in width. The neck-in was measured at a winding speed of 20 RPM.<br>
Peel strength<br>
Adhesion of polymer on steel was tested by Instron 1122 peel strength test equipment<br>
according to DIN 30670. A strip of 3 cm width is cut of the coating layer. The other end of the<br>
strip is fastened to pulling equipment and the pulling strength is measured during the peeling<br>
of the strip from the steel with a pulling speed of 10 mm/min. The results are expressed as N<br>
per cm. The peel strength was measured from the coatings produced at a screw speed of 50<br>
RPM.<br>
Pipe coating<br>
A steel pipe with a diameter of 114 mm was cleaned to remove the excess material from its<br>
surface. The pipe was then heated with induction heating to 190 °C. Epoxy powder (Teknos<br>
AR8434) was then sprayed onto the pipe surface with the rotating speed of the line of 9<br>
m/min so that the thickness of the epoxy layer was 135 urn. Then an adhesion plastic, a<br>
maleic acid anhydride grafted polyethylene adhesive, prepared according to composition 2 in<br>
EP 1 316 598 A1, was extruded onto the pipe by using a Barmag single screw extruder with<br>
an L/D ratio of 24 and a diameter of 45 mm and where the temperature of the melt after the<br>
die was 225 °C. The die width was 110 mm. Simultaneously the composition of Example 1<br>
was then extruded onto the adhesion layer by using a Krauss-Maffei extruder having a<br>
diameter of 45 mm and the L/D ratio of 30. The die width was 240 mm and the temperature<br>
of the melt after the die was 250 °C. The coating was conducted at extruder screw speeds of<br>
25, 50 and 100 RPM. At the screw speed of 25 RPM five different winding speeds were run,<br>
namely 9, 15, 20, 25 and 30 RPM.<br>
Rheology<br>
Rheological parameters such as Shear Thinning Index SHI and Viscosity were determined<br>
by using a Anton Paar Phisica MCR 300 Rheometer on compression moulded samples<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere at 190 °C using 25 mm diameter plates and plate and plate<br>
geometry with a 1.2 mm gap. The oscillatory shear experiments were done within the linear<br>
viscosity range of strain at frequencies from 0.05 to 300 rad/s (ISO 6721-1). Five<br>
measurement points per decade were made.<br>
The values of storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G") complex modulus (G*) and complex<br>
viscosity (?*) were obtained as a function of frequency (?). ?100 is used as abbreviation for<br>
the complex viscosity at the frequency of 100 rad/s.<br>
Shear thinning index (SHI), which correlates with MWD and is independent of Mw, was<br>
calculated according to Heino ("Rheological characterization of polyethylene fractions" Heino,<br>
E.L., Lehtinen, A., Tanner J., Seppala, J., Neste Oy, Porvoo, Finland, Theor. Appl. Rheol.,<br>
Proc. Int. Congr. Rheol, 11th (1992), 1, 360-362, and "The influence of molecular structure<br>
on some rheological properties of polyethylene", Heino, E.L., Borealis Polymers Oy, Porvoo,<br>
Finland, Annual Transactions of the Nordic Rheology Society, 1995).<br>
SHI value is obtained by calculating the complex viscosities at given values of complex<br>
modulus and calculating the ratio of the two viscosities. For example, using the values of<br>
complex modulus of 1 kPa and 100 kPa, then ?*(1 kPa) and ?*(100 kPa) are obtained at a<br>
constant value of complex modulus of 1 kPa and 100 kPa, respectively. The shear thinning<br>
index SHI1/100 is then defined as the ratio of the two viscosities ?*(1 kPa) and ?*(100 kPa), i.e.<br>
?(1)/?(100).<br>
It is not always practical to measure the complex viscosity at a low value of the frequency<br>
directly. The value can be extrapolated by conducting the measurements down to the<br>
frequency of 0.126 rad/s, drawing the plot of complex viscosity vs. frequency in a logarithmic<br>
scale, drawing a best-fitting line through the five points corresponding to the lowest values of<br>
frequency and reading the viscosity value from this line.<br>
Shore Hardness<br>
Shore D hardness was determined according to ISO 868-2003. The measurement was done<br>
on round disks having a diameter of 35 mm and thickness of 4 mm and which were punched<br>
from compression moulded sheets having a thickness of 4 mm. The sheet was moulded<br>
according to ISO 1872-2 at 180 °C with a cooling rate 15 °C/min. Finally, the plaques are<br>
conditioned at 23 °C at 50 % relative humidity for at least two days.<br>
Five measurements per sample are made. The measurement points are selected so that<br>
there is at least 10 mm distance to the edge of the disc and at least 6 mm distance to the<br>
nearest previous measurement point.<br>
During the measurement a specified indenter (type D durometer) is forced into the test<br>
specimen under specified conditions (a mass of 5 kg). After 15 s the mass is removed, and<br>
the depth of penetration is measured.<br>
Wear index<br>
Wear index is determined by conducting Taber abrasion test on plaques according to ASTM<br>
D 4060.<br>
The specimen is a 2 mm thick 100x100 mm compression moulded plaque having a hole with<br>
6.3 mm diameter at the centre. The specimen has been thermostated for at least 24 hours at<br>
23 °C temperature and 50 % relative humidity. The test is done by using CS-17 abrasion<br>
wheel. The wheel is adjusted by placing the specimen in the device and running the wheel<br>
50 cycles. The specimen is then carefully cleaned and weighed after which the specimen is<br>
placed in the testing device and the test is started. The wear index (I) is calculated as:<br><br>
where A = weight of the specimen before the abrasion, B = weight of the specimen after the<br>
abrasion and C = number of abrasion cycles.<br>
The adjustment of the wheel is done at the beginning of each test and after 500 cycles.<br>
Density:<br>
Density of the polymer was measured according to ISO 1183-2 / 1872-2B.<br>
Tensile Strength:<br>
Tensile strength properties were determined according to ISO 527-2. Compression moulded<br>
specimens of type 1A were used, which were prepared according to ISO 1872-2B.<br>
Strain at Yield:<br>
Strain at yield (in %) was determined according to ISO 527-2. The measurement was<br>
conducted at 23 °C temperature with an elongation rate of 50 mm/min.<br>
Stress at Yield:<br>
Stress at yield (in MPa) was determined according to ISO 527-2. The measurement was<br>
conducted at 23 °C temperature with an elongation rate of 50 mm/min.<br>
Tensile Modulus<br>
Tensile modulus (in MPa) was determined according to ISO 527-2. The measurement was<br>
conducted at 23 °C temperature with an elongation rate of 1 mm/min.<br>
Tensile Break:<br>
Tensile break was determined according to ISO 527-2. The measurement was conducted at<br>
23 °C temperature with an elongation rate of 50 mm/min.<br>
DSC:<br>
The Melting Temperature (Tm) and the Crystallization Temperature (Tcr) were measured with<br>
Mettler TA820 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) on 3±0.5 mg samples. Both<br>
crystallization and melting curves were obtained during 10°C/min cooling and heating scans<br>
between -10 - 200°C. Melting and crystallization temperatures were taken as the peaks of<br>
endotherms and exotherms, respectively. The degree of crystallinity was calculated by<br>
comparison with heat of fusion of a perfectly crystalline polyethylene, i.e. 290 J/g.<br>
Comonomer content:<br>
13C-NMR analysis was used to determine the comonomer content of the samples. Samples<br>
were prepared by dissolving approximately 0.100 g of polymer and 2.5 ml of solvent in a 10<br>
mm NMR tube. The solvent was a 90/10 mixture of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and benzene-d6.<br>
Samples were dissolved and homogenised by heating the tube and its contents at 150 C in a<br>
heating block.<br>
The proton decoupled carbon-13 single pulse NMR spectra with NOE were recorded on a<br>
Joel ECX 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The acquisition parameters used for the experiment<br>
included a flip-angle of 45 degrees, 4 dummy scans, 3000 transients and a 1.6 s acquisition<br>
time, a spectral width of 20kHz, temperature of 125 C, WALTZ decoupling and a relaxation<br>
delay of 6.0 s. The processing parameters used included zero-filling to 32k data points and<br>
apodisation using an exponential window function with in 1.0 Hz artificial line broadening<br>
followed by automatic zeroth and first order phase correction and automatic baseline<br>
correction.<br>
Comonomer contents were calculated using integral ratios taken from the processed<br>
spectrum using the assignments described in JC. Randall's work (JMS - Rev. Macromol.<br>
Chem. Phys., C29(2&amp;3), 201-317 (1989) using:<br>

where methine is the CH branch site, alpha, beta, gamma the carbon sits adjacent to the CH<br>
i.e. CH, alpha, beta, gamma, delta. \delta++ is the bulk CH2 site and the 1,2,3 and 4 sites<br>

Example 1<br>
A loop reactor having a volume of 50 dm3 was operated continuously at a temperature of 60<br>
°C and a pressure of 62 bar. Into the reactor were introduced 41 kg/h of propane diluent, 2<br>
kg/h of ethylene and 35 g/h of hydrogen. In addition 6.3 g/h of a solid polymerisation catalyst<br>
component sold by BASF under a trade name of Lynx 200 was introduced into the reactor<br>
together with triethylaluminium cocatalyst so that the ratio of aluminium to titanium was 30<br>
mol/mol. The rate of polymer production was about 1.8 kg/h.<br>
The slurry from the 50 dm3 loop reactor was withdrawn and transferred continuously to<br>
another loop reactor having a volume of 500 dm3 and which was operated at a temperature<br>
of 95 °C and a pressure of 60 bar. Into the reactor were introduced additional propane<br>
diluent, ethylene and hydrogen. The ethylene concentration in the fluid mixture was 3.6 mol-<br>
%, based on the total number of moles in the fluid mixture, and the rate of polymer<br>
production was about 30 kg/h. The conditions and data can be seen in Table 1.<br>
The slurry from the loop reactor was withdrawn by using settling legs into a flash vessel<br>
operated at a temperature of 50 °C and a pressure of 3 bar where the hydrogen and major<br>
part of the hydrocarbons was removed from the polymer. The ethylene homopotymer was<br>
directed into a fluidised bed gas phase reactor operated at 85 °C temperature and 20 bar<br>
pressure. Into the reactor were introduced additional ethylene, 1-hexene comonomer,<br>
hydrogen and nitrogen as inert gas. The ethylene concentration was 16 mol-%, based on the<br>
total number of moles in the gas mixture, and the other conditions and data are shown in<br>
Tablet<br>
The resulting polymer powder was dried from hydrocarbons and mixed with 3000 ppm of<br>
Irganox B225, 1000 ppm of calcium stearate and 2.4 % of carbon black, based on the final<br>
composition. The mixture was then extruded into pellets by using a CIM90P twin screw<br>
extruder (manufactured by Japan Steel Works). The properties of the polymer and the<br>
composition are shown in Table 2.<br>
The resulting composition was used in coating a steel pipe as described above in the<br>
description of the methods under the title "Pipe coating". Data is shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 2 and Reference Example 3R<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that conditions were as shown in Table 1.<br>
The polymer data is shown in Table 2.<br>
Reference Example 4R<br>
The multimodal ethylene polymer was similar to Polyethene #3 of Example 2 of EP 837915.<br>
It can be seen from the data that in Examples 1 and 2 where 1-hexene had been used as a<br>
comonomer in the high molecular weight copolymer component clearly had a higher ESCR<br>
than the Reference Examples 3R and 4R having 1-butene as a comonomer. Furthermore,<br>
the Examples 1 and 2 have a slightly higher tensile modulus corresponding to a specific<br>
density than the Reference Examples 3R and 4R.<br>
