Description<br>
Winding device of a textile machine for the manufacture of cross-wound bobbins (cheeses)<br>
The invention relates to a winding device of a textile machine for the manufacture of cross-wound bobbins<br>
(cheeses), in accordance with the preamble to Claim l <br>
Such winding devices are known, for example, from the<br>
publicly distributed copy of the application for<br>
Japanese patent Hei 5-246 626.<br>
This document describes a winding device for an automatic textile machine for cross-wound bobbins or cheeses, which features a pivotable suction nozzle by means of an individual drive unit pertaining to it, in which situation a sensor device is installed inside the suction nozzle for detecting an upper thread which is take up. In addition to this, the maximum search time, i.e. the time during which the suction nozzle remains positioned on the surface of a winding or take-up bobbin, is capable of being adjusted by means of a timing element.<br>
In the event of no thread end being detected by the sensor within the specified search time, the thread search, and therefore also the thread connection attempt, will be interrupted.<br>
DE 42 31 958 Al describes a winding device with a thread connecting device, which is provided with a multifunction thread handling element mounted so as to be capable of pivoting. By means of this thread handling element, both the upper thread and the lower thread are laid into a splicing device. While the thread handling element takes up the lower thread directly, the upper thread is taken up indirectly by means of an additional<br><br>
2<br>
flat nozzle. The thread handling element for taking charge of the thread is capable of being docked onto this flat nozzle. The flat nozzle is connected to a motor, which pivots the flat nozzle during the winding process in such a way that the mouth of the nozzle remains in the vicinity of the surface of the winding coil. By means of the appropriate control of this motor, it is also possible to vary the distance between the mouth of the flat nozzle and the surface of the winding bobbin.<br>
Taking the foregoing state of the art as a basis, the<br>
invention is based on the objective of improving still further the known winding devices for textile machines for the manufacture of cross-wound bobbins (cheeses).<br>
This objective is resolved according to the invention by <br>
a device and its advantageous embodiments as described hereunder.<br><br>
Thanks to the design of the suction nozzle according to the invention, it can be guaranteed that thread loops which may jam in the area of the suction nozzle mouth, in particular at the needle comb arranged in this area, and might then obstruct the suction intake of the end of the upper thread into the suction nozzle, can be reliably avoided.<br>
Thread loops of this nature, which occur in particular in the case of hairy yarns, are released by the nodding movements of the suction nozzle. This means that the needle comb, which is constantly moved away from the surface of the winding bobbin due to the nodding motion of the suction nozzle, draws off possible thread loops in the direction of the thread end, and accordingly<br><br>
3<br>
releases them. The nodding motion of the suction nozzle in this situation is created by the appropriate actuation of a reversible drive unit which is connected to the suction nozzle. The drive unit in this context is initiated by the winding head computer as a function of a "negative signal" from the sensor device integrated in the suction nozzle. This means that, if the sensor device does not detect a start to the thread, the reversible drive will be switched on.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sensor device, is designed as an optical thread sensor, which, in the conventional manner, is provided with a light source as well as a photoelectric receiver element, such as a phototransistor, for example, a photo diode, or a photo-resistor. With sensor devices of this type, such as are known, for example, from DE-OS 21 23 641, a thread end which extends into the area between the light source and the receiver element, leads to a shadow being cast on the receiver element. This shadow is converted in the receiver element into an electrical signal, which is passed on via a signal line to the winding head computer.<br>
If the winding head computer does not receive such a signal within a predetermined period of time, during which the suction nozzle mouth is positioned in the area of the surface of the winding bobbin, the absence of such a signal will be assessed by the winding head computer as to indicate that the upper thread either cannot be taken up, or, as may occur in particular with hairy yarn, has not been taken up in the proper manner, i.e. has been taken up as a thread loop, and that this thread loop is now jammed in the needle comb of the suction nozzle mouth.<br>
The winding head computer reacts to this "negative signal" from the sensor device by activating the reversible drive.<br><br>
4<br><br>
Provision is made in a further embodiment of the invention for the suction nozzle to be connected to the reversible drive by means of a disk cam transmission system. The cam disk in this situation features a guide contour, which makes it possible for the cam disk to be rotated in a clockwise direction as well as counter-clockwise. This means that a cam lever, which is in contact on the cam disk by means of a roller, on the guide contour, which is connected, for example, by means of a toothed segment to a corresponding pinion in the suction nozzle, can be moved backward and forwards by reversing the drive unit, which is then transferred in the form of nodding movements to the suction nozzle. A device designed in - such a manner can not only be very precisely pivoted by means of the specified value of the rotation angle of the drive, but is also characterised by a high degree of reliability -and long service life.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment to claim should be avorided in desied the dwell time during which the suction nozzle mouth is positioned in each case in the area of the unwinding bobbin surface can be adjusted by. the winding head computer. This means that by making the appropriate adjustment of the stop times of the reversible drive unit to accord with the given winding conditions, taking into account in particular the yarn material in question, it is possible for the time required for the upper thread to be taken up to be minimised, which has a positive effect on the duration of the thread connecting process, and therefore leads to further improvements in the degree of efficiency of the automatic cross-wound bobbin winding machine.<br>
Further details of the invention can be derived from the following embodiment, explained on the basis of the<br><br>
5<br>
drawings.<br>
These show:<br>
Fig. 1 A winding device of a textile machine for manufacturing cross-wound bobbins (cheeses), during the "normal" winding process,<br>
Fig. 2 The winding device according to Fig. 1, at the start of a thread connection process, <br>
Fig. 3 A schematic representation of the actuation arrangement of the thread handling device's (suction nozzle, gripper tube),<br>
Fig. 4 To a larger scale, the drive device of the suction nozzle for taking up the upper thread.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a winding device 2 of a textile machine for the manufacture of cross-wound bobbins (cheeses) , designated overall by the reference number 1, in this embodiment an automatic cross-wound bobbin winding machine, shown during the winding operation.<br>
Such automatic cross-wound bobbin winding machines usually feature a large number of winding devices 2, of the same type. On these winding devices 2, the spinning cops 9 which are produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown) are rewound to form large-volume winding or take-up bobbins, referred to as cross-wound bobbins or cheeses 11. The finished cheeses 11 are rolled out onto a cheese transport device 21, by means of an automatically operating service device, and are then transported to a bobbin loading station or similar unit (not shown), arranged on the machine end side.<br><br>
6<br>
Such automatic cross-wound bobbin winding machines 1 as a rule also feature a logistics device in the form of a transport system 3 for bobbins and empty bobbin holders. On this bobbin and empty bobbin holder transport system 3 there circulate, on transport plates 8, spinning cops 9 or empty bobbin holders 20 respectively. Of this extensive transport system 3, Figures 1 and 2 show only the machine-length cop feed line 4, the reversing line 5 which runs behind the winding devices 2, one of the transverse transport lines 6 leading to the winding devices 2, and the empty bobbin holder return line 7.<br>
The spinning cops 9 which are delivered are rewound to form cross-wound bobbins or chesses 11 at the unwinding heads 10, which are located in the area of the transverse transport lines 6. The individual winding devices 2 in this situation are provided with a number -of different inherently-known devices, which guarantee the proper operation of these workplaces.<br>
In Figure 1, the thread is designated as 30, which runs from the spinning cop 9 to the cross-wound bobbin 11, a suction nozzle is designated as 12, a gripper rod as 22, a splicing device as 13, a thread tensioning device as 14, a thread cleaner with a thread cutting device as 15, and a paraffin application device as 16. The bobbin drive drum, which drives the cross-wound bobbin 11 by means of friction contact during the winding process in the direction of the arrow 23, bears the reference number 17. During the winding process, the cross-wound bobbin 11 is held in a creel 18, which is mounted so as to be capable of pivoting about an axis 19. Arranged above the creel 18, likewise capable of limited rotation about a pivot axis 19, is a hinged plate, via which the finished cross-wound bobbins 11 can be transferred onto the cross-wound bobbin transport device 21 arranged<br><br>
7<br>
behind the winding devices 2.<br>
As has already been indicated briefly earlier, the<br>
winding devices 2 are supplied by means of a service device, referred to as a cross-wound bobbin exchanger. This cross-wound bobbin exchanger ensures that cross-wound bobbins 11, which have reached a predetermined diameter, are carried out onto the cross-wound bobbin transport device 21, and that then, in. each case, an empty bobbin holder from an empty bobbin holder magazine is loaded into the creel 18 as a replacement.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the situation o a winding device 2 during an interruption to the winding. Such interruptions to winding may occur, for example, if the thread cleaner 15 has capped the running thread 30 due to a thread defect having been detected. In this case, the upper thread 34 runs onto the surface 48 of the cross-wound bobbin 11, -while the lower thread 33 is, as a rule, clamped in the thread clamp 14, and is held ready for the subsequent thread connection process.<br>
Figure 2 shows the moment at the start of the thread connection process.<br>
The suction nozzle 12 has already pivoted into its upper position and is attempting to take up the upper thread 34, which is lying on the surface 48 of the cross-wound bobbin 11. The cross-wound bobbin in this situation, as indicated by way of the arrow 24, is rotating against its winding-up direction.<br>
The gripper tube 22, which has taken up the lower thread 33 with the gripper tube flap (not shown) , is still in the waiting position as shown.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3, both the gripper tube 22 and the suction tube 12, are connected by operational link<br><br>
8<br>
elements, for preference cam levers 29 or 31 respectively, with the cam disks 27 or 28 respectively of a cam disk package 26, which is connected to a reversible electric drive unit 25. The reversible drive unit 25 in this situation is connected by means of a control line 32 to the winding head computer 39 of the winding device 2 concerned.<br>
Fig. 3 also shows that a sensor device 35, for preference an optical thread sensor, is integrated into the suction nozzle 12, which detects the presence of the start 48 of the upper thread 34, and which is likewise connected via a signal line 45 to the winding head computer 39.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment of the suction noz2le drive device. As is schematically represented, the reversible drive unit 25, connected to the winding head computer 39 by means of a control lead 32, drives a cam disk package, of which only the cam disk 27 is shown. In contact with the guide contour 44 of this cam disk 27 is the guide roller 4 3 of a cam lever 29, mounted so as to be capable of pivoting about the axis 42. The cam lever is provided on one side with a toothed segment 46, which engages with a corresponding toothed pinion 47 on the suction nozzle 12, which is mounted so as to rotate about a pivot axis 40.<br>
Function of the device:<br>
In the event that, during the normal winding process, which is represented in Fig, 1, an interruption to the winding occurs, because, for example, the thread is broken,, or because the thread cleaner 15 which is monitoring the running thread 30 identifies an impermissible thread defect, and has thereupon activated<br><br>
9<br>
its thread cutting device, the lower thread 33 is, as a<br>
rule, clamped in the thread clamper 14, and held there<br>
ready for the thread connection process which follows.<br>
The upper thread 34, which, in the event of a thread<br>
cut, also features the thread defect, runs by contrast<br>
onto the surface 48 of the take-up bobbin 11, which is<br>
raised by the drive roller 17 and braked to a<br>
standstill.	<br>
To take up the upper thread 34 which runs onto the surface 48 of the take-up bobbin 11, the suction nozzle 12 is pivoted out of the initial position indicated in Fig. 1, along the arc 36, into a position in which the suction nozzle mouth 38 is positioned in the area of the surface 48 of the take-up bobbin 11, which is slowly<br>
rotated in the unwinding direction 24. The suction<br><br>
nozzle 12 remains briefly (0.5 to 1 sec.) in this position, and then pivots back into its lower initial position, once the sensor device 35 integrated into the suction nozzle 12 has detected the thread start 49 which has been sucked up of the upper thread 34. The upper thread 34 in this situation is laid into the splicing device 13.<br>
The lower thread 33 is then likewise laid into the splicing device 13 by means of the gripper tube 22, which is capable of being subjected to pneumatic force. The gripper tube 22 in this situation pivots along the arc 37 out of its initial position into the thread insertion position represented as a dotted line in Fig. 2. The successful insertion of the lower thread 33 into the splicing device 13 can be monitored by means of a lower thread sensor (not shown).<br>
In the splicing device 13 the upper thread 34, after the elimination of any possible thread defect, is connected to the lower thread 33.<br><br>
10<br>
If the upper thread 34 cannot be taken up within a<br>
specified period of time by the suction nozzle 12, or<br>
cannot be properly taken up, and if accordingly no<br>
signal passes from the sensor device 35 to the winding<br>
head computer 39, the reversible drive unit 25 is<br>
actuated via the control lead 32 in such a way that the<br>
suction nozzle 12 carries out a nodding motion V, Z.<br>
This means that the drive unit 25 rotates the cam disk<br>
package 26 and therefore the cam disk 27 backwards and<br>
forwards, so that the cam lever 39, which is in contact<br>
with its guide roller 43 on the guide contour 44 of the<br>
cam disk 27, is moved backwards and forwards. This<br>
backwards and forwards movement of the cam ever 39 is<br>
transferred i the form of nodding movements V, Z onto<br>
the suction nozzle 12 .	<br>
By means of the nodding movements of the suction nozzle 12, and therefore also of the suction nozzle mouth 38, thread loops or similar defects can be drawn up, which otherwise might become jammed in the needle comb (not shown) , which is arranged in the area of the suction nozzle mouth 38, and the end 4 9 of the upper thread 34 is sucked into the suction nozzle 12 in the proper manner.<br><br>
