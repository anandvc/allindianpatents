				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to a process and a system for increasing the burning energy<br>
of a natural fuel gas upon burning the same for domestic or industrial purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are known a process and a device, as disclosed in the US patent 4238183,<br>
for increasing the efficiency of the natural fuel gas. The process comprises<br>
supplying the natural gas into an inlet chamber, at the bottom of a first housing,<br>
passing the natural gas through a plurality of holes grouped within several<br>
spaced arrays on a distributor plate in the inlet chamber into a magnet chamber<br>
having a plurality of sets of vertically arranged magnets, placed in front of the<br>
hole arrays, each of them producing a magnetic flux which acts on the natural<br>
gas in order to magnetically treat the natural gas passing through the sets of<br>
magnets, thereafter, the natural gas is discharged from the magnet chamber at<br>
its upper side, and an inlet chamber located at the bottom of the second housing<br>
is supplied with this gas, said inlet chamber is located downstream from the first<br>
housing, wherein the natural gas passes, through a plurality of holes grouped<br>
within several spaced arrays on a distributor plate in the second housing, into<br>
another magnet chamber in the second housing which has a plurality of sets of<br>
vertically arranged magnets placed in front of the holes arrays, each of them<br>
producing a magnetic flux which acts on the natural gas passing upwards<br>
through the sets of magnets, and which has undergone a magnetic field<br>
treatment in the first magnet chamber, in the end, the natural gas thus treated is<br>
supplied to a burner wherein the combustion of the gas takes place.<br><br><br>
The device for increasing the efficiency of the fuel consisting of a natural gas<br>
comprises a natural gas source, a first housing containing a first inlet chamber at<br>
the lower side of the said first housing, the said natural gas source<br>
communicating with the first inlet chamber for supplying natural gas thereto, a<br>
first magnet chamber in the first housing being located downstream from the<br>
first inlet chamber, said magnet chamber having a plurality of sets of vertically<br>
arranged magnets for applying a magnetic flux to the natural gas flowing<br>
upwards through the magnets, said first inlet chamber and the first magnet<br>
chamber being separated from each other by a distributor plate having a plurality<br>
of spaced holes extending in a plurality of spaced arrays for supplying the natural<br>
gas into the first magnet chamber, a second housing being located downstream<br>
from the first housing and having a second inlet chamber communicating with<br>
the first chamber wherein the sets of magnets in the first housing are placed, so<br>
that the natural gas thus treated be supplied into the second housing, a second<br>
magnet chamber in the second housing being located downstream from the<br>
second inlet chamber, a plurality of sets of vertically arranged magnets being in<br>
this magnet chamber for generating a magnetic flux which is applied to the<br>
treated natural gas passing upwards there through, the second inlet chamber<br>
and the second magnet chamber being separated from each other by means of a<br>
distributor plate provided with a plurality of holes grouped in a plurality of<br>
spaced arrays and extending on the entire plate surface for supplying the second<br>
magnet chamber with the treated natural gas flowing through the sets of<br>
magnets, the treated gas being discharged from the second magnet chamber<br>
and directed towards a burner located downstream from the second magnet<br>
chamber, for combusting the treated natural gas.<br><br><br>
The disadvantages of the process and the device consist in that each set of ring-<br>
shaped magnets generates a magnetic field producing an axial magnetic field<br>
resultant which determines a reduced action on the increase of the natural gas<br>
molecule energy, if the temperature of the natural gas passing through the sets<br>
of magnets is not correlated with the zero fluctuations of the vacuum, fact that<br>
determines the increase of the burning energy. As the gas energy increase is<br>
relatively low, several modules for the gas treatment in series have to be<br>
mounted, in order to ensure, under these circumstances, the correlation between<br>
the gas mass and the magnetic flux treating the natural gas.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The technical problem solved by this invention consists in ensuring some<br>
optimum conditions for increasing the burning energy of the natural fuel gas<br>
under the circumstances of an optimum correlation between the physical-<br>
chemical factors which achieve this increase of energy, namely, between the<br>
magnetic field action and the thermal field action upon the moving natural gas<br>
molecule.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, the process eliminates the disadvantages shown<br>
before in that it comprises the steps of supplying the natural gas, which natural<br>
gas can preferably be methane, through a treatment chamber confined by a<br>
cylindrical-shaped wall made up of a diamagnetic material, in front of which<br>
some electromagnetic units are placed in a spiral shape, of said electromagnetic<br>
units the terminal ones are diametrically opposed relatively to the longitudinal<br>
vertical axis of the chamber, thereby creating a rotating magnetic field which<br>
acts on the gas with only one polarity, under the circumstances in which a<br><br><br>
rotating thermal field created by the cores of the electromagnetic units<br>
maintained at a temperature in a range between 31s C and 65s C acts<br>
simultaneously on the gas, thereby an energy transfer being ensured, from the<br>
zero fluctuations of the vacuum towards the mass of natural gas passing<br>
upwards through the said chamber, before entering the chamber, the gas being<br>
pre-heated and having a temperature between 182 C ... 30e C and in the end,<br>
the gas thus treated is directed towards a burner.<br>
Within this process, the electromagnetic units can be supplied with electric power<br>
having the same intensity, if parallelly connected, or different intensities if<br>
serially connected, with decreasing values in the direction of the natural gas flow<br>
through the treatment chamber; situation in which the value of the magnetic<br>
field ranges between 0,1 and 0,8 T, each electromagnetic unit being maintained<br>
at the same temperature ranging between 31째 C and 65째 C.<br>
According to the invention, characteristic to the process is also the fact that the<br>
magnetic flux provided by the core of each electromagnetic unit has a value<br>
ranging between 0,03 W ... 0,228 W, irrespective of the connection in series or<br>
parallel of the electromagnetic units.<br>
System for increasing the burning energy produced by the natural fuel gas,<br>
based on the simultaneous action of a magnetic field and of a thermal field upon<br>
the gas, said installation according to the invention, wherein the process is<br>
applied, comprises a reactor equipped with some electromagnetic units arranged<br>
about a pipe made of diamagnetic material, each unit having a metal core placed<br>
inside an electric coil provided with some electrical connection ends, a heat<br>
exchange tank with the role of maintaining the electromagnetic unit at a<br>
constant temperature that defines the thermal field, the said core being in<br>
contact with the diamagnetic pipe, that forms a chamber wherethrough the<br><br><br>
natural gas circulates in order to be treated by the created fields, and the said<br>
electromagnetic units are arranged in spiral shape and disposed on stages, each<br>
having preferably three electromagnetic units, each electromagnetic unit within a<br>
stage being rotated relative to another corresponding electromagnetic unit within<br>
the previous stage, by an angle ranging from 70째 to 73째, so that between the<br>
first and the sixth stage there is performed a complete 360째 rotation, the said<br>
electromagnetic units being positioned by introducing them into some orifices of<br>
a thermally insulating support, so that the end electromagnetic units are<br>
disposed diametrically opposed in relation to the vertical longitudinal axis of the<br>
diamagnetic pipe, that results in both a rotating magnetic field with a single<br>
polarity, and in the rotating thermal field, both acting upon the gas, as well as of<br>
a heat circuit consisting of a tank for taking over the oil from heat exchange<br>
tanks, in this tank there being placed some electric resistors for heating, upon<br>
starting the installation, the oil that is circulated through the heat exchange<br>
tanks and is subsequently passed through a radiator for cooling the oil, the<br>
cooled oil from this tank being handled with a pump into the heat exchange<br>
tanks that are contained in the structure of the electromagnetic units of the<br>
reactor, and an electric panel, respectively, for supplying electric current to the<br>
electric coils and some conduits for the inlet and outlet of the natural gas<br>
into/from the chamber, the inlet conduit crossing the tank wherein the oil is<br>
heated.<br>
Another characteristic of the invention consists in the fact that, inside the heat<br>
exchange tank, the oil used as a thermal medium is introduced through a supply<br>
pipe and is taken over therefrom through a discharge pipe, said pipes having<br>
equal diameters, but the length of the supply pipe being longer than the length<br>
of the other pipe, the ratio between these lengths being in the range between 2<br><br><br>
and 2,5, all the heat exchange tanks being serially connected through the supply<br>
pipe of one unit and the discharge pipe of the following unit.<br>
Another characteristic of the invention consists in that the ratio between the<br>
diameter of the pipe passing through the reactor and the conduit for the natural<br>
gas supply connected therewith is between 3 and 6.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The system for increasing the burning energy produced by the natural gas<br>
comprises a reactor A and a heat circuit B. The heat circuit comprises a tank R<br>
for the oil used as a thermal medium which heats the natural gas, wherein there<br>
are placed a number of electric resistors, not shown in figures, for heating the<br>
oil, an oil cooler E; a pump P to push the oil, a circuit not shown in the figures<br>
for the transport of the oil from the tank R to a series of electromagnetic units 1<br>
in the reactor A. There is also an electric panel C for the electric power supply of<br>
the pump P, and several conduits D for the transport of the natural gas.<br>
The reactor A comprises the units 1, which are preferably 18 in number, being<br>
geometrically arranged three by three on a stage, situation in which each stage<br>
is rotated relatively to the previous stage by an angle of 72 degrees. The units 1<br>
are arranged inside a thermally insulating support 3, preferably made up of<br>
wood, each being positioned in one of the holes 4. Each unit 1 has a metal core<br>
6, whose surface is in direct contact with a vertical pipe 2 made up of a<br>
diamagnetic material, which confines a treatment chamber a.<br>
An electromagnetic unit 1 comprises a metal core 6, an electric coil 8 used as a<br>
source of generating a magnetic field. The coils 8 of the units 1 are power<br>
supplied through a number of connecting ends 11, preferably arranged on three<br>
rows, connected in parallel, to six coils 21 serially connected within the wiring<br>
diagram of the electric panel C. Each unit 1 is equipped with a heat exchange<br><br>
tank 7 having the role of maintaining the unit 1 at a constant temperature<br>
ranging between 31s C and 65s C. By maintaining the unit 1 at the working<br>
temperature, there is greatly increased the probability of connection between the<br>
magnetic field produced by the metal core 6 placed inside the coil 8, and the<br>
magnetic momentum of spin of the zero pairs. The oil used as a thermal medium<br>
flows inside the tank 7, being introduced thereinto through a supply pipe 9, and<br>
wherefrom it is taken over by a discharge pipe 10.<br><br><br>
The pipes 9 and 10 have equal diameters, but the pipe 9 is longer than the<br>
discharge pipe 10, the ratio between their lengths being of 2 - 2,5, so as to have a<br>
swirling flow of oil inside the tank 7, fact that leads to a uniform heating or cooling of the<br>
electromagnetic unit 1. The oil takes over the heat in excess or brings a heat uptake in<br>
the case of a temperature lower than the working temperature, such operations being<br>
necessary for maintaining the unit 1 at the working temperature. The pipe 9 of a unit 1 is<br>
connected to the pipe 10 of the following electromagnetic unit 1, in the succession of the<br>
18 units 1, thereby achieving the series connection of all 18 tanks 7, so that the oil<br>
pushed by the pump P could pass successively therethrough.<br>
The circuit B provides the heating of the oil through the heating resistors placed<br>
inside the tank R wherein the oil is stored. At the same time the cooling of the oil can also<br>
be carried out by its being passed through the oil radiator E. The pumping of the oil into<br>
the tanks 7 of the 18 units 1 is achieved by means of the pump P, which carry out both<br>
the oil supply of the electromagnetic units 1 and the transfer of the oil discharged<br>
therefrom.<br>
The oil transport circuit comprises some thermally insulated conduits which make<br>
the series connection of the tanks 7 in the 18 electromagnetic units 1 with the oil tank R<br>
by means of the pump P which carries out the oil flow in closed-circuit. The oil radiator E<br>
for cooling the oil is located within the oil transport circuit and is driven only when there is<br>
necessary to discharge the heat in excess, as a consequence of exceeding the working<br>
temperature.<br>
The electric panel C carries out the electric power supply by means of a rectifier<br>
20 which supplies, electric power at a required voltage for generating the magnetic field<br>
to all the 18 units 1. Also, the electric panel C provides the power supply of the electric<br>
resistors inside the tank R, as well as the power supply needed for driving a ventilating<br>
unit that the cooler E is equipped with, in order to cool the oil and to drive the pump P. In<br>
order to maintain the 18 electromagnetic units 1 at an established working temperature, a<br>
thermocouple 17 for the oil and a thermocouple 18 for the units 1 are provided, together<br>
with a number of relays 16 for driving the pump P supplied with<br>
-r<br><br>
electric power from the electric panel C From a central unit 14 there are actuated the<br>
power supply and the disconnection of the relays 15 and 16, of the thermocouples 17,<br>
18 and 19, and of the rectifier 20, in order to maintain the units 1 at the working<br>
temperature by correlating the values of the temperature parameters given by the<br>
thermocouple 17 for the oil and by the thermocouple 18 set in each electromagnetic<br>
unit 1. The central unit 14 also controls the power supply of the electric resistors in the<br>
tank R and the pump P when the temperature of the electromagnetic units 1 is lower<br>
than the temperature needed for the reactor A. Through these controls, the oil is heated<br>
in the tank R by means of the electric resistors, and circulated through the heat circuit<br>
by means of the pump P, thereby getting into the tanks 7 of the units 1, fact that leads<br>
to the heating of the metal core 6, which thus reaches the optimum temperature<br>
needed for the connection with the zero fluctuations of the vacuum for increasing the<br>
burning energy released upon the combustion of the gas treated in the reactor A. The<br><br>
central unit 14 also controls the cooling of the units 1 by ceasing the power supply of<br>
the electric resistors when the thermocouple 18 records a higher temperature than the<br>
temperature needed in the reactor A. By flowing the oil inside the cooler E and by<br>
starting-up the cooling ventilating unit, the oil is cooled, releasing the heat in excess<br>
taken over from the units 1 through the heat exchange tanks 7, outside the reactor A.<br>
Thus, the units 1 are cooled and their temperature is lowered up to reaching the<br>
working temperature of the reactor A, when the zero vacuum energy can be extracted<br>
for increasing the burning energy produced by the natural gas flowing through the<br>
reactor A. The heating and the cooling of the electromagnetic unit 1 is achieved in an<br>
optimum time interval when the heated or cooled oil, as the case may be, is introduced<br>
into each tank 7 through the pipe 9 and is discharged through the pipe 10, thereby<br>
achieving a swirling flow without high temperature gradients inside the electromagnetic<br>
unit 1.	<br>
In the situation when the electromagnetic units 1 are supplied with electric power<br>
having the same or different intensities according to their being connected in series or<br>
in parallel, the decreasing values of the magnetic field can be ensured, in the flowing<br><br><br>
direction of the natural gas through the treatment chamber confined within the pipe 2, in<br>
said situation, the value of the magnetic field being between 0,1 ... 0,8 T, each<br>
electromagnetic unit being maintained at the same temperature ranging between 31째 C<br>
...65째C.<br>
In this situation, the magnetic flux is ensured by the core 6 of each<br>
electromagnetic unit 1, which has a value ranging between 0,030 ... 0,228 Wb,<br>
irrespective of the connections in series or in parallel of the electromagnetic units 1 .<br>
The series or parallel connections of the electromagnetic units 1 should preferably<br>
be carried out in series in hot weather (in summer, respectively), and in parallel in cold<br>
weather (in winter, respectively).<br>
The coil 8 provides, by means of the core 6, a continuous magnetic field outside<br>
thereof.<br>
This field is necessary for the operation of the electromagnetic unit 1 in order to<br>
balance, in the area adjacent to the diamagnetic pipe 2, the magnetic momentum of the<br>
zero pairs occurring upon the vacuum fluctuation. By providing the connection between<br>
the magnetic field of the electromagnetic unit 1 maintained at the working temperature of<br>
the reactor A, and the magnetic momentum of the zero vacuum pairs, there becomes<br>
possible the extraction of energy which is added to the energy of the natural gas<br>
molecule passing through the pipe 2.<br>
The natural gas path consists of a conduit D for the inlet of the gas, said conduit<br>
crosses the oil tank R, which makes a pre-heating of the natural gas, the pipe 2 passes<br>
axially through the reactor A, crossing a hole 5 cut in the support 3 for the<br>
electromagnetic units 1. The pipe 2 carries out the natural gas exposure to the physical<br>
action of the rotating magnetic and thermal fields of the electromagnetic units 1, is in<br>
direct contact with the ends of the metal cores 6 and is connected to the conduit D for the<br>
inlet of the gas in order to be pre-heated, through a supply connection 12. A connection<br>
13 for the outlet of the natural gas achieves the connection between the diamagnetic<br>
pipe 2 and the conduit D for the outlet of the natural gas towards some natural gas<br>
burners not shown in figures.<br>
For example, upon the combustion of the natural gas, there are obtained about<br><br><br>
8125 Kcal/m3 -heat in the conditions of an optimum air-gas mixture. By the extraction<br>
of a part of the zero vacuum energy in the reactor A, the heat obtained from the<br>
combustion can be increased up to 11375 Kcal/m3, this increase implicitly leading to the<br>
reducing of the gas consumption.<br>
Due to the fact that the zero fluctuations of vacuum take place in a medium with a<br>
controlled constant thermal gradient, they have a duration tending towards the maximum<br>
possible duration, so that, within the vacuum, the existence of the particle-antiparticle<br>
pairs leads to the occurrence of a metric fluctuation to the effect that the distance<br>
between two points oscillates about a maximum external average value.<br>
The occurrence and the disappearing of the particle-antiparticle pairs lead to<br>
space oscillations. Because of this fact, there exists a metrics fluctuation at the quantum<br>
level of the space, to the effect that the distance between two points oscillates about an<br>
average value. According to the Heisenberg principle, these fluctuations have an<br>
extremely short existence.<br>
Within an atom having energy levels very well-established by the quantum<br>
mechanics formalism, the displacements of the energy levels of the electrons in the atom<br>
due to the zero fluctuation of the vacuum are emphasized by the Lamb effect.<br>
Formally, the fluctuation of the spatial metrics modifies the eigen values of the<br>
energy levels for the layers of electrons within the atoms, the Srodinger equation having<br>
in this case a dynamic aspect. These changes within the energy spectrum of the<br>
electrons inside the atoms last for an extremely short period of time, according to the life<br>
time of the zero fluctuations of the vacuum, the possible energy in excess released within<br>
an exothermal chemical reaction being imperceptible. LAMB SHIFT &amp; VACUUM<br>

The electromagnetic units 1 produce a polarization of the zero vacuum pairs. The<br>
particle-antiparticle pairs occurring in vacuum according to the Heisenberg<br><br><br><br>
principle, have magnetic momentum of spin. By means of the action of the<br>
magnetic field produced, the electromagnetic units 1 cause the spin of these<br>
particle-antiparticle pairs to remain blocked in a spatial region coinciding with the<br>
diamagnetic pipe 2 wherethrough the natural gas passes. The heating of the<br>
electromagnetic units 1 to the working temperature leads to achieving a powerful<br>
connection between the magnetic field of the electromagnetic units 1 and the<br>
spin of the zero pairs which occur within the vacuum fluctuations. By increasing<br>
the life time of the zero pairs in the conditions of maintaining a constant value of<br>
the temperature gradient, the metrics of the space is stabilized for a relatively<br>
long period of time, sufficient for the atoms comprised in the natural gas<br>
composition to modify their own levels of energy upon their passing through this<br>
zone. The natural gas molecule includes this energy in excess caused by the<br>
modification of the metrics inside the reactor A and carries the same onto the<br>
path inside the pipe 2, this energy in excess being released within the chemical<br>
reactions of combusting the natural gas.<br>
While applying the process within the system of the invention, in compliance<br>
with the relation (1), the energy balance is met by the conservation of the total<br>
energy during the operation of the installation:<br>
Q (+) = E (vacuum) - B (u.e.m.) - e. (1) where:<br>
Q(+) is the supplementary energy obtained relatively to the classical reaction of<br>
oxidizing the natural gas;<br>
E (vacuum) - the energy consumed for making the vacuum to fluctuate. This<br>
energy is spent at a cosmic scale;<br><br>
B (u.e.m.) - the electric power consumed for obtaining the magnetic field within<br>
the electromagnetic units of the reactor;<br>
e - the energy used by the system for other operations: cooling the oil, heating<br>
the oil, setting the oil pump into operation and the like. The ratio between the<br>
supplementary caloric energy obtained and the electric power consumed by the<br>
reactor is given by the relation (2).<br><br>
consumed by the reactor is given by the relation (2)<br><br>
An increase of the gas burning energy takes place in the reactor A, by the action<br>
of the 18 electromagnetic units 1 which are maintained during their operation at a<br>
certain working temperature. The natural gas is introduced into the installation through<br>
the gas conduit at a pressure within 2,5 ... 3,5 bar, the conduit crosses the tank R,<br>
thereby achieving a pre-heating of the tank to the working temperature of the reactor A,<br>
thereafter it undergoes an expansion within the diamagnetic pipe 2. The ratio between<br>
the diameter of the pipe 2 passing through the reactor A and the conduit D connected<br>
therewith for the natural gas supply ranges between 3 ... 6. The natural gas slows down<br>
its transport speed inside the diamagnetic pipe 2, remaining for 1-2 seconds under the<br>
action of the 18 electromagnetic units 1 which determine the modification of the<br>
quantum energy levels of the molecules. The electromagnetic units 1 are brought to the<br>
working temperature through the action of the heated oil passing through the tanks 7<br>
and carry out the energetic addition within the gas molecule by freezing the space<br>
metrics at a quantum level and extracting the zero vacuum energy. After the gas gets<br>
out of the diamagnetic pipe 2, it is handled towards the burners, where the caloric<br>
excess caused by the extraction of a part of the zero energy of the vacuum is pointed<br>
out. By increasing the caloric power, the new quantity of gas to be burnt is smaller than<br>
in the situation when the natural gas does not include a part of the zero energy of the<br>
vacuum that is extracted in the reactor A.<br>
Thereby, the invention ensures an important economy of natural gas, leading to<br>
the substantial reduction of the energy expenses. The invention is liable of being<br>
standardized to the effect that it can be sized for any natural gas flow rate chosen for<br>
the technological heating processes. The gases resulting from the process of<br>
combusting the natural gas, when this is processed from a quantum point of view within<br>
the installation, have a small carbon monoxide content as compared to the usual<br>
processes of combustion in thermochemistry.<br><br>
 The installation for increasing the caloric power of the natural gas employs the<br>
electric power to operate, consequently,it is not etectromagnetically polluting, it does not<br>
release noxious substances into the environment, it is carried out by using usual<br>
materials, it is secure and easy to use and to maintain. The ratio between the electric<br>
power consumed for operating the reactor A and the supplementary energy extracted<br>
from the zero fluctuations of the vacuum is 1/24. The large-scale application of the<br>
installation can lead to lowering the heating expenses for the population during the<br>
winter, fact that, from a social viewpoint, can be a real advantage. Its application in<br>
industry can lead to sensitive reductions of the energy expenses for the energy-<br>
consuming production sectors and implicitly to the reduction in price of certain products<br>
destined to the market.<br><br>
