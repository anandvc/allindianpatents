				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 2-aryl propionic acids. Particularly, this invention relates to the improved process for conversion of arylalkyl halides having the general formula I wherein, RI may be aryl, substituted aryl, naphthyl or substituted naphthyl, R2, RS, R4 and R5 may independently be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents and X may be any of the halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, iodine, to the corresponding 2-aryl propionic acids using a homogeneous palladium catalyst system.<br>
A majority of the 2-aryl propionic acids are well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Ibuprofen and Naproxen being two important examples. The conventional synthesis of ibuprofen involves six steps which use hazardous chemicals like cyanides and the waste materials produced require lot of down stream treatments for disposal. Recently, Hoechst Celanese Corporation has developed a novel environmentally benign three step catalytic process for the synthesis of ibuprofen, in which carbonylation of para isobutylphenyl ethanol (p-IBPE) is the key step. In the processes described in patented literature (EP 0,400,892A3, EP 0,284,310A1), the catalysts used were mainly Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 or PdCli or Pd (OAc)2 along with excess phosphine ligands in a biphasic system consisting of 10% aqueous HC1 as the promoter and p-IBPE dissolved in a solvent as the organic phase. The main drawback of this process is the lower reaction rates (TOP = 25-35 h-1) and lower selectivity to ibuprofen (56-69%) under mild conditions (130°C, lOOOpsig). Higher<br>
selectivity (&gt;95 %) was obtained only at very high pressures of 2000 to 4500 psig of carbon monoxide and the rates still remained low. US patent 5,536,874 and the publication J. Chem. Tech. Biotecnol, 1997, 70, 83-91, describes the carbonylation of p-lBPE in a two-phase system wherein one phase is an aqueous medium which contains a water soluble palladium complex and an acid promoter. These processes also have disadvantages such as low reaction rates (TOF= 0.1 to 0.4 h-1) and lower ibuprofen selectivity (59-74%) under mild reaction conditions (90°C, 450 to 900 psig). The patents EP 0 338 852 and US 5 055 611, describes preparation of 2-arylpropionic acids by the carbonylation of aryl alkyl halides using PdCl2(PPh3)2 as the catalyst precursor along with 5% aq. HC1 as the promoter. In these cases also lower reaction rate and lower ibuprofen selectivity were achieved.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have observed that the use of a new homogeneous catalyst system comprising of a palladium compound, an organic acid and a halide promoters provide an improved catalyst system for the carbonylation of arylalkyl halides of general formula I to the corresponding 2-arylpropionic acids. The use of such a catalyst system gives high reaction rates and high selectivity to 2-arylpropionic acids under mild reaction conditions.<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 2-aryl propionic acids by the carbonylation of corresponding arylalkyl halides.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of 2-aryl propionic acids which comprises carbonylating an arylalkyl halide having the general formula I of the drawing accompanying the specification , wherein R1 is aryl, substituted aryl, naphthyl or substituted naphthyl, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or cycloaliphatic with or without substituents and X is any of the halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine, iodine, a halide salts of the alkali metals an organic sulfonic acid, water and the catalyst, containing palladium compound in an organic solvent selected from ketones, cyclic ethers in the carbon monoxide atmosphere under homogeneous conditions, at a temperature ranging between 30 to 130°C, for a period ranging between 0.3 to 4 hours, at pressures ranging between 50 to 1500 psig, cooling the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, flushing the reaction vessel with inert gas, removing the solvent by conventional methods, separating the catalyst and isolating 2-aryl propionic acid of formula II of the drawing accompanying the specification wherein, RI is aryl, substituted aryl, naphthyl or substituted naphthyl, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloaliphatic with or without substituents.<br>
