				<td>VAPOR PHASE SILOXANE DRY CLEANING PROCESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention is directed to a dry cleaning process, more<br>
specifically/ to a siloxane vapor phase based process, for use in dry cleaning.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Current dry cleaning technology uses perchloroethylene ("PERC) or<br>
petroleum-based materials as the cleaning solvent PERC suffers from<br>
toxicity and odor issues. The petroleum-based products are not as effective as<br>
PERC in cleaning garments.<br>
Cyclic siloxanes have been reported as spot cleaning solutions, see US<br>
4,685,930, and as dry cleaning fluids in dry cleaning machines, see US<br>
5/942,007. Other patents disclose the use of silicone soaps in petroleum<br>
solvents, see JP 09299687, and the use of silicone surfactants in super critical<br>
carbon dioxide solutions has been reported, see, for example, US 5,676,705<br>
and Chem. Mark. Rep., 15 Dec 1997,252(24), p. 15. Non-volatile silicone oils<br>
have also been used as the cleaning solvent requiring removal by a second<br>
washing with perfluoroalkane to remove the silicone oil, see JP 06327888.<br>
Numerous other patents have issued in which siloxanes or<br>
organomodified silicones have been present as addenda in PERC or<br>
petroleum based dry cleaning solvents/ see, for example, WO 9401510; US<br>
4911853; US 4005231; US 4065258.<br>
There is a continued interest in decreasing the need for large quantities<br>
of solvents used in dry cleaning processes.<br>

The process of the invention involves generation of a gas phase silicone<br>
by a combination of heating the silicone in a solvent reservoir and optionally<br>
reducing pressure so as to allow the silicone to vaporize followed by<br>
contacting the silicone vapors with the garment to be cleaned. While the<br>
formula describing compounds useful in the process of the present invention<br>
has already been described, those compounds useful in the practice of the<br>
present invention in one embodiment should have vapor pressures between<br>
about 3.0 mm Hg and about 760 mm Hg at temperatures ranging from about<br>
20 °C to about 100 °C In a second embodiment those compounds useful in<br>
the practice of the present invention should have vapor pressures between<br>
about 0.01 mm Hg and about 760 mm Hg at temperatures ranging from<br>
about 20 °C to about 270 °C. In a third embodiment those compounds<br>
useful in the practice of the present invention should have vapor pressures<br>
between about 1.0 mm Hg and about 760 mm Hg at temperatures ranging<br>
from about 20 °C to about 134 °C. In a fourth embodiment those<br>
compounds useful in the practice of the present invention should have vapor<br>
pressures between about 0.01 mm Hg and about 760 mm Hg at temperatures<br>

Alternatively, other methods known in the art can be employed to<br>
form vapors of silicones including mechanical means.<br>
The vapors of the compounds of the present invention thus formed,<br>
either at atmospheric pressure or at reduced pressure, are allowed to contact<br>
the fabric to be cleaned for a specified time wherein these same vapors<br>
condense in the fabric, dissolving the soiling material or stain and draining<br>
away from the fabric, after which time the articles are removed, cooled as<br>
needed, and dried by various methods known in the art such as air drying,<br>
heated drying and the like. In one embodiment, the process of the present<br>
invention may be performed at a constant pressure. In another embodiment<br>
the process of the present invention is performed at a pressure that is varied<br>
among the steps of the process, e.g. initially contacting the garment to be<br>
cleaned with a vapor at a pressure below atmospheric followed by raising the<br>
pressure to atmospheric pressure to condense the vapor in the garment and<br>
allow the cleaning fluids to drain away from the garment.<br>
Alternatively/ the articles remain in the cleaning vessel and the silicone<br>
or silicone containing solvent is removed by various means and the articles<br>
are dried in the cleaning vessel as is commonly seen in typical dry cleaning<br>
machines.<br>
An article, such as far example/ a textile or leather article/ typically/ a<br>
garment, is cleaned by contacting the article with the vapors of the<br>
composition of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the articles<br>
to be cleaned include textiles made from natural fibers, such as for example,<br>
cotton, wool, linen and hemp, from synthetic fibers, such as, for example,<br>
polyester fibers, poly amide fibers, polypropylene fibers and elastomeric<br>
fibers, from blends of natural and synthetic fibers, from natural or synthetic<br>
leather or natural or synthetic fur.<br>
The article and dry cleaning composition are then separated, by, for<br>
example, one or more of draining and centrifugatioa In a preferred<br>
embodiment, separation of the article and dry cleaning composition is<br>
followed by the application of heat, preferably, heating to a temperature of<br>
from 15°C to 120°C, preferably from 20°C to 100°C, or reduced pressure,<br>
preferably/ a pressure of from 1 mm Hg to 750 mm Hg, or by application of<br>
both heat and reduced pressure, to the article.<br>
Testing for oil soluble stain removal was accomplished using a blue<br>
50/50 cotton/poly cloth and a red satin fabric. The approximately 2 inch<br>
square samples were stained with motor oil, suspended by wires in a large<br>
glass vessel equipped with a thermometer, and condensing unit capable of<br>
condensing the volatile silicone solvent The articles were positioned such that<br>
the solvent vapors saturated the article but were not contacted by the<br>
returning, condensed solvent<br>
The process of the present invention is not limited to the cleaning of<br>
garments or articles of clothing, it may be applied to any article of<br>
manufacture contaminated with a silicone soluble contaminant that may be<br>
subjected to the process of the present invention wherein the contaminant is<br>
dissolved in the silicone compound and drained away, thereby removing the<br>
contaminant from the article of manufacture.<br>
The following examples are to illustrate the invention and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the claims.<br>
Example 1 - Atmospheric pressure, cyclic solvent<br>
Samples of red satin and blue cotton/poly fabrics were treated with<br>
motor oil which was allowed to stain for 18 hours then attached to a wire<br>
holder and suspended above a reservoir of D5. The solvent was heated to<br>
boiling and the vapors allowed to contact the stained fabrics for 5 minutes.<br>
After this time, the heat was removed, the vessel cooled and the samples<br>
removed and air dried and evaluated. All traces of the oil were removed from<br>
both fabrics. There was some extraction of the red dye from the satin fabric.<br>
Example 2 - Reduced Pressure, cyclic solvent<br>
Samples of red satin and blue cotton/poly fabrics were treated with<br>
motor oil which was allowed to stain for 18 hours then attached to a wire<br>
holder and suspended above a reservoir of D5. The pressure in the system<br>
was reduced to 1-2 mm Hg and the temperature of the solvent reservoir was<br>
raised to 70-80 °G The vapors were allowed to contact the stained fabrics for 5<br>
minutes. After this time, the heat was removed/ the vessel cooled and the<br>
samples removed and air dried and evaluated. All traces of the oil were<br>
removed from both fabrics. No extraction of the red dye from the satin fabric<br>
was observed.<br>
Example 3 - Reduced Pressure, linear solvent<br>
Samples of red satin and blue cotton/poly fabrics were treated with<br>
motor oil which was allowed to stain for 18 hours then attached to a wire<br>
holder and suspended above a reservoir of MD2M. The pressure in the<br>
system was reduced to 1-2 mm Hg and the temperature of the solvent<br>
reservoir was raised to 70-80 °C The vapors were allowed to contact the<br>
stained fabrics for 5 minutes. After this time, the heat was removed, the vessel<br>
cooled and the samples removed and air dried and evaluated. All traces of the<br>
oil were removed from both fabrics. No extraction of the red dye from the<br>
satin fabric was observed.<br>
