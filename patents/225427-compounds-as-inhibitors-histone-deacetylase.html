				<td>ACETYLENE DERIVATIVES AS INIHDITORS OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE<br>
COMPOUNDS AS INHIBITORS HISTONE DEACETYLASE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to certain acetylene derivatives that are inhibitors of<br>
histone deacetylase and are therefore useful in the treatment of diseases associated with histone<br>
deacetylase activity. Pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing these<br>
compounds are also disclosed.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Interest in histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) as targets for pharmaceutical<br>
development has centered on the role of HDACs in regulating genes associated with cell-cycle<br>
progression and the development and progression of cancer (reviewed in Kramer et. ah Trends<br>
Endocrinol. Metab. 12,294-300, (2001)). Several studies have shown that treatment of various<br>
cell lines with HDAC inhibitors leads to hyper acerylation of histone proteins and cell-cycle<br>
arrest in late G1 phase or at the G2/M transition. Genes involved in the cell cycle that have<br>
been shown to be up regulated by HDAC inhibitors include p21, p27, p53 and cyclin E. Cyclin<br>
A and cyclin D have been reported to be down regulated by HDAC inhibitors. In tumor cell<br>
lines, several studies have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors can lead to growth<br>
inhibition, growth arrest, terminal differentiation and/or apoptosis. In vivo studies have<br>
demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of<br>
treatment with HDAC inhibitors.<br>
The clearest link between abnormal HDAC activity and cancer occurs in acute<br>
promyelocytic leukemia. In this condition, a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of<br>
the retinoic acid receptor RARa with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) or promyelocytic<br>
leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) proteins. Both PML-RARa and PLZF-RARa promote the<br>
progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acid-regulated genes through the abnormal<br>
recruitment of SMRT-mSin3-HDAC complex (Lin et. ah Nature 391, 811-814 (1998));<br>
Grignani et al. Nature 391, 815-818 (1998)). Whereas the PML-RARa form of the disease is<br>
treatable with retinoic acid, the PLZF-RARa form is resistant to this treatment. For a patient<br>
with the retinoic acid-resistant form of the disease, the addition of the HDAC inhibitor sodium<br>
butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission (Warrell et al.<br>
J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 90,1621-1625, (1998)). HDACs have also been associated with<br>
Huntington's disease (Steffan, et al., Nature 413:739-744, "Histone deacetylase inhibitors<br>
arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila").<br>
In summary, an increase in HDAC activity contributes to the pathology and/or<br>
symptomatology of a number of diseases. Accordingly, molecules that inhibit the activity of<br>
HDAC are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such diseases.<br>

The present invention also includes the prodrugs of compounds of Formula (I). The<br>
term prodrug is intended to represent covalently bonded carriers, which are capable of<br>
releasing the active ingredient of Formula (I) when the prodrug is administered to a<br>
mammalian subject. Release of the active ingredient occurs in vivo. Prodrugs can be prepared<br>
by techniques known to one skilled in the art. These techniques generally modify appropriate<br>
functional groups in a given compound. These modified functional groups however regenerate<br>
original functional groups by routine manipulation or in vivo. Prodrugs of compounds of<br>
Formula (I) include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amidino, guanidino, amino, carboxylic, or<br>
a similar group is modified. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to esters (e.g.,<br>
acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives), carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl) of<br>
hydroxy or amino functional groups in compounds of Formula (1)), amides (e.g,<br>
trifluoroacetylamino, acetylamino, and the like), and the like. Prodrugs of compounds of<br>
Formula (I) are also within the scope of this invention.<br>
The present invention also includes N-oxide derivatives and protected derivatives of<br>
compounds of Formula (I). For example, when compounds of Formula (T) contain an<br>
oxidizable nitrogen atom, the nitrogen atom can be converted to an N-oxide by methods well<br>
known in the art. Also when compounds of Formula (I) contain groups such as hydroxy,<br>
carboxy, thiol or any group containing a nitrogen atom(s), these groups can be protected with a<br>
suitable protecting groups. A comprehensive list of suitable protective groups can be found in<br>
T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The protected derivatives<br>
of compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by methods well known in the art<br>

Compounds of this invention can be made by the methods depicted in the reaction<br>
scheme shown below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds are either<br>
available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co., (Milwaukee, Wis.),<br>
Bachem (Torrance, Calif.), or Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.) or are prepared by methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's<br>
Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); Rodd's<br>
Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5 and Supplemental (Elsevier Science<br>
Publishers, 1989); Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), March's<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry, (John Wiley and Sons, 4th Edition) and Larock's<br><br>
Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers lac, 1989). These schemes are<br>
merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of this invention can be<br>
synthesized, and various modifications to these schemes can be made and will be suggested to<br>
one skilled in the art having referred to this disclosure.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the reaction may be isolated and purified<br>
if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to filtration, distillation,<br>
crystallization, chromatography and the like. Such materials may be characterized using<br>
conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein take place at<br>
atmospheric pressure over a temperature range from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more<br>
preferably from about 0 °C to about 125 °C and most preferably at about room (or ambient)<br>
temperature, e.g., about 20 °C.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) where Z is -CONR3-, -SO2NR5-, -NR7CONR8-,<br>
-NR9SO2NR10-, or -OCONR11- and other groups are as defined in the Summary of the<br>
Invention can be prepared by the procedure illustrated and described in Scheme A below.<br>
Reaction of an alkyne of formula 1 (where PG is a suitable amino protecting group and<br>
PG1 is hydrogen or a suitable amino protecting group such as tert-butoxycarbonyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like, more preferably tert-butoxycarbonyl), with a compound of<br>
formula 2 (where R is alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl and the halo group is preferably iodo),<br>
provides a compound of formula 3. The reaction is carried out in a suitable organic solvent<br>
such as dimethylformamide and in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine, and<br>
the like and a suitable catalyst such as PdCl2(Ph3P)2, and the like.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 can be prepared from commercially available starting<br>
materials by methods well known in the art. For example, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-<br>
propargylamine can be prepared by reacting commercially available propargylamine with tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine,<br>
ethylisopropylamine, and the like. Compounds of formula 1 can also be prepared from N-<br>
protected amino acids by first reducing the acid group to give the corresponding aldehyde by<br>
methods well known in the art and then reacting the aldehyde with Ohira reagent (see Ohira, S.<br>
Synth Common., 19,561-564, (1989)) to give a compound of formula 1. A detailed synthesis<br>
of a compound of formula 1 where X and Y are bond, R1 and R2 are methyl, and PG is tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl and PG1 is hydrogen from 2-aminoisobutyric acid by the above method is<br>
provided in working Example 3 below. Amino acids suitable for preparing compounds of<br>
formula 1 are commercially available. For example, 1-amino-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid,<br>
homoalanine, aspartic acid, gamma-n-butyric acid, 3-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid, 4-amino-<br>
2,2-dimethyl butyric acid, piperidine-3-carboxylic acid, 4-aminopiperidine-4-carboxylic acid,<br>
4-amino-4-carboxytetrahydropyran, 2-aminocyclopentaneacetic acid, and 2-amino-1-<br>
cyclopentanecarboxylic acid are commercially available. Alpha and beta amino acids can also<br>
be prepared by methods described in Duthaler, R. O. Tetrahedron, 50,1539-1650 (1994) and<br>
Cole, D. C. Tetrahedron, 50,9517-9582, (1994), the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Compounds of formula 1 where PG1 is an amino protecting group can also be prepared<br>
from commercially available alcohols under Mitsunobu reaction conditions. A detailed<br>
description of the synthesis of a compound of formula 1 by this procedure is provided in<br>
working Example 2 below.<br>
Removal of the amino-protecing group provides a compound of formula 4. The<br>
reaction conditions employed depend on the nature of the protecting group. For example, if<br>
the amino-protecting group is tert-butoxycarbonyl, it is removed by treating a compound of<br>
formula 3 with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like, in a suitable<br>
organic solvent such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, dichloromethane, and the like.<br>
Compounds of formula 2 are either commercially available or they can be prepared by<br>
methods well known in the art. For example, methyl 4-iodobenzoate is commercially<br>
available. 4-Iodo-2-thiophenecarboxylic methyl ester can be prepared from commercially<br>
available 4-iodo-2-thiophenecarboxylic acid under standard esterification reaction conditions.<br>
Compound 4 is then then converted to a compound of formula 5 where Z is -CONR3-,<br>
-SO2NR5-, -NR'CONR8-, -NR9SO2NR10-, or -OCONR11 - by methods well known in the art.<br>
Some such methods are described below.<br>
(a) A compound of formula 5 where Z is -CONH- or -SO2NH- is prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula 4 with an acylating or sulfoylating agent of formula Ar2COL or Ar2SO2L<br>
respectively, where L is a leaving group under acylating or sulfonylating reaction conditions<br>
such as halo (particularly chloro or bromo). Suitable for solvents for the reaction include<br>
organic solvents such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, and<br>
the like. The reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic base such as triethyamine,<br>
pyridine, and the like. Acylating or sulfonylatmg agent of formula Ar2COL or Ar2SO2L are<br>
either commercially available or they can be readily prepared by methods well known in the<br>
art. For example, Ar2COL can be prepared by reacting the corresponding acids with a<br>
halogenating agent such as oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of Formula (I) when Z is -CONH- can be prepared by<br>
heating 4 with an acid anhydride. Suitable solvents for the reaction are tetrahydrofuran,<br>
dioxane, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of Formula (I) when Z is -CONH- can be prepared by<br>
reacting an acid of formula Ar2-COOH in the presence of a suitable coupling agent<br>
e.g., benzotriazole-1-yloxytrispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP®),<br>
O-benzotriazol-1 -yl-N,N,N,NAr-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU),<br>
1-(3-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU),<br>
1-(3-dimeftylaminopropyl)-3-emylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC•HCl), or<br>
1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
hydrate (HOBt•H2O), and a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, N-<br>
methylmorpholine, and the like. The reaction is typically carried out at 20 to 30 °C, preferably<br>
at about 25 °C, and requires 2 to 24 h to complete. Suitable reaction solvents are inert organic<br>
solvents such as halogenated organic solvents (e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, and the<br>
like), acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and<br>
the like. Acids of formula Ar2-COOH such as benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, phenylacetic acid,<br>
nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, and benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid are commercially available.<br>
Others such as 3-phenoxymethylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid can be readily prepared from<br>
commercially available 3-methylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid by first converting it to 2-<br>
bromomethylbenzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (brominating it with N-bromosuccinimide under<br>
conditions well known in the art) followed by reacting with phenol.<br>
(b) A compound of formula 5 where Z is -NR7CONH- is prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula 4 with an activating agent such as carbonyl diimidazole, followed by<br>
displacement of the imidazole group with a primary or secondary amine of formula Ar2NHR7.<br>
Suitable reaction solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula 5 where Z is -NR7CONH- is prepared by<br>
reacting compound 4 with a carbamoyl halide of formula Ar2NR7COL or an isocyanate of<br>
formula Ar2N=C=O) under conditions well known in the art.<br>
(c) A compound of formula 5 where Z is -NR9SO2NH- is prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula 4 with a sulfamoyl halide of formula Ar2NR9SO2L under reaction<br>
conditions described in method (a) above. Sulfamoyl halides are either commercially available<br>
or may be prepared by methods such as thos described in Graf, R., German Patent 931225 and<br>
Catt, J. D. and Matler, W. L., J. Org, Chem., 1974, 39,577-568.<br>
(d) A compound of formula 5 where Z is -OC(O)NH- is prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula 4 with acylating agent of formula Ar2OC(O)L under reaction conditions<br>
described above.<br>
Compound 5 is then converted to a compound of Formula (I) by reacting it with<br>
aqueous hydroxylamine in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide and a mixture of<br>
organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and methanol.<br>
A compound of Formula (I) can be converted to other compounds of Formula (I). For<br>
example, a compound of Formula (I) where any of R3-R-11 is alkyl can also be prepared by<br>
reacting a corresponding compound of Formula (I) where any of R3-R-11 is hydrogen with an<br>
alkylating agent under conditions well known in the art. Other methods of preparing<br>
compounds of formula (I) from compound 5 are analogous to the methods disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 5,998,412 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) where Z is -NR12COO- can be prepared by following the<br>
procedures described above, by using starting materials such as 3-butyn-2-ol, 3-butyn-1-ol and<br>
4-pentyn-2-ol.<br>

Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
In general, the compounds of this invention will be administered in a therapeutically<br>
effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar<br>
utilities. The actual amount of the compound of this invention, i.e., the active ingredient, will<br>
depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and<br>
relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of<br>
administration, and other factors.<br>
Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of Formula (I) may range from<br>
approximately 0.1-50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day; preferably about<br>
0.5-20 mg/kg/day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would most<br>
preferably be about 35 mg to 1.4 g per day.<br>
In general, compounds of this invention will be administered as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions by any one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or<br>
by suppository), or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous)<br>
administration. The preferred manner of administration is oral or parenteral using a convenient<br>
daily dosage regimen, which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Oral<br>
compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained<br>
release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate<br>
compositions.<br>
The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drag<br>
administration (e.g., for oral administration, formulations in the form of tablets, pills or<br>
capsules are preferred) and the bioavailability of the drug substance. Recently, pharmaceutical<br>
formulations have been developed especially for drugs that show poor bioavailability based<br>
upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area i.e.,<br>
decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,107,288 describes a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which the active material<br>
is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,684 describes the<br><br>
production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug substance is pulverized to<br>
nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a surface modifier and then<br>
dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation that exhibits remarkably<br>
high bioavailability.<br>
The compositions are comprised of in general, a compound of Formula (I) in<br>
combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are<br>
non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the<br>
compound of Formula (I). Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of<br>
an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.<br>
Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, sucrose,<br>
gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol<br>
monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients<br>
may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol and various oils, including<br>
those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral<br>
oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include water,<br>
saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols.<br>
Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of this invention in aerosol<br>
form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company,<br>
18th ed., 1990).<br>
The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range employed<br>
by those skilled in the art. Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight percent (wt %)<br>
basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt % of a compound of Formula (I) based on the total<br>
formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-80 wt %. Representative<br>
pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of Formula (I) are described below.<br>
As stated previously, the compounds of this invention can be administered in<br>
combination with known anti-cancer agents. Such known anti-cancer agents include the<br>
following: estrogen receptor modulators, androgen receptor modulators, retinoid receptor<br>
modulators, cytotoxic agents, antiproliferative agents, prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors,<br>
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, HIV protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors,<br>
and other angiogenesis inhibitors. The compounda of the present invention are particularly<br>
useful when adminsitered in combination with radiation therapy. Preferred angiogenesis<br>
inhibitors are selected from the group consisting of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, an inhibitor<br>
of epidermal-derived growth factor, an inhibitor of fibroblast-derived growth factor, an<br>
inhibitor of platelet derived growth factor, an MMP (matrix metalloprotease) inhibitor, an<br>
integrin blocker, interferon-a, interleukin-12, pentosan polysulfate, a cyclooxygenase<br>
inhibitor, carboxyamidotriazole, combretastatin A-4, squalamine, 6-0-chloroacetyl-<br>
carbonyl)-fumagillol, thalidomide, angiostatin, troponin-1, and an antibody to VEGFR.<br>

carboxyphenyl retinamide,<br>
"Cytotoxic agents" refer to compounds which cause cell death primarily by<br>
interfering directly with the cell's functioning or inhibit or interfere with cell mitosis,<br>
including alkylating agents, tumor necrosis factors, intercalators, microtubulin inhibitors,<br>

"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors" refers to inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-<br>
methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Compounds which have inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA<br>
reductase can be readily identified by using assays well-known In the art. For example, see<br>
the assays described or cited in U.S. Pat. No. 4,231,938 at col. 6, and WO 84/02131 at pp.<br>
30-33. The terms "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor" and "inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase"<br>
have the same meaning when used herein. It has been reported that (Int. J. Cancer, 20,<br>
97(6):746-50, (2002)) combination therapy with lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase<br>
inhibitor, and butyrate, an inducer of apoptosis in the Lewis lung carcinoma model in mice<br>
showed potentiating antitumor effects<br>
Examples of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that may be used include but are not<br>
limited to lovastatin (MEVACOR®; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,231,938,4,294,926, and<br>
4,319,039), simvastatin (ZOCOR®; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,784,4,820,850, and<br>

5,342,952) and cerivastatin (also known as rivastatin and BAYCHOL®; see U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,177,080). The structural formulas of these and additional HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors<br>
that may be used in the instant methods are described at page 87 of M. Yalpani,<br>
"Cholesterol Lowering Drugs", Chemistry &amp; Industry, pp. 85-89, Feb. 5,1996) and U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 4,782,084 and 4,885,314. The term HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor as used herein<br>
includes all pharmaceutically acceptable lactone and open-acid forms (i.e., where the<br>
lactone ring is opened to form the free acid) as well as salt and ester forms of compounds<br>
which have HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity, and Dolchicin the use of such salts,<br>
esters, open-acid and lactone forms is included within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
In HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors where an open-acid form can exist, salt and ester<br>
forms may preferably be formed from the open-acid, and all such forms are included within<br>
the meaning of the term "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor" as used herein. Preferably, the<br>
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is selected from lovastatin and simvastatin, and most<br>
preferably simvastatin.<br>
Herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" with respect to the HMG-CoA<br>
reductase inhibitor shall mean non-toxic salts of the compounds employed in this invention<br>
which are generally prepared by reacting the free acid with a suitable organic or inorganic<br>
base, particularly those formed from cations such as sodium, potassium, aluminum,<br>
calcium, lithium, magnesium, zinc and tetramethylammomum, as well as those salts<br>
formed from amines such as ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamme, lysine,<br>
arginine, ornithine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine,<br>
diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, 1-p-chlorobenzyl-2-pyrrolidine-1'-yl-<br>

The instant compounds are also useful, alone or in combination with platelet<br>
fibrinogen receptor (GP Ilb/UTa) antagonists, such as tirofiban, to inhibit metastasis of<br>
cancerous cells. Tumor cells can activate platelets largely via thrombin generation. This<br>
activation is associated with the release of VEGF. The release of VEGF enhances<br>
metastasis by increasing extravasation at points of adhesion to vascular endothelium<br>
(Amirkhosravi, Platelets 10,285-292, (1999)). Therefore, the present compounds can serve<br>
to inhibit metastasis, alone or in combination with GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. Examples of<br>
other fibrinogen receptor antagonists include abciximab, eptifibatide, sibrafiban, lamifiban,<br>
lotrafiban, cromofiban, and CT50352.<br>
If formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ Ihe compounds of<br>
this invention within the dosage range described above and the other pharmaceutically<br>
active agent(s) within its approved dosage range. Compounds of the instant invention may<br>
alternatively be used sequential^ with known pharmaceutically acceptable agent(s) when a<br>

The term administration and variants thereof (e.g., "administering" a compound) in<br>
reference to a compound of the invention means introducing the compound or a prodrug of<br>
the compound into the system of the animal in need of treatment. When a compound of the<br>
invention or prodrug thereof is provided in combination with one or more other active<br>
agents (e.g., a cytotoxic agent, etc.), "administration" and its variants are each understood<br>
to include concurrent and sequential introduction of the compound or prodrug thereof and<br>
other agents.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified inpedients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts.<br>
The compounds of the instant invention may also be co-administered with other<br>
well known therapeutic agents that are selected for their particular usefulness against the<br>
condition that is being treated. For example, the compounds of the instant invention may<br>
also be co-administered with other well known cancer therapeutic agents that are selected<br>
for their particular usefulness against the condition that is being treated. Included in such<br>
combinations of therapeutic agents are combinations of the farnesyl-protein transferase<br>
inhibitors disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,138 and an antineoplastic agent. It is also<br>
understood that such a combination of antineoplastic agent and inhibitor of farnesyl-protein<br>
transferase may be used in conjunction with other methods of treating cancer and/or<br>
tumors, including radiation therapy and surgery.<br>
Examples of an antineoplastic agent include, in general, microtubule-stabilizing<br>
agents (such as paclitaxel (also known as Taxol®), docetaxel (also known as<br>
Taxotere®epothilone A, epothilone B, desoxyepothilone A, desoxyepothilone B or then-<br>
derivatives); microtubule-disruptor agents; alkylating agents, anti-metabolites;<br>

mitoxantrone; platinum coordination complexes; biological response modifiers and growth<br>
inhibitors; hormonal/anti-hormonal therapeutic agents and haematopoietic growth factors.<br>
Example classes of antineoplastic agents include, for example, the anthracyclme<br>
family of drugs, the vinca drugs, the mitomycins, the bleomycins, the cytotoxic<br>
nucleosides, the taxanes, the epothilones, discodermolide, the pteridine family of drags,<br>
diynenes and the podophyllotoxins. Particularly useful members of those classes include,<br>
for example, doxorubicin, carminomycin, daunorubicin, aminopterin, methotrexate,<br>
methopterin, dichloro-methotrexate, mitomycin C, porfiromycin, Herceptin®, Rituxan®, 5-<br>

mixture was diluted with water (50 ml) and the organic solvents were removed in vacuo. The<br>
pH was adjusted to 4 with 1M aqueous HCl and the aqueous solution was extracted with<br>
dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over sodium<br>
sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo to provide 5-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1H-indole-2-carboxylic<br>
acid (1.7 g, 7.2 mmol) as a white solid. The crude acid was directly used without further<br>
purification.<br>

butyloxycarbonyl anhydride (21.8 g, 100 mmol) in THF (50 ml) and triethylamine (16.7 ml,<br>
120 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h, then diluted with ethyl acetate (200 ml),<br>
washed with 0.5M aqueous HCl (150 ml), and finally with brine (150 ml). The organic layer<br>
was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude iV-Boc<br>
propargylamine was directly used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Step 2<br>

triethylamine (9.31 ml, 126 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at room,<br>
temperature. Cu(I)I (0.508 g, 2.67 mmol) was added and stirring was continued for additional<br>
16 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (250 ml), washed with 0.5M aqueous<br>
HCl (200 ml), and finally with brine (200 ml). The organic layer was dried over sodium<br>
sulfate, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by flash chromatography over silica<br>
gel with ethyl acetate/hexane (1/4) provided methyl 4-(N-Boc-3-aminoprop-1-ynyl)benzoate<br>
(3.44 g) as highly viscous oil.<br>
Step 3<br>
To a solution of methyl 4-(N-Boc-3-aminoprop-1-ynyl)benzoate (3.40 g, 11.7 mmol) in<br>
THF (25 ml) was added 4M HCl/dioxane (25 ml, 100 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
for 1 h. The formed precipitate was collected, washed with diethyl ether (200 ml) and dried in<br>

Example 9<br>
Synthesis of acetyl-Gly-Ala-(N-acety 1-Lys)-AMC<br>
tert-Boc (N-Acetyl-Lys)-AMC (445 mg, 1 mmol, purchased from Bachem) was<br>
dissolved in 4M HCl in dioxane to provide H-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC as a white solid. To a<br>
solution of H-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC in DMF (5 ml) was added Ac-Gly-Ala-OH (188 mg, 1.0<br>
mmol) using PyBOP (520 mg, 1.0 mmol), HOBt.H2O (135 mg, 1.0 mmol), and NMM (0.296<br>
ml, 2.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and monitored by MS/LC for the<br>
presence of H-(N-acetyl-Lys)-AMC. Additional amounts of PyBOP (260 mg, 0.5 mmol),<br>
HOBt.H2O (70 mg, 0.5 mmol), and NMM (0.146 ml, 1.0 mmol) were added and the stirring<br>
was continued for additional 4 h after which the product was isolated in quantative yield.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Inhibition of HDAC in Vitro<br>
The HDAC inhibitory activity of the compounds of this invention in vitro was<br>
determined as follows.<br>
Measurements were performed in a reaction volume of 100 µl using 96-well assay<br>
plates. HDAC-1 (200 pM final concentration) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM<br>
KCl, 0.001% Tween-20,5% DMSO, pH 7.4) was mixed with inhibitor at various<br>
concentrations and allowed to incubate for 30 min, after which trypsin and acetyl-GIy-Ala-(N<br>
acetyl-Lys)-AMC were added to final concentrations of 50 nM and 25 µM, respectively, to<br>
initiate the reaction. Negative control reactions were performed in the absence of inhibitor in<br>
replicates of eight.<br>
The reactions were monitored in a fluorescence plate reader. After a 30 min lag time,<br>
the fluorescence was measured over a 30 min time frame using an excitation wavelength of<br>
355 nm and a detection wavelength of 460 nm. The increase in fluorescence with time was<br>
used as the measure of the reaction rate. Inhibition constants were obtained using the program<br>
BatchKi (Kuzmic et al. Anal. Biochem. 286,45-50, (2000)). The Ki for Compound 22, Table I,<br>
was 0.022 µm.<br>
Example 2<br>
Cell proliferation assay in Vitro<br>
The ability of the compounds of Formula (I) to inhibit growth of tumor cells in vitro<br>
was determined as follows.<br>
Stock cultures of the DU 145 prostate carcinoma cell line were maintained in RPMI<br>
medium 1640 containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium<br>
pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified<br>
atmosphere. Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 culture flasks and subcultures were established<br>
every 3 to 4 days so as not to allow the cells to exceed 90% confluence.<br>
DU 145 cells were harvested for proliferation assays by trypsinization (0.05%<br>
trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA), washed twice in culture medium, resuspended in appropriate volume<br>
of medium, and then counted using a hemacytometer. Cells were seeded in wells of flat-<br>
bottom 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cell/well in 100 µl. Cells were allowed to attach for<br>
1.5 to 2 hat 37 °C.<br>
Compounds were diluted from 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. Serial 3-fold<br>
dilutions were performed in medium containing 0.6% DMSO in wells (in triplicate) of a 96-<br>
well U-bottom plates starting with a 60 µM solution. After dilutions were completed, 100 µl of<br>
each compound dilution (in triplicate) was transferred to designated triplicate wells of the 96-<br>
well plate containing cells in 100 µl of medium. Final concentrations of the dose-response for<br>
compounds in assay plates ranged from 0.12 to 30 µM. Control wells (cells with no treatment)<br>
received 100 µl of 0.6% DMSO in culture medium. Wells containing medium with no cells<br>
served as the background wells. Cells were cultured with the compounds for 48 and 72 h at 37<br>
°C in a humidified CO2 incubator.<br>
Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring fluorescence after the addition of the<br>
fluorogenic redox indicator, Alamar Blue™ (BioSource International). Ten µl of Alamar<br>
Blue™ was added to each well of the 96-well plate(s) 3 to 4 h prior to the end of the incubation<br>
period. Assay plates were read in a fluorescence plate reader (excitation, 530 nm emission,<br>
620 nm). GI50 values (concentration at which the growth of the tumor cells was inhibited by<br>
50%) for compounds were determined by plotting the percent control fluorescence against the<br>
logarithm of the compound concentration. The compounds of this invention inhibited the<br>
growth of the tumor cells.<br>
