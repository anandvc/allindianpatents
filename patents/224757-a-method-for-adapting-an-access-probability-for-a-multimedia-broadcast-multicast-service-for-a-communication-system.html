				<td>A METHOD FOR ADAPTING AN ACCESS PROBABILITY<br>
FOR A MULTIMEDIA BROADCAST MULTICAST<br>
SERVICE FOR A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to packet data communication systems and<br>
more particularly to access to Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service in the<br>
packet data communication system.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a method for maximizing communication<br>
efficiency for group calls in a communication system. The Multimedia Broadcast<br>
Multicast Service (MBMS) service provides for a multicast and unicast of MBMS<br>
data, typically in a format of Internet Protocol (IP) data packets to one or more of<br>
the user equipments UEs. In order to ensure that the air interface resources of<br>
the packet data communication system are not wasted, the system must first<br>
estimate the number of recipients, that is subscribed user equipments (UEs), in a<br>
cell providing MBMS data. Based on the estimated number of recipients, the<br>
system then determines whether to establish a Point-To-Multipoint (PTM)<br>
communication channel in the cell or a Point-To-Point (PTP) channel to each<br>
recipient, and also how to optimize the radio bearers. In general, when the<br>
estimated number of recipients in the cell exceeds an operator defined threshold,<br>
the system establishes a PTM channel in the cell. When the estimated number<br>
of recipients in the cell is less than the operator defined threshold, the system<br>
establishes a PTP channel to each subscribing MS in the cell. Further, in order to<br>
exploit the diversity benefit, even if some neighboring cells do not have enough<br>
MBMS UEs there for PTM transmission, they<br>
may still choose the PTM transmission to obtain the<br>
diversity benefit for the system.<br>
Typically, the system estimates the number of<br>
recipients based on a number of UEs subscribing to MBMS<br>
services that are currently connected to the network.<br>
Based on the estimate, the system determines whether to<br>
establish a PTM communication channel in the cell or a<br>
PTP communication channel to each UE. However, such a<br>
determination fails to account for idle mode MSs and<br>
URA_PCH mode UEs serviced by the RAN and subscribing to<br>
the MBMS service. The idle mode users and URA_PCH mode<br>
users should also be counted. The system then broadcasts<br>
a MBMS notification to all UEs in the cell. In response<br>
to receiving the MBMS notification, each UE in the cell<br>
that subscribes to the MBMS service may then convey a<br>
connection request. Upon receiving the connection<br>
requests from each of the subscribing UEs, the system<br>
decides to establish a PTM communication channel or<br>
establishes PTP communication channels with each<br>
responding UE.<br>
In order to limit the number of connection requests<br>
generated in response to the MBMS notification, it has<br>
been proposed to broadcast an access probability factor<br>
in conjunction with the MBMS notification. However, a<br>
problem arises in that, typically, the system is not<br>
aware of a number of idle mode UEs in a cell that have<br>
subscribed to an MBMS service. When the access<br>
probability factor is set to a high value and the number<br>
of idle mode UEs subscribing to the MBMS service is also<br>
large, an access channel can be overloaded by the number<br>
of connection requests generated in response to the MBMS<br>
notification. On the other hand, when the access<br>
probability factor is set to a low value and the number<br>
of idle mode MSs subscribing to the MBMS service is<br>
small, the number of connection requests received by the system in response to<br>
a counting request may be insufficient to invoke establishment of a PTM<br>
channel.<br>
The process of counting the idle mode UEs may substantially load the radio<br>
access channel (RACH). In addition it is time consuming to count a sufficient<br>
number of UEs in order to make the point-to-point or point-to-miltipoint decision<br>
by the system.<br>
Further, the diversity can give much benefit to the MBMS reception<br>
performance.<br>
Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to have an adaptive access<br>
probability factor which will adapt the access probability factor to the response<br>
received from the counting process.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention may be more fully described<br>
with reference to FIGs. 1-7. FIG. 1 is a block diagram<br>
of a wireless communication system 100 in accordance with<br>
the present invention. Communication system 100 includes<br>
multiple user equipments (UEs) or mobile stations (MBS)<br>
102-104 (three shown) in wireless communication with a<br>
Radio Access Network (RAN) 110. RAN 110 includes one<br>
transceiver, 112 that is operably coupled to a controller<br>
114, preferably a Radio network Controller (RNC).<br>
Communication system 100 further includes a coupling to<br>
network 124 and to MBMS data source 126.<br>
Each of MSs 102-104 subscribes to a Multimedia<br>
Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) service provided by<br>
communication system 100, which service provides for a<br>
distribution of MBMS data to the MSs. MBMS services are<br>
described in detail in the 3GPP (Third Generation<br>
Partnership Project) standards, and in particular 3GPP TS<br>
(Technical Specification) 25.34 6 vO.5.0, 3GPP TS 23.846<br>
v6.0.0, 3GPP TS 22.146 v6.0.0, 3GPP TR (Technical Report)<br>
21.905 v5.4.0, and Report R2-030063, which specifications<br>
and reports are hereby incorporated by reference herein<br>
and copies of which may be obtained from the 3GPP via the<br>
Internet or from the 3GPP Organization Partners'<br>
Publications Offices at Mobile Competence Centre 650,<br>
route des Lucioles, 06921 Sophia-Antipolis Cedex, France.<br>
Ran 110 provides communications services to mobile<br>
stations, such as MS 102-104, located in a coverage area,<br>
such as a cell, serviced by the Ran via an air interface<br>
128.<br>
Communication system 100 may include a Universal<br>
Mobile Telecommunication Service (UMTS) communication<br>
system that operates in accordance with the 3GPP (Third<br>
Generation Partnership Project) standards. However,<br>
those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that<br>
communication system 100 may operate in accordance with<br>
any wireless telecommunication system, such as but not<br>
limited to a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)<br>
communication system, a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA) 2000 communication system, or an Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM) communication<br>
system.<br>
Communication system 100 further includes a<br>
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) data source<br>
126, such as an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast server,<br>
that is coupled to network 124, such as an IP network.<br>
Network 124 is coupled to RAN controller 114. As part of<br>
the MBMS service subscribed to by each of MSs 102-104,<br>
MBMS data source 126 sources MBMS data, typically in the<br>
form of IP data packets, to MSs 102-104 via support node<br>
120 and RAN 110, and in particular via controllers<br>
servicing the service subscribers, that is, controller<br>
114 with respect to MSs 102-104. When RAN 110, and in<br>
particular controller 114, receives the MBMS data, the<br>
RAN must then determine whether to convey the MBMS data<br>
to each of the subscribing MSs serviced by the RAN, that<br>
is MSs 102-104, via a multicast, or Point-To-Multipoint<br>
(PTM), communication channel or individual unicast, or<br>
Point-To-Point (PTP), communication channels.<br>
In order to determine whether to establish a PTM<br>
communication channel or individual PTP communication<br>
channels, RAN 110 must first estimate the number of MSs<br>
located in the coverage area serviced by the RAN and<br>
subscribing to the MBMS service sourcing the MBMS data<br>
and determine an access probability factor based on the<br>
estimate. In prior art proposals, a RAN determines an<br>
access probability factor based on a number of MSs with<br>
active connections to the RAN and subscribing to the MBMS<br>
service. However, such a determination fails to account<br>
for idle mode MSs and URA_PCH mode users serviced by the<br>
RAN and subscribing to the MBMS service. In the<br>
following, the idle mode users refer to both the idle<br>
mode users and the URA_PCH mode users. As a result, in<br>
the prior art, when a large number of idle MSs subscribe<br>
to the service and the access probability factor is set<br>
to a high value, the determined an access probability<br>
factor could result in an overloading of an access<br>
channel by a number of MSs responding to an MBMS<br>
notification or, when a small number of idle MSs<br>
subscribed to the service and the RAN set an access<br>
probability factor to a low value, the number of<br>
connection requests received by the RNC in response to a<br>
counting request may be insufficient to invoke<br>
establishment of a PTM channel when a PTM channel may be<br>
the most efficient scheme for disseminating the<br>
multimedia data.<br>
In order to prevent radio access channel 136 from<br>
being overwhelmed by connection requests in response to<br>
an MBMS notification, and to provide for an appropriate<br>
selection of a PTM connection or individual PTP<br>
connections for conveyance of MBMS data, communication<br>
system 100 provides for a more accurate method of<br>
estimating a number of MSs subscribing to an MBMS service<br>
and located in a service area of RAN 110 while limiting a<br>
number of MSs responding to the MBMS notification, and<br>
further provides an adaptively determined access<br>
probability factor to optimize the number of responses<br>
and the estimate of the number of subscribing MSs.<br>
Communication system 100 employs the use of<br>
probability to determine a number of MSs subscribing to<br>
the MBMS service and determining whether to establish a<br>
point-to-multipoint or a point-to-point communication<br>
connection for conveyance of MBMS data. Controller 114<br>
of RAN 110 determines the quantity of mobile stations<br>
subscribing to the MBMS service.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2 and 3, a method for adaptively<br>
setting an access probability factor is shown.<br>
Controller 114 sets 150 the access probability factor P<br>
equal to Pinit which is the initial value of the access<br>
probability factor. RAN 110 then broadcasts the access<br>
probability factor P to each of the MSs 102-104. Next<br>
controller 114 begins counting the idle MSs or UEs, block<br>
152. The probability access factor P is broadcast in<br>
control messages to the user equipments 102-104, block<br>
154.<br>
In response to broadcasting one or more control<br>
messages that include the access probability factor P,<br>
controller 114 obtains a number N responses for<br>
establishing a link to the access channel 136.<br>
Controller 114 obtains the number N of the idle mode UEs<br>
subscribing to the MBMS service by counting by one or<br>
more control connected base stations of RAN 110 the<br>
number of MBMS service subscribers, block 156.<br>
Next, controller 114 determines whether N the number<br>
of idle mode UEs responding to the counting is greater<br>
than the ratio of point-to-point connections over point-<br>
to-multipoint connections M, block 158. If the number of<br>
idle mode UEs N is greater than the ratio M, block 158<br>
transfers control to block 160 via the yes path. Since<br>
the number of idle user equipments which may use MBMS<br>
services is quite large, block 160 selects the point-to-<br>
multipoint broadcast mode for the MBMS services. Next,<br>
controller 114 adjusts the Pinit to be equal to the access<br>
probability factor P multiplied by the ratio of M over N.<br>
M is the ratio of point-to-point connections divided by<br>
the point-to-multipoint connections. N is the number of<br>
UEs in the idle mode with MBMS services, block 162. The<br>
process is then ended.<br>
If in block 158, the number of UEs N is less than or<br>
equal to M, the ratio of point-to-point divided by point-<br>
to-multipoint connections, then block 158 transfers<br>
control to block 164 via the no path. Then the<br>
controller determines whether the access probability<br>
factor P is equal to 1. If the access probability factor<br>
P is equal to 1, block 164 transfers control to block 166<br>
via the yes path.<br>
Then a point-to-point channel broadcast connection<br>
is selected by the controller, block 166. This<br>
establishes a coupling from RAN 110 to user equipment<br>
102, for example.<br>
Then the controller adjusts the initial access<br>
probability factor Pinit to be equal to P, which in this<br>
case is 1, block 168. Then the process is ended.<br>
If in block 164, P is not equal to 1, block 164<br>
transfers control to block 170 via the no path. In block<br>
170 the controller determines whether the number of idle<br>
UEs M is equal to zero. If M, the number of idle UEs, is<br>
equal to zero, block 170 transfers control to block 172 .<br>
via the yes path. The controller then sets the access<br>
probability factor P equal to 1, block 172. Block 172<br>
then transfers control to block 180.<br>
If M, the number of idle mode UEs, is not equal to<br>
zero, block 170 transfers control to block 174 via the no<br>
path. Controller then calculates a new access<br>
probability factor P to be equal to the old access<br>
probability factor P multiplied by the ratio of M over N,<br>
block 174. Again, M is the ratio of the number of point-<br>
to-point connections divided by the number of point-to-<br>
multipoint connections in the RAN.<br>
Next, the controller determines whether the access<br>
probability factor P is greater than Pt, the access<br>
probability factor threshold, block 176. When the access<br>
probability factor P is less than the threshold value Pt,<br>
the radio access channel 136 load can be reduced. If the<br>
access probability factor P is greater than the threshold<br>
Pt, block 176 transfers control to block 178 via the yes<br>
path. In block 178 the controller sets the access<br>
probability factor P equal to 1 and then transfers<br>
control to block 180.<br>
In block 180 the controller determines whether the<br>
access probability factor P is greater than 1. If not,<br>
block 18 0 transfers control to block 154 via the no path.<br>
Block 154 then broadcasts the new access probability<br>
factor P in a control message.<br>
If the access probability factor P is less than or<br>
equal to 1, block 180 transfers control to block 166 via<br>
the yes path. Since the access probability factor is<br>
typically less than 1, the controller selects a point-to-<br>
point channel broadcast. Then the controller adjusts the<br>
access probability factor Pinit to be equal to the access<br>
probability factor P. Then the process is ended.<br>
In the above method if the received response from<br>
the UEs is greater than the threshold, a point-to-<br>
multipoint channel broadcast will be selected and the<br>
initial access probability factor is updated. If the<br>
received response from the UEs is small, the access<br>
probability factor is updated depending upon the access<br>
channel loading and the new access probability factor is<br>
broadcast.<br>
When the number of user equipments is large, this<br>
method will converge the value of P to a minimal required<br>
level to provide efficient loading of radio access<br>
channel. When the number of user equipments is small,<br>
this method can adaptively increase the value of the<br>
access probability factor P and converge quickly the<br>
access probability value to a minimal required level for<br>
point-to-point/point-to-multipoint transmissions.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, the method for user<br>
equipment 102-104 is shown. The process is started and<br>
block 190 is entered. The user equipment determines<br>
whether a radio access channel connection is already in<br>
existence. If it is, block 190 transfers control to<br>
block 191 and the process is ended.<br>
If the connection does not exist, block 190<br>
transfers control to block 192. In block 192, the user<br>
equipment selects a random number between zero and one (0<br>
and 1), inclusive of zero and one.<br>
Next, the user equipment determines whether the<br>
selected random number is less than P, the access<br>
probability factor. If the selected random number is<br>
greater than or equal to the access probability factor P,<br>
block 194 transfers control via the NO path to end the<br>
process. If the selected random number is less than the<br>
access probability factor, block 194 transfers control to<br>
block 196 via the yes path. The UE then requests<br>
establishment of a point-to-point connection with the<br>
network, block 196. Then the process is ended.<br>
PIG. 5 depicts two cells and base stations (not<br>
shown) coupled to a user equipment. Currently, a cell<br>
only counts the UEs which regards the cell as the<br>
strongest one. This may potentially reduce the<br>
performance. For example, if 50 UEs at the cell edge of<br>
the cell 1 and cell 2, and all of them regards cell 1 as<br>
the strongest cell (cell 2 as the second strongest cell).<br>
It is better to turn on both cells in PTM mode instead of<br>
turning cell 1 on. It is desirable for the cells to<br>
count all the UEs that regard the cell as strongest one<br>
or regard the cell as the secondary strongest one. The<br>
information can then be used for the radio bearer setup<br>
optimization.<br>
FIG.5, describes the counting procedure and how the<br>
counting procedures work to obtain the diversity. Cell<br>
701 of a first base station and cell 702 of a second base<br>
station (the base stations are not shown) are the<br>
strongest cell and the secondary strongest cell for the<br>
UE 703, respectively. The UE 703 is in idle mode and<br>
should be counted for the MBMS radio bearer set up.<br>
Typically, the UE needs to join the counting procedure<br>
both in cell 701 and cell 702 though the channel 704 and<br>
705, respectively. Therefore, both cell 701 and cell 702<br>
may count the UE 703 for their radio bearer set up<br>
decision. In this way, the diversity gain may be<br>
obtained.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a chart of the relationship<br>
between the number of user equipments that will be<br>
counted for MBMS access and the overall number of user<br>
equipments is shown. Graphic line 200 depicts an access<br>
probability factor P equal to 1. This produces a linear<br>
relationship between the number of MBMS users accessing<br>
the radio access channel and the overall number of users<br>
in a given cell.<br>
Graphic line 210 represents this same relationship<br>
within an adaptive access probability factor provided by<br>
the present invention. It is to be noted that with the<br>
present method that for large numbers of MBMS users, near<br>
200, a very small amount of users will access the radio<br>
access channel for counting, approximately 20. For the<br>
method of the present invention the appropriate number of<br>
users for counting to obtain the point-to-point/point-to-<br>
multipoint transition decision is relatively easy. For a<br>
fixed access probability factor P=l overload of the radio<br>
access channel is known to be very large when the number<br>
of overall users is large. The present adaptive access<br>
probability factor keeps the number of counting users<br>
relatively low and dynamically adjusts the access<br>
probability factor P.<br>
FIG. 7 again depicts the relationship between the<br>
number of users accessing the radio access channel and<br>
the overall number of users, applying different access<br>
probability factor thresholds Pt. Graph 220 depicts a<br>
representation for an access probability factor threshold<br>
of .1. As the overall number of users increases, the<br>
number of users accessing the radio channel increases<br>
substantially. With an access probability factor<br>
threshold of Pt equal to .0.3, the number of users to be<br>
counted is substantially reduced as shown in graphic<br>
representation 222. Lastly, representation 224 shows a Pt<br>
equal to .05 to 1.0. This is an optimal threshold which<br>
gives the best overall performance. However, the value<br>
to set Pt depends on the actual operating system. For<br>
example, if the system can tolerate more overload a<br>
smaller value of Pt may be better, for example 0.3.<br>
The present method provides the following advantages<br>
by setting a small initial value Pinit, a fast convergence<br>
in performed by the method and the number of counting<br>
overloads is substantially reduced. The user equipment<br>
will use a probability factor to determine whether it<br>
will join the counting. As a result, each user equipment<br>
will at most be counted once. The initial probability<br>
Pinit is optimized based on the single broadcast success<br>
probability for a number of users. The Pt value is<br>
optimized by trade off between the number of broadcast<br>
times and the counting overload.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
has been illustrated, and that form described in detail,<br>
it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that various modifications may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit of the present invention or<br>
from the scope of the appended claims.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A method for adapting an access probability for a Multimedia Broadcast<br>
Multicast Service (MBMS) service for a communication system comprising:<br>
determining a quantity of mobile stations subscribed to the MBMS service;<br>
setting an initial probability factor;<br>
broadcasting a control message comprising the initial access probability<br>
factor;<br>
receiving from one or more mobile stations, a response to the control<br>
message;<br>
determining whether a number of received responses from the mobile<br>
stations is zero; and<br>
if the number of received responses is not zero, adapting a new access<br>
probability factor equal to the initial access probability factor multiplied by a ratio<br>
of a number of point-to-point connections divided by a number of point-to-<br>
multipoint connections to the number of received responses.<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein there is provided a step of if<br>
the number of received responses is zero, setting the new access probability<br>
factor equal to 1.<br>
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein if the number of received<br>
responses is not equal to zero, there is provided a step of determining whether<br>
the new access probability factor is greater than a threshold value equal to 1.<br>
4. The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein if the new access probability<br>
factor is greater than the threshold value equal to 1, there is provided a step of<br>
setting the new access probability factor equal to 1.<br>
5. The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein there is provided a step of<br>
determining whether the new access probability factor is greater than 1.<br>
6. A method for adapting an access probability for a Multimedia Broadcast<br>
Multicast Service (MBMS) service for a communication system comprising:<br>
determining a quantity of mobile stations subscribed to the MBMS service;<br>
setting an initial probability factor;<br>
broadcasting a control message comprising the initial access probability<br>
factor;<br>
receiving from one or more mobile stations, a response to the control<br>
message;<br>
determining whether a number of received responses from the mobile<br>
stations is zero;<br>
if the number of received responses is not zero, adapting a new access<br>
probability factor equal to the initial access probability factor multiplied by a ratio<br>
of the number of point-to-point connections divided by the number of point-to-<br>
multipoint connections to the number of received responses; and<br>
determining by a mobile station whether a control connection between the<br>
mobile station and the communication system exists.<br>
7. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein if the control connection does<br>
not exist, there is provided a step of selecting a random number between zero<br>
and one.<br>
8. The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein there is provided a step of<br>
determining whether the selected random number is less than the new access<br>
probability factor.<br>
9. The method as claimed in claim 8, wherein if the selected random number<br>
is less than the new access probability factor, there is provided a step of<br>
establishing by the mobile station a connection with the communication system.<br>
10. The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein there is provided a step of if<br>
the number of received responses is zero, setting the new access probability<br>
factor equal to 1.<br>
A communication system (100) determines whether to establish a point-to-<br>
point or point-to-multipoint communication for conveyance of Multimedia<br>
Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) data based on a number of user<br>
equipments (102-104) being serviced by the communication system for MBMS<br>
service. The system broadcasts an access probability factor (154) in a control<br>
message to the user equipments. For a large number of MBMS users being<br>
counted (158), the method will select a point-to-multipoint broadcast (160). If the<br>
number of user equipments being counted is relatively small, the access<br>
probability factor is modified by a ratio of the number of point-to-point<br>
connections over the point-to-multipoint connections over the number of users<br>
being counted (174). The UE may need to join multiple base stations' in the<br>
counting procedure to obtain the system diversity gain.</td>
